<P>GOD, who promi&s;ed <HI>to be a Fa|ther to the Fatherle&s;s,</HI> took Care of him, and endued him with his Grace; and about the Year 1680, gave him a Part of the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, (notwith&s;tanding he was not one of the wi&s;e of this World, nor had humane Learning;) yet he was made, a

<P>THEN the Child of God comes to be led by the Spirit of God, who leads none to do Evil, nor to &s;in again&s;t him, but guides them into all Truth, &s;etting them at Liberty from being Servants to Sin, <HI>Joh.</HI> viii. 32.

po&s;&s;ible for him to overcome Sin, and forbear committing Iniquity a|gain; and likewi&s;e he could do no|thing of him&s;elf but back&s;lide daily, unle&s;s the Lord would deliver him out of all Wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT there are &s;ome People that &s;eem Religious by &s;etting them&s;elves at Work to lop the Tree of Iniquity, endeavouring to cut away the Bran|ches as they grow; This is the hopele&s;s Labour and Striving which they e&s;teem profitable for them to be at all their Days, and leave the Tree alive, and to bear Branches, that they may be daily employed to lop them.</P>
<P>WHAT then? Do they think if the Tree dies, that they have no more to do towards the Work of their Salvation? But of a Truth, the Salvation of the Soul is to know the inward &s;piritual Grace to mor|tify the Tree, by killing the Root of it, &s;o that there may be Room
<PB N="99" REF="002950_0057_0FE6A205245FBCB0">
for the Tree of Life, even the Truth, Chri&s;t within, to grow in the Soul, and to bring forth his own good Fruits.</P>
<P>THEREFORE let every true. Chri&s;tian lay down his own Axe, and pray to God for Grace to mor|tify and &s;lay all his &s;inful Lu&s;ts, and to give him Victory over the De|vil and all his Temptations, Sin and iniquity; but I believe that &s;ome People have &s;ought Help from God again&s;t all Iniquity and &s;inful Lu&s;ts, and that he heard them, and di|&s;tributed unto them a Mea&s;ure of his Grace and Spirit, &s;o that their Words and Actions, in Degree, &s;prung from the Spirit of God, and from a good State and Condition.</P>
<P>BUT for all That, their Principles oblige them to account all their Actions (let them be bad or good) altogether Sin; and in that they wrong the Lord, and injure them|&s;elves; becau&s;e their Rudiments do
<PB N="100" REF="002950_0058_0FE6A2115FAE36D8">
not allow them to make a Differ|ence between Bad and Good, and become as the Mouth of the Lord: For when a Child of God offends, he &s;oon knows Cha&s;ti&s;eme it from his Father, as a Cloud coming over him, with Guilt and Trouble, be|cau&s;e his Father hides his Face; but when he does well, his Father &s;miles upon him, rewarding him with Con&s;olation and Joy, and &s;peaking Peace to him; &s;o the Child knows, that it was not Sin he com|mitted at that time.</P>

<P>BUT the Lord, in Conde&s;cen&s;ion to his own People, the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> delivered to them divers Or|dinances and U&s;ages, <HI>to wit,</HI> Wa&s;h|ings, Purification, Offerings and Sa|crifices, which were outward Things, to &s;ignify the Sub&s;tance which was to be revealed in the Fulne&s;s of Times.

<P>BUT next after all tho&s;e Signs and Shadows, the Lord, for prepa|ring
<PB N="103" REF="002950_0059_0FE6A2117ABC0A90">
the Way to Chri&s;t, &s;ent <HI>John</HI> to baptize the People in <HI>Jordan,</HI> confe&s;&s;ing their Sins; and then <HI>John</HI> &s;aid, <HI>I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance, but he that cometh after me, is mightier than I, who&s;e Shoes I am not worthy to bear, he &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t and with Fire,</HI> Mat. iii. 11.</P>
<P>SO there was a Difference be|tween the Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t, and the Bapti&s;m of <HI>John,</HI> becau&s;e they were not of one Nature nor of one Matter: For the one baptized with outward Water, and the other bap|tized with the Holy Gho&s;t and with &s;piritual Fire; the one wa&s;hed the Body, the other wa&s;hed the Soul. So Chri&s;t commanded his Di&s;ciples, <HI>that they &s;hould not depart from Jeru|&s;alem, but wait for the Promi&s;e of the Father, which,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>ye have heard of me: For John truly baptized with Water, but ye &s;hall be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t not many Days hence,</HI> Acts i. 4, 5.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="002950_0060_0FE6A214386076F0">THESE two Te&s;timonies do well agree with each other, and both make the Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t, and the Bapti&s;m of <HI>John,</HI> to be two Bapti&s;ms. The Bapti&s;m of <HI>John</HI> was an outward Shadow <HI>&s;ignifying,</HI> but the Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t was the Sub&s;tance, and <HI>&s;aving.</HI> The Bap|ti&s;m of <HI>John</HI> and his Mini&s;try &s;tood only in Force at the Time when Chri&s;t walked upon the Earth; therefore Chri&s;t went to his Bap|ti&s;m for the Fulfilling of his Mini|&s;try: But <HI>John</HI> endeavoured to hin|der him, &s;aying, <HI>I have need to be baptized of thee, and come&s;t thou to me? And Je&s;us an&s;wering, &s;aid unto him&punc; Suffer it to be &s;o now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all Righteou&s;|ne&s;s. Then John &s;uffered him,</HI> Mat. iii. 14, 15.</P>
<P>AND as <HI>John</HI> and his Mini&s;try and Bapti&s;m was to decrea&s;e, and pa&s;s by, &s;o Chri&s;t and his Bapti&s;m and Mini&s;try was to increa&s;e, and
<PB N="105" REF="002950_0060_0FE6A214386076F0">
to be &s;et up and &s;tand to the End. So that the Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t was the only Bapti&s;m which did, and doth deliver and &s;ave the Souls; therefore the Apo&s;tle &s;aid, <HI>One Lord, one Faith, one Bapti&s;m,</HI> Eph. iv. 5. And &s;ince there was but one Bap|ti&s;m to remain, no more than but one Lord and one Faith and one God, doubtle&s;s it is, that Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m was that one Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>BUT Je&s;us &s;uffered his Di&s;ciples to baptize with Water, to accom|pli&s;h <HI>John</HI>'s Admini&s;tration, until the Time came to baptize with the Holy Spirit; and as the Di&s;ciples loved <HI>John,</HI> and e&s;teemed his Ad|mini&s;tration, and being natural to it by the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Ordinances, &s;o they made U&s;e thereof in their Freedom among tho&s;e that believed; but they knew it was not the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, as <HI>Peter</HI> ob&s;er|ved, when he preached at the Hou&s;e of <HI>Cornelius, And the Holy Gho&s;t fell
<PB N="106" REF="002950_0061_0FE6A21464257AA0">
upon the People, &s;aying, then remem|bred I the Word of the Lord, how that he &s;aid,</HI> John <HI>indeed baptized with Water, but ye &s;hall he baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> Acts xi. 16.</P>
<P>BUT when Darkne&s;s came in a|mong&s;t the Chri&s;tians, and they lo&s;t Sight of Chri&s;t within, and the Bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, then there was Nothing but extolling the Sign in&s;tead of the Sub&s;tance, and &s;et it up as the Horn of Salvation, and give it a great Name in the Church, accounting it to be the Means by which a Man is made Chri&s;tian. But &s;ome u&s;e the Way of Water-Bapti&s;m as the Apo&s;tles did, without depending thereon, but to fulfil it, becau&s;e they think it their incumbent Duty: I do not judge &s;uch.</P>
<P>BUT the Hurt is, when People &s;et up &s;ome outward Tradition de|pending upon it for Salvation, their Zeal goes much for it, and the
<PB N="107" REF="002950_0061_0FE6A21464257AA0">
more their Zeal is, the more they make it their Idol, and then they cannot bear &s;o much as to ask from whence it came, what Scripture is for it: There is in this dark Zeal, Gall, Blood and Revenge; and &s;uch Zeal as this has been the Cau&s;e for the Martyrs of Je&s;us frequently to lo&s;e their Blood; becau&s;e the Me&s;&s;age of the Amba&s;&s;adors which God &s;ent was to bear Te&s;timony a|gain&s;t all Manner of Idols.</P>
<P>AND when Chrif&s;tians came to be fully per&s;waded, that Water-Bap|ti&s;m was nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, they judged it needful to baptize little Children, le&s;t they &s;hould die be|fore they had Bapti&s;m, and be damn|ed; but when they &s;aw it was hurt|ful for &s;ome little Children to be dipt over Head in Water, then they invented another Way to baptize, which is corrupt and un&s;crip|tural.</P>
<P>AND altlho' the Prote&s;tants have
<PB N="108" REF="002950_0062_0FE6A2200CD49B60">
te&s;tify'd that Water-Bapti&s;m was not nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation, and as the friendly and con&s;iderate People of the Church of <HI>England</HI> will ac|knowledge, that Water-Bapti&s;m does Nothing for the Soul, yet the &s;ame, in the like corrupt Way, has crept in among them from the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;o far, that the dark Peo|ple among the Prote&s;tants are of the &s;ame Tone as the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> Oh! Oh! the holy Bapti&s;m: Oh! make the Man a Chri&s;tian; &s;o that when a Child is born into the World, they mu&s;t make ha&s;te to go with him (as they &s;ay) to make him a
Chriftian.</P>
<P>NOW therefore, O thou incon&s;i|derate Man, can&s;t thou bear us to take a View of, and handle this Matter a little, to &s;ee if there is Life in it, and how far it is agree|able with the Scriptures. They &s;ay, that Chri&s;t ordained two Sacra|ments in his Church, when we do
<PB N="109" REF="002950_0062_0FE6A2200CD49B60">
not read that Chri&s;t ever &s;poke of a Sacrament; nor is there any &s;uch Word as Sacrament in all the Scrip|ture: But they will &s;ay, the Thing does not con&s;i&s;t in the Name, but what we mean by this Sacrament is Bapti&s;m; what then? Is this Way of Bapti&s;m which we now &s;peak of more agreeable to the Scriptures than the Word Sacrament? That is not yet made out.</P>
<P>AGAIN, they will &s;ay, we are all by Nature born Children of Wrath, and by Bapti&s;m are made Children of Grace: I utterly deny, that little Children new-born, are Children of Wrath; and al&s;o, that, by &s;uch Bapti&s;m (which we are now &s;peaking of) any are made Chil|dren of Grace. Are not new-born Children without Sin? Truly before Sin came, God looked on all that he had made, and the &s;ame was good in his Sight: But they &s;ay, when <HI>Adam</HI> tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, he brought
<PB N="110" REF="002950_0063_0FE6A2202C0593B8">
in Sin upon all his Offspring, and they are Partakers of his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and that the Children of <HI>Adam</HI> are by Nature become Sinners. That is granted; but that they are born Children of Wrath, and that God imputeth Sin to them before they do &s;in, That is deny'd</P>
<P>FOR the Apo&s;tle &s;aid, <HI>Where no Law is, there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> Rom. iv. 15. Since that the States of new-born Children do not ap|prehend, nor can they reach to come at any Law; therefore Iniquity is not laid to their Charge; <HI>For Sin is not imputed, where there is no Law,</HI> Rom. v. 13. So where there is nei|ther Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion nor Sin, how can we think there is Damnation? But tho&s;e that hold forth the Dam|nation of little Children, they ima|gine they have a Foundation for it from the Words of the Prophet, who &s;aid, <HI>I was &s;hapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive
<PB N="111" REF="002950_0063_0FE6A2202C0593B8">
me,</HI> P&s;al. li. 5. Is not this Sin ra|ther to be imputed to the Parents than the Child? For he doth not &s;ay, my Mother conceived me a Sinner, but in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</P>
<P>AND the Scripture &s;aith, <HI>The Soul that &s;inneth, it &s;hall Die: The Son &s;hall not bear the Iniquity of the Father, neither &s;hall the Father bear the Ini|quity of the Son,</HI> Ezek. xviii. 20. But for the Iniquity the Man him|&s;elf commits, he &s;hall die. O, I would think that Chri&s;t's own Words are &s;ufficient to give Satisfaction to every con&s;iderate and impartial Man, and put this Controver&s;y out of all Doubt, who extolled the State of little Children, &s;aying to his Di&s;ci|ples, <HI>Except ye be converted, and be|come as little Children, ye &s;hall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> Mat. xviii. 3, 4, 10.</P>
<P>WE may &s;ee here, how Chri&s;t owns the States of little Children
<PB N="112" REF="002950_0064_0FE6A221716CE888">
above the States of his Di&s;ciples, when they inquired who &s;hould be the greate&s;t in the Kingdom of Hea|en, <HI>And he having called unto him a little Child, and &s;etting him in the Mid&s;t of them,</HI> he further &s;aid, <HI>who|&s;oever therefore &s;hall humble him&s;elf as this little' Child, the &s;ame is the great|e&s;t in the Kingdom of Heaven; take Heed that ye de&s;pi&s;e not one of the&s;e little Ones; for I &s;ay unto you, that in Heaven their Angels do always behold the Face of my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> Here is the Judgment of the King, who knows better than Men, who is fit to enter into his Kingdom.</P>
<P>HE al&s;o is the Door of the Sheep, and he knoweth his own, and tho&s;e that go in by him: If any be &s;o ignorant to think, that tho&s;e Children whom Chri&s;t &s;o much owned, were baptized, there was no bapti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of little Children in tho&s;e Times; and there is no Cau&s;e

to think, that the Condition of lit|tle Children is wor&s;e now, than in tho&s;e Times: So the Command of Chri&s;t was, <HI>Take Heed, that ye de|&s;pi&s;e not one of the&s;e little Ones, who&s;e Angels behold God's Face.</HI></P>
<P>BUT dark People take little No|tice of what Chri&s;t &s;aid; but the Rudiments which they have receiv|ed by Tradition, from the Leaders of their Churches, tho&s;e they be|lieve, and will have to be Truth: Therefore they are not afraid to di&s;e&s;teem the State of little Chil|dren, who are newly come into the World, from under the Hand of their perfect Creator, who made all Things good, and according to his own Plea&s;ure; but they reckon the Child a Jew, or &s;ome unaccep|table Stranger, 'till they go with him to the Prie&s;t, to be made (as they judge) a Chri&s;tian, and accep|table.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="002950_0065_0FE6A22196CB7EB8">AND if the Child dies before he be baptized, they deem it not fit to bury him like a Chri&s;tian, af|ter the Order of the Church; but when the Child hath been under the Prie&s;t's Hands, if he happens to die before he &s;inneth, there is no Doubt of his Salvation: What then &s;hall be thought of the&s;e Things? Did not God know how, or was he not able to make the Child according to his own Mind? But the Prie&s;t does know how, and is able to make him according to the Lord's Mind; &s;o that it is Time to go with the Child to the Prie&s;t, where Sureties mu&s;t be had, to en|gage for him: Fir&s;t, <HI>That he &s;hould deny the Devil, and all his Works, the Pomp and Vanity of this wicked World, and all the &s;inful Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h.</HI> Secondly, <HI>That he &s;hould be|lieve all the Points of the Chri&s;tian Faith.</HI> Thirdly, <HI>That he &s;hould keep the ble&s;&s;ed Will of God, and hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

Commandment's, and walk in the &s;ame all the Days of his Life.</HI></P>
<P>AND altho' they them&s;elves judge, that they are not able to perform the&s;e Promi&s;es, yet it is ea&s;y to get tho&s;e Sureties; but if they were to be bound by Promi&s;es concerning Things of this World, they would take more Care before they become engaged, how they might perform their Promi&s;es.</P>
<P>SO after having a little Water, the Prie&s;t goes and prays to God, that he would &s;anctify that Water, &s;o that it may wa&s;h away Sin; then the &s;inful Man goes to wa&s;h the innocent from his Sins: But what is this good for? There is no Rea&s;on, nor Scripture, nor any Proof, but Part of the dead Traditions of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, for &s;uch a Thing.</P>
<P>THEN the Prie&s;t calls the Peo|ple to be Witne&s;&s;es how that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame Child is made a new Crea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, and that he is grafted into
<PB N="116" REF="002950_0066_0FE6A2372896F9D8">
the Body of the Church of Chri&s;t, and &s;o gives Thanks to God for the Child, that he is born again by the Holy Gho&s;t, and received to be his own Child by Adoption; and then they profe&s;s, that the Child from henceforth, is made a Member of Chri&s;t, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>BUT this is a great Work, if it were but done indeed, where there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for a Change, and Newne&s;s of Life: But this may be allow'd, <HI>to wit,</HI> that the Child at fir&s;t, is a Member of Chri&s;t, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven, and that he is yet no wor&s;e, nor in a State to be made better: But if neither the Peo|ple, nor the Prie&s;t know no better than the&s;e Things, the Lord enlight|en them.</P>
<P>BUT I do believe, there are ma|ny of them know, that all this is but the U&s;e, Cu&s;tom and Tradition

<P>WHAT then? Is not this Way of baptizing little Children not on|ly corrupt with the U&s;ing, but al&s;o formed in the Dark, and &s;et up af|ter the Commandments and Doct|rines of Men, and carried on in Will|Wor&s;hip, after the Ordinances and Rudiments of this World, and not after Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="002950_0067_0FE6A23744BA8A70">NOW therefore &s;hall we con&s;ider a little, what Nece&s;&s;ity there is for outward Water in the Bapti&s;m? But tho&s;e that are for <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m, they have Need of Water to dip the People; but as many as come to Chri&s;t to be baptized by him, he baptizeth with the Holy Gho&s;t: For the Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t is the Bap|ti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, which is the Sub&s;tance: but the Bapti&s;m of <HI>John (to wit,</HI> Water-Bapti&s;m) was the Figure or Shadow thereof.</P>
<P>BUT there are many in the&s;e Days that would tie the Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t and <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m together, and make them one Bapti&s;m, &s;ay|ing, the outward Water, which is the Shadow, is one Part, and the &s;piri|tual.

<P>BUT the wife Men hunting af|ter Opinions concerning the&s;e dead Things, and never could agree, be|cau&s;e they were Strangers to the Spirit and heavenly Life; They judge, that by receiving the Bread and Wine, they mu&s;t eat the Fle&s;h of Chri&s;t corporally, even he that was born of <HI>Mary,</HI> and &s;uffered up|on the Cro&s;s, and was rai&s;ed again, and a&s;cended into Heaven, to &s;it on the right Hand of Maje&s;ty.</P>

<P>THE Third Opinion is that of the <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> who deny both the the former, &s;aying, That Chri&s;t is not corporally in the Bread and Wine: But yet the Faithful receive him by taking of the Bread and Wine; But how, or which Way he is there, they know not, nor can they tell, but only we mu&s;t believe he is there, yet &s;o that it is properly in Heaven, [<HI>R.

it was not in the Meat that they found the Lord, but in their draw|ing near in their Spirits to his Spi|rit, and to one another in his Love.</P>
<P>THIS Way of Tradition was &s;oon corrupted in the U&s;e of it by Men, as may be &s;een in the Church of <HI>Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nth,</HI> where the Apo&s;tle com|plains again&s;t them, <HI>When they came together to eat that Supper which they called the Lord's Supper, in&s;tead of per|forming it unto the Lord in an accepta|ble Manner, they were in Danger of eating and drinking Damnation to them&s;elves,</HI> 1 Cor. xi 17, 29.</P>

<P>THE Me&s;&s;age which the Ser|vants of God received of him, and declared unto others, <HI>That God is Light, and in him is no Darkne&s;s at all;</HI> and the Work which God &s;et them upon, was, to <HI>turn Peo|ple from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God,</HI> even from the dark Kingdom, (where the Devil, the dark Spirit, doth govern) to the Kingdom of Light, whereof the Lord God is the Light, and to that City <HI>which hath no need of the

Sun, neither of the Moon to &s;hine in it, for the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof, and the Nations of them that are &s;a|ved &s;hall walk in the Light of it,</HI> Rev. xxi. 23, 24. <HI>The Sun &s;hall be no more thy Light by Day, neither for Bright|ne&s;s &s;hall the Moon give Light unto thee; but the Lord &s;hall be unto thee for an everla&s;ting Light, and thy God thy Glory,</HI> I&s;a. lx. 19.</P>
<P>THIS is the Work of the true Apo&s;tles, even to call People to God, who is Light, and hath enlightned every Man, and calls them to Chri&s;t who is the Light of Life; and this Light (which is the Father and the Son) hath lighted every Man that came into the World; <HI>And this is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men loved Dark|ne&s;s rather than Light, becau&s;e their Deeds were evil: For every one that doth Evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, le&s;t his Deeds
<PB N="191" REF="002950_0103_0FE6A2D5F52BD100">
&s;hould be reproved; but he that doth Truth, cometh to the Light, that his Deeds may be made manife&s;t that they are wrought in God,</HI> Joh. iii. 19, 20, 21.</P>
<P>SO they that hate the Light in them&s;elves, they hate God, becau&s;e he reproves them for their Sins; and where they love Darkne&s;s in them&s;elves, they love the Devil, who &s;peaks Peace to them, tho' they walk after their own Hearts Lu&s;ts. Thus the Mini&s;ters which God and Chri&s;t &s;end, are hated by the World, becau&s;e they &s;peak again&s;t Evil in Men. Therefore Je&s;us comforted his Di&s;ciples, &s;aying, <HI>If the World hate you, ye know it hated me before it hated you: If ye were of the World, the World would love his own; but becau&s;e ye are not of the World, but I have cho&s;en you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you,</HI> Joh. xv. 18, 19.</P>
<P>AND in as much as the World <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not receive, nor be plea&s;ed

with &s;uch Mini&s;ters as Chri&s;t &s;ent; therefore the World did and doth provide and accommodate them&s;elves with Mini&s;ters to their own Content, who will &s;ay what may plea&s;e them: So they, having itching Ears, heap unto them&s;elves Teachers, who will <HI>have their Per&s;ons in Admiration becau&s;e of Advantage,</HI> Jude 16. The World fitteth its Mini&s;ters by its own Spi|rit and Wi&s;dom, and, as <HI>John</HI> &s;aid, <HI>They are of the World, there&s;ore &s;peak they of the World, and the World heareth them. And as ye have heard that Antich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t &s;hall come, even now are there many Antichri&s;ts, whereby we know that it is the la&s;t Time: They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went out, that they might be made manife&s;t that they were not of us,</HI> 1 Joh. iv. 5. ii. 18, 19.</P>
<P>THESE are the fal&s;e Prophets of whom Chri&s;t &s;poke, that they

<P>SO Corruption grew among the Teachers of the Church: The Bi&s;h|ops came to be great and honoura|ble in the World; then went to co|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et after Reverence and Prehemi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ence, high Place, Authority and Dominion over the Church, and o|ver one another: Then great Gain and Riches mu&s;t be had to &s;upport them in Honour; al&s;o they mu&s;t learn in the Schools, Degrees, La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|guages and human Wi&s;dom, to fit them to be Mini&s;ter, in the Church.</P>

poor, illiterate and unlearned have been debarr'd from having any Share in the Mini&s;try: Then the Spirit of Je&s;us and his Authority was exclu|ded and &s;hut out of the Church; but humane Rule, Wi&s;dom and Honour, were &s;et up in&s;tead thereof, pre&s;um|ing Authority to make their Mini|&s;ters according to their own Wills and Way, &s;etting upon them the Riches and Glory of this World; then every one was to countenance his own Way, and to look after his Gain from his Quarter, and Place where it was ordered him. Lo here! &s;uch Watchmen as were of old Time, <HI>who were ignorant, yea, they were greedy Dogs which can never have e|nough, and they are Shepherds that cannot under&s;tand,</HI> I&s;a. lvi. 11.</P>

<P>THE &s;ame Complaint was by the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> again&s;t the Prophets of <HI>Jeru&s;alem, who &s;trength|ned the Hands of Evil-Doers, that none returned from their Wickedne&s;s: They &s;ay &s;till unto them that de&s;pi&s;e me, the Lord hath &s;aid, ye &s;hall have Peace; and they &s;ay unto every one that walketh after the Imagination of his own Heart, no Evil &s;hall come unto you; I have not &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt the&s;e Pro|phets, yet they ran.

<PB N="196" REF="002950_0106_0FE6A2D750635BB8">
then they &s;hould have turned them from their evil Way, and from the Evil of their Doings: And they cau&s;e my Peo|ple to err by their Lies, and by their Lightne&s;s; yet I &s;ent them not, nor commanded them; Therefore they &s;hall not profit this People at all, &s;aith the Lord,</HI> Jer. xxiii. 14, 17, 21, 22, 32. Al&s;o by the Prophet <HI>Micah, Thus &s;aith the Lord, concerning the Prophets that make my People err, that bite with their Teeth, and cry Peace, and he that putteth not into their Mouths, they even prepare War again&s;t him.

<P>AND in Truth, tho' there be fal&s;e Teachers in this latter Time that are decked with the Whore's Jewels, and altho' they hold the
<PB N="197" REF="002950_0106_0FE6A2D750635BB8">

<P>THIS covetous Spirit entered into the Hearts of &s;ome in the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> which cau&s;ed the Apo&s;tle to be &s;o &s;trict, that he would take
<PB N="198" REF="002950_0107_0FE6A313F9FA8780">
Nothing from any of them to an|&s;wer his Nece&s;&s;ities, le&s;t he &s;hould give them Occa&s;ion, as he te&s;tifies at large, how he had been in Want, whil&s;t he preached to them the Go&s;|pel of God freely, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xi. 9, 12, 13. And tho&s;e covetous Mini&s;ters he reckoned to be fal&s;e Apo&s;tles, deceit|ful Workers, being transformed into the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>AND of a Truth, great is the Difference between the Mini&s;try and Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and the Mini|&s;ters and Mini&s;try of Antichri&s;t; they are as unlike as Water is to Fire, or Light to Darkne&s;s: Chri&s;t called his Di&s;ciples from unlearned Men, and fitted them by his Grace and In&s;pi|ration; but Antichri&s;t mu&s;t have Scholars fitted with human Wi&s;dom. Chri&s;t communicated freely to them of his &s;piritual Goodne&s;s, commanding them to give as they had received free|ly; but the Mini&s;ters of Antichri&s;t receive not freely: it is great Pains
<PB N="199" REF="002950_0107_0FE6A313F9FA8780">
and Labour to them, and Expence of much Money; therefore it is co&s;t|ly to any that receive of them. The Me&s;&s;engers of God called People to Chri&s;t the Fountain of living Water, that they might drink of the Water of Life freely, and buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price: But the Merchants of <HI>Babylon</HI> call every Body to their Shops after this Manner, <HI>Come to us and buy, and if you do not buy, pay; and if you do not pay, we will make War again&s;t you.</HI> But the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, <HI>I have coveted no Mans Silver, or Gold, or Apparel: Yea, you your &s;elves know, that the&s;e Hands have mini&s;tred unto my Nece&s;&s;ity, and to them that were with me,</HI> Acts xx. 33, 34. But the&s;e Merchants are too great to work with their Hands: They will have Gold or Silver, Corn, Wool and Lambs, with Part of all the Increa&s;e of the People's Goods.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="002950_0108_0FE6A2E1B0194F08">THE Apo&s;tle &s;aid, <HI>a Nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon me to preach the Go&s;|pel, yea, Woe is unto me if I do it</HI> not: But there is no Nece&s;&s;ity upon the&s;e to preach any, but where they have the mo&s;t Wages. The Apo&s;tle did not bid them believe Men, but God; &s;aying, <HI>Do I &s;eek to plea&s;e Men? For if I plea&s;ed Men, I &s;hould not be the Servant of Chri&s;t,</HI> Gal. i. 10.

Again, the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>I certify you, Brethren, that the Go&s;|pel which was preached of me, is not after Man; for I neither received it of Man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> Ver. 11, 12. But the&s;e preach Doctrine (which they call Go&s;pel) after they receive it, and learn it of Men, and not by the Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for they deny &s;piritual Revelation in the&s;e Days.

of the World, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the Things that are freely given us of God: Which Things al&s;o we &s;peak, not in the Words which Man's Wi&s;dom teacheth, but which the Holy Gho&s;t teacheth,</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 12, 13.</P>

<P>INDEED the &s;piritual Purpo&s;es and Prophecies which God revealed to <HI>John</HI> (when he was in the Spi|rit on the Lord's Day) are in a great Mea&s;ure come to pa&s;s: The Church is coming up out of the Wilderne&s;s, and the Go&s;pel is freely preached in divers Countries, the &s;piritual Sun begins to &s;hine; and is not the One Thou&s;and two Hundred and Sixty Days fully expired &s;ince the Church fled into the Wilderne&s;s?

<P>BUT Men will &s;ay, we mu&s;t wor|&s;hip God in the Church; yet many are &s;o ignorant, that they know not what the Church is, nor where &s;he is; whereas the Church is the Peo|ple of God, who wor&s;hip in Spirit even in God, who dwelleth in his People, and makes them a Temple for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AND tho' there is but one Church, yet &s;he is in a two fold State in the outward: For the Woman that <HI>John</HI> &s;aw flying into the Wilderne&s;s from the Face of the Serpent, was the Church, which God feeds there.

<P>AND of a Truth, the Voice of this Angel hath reached to the utmo&s;t Part of the World; and there is a Witne&s;s in every Man that tells him, he &s;hould fear God and give him Glory; for his Judgment is within upon the Heart of the Sinner, by Rea&s;on of his Wickedne&s;s.

<P>BUT the Place and Time when the&s;e &s;hall come to know each other, and the Lord gather &s;ome of them to|gether to join in Wor&s;hip; the Wor|&s;hip is the &s;ame, and they in the &s;ame Spiritual Poverty do wor&s;hip. Yea, it is poor Wor&s;hip that God looks

upon: For <HI>ble&s;&s;ed are the Poor in Spi|rit, for there's is the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> Mat. v. 3.

<P>THIS Wor&s;hip is poor, becau&s;e the&s;e needy Ones have nothing de|&s;igned or prepared before-hand to &s;peak nor act, but wait near the Lord, for him to prepare them an Offering that will be acceptable in his Sight; for he hath promi&s;ed to give of his Spirit unto his People, and teach them him&s;elf, and to make manife&s;t unto them, what they &s;hall &s;ay and do.</P>
<P>AND here is the Difference be|tween the true Church, which Chri&s;t is the Head, Captain, and Prince of, and the idolatrous Churhes which

When they come together, every Thing is made ready: There is Plen|ty or Old Prayers to be read to fill the People's Ears, and which of them belong to be read this Day, and which to the next Day of Wor|&s;hip. And how little of the Scriptures is to be read on every Day or Wor|&s;hip? There is al&s;o a Sermon de|&s;igned, and by humane Wi&s;dom &s;et is Order before-hand; &s;o that they want nothing from the Lord; they have all Things ready; there is no|thing but going upon the Service, in their own Time, and in their own Will, and in their own Power, with|out waiting upon the Lord for Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance: nor for the Holy Spirit to refre&s;h and comfort them, and to be with them a Life and a Light, to lead them and guide them in their Service; for without the Light [that is Chri&s;t] we can do no|thing that is acceptable.</P>
