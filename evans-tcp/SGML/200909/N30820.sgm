<HEAD>An <HI>ACT</HI> for the better Ordering and Regulating &s;uch as are willing and de|&s;irous to be united for military Purpo&s;es within this Province.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_Whereas</HI> this Province was fir&s;t &s;ettled by, and a Majority of the A&s;&s;emblies have ever &s;ince been of, the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> who, though they do not, as the World is now circum&s;tanced, condemn the U&s;e of Arms in others, yet are principled again&s;t bearing Arms them&s;elves; and to make any Law to compel them thereto, again&s;t their Con&s;ciences, would not only be to violate a Fundamental in our Con&s;titution, and be a direct Breach of our Charter of Privileges, but would al&s;o, in Effect, be to commence Per&s;ecution again&s;t all that Part of the Inhabitants of the Province; and for them, by any Law, to compel others to bear Arms, and exempt them&s;elves, would be incon&s;i&s;tent and partial; yet, fora&s;|much as by the general Toleration, and Equity of our Laws, great Numbers of People of other religious Denominations are come among us, who are under no &s;uch Re&s;traint, &s;ome of whom have been di&s;ciplined in the Art of War, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly think it their Duty to fight in Defence of their Country, their Wives, their Families, and E&s;tates; and &s;uch have an equal Right to Liberty of Con&s;cience with others;</P>
<P><HI>And whereas</HI> a great Number of Petitions from the &s;everal Counties of this Pro|vince have been pre&s;ented to this Hou&s;e, &s;etting forth, That the Petitioners are very willing to defend them&s;elves and their Country, and de&s;irous of being formed into regular Bodies for that Purpo&s;e, in&s;tructed and di&s;ciplined under proper Officers with &s;uitable and legal Authority; repre&s;enting withal, that unle&s;s Mea&s;ures of this kind are taken, &s;o as to unite them together, &s;ubject them to due Command, and thereby give them Confidence in each other, they cannot a&s;&s;emble to oppo&s;e the Enemy, without the utmo&s;t Danger of expo&s;ing them&s;elves to Confu&s;ion and De&s;truction:</P>
<P><HI>And whereas</HI> the voluntary a&s;&s;embling of great Bodies of armed Men, from dif|ferent Parts of this Province, on any occa&s;ional Alarm, whether true or fal&s;e, as of
<PB N="2" REF="040861_0002_101910F596C19790">late hath happened, without Call or Authority from the Government, and without due Order and Direction among them&s;elves, may be attended with Danger to our neighbouring <HI>Indian</HI> Friends and Allies, as well as to the internal Peace of the Province:</P>
<P><HI>And whereas</HI> the Governor hath frequently recommended it to the A&s;&s;embly, that, in preparing and pa&s;&s;ing a Law for &s;uch Purpo&s;es, they &s;hould have a due Re|gard to &s;crupulous and tender Con&s;ciences; which cannot be done where compul&s;ive Means are u&s;ed to force Men into military Service:</P>
<P><HI>Therefore,</HI> as we repre&s;ent all the People of the Province, and are compo&s;ed of Mem|bers of different religious Per&s;ua&s;ions, we do not think it rea&s;onable that any &s;hould, thro' a Want of legal Powers, be in the lea&s;t re&s;trained from doing what they judge it their Duty to do for their own Security, and the Publick Good; We, in Compliance with the &s;aid Petitions and Recommendations, do offer it to the Governor to be <HI>Enacted; And be it Enacted</HI> by the Honourable <HI>Robert Hunter Morris,</HI> E&s;quire, with the KING's Royal Approbation, Lieutenant-Governor under the Honourable <HI>Thomas Penn</HI> and <HI>Richard Penn,</HI> E&s;quires, true and ab&s;olute Proprietors of the Province of <HI>Pen&s;ilvania,</HI> and of the Counties of <HI>Newca&s;tle, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> upon <HI>Delaware,</HI> by and with the Advice and Con&s;ent of the Repre&s;entatives of the Freemen of the &s;aid Province, in General A&s;&s;embly met, and by the Authority of the &s;ame, That, from and after the Publica|tion of this Act, it &s;hall and may be lawful for the Freemen of this Province to form them&s;elves into Companies, as heretofore they have u&s;ed in Time of War without Law; and for each Company, by Majority of Votes, in the Way of Ballot, to chu&s;e its own Officers; to wit, a Captain, Lieutenant, and En&s;ign, and pre&s;ent them to the Governor or Commander in Chief, for the Time being, for his Approbation; which Officers &s;o cho&s;en, if approved and commi&s;&s;ioned by him, &s;hall be the Captain, Lieutenant, and En&s;ign, of each Company re&s;pectively, according to their Commi&s;|&s;ions; and the &s;aid Companies being divided into Regiments by the Governor or Commander in Chief, it &s;hall and may be lawful for the Officers &s;o cho&s;en and com|mi&s;&s;ioned for the &s;everal Companies of each Regiment to meet together, and, by Majority of Votes, in the Way of Ballot, to chu&s;e a Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, and Major, for the Regiment, and pre&s;ent them to the Governor or Commander in Chief, for his Approbation; which Officers &s;o cho&s;en, if approved and commi&s;&s;ioned by him, &s;hall be the Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, and Major, of the Regiment, according to their Commi&s;&s;ions, during the Continuance of this Act.</P>

<P><HI>And be it further Enacted,</HI> by the Authority afore&s;aid, That, as &s;oon as the &s;aid Companies and Regiments are formed, and their Officers commi&s;&s;ioned, as afore|&s;aid, it &s;hall and may be lawful to and for the Governor or Commander in Chief, by and with the Advice and Con&s;ent of the Colonels, Lieutenant-Colonels, and Majors, of all the Regiments, being for that Purpo&s;e by him called and convened, or by and with the Advice and Con&s;ent of a Majority of the &s;aid Officers that &s;hall be met and pre&s;ent together on &s;uch Call, to form, make, and e&s;tabli&s;h, Articles of War, for the better Government of the Forces that &s;hall be under their Command, and for bringing Offenders again&s;t the &s;ame to Ju&s;tice; and to erect and con&s;titute Courts-Martial, with Power to hear, try, and determine, any Crimes or Offences by &s;uch Articles of War, and inflict Penalties, by Sentence or Judgment of the &s;ame, on tho&s;e who &s;hall be &s;ubject thereto, in any Place within this Province: Which Articles of War, when made, as afore&s;aid, &s;hall be printed and di&s;tributed to the Captains of the &s;everal Companies, and by them di&s;tinctly read to their re&s;pective Companies; and all and every Captain, Lieutenant, En&s;ign, or other Freeman, who &s;hall, after at lea&s;t Three
