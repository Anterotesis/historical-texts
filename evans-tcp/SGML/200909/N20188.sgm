<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the name fir&s;t came abroad into the world, many have been at a lo&s;s to know what a methodi&s;t is: what are the principles and the practice of tho&s;e, who are commonly called by that name; and what the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of this &s;ect, which is every where &s;poken again&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. And it being generally believed, that I was able to give the cleare&s;t account of the&s;e things (as having been one of the fir&s;t to whom that name was given, and the per&s;on by whom the re&s;t were &s;uppo&s;ed to be di|rected) I have been called upon, in all manner of ways, and with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, &s;o to do. I yield at la&s;t to the continued importunity both of friends and enemies; and do now give the cleare&s;t account I can, in the pre&s;ence of the Lord and Judge of heaven and earth, of the principles and practice whereby tho&s;e who are called methodi&s;ts, are di&s;tingui&s;hed from other men.</P>
<P N="3">3. I &s;ay tho&s;e who are called methodi&s;ts; for let it be well ob&s;erved, that this is not a name which they take to them&s;elves, but one fixt upon them by way of
<PB N="3" REF="026460_0003_0FD0512F154728A8">reproach, without their approbation or con&s;ent. It was fir&s;t given to three or four young men at Oxford, by a &s;tudent of Chri&s;t Church: either in allu&s;ion to the antient &s;ect of phy&s;icians &s;o called from their reaching, that almo&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es might be cured by &s;pecific me|thod of diet and exerci&s;e, or from their ob&s;erving a more regular method of &s;tudy and behaviour, than was u&s;ual with tho&s;e of their age and &s;tation.</P>
<P N="4">4. I &s;hould rejoice (&s;o little ambitions am I to be at the head of any &s;ect or party) if the very name might never be mentioned more, but be buried in eternal ob|livion. But if that cannot be, at lea&s;t let tho&s;e who will u&s;e it, know the meaning of the word they u&s;e. Let us not always be fighting in the dark. Come, and let us look one another in the face. And perhaps &s;ome of you who hate what I am called, may love what I am (by the grace of God:) or, rather what I follow after, if that I may apprehend that, for which al&s;o I am ap|prehended of Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>

<HEAD>The Character of a Methodi&s;t.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of a methodi&s;t are not his opinions of any &s;ort. His a&s;&s;enting to this or that &s;cheme of religion, his embracing any particu|lar &s;et of notions, his e&s;pou&s;ing the judgment of one man or of another, are all quite wide of the point. Who&s;oever therefore imagines, that a methodi&s;t is, a man of &s;uch or &s;uch an opinion is gro&s;sly ignorant of the whole affair, he mi&s;takes the truth totally. We believe indeed, that all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God; and herein we are di&s;tingui&s;hed from Jews, Turks, and Infidels. We believe the written word of God to be the only and &s;ufficient rule, both of chri&s;tian faith and practice; and herein we are fundamentally di&s;tingui&s;h|ed from tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h church. We believe Chri&s;t to be the eternal &s;upreme God, and herein are we di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Socinians and Arians. But as to all opinions which do not &s;trike at the root of chri&s;tianity, we think and let think. So that what&s;o|ever they are, whether right or wrong, they are no di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of a methodi&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither are words or phra&s;es of any &s;ort. We do not place our religion, or any part of it, in being attached to any peculiar mode of &s;peaking, any quaint or uncommon &s;et of expre&s;&s;ions. The mo&s;t obvious, ea&s;y, common words, wherein our meaning can be conveyed, we prefer before others, both ordinary occa&s;ions, and when we &s;peak of the things of God. We never therefore willingly or de&s;ignedly deviate from the mo&s;t u&s;ual way of &s;peaking; unle&s;s when we ex|pre&s;s &s;cripture truths, in &s;cripture words, (which we pre&s;ume no chri&s;tian will condemn) neither do we af|fect to u&s;e any particular expre&s;&s;ions of &s;cripture, more frequently than others, unle&s;s they are &s;uch as are frequently u&s;ed by the in&s;pired writers them&s;elves. So that it is as gro&s;s an error, to place the marks of a methodi&s;t in his words, as in opinions of any &s;ort.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="5" REF="026460_0005_0FD051318F5429F0">
3. Nor do we de&s;ire to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by actions, cu&s;toms, or u&s;ages, of an indifferent nature. Our re|ligion does not he in doing what God has not enjoined, or ab&s;taining from what he hath not forbidden. It does not lie in the form of our apparel, in the po&s;ture of our body, or the covering of our heads; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> ab&s;taining from marriage, nor from meats <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, which are all good if received with thank&s;giving. Therefore neither will any man who knows whereof he affirms, &s;ix the mark of a methodi&s;t here; in any actions or cu&s;toms purely indifferent, undetermined by the word of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nor, la&s;tly, is he to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by laying the whole &s;tre&s;s of religion on any &s;ingle part or it. If you &s;ay, "Yes, he is; for he thinks we are &s;aved by faith alone:" I an&s;wer, you do not under&s;tand the terms. By &s;alvation he means holine&s;s of heart and life. And this he affirms to &s;pring from true faith alone. Can even a nominal chri&s;tian deny it? Is this placing a part of religion for the whole? Do we then make void the law thro' faith? God forbid! Yea we e&s;tabli&s;h the law. We do not place the whole of reli|gion (as too many do, God knoweth) either in doing no harm or in doing good, or in u&s;ing the ordinances of God. No, nor in all of them together; wherein we know by experience a man may labour many years, and at the end have no true religion at all, no more than he had at the begining. Much le&s;s in any one of the&s;e; or, it may be in a &s;crap of one of them: like her who fancies her&s;elf a virtuous woman, only becau&s;e the is not a pro&s;titute; or him who dreams he is an hone&s;t man, merely becau&s;e he does not rob or &s;teal. May the Lord God of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;erve me, from &s;uch a poor, &s;tarved religion as this! were this the mark of a metho|di&s;t, I would &s;oones chu&s;e to be a &s;incere Jew, Turk, or Pagan.</P>
<P N="5">5. "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> then is the mark? Who is a methodi&s;t according to your own account?" I an&s;wer: A metho|di&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="026460_0006_0FD051330EEE47E8">is one, who has the love of God &s;hed abroad in his heart, by the Holy Gho&s;t given unto him: one who loves the Lord his God with all his heart, and with all his &s;oul, and with all his mind, and with all his &s;trength. God is the joy of his heart, and the de&s;ire of his &s;oul; which is con&s;tantly crying out, "Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ide thee! My God and my all! Thou art the &s;trength of my heart, and my portion for e|ver!"</P>
<P N="6">6. He is therefore happy in God, yea, always hap|py, as having in him a well of water, &s;pringing up in|to everla&s;ting life, and overflowing his &s;oul with peace and joy. Perfect love having now ca&s;t out fear, he re|joices evermore. He rejoices in the Lord always, even in God his Saviour: And in the Father, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom he hath now received the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">. Having found redemption through his blood, the forgivene&s;s of his &s;ins, he cannot but re|joice whenever he looks back on the horrible pit out of which he is delivered, when he &s;ees all his tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions blotted out as a cloud, and his iniquities as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">. He cannot but rejoice, whenever he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> on the &s;tate wherein he now is, being ju&s;tified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, and having peace with God, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For he that believeth hath the witne&s;s of this in him&s;elf: being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;on of God by faith: becau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;on. God hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> forth the &s;pirit of his &s;on unto his heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> out, Abba, Father! And the &s;pirit it&s;elf beareth witne&s;s with his &s;pirit, that he is a child of God. He rejoiceth al&s;o, whenever he looks forward, in hope of the glory that &s;hall be re|vealed: yea, his joy is full and all his bones cry out. Ble&s;&s;ed be the God and father of our Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten me again to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ving hope&mdash;of an inheri|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">led and that fadeth not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in heaven for me.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="7" REF="026460_0007_0FD0513493D4D010">
7. And he who hath this hope thus full of immor|tality, in every thing giveth thanks: as knowing that this (what&s;oever it is) is the will of God in Chri&s;t Je|&s;us concerning him. From him therefore he chear|fully receives all, &s;aying, Good is the will of the Lord: and whether the Lord giveth or taketh away, equally ble&s;&s;ing the name of the Lord. For he hath learned in what&s;oever &s;tate he is therewith to be con|tent. He knoweth both how to be aba&s;ed and how to abound. Every where and in all things he is in|&s;tructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to a|bound and &s;uffer need, whether in ea&s;e or pain, whe|ther in &s;ickne&s;s or health, whether in life or death, he giveth thanks from the ground of the heart to him who order it for good: Knowing that as every good gift cometh from above, &s;o none but good can come from the father of lights, into who&s;e hands he has wholly committed his body and &s;oul, as into the hands of a faitful creator. He is therefore careful (anxiou&s;|ly or unea&s;ily careful) for nothing: As having ca&s;t all his care on him that careth for him, and in all things re&s;ting on him, after making his reque&s;t known to him with thank&s;giving.</P>
<P N="8">8. For indeed he prays without cea&s;ing. It is giv|en him always to pray and not to faint. Not that he is always in the hou&s;e of prayer; though he neglects no opportunity of being there. Neither is he always on his knees, although he often is, or on his face, be|fore the Lord his God. Nor yet is he always crying aloud to God, or calling upon him in words. For ma|ny times the &s;pirit maketh interce&s;&s;ion for him with groans that cannot be uttered: but at all times the language of his heart is this, "Thou brightne&s;s of the eternal glory, unto thee is my mouth, though without a voice, and my &s;ilence &s;peaketh unto thee." And this is true prayer, the lifting up the heart to God. This is the e&s;&s;ence of prayer, and this alone. But his heart is ever lifted up to God, and at all times
<PB N="8" REF="026460_0008_0FD05136AE5B3000">and in all places. In this he is never hindered, much le&s;s interrupted by any per&s;on or thing. In retire|ment, on company, in lei&s;ure, bu&s;ine&s;s or conver&s;ation his heart is ever with the Lord. Whether he lie down or ri&s;e up, God is in all his thoughts; he walks with God continually, having the loving eye of his mind &s;till fixed upon him, and every where &s;eeing him that is invi&s;ible.</P>
<P N="9">9. And while he thus always exerci&s;es his love to God, by praying without cea&s;ing, rejoicing evermore, and in every thing giving thanks, this commandment is written in his heart, that he who loveth God, loves his brother al&s;o. And he accordingly loves his neigh|bour as him&s;elf; he loves every man as his own &s;oul. His heart is full of love to all mankind, to every child of the father of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h. That a man is not per&s;onally known to him is no bar to his love: No, nor that he is known to be &s;uch as he approves not, that he repays hatred for his good-will. For he loves his enemies, yea, and the enemies of God, the evil and the unthankful. And if it be not in his pow|er to do good to them that hate him, yet he cea&s;es not to pray for them, though they continue to &s;purn his love, and &s;till de&s;pitefully u&s;e him and per&s;ecute him.</P>
<P N="10">10. For he is pure in heart. The love of God has purified his heart from all revengeful pa&s;&s;ions, from envy, malice, and wrath; from every unkind temper or malign affection. It hath clean&s;ed him from pride and haughtine&s;s of &s;pirit, whereof alone cometh con|tention. And he hath now put on bowels of mer|cies, kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s, long-&s;uffering; &s;o that he forbears and forgives, if he had a quarrel again&s;t any; even as God in Chri&s;t hath forgiven him. And indeed all po&s;&s;ible ground for con|tention, on his part, is utterly cut off. For none can take from him what he de&s;ires; &s;eeing he loves not the world, nor any of the things of the world; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">|ing
<PB N="9" REF="026460_0009_0FD051378DDCF340">now crucified to the world, and the world crucifi|ed to him; being dead to all that is in the world, both to the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life. For all his de&s;ire is unto God, and to the remembrance of his name.</P>
<P N="11">11. Agreeable to this his one de&s;ire, is the one de|&s;ign of his life, namely, not to do his own will, but the will of him that &s;ent him. His one intention at all times and in all things is, not to plea&s;e him&s;elf, but him whom his &s;oul loveth. He has a &s;ingle eye. And becau&s;e his eye is &s;ingle, his whole body is full of light. Indeed where the loving eye of the &s;oul is continually fixed upon God, there can be no darkne&s;s at all, but the whole is light; as when the bright &s;hining of a candle doth enlighten the hou&s;e. God then reigns a|lone. All that is in the &s;oul is holine&s;s to the Lord. There is not a motion in his heart, but is according to his will. Every thought that ari&s;es points to him, and is in obedience to the law of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="12">12. And the tree is known by its fruits. For as he loves God, &s;o he keeps his commandments. Not only &s;ome, or mo&s;t of them, but all, from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t. He is not content to keep the whole law, and offend in one point; but has in all points, a con|&s;cience void of offence, towards God and towards man. Whatever God has forbidden, he avoids; whatever God hath enjoin'd he doth; and that whether it be lit|tle or great, hard or ea&s;y, joyous or grievous to the fle&s;h. He runs the ways of God's commandments, now he hath &s;et his heart at liberty. It is his glory &s;o to do; it is his daily crown of rejoycing, To do the will of God on earth, as it is done in heaven; knowing it is the highe&s;t privilege of the angels of God, of tho&s;e that excel in &s;trength, to fulfil his com|mandments and hearken to the voice of his word.</P>
<P N="13">13. All the commandments of God he accordingly keeps, and that with all his might. For his obedience is in proportion to his love, the &s;ource from whence it
<PB N="10" REF="026460_0010_0FD051390FC4A6D0">flows. And therefore, loving God with all his heart, he &s;erves him with all his &s;trength. He continually pre&s;ents his &s;oul and body, a living &s;acrifice, holy, ac|ceptable to God; entirely and without re&s;erve devo|ting him&s;elf, all he has, and all he is, to his glory. All the talents he has received, he con&s;tantly employs, ac|cording to his ma&s;ter's will; every power and faculty of his &s;oul, every member of his body. Once he yielded them unto &s;in and the devil, as in&s;truments of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; but now, being alive from the dead, he yields them all, as in&s;truments of righteou&s;ne&s;s un|to God.</P>
<P N="14">14. By con&s;equence, what&s;oever he doth, it is all to the glory of God. In all his employments of every kind, he not only aims at this, (which is implied in having a &s;ingle eye) but actually attains it. His bu|&s;ine&s;s and refre&s;hments as well as his prayers, all &s;erve to this great end. Whether he &s;it in his hou&s;e, or walk by the way, whether he lie down or ri&s;e up, he is promoting in all he &s;peaks or does, the one bu&s;ine&s;s of his life; whether he put on his apparel, or labour or eat and drink, or divert him&s;elf from too wa&s;ting la|bour, it all tends to advance the glory of God, by peace and good-will among men. His one invaria|ble rule is this, Whatever ye do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</P>
<P N="15">15. Nor do the cu&s;toms of the world at all hinder his running the race that is &s;et before him. He knows that vice does not lo&s;e it nature, though it becomes ever &s;o fa&s;hionable; and remembers, that every man is to give an account of him&s;elf to God. He cannot therefore, even follow a multitude to do evil. He can|not fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, or make provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof. He cannot lay up trea&s;ures upon earth, no more than he can take fire into his bo&s;om. He cannot adorn him&s;elf (on any pre|tence) with gold or co&s;tly apparel, he cannot join in,
<PB N="11" REF="026460_0011_0FD0513A8D7B5310">or countenance any diver&s;ion, which has the lea&s;t ten|dency to vice, of any kind. He cannot &s;peak evil of his neighbour no more than he can lie, either for God or man. He cannot utter an unkind word of any one; for love keeps the door of his lips. He cannot &s;peak idle words. No corrupt communication ever comes out of his mouth, as is all that which is not good, to the u&s;e of edifying, not fit to mini&s;ter grace to the hearers. But what&s;over things, are pure, what&s;over things are lovely, what&s;oever things are ju&s;tly of good report, he thinks and &s;peaks, and acts, adorning the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in all things.</P>
<P N="16">16. La&s;tly, as he has time, he does good unto all men; unto neighbours and &s;trangers, friends and ene|mies. And that in every po&s;&s;ible kind; not only to their bodies by feeding the hungry, cloathing the naked, vi|&s;itting tho&s;e that are &s;ick or in pri&s;on; but much more does he labour to do good to their &s;ouls, as of the abili|ty which God giveth: to awaken tho&s;e that &s;leep in death; to bring tho&s;e who are awakened to the aton|ing blood, that being ju&s;tified by faith, they may have peace with God, and to provoke tho&s;e who have peace with God, to abound more in love and in good works. And he is willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent herein, even to be offered up on the &s;acrifice and &s;ervice of their faith, &s;o they may all come unto the mea&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fullne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="17">17. The&s;e are the principles and practices of our &s;ect, the&s;e are the marks of a true methodi&s;t. By the&s;e alone do tho&s;e who are in deri&s;ion &s;o called, de|&s;ire to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from other men. If any man &s;ay "Why the&s;e are only the common, fundamental principles of chri&s;tianity!" Thou ha&s;t &s;aid; So I mean; this is the very truth; I know they are no other; and I would to God both thou&s;and all men knew, that I, and all who follow my judgment, do ve|hemently refu&s;e to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from other men, by any but the common principles of chri&s;tianity. The plain, old chri&s;tianity that I teach, renouncing and de|te&s;ting
<PB N="12" REF="026460_0012_0FD0513C0C0D1928">all other marks of di&s;tinction. And who&s;oever <HI>is</HI> that I <HI>preach</HI> (let him be called what he will; for names change not the nature of things) he is a chri&s;|tian not in name only, but in heart and in life. He has inwardly and outwardly conformed to the will of God, as revealed in the written word. He thinks &s;peaks, and lives according to the method laid down in the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. His &s;oul is renewed after the image of God, in righteou&s;ne&s;s and in all true holine&s;s. And having the mind that was in Chri&s;t he &s;o walks as Chri&s;t al&s;o walked.</P>
<P N="18">18. By the&s;e marks, by the&s;e fruits of a living faith do we labour to di&s;tingui&s;h our&s;elves from the unbelieving world, from all tho&s;e who&s;e minds or lives are not according to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. But from real chri&s;tians of what&s;oever denomination they be, we earne&s;tly de&s;ire not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed at all: Not from any, who &s;incerely follow after what they know they have not yet attained. No: who&s;oever doth the will of my Father which is in heaven, the &s;ame is my brother, and &s;i&s;ter and mother. And I be&s;eech you brethren, by the mercies of God, that we be in no wi&s;e divided among our&s;elves. Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thine? I a&s;k no farther que&s;tion. If it be, give me thy hand. For opinions or terms, let us not de&s;troy the work of God. Do&s;t thou love and &s;erve God! it is enough. I give thee the right-hand of fellow&s;hip. If there be any con&s;olation in Chri&s;t, if any comfort of love, if any fellow&s;hip of the &s;pirit, if any bowels and mercies. Let us &s;trive together for the faith of the go&s;pel; walking worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called; with all lowline&s;s and meekne&s;s, with long-&s;uffering, forbear|ing one another in love, and endeavouring to keep the unity of the &s;pirit, in the bond of peace: remem|bring, there is one body and one &s;pirit, even as we are called with one hope of our calling: One Lord, one faith, one bapti&s;m; One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all!</P>
