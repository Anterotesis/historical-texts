<P N="1">1. <HI>The honour done him in his burial: They buried him in the City of David among the Kings:</HI> A &s;ingular honour this, that he &s;hould make his grave with the Princes and &s;upream Ru|lers of his People. <HI>David,</HI> when he was &s;et|tled in his Kingdom, took from the <HI>Jebu&s;ites,</HI> the &s;trong hold of <HI>Zion,</HI> and call'd it after his own name; made it the place of his Re&s;i|dence, and the Seat of his Kingdom; in &s;ome part of which he was interr'd at his decea&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>King.</HI> 2.10. <HI>So David &s;lept with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David;</HI> which afterward became the burying place of the Kings: for this is the account generally given concerning the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> that they &s;lept with their fathers, and were buried <HI>in the City of David:</HI> And this was the honour done to <HI>Jehoiada</HI> when he died; they buried him in this City, and laid him among the Kings: an honour denied to &s;ome of the Kings, who had by their mi&s;managements, forfeited the Re|gards due to their Character: It is Reported of <HI>Jehoram,</HI> that he departed without being de&s;ired: <HI>howbeit they buried him in the City of David, but not in the Sepulchres</HI> of the Kings,

<P><HI>That honour and re&s;pect is due, and ought to be paid, to the Remains and Memory of &s;uch as have been eminently Serviceable, and done much good among their People.</HI></P>
<P>Such are rich ble&s;&s;ings while they live, and tho&s;e whom God is plea&s;ed to honour, by furni&s;hing of them, making them Eminent, and

<P>Honour is due to all men on account of the Dignity of human nature, becau&s;e man was made in the Image of God, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.17. <HI>Ho|nour all men.</HI> A greater degree of honour is due unto r&egrave;ligious, holy and vertous men; and by how much the more they excel in pie|ty, and &s;hine in vertue, by &s;o much the grea|ter Regard is due unto them, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 15.4. <HI>He honoureth them that fear the Lord.</HI> But more e&s;pecial honour &s;till is due to them, who are placed on high, and bear Offices of di&s;tinction among Mankind, according to the degree of improvement and exaltation which they are advanced to, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.17. <HI>Honour the King.;</HI> and the greate&s;t honour is due to them who are eminently Serviceable, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. <HI>Let the El|ders which rule well, be accounted worthy of dou|ble honour, e&s;pecially they who labour</HI> (more a|bundantly, and exert them&s;elves) <HI>in the word and doctrine;</HI> neither doth the obligation here|unto cea&s;e, when their breath goeth forth; but honour is due to their remains and memo|ry, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16.13, 14. <HI>And A&s;a &s;lept with his fathers, and they made a very great burning for him.</HI> This Doctrine may be con&s;idered in two Propo&s;itions.</P>

PROP. I. <HI>Some men are eminently Servicea|ble, and do much good among their People.</HI></P>
<P>There is not a greater diver&s;ity and contra|riety in the World of things, than there is in the World of men. Some things are very hurtful and de&s;tructive to the nature of man, as the poi&s;on of A&s;ps; &s;ome things are of the middle kind, and do neither good nor hurt; &s;ome are &s;alubrious and very &s;erviceable, nou|ri&s;hing, &s;trengthening, re&s;torative, and com|fortable.</P>
<P>So among <HI>men,</HI> &s;ome are very hurtful and pernicious, tyrannical and oppre&s;&s;ive, deceit|ful and unrighteous, turbulent and unpeacea|ble, vicious and debauch'd; they are of little benefit to mankind, while they live; nor is it any lo&s;s to the world, when they die. They &s;eem to be &s;ent in Judgment, and are ta|ken away in mercy; not to them&s;elves, but to mankind. Others are as the Twilight, in the middle between good and evil, u&s;eful, and pernicious; they have a being upon the earth; but none are much oblig'd to them, neither have we any great complaint to advance a|gain&s;t them, they &s;erve to &s;well the number of mankind, and this is well nigh all; that they are harmle&s;s &amp; inoffen&s;ive fini&s;heth their Character.</P>
<P>Others exceed in their u&s;efulne&s;s, and are rich Ble&s;&s;ings in their day. God doth well furni&s;h them, and well &s;pirit them: and they are as the light of the morning, even a morn|ing without Clouds, and as a clear &s;hining af|ter Rain: They expand their Beneficence as
<PB N="6" REF="003379_0008_0FF8217A879B9220">the rays of light, and men in every Order, Condition and Degree are the better for 'em; all men e&s;teem and love them; becau&s;e all men, at one time or other, are oblig'd and &s;erv'd by them, and when cruel death doth forcibly take them away, all hearts are oppre&s;t with &s;orrow, and all eyes are full of tears, and are ready to look upon it, that a great part of their comfort is buried in the &s;ame grave. Such were <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Jeho&s;haphat,</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> among the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> and almo&s;t in every ge|neration God. rai&s;eth up, and be&s;tows &s;ome &s;uch men.</P>
<P>We may expatiate a little and illu&s;trate this in &s;ome in&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some do much good with their E&s;tates.</HI> The God from whom doth come Riches, as well as Honour, doth honour them, in making 'em his <HI>Stewards</HI> of much worldly &s;ub&s;tance, and with all doth give them an heart to do good with their abundance: They are of a publick Spirit, and when there is opportunity, they di&s;cover a laudable genero&s;ity and openne&s;s of hand: It doth not &s;uffice them to give to e|every man his due, and to owe no man any thing but love; and to pay without grudging (which many do not) what the Support of the Publick doth require: but more|over, they devi&s;e liberal things, and by libe|ral things they &s;tand; and are of the &s;ame publick and generous &s;pirit with the Centuri|on well re&s;pected among the <HI>Jews,</HI> becau&s;e he loved their Nation, and built them a Syna|gogue,

<P>They are al&s;o good to the poor; are touch|ed with a &s;en&s;e of their indigencies, and <HI>ef|fectively</HI> pity them: they don't eat their mor|&s;el alone; and when they &s;ee the poor with|out covering, they cau&s;e their loins to ble&s;s them: becau&s;e they make them warm with the fleece of their &s;heep, and the ble&s;&s;ing of &s;uch as were ready to peri&s;h doth come upon them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Some do great and good Service in the pub|lick Stations, which they are exalted into.</HI> Pro|vidence doth call them forth from a private to a publick Capacity, having antecedently fitted and qualified them therefor; and they do worthily, and become famous, in the wi&s;e and faithful attendance to, and di&s;charge of the Tru&s;t, which they have received from God by men. If it be a civil Office which they &s;u&s;tain, that they bear Rule over men, they are ju&s;t and rule in the fear of the Lord: when they &s;it upon the &s;eat of Ju&s;tice, they take heed what they do; becau&s;e they account, and con&s;ider that they judge not for men, but for God. <Q><HI>That the power of judgment is God's Right, that the matter of Judgment is God's Cau&s;e,
<PB N="8" REF="003379_0010_0FF8217E38AEA690">and that the i&s;&s;ue of Judgment is God's end;</HI></Q> and de&s;ire nothing more than that God would be with them in the Judgment; they are watch|ful over them&s;elves, that they be impartial, and do not decline after many to wre&s;t Judgment; nor countenance a poor man in his cau&s;e; nor favour the great and the Rich, becau&s;e they are &s;o; neither do they bear the Sword in vain; but by the prudent execution of ju&s;t Laws, they become <HI>a terror to them that do evil;</HI> and if the Sons of vice, and in&s;olence will not otherwi&s;e be reclaimed, they u&s;e a ju&s;t &s;everity, and bring <HI>the wheel over the wic|ked;</HI> nor are they le&s;s con&s;cientious as to Re|ligion and the Precepts of the fir&s;t Table; they are a &s;wift witne&s;s again&s;t the Prophane. again&s;t vain Swearers, Sabbath-breakers, and &s;uch as dare boldly affront the Maje&s;ty of Heaven; and they &s;peak comfortably to tho&s;e that teach the good knowledge of the Lord.</P>
<P>They are indued with wi&s;dom, and a &s;pirit of Government, and by the application of their Wi&s;dom and Power, they keep all in peace and good order about them; they defend the Righteous, and protect the Innocent, and e|very one &s;ets under his own vine, and under his own fig-tree, &s;ocure in his ju&s;t Rights, and enjoying the fruits of his own labours.</P>
<P>In like manner &s;ome in the &s;acred Imploy|ment, do eminent Service for Chri&s;t, his Truth, and the Souls of men, and <HI>are the Chariots of I&s;rael, and the Hor&s;emen thereof:</HI> and others, who move in a lower &s;phere of publick Order,

<P N="3">3. <HI>Some do great and good &s;ervice by their coun&s;el and advice.</HI> God gives unto them a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding heart, and they are well inclined to do good with their Talents. The Publick is much the better for that ex|cellent Spirit of wi&s;dom which is in them: when Emergencies ari&s;e; and dark clouds hang over the publick Affairs, they have a compre|hen&s;ive di&s;cerning in the pre&s;ent juncture; and by their wi&s;dom do direct unto that which doth extricate from the impending dif|ficulties, and make all of a right &s;pirit to re|joyce in the happy i&s;&s;ue, <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 9.15. <HI>And he by his wi&s;dom delivered the City.</HI> They al&s;o do much good by their Coun&s;el and Advice more privately: their ability is known, and their integrity depended upon; they are much &s;ought unto, and many appeal to them, as judges and arbiters of right and wrong, and by their wi&s;dom and integrity, intitle them|&s;elves to the ble&s;&s;ing of the Peace-maker.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Some do much good by their Example.</HI> They live a religious and exemplary life, worthy of imitation; and by their example have a good influence upon others. They are exemplary in their Families, walking in the mid&s;t of their hou&s;es in a perfect way; and hereby they have a good influence upon tho&s;e that are under them, who in&s;en&s;ibly fall into imitati|on, and grow up into a likene&s;s and conformi|ty to Parents: They are patterns in their re|gards

<P>Sometimes one &s;uch man will cau&s;e all things to go well in a place, and make a people hap|py; will change the countenance of all Affairs among them, and bring all things into &s;weet and excellent order; will rectifie di&s;orders, and meliorate the manners of a people, that &s;tran|gers, who come among them, &s;hall ob&s;erve and &s;ay, that there is much of a Reformation among them: one &s;uch man is &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing, as few are &s;en&s;ible of 'till deprivation doth convince them.</P>

<P N="1">I. As to the fir&s;t, <HI>&s;ome of the ways in which ho|nour and re&s;pect ought to be paid unto &s;uch,</HI> are the&s;e which follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By a &s;uitable and honourable Burial.</HI> It is a practice, which hath obtain'd in the world, when per&s;ons die, to return back their Bodies, earth to earth as it was; and the light of rea|&s;on hath guided mo&s;t, if not all nations, to pay &s;ome re&s;pect to per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction &amp; Cha|racter, by &s;ome peculiar <HI>rites</HI> and <HI>ceremonies</HI> in their <HI>Ob&s;equies;</HI> and it's decent that &s;uch &s;hould be honour'd in their Interment, according to the decent rites and cu&s;toms, which have ob|tain'd among their people.</P>
<P>Different modes of doing honour to the Ho|nourable, have obtain'd in different Times and Countries. Among us we give honour to &s;uch, by Titles of Di&s;tinction, by uncovering of the
<PB N="13" REF="003379_0015_0FF821AA41F70958">head, by ri&s;ing up before them, by bowing of the knee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it is equal and ju&s;t that men of worth and improvement, have re&s;pect &s;hewn them in &s;uch ways as are cu&s;tomary; and not to do it, is neglect and contempt; &s;o likewi&s;e when they decea&s;e, honour'd they &s;hou'd be in their burial. Thus they honour'd <HI>Jehoiada,</HI> by laying him among the Kings; and it was a cu&s;tom in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to do honour to men of worth, by making odoriferous burnings for them. It is &s;aid concerning the good King <HI>A&s;a,</HI> that <HI>when he died they made a very great burning for him,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16.14. and not to do this, was a token of neglect and di&s;re&s;pect; for it is &s;aid of that wicked King <HI>Jehoram,</HI> who departed without being de&s;ired, <HI>that his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 21.19.</P>
<P>This burning of &s;weet odours, was a &s;ignifi|cation of re&s;pect, and an emblem of a good reputation, that they gladly were at co&s;t to manife&s;t their Regards to &s;uch a worthy per|&s;on, and that his name was &s;weet, &amp; as oint|ment poured forth, which gives a delightful &s;en&s;ation to all that are near; and this may probably, let us into a right under&s;tanding of the wi&s;e man, <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 7.1. <HI>A good name is bet|ter than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of ones birth:</HI> for when a man comes to die, it is better and more elegible, to leave a good name and reputation behind him, than to be honour'd with a great burning of &s;weet odours and co&s;tly perfumes.</P>

<P N="2">II. As to the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> of the Doctrine, we may offer as followeth.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Not that it is any benefit to them who are departed.</HI> What we do in this World hath no influence, as to tho&s;e who are departed into the world of &s;pirits. Manife&s;ting e&s;teem &amp; regard
<PB N="19" REF="003379_0021_0FF862E6E8DCF000">may be of advantage to &s;uch, when alive; may be an encouragement to them in their duty and work; may be a quickning to them to exert them&s;elves, that they may be more abundantly &s;erviceable: and doubtle&s;s, it is &s;ometimes of &s;ervice to publick men, to know that their &s;er|vice is well accepted, and that they have an intere&s;t in the e&s;teem of their people, when they are well ballanced, and have grace to make a right improvement of it; but the doing honour to their name is of no &s;ervice directly to them who are departed. The great &amp; good departed, need not any farther &s;ervice of ours; they hear not our commendations; they are exalted above our prai&s;es; neither can our <HI>enco|miums</HI> augment their beatitude.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is in it &s;elf ju&s;t and right.</HI> There is a certain dependance of things one upon another, and references and relations of things one unto another, which is the foundation of ju&s;t and right. Such a being as man, a creature endow|ed with &s;uch powers, &s;ituate in &s;uch relation to, and dependance upon, the only uncreated and eternal mind, it is in it &s;elf ju&s;t and right, that he &s;hould think of, be affected and act toward God according to <HI>his</HI> nature and perfections; and his own relation to, and dependance upon Him: and &s;uch is the relation of men one un|to another, as that it is in it &s;elf ju&s;t &amp; right, that every man &s;hould enjoy what is his own, his life, reputation, worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, without infringement or mole&s;tation; &s;o it is in its &s;elf ju&s;t and right, that re&s;pect &s;hould be paid to

<P N="3">3. <HI>It may be profitable to the Living:</HI> And by means of the living, the dead may yet &s;peak, and be an occa&s;ion of good after they are laid in their graves.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It may be &s;ome &s;upport and comfort to be|reaved and mourning Relations.</HI> It mu&s;t needs be &s;ome alleviation of their grief, and lightning of their burden, to find that their dear rela|tive, whom death hath &s;eparated from them, had a good intere&s;t in the e&s;teem and love of others; and to ob&s;erve that many do feelingly condole in their lo&s;s and &s;orrow.</P>

<P>This will procure us an honourable remem|brance when we are gone, and give us a name in &s;ome re&s;pects better than the name of Sons and of Daughters; will give us a la&s;ting name that &s;hall not &s;oon be cut off; and thus

He cho&s;e out our way and &s;at chief, and was one that comforted the mourners,</HI> Job 29. 21, 22, 23, 25.</P>
<P>Neither may I omit to Recognize &s;ome &s;pecial vertues, in which he did &s;hine with a particular lu&s;tre. He was courteous and very obliging to all, and had a particular &s;weetne&s;s of Conver&s;ation: his riches and exaltation did not render him offen&s;ively a&s;&s;uming, but gave him the opportunity of recommending him&s;elf
<PB N="28" REF="003379_0030_0FF82193830E12F0">&s;o much the more by his affability and con|de&s;centions; he was as free from &s;ourne&s;s and moro&s;ity, as almo&s;t any man living; natural|ly di&s;po&s;ed to an innocent and moderate plea|&s;antne&s;s; and yet had a particular skill in commanding reverence from all that convers'd with him.</P>
<P>He was pitiful and compa&s;&s;ionate to his fel|low creatures in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and troubles, and always ready as well as able to help them; often hath he delivered the needy, when they came to him, the poor al&s;o and him that had none to help him. How often and how glad|ly hath he a&s;&s;i&s;ted the fatherle&s;s, and made the widow's heart to &s;ing for joy: <HI>He put on righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and it clothed him, his judgment was a robe and a diadem, he was eyes to the blind, and feet was he to the lame; he was a father to the poor, and the cau&s;e which he knew not, he &s;earch|ed out, he brake the jaws of the wicked, and pluckt the &s;poil out of their teeth.</HI></P>
<P>He was of a peaceable and quiet &s;pirit, and watchful and diligent in maintaining and pre|&s;erving peace and quietne&s;s among his neigh|bours, and among his people: he had a parti|cular greatne&s;s of &s;oul, and was of a right publick &s;pirit; and as God ble&s;&s;ed him with a plentiful E&s;tate, &s;o he gave him an heart to do good with the &s;ame; for he was truly ge|nerous, as he made manife&s;t on all inviting oc|ca&s;ions; liberal both in publick contributions and donations, as al&s;o in private charities be|yond what the world knew any thing of.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003379_0031_0FF821B9E3BC50C0">
Amiable al&s;o he appears if we view him in every relation; a dutiful Son, very re&s;pectful to his aged Parents, neither of which have been many, and one of which hath not been two years dead; a mo&s;t kind and loving Hu&s;|band; a wi&s;e and a tender Father; a good Neighbour; a fa&s;t Friend; a faithful Repro|ver; Mini&s;terial; a hearty Lover of his Coun|try, and of all good men.</P>
<P>In Religion, he was &s;ound in the faith, care|ful and con&s;cientious in the practi&s;e, as well as in the profe&s;&s;ion of it: he was not a talka|tive, but a real Chri&s;tian: never admired the noi&s;e, but always the thing: great was his regard to the hou&s;e of God, and very exempla|ry in a con&s;tancy, &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s, and reve|rence of attending upon the publick Wor&s;hip: in le&s;&s;er and controverted points, he was of a moderate and charitable &s;pirit, and was mainly concerned for the great things of God's law, mercy, judgment and faith: to practi&s;e them him&s;elf, and to promote them in others. His conver&s;ation, was pure, and blamele&s;s, and un&s;tain'd from his youth up: and I am per&s;waded that he acted under the governing influence of the fear of God, and a &s;incere aim to honour and plea&s;e him in the conduct of him&s;elf, both in a publick and a private capacity; and as he vi&s;ibly liv'd the Chri&s;ti|an, &s;o he had the advantage thereof in his la&s;t hours; patient, re&s;ign'd, and &s;upport|ed by a comfortable hope: his tho'ts and his &s;peech were much of Religion, and the things
<PB N="30" REF="003379_0032_0FF8219669DD3960">of another world: and among other &s;avoury expre&s;&s;ions, he &s;aid, <Q>He hop'd God would not gather his Soul with Sinners, when he &s;hould die; for he had not lov'd their com|pany, when living, and that above all pla|ces he had lov'd the habitation of God's hou&s;e, and the place where his honour dwel|leth.</Q> And &s;ome of the la&s;t words which I ever heard him &s;peak, at the conclu&s;ion of &s;ome religious di&s;cour&s;e, were, <Q>That after all he could venture him&s;elf upon the Go&s;pel way of acceptance and Salvation.</Q> And the &s;en|tence of charity is, that he is gone to the <HI>Hades</HI> of the ble&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P N="2">2. To the people of this Town: Men, Bre|thren, and Fathers, I account it an honour to this place, that God hath rais'd up &s;uch a man in it: We have enjoy'd a rich ble&s;&s;ing in him; he hath been the in&s;trument of much good a|mong us; the &s;ober and well di&s;po&s;ed a|mong us, have for a number of years &s;at under the &s;hadow of his conduct and ad|mini&s;tration with great &s;atisfaction; and how heartily could we have rejoyced, might he have been continued many years more to do &s;ervice among us, according to the largene&s;s of his ability, and excellency of his di&s;po&s;iti|on; but the Supream over all hath determi|ned and ordered otherwi&s;e, and it is now <HI>with us a day of darkne&s;s and gloomine&s;s, a day of clouds and of thick darkne&s;s, as the morn|ing &s;pread upon the mountains, for our breach is great like the Sea, who can heal us?</HI></P>
<P>And &s;ince it is &s;uch a day of rebuke and di&s;|plea&s;ure, what &s;hould we do but con&s;ider &s;eri|ou&s;ly, and humble our &s;elves before God; &s;earch our hearts, and try our ways, and turn
