<P>JESUS ANSWERED THEM, MANY GOOD WORKS HAVE I SHEWED YOU FROM MY FATHER; FOR WHICH OF THOSE WORKS DO YE STONE ME?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE benevolence, as well as the power and wi&s;dom of the Deity, is con&s;picuous in all his works; but e&s;pecially in his proceedings with his intelligent, though degenerate offspring in this part of his dominions. Here it &s;hines with &s;uch lu&s;tre, as to be viewed with admiration by the angels in heaven. God hath not left him&s;elf without witne&s;s in any age or coun|try, in that he did the inhabitants good, not only giving them rain from heaven and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling their hearts with food and gladne&s;s; but affording them ad|vantages, in a greater or le&s;s degree, to &s;eek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him and find him. In many periods indeed, and in many parts of the world, the peo|ple &s;at in darkne&s;s, and in the region of the &s;hadow of death; while to a few others a light &s;prung up &s;u&s;&s;icient to guide their feet into the way of peace. The chri&s;tian|ized world, mo&s;t certainly, can &s;ay, that God hath given them all things pertaining both to life and godline&s;s: for <HI>God, who, at &s;undry times and in divers manners, &s;pake in time pa&s;t unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in the&s;e la&s;t days &s;poken unto us by his Son,</HI> concerning <HI>the great &s;alva|tion; and that which at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God al&s;o bearing them witne&s;s, both with &s;igns and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, according to his own will.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="030426_0003_0FE6D16B7B503FF8">
But I am not to a&s;&s;ume the que&s;tion that is to be di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed, nor take for granted the point to be proved. The general &s;ubject which claims my attention on this occa&s;ion according to the direction of the pious Founder of this Lecture, being REVEALED RELIGION, it is ju&s;tly expected that I endeavour to adduce &s;ome arguments in &s;upport of Divine Revelation; at lea&s;t, that I collect and prepare &s;ome materials, which may contribute to the &s;trength of the great fabrick of Chri&s;tianity; or rather, point out to view the &s;olid firmne&s;s of tho&s;e everla&s;ting pillars upon which this noble edifice is e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>That a &s;y&s;tem of doctrines and precepts, under the denomination of the Chri&s;tian Religion, has been intro|duced, and now exi&s;ts in the world, is without contro|ver&s;y: for it is equally the butt of &s;neering unbelievers, and the boa&s;t of its profe&s;&s;ors; a &s;tone of &s;tumbling, and a rock of offence to the former; but a corner-&s;tone of hope and joy to the latter. It is almo&s;t univer&s;ally acknowledged too, that this religion derived its name and its origin from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom his followers be|lieved to be the true Me&s;&s;iah; but whom the Jews in&s;ult|ed as a deceiver, and crucified as a malefactor; who&s;e memory and who&s;e oracles are &s;till &s;acred in the e&s;teem of Chri&s;tians; but treated with the greate&s;t indignity by modern unbelievers.</P>
<P>Now the great que&s;tion re&s;pecting Chri&s;tianity, is this, Is it from Heaven, or of men? and concerning its Foun|der and propagators, Were they actuated by a <HI>lying &s;pirit,</HI> or did they &s;peak as if they were <HI>moved by the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and act, as if <HI>endued with power from on high?</HI></P>
<P>In order to the full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this que&s;tion, it may be thought nece&s;&s;ary to examine minutely the intrin&s;ick excellency of this religion, in its doctrines, duties, and profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign; its external &s;upports, in the fulfilment of prophecies and the exhibition of miracles; the char|acter of its author, and of his commi&s;&s;ioned apo&s;tles; its progre&s;s and e&s;tabli&s;hment in the world; and the credi|bility of the hi&s;tories and books, which contain this re|ligion, and tran&s;mit an account of its author and fir&s;t propagators. But this opens an exten&s;ive field. On the&s;e heads many volumes have already been written.
<PB N="5" REF="030426_0004_0FE6D16B8B124E08">It is impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, that the limits of one &s;ermon &s;hould contain the principal part of tho&s;e arguments, ar|ranged in their connected and corroborating order, by which the belief of Chri&s;tians is &s;upported, and the cavils of infidels refuted. A di&s;cour&s;e of an hour, under my management, may tire the patience of the audience, but not do ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject. Something however mu&s;t be attempted.</P>
<P>If we take a view of Chri&s;tianity as forming a complete &s;y&s;tem of religion, adapted to the nature, and adequate to the exigencies of mankind, it appears to be a <HI>work</HI> of &s;uch magnitude, and a <HI>good</HI> of &s;uch importance, as no abilities of man could ever excogitate or effect.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tly to apprehend the worth of a benefit, we mu&s;t con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ities of tho&s;e upon whom it is confer|red, and its &s;uitablene&s;s to an&s;wer tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ities. Ex|amining the &s;y&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity by the&s;e marks, we &s;hall find it fully to an&s;wer the demand.</P>
<P>It needs not the labour of argument to prove, that all fle&s;h had early corrupted their ways, and become guilty before God. The malady, which was caught by our fir&s;t parents in Eden, &s;pread from father to &s;on; and from one generation to another grew more inveterate and alarming. In matters of religion, the whole head was &s;ick, and the whole heart faint. The heathen nations <HI>became vain in their imaginations, and their fooli&s;h heart was darkened. Profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be wi&s;e, they became fools; and changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed bea&s;ts, and creeping things.</HI> The di&s;ea&s;e was univer&s;ally felt, and in &s;ome in&s;tances lamented: but who could in|ve&s;tigate a remedy? The wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of the ancient philo&s;ophers, from a mournful &s;en&s;e of the prevailing de|bility, could only wi&s;h and hope for an able re&s;torer. Wi&s;e as &s;ome of them confe&s;&s;edly were, the world by their wi&s;dom knew not God, nor the way to approach him with confidence, nor to &s;erve him with propriety. They were not fully per&s;uaded of the immortality of the foul; much le&s;s that all would hereafter be judged and recompen&s;ed according to their works. They felt not therefore the powers of the world to come; 'nor did
<PB N="6" REF="030426_0005_0FE6D16CF5374698">they perceive in tho&s;e rules of virtue, which they were able to di&s;cover, the authority of a divine legi&s;lator, or of an impartial judge.' They knew not of an advocate to intercede in their behalf with their offended &s;overeign. They knew not of a divine illuminator and &s;anctifier to help their infirmities, to aid their endeavours, and to complete their re&s;toration. To men in &s;uch circum|&s;tances, how welcome, how every way &s;uitable, would the plan of recovery by Chri&s;t be, as it is delineated and propounded in the Bible? a plan, which provides for all their moral wants through time, and for their complete happine&s;s through eternity. The wi&s;dom of its con&s;truc|tion mu&s;t excite their admiration; its &s;uitablene&s;s and mo&s;t benevolent tendency mu&s;t recommend it to their joyful acceptance; as well as the atte&s;tations by which it is &s;upported, claim their cordial belief.</P>
<P>To decide the que&s;tion whether the powers of the hu|man mind are adequate to the ta&s;k of informing the un|der&s;tanding, regulating the pa&s;&s;ions, and directing the conduct, in all the exerci&s;es of religious wor&s;hip, and in all the practices of moral duty, let us inquire what the&s;e boa&s;ted powers have accompli&s;hed, without the aid of revelation. Much indeed have they accompli&s;hed, and to great heights have they attained, in &s;cientifick re|&s;earches, and in the improvement of the u&s;eful, and of the refined arts. But what have they effected in the &s;ci|ence of theology; in the nece&s;&s;ary art of getting rid of the guilt and dominion of &s;in; and of a&s;&s;uring men's hearts before God, with re&s;pect to their future well-being? In what book but the Bible, or tho&s;e which de|rive their origin from the Bible, can we find a &s;cheme of divinity, worthy of the great Fir&s;t Cau&s;e; or a rational &s;y&s;tem of moral duties, fuited to all ranks, capacities and fituations, enforced by proper &s;anctions, and encouraged by adequate a&s;&s;i&s;tances, and eternal rewards? In this view, can it appear credible, can it appear po&s;&s;ible, to any unprejudiced mind, that the go&s;pel plan, &s;o comprehen|&s;ive, and yet &s;o con&s;i&s;tent, and which unfolds &s;uch a&s;ton|i&s;hing my&s;teries, and &s;uch &s;ublime and intere&s;ting doc|trines, can owe its origin, its e&s;tabli&s;hment, its mo&s;t hap|py influence, to the unin&s;pired genius, or the una&s;&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="7" REF="030426_0006_0FE6D16D08423260">powers of man; much more, of an impo&s;tor &s;peaking in the name of the Lord, when the Lord &s;pake not by him? In this ca&s;e he could not be a good man: but certainly, none but a good being can be the author of a &s;cheme, which not only proclaims, but promotes, both in a direct and con&s;equential manner, <HI>glory to God in the highe&s;t, peace on earth, and good will towards men.</HI> Such is the profundity of the plan, &s;o complicated and yet &s;o regular, that we might on this account give credit to the apo&s;tle Peter's a&s;&s;ertion, that <HI>even the angels de&s;ired to pry into it;</HI> and to the apo&s;tle Paul's, <HI>I certify you, brethren, that the go&s;pel, which was preached of me, is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> In the &s;ame &s;pirit of devout a&s;toni&s;hment, which St. Paul expre&s;&s;ed on another occa|&s;ion, mu&s;t we exclaim, <HI>O the depth of the riches both of the wi&s;dom and the knowledge of God! how un&s;earchable are his judgments, and his ways pa&s;t finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his coun&s;ellor? Or who hath fir&s;t given unto him, and it &s;hall be recompen&s;ed unto him again? For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to whom be glory forever. Amen.</HI> The au|thor of &s;uch a &s;cheme mu&s;t have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite wi&s;dom, infinite comprehen&s;ion, and infinite benevolence. This great and a&s;toni&s;hing <HI>work,</HI> this complication of benefits, <HI>bath the Son of God &s;hewed us from his Father.</HI></P>
<P>The go&s;pel is evidently a remedial in&s;titution. The de|clared, the apparent, and the experienced de&s;ign of it, is to recover the race of men from depravity and guilt, in a way, which reflects the greate&s;t honour on the charac|ter and authority of a righteous and univer&s;al Sovereign, and which is mo&s;t admirably &s;uited to the rational and immortal, though corrupted and debilitated nature of the creatures to be recovered. However deficient every other plan of re&s;toration, and every effort of human in|genuity is, <HI>we are complete in him, who is the head of all principalities and powers, and in whom are hid all the trea&s;|ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>"If we contemplate the go&s;pel by it&s;elf," &s;ays a ma&s;|terly writer on this &s;ubject,
<NOTE PLACE="foot">* WHITE.</NOTE> "and view it in its own
<PB N="8" REF="030426_0007_0FE6D1772A912BC8">light, we &s;hall have abundant rea&s;on to admire it, both for the purity of its nature, and the tendency which it has to promote the intere&s;ts and the happine&s;s of man|kind. It bears on it the &s;tamp of a divine original; and there is a &s;pirit which animates and beautifies it, that mu&s;t &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the pious mind in its favour. The purity of the go&s;pel is indeed a deci&s;ive evidence whence it proceeded; an evidence ever pre&s;ent, ev|er legible; and which no di&s;tance, whether of time or of place, can efface. That purity is &s;uch as we &s;hould nat|urally expect from the &s;entiments which uncorrupted na|ture leads us to form of the Divine Being. If he had not already vouch&s;afed to grant us a revelation of his will, with re&s;pect to our duty both to him and to one an|other; yet if we had rea&s;on to expect that he would grant it, the cleare&s;t dictates of our judgment, and the noble&s;t &s;entiments of our heart, would lead us to anticipate the &s;ame di&s;play of benevolence on the part of God, and the &s;ame encouragements to virtue among men, which we find in the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>"As it is pure, &s;o it is perfect. Whatever is nece&s;|&s;ary for us to know, is di&s;covered by it; and di&s;covered in &s;uch a manner as to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of a reve|lation de&s;igned for general information. In the go&s;pel we have nothing &s;uperfluous, nothing perplexing. Every declaration of &s;in and duty; every promi&s;e to engage us to pur&s;ue the one, and every threatening to deter from the other, are brought forward with a preci&s;ion and &s;im|plicity, which leave no room either for the perver&s;e to cavil, or the impartial to mi&s;take. There is no vice which it does not detect, even within the darke&s;t retreats of the mind. There is no duty connected with the glory of God, the welfare of our neighbour, or the true hap|pine&s;s of our&s;elves, but what it unfolds and illu&s;trates. Its precepts are not only clear in their mode of delivery, and beneficial in their tendency; but they are enforced by every motive that is calculated to affect the heart, and to exalt and purify its affections. The promi&s;e of divine forgivene&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion through Je&s;us; of help and &s;uccour through the Divine Spirit, are of the mo&s;t &s;ooth|ing and engaging nature, to beings encompa&s;&s;ed with dif|ficulties
<PB N="9" REF="030426_0008_0FE6D17735F33FB0">of various kinds, and expo&s;ed to moral weak|ne&s;&s;es and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, which are degrading to our na|ture, and de&s;tructive of our happine&s;s. But to in&s;pire us with the full &s;oul of virtue and religion, it carries our a&s;|piring minds beyond the contracted views of this mortal &s;cene, to that exalted world of &s;pirits, where we &s;hall ever be advancing in knowledge and perfection, where every offence &s;incerely repented of &s;hall be pardoned, and every virtuous endeavour accepted and rewarded by him, who is our mo&s;t compa&s;tionate father, as well as our mo&s;t righteous judge."</P>
<P>To &s;trengthen our belief that this religion is divine, let us view the character of its Founder. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of illu&s;trious prophecies, from Adam to Malachi, re|&s;pecting the Me&s;&s;iah, who was to be a light to the Gen|tiles, and the glory of his people I&s;rael, were fulfilled in Je&s;us Chri&s;t;&mdash;fulfilled in the time, place, and other cir|cum&s;tances of his birth; in the &s;ufferings as well as pu|rity of his life; in many circum&s;tances relative to his death, burial, and re&s;urrection; and in the &s;alutary de|&s;ign, and wonderful efficacy of his doctrines. As he was <HI>the holy child Je&s;us,</HI> &s;o it appears from his hi&s;tory that in after life <HI>he knew no &s;in,</HI> and <HI>fulfilled all righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> He had no faulty defects to &s;ully his character, but every virtue and grace to adorn it. Into whatever cities or villages, concour&s;es or retirements, we trace the foot&s;teps of Chri&s;t, we &s;hall di&s;cover in him the mo&s;t con|&s;ummate prudence and piety; the mo&s;t exalted and &s;teady regard to the honour and laws of God; and the mo&s;t warm and di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence to mankind. In &s;hort, as Dr. Doddridge ob&s;erves, "We &s;ee in him every thing amiable, every thing venerable. We &s;ee a perfection of goodne&s;s no where el&s;e in the world to be &s;een or heard; and numberle&s;s arguments plead at once to per&s;uade the heart, that it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch a PERSON &s;hould be engaged in a de&s;ign founded in known fal&s;ehood, and tending only to mi&s;lead and ruin his followers."</P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t al&s;o, in the cour&s;e of his active and u&s;eful life, performed many miraculous works, as atte&s;tations of his divine mi&s;&s;ion. His miracles, being performed with
<PB N="10" REF="030426_0009_0FE6D1784B65ADC8">a benevolent de&s;ign, might well be called <HI>good works which he &s;hewed from his Father.</HI> Whoever acknowledges a God, mu&s;t at lea&s;t admit the po&s;&s;ibility of a miracle. The Framer of the great machine of nature, and of the laws by which it is directed, may, con&s;i&s;tently with his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, &s;u&s;pend tho&s;e laws in any given in&s;tance, or increa&s;e their energy. He who has all pow|er, and all hearts in his hands, may perform miracles im|mediately by him&s;elf, or mediately by other agents; in either ca&s;e, the great ends of religion are equally &s;ecured, and the proofs of his interpo&s;ition equally apparent.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t from many pa&s;&s;ages in the New Te&s;ta|ment, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t con&s;idered the evidence ari&s;ing from the mighty works which he wrought, as abundantly &s;ufficient to &s;upport his claims to the Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip. <HI>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not: but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works.</HI> As there mu&s;t always be a perfect con&s;i&s;tency between the attributes, the nature and the proceedings, of an all-perfect being, it is certain that &s;uch a being would not have affixed the &s;anction of miracles to the cau&s;e in which our Saviour was engaged, had that cau&s;e been an impo&s;ture. The &s;ame &s;pirit of power which was given to our Lord with|out mea&s;ure, was communicated to his apo&s;tles in a de|gree &s;ufficient to enable them al&s;o to work miracles, as an evidence of the truth of their mi&s;&s;ion and doctrines. The&s;e miracles, too, both of our Saviour and of his apo&s;|tles, were &s;o numerous, &s;o beneficial, and performed &s;o openly, in the view of &s;uch multitudes, as to be &s;ufficient|ly &s;creened from the imputation of fraud and collu&s;ion, or of a fortunate and accidental concurrence of &s;econd cau&s;es. "They were too public to be the artifices of impo&s;ture; too &s;ub&s;tantial, and too numerous, to afford the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion of unde&s;igned and fortuitous coin|cidence." In a word, as the afore&s;aid author
<NOTE PLACE="foot">* WHITE.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, "&s;hould the Divine Being in any in&s;tance &s;o far coun|teract the common laws of nature as to produce a mira|cle; and &s;hould de&s;ign that miracle as a monument to future times of the truth of any particular doctrine, we cannot conceive any mode of communicating it more
<PB N="11" REF="030426_0010_0FE6D178584CA848">effectual than that which he hath cho&s;en. Stronger proofs could not be afforded con&s;i&s;tently with the de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, which is not to overpower our under&s;tand|ings, by an irre&s;i&s;tible and compul&s;ory light, but to af|ford us &s;uch rational evidence as is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy moral inquirers, who are endowed with faculties to per|ceive the truth; but at the &s;ame time who have power totally to re&s;i&s;t it, and finally to forfeit its ble&s;&s;ings."</P>
<P>On the whole then, when we contemplate the char|acter of Chri&s;t as delineated with admirable &s;implicity by his &s;acred biographers; when we view him in the whole cour&s;e of his publick mini&s;try going about doing good, healing all manner of di&s;ea&s;es, ca&s;ting out devils, in&s;truct|ing the ignorant, and comforting the &s;orrowful; e&s;pe|cially when we con&s;ider the benevolent de&s;ign of his mi&s;&s;ion, and that he actually devoted his life as a ran&s;om for &s;inners; it gives a penetrating edge to the inquiry in my text, <HI>Many good works have I &s;hewed you from my Fa|ther; for which of tho&s;e works do ye &s;tone me?</HI> The &s;ame interrogation and appeal may his friends and followers make in behalf of his cau&s;e, and of the records of his life and doctrines; "Many good works are therein di&s;|played from the Father; many advantages communicat|ed to the world in general; many un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ings, temporal and eternal, to individuals; for which of tho&s;e works, tho&s;e immen&s;e advantages, tho&s;e invaluable ble&s;&s;|ings, is the cau&s;e rejected and vilified? For which of the doctrines, of the prophecies, of the promi&s;es, is the Bible ridiculed, and &s;purned through all the filth of the &s;treets?"</P>
<P>But as the Jews an&s;wered the Saviour, &s;o modern un|believers reply now; "<HI>For a good work we &s;tone thee not; but for bla&s;phemy, and becau&s;e that thou, being a man, make&s;t thy&s;elf God.</HI> And as the Founder of the Chri&s;tian &s;cheme was an impo&s;tor, &s;o the &s;cheme it&s;elf is a forgery. The &s;acred books, as they are called, are not authentick. They were not written by tho&s;e who&s;e names they bear; and the &s;tory they tell is fabulous, and de&s;erves no credit."</P>
<P>In vindication of him&s;elf from the charge of bla&s;phe|my, and in proof of his commi&s;&s;ion from the Father, our Lord, as we have &s;een, appealed to the miracles which
<PB N="12" REF="030426_0011_0FE6D18036D4AAB8">he wrought, as &s;ufficient to carry conviction to every unprejudiced mind. To prophecies al&s;o, as well as to miracles, both Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles frequently appeal|ed, as proofs of their divine mi&s;&s;ion. We may add too, that as 'our Saviour referred to his mighty works as evidences of his power, &s;o he referred to the intrin&s;ick excellency and purity of the doctrines they were intend|ed to bear witne&s;s to, as an evidence that the power was of God.' In this manner, and to this day, do the ex|ternal and internal proofs of Chri&s;tianity mutually illu|minate and corroborate each other. The contempora|ries of Chri&s;t had the evidence of their &s;en&s;es that he performed miracles. We, though &s;o di&s;tant in time and place, have the evidence of credible te&s;timony, that not only he, but his apo&s;tles in his name, performed them too; and that his religion &s;pread and got footing in the world, in &s;o &s;peedy and wonderful a manner, as demon|&s;trated that the cau&s;e was of God.</P>
<P>That we have not followed cunningly devi&s;ed fables; but that we have the mo&s;t &s;olid foundation for our faith and hope in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, we argue in this manner; "The facts recorded of our Saviour were recorded by tho&s;e who mu&s;t know whether they were true or fal&s;e. The per&s;ons who recorded them, were under no po&s;&s;ible temptations to deceive the world. We can only account for their conduct on the &s;uppo&s;ition of their mo&s;t perfect conviction and di&s;intere&s;ted zeal. That they &s;hould a&s;|&s;ert what they knew to be fal&s;e; that they &s;hould publi&s;h it with &s;o much ardor; that they &s;hould ri&s;k every thing dear to humanity, in order to maintain it; and at la&s;t &s;ubmit to death in order to atte&s;t their per&s;ua&s;ion of its truth, in tho&s;e moments when impo&s;ture u&s;ually drops its ma&s;k, and enthu&s;ia&s;m lo&s;es its confidence; that they &s;hould act thus in oppo&s;ition to every dictate of common &s;en&s;e and every principle of common hone&s;ty, every re|&s;traint of &s;hame, and every impul&s;e of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; is a phenomenon not le&s;s irreconcileable to the moral &s;tate of things, than miracles are to the natural con&s;titution of the world."</P>
<P>We may add too, that the writings, in which the afore|mentioned facts are recorded and conveyed to us, have
<PB N="13" REF="030426_0012_0FE6D1804690FFF0">all the marks of genuine &s;implicity, and an impartial regard to truth that can be rea&s;onably de&s;ired; and they can be clearly traced from the age in which they were written, and the facts were &s;aid to be done, through the &s;ucceeding ages down to our own times. This is not mere a&s;&s;ertion without proof. A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of writers, both Jewi&s;h and Pagan, from the times of the apo&s;tles, to the times of the reformation, incidentally mention the &s;ame facts which are recorded in the New Te&s;tament, viz. that "the Chri&s;tian religion originated from one Je&s;us; that the founder was put to death as a malefac|tor at Jeru&s;alem, by the authority of the Roman gover|nor, Pontius Pilate; that the religion neverthele&s;s &s;pread in that city and throughout Judea; and that it was prop|agated from thence to di&s;tant countries; that the con|verts were numerous; that they &s;uffered great hard&s;hips and injuries for their profe&s;&s;ion; and that all this took place in the age of the world which our books have a&s;|&s;igned. They go on farther to de&s;cribe the <HI>manners</HI> of Chri&s;tians in terms perfectly conformable to the accounts extant in our books." See for in&s;tance the writings of Tacitus, Suetonius, Pliny, and Jo&s;ephus; or if the direct te&s;timony of Jo&s;ephus be di&s;puted, it mu&s;t be granted that he gives no counter evidence; the &s;ilence therefore of &s;uch a writer in &s;uch an age, is rather in favour of the truth of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>But further, it is ob&s;ervable, that 'the whole &s;eries of Chri&s;tian writers, from the fir&s;t age of its in&s;titution down to the pre&s;ent, in their di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, apologies, argu|ments, and controver&s;ies, proceed upon the general &s;tory which our &s;criptures contain, and upon no other. The main facts, the principal agents are alike in all. Clem|ent, who heard St. Paul preach; Polycarp the di&s;ciple of St. John; Ignatius a contemporary with Polycarp; Quadratus of the &s;ame age with Ignatius; Ju&s;tin Mar|tyr, who flouri&s;hed little more than thirty years after Quadratus, have more or le&s;s reference to the life, the tran&s;actions, the crucifixion, the re&s;urrection, and the a&s;cen&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and give accounts of the&s;e things corre&s;ponding with the accounts which we have in the four go&s;pels, and in the Acts of the apo&s;tles.'
<PB N="14" REF="030426_0013_0FE6D182DB874590">In &s;ucceeding ages Chri&s;tian writers have &s;till more fre|quent references to the leading facts recorded in the go&s;pel hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>It is to be remarked too, that we have the te&s;ti|mony of enemies as well as of friends, to the au|thenticity of the hi&s;torical books of the New Te&s;tament. "The notice taken of the contents of the&s;e books by the early writers again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, &s;hows that the accounts which Chri&s;tians had then, were the accounts which we have now; that we have the &s;ame &s;criptures which they had. It &s;hews moreover that neither Cel&s;us in the &s;ec|ond, Porphyry in the third, nor Julian in the fourth century, &s;u&s;pected the authenticity of the&s;e books, or ever in&s;inuated that Chri&s;tians were mi&s;taken in the au|thors to whom they a&s;cribed them. Not one of them expre&s;&s;ed an opinion upon this &s;ubject different from that which was held by Chri&s;tians. And when we con|&s;ider how much it would have availed them to have ca&s;t a doubt upon this point, if they could; and how ready they &s;hewed them&s;elves to be to take every advantage in their power; and that they were all men of learning and inquiry; their conce&s;&s;ion, or rather their &s;uffrage, upon the &s;ubject, is extremely valuable."

<P>A late popular and zealous defender of "the rights of man," has with equal zeal &s;tepped forth the champion of infidelity; oppo&s;ed the claims of the Redeemer, and di&s;turbed the peace of his &s;ubjects. This daring in&s;ur|gent has mu&s;tered and &s;et in array a ho&s;t of popular ob|jections again&s;t the Bible, the citadel of revealed relig|ion. But upon examination it appears, that this formi|dable phalanx con&s;i&s;ts principally of the apparitions of tho&s;e armed forces which Cel&s;us, Spinoza, and other &s;ucceeding leaders in the infidel Rebellion, brought into the field for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but which were &s;lain by the &s;word of the Spirit wielded by the hands of Origen and innumerable other &s;ucce&s;sful e&s;pou&s;ers of the Chri&s;|tian cau&s;e. Had this doughty hero po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as much mode&s;ty as boldne&s;s, and as much candor as wit; had he, like a ju&s;t critick and philo&s;opher, exerci&s;ed as great judgment and impartiality in &s;earching out truth, as he
<PB N="15" REF="030426_0014_0FE6D182E82D85C0">did acutene&s;s and prejudice in &s;pying out and magnify|ing faults; he would not have con&s;idered "a few chro|nological, geographical, or genealogical errors&mdash;appar|ent mi&s;takes, or real incon&s;i&s;tencies as to hi&s;torical facts, &mdash;needle&s;s repetitions and trifling interpolations," &s;uffi|cient to invalidate the genuinene&s;s or authenticity of the &s;acred writings; but giving the &s;ame credit to the authors of the re&s;pective books of the Old and New Te&s;tament which he gives to other hi&s;torians, he would be &s;o far from rejecting the Bible with contempt, that he would &s;urrender him&s;elf a captive to its &s;uperior &s;trength and authority. Yea, if the aforementioned qualities of the mind would permit him to demand &s;tronger evidence for the authenticity of the &s;criptures than for that of any other books, in the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e qualities he would find &s;tronger. But as the&s;e qualities were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him, or were not in exerci&s;e, he manife&s;ts great prejudice and &s;pite again&s;t the go&s;pel and tho&s;e who are &s;et for its defence, and great unfairne&s;s in his repre&s;enta|tions and arguments. He rejects almo&s;t all the books of the Bible, from Gene&s;is to the Revelation, becau&s;e he thinks he can prove from certain &s;mall pa&s;&s;ages, or circum&s;tances, in tho&s;e books, that they were not writ|ten by tho&s;e to whom they have generally been attribut|ed. Whereas, if this were really the ca&s;e, their authen|ticity might remain; they might &s;till contain a true ac|count of real tran&s;actions, though the names of the writ|ers of them &s;hould be found to be different from what they are generally e&s;teemed to be.&mdash;But my limits will not permit me to examine and refute his &s;everal objec|tions. This is ably done by a worthy prelate, who&s;e "Apology for the Bible" does honour both to his head and his heart.</P>
<P>Should the Students of this Univer&s;ity be prompted by curio&s;ity (I hope they will not by an evil heart of unbelief) to read the bold attacks of Thomas Paine upon the authenticity of that book which Chri&s;tians e&s;teem &s;acred; I take the liberty to recommend as ready a pe|ru&s;al of an an&s;wer by the Bi&s;hop of Landaff. Here you will &s;ee the Bible defended, and the Chri&s;tian Religion &s;upported, by a decided &s;uperiority both of argument
<PB N="16" REF="030426_0015_0FE6D0E8AA3E4520">and temper. I had almo&s;t &s;aid, that the &s;triking con|tra&s;t between the di&s;po&s;ition of one, who, from early con|viction of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, had &s;pent his life un|der the refining and ennobling influence of its divine maxims,&mdash;and of one, who had long been a contemner and bla&s;phemer, is a &s;ufficient refutation of Paine's prin|ciples, and vindication of the New Te&s;tament; it cer|tainly demon&s;trates the divine excellency of the doctrines, morals, and motives pointed out by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights of man, is a freedom of inquiry. This right I would by no means infringe. But &s;uffer me to &s;ay, that if you wi&s;h for &s;pecimens and examples of the mo&s;t indefatigable and exten&s;ive re&s;earch, of the mo&s;t profound erudition and of the greate&s;t &s;trength and fairne&s;s of argumentation, you will not &s;tudy dei&s;tical, in <HI>preference</HI> to Chri&s;tian writers. In Hume, or in Gib|bon, you may be caught by &s;ubtilty, or captivated by the fa&s;cination of language. But the&s;e writers have by no means an exclu&s;ive claim to elegance and refinement; certainly not to clearne&s;s and &s;trength of rea&s;oning, and fairne&s;s of repre&s;entation. In a White, a Paley, and a War&s;on, be&s;ides innumerable others, you will find con|clu&s;ive argument, and &s;olid in&s;truction. In the peru&s;al of the&s;e you will perceive your under&s;tanding enlightened and enlarged, without being mi&s;led; your heart com|forted and e&s;tabli&s;hed, without being corrupted; and your nature exalted almo&s;t to angelick, without enthu&s;i|a&s;m. If you would be unhinged in your principles; &s;et loo&s;e from all religious re&s;traints, and from the controll|ing influence of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;h|ments; if you would check the energies of the &s;oul after perfection, and abandon all hope upon a plan of grace, let the &s;coffers at Chri&s;tianity be the men of your coun|&s;el. But if you wi&s;h to become proficients in mi&s;repre|&s;entation, in buffoonery, in &s;currilous abu&s;e of the be&s;t characters among men, in profanene&s;s again&s;t the &s;crip|tures, and in bla&s;phemy again&s;t God, read "The Age of Rea&s;on." But, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed is the man that walketh not in the coun|&s;el of the ungodly, nor &s;tandeth in the way of &s;inners, nor &s;itteth in the &s;eat of the &s;cornful. But who delighteth in the law of the Lord, and meditateth therein day and night.</HI></P>

<P>Among the many pernicious importations from abroad, we may reckon, as none of the lea&s;t, infidel and athei&s;ti|cal books, and libertine characters. Tho&s;e, who have long di&s;turbed the peace of believers, and endeavoured to turn the chri&s;tianized and the enlightened world up|&s;ide down, are come hither al&s;o. To counteract the
<PB N="18" REF="030426_0017_0FE6D18C66F144D0">deadly poi&s;on of their influence, we ought not to depend wholly upon the &s;pecifick antidotes which are ready pre|pared, and brought to our hand; but while we grate|fully accept and make u&s;e of the&s;e, we &s;hould endeavour to acquire the &s;kill of preparing other remedies of equal efficacy, though compo&s;ed of the &s;ame e&s;&s;ential ingredi|ents. For it is to be remembered, that truth, like its great Author, is <HI>the &s;ame, ye&s;terday, to-day, and forever;</HI> and the &s;ub&s;tantial arguments in &s;upport of Chri&s;tianity, like <HI>the Father of Lights,</HI> are <HI>without variablene&s;s or &s;hadow of change.</HI> Important in this view is the Dudleian In&s;ti|tution; which may &s;erve as a laboratory, or armoury, where tho&s;e weapons may be formed and burni&s;hed, by which to defend the religion of Je&s;us, and the rights of Chri&s;tians. The&s;e weapons have hitherto been proof again&s;t every a&s;&s;ailant in every attack, in whatever new mode the opponents might u&s;e their own armour, or bring on the a&s;&s;ault. The adver&s;aries of Chri&s;tianity, like the &s;ervants of the king of Syria, &s;eem to &s;ay upon every defeat, <HI>Their gods are gods of the hills, therefore they were &s;tronger than we; let us fight again&s;t them in the plain, and &s;urely we &s;hall overcome them.</HI> They have accordingly &s;hifted their ground, and renewed the encounter, in a &s;omewhat different manner. But &s;till without &s;ucce&s;s. For, "great is the truth, and it will prevail." Greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the world. Their heavie&s;t artillery of argument has been overpowered, and the thicke&s;t flights of their envenomed arrows have been broken, or retorted on them&s;elves. The Chri&s;tian cau&s;e ever has been, and ever will be, under the patron|age of the Almighty. The weapons of its defenders are mighty through God. No weapon, therefore, formed again&s;t it &s;hall pro&s;per.</P>
<P>How a&s;toni&s;hing is the ingratitude of mankind! Some of the greate&s;t benefactors to the world, have met with the cruelle&s;t requitals. Many, of whom the world was not worthy, have been &s;toned, have been &s;awn a&s;under, have been &s;lain with the &s;word. The Son of God him|&s;elf, who brought grace and truth from heaven, and who lived and died for the redemption of men, was in&s;ulted, &s;pit upon, buffeted, crowned with thorns, and crucified between two thieves: and even to this day there are
<PB N="19" REF="030426_0018_0FE6D18C7243B8B8">tho&s;e who join with his betrayers and murderers, and cry, <HI>Crucify him, crucify him;</HI> and who tread under foot the go&s;pel, and the blood of the Son of God. While we &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed at the daring bla&s;phemy of &s;ome of the enemies of Chri&s;t and of his religion, let us, his pro|fe&s;&s;ed friends, revere and &s;erve him with the greater a&s;&s;iduity; and cultivate the &s;pirit of our Ma&s;ter, who prayed for his murderers when nailing him to the cro&s;s, <HI>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P>How much rea&s;on have we to venerate the &s;criptures, and to glory in our religion, notwith&s;tanding the con|tempt that is ca&s;t upon them by men of corrupt minds, who&s;e words eat as doth a canker! The doctrines of revelation have &s;tood the te&s;t of the &s;evere&s;t &s;crutiny, and of the foule&s;t reproach. When they have been tried they have come forth as gold. The &s;uperior and forci|ble evidences of the truth of Chri&s;tianity, have carried conviction to the minds of &s;ome of the greate&s;t geniu&s;&s;es, and mo&s;t learned &s;cholars; and the lu&s;tre and divine excellence of its doctrines and morals, have captivated the hearts of multitudes, among who&s;e names it would be an honour to have ours enrolled. The apo&s;tle Paul, with all his erudition and eloquence, even in the polite and learned cities of Athens and Rome, was &s;o far from being a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel, that he accounted every thing el&s;e as lo&s;s, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us his Lord. That which rather gains &s;trength by the manly trial of rea&s;on, can never be weakened by the in&s;olence of ridicule. In&s;tead therefore of being aba&s;hed at the &s;coffs of abandoned infidels, let us glory in the undimini&s;hed &s;trength of our cau&s;e, in the &s;ucce&s;s of its e&s;pou&s;ers, and in the honours and triumphs of its Founder. While &s;neering unbelievers are lifting the re&s;tored hand to &s;mite their healer; are employing their recovered &s;ight to extingui&s;h the light by which they &s;ee; and are requiting with death the purcha&s;er of im|mortal life, let us adhere with the greater ardor to our Redeemer, and hold fa&s;t the confidence of our hope firm unto the end. "<HI>Lord, to whom &s;hall we go? Thou ha&s;t the words of eternal life. And we believe and are &s;ure that Thou art that Chri&s;t, the Son of the living God.</HI>"</P>
