<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I AM very &s;en&s;ible, that the Subject of the en&s;uing Treati&s;e, is none of the mo&s;t accep|table in this Age, wherein we are &s;o much degenerated and apo&s;tatized from the true Doctrines and Principles of the Reformation: Yet being convinced, that it is not only a Doctrine of Truth, but al&s;o a Truth of great Importance in the Chri&s;tian Sy&s;tem, I am willing to appear for the Defence of it, what&s;oever Di&s;-e&s;teem or Reproach it may expo&s;e me to, from &s;uch as cannot bear to &s;ee or hear it main|tain'd with any Moderation of Temper. It is a Doctrine with which &s;undry other Doctrines of the Scripture are &s;o in&s;eparably connected, that they cannot, with any Con|&s;i&s;tency, be maintained without it; &s;uch as, <HI>Original Sin,</HI> the <HI>utter Impotency,</HI> or rather <HI>&s;trong Aver&s;ion of the human Will to true Holine&s;s,</HI> the <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible Efficacy of Converting Grace, Free Ju&s;tification by the im|puted Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t alone,</HI> and the <HI>final Per|&s;everance of the Saints.</HI> It is therefore a fooli&s;h Que&s;tion which &s;ome a&s;k, <HI>What need is there for preaching up this Doctrine, or meddling with it?</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tand up for it, again&s;t the Tide of Oppo&s;ition, for the Sake of all the&s;e other Doctrines of God's Word, which mu&s;t &s;tand or fall with it. It is nece&s;&s;ary for bringing
<PB N="3" REF="004896_0003_100E1501E610FAD8">Sinners off from all Dependance upon them&s;elves, to the meritorious Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t alone for their Ju&s;tification, and to the &s;uper-natural efficacious Power of his holy Spirit for their Sanctification. It is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;topping every Mouth from boa&s;ting before God, and that the apparent Heirs of Glory may a&s;cribe the whole Prai&s;e and Glory of their Salvation to him. It is a &s;trong for the Con&s;olation of Believers, and Ar|gument for their Love. It is moreover nece&s;&s;ary for the Glory of God's Sovereignty over his rebellious Creatures. On all the&s;e Accounts 'tis a Doctrines of great U&s;e, tho' it be not very agreeable to proud, unrenew'd Nature, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> may &s;ometimes appear awful to true Believers, when their Evidences of a converted State are very dark to them.</P>
<P>It is now &s;ome Years &s;ince I entertained Thoughts of publi&s;hing Something on this Subjects; the chief Rea&s;on en|clining me to it was, that there were &s;o many &s;mall Pieces, in Oppo&s;ition to the Doctrine, in People's Hands, abounding with a great Deal of Mi&s;repre&s;entations and fal&s;e Rea&s;oning, yet fair and plau&s;ible to the ignorant and unthinking; and &s;o few, on the other Hand, in the De|fence of it. There is, indeed, a great Deal well written upon it; but then it is generally in larger Volumes, along with other Subjects, &s;o that People in common have not the Advantage and Benefit of it. It's true, there have been &s;ome &s;mall Pieces upon it of late, of good U&s;e; Mr. <HI>Whitefield's An&s;wer</HI> to Mr. <HI>We&s;ly's bold Sermon;</HI> and another <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to the &s;ame <HI>Sermon,</HI> done by an anoni|mous Author, are both very good, &s;o far as they go; but I judg'd it needful to treat the Subject more fully, and &s;o have taken a larger Compa&s;s in &s;hewing the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Doctrine, confirming it from Scripture, and an|&s;wering all Objections.</P>
<P>It is likely this E&s;&s;ay may come under the View of Per|&s;ons of very different Sentiments about the Doctrine main|tained in it. I would de&s;ire all to read it with Care and Ari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntion, giving every Argument its due Weight, and
<PB N="4" REF="004896_0004_100E15036CA59890">carrying what you read along with you, from one Thing to another; &s;o that when you have read it thro', you may have the Sub&s;tance and Strenght of what has been &s;aid, in your View. If this Method be taken, I per&s;uade my|&s;elf, that &s;uch as are mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the Doctrine, and prejudiced again&s;t it, will at lea&s;t be convinced, that it is not that horrid and mon&s;trous Thing, which perhap, they had conceiv'd it to be: But whatever Influence this Treati&s;e may have on the Oppo&s;ers of the Doctrine, I hope it will, thro' the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, be &s;atisfying and con|firming to others. I think the Doctrine of Election may be a comfortable Support to exerci&s;ed Chri&s;tians, concern|ing the true Intere&s;ts of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, at this Day, when there is &s;uch fierce Oppo&s;ition made again&s;t the Revival of Religion and Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel among&s;t us, tho it is the Doing of the Lord. Bold Men &s;et them|&s;elves with all their Might again&s;t it, and try to blacken it to the World with horrid Fal&s;hoods, and odious malicious Reflections: But God will carry on his own De&s;igns, a|gain&s;t all the feeble Attemps of Creatures.</P>
<P>I commit this little Piece to the Reader's &s;erious Peru|&s;al, and the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Almighty God.</P>

<HEAD>The DOCTRINE of PREDESTINATION, TRULY and FAIRLY &s;tated.</HEAD>
<P>_IN order to &s;peak clearly, and to Advantage, upon any Subject; and e&s;pecially if it be much controverted in the World, it is in the fir&s;t Place nece&s;&s;ary, that it be exactly defined, and bounded by its proper Limits; that it be repre&s;ented properly, as it is maintain'd by tho&s;e who contend for it, that &s;o both Parties may have the &s;ame fixed, determinate Idea of what they rea&s;on about, and &s;peak both &s;till to the &s;elf &s;ame Thing. Endle&s;s are the Confu&s;ions and Contentions that are introduced into the World, either for the Want of this Care in defining, and rightly under&s;tand|ing the Subject in Debate; or for 'Want of Hone&s;ty in an Oppo&s;ite, when he will not keep clo&s;e to the very Thing, tho' he doth under&s;tand what it is. It is the readie&s;t Way to bring any Controver&s;y to a right I&s;&s;ue, rightly to &s;tate and repre&s;ent the Ca&s;e, and then to keep clo&s;e to it, as &s;o &s;tated, and not &s;uffer another Thing, under the &s;ame Name, to be &s;huffled in, in its Place, thro' the Cour&s;e of the Argument. In this
<PB N="6" REF="004896_0006_100E1508160085C8">Way, &s;uch Objections, as &s;uppo&s;e the Ca&s;e to be dif|ferent from what it is, are ea&s;ily an&s;wered, by reducing the Objector to the prefixed Limits, and &s;o &s;hewing his Argument to be Nothing to the Purpo&s;e in Hand. And I Thingk there is no where more need of this Care and Attention, than about the Doctrine of <HI>God's De|crees,</HI> or <HI>Prede&s;tination,</HI> which is the Subject of this &s;mall Treati&s;e. I know not any Doctrine more fu|riou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, without being rightly under&s;tood; or by being di&s;ingenuo&s;ly and uncandidly mi&s;repre&s;ented. I &s;hall therefore, fir&s;t of all, &s;tate the Doctrine truly, and then defend and confirm it.</P>
<P N="1">I. As to the true State of the Doctrine, it may be taken up in the&s;e two or three Propo&s;itions.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That as God, from everla&s;ting, was plea&s;ed, in his own free Sovereignty, to decree and determine, to create this World; and to make Man in it a rea&s;onable Creature, in his own Image, holy and upright, every Way fitted and impower'd for that Duty which was due, from &s;uch a rational Creature, to the great God Creator, with full Ability to per&s;evere and continue in that happy State of Integrity; and to enter into a Co|venant of Life with him, wherein all the human Race were to be concern'd and engaged; and <HI>Adam,</HI> their fir&s;t Father, con&s;tituted their publick Head and Re|pre&s;entative; &s;o that as he kept or broke the Covenant, they were to enjoy or lo&s;e the promis'd Ble&s;&s;ings of it: And as God infallibly foreknew the Fall and Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Adam,</HI> as what he had decreed to permit, and &s;o the Depravity and Ruin of his Po&s;terity con&s;e|quent thereupon, according to the Covenant; with all the actual Sins which every Individual &s;hou'd ever be guilty of; &s;o he was likewi&s;e plea&s;ed, of his own mere Grace and free Favour, to deerce and determine, to recover and &s;ave a Number, only known to him&s;elf, of that fallen wretched Race, thro' the Meditation of his own Son's Redeeming them, by an&s;wering the
<PB N="7" REF="004896_0007_100E150B5893D6F0">Precept and Penalty of the broken Law for them; and thro' the Sanctification of his eternal Spirit, making them fit for and capable of glorifying and enjoying him forever.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That God's determining and appointing to &s;ave any of fallen Mankind, or any in particular more than others, was not up on the Fore&s;ight of any Difference which he fore&s;aw they wou'd make among them&s;elves, by the better Improvement of any common Helps and Advantages, as the Rea&s;on of it: But it was purely of his own &s;overeign, free, wi&s;e Plea&s;ure, and di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Grace.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the re&s;t of fallen Mankind, not thus cho|&s;en and ordained to eternal Life, he was plea&s;ed, of his &s;overeign, wi&s;e and righteous Plea&s;ure, as a ju&s;t King and Lawgiver, to determine to leave in their fallen State; and to puni&s;h them according to all the Sin and Di&s;obedience, which they &s;hou'd be guilty of, and chargeable with.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This is, briefly, a ju&s;t View of the Ca&s;e I am upon; which I hope, with the divine Direction and Conduct, to maintain again&s;t all the Arguments commonly op|pos'd to the Doctrine. I cannot indeed expect, that this Repre&s;entation of it, will render it generally ac|ceptable and agreeable, to tho&s;e who have been long prejudiced again&s;&s;t it; but that is not the Que&s;tion, whether we wou'd encline and de&s;ire to have it &s;o; but, whether it be truly and really &s;o, whether we wou'd de&s;ire it &s;hou'd be &s;o, or not? Many of the Laws and Commands of God are very contrary to the Will and Inclination of depraved Sinners; but they are not the le&s;s truly the Commands of God for that. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the De&s;ence of this Doctrine, I wou'd fir&s;t &s;hew, that it is a rea&s;onable, and next, that it is a &s;criptural Doctrine; and &s;peak to the Arguments which may be urged, both for and again&s;t it, from both the&s;e Topicks, of Rea&s;on and Revelation.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="8" REF="004896_0008_100E150CDC4899C0">
II. 1. Tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the Doctrine of ab&s;olute Decrees, generally bring in a heavy Indictment again&s;t it, as big with the mo&s;t glaring Ab&s;urdities, Incon|&s;i&s;tencies, and Contradictions to the very Light of Rea&s;on: And the&s;e &s;uch as involve in them the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Impiety, and mo&s;t horrid Bla&s;phemy again&s;t the divine Maje&s;ty; as, that it is directly contrary to, and nece&s;|&s;arily infers the exact Rever&s;e of mo&s;t of the glorious Perfections and Attributes, which Rea&s;on, as well as Scripture, teaches us to a&s;cribe to the great God; that it makes him unju&s;t, and tyrannically cruel: Some &s;ay (I dread to expre&s;s it) wor&s;e than the very Devil; that it makes him the Author of Sin, chargeable with mo&s;t if not all the Guilt of it; that it makes him a mo&s;t gro&s;s, hypocritical Di&s;&s;embler, &amp;c. But &s;ure, it is not the proper <HI>Calvini&s;tick</HI> Doctrine, upon that Head, that the&s;e Men bring in all the&s;e awful and &s;hocking Charges again&s;t; but &s;ome horrid Compo&s;ition of their own Brain, which they will palm upon the <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> whether they will or no: Or el&s;e they ju&s;t re&s;olve, to bring a popular Odium upon the Doctrine, by &s;uch vile, bold, and daring Methods; to impo&s;e upon &s;uch as are not well capable to rea&s;on clearly or clo&s;ely, upon &s;uch a &s;ublime Subject, that they may abhor the very Thoughts of it. I readily own, that what&s;oever Notion infers any the lea&s;t Imper&s;ection in God, is unrea&s;onable and wor&s;e than fal&s;e. But let the Ac|count I have given of this Doctrine, be but duly and unbya&s;s'dly con&s;idered; and then tell me, if there is any Thing &s;o di&s;honourable to God, or unrea&s;onable in it: If there is, in which of the three Propo&s;itions, or Articles is it? Is it in the fir&s;t, when it is &s;aid, that God decreed to permit <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall? But you mu&s;t own, that he did permit it, <HI>that is,</HI> that he did not prevent it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f you own that <HI>Adam</HI> did fall; and con|&s;equently you mu&s;t own, that God decreed to per|mit or &s;uffer him to fall; for it's highly ab&s;urd to &s;ay
<PB N="9" REF="004896_0009_100E150F0F45C658">that he did permit it without determining to permit it; that is the &s;ame Thing as to &s;ay, that he took no No|tice of it at all, till it was done; that it never once came under the View of his all-comprehending, all|di&s;cerning Mind, how <HI>Adam</HI> wou'd behave him&s;elf in &s;uch Circum&s;tances as he was in, when he did tran&s;|gre&s;s, if left merely to his own U&s;e of his original Powers: But this is to deny God's infinite and bound|le&s;s Perfection. Well then, if he had this View and Knowledge of what <HI>Adam</HI> wou'd do in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, if thus left to him&s;elf; <HI>that is,</HI> that he wou'd &s;in; he determin'd either to hinder or &s;uffer it, to prevent or permit it. It's manife&s;t he did not determine to prevent it, for if &s;o, it wou'd not have been: And his not determining or decreeing to prevent in when he infallibly knew it wou'd be if he did not, was decree|ing to permit it. And then, upon this Decree to permit the Fall, proceeded God's certain Foreknow|ledge of it, as future. Moreover, this permi&s;&s;ive De|cree, and Foreknowledge of Man's Tran&s;grei&s;ion and A|po&s;tacy, plainly appears, from God's having foreoroain'd a Redeemer before the Foundation of the World, as acccording to 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.18, 19, 20. And now, &s;eeing the&s;e Things are plainly &s;o, <HI>viz.</HI> That God did thus deter|mine to permit the Fall of Man, which, in his perfect and boundle&s;s Knowledge, he &s;aw would be, if he did not hinder it by his immediate, &s;uper-added Influence; and con&s;equently fore&s;aw it, as a Thing that wou'd &s;urely be; &s;o plain, that he mu&s;t have a &s;trange Art of managing his Rea&s;on, who will carefully follow the&s;e few Steps I have here taken, and not be con&s;train'd to yield his A&s;&s;ent: Then &s;urely one would think, there was more Reverence and Honour due to the great and glorious Maje&s;ty of God, than for any poor Worms of the Du&s;t, to bring in their bold Charges again&s;t him here; and &s;ay, that for the&s;e Things he is the Author of Sin, either in that be created Man at all, or in that
<PB N="10" REF="004896_0010_100E151290074968">he did not prevent his Sin, when he could have done it. <HI>Who art thou, O Man, that replie&s;t again&s;t God!</HI> Surely it becomes us, to entertain more honourable, exalting Tho'ts of God, than to give the lea&s;t Way to &s;uch a vile Sugge&s;tion; even &s;uppo&s;ing our poor Mole-Eyes &s;hould not be able to di&s;cern, to our Satisfaction, how it could be otherwi&s;e. We may, on the one Hand, be clearly a&s;&s;ured of God's permi&s;&s;ive Decree, and certain Foreknowledge of Man's Sin; and on the other Hand, as well a&s;&s;ured, that he is e&s;&s;entially, and infinitely holy: And tho' we &s;hould not be able to re|concile the&s;e together, yet he can; and that ought to &s;ilence and &s;atisfy us: It does not well befit us, to put our&s;elves upon a Par with him; and think, that he can know Nothing, but what we mu&s;t know too. But yet, I &s;ee no Need of leaving the Ca&s;e at this I&s;&s;ue neither: For how unrea&s;onable and ridiculous is the Ground of the Charge? God did not purpo&s;e and de|termine to prevent <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sinning, when it was ea&s;y to his Power to have prevented it; well, and what then? Did not the Lord give him &s;ufficient Power to have prevented it him&s;elf? And was not this enough to free the kind Creator from all Blame in the Ca&s;e? Cannot God make a Creature perfect, and compleat in its Or|der and Rank, endowed with full Ability and Power to pre&s;erve its Glory un&s;tain'd, and put it in a State of Probation and Trial, without a criminal Charge? Mu&s;t he be call'd to an&s;wer at the Creature's Bar, for its own Mi&s;carriage and voluntary Rebellion, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e? Indeed, if we maintained, that God did not give <HI>Adam</HI> &s;ufficient Power to pre&s;erve his Fidelity, and with&s;tand the Temptation; or that God, by his immediate Energy, overpower'd him to a Compliance; then I confe&s;s, there would be no &s;tanding before the Argument: But as we a&s;&s;ert no &s;uch Thing, nor any|thing that will afford &s;uch a Con&s;equence, how unfair and inexcu&s;able is it, to give out as if we did? Which
<PB N="11" REF="004896_0011_100DEFABAE19D1A0">is the Method of too many, either ignorantly or wil|fully. And let me ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Arminians,</HI> yea, Men of all Sorts of Religions in the World, are no le&s;s obliged to an&s;wer this Difficulty, than the <HI>Cal|vini&s;ts;</HI> for they mu&s;t all ackowledge, that there is Sin in the World, and that God has permitted it, otherwi&s;e it could not be; yea, you mu&s;t acknowledge your&s;elves to have been guilty of Sins, and &s;uch as you might have avoided. But dare you lift up your Face before God, and &s;ay to him, <Q>I have done many Evils, even &s;uch as I had Power to refrain; but they are thy Sins and not mine, becau&s;e thou did&s;t not keep me from them.</Q> Would not your own Rea&s;on confound you with Shame, at the Thoughts of &s;uch a male-pert, &s;en&s;ele&s;s Speech to God? As little Rea&s;on is there, whatever le&s;s, for charging the righ|teous God in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Or, is it Matter of ju&s;t Prejudice again&s;t this Doc|trine, that Mankind are &s;aid to have been con&s;idered, in the divine Decree, as univer&s;ally fallen in <HI>Adam,</HI> in Con&s;equence of his Breach and Violation of the Co|venant of God, wherein he was appointed the Cove|nant-Head and Repre&s;entative of his Po&s;terity? But &s;ure your&s;elves mu&s;t acknowledge, that all Mankind did fall in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, if you profe&s;s to be|lieve the holy Scriptures: So long as the Fifth Chapter of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;tands in the Bible, it will be impo&s;&s;ible, with any Face of Mode&s;ty, to deny it; where we are told, that <HI>by one Man Sin en|tred into the World, and Death by Sin; and &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, for that all have &s;inned.</HI> And that <HI>by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation.</HI> When you &s;ay, that all Mankind are recovered again, out of the Condemnation and Ruin which the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> brought upon them, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; is it not an Acknowledgment, that they were all once fallen, and ruin'd by it? And ina&s;much as
<PB N="12" REF="004896_0012_100E1514145425B8">your&s;elves acknowledge it was &s;o, you mu&s;t acknow|ledge it was rea&s;onable, and no-way incon&s;i&s;tent with the Perfections of God, that it &s;hould be &s;o; or el&s;e you &s;ay, point blank, that God was, at lea&s;t once, unrighteous. And now, &s;eeing Mankind were fallen in <HI>Adam,</HI> which God's glorious Perfections will not &s;uffer us to think it was any Way unrea&s;onable on unju&s;t in him; it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that it would have been no Way unrea&s;onable or unju&s;t in God, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had &s;o plea&s;ed, to have left them all in that fallen State, without re&s;toring any. Seeing there was once a plain Forfeiture of all Rights and Privileges, accor|ding to Law and Ju&s;tice, it was at the free Plea&s;ure o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the great Law-giver, to be&s;tow them again upon any or not; unle&s;s you will &s;ay, that our Recovery by Chri&s;t was not of free and mere Grace, but what God was bound to order and bring about, or el&s;e oppo&s;e his own Nature and be unju&s;t; and &s;o, that herein he did what we have no Rea&s;on to thank him for: Which, to &s;ay, is not only a gro&s;s Incon&s;i&s;tency in it&s;elf, but &s;uch an Impiety again&s;t God, that few, I believe, wou'd be &s;o bold as to venture upon it. It is ridicu|lous to talk of our being <HI>redeem'd,</HI> by God, out of a mi&s;erable State, which it was unju&s;t for him, either to &s;uffer us to come into, or yet to leave us in. There is no need of a Mediator and Redeemer, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e. Then indeed Chri&s;t is dead in vain. Thus far we have made our Way clear. Well then, I &s;ay again, if it would have been no Way unbecoming God, if he had &s;o plea&s;ed, to have determined to leave all Mankind in that fallen State; no Man will &s;ay, who duly con&s;iders what he &s;ays, that it would have been any Way unbecoming him, had he &s;o plea&s;ed, looking upon them in this fallen, guilty, apo&s;tate State, to have made this Di&s;tinction among them, in his eternal Purpo&s;e; which I am defending: And &s;o the proper Doctrine of Prede&s;tination, in the right Notion

<P>But to make all this yet clearer, I would give this farther brief Account, of the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of Man|kind's partaking in the &s;ad Fruits of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. I would account for it, from his being &s;et up, as their publick Head and Repre&s;entative, in the fir&s;t Covenant. If this Con&s;titution and Appointment of God, was rea&s;onable, then all that was natively con&s;equent upon it, according to the Tenor of it, mu&s;t be &s;o too. To make it appear, that this Con&s;ti|tution was every Way ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, let it be con&s;idered, that it was in its own Nature adapted, and directly calculated to the great Good and Advan|tage of Mankind; &s;ecuring to them a confirmed State of Innocence, and everla&s;ting Happine&s;s, upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir&s;t Father's continuing obedient, &s;o long as God &s;aw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it to leave him in a State of Probation and Trial; &s;o that none of them would have been any more in the Danger of a probationary State for them&s;elves. <HI>Adam</HI> was &s;ufficiently impower'd to manage this great Tru&s;t, endowed with full Ability to keep the Covenant; yea, with as full as any of his Offspring would have had, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad they been to pa&s;s a Time of Trial for them&s;elves: And his Motives to Care and Watchfulne&s;s, were as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rong as theirs could have been, having his own eter|nal Intere&s;t as much engaged in the Ca&s;e as theirs; &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat their whole Stock, all their everla&s;ting Concerns, were every whit as &s;afe in his Hands as they would have been in their own.

2. In the next Place, is there any thing &s;o horrid in the &s;econd Article, <HI>viz.</HI> That God's Decree and Purpo&s;e, to &s;ave any of the fallen, apo&s;tate Race, was not founded upon his Fore&s;ight of their good Works, and diligent Endeavours, as the Cau&s;e of it; but was purely owing to his own &s;overeign Plea&s;ure and Grace. This is a Sentiment &s;o far from being unrea&s;onable, that I think the contrary is plainly &s;o, ab&s;olutely con|&s;ider'd, <HI>viz.</HI> that the imperfect, corrupted, and alto|gether &s;elfi&s;h Endeavours, of rebellious, guilty Crea|tures, &s;hould be of &s;uch high Price with God, as ne|ce&s;&s;arily to determine him to &s;ave them; &s;o that he would be unju&s;t, if he did not thereupon de&s;ign and effectuate their Salvation. Is this a Notion, either &s;o very rea&s;onable in it&s;elf, or honourable to God? And yet this is the Principle that mu&s;t be maintain'd, if the Doctrine I am defending be charged with being, in it&s;elf, unrea&s;onable. To manife&s;t a little the Unrea|&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uch a Notion, I would a&s;k, If an en|tire and perfect Obedience to the Law of God, without the lea&s;t Defect, would be any more than our Duty to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he is &s;uch a glorious Being, and we his Crea|tures! If it would not (and no Man in his right Wits will &s;ay otherwi&s;e) then how can the very imperfect, the every Way corrupt, and contemptible Obedience, that's performed by guilty Sinners, make it &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for God to pardon their pa&s;t Di&s;obedience, as that he would be unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t, if he did not? Ac|cording to this Principle, Pardon would not properly be pardon; it would not be an Act of meer Grace, and rich Mercy, but of ju&s;t Debt. But who is there, that has the Front to demand it, as &s;uch, for all the good Works that ever he did? I believe you wou'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd hard Work of it, to bring the Notion into Prac|tice, and very formally tell the great God, that <Q>Tho' you had &s;inn'd again&s;t him, and contemned his Au|thority; yet you had done &s;o well &s;ince, that you
<PB N="18" REF="004896_0018_100E1520EA76F0F0">wou'dn't now be beholden to him for Pardon, you claim'd it as your due, on the Score of his e&s;&s;ential Equity, which, he would be unju&s;t, if he refus'd.</Q> It is moreover a Notion, that entirely &s;uper&s;edes and takes away all Nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's Attonement and Satisfaction. What need of &s;uch a Propitiation and Ran&s;om, if any thing that guilty Sinners cou'd do, could render it unju&s;t in God, not to &s;ave them? And now, &s;eeing the&s;e Things are plainly &s;o, it as plainly and nece&s;&s;arily follws, that it was no Way unrea&s;on|able, nor unbecoming any of the divine Perfections for God to make his own &s;overeign, ab&s;olute Good-Will and Plea&s;ure, the Rule of his Determinations, of di&s;pen&s;ing his &s;aving Mercies to any fallen, guilty Sinners; and not their Works or Endeavours. Yea, I'll add, it is highly pre&s;umable from Rea&s;on it&s;elf, and &s;eems to be its very Dictate, that this was actually the Way of God's Proceeding in the Ca&s;e; as what was mo&s;t &s;uitable to his independent Sovereignty, for the maintaining, and Illu&s;tration of his exalted Glory; and to aba&s;e the Pride of all Fle&s;h, that none &s;hould glory in his Pre&s;ence; but as it is written, <HI>He that glorieth, &s;hould glory in the Lord alone:</HI> That his re|deem'd and &s;aved People, &s;hould forever a&s;cribe the <HI>whole Glory and Prai&s;e</HI> to his &s;overeign, free, di&s;tin|gui&s;hing Grace. This Method, in the Ca&s;e, was pro|ceeding like a God; as becomes the &s;upream JEHO|VAH: Exalts both his own Glory, and the Happine&s;s of &s;aved Sinners, to the highe&s;t; while they are ever &s;en&s;ible, that as he might ju&s;tly have &s;aved none, &s;o they have Nothing to a&s;cribe to them&s;elves in the Mat|ter, why he &s;aved them more than any others. Hence their Hearts beat high with the tendere&s;t, &s;weete&s;t Re|&s;entments of Love and Wonder, with the highe&s;t A&s;criptions of Glory and Prai&s;e, to him that &s;its upon the Throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever. So that, I believe, this Doctrine &s;uits be&s;t with the Lan|guage
<PB N="19" REF="004896_0019_100E152441645A90">of Heaven, however it be reli&s;h'd on Earth. If we con&s;ider the hateful, horrid, and criminal Nature of Sin; what can there be in any Sinner, to engage to him the Love and Favour of a God of infinite Holine&s;s, and incomprehen&s;ible Maje&s;ty; in who&s;e Sight the Heavens are not clean; who <HI>charges his An|gels with Folly?</HI> Now, tho' all the&s;e Con&s;iderations make it plainly appear, that it's every Way rea&s;onable, yea, mo&s;t becoming the adorable Maje&s;ty of God, that the Rea&s;on of his appointing any fallen Sinners, in particular, more than others, to eternal Life, &s;hould be wholly re&s;olv'd into his &s;overeign Plea&s;ure; that it &s;hould be entirely founded in him&s;elf, and not at all in them: Yet I'm apprehen&s;ive, that here lies the main Ground of the Quarrel; for tho' Sin has made Man extreamly poor, it hasn't made him humble, but much to the contrary; the unbroken Pride and Haugh|tine&s;s of Sinners Hearts, will not allow it to be right or equitable at all, that it &s;hould be altogether at the free, &s;overeign Plea&s;ure of God, whether to &s;ave them or not; unle&s;s they have it in their own Hand, they'll quarrel with God him&s;elf; altho' they de&s;erve not &s;o much as the lea&s;t Ground for Hope, that ever he will &s;ave them. It would &s;urely, better become &s;uch Hell-de&s;erving Rebels as we, to be &s;o humbly &s;en&s;ible of our vile Iniquities, as to acknowledge God's &s;overeign Right to di&s;po&s;e of us as he &s;ees fit; that if he &s;hould abandon us to Mi&s;ery forever, it would be but ju&s;t and right, notwith&s;tanding all that ever we could do; and if he &s;aves us, it will be an In&s;tance of the mo&s;t glorious, free, &s;overeign Grace and Mercy, which he might righteou&s;ly have denied. But the&s;e Things may &s;uffice here, to &s;how that this Part of the Doctrine al&s;o, &s;tands free of all unrea&s;onable Ab&s;urdity, and unbecoming Reflections on God. And if you wou'd have the whole Evidence again, in a narrow Compa&s;s, you may take it thus. God, the great
<PB N="20" REF="004896_0020_100E1525C685EFE8">Creator and Upholder of all Things, is the rightful Law-giver, and moral Governor of the rea&s;onable World; con&s;idering the infinite, boundle&s;s Glory and Perfections of his Nature, and his Right in and over us, as his Creatures, our Obligations of Love and Duty to him, are inconceivably great and infinite: Hence Sin and Di&s;obedience again&s;t &s;uch infinite Ma|je&s;ty, and Obligations, is infinitely evil; de&s;erving the Sinner's everla&s;ting Rejection from God, with a &s;uper|added po&s;itive Puni&s;hment.

God had as clear and certain a Knowledge of all this Apo&s;tacy, and Sin of, Mankind, from all Eternity, as after it actually came to pa&s;s; &s;o that in his Decrees concerning them, he con&s;idered them as in &s;uch a fallen, guilty State, de&s;erving the Execution of his vindictive Ju&s;tice; and atogether in&s;ufficient to do any thing, that might in the lea&s;t &s;atisfy its Demands, for the averting of the Stroke.

<P>Again, it is objected, that this Doctine <HI>makes God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">artial, and a Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons;</HI> which is ju&s;tly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eputed a very ill Character in Men, and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">annot in the lea&s;t belong to God.

Yet farther I would ob|&s;erve, there may be among Men a &s;avouring of one more than another, which you may call Re&s;pecting of Per&s;ons, or if you will, Partiality, or by what Name you plea&s;e; but it carries no ill Idea in it: Such, for In&s;tance, as our Lord &s;peaks of, <HI>Matth.</HI> xx. where the Lord of the Vineyard gave to &s;ome of his La|bourers an unde&s;erved Bounty, while he gave to others only what Ju&s;tice nece&s;&s;arily required: And this is brought in by our Lord Je&s;us him&s;elf, for this very Ca&s;e (&s;ce <HI>vcr.</HI> 16.) to vindicate God's making &s;uch a Difference among guilty Sinners, again&s;t &s;uch as make this Objection: And God's Defence here, is unan|&s;werable, again&s;t all the Murmurings of &s;uch as he has not cho&s;en to Salvation; <HI>Friend, I do thee no wrong,</HI> what&s;oever good I do to others; <HI>Is it not lawful for me

<P>It is farther objected, that according to this Doctrine, <HI>it is God's Fault, and not theirs, that any peri&s;h; ina&s;|much as it was ever impo&s;&s;ible for them to be &s;aved, &s;ee|ing they were under an irrever&s;ible Appointment to De|&s;truction, before ever they had a Being.</HI> But what has been &s;aid already, will ea&s;ily an&s;wer all the Difficulty that may &s;eem to be in this Argument, <HI>viz.</HI> That God appointed them to be puni&s;hed only for their Sins, whereby they in Ju&s;tice de&s;erve it: And &s;urely their Sinning is not any Fault in God; nor yet his appoint|ing them to de&s;erved Puni&s;hment for it: But &s;eeing all their Puni&s;hment will be only according to the Demerit of their Sin, their whole De&s;truction will properly be of them&s;elves, and their own Fault.

<P>Again, it is &s;aid, That <HI>if this Doctrine be true, then it follows, that God creates Men to damn them.</HI> This
<PB N="26" REF="004896_0026_100E15328E289A70">&s;eems to be a ready-hand Argument, almo&s;t in every ones Mouth that denies the Doctrine.</P>
<P>Before we &s;peck to any Words or Propo&s;itions, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ought to under&s;tand what is meant by them. Now a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Meaning I can conceive in this Sentence, <HI>[Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> creates Men to damn them]</HI> con&s;i&s;tent with the Pro|priety of Speech, is, that their Damnation is God'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> End in creating them; the final Cau&s;e and Rea&s;on o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> his bringing them into Being: And this imports in it that God loves, and delights in the Puni&s;hment and Mi&s;ery of Creatures, merely as &s;uch, and for its own Sake; which is a Thing mo&s;t bla&s;phemous to &s;uppo&s;e of him. To &s;uppo&s;e, that the Mi&s;ery of any Crea|ture, &s;trictly and ab&s;tractly in it&s;elf, without any other Con&s;ideration, is agreeable and plea&s;ing to God; yea &s;o agreeable, that he makes them for this very End that he may have the Plea&s;ure of puni&s;hing them; is indeed, to repre&s;ent him like the very wor&s;t of Beings But then I would a&s;k, Does God's decreeing to puni&s;h Men for their Sin, as they de&s;erve, for maintaining the Dignity of his Government, and the &s;hewing forth of his infinite Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice, and rightful Authority; does this, I &s;ay, bear in it any &s;uch Thing, as that he delights barely in the Mi&s;ery of Crea|tures, &s;o as to create them for the Sake of it? How irrational is &s;uch a Con&s;equence? But if any will yet in&s;i&s;t on it, as a ju&s;t Con&s;equence, I de&s;ire them to con&s;ider a little, how they will free their own Scheme of it; which is every whit as liable to the Charge: Unle&s;s they have &s;tupid Ignorance, and bla&s;phemous Pre&s;umption enough, to deny God's infinite Under|&s;tanding and Fore-knowledge of all Things, it is ju&s;t as rea&s;onable to bring this Objection again&s;t the <HI>Ar|minians,</HI> as the <HI>Calvini&s;ts;</HI> and &s;ay, that <HI>God creates Men to damn them,</HI> if he knows before-hand, that he will damn them; if he fore-knew that they would die impenitent, in Unbelief; and thereupon has decreed
<PB N="27" REF="004896_0027_100E1535064A5230">their Damnttion, before he has created them. The Truth in the Matter is this, God decreed to create all Men for the Manife&s;tation of his own Glory, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s his End in all his Works; and looking upon Man|kind in their Apo&s;tacy and Sin, he decreed to leave a particular Part of them in that State, and to puni&s;h them according to their Sin, for the Manife&s;tation of the Glory of his Sovereignty, Holine&s;s and Ju&s;tice, and the right and infinite Obligations of his Authority, as a Law-giver over his rea&s;onable Creatures. This View of the Ca&s;e gives no Ground for the Charge contain'd in the Objection. Tho' God fore&s;ees that Mankind will &s;in again&s;t him, cannot he, notwith|&s;tanding, create them; and determine to puni&s;h them, or any Part of them, as their Sin de&s;erves, for the Illu&s;tration of his Glory afore&s;aid; without being chargeable with creating them, ju&s;t that he might damn them? To &s;ay &s;o, is the &s;ame Thing as to &s;ay, that the Sin and Default of the Creature, mu&s;t bind up God's Hands from doing that which is in it&s;elf every Way rea&s;onable and Right; And in &s;hort, to &s;ay, that right is wrong. But I pre&s;ume, I have been long enough on the fir&s;t Method propos'd, for defending and con|firming this Doctrine: And that, from what has been &s;aid, it &s;ufficiently appears, at lea&s;t, that it is a Doc|trine free of all unrea&s;onable Ab&s;urdity in it&s;elf, and no way di&s;honourable to God. So that Rea&s;on has Nothing to &s;ay, why it may not be &s;o. And if in the next Place we find, that God's infallible Word of Truth declares that it is &s;o; this ought to put a final Conclu&s;ion to the Debate, and fully determine the Controver&s;y. If there is Nothing in the Doctrine ab&s;urd, or contrary to Rea&s;on, why it may not be &s;o; then when a pa&s;&s;age of Scripture is brought to prove that it is &s;o, we mu&s;tn't be put off any more with this An&s;wer, That <Q>whatever the Scripture means, it can't mean Prede&s;tination.</Q> A great A&s;&s;erter of

It &s;ets too high a Value upon the de&s;picable, religious Endeavours of corrupted Sinners; when it maintains, that God is thereby induced to receive the Sinner to Favour, notwith&s;tanding all his Rebellions.

And it is remarkable, how
<PB N="41" REF="004896_0041_100E1554C38AE410">the Apo&s;tle alters the Term, after he had begun with <HI>Calling,</HI> he puts in <HI>Chu&s;ing</HI> in the Place of it; becau&s;e temporal Vocation exactly corre&s;ponds to eternal Elec|tion, as the certain Con&s;equent and Evidence of it; and the one is as free and ab&s;olute as the other, &s;o that it was equal which of the Terms he us'd. Numbers of Scripture In&s;tances prove this Truth. What good Works of Obedience to Chri&s;t had <HI>Paul</HI> done? Or what good Di&s;po&s;itions had he towards him, before he reach'd him by his powerful Grace, to induce the Lord to chu&s;e and call him? Were not great Num|bers of his Nation, as good as he, left to peri&s;h in Unbelief? What were the good Works and Di&s;po|&s;itions of <HI>Abraham,</HI> more than others, when God cal|led him, as he was &s;erving other Gods on the other Side of the Flood, with the re&s;t of his Father's Hou&s;e? <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xxiv. 2. of whom the Lord &s;ays, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> li. 2. <HI>I called him alone, and ble&s;&s;ed him.</HI> This Argument is &s;o clear, and certain in all its Parts, that I think it would be quite &s;uperfluous, to be&s;tow any more Pains upon it.</P>
<P>Again, the Doctrine of Ab&s;olute Election appears from the only Way of fallen Sinners Salvation, as it is laid down and declar'd in the Go&s;pel, <HI>viz.</HI> The Way of believing only and entirely in the Merit and Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us, for actual Reconciliation with God. The Argument here may be thus form'd. That Doctrine, which leaves no Room for guilty Sin|ners to re&s;t and depend on any thing, but the recon|ciled Favour of God, and their Acceptance with him; (the contrary of which, does give Room to Sinners to re&s;t, and depend al&s;o, on &s;omething el&s;e, for Reconci|liation and Acceptance with God) mu&s;t be true, and its contrary fal&s;e, according to the Scriptures: But the Doctrine of ab&s;olute Election leaves no Room for guilty Sinners to re&s;t and depend on any thing, for the
<PB N="42" REF="004896_0042_100E1557D2CBE7A8">reconcil'd Favour of God, and their Acceptance with him, but the Merit and Attonement of Je&s;us Chri&s;t only: And the contrary Doctrine does give them room to re&s;t, and depend al&s;o, on &s;omething el&s;e for it, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;omething in them, or done by them; There|fore the Doctrine of ab&s;olute Election is true, and the contrary Doctrine fal&s;e, according to the Scriptures.</P>
<P>The Scripture clearly teaches us, to look only to the Merit and Attonement of Chri&s;t's Obedience and Suf|ferings, for actual Ju&s;tification before God, and Re|conciliation with him: And it is as clear, that the Doctrine, of Sinners being cho&s;en in Chri&s;t, and fore-appointed to Ju&s;tification and eternal Life thro' him, of God's mere, &s;overeign, free Grace, agrees very well with this; it cuts all the Sinews of Self-Depen|dance, and leaves the Sinner no other Foundation to ca&s;t him&s;elf upon, but the &s;overeign Mercy of God, thro' a redeeming Saviour. And I think it's as clear again on the other Hand, that the oppo&s;ite Doctrine, of a conditional Election, founded either upon the actual Exi&s;tence of &s;ome Good in, or done by the Sin|ner, or upon the Fore-Sight of it to be in him, or done by him, lays a Foundation for Self-Dependance, and &s;o tends to keep undone Sinners from clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t in the Way of the Go&s;pel. This delu&s;ive O|pinion makes poor Creatures &s;well very big with a Conceit of them&s;elves, and what they do; when they imagine their Qualifications and Doings are of &s;uch Price with God, it makes them halve the Procure|ment of their Salvation between Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and their own, which he will never bear: It makes them patch their filthy Rags and men&s;trous Cloaths, to his compleat, un&s;potted Robe, for a joint Recommendation of them to God's Acceptance. In|deed I can't &s;ee a material Difference between <HI>Armi|nian</HI> Prote&s;tants and the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> about the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification. And I find two great Bi&s;hops, one of
<PB N="43" REF="004896_0043_100E155B0F578938">each Sort, of my Mind. Says Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet,</HI> in his <HI>Expo&s;ition</HI> (more properly <HI>Perver&s;ion</HI>) of the 39 Arti|cles of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> Page 126. <Q>This Mat|ter was &s;o &s;tand by many of the Writers of the <HI>Church of Rame</HI> (after the Reformation) that as to the Main of it, we have no ju&s;t Exception to it.</Q> The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> in his Expo&s;ition of the Doc|trine of the <HI>Catholick Church,</HI> Page 93, after he has been explaining their Sen&s;e of Ju&s;tification, and Me|rit of good Works, &s;ays, <Q>And indeed we mu&s;t ac|knowledge, that the learned of their Party (mean|ing the Reform'd) do not contend &s;o much of late about this Subject, as they did formerly; and there are but few, who do not now confe&s;s, there ought not to have been a Breach upon this Point. But if this important Difficulty about Ju&s;tification, upon which their fir&s;t Authors laid all their Stre&s;s, be not look'd upon now, as e&s;&s;ential, by the wi&s;e&s;t Per&s;ons among&s;t them, we leave them to think, what they ought to judge of their Separation; and what Hopes there would be of an Union, if they wou'd but overcome their Prejudice, and quit the Spirit of Contention.</Q> Thus we &s;ee Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts cordially &s;haking Hands, and agreeing again, in one of the mo&s;t material Matters of Difference. And all the Conte&s;t remaining, is, which Side has made the Approach to the other. The one &s;ays, <HI>You have come to us:</HI> The other &s;ays, <HI>No, but you have come to us</HI> And this, I believe, will be judged but a &s;mall Matter for Brethren to fall out about. However, I think I might venture, in a Court of Equity, to undertake to obtain Sentence upon this Plea, in Favour of the <HI>Ro|mi&s;h</HI> Gentleman.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Argument I &s;hall offer, for Confirmation of this Doctrine, &s;hall be taken from the declared Scope and De&s;ign of God in the Go&s;pel; which is (as it is highly rea&s;onable) to &s;ecure the whole Glory of
<PB N="44" REF="004896_0044_100E155D6E2DF5E0">Sinners Salvation to him&s;elf; and forever hide Prid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from Man: He a&s;&s;ures us, he has &s;o concerted th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Scheme, and laid the Plan, that the &s;aved Sinner &s;hall not have the lea&s;t Ground to boa&s;t, or glory: Which evidently proves, that Election is not conditional founded on Sinners good Works or Di&s;po&s;ition; but ab&s;olute, founded on God's good Plea&s;ure. For upon the conditional Scheme, the ju&s;tify'd, converted Per|&s;on, has it to a&s;cribe to him&s;elf, that he, more than an|other, is in &s;uch an happy State. The Rea&s;on can|not be God's di&s;tingui&s;hing Love and Grace to him, beyond others; but his own di&s;tingui&s;hing Goodne&s;s: For the others are &s;uppo&s;ed to have had as much Love and Kindne&s;s from God, as he; Whence then came the Difference that is between them? Not from God, for he made no Difference; but from him&s;elf. And does not this give &s;ome Ground for boa&s;ting of him&s;elf in the Ca&s;e? To arrogate &s;ome Glory and Prai&s;e to him&s;elf? But the true Go&s;pel-Way of Salvation, will not, in the lea&s;t, admit of any &s;uch Thing. It is cro&s;s to God's declared View, and De&s;ign in it. See <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 8, 9. <HI>For by Grace ye are &s;aved, thro' Faith; and that not of your&s;elves: It is the Gift of God: Not of Works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould bea&s;t.</HI> The Way which God has laid for Sinners Salvation, is &s;uch, that it pre|cludes and bars again&s;t all Boa&s;ting in tho&s;e that are &s;aved; and therefore it is not of <HI>Works,</HI> but thro' <HI>Faith,</HI> which is a Soul-humbling, Self-emptying Grace, and a Gift of God's royal Bounty, which he be&s;tows at plea&s;ure, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 27. After the Apo&s;tle has clearly laid down the true Go&s;pel-Way, of guilty Sinners Ju&s;|tification and Salvation, thro' the alone Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, imputed in a Way of believing; he a&s;ks, <HI>Where is boa&s;ting then?</HI> and an&s;wers, <HI>It is excluded. Not by the Law of Works, but by the Law of Faith.</HI> All boa&s;ting is entirely excluded, by that Method which God has e&s;tabli&s;hed. And hence we may, with abundant Evi|dence,
<PB N="45" REF="004896_0045_100E155F1D8A60C0">conclude, that that Doctrine, which affords any Room for Glorying and Boa&s;ting, is not of God, being directly contrary to the Plan and De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Having now, I think, with great Clearne&s;s, from God's Word of Truth, prov'd the Doctrine of ab&s;o|lute, unconditional Election; I proceed in the next Place to prove, That tho&s;e of guilty Mankind, whom God did not thus chu&s;e to everla&s;ting Life and Salva|tion thro' Chri&s;t, he determined to leave in their guil|ty State, and inflict upon them their de&s;erved Puni&s;h|ment. And upon this Branch of Prede&s;tination, I need be but &s;hort, becau&s;e it is adundantly proven already, by the Proof of the former; for the one is a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of the other. If God determin'd to deal with guilty Mankind, in &s;uch a &s;overign Way as has been prov'd, making his own righteous, &s;overeign Plea&s;ure, the only Rule of his Proceedings towards them, then it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that &s;uch as he did not ordian to Life, he did ordian to de&s;erved Death. To &s;uppo&s;e an ab&s;olute and certain Election of a Part of guilty Sinners, to be redeem'd and &s;aved, and yet, that the re&s;t are not reprobated or rejected, are very incon&s;i&s;tent Notions. For &s;eeing all Mankind were looked upon and con&s;ider'd, by God in his Decrees, as under a righteous Sentence of Condemnation to Puni&s;hment for their Sin; then &s;ure &s;uch as he did not determine to deliver out of that Condemnation and Ruin, were left in it, to &s;uffer the Law. To &s;ay, <HI>That they were all elected conditionally, tho' the others were ab&s;olutely,</HI> is as contrary to tho&s;e Scriptures that have been adduced, as to deny an ab&s;olute Election al|together. For they a&s;&s;ert Election to be univer&s;ally ab&s;olute, contrary to &s;uch a Di&s;tinction of a two-fold Election: It is a Notion, e&s;pecially contrary to tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, which declare the Ab&s;olutene&s;s of <HI>Effectual Calling,</HI> in all tho&s;e that are &s;o called: And tho&s;e Pa&s;|&s;ages
<PB N="46" REF="004896_0046_100E1560A48647E0">&s;ages which declare, that all that are &s;aved, are &s;aved in &s;uch a Way, as excludes all Self-glorying and Self-depending. But I proceed to offer a &s;ew other Proof from the Scripture, for the Confirmation of this Head. And fir&s;t I argue thus, Tho&s;e who were not given in Charge by the Father to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be redeem'd and &s;av'd by him, were left in their Sins, and ordian'd to &s;uffer the Law for them them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e who were not certainly elected to Salva|tion, were not given in Charge by the Father to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be redeem'd and &s;av'd by him: Therefore they were left in their Sins, and ordain'd to &s;uffer the Law for them them&s;elves. That tho&s;e, who were not certainly elected to Salvation, were not given in Charge by the Father to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be redeem'd and &s;av'd by him; is plain from this, That all tho&s;e, who were &s;o given in Charge to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to be redeem'd and &s;av'd by him, &s;hall certainly be &s;aved by him; and were certainly and infallibly ordain'd to be &s;o. This is clearly prov'd from the Words of Chri&s;t, <HI>Job.</HI> vi. 38, 39. <HI>For I came down from Heaven, not to do mine own Will, but the Will of him that &s;ent me. And this is the Father's Will, which hath &s;ent me, that of all which he hath given me, I &s;hould lo&s;e Nothing, but &s;hould rai&s;e it up again at the la&s;t Day.</HI> The&s;e Words I think, plain|ly &s;ay, that all &s;uch, as are not in the End actually &s;av'd by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, if he be faithful to his Tru&s;t, were not committed to his Charge to be redeem'd by him, and con&s;equently they were left under the con|demnatory Sentence of the Law.</P>
<P>Another Proof. that tho&s;e whom God has not ab|&s;olutely elected to Salvation, he has left to peri&s;h, and abandon'd from his &s;aving Care, you have, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 7. where after the Apo&s;tle has &s;aid, that <HI>the Remnant of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>which God had re&s;erved to him&s;elf, according to the Election of Grace, had obtain'd Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Life,</HI> he adds, <HI>And the re&s;t were blinded.</HI> Very full
<PB N="47" REF="004896_0047_100E15632D731608">and expre&s;s to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e are tho&s;e Words, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i. 8. <HI>Chri&s;t is a Stone of Stumbling, and Rock of Of|fence, even to them which &s;tumble at the Word, being di&s;obedient, whereunto al&s;o they were appointed.</HI> God appointed to leave them to Blindne&s;s, Stumbling and Di&s;obedience; which Things are always con&s;equent upon God's leaving any to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This Doctrine, o Sinners <HI>Rejection or Reprobation</HI> in the eternal Purpo&s;e of God, is indeed, I acknow|ledge, a very awful and &s;olemn one; e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who don't find in them the comfortable Evidences of Election; and might rea&s;onably excite in them a deep Concern about the great Concerns of their Souls, and &s;tir them up to take no peaceful Re&s;t, till they find in them&s;elves the hopeful Token of God's electing Love, in a &s;upernatural work of renewing, &s;an &s;tifying Grace in their Souls. But then let us take Care, that we don't charge God fooli&s;hly and wickedly in the Ca&s;e, as if he were cruel and unrighteous. What if God was willing to &s;hew his Wrath, and to make his Power known, upon <HI>the Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath, fitted to De&s;trution,</HI> and worthy of Death, who can ju&s;tly find fault with him? What if he had reprebated all apo&s;tate Mankind, as well as all apo&s;tate Angels, who cou'd &s;ay, he had done wrong? Every Mouth mu&s;t have been &s;topped, all the World being guilty before him.</P>
<P>But I come to &s;peak to the Objections, commonly urged from the Scriptures again&s;t the foregoing Doc|trine, in both its Branches. And here I &s;hall fir&s;t take Notice of the Method, which tho&s;e, on the other Side of the Que&s;tion, put a main Confidence in, for the overthrowing of this Doctrine; by going about to prove a <HI>Univer&s;al Redemption;</HI> that <HI>Chri&s;t dyed equally for all, and every Individual of Mankind; for one as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uch as another.</HI> This, they think, they can very ea&s;ily ptove from &s;uch Places of Scripture, as &s;peak of <HI>his Dying for all Men; for all the World; the whole

Some of tho&s;e Places of Scripture, where &s;uch univer&s;al Terms are us'd, concerning Chri&s;t's Death, and the Effects of it, only &s;ignify the Virtue and Efficacy of it, to tho&s;e who partake of the Benefits of it. Some others &s;ignify, that his Death was de&s;ign'd promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly for &s;ome of all Nations, and of all Ranks and Conditions of Men, as not confin'd to any one parti|cular Nation, or Degree of Mankind. Others again
<PB N="49" REF="004896_0049_100E15670DB6E510">only mean, that Chri&s;t is the only Saviour, that none are &s;aved but thro' his Death. In the fir&s;t Sen&s;e, we are to under&s;tand <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 18. The De&s;ign of that whole Chapter is to &s;hew, That Chri&s;t's Death and Sa|tisfaction, is of <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> Virtue, for the ju&s;tifying and &s;aving of the <HI>mo&s;t guilty</HI> Sinners. For this Purpo&s;e, the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves the Efficacy of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, and breaking the Law, to the condemning of tho&s;e to whom it was charged and imputed, declaring, that much more is Chri&s;t's fulfilling the Law, effectual to the compleat Ju&s;tification of tho&s;e to whom it is umputed, notwith&s;tanding their former Condemnation. And &s;o when he &s;ay, that <HI>as by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation: Even &s;o, by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free Gift came upon all Men to Ju&s;tification of Life.</HI> His Meaning is, That as the Offence and Di&s;obedience of <HI>Adam</HI> prevail'd, to the condemning of tho&s;e to whom it reach'd, and was imputed; even &s;o, the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t was &s;ufficiently effectual, to the full Ju&s;tification of tho&s;e to whom it was imputed, from the Guilt of that Of|fence, and all others; &s;o as to entitle them again to eternal Life. So that the Apo&s;tle's De&s;ign, is not at all to run a Parallel between <HI>Adam</HI>'s Offence and Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s, in the Extent of their Influ|ence and Effects; but to compare the one with the other, as to the Efficacy of their Influence; in Re|&s;pect of which he ob&s;erves, that Chri&s;t's Righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>is much &s;uperiour,</HI> as it ju&s;tifies to Life, even after <HI>A|dam</HI>'s Offence has condemn'd to Death.

<P>The proper Import, and De&s;ign of tho&s;e Words, 1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 2. <HI>He is the Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the Sins of the whole World,</HI> is, that the Death of Chri&s;t was a Propitiation, or At|tonement, not only for People among the <HI>Jews,</HI> or for tho&s;e who were then Believers in tho&s;e Parts of World; but al&s;o for &s;ome, be they more or le&s;s, in all Parts and Ages of the World: For he was to be God's Salvation unto the Ends of the Earth.</P>
<P>When the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 6. That <HI>Chri&s;t gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for all;</HI> it appears from the Con|text, that he means Per&s;ons of all Ranks and Degrees; for he brings it in as an Argument to enforce his Ex|hortation, to <HI>pray for Kings, and all that are in Autho|rity.</HI> The &s;ame univer&s;al Term he manife&s;tly intends in the &s;ame Sen&s;e, in the 1&s;t Ver&s;e, when he &s;ays, <HI>I exhort therefore, that fir&s;t of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions, and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men.</HI> He can't mean &s;ure, that they &s;hou'd pray for the Millions of Men that were dead, and gone to their own Place before that Time: Neither can he intend, that they &s;hould pray for &s;uch as the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> ex|cludes from an Intere&s;t in our Prayers, 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 16. <HI>There is a Sin unto Death: I do not &s;ay, that</HI> a Man <HI>&s;hall pray for it;</HI> that is, for &s;uch as are guilty of it: But he explains his Meaning, to be for Men of all Stations and Degrees, the high as well as the low; adding, <HI>for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</HI> When the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Heb.</HI> ii. 9. That <HI>Chri&s;t ta&s;ted Death for every Men;</HI> the Meaning is, for every Man that is &s;aved; to &s;ignify, that <HI>none</HI> are &s;av'd but thro'
<PB N="52" REF="004896_0052_100E156E485DBD28">Chri&s;t's Death, that his Death is the <HI>only Purcha&s;e</HI> of Salvation for any Man.

So 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 5. <HI>When the Lord comes to Judgment, every Man &s;hall have Prai&s;e of God;</HI> that is, every Man that is &s;aved, or has been truly godly. Another Place of Scripture which is brought in, to &s;erve the Cau&s;e of <HI>Univer&s;al Redemption,</HI> is, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 1. where the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, of &s;ome <HI>who &s;hould privily bring in damnable Here&s;ies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon them&s;elves &s;wift De&s;truction.</HI> But the Apo&s;tle only &s;peaks of the Lord's having bought them, as what might have been hop'd concerning them as well as o|thers. The Go&s;pel Revelation of a Saviour, that dy'd to redeem Sinners, affords Ground to all, to whom it comes, to hope, that his Death might have been de|&s;ign'd for them, as well as others, (tho' it was not in|tended for <HI>all and every one</HI> alike) &s;eeing it does not point out the Per&s;ons in particular, for whom he did not intend the Benefits of his Death. And &s;o, con|cerning the&s;e Per&s;ons here, the Apo&s;tle mentions it as a high Aggravation of their Crime, that they &s;hould <HI>deny</HI> that Redeemer, of whom they had no Rea&s;on to conclude to the contrary, but that he had <HI>bought and redeemed them;</HI> when they had the &s;ame Ground for Hope, this Way, that any others had, before they had the &s;pecial Evidences of it in renewing Grace.</P>
<P>Thus, I have con&s;idered &s;ome of the mo&s;t material Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, which are advanced in Favour of <HI>Univer&s;al Redemption.</HI> And I think any con&s;ider|ate Per&s;on might &s;ee, from what has been &s;aid, that they come far &s;hort of an&s;wering the De&s;ign they are advanced for. And any other Pa&s;&s;ages of the like Strain, are to be under&s;tood the &s;ame Way. I have
<PB N="53" REF="004896_0053_100E156FEB7C9950">already mention'd a Place of Scripture, <HI>John</HI> vi. 39. which proves, that all tho&s;e, who were given to Chri&s;t to redeem, he will &s;urely &s;ave and finally glorify; un|le&s;s it may be &s;aid, he was unfaithful to his Charge: For it was <HI>the Will of him that &s;ent him, that he &s;hould lo&s;e none of them, but rai&s;e them up again at the la&s;t Day;</HI> and &s;o put the fini&s;hing Stroke to their full Glo|rification: Which confirms a <HI>particular</HI> Redemption, in Oppo&s;ition to a <HI>univer&s;al.</HI> In the 10th Chapter of <HI>John,</HI> our Lord &s;peaks of a <HI>peculiar People,</HI> which he had both among the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> whom he calls his <HI>Sheep, for whom,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>he laid down his Life.</HI> And <HI>John</HI> xvii. he &s;peaks of tho&s;e whom the Father had given him, as <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> from the re&s;t of Mankind: <HI>For the&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>he prays, and not for the World,</HI> ver. 9. and ver. 19. he &s;ays, <HI>For their Sakes I &s;anctify my|&s;elf;</HI> that is, it is for their Sakes that I &s;et my&s;elf apart to the Office and Charge of a Redeemer, and devote my&s;elf to be a Sacrifice.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only farther point out, as briefly as may be, &s;ome Ab&s;urdities attending the Doctrine of <HI>Univer&s;al Redemption;</HI> and &s;o di&s;mi&s;s it. If God &s;ent his Son to die for Sinners, with an equal View and De&s;ign to &s;ave them all by it, intending as much the Salvation of one as another, without any Difference; then it will fol|low, that tho&s;e who are &s;aved, are no more beholden or obliged to God, than tho&s;e that peri&s;h: And it was not from him that they were &s;aved, any more than others, but from them&s;elves; and &s;o he &s;hall not have the Glory of it; nay, he is rather beholden to them, for letting him have his End. Again, it will follow, that God in a great Mea&s;ure comes &s;hort of obtaining his End and De&s;ign, and that in the greate&s;t Affair that ever he undertook, &s;o far as we are acquainted: An End which he was &s;o intent upon, that <HI>he &s;pared not his own Son, but delivered him up to</HI> the Death, that he might obtain it. The End which he was in|tently
<PB N="54" REF="004896_0054_100E15716E2F5570">&s;et upon, was the Salvation of all the human Race, and yet he is greatly di&s;appointed of it; for great Numbers forever peri&s;h. Now how can any Man rea&s;onably per&s;uade him&s;elf, that God really pro|po&s;ed to him&s;elf, and intended &s;uch and End, and yet did not made it &s;ure, and a&s;certain the Attainment of it? Was it not ea&s;y to his Power to do it? Has he not <HI>the Hearts of all Men in his Hand?</HI> Would it have done tham any Inju&s;tice, to have per&s;uaded them by almighty Power, and made them willing to be happy? But &s;eeing he has not done &s;o, it is plain, that the Sal|vation of all, was not the End and De&s;ign he had in view, in &s;ending his Son into the World to die. Would he have left a De&s;ign he had &s;o much at Heart, upon the precarious Bottom (to &s;ay the be&s;t of it that any can &s;ay) of the <HI>Fee-will</HI> of corrupted Creatures, that were no way well affected towards him, but aw|fully di&s;affected? Nay farther, it will follow, that it might have &s;o happened, as that he would have en|tirely lo&s;t his End altogether: For, for-all &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly as he intended it, and was &s;et upon it; yet it &s;eems he did not make it certain, no, not as to the Salvation of any one Soul, but left it altogether to them&s;elves. One would think by this, that he was not very Intent upon it, for all the great Pretences of &s;ome, by this Doctrine, to magnify his Love and Good-Will to Men. And it may be con&s;ider'd, which Doctrine magnifies the Love of God mo&s;t? That which renders the Sal|vation of a con&s;iderable Number infallibly certain; or that which leaves it altogether uncertain, as to any? leaving it entirely to the <HI>good Plea&s;ure</HI> of their depraved Wills? I believe it will be found, that <HI>more</HI> will be &s;aved in <HI>that</HI> Way, than would have been in <HI>this:</HI> For I think, upon this Score, none at all would be &s;aved. However, it's plain, that great Multitudes do finally oppo&s;e and contradict this &s;uppo&s;ed Intention of God; and what hinders, but all the re&s;t might do &s;o
<PB N="55" REF="004896_0055_100E1574F6628FC8">too, according to this <HI>univer&s;al</HI> Scheme; and &s;o not &s;o much as one be &s;aved after all; for all are alike op|po&s;ite to the Way of Salvation, by Nature? But you'll &s;ay, perhaps, there was no Danger of &s;uch a great Di&s;|appointment, and Fru&s;tration of God's End as this; for he fore-knew who would comply with the Go&s;pel and be &s;aved; and &s;o knew that he would not altoge|ther fail of his De&s;ign. But this is &s;o far from clear|ing the Doctrine, that it introduces a new Ab&s;urdity. For how can it be conceiv'd, that God could really intend, and de&s;ign the Death of Chri&s;t, and the Be|nefit of it, for tho&s;e who he infallibly knew would never be Partakers of it? Is it not an Ab&s;urdity, mayn't I &s;ay Impo&s;&s;ibility, in the very Nature of the Thing? To what Purpo&s;e, was the Death of Chri&s;t de&s;ign'd for them; or for what Advantage? Not to &s;ave them, for that the Lord knew would never be: And every de&s;igning of an End, includes in it &s;ome Degree of Expectation, which could not be in this Ca&s;e. Was it to purcha&s;e &s;ufficient Grace for them, that &s;o they might be &s;av'd if they would? Well, but the Lord knew, that they would not make the &s;aving U&s;e of it; and why then was it intentionally purchas'd for them; &s;ure you will not &s;ay, it was to make their Guilt and Puni&s;hment the greater? Let the Admi|rers of <HI>Univer&s;al Redemption</HI> con&s;ider a little, how they will dige&s;t and &s;olve the&s;e Things. But to proceed,</P>
<P>The Oppo&s;ers of the Doctrine of <HI>Ab&s;olute Decrees,</HI> argue farther again&s;t it, from &s;ome Places fo Scripture, which they &s;uppo&s;e declare a general Will, and De&s;ire in God, of the Conver&s;ion and Salvation of all Sin|ners; and how much he would be plea&s;ed with it: Which they &s;uppo&s;e, is contrary to his having purpos'd not to give to &s;ome the Grace nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ufficient for their Conver&s;ion, but to leave them to peri&s;h in their Sins. I &s;hall a little con&s;ider the principal pa&s;|&s;ages which they advance to this Purpo&s;e, and &s;hew,
<PB N="56" REF="004896_0056_100E15697A5AC820">that they intend nothing contrary to this Doctrine. One of them is, 1 <HI>Tim</HI> ii. 4. <HI>God will have all Men to be &s;aved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI> If <HI>all Men</HI> here, be under&s;tood for <HI>every individual Man in the World;</HI> then God's willing them to be &s;a|ved, can't mean his having will'd and purpos'd, that they &s;hall be &s;av'd; for then they all wou'd be &s;av'd, becau&s;e he can ea&s;ily fulfil all his Purpo&s;es, and &s;urely will do &s;o. For <HI>his Coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and he will do all his Plea&s;ure,</HI> I&s;ai. xlvi. 10. <HI>The Coun&s;el of the Lord &s;tandeth forever, and the Thoughts of his Heart to all Generations,</HI> P&s;al. xxxiii. 11. But if the Words be taken in this unlimited Sen&s;e, the Meaning of the Place mu&s;t only be, that the Salvation of <HI>all Men,</HI> in the Way of Faith and Holine&s;s, would be a Thing very agreeable to the approving, and preceptive Will of God; as he delights in Holine&s;s, and the Happine&s;s which is connected with it; and that Sin, for which it is that any peri&s;h, is di&s;agreable and hateful to his holy Nature: And yet, all this is no Way incon&s;i&s;tent with his determining to puni&s;h Sinners for their Sin. But I think it is plain, from the Context, that by <HI>all Men</HI> here, we are to under&s;tand, <HI>Men of all Characters and Degrees;</HI> for the Words are brought in as an Ar|gument to encourage Chri&s;tians to <HI>pray for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</HI> And in the &s;ame Sen&s;e, the Term <HI>all Men,</HI> is intended in the fir&s;t Ver&s;e, as I have made appear before.</P>
<P>Another Place is, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 9. <HI>The Lord is not &s;lack concerning his Promi&s;e; but is long-&s;uffering to us-ward, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to Repentance.</HI> I think it is pretty manife&s;t, that the Per&s;ons the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of here, are the <HI>Elect of God:</HI> The Per&s;ons to whom he writes the&s;e Epi&s;tles, are con&s;ider'd under that Character, in his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, <HI>Chap.</HI> i. 2. he calls them <HI>Elect, according to the Fore|knowledge of God the Father, thro' Sanctification of the

<P>There is another Scripture, that is always brought in upon this Head of Argument, <HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxiii. 11. Where the Lord declares, with the Solemnity of an Oath, <HI>As I live, &s;aith the Lord God, I have no Plea&s;ure in the Death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his Way and live.</HI> When the Lord &s;ays, <HI>he has no Plea&s;ure in the Death of the Wicked;</HI> the plain Sen&s;e of the Words is, that the Death and Mi&s;ery of Sin|ners is <HI>not a Plea&s;ure</HI> to him in it&s;elf, or for its own Sake, meerly as it is a Mi&s;ery to the Creature. But this doesn't &s;ay, but that their Death and Puni&s;hment may be agreeable and plea&s;ing to him, under other Con&s;iderations; as it is an Execution of Ju&s;tice, and Manife&s;tation of his own Glory. If it were not &s;o, Would he inflict Puni&s;hment upon any of them? Would he di&s;plea&s;e and make him&s;elf unea&s;y? And when he &s;ays, That <HI>it is a Plea&s;ure to him, that the Wicked turn from his Way, and Live.</HI> The Meaning is, that righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s in his Creatures, and the Happine&s;s con&s;equent upon it, is the Object of his Approbation and Liking, a Thing, in it&s;elf, agreeable and plea&s;ing to his holy Nature. But this, &s;ure, is no Proof, that he equally and alike de&s;ign'd the Sanctifi|cation and Salvation of all Sinners. If it prov'd any thing this Way, it would prove, that he di&s;ign'd it certainly for them all, if his Power could effect it.</P>
<P>The Words of our Lord, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxiii. 37. are often brought in upon this Head, where he &s;ays of <HI>Jeru&s;alem, How often would I have gathered thy Chil|dren

But if we &s;uppo&s;e him to &s;peak of his Willingne&s;s, meerly as Man, in his human Nature, then I &s;ee no Inconvenience in allowing, that it may &s;ignify an inten&s;e and pa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ire in him of their Conver&s;ion and Happine&s;s: But &s;urely no &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions, or unea&s;y long De&s;ires, and e&s;pecially for Things which will never be effected, are to be a&s;cribed to the divine Nature. For my Part, I can't apprehend what Sort of a Will and De&s;ire, for the Conver&s;ion and Salvati|on of all Men, it is, which tho&s;e who deny <HI>ab&s;olute Prede&s;tination</HI> &s;uppo&s;e to be in God, any Way con&s;i&s;|tent with his Perfection: They &s;uppo&s;e includes much more, than that the Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s of his Creatures is a Thing in it&s;elf, lovely and agree|able to him; that it is his preceptive and approving Will, that they &s;hould be holy and con&s;equently hap|py: which is very con&s;i&s;tent with the Doctrine they oppo&s;e, from this Topick of a general Will: And they can't allow it to include &s;o much as a real Pur|po&s;e, that all &s;hall be &s;anctified and &s;aved; becau&s;e then all would be &s;o; which is contrary to Fact: Or el&s;e God's Purpo&s;e would be fru&s;trated, and he would come &s;hort of what he certainly intended &s;hould come to pa&s;s, which is highly ab&s;urd. But they &s;eem to
<PB N="60" REF="004896_0060_100E158032280AC8">fancy a Sort of an unea&s;y Wi&s;hing and longing De&s;ire in God, for that which notwith&s;tanding will never be; and if this be not to make God &s;uch a One as our&s;elves, I know not what is: Does it no argue God to be &s;ubject to the Weakne&s;&s;es of Creatures? and not only &s;o, but that he &s;uffers him&s;elf to be made unea&s;y, and to be cro&s;s'd in his De&s;ires, by that which he could ea&s;ily prevent? which is what no wi&s;e Man would allow in him&s;elf: And therefore, tho' God may &s;ometimes conde&s;cend to &s;peak to Sinners in &s;uch Lan|guage as they u&s;e to one another, when they would ex|pre&s;s the Greatne&s;s and Ardency of their De&s;ire for any thing; yet we are not hence to imagine, that there are any &s;uch human Pa&s;&s;ions and Creature-Weak|ne&s;&s;es in him: The De&s;ign of &s;uch Modes of &s;peaking in God is only to &s;ignify, how de&s;irable and excellent a Thing it is, in it&s;elf, for Creatures to love, to obey and honour him; and how much it is both their Duty and Intere&s;t to do &s;o: And the Rea&s;on why this is expre&s;s'd in &s;uch a Manner, as imports weak Pa&s;&s;ions in Men when they &s;peak &s;o, is, becau&s;e it is the mo&s;t &s;uitable Way of Dealing with &s;uch Creatures as we are, be&s;t adapted to our Capacity and Condition; it is a Method that has the mo&s;t &s;uitable Tendency in it&s;elf to work upon and prevail with rational Creatures, ex|pre&s;&s;ing be&s;t to their Capacity the Excellency and Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Holine&s;s, and the horrid hateful Nature of Sin; for tho' it is the &s;uper-natural Power of God's Spirit, that prevails with any Sinners to be holy; yet, as a wi&s;e Agent, he makes u&s;e of the mo&s;t &s;uitable and be&s;t adapted Means for that Purpo&s;e, dealing with Men in a Way &s;uited to their rational Nature, and human Capacities. Thus it is we are to under&s;tand the various Expo&s;tulations and Entreaties of God in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>As another Topick of Argument again&s;t the Doc|trine of God's <HI>Decrees,</HI> the Oppo&s;ers of it &s;eem to

<PB N="62" REF="004896_0062_100E158578EB51D0">his Power of Obedience, that is no Argument, that God mu&s;t lo&s;e his Right and Claim: The Creature's Sin, and Wretchedne&s;s thereby, can't di&s;&s;olve his Ob|ligations of Duty to God: God's Law mu&s;t &s;till re|main the &s;ame, as a perfect and eternal Rule of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, let Creatures change and alter as they will. If it be a&s;k'd, <HI>For what End the Law of God is &s;et be|fore us, and his Commands laid upon us in his Word, if we have not Ability to fulfil?</HI> I an&s;wer, <HI>For various Ends:</HI> To teach us what is our Duty to God; what we ought to be aiming at and endeavouring after: To &s;hew us our Sins and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; <HI>For by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin,</HI> Rom. iii. 20. as the Crooked|ne&s;s of a Line is di&s;cover'd by laying it to a &s;trait one: To teach us our utter Inability fo fulfil the Law, and obtain Life by our Obedience; (for which Purpo&s;e our Saviour referr'd One to the <HI>Keeping of the Command|ment,</HI> Matth. xix. 17. whom he found big with the Conceit that he could do much) that &s;o we may &s;ee our Nece&s;&s;ity of getting Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Strength from Chri&s;t, a Mediator: And thus the Law is given, as a School-Ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t; it is a Means whereby the Lord brings in his Elect to the Redeemer by Faith: And it is given as a Rule of Life to the re|new'd Children of God, to direct them how they are to honour and glorify him.</P>
<P>If it be objected to the above Account, of Sinners <HI>Inability</HI> to do what is now requir'd of them under the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the new Covenant, that <HI>Adam</HI> had not a Power of Believing in a Redeemer, of repenting and renewing his Heart, as having no need of it; and the Exerci&s;e of it being incon&s;i&s;tent with his State of In|nocence; and therefore we cannot be &s;aid to have lo&s;t it in him, &s;eeing it was not given him while he &s;tood in the Character of our <HI>Repre&s;entative.</HI> To this i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may be ea&s;ily reply'd, That tho' he had not his Power for &s;uch Acts and Purpo&s;es as the&s;e, in his innocent

The Impo&s;&s;ibility of his putting forth &s;uch Acts, was not from the Want of inherent Power, but the Incon&s;i&s;tency of them with his Condition: It was incon&s;i&s;tent with his State of Innocence, to have had any Occa&s;ion for admini&s;|tring Phy&s;ick, to recover his Health; yet that is no Argument, that he had not <HI>&s;ufficient Ability</HI> for it.</P>
<P>I would ju&s;t farther refer it to the Con&s;ideration of tho&s;e, who offer this Argument again&s;t God's <HI>Decrees,</HI> and yet, in the mean time, acknowledge, that <HI>no Man in this Life can fulfil the Law of God perfectly,</HI> how they are con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves: For herein them|&s;elves acknowledge, that <HI>God requires more of Men, than they can now perform, &s;ince the Fall;</HI> and &s;ure they will not own, that <HI>it is &s;o,</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>it is unju&s;t</HI> too.</P>
<P>For farther Proof of this <HI>Univer&s;al Power</HI> or <HI>Grace,</HI> they urge the Invitations of the Go&s;pel to believe in Chri&s;t, and its Promi&s;es to &s;uch as do believe; &s;uch as <HI>I&s;al.</HI> xlv. 22. <HI>Look unto me, and be ye &s;aved, all the Ends of the Earth:</HI> And <HI>Rev.</HI> iii. 20. <HI>Behold, I &s;tand at the Door, and knock; if any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, &amp;c.</HI> Such Invita|tions, they think, infer, that there is a Power in Man to comply with them, otherwi&s;e they would be vain and needle&s;s. But this is a vain Argument; For tho' Sinners are without Strength, thro' the Darkne&s;s of their Minds, and Ob&s;tinacy of their Wills; yet &s;uch Invitations are needful, to &s;hew them their Duty, and the only Way in which they can ever be happy; and to afford them a Ground and Warrant for believing in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and re&s;ting their Souls upon him for Sal|vation: By the&s;e Invitations, and Promi&s;es to Believ|ing, the holy Spirit encourages, and per&s;uades con|vinced Souls to clo&s;e with Chri&s;t, as their Saviour, and ca&s;t them&s;elves upon his Meditation and Attone|ment,
<PB N="64" REF="004896_0064_100E15895AB62A50">with humble joyful Confidence. The Spirit of God, by his Power, brings a Sinner to believe in Chri&s;t, in a Way agreeable to his Nature as a rea&s;on|able Creature; and &s;o makes u&s;e of the Offers and Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, as the Soul's Warrant for lay|ing Claim to Chri&s;t, as his Saviour, and believing in him for his Salvation. Likewi&s;e, the&s;e Invitations and Promi&s;es are of great u&s;e for the Comfort of true Believers, &s;hewing that there is a &s;ure Connection be|tween Believing and Salvation. When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tells the People of <HI>I&s;rael, Deut.</HI> xxx. 19. <HI>That he had &s;et Life and Death before them, Ble&s;&s;ing and Cur&s;ing,</HI> and bids them <HI>chu&s;e Life;</HI> The Words may be ea&s;ily under&s;tood in the &s;ame Sen&s;e with the fore-mention'd Pa&s;&s;ages, to &s;ignify, that there is a certain and in&s;eparable Connec|tion between true Holine&s;s and eternal Life, tho' this Holine&s;s is the Effect of a &s;uper-natural divine Power, exerted only <HI>in whom the Lord plea&s;es:</HI> And the Lord propo&s;es this Holine&s;s, which is connected with Hap|pine&s;s, to Sinners Choice, to import the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of their chu&s;ing it; and that he may deal with them in a Way agreeable to the Nature of rea&s;onable Beings. But yet, I think it is plain from the Context, that the <HI>Life and Death</HI> there &s;po|ken of, was <HI>temporal Pro&s;perity and Adver&s;ity;</HI> which Life was promi&s;ed to <HI>that</HI> People, upon their &s;trict Adherence to the outward Pre&s;criptions of the Law that was given them: And it will be readily own'd that they might thus chu&s;e and perform Obedience without <HI>&s;pecial renewing Grace:</HI> And, in this Sen&s;e, <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Life</HI> are to be frequently under&s;tood in the Old Te&s;tament.</P>

<P>Again, they argue in another Method from the ge|neral Calls, Invitations, and Offers of the Go&s;pel, rea&s;oning after this Manner: <HI>It would,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>be the highe&s;t In&s;tance of Di&s;&s;embling and Deccit, for God to call Sinners to repent and turn from their evil Ways,
<PB N="67" REF="004896_0067_100E158FC9BD7050">with &s;uch Appearance of real Sincerity and Earne&s;tane&s;s, if he had before infallibly decreed, that a great many of them &s;hould not repent and turn</HI> (not to communicate the Grace of Conver&s;ion and Repentance to many, it &s;hould be.) <HI>And what greater In&s;incerity and Illu&s;ion,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>can well be imagin'd, than for God to make &s;uch a general, unlimited Offer of Chri&s;t, and Salvation thro' him, as</HI> Rev. xxii. 17.

<P>But all this plau&s;ible Rea&s;oning, on which &s;ome of the greate&s;t Patrons of the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme be&s;tow a great Deal of Eloquence, is grounded on a mi&s;taken Apprehen&s;ion of the Nature and true Import of the&s;e <HI>Calls and Go&s;pel-Offers:</HI> God's Calls to Sinners, to <HI>re|pent and turn to him, to believe in Chri&s;t, &amp;c.</HI> are only &s;o many Significations of what is Sinners Duty, and what is agreeable to God's holy Nature, plea&s;ing and approveable in his Sight: The&s;e <HI>Calls</HI> do not &s;ignify what is God's <HI>Purpo&s;e</HI> concerning Men, but what is their Duty to him; and that he loves Holine&s;s in his Creatures, that <HI>the righteous Lord loves Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> And &s;o, in all &s;uch Calls and Commands, there is an entire Agreement between God's Words, and his Will &s;ignify'd by them: For he does indeed <HI>will the&s;e Things,</HI> as the Matter of Sinners Duty, and loves them, as agreeable to his own holy Law.

<P>As to the Offers of Chri&s;t made to all where the Go&s;pel comes, and Promi&s;es of Salvation, thro' him, to all &s;uch as truly believe in him: It is mo&s;t certain, that God does will and purpo&s;e to &s;ave all &s;uch as truly accept of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and believe in him, as he is propos'd and &s;et forth, in the Go&s;pel Revelation of him; for he declares, that <HI>all &s;uch &s;hall be &s;aved:</HI> But then, we are to con&s;ider this Faith in Chri&s;t as <HI>the Gi&s;t of God,</HI> according to <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 8. and a Grace of his <HI>powerful Operation or Working,</HI> Col. ii. 12. <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 19. 2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> i. 11. be&s;tow'd <HI>only</HI> upon, and wrought <HI>only</HI> in tho&s;e whom he has <HI>cho&s;en;</HI> and there|fore called <HI>the Faith of God's Elect,</HI> Tit. i. 1. And thus, the <HI>Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel</HI> run exactly parallel with the <HI>Election of Grace,</HI> and do not import any thing contrary to it. Indeed, to &s;ay, that God does <HI>not</HI> really de&s;ign ro &s;ave <HI>all</HI> who &s;hall believe in Chri&s;t, not with&s;tanding he has declar'd that <HI>he will,</HI> were to impute the <HI>gro&s;&s;e&s;t Fal&s;hood and Deceit</HI> to him; but there is no &s;uch Thing in the <HI>Doctrine</HI> which the Ar|gument is brought again&s;t. It is true, the <HI>Offer</HI> of Chri&s;t, as a Saviour, is <HI>made to all,</HI> to be accepted and believed in, for their Salvation in particular, where|ever the News of the Go&s;pel-Salvation is &s;ent: But then, this <HI>Offer</HI> does not &s;ignify or import, that God de&s;ign'd him, and the &s;aving Benefits of his Death, <HI>equally for all;</HI> but that, ina&s;much as all have <HI>equal Need</HI> of him, and God has not reveal'd, or any Way pointed out who they are, whom he has <HI>not cho&s;en</HI> to Salvation thro' him, &s;o as they might be known either to them&s;elves or others, it is the great Duty of <HI>all,</HI> to accept of him with <HI>all their Hearts,</HI> according to the
<PB N="69" REF="004896_0069_100E1594E8AD21B8">Declarations concerning him in the Go&s;pel, <HI>freely and willingly</HI> to comply with the Way of Salvation thro' his Attonement, ca&s;ting a fiducial Dependance upon him, <HI>and him only,</HI> for their eternal Life; for which Faith, the infallible Promi&s;e of Salvation, to all &s;uch as &s;o receive him, is &s;ufficient Warrant and Encou|ragement. And it was nece&s;&s;ary that the <HI>Offer</HI> &s;hould be thus <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> when it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not reveal'd, who in particular <HI>were elected</HI> to Salvation thro' him, that &s;o the <HI>Elect</HI> might be brought to believe in him, upon a rational Ground and Foundation; for they could not know, that they <HI>were cho&s;en</HI> to Life, thro him, more than any others, before their Believing; and therefore, could not have had a Ground for Faith to go upon, were it not for the Promi&s;e to <HI>who&s;oever believes,</HI> and the Declarations, that it is <HI>every one's Duty</HI> cordially to comply, and be plea&s;ed with that Way of Salvation, thro' an attoning Mediator; and upon the Encourage|ment of this Promi&s;e, to ca&s;t a Reliance, and the whole Dependance of their Souls, for Salvation, upon him. In this Manner it is, that the <HI>Offers of Chri&s;t</HI> in the Go&s;pel, are <HI>general and univer&s;al:</HI> Not importing, that <HI>he died alike for all,</HI> or that he was <HI>equally de&s;ign'd for all,</HI> in the Purpo&s;e of God; but that, &s;eeing <HI>none</HI> have any Rea&s;on certainly to conclude again&s;t them|&s;elves, that they were <HI>rejected</HI> in the divine Purpo&s;e; and &s;eeing <HI>Acceptance and eternal Life,</HI> thro' Chri&s;t, is promis' to <HI>all</HI> that believe; it is the Duty of <HI>all,</HI> with their whole Hearts, to <HI>embrace</HI> him as he is propos'd, and <HI>believe</HI> in him: And yet, <HI>none</HI> will &s;o believe in him but the <HI>Cho&s;en of God, who are called according to his Purpo&s;e.</HI> And thus, as God is entirely con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf in the Ca&s;e, &s;o are the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, in maintaining God's <HI>ab&s;olute Decrees,</HI> and yet making &s;uch general Offers of Chri&s;t, as a Saviour, to all that hear them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alling upon them to accept of and believe in him,
<PB N="70" REF="004896_0070_100E15967857CC30">u&s;ing Arguments with them for that Purpo&s;e, and promi&s;ing Life and Salvation, in his Name, to all that truly comply with the Go&s;pel, and believe in him: And tho' they don't know the <HI>Elect of God</HI> among their Hearers, he does, and will apply this Go&s;pel to their Hearts, &s;o as to bring them to believe in Chri&s;t, and become <HI>truly godly.</HI> The&s;e Con&s;iderations, if duly weighed and attended to, I think, may be abundantly &s;atisfactory in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>There is another Argument, commonly in&s;i&s;ted on by tho&s;e on the other Side of the Que&s;tion, taken from God's Appointment of a Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, Ordinances of Wor&s;hip, and Means of Grace in his Church, as if they were <HI>altogether vain and u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> on Suppo&s;ition of &s;uch <HI>eternal Decrees.

<P>This is an awful Charge indeed; and if it be ju&s;t, the Doctrine is certainly mo&s;t in&s;ufferable; which takes off all Re&s;traints from the mo&s;t profligate Cour&s;e of Life, farther than what proceed from our temporal Intere&s;t in this World; and Arguments from private temporal Intere&s;t, do often &s;way more to the mo&s;t in|human Crimes, than moral Hone&s;ty. But I hope to make it appear, that the Objection is <HI>mo&s;t fal&s;e and groundle&s;s:</HI> And to this Purpo&s;e, let the&s;e few Things be con&s;ider'd:</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="004896_0071_100E1599C354E3D8">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Suppo&s;ing there were no Arguments for a pious godly Life, to be had from our own eternal In|tere&s;t; yet there are Rea&s;ons of another Nature, of &s;ufficient Weight and Force in them&s;elves, to induce us to it, and engage us to endeavour after it. Is not the great God, who is infinitely good and glorious, worthy of the greate&s;t E&s;teem, profounde&s;t Subjection, and highe&s;t Adorations of all the rational Creation? And has he not an inviolable Right and Claim to the&s;e Things from us, as our Creator and Pre&s;erver? And is not Conformity to God, and to obey and honour him, the greate&s;t Honour and Glory of a created Be|ing? The&s;e Arguments, I know, have little Weight with apo&s;tate Creatures, who&s;e Under&s;tandings are darkned, and all their other Faculties wholly corrupted; but that is not for Want of &s;ufficient Weight in their own Nature: Nothing can ever di&s;&s;olve God's Title to the Homage and Obedience of his Creatures.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I would have two or three Particulars con|&s;ider'd and weigh'd together: Fir&s;t, that the <HI>Elect</HI> are elected to Salvation, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit; <HI>whom he did prede&s;tinate, them be al&s;o called.</HI> And this effectual Calling and &s;anctifying Grace, wrought in the heart by the holy Spirit, is the certain Fruit and Evidence of eternal Election; whereby tho&s;e who are the Partakers of this Grace, may, and frequently do come to a comfortable Satisfation, as to their Election of God.</P>
<P>Again, you are to ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Elect</HI> them&s;elves, before their Conver&s;ion and effectual Calling, have no Notices or Evidences at all of their being elected, more than others: which mu&s;t needs be a very unea&s;y and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Condition, when the Spirit of God touches the Con&s;cience. And then, in the next Place, let it be con&s;ider'd, that God has appointed the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, and other religious Exerci&s;es, &s;uch as, reading the holy Scriptures, and other good Books,
<PB N="72" REF="004896_0072_100DEFA997760310">Prayer, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> to be the Means whereby be ordinarily converts and &s;anctifies his <HI>Elect,</HI> and affords them the comfortable Tokens of his electing Love. He has appointed the&s;e Ordinances and Means, as the ordina|ry Channels wherein to communicate his &s;pecial Grace to tho&s;e whom he has cho&s;en. Now if the&s;e Things be duly adverted to, I think it will be clear, that there is U&s;e, and great U&s;e too, for the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, and other Exerci&s;es of Religion, in a Con|&s;i&s;tancy with God's <HI>ab&s;olute Decrees:</HI> And that there are &s;ufficient Rea&s;on, to engage Per&s;ons to a very care|ful Ob&s;ervance of them, and of all the Commands of God; for the Ordinances of God are the Means which he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es fit in his Wi&s;dom to make u&s;e of, for the Con|ver&s;ion and Sanctification of his Elect, which Work of Grace is the only Evidence of our belonging to God, as his elect People: And therefore one can hard|ly think, that any, but &s;uch as are &s;tupidly unconcern|ed about their Souls everla&s;ting States, could rea&s;on in earne&s;t in the Strain of the Objection I am now upon: Surely, one that is any Way duly thoughtful, about a Matter of &s;uch va&s;t Moment as his eternal Well-being, would readily think with him&s;elf to this Purpo&s;e; <Q>Oh, what would I not give, to have &s;ome comfortable, di&s;tingui&s;hing Evidences of being cho&s;en of God, and appointed to Life: Well, his Ways and Ordi|nances are the Means he u&s;es for this Purpo&s;e; the Channels in which he is wont to communicate his &s;pecial Grace to tho&s;e he de&s;igns to &s;ave; I mu&s;t wait upon, and look to him in that Way of Hope, and keep at the Pool where he u&s;es to come and heal di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed Souls; it may be, he will-&s;ome time meet with me, in his own Way, which he has appointed for vi&s;iting his cho&s;en, and fulfil in me all the Good-Plea&s;ure of his Goodne&s;s, and the Work of Faith with Power, and cau&s;e me to rejoice in his Love. The&s;e Ways of Religion are not only the Ways in
<PB N="73" REF="004896_0073_100E159DA6E97CA0">which there is only rea&s;onable Ground of Hope to meet with &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings, but they are the Commands and In&s;titutions of God, recommended with his aw|ful Authority; and therefore, to di&s;regard and neg|lect them, will be to di&s;obey and contemn God &s;till the more, and al&s;o will expo&s;e me to a more awful Puni&s;hment.</Q> Con&s;ider now, if this be not a ju&s;t and right Way of Rea&s;oning in the Ca&s;e: Nay, I am convinced, that the <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> Doctrine, rightly under|&s;tood, and really believ'd, will make People much more careful, &s;erious and diligent Ob&s;ervers of the Ways of God, than the contrary Doctrine will; for it tends much more to bring them to a &s;olemn &s;olici|tous Concern of Heart about their eternal State, and con&s;equently to make them more earne&s;t in all the mo&s;t hopeful, probable Ways of meeting with Satisfac|tion about it.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Tho' it is true, that &s;uch as are rejected in the Purpo&s;e of God, will never be converted in the U&s;e of all the Means of Grace; yet, &s;eeing they do not know the &s;ecret Purpo&s;e of God concerning them, but have the &s;ame Rea&s;on to entertain Hopes that they may be cho&s;en to Life, that any other unconverted Per&s;ons have, it would be a high and provoking Con|tempt of God for them, to neglect the Ordinances, which he has appointed as Means, for the communica|ting &s;pecial Grace and &s;weet Con&s;olation to his Elect; and which he therefore, by his &s;overeign Authority, requires all, who have the Opportunity, to attend upon: And they &s;hall find it, if guilty of it, brought into the Account again&s;t them, at the great Day, when <HI>every Man &s;hall be judged according to his Works,</HI> and they &s;hall receive, proportionably, the <HI>greater Puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> As to the <HI>Elect converted,</HI> their Hearts are &s;o renew'd, as <HI>to love God above all,</HI> and to make Obe|dience to his Will their hearty Choice; Believing in
<PB N="74" REF="004896_0074_100E15A011FE7DB8">Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his Love is &s;hed abroad in their Hearts, and &s;weetly con&s;trains them to &s;erve and honour him, to whom they are under &s;uch endearing Engagements. The COn&s;ideration of Go's having elected them to eternal Glory, when he might ju&s;tly have rejected them as well as any others; the Hope and Pro&s;pect of that eternal Glory with him, and the Con&s;ideration of his having &s;ent his Son to an&s;wer the Law for them, and &s;uffer in their Room, that they might be deliver'd from de&s;erved Mi&s;ery, and made happy in the Enjoy|ment of him&s;elf forever; their Apprehen&s;ions of his Glory and infinite Excellency in him&s;elf, and his Right in and over them as his Creatures; all the&s;e Things are powerful Arguments with them, to love and prai&s;e God; it is their De&s;ire and Delight to glorify and ho|nour him. Moreover, the Lord Je&s;us takes them for his peculiar Charge; it is a Part of his Office, as Me|diator, to bring them &s;afe to Glory thro' all Dangers; accordingly, his holy Spirit dwells in them, as a Sanc|tifier and Comforter: thus they are engaged to God, in the Way of Holine&s;s, by the mo&s;t inviolable Cords and loving Bands: So that the Doctrine of <HI>ab&s;olute Election</HI> is far from de&s;troying Holine&s;s of Life: It is a &s;trong Excitement to it, in all the renew'd Children of God, who love him, when they are enabled to &s;ee the hopeful Evidences of their own Election. And therefore, &s;uch as &s;ay (as &s;ome, no le&s;s wickedly than fooli&s;hly, do) that <HI>if they were per&s;uaded of the Truth of the Doctrine of</HI> Prede&s;tination, <HI>they would never be at any Pains or Care to &s;erve God more,</HI> had ju&s;t as good &s;ay plainly, <HI>they have no Love to God,</HI> and that <HI>they are entire Strangers to the Nature of true Godline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Con&s;ider, the Method of Rea&s;oning in the Objection, is &s;uch as you would not allow to be ju&s;t, in other Ca&s;es of the like Nature. Can you think, it would have been ju&s;t Rea&s;oning in King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> to &s;ay, that <HI>becau&s;e the Lord had ordain'd he &s;hould live
<PB N="75" REF="004896_0075_100E15A19654F6F8">Fifteen Years longer</HI> (2 Kin. xx. 6.) <HI>he had no more need of either Food or Phy&s;ick?</HI> The Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> was of another Mind, when he ordered <HI>a Lump of Figs to be laid to the Boil,</HI> ver. 7. This &s;hews us, that God brings about his Purpo&s;es in the U&s;e of &s;uitable Means, and that it is therefore nece&s;&s;ary for us to ob&s;erve them. Was ever anything more ab&s;olutely and po|&s;itively fix'd in the Purpo&s;e of God, than the Time and Manner of Chri&s;t's Death? <HI>John</HI> vii. 30. &amp; viii. 20. &amp; xii. 32, 33. Was he therefore unwi&s;e for u&s;ing any Means for his Pre&s;ervation from the Hands of his Enemies? Of which we have frequent In&s;tan|ces, <HI>Joh.</HI> viii. 59. <HI>Luk.</HI> iv. 29, 30. <HI>Joh.</HI> xi. 53, 54. Was St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, when, tho' God had told him, that both he and all that were in the Ship with him, &s;hould be &s;aved thro' all the Ha|zards of their Voyage; yet, when the Ship-men were about to go off in the Boat and leave the re&s;t in the Di&s;tre&s;s, he &s;aid to them, <HI>except the&s;e abide in the Ship, ye cannot be &s;aved?</HI> Acts xxvii. In like Manner, it may be as truly and rea&s;onably &s;aid, that <HI>except the Elect be converted and &s;anctified, they cannot be &s;aved from Hell;</HI> becau&s;e of the certain Connection God has made between the Means and the End. And none have any Rea&s;on to expect <HI>converting Grace,</HI> while they prophanely neglect the <HI>Means of Grace.</HI></P>
<P>As to the latter Clau&s;e of the Objection, that <HI>the Non-elect, who have had the Opportunity of the Go&s;pel, will be more mi&s;erable than if they had not:</HI> I an&s;wer, It is very likely it will be &s;o, with the mo&s;t of them: But then, I think, if they improv'd the Go&s;pel, as they might do, tho' they would not be converted and &s;aved by it, yet they would not be the more, but per|haps the le&s;s mi&s;erable for it. If it be enquir'd, <HI>For what End the Go&s;pel is &s;ent to &s;uch as God has not pur|pos'd to &s;ave?</HI> I an&s;wer, It is chiefly for <HI>the Elect's Sake</HI> that are among them; that thereby they may
<PB N="76" REF="004896_0076_100E15A40C2A8850">be brought in to Chri&s;t, and prepar'd for the heavenly Glory.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude the An&s;wer to the whole Ob|jection with a <HI>general Remark</HI> or two. Seeing the Doctrine, in it&s;elf, does not take away our Obligations to a religious Life, but affords &s;ufficient Motives and Arguments for it, then it is no Argument again&s;t the Truth of the Doctrine, tho' &s;ome ungodly Men &s;hould abu&s;e it to a Liberty to &s;in: Other Doctrines of the Go&s;pel are liable to the &s;ame abu&s;e, as well as this. Thus St. <HI>Paul</HI> ob&s;erves, that &s;ome might be ready to infer from the Go&s;pel-Doctrine of <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> as he laid it down, that they might <HI>continue in Sin, that Grace might abound,</HI> Rom. vi. 1. That &s;ome would be ready to object again&s;t him, that he made <HI>Chri&s;t the Mini&s;tor of Sin,</HI> i.e. one that gave Liberty and En|couragement to Sin, <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 17. And that &s;ome did actually affirm that he &s;aid, <HI>Let us do Evil, that Good may come,</HI> Rom. iii. 8. Again, The Lord Je&s;us, who came to <HI>de&s;troy the Works of the Devil,</HI> and purcha&s;e to him&s;elf <HI>a peculiar People, zealous of good Works,</HI> will have his End; tho' &s;ome Men, of corrupt Minds, &s;hould abu&s;e his Truth, to the awful Aggravation of their Guilt in the Day of his appearing. And I think we have little Encouragement, to go to the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme for the Advancement to true practical Reli|gion, if we confider what Advancement this Way, it has produced &s;ince it came in Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>What is farther brought as an Objection, by &s;ome, I think is hardly worth taking Notice of, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>&s;ome will be apt to take Occa&s;ion, from the Doctrine of</HI> Prede&s;tination, <HI>to live in a &s;lothful Negligence and Secu|rity, from a Pre&s;umption that they are elected, and &s;o cannot mi&s;s of Salvation:</HI> And <HI>others will be apt to fall into De&s;pair, from a fearful Apprehen&s;ion, that they are not elected.</HI> As I hinted already, we are to <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h</HI> between the <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> unrea&s;onably made of a Doctrine,
<PB N="77" REF="004896_0077_100E15A6627FDD08">and its <HI>natural Tendency,</HI> in it&s;elf: And that is there in this Doctrine, that leads to either of the&s;e <HI>wide Ex|treams?</HI> How can it lead any to a <HI>groundle&s;s Pre&s;ump|tion</HI> and <HI>&s;lothful Negligence;</HI> when, according to it, none have. Rea&s;on to per&s;uade them&s;elves <HI>they are elected,</HI> until they are renew'd and &s;anctify'd; and then they cannot be carele&s;s about the Honour and Obedience due to God? <HI>How &s;hall they that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?</HI> Rom. vi. 2. All the Go&s;pel-Argu|ments to a Life of Holine&s;s, and this of their Election among the re&s;t, do then effectually engage their Hearts to it. Indeed, if they knew their Election before their Conver&s;ion, before they believ'd in Chri&s;t and lov'd God, no doubt they would abu&s;e it to Sloth and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, till God chang'd their Hearts: But they have no &s;ure Evidence of their Election till they are brought to a better Di&s;po&s;ition. And how can it bring any to <HI>De&s;peration,</HI> when they <HI>cannot</HI> know that they are <HI>not elected?</HI> For Per&s;ons to conclude po&s;itively, that <HI>they are appointed to De&s;truction,</HI> is to conclude without Rea&s;on, and Pretending to know the un|reveal'd Secrets of God's Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Some think the Words of the Lord Je&s;us, <HI>Luke</HI> xix. 42. are contrary to this Doctrine; where he &s;ays of <HI>Jeru&s;alem, If thou had&s;t known, in this thy Day, the Things that belong to thy Peace! but now they are hid from thine Eyes.</HI> Which Words, they &s;uppo&s;e, im|port, that the Inhabitants of the City had, before that Time, had &s;uch inward A&s;&s;i&s;tance from God, as put it in their Power to convert them&s;elves; but which were then forever withdrawn from them, for their A|bu&s;e of them, &s;o that their Ca&s;e was then beyond all Hope. And in this &s;ame Sen&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>all Men have a Day of Grace,</HI> in &s;ome Part of their Life, or, as they rather chu&s;e to term it, <HI>a Day of Vi&s;itation.</HI> But this Opinion is without any Foundation in the Text: How can the Words &s;ignify, that their Day
<PB N="78" REF="004896_0078_100E15A7E64C0BF0">there &s;poken of, was a Time in which they had &s;uffi|cient inward Grace; when they clearly imply, that they did not &s;o much as know the Things that be|long'd to their Peace in that Day? The true Import of our Lord's Words is, That they had had, in that outward Means of Conviction, that he was the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah;</HI> &s;ufficient to prevail with them, as rational Creatures, to acknowledge and own him as &s;uch; not|with&s;tanding of which, they rejected and per&s;ecuted him, and would, in a little Time put him to Death; for which they &s;hould, before long, be puni&s;h'd with utter Ruin, both of their City and Nation, as it fol|lows lows in the next Words. And &s;o the Words al&s;o &s;ig|nify, that there was le&s;s Probabilty and rea&s;onable Hope of their being converted to God, after all &s;uch Means had been &s;o long quite lo&s;t upon them, than there was before, according to God's ordinary Way of Working.</P>
<P>And now I have gone thro' all the contrary Argu|ments and Objections, of any Con&s;equence, that I know of; and upon the whole, mu&s;t de&s;ire the careful Reader, &s;eriou&s;ly to look back and con&s;ider, if the Doctrine of <HI>ab&s;olute Prede&s;timation,</HI> as it has been &s;tated and repre&s;ented, be not entirely agreable to Rea&s;on, clearly founded on Scripture, and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with every Part of it, and con&s;equently a mo&s;t certain Truth of God. Let us not be wilfully re&s;olved again&s;t admitting rea&s;onable Evidence, but <HI>quit our&s;elves like Men,</HI> and u&s;e our Under&s;tandings, with humble Ap|plication to God, on whom all Creatures are dependant, for a right Judgment and a &s;ound Mind. Don't &s;ay, you won't believe it, ju&s;t becau&s;e you don't like it: That is both the Shame and Crime of a rea&s;onable Be|ing; and the greate&s;t Folly in the World; for if it be a Truth, it will be &s;o, whether you like it and believe it, or not. And let us al&s;o con&s;ider, what is the pro|per U&s;e, and native Tendency of the Doctrine: And
<PB N="79" REF="004896_0079_100E15AA56D707D8">&s;o, let us humbly lie low, as guilty Criminals, before the Foot-&s;tool of God's Sovereignty, acknowledging his Right to <HI>di&s;po&s;e of us,</HI> for Life or Death, <HI>as he plea&s;es.</HI> Let us not be &s;tupidly ea&s;y in our Minds, without the Experience of &s;upernatural, &s;anctifying Grace in our Hearts, the only Evidence of our Elec|tion, and Mean of &s;olid Comfort, <HI>without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> Let us &s;eek and long for it, in all the Ways of God's Commands and Ordinances, where it is mo&s;t likely to be found; and not trea&s;ure up greater Loads of Wrath to our&s;elves, again&s;t the Day of Wrath, by Di&s;obedience to the great Law|giver's Authority. Let &s;uch of us, as God has given the Tokens of his &s;pecial Love unto, in our Sanctifica|tion, give the <HI>Glory and Prai&s;e to him alone:</HI> And &s;till endeavour, to live an&s;werable to the Obligations of &s;uch wonderful, di&s;tingui&s;hing Love and Grace. Let us give up all Confidence of our own Ability, and De|pendance on our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s and good Doings, to entitle us to Happine&s;s; ca&s;ting our&s;elves only on the Mediation and Attonement of the Son of God, as he is reveal'd and propos'd in the Go&s;pel; &s;eeking for that living Faith in him that brings Joy and Peace to the Soul, that works by Love and the free&s;t Obedience. Such as the&s;e are the Things, which this Doctrine na|turally leads to; and &s;o, it agrees to the great De&s;ign of God in the <HI>New-Covenant,</HI> the Illu&s;tration of the great|e&s;t Glory of his <HI>Free Grace,</HI> in the Salvation of guilty Sinners: Whereas the contrary Scheme defaces and &s;inks it down: But God will have the Glory, and it's &s;it he &s;hou'd: The whole Glory, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, he has &s;ecur'd to him&s;elf.
