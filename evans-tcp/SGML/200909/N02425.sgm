<HEAD>THE Voice of the LORD, FROM <HI>The deep Places of the Earth.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM XCV. 4, 7, &amp; 8th Ver&s;es.</HI></BIBL>
<P>IN his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth&mdash;To day, if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocation, and in the day of Temptation in the Wilderne&s;s.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>REASON or Thought is that excellent Power in Man, by which he is nearly ally'd to the Angelick World, and advanc'd above the Level of &s;en&s;itive Beings here below. 'Tis one e&s;&s;ential Character of the Divine Image in|&s;tamp'd on Man at his Creation: and as the regular Exerci&s;e of this noble Power is one of the brighte&s;t Ornaments of Humanity, &s;o the highe&s;t and be&s;t <HI>Object</HI> of our Knowlege and Contemplation is the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD, whom to know is Life eternal. But then as the Glory of GOD is very con&s;picuou&s;ly di&s;play'd in the things which his Hand hath formed; &s;o his <HI>Crea|tures</HI> and <HI>Works,</HI> with the greate&s;t Ju&s;tice, challenge a Room in our Thoughts, and demand our deliberate Attention to them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002874_0005_0FE6802DD1BBFE48">AS the Works of Nature &amp; Grace, &s;o the Works of Providence, are to be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider'd by us, if we would &s;hew our &s;elves Men. <HI>Who is wi&s;e, and he will ob&s;erve the&s;e Things: Prudent, and he &s;hall know them?</HI> The Works of the Lord are great; &s;ought out of all Them that have Plea&s;ure therein. Remem|ber then that thou magnify his Works which Men behold. To con&s;ider them indeed in their E&s;&s;ence and natural Cau&s;es &amp; Properties, is not &s;o much the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Chri&s;tian, as the Philo&s;opher. But the &s;ame things which are the Subjects of <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> do under different Re&s;pects, as they are referred to their Efficient, and Final Cau&s;e, al&s;o come into Con|&s;ideration in <HI>Divinity.</HI> &mdash; Hence the Scriptures do every where lead us into Contemplations on the Works of Nature, and various <HI>Phaenomena</HI> or Events that come to pa&s;s in the World, <HI>as the Works of GOD;</HI> who&s;e <Q>Efficiency runs thro' &amp; influences all Second Cau&s;es, and enters into every Effect; pre&s;erves the Being and Powers of all the Creatures, and directs all their motions thorow all and above all their next inferiour Ends, to GOD him&s;elf as the la&s;t End of all.</Q>
<HI>Of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all Things; to Whom be Glory for ever.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctrine of a Divine Providence, whereby the va&s;t Variety of Creatures and Things in the Univer&s;e, are powerfully upheld in their Exi&s;tence, Operation, and beautiful Order, and wi&s;ely directed to the &s;everal Ends and U&s;es they were made for; is one of the fir&s;t Dictates of Rea&s;on, &amp; abundantly confirm'd by Revela|tion, which teaches us the unlimited Extent of almigh|ty Providence, unfolds many My&s;teries in the Divine Conduct, and &s;hews us infinite Perfections &amp; Beauties &s;hining in the Works of GOD: &mdash; Calls us to Adora|tion and Prai&s;e, and teaches us to acknowlege GOD in every Appearance and Event, and to con&s;ider the Operations of his Hand, with a &s;utable Application to our &s;elves, and Improvement to the Ends of De|votion; &s;o as not only to &s;ee the Name of GOD written upon every Di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, but al&s;o to hear

his Voice, comport with his wi&s;e De&s;igns, and engage our Hearts in the Love, Fear, and Service of Him, who is over all GOD ble&s;&s;ed for evermore.</P>
<P>THIS Ob&s;ervation is but agreable to the Scope of the <HI>P&s;alm</HI> before us; where the devout <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;tirs up him&s;elf and others to prai&s;e GOD, with a holy Joy and humble Awe, from an affecting Sen&s;e of his infinite Greatne&s;s and Goodne&s;s, and of their &s;pecial Obligati|ons, and Relation to him as a peculiar People: And he calls upon his Nation to live as well as &s;peak the Prai&s;es of GOD, to lend an obedient Ear to his Voice, without which all their Songs of Prai&s;e would be but an Abomination to Him, an empty Sound yea lothe|&s;ome Flattery. And he pre&s;&s;es them to an <HI>in&s;tant</HI> Compliance: <HI>To day if ye will hear his Voice.</HI> &mdash;Some take it as a wi&s;h, O that you would hear his Voice, and be obedient, without delay! And no long|er <HI>harden your hearts,</HI> as they of old in the <HI>Provoca|tion and day of Temptation,</HI> le&s;t you provoke GOD to de&s;troy you by awful Judgments, even as He did them, who&s;e Carca&s;es fell in the Wilderne&s;s, &amp; to whom He &s;ware, they &s;hould not enter into his Re&s;t: So they could not enter in becau&s;e of Unbelief. They were a rebellious and &s;tiffnecked Generation; full of Infidelity, Murmuring, and Di&s;obedience. They &s;aw the Works of GOD, both his Miracles of Mercy and of Judgment; and yet they were not to be wrought up|on by the&s;e things. Neither the Goodne&s;s of GOD in the mo&s;t eminent Deliverances, nor his Severity in tremendous Judgments, whether on their Enemies, or on &s;ome among them&s;elves, wou'd prevail to lead them to Repentance. Particularly when <HI>Korah</HI> and his Company were for their Murmurings de&s;troy'd &s;uddenly by an Earthquake, and devouring Fire, though the Remnant of the People were <HI>affrighted</HI> for the pre&s;ent, and <HI>fled</HI> at the Shrieks of their &s;inking Friends, &s;aying, Le&s;t the Earth &s;wallow us up al&s;o: Neverthele&s;s after Peace was &s;poken to them, we find them the very next day returned unto Folly, and acting over the &s;ame Perver&s;ene&s;s and Unbelief, which
<PB N="4" REF="002874_0007_0FE6802F181F23F0">
their Companions had &s;o awfully peri&s;h'd for. Numb. 16.41. <HI>But on the Morrow all the Congregation of the Children of I&s;rael murmur'd</HI> again. Tho' they had &s;een &s;o many fall before them, yet they wou'd not take warning: Tho' GOD had &s;ignali&s;ed his Goodne&s;s and Patience in reprieving them from de&s;er|ved Perdition, yet they repented not to give Him Glory; but turned his Grace into Wantonne&s;s, and after their Hardne&s;s and impenitent Hearts trea&s;ured up unto them&s;elves Wrath; &s;o that the Plague brake in upon them, and GOD wou'd have con&s;um'd them all as in a Moment, had not <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &amp; <HI>Aaron</HI> fallen on their Faces, and quickly made an Atonement for them.</P>
<P>NOW the&s;e Things were written for our Admoni|tion. Hence the Apo&s;tle writing to the Chri&s;tian <HI>Hebrews,</HI> makes u&s;e of the awful Example of <HI>I&s;rael's</HI> Fall in the Wilderne&s;s, as a loud Caution to them. Heb. 3.7, &amp;c. <HI>Wherefore as the Holy Gho&s;t &s;aith, To Day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocation. &mdash; Take Heed, Bre|thren, le&s;t there be in any of you an evil Heart of Unbelief,. in departing from the living God.</HI> And in the 15th Ver&s;e, he re&s;umes the <HI>Quotation</HI> he had made (which you ob&s;erve is from our <HI>Text</HI>) and he brings home the Words of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> by a par|ticular Application, to the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> he was writing to; as if that Scripture was of equal Concern to the pre&s;ent Generation, as to former Ages. And in the 4th <HI>Chapter</HI> he repeats the Words again, and warns the Chri&s;tian Hebrews to <HI>labour le&s;t any Man fall after the &s;ame Example of Unbelief.</HI> GOD'S Wrath will as &s;oon flame out again&s;t impenitent <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> as again&s;t Unbelieving <HI>Jews;</HI> again&s;t the <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> as well as again&s;t any former Generation of his People; again&s;t his People in <HI>Canaan,</HI> as well as again&s;t his People in the <HI>Wilderne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE then the Admonition in the Text belongs to <HI>Us</HI> in the&s;e Days, as much as to tho&s;e of the P&s;al|mi&s;t's or the Apo&s;tle's Times. And O that the Coun&s;el here given may be acceptable to this People

of GOD! That we may be prevail'd with to give a &s;peedy Attention to the Call of our GOD, who&s;e Voice has been crying to the City and Land in a Variety of awful Providences; and particularly in the late &s;ur|pri&s;ing <HI>Earthquake,</HI> which &s;pread a &s;udden and uni|ver&s;al Terror among us! &mdash; In a mo&s;t calm &s;erene Night, ju&s;t as we were compo&s;ing our &s;elves to Re&s;t, a dreadful Sound &s;truck our Ears, the Earth trembled and our Hou&s;es &s;hook in a fearful manner. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It was on the <HI>Night</HI> after the Lord's Day (<HI>Octob.</HI> 29.) a little more than half an hour pa&s;t <HI>Ten,</HI> that the fir&s;t and great Shake was felt: &mdash; when the Heavens were mo&s;t &s;erene, the Atmo&s;phere in a perfect Calm, and there had been no generally ob&s;erved Pre&s;ages of any &s;uch Event.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay, Before they were &s;en&s;ible of the Shock, they &s;aw <HI>Fla&s;hes</HI> of Light glance by their Windows, and others ob&s;erv'd their Dogs give a &s;udden bark, as when affrighted. But before any cou'd look about them, to know the meaning of the&s;e things, they heard fir&s;t a gen|tle Murmur, like a &s;mall ruffling Wind, and then a more noi&s;y Rumbling, as of Thunder at &s;ome Di&s;tance: which &s;eem'd to approach nigher, and grew louder, till it roared terribly; and then we felt our Hou&s;es totter and reel, with the tremulous Motion and Heaving of the Earth, as if they wou'd tumble down into Ruins.</P>
<P>It's tho't the <HI>greatest</HI> Earthquake this Country ever knew. Had the fir&s;t Concu&s;&s;ion la&s;ted a few Minutes longer, or been repeated often with equal Force, it's probable much Damage had been done: But by the Mer|cy of GOD, the Violence was &s;oon over (I believe it &s;carce exceeded a <HI>Minute &amp; half</HI>) and they were but feebler Shakings, that follow'd, the &s;ame Night; or that have in &s;ome Places &s;ince been perceived: For &s;everal Towns to the <HI>Northward</HI> have, for &s;ome Weeks now, been &s;carce a Day free from the rumbling Noi&s;e, &amp; fainter Shocks.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Extent</HI> of the Earthquake, it's beyond what has been common. We are already inform'd, it reach'd <HI>Five Hundred</HI> Miles. And the Time of the fir&s;t Shock &s;eems to have been in all parts with little or no ob&s;er|vable Variation &mdash; So that the inflamed Damp, or &s;ub|terraneous Fermentation, which was the Principle of this great Earthquake, mu&s;t needs be emphatically in <HI>the deep Places of the Earth;</HI> and there appears a marvellous Hand of the <HI>ALMIGHTY</HI> in it.</P></NOTE> Verily
<PB N="6" REF="002874_0009_0FE6803605D8D768">
<HI>it is a Night to be much ob&s;erv'd</HI> and remembred, for the uncommon Terror, and the great Deliverance. And &s;urely it can't be forgotten, at lea&s;t while the Repetition of the doleful <HI>Murmurs</HI> &amp; <HI>Shakes</HI> is con|tinued, as we hear it is yet in divers Places. La&s;t <HI>Lord's Day</HI> Evening it is &s;aid &s;everal Towns were &s;urpri&s;ed with the roaring Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>UPON this extraordinary Occa&s;ion you have doubt|le&s;s all of you already heard proper Le&s;&s;ons and Ad|monitions from the Pulpit. Yet <HI>I think it meet to &s;tir you up, by putting you in Remembrance;</HI> and hope it will be a word in Sea&s;on, e&s;pecially &s;ince it is as it were an Addre&s;s to the whole Province together, in our honorable <HI>Rulers,</HI> and <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI> met at this time in a new A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>AND I be&s;eech you, Brethren, &s;uffer the Word of Exhortation, which &s;peaks to you in the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t's</HI> Language; The LORD is a great GOD, and a great King above all Gods: <HI>In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth,&mdash; To day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts as in the Provocation, and in the Day of Temptation in the Wilderne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Words we have fir&s;t a Propo&s;ition laid down, <HI>In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth.</HI> And then an Exhortation leading us into a proper Im|provement of that general Truth, <HI>To day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</HI> Which is enforced by the awful Con&s;ideration of the Fall and De&s;truction of the unbelieving <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in the <HI>Wil|derne&s;s,</HI> who tempted and provoked the mo&s;t high GOD, &s;o that He was wroth with his Inheritance, and abhorred his People.</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing on the Text, I &s;hall proceed in the Order &amp; Method of the P&s;almi&s;t: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething to illu&s;trate the <HI>Truth</HI> he a&s;&s;erts here: <HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall inculcate the <HI>Duty</HI> he exhorts to. And finally pre&s;s the <HI>Motive</HI> taken from the Exam|ple of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> that &s;inned and fell in the Wil|derne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002874_0010_0FE680362403C9A0">I &s;hall begin with the P&s;almi&s;t's Pro po&s;ition, which you may take for the <HI>Doctrine</HI> or Ground of my Di&s;|cour&s;e,</P>
<P><HI>IN the</HI> LORD'S <HI>Hand are the deep Places of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>THE Meaning is, That the whole Earth is the LORD'S, and even from it's Centre, and in all it's Parts, is &s;upported and govern'd by a Divine Power and Influence. GOD has the Propriety, and the Di&s;|po&s;al of all.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) HE has a <HI>Propriety</HI> every where, and even the deep Places of the Earth are his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS appears the Meaning in part from what fol|lows; <HI>The Strength of the Hills is</HI> HIS <HI>al&s;o; The Sea is</HI> HIS, <HI>and He made it; and his Hands formed the dry Land.</HI></P>
<P>IT was GOD that originally gave Being to the Earth; 'Twas the Product of his mighty Power, the Contrivance of his Wi&s;dom, and Efflux of his Good|ne&s;s. The holy Scriptures every where a&s;cribe the Creation of the Earth to GOD, and mention it in many elegant &amp; lofty De&s;criptions of the great Crea|tor and Sovereign of all Things, as a marvellous Di&s;|play of his adorable Perfections; a glorious Piece of divine Workman&s;hip <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 102 35 &amp; 104.5. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 51.13. <HI>Jer.</HI> 51 15.</NOTE>. Yea we find the Almighty challenging it as his peculiar Glory <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;a</HI> 44 24. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 48 12, 13. <HI>Job</HI> 38 4,-7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOW therefore, if GOD created the Earth, He mu&s;t needs have an indi&s;putable Right of Propriety in it. Hence the Scriptures do frequently a&s;&s;ert his Title. Thus, Deut. 10.14. <HI>Behold, the Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens is the Lord's thy God, the Earth al&s;o with all that therein is.</HI> P&s;al. 24.1. <HI>The Earth is the Lord's, and the fulne&s;s thereof; the World, and they that dwell therein.</HI> And &s;o our Text, In his hand are the deep Places of the Earth: the &s;ubterraneous Springs and Mines; the
<PB N="8" REF="002874_0011_0FE680384A1CE1E8">
abundance of the Sea, and the Trea&s;ures hid in the Sand. Yea He tells us, Job 41.11. <HI>What&s;oever is under the whole Heaven is mine.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED it is &s;aid, GOD <HI>hath given the Earth to the Children of Men:</HI> but it means only, That he has lent or let it out to them: Given it them for a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to occupy for the pre&s;ent. We are but Tenants: He is the Landlord, and has re&s;erv'd to Him&s;elf the whole Property. Even our very Hou&s;es, with all their Furniture, and our Lands, with all the Improvements upon them; all the Produce upon the Surface, and all the Riches within the Bowels of the Earth, are the LORD'S. All the Ends of the Earth, and all the &s;ecret Places of it; even the Regions that are out of all human Sight and Reach, They and their rich Contents are His: Not only under his Eye, but in his Hand, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him as much as any other parts of the World.</P>
<P>THIS &s;hows the <HI>un&s;earchable Riches</HI> &amp; <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> of GOD. Agreably the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>Great is the Lord:</HI> In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth. Surely none of the great Men of the Earth, that tru&s;t in their Wealth, and boa&s;t them&s;elves in the Multitude of their Riches, can vie with GOD. However large their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, tho' they have added Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and Field to Field, and extended their Pur|cha&s;es or Conque&s;ts &s;o far that they &s;eem to be placed almo&s;t alone in the Earth; yet they cannot compate with GOD: for He is Lord of the <HI>whole</HI> Earth; the utmo&s;t parts of the Earth, and the deep places of it, are his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; while the Riche&s;t of Men po&s;&s;e&s;s only &s;ome &s;mall &s;pots of the upper <HI>Strata.</HI> Let this Reflection teach Men Humility.&mdash;And let it teach us to admire the <HI>Conde&s;cen&s;ion</HI> of GOD in accepting the Alms &amp; Devotions of his People. 1 Chron. 29.14. <HI>But who am I, and what is my people, that we &s;hould be able to offer &s;o willingly after this &s;ort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</HI> Surely He is not mini&s;tred to by Men's Hands, as tho' He needed any thing, &s;eeing that He is Lord
<PB N="9" REF="002874_0012_0FE6803869C129C8">
of Heaven and Earth. Hence He put a &s;light upon the legal Sacrifices, in tho&s;e Terms, P&s;al. 50.12. <HI>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the World is mine, and the fulne&s;s thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Further, THIS teaches us the <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> of Them that have an Intere&s;t in the LORD as their GOD! Behold, Happy is the Man who&s;e Hope is in the Lord. They that have Him for their Portion may be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s all Things: Things pre&s;ent and Things to come, all are theirs, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.22. Hence P&s;al. 89.11, 12, 15. <HI>The Heavens are thine, the Earth al&s;o is thine: as for the World, and the fulne&s;s thereof, thou ha&s;t founded them. The North and the South thou ha&s;t created them: Tabor and Hermon &s;hall rejoyce in thy name. Ble&s;&s;ed are the People that know the joyful &s;ound: they &s;hall walk, O Lord in the light of thy Countenance.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, THIS Reflection affords a Motive to <HI>Obedience;</HI> becau&s;e GOD is able out of his rich Stores abundantly to reward us. Exod. 19.5. <HI>Now there|fore, If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ye &s;hall be a peculiar Trea&s;ure unto me above all People: for all the Earth is mine.</HI> Par|ticularly it is a &s;trong Incentive to Charity &amp; Bounty, in all tho&s;e In&s;tances which GOD requires of us. For all the Store that we have prepared cometh of his Hand, and is all his own. He ju&s;tly therefore expects that we honour Him with our Sub&s;tance: and in &s;pecial by willingly expending upon pious and charitable U&s;es, the Proportions which he hath out of our E&s;tates and Incomes &s;eparated to &s;uch Ends. We are &s;olemnly charged to give, every Man as he is able, according as GOD hath pro&s;pered him <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 16.17. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.2</NOTE>. And if we withhold more than is meet, He charges us with Stealth and Inju&s;tice. Mal. 3.8. <HI>Will a Man rob God? yet ye have robbed me: but ye &s;ay, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes &amp; offerings.</HI> Where|fore as we wou'd not incur the Guilt of Inju&s;tice, as
<PB N="10" REF="002874_0013_0FE6803FA38A9648">
well as Ingratitude, let us &s;ee to it that we be ready to di&s;tribute, willing to communicate. To do Good and to communicate, forget not: for with &s;uch Sa|crifices GOD is well plea&s;ed. Render to all their dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Honour to whom Honour, Charity to whom Charity.

<P N="2">(2.) ANOTHER Thing imply'd may be, That GOD <HI>Upholds</HI> the Earth in it's Being, and continues it's &s;everal Virtues, Riches and Ornaments.</P>
<P>THE Earth, and all it's deep Places, He holds in his Hand, and keeps from De&s;olation. Should He withdraw His &s;u&s;taining Influence but for a moment, the Earth wou'd immediately return to it's primi|tive Chaos, or relap&s;e into Nothing. By his Al|mighty <HI>Fiat</HI> the Earth, with it's immen&s;e Stores and Trea&s;ures, &s;tarted into Being; and He upholds all Things by the &s;ame Word of his Strength. No Crea|ture has a Power of Self-pre&s;ervation; nor can one pre&s;erve another: but all depend upon the Fir&s;t Cau&s;e, and equal is the Efficiency of the Almighty, in the Su&s;tentation of the Earth, as in it's original Crea|tion.</P>
<P>THE upholding and pre&s;erving of this vi&s;ible World is every where in holy Scripture declar'd the Work of his omnipotent Arm, and celebrated as one of the high Glories of infinite Maje&s;ty. Jer. 51.15. <HI>He hath made the Earth by his Power; He hath e&s;tabli&s;hed the World by his Wi&s;dom.</HI>&mdash; When He had created the Earth, He fixed this va&s;t Globe on it's Centre, and &s;ettled the Orders and U&s;es of all Things therein. Hence we read, P&s;al, 104.5. <HI>Who laid the Foundations of the Earth,</HI> or as it is in the Margin,
<PB N="11" REF="002874_0014_0FE6803FC62C3EF8">
Hath founded the Earth upon her Ba&s;es. This va&s;t Terraqueous Globe has no vi&s;ible Foundations to &s;up|port it, no Pillars to re&s;t upon, nor Axletree on which it hangs; but is &s;u&s;pended in the Air, pois'd with it's own weight, we know not how. A My&s;tery this is, celebrated by all Philo&s;ophers as one of the in|&s;crutable <HI>Arcana</HI> of Nature, and the Re&s;ult of Di|vine Power &amp; Wi&s;dom. <HI>Job</HI> mentions it with won|der, Chap. 26.7. <HI>He &s;tretcheth out the North over the empty Place, and hangeth the Earth upon No|thing.</HI> When GOD &s;pake to <HI>Job</HI> out of the Whirl|wind, among other Challenges, He made that, Chap. 38.5, 6. <HI>Who hath laid the mea&s;ures thereof, if thou knowe&s;t? or who hath &s;tretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the Foundations thereof fa&s;tned? or who hath laid the Corner-&s;tone thereof?</HI> "The va&s;t Bulk of the Earth is model'd as regularly as if it had been done by Line and Mea&s;ure": And re|tains to this Day the &s;ame Figure &amp; Dimen&s;ions that it had at fir&s;t; continued by the Power of GOD, who <HI>laid the Corner-&s;tone</HI> thereof, which pre&s;erves the Parts of it in a ju&s;t Con&s;i&s;tence, and &s;aves them from crum|bling into Confu&s;ion. And He al&s;o <HI>fa&s;ten'd the Foundations,</HI> &s;o that this prodigious Weight has kept thro' many Ages it's primitive Situation, which gives it &s;till the Advantage of the Atmo&s;phere, and the heavenly Orbs round about it. This is the Work of GOD. <HI>His &s;trength &s;etteth fa&s;t the Mountains,</HI> and He is the Confidence of all the Ends of the Earth. He comprehendeth the Du&s;t of the Ground in a mea|&s;ure, and weigheth the Hills in a Balance. He vi&s;its the dark Caverns of the Earth, and pre&s;erves it's Bowels from gu&s;hing out. He guards the Earth from the Violence of the Sea, and continues the ancient Divi&s;ion of the Waters from the dry Land. He &s;ets Bars to the Ocean, and holds the mighty Aby&s;s in the Hollow of his Hand. He poi&s;es this terraqueous Globe &s;o equally on every &s;ide; maintains a ju&s;t Pro|portion of the Elements, and the convenient Di&s;tribu|tion of &s;olid and fluid Bodies.</P>

<P>THIS Act is imply'd in the former, and the Right of Dominion is ju&s;tly founded thereon.

<P>HE governs the <HI>Rational</HI> World; doth what He plea&s;eth among the Armies of Heaven above, and among&s;t the Inhabitants of the Earth below.

<P>THE glorious Orbs of <HI>Light,</HI> that roll over our Heads, are pre&s;erv'd by Him in their Beauty &amp; Order, and directed by Him in all their Motions and Effects. The <HI>Earth</HI> al&s;o under our Feet, and the <HI>Air</HI> we breathe in, are under his ab&s;olute Dominion.</P>
<P>HE made the Elements, and He governs them: di|rects their natural Powers, and orders all their Influ|ences &amp; Operations; &s;u&s;pending, or enlarging, as He will. Men are indeed &s;ometimes apt to imagin, that the Elementary World is under no Direction, that a wild Loo&s;e is given to natural Cau&s;es, and that they act with an unbounded Liberty. But verily in the mid&s;t of all the Confu&s;ion and Impetuo&s;ity that is &s;een at any time, GOD in&s;pects, re&s;trains, and over-rules, to make every thing &s;ub&s;erve his own ble&s;&s;ed Purpo|&s;es.

There is a kind of Circulation among natural Principles; a Revolution of the Elements.

<P>THE &s;mall Fi&s;&s;ures &amp; wider Cavities in the low Places of the Earth, as well as the high Hills and rocky Mountains, appear the Work of Coun&s;el, and are of indi&s;pen&s;able U&s;e to the World.

<P>AGREABLY the Scriptures every where teach us to con&s;ider GOD as the <HI>Author</HI> of all tho&s;e <HI>Benefits</HI> and Salvations, which the Earth and it's Inhabitants do experience.

<P>O let us reali&s;e the &s;paring Mercy and preventing Goodne&s;s, mix'd with the awful Di&s;pen&s;ation we are pa&s;&s;ing under.

<P>IN former days this Land has felt the gentle Shocks of Earthquakes, one after another. GOD has vi&s;ited us once and again; but in Tenderne&s;s, remembring Mercy in the mid&s;t of Wrath.

Now the&s;e things were our examples, to the intent we &s;hould not lu&s;t after evil things, as they al&s;o lu&s;ted.</HI> So the Prophet, Jer. 7.12. <HI>But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I &s;et my name at the fir&s;t, and &s;ee what I did to it, for the wickedne&s;s of my people I&s;rael.</HI> In like manner it may be &s;aid, Go to <HI>Antioch;</HI> Go to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and to <HI>Laodicea,</HI> and to <HI>Sar|dis;</HI> and &s;ee what an incen&s;ed GOD has done to them for all their Wickedne&s;s. And let us fear the like Doom. Places they were once famous for the Chri&s;tian Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, but growing degenerate were finally de&s;troy'd by terrible <HI>Earthquakes.</HI> O let not <HI>New-England</HI> be highminded, but fear: be zealous, and repent. To come nearer home, I might &s;ay, Go to <HI>Lima,</HI> in the Southern Part of <HI>America</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The Spaniards have met with terrible Blows in this City once and again by Earthquakes. Particularly in the Year 1687, it was totally overthrown; the Hou&s;es were thrown down, and above a <HI>Thou&s;and</HI> of the Inhabitants peri&s;h'd in the Ruins, or were drown'd in the Sea, which breaking over it's Banks overflow'd the Sea-port Towns round about; carry'd Ships three Leagues up within Land, and made great Havock every where. Va&s;t Num|bers of Cattel were drown'd, and Multitudes of People in one Town and another, be&s;ides what peri&s;h'd in the City. It's &s;aid, <HI>Five Thou&s;and</HI> Corp&s;es were taken up at one place, after the retiring of the Waters: And doubtle&s;s many were carry'd out to Sea. <HI>Atl.</HI> Geogr. for <HI>America,</HI> p. 230.

and other I&s;lands in the <HI>Northern</HI> Part <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About the Year 1690, happen'd an Earthquake, which affected almo&s;t all the <HI>Leeward</HI> I&s;lands, and was very ter|rible at <HI>Antego, Nevis, St. Chri&s;tophers</HI> and <HI>Mont&s;errat.</HI> At <HI>Antego,</HI> it threw down many of their Hou&s;es, Sugar-works, and Wind-mills. One then wrote to his Corre|&s;pondent here. That the Earth was &s;een to heave &amp; roll like the Waves of the Sea, that Rocks were thrown from the Mountains, Hou&s;es &s;hattered, and &s;ome Points of Land &s;wallow'd up. [Dr. <HI>I. Mather,</HI> of Earthq. p. 27.] &mdash; At <HI>Nevis,</HI> it made great De&s;olations. It ruin'd mo&s;t of <HI>Charle&s;town.</HI> The Ground open'd in the Streets, and a hot &s;tinking Water &s;pouted out of the Earth to a great height. The Earth in many places broke open and &s;wallow'd &s;ome Thou&s;ands of great Trees, that were never more &s;een. At <HI>St. Chri&s;tophers,</HI> the Earth open'd <HI>nine</HI> foot wide in many places, bury'd &s;olid Timber, Sugar-Mills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And threw down the Je&s;uits College, and all the other Stone-Buildings &mdash; This Earthquake broke off part of another I&s;land, and threw it into the Sea, with a Noi&s;e like a Cannon, and &s;ent up a mighty Cloud of Du&s;t into the Air &mdash; <HI>Atl Geo.</HI> p. 514, 516, 517, 524.] It was al&s;o at <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but did no Hurt there.&mdash; And we are now inform'd, That the late Earthquake which &s;hook <HI>New-England,</HI> was at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> on the Day before, about Noon; which is nigh <HI>two Thou&s;and</HI> Miles from <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> The Shake much as it was here in &s;ome Places: Their <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> were in a great Convul&s;ion; and the <HI>Streets</HI> ro&s;e and fell like the Waves of the Ocean; &s;o that they were afraid of the Earth's &s;inking, and all ran down to the Wharves, to get into Boats &amp; Ships for Security.</NOTE>: and con|&s;ider the Works of the Lord, how terrible He has &s;ometimes been in his Dealings with impenitent Chri&s;|tians. And what Plea now has <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> what Plea has <HI>New-England</HI> to make for an Exemption, if we go on &s;till in our Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es! GOD has once and again put into our Hands <HI>a Cup of Trembling:</HI> and we may ex|pect He will make us to drink deep of his Ven|geance, if we continue impenitent; even <HI>deeper</HI> than other places, in proportion to the Guilt &amp; De|merit of our mo&s;t aggravated Sins. GOD may cau&s;e the Calamity to ri&s;e up a <HI>&s;econd time,</HI> and then give it a Commi&s;&s;ion to de&s;troy; except we repent. Verily there is no Contending with GOD, as <HI>Job</HI> &s;peaks,

<HI>Job</HI> 9.4, 5, 6. To day then if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts; le&s;t there come upon us &s;ud|den De&s;truction without Remedy.</P>
<P>BUT if utter De&s;olation ha&s;ten not upon the Land, by literal Earthquakes, and other the like Judgments; yet have we not Rea&s;on to fear &s;ad Revolutions, <HI>Church</HI>-quakes &amp; <HI>State</HI>-quakes, that &s;hall &s;wallow up all our deare&s;t Privileges! Have we not felt repeated <HI>Shocks</HI> already, that have made the very Foundations tremble under us, and threatned a terrible Di&s;&s;olution! Are there not many that <HI>hate our Zion,</HI> who cea&s;e not cry|ing, Ra&s;e it, Ra&s;e it to the very foundations! And is not the Number of <HI>New-England</HI>'s be&s;t <HI>Friends</HI> le&s;s|ning every day! How is the ancient Stock of pious praying Chri&s;tians, and faithful, active, zealous Ser|vants of the Publick dying off apace? [Among others I wou'd here mention two <HI>late</HI> In&s;tances, one in the Ma|gi&s;tracy, and the other in the Mini&s;try; the Honourable Col. <HI>John Otis,</HI> of his Maje&s;ty's Council, and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth,</HI> Pa&s;tor of the Church in <HI>Taun|ton,</HI> who having in their various Stations faithfully &s;erv'd their Generation, are now fallen a&s;leep in JESUS.] And of tho&s;e ri&s;ing up, how few are there po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with with the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Spirit of <HI>New-England!</HI> Are we not daily degenerating from the Principles and Zeal of our primitive Times! Is not Apo&s;ta&s;y growing upon our Churches in regard of Faith, Wor&s;hip, Di&s;cipline and Conver&s;ation! Are there not tho&s;e Sins abounding a|mong us, which might ju&s;tly provoke GOD to take away his Kingdom from us, to tear in pieces our hap|py CHARTER, and vi&s;it us with Per&s;ecution &amp; Oppre&s;|&s;ion! And does not a Spirit of Contention &amp; Perver&s;e|ne&s;s, the Love of the World, and licentious Cu&s;toms, threaten to ruin us, in our be&s;t Intere&s;ts, by a natural and powerful Efficacy!</P>
<P>O let the&s;e Reflections awaken all that love <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to tremble for the Ark of GOD, and to plead for the City of our Solemnities. Hear the Exhortation, with which I now conclude, I&s;a. 62.6, 7. &mdash;<HI>Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not &s;ilence; And give him no re&s;t, till he e&s;tabli&s;h, and till he make Jeru&s;alem a prai&s;e in the Earth.</HI></P>
