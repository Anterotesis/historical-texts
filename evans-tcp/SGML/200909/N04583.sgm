<Q><BIBL><HI>ECCLES. IX. 1, 2, 3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For all this I con&s;idered in my Heart even to declare all this, that the Righteous and the Wi&s;e, and their Works are in the Hand of God: No Man knoweth either Love or Hatred, by all that is before them. All things come alike to all, there is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wicked; to the Good and to the Clean, and to the Unclean; to him that &s;acrific|eth, and to him that &s;acrificeth not: As is the Good &s;o is the Sinner; and he that &s;weareth, as he that feareth an Oath. There is an Evil among all Things that are done under the Sun, that there is one Event unto all: Yea al&s;o the Heart of the Sons of Men is full of Evil, and mad|ne&s;s is in their Heart while they live.</P></Q>

<P>THERE are two Things in the Cour&s;e of Divine Providence, which have been Perplexing to good Men, and &s;tumb|ling to the bad, and they are the&s;e, name|ly, the Calamities of the former, and Pro&s;|perity
<PB N="4" REF="005695_0003_1026C0DFA72D05B0">
of the latter. Of the&s;e <HI>Solomon</HI> di&s;|cour&s;es in the Words that I have read: The wi&s;e Man pondered upon this difficult Sub|ject thoroughly, he weighed the Matter with due Deliberation, and revolv'd it in his pen&s;ive Mind, and then came to the following Declaration and Conclu&s;ion; namely, that <HI>all Things come alike to all, and that there is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wicked: i. e.</HI> All outward Things whither pro&s;perous or adver&s;e, comfortable or calamitous, are promi&s;cuou&s;ly di&s;pen&s;ed without Di&s;tinction upon the Good and Bad, and therefore that God's Love or Hatred towards us, cannot be judged of or known by our outward Condition; <HI>No Man knoweth either Love or Hatred by all that is before him;</HI> he cannot rea&s;onably conclude that he is the Object of God's peculiar Love, becau&s;e his outward State is honourable, ea&s;y and pro&s;perous, or that he is expos'd to the Divine Indignation, becau&s;e his Name is cover'd with Reproach, his E&s;tate bla&s;ted by Adver&s;ity, and his Body rack'd by accute Pain.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> indeed acknowledges, that this
<PB N="5" REF="005695_0004_1026C0E56772B1A0">
mix'd Di&s;pen&s;ation of Things was perplex|ing to the Good and en&s;naring to the Bad; <HI>this is an Evil</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>among all Things that are done under the Sun, that there is one Event unto all: i. e.</HI> This &s;eeming Con|fu&s;ion of Events is a great Perplexity to tho&s;e that are pious. The P&s;almi&s;t in|forms us in the lxxiii. <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> how much he was &s;tumbled at this in the following Words; <HI>But as for me my Feet were almo&s;t gone, my Steps had well nigh &s;lipt, for I was envious at the Fooli&s;h, when I &s;aw the Pro&s;perity of the Wicked, for there are no Bands in their Death but their Strength is firm, they are not in Trouble as other Men, neither are they plagued like other Men; therefore Pride compa&s;&s;eth them about as a Chain, Violence covereth them as a Garment, their Eyes &s;tand out with Fatne&s;s, they have more than Heart could wi&s;h, they are cor|rupt and &s;peak wickedly, they &s;et their Mouth again&s;t the Heavens, and their Tongue walk|eth through the Earth, behold the&s;e are the Ungodly who pro&s;per in the World, they increa&s;e in Riches, verily I have clean&s;ed my Heart in vain, and wa&s;hed my Hands
<PB N="6" REF="005695_0005_1026C0E6EE40D200">
in Innocency, for all Day long have I been plagued, and cha&s;tened every Morning. If I &s;ay I will &s;peak thus, behold I &s;hould of|fend again&s;t the Generation of thy Children, when I &s;ought to know this it was too pain|ful for me, until I went into the Sanctuary of God, then under&s;tood I their END: Surely thou did&s;t &s;et them in &s;lippery Places, thou ca&s;ted&s;t them down into De&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P>What <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays in the viiith of <HI>Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tes</HI> and 11. &s;erves to explain the latter Part of our Text, <HI>viz. Becau&s;e Sentence again&s;t an evil Work is not &s;peedily execut|ed, therefore the Heart of the Sons of Men is fully &s;et in them to do Evil; madne&s;s is in their Heart while they live:</HI> They harden them&s;elves in their Wickedne&s;s and Impenitence, by the Abu&s;e of God's Providence, for thus they fooli&s;hly argue: Well if the Ca&s;e be &s;o, that the Wicked pa&s;s unpuni&s;h'd (oftentimes) and the pious are afflicted, then I'll be wicked too, its vain to be religious, for God &s;hews no Re|gard to &s;uch, and makes no vi&s;ible Di&s;tinc|tion between them and others in his Pro|vidence. But how rediculous is this Rea|&s;oning,
<PB N="7" REF="005695_0006_1026C0E89D7F50B8">
or rather Cavilling? For if God makes a due Di&s;tinction after Time, it is enough to excite the con&s;iderate Mind to Virtue, and deter from Vice.</P>
<P>In the mean time let us ob&s;erve the Dif|ferent Characters that <HI>Solomon</HI> in our Text a&s;cribes to the <HI>Righteous</HI> and to the <HI>Wick|ed,</HI> and the &s;pecial regard that the Almighty &s;hews to the former, even in this World.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The <HI>Righteous</HI> are <HI>clean, they have clean Hands and pure Hearts,</HI> they are un|der the habitual Dominion of no Evil, but <HI>Hunger and Thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and having an Intere&s;t in the great and preci|ous Promi&s;es of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> it is the chief De&s;ire of their Hearts, and the principal labour of their Lives, to <HI>clean&s;e them&s;elves from all filthine&s;s of the Fle&s;h and Spirit, and perfect Holine&s;s in the fear of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The <HI>Righteous</HI> are <HI>Good,</HI> not only in re&s;pect of their State, but cour&s;e of Ac|tion. They are ju&s;tify'd in the &s;ight of God, thro' the Imputation of CHRIST'S Righteou&s;ne&s;s received by Faith. The Al|mighty ju&s;tifies them, however Men may
<PB N="8" REF="005695_0007_1026C0EC8D0C0AC8">
condemn them. And they are <HI>Good</HI> in their Series of Action, not only avoiding all appearance of cruelty and inju&s;tice, but abounding in Acts of Kindne&s;s and Bene|ficence towards the Names, Bodies, E&s;tates, and Souls of their Fellow-Creatures; and herein they re&s;emble their heavenly Father, who not only <HI>is Good,</HI> but <HI>does Good unto all, and who&s;e Mercy is over all his other Works.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>righteous Sacrifice;</HI> that is, they wor&s;hip God both inwardly and out|wardly according to his Pre&s;cription, they make Con&s;cience of the &s;tated Performance of it, and will not &s;tick at any co&s;t that is requi&s;ite for that Purpo&s;e. The <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Sa|crifices were very co&s;tly, and yet they of|fered them up &s;tatedly twice a Day, be|&s;ides their extraordinary Devotions at par|ticular Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The <HI>Righteous fear an Oath.</HI> They have a Reverence for God's Name, and &s;o fear to take an Oath, becau&s;e it is a Solemn appeal to God as a Witne&s;s and Judge, and when they have taken an Oath they fear to break it, lea&s;t hereby they &s;hould incur the Divine Vengeance.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005695_0008_1026C0F00C51C730">But on the Contrary the <HI>Wicked</HI> are <HI>unclean,</HI> except in their own Imagination, their Hearts are unrenew'd, and Sin habi|tually governs over them.</P>
<P>They are likewi&s;e chiefly and generally influenced by &s;elfi&s;h Principles and Views, &s;elf is the Idol they Wor&s;hip, to this all their Actions vail: They are carele&s;s of the &s;tated Performance of God's Wor&s;hip, they <HI>Sacrifice not,</HI> but under &s;ome Pre|tence or other habitually neglect the in|ward or outward Part of Wor&s;hip or both, they will not be at any pains or Co&s;t about Religion at all.</P>
<P>Again &s;ome of them <HI>Swear</HI> ra&s;hly and prophanely, and have no Veneration for the holy Name of God.</P>
<P>Now altho' Things come alike to tho&s;e Per&s;ons, of &s;o very contrary Characters, yet their outward Condition comes from a very different Spring, and will have a a different I&s;&s;ue. This <HI>Solomon</HI> gives us a Hint of in the Beginning of this Chapter, in the&s;e Words, <HI>For all this I con&s;idered in my Heart, even to declare all this, that the Righteous, and the Wi&s;e, and their Works
<PB N="10" REF="005695_0009_1026C0F191C531C0">
are in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of God. i. e.</HI> They are un|der his &s;pecial Conduct and Direction, their Troubles do not come by Accident, but according to the Council of God's Will, and &s;hall &s;urely Work together for their Good, even tho&s;e Things &s;hall be for them, which &s;eemed to be mo&s;t again&s;t them.</P>
<P>That which I am to &s;peak upon from the Ver&s;es I have read is this, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the outward Di&s;pen&s;ations of Pro|vidence are, for the general, the &s;ame to the Good and Bad.</HI> There is one good Event to both. Is <HI>David</HI> rich? So is <HI>Nabal:</HI> Is <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> favour'd by his Prince? So is <HI>Ha|man.</HI> And there is one bad Event to both, is <HI>Ahab</HI> kill'd in the Battle? So is <HI>Jo&s;iah:</HI> Are the good Figgs carry'd to <HI>Babylon?</HI> So are the bad, (<HI>Jer.</HI> xxiv. 1) Was <HI>Saul</HI> kil|led in the Battle? So was pious <HI>Jonathan.</HI> Are not the Righteous generally afflicted in Life? And hence we are told, <HI>thro' ma|ny Tribulations, we mu&s;t enter into the King|dom of God:&mdash;That &s;trait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leads to Life, and few there be that find it:&mdash;That</HI> in this World we &s;hall have Tribulation:&mdash;<HI>That
<PB N="11" REF="005695_0010_1026C0F532274F48">
the Righteous are &s;carcely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">:&mdash;That they &s;hall mourn and the World rejoice:&mdash; That many are the Afflictions of the Righ|teous:&mdash;That while we are in this World, we groan within our&s;elves waiting for the Redemption of our Bodies:&mdash;That we are judged and cha&s;tened of the Lord, lea&s;t we &s;hould be condemned with the World,</HI> (1 Cor. xi. 31.) The Church is repre&s;ented by the prophet I&s;aiah, as <HI>to&s;s'd with Tempe&s;ts, and afflicted.</HI> (I&s;a. liv. 11.)</P>
<P>And have not &s;ome righteous Per&s;ons been remov'd by Death in a Manner that look'd Judgment like? Thus <HI>Eli,</HI> who was devoutly concern'd for the Ark of GOD, the Glory of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and Symbol of the Divine Pre&s;ence, when he heard that this was taken by the <HI>Phili&s;tine</HI> Ho&s;ts, be|ing overcome with a Pre&s;&s;ure of Grief upon this Occa&s;ion, he fell back, and by the Fall broke his Neck, and died. This look'd very Judgment like, and yet it was no doubt in Mercy to him.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e of <HI>Uzza</HI> is likewi&s;e very re|markable, who when he touched the &s;haking Ark, with a View doubtle&s;s to
<PB N="12" REF="005695_0011_1026C0F7C2416868">
keep it from falling, was immediately &s;truck dead.</P>
<P>And did not <HI>Sam&s;on</HI> al&s;o dye a violent Death by the Fall of a Hou&s;e upon him, tho' he was favoured ju&s;t before with un|common divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance in An&s;wer to his Prayer?</P>
<P>In the mean Time the P&s;almi&s;t informs us of &s;ome of the Wicked, That <HI>like Sheep they are laid in their Graves,</HI> they are car|ry'd off the Stage of Time with Calmne&s;s and Confidence.</P>
<P>Now the Rea&s;ons of this mix'd Di&s;pen|&s;ation of Things to Good and Bad, are the&s;e following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. This World is a State of <HI>Tryal</HI> and <HI>Probation,</HI> and not of <HI>Recompence,</HI> wherein Per&s;ons are to be exercis'd and treated as Candidates, in Order to a future Tryal and Reward; and therefore a proper and vi&s;ible Di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons in this Life, according to their different Characters is not to be expected; for that would blend two very different States together, and render a future Judgment unnece&s;&s;ary in that Day when God <HI>makes up his Jewels,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="005695_0012_1026C0F9471F4DA0">
as the Prophet <HI>Malachi</HI> ob&s;erves, We may <HI>di&s;cern between the Righteous and the Wicked, between him that &s;erveth God, and him that &s;erveth him</HI> not, <HI>but not before.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. GOD hereby glorifies his <HI>Sove|reignty, he does in Heaven and Earth, ac|cording to the Council of his Will, and who can &s;ay unto GOD, why do&s;t thou &s;o?</HI> The Almighty gives no Account of his Matters to his Creatures, nor can be ar|raign'd before a human Tribunal: <HI>His Judgments are un&s;earchable, and his Ways pa&s;t finding out.</HI> It is rea&s;onable that God in the Di&s;pen&s;ations of his Providence, &s;hould magnify his <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> as well as his other Perfections. Now this appears in his doing tho&s;e Things which he might either do or not do con&s;i&s;tent with his Ho|line&s;s and Ju&s;tice. An Example of which we have in the Man that was born Blind.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Almighty by this mix'd Di&s;|pen&s;ation of Events to Good and Bad, promotes the <HI>Benefit</HI> of the former, and renders the latter <HI>inexcu&s;able.</HI></P>
<P>As there are dark Texts in the Holy
<PB N="14" REF="005695_0013_1026C0FBC0195C30">
Scriptures, which it is difficult for us to explain, <HI>which the unlearned and un&s;table wre&s;t to their own De&s;truction,</HI> &s;o there be ob&s;cure Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence which we cannot fully unfold, and which the Wicked ignorantly and incon&s;iderately mi&s;|interpret, and abu&s;e to their own Prejudice. <HI>GOD's Paths are in the great Deep, and his Foot&s;teps are not known.</HI> The Al|mighty &s;ometimes <HI>hides the Face of his Throne, and makes Darkne&s;s his Pavilion.</HI> We &s;ee but &s;ome broken Shreds of the Scene of Providence in this World, and therefore are but Poor Judges of the Wi&s;|dom, Harmony, and Sub&s;erviency thereof to an&s;wer the great De&s;ign propos'd by God: But at the End of Time, when the whole Piece &s;hall be opened at once to our View, then the Beauty, the Wi&s;dom and De&s;ign thereof &s;hall be admir'd, then we &s;hall clearly perceive the clo&s;e Connecti|on that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the &s;everal Parts of Providence, and their direct Tendency to an&s;wer the great End which Almighty GOD had in View from the Beginning, <HI>viz.</HI> His own Glory and his Peoples Ad|vantage:
<PB N="15" REF="005695_0014_1026C0FD90F070E8">
That gracious comprehen&s;ive Promi&s;e of God to his People &s;hall &s;urely be verify'd in all the Occurrences of Pro|vidence they meet with, which is expre&s;s'd in the Epi&s;tle of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> namely, That <HI>all Things &s;hall work toge|ther for the Good of tho&s;e that are the cal|led according to his purpo&s;e.</HI> One Provi|dence &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t the U&s;efulne&s;s of another, notwith&s;tanding its contrary appearance; as the &s;everal Wheels of a Watch, not|with&s;tanding of their contrary Motions, &s;e|cretly promote one De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Now the Afflictions that are &s;ent upon the People of God are of three Kinds, namely either <HI>Cha&s;tnings</HI> for Sin, or <HI>Pre|ventives</HI> of Sin, or <HI>Trials</HI> of their Graces.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Almighty <HI>corrects</HI> his People for Sins again&s;t Light, as a Father his Children, with a View to their Refor|mation; and this is indeed agreeable to a gracious Promi&s;e of the New-Covenant, that if God's People &s;in again&s;t him, <HI>he will puni&s;h their Iniquities with Stripes, and their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with Rods, yet his Loving-kindne&s;s he will not take away, or
<PB N="16" REF="005695_0015_1026C10196CDF788">
&s;uffer his Faithfulne&s;s to fail.</HI> While the Al|mighty expre&s;&s;es a holy Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t their Sins, in the Sufferings he inflicts for them, he &s;hews the Love of a Father to their Per&s;ons, in making the Affliction a Medicine to cure the Di&s;order that pro|cur'd it; by this &s;aith the Prophet, <HI>&s;hall the Iniquity of</HI> Jacob <HI>be purg'd, and this is all the Fruit to take away his Sin.</HI> More|over the ble&s;&s;ed God &s;hews likewi&s;e the Love of a Father to the Afflicted, not only in mitigating the Severity of Afflicti|ons, by <HI>&s;taying his rough Wind in the Day of his Ea&s;t Wind,</HI> but al&s;o in comforting tho&s;e that are under them by his divine Influence; when <HI>Afflictions</HI> abound often|times <HI>Con&s;olations do &s;uperabound:</HI> And truly Brethren Afflictions are &s;o far from being Evidences of God's Hatred, that they are rather Signs of his Love and Care; for as the Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> informs us, <HI>whom the Lord loveth he cha&s;t|neth, and &s;courgeth every Son whom he re|ceiveth; but if ye be without Cha&s;ti&s;ement, then are ye Ba&s;tards and not Sons; and tho' no cha&s;tning for the pre&s;ent &s;eem to be joy|ous
<PB N="17" REF="005695_0016_1026C1050AA3E468">
but grievous, neverthele&s;s afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable Fruits of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, unto them that are exerci&s;ed thereby.</HI></P>
<P>Again, I may ob&s;erve, that Afflictions are &s;ent &s;ometimes to prevent Sin in time coming, in the People of God, and not as a Cha&s;tning for Sin pa&s;t; this &s;eemed to be the Ca&s;e of <HI>Paul,</HI> whom a <HI>Me&s;&s;enger of Satan was &s;ent to buffet, lea&s;t he &s;hould be lifted up above Mea&s;ure:</HI> What the particular Affliction was that Satan inflicted we cannot certainly determine, neither is it material for us to know: But thus far is certain, that it was &s;omething painful, and of a humbling Tendency; and that &s;ent with this De&s;ign (by the Almighty) <HI>viz.</HI> to prevent the Apo&s;tle's being proud of the Abundance of Revelations which he had.</P>
<P>Once more, another Kind of Afflictions &s;ent upon the People of God are <HI>Trials;</HI> this was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Job,</HI> a Complication of Di&s;tre&s;&s;es a&s;&s;ailed him in a little Time; the <HI>Sabeans robb'd him of his Oxen and A&s;&s;es, and &s;lew his Servants. The Fire of God</HI> (by which I believe we are to under|&s;tand
<PB N="18" REF="005695_0017_1026C106C4C74FF8">
the fiery Meteor of Lightning) <HI>fell upon his Sheep, and Servants that attended them, and con&s;um'd them, and one only was left to tell the doleful Tidings.</HI> His Sons and Daughters in the mid&s;t of their Merriment were &s;uddenly <HI>&s;truck dead,</HI> by the Fall of the Hou&s;e where they were, occa&s;ion'd by a violent Wind. All the&s;e Afflictions came in a thick Succe&s;&s;ion, and trod as it were upon the Heels of each other. Soon after the&s;e his whole Body was cover'd with painful Boyls, and his Mind di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with a Sen&s;e of God's Anger, of which <HI>Job</HI> e&s;pecially complains in the following Language of Agony and bitter Pa&s;&s;ion; <HI>O that my Grief were thoroughly weighed, and my Calamities laid in the Ballances together; for now it would be heavier than the Sand of the Sea, therefore my Words are &s;wallow|ed up, for the Arrows of the Almighty are within me, the Poy&s;on whereof drinketh up my Spirits, the Terrors of God do &s;et them|&s;elves in array again&s;t me.</HI></P>
<P>And that which aggravated <HI>Job's</HI> Cala|mity, was the Conduct of his Friends; who in&s;tead of a&s;&s;waging his Sorrow by
<PB N="19" REF="005695_0018_1026C108617C1138">
proper Lenitives, poured Vinegar and Nitre into his Wounds; they try'd by all the Arts of Per&s;wa&s;ion, to prove him to be a Hypocrite by his uncommon Sufferings; this <HI>Job</HI> with Ju&s;tice oppos'd, and a&s;&s;ur'd them that <HI>he would not let his Integrity go, neither &s;hould his Heart reproach him as long as he liv'd.</HI> And farther informs them, that the wicked are &s;ometimes ea&s;y and pro&s;perous, in the following &s;trong Lines; <HI>Wherefore do the Wicked live, become old, yea are mighty in Power? Their Seed is e&s;tabli&s;h'd in their Sight with them, and their Offspring before their Eyes, their Hou&s;es are &s;afe from Fear, neither is the Rod of God upon them; their Bull gendreth and failleth not, their Cow calveth and ca&s;teth not her Calf, they &s;end forth their little Ones like a Flock, and their Children dance, they take up the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoice at the Sound of the Organ, they &s;pend their Days in Wealth, and in a Moment go down to the Grave.</HI></P>

Ye have not treated me with the uncharitable Severity of <HI>Job</HI>'s Friends, but with Lenity and Indulgence, the Law of Kindne&s;s has mov'd your Lips; neither have ye been a&s;ham'd of my Chain.

<P>In fine Sirs, let us all be excited to li&s;ten to and improve the awful Voice of God by Thunder in general. <HI>Give unto the Lord O ye mighty, give unto the Lord Glory and Strength, give unto the Lord the Glory due unto his Name, wor&s;hip the Lord in the Beauty of Holine&s;s, the Voice of the Lord is upon the Waters, the GOD of Glory thun+dereth, the Voice of the Lord is powerful, the Voice of the Lord is full of Maje&s;ty, the Voice of the Lord breaketh the Cedars, yea the Lord breaketh the Cedars of</HI> Lebanon, <HI>he maketh them al&s;o to &s;kip like a Calf,</HI> Le|banon <HI>and</HI> Syrion <HI>like a young Unicorn; the Voice of the Lord divides the Flames of Fire, &s;hakes the Wilderne&s;s of</HI> Kade&s;h, <HI>makes the Hinds to calve, and di&s;covers the

Who can &s;tand before this Holy Lord God, when once his Anger begins to burn? He is wi&s;e in Heart and mighty in Strength: Who has hardned him&s;elf a|gain&s;t God and pro&s;pered? But tho' our Hearts &s;hould be fill'd with a &s;olemn Awe of God's Maje&s;ty while we hear his Voice thundering in the Heavens, yet let the Friends of God beware of a &s;lavi&s;h Dread of God's Judgments, and Diffidence in his Word; and let them &s;weetly re&s;ign them&s;elves by Faith into their Father's Hands, humbly adoring and &s;ilently &s;ub|mitting to his unerring Di&s;po&s;als, which are always Wi&s;e, and Ju&s;t, and Good. <HI>Our God is a Rock, his Ways are Perfect, a God of Truth, and without Iniquity, ju&s;t and right is he.</HI> I add no more, but Glo|ry and Prai&s;e to God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, to which let Men and Angels &s;ay, AMEN.</P>
