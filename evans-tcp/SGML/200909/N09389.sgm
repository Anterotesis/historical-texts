<OPENER><SALUTE>HONOURED SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been often ob&s;erved, that Men are apt to run from one Extreme to another, and perhaps they do &s;o as much in their treatment of Rulers, as in any of their Affairs; for as long as they have hopes of Favours from them, their Addre&s;&s;es will be filled with Compliment and Flattery; but when di&s;appointed, it is turned to Slander and Abu&s;e: Examples of which, at this Day, in our Nation and Land, are too con&s;picu|ous, and their Mi&s;chief too &s;en&s;ibly felt, to need a Proof: Therefore I &s;hall beg Leave to depart from this modern Road, and attempt to follow the ancient Example before me, of avoiding flat|tering Titles on one Hand, and fal&s;e Accu&s;ation on the other, and &s;peak out plainly &s;ome of my Views of the Truth, concerning an Affair which has lately made con&s;iderable Noi&s;e in this Pro|vince. In doing of which I &s;hall fir&s;t make a few Remarks upon the chief Pleas I have heard, for civil Rulers exerci&s;ing their Power to &s;upport religious Wor&s;hip; and then upon their late Treatment of the Bapti&s;ts in particular.</P>
<P>The leading Plea that I have heard made, for rulers exerci&s;ing Authority in the Affair is, that ancient Rulers did &s;o; and the Church has a Promi&s;e, that Kings &s;hall be her nur&s;ing Fathers, and Queens her nur&s;ing Mothers. It is readily granted that Rulers as well as others ought to be
<PB N="4" REF="011972_0003_0F87CE8AF86345B0">good Men, and to u&s;e all their Influence in a Go&s;pel Way, to promote Religion; but I am not convinced that they have any Warrant to u&s;e the civil Sword to <HI>force</HI> any to &s;upport religious Wor&s;hip. I find that when the co&s;tly Furniture for Wor&s;hip was to be prepared in the Wilderne&s;s, though the great Lawgiver, if he had &s;een fit, could have as exactly proportioned each Man's part, as to have given the Pattern of what was to be made; yet in&s;tead of that, after letting the People know what was wanted, he &s;ays, <Q>Who|&s;oever is of a <HI>willing</HI> Heart, let <HI>him bring</HI> an Offering to the Lord, Gold, Silver, &amp;c.</Q> Exod. xxxv. 5. And when the Temple was to be built in Canaan, with va&s;t Co&s;t indeed, David like a nur&s;ing Father led the Way, and of his <HI>own pro|per Goods,</HI> offered very largely thereto; and then exhorted his People to do the like, which had &s;uch Effect, that with grateful Wonder he could &s;ay, <Q>As for me, in the Uprightne&s;s of mine Heart I have <HI>willingly</HI> offered all the&s;e things; and now have I &s;een with Joy thy People which are pre&s;ent here, to offer <HI>willingly</HI> unto thee.</Q> 1 Chron. xxix. 3, 17. And though particular Offerings of Money and other Things, were en|joined upon every Man by the Law, for the Support of Wor&s;hip, yet I cannot find any Al|lowance, much more Commandment, for the u&s;e of any Force to collect it. As plain an In&s;tance, and the plaine&s;t, of their Method of proceeding, that I have ob&s;erved, is in 2 Chron. xxiv. 9, 10. When after a terrible Sea&s;on of Declen&s;ion and Corruption, the King was &s;tirred up for a Refor|mation, and the Levites being negligent in the
<PB N="5" REF="011972_0004_0F87CE8D240CC280">Affair, he cau&s;ed a <HI>Proclamation</HI> to be made through his Kingdom, to <HI>bring in</HI> to the Lord the <HI>Collection</HI> which Mo&s;es the Servant of God laid upon I&s;rael; and <HI>all the Princes, and all the People rejoiced and brought in.</HI> They <HI>brought</HI> it them&s;elves; and I cannot find but one Intimation, in all their Hi&s;tory, of the u&s;e of <HI>Force</HI> in &s;uch Affairs, and that will hardly be pleaded as a Pre|cedent for us now to follow. 1 Sam. vi. 16.</P>
<P>And if Force was not u&s;ed under a Law given from infallible Authority, what &s;hall we think of it among tho&s;e who profe&s;s to renounce Infallibi|lity! The Go&s;pel expre&s;ly allows of the civil Magi&s;trate's u&s;e of the <HI>Sword to execute Wrath,</HI> in the Kingdoms of this World; but though the crafty Jews, when they found that their Charge again&s;t Je&s;us of <HI>Bla&s;phemy,</HI> would not avail with a Roman Governour, they then tried to repre&s;ent him as an Enemy to <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> yet when Pilate en|quired into the Ca&s;e, Je&s;us an&s;wered, <Q>My King|dom is not <HI>of this World;</HI> if my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants <HI>fight:</HI>&mdash;But now is my Kingdom <HI>not from hence.</HI></Q> And goes on to &s;hew that his King|dom does not receive it's Support <HI>from</HI> earthly Power, but <HI>from</HI> TRUTH. Joh. xviii. 36, 37. If &s;o, then what is that Religion which it's Pro|fe&s;&s;ors often &s;ay, <Q>would &s;oon fall if it was not &s;upported by civil Power?</Q> How much more agreeable to our Lord's Words, are Mr. Locke's Sentiments, than the&s;e Men's? He &s;ays, <Q>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of Laws is not to provide for the Truth of Opinions, but for the Safety and Security of
<PB N="6" REF="011972_0005_0F87CE8D2E768030">the Common-wealth, and of every particular man's Goods and Per&s;on; and &s;o it ought to be; for TRUTH certainly would do well enough if &s;he were once left to &s;hift for her&s;elf. She &s;eldom has received, and I fear never will receive, much A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Power of great Men; to whom &s;he is but rarely known, and more rarely welcome. She is not taught by Laws, nor has &s;he any need of <HI>Force</HI> to procure her Entrance into the Minds of Men. Errors indeed prevail by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of foreign and borrowed Succours.&mdash;The Care of Souls cannot belong to the civil Magi&s;trate, be|cau&s;e his Power con&s;i&s;ts only in outward <HI>Force;</HI> but true and &s;aving Religion con&s;i&s;ts in the in|ward Per&s;ua&s;ion of the Mind, without which nothing can be acceptable to God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Letter on Toleration.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>But upon this I hear &s;ome &s;ay, <Q>This relates to Liberty of Con&s;cience, but we hope you don't call <HI>Money</HI> Con&s;cience!</Q> No; we tru&s;t we know the Difference between them, and wi&s;h our Neighbours did too, who &s;o often deprive others of their <HI>ju&s;t Rights;</HI> for as a late Writer well ob|&s;erves, <Q>To allow Mankind as Individuals, the free Choice of their Religion, and yet to take by <HI>Force</HI> their E&s;tates from them to &s;upport a Religion or Wor&s;hip which they do not choo&s;e, is a piece of <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> that would make even a moral Heathen blu&s;h; yet many In&s;tances of the &s;ame have we had, and &s;till have.</Q> And what Work do the&s;e Men make of our Lord's repre&s;enting to Pilate, that he need not fear his
<PB N="7" REF="011972_0006_0F87CE8DD95B2E30">Kingdom's interfering with Cae&s;ar's, becau&s;e his Servants were not to promote it by the <HI>Sword,</HI> but with <HI>Truth?</HI> For now they tell us, that then the Rulers were Heathens, but when they became chri&s;tian, they ought to exerci&s;e Power to &s;upport Religion: Which is no better than to make our Lord &s;ay to Pilate, <Q>You need not &s;ear my giv|ing Trouble to the valiant <HI>Romans,</HI> for I have not Power to do it, and am not likely to get the Sword into my Hand until long after Cae&s;ar is dead!</Q></P>
<P>Accordingly when Peter's pretended Succe&s;&s;or had got the Sword into his Hand, he did much more with it than to cut off Men's <HI>Ears,</HI> for he cut their Souls and Bodies a&s;under in a helli&s;h Manner; and though &s;uch an u&s;e of it is much out of Credit among us, yet to u&s;e it in the very Language of <HI>Eli</HI>'s Sons, is much pleaded for, viz. If you will not <HI>give it me,</HI> I will <HI>take it by Force!</HI></P>
<P>Another Plea for &s;uch Conduct is, they &s;ay, <Q>The&s;e Lands were given upon Condition of &s;upporting our Wor&s;hip, and if you do not like the Condition you may go off and leave them.</Q>&mdash; By whom were they given? If by our Fathers, they did not intend to take our Money for no|thing, (as their Children now do) for they in|tended to <HI>make</HI> us religious, as well as to &s;upport Religion: Accordingly about the Year 1646, they made a Law to puni&s;h any that &s;hould turn their backs, or go out of the place of Wor&s;hip when an Infant was to be &s;prinkled. And in
<PB N="8" REF="011972_0007_0F87CE93F7E48090">1651, as Mr. <HI>John Clark,</HI> Pa&s;tor of a <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> Church in <HI>Newport,</HI> with his Friends, were at Wor&s;hip in their own Way, on Lord's-day July 20th. at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Witter</HI>'s in <HI>Lynn,</HI> they were &s;eized, and forcibly carried to the Pari&s;h Wor&s;hip, and afterward &s;ent Pri&s;oners to <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> where one was fined &pound;. 20. and another &pound;. 30. Not only for &s;etting up another Wor&s;hip; but part of their Crime was, their not joining in the Pari&s;h Wor&s;hip when they had carried them there; and he that was fined &pound;. 30 for refu&s;ing to pay it, was whipt 30 La&s;hes: And two of his Friends, for openly taking him by the Hand, and prai&s;ing God for his Courage and Con&s;tancy, were fined 40&s;. each, or to be whipt. <Q>Thus, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Neal,</HI> the Government of <HI>New-England,</HI> for the &s;ake of Uniformity in divine Wor&s;hip, broke in upon the natural Rights of Mankind, puni&s;hing Men, not for di&s;turbing of the <HI>State,</HI> but for their differing Sentiments in Religion.</Q> And though Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> pleads, that, <Q>This Separation of the <HI>Annabapti&s;ts</HI> (as he calls them) was a manife&s;t Violation of the Laws of the Common-wealth, concerning the orderly ga|thering of Churches;</Q> yet, Mr. <HI>Neal</HI> replies, this Plea, <Q>Condemns all the di&s;&s;enting Con|gregations that have been gathered in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;ince the Act of Uniformity in the Year 1662.</Q> And, &s;ays he, <Q>Let the Reader judge, who had mo&s;t Rea&s;on to complain; the <HI>New-England</HI> Churches, who would neither &s;uffer the <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI> to live quietly in their Communion, nor &s;eparate peaecably from it?

And therefore his Argument is good for nothing.</NOTE> we compel none to Mens Inventions.&mdash;If it did make Men Hypocrites, yet better to be Hypocrites than profane Per|&s;ons.

<PB N="10" REF="011972_0009_0F87CE974C8AE060">thinking that Hypocri&s;y does &s;ome good, than they do in any of their Virtues! And if our Fa|thers erred in &s;uch Compul&s;ions then, what are tho&s;e doing who bring the&s;e Errors to ju&s;tify their own Compul&s;ions now! If it be &s;aid, that our Lands were given us by Charter, then it is well known that the Charter gives general Liberty of Con&s;cience, and gives others no more Power to compel <HI>us</HI> to &s;upport <HI>their</HI> Wor&s;hip, than it does <HI>us</HI> to compel <HI>others</HI> to &s;upport <HI>ours.</HI></P>
<P>When we come to this, &s;ome would bear us in hand, that we have actually as much Liberty as the other Denomination; therefore to &s;uch I will &s;uppo&s;e a Ca&s;e, that I heartily wi&s;h they may never experience: Suppo&s;e <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> &s;hould be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in New-England, and yet &s;hould allow them a Toleration, but only upon the&s;e Terms, that they mu&s;t certify, not only concerning their Church-members, but al&s;o of every Per&s;on in their Congregations, that they believe them to be <HI>con|&s;cientiou&s;ly</HI> of their Per&s;ua&s;ion, or el&s;e have them all taxed to &s;upport Epi&s;copacy; yea, and to do this by &s;uch a certain Day <HI>every</HI> Year, and (their Mini&s;ter being one that <HI>mu&s;t</HI> &s;ign the Certificate) if any Difficulty &s;hould happen between the Church and him, &s;o as to prevent its being done by the appointed <HI>Day,</HI> then to have their Church and all taxed to &s;upport other Wor&s;hip (as we have had &s;uch an In&s;tance of a Church con&s;i&s;ting of above 50 Members): Add to which, if the tolerating Laws &s;hould be attended with the Cor|ruption Mr. Locke de&s;cribes, viz. <Q>Princes &s;peak|ing or writing to their Servants, in their ordi|nary

And if after long Struggles in this Way, a perpetual Law &s;hould be made, which cut off a Number of their Brethren from any &s;hadow of this Liberty at all; by Virtue of which, their Lands, which they had cleared with the peril of their Lives, becau&s;e of Indian Savages, &s;hould be torn from them to &s;upport others Wor&s;hip, and that at &s;uch a rate that 20 Acres, with a Building on it, and a good Orchard, which is particularly valuable in a new Place, &s;hould all be &s;old for 35<ABBR>&s;.</ABBR> and after five Journies in a Year, of above an hundred Miles, to the General Court, and long waiting there for Relief, &s;hould at la&s;t be told by a Number of its Members, <Q>That they had good Right to make that Law, and to keep the&s;e People under it as long as they plea&s;ed;</Q> which Law the King him&s;elf could not di&s;annul, if it was let alone a|nother

If upon this a worthy Mini&s;ter, lately come among them, &s;hould, with Advice of his Brethren, publi&s;h a brief Sketch of their capital Grievances; yet, in&s;tead of any fair An|&s;wer, &s;hould be treated with &s;uch Stuff as this:&mdash; <Q>There is a little up&s;tart Gentleman, lately &s;ettled in Town,&mdash;the <HI>Youth</HI> di&s;covers a mo&s;t in|&s;ufferable <HI>Arrogance:</HI>&mdash;I very much <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> he is one employed by the <HI>Enemies</HI> of America, to <HI>defame</HI> and blacken the Colonies;&mdash;to &s;pread the <HI>Seeds</HI> of <HI>Di&s;cord</HI> among the Provinces,</Q> &amp;c. &amp;c. And yet that the Writer of all this &s;hould have the Impudence to &s;ub&s;cribe him&s;elf a <HI>Catholick</HI> Member of this &s;ame Denomination of People!</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e all this, and more of like Nature, &s;hould happen, could all the Men upon Earth, ever per&s;wade them to believe, that they were al|lowed equal Liberty with their Oppre&s;&s;ors!

<P><PB N="13" REF="011972_0012_0F87CE9919CE52C0">
And though we have &s;ufficient Evidence, that a principal In&s;trument of our capital Grievance, is one who has been openly honored by the late Governor, for his appearing in Oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e called Sons of LIBERTY; yet we have as full Evidence, that we have &s;uffered from the other Party, into which our Country is &s;o unhappily di|vided: So that we cannot ju&s;tly lay the blame of all our Troubles to either Side. And what I have &s;een has often reminded me of Mr. <HI>Wright</HI>'s Remark, &s;ixty Years ago:</P>
<Q><L>'Tho' Whigs and Tories be each others Foes,</L>
<L>'And act in divers Circles, yet they clo&s;e</L>
<L>'In this great Centre, and at la&s;t do fall</L>
<L>'Upon the point of wi&s;hing SELF HAD ALL.'</L></Q>
<P>Therefore I have made this Attempt to turn each Side to read an ancient Law, which, though often forgotten by us, yet will be that by which we mu&s;t all be acquitted or condemned, after all earthly Law-books are burnt up; and Dr. Watts's Comment upon it may doubtle&s;s be helpful in the Affair:</P>
<Q><L>'Is Rea&s;on ever at a Lo&s;s?</L>
<L>'Call in Self-love to judge the Cau&s;e:</L>
<L>'Let thy own fonde&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion &s;hew</L>
<L>'How we &s;hould treat our Neighbour too.'</L></Q>
<P>If this Law of Equity may but now have its proper Influence, both with Regard to what we have already &s;uffered, and with Regard to our fu|ture Liberty; then if any of our People &s;hould
<PB N="14" REF="011972_0013_0F87CE99EB2FF438">interrupt the civil Peace of their Neighbours, or of the Province, let them be complained of and welcome, and puni&s;hed too according to the de|merit of their Crimes: But until that is done, all the Smoke of News-Papers can never make us in&s;en&s;ible of what we feel.</P>
<P>If an An&s;wer to the Cambridge piece, wrote by one of our Brethren, who has experienced much of the&s;e Things, had arrived in Town &s;ea|&s;onably, it would have prevented the Occa&s;ion that has been taken to abu&s;e a Stranger; which, as it confirms what I have wrote, and will &s;erve farther to open the Truth: It is in&s;erted here, and is as follows:</P>
<LETTER>

<P>PLea&s;e to in&s;ert the following in your Paper, in An&s;wer to a piece in your Paper of Nov. 12. 1770. wherein the Writer tries to clear the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts-Bay from having oppre&s;&s;ed the Bapti&s;ts in the lea&s;t Degree, and &s;ays, <Q>If any one have &s;uffered, let him appear.</Q></P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer: At South-Hadley a Bap|ti&s;t Church was gathered &s;ome years ago, who took Advice of one of the be&s;t Lawyers in the County, and carried in their Certificate, yet they were rated to the Paedobapti&s;t Mini&s;ter, and their Goods &s;trained away: The Ca&s;e was carried to Court, and they were ca&s;t, and had the Charges of two Courts to pay, and then they gave the Town about twenty Dollars to let them be free for the future; and &s;o with a <HI>great Sum</HI> obtained they their Freedom, who were truly <HI>free born.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="011972_0014_0F87CE9AB756F248">
In the Di&s;trict of Montague is another Bapti&s;t Church, who carried in their Certificate by direc|tion of a Lawyer, yet the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors put them into the Mini&s;ter's rate: The Con&s;table made Di&s;tre&s;s upon one of the Committee who &s;igned the Cer|tificate. &mdash;When they came to Court, they were ca&s;t, becau&s;e (&s;aid the Judge) he witne&s;&s;ed for him&s;elf, when yet there were two more to witne&s;s with him. They appealed to the Superior Court, and have attended two, and the Ca&s;e is hung up to the third, and all this time they are left in the Hands of their Adver&s;aries, who treat them in a mo&s;t barbarous Manner, driving away their Cattle and &s;elling them at an Out-cry, for their Mini|&s;ter's rate. At Shute&s;bury, one Daniel Fi&s;k, not|with&s;tanding his Certificate, was &s;eized by two Con&s;tables at once, held under Keepers &s;ome Time; and though the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors met and re|lea&s;ed him, yet no Recompence was made for his lo&s;s of Time and Charge. At Colerain, Hezekiah Smith, and John Call, Members of the Church in A&s;h field, were both &s;eized in the dead of Winter to be carried to Goal; but after they had put them to a great deal of Trouble and lo&s;s of Time, they let them go.&mdash;At Che&s;terfield, one William White, al&s;o a Member of the Bapti&s;t Church in A&s;hfield, yet is put into the Mini&s;ter's rate; and when he petitioned in a Town-Meeting to be relea&s;ed, they refu&s;ed, and the Mini&s;ter told the Con&s;table if he would not pay to &s;train upon him. All the&s;e Accounts I had from the Per&s;ons own Mouths.</P>

When they had got him &s;ettled, then we mu&s;t build their Metting-Hou&s;e, and pay his Salary until that was done. So we were forced to &s;ell off part of our Lands under Price, to get Money to pay the Tax on the re&s;t; and &s;ome they &s;old at Vendue for a mere trifle. Being no longer able to bear this cruel Oppre&s;&s;ion, in 1768, we laid the Matter before the General Court, and cried to them as to the Fathers of our Country for help; and they ordered us to notify the Town and Proprietors Clerks of our Petition, and that they &s;hould &s;u&s;pend the Collection of Taxes from us until the Court &s;it again: Yet a few Days after our Petitioner came away, they pa&s;&s;ed an Act im|powering the Paedobapti&s;ts to rai&s;e Money for their Mini&s;ter and Meeting-Hou&s;e, and a&s;&s;e&s;s all the Lands, be they in who&s;e Hands they would; and if any did not pay to &s;ell the Land for the Money. By Virtue of that Act they &s;old la&s;t April about 400 Acres of our Lands at an Out|cry. I paid all their Demands but about 22&s;. yet

Since which, &s;ome of them have broke into our Fields, breaking down our Fences, mea&s;uring off our Lands, tore up &s;ixteen Apple-trees, and abu&s;ed &s;ome who &s;tood in their Way.

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> If you want to &s;ee the Ca&s;e of A&s;hfield-Bapti&s;ts drawn to the life, read Low's Preface to his Almanack for 1771, from the 1&s;t to the 20th Line. Mr. Low's Words refer'd to are tho&s;e, <Q>My dear Countrymen, the la&s;t time I made my public Appearance before you in this Character, I entertained a plea&s;ing Expectation, that by the return of this Year, the unhappy Difficulties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the Nation would have been re|moved, a redre&s;s of Grievances obtained, and we in&s;tated in the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Rights and Privileges, which as Britons we have de|rived from our Nativity; and on which the &s;ignal Happine&s;s and peculiar Glory of the Common-wealth depends. But how often are our greate&s;t Expectations di&s;appointed, our rai|&s;ed Hopes da&s;hed, and our flattering Dreams vani&s;hed? Our Grievances, in&s;tead of being in the lea&s;t redre&s;&s;ed, are rather augmented, and the cau&s;es of Complaint increa&s;ed. We have been &s;tigmatized as rebellious and &s;editious,&mdash;abu&s;ed by the mo&s;t flagrant Mi&s;repre&s;entations,&mdash;&s;u&s;|tained the mo&s;t intolerable Hard&s;hips, and en|dured the mo&s;t provoking In&s;ults.&mdash;Treated like Criminals condemned for the mo&s;t atrocious Offences, the Ears of the Mighty have been deafned to the repeated Cries, Remon&s;trances and Petitions, of as loyal and obedient a People as any in his Maje&s;ty's Dominions.</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>A Friend to his Country de&s;ires Liberty here to add, That &s;ince America in general do not a&s;k it as a Favour, but claim it as their e&s;&s;ential Right, to <HI>give</HI> their Money, and not have it <HI>forced</HI> from
<PB N="20" REF="011972_0019_0F87CE9E785BF2B0">them without their <HI>Con&s;ent,</HI> either by them&s;elves or their Repre&s;entatives; and hundreds of Com|plaints and Remon&s;trances have been &s;ent to Eng|land again&s;t being deprived of this Right: And they look upon them&s;elves intolerably abu&s;ed, be|cau&s;e the&s;e Complaints are not heard and regard|ed. Mu&s;t it not be very a&s;toni&s;hing that any of the &s;ame Men, &s;hould at the &s;ame Time &s;hew wor&s;e Treatment to their Fellow-&s;ubjects here, than what they complain of from the higher Pow|ers! I &s;ay, wor&s;e; for what they complain of, is having their Money <HI>forced</HI> away to &s;upport civil Government, where the Magi&s;trate is armed with the <HI>Sword</HI> as the <HI>Mini&s;ter of God, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.&mdash;For this cau&s;e pay you Tribute.</HI> Their Complaints therefore, are only again&s;t the undue u&s;e of Force in civil Matters where Force properly belongs; yet they u&s;e it towards their Neighbours, in eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, where Force has no Right at all. For as Mr. Locke, in his Letter upon Toleration, ob&s;erves, <Q>To give Laws, to receive Obedience, and com|pel with the Sword, belong to none but the civil Magi&s;trate; and upon this ground I affirm, that the Magi&s;trate's Power extends not to the e&s;tabli&s;hing any Articles of Faith, or forms of Wor&s;hip by force of Laws: For Laws are of no Force without Penalties.&mdash;The care of Souls cannot belong to the civil Magi&s;trate, becau&s;e his Power con&s;i&s;ts only in outward Force: But true and &s;aving Religion con&s;i&s;ts in the inward Per&s;ua&s;ion of the Mind; without which no|thing can be acceptable to God.</Q> And a late Writer &s;ays, "That Mankind have a right to be
<PB N="21" REF="011972_0020_0F87CE9F24EA41A0">free in the Choice of Religion, is a Truth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> cannot be denied, and is a Privilege dearer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ober Chri&s;tian, than any civil Privilege <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> ever; and no Authority on Earth have any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> to take it away; nor can, without being guilty of a&s;&s;uming that Power over others, which God ne|ver gave them: And to allow Men as Individuals the free Choice of their Religion, and yet to take by <HI>Force</HI> their E&s;tates from them to &s;upport a Religion or Wor&s;hip which they do not chu&s;e, is a piece of Oppre&s;&s;ion that would make even a moral Heathen blu&s;h; yet many &s;uch In&s;tances have we had, and &s;till have!"</P>
<P>I think if the&s;e things do not cau&s;e &s;ome remor&s;e in tho&s;e who have thus oppre&s;&s;ed their Brethren, they mu&s;t be more &s;tupid than tho&s;e who had been cruel to Jo&s;eph; for when they met with like Treatment they &s;aid, <HI>We are verily guilty concerning our Brother!</HI> yea, more &s;tupid than a Heathen King, who, though what he met with was by the hands of Men, yet &s;aid, <HI>As I have done, &s;o God hath requited me.</HI> Judg. i. 7.</P>
<P>For if it be Oppre&s;&s;ion to take away from a People the right of <HI>giving</HI> their Money, either by them&s;elves or their Repre&s;entatives, to &s;upport civil Government, where Force belongs (as I believe it is) what mu&s;t it be to deprive them of a right that never can be conveyed to any Repre&s;entative! For unle&s;s a Man could con&s;titute another to an&s;wer for him at the Bar of God, it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to convey to another a right to compel him or others to attend, or &s;upport any Wor&s;hip contrary to their Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="011972_0021_0F87CE9FD9D27D28">
What then &s;hall we think of tho&s;e Men who often accu&s;e their Neighbours of <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> only becau&s;e they plead with Mo&s;es, for Liberty to carry their Sub&s;tance with them, to help &s;upport the Wor&s;hip they believe to be right, while the&s;e Accu&s;ers act the part of Pharaoh, who when he could no longer hold their Per&s;ons, yet &s;aid, <HI>Let your Flocks, and your Herds be &s;tayed!</HI></P>
<P>Thus, honoured Sir, you have laid before you, and left to your Con&s;ideration, a plain Repre&s;en|tation of the true State of the&s;e Affairs, by one who has &s;ome near Apprehen&s;ions of the Account we mu&s;t all pre&s;ently give of our Conduct, before the great Tribunal; and who de&s;ires ever to ap|prove him&s;elf a true Friend to his Country, and in his Station a loyal Subject to all lawful Autho|rity, and ready to &s;erve his Generation by the will of God.</P>
