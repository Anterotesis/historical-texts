<HEAD>A Mathematical Que&s;tion.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST a variety of plea&s;ing cu|rio&s;ities, which, in the bloom of youth, attracted my attention, I found a pe|culiar ta&s;te to <HI>mathematical &s;tudies.</HI> I fancied my&s;elf qualified to an&s;wer hard que&s;tions, &s;olve difficulties, and determine things ab&s;tru&s;e; but, in the cour&s;e of my pur&s;uits, I was acco&s;ted by an accompli&s;hed mathematician, who confounded all my &s;kill, by propounding to me a que&s;tion, &s;tated in the following order.</P>
<P>There is a certain large country, formerly a kingdom, &s;o rich and flouri&s;hing, that for excel|lency and dignity, it was the &s;econd in the univer&s;e; an i&s;land, &s;ituate in the mid&s;t of the temperate zone, and &s;urrounded with the pacific ocean; free from all &s;corching heat, chilling cold, or mole&s;ta|tion by &s;torms; no barren land, unhealthful wa|ters, or infectious air, were found therein; no prickling bramble, poi&s;onous herb, or unhwhol&s;ome fruit, grew therein; no ravenous bird, voracious bea&s;t, or venomous reptile, infe&s;ted the land: it abounded with all the &s;ub&s;tantial ble&s;&s;ings of life: and was embelli&s;hed with all the beauties and de|corations of nature. There was no deficiency of any thing that might conduce to the felicity of the inhabitants, who enjoyed uninterrupted health and peace, liberty and plenty.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="009151_0003_10310C0DB3089728">This delightful realm was &s;ubject to the grand Monarch of the world, who honoured it with many gracious vi&s;its, conferred on it many royal favours, and granted the inhabitants all the privileges that were nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute them a free and happy people: and, to con&s;ummate their glory, a king of their own nation; he dignified in the throne, and crowned with glory had honour, the elde&s;t prince of the blood; a per&s;on endued with amplitude of all natural perfections, a noble genius, untainted virtue, and of perfect &s;tature, without blemi&s;h; and gave him to wife a royal prince&s;s, a perfect virgin, of exqui&s;ite beauty, accompli&s;hed with all the virtues, and amiable qualities, which adorn the female &s;ex.</P>
<P>And for the &s;afety of the &s;tate, becau&s;e the coa&s;ts were not inacce&s;&s;ible, neither were the fortifi|cations impregnable, and the prince was but young; therefore, the univer&s;al Sovereign recommended him, and all his &s;ubjects, to the &s;uper-intendency of his <HI>grand Geometrician;</HI> by who&s;e infallible di|rections the univer&s;al empire is ju&s;tly proportioned, and all the affairs thereof accurately regulated; who&s;e repre&s;entations are all the &s;tated in the exacte&s;t manner; his de&s;criptions appear in the mo&s;t curious figures, and all his rules are models of perfection: his draughts are a compleat &s;y&s;tem of rectitude and harmony, and his in&s;tructions are perfectly refined; so that he is a con&s;ummate pattern of ab&s;olute infallibility. No cau&s;e can mi&s;carry that is directed by his council, nor can any people cea&s;e to be happy, &s;o long as they yield ample &s;ubjection to his dictates. &mdash;This great ma&s;ter of &s;cience was appointed guardian, regent, vicegerent, or governor of the whole realm, to pre&s;ide over, and in&s;pect all the affairs of the prince and the people: to him they were accountable for all their actions; and, to prevent any infraction or confu&s;ion

in the land, every circum&s;tance was &s;ubject to his cognizance; and the tenure whereby all the Inha|bitants held their e&s;tates and enjoyments, was, conformity to his mo&s;t excellent pre&s;criptions. Thus this beatific region was amply accommodated with every enjoyment that was nece&s;&s;ary to per|petuate its felicity.</P>
<P>But a foreigner, of the race of the giants, who, for their rebellion again&s;t the King of kings, were ba|ni&s;hed from the royal palace, into the unilluminable de&s;ert, found means, in di&s;gui&s;e, to enter this &s;pa|cious country; and, by fal&s;e pretences, and feigned addre&s;s, obtained acce&s;s to the prince&s;s; until, by &s;ubtile arts, and delu&s;ive flatteries, he prevailed again&s;t her cha&s;tity: &s;o &s;he committed adultery with him, and conceived by him. And, while &s;he was advancing in her pregnancy, &s;he prevailed again&s;t the virtue of the prince, &s;o that he polluted him&s;elf, by committing adultery with her. For, though &s;he was his wife, it was adultery for a per|&s;on in his &s;tation to have conver&s;ation with her, &s;ince &s;he was &s;o ba&s;ely deflowered. And &s;o it was, that he conceived by her, and they both became pregnant with the &s;ame thing, and brought forth a <HI>mon&s;ter.</HI> As &s;oon as this mon&s;ter was born, the prince and prince&s;s fell from the throne, and had no more capacity to &s;way the &s;ceptre, or maintain their dignity; for he poi&s;oned, with his fir&s;t breath, the man and the woman who brought him forth: all their excellent qualities were corrupted, all their beauties deformed, and all their glory laid in the du&s;t. They died a lingering death, in exile, &s;hame, and &s;orrow; and their names have been had in execration throughout the world ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>The form of this unnatural production was &s;o horrible, as a&s;toni&s;hed every eye that beheld him; his roaring &s;o hideous, as made every ear tingle <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="4" REF="009151_0005_0F869EC1B38400E8">
every one &s;ick where the &s;cent came; and he grew to &s;uch an enormous &s;ize, that his &s;hadow filled the whole land with darkne&s;s; and &s;o invincible in his power, that no army upon earth was able to with|&s;tand him; and he became &s;o voracious, that he &s;pread death and de&s;truction wherever he came; &s;wallowing up men and women alive, devouring every living creature, and making the whole land a de&s;olate wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the horrors that appear in this mon&s;ter, the mi&s;cheif done, and mi&s;ery intro|duced by him, which manife&s;tly proves him to be an enemy to nature; yet, he is &s;uch a ma&s;ter of enchantments, and has the delu&s;ive art of di&s;gui&s;ing him&s;elf, and infatuating the people, that he has drawn all the inhabitants of the land into a con&s;e|deracy with him, to break all the mea&s;ures of the governor: and they accordingly have ca&s;t off all allegiance to, and de&s;pi&s;ed all the admonitions of, their faithful guardian, and are in open rebellion again&s;t him. They, like a di&s;tracted banditti, follow their mortal foe, and execute his cur&s;ed projects; while he is &s;porting him&s;elf with their wretchedne&s;s; di&s;tre&s;&s;ing them with all kinds of torture, and de&s;troying them by all kinds of death. None e&s;cape him, of whatever condition, age, or &s;ex they be; he tyrannizes over all. And every creature, that is &s;ubjugated by him, mu&s;t fall a prey to his rapacious fury, and is de&s;tined to ine|vitable de&s;truction.&mdash;And, if he be permitted thus to proceed, there will not be left alive a &s;oul to breathe in the whole land.</P>
<P>Wherefore, the de&s;ign of the en&s;uing que&s;tion is, to di&s;cover, whether there be a po&s;&s;ibility of any expedient being found, to &s;top the ravage of this horrible mon&s;ter, to prevent the direful effects of his tyranny, and &s;ave the country from total ruin.</P>

<P>When this ma&s;ter of &s;kill, fir&s;t laid before me this que&s;tion. I looked upon it with an air of di&s;dain, as being matter too ea&s;y to be made the
<PB N="6" REF="009151_0007_10310C1AC82C6840">
&s;ubject of &s;erious attention; and thought to &s;olve it, as a diver&s;ion only: but, having pondered a while thereon, and finding &s;ome difficulties ari&s;e, I a&s;ked him, whether he him&s;elf was the projector?</P>
<P>But (in reply) he a&s;ked me what conceptions I formed concerning it?</P>
<P>I told him, I took it to be an enigmatical prob|lem, propo&s;ed to puzzle, or try the &s;kill of the ingenious.</P>
<P>But he gravely replied, that it was not fiction, but reality; that the matter was too &s;erious to be made a <HI>droll of wit;</HI> and that a determinate &s;olution was a concern of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, whether it immediately concerned him&s;elf?</P>
<P>He told me, he him&s;elf was the rightful gover|nor of the country, which this mon&s;ter had &s;o long infe&s;ted; and that all the damage done, was again&s;t his honour; to the injury of his government, and the de&s;truction of subjects, under his juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him (&s;ince he was governor) if it was not in his power to re&s;i&s;t, and expel the mon&s;ter out of his dominions?</P>
<P>He told me, it was utterly out of his power to de&s;troy him, to &s;top his progre&s;s, or prevent the effects of his fury; otherwi&s;e he would not have &s;uffered him to proceed in his violence, to that outrageous degree as he had done: for, before this mon&s;ter was born, he took all proper mea|&s;ures to prevent any &s;uch unnatural birth; and, as &s;oon as he was brought forth, he pur&s;ued him with the utmo&s;t diligence, to &s;eize and de&s;troy him, but un&s;ucce&s;sfully; and, &s;ince he grew &s;o formida|ble, he had &s;till continued to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means, both offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, to prevent his de|&s;tructive mea&s;ures; but the utmo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s he had ever been able to obtain again&s;t this deadly enemy, was only, at &s;ome times, a little to retard his ra|pidity,
<PB N="7" REF="009151_0008_10310C1C8AD4B480">
but never to with&s;tand his force; but, in &s;pite of all his endeavours, the whole land was become a prey to this tyrant; not a creature had e&s;caped, but what either followed him as a willing &s;lave, groaned under thraldom to his mercile&s;s cruelty, or had already peri&s;hed by his in&s;atiable voracity. And &s;ince it appeared utterly impo&s;|&s;ible for the governor to &s;ave the life of one of his &s;ubjects, he was determined to vindicate his honour, and defend his right &s;ome other way; for which rea&s;on he pre&s;ented to me this que&s;tion, re|quiring a determinate an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Upon this, I began to deliberate on the que&s;tion with more clo&s;e attention: but the more I exa|mined it, the more difficult it appeared; and I be|gan to be convinced of my mi&s;take, in imagining it a meer <HI>puff of pedantry:</HI> for I found it truly in|tricate; not only far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing my capacity, but a&s;toni&s;hing to my Mind whereupon, I offered to return it again to the governor, de&s;iring to be excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>But he told me, he could not accept any excu&s;e, for he was determined to have ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, how he could expect ju&s;tice, where a tyrannical and invincible mon&s;ter reigned.</P>
<P>But, with a fire in his countenance, which made my heart tremble, he replied, that altho' he had not power to with&s;tand the ravenous de&s;troyer, he had power to deal with his own &s;ubjects, who had re|belled again&s;t him, in giving &s;uccour to, and form|ing alliance with, &s;uch an enemy; and ina&s;much as I was one, that did of right belong to his juri&s;|diction, but had been found in tho&s;e trea&s;onable practices, I might expect condign puni&s;hment, if I did not give a definitive an&s;wer to the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>At this &s;entence I began to be &s;eized with an uncommon horror; for I was aware that I was conver&s;ing with a per&s;on, not of a common cha|racter;
<PB N="8" REF="009151_0009_10310C1FCA1D8210">
and tho' I could not form any ju&s;t concep|tion of his meaning, yet my heart &s;mote me, upon the remembrance of &s;ome pa&s;t tran&s;actions; &s;o that I was convinced, it was &s;omething more than fiction; and I &s;et my&s;elf to ponder the mat|ters laid before me, with the utmo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s: but, in ruminating on this deep que&s;tion, I found the more I attempted to find a &s;olution, the more I was embarra&s;&s;ed; the more expedients I tried to di&s;cover the my&s;tery, the more I began to de&s;pair of a po&s;&s;ibility. My heart fainted, my fle&s;h trem|bled, and my countenance was turned to palene&s;s; I was filled with a multitude of &s;trange conjectures, all which turned to my confu&s;ion, but none to my relief. The &s;ublimity, and tremedou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;ubject, over-powered my mind, &s;o that I was obliged (for while) to quit the &s;tudy, endeavour|ing to relax, and compo&s;e my mind as well as I could, but the impre&s;&s;ion it had made upon me, prevented me from having much repo&s;e.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s, I began to reflect on my former vanity, in imagining my&s;elf able to number the &s;and, to weigh the mountains, to &s;ound the depth of the &s;eas, and to mea&s;ure the heavens; to de&s;cribe the magnitudes, di&s;tances, and revolutions of the planets; and to &s;olve the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e problems, relating to terre&s;trial operations, or cele&s;tial &s;igns; which was (now) an extreme mortification. But the mo&s;t piercing, was the levity and contempt with which I fir&s;t looked on the que&s;tion before me; by which I found my under&s;tanding confounded, and my pride laid in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>Bye and bye, I made another e&s;&s;ay, to work out a &s;olution, but finding my&s;elf at the greate&s;t non|plus, my mind began to be filled with re&s;entment, and I complained of the governor's &s;everity, to in|&s;i&s;t on my performing a ta&s;k impracticable.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009151_0010_10310C24A462A2E0">Then the governor turning upon me, with lightening in his his eyes, challenged me to prove my charge again&s;t him: telling me, that tyranny was not in his nature, but ju&s;tice was his <HI>element;</HI> and he would convince me, that his demand was ju&s;t and rea&s;onable; and, if I failed in the preformance, I had nothing to expect but death, by a mo&s;t righ|teous and unalterable determination.</P>
<P>Upon this I trembled and fell at his feet, con|fe&s;&s;ing the inju&s;tice of my complaint; intreating him to allow me time, promi&s;ing the utmo&s;t ap|plication. I al&s;o earne&s;tly reque&s;ted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for my better information into the nature of the&s;e things, hoping I &s;hould be able to &s;atisfy his de|mand.</P>
<P>But, concerning the time, he gave me no an|&s;wer at all; concerning the &s;tate of the que&s;tion, he told me, the two la&s;t branches could never be &s;olved, unle&s;s the two fir&s;t were duly under&s;tood; notwith&s;tanding, the &s;olving of the former would not be of any benefit, unle&s;s the latter could be fully demon&s;trated; that, as to the fir&s;t two parts, he was perfectly acquainted with them, in every punctilio; nor was it po&s;&s;ible for any thing relating thereto, to e&s;cape his cognizance. And according to the be&s;t rules of calculation, he had &s;tated the whole account, in the mo&s;t accurate order, in his <HI>book of records,</HI> and <HI>tables of proportion;</HI> which, for my better information, I was at fully liberty to peru&s;e. But as to the la&s;t two parts, (tho' it would be greatly to his honour and &s;atisfaction, to have them &s;olved) they were utterly beyond his line. He had never been able to penetrate into the lea&s;t, branch thereof, or to di&s;cover whether a &s;olution was po&s;&s;ible, or not; nor could he give me the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance therein.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer was &s;o pathetic and circum&s;tantial, that, in deliberating thereon, it made my heart
<PB N="10" REF="009151_0011_10310C27D38A3E38">
faint, my blood chill, and all my bones to &s;hiver. Howbeit, I pretended great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the go|vernor, (for tho' I loved him not, I dreaded his re&s;ent|ment) and feignedly &s;et my&s;elf upon a very diligent &s;earch into all the rules he gave me; but I was pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;uch de&s;pairing thoughts, that I made very little proficiency; even in tho&s;e things which were &s;tated in a very intelligible light.</P>
<P>But a conceit came into my head, (which, for a while, yielded &s;ome relief to my imagination,) <HI>viz.</HI> that he was only a &s;ubordinate governor, with a limited power, and that his threatenings might exceed his authority, and that by appealing to &s;uperior authority I might find redre&s;s, &s;o as to e&s;cape his &s;everity, altho' I did not an&s;wer his de|mand; whereupon, I began to make &s;uch enqui|ries as the&s;e, concerning him: <HI>viz.</HI> Who is this governor? Whence did he receive his authority? How far doth his power extend? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To which I was an&s;wered, that he was the king's vice-gerent, once of his hou&s;hold, and in&s;eparable from his fa|mily; that he had full power of life and death, and from him there was <HI>no appeal.</HI></P>
<P>Then the governor, with all the &s;erenity of a judge, and with &s;uch maje&s;ty as &s;eemed to &s;pread death thro' all my powers, told me, I &s;hould know his authority; then calling for his &s;ecretary, I felt a &s;hock like that of an earthquake; and imme|diately the door of a certain apartment was bur&s;t open, from whence a certain per&s;on &s;prang forth and made obei&s;ance to his highne&s;s, who familiarly received him. This per&s;on was my dome&s;tick companion, whom I had formerly treated with much in&s;olence, u&s;ing him as a &s;lave to bear my burdens: and when he prote&s;ted again&s;t my pro|ceedings, I would not &s;uffer him to &s;peak, but often attempted to &s;trangle him; and, at la&s;t, found means to confine him in a dark vault, having
<PB N="11" REF="009151_0012_10310C295C112A58">
fa&s;tened the door with bars of iron. It is not to be expre&s;&s;ed, nor &s;carcely to be conceived, how &s;urpri&s;ing this &s;hock was! But much more &s;o, when I ob&s;erved how his mien was altered, and perceived that he was the governor's &s;ecretary.&mdash;Then he bid him produce his accounts, and he laid open a train of accu&s;ations again&s;t me, conceived in terms &s;o &s;trong, and delivered in expre&s;&s;ions &s;o emphatical, that it was like &s;o many arrows of fire piercing my heart. Likewi&s;e, the burden which I formerly obliged him to bear, he now fixed unmoveable upon me, which I found an in|&s;upportable weight; I trembled under it, and was not able to &s;tand, and to remove it I found impo&s;&s;ible. &mdash; The governor al&s;o called his execu|tioner, who took and bound me with chains, beat me with many &s;tripes, and ca&s;t me into a horrible dungeon: during the&s;e proceedings, I cried for mercy, but in vain; for the governor a&s;&s;ured me, that as his authority did not admit of any appeal, &s;o neither did his &s;everity admit of any <HI>mitigation:</HI> therefore, I was committed to the vigilant in&s;pec|tion of the &s;ecretary, and the unrelenting rigour of the executioner; confined in a dark pri&s;on, bound in &s;trong chains, and cru&s;hed under the weight of an in&s;upportable burden, which did not admit me to move any way, to get a little ea&s;e. And if I made any complaint, the &s;ecretary, would &s;ilence me, by reminding me of my former con|duct; upbraiding me in the mo&s;t piercing manner, and galling me with &s;uch grinding accu&s;ations, as even to tear my heart to pieces: and then I was &s;ure to feel mo&s;t dreadful la&s;hes from the execu|tioner, &s;o &s;tinging as none can de&s;cribe, but tho&s;e that have felt his &s;tripes.</P>
<P>In this deplorable condition I &s;u&s;tained a variety of inexpre&s;&s;ible tortures; &s;ometimes wrecked with anxious thoughts concerning the que&s;tion propo&s;ed,

debating in my mind whether there was any hope, or po&s;&s;ibility of finding an an&s;wer, thereby to ob|tain my liberty; &s;ometimes &s;inking down in di|&s;tre&s;s, wearine&s;s, and de&s;pair; &s;ometimes &s;welling with rancour again&s;t the governor, and &s;ometimes re&s;tle&s;sly de&s;iring to abandon my mind to an in|&s;en&s;ibility, thereby to forget my wretchedne&s;s: but the mo&s;t di&s;tracting thought, was an appre|hen&s;ion of the governor's return, to call me before him, concerning which I was in perpetual &s;u&s;pence, as I could not obtain the lea&s;t hint of certainty re|lating to the time; nor had I any room to expect any further re&s;pite; but that the indictment exhi|bited again&s;t me by the &s;ecretary being fully proved in open court, I &s;hould receive the &s;entence of the governor, be cut a&s;under by the executioner, and my carca&s;s ca&s;t out to be devoured by the mon&s;ter; for that is the <HI>law of the country.</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances I continued, till my &s;pirit was exhau&s;ted with angui&s;h and di&s;traction, and my heart was hardened through vexation and hor|ror: and I began to conceive hopes of obtaining relief by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the mon&s;ter, ina&s;much as the governor had not power to de&s;troy him. And as I had formerly been &s;trongly attached to his in|tere&s;t, and had never violated my allegiance to him, he was ready to give me all the aid in his power; but it was thought expedient to be done without noi&s;e; therefore he &s;ent me his apothecary with &s;ome mollifying ointments, hoping thereby to enable me to &s;lip my chains. And by the&s;e I found &s;ome pre&s;ent ea&s;e, &s;o that I began to fancy I &s;hould outwit my keepers, and creep away; but, after all endeavours, I found my chains <HI>inextricable.</HI></P>
<P>Thus di&s;appointed, he &s;ent me a cunning pick|lock, with &s;ome in&s;truments very artfully con|trived, to loo&s;e my chains; when I &s;aw the &s;ub|tilties of the&s;e inventions, I thought the right ex|pedient
<PB N="13" REF="009151_0014_10310C316FE66F98">
was found imagining the device &s;ufficient to unravel the mo&s;t intricate gordian knot; but, upon trial, I found my expectations di&s;appointed, for my chains were cemented <HI>beyond the reach of art.</HI></P>
<P>Then I began to be in deep de&s;pair, but my ma&s;ter encouraged me once more to try another &s;tratagem; &s;o he prepared me an anvil, and cho&s;e &s;ome of his own &s;ervants (who appeared be&s;t qua|lified for &s;uch an enterpri&s;e) to attend me in di&s;|gui&s;e, as often as po&s;&s;ible, with files, and &s;ome|times with hammers, or other in&s;truments, as op|portunity &s;hould &s;erve, hoping to wear off my chains in time: but all means were ineffectual, for my chains proved <HI>infrangible.</HI> Neither could this work be done &s;o &s;ilently, as to e&s;cape the vigilant ob&s;ervation of the &s;ecretary, who&s;e accu&s;ations were like the &s;tinging of an adder, and his rebukes like the biting of a &s;erpent: and when&s;oever I awaked his re&s;entment, he awaked the executioner, who&s;e &s;trokes were like the torments of a &s;corpion.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, finding all &s;tratagems vain, and being quite tired out with pains and di&s;appointments, I began to grow de&s;perate; and the mon&s;ter, flaming with malice again&s;t the governor, hoping (by open force) to vanqui&s;h my keepers, break the pri&s;on, and carry me away in triumph, re&s;olved to appear in per&s;on, with all his might; which he did, and approached in the mo&s;t formidable manner, and proceeded to the attack with the utmo&s;t fury, and with great &s;ucce&s;s; for the ca&s;t up &s;uch banks that the &s;ecretary was buried under them, and made &s;uch a terrible fire, that I imagined the foundations of the pri&s;on gave way, and the &s;moak darkened the air, &s;o that the executioner was ob&s;cured from my &s;ight, and I thought he had been fled: I al&s;o fancied my chains had been broken, and was ready to &s;hout for victory. But on a &s;udden the governor
<PB N="14" REF="009151_0015_10310C34E33127C0">
appeared with a glittering &s;word in his hand, and with a voice like thunder, called the &s;ecretary, who &s;traight aro&s;e out of the rubbi&s;h, and the ex|ecutioner appearing clo&s;e by me, &s;truck me &s;uch a blow, as made me lie like one dead, expecting in&s;tantaneous de&s;truction: then the mon&s;ter ap|pearing di&s;concerted, marched off; but I remained in the mo&s;t invincible fetters, under the mo&s;t pun|gent torture, encompa&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t amazing horrors.</P>
<P>I now gave up all hope; all thoughts of finding an an&s;wer to the governor's que&s;tion cea&s;ed, and all expectation of deliverance vani&s;hed; nothing but apprehen&s;ions of inevitable ruin po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my brea&s;t. But, after &s;ome time, my old ma&s;ter pro|po&s;ed another expedient for my relief, by &s;ending his orator, in di&s;gui&s;e, as an amba&s;&s;ador, to in|treat, or negotiate with the governor, for my de|liverance. This orator interceded for me like an accompli&s;hed rhetorician, with all the alluring terms of &s;ophi&s;try, with many &s;pecious promi&s;es and propo&s;als to make, or comply with any con|ditions that &s;hould be required; and delivered him&s;elf with &s;o much eloquence, good temper, and pompous appearance, as &s;eemed to attract the attention of the &s;ecretary; and I fancied he began to look favourable upon me, which I took for an indication, that the governor inclined to accept of terms. I likewi&s;e imagined, that the executioner began to treat me with more gentlene&s;s, which I conceived mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome milder orders from the governor. Thus I &s;unk into a fond dream; for being brought &s;o low by the fatigues I had &s;uffered, a little relaxation ea&s;ily compo&s;ed me to &s;leep: but upon my awaking, I heard the governor reply to the amba&s;&s;ador, that all propo|&s;als were vain; for ju&s;tice was his province, and he &s;hould for ever be found inexorable. But this
<PB N="15" REF="009151_0016_10310C367827EE48">
amba&s;&s;ador (with all elegance of &s;tile, and &s;oftne&s;s of addre&s;s) continuing to urge for further audience; the governor &s;tepping to him, plucked off his gar|ment, whereby his nakedne&s;s was di&s;covered, and he appeared &s;uch an ugly deformed creature, as fully betrayed him to be a limb of the mon&s;ter: when finding him&s;elf expo&s;ed, he &s;culked behind a thicket, like a dog that had done &s;ome mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;ight I fainted away, being fully con|vinced of the <HI>ju&s;tice, penetration</HI> and <HI>inflexibility</HI> of the governor; knowing, that to e&s;cape from him is impracticable, and to an&s;wer his demand is, to me, impo&s;&s;ible; and unle&s;s &s;ome deliverer, or deliverance, &s;hould appear, which to me is yet unknown, I have no re&s;ource left, but am in|evitably bound over to de&s;truction; inextricable bondage, exqui&s;ite pains, and in&s;upportable terrors, are now my fixed portion, where I lie <HI>comfortle&s;s, friendle&s;s, helple&s;s,</HI> and <HI>hopele&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Now, my confinement was more &s;evere than ever; I was deprived of all liberty or power to act or move, only to gna&s;h my teeth, gnaw my tongue, and torture my own mind: I &s;aw nothing but darkne&s;s and di&s;mal &s;pectres; I heard nothing but roarings, thunders, and doleful groans; I felt nothing but chains, bars, &s;ickne&s;s, and pain; I &s;melled nothing but &s;tench and nau&s;eou&s;ne&s;s; I ta&s;ted nothing but gall and wormwood: in this condition, without relaxation, I langui&s;hed many days, perpetually expecting my final execution. At la&s;t I was alarmed with &s;omething, which I apprehended like mu&s;ick, at a great di&s;tance, which attracted my attention, and awaked &s;ome &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure; though I could not under|&s;tand the &s;ound di&s;tinctly; but as I li&s;tened to hear it, it &s;eemed to draw nearer, and I plainly perceived it was the &s;ound of a trumpet. The meaning of it I could not conceive, but I found
<PB N="16" REF="009151_0017_10310C39AEB32B70">
the nearer it approached, the more my pa&s;&s;ion was excited into an ardent de&s;ire to know whence it came, and what it might portend. While my &s;oul was thus alert in attending, the found conti|nued advancing, and rai&s;ing &s;ome faint joy in my heart, rather from the &s;weetne&s;s of the melody, than any rea&s;on I could render for my taking com|fort; until it approached &s;o near, that I heard three bla&s;ts di&s;tinctly &s;ounded, and in the &s;ounds I heard the&s;e words pronounced, GOOD-WILL, PEACE, PARDON: the&s;e words &s;eemed to give &s;ome reviving to my &s;oul, I lifted up my&s;elf to hearken if any thing further would be expre&s;&s;ed; when the trumpet &s;eeming &s;till nearer, I heard three bla&s;ts more, pronouncing the&s;e words, LOVE, WISDOM, POWER. Upon this I found a &s;weetne&s;s of joy &s;eize my heart, though I under&s;tood not the meaning, but &s;till gladly attended to hear the &s;ound repeated: bye-and-bye I heard the trumpet exceeding loud, as it were, ju&s;t before the pri&s;on-gate, &s;ounding three alarms expre&s;&s;ing the&s;e words, REDEMPTION, RECONCILIATION, SALVATION.</P>
<P>The&s;e words came with &s;o much power, that they &s;pread new life through all my faculties; I felt the foundation of the pri&s;on &s;hake, and a win|dow (which before was clo&s;e &s;hut up) bur&s;t open, whereby light &s;hined into the pri&s;on; for I per|ceived a &s;trong wind joined with the voice, which made way wherever it touched, though I knew not whence it came, nor whither it went; but by this means I enjoyed &s;ome light, and found opportu|nity to look about, to &s;ee whence the joyful &s;ound proceeded; and &s;eeing a man &s;tanding before the gate, with a banner di&s;played in one hand, and a trumpet in the other; I a&s;ked him who he was, and what his de&s;ign?</P>
<P>He told me, he was the king's me&s;&s;enger, &s;ent to proclaim good tidings.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009151_0018_10310C4042802EB8">I a&s;ked, What king?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, King SHILOH,</P>
<P>I did not know any king of that name; there|fore I de&s;ired to be informed who he was, of what line or family, in what realm was his dominion.</P>
<P>He told me, that he was the only &s;on of the uni|ver&s;al &s;overeign; a prince of &s;uch excellent dignity and merit, that he was made lord-chancellor in his father's court, and intru&s;ted with the direction of all the affairs of the empire; and his mother being a native of that (once happy, though now mi|&s;erable) country, he had a natural indubitable right to the &s;overeignty of the realm; which, &s;ince the other prince had lo&s;t, and the governor was not able to recover, his father had appointed him, to take into <HI>his own hand.</HI></P>
<P>Then I enquired what good news he brought?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, healing to the broken hearted, liberty to the captives, opening of the pri&s;on to tho&s;e that are bound, relief to them that are ready to peri&s;h, comfort to all that mourn, and to pro|claim the joyful year.</P>
<P>The bal&s;amick influence which the&s;e words had upon my &s;oul none can know, but &s;uch as have been in the like condition, and favoured with &s;ome|thing of the like kind!</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, if he had authority to perform &s;uch great things?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, that he was the king's herald &s;ent to publi&s;h the glad tidings of his good plea&s;ure, in tho&s;e places where his maje&s;ty de&s;igned him&s;elf to come, in who&s;e hand alone the power was re|&s;erved.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked, if the king was come that way?</P>
<P>He told me, it was the king's delightful em|ploy, to vi&s;it the mo&s;t de&s;olate places, to &s;eek out &s;uch as were in di&s;tre&s;s, and to deliver them; and for that purpo&s;e had &s;ent his royal proclamation,
<PB N="18" REF="009151_0019_10310C41CB4D18D0">
that every poor wretched pri&s;oner that &s;hould hear the news, and wait for his &s;alvation, might be de|livered from all bondage or mi&s;ery what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Then I a&s;ked, if the king did not in&s;i&s;t on &s;ome conditions, to be performed by the per&s;ons to whom he would grant &s;uch favours? for I knew it was not in my power to do any thing, but mu&s;t peri&s;h.</P>
<P>But the me&s;&s;enger told me, the redemption was <HI>free</HI> to &s;uch as have no power, wi&s;dom, riches, or any thing to recommend them; it being beneath the honour of his maje&s;ty to make terms with poor mi&s;erable &s;laves, but to deliver them freely, of his own royal beneficence.</P>
<P>I further enquired, if his royal bounty was not confined to &s;ome particular favourites, &s;o as that many may wait for it and not be di&s;appointed?</P>
<P>He replied, that &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings as the king be|&s;towed might well be e&s;teemed <HI>peculiar favours;</HI> but that none was ever rejected who gladly accepted his bounty: and if there were any who were not favoured with it, they were &s;uch (only) as did not &s;eek it. But that it was rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, his maje&s;ty's wi&s;dom would be&s;tow his favours where they would be received with gratitude, and upon &s;uch per&s;ons who&s;e circum&s;tances rendered the be|nefit nece&s;&s;ary and acceptable; as gifts, not to the rich, but to the poor; deliverance, not to per&s;ons at liberty, but to tho&s;e that were bound; healing, not to the whole, but the &s;ick; provi&s;ions, not to the full, but to the hungry; and there was no other re&s;triction in the king's bounty. That is, though it is not given to &s;uch as never &s;aw their need, and con&s;equently do not de&s;ire, but de&s;pi&s;e it; it is richly extended to every one, who (through his maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s) is made willing to wait for, and thankfully receive, &s;uch bounty; &s;o that none ever was denied, who earne&s;tly de&s;ired the ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>&mdash;Therefore, as no per&s;on ever had rea&s;on to com|plain
<PB N="19" REF="009151_0020_10310C43A0609EB8">
of <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> in the governor; neither had any per&s;on the lea&s;t rea&s;on to complain of the <HI>want of genero&s;ity</HI> in the king.</P>
<P>I gave audience to this word with all my exter|nal and internal powers; and as I found the words, I eat them; for they were as cold water to a thir&s;ty &s;oul: but when I heard mention made of the go|vernor, I made a pau&s;e, and a&s;ked him, if there was any intimacy between the governor and the king his ma&s;ter?</P>
<P>He told me, there was an inviolable friend&s;hip between them ina&s;much as that the one never did any thing in oppo&s;ition to the other. But the king ratified all the acts of the governor, and the go|vernor approved all the edicts of the king.</P>
<P>I replied, how then can the king &s;et any one at liberty from his bondage?</P>
<P>The herald an&s;wered tho' the king is an invin|cible warrior again&s;t his enemies, he never u&s;es ho&s;tilities again&s;t the governor of this country; but all things are done by means &s;o amicable, as to i&s;&s;ue in their mutual honour and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I then enquired whether the king had &s;o much influence, or intere&s;t in the governor, to bring his inexorable di&s;po&s;ition to become flexible? or had the governor a right to re&s;ign his commi&s;&s;ion into his maje&s;ty's hand during his &s;tay.</P>
<P>He replied, that the governor's authority was <HI>perpetual;</HI> nor would the king ever offer him &s;uch an indignity as to recall his commi&s;&s;ion for a <HI>mo|ment;</HI> neither would he ever attempt to obtain the lea&s;t mitigation of ju&s;tice from his hand, which would be a di&s;honour to the king him&s;elf, &s;ince all the rules and decrees of the governor are according to the king's own heart; and what&s;oever is done by either of them, is for the reciprocal honour of them both.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him, how this could be, and yet that
<PB N="20" REF="009151_0021_10310C4529DE1420">
the king &s;hould deliver a condemned wretch out of &s;uch a deplorable condition as mine was?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, by making ample &s;atisfaction to all, and every individual, of the governor's de|mands; &s;o as that the governor him&s;elf &s;hould ac|quit, and honourably di&s;charge, the criminal from all his offences, and fully cancel every indictment exhibited again&s;t him, and at the &s;ame time &s;ecure his own prerogitive, his honour, and his ju&s;tice, <HI>inviolate.</HI></P>
<P>In this declaration I apprehended &s;uch a beauty, that it was like the mo&s;t &s;alutary cordial to me; and I began to enquire when the king would ar|rive?</P>
<P>He an&s;wered, that the preci&s;e time was in his maje&s;ty's own brea&s;t; but that he was well ac|quainted with my condition, and never made any delay in time of nece&s;&s;ity, or ever &s;uffered any one to peri&s;h that waited for his &s;alvation.</P>
<P>I told him my ca&s;e was &s;o de&s;perate, that if I had not &s;peedy relief, I could not live.</P>
<P>He encouraged me not to fear, but wait for the arrival of his maje&s;ty, who perhaps, might be nearer than I conceived; and, probably, I might ob&s;erve &s;omething to my con&s;olation, if I plea&s;ed to take a deliberate view through a per&s;pective, which he pre&s;ented to me.</P>
<P>With eager joy, and inten&s;e application, I en|deavoured to look, according to his direction. I found the tele&s;cope exceeding clear, and curiou&s;ly fixed; and though it was too exten&s;ive for my hand to guide, it was directed to my eye with &s;ur|prizing exactne&s;s, by an invi&s;ible hand, (which af|terwards was matter of much contemplation and admiration, though at the time it almo&s;t e&s;caped my ob&s;ervation through the amazing pro&s;pect which &s;aluted my eyes, and the delightful enter|tainment I found therein;) and, upon a very de|lectable
<PB N="21" REF="009151_0022_10310C4D63652840">
mountain I &s;aw a per&s;on of a mo&s;t &s;plen|ded appearance and exqui&s;ite beauty: &s;uch a &s;ight my eyes never beheld before; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for any to de&s;cribe it, except &s;uch as can &s;peak with <HI>new tongues;</HI> and &s;uch a tran&s;port of joy was rai&s;ed in my &s;oul as I never felt before; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for any to feel the &s;ame, but tho&s;e that have &s;een the &s;ame &s;ight! and &s;uch a flame of love aro&s;e in my brea&s;t towards the per&s;on, as I had never felt; nor can any &s;oul feel the &s;ame love, unle&s;s it be to the &s;ame <HI>object.</HI></P>
<P>When I had beheld this &s;ight, and fea&s;ted my eyes and all my pa&s;&s;ions, with the effulgent glories and ine&s;table beauties of this &s;hining one, and had con&s;idered the amity between the governor and this glorious prince, all my old enmity again&s;t the governor vani&s;hed away: for as the flame of love kindled more and more in my heart towards the king of glory, it al&s;o produced &s;incere regard, and high veneration towards the governor. I thought of him with delight, and fully convinced, that all was equal ju&s;t, and good, that he had done to me; yea, I was &s;atisfied, that if was to die by his hand I mu&s;t ju&s;tify him and love him; for I could not <HI>de&s;ire</HI> to live at the <HI>expence of his glory.</HI></P>
<P>Then I laid before the me&s;&s;enger all my ca&s;e, how I had been embarra&s;&s;ed with that intricate four-fold que&s;tion, and the mi&s;ery which had en|&s;ued; increating the be&s;t advice in my pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tance.</P>
<P>To which he replied, that as to the two la&s;t parts of the problem, none in heaven or earth could touch upon them, &s;ave that king of glory. But re&s;pecting the first parts, the governor had rules to illu&s;trate them, which I might have had opportunity to have &s;een already; though none were able to form &s;uch ju&s;t conceptions of tho&s;e rules, or under&s;tand them in a &s;uch a per&s;picuous
<PB N="22" REF="009151_0023_10310C4F3AAEA8C8">
light, as tho&s;e who had their intellectuals enlarged, through acquaintance with the glorious prince.</P>
<P>I told him I had &s;een tho&s;e rules, and wearied my&s;elf with poring on them, but could make very little of them, only what quite puzzled my under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>He told me, that it was my <HI>enmity to the governor</HI> that prevented &s;ucce&s;s in my &s;earches; but that he could appeal to my&s;elf if I did not find much pride, enmity, murmuring, and reluctance, and that I wanted a good-will in my enquities.</P>
<P>I confe&s;&s;ed, what he &s;aid was true, but that I now found a real <HI>change in my di&s;po&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>He told me, that &s;ince I found my mind well affected to the governor, the &s;tudy of his records would become plea&s;ant; and that while I waited for the king's approach, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for me to inform my&s;elf the be&s;t I could, in tho&s;e things wherein I had opportunity to be in&s;tructed; for the more I was acquainted with tho&s;e two fir&s;t branches, the better I might under&s;tand, and with more plea&s;ure take in, the &s;olution of the other parts, when&s;oever it &s;hould be the king's plea&s;ure to favour me with it.</P>
<P>I was fully per&s;uaded of the &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of this advice, and I &s;et my&s;elf (in earne&s;t) to examine the rules given me by the governor; and when I began to attend to it with affection, approbation, and chearfulne&s;s, I found the paradoxes open, with an <HI>intelligible con&s;istency,</HI> through the whole &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>But when I entered into a clo&s;e peru&s;al of the&s;e records, and began to form ju&s;t conceptions of the things therein contained, to view them in a true light, and deliberate thereon with under&s;tanding; I found it not only the deepe&s;t &s;tudy, but attended with the mo&s;t <HI>awful con&s;iderations,</HI> that ever my thoughts had been employed in. All the angui&s;h and terror which had di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me heretofore, did
<PB N="23" REF="009151_0024_10310C50CAA94B38">
&s;carce bear any compari&s;on with the tremendous a&s;pect now before me; the hideou&s;ne&s;s of the mon|&s;ter! the deva&s;tation made by him! the maje&s;ty and ju&s;tice of the governor! and the inexpre&s;&s;ible mi&s;ery of my own condition! appeared &s;o amaz|ing as no heart can conceive, &s;ave tho&s;e who have had a di&s;tinct view of the&s;e things: and had it not been for the comfort I had received from the king's me&s;&s;enger, the light which was opened into my dark &s;ituation, and the pro&s;pect I had of the king's per&s;on, it had been impo&s;&s;ible for me to have &s;urvived, without falling into di&s;traction or de&s;peration.&mdash;And frequently, when my very &s;oul was overwhelmed with deep enquiries and &s;hocking di&s;coveries, I &s;hould be rou&s;ed up by the melodious &s;ound of the trumpet, which would tran&s;port my mind, and relieve my weary &s;pirits: for the herald continued often to pa&s;s that way, with whom I had frequent conferences concerning the king, his per&s;on, grace, glory and expected approach.

the height of my ambition, was to wait on his maje&s;ty all the days of my life; for I thought, if I was at full liberty, and mu&s;t not enjoy the fa|vour to attend on the king, it would be as great a di&s;tre&s;s to me, as any thing I ever underwent, for he had truly conquered my heart with his love; and if I did not enjoy comfort and &s;atisfaction in him, I enjoyed it no where at all: for though my &s;pirits would &s;ometimes grow flat, and exceeding low, thro' drow&s;ine&s;s, wearine&s;s, and di&s;courage|ment; when&s;oever I received any fre&s;h con&s;olation, it was from him alone: and when&s;oever I enjoyed any good degree of vivacity, I &s;till found my mind inten&s;ely fixed upon the glorious prince, waiting for the happy hour of his arrival, to &s;ee his beauty, and enjoy his &s;alvation.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the trumpet &s;ounded exceeding loud and di&s;tinct, as it had been talking to the intellectual powers of my &s;oul; and light &s;hined around me exceeding clear; as it had been the beams of the &s;un in the meredian altitude; my &s;oul became ex|ceeding alert, all my faculties were expanded, and all my pa&s;&s;ions took fire! and I &s;aw the king him|&s;elf approaching the pri&s;on-gate.&mdash;The appearance was &s;uperlatively glorious, that I melted away, and there remained no &s;pirit in me: I was not able to &s;u&s;tain &s;uch a conjunction of joy and glory, and I fell at his feet as dead.

<P>Then the king a&s;ked, what was my reque&s;t?</P>

And, therefore, I earne&s;tly implored his compa&s;&s;ion, in ca&s;e he did not find my condition too hopele&s;s to admit of relief; but, if that &s;hould be the ca&s;e, I was willing to die at his feet.</P>

<P>From this word I took courage, drew near, and took hold of his girdle; and falling down at his feet, be&s;ought him, to get him&s;elf honour in my deliverance.</P>
<P>Then he a&s;ked me, which way I expected to be &s;et at liberty?</P>
<P>I told him, I was very &s;en&s;ible of the ju&s;tice of my confinement, and the direful &s;entence pa&s;t up|on me, and did not de&s;ire liberty upon any other terms, but what might be to the honour of the go|vernor, and of his maje&s;ty; but that I was in|formed by his own me&s;&s;enger, that he undertook to &s;atisfy all the demands of the governor, on be|half of &s;uch helple&s;s wretches as I was.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked, what were tho&s;e demands, which his excellency the governor made upon me?</P>
<P>Upon this, I produced all the accounts which I had gathered from the tables and records laid before me.</P>
<P>Then the king's herald told me, my calcula|tions were very ju&s;t in many particulars, but in many things deficient. That it was well for me to have a competent under&s;tanding in tho&s;e things, that I might know the nece&s;&s;ity, the nature, and the greatne&s;s of the king'&s;alvation; but, that it was not &s;ufficient, that his maje&s;ty &s;hould an&s;wer the que&s;tion according to my accompts; but ac|cording to the governor's perfect de&s;cription, which was already compleatly done betwixt the king and the governor, and therefore the king had a right to demand my liberty when he plea&s;ed. And that as I had been embarra&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e hard que&s;tions, and had borne the di&s;tre&s;s of &s;eeing my own cala|mity; it was his maje&s;ty's will, that I &s;hould enjoy the plea&s;ure of beholding the whole tran&s;action, wherein all things had been adju&s;ted between the

king and the governor; and that I might peru&s;e all his maje&s;ty's &s;olutions to my full contentment, and ample &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I heard the&s;e words with earne&s;t attention, and drank them in with eagerne&s;s; and being &s;trength|ened by what the king's &s;ecretary had done to me, I was able to under&s;tand in a di&s;tinct light, and ruminate upon what was &s;poken with &s;uch &s;ere|nity of mind, as I never felt before; and it was attended with &s;uch attactive power, as if my very &s;oul had gone out of my&s;elf, into the bo&s;om of the king; or, as if I had cea&s;ed to be, and I had found my&s;elf become a member of his body; or, as if my life had expired, and I had been in&s;pired with new life from his breath. Therefore, I fur|ther enquired, if there were any hopes that I might enjoy &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing, when &s;et at liberty, as to dwell in his dominion, or become one of his atten|dants; for to be wholly denied in this, I thought would be a grief equal to my pre&s;ent confine|ment.</P>
<P>He told me, all that the king redeemed were his own property, and he would take care to have them duly qualified for, and &s;ecurely fixed in the &s;tation for which he de&s;igned them; which was to attend his per&s;on and continue his dome&s;ticks for ever.</P>
<P>This declaration was adequate to my ultimate wi&s;hes and &s;pread tranquility thro' my faculties; and I found my &s;oul filled with such compo&s;ure, &s;atisfaction, and delight in the king, as if every thing in the univer&s;e had been dead but him&s;elf; or as if every excellency in the creation had di&s;ap|peared, and all their glories centered in him alone. Then I had &s;uch a view of the beauties, and per|fections of his maje&s;ty, as my eyes had never &s;een; for tho' the former di&s;coveries were tran&s;cendently &s;triking and glorious, &s;o as to rai&s;e the highe&s;t rap|tures

in my &s;oul, yet I was too weak to view his glory in a di&s;tinct light; but now I had &s;trength to make deliberate ob&s;ervations, and form ju&s;t con|ceptions of what my eyes beheld; but the perfec|tion of his per&s;on, the light of his countenance, the lu&s;tre of his garments, the &s;plendor of his throne, the glory of his crown, the rectitude of his &s;ceptre, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were &s;uch, as nothing but the new &s;trength I had received could have enabled me to behold; nor &s;hall I ever be able fully to de|&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>After my eyes were fea&s;ted, and my &s;oul &s;a|tiated with this incomparable vi&s;ion, the king took a key in his hand, which the herald very amply de&s;cribed to me; and the &s;ecretary directed my eyes to behold the curious make of it, that I might under&s;tand the form and powers thereof. And with this key he opened every lock belonging to the pri&s;on, and to my chains; and did it in &s;uch an open, deliberate manner, as gave me opportu|nity to ob&s;erve by what power he removed every bar, di&s;engaged every ward, and turned every &s;pring. Thus I was brought out of pri&s;on, &s;et at full liberty, and found my&s;elf made free indeed.

He asked again, if he had any more vengeance, or any thing to lay to the charge of tho&s;e per&s;ons who&s;e cau&s;e the king had e&s;pou&s;ed; and the governor answered, no.

anointed my eyes to make my &s;ight clear and &s;trong; and directed me to behold &s;uch a variety of &s;plendid objects, in &s;uch harmonious contexture, and exqui&s;ite order; all &s;hining in the radiancy of the &s;upreme <HI>origin of glory;</HI> until my &s;oul was &s;o expanded, that I &s;carcely knew whether I was on earth, or in heaven.</P>
<P>But when my &s;oul was largely &s;atiated with the&s;e extatic delights, and my mind returned to a &s;ettled compo&s;ure, I &s;till found ince&s;&s;ant de&s;ires to hear the king's &s;olution to the governor's propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Then the king's herald &s;ounded his trumpet &s;o loud, that it echoed through all the cele&s;tial orbs: the mountains trembled and melted away; the val|lies aro&s;e, and were exalted; &s;prings dried up, and dry land flowed with waters; fruitful ground wi|thered, and barren de&s;arts appeared in bloom; the &s;ea dried up, and the heavens opened; all the glory of man totally &s;ub&s;ided; and there was profound &s;ilence.</P>
<P>And he proclaimed the glory of the king's ma|je&s;ty, the rectitude of his kingdom, his ample per|fections, and his immen&s;e riches; whereby he is &s;ufficient to &s;ubdue every enemy, to compleat every work he plea&s;es to undertake, to ble&s;s all his &s;ubjects with every enjoyment which their hearts can de&s;ire, and to maintain their happy &s;tate for ever.</P>
<P>Then he di&s;tinctly an&s;wered to all the particulars, which were contained in the governor's que&s;tion. He fully demon&s;trated the qualifications of his ma|je&s;ty to be far &s;uperior to all the formidable ap|pearances of the hideous mon&s;ter; &s;ufficient to de|&s;troy his reign, and extirpate his being; and al&s;o to make ample reparation of all the damage done by him; &s;o as that the governor &s;hould neither &s;uf|fer lo&s;s or di&s;honour, nor his &s;ubjects &s;uffer di&s;tre&s;s or di&s;grace, no more than if the mon&s;ter had <HI>never been born.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="009151_0040_10310C85172C05A8">But in the opening of the&s;e things, there was &s;uch a di&s;play of wi&s;dom, love, and power; &s;uch excellency, glory, and maje&s;ty; that it frequently exhilarated my &s;oul into rapturous agitation; but the &s;ecretary &s;tayed my pa&s;&s;ions, and would not &s;uffer me to give way to too much extacy, becau&s;e the importance, and &s;ublimity of the &s;ubject, re|quired the mo&s;t <HI>fixed attention.</HI> So I was favoured with a full, di&s;tinct, and accurate manife&s;tation, of that which had filled my mind with &s;o much anxiety; and which I had &s;o long, and &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired to &s;ee.

<P>Now when the herald had &s;poken every particu|lar paragraph, relating to the excellencies, or won|derful performances of the king; his &s;ecretary at|te&s;ted the truth thereof; in&s;cribed it upon <HI>living tables,</HI> and &s;ealed it with the king's <HI>immutable &s;ig|net.</HI> And when he had made an end, his maje&s;ty &s;tood up, and made proclamation, that if any per|&s;on in heaven, or in earth, or under the earth, would contend with him, undertake to accu&s;e him in any thing, or found any thing to object again&s;t his proceedings in any punctilio; <HI>let him draw near.</HI>&mdash;But no an&s;wer was made.

&s;houted; and the morning &s;tars &s;ang together; the light of the moon became as the light of the &s;un; and the light of the &s;un was &s;even-fold, as the light of &s;even days; and rays of &s;tupendous glory &s;hined through the whole creation.&mdash;Now my &s;oul was ab&s;orbed with wonder; lo&s;t in admiration; I was obliged to give way to the overcoming rap|ture, and indulge my ex&s;tatick pa&s;&s;ions; for I could not refrain from &s;ongs of gladne&s;s, &s;houts of joy, and all the demon&s;trations of delight, that my &s;oul was able to expre&s;s. And &s;till, when&s;o|ever I recollect the magnificence of this triumph, I cannot refrain being tran&s;ported with plea&s;ure, and crying out with un&s;peakable joy; HOW GLO|RIOUS LOOKED THE KING OF ISRAEL THAT DAY!</P>
<P>Then the king called me unto him, and told me, he accepted me as his &s;on; that he had pre|pared all things nece&s;&s;ary to give me a princely education; and as &s;oon as I had attained to the due qualifications, he would take me to his royal palace; where I &s;hould abide in his pre&s;ence for ever; and enjoy all the delights that my heart could de&s;ire. And in the mean time, I &s;hould have free acce&s;s to him, in every thing that might be needful to call upon him for.&mdash;The king's &s;ecre|tary told me, he would always continue pre&s;ent with me, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, in&s;truct, and comfort me; to introduce me into the king's pre&s;ence, and com|municate to me his bounties; and to improve me in every thing that might be conducive to my feli|city.&mdash;The king's herald a&s;&s;ured me, he would be ready at all &s;ea&s;ons, to inform me in all matters that could be nece&s;&s;ary for my in&s;truction relating to the king, his excellencies, his riches, his go|vernment, the orders of his hou&s;e, my relation to him, and intere&s;t in him.&mdash;Al&s;o the governor told me, he &s;hould no more exerci&s;e juri&s;diction over
<PB N="41" REF="009151_0042_10310C8D1E614478">
me; but, as it would be for my benefit to receive his in&s;tructions, he would always attend me in quality of a coun&s;ellor; and I &s;hould always find an equal plea&s;ure and profit in all his admonitions.&mdash;Al&s;o the governor's &s;ecretary told me, he &s;hould no more act toward me in the &s;ame character as he did before; &s;ince I now belonged to another prince; but &s;eeing I &s;till might be liable to many inconve|niences, through my own in&s;tability, or want of pre&s;ence of mind; to prevent which, his a&s;&s;i&s;tance might be very u&s;eful; he &s;hould continue my con|&s;tant companion, under the king's direction, in the capacity of a monitor.&mdash;Then all the king's guards, and nobles of the court, &s;aluted me in the quality of a prince. And the herald further in|formed me, that I was to remain at his maje&s;ty's country-&s;eat, (with others of the king's children) where I &s;hould enjoy all accommodations fit for a prince; and might expect frequent vi&s;its from his maje&s;ty; having princes for my companions, and the royal guards for my attendants; till the king &s;hould come, and carry me in triumph, and &s;tate, to his royal city.</P>
<P>Then the king wrote me a di&s;charge from all offences, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come; with an ac|quittance from all &s;ervitude, or allegiance, to any lord, or governor, but him&s;elf: he al&s;o be&s;towed on me an in&s;trument of adoption; whereby he ac|knowledged, and declared me to be his own &s;on, and to have a right to all the enjoyments in his kingdom. And al&s;o promi&s;ed me every nece&s;&s;ary accommodation, during my &s;tay at his lower hou&s;e; and that he would be expeditious in returning to fetch me to him&s;elf, in his &s;erene palace.&mdash;The&s;e things he &s;igned, &s;ealed, and delivered to me, in the pre&s;ence of three faithful witne&s;&s;es; a&s;&s;uring me they were enrolled in the council-chamber, by three infallible recorders.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="009151_0043_10310C8EA9983D38">And when his maje&s;ty had regularly &s;tationed me in his inferior palace, and given proper directions for my education, and noble accompli&s;hment; he mounted his triumphal chariot, and ha&s;ted with all his train, to the imperial city; where he was re|ceived with all the demon&s;trations of joy, and tri|umph; and where he reigns &s;upreme <HI>King of kings, and Lord of lords;</HI> to whom every creature yields &s;ubjection, every knee bows, and every tongue a&s;cribes prai&s;e and glory.</P>
<P>I find this country-palace is the king's acade|my; where the royal &s;ciences are taught; which are not to be learned in any &s;chool in the univer&s;e be&s;ide; nor can be taught by any but the king's in&s;tructors; who are his herald, and his &s;ecretary. For notwith&s;tanding the governor and his &s;ecretary remain with us, and are of &s;pecial u&s;e among us, in their own province (being well &s;killed in other &s;ciences) they are entire &s;trangers to the &s;ciences peculiar to the palace. Nor can any man learn, or is it po&s;&s;ible for them to be taught the&s;e things, &s;o long as they dwell in any part of univer&s;e, &s;ave in the king's own country. All other climates are incompatible with the&s;e &s;ciences; the air they breathe in, and the food they live upon, render them incapable of receiving the in&s;tructions; yea, the very nature, and complexion of the inhabitants of all other realms, are foreign, and indocible to any of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>The &s;ciences taught in this &s;chool, and learned by all the royal princes, are chiefly four, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The nature, exten&s;ivene&s;s, and perfection of his maje&s;ty's an&s;wers, to the governor's problems; for though we had heard them publi&s;hed, we were far from apprehending them in their fulle&s;t ex|tent; they being of &s;o &s;ublime a nature, as require the clo&s;e&s;t application, and deepe&s;t penetration, to conceive of them in a <HI>di&s;tinct light.</HI> The&s;e are
<PB N="43" REF="009151_0044_10310C91DBE73428">
much deeper &s;tudies than the tables of the gover|nor (notwith&s;tanding the intricacy, and amazing depths thereof;) for the perfections, and perfor|mances of the king, do far out-vie all de&s;crip|tions of the mon&s;ter, and the mi&s;chief done by him; and do abound beyond all that ever was re|quired, or mentioned by the governor: and not|with&s;tanding we have opportunity to peru&s;e all the herald's curious de&s;criptions, drawn in the mo&s;t lively figures, and apt repre&s;entations, as well as hearing his excellent lectures, upon the great qua|lities, undertakings, performances, and victories, of his maje&s;ty; they &s;o far tran&s;cend any thing that ever was pre&s;ented to our eyes, or ears, or that ever our minds were exerci&s;ed in before; that our capacities could never conceive of the dephs thereof, were it not that the king's &s;ecretary opens, interprets, and guides our under&s;tandings into the&s;e my&s;teries. He not only leads to the true chain, di|recting us to compare one thing with another, &s;o as to &s;ee the con&s;i&s;tency, and perfection of the whole &s;y&s;tem; but al&s;o anoints our eyes and ears, with an <HI>unction peculiar to his excellency;</HI> and refre&s;hes us with vivifying cordials, to keep our minds, and &s;en&s;es alert. Thus the &s;tudy becomes delightful; both as it is mo&s;t excellent in its own nature, and as our|&s;elves are &s;o much intere&s;ted therein: and we make a comfortable proficiency; notwith&s;tanding the knowledge is unattainable by any creature that is not in&s;tructed the &s;ame way.</P>
<P N="2">2. To under&s;tand the foundation, con&s;titution, oeconomy, and privileges of the kingdom; the re|lation between the king and his &s;ubjects; the royal grant whereby they hold their title to all the rich ble&s;&s;ings of the kingdom; with the glory and dig|nity wherein they &s;tand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is &s;tudy more &s;ublime than the former. But as it bears &s;ome re|lation
<PB N="44" REF="009151_0045_10310C985BDC4360">
to it, it becomes more ea&s;y, when the other is well under&s;tood; e&s;pecially as they both depend upon the perfections of the king. And we have the &s;ame in&s;tructors, and the &s;ame advantages in this, as in the former branch; but the &s;tupendous depths, and glories, that do herein appear, are &s;uf|ficient to a&s;toni&s;h the mo&s;t enlarged and mo&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed mind; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for any one to form ju&s;t conceptions thereof, without &s;uch <HI>preparations</HI> as we are favoured with, through the bounty of the &s;ecretary, our grand tutor.</P>
<P N="3">3. To learn the court-language. As this is the mo&s;t elegant of all languages, &s;o the &s;tudy of it is mo&s;t excellent and curious. It is a language which no per&s;on was ever able to learn, who lived under the governor's juri&s;diction, or in any other realm, but in the king's proper dominions only; con&s;e|quently, this language never could be carried into any foreign country. It has no affinity with any other language in the univer&s;e; nor is it (like all other languages) &s;ubject to any mutations; but continues one pure language through all ages. The grounds of it are amply laid down by the king's herald, with all nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions therein; but the <HI>pronunciation</HI> can never be attained but by the mo&s;t refined and immediate crudition received from the king's &s;ecretary, in which he is always ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t us.</P>
<P N="4">4. To learn the behaviour of the court. This &s;cience (like the re&s;t) is what none can learn in any other &s;chool. The herald lays down proper direc|tions for this branch of learning; but the &s;ecretary alone can in&s;pire us with the <HI>princely mein,</HI> to adorn our behaviour with a becoming grace.&mdash;Some per|&s;ons confound the demeanour of the king's court, with that of the governor's court; but it is a gro&s;s mi&s;take: for, though all the excellency of the go|vernor's court is common to the king's court, there
<PB N="45" REF="009151_0046_10310C99E2D64238">
is a peculiarity attending the palace, both in lan|guage and mein, which none of the proper &s;ubjects of the governor were ever able to learn: for, when his court was in its utmo&s;t &s;plendor, the&s;e peculiar excellencies were utterly unknown in his dominion; and, &s;ince the glory of his court was ruined, by the inroads of the mon&s;ter, he has not a loyal &s;ubject in the univer&s;e, properly belonging to him&s;elf. For tho&s;e that are in league with the mon&s;ter, are rebel|lious &s;ubjects, whatever pretences they make of loyalty: and tho&s;e that have been brought back to give due honour to his excellency the governor, (as it was not his, but the king's power and good|ne&s;s, whereby they were reclaimed) they are not properly his, but the king's &s;ubjects. And though many of tho&s;e pretendedly loyal, but really rebelli|ous &s;ubjects of the governor (confounding the two courts, one with the other, through there being real &s;trangers to both) have imagined, they had attained to the accompli&s;hments of the palace; and could mimick the king's &s;ubjects, &s;o far as to impo&s;e up|on the ignorant; yet, in reality, they were as far from attaining to the truth thereof, as parrots, monkeys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are from attaining to the proper actions of men.&mdash;But the king's &s;ons (and they only) being endowed with privileges peculiar to them&s;elves, are capable of learning the royal &s;ciences, which are peculiar to their dignity. For, the air they breathe in; the waters they drink, and bathe in; the food they live upon; the clothing they wear; the clear and large pro&s;pects they view; the ground they walk upon; with the &s;ociety they con|ver&s;e with, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;o many preparatives to qualify them for receiving tho&s;e &s;ublime in&s;tructions. And thus they become proficients to tho&s;e profound &s;ciences, which remain impenetrable &s;ecrets to the mo&s;t learned, wi&s;e, and ingenious of all other na|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="009151_0047_10310C9B77402658">But we differ much from &s;ome celebrated bands, who have been much gazed at by the world, and much valued by them&s;elves, on account of their keeping &s;ome branches of knowledge &s;ecret from the vulgar; for we never u&s;e art to conceal our learning and knowledge, nor amu&s;e per&s;ons by eva|&s;ions; but, in a &s;incere open manner, are ready to give an an&s;wer to any one that a&s;keth us a rea&s;on, of any thing that we profe&s;s; yea, we are glad to inform any per&s;on as far as we can; and rejoice to find any de&s;irous or capable of receiving in&s;truction. Therefore, it is not want to public &s;pirit, in them that are initiated into the&s;e my&s;teries, that they are kept &s;ecret from all other people; (for all the grounds, and rules, belonging to each of the&s;e &s;ciences, are made public, to be &s;een by all) but it is owing to the rudene&s;s of their capacities, the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their ta&s;te, and indociblene&s;s of their natures, that things &s;o refined are too &s;ublime for their conceptions. And all the nations upon earth are &s;trangers to the king's &s;ecretary; (who alone can in&s;pire per&s;ons with an apt genius for learning the royal &s;ciences) except tho&s;e in his maje&s;ty's own realm. Some are in&s;en&s;ible, and unconcerned; &s;ome de&s;pi&s;e and contemn him; and others give him nominal honours, but e&s;teem him as a being meerly <HI>ideal.</HI> And while it is thus with them, they mu&s;t remain &s;trangers to the excellencies of the kingdom; for the knowledge thereof, is, to them, impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>In this college we remain &s;tudents, and become true mathematicians; our &s;tudies being all upon &s;ub&s;tantial things, and all our &s;olutions grounded upon facts. We practi&s;e no chimera nor exerci&s;e our&s;elves in empty flights of fancy, only tho&s;e things which are u&s;eful and durable, and admit of ju&s;t demon&s;tration, are objects of our re-&s;earches. Our pur&s;uits are not follies of &s;peculation, but true

wi&s;dom and reality; &s;o that however u&s;eful other &s;ciences, and the in&s;tructions given in other &s;chools, may be, in their proper place; there is not any learning in the world that is worthy to be e&s;teemed any more than chaff or dung, when compared with the profound wi&s;dom, taught by the great <HI>ma&s;ter of our a&s;&s;embly</HI>&mdash;And we pur&s;ue the &s;tudy of the&s;e things with great delight, not only as they yield us much plea&s;ure and profit, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation; but as they in&s;pire our hearts with future hopes of &s;olid and everla&s;ting felicity. For we are a&s;&s;ured, that when we are arrived to &s;uch a degree of learn|ing, and accompli&s;hed with tho&s;e qualifications, which the king de&s;igns for us, he will come in the glory of his maje&s;ty, and carry us home in triumph, and make us fellows of the royal &s;ociety, at his imperial court, where we &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed with the knowledge of &s;uch my&s;teries, as never yet <HI>entered into the heart of man.</HI></P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> They are called a <HI>multitude.</HI>&mdash;But to form a judgment of their number, we mu&s;t con&s;ider their <HI>modifications</HI> and <HI>operations.</HI> The former appears in the numbers of &s;inful actions; which actions are multiplied by the number of &s;inful words attending every action; which words are again multiplied by the number of &s;inful thoughts from whence tho&s;e words proceed; which thoughts are al&s;o multiplied by the number of &s;inful principles, from whence they are produced.

For &s;in cau&s;es a di&s;regard of all the rich di&s;coveries which God gives of him&s;elf; an abu&s;e of the multitude of his mercies; a breach of all his commandments; a de&s;pi&s;ing of all his coun&s;els; a mi&s;improvement of all gracious opportunities; and a corruption of all the powers of nature, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus, the numbers of &s;ins are encrea&s;ed, by the multiplication of all the&s;e, one into another.

<P><HI>A.</HI> It is &s;aid of &s;in, that is reaches to <HI>heaven.</HI>&mdash;But to find the true dimen&s;ion of its &s;tature, we mu&s;t en|quire how high it has prevailed: for no effect can be greater than its cau&s;e; and all defection, mi&s;ery, and de&s;truction, are the effects of &s;in; therefore, where&s;oever any of the&s;e effects have prevailed, &s;o high &s;in hath a&s;cended.&mdash;In the creation it has pre|vailed, over the ground, in bringing a cur&s;e; over the mountains, in bringing a deluge; over the vege|tables, in de&s;troying their beauty and virtue; over the animals, in cau&s;ing them pain and &s;orrow; over the clouds, in cau&s;ing re&s;traint; over the &s;un, moon, heavens, and &s;tars, in bringing darkne&s;s upon them; over angels, in ca&s;ting them down to hell; over all the excellencies of human nature, in bringing cor|ruption, mi&s;ery, and death; yea (&s;o far as he is a creature) over the &s;on of God him&s;elf, in &s;ubjecting
<PB N="57" REF="009151_0058_10310CC1332BA3D0">
him to death.&mdash;Al&s;o the height of &s;in appears in its <HI>attempts</HI> and <HI>de&s;igns.</HI> For, whether they be carried into execution, or not, the malignity, the guilt, and ju&s;t de&s;ert of &s;in, are equal to the de&s;ign; and the heinou&s;ne&s;s is aggravated, according to the excellency of the being, again&s;t whom the de&s;ign is formed&mdash;Again&s;t the eternal perfections of God; again&s;t his omni&s;cience; again&s;t his omnipotence; again&s;t his holine&s;s; again&s;t his righteou&s;ne&s;s; again&s;t his good|ne&s;s; again&s;t his faithfulne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;Likewi&s;e the extent of &s;in appears in the depth of the mi&s;ery which en&s;ues; for &s;o low as any creature is ca&s;t down there|by, &s;o deep doth &s;in extend:&mdash;to the lowe&s;t hell, beneath all the rays of light; beneath all comfort; beneath all mercy; beneath all hope, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As to the breadth of &s;in; it is as the <HI>thick cloud.</HI>&mdash;But the extent is be&s;t under&s;tood, by the di&s;tance it &s;eparates one being from another, where&s;oever it comes between. It &s;eparates creatures from God; it has fixed &s;uch ignorance, alienation, and enmity in all mankind, that they can neither know, de&s;ire, nor &s;eek after God: it has filled the con&s;ciences of men with guilt, &s;o that they cannot enjoy peace with God, nor have courage to approach his pre&s;ence; but find them&s;elves held in exile, by an unpa&s;&s;able gulph.&mdash;It &s;eparates man from his original purity: he was made upright, in the image of God, but by &s;in is be|come altogether vanity; made very good, but by &s;in degenerated, to be only evil. The heart is become as adamant; and the whole con&s;titution of nature is corrupted. Thus, &s;o far as the ea&s;t is from the we&s;t, &s;in hath &s;eparate man from God; and, &s;o far as the &s;outh is from the north, &s;in hath &s;eparated man from his original purity.&mdash;Sin is not infinite in his exi&s;tence, for it re&s;ides in finite beings; nor in its prevalency, for God re&s;trains it. But as it is again&s;t the infinite perfections of God, as it tends to an infinite &s;epara|tion
<PB N="58" REF="009151_0059_10310CC2FA493038">
from God, and &s;o to the creature's infinite lo&s;s and mi&s;ery; it contains infinite hatefulne&s;s, and de|&s;erves infinite puni&s;hment.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>What is the weight of &s;in?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This appears in its <HI>in&s;upportablene&s;s.</HI>&mdash;The earth is not able to bear it; the pillars of heaven tremble, and cannot &s;u&s;tain it; the angels that &s;inned, are eternally &s;unk under it; the corporeal con&s;titu|tion of man cannot &s;u&s;tain, but is con&s;umed and cru&s;hed to du&s;t by it; the &s;oul of man is not able to &s;upport it&s;elf under &s;in, but is utterly overwhelmed; the human nature of Chri&s;t was not able to &s;u&s;tain the load of &s;in, but alone through the power of the God-head.</P>
<P>Again, it appears in its <HI>unmoveablene&s;s.</HI>&mdash;The law being the &s;trength of &s;in, it is ea&s;ier to remove heaven and earth: all the improvements that can po&s;&s;ibly be made of earthly riches are of no avail; no legal &s;a|crifices can take away &s;in; all moral obedience can|not ju&s;tify a &s;oul from it; no prayers, or religious performances, can procure remi&s;&s;ion of it; the great|e&s;t abundance of oblations, or event the fruit of a man's body, cannot atone for the &s;in of his &s;oul: therefore, it is heavier than the whole creation, &s;ince all the creation &s;hall be cru&s;hed to pieces by it. <HI>Je|&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> &s;u&s;tains the whole creation by his word; but could not remove &s;in, without pouring out his &s;oul unto death.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>What is, and wherein lies, the &s;trength of &s;in?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This may be under&s;tood by its number, weight and mea&s;ure: <HI>for, as the man is, &s;o is his &s;trength.</HI>&mdash;But, in particular, its power appears in its <HI>opera|tions.</HI>&mdash;Every creature that enters the paths of &s;in, is made captive thereby, and held in perpetual bondage. Nor was it ever known that any created being (when once en&s;nared) was able (in the lea&s;t degree) to ex|tricate

him&s;elf out of the chains of &s;in. They may &s;hift hands, and by changing the forms of &s;in, may impo&s;e upon them&s;elves, to fancy they obtain liberty; but they that think them&s;elves mo&s;t at liberty, are frequently mo&s;t in bondage. Likewi&s;e, &s;in hath power to fill the &s;oul with di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h; to kill and de&s;troy all its hope and comfort; to bring natural death upon all mankind univer&s;ally; and to torment both &s;oul and body in hell, to all <HI>eternity.</HI></P>
<P>And the &s;trength of &s;in centers in carnality of mind; whereby all the powers are held in bondage: in guilt and horror of con&s;cience, whereby the &s;oul is filled with angui&s;h and di&s;tre&s;s; and in alienation from God, whereby all ble&s;&s;ings are abdicated, life, and all en|joyments forfeited, and death and mi&s;ery become in|evitable.&mdash;Al&s;o the damnatory power of &s;in, is the <HI>law.</HI> And the power of damnation, or mi&s;ery of the damned, lies in a re&s;tle&s;s de&s;ire after &s;elf-&s;uffi|ciency, or &s;eeking &s;atisfaction in &s;omething that is not God; which is that gnawing worm that never dies.&mdash;In enmity again&s;t God; which is an un|quenchable fire in the &s;oul. And in rebellion again&s;t God; which provokes the burning wrath of God; and brings it down upon the &s;oul, unquenchable and eternal. Therefore, &s;in is <HI>invincible</HI> in its power, to every created being.</P>

<HEAD>The &s;econd part if the que&s;tion an&s;wered; or a de&s;cription of the damage done by &s;in.</HEAD>
<P>In order to a di&s;covery of the damage done, it is nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand, who are the <HI>&s;ufferers,</HI> and wherein they have <HI>&s;uffered</HI> by &s;in. The &s;ufferers are, <HI>the holy law of God,</HI> and <HI>the creature, man.</HI> And the things wherein they have &s;uffered, will ap|pear by comparing their <HI>original &s;tation,</HI> with their pre&s;ent <HI>po&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the law of God, it is undeniably ma|nife&s;t, that the whole world is under it; and every &s;on and daughter of <HI>Adam,</HI> is indi&s;pen&s;ably bound to live in &s;ubjection, and perpetual conformity to it. And that the law is ab&s;olutely inviolable, appears from a two fold con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The natural and nece&s;&s;ary obligation, which all creatures are under to God, as their creator, &s;u&s;tainer, and benefactor. This is founded in the na|ture and fitne&s;s of things. For as we have received our being, and every degree of well-being, from him alone; we are under a natural, and indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation, in point of gratitude, to live to his glory, and to devote all the powers of &s;oul and body, to the will of him, in whom we live, move, and exi&s;t. All ju&s;t laws are originally founded upon <HI>natural obliga|tions;</HI> and all rea&s;onable obedience to &s;uperiors, is no other than <HI>&s;trict gratitude;</HI> which becomes their proper due, in con&s;equence of favour received from them. This is the true ground of the moral law, and &s;o long as God is God, and creatures continue
<PB N="65" REF="009151_0066_10310CDD0A2D6090">
to be intelligent beings, the obligation can <HI>never cea&s;e;</HI> nor is it po&s;&s;ible for any circum&s;tance to make it <HI>void.</HI>&mdash;The angels of glory are debtors to JEHOVAH, for all their excellencies; con&s;equently they are bound in duty to &s;hew forth his prai&s;e. The devil is a creature, and every creature of God is <HI>good;</HI> there|fore (notwith&s;tanding the evil he has contracted) &s;o long as he has a being, he enjoys &s;ome good from God; and con&s;equently continues under an obligation, or law of gratitude. <HI>The devil &s;inneth from the be|ginning;</HI> but if he were not under a law, he could not &s;in; for, <HI>Where there is no law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;Likewi&s;e, among the &s;ons of men, eve|ry creature is under obligations to God, according to the favours he enjoys: the greater the favours, the greater the obligations. So that &s;aints in glory will eternally remain under the highe&s;t obligations of <HI>gratitude;</HI> that is, under the law of God, con&s;idered &s;imply as a law, not as a covenant.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The divine authority &s;tamped upon the &s;imple law of nature, gives &s;anction to this obligation. And this authority con&s;i&s;ts in three things:&mdash;1. Doctrine whereby God has revealed to mankind his will, con|cerning the way in which they are to &s;hew their gratitude to him; having taught and in&s;tructed them, how they might obey him in an acceptable manner.&mdash;2. The commandment whereby God requires from the creature that obedience, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and confor|mity to his will, which his goodne&s;s to that creature ju&s;tly de&s;erved; which, therefore, that creature is under a native obligation to perform; and God has a native right to demand.&mdash;3. A covenant, &s;tipulating the conditions of obedience, and di&s;obedience, to the holy precept; with promi&s;es and threatnings, ble&s;|&s;ings and cur&s;es, annexed thereto.</P>
<P>From the&s;e two fountains, the law of God re|ceives &s;overeign power over all creatures. For all
<PB N="66" REF="009151_0067_10310CDEAAB3E668">
that God enjoins, is purely natural; as, <HI>To love God and our neighbour,</HI> is an obligation in&s;eparable from our being, our relation to God, and to our fellow-creatures. And what&s;oever is a concomitant of the natural obligation, is included in the injunction, <HI>With all thy heart,&mdash;&s;oul,&mdash;&s;trength,&mdash;mind,</HI>&mdash;and <HI>as thy&s;elf.</HI> So that a natural obligation, <HI>founded on our very being,</HI> and inforced by the <HI>divine &s;anction,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;uperlatively, univer&s;ally, and eternally binding, to every intelligent being in the creation. Therefore, the authoritative power of the holy law, extends to every creature, in every capacity; whil&s;t innocent, to command, to promi&s;e and to threaten; and when &s;inful, to convince, to condemn, and to cur&s;e; but is not inve&s;ted with any influential power, either to prevent, or remove &s;in. Notwith|&s;tanding, the law is not deficient in all &s;ua&s;ive means, warnings, in&s;tructions, admonitions, reproofs, threat|enings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But ina&s;much as its power is only <HI>mandatory,</HI> not <HI>physical; judicial</HI> not <HI>operative;</HI> all its mea&s;ures to prevent the evil, to heal the plague, or repair the damage, have proved abortive. There|fore, the law has no other way to do it&s;elf ju&s;tice, or vindicate its honour, but by the de&s;truction of the &s;in|ner; for it cannot po&s;&s;ibly recover what it has lo&s;t by &s;in. Which is,</P>
<P N="1">1. All mankind have revolted from under the ju|ri&s;diction of the holy law, and become the &s;ervants of &s;in; and hereby the law is &s;poiled in its dominion; its authority is wrongfully taken away; its govern|ment wre&s;ted from it; and it is deprived of its right and property in its <HI>&s;ubjects.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Perfect and perpetual obedience is due to God's law; but all the children of <HI>Adam,</HI> are become <HI>children of di&s;obedience:</HI> being the &s;ervants of &s;in, and yielding obedience thereto, whereby the law of God is injuriou&s;ly deprived of all its ju&s;t <HI>revenue.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2.

<P N="4">4. Man was perfectly free from evil: but, by &s;in, he is &s;ubjected to all manner of evil.

<P N="7">7. Man in his primitive &s;tate, had frequent vi&s;its from God, and enjoyed communion with his <HI>Maker.</HI> But, thro' &s;in, he was bani&s;hed from God's pre&s;ence,

<P>His pre&s;ence is univer&s;ally manife&s;t, by his &s;u&s;tain|ing power, in every creature, time, and place: in heaven; where &s;in is not, he appears in his glory; in earth, where &s;in is permitted, &s;o far as he plea&s;es, and re&s;trained when he plea&s;es, he appears in his goodne&s;s; in hell, where &s;in rages without controul, he appears in his terror.

<P>By his quick and powerful word he vanqui&s;hes all enemies; and, by the &s;ame word, he will judge all creatures, and con&s;ume all that dare rebel again&s;t him. This word endureth for ever; and no adver&s;e power can de&s;troy or wear it out; nor is any creature able to with&s;tand it: for, by this <HI>&s;word of the Spirit,</HI> Chri&s;t breaks through all the oppo&s;ition, and de&s;troys all the power of &s;in; drives it out of its clo&s;e quar|ters, and delivers his children from its tyranny. And the &s;ame word, being full of grace, is a pre&s;ervative from all the attacks of horror and de&s;pair; and a de|fence again&s;t all the fiery darts of &s;atan.</P>
<P>The way of Chri&s;t's making war, is in <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgment.</HI>&mdash;And herein his prowe&s;s, con|duct, and dexterity; for when he comes to re&s;cue his people, he finds them coupled with &s;in, cemented as clo&s;ed as the fle&s;h and bone, joints and marrow, or &s;oul and &s;pirit; yet, he manages his weapons with

<P>And now he proclaims liberty to the captives, free|dom to the pri&s;oners, and deliverance to them that are bound.

And henceforth all his children wear this motto, <HI>More than conquerors, through him that loved us.</HI></P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> In his divine nature he is <HI>ab&s;olutely eternal;</HI> for <HI>the Father, the Word, and the Holy Gho&s;t&mdash;are one.

<P>And in his human nature he is <HI>the fir&s;t-born of every creature, &s;et up from everla&s;ting, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of God in the beginning of his way; the beginning of the creation of God.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e things cannot be &s;poken of his divine nature; who&s;e e&s;&s;ential perfection ad|mits of no advancement or progre&s;&s;ion; nor can be <HI>&s;et up,</HI> or <HI>born.</HI> Neither of the open, and actual exi&s;tence of his human nature; which, &s;o con&s;idered, is really a work of God; whereas Jehovah po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him <HI>before his works of old.</HI> But the my&s;tery of his will, the fellow&s;hip between the divine and human natures, or the dignity of his human nature, in union with the divine, are here intended.

<PB N="82" REF="009151_0083_10310D1292F31300">
he was beheld in the perfect view of his Father, as his everla&s;ting delight; being the very original in Jeho|vah's grand de&s;ign, and the foundation of all his works; who&s;e purpo&s;es being unchangeable, and his decrees unfru&s;trable; he beholds all things imme|diately pre&s;ent with him&s;elf; therefore, in the infi|nite perfection of the divine mind, Chri&s;t &s;tood, prior to all &s;in and mi&s;ery.&mdash;From which unconceivable period or rather eternal duration, he was (in the &s;ame my&s;terious de&s;ign) the head of his church; the dwel|ling-place of his people; the inexhau&s;tible trea&s;ury of grace; the vital fountain thro' whom all ble&s;&s;ings flow to God's elect; who, being the image and de|light of the Godhead, is the center of love; through whom the love of God proceeds; and in whom the Father delights in his children: for it is to be ob|&s;erved, that the human nature of the Son of God ne|ver was alone, but always &s;tands in the eternal word; and all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead dwelling in him: neither is his divine nature manife&s;ted to us alone; but all his <HI>goings forth</HI> are in the woman's &s;eed.

<HEAD>The fourth part of the que&s;tion an&s;wered; or the reparation made by Chri&s;t, for the damage done by &s;in.</HEAD>
<P>It appears undeniable, in every de&s;cription given of the mon&s;ter, &s;in, that Chri&s;t is &s;uperior to it; and, con&s;equently, he mu&s;t be able to de&s;troy it. And as he is the author and maintainer of the holy law (of which &s;in is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion) he is &s;ufficient to re&s;tore the honour of his own law. And as he is not only &s;uperior to &s;in, but to every created being; and the e&s;&s;ence of every creature &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in him&s;elf; he cer|tainly is able to di&s;tingui&s;h, and divide, between the nature, and the putrefaction of the creature. There|fore, he is undeniably &s;ufficient, with re&s;pect to his own perfection, to extingui&s;h all the mi&s;chief done by &s;in. The only remaining enquiry is, <HI>Whether he has done, or certainly undertaken to do it?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Chri&s;t hath done the greate&s;t honour to the ho|ly law, in regard to its authority; in that he, who is the Holy One of God, became &s;ubject to it: he re|cognized the law in all its holy commandments; and he him&s;elf is become guarantee, to &s;ee due honour done to all the precepts of it.&mdash;And he hath engaged to bring to all his people in proper &s;ubjection to it. For, tho' the word &s;ays, to believers, <HI>Ye are not under the law;</HI> the meaning cannot be, <HI>Ye are not under the obligation of it;</HI> but, <HI>Ye are not under it as a legal covenant.</HI> For all the children of God are under the law, as creatures, but not under it, as believers; be|cau&s;e Chri&s;t has made atonement for their &s;in. So
<PB N="84" REF="009151_0085_10310D174C1AE468">
long as they remain creatures of God; they mu&s;t be under his law, con&s;idered <HI>&s;imply as a law</HI> but <HI>not as a broken law,</HI> &s;ince Chri&s;t has fulfilled it for them. They are under the <HI>commandment,</HI> but not under the <HI>cur&s;e;</HI> for Chri&s;t has redeemed them from it. They are under its <HI>direction,</HI> but not under a <HI>&s;pirit of bondage;</HI> for Chri&s;t has made them free. So then, it is only tho&s;e concomitants of the law, rela|tive to &s;in, which the &s;aints are not under; nor it is po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be under them, con&s;idered as be|lievers in Je&s;us; for &s;in being taken away by Chri&s;t, there is nothing for the condemnatory part to take place upon. But, what&s;oever is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to the law it&s;elf, the heaven-born &s;oul is under; and it is his delight &s;o to be.</P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t hath rendered ample obedience to the whole law: his whole life was perfectly conformable to every command and precept of it; he al&s;o yield|ed obedience unto death, &s;ubjected him&s;elf to the cur&s;e, and &s;uffered all the penalties that the &s;ins of his people did de&s;erve, or the ju&s;t law did require.&mdash;And he hath likewi&s;e undertaken to bring all his peo|ple to a practical obedience to the holy law.</P>
<P N="3">3. Chri&s;t hath always retained the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law in his heart; his mind did never deviate from it; nor did any pollution ever enter his &s;oul; but his whole nature perpetually remains an unmole&s;ted ha|bitation of God's holy law.&mdash;And he hath engaged to put it in the hearts of his children, and to write it in their minds; and &s;o to impre&s;s it upon their &s;ouls, that it &s;hall abide forever. And it is the experience of God's cho&s;en, that, by his grace, their wills are wrought into a holy conformity to the will of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Chri&s;t hath honoured and magnified the law to the highe&s;t degree that is po&s;&s;ible for its glory to be advance: for, what&s;oever was its proper due, from creatures, has been fully rendered unto it, by him
<PB N="85" REF="009151_0086_10310D1DCC7D8E38">
that made all creatures.&mdash;His nature is a lively re|pre&s;entation of the perfection of its holine&s;s; or ra|ther, the law is a repre&s;entation of the holine&s;s of his nature. His life was one continued cour&s;e of ample conformity to all its requirements; his death was a compleat &s;urrender of him&s;elf to its ju&s;t &s;everity; his exalted &s;tation, before the throne of God, as advocate for his people, is a continued vindication of the ho|nour and glory of the law; ina&s;much as it is his own perfect &s;atisfaction, made to the law, which he there pleads as the ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s of his people. And, when he comes in his glory, at the great day, it will be to di&s;play the en&s;igns of the glory of the righteous law, by which he will judge the world.&mdash;And, in honour of this righteous Governor of the creation, Chri&s;t (by his &s;pecial grace in the hearts of his children) renews and purifies them, and makes them love, de&s;ire, and rejoice in the holy law, with all their &s;ouls; and to delight in the excellencies thereof, more than in any thing they can enjoy, be|hold, or de&s;ire, below the &s;un: and they &s;hall con|tinue to delight therein, for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Thus the honour, glory, and dignity, of this per|fect &s;y&s;tem of rectitude, the divine law, does, and will &s;hine much more con&s;picuous, through Chri&s;t, than if it had never been violated by &s;in.</P>
<P>And concerning the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained, and ruin bro't upon mankind by &s;in,</P>
<P N="1">1. Chri&s;t re&s;tores, to his elect, perfect purity, and uprightne&s;s; and will perform his work in them, un|til he has compleatly made them free from all filthi|ne&s;s, pollution, irregularity, or depravity what&s;oever; and will &s;o perfectly <HI>fini&s;h his work,</HI> that they &s;hall &s;tand compleat in holine&s;s; adequate to the ultimate perfection of the holy law, and <HI>without fault</HI> before God.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="86" REF="009151_0087_10310D1F786C03F8">2. Chri&s;t &s;hall bring all his children to bear his own image; not only his image of moral rectitude, but his image of heavenly glory; and crown them with glory and honour; not only in &s;etting them over the works of his hands, in this lower world, but in making them kings, and prie&s;ts, unto God: and &s;hall make them the mo&s;t excellent of all beings; not only to exceed all things in this world, but &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing all the glory of the angelick ho&s;ts, and all the dignities in the regions of light.&mdash;Thus the &s;aints &s;hall be rai&s;ed to a dignity, far more excellent than what man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>before his fall.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Chri&s;t is &s;et at God's right-hand, &s;upreme Lord and Governor of all things; not only in this world, but in the world to come. And what&s;oever has an exi&s;tence in the creation of God, is made &s;ubject to him. And the glory which Chri&s;t him&s;elf is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, he gives to his church; and they &s;hall reign toge|ther with him. For he makes them victorious over all their enemies; and every thing whereby they have been led captive, &s;hall be led captive by them: through <HI>his Spirit,</HI> they mortify their corrupt pa&s;&s;ions; through <HI>the faith of Je&s;us,</HI> they overcome the world; and, by <HI>the blood of the Lamb,</HI> they vangui&s;h the prince of darkne&s;s. And, when the Captain of &s;al|vation, &s;hall have compleated his conque&s;ts, for them, and in them, they &s;hall &s;it with him, as joint-heirs in his throne, and his crown &s;hall flouri&s;h on their heads for ever.</P>
<P N="4">4. Chri&s;t is the great deliverer, who &s;ets his chil|dren free from every evil, and every plague: for he took upon him&s;elf their &s;ins, and their &s;orrows; and in his own &s;oul, and body, he finally bare them away from all his people. The effect whereof, will i&s;&s;ue in their perfect freedom, from every grief, bondage, or incommodity what&s;oever; and the &s;alvation &s;hall be eternal. Their &s;ouls &s;hall be perfect in light;
<PB N="87" REF="009151_0088_10310D2107904B68">
their bodies &s;hall be incorruptible; and what&s;oever they are, do, or enjoy, &s;hall be <HI>perpetual delight.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Chri&s;t is the alone center, and repo&s;itory of all good, not only natural, but &s;piritual, and eternal; and all the plenitude of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s dwells in him, in the highe&s;t perfection; and through vital union with him, and &s;piritual communications from him, his chil|dren are enriched with more exalted natures, and more enlarged capacities, than what the human nature was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, before the fall. And for their ac|commodation, he will appoint to them a kingdom, replete with all rich ble&s;&s;ings, and abundantly &s;tored with every good thing; which their more elevated natures can po&s;&s;ibly enjoy, or de&s;ire. And the&s;e new enjoyments &s;hall be free from all corruption; and all his &s;aints &s;hall regale them&s;elves therein, to the <HI>days of eternity.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Chri&s;t has already removed &s;in, in its condem|ning power, from all his elect, by the blood of his cro&s;s; and, from all his called he has taken away &s;in, in its reinging power, by regeneration; and, in all the regenerate, he cea&s;es not to pur&s;ue the de&s;truc|tion of &s;in, in its defiling power, by the &s;anctification of the Spirit; and, in all the &s;anctified, he will put a final period to &s;in, in all its appearances and con&s;e|quences, at his &s;econd coming.&mdash;All guilt, fear, and &s;hame, are the effects of &s;in; and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily cea&s;e, when the cau&s;e is taken away: therefore, the di&s;ciples of the Lord have boldne&s;s now, before the throne of grace; they have courage to confe&s;s his name, before all adver&s;aries; and &s;hall boldly &s;tand before God, in the day of judgment: nothing in hea|ven, earth, or hell, can confound their countenances, nor di&s;may their hearts, for <HI>Je&s;us is their confidence.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Chri&s;t is the man of God's right-hand, his fel|low, his delight, his equal, and his coun&s;ellor. He al&s;o is head over all things to this church; the husband,
<PB N="88" REF="009151_0089_103109E9884B8518">
the portion, the life, and glory of his cho&s;en. The union between him and his Father, is &s;o ab&s;olute, and indivi&s;ible, that he mu&s;t inherit all his Father's per|fections and glories; and the relation between him and his people, is &s;o clo&s;e, and in&s;eparable, that they mu&s;t partake of all his fulne&s;s and enjoyments. Therefore, in the Lord Je&s;us, they are made nigh to God; he dwells among them, and they dwell in his pre&s;ence; all di&s;tances are removed; all interpo&s;ing clouds are di&s;per&s;ed; and they enjoy &s;weet commu|nion with JEHOVAH. Yea, he is their God, and their Father; and nothing can be able to &s;eperate them from his love; but they &s;hall dwell in his bo|&s;om for evermore.</P>
<P>Thus, through the infinite fulne&s;s of divine grace, and the mediatorial performances of EMMANUEL, there is a total extirpation of &s;in. Wrath is no more; death is vangui&s;hed; mi&s;ery hath no place; for there is no more cur&s;e.&mdash;The honour of the divine law is amply re&s;tored, and abundantly magnified, and e&s;tablished, in all its rights; with the utmo&s;t excel|lency, glory, dignity, and authority.&mdash;All that believe in Je&s;us, &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s a far richer inheritance, than <HI>Adam</HI> did in Paradi&s;e: their relation to God is more near; their natures more dignified; their faculties more enlarged; their knowledge more exten&s;ive; their view of God's glory more clear; their enjoy|ment of God more abundant; and their &s;tanding more &s;ecure.&mdash;And they &s;hall breathe in the pure air of divine love; regale them&s;elves in the glories of everla&s;ting light; and bathe in the uninterrupted &s;treams of immortality, which proceed <HI>out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb.</HI>&mdash;And &s;ongs of adoration, joy, and triumph, &s;hall &s;ound from all the church, and re&s;ound through all the cele&s;tial domes, to the INFINITIE, ETERNAL, THREE-ONE, <HI>world without end.</HI> Amen.</P>
