<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN fulfilling the engagement which I had come under to the Public, with re&s;pect to the HIS|TORY of AMERICA, it was my intention not to have publi&s;hed any part of the work, until the whole was completed. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Briti&s;h Colonies has induced me to alter that re&s;olution. While they are engaged in civil war with Great Britain, inquiries and &s;pecula|tions concerning their ancient forms of policy and laws, which exi&s;t no longer, cannot be in|tere&s;ting. The attention and expectation of man|kind are now turned towards their future condi|tion. In whatever manner this unhappy conte&s;t may terminate, a new order of things mu&s;t ari&s;e in North America, and its affairs will a&s;&s;ume another a&s;pect. I wait with the &s;olicitude of a good citizen, until the ferment &s;ub&s;ide, and regu|lar government be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and then I &s;hall return to this part of my work, in which I had made &s;ome progre&s;s. That, together with the hi&s;tory of Portugue&s;e America, and of the &s;et|tlements made by the &s;everal nations of Europe in the We&s;t India i&s;lands, will complete my plan.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="034476_0003_0FFDD42E77EF4278">THE three volumes which I now publi&s;h, con|tain an account of the di&s;covery of the New World, and of the progre&s;s of the Spani&s;h arms and colonies there. This is not only the mo&s;t &s;plendid portion of the American &s;tory, but &s;o much detached, as, by it&s;elf, to form a perfect whole, remarkable for the unity of the &s;ubject. As the principles and maxims of the Spaniards in planting colonies, which have been adopted in &s;ome mea&s;ure by every nation, are unfolded in this part of my work; it will &s;erve as a proper introduction to the hi&s;tory of all the European e&s;tabli&s;hments in America, and convey &s;uch information concerning this important article of policy, as may be deemed no le&s;s intere&s;ting than curious.</P>
<P>IN de&s;cribing the atchievements and in&s;titutions of the Spaniards in the New World, I have de|parted in many in&s;tances from the accounts of pre|ceding hi&s;torians, and have often related facts which &s;eem to have been unknown to them. It is a duty I owe the Public, to mention the &s;ources from which I have derived &s;uch intelligence, as ju&s;tifies me either in placing tran&s;actions in a new light, or in forming any new opinion with re&s;pect to their cau&s;es and effects. This duty I perform with greater &s;atisfaction, as it will afford an op|portunity of expre&s;&s;ing my gratitude to tho&s;e be|nefactors, who have honoured me with their coun|tenance and aid in my re&s;earches.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="034476_0004_0FFDD4314906BEC8">AS it was from Spain that I had to expect the mo&s;t important information, with regard to this part of my-work, I con&s;idered it as a very fortu|nate circum&s;tance for me, when Lord Grantham, to whom I had the honour of being per&s;onally known, and with who&s;e liberality of &s;entiment, and di&s;po&s;ition to oblige, I was well acquainted, was appointed amba&s;&s;ador to the court of Madrid. Upon applying to him, I met with &s;uch a recep|tion as &s;atisfied me that his endeavours would be employed in the mo&s;t proper manner, in order to obtain the gratification of my wi&s;hes; and I am perfectly &s;en&s;ible, that what progre&s;s I have made in my inquiries among the Spaniards, ought to be a&s;cribed chiefly to their knowing how much his Lord&s;hip intere&s;ted him&s;elf in my &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT did I owe nothing more to Lord Grantham, than the advantages which I have derived from his attention in engaging Mr. Waddilove, the chaplain of his emba&s;&s;y, to take the conduct of my literary inquiries in Spain, the obligations I lie under to him would be very great. During five years, that gentleman has carried on re&s;earch|es for my behoof, with &s;uch activity, pre&s;eve|rance, and knowledge of the &s;ubject, to which his attention was turned, as have filled me with no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment than &s;atisfaction. He pro|cured for me the greater part of the Spani&s;h books, which I have con&s;ulted; and as many of
<PB REF="034476_0005_0FFDD433DBF086E0">
them were printed early in the &s;ixteenth century, and are become extremely rare, the collecting of the&s;e was &s;uch an occupation, as, alone, requir|ed much time and a&s;&s;iduity. To his friendly at|tention I am indebted for copies of &s;everal valu|able manu&s;cripts, containing facts and details which I might have &s;earched for in vain, in works that have been made public. Encouraged by the inviting good-will with which Mr. Waddilove conferred his favours, I tran&s;mitted to him a &s;et of queries, with re&s;pect both to the cu&s;toms and policy of the native Americans, and the nature of &s;everal in&s;titutions in the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, framed in &s;uch a manner, that a Spaniard might an&s;wer them, without di&s;clo&s;ing any thing that was improper to be communicated to a foreigner. He tran&s;lated the&s;e into Spani&s;h, and obtained from various per&s;ons who have re&s;ided in mo&s;t of the Spani&s;h colonies, &s;uch replies as have afforded me much in&s;truction.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING tho&s;e peculiar advantages with which my inquiries were carried on in Spain, it is with regret I am obliged to add, that their &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the beneficence of in|dividuals, not to any communication by public authority. By a &s;ingle arrangement of Philip II. the records of the Spani&s;h monarchy are depo&s;ited in the <HI>Archivo</HI> of Simancas, near Valladolid, at the di&s;tance of a hundred and twenty miles from the &s;eat of government, and the &s;upreme courts of
<PB N="vii" REF="034476_0006_0FFDD4366E6BE558">
ju&s;tice. The papers relative to America, and chiefly to that early period of its hi&s;tory, towards which my attention was directed, are &s;o numerous, that they alone, according to one account, fill the large&s;t apartment in the Archivo; and according to another, they compo&s;e eight hundred and &s;eventy-three large bundles. Con&s;cious of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing, in &s;ome degree, the indu&s;try which be|longs to an hi&s;torian, the pro&s;pect of &s;uch a trea|&s;ure excited my mo&s;t ardent curio&s;ity. But the pro&s;pect of it, is all that I have enjoyed. Spain, with an exce&s;s of caution, has uniformly thrown a veil over her tran&s;actions in America. From &s;trangers they are concealed with peculiar &s;olici|tude. Even to her own &s;ubjects the Archivo of Simancas is not opened without a particular order from the crown; and after obtaining that, papers cannot be copied, without paying fees of office &s;o exorbitant, that the expence exceeds what it would be proper to be&s;tow, when the gratification of literary curio&s;ity is the only object. It is to be hoped, that the Spaniards will at la&s;t di&s;cover this &s;y&s;tem of concealment to be no le&s;s impolitic than illiberal. From what I have experienced in the cour&s;e of my inquiries, I am &s;atisfied, that upon a more minute &s;crutiny into their early operations in the New World, however reprehen&s;ible the actions of individuals may appear, the conduct of the nation will be placed in a more favourable light.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="034476_0007_0FFDD4390B4FF730">IN other parts of Europe very different &s;enti|ments prevail. Having &s;earched, without &s;ucce&s;s, in Spain, for a letter of Cortes to Charles V. written &s;oon after he landed in the Mexican em|pire, which has not hitherto been publi&s;hed: it occurred to me, that as the Emperor was &s;etting out for Germany at the time when the me&s;&s;engers from Cortes arrived in Europe, the letter with which they were intru&s;ted might po&s;&s;ibly be pre|&s;erved in the Imperial library of Vienna. I com|municated this idea to Sir Robert Murray Keith, with whom I have long had the honour to live in friend&s;hip, and I had &s;oon the plea&s;ure to learn, that upon his application, her Imperial Maje&s;ty had been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue an order, that not only a copy of that letter (if it were found), but of any other papers in the library, which could throw light upon the Hi&s;tory of America, &s;hould be tran&s;mited to me. The letter from Cortes is not in the Imperial library, but an au|thentic copy, atte&s;ted by a notary, of the letter written by the magi&s;trates of the colony planted by him at Vera Cruz, which I have mentioned, Vol. ii. p. 269, having been found, it was tran&s;|cribed and &s;ent to me. As this letter is no le&s;s curious, and as little known as that which was the object of my inquiries, I have given &s;ome ac|count, in its proper place, of what is mo&s;t worthy of notice in it. Together with it, I received a copy of a letter from Cortes, containing a long account of
<PB N="ix" REF="034476_0008_0FFDD43BA1010538">
his expeditions to Honduras, with re&s;pect to which, I did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to enter into any particular detail; and likewi&s;e tho&s;e curious Mexican paintings, which I have de&s;cribed, Vol. ii.</P>
<P>MY inquiries at St. Peter&s;burgh were carried on with equal facility and &s;ucce&s;s. In examining into the neare&s;t communication between our con|tinent and that of America, it became of con&s;e|quence to obtain authentic information concerning the di&s;coveries of the Ru&s;&s;ians in their navigation from Kamchatka towards the coa&s;t of America. Accurate relations of their fir&s;t voyage, in 1741, have been publi&s;hed by Muller and Gmelin. Several foreign authors have entertained an opinion, that the court of Ru&s;&s;ia &s;tudiou&s;ly conceals the progre&s;s which has been made by more recent navigators, and &s;uffers the Public to be amu&s;ed with fal&s;e ac|counts of their route. Such conduct appeared to me un&s;uitable to tho&s;e liberal &s;entiments, and that patronage of &s;cience, for which the pre&s;ent &s;ove|reign of Ru&s;&s;ia is eminent; nor could I di&s;cern any political rea&s;on, that might render it improper to apply for information concerning the late at|tempts of the Ru&s;&s;ians to open a communication be|tween A&s;ia and America. My ingenious coun|tryman, Dr. Roger&s;on, fir&s;t phy&s;ician to the em|pre&s;s, pre&s;ented my reque&s;t to her Imperial Ma|je&s;ty, who not only di&s;claimed any idea of con|cealment, but in&s;tantly ordered the Journal of Captain Krenitzin, who conducted the only voy|age
<PB N="x" REF="034476_0009_0FFDD43D3340CDC8">
of di&s;covery made by public authority &s;ince the year 1741, to be tran&s;lated, and his original chart to be copied for my u&s;e. By con&s;ulting them, I have been enabled to give a more accu|rate view of the progre&s;s and extent of the Ru&s;&s;ian di&s;coveries, than has hitherto been communicated to the Public.</P>
<P>FROM other quarters I have received informa|tion of great utility and importance. M. le Che|valier de Pinto, the mini&s;ter from Portugal to the court of Great Britain, who commanded for &s;e|veral years at Matagro&s;&s;o, a &s;ettlement of the Portugue&s;e in the interior part of Brazil, where the Indians are numerous, and their original man|ners little altered by intercour&s;e with Europeans, was plea&s;ed to &s;end me very full an&s;wers to &s;ome queries concerning the character and in&s;titutions of the natives of America, which his polite re|ception of an application made to him in my name, encouraged me to propo&s;e. The&s;e &s;atis|fied me, that he had contemplated with a di&s;cern|ing attention the curious objects which his &s;itua|tion pre&s;ented to his view, and I have often fol|lowed him as one of my be&s;t-in&s;tructed guides.</P>
<P>M. SUARD, to who&s;e elegant tran&s;lation of the Hi&s;tory of the Reign of Charles V. I owe the favourable reception of that work on the continent, procured me an&s;wers to the &s;ame queries from M. de Bougainville, who had op|portunities of ob&s;erving the Indians both of North
<PB N="xi" REF="034476_0010_0FFDD440CED58410">
and South America, and from M. Godin le Jeune, who re&s;ided fifteen years among Indians in Quito, and twenty years in Cayenne. The latter are more valuable from having been examined by M. de la Condamine, who, a few weeks before his death, made &s;ome &s;hort additions to them, which may be con&s;idered as the la&s;t effort of that atten|tion to &s;cience which occupied a long life.</P>
<P>MY inquiries were not confined to one region in America. Governor Hutchin&s;on took the trouble of recommending the con&s;ideration of my queries to Mr. Hawley and Mr. Brainerd, two prote&s;tant mi&s;&s;ionaries, employed among the In|dians of the Five Nations, who favoured me with an&s;wers, which di&s;cover a con&s;iderable knowledge of the people who&s;e cu&s;toms they di&s;cribe. From William Smith, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> the ingenious hi&s;torian of New York, I received &s;ome u&s;eful information. When I enter upon the Hi&s;tory of our Colonies in North America, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to ac|knowledge how much I have been indebted to many other gentlemen of that country.</P>
<P>FROM the valuable Collection of Voyages made by Alexander Dalrymple, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> with who&s;e at|tention to the Hi&s;tory of Navigation and Di&s;covery the Public is well acquainted, I have received &s;ome very rare books, particularly two large volumes of Memorials, partly manu&s;cript, and partly in print, which were pre&s;ented to the court of Spain during the reigns of Philip III. and Philip IV.
<PB N="xii" REF="034476_0011_0FFDD443A2588AA0">
From the&s;e I have learned many curious particulars with re&s;pect to the interior &s;tate of the Spani&s;h colonies, and the various &s;chemes formed for their improvement. As this Collection of Memorials formerly belonged to the Colbert Library, I have quoted them by that title.</P>
<P>ALL tho&s;e books and manu&s;cripts I have con|&s;ulted with that attention which the re&s;pect due from an Author to the Public required; and by minute references to them, I have endeavoured to authenticate whatever I relate. The longer I reflect on the nature of hi&s;torical compo&s;ition, the more I am convinced that this &s;crupulous ac|curacy is nece&s;&s;ary. The hi&s;torian who records the events of his own time, is credited in propor|tion to the opinion which the Public entertains with re&s;pect to his means of information and his veracity. He who delineates the tran&s;actions of a remote period, has no title to claim a&s;&s;ent, unle&s;s he produces evidence in proof of his a&s;&s;ertions. Without this, he may write an amu&s;ing tale, but cannot be &s;aid to have compo&s;ed an authentic hi&s;tory. In tho&s;e &s;entiments I have been confirm|ed by the opinion of an Author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gibbon.</NOTE>, whom his in|du&s;try, erudition, and di&s;cernment, have de&s;erv|edly placed in a high rank among the mo&s;t emi|nent hi&s;torians of the age. Emboldened by a hint from him, I have publi&s;hed a catalogue of the Spani&s;h books which I have con&s;ulted. This prac|tice
<PB N="xiii" REF="034476_0012_0FFDD4454B4400B0">
was frequent in the la&s;t century, and was con&s;idered as an evidence of laudable indu&s;try, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y in an author; in the pre&s;ent, it may, perhaps, be deemed the effect of o&s;tentation; but as many of the&s;e books are unknown in Great Britain, I could not otherwi&s;e have referred to them as au|thorities, without incumbering the page with an in&s;ertion of their full titles. To any per&s;on who may chu&s;e to follow me in this path of inquiry, the catalogue mu&s;t be very u&s;eful.</P>
<P>MY readers will ob&s;erve, that in mentioning &s;ums of money, I have uniformly followed the Spani&s;h method of computing by <HI>pe&s;os.</HI> In Ame|rica, the pe&s;o <HI>fuerte,</HI> or <HI>duro,</HI> is the only one known, and that is always meant when any &s;um imported from America is mentioned. The pe&s;o fuerte, as well as other coins, has varied in its numerary value; but I have been advi&s;ed, without attending to &s;uch minute variations, to con&s;ider it as equal to four &s;hillings and &s;ixpence of our money. It is to be remembered, however, that in the &s;ixteenth century, the effective value of a pe&s;o, i. e. the quantity of labour which it repre|&s;ented, or of goods which it would purcha&s;e, was five or &s;ix times as much as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>N. B. Since this edition was put into the pre&s;s, a Hi&s;tory of Mexico, in two volumes in quarto, tran&s;lated from the Italian of the Abb&eacute; D. Fran|ce&s;co Saverio Clavigero, has been publi&s;hed. From a per&s;on, who is a native of New Spain,
<PB N="xiv" REF="034476_0013_0FFDD449E30702B0">
who has re&s;ided forty years in that country, and who is acquainted with the Mexican language, it was natural to expect much new information. Upon peru&s;ing his work, however, I find that it contains hardly any addition to the ancient Hi&s;tory of the Mexican empire, as related by Aco&s;ta and Herrea, but what is derived from the impro|bable narratives and fanciful conjectures of Tor|quemada and Boturini. Having copied their &s;plendid de&s;criptions of the high &s;tate of civiliza|tion in the Mexican empire, M. Clavigero, in the abundance of his zeal for the honour of his native country, charges me with having mi&s;taken &s;ome points, and with having mi&s;repre&s;ented others, in the Hi&s;tory of it. When an author is con&s;cious of having exerted indu&s;try in re&s;earch and im|partiality in deci&s;ion; he may without pre&s;ump|tion, claim what prai&s;e is due to the&s;e qualities, and he cannot be in&s;en&s;ible to any accu&s;ation that tends to weaken the force of his claim. A feel|ing of this kind has induced me to examine &s;uch &s;trictures of M. Clavigero on my Hi&s;tory of Ame|rica as merited any attention, e&s;pecially as the&s;e are made by one, who &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of obtaining accurate information; and to &s;hew that the greater part of them is de&s;titute of any ju&s;t found|ation. This I have done in notes upon the pa&s;&s;ages in my Hi&s;tory, which gave ri&s;e to his critici&s;ms.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF <HI>AMERICA.</HI> BOOK I.</HEAD>
<P>THE progre&s;s of men in di&s;covering and peo|pling the various parts of the earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. The earth &s;lowly peo|pled.</NOTE> has been extremely &s;low. Several ages elap&s;ed before they removed far from tho&s;e mild and fertile regions in which they were originally placed by their Creator. The occa&s;ion of their fir&s;t general di&s;|per&s;ion is known; but we are unacquainted with the cour&s;e of their migrations, or the time when they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the different countries which they now inhabit. Neither hi&s;tory nor tradition furni&s;h &s;uch information concerning tho&s;e remote events, as enables us to trace, with any certainty, the operations of the human race in the infancy of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>WE may conclude, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t migra|tions by land.</NOTE> that all the early migrations of mankind were made by land. The ocean, which &s;urrounds the habitable earth, as well as the various arms of the &s;ea which &s;eparate one region from another, though de&s;tined to facilitate the communication between di&s;tant countries, &s;eem, at fir&s;t; view, to be formed to check the progre&s;s of man and to mark the bounds of that portion of the globe to which nature had confined him It was long, we may believe, before men attempted

to pa&s;s the&s;e formidable barriers, and became &s;o &s;kilful and adventrous as to commit them&s;elves to the mercy of the winds and waves, or to quit their native &s;hores in que&s;t of remote and unknown re|gions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t at|tempts to|wards navi|gation.</NOTE>NAVIGATION and &s;hip-building are arts &s;o nice and complicated, that they require the ingenuity, as well as experience, of many &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages to bring them to any degree of perfection. From the raft or canoe, which fir&s;t &s;erved to carry a &s;avage over the river that ob&s;tructed him in the chace, to the con&s;truction of a ve&s;&s;el capable of conveying a numerous crew with &s;afety to a di&s;tant coa&s;t, the progre&s;s in improvement is immen&s;e. Many efforts would be made, many experiments would be tried, and much labour as well as invention would be employed, before men could accompli&s;h this ardu|ous and important undertaking. The rude and imperfect &s;tate in which navigation is &s;till found among all nations which are not con&s;iderably civil|ized, corre&s;ponds with this account of its progre&s;s, and demon&s;trates that, in early times, the art was not &s;o far improved as to enable men to undertake di&s;tant voyages, or to attempt remote di&s;coveries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduc|tion of commerce.</NOTE>AS &s;oon however, as the art of navigation be|came known, a new &s;pecies of corre&s;pondence among men took place. It is from this aera, that we mu&s;t date the commencement of &s;uch an inter|cour&s;e between nations as de&s;erves the appellation of commerce. Men are, indeed, far advanced in improvement before commerce becomes an object of great importance to them. They mu&s;t even have made &s;ome con&s;iderable progre&s;s towards ci|vilization, before they acquire the idea of property, and a&s;certain it &s;o perfectly as to be acquainted with the mo&s;t &s;imple of all contracts, that of ex|changing by barter one rude commodity for ano|ther. But as &s;oon as this important right is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and every individual feels that he has an
<PB N="39" REF="034476_0037_0FFDD489DA2728F0">
exclu&s;ive title to po&s;&s;e&s;s or to alienate whatever he has acquired by his own labour or dexterity, the wants and ingenuity of his nature &s;ugge&s;t to him a new method of increa&s;ing his acqui&s;itions and en|joyments, by di&s;po&s;ing of what is &s;uperfluous in his own &s;tores, in order to procure what is nece&s;|&s;ary or de&s;irable in tho&s;e of other men. Thus a commercial intercour&s;e begins, and is carried on among the members of the &s;ame community. By degrees, they di&s;cover that neighbouring tribes po&s;|&s;e&s;s what they them&s;elves want, and enjoy com|forts of which they wi&s;h to partake In the &s;ame mode, and upon the &s;ame principles, that dome&s;tic traffic is carried on within the &s;ociety, an external commerce is e&s;tabli&s;hed with other tribes or nations. Their mutual intere&s;t and mutual wants render this intercour&s;e de&s;irable, and imperceptibly introduce the maxims and laws which facilitate its progre&s;s and render it &s;ecure. But no very exten&s;ive com|merce can take place between contiguous provin|ces, who&s;e &s;oil and climate being nearly the &s;ame, yield &s;imilar productions. Remote countries can|not convey their commodities by land, to tho&s;e places, where on account of their rarity they are de&s;ired, and become valuable. It is to navigation that men are indebted for the power of tran&s;port|ing the &s;uperfluous &s;tock of one part of the earth, to &s;upply the wants of another. The luxuries and ble&s;&s;ings of a particular climate are no longer con|fined to it&s;elf alone, but the enjoyment of them is communicated to the mo&s;t di&s;tant regions.</P>
<P>IN proportion as the knowledge of the advan|tages derived from navigation and commerce con|tinued to &s;pread, the intercour&s;e among nations ex|tended. The ambition of conque&s;t, or the nece&s;|&s;ity of procuring new &s;ettlements, were no longer the &s;ole motives of vi&s;iting di&s;tant lands. The de|&s;ire of gain became a new incentive to activity, rou&s;ed adventurers, and &s;ent them forth upon long

voyages, in &s;earch of countries, who&s;e products or wants might increa&s;e that circulation, which nou|ri&s;hes and gives vigour to commerce. Trade prov|ed a great &s;ource of di&s;covery, it opened unknown &s;eas, it penetrated into new regions, and contri|buted more than any other cau&s;e, to bring men ac|quainted with the &s;ituation, the nature, and com|modities of the different parts of the globe. But even after a regular commerce was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world, after nations were con&s;iderably civilized, and the &s;ciences and arts were cultivated with ar|dour and &s;ucce&s;s, navigation continued to be &s;o imperfect, that it can hardly be &s;aid to have ad|vanced beyond the infancy of its improvement in the ancient world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Imperfec|tion of na|vigation a|mong the ancients.</NOTE>AMONG all the nations of antiquity the &s;tructure of their ve&s;&s;els was extremely rude, and their me|thod of working them very defective. They were unacquainted with &s;everal principles and operations in navigation, which are now con&s;idered as the fir&s;t elements on which that &s;cience is founded. Though that property of the magnet, by which it attracts iron, was well known to the ancients, its more im|portant and amazing virtue of pointing to the poles had entirely e&s;caped their ob&s;ervation. De&s;titute of this faithful guide, which now conducts the pilot with &s;o much certainty in the unbounded ocean, during the darkne&s;s of night, or when the heavens are covered with clouds, the ancients had no other method of regulating their cour&s;e than by ob&s;erv|ing the &s;un and &s;tars. Their navigation was of con&s;equence uncertain and timid. They dur&s;t &s;eldom quit &s;ight of land, but crept along the coa&s;t, expo&s;ed to all the dangers, and retarded by all the ob&s;tructions, unavoidable in holding &s;uch an aukward cour&s;e. An incredible length of time was requi&s;ite for performing voyages, which are now fini&s;hed in a &s;hort &s;pace. Even in the milde&s;t

climates, and in &s;eas the lea&s;t tempe&s;tuous, it was only during the &s;ummer months that the ancients ventured out of their harbours. The remainder of the year was lo&s;t in inactivity. It would have been deemed mo&s;t incon&s;iderate ra&s;hne&s;s to have braved the fury of the winds and waves during winter.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vegetius de Re milit. lib. iv.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHILE both the &s;cience and practice of naviga|tion continued to be &s;o defective, it was an under|taking of no &s;mall difficulty and danger to vi&s;it any remote region of the earth. Under every di&s;ad|vantage, however, the active &s;pirit of commerce exerted it&s;elf. The Egyptians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Navigation and com|merce of the Egyp|tians.</NOTE> &s;oon after the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of their monarchy, are &s;aid to have opened a trade between the Arabian Gulph or Red Sea, and the we&s;tern coa&s;t of the great Indian continent. The commodities which they imported from the ea&s;t, were carried by land from the Ara|bian Gulph to the banks of the Nile, and conveyed down that river to the Mediterranean. But if the Egyptians in early times applied them&s;elves to com|merce, their attention to it was of &s;hort duration. The fertile &s;oil and mild climate of Egypt produced the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life with &s;uch pro|fu&s;ion, as rendered its inhabitants &s;o independent of other countries, that it became an e&s;tabli&s;hed maxim among that people, who&s;e ideas and in&s;titu|tions differed in almo&s;t every point from tho&s;e of other nations, to renounce all intercour&s;e with fo|reigners. In con&s;equence of this, they never went out of their own country; they held all &s;ea-faring per&s;ons in dete&s;tation, as impious and profane; and fortifying their own harbours, they denied &s;trangers admittance into them. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Diod.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Phe|nicians.</NOTE>THE character and &s;ituation of the Phenicians were as favourable to the &s;pirit of commerce and di&s;covery as tho&s;e of the Egyptians were adver&s;e to it. They had no di&s;tingui&s;hing peculiarity in their manners and in&s;titutions; they were not addicted to any &s;ingular and un&s;ocial form of &s;uper&s;tition; they could mingle with other nations without &s;cruple or reluctance. The territory which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was neither large nor fertile. Commerce was the only &s;ource from which they could derive opulence or power. Accordingly, the trade car|ried on by the Phenicians of Sidon and Tyre, was more exten&s;ive and enterpri&s;ing than that of any &s;tate in the ancient world. The genius of the Phe|nicians, as well as the object of their policy and the &s;pirit of their laws, were entirely commercial. They were a people of merchants who aimed at the empire of the &s;ea, and actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it. Their &s;hips not only frequented all the ports in the Me|diterranean, but they were the fir&s;t who ventured beyond the ancient boundaries of navigation, and pa&s;&s;ing the Streights of Gades, vi&s;ited the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Spain and Africa. In many of the places to which they re&s;orted, they planted colonies, and communicated to the rude inhabitants &s;ome know|ledge of their arts and improvements. While they extended their di&s;coveries towards the north and the we&s;t, they did not neglect to penetrate into the more opulent and fertile regions of the &s;outh and ea&s;t. Having rendered them&s;elves ma&s;ters of &s;eve|ral commodious harbours towards the bottom of the Arabian Gulph, they, after the example of the Egyptians, e&s;tabli&s;hed a regular intercour&s;e with Arabia and the continent of India on the one hand, and with the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa on the other.

From the&s;e countries they imported many valuable commodities, unknown to the re&s;t of the world, and during a long period, engro&s;&s;ed that lucrative branch of commerce without a rival.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE I. in Vol. I.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE va&s;t wealth which the Phenicians acquired by monopolizing the trade carried on in the Red Sea, incited their neighbours the Jews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Jews</NOTE> under the pro&s;perous reigns of David and Solomon, to aim at being admitted to &s;ome &s;hare of it. This they obtained partly by their conque&s;t of Idumea, which &s;tretches along the Red Sea, and partly by their alliance with Hiram King of Tyre. Solomon fit|ted out fleets, which, under the direction of Phe|nician pilots, &s;ailed from the Red Sea to Tar&s;hi&s;h and Ophir. The&s;e it is probable were ports in In|dia and Africa which their conductors were ac|cu&s;tomed to frequent, and from them the Jewi&s;h &s;hips returned with &s;uch valuable cargoes as &s;ud|denly diffu&s;ed wealth and &s;plendour through the kingdom of I&s;rael.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Memoire &s;ur le Pays d'Ophir par M. D'Anville, Mem. de l'Academ. des In&s;cript. &amp;c. tom. xxx. 83.</NOTE> But the &s;ingular in&s;titutions of the Jews, the ob&s;ervance of which was enjoined by their divine legi&s;lator, with an intention of pre|&s;erving them a &s;eparate people, uninfected by ido|latry, formed a national character incapable of that open and liberal intercour&s;e with &s;trangers which commerce requires. Accordingly, this un&s;ocial genius of the people, together with the di&s;a&s;ters which befel the kingdom of I&s;rael, prevented the commercial &s;pirit which their monarchs laboured to introduce, and to cheri&s;h, from &s;preading among them. The Jews cannot be numbered among the nations which contributed to improve navigation, or to extend di&s;covery.</P>
<P>BUT though the in&s;tructions and example of the Phenicians were unable to mould the manners and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Car|thaginians.</NOTE>

temper of the Jews, in oppo&s;ition to the tendency of their laws, they tran&s;mitted the commercial &s;pirit with facility, and in full vigour, to their own de|&s;cendants the Carthaginians. The commonwealth of Carthage applied to trade and to naval affairs, with no le&s;s ardour, ingenuity, and &s;ucce&s;s, than its parent &s;tate. Carthage early rivalled, and &s;oon &s;urpa&s;&s;ed Tyre, in opulence and power, but &s;eems not to have aimed at obtaining any &s;hare in the commerce with India. The Phenicians had en|gro&s;&s;ed this, and had &s;uch a command of the Red Sea, as &s;ecured to them the exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that lucrative branch of trade. The commercial activity of the Carthaginians was exerted in another direction. Without contending for the trade of the ea&s;t with their mother-country, they extended their navigation chiefly towards the we&s;t and north. Following the cour&s;e which the Phenicians had opened, they pa&s;&s;ed the Streights of Gades, and pu&s;hing their di&s;coveries far beyond tho&s;e of the parent &s;tate, vi&s;ited not only all the coa&s;ts of Spain, but tho&s;e of Gaul, and penetrated at la&s;t into Bri|tain. At the &s;ame time that they acquired know|ledge of new countries in this part of the globe, they gradually carried their re&s;earches towards the South. They made con&s;iderable progre&s;s, by land, into the interior provinces of Africa, traded with &s;ome of them, and &s;ubjected others to their em|pire. They &s;ailed along the we&s;tern coa&s;t of that great continent, almo&s;t to the tropic of Cancer, and planted &s;everal colonies, in order to civilize the natives, and accu&s;tom them to commerce. They di&s;covered the Fortunate I&s;lands, now known by the name of the Canaries, the utmo&s;t boundary of ancient navigation in the we&s;tern ocean.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plinii Nat.

It is evident that the Phenicians, who in&s;tructed the Greeks in many other u&s;eful &s;ciences and arts, did not communicate to them that exten|&s;ive knowledge of navigation which they them|&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; nor did the Romans imbibe that commercial &s;pirit and ardour for di&s;covery which di&s;tingui&s;hed their rivals the Carthaginians.&mdash; Though Greece be almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ea, which formed many &s;pacious bays and commodious harbours, though it be &s;urrounded by a great num|ber of fertile i&s;lands, yet notwith&s;tanding &s;uch a favourable &s;ituation, which &s;eemed to invite that ingenious people to apply them&s;elves to navigation, it was long before this a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t attained any degree of perfection among them. Their early voyages, the object of which was piracy rather than commerce, were &s;o incon&s;iderable, that the expedition of the Argonauts from the coa&s;t of The&s;&s;aly to the Eux|ine &s;ea, appeared &s;uch an amazing effort of &s;kill and courage, as entitled the conductors of it to be ranked among the demigods, and exalted the ve&s;&s;el in which they &s;ailed to a place among the heavenly con&s;tellations. Even at a later period, when the Greeks engaged in their famous enterprize again&s;t Troy, their knowledge in naval affairs &s;eems not to have been much improved. According to the ac|count of Homer, the only poet to whom hi&s;tory

ventures to appeal, and who, by his &s;crupulous accuracy in de&s;cribing the manners and arts of early ages, merits this di&s;tinction, the &s;cience of navigation, at that time, had hardly advanced be|yond its rude&s;t &s;tate. The Greeks in the heroic age &s;eem to have been unacquainted with the u&s;e of iron, the mo&s;t &s;erviceable of all the metals, with|out which no con&s;iderable progre&s;s was ever made in the mechanical arts. Their ve&s;&s;els were of con|&s;iderable burthen, and mo&s;tly without decks. They had only one ma&s;t, which was erected or taken down at plea&s;ure. They were &s;trangers to the u&s;e of anchors. All their operations in &s;ailing were clum&s;y and un&s;kilful. They turned their ob|&s;ervations towards &s;tars, which were improper for regulating their cour&s;e, and their mode of ob|&s;erving them was inaccurate and fallacious. When they had fini&s;hed a voyage they drew their paltry barks a&s;hore, as &s;avages do their canoes, and the&s;e remained on dry land until the &s;ea&s;on of returning to &s;ea approached. It is not then in the early or heroic ages of Greece that we can expect to ob|&s;erve the &s;cience of navigation, and the &s;pirit of di&s;covery, making any con&s;iderable progre&s;s. Du|ring that period of di&s;order and ignorance, a thou|&s;and cau&s;es concurred in re&s;training curio&s;ity and enterprize within very narrow bounds.</P>
<P>BUT the Greeks advanced with rapidity to a &s;tate of greater civilization and refinement. Go|vernment in its mo&s;t liberal and perfect form, be|gan to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in their different communi|ties; equal laws and regular police were gradually introduced; the &s;ciences and arts which are u&s;eful or ornamental in life were carried to a high pitch of improvement, and &s;everal of the Grecian com|monwealths applied to commerce with &s;uch ardour and &s;ucce&s;s, that they were con&s;idered, in the an|cient world, as maritime powers of the fir&s;t rank.
<PB N="49" REF="034476_0047_0FFDD4A328A41D20">
Even then, however, the naval victories of the Greeks mu&s;t be a&s;cribed rather to the native &s;pirit of the people, and to that courage which the en|joyment of liberty in&s;pires, than to any extraor|dinary progre&s;s in the &s;cience of navigation. In the Per&s;ian war, tho&s;e exploits which the genius of the Greek hi&s;torians has rendered &s;o famous, were performed by fleets, compo&s;ed chiefly of &s;mall ve&s;|&s;els without decks;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thucyd. lib. i. c. 14.</NOTE> the crews of which ru&s;hed forward with impetuous valour, but little art, to board tho&s;e of the enemy. In the war of Pelo|ponne&s;us, their &s;hips &s;eem &s;till to have been of in|con&s;iderable burthen and force. The extent of their trade, how highly &s;oever it may have been e&s;timated in ancient times, was in proportion to this low condition of their marine. The maritime &s;tates of Greece hardly carried on any commerce beyond the limits of the Mediterranean &s;ea. Their chief intercour&s;e was with the colonies of their countrymen, planted in the le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, in Italy and Sicily. They &s;ometimes vi&s;ited the ports of Egypt, of the &s;outhern provinces of Gaul, and of Thrace; or pa&s;&s;ing through the Helle&s;pont, they traded with the countries &s;ituated around the Euxine &s;ea. Amazing in&s;tances occur of their ignorance even of tho&s;e countries which lay within the narrow precincts to which their navigation was confined. When the Greeks had a&s;&s;embled their combined fleet again&s;t Xerxes at Egina, they thought it un|advi&s;able to &s;ail to Samos, becau&s;e they believed the di&s;tance between that i&s;land and Egina to be as great as the di&s;tance between Egina and the Pillars of Hercules<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heredot. lib. viii. c. 132.</NOTE>. They were either utterly unac|quainted with all the parts of the globe beyond the Mediterranean &s;ea, or what knowledge they had of them was founded on conjecture, or derived from the information of a few per&s;ons, whom curio&s;ity

and the love of &s;cience had prompted to travel by land into the Upper A&s;ia, or by &s;ea into Egypt, the ancient &s;eats of wi&s;dom and arts. After all that the Greeks learned from them, they appear to have been ignorant of the mo&s;t important facts on which an accurate and &s;cientific knowledge of the globe is founded.</P>
<P>THE expedition of Alexander the Great into the ea&s;t, con&s;iderably enlarged the &s;phere of naviga|tion and of geographical knowledge among the Greeks. That extraordinary man, notwith&s;tanding the violent pa&s;&s;ions which incited him, at &s;ome times, to the wilde&s;t actions, and the mo&s;t extra|vagant enterpri&s;es, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed talents which fitted him not only to conquer, but to govern the world. He was capable of framing tho&s;e bold and original &s;chemes of policy, which gave a new form to hu|man affairs. The revolution in commerce, brought about by the force of his genius, is hardly inferior to that revolution in empire occa&s;ioned by the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms. It is probable that the oppo|&s;ition and efforts of the republic of Tyre, which checked him &s;o long in the career of his victories, gave Alexander an opportunity of ob&s;erving the va&s;t re&s;ources of a maratime power, and conveyed to him &s;ome idea of the immen&s;e wealth which the Tyrians derived from their commerce, e&s;pecially that with the Ea&s;t-Indies. As &s;oon as he had ac|compli&s;hed the de&s;truction of Tyre, and reduced Egypt to &s;ubjection, he formed the plan of ren|dering the empire which he propo&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h, the center of commerce as well as the &s;eat of do|minion. With this view he founded a great city, which he honoured with his own name, near one of the mouths of the river Nile, that, by the Medi|terranean &s;ea, and the neighbourhood of the Ara|bian Gulf, it might command the trade both of the ea&s;t and we&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strab.

&s;uch di&s;cernment, that Alexandria &s;oon became the chief commercial city in the world. Not only during the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Grecian empire in Egypt and in the ea&s;t, but amid&s;t all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive revolutions in tho&s;e countries, from the time of the Ptolemies to the di&s;covery of the navigation by the Cape of Good Hope, commerce, particular|ly that of the Ea&s;t-Indies, continued to flow in the channel which the &s;agacity and fore&s;ight of Alexander had marked out for it.</P>
<P>HIS ambition was not &s;atisfied with having open|ed to the Greeks a communication with India by &s;ea; he a&s;pired to the &s;overeignty of tho&s;e regions which furni&s;hed the re&s;t of mankind with &s;o many precious commodities, and conducted his army thither by land. Enterpri&s;ing, however, as he was, he may be &s;aid rather to have viewed, than to have conquered that country. He did not, in his progre&s;s towards the ea&s;t, advance beyond the banks of the rivers that fall into the Indus, which is now the we&s;tern boundary of the va&s;t continent of India. Amid&s;t the wild exploits which di&s;tin|gui&s;h this part of his hi&s;tory, he pur&s;ued mea|&s;ures that mark the &s;uperiority of his genius, as well as the extent of his views. He had penetrated as far into India as to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m his opinion of its commercial importan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and to perceive that im|men&s;e wealth might be derived from intercour&s;e with a country, where the arts of elegance having been more early cultivated, were arrived at greater perfection than in any other part of the earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strab.

between them. In order to effect this, he propo&s;ed to remove the cataracts, with which the jealou&s;y of the Per&s;ians, and their aver&s;ion to corre&s;pondence with foreigners, had ob&s;tructed the entrance into the Euphrates;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strab.

He performed this voyage, which was deemed an enterpri&s;e &s;o arduous and important, that Alexander reckoned it one of the mo&s;t extraordinary events which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed his reign. Incon&s;iderable as it may now appear, it was, at that time, an undertaking of no little merit and difficulty. In the pro&s;ecution of it, &s;triking in&s;tances occur of the &s;mall progre&s;s which the Greeks had made in naval knowledge<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See NOTE IV.</NOTE>.

Accordingly, they &s;pent no le&s;s than ten <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hi&s;t. Nat. lib. vi. c. 23.</NOTE> months in performing this voyage, which, from the mouth

of the Indus to that of the Per&s;ian Gulf, does not exceed twenty degrees. It is probable, that amid&s;t the violent convul&s;ions and frequent revolutions in the Ea&s;t, occa&s;ioned by the conte&s;ts among the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of Alexander, the navigation to India, by the cour&s;e which Nearchus had opened, was di&s;continued. The Indian trade carried on at Alex|andria not only &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, but was &s;o much ex|tended under the Grecian monarchs of Egypt, that it proved a great &s;ource of the wealth which di&s;tingui&s;hed their kingdom.</P>
<P>THE progre&s;s which the Romans made in navi|gation and di&s;covery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Ro|mans.</NOTE> was &s;till more incon&s;iderable than that of the Greeks. The genius of the Ro|man people, their military education, and the &s;pi|rit of their laws concurred in e&s;tranging them from commerce and naval affairs. It was the nece&s;&s;ity of oppo&s;ing a formidable rival, not the de&s;ire of extending trade, which fir&s;t prompted them to aim at maritime power. Though they &s;oon perceived that, in order to acquire the univer&s;al dominion after which they a&s;pired, it was nece&s;&s;ary to ren|der them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the &s;ea, they &s;till con&s;i|dered the naval &s;ervice as a &s;ubordinate &s;tation, and re&s;erved for it &s;uch citizens as were not of a rank to be admitted into the legions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polyb. lib. v.</NOTE>. In the hi&s;|tory of the Roman republic, hardly one event oc|curs, that marks attention to navigation any farther than as it was in&s;trumental towards conque&s;t. When the Roman valour and di&s;cipline had &s;ub|dued all the maritime &s;tates known in the ancient world; when Carthage, Greece, and Egypt had &s;ubmitted to their power, the Romans did not im|bibe the commercial &s;pirit of the conquered na|tions. Among that people of &s;oldiers, to have ap|plied to trade would have been deemed a degrada|tion of a Roman citizen. They abandoned the me|chanical

arts, commerce, and navigation, to &s;laves, to freedmen, to provincials, and to citizens of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s. Even after the &s;ubver&s;ion of liberty, when the &s;everity and haughtine&s;s of ancient man|ners began to abate, commerce did not ri&s;e into high e&s;timation among the Romans. The trade of Greece, Egypt, and the other conquered coun|tries, continued to be carried on in its u&s;ual chan|nels, after they were reduced into the form of Ro|man provinces. As Rome was the capital of the world, and the &s;eat of government, all the wealth and valuable productions of the provinces flowed naturally thither. The Romans, &s;atisfied with this, &s;eem to have &s;uffered commerce to remain almo&s;t entirely in the hands of the natives of the re&s;pective countries. The extent, however, of the Roman power, which reached over the greate&s;t part of the known world, the vigilant in&s;pection of the Roman magi&s;trates, and the &s;pirit of the Roman govern|ment, no le&s;s intelligent than active, gave &s;uch ad|ditional &s;ecurity to commerce, as animated it with new vigour. The union among nations was never &s;o entire, nor the intercour&s;e &s;o perfect, as within the bounds of this va&s;t empire. Commerce un|der the Roman dominion, was not ob&s;tructed by the jealou&s;y of rival &s;tates, interrupted by frequent ho&s;tilities, or limited by partial re&s;trictions. One &s;uperintending power moved and regulated the in|du&s;try of mankind, and enjoyed the fruits of their joint efforts.</P>
<P>NAVIGATION felt this influence, and improved under it. As &s;oon as the Romans acquired a ta&s;te for the luxuries of the Ea&s;t, the trade with India through Egypt was pu&s;hed with new vigour, and carried on to greater extent. By frequenting the Indian continent, navigators became acquainted with the periodical cour&s;e of the winds, which, in

Encouraged by ob&s;erv|ing this, the pilots who &s;ailed from Egypt to India abandoned their ancient &s;low and dangerous cour&s;e along the coa&s;t, and as &s;oon as the we&s;tern mon&s;oon &s;et in, took their departure from Ocelis, at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf, and &s;tretched boldly acro&s;s the ocean <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plin.

The uniform direction of the wind &s;upplying the place of the compa&s;s, and ren|dering the guidance of the &s;tars le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, con|ducted them to the port of Mu&s;iris, on the we&s;tern &s;hore of the Indian continent. There they took on board their cargo, and returning with the ea&s;tern mon&s;oon, fini&s;hed their voyage to the Arabian Gulf within the year. This part of India, now known by the name of the Malabar coa&s;t, &s;eems to have been the utmo&s;t limit of ancient navigation in that quarter of the globe. What imperfect knowledge the ancients had of the immen&s;e countries which &s;tretch beyond this towards the ea&s;t, they received from a few adventurers, who had vi&s;ited them by land. Such excur&s;ions were neither frequent nor exten&s;ive, and it is probable, that while the Roman intercour&s;e with India &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, no traveller ever penetrated farther than to the banks of the Ganges.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strab.

by its neighbours the Gauls, and by a few Carthaginian merchants. The name of Germany had &s;carcely been heard of. Into all the&s;e coun|tries the arms of the Romans penetrated. They entirely &s;ubdued Spain and Gaul; they conquered the greate&s;t and mo&s;t fertile part of Britain; they advanced into Germany, as far as the banks of the river Elbe. In Africa, they acquired a con&s;idera|ble knowledge of the provinces which &s;tretch along the Mediterranean &s;ea, from Egypt we&s;tward to the &s;traits of Gades. In A&s;ia, they not only &s;ub|jected to their power mo&s;t of the provinces which compo&s;ed the Pru&s;&s;ian and Macedonian empires, but, after their victories over Mithridates and Ti|granes, they &s;eem to have made a more accurate &s;urvey of the countries contiguous to the Euxine and Ca&s;pian &s;eas, and to have carried on a more exten&s;ive trade than that of the Greeks with the opulent and commercial nations, then &s;eated round the Euxine &s;ea.</P>

They were almo&s;t totally unacquainted with the va&s;t countries which are now &s;ubject to the Kings of Denmark, Sweden, Pru&s;&s;ia, Poland, and the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. The more barren regions, that &s;tretch within the arctic circle, were quite unex|plored. In Africa, their re&s;earches did not extend far beyond the provinces which border on the Me|diterranean, and tho&s;e &s;ituated on the we&s;tern &s;hore of the Arabian Gulf. In A&s;ia, they were unacquainted, as I formerly ob&s;erved, with all the fertile and opulent countries beyond the Ganges, which furni&s;h the mo&s;t valuable commodities that, in modern times, have been the great object of the European commerce with India; nor do they &s;eem to have ever penetrated into tho&s;e immen&s;e regions occupied by the wandering tribes which they called by the general name of Sarmatians or Scythians, and which are now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Tartars of various denominations, and by the A&s;iatic &s;ubjects of Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A remar|kable proof of this.</NOTE>BUT there is one opinion, that univer&s;ally pre|vailed among the ancients, which conveys a more &s;triking idea of the &s;mall progre&s;s they had made in the knowledge of the habitable globe, than can be derived from any detail of their di&s;coveries. They &s;uppo&s;ed the earth to be divided into five regions, which they di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of zones. Two of the&s;e, which were neare&s;t the poles, they termed frigid zones, and believed that the extreme cold which reigned perpetually there, rendered them uninhabitable. Another, &s;eated under the line, and extending on either &s;ide towards the tropics, they called the torrid zone, and imagined it to be &s;o burnt up with unremitting heat, as to be equally de&s;titute of inhabitants. On the two other zones, which occupied the remainder of the earth, they be&s;towed the appellation of temperate, and taught that the&s;e, being the only regions in which life

could &s;ub&s;i&s;t, were allotted to man for his habitation. This wild opinion was not a conceit of the unin|formed vulgar, or a fanciful fiction of the poets, but a &s;y&s;tem adopted by the mo&s;t enlightened phi|lo&s;ophers, the mo&s;t accurate hi&s;torians and geo|graphers, in Greece and Rome According to this theory, a va&s;t portion of the habitable earth was pronounced to be un&s;it for &s;u&s;taining the hu|man &s;pecies. Tho&s;e fertile and populous regions within the torrid zone, which are now known not only to yield their own inhabitants the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life, with mo&s;t luxuriant profu|&s;ion, but to communicate their &s;uperfluous &s;tores to the re&s;t of the world, were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the man&s;ion of perpetual &s;terility and de&s;olation.

In this retreat he was attended by &s;ome of the mo&s;t learned men in his country, who aided him in his re&s;earches.

But, when they began to enter the torrid zone, the notion which prevailed among the ancients, that the heat which reigned perpetually there, was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to render it uninhabit|able, deterred them, for &s;ome time, from proceed|ing. Their own ob&s;ervations, when they fir&s;t ventured into this unknown and formidable region, tended to confirm the opinion of antiquity con|cerning the violent operation of the direct rays of the &s;un. As far as the river Senegal, the Portu|gue&s;e had found the coa&s;t of Africa inhabited by people nearly re&s;embling the Moors of Barbary. When they advanced to the &s;outh of that river, the human form &s;eemed to put on a new appear|ance. They beheld men with &s;kins black as ebony, with &s;hort curled hair, flat no&s;es, thick lips, and all the peculiar features which are now known to di&s;tingui&s;h the race of negroes. This &s;urpri&s;ing alteration they naturally attributed to the influence of heat, and if they &s;hould advance nearer to the line, they began to dread that its effects would be &s;till more violent. Tho&s;e dangers were exaggerated, and many other objections again&s;t attempting farther di&s;coveries were pro|po&s;ed by &s;ome of the grandees, who, from igno|rance, from envy, or from that cold timid pru|dence which rejects whatever has the air of novelty or enterpri&s;e, had hitherto condemned all prince Henry's &s;chemes. They repre&s;ented, that it was
<PB N="83" REF="034476_0081_0FFDD4FC78F47990">
altogether chimerical to expect any advantage from countries &s;ituated in that region which the wi&s;dom and experience of antiquity had pronounced to be unfit for the habitation of men; that their fore|fathers, &s;atisfied with cultivating the territory which Providence had allotted them, did not wa&s;te the &s;trength of the kingdom by fruitle&s;s projects, in que&s;t of new &s;ettlements; that Portugal was already exhau&s;ted by the expence of attempts to di&s;cover lands which either did not exi&s;t, or which nature de&s;tined to remain unknown; and was drained of men, who might have been employed in undertakings attended with more certain &s;ucce&s;s, and productive of greater benefit.

The di&s;coveries which he had already made convinced him that the ancients had little more than a conjectural knowledge of the torrid zone.

utter &s;trangers to true religion, wandering in hea|then darkne&s;s, or led a&s;tray by the delu&s;ions of Mahomet. He be&s;ought the holy father, to whom, as the vicar of Chri&s;t, all the kingdoms of the earth were &s;ubject, to confer on the crown of Portugal a right to all the countries po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Infidels, which &s;hould be di&s;covered by the in|du&s;try of its &s;ubjects, and &s;ubdued by the force of its arms.

Columbus got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the journals and charts of this expe|rienced navigator, and from them he learned the cour&s;e which the Portugue&s;e had held in making their di&s;coveries, as well as the various circum|&s;tances which guided or encouraged them in their attempts. The &s;tudy of the&s;e &s;oothed and in|flamed his favourite pa&s;&s;ion; and while he con|templated the maps, and read the de&s;criptions of the new countries which Pere&s;trello had &s;een, his impatience to vi&s;it them became irre&s;i&s;tible. In order to indulge it, he made a voyage to Madeira, and continued during &s;everal years to trade with that i&s;land, with the Canaries, the Azores, the &s;ettlements in Guinea, and all the other places which the Portu|gue&s;e had di&s;covered on the continent of Africa.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. iv. v.</NOTE></P>

The mind of Columbus, naturally inqui&s;itive, capable of deep reflection, and turned to &s;peculations of this kind, was &s;o often employed in revolving the principles upon which the Portugue&s;e had founded their &s;chemes of di&s;covery, and the mode on which they had carried them on, that he gradually began to form an idea of improving upon their plan, and of ac|compli&s;hing di&s;coveries which hitherto they had attempted in vain.</P>
<P>TO find out a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea to the Ea&s;t Indies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He forms the idea of a new cour&s;e to India.</NOTE> was the great object in view at that period. From the time that the Portugue&s;e doubled Cape de Verd, this was the point at which they aimed in all their navigations, and, in compari&s;on with it, all their di&s;coveries in Africa appeared incon&s;ider|able. The fertility and riches of India had been known for many ages; its &s;pices and other valuable commodities were in high reque&s;t throughout Eu|rope, and the va&s;t wealth of the Venetians ari&s;ing from their having engro&s;&s;ed this trade, had rai&s;ed the envy of all nations. But how intent &s;oever the Portugue&s;e were upon di&s;covering a new route to tho&s;e de&s;irable regions, they &s;earched for it only by &s;teering towards the &s;outh, in hopes of arriving at India, by turning to the ea&s;t, after they had &s;ailed
<PB N="98" REF="034476_0096_0FFDD524E5A86180">
round the farther extremity of Africa. This cour&s;e was &s;till unknown, and, even if di&s;covered, was of &s;uch immen&s;e length, that a voyage from Europe to India mu&s;t have appeared, at that period, an undertaking, extremely arduous, and of very uncer|tain i&s;&s;ue. More than half a century had been em|ployed in advancing from Cape Non to the equa|tor; a much longer &s;pace of time might elap&s;e be|fore the more exten&s;ive navigation from that to India could be accompli&s;hed. The&s;e reflections upon the uncertainty, the danger and tediou&s;ne&s;s of the cour&s;e which the Portugue&s;e were pur&s;uing, naturally led Columbus to con&s;ider whether a &s;horter and more direct pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies might not be found out. After revolving long and &s;eriou&s;ly every circum&s;tance &s;ugge&s;ted by his &s;upe|rior knowledge in the theory as well as practice of navigation, after comparing attentively the ob|&s;ervations of modern pilots with the hints and conjectures of ancient authors, he at la&s;t concluded, that by &s;ailing directly towards the we&s;t, acro&s;s the Atlantic ocean, new countries which probably formed a part of the great continent of India, mu&s;t infallibly be di&s;covered.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The princi|ples on which his theory was founded.</NOTE>PRINCIPLES and arguments of various kinds, and derived from different &s;ources, induced him to adopt this opinion, &s;eemingly as chimerical as it was new and extraordinary. The &s;pherical figure of the earth was known, and its magnitude a&s;cer|tained with &s;ome degree of accuracy. From this it was evident, that the comments of Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa, as far as they were known at that time, formed but a &s;mall portion of the terraqueous globe. It was &s;uitable to our ideas concerning the wi&s;dom and beneficence of the Author of Nature, to believe that the va&s;t &s;pace &s;till unexplored, was not covered entirely by a wa&s;te unprofitable ocean, but occupied by countries fit for the habitation of

man. It appeared likewi&s;e extremely probable, that the continent, on this &s;ide of the globe, was balanced by a proportional quantity of land in the other hemi&s;phere. The&s;e conclu&s;ions concerning the exi&s;tence of another continent, drawn from the figure and &s;tructure of the globe, were confirmed by the ob&s;ervations and conjectures of modern na|vigators. A Portugue&s;e pilot, having &s;tretched farther to the we&s;t than was u&s;ual at that time, took up a piece of timber artificially carved, float|ing upon the &s;ea; and as it was driven towards him by a we&s;terly wind, he concluded that it came from &s;ome unknown land, &s;ituated in that quarter. Columbus's brother-in-law had found, to the we&s;t of the Madeira i&s;les, a piece of timber fa&s;hioned in the &s;ame manner, and brought by the &s;ame wind; and had &s;een likewi&s;e canes of an enormous &s;ize floating upon the waves, which re&s;embled tho&s;e de&s;cribed by Ptolemy as productions peculiar to the Ea&s;t-Indies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. c. 17.</NOTE>. After a cour&s;e of we&s;terly winds, trees, torn up by the roots, were often driven upon the coa&s;ts of the Azores, and at one time the dead bodies of two men with &s;ingular features, re&s;em|bling neither the inhabitants of Europe nor of Africa, were ca&s;t a&s;hore there.</P>
<P>AS the force of this united evidence, ari&s;ing from theoretical principles and practical ob&s;erva|tions, led Columbus to expect the di&s;covery of new countries in the we&s;tern ocean, other rea&s;ons induced him to believe that the&s;e mu&s;t be con|nected with the continent of India. Though the ancients had hardly ever penetrated into India farther than the banks of the Ganges, yet &s;ome Greek authors had ventured to de&s;cribe the pro|vinces beyond that river.

The journal of Marco Polo, who had proceeded towards the ea&s;t far beyond the limits to which any European had ever advanced, &s;eemed to confirm the&s;e exaggerated accounts of the ancients. By his magnificent de&s;criptions of the kingdoms of <HI>Cathay</HI> and <HI>Cipango,</HI> and of many other countries, the names of which were unknown in Europe, India appeared to be a region of va&s;t extent. From the&s;e accounts, which, however de|fective, were the mo&s;t accurate that the people of Europe had received at that period, with re&s;pect to the remote parts of the Ea&s;t, Columbus drew a ju&s;t conclu&s;ion. He contended, that, in propor|tion as the continent of India &s;tretched out towards the Ea&s;t, it mu&s;t, in con&s;equence of the &s;pherical figure of the earth, approach nearer to the i&s;lands which had lately been di&s;covered to the we&s;t of Africa; that the di&s;tance from the one to the other was probably not very con&s;iderable; and that the mo&s;t direct, as well as &s;horte&s;t cour&s;e to the remote regions of the ea&s;t, was to be found by &s;ail|ing due we&s;t<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XII.</NOTE>.

Here every circum&s;tance &s;eemed to pro|mi&s;e him a more favourable reception. He ap|plied to a monarch of an enterpri&s;ing genius, no incompetent judge in naval affairs, and proud of patroni&s;ing every attempt to di&s;cover new coun|tries. His &s;ubjects were the mo&s;t experienced navigators in Europe, and the lea&s;t apt to be inti|midated either by the novelty or boldne&s;s of any maritime expedition.

I&s;abella, though more gene|rous and enterpri&s;ing, was under the influence of her hu&s;band in all her actions.

much regard to Columbus, as to remit the con&s;i|deration of his plan to the queen's confe&s;&s;or, Ferdinand de Talavera. He con&s;ulted &s;uch of his countrymen as were &s;uppo&s;ed be&s;t qualified to decide with re&s;pect to a &s;ubject of this kind. But true &s;cience had, hitherto, made &s;o little progre&s;s in Spain, that the pretended philo&s;ophers, &s;elected to judge in a matter of &s;uch moment, did not comprehend the fir&s;t principles upon which Co|lumbus founded his conjectures and hopes. Some of them, from mi&s;taken notions concerning the dimen&s;ions of the globe, contended that a voyage to tho&s;e remote parts of the ea&s;t, which Columbus expected to di&s;cover, could not be performed in le&s;s than three years. Others concluded, that either he would find the ocean to be of infinite extent, according to the opinion of &s;ome ancient philo&s;ophers; or, if he &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in &s;teering towards the we&s;t beyond a certain point, that the convex figure of the globe would prevent his re|turn, and that he mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h, in the vain attempt to open a communication between the two oppo&s;ite hemi&s;pheres, which nature had for ever disjoined. Even without deigning to enter into any particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, many rejected the &s;cheme in general, upon the credit of a maxim, under which the ignorant and unenterpri&s;ing &s;helter them&s;elves in every age, "That it is pre&s;umptu|ous in any per&s;on, to &s;uppo&s;e that he alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es knowledge &s;uperior to all the re&s;t of mankind united." They maintained, that if there were really any &s;uch countries as Columbus pretended, they could not have remained &s;o long concealed, nor would the wi&s;dom and &s;agacity of former ages have left the glory of this invention to an ob&s;cure Genoe&s;e pilot.</P>

<P>WHATEVER care was taken to &s;often the har&s;h|ne&s;h of this declaration, Columbus con&s;idered it as a final rejection of his propo&s;als.

Columbus was of this &s;an|guine temper. Though he felt deeply the cruel blow given to his hopes, and retired immediately from a court, where he had been amu&s;ed &s;o long with vain expectations, his confidence in the ju&s;t|ne&s;s of his own &s;y&s;tem did not dimini&s;h, and his impatience to demon&s;trate the truth of it by an actual experiment, became greater than ever.

He then laid before the king the propo&s;als, with which he had been entru&s;ted by his brother, and, notwith&s;tanding Henry's exce&s;&s;ive caution and par&s;imony, which rendered him aver&s;e to new or expen&s;ive undertakings, he received Co|lumbus's overtures, with more approbation, than any monarch to whom they had hitherto been pre|&s;ented.</P>

The negociation now went forward with facility and di&s;patch, and a treaty or capitulation with Columbus was &s;igned on the &s;eventeenth of April, one thou&s;and four hundred and ninety-two.

They
<PB N="114" REF="034476_0112_0FFDD5CE2590A748">
appointed Columbus their viceroy in all the i&s;lands and continents which he &s;hould di&s;cover; but if, for the better admini&s;tration of affairs, it &s;hould hereafter be nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;eparate go|vernor in any of tho&s;e countries, they authori&s;ed Columbus to name three per&s;ons, of whom they would choo&s;e one for that office; and the dignity of viceroy, with all its immunities, was likewi&s;e to be hereditary in the family of Columbus. 3. They granted to Columbus and his heirs for ever, the tenth of the free profits accruing from the pro|ductions and commerce of the countries which he &s;hould di&s;cover. 4. They declared, that if any controver&s;y or law-&s;uit &s;hall ari&s;e with re&s;pect to any mercantile tran&s;action in the countries which &s;hould be di&s;covered, it &s;hould be determined by the &s;ole authority of Columbus, or of judges to be appointed by him. 5.

<P>THOUGH the name of Ferdinand appears con|joined with that of I&s;abella in this tran&s;action, his di&s;tru&s;t of Columbus was &s;till &s;o violent that he refu&s;ed to take any part in the enterpri&s;e as king of Aragon.

reparation to Columbus for the time which he had lo&s;t in fruitle&s;s &s;olicitation. By the twelfth of May, all that depended upon her was adju&s;ted; and Co|lumbus waited on the king and queen, in order to receive their final in&s;tructions. Every thing re|&s;pecting the de&s;tination and conduct of the voyage, they committed implicitly to the di&s;po&s;al of his pru|dence. But that they might avoid giving any ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence to the king of Portugal, they &s;trictly enjoined him not to approach near to the Portugue&s;e &s;ettlements on the coa&s;t of Guinea, or in any of the other countries to which the Portu|gue&s;e claimed right as di&s;coverers. I&s;abella had ordered the &s;hips, of which Columbus was to take the command, to be fitted out in the port of Palos, a &s;mall maritime town in the Province of Anda|lu&s;ia. As the guardian Juan Perez, to whom Co|lumbus had already been &s;o much indebted, re&s;ided in the neighbourhood of this place, he, is by the influence of that good eccle&s;ia&s;tic, as well by his own connection with the inhabitants, not only rai&s;ed among them what he wanted of the &s;um that he was bound by treaty to advance, but engaged &s;e|veral of them to accompany him in the voyage. The chief of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociates were three brothers of the name of Pinzon, of con&s;iderable wealth, and of great experience in naval affairs, who were willing to hazard their lives and fortunes in the expedition.</P>
<P>BUT, after all the efforts of I&s;abella and Co|lumbus, the armament was not &s;uitable, either to the dignity of the nation by which it was equipped, or to the importance of the &s;ervice for which it was de&s;tined. It con&s;i&s;ted of three ve&s;&s;els. The large&s;t, a &s;hip of no con&s;iderable burden, was commanded by Columbus, as admiral, who gave it the name of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> out of re&s;pect for the ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin, whom he honoured with &s;ingular devotion.

Of the &s;econd, called the <HI>Pinta,</HI> Martin Pinzon was captain, and his brother Francis, pilot. The third, named the <HI>Nigna,</HI> was under the command of Vincent Yanez Pinzon. The&s;e two were light ve&s;&s;els, hardly &s;uperior in burden or force to large boats. This &s;quadron, if it merits that name, was victualled for twelve months, and had on board ninety men, mo&s;tly &s;ailors, together with a few adventurers who followed the fortune of Columbus, and &s;ome gentlemen of I&s;abella's court, whom &s;he appointed to accompany him. Though the ex|pence of the undertaking was one of the circum|&s;tances which chiefly alarmed the court of Spain, and retarded &s;o long the negociation with Co|lumbus, the &s;um employed in &s;itting out this &s;quad|ron did not exceed four thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>AS the art of &s;hip-building in the fifteenth cen|tury was extremely rude, and the bulk of ve&s;&s;els was accommodated to the &s;hort and ea&s;y voyages along the coa&s;t which they were accu&s;tomed to perform, it is a proof of the courage as well as en|terpri&s;ing genius of Columbus, that he ventured, with a fleet &s;o unfit for a di&s;tant navigation, to ex|plore unknown &s;eas, where he had no chart to guide him, no knowledge of the tides and currents, and no experience of the dangers to which he might be expo&s;ed. His eagerne&s;s to accompli&s;h the great de&s;ign which had &s;o long engro&s;&s;ed his thoughts, made him overlook or di&s;regard every circum&s;tance that would have intimidated a mind le&s;s adventurous. He pu&s;hed forward the prepa|rations with &s;uch ardour, and was &s;econded &s;o ef|fectually by the per&s;ons to whom I&s;abella committed the &s;uperintendance of this bu&s;ine&s;s, that every thing was &s;oon in readine&s;s for the voyage. But as Columbus was deeply impre&s;&s;ed with &s;entiments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> religion, he would not &s;et out upon an expedi|tion &s;o arduous, and of which one great object was

&s;eas. The fir&s;t day, as it was very calm, he made but little way; but on the &s;econd, he lo&s;t &s;ight of the Canaries; and many of the &s;ailors, de|jected already and di&s;mayed, when they contem|plated the boldne&s;s of the undertaking, began to beat their brea&s;ts, and to &s;hed tears, as if they were never more to behold land. Columbus comforted them with a&s;&s;urances of &s;ucce&s;s, and the pro&s;pect of va&s;t wealth, in tho&s;e opulent regions whither he was conducting them. This early di&s;covery of the &s;pirit of his follower, taught Columbus, that he mu&s;t prepare to &s;huggle, not only with the un|avoidable difficulties which might be expected from the nature of his undertaking, but with &s;uch as were likely to ari&s;e from the ignorance and ti|midity of the people under his command; and he perceived that the art of governing the minds of men, would be no le&s;s reqiu&s;ite for accompli&s;hing the di&s;coveries which he had in view, than naval &s;kill and undaunted courage. Happily for him&s;elf, and for the country by which he was employed, he joined to the ardent temper and inventive genius of a projector, virtues of another &s;pecies, which are rarely united with them. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a thorough knowledge of mankind, an in&s;inuating addre&s;s, a patient per&s;everance in executing any plan, the perfect government of his own pa&s;&s;ions, and the talent of acquiring an a&s;cendant over tho&s;e of other men. All the&s;e qualities, which formed him for command, were accompanied with that &s;uperior knowledge of his profe&s;&s;ion, which begets confi|dence in times of difficulty and danger.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vigilance and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of Columbus</NOTE> To un|&s;kilful Spani&s;h &s;ailors, accu&s;tomed only to coa&s;ting voyages in the Mediterranean, the maritime &s;cience of Columbus, the fruit of thirty years experience, improved by an acquaintance with all the inventions of the Portugue&s;e, appeared immen&s;e. As &s;oon as they put to &s;ea, he regulated every thing by his
<PB N="119" REF="034476_0117_0FFDD5DB2AD4C478">
&s;ole authority; he &s;uperintended the execution of every order; and allowing him&s;elf only a few hours for &s;leep, he was at all other times upon deck. As his cour&s;e lay through &s;eas which had not formerly been vi&s;ited, the founding-line, or in&s;truments for ob&s;ervation, were continually in his hands. After the example of the Portugue&s;e di&s;coverers, he attended to the motion of tides and currents, watching the flight of birds, the ap|pearance of fi&s;hes, of &s;ea-weeds, and of every thing that floated on the waves, and entered every occurrence, with a minute exactne&s;s, in the jour|nal which he kept. As the length of the voyage could not fail of alarming &s;ailors habituated only to &s;hort excur&s;ions, Columbus endeavoured to conceal from them the real progre&s;s which they made. With this view, though they run eighteen leagues on the &s;econd day after they left Gomera, he gave out that they had advanced only fifteen, and he uniformly employed the &s;ame artifice of reckoning &s;hort during the whole voyage. By the fourteenth of September, the fleet was above two hundred leagues to the we&s;t of the Canary I&s;les, at a greater di&s;tance from land than any Spaniard had been before that time.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> There they were &s;truck with an appearance no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing than new.

The example of the Portugue&s;e, as well as the &s;uper&s;tition of the age, made it nece&s;&s;ary to obtain from the Roman Pontiff a grant of tho&s;e territories which they wi&s;hed to occupy. The Pope, as the vicar and repre&s;enta|tive of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have a right of dominion over all the kingdoms of the earth. Alexander VI. a pontiff infamous for every crime which di&s;graces humanity, filled the papal throne at that time. As he was born Ferdinand's &s;ubject, and very &s;olicitous to &s;ecure the protection of Spain, in order to facilitate the execution of his ambitious &s;chemes in favour of his own family, he was ex|tremely willing to gratify the Spani&s;h monarchs.

and ignorant even of their exi&s;tence. As it was nece&s;&s;ary to prevent this grant from interfering with that formerly made to the crown of Por|tugal, he appointed that a line, &s;uppo&s;ed to be drawn from pole to pole, a hundred leagues to the we&s;t|ward of the Azores, &s;hould &s;erve as a limit be|tween them; and in the plenitude of his power, be&s;towed all to the ea&s;t of this imaginary line upon the Portugue&s;e, and all to the we&s;t of it, upon the Spaniards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 4.

The Spaniards had built a town, and &s;urrounded it with ramparts. They had erected &s;orts in different places. They had

enclo&s;ed and &s;own &s;everal fields. It was apparent that they came not to vi&s;it the country, but to &s;et|tle in it. Though the number of tho&s;e &s;trangers was incon&s;iderable, the &s;tate of cultivation among this rude people was &s;o imperfect, and in &s;uch exact proportion to their own con&s;umption, that it was with difficulty they could afford &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to their new gue&s;ts. Their own mode of life was &s;o indolent and inactive, the warmth of the climate &s;o enervating, the con&s;titution of their bodies naturally &s;o feeble, and &s;o unaccu&s;tomed to the laborious exertions of indu&s;try, that they were &s;atisfied with a proportion of food amazingly &s;mall. A handful of maize, or a little of the in&s;ipid bread made of the ca&s;&s;ada-root, was &s;ufficient to &s;upport men, who&s;e &s;trength and &s;pirits were not exhau&s;ted by any vigorous efforts either of body or mind. The Spaniards, though the mo&s;t ab&s;temious of all the European nations, appeared to them exce&s;&s;ively voracious. One Spaniard con&s;umed as much as &s;everal Indians. This keenne&s;s of appetite &s;urpri&s;ed them &s;o much, and &s;eemed to be &s;o infatiable, that they &s;uppo&s;ed the Spaniards had left their own country, becau&s;e it did not produce as much as was requi&s;ite to gra|tify their immoderate de&s;ire of food, and had come among them in que&s;t of nouri&s;hment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 17.</NOTE>.

Inflamed by the unprovoked outrages of the Spaniards, with a degree of rage of which their gentle natures, formed to &s;uffer and &s;ubmit, &s;eemed hardly &s;u&s;ceptible, they waited only for a &s;ignal from their leaders to fall upon the co|lony. Some of the caziques had already &s;urpri&s;ed and cut off &s;everal &s;tragglers. The dread of this impending danger united the Spaniards, and re|e&s;tabli&s;hed the authority of Columbus, as they &s;aw no pro&s;pect of &s;afety but in committing them&s;elves to his prudent guidance. It was now nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to arms, the employing of which again&s;t the Indians, Columbus had hitherto avoided with the greate&s;t &s;olicitude. Unequal as the con|flict may &s;eem, between the naked inhabitants of the New World, armed with clubs, &s;ticks hard|ened in the fire, wooden &s;words, and arrows pointed with bones or flints; and troops accu&s;tomed to the di&s;cipline, and provided with the in&s;truments of de&s;truction known in the European art of war, the &s;ituation of the Spaniards was far from being exempt from danger. The va&s;t &s;uperiority of the natives in number, compen&s;ated many defects. An hand|ful of men was about to encounter a whole nation. One adver&s;e event, or even any unfore&s;een delay in determining the fate of the war, might prove fatal to the Spaniards. Con&s;cious that &s;ucce&s;s de|pended on the vigour and rapidity of his operations, Columbus in&s;tantly a&s;&s;embled his forces. They were reduced to a very &s;mall number.

Now a plan was to be formed of a regular colony, that might &s;erve as a model in all future e&s;tabli&s;hments.

to &s;o many of their countrymen. Columbus pro|po&s;ed to tran&s;port to Hi&s;paniola &s;uch malefactors as had been convicted of crimes, which, though capital, were of a le&s;s atrocious nature; and that for the future a certain proportion of the offenders u&s;ually &s;ent to the gallies, &s;hould be condemned to labour in the mines which were to be opened. This advice, given without due reflection, was as incon&s;iderately adopted. The pri&s;ons of Spain were drained, in order to collect members for the intended colony; and the judges empowered to try criminals, were in&s;tructed to recruit it by their fu|ture &s;entences.

Self-condemnation and regret were not the only &s;entiments to which the &s;ucce&s;s of Columbus, and reflection upon their own imprudence in rejecting his propo&s;als, gave ri&s;e among the Portugue&s;e. They excited a general emulation to &s;urpa&s;s his performances, and an ardent de&s;ire to make &s;ome reparation to their country for their own error. With this view, Emanuel, who inherited the en|terpri&s;ing genius of his predece&s;&s;ors, per&s;i&s;ted in their grand &s;cheme of opening a pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, and &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, equipped a &s;qua|dron for that important voyage. He gave the command of it to Va&s;co de Gama, a man of noble birth, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtue, prudence, and courage, equal to the &s;tation. The &s;quadron, like all tho&s;e fitted out for di&s;covery in the infancy of naviga|tion, was extremely feeble, con&s;i&s;ting only of three ve&s;&s;els, of neither burden nor force adequate to the &s;ervice.

Throughout all the va&s;t countries which extend along the coa&s;t of Africa, from the river Senegal to the confines of Zan|guebar, the Portugue&s;e had found a race of men rude and uncultivated, &s;trangers to letters, to arts, and commerce, and differing from the inhabitants of Europe, no le&s;s in their features and complexion, than in their manners and in&s;titutions. As they advanced from this, they ob&s;erved, to their inex|pre&s;&s;ible joy, that the human form gradually al|tered and improved; the A&s;iatic features began to predominate, marks of civilization appeared, letters were known, the Mahometan religion was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and a commerce, far from being incon&s;i|derable, was carried on. At that time &s;everal ve&s;|&s;els from India were in the port of Melinda.

applied for them, and by relaxing the reins of di&s;|cipline and government, that the Spaniards, who were mo&s;tly adventurers, whom their indigence or crimes had impelled to abandon their native country, expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t indecent &s;atisfaction with the di&s;grace and impri&s;onment of Columbus. They flattered them&s;elves, that now they &s;hould enjoy an uncontrouled liberty, more &s;uitable to their di&s;po&s;ition and former habits of life. Among per&s;ons thus prepared to cen&s;ure the proceedings, and to a&s;per&s;e the character of Columbus, Bova|dilla collected materials for a charge again&s;t him. All accu&s;ations, the mo&s;t improbable, as well as incon&s;i&s;tent, were received. No informer, how|ever infamous, was rejected. The re&s;ult of this inque&s;t, no le&s;s indecent than partial, he tran&s;mit|ted to Spain. At the &s;ame time, he ordered Co|lumbus, with his two brothers to be carried thi|ther in fetters; and, adding cruelty to in&s;ult, he confined them in different &s;hips, and excluded them from the comfort of that friendly intercour&s;e which might have &s;oothed their common di&s;tre&s;s. But while the Spaniards in Hi&s;paniola viewed the arbitrary and in&s;olent proceedings of Bovadilla with a general approbation, which reflects di&s;|honour upon their name and country, one man &s;till retained a proper &s;en&s;e of the great actions which Columbus had performed, and was touched with the &s;entiments of veneration and pity due to his rank, his age, and his merit. Alon&s;o de Vallejo, the captain of the ve&s;&s;el on board which the ad|miral was confined, as &s;oon as he was clear of the i&s;land, approached his pri&s;oner with great re&s;pect, and offered to relea&s;e him from the fetters with which he was unju&s;tly loaded. "No," replied Columbus with a generous indignation, "I wear the&s;e irons in con&s;equence of an order from my &s;overeigns. They &s;hall find me as obedient to this

<P>FORTUNATELY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 23. Set at li|berty, but deprived of all autho|rity.</NOTE> the voyage to Spain was ex|tremely &s;hort.

A&s;hamed of their own con|duct, and eager not only to make &s;ome reparation for this injury, but to efface the &s;tain which it might fix upon their character, they in&s;tantly i&s;&s;ued orders to &s;et Columbus at liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 17.</NOTE> invited him to court, and remitted money to enable him to appear there in a manner &s;uitable to his rank.

He remained for &s;ome time &s;ilent; the various pa&s;&s;ions which agitated his mind &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his power of utter|ance. At length he recovered him&s;elf, and vin|dicated his conduct in a long di&s;cour&s;e, producing the mo&s;t &s;atisfying proofs of his own integrity, as well as good intention, and evidence, no le&s;s clear, of the malevolence of his enemies, who, not &s;atisfied with having ruined his fortune, labour|ed to deprive him of what alone was now left, his honour and his fame. Ferdinand received him

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He forms new &s;chemes of di&s;covery.</NOTE>BUT even this ungenerous return did not di&s;cou|rage him from pur&s;uing the great object which fir&s;t called forth his inventive genius, and excited him to attempt di&s;covery. To open a new pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies was his original and favourite &s;cheme. This &s;till engro&s;&s;ed his thoughts; and either from his own ob&s;ervations in his voyage to Paria, or from &s;ome ob&s;cure hint of the natives, or from the accounts given by Ba&s;tidas and de la Co&s;a, of their expedition, he conceived an opinion that, beyond the continent of America, there was a &s;ea which extended to the Ea&s;t-Indies, and hoped to find &s;ome &s;trait or narrow neck of land, by which a communication might be opened with it and the part of the ocean already known. By a very fortunate conjecture, he &s;uppo&s;ed this &s;trait or i&s;thmus to be &s;ituated near the gulph of Darien. Full of this idea, though he was now of an ad|vanced age, worn out with fatigue, and broken with infirmities, he offered, with the alacrity of a youthful adventurer, to undertake a voyage which would a&s;certain this important point, and perfect the grand &s;cheme which from the beginning he
<PB N="197" REF="034476_0195_0FFDD5A090A4B630">
propo&s;ed to accompli&s;h. Several circum&s;tances concurred in di&s;po&s;ing Ferdinand and I&s;abella to lend a favourable ear to this propo&s;al. They were glad to have the pretext of any honourable em|ployment for removing from court a man with who&s;e demands they deemed it impolitic to com|ply, and who&s;e &s;ervices it was indecent to neglect. Though unwilling to reward Columbus, they were not in&s;en&s;ible of his merit, and from their expe|rience of his &s;kill and conduct, had rea&s;on to give credit to his conjectures, and to confide in his &s;uc|ce&s;s. To the&s;e con&s;iderations, a third mu&s;t be added of &s;till more powerful influence. About this time the Portugue&s;e fleet, under Cabral, arrived from the Indies; and, by the richne&s;s of its cargo, gave the people of Europe a more perfect idea than they had hitherto been able to form, of the opulence and fertility of the ea&s;t. The Portugue&s;e had been more fortunate in their di&s;coveries than the Spa|niards. They had opened a communication with countries where indu&s;try, arts, and elegance flou|ri&s;hed; and where commerce had been longer e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and carried to greater extent, than in any region of the earth. Their fir&s;t voyages thither yielded immediate as well as va&s;t returns of profit, in commodities extremely precious and in great reque&s;t. Li&s;bon became immediately the &s;eat of commerce and wealth; while Spain had only the expectation of remote benefit, and of future gain, from the we&s;tern world. Nothing, then, could be more acceptable to the Spaniards than Columbus's offer to conduct them to the ea&s;t, by a route which he expected to be &s;horter, as well as le&s;s danger|ous, than that which the Portugue&s;e had taken. Even Ferdinand was rou&s;ed by &s;uch a pro&s;pect, and warmly approved of the undertaking.</P>

&s;mall barks, the large&s;t of which did not exceed &s;eventy tons in burden, for performing it. Ac|cu&s;tomed to brave danger, and to engage in arduous undertakings with inadequate force, he did not he|&s;itate to accept the command of this pitiful &s;qua|dron. His brother Bartholomew, and his &s;econd &s;on Ferdinand, the hi&s;torian of his actions, accom|panied him. He &s;ailed from Cadiz on the ninth of May, and touched, as u&s;ual, at the Canary i&s;lands; from thence he propo&s;ed to have &s;tood directly for the continent; but his large&s;t ve&s;&s;el was &s;o clum&s;y and unfit for &s;ervice, as con&s;trained him to bear away for Hi&s;paniola, in hopes of exchanging her for &s;ome &s;hip of the fleet that had carried out Ovando.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29.</NOTE> When he arrived at St. Domingo, he found eighteen of the&s;e &s;hips ready loaded, and on the point of departing for Spain. Columbus im|mediately acquainted the governor with the de&s;ti|nation of his voyage, and the accident which had obliged him to alter his route. He reque&s;ted per|mi&s;&s;ion to enter the harbour, not only that he might negociate the exchange of his &s;hip, but that he might take &s;helter during a violent hur|ricane, of which he di&s;cerned the approach from various progno&s;tics, which his experience and &s;a|gacity had taught him to ob&s;erve. On that ac|count, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">evi&s;ed him likewi&s;e to put off for &s;ome days the departure of the fleet bound for Spain.

night the hurricane came on with dreadful im|petuo&s;ity. Columbus, aware of the danger, took precautions again&s;t it, and &s;aved his little &s;quadron. The fleet de&s;tined for Spain met with the fate which the ra&s;hne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy of its commanders de&s;erved. Of eighteen &s;hips, two or three only e&s;caped. In this general wreck pe|ri&s;hed Bovadilla, Roldan, and the greater part of tho&s;e who had been the mo&s;t active in per&s;ecuting Columbus and oppre&s;&s;ing the Indians. Together with them&s;elves, all the wealth which they had acquired by their inju&s;tice and cruelty was &s;wal|lowed up. It exceeded in value two hundred thou&s;and <HI>pe&s;os;</HI> an immen&s;e &s;um at that period, and &s;ufficient not only to have &s;creened them from any &s;evere &s;crutiny into their conduct, but to have &s;ecured them a gracious reception in the Spani&s;h court. Among the &s;hips that e&s;caped, one had on board all the effects of Columbus, which had been recovered from the ruins of his fortune. Hi&s;to|rians, &s;truck with the exact di&s;crimination of cha|racters, as well as the ju&s;t di&s;tribution of rewards and puni&s;hments, con&s;picuous in tho&s;e events, uni|ver&s;ally attribute them to an immediate interpo|&s;ition of divine Providence, in order to avenge the wrongs of an injured man, and to puni&s;h the op|pre&s;&s;ors of an innocent people. Upon the igno|rant and &s;uper&s;titious race of men, who were wit|ne&s;&s;es of this occurrence, it made a different im|pre&s;&s;ion. From an opinion which vulgar admi|ration is apt to entertain with re&s;pect to per&s;ons who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their &s;agacity and inventions, they believed Columbus to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;upernatural powers, and imagined that he had conjured up this dreadful &s;torm by magical art and incantations, in order to be avenged of his enemies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oviedo, lib. iii. c. 7.9.

mea&s;ure of his calamities &s;eemed now to be full. He was ca&s;t a&s;hore upon an i&s;land at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the only &s;ettlement of the Spaniards in America. His &s;hips were ruined beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of being repaired. To convey an ac|count of his &s;ituation to Hi&s;paniola, appeared im|practicable; and without this it was vain to expect relief. His genius, fertile in re&s;ources, and mo&s;t vigorous in tho&s;e perilous extremities when feeble minds abandon them&s;elves to de&s;pair, di&s;covered the only expedient which afforded any pro&s;pect of deliverance. He had recour&s;e to the ho&s;pitable kindne&s;s of the natives, who con&s;idering the Spa|niards as beings of a &s;uperior nature, were eager, on every occa&s;ion, to mini&s;ter to their wants. From them he obtained two of their canoes, each formed out of the trunk of a &s;ingle tree hollowed with fire, and &s;o mi&s;-&s;hapen and aukward as hardly to merit the name of boats. In the&s;e, which were fit only for creeping along the coa&s;t, or cro&s;&s;ing from one &s;ide of a bay to another, Mendez, a Spaniard, and Fie&s;chi, a Genoe&s;e, two gentlemen particularly at|tached to Columbus, gallantly offered to &s;et out for Hi&s;paniola, upon a voyage of above thirty leagues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oviedo, lib. iii. c. 9.</NOTE>. This they accompli&s;hed in ten days, after &s;urmounting incredible dangers, and enduring &s;uch fatigues, that &s;everal of the Indians who ac|companied them &s;unk under it, and died. The attention paid to them by the governor of Hi&s;pa|niola was neither &s;uch as their courage merited, nor the di&s;tre&s;s of the per&s;ons from whom they came required. Ovando, from a mean jealou&s;y of Columbus, was afraid of allowing him to &s;et foot in the i&s;land under his government. This ungene|rous pa&s;&s;ion hardened his heart again&s;t every tender &s;entiment, which reflection upon the &s;ervices and

Their la&s;t re&s;ource had failed, and nothing remained but the pro&s;pect of ending their mi&s;erable days among naked &s;avages, far from their country and their friends. The &s;eamen, in a tran&s;port of rage, ro&s;e in open mutiny, threatened the life of Columbus, whom they reproached as the author of all their calamities, &s;eized ten canoes, which he had pur|cha&s;ed from the Indians, and de&s;pi&s;ing his remon|&s;trances and entreaties, made off with them to a di&s;tant part of the i&s;land. At the &s;ame time the natives murmured at the long re&s;idence of the Spa|niards in their country. As their indu&s;try was not greater than that of their neighbours in Hi&s;paniola, like them they found the burden of &s;upporting &s;o many &s;trangers to be altogether intolerable. They began to bring in provi&s;ions with reluctance, they furni&s;hed them with a &s;paring hand, and threatened to withdraw tho&s;e &s;upplies altogether.

of the Indians; and unle&s;s they could revive the admiration and reverence with which that &s;im|ple people had at fir&s;t beheld them, de&s;truction was unavoidable. Though the licentious proceedings of the mutineers had, in a great mea&s;ure, ef|faced tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions which had been &s;o fa|vourable to the Spaniards, the ingenuity of Co|lumbus &s;ugge&s;ted a happy artifice, that not only re&s;tored but heightened the high opinion which the Indians had originally entertained of them. By his &s;kill in a&s;tronomy he knew that there was &s;hortly to be a total eclip&s;e of the moon. He a&s;&s;embled all the principal per&s;ons of the di&s;trict around him on the day before it happened, and, after reproaching them for their &s;icklene&s;s in with|drawing their affection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from men whom they had lately revered, he told them, that the Spaniards were &s;ervants of the Great Spirit who dwells in heaven, who made and governs the world; that he, offended at their refu&s;ing to &s;upport men who were the objects of his peculiar favour, was preparing to puni&s;h this crime with exemplary &s;everity, and that very night the moon &s;hould withhold her light, and appear of a bloody hue, as a &s;ign of the divine wrath, and an emblem of the vengeance ready to fall upon them. To this mar|vellous prediction &s;ome of them li&s;tened with the carele&s;s indifference peculiar to the people of Ame|rica; others, with the credulous a&s;toni&s;hment na|tural to barbarians. But when the moon began gradually to be darkened, and at length appeared of a red colour, all were &s;truck with terror. They ran with con&s;ternation to their hou&s;es, and return|ing in&s;tantly to Columbus loaded with provi&s;ions, threw them at his feet, conjuring him to intercede with the Great Spirit to avert the de&s;truction with which they were threatened.

all their hopes died away. Columbus alone, though he felt mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly this wanton in&s;ult which Ovando added to his pa&s;t neglect, retained &s;uch compo&s;ure of mind, as to be able to cheer his followers.

<P>WITHOUT this confidence, he could not have re&s;i&s;ted the mutineers, who were now at hand. All his endeavours to reclaim the&s;e de&s;perate men had no effect but to increa&s;e their frenzy.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1504. State of the colony in Hi&s;paniola.</NOTE>WHILE Columbus was employed in his la&s;t voyage, &s;everal events worthy of notice happened in Hi&s;paniola. The colony there, the parent and nur&s;e of all the &s;ub&s;equent e&s;tabli&s;hments of Spain in the New World, gradually acquired the form of a regular and pro&s;perous &s;ociety. The humane &s;olicitude of I&s;abella to protect the Indians from oppre&s;&s;ion, and particularly the proclamation, by which the Spaniards were prohibited to compel them to work, retarded, it is true, for &s;ome time, the progre&s;s of improvement. The natives, who con&s;idered exemption from toil as &s;upreme felicity, &s;corned every allurement and reward by which they were invited to labour. The Spaniards had not a &s;ufficient number of hands either to work the mines or to cultivate the &s;oil. Several of the fir&s;t coloni&s;ts, who had been accu&s;tomed to the &s;ervice of the Indians, quitted the i&s;land, when deprived of tho&s;e in&s;truments, without which they knew not how to carry on any operation. Many of the new &s;ettlers who came over with Ovando, were &s;eized with the di&s;tempers peculiar to the climate, and in a &s;hort &s;pace above a thou&s;and of them died. At

the &s;ame time, the exacting one half of the product of the mines as the royal &s;hare, was found to be a demand &s;o exorbitant, that no adventurers would engage to work them upon &s;uch terms. In order to &s;ave the colony from ruin, Ovando ventured to relax the rigour of the royal edicts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1505.</NOTE> He made a new di&s;tribution of the Indians among the Spaniards, and compelled them to labour, for a &s;tated time, in digging the mines, or in cultivating the ground; but, in order to &s;creen him&s;elf from the imputation of having &s;ubjected them again to &s;ervitude, he en|joined their ma&s;ters to pay them a certain &s;um, as the price of their work. He reduced the royal &s;hare of the gold found in the mines from the half to the third part, and &s;oon after lowered it to a fifth, at which it long remained. Notwith&s;tanding I&s;a|bella's tender concern for the good treatment of the Indians, and Ferdinand's eagerne&s;s to improve the royal revenue, Ovando per&s;uaded the court to approve of both the&s;e regulations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. v. c. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the Indians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with the Indians.</NOTE> after enjoying re&s;pite from oppre&s;&s;ion, though during a &s;hort interval, now felt the yoke of bondage to be &s;o galling, that they made &s;everal attempts to vindicate their own li|berty. This the Spaniards con&s;idered as rebellion, and took arms in order to reduce them to &s;ubjec|tion. When war is carried on between nations who&s;e &s;tate of improvement is in any degree &s;imi|lar, the means of defence bear &s;ome proportion to tho&s;e employed in the attack; and in this equal conte&s;t &s;uch efforts mu&s;t be made, &s;uch talents are di&s;played, and &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions rou&s;ed, as exhibit mankind to view in a &s;ituation no le&s;s &s;triking than intere&s;ting. It is one of the noble&s;t functions of hi&s;tory, to ob&s;erve and to delineate men at a junc|ture when their minds are mo&s;t violently agitated,
<PB N="212" REF="034476_0210_0FFDD648AE8CD6F0">
and all their powers and pa&s;&s;ions are called forth. Hence the operations of war, and the &s;truggles between contending &s;tates, have been deemed by hi&s;torians, ancient as well as modern, a capital and important article in the annals of human actions. But in a conte&s;t between naked &s;avages, and one of the mo&s;t warlike of the European nations, where &s;cience, courage, and di&s;cipline on one &s;ide, were op|po&s;ed by ignorance, timidity, and di&s;order on the other, a particular detail of events would be as un|plea&s;ant as unin&s;tructive. If the &s;implicity and inno|cence of the Indians had in&s;pired the Spaniards with humanity, had &s;oftened the pride of &s;uperiority into compa&s;&s;ion, and had induced them to improve the inhabitants of the New World, in&s;tead of oppre&s;|&s;ing them, &s;ome &s;udden acts of violence, like the too rigorous cha&s;ti&s;ements of impatient in&s;tructors, might have been related without horror. But, un|fortunately, this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uperiority ope|rated in a different manner. The Spaniards were advanced &s;o far beyond the natives of America in improvement of every kind, that they viewed them with contempt. They conceived the Americans to be animals of an inferior nature, who were not in|titled to the rights and privileges of men. In peace, they &s;ubjected them to &s;ervitude. In war, they paid no regard to tho&s;e laws, which, by a tacit convention between contending nations, regulate ho&s;tility, and &s;et &s;ome bounds to its rage. They con&s;idered them not as men fighting in defence of their liberty, but as &s;laves, who had revolted again&s;t their ma&s;ters. Their caziques, when taken, were condemned, like the leaders of banditti, to the mo&s;t cruel and ignominious puni&s;hments; and all their &s;ubjects, without regarding the di&s;tinction of ranks e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, were reduced to the &s;ame &s;tate of abject &s;lavery. With &s;uch a &s;pirit and &s;entiments were ho&s;tilities carried on again&s;t

the cazique of Higuey, a province at the ea&s;tern extremity of the i&s;land. This war was occa&s;ioned by the perfidy of the Spaniards, in violating a treaty which they had made with the natives, and it was terminated by hanging up the cazique, who defended his people with bravery &s;o far &s;uperior to that of his countrymen, as intitled him to a better fate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vi. c. 9, 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE conduct of Ovando,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cruel and trea|cherous conduct of Ovando.</NOTE> in another part of the i&s;land, was &s;till more treacherous and cruel. The province anciently named Xaragua, which extends from the fertile plain where Leogane is now &s;ituated, to the we&s;tern extremity of the i&s;land, was &s;ubject to a female cazique, named Anacoana, highly re|&s;pected by the natives. She, from that partial fondne&s;s with which the women of America were attached to the Europeans, (the cau&s;e of which &s;hall be afterwards explained,) had always courted the friend&s;hip of the Spaniards, and loaded them with benefits. But &s;ome of the adherents of Rol|dan having &s;ettled in her country, were &s;o much exa&s;perated at her endeavouring to re&s;train their exce&s;&s;es, that they accu&s;ed her of having formed a plan to throw off the yoke, and to exterminate the Spaniards. Ovando, though he knew well what little credit was due to &s;uch profligate men, marched, without further inquiry, towards Xara|gua, with three hundred foot and &s;eventy hor&s;e|men. To prevent the Indians from taking alarm at this ho&s;tile appearance, he gave out that his &s;ole intention was to vi&s;it Anacoana, to whom his countrymen had been &s;o much indebted, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner, and to regulate with her the mode of levying the tribute payable to the king of Spain.

There he was fea&s;ted for &s;ome days, with all the kindne&s;s of &s;imple ho&s;pitality, and amu&s;ed with the games and &s;pectacles u&s;ual among the Americans upon occa&s;ions of mirth and fe&s;tivity. But, amid&s;t the &s;ecurity which this in&s;pired, Ovando was me|ditating the de&s;truction of his un&s;u&s;picious enter|tainer and her &s;ubjects; and the mean perfidy with which he executed this &s;cheme, equalled his bar|barity in forming it. Under colour of exhibiting to the Indians the parade of an European tourna|ment, he advanced with his troops, in battle array, towards the hou&s;e in which Anacoana and the chiefs who attended her were a&s;&s;embled. The infantry took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the avenues which led to the village. The hor&s;emen encompa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e.

This implacable enmity of the na|tives, though it rendered an attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;ettlement in their country extremely difficult as well as dangerous, might have been &s;urmounted at length by the per&s;everance of the Spaniards, by the &s;uperiority of their arms, and their &s;kill in the art of war.

to prevent the Spaniards from &s;topping &s;hort in their career. But circum&s;tances peculiar to Hi&s;|paniola at this juncture, concurred with it in ex|tending their navigation and conque&s;ts. The ri|gorous treatment of the inhabitants of that i&s;land, having almo&s;t extirpated the race, many of the Spani&s;h planters, as I have already ob&s;erved, find|ing it impo&s;&s;ible to carry on their works with the &s;ame vigour and profit, were obliged to look out for &s;ettlements in &s;ome country where people were not yet wa&s;ted by oppre&s;&s;ion.

Three hundred men were deemed &s;ufficient for the conque&s;t of an i&s;land of above &s;even hundred miles in length, and filled with in|habitants. But they were of the &s;ame unwarlike character with the people of Hi&s;paniola. They were not only intimidated by the appearance of their new enemies, but unprepared to re&s;i&s;t them.

The only ob&s;truction the Spaniards met with was from Hatuey, a cazique, who had fled from Hi&s;pa|niola, and had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ea&s;tern extre|mity of Cuba. He &s;tood upon the defen&s;ive at their fir&s;t landing, and endeavoured to drive them back to their &s;hips.

<P>IT was not merely the pa&s;&s;ion of &s;earching for new countries that prompted Ponce de Leon to undertake this voyage; he was influenced by one of tho&s;e vi&s;ionary ideas, which at that time often mingled with the &s;pirit of di&s;covery, and rendered it more active. A tradition prevailed among the natives of Puerto Rico, that in the i&s;le of Bimini, one of the Lucayos, there was a fountain of &s;uch wonderful virtue as to renew the youth, and recal the vigour of every per&s;on who bathed in its &s;alu|tary waters. In hopes of finding this grand re&s;to|rative, Ponce de Leon and his followers ranged through the i&s;lands, &s;earching, with fruitle&s;s &s;olici|tude and labour for the fountain, which was the chief object of their expedition.

appears in the pre&s;ent age, altogether in|credible. The fact, however, is certain; and the mo&s;t authentic Spani&s;h hi&s;torians mention this ex|travagant &s;ally of their credulous countrymen. The Spaniards, at that period, were engaged in a career of activity which gave a romantic turn to their imagination, and daily pre&s;ented to them &s;trange and marvellous objects.

however, that he could not expect &s;ucce&s;s from the patronage of Ferdinand's mini&s;ters, with whom he was unconnected, or from negociating in a court to the arts of which he was a &s;tranger, he endeavoured to merit the dignity to which he a&s;pired, and aimed at performing &s;ome &s;ignal &s;er|vice that would &s;ecure him the preference to every competitor. Full of this idea, he made frequent inroads into the adjacent country, &s;ubdued &s;everal of the caziques, and collected a con&s;iderable quan|tity of gold, which abounded more in that part of the continent than in the i&s;lands. In one of tho&s;e excur&s;ions, the Spaniards contended with &s;uch eagerne&s;s about the divi&s;ion of &s;ome gold, that they were at the point of proceeding to acts of vio|lence again&s;t one another. A young cazique, who was pre&s;ent, a&s;toni&s;hed at the high value which they &s;et upon a thing of which he did not di&s;cern the u&s;e, tumbled the gold out of the balance with indignation; and, turning to the Spaniards, "Why do you quarrel (&s;ays he) about &s;uch a trifle?

Ferdinand was &s;o intent upon opening a communi|cation with the Molucca or Spice I&s;lands by the we&s;t, that, in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and fifteen, he fitted out two &s;hips at his own ex|pence, in order to attempt &s;uch a voyage, and gave the command of them to Juan Diaz de Solis, who was deemed one of the mo&s;t &s;kilful navigators in Spain.

The &s;uperintendants, with their a&s;&s;o|ciate Zuazo, and Las Ca&s;as, &s;ailed for St. Domingo.

This, together with the information which had been received from Spain concerning the object of the commi&s;&s;ion, &s;pread a general alarm. The coloni&s;ts concluded that they were to be deprived at once of the hands with which they carried on their labour, and that, of con&s;equence, ruin was unavoidable. But the fa|thers of St. Jerome proceeded with &s;uch caution and prudence, as &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated all their fears.

They plainly per|ceived that the Spaniards &s;ettled in America were &s;o few in number, that they could neither work the mines which had been opened, nor cultivate the

country; that they depended for effecting both, upon the labour of the natives, and if deprived of it, they mu&s;t in&s;tantly relinqui&s;h their conque&s;ts, or give up all the advantages which they derived from them; that no allurement was &s;o powerful as to &s;urmount the natural aver&s;ion of the Indians to any laborious effort, and that nothing but the au|thority of a ma&s;ter could compel them to work; and if they were not kept con&s;tantly under the eye and di&s;cipline of a &s;uperior, &s;o great was their na|tural li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and indifference, that they would neither attend to religious in&s;truction, nor ob&s;erve tho&s;e rites of Chri&s;tianity which they had been al|ready taught. Upon all tho&s;e accounts, the &s;uper|intendants found it nece&s;&s;ary to tolerate the repar|timientos, and to &s;uffer the Indians to remain under &s;ubjection to their Spani&s;h ma&s;ters. They u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours, however, to prevent the fatal effects of this e&s;tabli&s;hment, and to &s;ecure to the Indians the con&s;olation of the be&s;t treatment compatible with a &s;tate of &s;ervitude. For this pur|po&s;e, they revived former regulations, they pre|&s;cribed new ones, they neglected no circum&s;tance that tended to mitigate the rigour of the yoke; and by their authority, their example and their exhortations, they laboured to in&s;pire their coun|trymen with &s;entiments of equity and gentlene&s;s towards the unhappy people upon who&s;e indu&s;try they depended. Zuazo, in his department, &s;e|conded the endeavours of the &s;uperintendants.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Favourably received.</NOTE>BUT to the bi&s;hop of Burgos and the council of the Indies this project appeared not only chime|rical, but dangerous in a high degree. They deemed the faculties of the Americans to be natu|rally &s;o limited, and their indolence &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that every attempt to in&s;truct or to improve them would be fruitle&s;s. They contended that it would be extremely imprudent to give the command of a country extending above a thou&s;and miles along the coa&s;t, to a fanciful pre&s;umptuous enthu&s;ia&s;t, a &s;tranger to the affairs of the world, and unac|quainted with the arts of government. Las Ca&s;as, far from being di&s;couraged with a repul&s;e, which he had rea&s;on to expect, had recour&s;e once more to the Flemi&s;h favourites, who zealou&s;ly patronized his &s;cheme, merely becau&s;e it had been rejected by the Spani&s;h mini&s;ters. They prevailed with their ma&s;ter, who had lately been rai&s;ed to the Imperial dignity, to refer the con&s;ideration of this mea&s;ure to a &s;elect number of his privy-coun&s;ellors; and Las Ca&s;as having excepted again&s;t the members of the coun&s;el of the Indies, as partial and intere&s;ted, they were all excluded.

<P>THIS determination did not pa&s;s uncen&s;ured.

The emperor appeared with extraordinary pomp, and took his &s;eat on a throne in the great hall of the palace. His principal courtiers attended. Don Diego Columbus admiral of the Indies, was &s;um|moned to be pre&s;ent. The bi&s;hop of Darien was called upon fir&s;t to deliver his opinion. He, in a &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e, lamented the fatal de&s;olautin of America, by the extinction of &s;o many of its in|habitants; he acknowledged that this mu&s;t be im|puted, in &s;ome degree, to the exce&s;&s;ive rigour and incon&s;iderate proceedings of the Spaniards; but declared, that all the people of the New World, whom he had &s;een either in the continent or in the i&s;lands, appeared to him to be a race of men marked out, by the inferiority of their talents, for &s;ervitude, and whom it would be impo&s;&s;ible to in&s;truct or improve, unle&s;s they were kept under the continual in&s;pection of a ma&s;ter. Las Ca&s;as, at greater length, and with more fervour, defended his own &s;y&s;tem. He rejected with indignation the idea that any race of men was born to &s;ervitude, as irreligious and inhuman. He a&s;&s;erted, that the faculties of the Americans were not naturally de&s;pi|cable, but unimproved; that they were capable of receiving in&s;truction, in the principles of religion, as well as of acquiring the indu&s;try and arts which would qualify them for the various offices of &s;ocial life; that the mildne&s;s and timidity of their nature rendered them &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and docile, that they might be led and formed with a gentle hand. He profe&s;&s;ed, that his intentions in propo&s;ing the &s;cheme now under con&s;ideration were pure and di&s;|intere&s;ted; and though, from the accompli&s;hment of his de&s;igns, ine&s;timable benefits would re&s;ult to the crown of Ca&s;tile, he never had claimed, nor ever would receive, any recompence on that account.</P>

From many concur|ring cau&s;es, the reception which Las Ca&s;as met with in Hi&s;paniola was very unfavourable. In his negociations for the relief of the Indians, he had cen&s;ured the conduct of his countrymen &s;ettled there with &s;uch hone&s;t &s;everity as rendered him uni|ver&s;ally odious to them.

But that people, accu&s;tomed to a mode of life extremely different from that which takes place wherever civilization has made any con|&s;iderable progre&s;s, were incapable of a&s;&s;uming new habits at once.

Under his prudent admini&s;tration, Cuba became one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing of the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements.

As Cuba lay to the we&s;t of all the i&s;lands occupied by the Spaniards, and as the ocean, which &s;tretches beyond it towards that quarter, had not hitherto been explored, the&s;e circum&s;tances na|turally invited the inhabitants to attempt new di&s;co|veries.

Though they had carried on little commercial in|tercour&s;e with the natives, they had brought off &s;ome ornaments of gold, not con&s;iderable in value, but of &s;ingular fabric. The&s;e circum&s;tances, rela|ted with the exaggeration natural to men de&s;irous of heightening the merit of their own exploits, were more than &s;ufficient to excite romantic hopes and expectations.

Two hundred and forty volunteers, among whom were &s;everal per&s;ons of rank and fortune, embarked in this enterpri&s;e. The command of it was given to Juan de Grijalva, a young man of known merit and courage, with in&s;tructions to ob&s;erve attentively the nature of the countries which he &s;hould di&s;cover, to barter for gold, and, if circum&s;tances were inviting, to &s;ettle a colony in &s;ome proper &s;tation.

The de&s;ire of avenging their country|men who had been &s;lain there, concurred with their ideas of good policy, in prompting them to land, that they might cha&s;ti&s;e the Indians of that di&s;trict with &s;uch exemplary rigour, as would &s;trike terror into all the people around them. But though they di&s;embarked all their troops, and carried a&s;hore &s;ome field pieces, the Indians fought with &s;uch courage, that the Spaniards gained the victory with difficulty, and were confirmed in their opinion that the inhabitants of this country would prove more formidable enemies than any they had met with in other parts of America. From Poton|chan, they continued their voyage towards the we&s;t, keeping as near as po&s;&s;ible to the &s;hore, and ca&s;ting anchor every evening, from dread of the dangerous accidents to which they might be expo&s;ed in an unknown &s;ea.

When, like Europe, a continent is opened by inlets of the ocean of great extent, &s;uch as the Mediterranean and Baltic; or when, like A&s;ia, its coa&s;t is broken by deep bays advancing far into the country, &s;uch as the Black Sea, the gulfs of Arabia, of Per&s;ia, of Bengal, of Siam, and of Leotang; when the &s;urrounding &s;eas are filled with large and fertile i&s;lands, and the conti|nent it&s;elf watered with a variety of navigable rivers, tho&s;e regions may be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s what|ever can facilitate the progre&s;s of their inhabitants in commerce and improvement. In all the&s;e re|&s;pects America may bear a compari&s;on with the other quarters of the globe.

then of pre&s;uming from this &s;imilarity, that there is an affinity between them, we &s;hould only con|clude, that the di&s;po&s;ition and manners of men are formed by their &s;ituation, and ari&s;e from the &s;tate of &s;ociety in which they live. The moment that be|gins to vary, the character of a people mu&s;t change. In proportion as it advances in improvement, their manners refine, their powers and talents are called forth. In every part of the earth the progre&s;s of man hath been nearly the &s;ame, and we can trace him in his career from the rude &s;implicity of &s;avage life, until he attains the indu&s;try, the arts, and the elegance of poli&s;hed &s;ociety. There is nothing wonderful then in the &s;imilitude between the Ame|ricans and the barbarous nations of our continent. Had Lafitau, Garcia, and many other authors, at|tended to this, they would not have perplexed a &s;ubject which they pretend to illu&s;trate, by their fruitle&s;s endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h an affinity between various races of people in the old and new conti|nents, upon no other evidence than &s;uch a re&s;em|blance in their manners as nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;es from the &s;imilarity of their condition. There are, it is true, among every people, &s;ome cu&s;toms, which, as they do not flow from any natural want or de&s;ire peculiar to their &s;ituation, may be denominated u&s;ages of arbitrary in&s;titution. If between two na|tions &s;ettled in remote parts of the earth, a perfect agreement with re&s;pect to any of the&s;e &s;hould be di&s;covered, one might be led to &s;u&s;pect that they were connected by &s;ome affinity. If, for example, a nation were found in America that con&s;ecrated the &s;eventh day to religious wor&s;hip and re&s;t, we might ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e that it had derived its know|ledge of this u&s;age, which is of arbitrary in&s;titution, from the Jews. But, if it were di&s;covered that another nation celebrated the fir&s;t appearance of every new moon with extraordinary demon&s;trations

of joy, we &s;hould not be entitled to conclude that the ob&s;ervation of this monthly fe&s;tival was bor|rowed from the Jews, but ought to con&s;ider it merely as the expre&s;&s;ion of that joy which is na|tural to man on the return of the planet which guides and cheers him in the night. The in|&s;tances of cu&s;toms, merely arbitrary, common to the inhabitants of both hemi&s;pheres, are, indeed, &s;o few and &s;o equivocal, that no theory concerning the population of the New World ought to be founded upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3.

When the religious opinions of any people are neither the re&s;ult of rational inquiry, nor derived from the in&s;tructions of revelation, they mu&s;t needs be wild and extravagant. Barbarous nations are incapable of the former, and have not been ble&s;&s;ed with the advantages ari&s;ing from the latter. Still, however, the human mind, even where its opera|tions appear mo&s;t wild and capricious, holds a cour&s;e &s;o regular, that in every age and country the dominion of particular pa&s;&s;ions will be attended with &s;imilar effects. The &s;avage of Europe or America, when filled with &s;uper&s;titious dread of invi&s;ible beings, or with inqui&s;itive &s;olicitude to penetrate into the events of futurity, trembles alike with fear, or glows with impatience. He has re|cour&s;e to rites and practices of the &s;ame kind, in order to avert the vengeance which he &s;uppo&s;es to be impending over him, or to divine the &s;ecret which is the object of his curio&s;ity. Accordingly, the ritual of &s;uper&s;tition, in one continent, &s;eems, in many particulars, to be a tran&s;cript of that e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the other, and both authori&s;e &s;imilar in|&s;titutions, &s;ometimes &s;o frivolous as to excite pity,

But without &s;uppo&s;ing any con&s;anguinity between &s;uch di&s;tant nations, or imagining that their religious ceremonies were conveyed by tradition from the one to the other, we may a&s;cribe this uniformity, which in many in&s;tances &s;eems very amazing, to the natural operation of &s;uper&s;tition and enthu&s;ia&s;m upon the weake&s;t of the human mind.</P>

<P N="5">5.

north-ea&s;t of A&s;ia, there &s;eems to be good rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing that the progenitors of all the Ame|rican nations, from Cape Horn to the &s;outhern confines of Labrador, migrated from the latter ra|ther than the former. The E&s;quimaux are the only people in America, who, in their a&s;pect or character, bear any re&s;emblance to the northern Europeans. They are manife&s;tly a race of men, di&s;tinct from all the nations of the American con|tinent, in language, in di&s;po&s;ition, and in habits of life. Their original then, may warrantably be traced up to that &s;ource, which I have pointed out. But, among all the other inhabitants of America, there is &s;uch a &s;triking &s;imilitude in the form of their bodies, and the qualities of their minds, that, not|with&s;tanding the diver&s;ities occa&s;ioned by the influ|ence of climate, or unequal progre&s;s in improve|ment, we mu&s;t pronounce them to be de&s;cended from one &s;ource. There may be a variety in the &s;hades, but we can every where trace the &s;ame ori|ginal colour. Each tribe has &s;omething peculiar which di&s;tingui&s;hes it, but in all of them we di&s;cern certain features common to the whole race. It is remarkable, that in every peculiarity, whether in their per&s;ons or di&s;po&s;itions, which characteri&s;e the Americans, they have &s;ome re&s;emblance to the rude tribes &s;cattered over the north-ea&s;t of A&s;ia, but almo&s;t none to the nations &s;ettled in the north|ern extremities of Europe. We may, therefore, refer them to the former origin, and conclude that their A&s;iatic progenitors, having &s;ettled in tho&s;e parts of America, where the Ru&s;&s;ians have di&s;co|vered the proximity of the two continents, &s;pread gradually over its various regions. This account of the progre&s;s of population in America, coincides with the traditions of the Mexicans concerning their own origin, which, imperfect as they are, were pre&s;erved with more accuracy, and merit greater

In all tho&s;e regions of the earth with which they were well acquainted, civil &s;ociety had made con&s;iderable advances, and nations had fini&s;h|ed a good part of their career before they began to ob&s;erve them.

The climate and &s;oil of America differ, in &s;o many re&s;pects, from tho&s;e of the other hemi&s;phere, and this differ|ence is &s;o obvious and &s;triking, that philo&s;ophers of great eminence have laid hold on this as &s;uffi|cient to account for what is peculiar in the con&s;ti|tution of its inhabitants.

nor can they attain their proper &s;trength. The na|tives of Chili and of North-America, the two tem|perate regions in the New World, who live by hunting, may be deemed an active and vigorous race, when compared with the inhabitants of the i&s;les, or of tho&s;e parts of the continent where hardly any labour is requi&s;ite to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The exertions of a hunter are not, however, &s;o regular, or &s;o continued, as tho&s;e of per&s;ons employed in the culture of the earth, or in the various arts of civilized life, and though his agility may be greater than theirs, his &s;trength is on the whole inferior.

Among per&s;ons of inferior order, who are doomed by their con|dition to ince&s;&s;ant toil, the dominion of this pa&s;|&s;ion is le&s;s violent; their &s;olicitude to procure &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence, and to provide for the fir&s;t demand of na|ture, leaves little lei&s;ure for attending to its &s;econd call. But if the nature of the intercour&s;e between the &s;exes varies &s;o much in per&s;ons of different rank in poli&s;hed &s;ocieties, the condition of man, while he remains uncivilized, mu&s;t occa&s;ion a va|riation &s;till more apparent.

In what part or membrane of the body that hu|mour re&s;ides which tinges the complexion of the negro with a deep black, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of ana|tomi&s;ts to enquire and de&s;cribe.

All Europe, a great part of A&s;ia, and the temperate countries of Africa, are inhabited by men of a white complexion. All the torrid zone in Africa, &s;ome of the warmer regions adjacent to it, and &s;everal countries in A&s;ia, are filled with people of a deep black colour. If we &s;urvey the nations of our continent, making our progre&s;s from cold and temperate countries towards tho&s;e parts which are expo&s;ed to the influence of vehe|ment and unremitting heat, we &s;hall find, that the extreme whitene&s;s of their &s;kin &s;oon begins to di|mini&s;h; that its colour deepens gradually as we advance; and after pa&s;&s;ing through all the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive gradations of &s;hade, terminates in an uni|form unvarying black.

In the &s;implicity of the &s;avage &s;tate, when man is not oppre&s;&s;ed with labour or enervated by luxury, or di&s;quieted with care, we are apt to imagine that his life will flow on almo&s;t untroubled by di&s;ea&s;e or &s;uffering, until his days be terminated, in extreme old age, by the gradual decays of nature. We find, accordingly, among the Americans, as well as among other rude people, per&s;ons, who&s;e decrepit and &s;hrivelled form &s;eems to indicate an extraordinary length of life. But as mo&s;t of them are unacquainted with the art of numbering, and all of them as forgetful of what is pa&s;t, they are improvident for what is to come, it is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain their age, with any de|gree of preci&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ulloa Notic.

tho&s;e of the animals whom he nearly re&s;embles in his mode of life, more violent, and more fatal. If luxury engenders and nouri&s;hes di&s;tempers of one &s;pecies, the rigour and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of &s;avage life bring on tho&s;e of another. As men, in this &s;tate, are wonderfully improvident, and their means of &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence precarious, they often pa&s;s from extreme want to exuberant plenty, according to the vi&s;&s;ici|tudes of fortune in the cha&s;e, or in con&s;equence of the various degree of abundance with which the earth affords to them its productions, in different &s;ea&s;ons. Their incon&s;iderate gluttony in the one &s;ituation, and their &s;evere ab&s;tinence in the other, are equally pernicious. For though the human con&s;titution may be accu&s;tomed by habit, like that of animals of prey, to tolerate long famine, and then to gorge voraciou&s;ly, it is not a little affected by &s;uch &s;udden and violent tran&s;itions. The &s;trength and vigour of &s;avages are, at &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, impair|ed by what they &s;uffer from &s;carcity of food; at others they are afflicted with di&s;orders ari&s;ing from indige&s;tion and a &s;uperfluity of gro&s;s aliment. The&s;e are &s;o common, that they may be con&s;idered as the unavoidable con&s;equence of their mode of &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting, and cut off con&s;iderable numbers in the prime of life. They are likewi&s;e extremely &s;ub|ject to con&s;umptions, to pleuritic, a&s;thmatic, and paralytic di&s;orders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 364. La&s;itau, ii, 360.

or tends mo&s;t to abridge human life. The influence of the former is certainly mo&s;t exten&s;ive.

<P>ONE dreadful malady, the &s;evere&s;t &s;courge, with which, in this life, offended Heaven cha&s;tens the indulgence of criminal de&s;ire, &s;eems to have been peculiar to the Americans. By communicating it to their conquerors, they have not only amply avenged their own wrongs, but by adding this ca|lamity to tho&s;e which formerly imbittered human life, they have, perhaps, more than counterbalanced all the benefits which Europe has derived from the di&s;covery of the New World. This di&s;temper, from the country in which it fir&s;t raged, or from the people by whom it was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;pread over Europe, has been &s;ometimes called the Neapolitan, and &s;ometimes the French di&s;ea&s;e.

During the cour&s;e of two centuries and a half, its virulence &s;eems to have abated con&s;iderably.

Among tho&s;e tribes where the &s;ea&s;on of infancy is &s;hort, and the young

&s;oon acquire vigour or agility, no permanent union is formed. Nature commits the care of training up the offspring to the mother alone, and her ten|derne&s;s, without any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is equal to the ta&s;k. But where the &s;tate of infancy is long and helple&s;s, and the joint a&s;&s;iduity of both parents is requi&s;ite in tending their feeble progeny, there a more intimate connexion takes place, and conti|nues until the purpo&s;e of nature be accompli&s;hed, and the new race grow up to full maturity. As the infancy of man is more feeble and helple&s;s than that of any other animal, and he is dependent, during a much longer period, on the care and fore|&s;ight of his parents, the union between hu&s;band and wife came early to be con&s;idered, not only as a &s;olemn, but as a permanent contract. A general &s;tate of promi&s;cuous intercour&s;e between the &s;exes, never exi&s;ted but in the imagination of poets. In the infancy of &s;ociety, when men, de&s;titute of arts and indu&s;try, lead a hard precarious life, the rearing of their progeny demands the attention and efforts of both parents; and if their union had not been formed and continued with this view, the race could not have been pre&s;erved. Accordingly, in America, even among the rude&s;t tribes, a regular union be|tween hu&s;band and wife was univer&s;al, and the rights of marriage were under&s;tood and recognized. In tho&s;e di&s;tricts where &s;ub&s;i&s;tence was &s;canty, and the difficulty of maintaining a family was great, the man confined him&s;elf to one wife.

That women are indebted to the refinements of poli&s;hed manners for a happy change in their &s;tate, is a point which can admit of no doubt. To de&s;pi&s;e and to degrade the female &s;ex, is the characteri&s;tic of the &s;avage &s;tate in every part of the globe. Man, proud of excelling in &s;trength and in courage, the chief marks of pre-eminence among rude people, treats woman, as an inferior, with di&s;dain. The Americans, perhaps from that coldne&s;s and in&s;en&s;ibility which has been con&s;idered as peculiar to their con&s;titution, add neglect and har&s;hne&s;s to contempt.

<P>THE tribe of the Natchez,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sy&s;tem of the Nat|chez.</NOTE> and the people of Bogota had advanced beyond the other unculti|vated nations of America in their ideas of religion, as well as in their political in&s;titutions; and it is no le&s;s difficult to explain the cau&s;e of this di&s;tinction than of that which we have already con&s;idered. The Sun was the chief object of religious wor&s;hip among the Natchez. In their temples, which were con&s;tructed with &s;ome magnificence, and decorated with various ornaments, according to their mode of architecture, they pre&s;erved a perpetual fire, as the pure&s;t emblem of their divinity. Mini&s;ters were appointed to watch and feed this &s;acred flame. The fir&s;t function of the great chief of the nation, every morning, was an act of obei&s;ance to the Sun; and fe&s;tivals returned at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, which were celebrated by the whole community with &s;olemn but unbloody rites<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dumont, i. 158, &amp;c.

This is the mo&s;t refined &s;pecies of &s;uper&s;tition known in America, and, per|haps, one of the mo&s;t natural as well as mo&s;t &s;e|ducing.

inquiry, contemplates and admires his uni|ver&s;al and animating energy, its admiration is apt to &s;top &s;hort at what is vi&s;ible, without reaching to the un&s;een cau&s;e; and pays that adoration to the mo&s;t glorious and beneficial work of God, which is due only to him who formed it. As fire is the pure&s;t and mo&s;t active of the elements, and in &s;ome of its qualities and effects re&s;embles the Sun, it was, not improperly, cho&s;en to be the emblem of his powerful operation. The ancient Per&s;ians, a people far &s;uperior, in every re&s;pect, to that rude tribe who&s;e rites I am de&s;cribing, founded their re|ligious &s;y&s;tem on &s;imilar principles, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a form of public wor&s;hip, le&s;s gro&s;s and exception|able than any people de&s;titute of guidance from revelation.

<P>AMONG the people of Bogota, the Sun and Moon were, likewi&s;e, the chief objects of venera|tion.

When the events of war were peculiarly di&s;a&s;trous, when they met with unfore&s;een di&s;ap|pointments in hunting, when inundations or drought threatened their crops with de&s;truction, they called upon their conjurers to begin their incantations, in order to di&s;cover the cau&s;es of tho&s;e calamities, or to foretell what would be their i&s;&s;ue<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Charlev.

Even among the rude&s;t tribes in America, &s;uper&s;tition appears in this form, and divination is an art in high e&s;teem.

The &s;aliva excites a vigorous fermentation, and in a few days the liquor becomes fit for drinking.

At his fir&s;t appearance in the &s;tate of infancy, whether it be among the rude&s;t &s;avages, or in the mo&s;t civilized nation, we can di&s;cern no quality which marks any di&s;tinction or &s;uperiority. The capacity of improvement &s;eems to be the &s;ame; and the talents he may afterwards acquire, as well as the virtues he may be rendered capable of exerci&s;ing, depend, in a great mea&s;ure, upon the &s;tate of &s;ociety in which he is placed. To this &s;tate his mind naturally accommodates it|&s;elf, and from it receives di&s;cipline and culture. In proportion to the wants which it accu&s;toms a human being to feel, and the functions in which the&s;e engage him, his intellectual powers are called forth. According to the connections which it e&s;ta|bli&s;hes between him and the re&s;t of his &s;pecies, the affections of his heart are exerted. It is only by attending to this great principle, that we can di&s;|cover what is the character of man in every different period of his progre&s;s.</P>

They are confined within the narrow &s;phere of what he deems nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upplying his own wants. Whatever has not &s;ome relation to the&s;e, neither attracts his attention, nor is the object of his enquiries. But however narrow the bounds may be within which the knowledge of a

&s;avage is circum&s;cribed, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es thoroughly that &s;mall portion which he has attained. It was not communicated to him by formal in&s;truction; he does not attend to it as a matter of mere &s;pecu|lation and curio&s;ity; it is the re&s;ult of his own ob|&s;ervation, the fruit of his own experience, and accommodated to his own condition and exigencies. While employed in the active occupations of war or of hunting, he often finds him&s;elf in difficult and perilous &s;ituations, from which the efforts of his own &s;agacity mu&s;t extricate him. He is frequently engaged in mea&s;ures, where every &s;tep depends upon his own ability to decide, where he mu&s;t rely &s;olely upon his own penetration to di&s;cern the dan|gers to which he is expo&s;ed, and upon his own wi&s;|dom in providing again&s;t them. In con&s;equence of this, he feels the knowledge which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and the efforts which he makes, and either in deli|beration or action re&s;ts on him&s;elf alone.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Political talents.</NOTE>AS the talents of individuals are exerci&s;ed and improved by &s;uch exertions, much political wi&s;dom is &s;aid to be di&s;played in conducting the affairs of their &s;mall communities.

di&s;playing political talents cannot be exten&s;ive. Where the idea of private property is incomplete, and no criminal juri&s;diction is e&s;tabli&s;hed, there is hardly any function of internal government to exer|ci&s;e. Where there is no commerce, and &s;carcely any intercour&s;e among &s;eparate tribes; where enmity is implacable, and ho&s;tilities are carried on almo&s;t without intermi&s;&s;ion, there will be few points of public concern to adju&s;t with their neighbours; and that department of their affairs which may be deno|minated foreign, cannot be &s;o intricate as to require much refined policy in conducting it.

It is the genius of &s;a|vages to act from the impul&s;e of pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ion. They have neither fore&s;ight nor temper to form complicated arrangements with re&s;pect to their future conduct.

In many of his operations, he &s;tands as much detached from the re&s;t of his &s;pecies, as if he had formed no union with them. Con&s;cious how little he depends upon other men, he is apt to view them with a carele&s;s indifference. Even the force of his mind contri|butes to increa&s;e this unconcern, and as he looks not beyond him&s;elf in deliberating with re&s;pect to the part which he &s;hould act, his &s;olicitude about the con&s;equences of it &s;eldom extends farther.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cunning.</NOTE>TO the &s;ame cau&s;es may be imputed the refined cunning with which they form and execute their &s;chemes. Men, who are not habituated to a liberal communication of their own &s;entiments and wi&s;hes, are apt to be &s;o di&s;tru&s;tful, as to place little confi|dence in others, and to have recour&s;e to an in&s;idi|ous craft in accompli&s;hing their own purpo&s;es. In civilized life, tho&s;e per&s;ons, who, by their &s;itua|tion, have but a few objects of pur&s;uit on which their minds ince&s;&s;antly dwell, are mo&s;t remarkable for low artifice in carrying on their little projects. Among &s;avages, who&s;e views are equally confined, and their attention no le&s;s per&s;evering, tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances mu&s;t operate &s;till more powerfully, and gradually accu&s;tom them to a di&s;ingenuous &s;ubtlety in all their tran&s;actions. The force of this is in|crea&s;ed by habits which they acquire in carrying on the two mo&s;t intere&s;ting operations wherein they are engaged. With them war is a &s;y&s;tem of craft, in which they tru&s;t for &s;ucce&s;s to &s;tratagem more than to open force, and have their invention conti|nually on the &s;tretch to circumvent and &s;urpri&s;e their enemies.

<P>THUS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satisfaction with their own condi|tion.</NOTE> in every &s;ituation where a human being can be placed, even the mo&s;t unfavourable, there are virtues which peculiarly belong to it; there are af|fections which it calls forth; there is a &s;pecies of hap|pine&s;s which it yields. Nature, with mo&s;t benefi|cent intention, conciliates and forms the mind to its condition; the ideas and wi&s;hes of man extend not beyond that &s;tate of &s;ociety to which he is habituated. What it pre&s;ents as objects of contemplation or enjoyment, fills and &s;atisfies his mind, and he can hardly conceive any other mode of life to be plea|&s;ant, or even tolerable. The Tartar, accu&s;tomed to roam over exten&s;ive plains, and to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the product of his herds, imprecates upon his enemy, as the greate&s;t of all cur&s;es, that he may be con|demned to re&s;ide in one place, and to be nouri&s;hed with the top of a weed. The rude Americans, fond of their own pur&s;uits, and &s;atisfied with their own lot, are equally unable to comprehend the in|tention or utility of the various accommodations, which, in more poli&s;hed &s;ociety, are deemed e&s;&s;en|tial to the comfort of life.

<P>THUS I have fini&s;hed a laborious delineation of the character and manners of the uncivilized tribes &s;cattered over the va&s;t continent of America. In this, I a&s;pire not at rivalling the great ma&s;ters who have painted and adorned &s;avage life, either in bold|ne&s;s of de&s;ign, or in the glow and beauty of their colouring. I am &s;atisfied with the more humble merit of having per&s;i&s;ted with patient indu&s;try, in viewing my &s;ubjects in many various lights, and collecting from the mo&s;t accurate ob&s;ervers &s;uch detached, and often minute features, as might enable me to exhibit a portrait that re&s;embles the original.</P>

In contemplating the inhabitants of a country &s;o widely extended as America, great attention &s;hould be paid to the diver&s;ity of climates under which they are placed. The influence of this I

have pointed out with re&s;pect to &s;everal important particulars, which have been the object of re&s;earch; but even where it has not been mentioned, it ought not to be overlooked. The provinces of America are of &s;uch different temperament, that this alone is &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a di&s;tinction between their inhabitants. In every part of the earth where man exi&s;ts, the power of climate operates, with deci&s;ive influence, upon his condition and character. In tho&s;e countries which approach near to the extremes of heat or cold, this influence is &s;o con&s;picuous as to &s;trike every eye. Whether we con&s;ider man merely as an animal, or as being endowed with rational powers which fit him for activity and &s;pe|culation, we &s;hall find that he has uniformly at|tained the greate&s;t perfection of which his nature is capable, in the temperate regions of the globe. There his con&s;titution is mo&s;t vigorous, his organs mo&s;t acute, and his form mo&s;t beautiful. There, too, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;uperior extent of capacity, greater fertility of imagination, more enterpri&s;ing courage, and a &s;en&s;ibility of heart which gives birth to de&s;ires, not only ardent, but per&s;evering. In this favourite &s;ituation he has di&s;played the utmo&s;t efforts of his genius, in literature, in policy, in com|merce, in war, and in all the arts which improve or embelli&s;h life <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Fergu&s;on's E&s;&s;ay on the Hi&s;t. of Civil Society, part iii. c. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS powerful operation of climate, is felt mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly by rude nations, and produces greater ef|fects than in &s;ocieties more improved. The talents of civilized men are continually exerted in render|ing their own condition more comfortable; and by their ingenuity and inventions, they can, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;upply the defects, and guard again&s;t the inconveniencies of any climate. But the improvi|dent

&s;avage is affected by every circum&s;tance pe|culiar to his &s;ituation. He takes no precaution ei|ther to mitigate or to improve it. Like a plant, or an animal, he is formed by the climate under which he is placed, and feels the full force of its influence.</P>
<P>IN &s;urveying the rude nations of America, this natural di&s;tinction between the inhabitants of the temperate and torrid zones is very remarkable. They may, accordingly, be divided into two great cla&s;&s;es. The one comprehends all the North Americans, from the river St. Laurence to the Gulf of Mexico, together with the people of Chili, and a few &s;mall tribes towards the extremity of the &s;outhern continent. To the other belong all the inhabitants of the i&s;lands, and tho&s;e &s;ettled in the various provinces which extend from the i&s;thmus of Darien almo&s;t to the &s;outhern confines of Bra&s;il, along the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Andes. In the former, which comprehends all the regions of the tem|perate zone that in America are inhabited, the human &s;pecies appears manife&s;tly to be more per|fect. The natives are more robu&s;t, more active, more intelligent, and more courageous. They po&s;&s;e&s;s, in the mo&s;t eminent degree, that force of mind, and love of independence, which I have pointed out as the chief virtues of man in his &s;a|vage &s;tate. They have defended their liberty with per&s;evering fortitude again&s;t the Europeans, who &s;ubdued the other rude nations of America with the greate&s;t ea&s;e. The natives of the temperate zone are the only people in the New World who are indebted for their freedom to their own valour. The North Americans, though long encompa&s;&s;ed by three formidable European powers, &s;till retain part of their original po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and continue to exi&s;t as independent nations. The people of Chili, though early invaded, &s;till maintain a gallant con|te&s;t

with the Spaniards, and have &s;et bounds to their encroachments; whereas, in the warmer re|gions, men are more feeble in their frame, le&s;s vi|gorous in the efforts of their mind, of a gentle but da&s;tardly &s;pirit, more en&s;laved by plea&s;ure, and more &s;unk in indolence. Accordingly, it is in the torrid zone that the Europeans have mo&s;t com|pletely e&s;tabli&s;hed their dominion over America; the mo&s;t fertile and de&s;irable provinces in it are &s;ubjected to their yoke; and if &s;everal tribes there &s;till enjoy independence, it is either becau&s;e they have never been attacked by an enemy already &s;a|tiated with conque&s;t, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of larger terri|tories than he was able to occupy, or becau&s;e they have been &s;aved from oppre&s;&s;ion by their remote and inacce&s;&s;ible &s;ituation.</P>
<P>CONSPICUOUS as this di&s;tinction may appear be|tween the inhabitants of tho&s;e different regions, it is not, however, univer&s;al. Moral and political cau&s;es, as I have formerly ob&s;erved, affect the di&s;|po&s;ition and character of individuals as well as nations, &s;till more powerfully than the influence of climate. There are, accordingly, &s;ome tribes, in various parts of the torrid zone, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of cou|rage, high &s;pirit, and the love of independence, in a degree hardly inferior to the natives of more temperate climates. We are too little acquainted with the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e people, to be able to trace the &s;everal circum&s;tances in their progre&s;s and con|dition, to which they are indebted for this remark|able pre-eminence. The fact, neverthele&s;s, is cer|tain. As early as the fir&s;t voyage of Columbus, he received information that &s;everal of the i&s;lands were inhabited by the <HI>Caribbees,</HI> a fierce race of men, no wi&s;e re&s;embling their feeble and timid neigh|bours.

<P>THE Periplus Hannonis is the only authentic monument of the Carthaginian &s;kill in naval affairs, and one of the mo&s;t curious fragments tran&s;mitted to us by antiquity. The learned and indu&s;trious Mr. Dodwell, in a di&s;&s;ertation prefixed to the Periplus of Hanno, in the edition of the Minor Geographers publi&s;hed at Oxford, endeavours to prove that this is a &s;purious work, the compo&s;ition of &s;ome Greek, who a&s;&s;umed Hanno's name. But M. de Monte&s;quieu, in his l'E&s;prit des Loix, liv. xxi. c. 8. and M. de Bougainville, in a di&s;&s;ertation publi&s;hed, tom. xxvi. of the Memoires de l'Academie des In&s;criptions, &amp;c. have e&s;tabli&s;hed its authenticity by arguments which to me appear unan&s;werable. Ramu&s;io has accompanied his tran&s;lation of this curious voyage with a di&s;&s;ertation tending to illu&s;trate it. Ra|colte

de Viaggi, vol. i. p. 112. M. de Bouganville has, with great learning and ability, treated the &s;ame &s;ubject. It appears that Hanno, according to the mode of ancient navigation, under|took this voyage in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, &s;o con&s;tructed, that he could keep clo&s;e in with the coa&s;t. He &s;ailed from Gades to the i&s;land of Cerne in twelve days. This is probably what is known to the moderns by the name of the i&s;le of Arguim. It became the chief &s;tation of the Carthaginians on that coa&s;t; and M. de Bouganville contends, that the ci&s;terns found there are monu|ments of the Carthaginian power and ingenuity. Proceeding from Cerne, and &s;till following the winding of the coa&s;t, he ar|rived, in &s;eventeen days, at a promontory which he called <HI>The We&s;t Horn,</HI> probably Cape Palmas. From this he advanced to another promontory, which he named <HI>The South Horn,</HI> and which is manife&s;tly Cape de T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es Puntas, about five degrees north of the line. All the circum&s;tances contained in the &s;hort ab|&s;tract of his journal, which is handed down, to us, concerning the appearance and &s;tate of the countries on the coa&s;t of Africa, are confirmed and illu&s;trated by a compari&s;on with the accounts of modern navigators. Even tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which, from their &s;eeming improbability, have been produced to invalidate the credibility of his relation, tend to confirm it. He ob&s;erves, that in the country to the &s;outh of Cerne, a profound &s;ilence reigned through the day; but during the night innumerable fires were kindled along the banks of the rivers, and the air re&s;ound|ed with the noi&s;e of pipes and drums, and cries of joy. The &s;ame thing, as Ramu&s;io ob&s;erves, &s;till takes place. The exce&s;|&s;ive heat obliges the negroes to take &s;helter in the woods, or in their hou&s;es, during the day. As &s;oon as the &s;un &s;ets, they &s;ally out, and by torch-light enjoy the plea&s;ure of mu&s;ic and dancing, in which they &s;pend the night. Ramu&s;. i. 113. F. In another place, he mentions the &s;ea as burning with torrents of fire. What occurred to M Adan&s;on, on the &s;ame coa&s;t, may ex|plain this: "As &s;oon," &s;ays he, "as the &s;un dipped beneath the horizon, and night over&s;pread the earth with darkne&s;s, the &s;ea lent us its friendly light. While the prow of our ve&s;&s;el ploughed the &s;oaming &s;urges, it &s;eemed to &s;et them all on fire. Thus we &s;ailed in a luminous inclo&s;ure, which &s;urrounded us like a large circle of rays, from whence darted in the wake of the &s;hip a long &s;tream of light." Voy. to Senegal, p. 176. This appearance of the &s;ea ob&s;erved by Hunter, has been mentioned as an argument again&s;t the authenticity of the Periplus. It is, however, a phenomenon very common in warm climates. Capt. Cook's Second Voyage, vol. i. p. 15.

<P>LONG after the navigation of the Phenicians and of Eu|doxus round Africa, Polybius, the mo&s;t intelligent and be&s;t informed hi&s;torian of antiquity, and particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by his attention to geographical re&s;earches, affirms, that it was not known, in his time, whether Africa was a continued con|tinent, &s;tretching to the &s;outh, or whether it was encompa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ea.

If they had given full credit to the accounts of tho&s;e voyages, the former could not have entertained &s;uch a doubt, the latter could not have delivered &s;uch an opinion. Strabo mentions the voyage of Eudoxus, but treats it as a fa|bulous tale, lib ii. p. 155; and, according to his account of it, no other judgment can be formed with re&s;pect to it. Strabo &s;eems not to have known any thing with certainty concerning the form and &s;tate of the &s;outhern parts of Africa. Geogr. lib. xvii. p. 1180. Ptolemy, the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive and learned of all the ancient geographers, was equally unacquainted with any part of Africa &s;ituated a few degrees beyond the equinoctial line; for he &s;uppo&s;es that this great continent was not &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, but that it &s;tretched, without interruption, towards the &s;outh pole: and he &s;o far mi&s;takes its true figure, that he de&s;cribes the continent as becoming broader and broader as it advanced towards the &s;outh.

<P>A FACT, recorded by Strabo, affords a very &s;trong and &s;ingular proof of the ignorance of the ancients with re&s;pect to the &s;ituation of the various parts of the earth. When Alex|ander marched along the banks of the Hyda&s;pes and Ace&s;ine, two of the rivers which fall into the Indus, he ob&s;erved that there were many crocodiles in tho&s;e rivers, and that the country produced beans of the &s;ame &s;pecies with tho&s;e which were com|mon in Egypt. From the&s;e circum&s;tances, he concluded that he had di&s;covered the &s;ource of the Nile, and prepared a fleet to &s;ail down the Hyda&s;pes to Egypt. Strab. Geogr. lib. xv. p. 1020. This amazing error did not ari&s;e from any ignorance of geography peculiar to that monarch; for we are informed by Strabo, that Alexander applied with particular attention in order to acquire the knowledge
<PB N="454" REF="034476_0451_0FFDD89F0C770658">
of this &s;cience, and had accurate maps or de&s;criptions of the countries through which he marched. Lib. ii. p. 120. But in his age, the knowledge of the Greeks did not extend beyond the limits of the Mediterranean.</P>

<P>IT is probable that the ancients were &s;eldom induced to ad|vance &s;o far as the mouth of the Ganges, either by motives of curio&s;ity, or views of commercial advantage. In con&s;equence of this, their idea concerning the po&s;ition of that great river was very erroneous. Ptolemy places that branch of the Ganges which he di&s;tingui&s;hes by the name of the Great Mouth, in the hundred and forty-&s;ixth degree of longitude from his fir&s;t meridian in the Fortunate I&s;lands. But its true longitude, computed from that meridian, is now determined by a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations to be only a hundred and five degrees. A geographer &s;o eminent, mu&s;t have been betrayed into an error of this magnitude by the imper|fection of the information which he had received concerning tho&s;e di&s;tant regions; and this affords a &s;triking proof of the intercour&s;e with them being extremely rare. With re&s;pect to the countries of India along the Ganges, his intelligence was &s;till more defec|tive, and his errors more enormous. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to ob|&s;erve in another place, that he has placed the country of the Seres, or China, no le&s;s than &s;ixty degrees farther ea&s;t than its true po|&s;ition. M d'Anville, one of the mo&s;t learned and intelligent of the modern geographers, has &s;et this matter in a clear light, in two di&s;&s;ertations publi&s;hed in Mem. de l'Academ. des In&s;cript. &amp;c. tom. xxxii. p. 573, 604.</P>

<P>IT is remarkable, that the di&s;coveries of the ancients were made chiefly by land; tho&s;e of the moderns are carried on chiefly by &s;ea.

When it is carried on only by &s;ea, its &s;phere may be more exten&s;ive, and its advances more rapid; but it la|bours under peculiar defects. Though it may make known the po&s;ition of different countries, and a&s;certain their boundaries as far as the&s;e are determined by the ocean, it leaves us in igno|rance with re&s;pect to their interior &s;tate. Above two centuries and a half have elap&s;ed &s;ince the Europeans &s;ailed round the &s;outhern promontory of Africa, and have traded in mo&s;t of its ports; but, in a con&s;iderable part of that great continent, they have done little more than &s;urvey its coa&s;ts, and mark its capes and harbours. Its interior regions are in a great mea&s;ure un|known. The ancients, who had a very imperfect knowledge of its coa&s;ts, except where they are wa&s;hed by the Mediterranean or Red Sea, were accu&s;tomed to penetrate into its inland provin|ces, and, if we may rely on the te&s;timony of Herodotus and Dio|dorus Siculus, had explored many parts of it now altogether un|known.

<P>THE notion of the ancients concerning &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive degree of heat in the torrid zone, as rendered it uninha|bitable, and their per&s;i&s;ting in this error long after they began to have &s;ome commercial intercour&s;e with &s;everal parts of India lying within the tropics, mu&s;t appear &s;o &s;ingular and ab&s;urd, that it may not be unacceptable to &s;ome of my readers to produce evidence of their holding this opinion, and to account for the apparent in|con&s;i&s;tence of their theory with their experience. Cicero, who had be&s;towed attention upon every part of philo&s;ophy known to the ancients, &s;eems to have believed that the torrid zone was un|inhabitable, and, of con&s;equence, that there could be no inter|cour&s;e between the northern and &s;outhern temperate zones. He introduces Africanus thus addre&s;&s;ing the younger Scipio: "You &s;ee this earth encompa&s;&s;ed, and as it were, bound in by certain zones, of which, two, at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from each other, and &s;u&s;taining the oppo&s;ite poles of heaven, are frozen with per|petual cold; the middle one, and the large&s;t, of all, is burnt with the heat of the &s;un; two are habitable, the people in the &s;outhern one are antipodes to us, with whom we have no con|nection." <HI>Somnium Scipionis,</HI> c. 6. Geminus, a Greek philo|&s;opher, contemporary with Cicero, delivers the &s;ame doctrine, not in a popular work, but in his <GAP DESC="foreign">, a treati&s;e purely &s;cientific.

temperate zone, and its inhabitants, and concerning tho&s;e who are called antipodes, it mu&s;t be always under&s;tood, that we have no certain knowledge or information concerning the &s;outhern tem|perate zone, whether it be inhabited or not. But from the &s;pherical figure of the earth, and the cour&s;e which the &s;un holds between the tropics, we conclude that there is another zone, &s;itu|ated to the &s;outh, which enjoys the &s;ame degree of temperature with the northern one which we inhabit." Cap. xiii. p. 31. ap. Petavii Opus de Doctr. Temper. in quo Uranologium &s;ive Sy&s;te|mata var. Auctorum. Am&s;t. 1705. vol. iii. The opinion of Pliny the naturali&s;t, with re&s;pect to both the&s;e points, was the &s;ame: "There are five divi&s;ions of the earth, which are called zones. All that portion which lies near to the two oppo&s;ite poles is oppre&s;&s;ed with vehement cold, and eternal fro&s;t. There unble&s;t with the a&s;pect of milder &s;tars, perpetual darkne&s;s reigns, or at the ut|mo&s;t a feeble light reflected from &s;urrounding &s;nows. The mid|dle of the earth, in which is the orbit of the &s;un, is &s;corched and burnt up with flames and fiery vapour. Between the&s;e torrid and frozen di&s;tricts lie two other portions of the earth, which are temperate; but, on account of the burning region interpo&s;ed, there can be no communication between them. Thus Heaven has deprived us of three parts of the earth." Lib. ii. c. 68. Strabo delivers his opinion to the &s;ame effect, in terms no le&s;s explicit: "The portion of the earth which lies near the equator, in the torrid zone, is rendered uninhabitable by heat." Lib. ii. p. 154. To the&s;e I might add the authority of many other re|&s;pectable philo&s;ophers and hi&s;torians of antiquity.</P>
<P>IN order to explain the &s;en&s;e in which this doctrine was gene|rally received, we may ob&s;erve, that Parmenides, as we are in|formed by Strabo, was the fir&s;t who divided the earth into five zones, and he extended the limits of the zone which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be uninhabitable on account of heat, beyond the tropics. Ari&s;|totle, as we learn likewi&s;e from Strabo, fixed the boundaries of the different zones in the &s;ame manner as they are defined by mo|dern geographers. But the progre&s;s of di&s;covery having gradu|ally demon&s;trated that &s;everal regions of the earth which lay with|in the tropics were not only habitable, but populous and fertile, this induced later geographers to circum&s;cribe the limits of the torrid zone. It is not ea&s;y to a&s;certain with preci&s;ion the boun|daries which they allotted to it. From a pa&s;&s;age in Strabo, who, as far as I know, is the only author of antiquity from whom we receive any hint concerning this &s;ubject, I &s;hould conjecture, that tho&s;e who calculated according to the mea&s;urement of the earth by Erato&s;thenes, &s;uppo&s;ed the torrid zone to comprehend near &s;ixteen degrees, about eight on each &s;ide of the equator; whereas &s;uch as followed the computation of Po&s;idonius allotted about twenty-four degrees, or &s;omewhat more than twelve degrees on
<PB N="457" REF="034476_0454_0FFDD8A99DE1B050">
each &s;ide of the equator to the torrid zone. Strabo, lib, ii. p. 151. According to the former opinion, about two-thirds of that por|tion of the earth which lies between the tropics was con&s;idered as habitable; according to the latter, about one half of it. With this re&s;triction, the doctrine of the ancients concerning the torrid zone appears le&s;s ab&s;urd; and we can conceive the rea&s;on of their a&s;&s;erting this zone to be uninhabitable, even after they had opened a communication with &s;everal places within the tropics. When men of &s;cience &s;poke of the torrid zone, they con&s;idered it as it was limited by the definition of geographers to &s;ixteen, or at the utmo&s;t to twenty-four degrees; and as they knew almo&s;t nothing of the countries nearer to the equator, they might &s;till &s;uppo&s;e them to be uninhabitable. In loo&s;e and popu|lar di&s;cour&s;e, the name of the torrid zone continued to be given to all that portion of the earth which lies within the tropics. Cicero &s;eems to have been unacquainted with tho&s;e ideas of the later geographers, and adhering to the divi&s;ion of Parmenides, de&s;cribes the torrid zone as the large&s;t of the five. Some of the ancients rejected the notion concerning the intolerable heat of the torrid zone as a popular error. This, we are told by Plu|tarch, was the &s;entiment of Pythagoras, and we learn from Strabo, that Erato&s;thenes and Polybius had adopted the &s;ame opinion, lib. ii. 154. Ptolemy &s;eems to have paid no regard to the ancient doctrine and opinions concerning the torrid zone.</P>

<P>THE &s;pherical figure of the earth was known to the ancient geographers. They invented the method, &s;till in u&s;e, of computing the longitude and latitude of different places. Accor|ding to their doctrine, the equator, or imaginary line which en|compa&s;&s;es the earth, contained three hundred and &s;ixty degrees; the&s;e they divided into twenty-four parts, or hours, each equal to fifteen degrees. The country of the <HI>Seres,</HI> or <HI>Sinae,</HI> being the farthe&s;t part of India known to the ancients, was &s;uppo&s;ed, by Marinus Tyrius, the mo&s;t eminent of the ancient geographers before Ptolemy, to be fifteen hours, or two hundred and twenty-five degrees to the ea&s;t of the fir&s;t meridian, pa&s;&s;ing through the Fortunate I&s;lands. Ptolemaei Geogr. lib. i. c. 11. If this &s;up|po&s;ition was well-founded, the country of the Seres, or China, was only nine hours, or one hundred and thirty-five degrees we&s;t from the Fortunate or Canary I&s;lands; and the navigation, in that direction, was much &s;horter than by the cour&s;e which the Portu|gue&s;e were pur&s;uing. Marco Polo, in his travels, had de&s;cribed countries, particularly the i&s;land of Cipango or Zipangri &s;up|po&s;ed to be Japan, con&s;iderably to the ea&s;t of any part of A&s;ia known to the ancients.

Herrera, dec. 1. lib. i. c. 2. A more exten&s;ive knowledge of the globe has now di&s;covered the great error of Marinus, in &s;uppo&s;ing China to be fifteen hours, or two hundred and twenty-five degrees ea&s;t from the Canary I&s;lands, and that even Ptolemy was mi&s;taken, when he reduced the longitude of China to twelve hours, or one hundred and eighty degrees. The longitude of the we&s;tern frontier of that va&s;t em|pire is &s;even hours, or one hundred and fifteen degrees from the meridian of the Canary I&s;lands. But Columbus followed the light which his age afforded, and relied upon the authority of writers, who were, at that time, regarded as the in&s;tructors and guides of mankind in the &s;cience of geography.</P>

<P>EVERY monument or &s;uch a man as Columbus is valuable. A letter which he wrote to Ferdinand and I&s;abella, de|&s;cribing what pa&s;&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, exhibits a mo&s;t &s;triking pic|ture of his intrepidity, his humanity, his prudence, his public &s;pirit, and courtly addre&s;s. "I would have been le&s;s concerned for this misfortune, had I alone been in danger, both becau&s;e my life is a debt that I owe to the Supreme Creator, and becau&s;e I have at other times been expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent hazard. But what gave me infinite grief and vexation was, that after it had plea&s;ed our Lord to give me faith to undertake this enter|pri&s;e, in which I had now been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, that my opponents would have been convinced, and the glory of your highne&s;&s;es, and the extent of your territory increa&s;ed by me; it &s;hould plea&s;e the Divine Maje&s;ty to &s;top all by my death. All this would have been more tolerable, had it not been attended with the lo&s;s of tho&s;e men whom I had carried with me, upon promi&s;e of the greate&s;t pro&s;perity, who &s;eeing them&s;elves in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, cur&s;ed not only their coming along with me, but that fear and awe of me, which prevented them from returning as they often had re|&s;olved to have done. But be&s;ides all this, my &s;orrow was greatly increa&s;ed, by recollecting that I had left my two &s;ons at &s;chool at Cordova, de&s;titute of friends, in a foreign country, when it could not in all probability be known that I had done &s;uch &s;ervices as might induce your highne&s;&s;es to remember them. And though I comforted my&s;elf with the faith that our Lord would not permit that, which tended &s;o much to the glory of his church, and which I had brought about with &s;o much trouble, to remain imperfect, yet I con&s;idered that on account of my &s;ins, it was his will to deprive me of that glory, which I might have attained in this world. While in this confu&s;ed &s;tate, I thought on the good for|tune which accompanies your highne&s;&s;es, and imagined, that al|though I &s;hould peri&s;h, and the ve&s;&s;el be lo&s;t, it was po&s;&s;ible that you might &s;omehow come to the knowledge of my voyage, and the &s;ucce&s;s with which it was attended. For that rea&s;on I wrote upon parchment with the brevity which the &s;ituation required, that I had di&s;co|vered the lands which I promi&s;ed, in how many days I had done it, and what cour&s;e I had followed. I mentioned the goodne&s;s of the country, the character of the inhabitants, and that your
<PB N="462" REF="034476_0459_0FFDD8D5D7FC2AD0">
highne&s;&s;es &s;ubjects were left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that I had di&s;co|vered. Having &s;ealed this writing, I addre&s;&s;ed it to your high|ne&s;&s;es, and promi&s;ed a thou&s;and ducats to any per&s;on who &s;hould deliver it &s;ealed, &s;o that if any foreigners found it, the promi&s;ed reward might prevail on them not to give the information to ano|ther. I then cau&s;ed a great ca&s;k to be brought to me, and wrapping up the parchment in an oiled cloth, and afterwards in a cake of wax, I put it into the ca&s;k, and having &s;topped it well, I ca&s;t it, into the &s;ea. All the men believed that it was &s;ome act of devo|tion. Imagining that this might never chance to be taken up, as the &s;hips approached nearer to Spain, I made another packet like the fir&s;t, and placed it at the top of the poop, &s;o that if the &s;hip &s;unk, the ca&s;k remaining above water might be committed to the guidance of fortune."</P>

According to their account, a ve&s;&s;el having been driven from its cour&s;e by ea&s;terly winds, was carried before them far to the we&s;t, and landed on the coa&s;t of an unknown country, from which it returned with difficulty; the pilot, and three &s;ailors, being the only per&s;ons who &s;urvived the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which the crew &s;uffered, from want of provi&s;ions, and fatigue in this long voyage. In a few days after their arrival, all the four died; but the pilot having been received into the hou&s;e of Columbus, his intimate friend di&s;clo&s;ed to him, before his death, the &s;ecret of the di&s;covery which he had accidentally made, and left him his papers, containing a journal of the voyage, which &s;erved as a guide to Columbus in his undertaking. Gomara, as far as I know, is the fir&s;t author who publi&s;hed this &s;tory, Hi&s;t. c. 13. Every circum&s;tance is de&s;titute of evidence to &s;up|port it. Neither the name of the ve&s;&s;el nor its de&s;tination is known. Some pretend that it belonged to one of the &s;ea-port towns in Andalu&s;ia, and was &s;ailing either to the Canaries, or to Madeira; others, that it was a Bi&s;cayner in its way to England; others, a Portugue&s;e &s;hip trading on the coa&s;t of Guinea. The name of the pilot is alike unknown, as well as that of the port in which he landed on his return. According to &s;ome, it was in Portugal; according to others, in Madeira, or the Azores.

Oviedo takes notice of this re|port, but con&s;iders it as a tale fit only to amu&s;e the vulgar. Hi&s;t. lib. ii. c. 2. As Columbus held his cour&s;e directly we&s;t from the Canaries, and never varied it, &s;ome later authors have &s;uppo&s;ed, that this uniformity is a proof of his being guided by &s;ome previous information. But they do not recollect the principles on which he founded all his hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, that by holding a we&s;terly cour&s;e, he mu&s;t certainly arrive at tho&s;e regions of the ea&s;t de|&s;cribed by the ancients. His firm belief of his own &s;y&s;tem led him to take that cour&s;e, and to pur&s;ue it without deviation.</P>
<P>THE Spaniards are not the only people who have called in que&s;|tion Columbus's claim to the honour of having di&s;covered Ame|rica. Some German authors a&s;cribe this honour to Martin Be|haim, their countryman. He was of the noble family of the Behaims of Schwartzbach, citizens of the fir&s;t rank in the Im|perial town of Nuremberg. Having &s;tudied under the celebrated John Muller, better known by the name of Regiomontanus, he acquired &s;uch knowledge of co&s;mography, as excited a de&s;ire of exploring tho&s;e regions, the &s;ituation and qualities of which he had been accu&s;tomed, under that able ma&s;ter, to inve&s;tigate and de&s;cribe. Under the patronage of the duche&s;s of Burgundy he repaired to Li&s;bon, whither the fame of the Portugue&s;e di&s;coveries invited all the adventurous &s;pirits of the age. There, as we learn from Herman Schedel, of who&s;e <HI>Chronicon Mundi</HI> a German tran&s;lation was printed at Nuremberg, A. D. 1493, his merit as a co&s;mographer rai&s;ed him, in conjunction with Diego Cano, to the command of a &s;quadron fitted out for di&s;covery in the year 1483. In that voyage, he is &s;aid to have di&s;covered the kingdom of Congo. He &s;ettled in the i&s;land of Fayal, one of the Azores, and was a particular friend of Columbus. Herrera, dec. 1. lib. i. c. 2. Magellan had a terre&s;trial globe made by Behaim, on which he demon&s;trated the cour&s;e that he purpo&s;ed to hold in &s;earch of the communication with the South Sea, which he af|terwards di&s;covered. Gomara, Hi&s;t. c. 19. Herrera, dec. 11. lib. ii. c. 19. In the year 1492, Behaim vi&s;ited his relations in Nuremberg, and left with them a map drawn with his own hand, and which is &s;till pre&s;erved among the archieves of the family.

but from more full and accurate information, communicated to me by the learned Dr. John Reinold For&s;ter, I am now &s;atisfied that I was mi&s;taken. Dr. For&s;ter has been likewi&s;e &s;o good as to favour me with a copy of Behaim's map, as publi&s;hed by Dop|pelmayer in his account of the Mathematicians and Arti&s;ts of Nuremberg. From this map, the imperfection of co&s;mographi|cal knowledge at that period is manife&s;t. Hardly one place is laid down in its true &s;ituation. Nor can I di&s;cover from it any rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that Behaim had the lea&s;t knowledge of any re|gion in America. He delineates, indeed, an i&s;land to which he gives the name of St. Brandon. This, it is imagined, may be &s;ome part of Guiana, &s;uppo&s;ed at fir&s;t to be an i&s;land. He places it in the &s;ame latitude with the Cape Verd i&s;les, and I &s;u&s;pect it to be an imaginary i&s;land which has been admitted into &s;ome an|cient maps on no better authority than the legend of the Iri&s;h St. Brandon or Brendan, who&s;e &s;tory is &s;o childi&s;hly fabulous, as to be unworthy of any notice.

<P>THE preten&s;ions of the Wel&s;h to the di&s;covery of America &s;eem not to re&s;t on a foundation much more &s;olid. In the twelfth century, according to Powell, a di&s;pute having ari&s;en among the &s;ons of Owen Guyneth, king of North-Wales, concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his crown, Madoc, one of their number, weary of this contention, betook him&s;elf to &s;ea in que&s;t of a more quiet &s;ettlement. He &s;teered due we&s;t, leaving Ireland to the north, and arrived in an unknown country, which appeared to him &s;o de|&s;irable, that he returned to Wales, and carried thither &s;eve|ral of his adherents and companions. This is &s;aid to have happened about the year 1170, and after that, he and his co|lony were heard of no more. But it is to be ob&s;erved, that Powell, on who&s;e te&s;timony the authenticity of this &s;tory re&s;ts, publi&s;hed his hi&s;tory above four centuries from the date of the event which he relates. Among a people as rude and illiterate as the Wel&s;h at that period, the memory of a tran&s;action &s;o remote mu&s;t have been very imperfectly pre&s;erved, and would require to be confirmed by &s;ome author of greater credit, and nearer to the aera of Madoc's voyage than Powell. Later antiquaries have indeed appealed to the te&s;timony of Meredith ap Rhees, a Wel&s;h bard, who died A. D. 1477. But he too lived at &s;uch a di&s;|tance of time from the event, that he cannot be con&s;idered as a witne&s;s of much more credit than Powell. Be&s;ides, his ver&s;es, publi&s;hed by Hakluyt, vol. iii. p. 1. convey no information, but that Madoc, di&s;&s;atisfied with his dome&s;tic &s;ituation, employed him&s;elf in &s;earching the ocean for new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But even if we admit the authenticity of Powell's &s;tory, it does not follow that the unknown country which Madoc di&s;covered by &s;teering we&s;t, in &s;uch a cour&s;e as to leave Ireland to the north, was any
<PB N="465" REF="034476_0462_0FFDD8DF0861DFC0">
part of America. The naval &s;kill of the Wel&s;h in the twelfth century was hardly equal to &s;uch a voyage. If he made any di&s;|covery at all, it is more probable that it was Madeira, or &s;ome other of the we&s;tern i&s;les. The affinity of the Wel&s;h language with &s;ome dialects &s;poken in America, has been mentioned as a circum&s;tance which confirms the truth of Madoc's voyage. But that affinity has been ob&s;erved in &s;o few in&s;tances, and in &s;ome of the&s;e is &s;o ob&s;cure, or &s;o fanciful, that no conclu&s;ion can be drawn from the ca&s;ual re&s;emblance of a &s;mall number of words. There is a bird, which, as far as is yet known, is found only on the coa&s;ts of South America, from Port De&s;ire to the Straits of Magellan. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Penguin.</HI> This word in the Wel&s;h language &s;ignifies <HI>White-head.</HI> Almo&s;t all the authors who favour the preten&s;ions of the Wel&s;h to the di&s;covery of America, mention this as an irrefragable proof of the affinity of the Wel&s;h language with that &s;poken in this region of Ame|rica. But Mr. Pennant, who has given a &s;cientific de&s;cription of the Penguin, ob&s;erves, that all the birds of this genus have black heads, "&s;o that we mu&s;t re&s;ign every hope (adds he) founded on this hypothe&s;is of retrieving the Cambrian race in the New World." Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. vol. lviii. p. 91, &amp;c. Be&s;ide this, if the Wel&s;h, towards the clo&s;e of the twelfth century, had &s;ettled in any part of America, &s;ome remains of the Chri&s;tian doc|trine and rites mu&s;t have been found among their de&s;cendants, when they were di&s;covered about three hundred years po&s;terior to their migration; a period &s;o &s;hort, that, in the cour&s;e of it, we cannot well &s;uppo&s;e that all European ideas and arts would be totally forgotten. Lord Lyttleton, in his notes to the fifth book of his Hi&s;tory of Henry II. p. 371, has examined what Powell relates concerning the di&s;coveries made by Madoc, and invalidates the truth of his &s;tory by other arguments of great weight.</P>
<P>THE preten&s;ions of the Norwegians to the di&s;covery of Ame|rica, &s;eem to be better founded than tho&s;e of the Germans or Wel&s;h. The inhabitants of Scandinavia were remarkable in the middle ages for the boldne&s;s and extent of their maritime excur|&s;ions. In 874, the Norwegians di&s;covered, and planted a co|lony in Iceland. In 982, they di&s;covered Greenland, and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ettlements there. From that, &s;ome of their naviga|tors proceeded towards the we&s;t, and di&s;covered a country more in|viting than tho&s;e horrid regions with which they were acquainted. According to their repre&s;entations, this country was &s;andy on the coa&s;ts, but in the interior parts level and covered with wood, on which account they gave it the name of <HI>Helle-land,</HI> and <HI>Mark-land,</HI> and having afterwards found &s;ome plants of the vine which bore grapes, they called it <HI>Win-land.</HI> The credit of this &s;tory re&s;ts, as far as I know, on the authority of the <HI>&s;aga,</HI> or chroni|cle of king Olaus, compo&s;ed by Snorro Sturlonides, or <HI>Sturlu&s;ons,</HI>
<PB N="466" REF="034476_0463_0FFDD8E10B8EEC60">
publi&s;hed by Perin&s;kiold at Stockholm, A. D. 1697. As Snorro was born in the year 1179, his chronicle might be compiled about two centuries after the event which he relates. His ac|count of the navigation and di&s;coveries of <HI>Biorn,</HI> and his com|panion <HI>Lief,</HI> is a very rude confu&s;ed tale, p. 104. 110. 326. It is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover from him, what part of America it was in which the Norwegians landed. According to his ac|count of the length of the days and nights, it mu&s;t have been as far north as the fifty-eighth degree of latitude, on &s;ome part of the coa&s;t of Labradore, approaching near to the entry of Hud|&s;on's Straits. Grapes, certainly, are not the production of that country. Torfeus &s;uppo&s;es that there is an error in the text, by rectifying of which, the place where the Norwegians landed may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ituated in latitude 49&deg;. But neither is that the region of the vine in America. From peru&s;ing Snorro's tale, I &s;hould think the &s;ituation of Newfoundland corre&s;ponds be&s;t with that of the country di&s;covered by the Norwegians. Grapes, however, are not the production of that barren i&s;land. Other conjectures are mentioned by M. Mallet, Introd. a l'Hi&s;t. de Dennem. 175, &amp;c. I am not &s;ufficiently acquainted with the literature of the north, to examine them. It &s;eems manife&s;t, that if the Norwegians did di&s;cover any part of America at that period, their attempts to plant colonies proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and all knowledge of it was &s;oon lo&s;t.</P>

<P>IT is remarkable, that neither Gomara nor Oviedo, the mo&s;t ancient Spani&s;h hi&s;torians of America, nor Herrera, con|&s;ider Ojeda, or his companion Ve&s;pucci, as the fir&s;t di&s;coverers of the continent of America. They uniformly a&s;cribe this ho|nour to Columbus. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed that national re&s;ent|ment again&s;t Ve&s;pucci, for de&s;erting the &s;ervice of Spain, and entering into that of Portugal, may have prompted the&s;e writers to conceal the actions which he performed. But Martyr and Benzoni, both Italians, could not be warped by the &s;ame preju|dice. Martyr was a contemporary author; he re&s;ided in the court of Spain, and had the be&s;t opportunity to be exactly inform|ed with re&s;pect to all public tran&s;actions; and yet, neither in his Decads, the fir&s;t general hi&s;tory publi&s;hed of the New World, nor in his Epi&s;tles, which contain an account of all the remark|able events of his time, does he a&s;cribe to Ve&s;pucci the honour of having fir&s;t di&s;covered the continent. Benzoni went as an adventurer to America in the year 1541, and re&s;ided there a con|&s;iderable time. He appears to have been animated with a warm zeal for the honour of Italy, his native country, and yet does not mention the exploits and di&s;coveries of Ve&s;pucci-Herrera, who compiled his general hi&s;tory of America from the mo&s;t authen|tic records, not only follows tho&s;e early writers, but accu&s;es Ve&s;pucci of fal&s;ifying the dates of both the voyages which he made to the New World, and of confounding the one with the other, in order that he might arrogate to him&s;elf the glory of having di&s;covered the continent. Her. dec. lib. iv. c. 2. He a&s;&s;erts, that in a judicial inquiry into this matter by the royal

fi&s;cal, it was proved by the te&s;timony of Ojeda him&s;elf, that he touched at Hi&s;paniola when returning to Spain from his fir&s;t voyage; whereas Ve&s;pucci gave out that they returned directly to Cadiz from the coa&s;t of Paria, and touched at Hi&s;paniola only in their &s;econd voyage; and that he had fini&s;hed the voyage in five months; whereas, according to Ve&s;pucci's account, he had employed &s;eventeen months in performing it. Viaggio primo de Am. Ve&s;pucci, p. 36. Viag &s;ecundo, p. 45. Herrera gives a more full account of this inque&s;t in another part of his decads, and to the &s;ame effect. Her dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 5. Columbus was in Hi&s;paniola when Ojeda arrived there, and had by that time come to an agreement with Roldan, who oppo&s;ed Ojeda's at|tempt to excite a new in &s;urrection, and, of con&s;equence, his voyage mu&s;t have been po&s;terior to that of the admiral. Life of Columbus, c. 28. According to Ve&s;pucci's account, he &s;et out on his fir&s;t voyage May 10th, 1497. Viag. primo, p. 6. At that time Columbus was in the court of Spain preparing for his voyage, and &s;eems to have enjoyed a con&s;iderable degree of fa|vour. The affairs of the New World were at this juncture under the direction of Antonio Torres, a friend of Columbus. It is not probable, that at that period a commi&s;&s;ion would be granted to another per&s;on, to anticipate the admiral, by undertaking a voyage which he him&s;elf intended to perform. Fon&s;eca, who patronized Ojeda, and granted the licence for his voyage, was not recalled to court, and rein&s;tated in the direction of Indian affairs, until the death of prince John, which happened Septem|ber 1497, P.

<P>AS a particular de&s;cription makes a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion than general a&s;&s;ertions, I &s;hall give one of Rio de la Plata by an eye-witne&s;s, P. Cattaneo, a Modene&s;e Je&s;uit, who landed at Buenos Ayres in 1749, and thus repre&s;ents what he felt when &s;uch new objects were fir&s;t pre&s;ented to his view. "While I re|&s;ided in Europe, and read in books of hi&s;tory or geography that the mouth of the river De la Plata was an hundred and fifty miles in breadth, I con&s;idered it as an e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ggeration, becau&s;e in this hemi&s;phere we have no example of &s;uch va&s;t rivers. When I approached its mouth, I had the mo&s;t vehement de&s;ire to a&s;certain the truth with my own eyes; and I have found the matter to be exactly as it was repre&s;ented. This I deduce particularly from one circum&s;tance: When we took our departure from Monte-Viedo, a fort &s;ituated more than a hundred miles from the mouth of the river, and where its breadth is con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, we &s;ailed a complete day before we di&s;covered the land on the oppo&s;ite bank of the river; and when we were in the middle of the channel, we could not di&s;cern land on either &s;ide, and &s;aw nothing but the &s;ky and water, as if we had been in &s;ome great ocean. Indeed, we &s;hould have taken it to be &s;ea, if the fre&s;h water of the river, which was turbid like the Po, had not &s;atis|fied us that it was a river. Moreover, at Buenos Ayres, another hundred miles up the river, and where it is &s;till much narrower,

it is not only impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cern the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, which is in|deed very low and flat; but one cannot perceive the hou&s;es or the tops of the &s;teeples in the Portugue&s;e &s;ettlement at Colonia on the other &s;ide of the river."

<P>ACOSTA is the fir&s;t philo&s;opher, as far as I know, who endeavoured to account for the different degrees of heat in the old and new continents, by the agency of the winds which blow in each. Hi&s;t. Moral. &amp;c. lib. ii. and iii. M. de Buffon adopts this theory, and has not only improved it by new ob&s;erva|tions, but has employed his amazing powers of de&s;criptive elo|quence in embelli&s;hing and placing it in the mo&s;t &s;triking light. Some remarks may be added, which tend to illu&s;trate more fully a doctrine of much importance in every inquiry concerning the temperature of various climates.</P>
<P>WHEN a cold wind blows over land, it mu&s;t in its pa&s;&s;age rob the &s;urface of &s;ome of its heat. By means of this, the coldne&s;s of the wind is abated. But if it continue to blow in the &s;ame direction, it will come, by degrees, to pa&s;s over a &s;urface already cooled, and will &s;uffer no longer any abatement of its own keen|ne&s;s. Thus as it advances over a large tract of land, it brings on all the &s;everity of inten&s;e fro&s;t.</P>
<P>LET the &s;ame wind blow over an exten&s;ive and deep &s;ea; the &s;uperficial water mu&s;t be immediately cooled to a certain degree, and the wind proportionally warmed. But the &s;uperficial and colder water becoming &s;pecifically heavier than the warmer water below it, de&s;cends; what is warmer &s;upplies its place, which, as
<PB N="475" REF="034476_0472_0FFDD8FA5D02BE18">
it comes to be cooled in its turn, continues to warm the air which pa&s;&s;es over it, or to dimini&s;h its cold. This change of the &s;uper|ficial water, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive a&s;cent of that which is warmer, and the con&s;equent &s;ucce&s;&s;ive abatement of coldne&s;s in the air, is aided by the agitation cau&s;ed in the &s;ea by the mechanical action of the wind, and al&s;o by the motion of the tides. This will go on, and the rigour of the wind will continue to dimini&s;h until the whole water is &s;o far cooled, that the water on the &s;urface is no longer removed from the action of the wind, fa&s;t enough to hinder it from being arre&s;ted by fro&s;t. Whenever the &s;urface freezes, the wind is no longer warmed from the water below, and it goes on with undimini&s;hed cold.</P>
<P>FROM tho&s;e principles, may be explained the &s;everity of winter fro&s;ts in exten&s;ive continents; their mildne&s;s in &s;mall i&s;lands, and the &s;uperior rigour of winter in tho&s;e parts of North America with which we are be&s;t acquainted. In the north-we&s;t parts of Europe, the &s;everity of winter is mitigated by the we&s;t winds, which u&s;ually blow in the months of November, December, and part of January.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, when a warm wind blows over land, it heats the &s;urface, which mu&s;t therefore cea&s;e to abate the fervour of the wind. But the &s;ame wind blowing over water, agitates it, brings up the colder water from below, and thus is continually lo&s;ing &s;omewhat of its own heat.</P>
<P>BUT the great power of the &s;ea to mitigate the heat of the wind or air pa&s;&s;ing over it, proceeds from the following circum&s;tance: that on account of the tran&s;parency of the &s;ea, its &s;urface cannot be heated to a great degree by the &s;un's rays; whereas the ground, &s;ubjected to their influence, very &s;oon acquires great heat. When, therefore, the wind blows over a torrid continent, it is &s;oon rai&s;ed to a heat almo&s;t intolerable; but during its pa&s;&s;age over an exten|&s;ive ocean, it is gradually cooled; &s;o that on its arrival at the far|the&s;t &s;hore, it is again fit for re&s;piration.</P>
<P>THOSE principles will account for the &s;ultry heats of large continents in the torrid zone; for the mild climate of i&s;lands in the &s;ame latitude; and for the &s;uperior warmth in &s;ummer, which large continents, &s;ituated in the temperate or colder zones of the earth, enjoy, when compared with that of i&s;lands. The heat of a climate depends not only upon the immediate effect of the &s;un's rays, but on their continued operation, on the effect which they have formerly produced, and which remains for &s;ome time in the ground. This is the rea&s;on why the day is warme&s;t about two in ths afternoon, the &s;ummer warme&s;t about the middle of July, and the winter colde&s;t about the middle of January.</P>
<P>THE fore&s;ts which cover America, and hinder the &s;un-beams from heating the ground, are a great cau&s;e of the temperate cli|mate in the equatorial parts. The ground, not being heated,
<PB N="476" REF="034476_0473_0FFDD8FD1D163A60">
cannot heat the air; and the leaves, which receive the rays inter|cepted from the ground, have not a ma&s;s of matter &s;ufficient to ab|&s;orb heat enough for this purpo&s;e. Be&s;ides, it is a known fact, that the vegetative power of a plant occa&s;ions a per&s;piration from the leaves in proportion to the heat to which they are expo&s;ed; and, from the nature of evaporation, this per&s;piration produces a cold in the leaf proportional to the per&s;piration. Thus the effect of the leaf in heating the air in contact with it, is prodigiou&s;ly dimini&s;hed. For tho&s;e ob&s;ervations, which throw much additional light on this curious &s;ubject, I am indebted to my ingenious friend, Mr. Robi&s;on, profe&s;&s;or of natural philo&s;ophy in the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh.</P>

Voyages by Hawke&s;worth, i. 25. Mr. Banks having landed on Terra del Fuego, in the Bay of Good Succe&s;s, latitude 55&deg;, on the &s;ixteenth of January, which corre&s;ponds to the month of July in our hemi&s;phere, two of his attendants died in one night of extreme cold, and all the party were in the mo&s;t imminent danger of peri&s;hing. Id. ii. 51, 52. By the fourteenth of March, corre&s;ponding to September in our hemi&s;phere, winter was &s;et in with rigour, and the mountains were covered with &s;now. Ibid. 72. Captain Cook, in his voyage towards the South pole, furni&s;hes new and &s;triking in&s;tances of the extraor|dinary predominance of cold in this region of the globe. "Who would have thought (&s;ays he) that an i&s;land, of no greater extent than &s;eventy leagues in circuit, &s;ituated between the latitude of 54&deg; and 55&deg;, &s;hould in the very height of &s;ummer be, in a man|ner, wholly covered, many fathoms deep, with frozen &s;now; but more e&s;pecially the S.

The very &s;ummits of the lofty mountains were ca&s;ed with &s;now and ice; but the quantity that lay in the valleys is incredible; and at the bottom of the bays, the coa&s;t was terminated by a wall of ice of con&s;iderable height." Vol. ii. p. 217.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome places of the ancient continent, an extraordinary de|gree of cold prevails in very low latitudes. Mr. Bogle, in his emba&s;&s;y to the court of the Delai Lama, pa&s;&s;ed the winter of the year 1774 at Chamnenning, in latitude 31&deg; 39&prime; N. He often found the thermometer in his room twenty-nine degrees un|der the freezing point by Fahrenheit's &s;cale; and in the middle of April the &s;tanding waters were all frozen, and heavy &s;howers of &s;now frequently fell. The extraordinary elevation of the country &s;eems to be the cau&s;e of this exce&s;&s;ive cold. In travelling from Indo&s;tan to Thibet, the a&s;cent to the &s;ummit of the Boutan Mountains is very great, but the de&s;cent on the other &s;ide is not in equal proportion. The kingdom of Thibet is an elevated re|gion, extremely bare and de&s;olate. Account of Thibet by Mr. Stewart, read in the Royal Society, p. 7. The extraordinary cold in low latitudes in America cannot be accounted for by the &s;ame cau&s;e. Tho&s;e regions are not remarkable for elevation. Some of them are countries depre&s;&s;ed and level.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t obvious and probable cau&s;e of the &s;uperior degree of cold, towards the &s;outhern extremity of America, &s;eems to be the form of the continent there. Its breadth gradually decrea&s;es

as it &s;tretches from St. Antonio &s;outhwards, and from the bay of St. Julian to the Straits of Magellan its dimen&s;ions are much contracted. On the ca&s;t and we&s;t &s;ides, it is wa&s;hed by the At|lantic and Pacific Oceans. From its &s;outhern point it is probable that a great extent of &s;ea, without any con&s;iderable tract of land, reaches to the Antarctic pole In whichever of the&s;e directions the wind blows, it is cooled before it approaches the Magellanic regions, by pa&s;&s;ing over a va&s;t body of water, nor is the land there of &s;uch extent that it can recover any con&s;iderable degree of heat in its progre&s;s over it. The&s;e circum&s;tances concur in rendering the temperature of the air in this di&s;trict of America, more &s;imilar to that of an in&s;ular, than to that of a continental climate, and hinder it from acquiring the &s;ame degree of &s;ummer heat with places in Europe and A&s;ia, in a corre&s;ponding northern latitude. The north wind is the only one that reaches this part of America, after blowing over a great continent. But from an attentive &s;urvey of its po&s;ition, this will be found to have a ten|dency, rather to dimini&s;h than augment the degree of heat. The &s;outhern extremity of America is properly the termination of the immen&s;e ridge of the Andes, which &s;tretches nearly in a direct line from north to &s;outh, through the whole extent of the conti|nent. The mo&s;t &s;ultry regions in South America, Guiana, Bra|&s;il, Paraguay, and Tucaman, lie many degrees to the ea&s;t of the Magellanic regions. The level country of Peru, which enjoys the tropical heats, is &s;ituated con&s;iderably to the we&s;t of them. The north wind then, though it blows over land, does not bring to the &s;outhern extremity of America, an increa&s;e of heat col|lected in its pa&s;&s;age over torrid regions; but before it arrives there, it mu&s;t have &s;wept along the &s;ummits of the Andes, and comes impregnated with the cold of that frozen region.</P>
<P>THOUGH it be now demon&s;trated that there is no &s;outhern continent in that region of the globe which it was &s;uppo&s;ed to occupy, it appears to be certain from Captain Cook's di&s;coveries, that there is a large tract of land near the &s;outh pole, which is the &s;ource of mo&s;t of the ice &s;pread over the va&s;t &s;outhern ocean. Vol. ii. p. 230, 239, &amp;c. Whether the influence of this remote frozen continent may reach the &s;outhern extremity of America, and affect its climate, is an inquiry not unworthy of attention.</P>

After trying various methods of exterminating the ants, they re&s;olved to implore pro|tection of the &s;aints; but as the calamity was new, they were at a lo&s;s to find out the &s;aint who could give them the mo&s;t effectual aid. They ca&s;t lots in order to di&s;cover the patron whom they &s;hould invoke. The lots decided in favour of St. Saturninus. They celebrated his fe&s;tival with great &s;olemnity, and immediate|ly, adds the hi&s;torian, the calamity began to abate. Herrera, dec. 2. lib. iii. c. 15. p. 107.</P>

<P>WERE this the place for entering into a long and intricate geographical di&s;qui&s;ition, many curious ob&s;ervations might ari&s;e from comparing the accounts of the two Ru&s;&s;ian voy|ages, and the charts of their re&s;pective navigations. One remark is applicable to both. We cannot rely with ab&s;olute certainty on the po&s;ition which they a&s;&s;ign to &s;everal of the places which they vi&s;ited. The weather was &s;o extremely foggy, that they &s;eldom &s;aw the &s;un or &s;tars, and the po&s;ition of the i&s;lands and &s;uppo&s;ed continents was commonly determined by reckoning, not by ob&s;er|vation.

Behring and T&s;chirikow proceeded much farther towards the ea&s;t than Krenitzin. The land di&s;covered by Behring, which he imagined to be the American continent, is in the 236th degree of longitude from the fir&s;t meridian in the i&s;le of Ferro, and in 58&deg; 28&prime; of latitude. T&s;chirikow came upon the &s;ame coa&s;t in lon. 241&deg;, lat. 56&deg;. Muller, i. 248, 249. The former mu&s;t have advanced 60 degrees from the port of Petropawlow&s;ki, from which he took his departure, and the latter 65 degrees. But from the chart of Krenitzin's voyage, it appears that he did not &s;ail farther towards the ea&s;t than the 208th de|gree, and only 32 degrees from Petropawlow&s;ki. In 1741, Behring and T&s;chirikow, both in going and returning, held a cour&s;e which was mo&s;tly to the &s;outh of that chain of i&s;lands, which they di&s;covered; and ob&s;erving the mountainous and rugged a&s;pect of the head-lands which they de&s;cried towards the north, they &s;uppo&s;ed them to be promontories belonging to &s;ome part of the American continent, which, as they fancied, &s;tretched as far South. as the latitude 56. In this manner they are laid down in the chart publi&s;hed by Muller, and likewi&s;e in a manu&s;cript chart drawn by a mate of Behring's &s;hip, communicated to me by Mr. Profe&s;&s;or Robi&s;on. But in 1769, Krenitzin, after wintering in the i&s;land Alaxa, &s;tood &s;o far towards the north in his return, that his cour&s;e lay through the middle of what Behring and T&s;chirikow had &s;up|po&s;ed to be a continent, which he found to be an open &s;ea, and that they had mi&s;taken rocky i&s;les for the head-lands of a continent. It is probable, that the countries di&s;covered in 1741, towards the ea&s;t, do not belong to the American continent, but are only a con|tinuation of the chain of i&s;lands. The number of volcanos in this region of the globe is remarkable. There are &s;everal in Kamchatka, and not one of the i&s;lands, great or &s;mall, as far as the Ru&s;&s;ian navigation extends, is without them. Many are ac|tually burning, and the mountains in all bear parts of having been once in a &s;tate of eruption. Were I di&s;po&s;ed to admit &s;uch con|jectures as have found place in other enquiries concerning the peopling of America, I might &s;uppo&s;e that this part of the earth, having manife&s;tly &s;uffered violent convul&s;ions from earthquakes and volcanos, an i&s;thmus, which may have formerly united A&s;ia to America, has been broken, and formed into a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands by the &s;hock.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ingular, that at the very time the Ru&s;&s;ian navigators were attempting to make di&s;coveries in the north-we&s;t of America, the Spaniards were pro&s;ecuting the &s;ame de&s;ign from another quarter. In 1769, two &s;mall ve&s;&s;els &s;ailed from Loretto in California to ex|plore the coa&s;ts of the country to the north of that penin&s;ula. They advanced no farther than the port of Monte-Rey in latitude 36. But, in &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive expeditions fitted out from the port of St. Blas in New Galicia, the Spaniards have advanced as

But as the journals of tho&s;e voyages have not yet been publi&s;hed, I cannot compare their progre&s;s with that of the Ru&s;&s;ians, or &s;hew how near the navigators of the two nations have approached to each other.

<P>OUR knowledge of the vicinity of the two continents of A&s;ia and America, which was very imperfect when I publi&s;hed the hi&s;tory of America in the year 1777, is now complete. Mr. Cox's Account of the Ru&s;&s;ian di&s;coveries between A&s;ia and Ame|rica, printed in the year 1780, contains many curious and impor|tant facts with re&s;pect to the various attempts of the Ru&s;&s;ians to open a communication with the New World. The Hi&s;tory of the great Voyage of Di&s;covery, begun by Captain Cook in 1776, and completed by Captains Clerk and Gore, publi&s;hed in the year 1780, communicates all the information that the curio&s;ity of man|kind could de&s;ire with regard to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>AT my reque&s;t, my friend Mr. Playfair, Profe&s;&s;or of Mathe|maticks in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, has compared the narra|tive and charts of tho&s;e illu&s;trious navigators, with the more im|perfect relations and maps of the Ru&s;&s;ians. The re&s;ult of this compari&s;on I communicate in his own words, and with much greater confidence in his &s;cientific accuracy, that I could have ventured to place in any ob&s;ervations which I my&s;elf might have made upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>"THE di&s;coveries of Captain Cook in his la&s;t voyage, have confirmed the conclu&s;ions which Dr. Robert&s;on had drawn, and have connected together the facts from which they were deduced. They have now rendered it certain that Behring and T&s;chirikow touched on the coa&s;t of America in 1741. The former di&s;covered land in lat. 58&deg; 28&prime;, and about 236&deg; ea&s;t from Ferro. He has given &s;uch a de&s;cription of the Bay in which he anchored, and the high mountain to the we&s;tward of it, which he calls St. Elias, that though the account of his voyage is much abridged in the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation, Captain Cook recog|nized the place as he &s;ailed along the We&s;tern coa&s;t of America, in the year 1778. The i&s;le of St. Hermogenes, near the mouth of Cook's river, Schumagins I&s;les on the coa&s;t of Ala&s;hka, and Foggy i&s;le, retain in Captain Cook's chart the names which they had received from the Ru&s;&s;ian navigator. Cook's Voy. vol. ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">17.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="034476_0482_0FFDD915030FEF80">"TSCHIRIKOW came upon the &s;ame coa&s;t about 2&deg; 30&prime; far|ther &s;outh than Behring, near the Mount Edgecumbe of Captain Cook.</P>
<P>"WITH regard to Krenitzin, we learn from Coxe's Account of the Ru&s;&s;ian Di&s;coveries, that he &s;ailed from the mouth of the Kamtchatka river with two &s;hips in the year 1768. With his own &s;hip he reached the i&s;land Oonola&s;hka, in which there had been a Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ettlement &s;ince the year 1762, where he wintered probably in the &s;ame harbour or bay where Captain Cook afterwards anchored. The other &s;hip wintered at Ala&s;hka, which was &s;up|po&s;ed to be an i&s;land, though it be in fact a part of the American continent. Krenitzin, accordingly, returned without knowing that either of his &s;hips had been on the coa&s;t of America; and this is the more &s;urpri&s;ing, becau&s;e Captain Cook has informed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s that Ala&s;hka is under&s;tood to be a great continent both by the Ru&s;&s;ians and the natives at Oonola&s;hka.</P>
<P>"ACCORDING to Krenitzin, the &s;hip which had wintered at Ala&s;hka had hardly &s;ailed 32&deg; to the ea&s;tward of the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul in Kamtchatka; but, according to the more accurate charts of Captain Cook, it had &s;ailed no le&s;s than 37&deg; 17&prime; to the ea&s;tward of that harbour. There is nearly the &s;ame mi&s;take of 5&deg; in the longitude which Krenitzin a&s;&s;igns to Oonola&s;hka. It is remarkable enough, that in the chart of tho&s;e &s;eas, put into the hands of Captain Cook by the Ru&s;&s;ians on that i&s;land, there was an error of the &s;ame kind, and very nearly of the &s;ame extent.</P>
<P>"BUT what is of mo&s;t con&s;equence to be remarked on this &s;ubject is, that the di&s;coveries of Captain Cook have fully veri|fied Dr. Robert&s;on's conjecture, "that it is probable that future navigators in tho&s;e &s;eas, by &s;teering farther to the north than Beh|ring and T&s;chirikow or Krenitzin had done, may find that the continent of America approaches &s;till nearer to that of A&s;ia." Vol. ii. p. 44. It has accordingly been found that the&s;e two con|tinents, which in the parallel of 55&deg;, or that of the &s;outhern ex|tremity of Ala&s;hka, are about four hundred leagues a&s;under, ap|proach continually to one another as they &s;tretch together toward the north, until, within le&s;s than a degree from the polar circle, they are terminated by two capes, only thirteen leagues di&s;tant. The ea&s;t cape of A&s;ia is in latitude 66&deg; 6&prime;, and in longitude 190&deg; 22&prime; ea&s;t from Greenwich, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he we&s;tern extremity of America, or Prince of Wales Cape, is in latitude 65&deg; 46&prime;, and in longitude 191&deg; 45&prime;. Nearly in the middle of the narrow &s;trait (Behring's Strait) which &s;eparates the&s;e capes, are the two i&s;lands of St. Diomede, from which both continents may be &s;een. Captain King informs us; that as he was &s;ailing through this &s;trait July 5, 1779, the fog having cleared away, he enjoyed the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing from the &s;hip the continents of A&s;ia and America at the &s;ame mo|ment,
<PB N="486" REF="034476_0483_0FFDD916CE3C5D08">
together with the i&s;lands of St. Diomede lying between them. Cook's Voy. vol. iii. p. 244.</P>
<P>"BEYOND this point the &s;trait opens towards the Arctic Sea, and the coa&s;ts of A&s;ia and America diverge &s;o fa&s;t from one ano|ther, that in the parallel of 69&deg; they are more than one hundred leagues a&s;under. Ib. p. 277. To the &s;outh of the &s;trait there are a number of i&s;lands, Clerke's Kings, Ander&s;on's, &amp;c. which, as well as tho&s;e of St. Diomede, may have facilitated the migra|tions of the natives from the one continent to the other. Captain Cook, however, on the authority of the Ru&s;&s;ians at Oonola&s;hka, and for other good rea&s;ons, has dimini&s;hed the number of i&s;lands which had been in&s;erted in former charts of the northern Archi|pelago. He has al&s;o placed Ala&s;hka, or the promontory which &s;tretches from the continent of America S. W. towards Kamt|chatka, at the di&s;tance of five degrees of longitude farther from the coa&s;t of A&s;ia than it was reckoned by the Ru&s;&s;ian naviga|tors.</P>
<P>"THE geography of the Old and the New World is therefore equally indebted to the di&s;coveries made in this memorable voyage; and as many errors have been corrected, and many deficiencies &s;upplied by means of the&s;e di&s;coveries, &s;o the accuracy of &s;ome former ob&s;ervations has been e&s;tabli&s;hed. The ba&s;is of the map of the Ru&s;&s;ian Empire, as far as regarded Kamtchatka, and the country of the T&s;chutzki, was the po&s;ition of four places, Yak|ut&s;h, Ochotz, Bolchere&s;k, and Petropawlow&s;ki, which had been determined by the a&s;tronomer Kra&s;&s;ilnicow in the year 1744. Nov. Coment. Petrop. vol. iii. p. 465, &amp;c. But the accuracy of his ob&s;ervations was conte&s;ted by M. Engel, and Mr. Robert de Vaugondy; Coxe Append. i. No. 2. p. 267, 272; and the former of the&s;e geographers ventured to take away no le&s;s than 28 degrees from the longitude, which, on the faith of Kra&s;&s;ilnicow's ob&s;ervations, was a&s;&s;igned to the ea&s;tern boundary of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. With how little rea&s;on this was done, will appear from con&s;idering that our Briti&s;h navigators, having determined the po|&s;ition of Petropawlow&s;ki by a great number of very accurate ob|&s;ervations, found the longitude of that port 158&deg; 43&prime; E. from Greenwich, and its latitude 53&deg; 1&prime;; agreeing, the fir&s;t to le&s;s than &s;even minutes, and the &s;econd to le&s;s than half a minute, with the calculations of the Ru&s;&s;ian a&s;tronomer: a coincidence which, in the &s;ituation of &s;o remote a place, does not leave an uncertainty of more than four Engli&s;h miles, and which, for the credit of &s;cience, de&s;erves to be particularly remarked. The chief error in the Ru&s;&s;ian maps has been in not extending the boundaries of that empire &s;ufficiently towards the ea&s;t. For as there was nothing to connect the land of the T&s;chutzki and north ea&s;t point of A&s;ia with tho&s;e places whereof the po&s;ition had been carefully a&s;certained, except the imperfect accounts of Beh|ring's
<PB N="487" REF="034476_0484_0FFDD91A6E870E78">
and Synd's voyages, con&s;iderable errors could not fail to be introduced, and that point was laid down as not more than 23&deg; 2&prime; ea&s;t of the meridian of Petropawlow&s;ki. Coxe App. i. No. 2. By the ob&s;ervations of Captain King, the difference of longitude between Petropawlo&s;ki and the Ea&s;t Cape is 31&deg; 9&prime;; that is 8&deg; 7&prime; greater than it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be by the Ru&s;&s;ian geographers." It appears from Cook's and King's Voy. iii. p. 272. that the con|tinents of A&s;ia and America are u&s;ually joined together by ice during winter. Mr. Samwell confirms this account of his &s;upe|rior officer. "At this place, viz. near the latitude of 66&deg; N. the two coa&s;ts are only thirteen leagues a&s;under, and about mid|way between them lie two i&s;lands, the di&s;tance from which to either &s;hore is &s;hort of twenty miles. At this place&punc; the natives of A&s;ia could find no difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing over to the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t. which is in &s;ight of their own. That in a cour&s;e of years &s;uch an event would happen, either through de&s;ign or accident, cannot ad|mit of a doubt. The canoes which we &s;aw among the T&s;chutz&s;ki were capable of performing a much longer voyage; and, however rude they may have been at a di&s;tant period&punc; we can &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;e them unequal to a pa&s;&s;age of &s;ix or &s;even leagues. People might have been carried over by accident on floating pieces of ice. They might have al&s;o travelled acro&s;s on &s;ledges or on foot; for we have rea&s;on to believe that the &s;trait is entirely frozen over in the winter; &s;o that during that &s;ea&s;on, the continents, with re&s;pect to the communication between them, may be con&s;idered as one land." Letter from Mr. Samwell, Scots Magazine for 1788, p. 604. It is probable that this intere&s;ting portion of geo|graphical knowledge will, in the cour&s;e of a few years, receive farther improvement. Soon after the publication of Capt. Cook's la&s;t voyage, the great and enlightened Sovereign of Ru&s;&s;ia, atten|tive to every thing that may contribute to extend the bounds of &s;cience, or to render it more accurate, formed the plan of a new voyage of di&s;covery, in order to explore tho&s;e parts of the ocean lying between A&s;ia and America, which Captain Cook did not vi&s;it, to examine more accurately the i&s;lands which &s;tretch from one continent almo&s;t to the other, to &s;urvey the north-ea&s;t coa&s;t of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, from the mouth of the Kovyma, or Ko|lyma, to the North Cape, and to &s;ettle, by a&s;tronomical ob&s;erva|tions, the po&s;ition of each place worth notice. The conduct of this important enterprize is committed to Captain Billings, an Engli&s;h officer in the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ervice, of who&s;e abilities for that &s;tation it will be deemed the be&s;t evidence, that he accompanied Captain Cook in his la&s;t voyage. To render the expedition more exten&s;ively u&s;eful, an eminent naturali&s;t is appointed to attend Captain Billings. Six years will be requi&s;ite for accompli&s;hing the purpo&s;es of the voyage.

<P>FEW travellers have had &s;uch opportunity of ob&s;erving the na|tives of America, in its various di&s;tricts, as Don Antonio Ulloa. In a work lately publi&s;hed by him, he thus de&s;cribes the characteri&s;tical features of the race:" a very &s;mall forehead, co|vered with hair towards its extremities, as far as the middle of the eye-brows; little eyes, a thin no&s;e, &s;mall and bending to|wards the upper lip; the countenance broad; the ears large; the hair very black, lank, and coar&s;e; the limbs well turned, the feet &s;mall, the body of ju&s;t proportion; and altogether &s;mooth and free from hair, until old age, when they acquire &s;ome beard, but never on the cheeks." Noticias Americanas, &amp;c. p. 307. M. le Chevalier de Pinto, who re&s;ided &s;everal years in a part of America which Ulloa never vi&s;ited, gives a &s;ketch of the general 2a&s;pect of the Indians there. "They are all of copper colour, with &s;ome diver&s;ity of &s;hade, not in proportion to their di&s;tance from the equator, but according to the degree of elevation of the territory which they inhabit. Tho&s;e who live in a high country are fairer than tho&s;e in the mar&s;hy low lands on the coa&s;t. Their face is round, farther removed, perhaps, than that of any people from an oval &s;hape. Their forehead is &s;mall, the extremity of their ears far from the face, their lips thick, their no&s;e flat, their eyes black, or of a che&s;nut colour. &s;mall. but capable of di&s;cern|ing objects at a great di&s;tance. Their hair is always thick and &s;leek, and without any tendency to curl. They have no hair on any part of their body but the head. At the fir&s;t a&s;pect, a &s;outhern American appears to be mild and innocent, but on a more atten|tive view, one di&s;covers in his countenance &s;omething wild, di&s;|tru&s;tful, and &s;ullen.'

No crew of white people, or even of negroes, would be found equal to a ta&s;k of &s;uch per&s;evering fa|tigue, as the Portugue&s;e have experienced, and yet the Indians, being accu&s;tomed to this labour from their infancy, perform it.

<P>AS the view which I have given of rude nations is extremely different from that exhibited by very re&s;pectable authors, it may be proper to produce &s;ome of the many authorities on which I found my de&s;cription. The manners of the &s;avage tribes in America have never been viewed by per&s;ons more capable of ob|&s;erving them with di&s;cernment, than the philo&s;ophers employed by France and Spain, in the year 1735, to determine the figure of the earth. M. Bouguer, D. Antonio d'Ulloa, and D. Jorge Juan, re&s;ided long among the natives of the lea&s;t civilized provin|ces in Peru. M. de la Condamine had not only the &s;ame advan|tages with them for ob&s;ervation, but, in his voyage down the Maragnon, he had an opportunity of in&s;pecting the &s;tate of the various nations &s;eated on its banks, in its va&s;t cour&s;e acro&s;s the continent of South America. There is a wounderful re&s;emblance in their repre&s;entation of the character of the Americans. "They are all extremely indolent," &s;ays M. Bouguer, "they are &s;tupid, they pa&s;s whole days &s;itting in the &s;ame place, without moving, or &s;peaking a &s;ingle word. It is not ea&s;y to de&s;cribe the degree of their indifference for wealth, and all its advantages. One does not well know what motive to propo&s;e to them, when one would per&s;uade them to perform any &s;ervice. It is vain to offer them money; they an&s;wer, that they are not hungry." Voyage au Perou, p. 102. "If one con&s;iders them as men, the narrowne&s;s of their under&s;tanding &s;eems to be incompatible with the excellence of the &s;oul. Their imbecility is &s;o vi&s;ible, that one can hardly form an idea of them different from what one has of the brutes. Nothing di&s;turbs the tranquillity of their &s;ouls equally

in&s;en&s;ible to di&s;a&s;ters and to pro&s;perity. Though half-naked, they are as contented as a monarch in his mo&s;t &s;plendid array. Riches do not attract them in the &s;malle&s;t degree, and the autho|rity or dignities to which they may a&s;pire are &s;o little the objects of their ambition, that an Indian will receive with the &s;ame in|difference the office of a judge (Alcade) or that of a hangman, if deprived of the former and appointed to the latter. Nothing can move or change them. Intere&s;t has no power over them, and they often refu&s;e to perform a &s;mall &s;ervice, though certain of a great recompence. Fear makes no impre&s;&s;ion on them, and re&s;|pect as little. Their di&s;po&s;ition is &s;o &s;ingular that there is no me|thod of influencing them, no means of rou&s;ing them from that in|difference, which is proof again&s;t all the endeavours of the wi&s;e&s;t per&s;ons; no expedient which can induce them to abandon that gro&s;s ignorance, or lay a&s;ide that carele&s;s negligence, which di&s;|concert the prudence and di&s;appoint the care of &s;uch as are atten|tive to their welfare." Voyage d'Ulloa, tom. i. 335, 356. Of tho&s;e &s;ingular qualities he produces many extraordinary in&s;tances, p 336&mdash;347. "In&s;en&s;ibility," &s;ays M. de la Condamine, "is the ba&s;is of the American character. I leave others to determine, whether this &s;hould be dignified with the name of apathy, or di&s;|graced with that of &s;tupidity. It ari&s;es, without doubt, from the &s;mall number of their ideas, which do not extend beyond their wants. Gluttons even to voracity, when they have wherewithal to &s;atisfy their appetite. Temperatc, when nece&s;&s;ity obliges them to &s;uch a degree, that they can endure want without &s;eeming to de&s;ire any thing. Pu&s;illanimous and cowardly to exce&s;s, unle&s;s when they are rendered de&s;perate by drunkenne&s;s. Aver&s;e to labour, indifferent to motives of glory, honour or gratitude; occupied entirely by the object that is pre&s;ent, and always determi|ned by it alone, without any &s;olicitude about futurity; incapable of fore&s;ight or of reflection; abandoning them&s;elves&punc; when under no re&s;traint, to a puerile joy, which they expre&s;s by fri&s;king about, and immoderate fits of laughter; without object or de&s;ign, they pa&s;s their life without thinking, and grow old without advancing beyond childhood, of which they retain all the defects. If this de&s;cription were applicable only to the Indians in &s;ome provinces of Peru, who are &s;laves in every re&s;pect but the name, one might believe, that this degree of degeneracy was occa&s;ioned by the &s;er|vile dependence to which they are reduced; the example of the modern Greeks being proof how far &s;ervitude may degrade the human &s;pecies. But the Indians in the mi&s;&s;ions of the Je&s;uits, and the &s;avages who &s;till enjoy unimpaired liberty, being as limited in their faculties, not to &s;ay as &s;tupid as the other, one cannot ob|&s;erve&punc; without humiliation, that man, when abandoned to &s;imple nature, and deprived of the advantages re&s;ulting from education and &s;ociety, differs but little from the brute creation."

de la Riv. de Amaz. 52, 53. M. de Chanvalon, an intelligent and philo&s;ophical ob&s;erver, who vi&s;ited Martinico in 1751, and re&s;ided there &s;ix years, gives the following de&s;cription of the Ca|raibs: "It is not the red colour of their complexion&punc; it is not the &s;ingularity of their features, which con&s;titute the chief difference between them and us. It is their exce&s;&s;ive &s;implicity; it is the li|mited degree of their faculties. Their rea&s;on is not more enlight|ened or more provident than the in&s;tinct of brutes. The rea&s;on of the mo&s;t gro&s;s pea&s;ants, that of the negroes brought up in the parts of Africa mo&s;t remote from intercour&s;e with Europeans, is &s;uch that we di&s;cover appearances of intelligence, which, though imperfect, is capable of increa&s;e. But of this the under&s;tanding of Caraibs &s;eems to be hardly &s;u&s;ceptible. If &s;ound philo&s;ophy and religion did not afford us their light, if we were to decide ac|cording to the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion which the view of that people makes upon the mind, we &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to believe that they do not belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies with us. Their &s;tupid eyes are the true mirrour of their &s;ouls; it appears to be without functions. Their indolence is extreme; they have never the lea&s;t &s;olicitude about the moment which is to &s;ucceed that which is pre&s;ent." Voyage a la Martinique, p. 44, 45, 51. M. de la Borde, Tertre, and Rochefort, confirm this de&s;cription. "The characteri&s;tics of the Californians," &s;ays P. Venegas, "as well as of all other In|dians; are &s;tupidity and in&s;en&s;ibility; want of knowledge and re|flection; incon&s;tancy, impetuo&s;ity, and blindne&s;s of appetite; an exce&s;&s;ive &s;loth, and abhorrence of labour and fatigue; an exce&s;&s;ive love of plea&s;ure and amu&s;ement of every kind, however trifling or brutal; pu&s;ilanimity, and, in fine, a mo&s;t wretched want of every thing which con&s;titutes the real man, and renders him ra|tional, inventive, tractable, and u&s;eful to him&s;elf and &s;ociety. It is not ea&s;y for Europeans, who never were out of their own coun|try, to conceive an adequate idea of tho&s;e people; for, even in the lea&s;t frequented corners of the globe, there is not a nation &s;o &s;tu|pid, of &s;uch contracted ideas, and &s;o weak both in body and mind, as the unhappy Californians. Their under&s;tanding comprehends little more than what they &s;ee; ab&s;tract ideas, and much le&s;s a chain of rea&s;oning, being far beyond their power; &s;o that they &s;carce ever improve their fir&s;t ideas, and the&s;e are in general fal&s;e, or at lea&s;t inadequate. It is in vain to repre&s;ent to them any future advantages which will re&s;ult to them from doing or ab&s;taining from this or that particular immediately pre&s;ent; the relation of means and ends being beyond the &s;tretch of their faculties. Nor have they the lea&s;t notion of pur&s;uing &s;uch intentions as will procure them&s;elves &s;ome future good, or guard them again&s;t future evils. Their will is proportional to their faculties, and all their pa&s;&s;ions move in a very narrow &s;phere. Ambition they have none, and are more de&s;irous of being accounted &s;trong than valiant. The

objects of ambition with us honour, &s;ame, reputation, titles, po&s;ts, and di&s;tinctions of &s;uperiority, are unknown among them; &s;o that this powerful &s;pring of action, the cau&s;e of &s;o much &s;eeming good and real evil in the world, has no power here. This di&s;po&s;ition of mind, as it gives them up to an amazing langour and la&s;&s;itude, their lives fleeting away in a perpetual inactivity and dete&s;tation of la|bour, &s;o it likewi&s;e induces them to be attracted by the fir&s;t object which their own fancy, or the per&s;ua&s;ion of another, places before them; and at the &s;ame time renders them as prone to alter their re&s;olutions with the &s;ame facility. They look with indifference upon any kindne&s;s done them; nor is even the bare remembrance of it to be expected from them.

<P>NEW HOLLAND, a country which formerly was only known, has lately been vi&s;ited by intelligent ob&s;ervers. It lies in a region of the globe where it mu&s;t enjoy a very favourable climate, as it &s;tretches from the 10th to the 38th degree of nor|thern latitude. It is of great extent, and from its &s;quare form mu&s;t be much more than equal to all Europe. The people who inhabit the various parts of it appear to be of one race. They are evidently ruder than mo&s;t of the Americans, and have made &s;till le&s;s progre&s;s in improvement and the arts of life. There is not the lea&s;t appearance of cultivation in any part of this va&s;t re|gion. The inhabitants are extremely few &s;o that the country appears almo&s;t de&s;olate. Their tribes are &s;till more incon&s;iderable than tho&s;e of America. They depend for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence almo&s;t en|tirely on fi&s;hing. They do not &s;ettle in one place but roam about in que&s;t of food. Both &s;exes go &s;tark-naked. Their habitations, uten&s;ils, &amp;c. are more &s;imple and rude than tho&s;e of the Ameri|cans. Voyages, by Hawke&s;worth, iii. 622, &amp;c. This, perhaps, is the country where man has been di&s;covered in the earlie&s;t &s;tage of his progre&s;s, and it exhibits a mi&s;erable &s;pecimen of his condi|tion and powers in that uncultivated &s;tate.

<P>I STRONGLY &s;u&s;pect that a community of goods, and an undivided &s;tore, are known only among the rude&s;t tribes of hunters; and that as &s;oon as any &s;pecies of agriculture or regular indu&s;try is known, the idea of an exclu&s;ive right of property to the fruits of them is introduced. I am confirmed in this opinion by accounts which I have received concerning the &s;tate of proper|ty among the Indians in very different regions of America. "The idea of the natives of Bra&s;il concerning property is, that if any per&s;on cultivate a field, he alone ought to enjoy the produce of it, and no other has a title to pretend to it. If an individual or family go a-hunting or fi&s;hing, what is caught belongs to the individual or to the family&punc; and they communicate no part of it to any but to their cazique, or to &s;uch of their kindred as happen to be indi&s;po&s;ed. If any per&s;on in the village come to their hut, he may &s;it down freely, and eat without a&s;king liberty. But this is the con&s;equence of their general principle of ho&s;pita|lity; for I never ob&s;erved any partition of the increa&s;e of their fields, or the produce of the chace, which I could con&s;ider as the re&s;ult of any idea concerning a community of goods.
<PB N="500" REF="034476_0497_0FFDD94EADAF2CD8">
On the contrary, they are &s;o much attached to what they deem to be their property, that it would be extremely dangerous to encroach upon it. As far as I have &s;een, or can learn, there is not one tribe of Indians in South America, among whom that community of goods which has been &s;o highly extolled is known. The circum&s;tance in the go|vernment of the Je&s;uits, mo&s;t irk&s;ome to the Indians of Paraguay, was the community of goods which tho&s;e fathers introduced. This was repugnant to the original ideas of the Indians. They were acquainted with the rights of private exclu&s;ive property, and they &s;ubmitted with impatience to regulations which de&s;troyed them." M. de Cheval. de Pinto, MS. <HI>penes me.</HI> "Actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion (&s;ays a mi&s;&s;ionary who re&s;ided &s;everal years among the Indians of the Five Nations) gives a right to the &s;oil, but whenever a po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or &s;ees fit to quit it, another has as good right to take it as he who left it. This law, or cu&s;tom, re&s;pects not only the particu|lar &s;pot on which he erects his hou&s;e, but al&s;o his planting-ground. If a man has prepared a particular &s;pot of ground, on which he de&s;igns in future to build or plant, no man has a right to incom|mode him, much le&s;s to the fruit of his labours, until it appears that he voluntarily gives up his views. But I never heard of any formal conveyance from one Indian to another in their natural &s;tate. The limits of every canton is circum&s;cribed; that is, they are allowed to hunt as far as &s;uch a river on this hand, and &s;uch a mountain on the other. This area is occupied and improved by individuals and their families. Individuals, not the community, have the u&s;e and profit of their own labours, or &s;ucce&s;s in hunting."

"They are much addicted to war (&s;ays he) which they carry on frequent|ly among them&s;elves, but perpetually again&s;t the Spaniards.

The&s;e &s;pies&punc; in order that they may not be ob&s;erved, will creep on all-four like cats in the night; but if they are di&s;|covered, make their e&s;cape with much dexterity.

<P>A PROBABLE conjecture may be formed with re&s;pect to the cau&s;e of the di&s;tinction in character between the Carib|bees and the inhabitants of the larger i&s;lands. The former appear manife&s;tly to be a &s;eparate race. Their language is totally dif|ferent from that of their neighbours in the large i&s;lands. They them&s;elves have a tradition, that their ance&s;tors came originally from &s;ome part of the continent, and having conquered and ex|terminated the ancient inhabitants, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lands, and of their women. Rochefort, 384. Tertre, 360. Hence they call them&s;elves <HI>Banaree,</HI> which &s;ignifies a man come from beyond &s;ea. Labat. vi. 131. Accordingly, the Caribbees &s;till u&s;e two di&s;tinct languages, one peculiar to the men and the other to the women. Tertre, 361. The language of the men has no|thing common with that &s;poken in the large i&s;lands. The dialect of the women con&s;iderably re&s;embles it. Labat. 129. This &s;trongly confirms the tradition which I have mentioned. The Carribees them&s;elves imagine, that they were a colony from the <HI>Galibis,</HI> a powerful nation of Guiana, in South America. Tertre, 361. Rochefort, 348. But as their fierce manners approach nearer to tho&s;e of the people in the northern continent, than to tho&s;e of the natives of South America; and as their language has likewi&s;e &s;ome affinity to that &s;poken in Florida, their origin &s;hould be deduced rather from the former than from the latter. Labat. 128, &amp;c. Herrera, dec. i. lib. ix. c. 4.

nor &s;uch vigour and activity of mind, as to under|take in per&s;on the conduct of the armament which he was preparing. In this embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ituation, he formed the chimerical &s;cheme, not only of atchieving great exploits by a deputy, but of &s;e|curing to him&s;elf the glory of conque&s;ts which were to be made by another. In the execution of this plan, he fondly aimed at reconciling contra|dictions.

<P>THOUGH Cortes had not hitherto acted in high command, he had di&s;played &s;uch qualities in &s;eve|ral &s;cenes of difficulty and danger, as rai&s;ed uni|ver&s;al expectation, and turned the eyes of his coun|trymen towards him, as one capable of performing great things. The turbulence of youth, as &s;oon as he found objects and occupations &s;uited to the ardour of his mind, gradually &s;ub&s;ided, and &s;ettled into a habit of regular indefatigable activity. The impetuo&s;ity of his temper, when he came to act with his equals, in&s;en&s;ibly abated, by being kept under re&s;traint, and mellowed into a cordial &s;ol|dierly frankne&s;s. The&s;e qualities were accompa|nied with calm prudence in concerting his &s;chemes, with per&s;evering vigour in executing them, and with what is peculiar to &s;uperior genius, the art of gaining the confidence and governing the minds of men. To all which were added the inferior accom|pli&s;hments that &s;trike the vulgar, and command their re&s;pect; a graceful per&s;on, a winning a&s;pect, extraordinary addre&s;s in martial exerci&s;es, and a con&s;titution of &s;uch vigour as to be capable of en|during any fatigue.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as Cortes was mentioned to Vela&s;quez by his two confidents, he flattered him&s;elf that he had at length found what he had hitherto &s;ought in vain, a man with talents for command, but not an object for jealou&s;y. Neither the rank nor the for|tune

<P>NEXT day Teutile and Pilpatoe entered the Spani&s;h camp with a numerous retinue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His fir&s;t in|terview with the Mexicans.</NOTE> and Cortes con&s;idering them as the mini&s;ters of a great mo|narch, entitled to a degree of attention very dif|ferent from that which the Spaniards were ac|cu&s;tomed to pay to the petty caziques, with whom they had intercour&s;e in the i&s;les, received them with much formal ceremony. He informed them, that he came as amba&s;&s;ador from Don Car|los of Au&s;tria, king of Ca&s;tile, the greate&s;t mo|narch of the Ea&s;t, and was intru&s;ted with propo|&s;itions of &s;uch moment, that he could impart them to none but the emperor Montezuma him&s;elf, and therefore required them to conduct him, without lo&s;s of time, into the pre&s;ence of their ma&s;ter.

But before they attempted to di&s;&s;uade Cortes from in&s;i&s;ting on this demand,
<PB N="16" REF="034476_0524_0FFDD98D2CFE91E8">
they endeavoured to conciliate his good-will, by entreating him to accept of certain pre&s;ents, which, as humble &s;laves of Montezuma, they laid at his feet. They were introduced with great parade, and con&s;i&s;ted of fine cotton cloth, of plumes of various colours, and of ornaments of gold and &s;ilver, to a con&s;iderable value; the workman&s;hip of which appeared to be as curious as the materials were rich. The di&s;play of the&s;e produced an effect very different from what the Mexicans intended. In&s;tead of &s;atisfying, it increa&s;ed the avidity of the Spaniards, and rendered them &s;o eager and impa|tient to become ma&s;ters of a country which abounded with &s;uch precious productions, that Cortes could hardly li&s;ten with patience to the ar|guments which Pilpatoe and Teutile employed to di&s;&s;uade him from vi&s;iting the capital, and in a haughty determined tone he in&s;i&s;ted on his demand, of being admitted to a per&s;onal audience of their &s;overeign. During this interview, &s;ome painters, in the train of the Mexican chiefs, had been dili|gently employed in delineating, upon white cotton cloths, figures of the &s;hips, the hor&s;es, the artil|lery, the &s;oldiers, and whatever el&s;e attracted their eyes, as &s;ingular. When Cortes ob&s;erved this, and was informed that the&s;e pictures were to be &s;ent to Montezuma, in order to convey to him a more lively idea of the &s;trange and wonderful ob|jects now pre&s;ented to their view, than any words could communicate, he re&s;olved to render the re|pre&s;entation &s;till more animated and intere&s;ting, by exhibiting &s;uch a &s;pectacle as might give both them and their monarch an awful impre&s;&s;ion of the ex|traordinary prowe&s;s of his followers, and the irre|&s;i&s;tible force of their arms. The trumpets, by his order, &s;ounded an alarm; the troops, in a moment, formed in order of battle, the infantry performed &s;uch martial exerci&s;es as were be&s;t &s;uited to di&s;play

The Mexicans looked on with that &s;ilent amaze|ment which is natural when the mind is &s;truck with objects, which are both awful and above its com|prehen&s;ion. But, at the explo&s;ion of the cannon, many of them fled, &s;ome fell to the ground, and all were &s;o much confounded at the &s;ight of men who&s;e power &s;o nearly re&s;embled that of the gods, that Cortes found it difficult to compo&s;e and re|a&s;&s;ure them.

<P>THE firmne&s;s with which Cortes adhered to his original propo&s;al,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the Mexi|can empire at that pe|riod.</NOTE> &s;hould naturally have brought the negociation between him and Montezuma to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue, as it &s;eemed to leave the Mexican monarch no choice, but either to receive him with confidence as a friend, or to oppo&s;e him openly as an enemy.

The people were warlike and enterpri&s;ing; the au|thority of the monarch unbounded, and his reve|nues con&s;iderable. If, with the forces which might have been &s;uddenly a&s;&s;embled in &s;uch an empire, Montezuma had fallen upon the Spaniards while encamped on a barren unhealthy coa&s;t, un&s;upported by any ally, without a place of retreat, and de&s;ti|tute of provi&s;ions, it &s;eems to be impo&s;&s;ible, even with all the advantages of their &s;uperior di&s;cipline and arms, that they could have &s;tood the &s;hock, and they mu&s;t either have peri&s;hed in &s;uch an un|equal conte&s;t, or have abandoned the enterpri&s;e.</P>

Nothing memorable happened in his pro|gre&s;s, until he arrived on the confines of Tla&s;cala. The inhabitants of that province, a warlike people, were implacable enemies of the Mexicans, and had been united in an ancient alliance with the caziques of Zompoalla. Though le&s;s civilized than the &s;ubjects of Montezuma, they were advanced in improvement far beyond the rude nations of Ame|rica, who&s;e manners we have de&s;cribed. They had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in agriculture; they dwelt in large towns: they were nor &s;trangers to &s;ome &s;pecies of commerce; and in the imperfect accounts of their in&s;titutions and laws, tran&s;mitted to us by the early Spani&s;h writers, we di&s;cern traces both of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice and of criminal juri&s;dic|tion, in their interior police. But &s;till, as the de|gree of their civilization was incomplete, and as they depended for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence not on agriculture alone, but tru&s;ted for it, in a great mea&s;ure, to hunting, they retained many of the qualities natu|ral to men in this &s;tate. Like them, they were fierce and revengeful; like them, too, they were high-&s;pirited and independent. In con&s;equence of the former, they were involved in peapetual ho&s;tili|ties, and had but a &s;lender and occa&s;ional inter|cour&s;e with neighbouring &s;tates. The latter in&s;pired them with &s;uch dete&s;tation of &s;ervitude, that they not only refu&s;ed to &s;toop to a foreign yoke, and maintained an ob&s;tinate and &s;ucce&s;sful conte&s;t in de|fence

In order to di&s;po&s;e them to this, four Zempoallans of great eminence were &s;ent amba&s;|&s;adors, to reque&s;t, in his name, and in that of their cazique, that they would permit the Spaniards to pa&s;s through the territories of the republic in their way to Mexico. But in&s;tead of the favourable an&s;wer which was expected, the Tla&s;calans &s;eized the amba&s;&s;adors, and, without any regard to their public character, made preparations for &s;acrificing them to their gods. At the &s;ame time, they a&s;&s;em|bled their troops, in order to oppo&s;e tho&s;e un|known invaders, if they &s;hould attempt to make their pa&s;&s;age good by force of arms. Various mo|tives concurred in precipitating the Tla&s;calans into this re&s;olution. A fierce people, &s;hut up within its own narrow precincts, and little accu&s;tomed to any intercour&s;e with foreigners, is apt to con&s;ider every &s;tranger as an enemy, and is ea&s;ily excited to arms. They concluded, from Cortes's propo&s;al of vi&s;iting Montezuma in his capital, that, not|with&s;tanding all his profe&s;&s;ions, he courted the friend&s;hip of a monarch whom they both hated and feared. The imprudent zeal of Cortes in violating the temples in Zempoalla, filled the Tla&s;calans with horror; and as they were no le&s;s attached to their

<P>THERE are &s;ome circum&s;tances, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some &s;in|gular cir|cum&s;tances in it.</NOTE> in this war, which are memorable, and merit no|tice, as they throw light upon the character both of the people of New Spain, and of their con|querors. Though the Tla&s;calans brought into the field &s;uch numerous armies as appear &s;ufficient to have overwhelmed the Spaniards, they were never able to make any impre&s;&s;ion upon their &s;mall batta|lion. Singular as this may &s;eem, it is not inexpli|cable. The Tla&s;calans, though addicted to war, were, like all unpoli&s;hed nations, &s;trangers to mi|litary order and di&s;cipline, and lo&s;t in a great mea|&s;ure the advantage which they might have derived from their numbers, and the impetuo&s;ity of their attack, by their con&s;tant &s;olicitude to carry off the dead and wounded. This point of honour, founded on a &s;entiment of tenderne&s;s natural to the human mind, and &s;trengthened by anxiety to pre|&s;erve the bodies of their countrymen from being devoured by their enemies, was univer&s;al among the people of New Spain.

<P>NOT only was their &s;uperiority in number of little avail, but the imperfection of their military weapons rendered their valour in a great mea&s;ure inoffen&s;ive. After three battles, and many &s;kir|mi&s;hes and a&s;&s;aults, not one Spaniard was killed in the field. Arrows and &s;pears, headed with flint

or the bones of fi&s;hes, &s;takes hardened in the fire, and wooden &s;words, though de&s;tructive weapons among naked Indians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1519.</NOTE> were ea&s;ily turned a&s;ide by the Spani&s;h bucklers, and could hardly penetrate the <HI>e&s;caupiles,</HI> or quilted jackets, which the &s;oldiers wore. The Tla&s;calans advanced boldly to the charge, and often fought hand to hand. Many of the Spaniards were wounded, though all &s;lightly, which cannot be imputed to any want of courage or &s;trength in their enemies, but to the defect of the arms with which they a&s;&s;ailed them.</P>

<P>WHEN they were taught by the fir&s;t encounter with their new enemies, that it was not ea&s;y to exe|cute this threat; when they perceived, in the &s;ub|&s;equent engagements, that notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of their own valour, of which they had a very high opinion, not one of the Spaniards was &s;lain or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aken, they began to conceive them a &s;upe|rior order of beings, again&s;t whom human power could not avail.

In con&s;equence of this, the Tla&s;calans, with the im|plicit confidence of men who fancy them&s;elves to be under the guidance of heaven, acted in con|tradiction to one of their mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims in war, and ventured to attack the enemy, with a &s;trong body, in the night-time, in hopes of de&s;troy|ing them when enfeebled and &s;urpri&s;ed. But Cortes had greater vigilance and di&s;cernment than to be deceived by the rude &s;tratagems of an Indian army. The centinels at his out po&s;ts, ob&s;erving &s;ome ex|traordinary movement among the Tla&s;calans, gave the alarm. In a moment the troops were under arms, and &s;allying out, di&s;per&s;ed the party with great &s;laughter, without allowing it to approach the camp.

A long conference en&s;ued, in which Cortes learned what was the opinion of Montezuma with re&s;pect to the Spaniards. It was an e&s;tabli&s;hed tradition, he told him, among the Mexicans, that their an|ce&s;tors came originally from a remote region, and conquered the provinces now &s;ubject to his domi|nion; that after they were &s;ettled there, the great captain who conducted this colony returned to his own country, promi&s;ing, that at &s;ome future period his de&s;cendants &s;hould vi&s;it them, a&s;&s;ume the go|vernment, and reform their con&s;titution and laws; that, from what he had heard and &s;een of Cortes and his followers, he was convinced that they were the very per&s;ons who&s;e appearance the Mexican traditions and prophecies taught them to expect; that accordingly he had received them, not as &s;trangers, but as relations of the &s;ame blood and parentage, and de&s;ired that they might con&s;ider them&s;elves as ma&s;ters in his dominions, for both him&s;elf and his &s;ubjects &s;hould be ready to comply with their will, and even to prevent their wi&s;hes. Cortes made a reply in his u&s;ual &s;tyle, with re&s;pect to the dignity and power of his &s;overeign, and his intention in &s;ending him into that country; artfully endeavouring &s;o to frame his di&s;cour&s;e, that it might coincide as much as po&s;&s;ible with the idea which Montezuma had formed concerning the ori|gin of the Spaniards. Next morning, Cortes and &s;ome of his principal attendants were admitted to a public audience of the emperor.

The Spa|niards, convinced that Qualpopoca would not have ventured to attack E&s;calante without orders from his ma&s;ter, were not &s;atisfied with inflicting venge|ance on the in&s;trument employed in committing that crime, while the author of it e&s;caped with im|punity. Ju&s;t before Qualpopoca was led but to &s;uffer, Cortes entered the apartment of Monte|zuma, followed by &s;ome of his officers, and a &s;oldier carrying a pair of fetters; and approaching the monarch with a &s;tern countenance, told him, that as the per&s;ons who were now to undergo the puni&s;h|ment which they merited, had charged him as the cau&s;e of the outrage committed, it was nece&s;|&s;ary that he likewi&s;e &s;hould make atonement for that guilt; then turning away abruptly, without waiting for a reply, commanded the &s;oldier to clap the fetters on his legs. The orders were in&s;tantly executed. The di&s;con&s;olate monarch, trained up with an idea that his per&s;on was &s;acred and invio|lable, and con&s;idering this profanation of it as the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ude of immediate death, broke out into loud lamentations and complaints. His attendants, &s;peechle&s;s with horror, fell at his feet, bathing them with their tears; and bearing up the fetters in their hands, endeavoured with officious tenderne&s;s to lighten their pre&s;&s;ure. Nor did their grief and de&s;pondency abate, until Cortes returned from the execution, and with a cheerful countenance ordered the fetters to be taken off. As Montezuma's &s;pirits had &s;unk with unmanly dejection, they now ro&s;e into indecent joy; and with an unbecoming tran|&s;ition, he pa&s;&s;ed at once from the angui&s;h of de&s;pair to tran&s;ports of gratitude and expre&s;&s;ions of fond|ne&s;s towards his deliverer.</P>

fifth was allotted to Cortes, as commander in chief. The &s;ums advanced by Vela&s;quez, by Cortes, and by &s;ome of the officers, towards de|fraying the expence of fitting out the armament, were then deducted. The remainder was divided among the army, including the garri&s;on of Vera Cruz, in proportion to their different ranks. After &s;o many defalcations, the &s;hare of a private man did not exceed a hundred pe&s;os. This &s;um fell &s;o far below their &s;anguine expectations, that &s;ome &s;oldiers rejected it with &s;corn, and others murmured &s;o lonely at this cruel di&s;appointment of their hopes, that it required all the addre&s;s of Cortes, and no &s;mall exertion of his liberality, to appea&s;e them.

What fell to the &s;hare of the general appeared, ac|cording to the ideas of wealth in the &s;ixteenth century, an enormous &s;um. Some of Cortes's fa|vourites had &s;ecretly appropriated to their own u&s;e &s;everal ornaments of gold, which neither paid the royal fifth, nor were brought into account as part of the common &s;tock.

As the con&s;umption of the precious metals was incon&s;iderable, the demand for them was not &s;uch as to put either the ingenuity or indu&s;try of the Mexicans on the &s;tretch, in order to augment their &s;tore.

<P>BUT however pliant Montezuma might be in other matters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Montezu|ma inflexi|ble with re|&s;pect to re|ligion.</NOTE> with re&s;pect to one point he was in|flexible. Though Cortes often urged him, with the importunate zeal of a mi&s;&s;ionary, to renounce his fal&s;e gods, and to embrace the Chri&s;tian faith, he always rejected the propo&s;ition with horror. Super&s;tition, among the Mexicans, was formed into &s;uch a regular and complete &s;y&s;tem, that its in&s;titutions naturally took fa&s;t hold of the mind; and while the rude tribes in other parts of America were ea&s;ily induced to relinqui&s;h a few notions and rites, &s;o loo&s;e and arbitrary as hardly to merit the name of a public religion, the Mexicans adhered tenaciou&s;ly to their mode of wor&s;hip, which, how|ever barbarous, was accompanied with &s;uch order and &s;olemnity as to render it an object of the highe&s;t veneration. Cortes, finding all his attempts inef|fectual to &s;hake the con&s;tancy of Montezuma, was &s;o much enraged at his ob&s;tinacy, that in a tran&s;port of zeal he led out his &s;oldiers to throw down the idols in the great temple by for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; But the prie&s;ts taking arms in defence of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tars, and the people crowding with great ardour to &s;upport them, Cortes's prudence overruled his zeal, and induced him to de&s;i&s;t from his ra&s;h attempt, after di&s;lodging the idols from one of the &s;hrines, and placing in their &s;tead an image of the Virgin Mary<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XVIII.</NOTE>.</P>

with Montezuma for this purpo&s;e. But as it might prove fatal to the captive monarch to attempt either the one or the other by violence, he was willing to try more gentle means.

By this means Vala&s;quez not only learned that Cortes and his followers, after formally renouncing all connection with him, had e&s;tabli&s;hed an independ|ent colony in New Spain, and were &s;oliciting the king to confirm their proceedings by his authority; but he obtained particular information concerning the opulence of the country, the valuable pre&s;ents which Cortes had received, and the inviting pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s that opened to his view.

<PB N="77" REF="034476_0585_0FFDDA204D0173D8">
the &s;ituation of Cortes to be &s;o de&s;perate, and the di&s;affection of his followers to be &s;o general, as in|crea&s;ed the natural confidence and pre&s;umption of Narvaez. His fir&s;t operation, however, might have taught him not to rely on their partial ac|counts. Having &s;ent to &s;ummon the governor of Vera Cruz to &s;urrender, Guevara, a prie&s;t whom he employed in that &s;ervice, made the requi&s;ition with &s;uch in&s;olence, that Sandoval, an officer of high &s;pirit, and zealou&s;ly attached to Cortes, in&s;tead of complying with his demands, &s;eized him and his attendants, and &s;ent them in chains to Mexico.</P>
<P>CORTES received them not like enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cortes deeply alarmed.</NOTE> but as friends, and condemning the &s;everity of Sandoval, &s;et them immediately at liberty. By this well-timed clemency, &s;econded by care&s;&s;es and pre&s;ents, he gained their confidence, and drew from them &s;uch particulars concerning the force and intentions of Narvaez, as gave him a view of the impending danger in its full extent. He had not to contend now with half-naked Indians, no match for him in war, and &s;till more inferior in the arts of policy, but to take the field again&s;t an army in courage and martial di&s;cipline equal to his own, in number far &s;uperior, acting under the &s;anction of royal autho|rity, and commanded by an officer of known bra|very. He was informed that Narvaez, more &s;oli|citous to gratify the re&s;entment of Vela&s;quez, than attentive to the honour or intere&s;t of his country, had begun his intercour&s;e with the natives, by re|pre&s;enting him and his followers as fugitives and outlaws, guilty of rebellion again&s;t their own &s;ove|reign, and of inju&s;tice in invading the Mexican empire; and had declared that his chief object in vi&s;iting the country was to puni&s;h the Spaniards who had committed the&s;e crimes, and to re&s;cue the Mexicans from oppre&s;&s;ion. He &s;oon perceived
<PB N="78" REF="034476_0586_0FFDDA22E7E3E618">
that the &s;ame unfavourable repre&s;entations of his character and actions had been conveyed to Mon|tezuma, and that Narvaez had found means to a&s;|&s;ure him, that as the conduct of tho&s;e who kept him under re&s;traint was highly di&s;plea&s;ing to the king his ma&s;ter, he had it in charge not only to re&s;cue an injured monarch from confinement, but to rein&s;tate him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ancient power and independence. Animated with this pro&s;|pect of being &s;et free from &s;ubjection to &s;trangers, the Mexicans in &s;everal provinces began openly to revolt from Cortes, and to regard Narvaez as a deliverer no le&s;s able than willing to &s;ave them. Montezuma him&s;elf kept up a &s;ecret intercou&s;e with the new commander, and &s;eemed to court him as a per&s;on &s;uperior in power and dignity to tho&s;e Spaniards whom he had hitherto revered as the fir&s;t of men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His delibe|rations con|cerning his own con|duct.</NOTE>SUCH were the various a&s;pects of danger and difficulty which pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the view of Cortes. No &s;ituation can be conceived more trying to the capacity and firmne&s;s of a general, or where the choice of the plan which ought to be adopted was more difficult. If he &s;hould wait the approach of Narvaez in Mexico, de&s;truction &s;eemed to be unavoidable; for while the Spaniards pre&s;&s;ed him from without, the inhabitants, who&s;e turbulent &s;pirit he could hardly re&s;train with all his authority and attention would eagerly lay hold on &s;uch a favourable opportunity of avenging all their wrongs. If he &s;hould abandon the capital, &s;et the captive monarch at liberty, and march out to meet the enemy; he mu&s;t at once forego the fruits of all his toils and victories, and relinqui&s;h advan|tages which could not be recovered without ex|traordinary efforts, and infinite danger. If, in|&s;tead
<PB N="79" REF="034476_0587_0FFDDA24A3B87478">
of employing force, he &s;hould have recour&s;e to conciliating mea&s;ures, and attempt an accom|modation with Narvaez; the natural haughtine&s;s of that officer, augmented by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his pre&s;ent &s;uperiority, forbad him to cheri&s;h any &s;an|guine hope of &s;ucce&s;s. After revolving every &s;cheme with deep attention, Cortes fixed upon that which in execution was mo&s;t hazardous, but if &s;ucce&s;sful, would prove mo&s;t beneficial to him|&s;elf and his country; and with the deci&s;ive in|trepidity &s;uited to de&s;perate &s;ituations, determined to make one bold effort for victory under every di&s;advantage, rather than &s;acrifice his own con|que&s;ts and the Spani&s;h intere&s;t in Mexico.</P>
<P>BUT though he fore&s;aw that the conte&s;t mu&s;t be terminated finally by arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His negoci|ations with the follow|ers of Nar|vaez.</NOTE> it would have been not only indecent, but criminal, to have marched again&s;t his countrymen, without attempting to ad|ju&s;t matters by an amicable negociation. In this &s;ervice he employed Olmedo, his chaplain, to who&s;e character the function was well &s;uited, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, be&s;ides, &s;uch prudence and addre&s;s as qualified him to carry on the &s;ecret intrigues in which Cortes placed his chief confidence. Narvaez rejected, with &s;corn, every &s;cheme of accommo|dation that Olmedo propo&s;ed, and was with diffi|culty re&s;trained from laying violent hands on him and his attendants. He met, however, with a more favorable reception among the followers of Narvaez, to many of whom he delivered letters, either from Cortes or his officers, their ancient friends and companions. Cortes artfully accom|panied the&s;e with pre&s;ents of rings, chains of gold, and other trinkets of value, which in&s;pired tho&s;e needy adventurers with high ideas of the wealth that he had acquired, and with envy of their good fortune who were engaged in his &s;ervice. Some, from hopes of becoming &s;harers in tho&s;e rich &s;poils,

declared for an immediate accommodation with Cortes. Others, from public &s;pirit, laboured to prevent a civil war, which, whatever party &s;hould prevail, mu&s;t &s;hake, and perhaps &s;ubvert the Spa|ni&s;h power, in a country where it was &s;o imper|fectly e&s;tabli&s;hed. Narvaez di&s;regarded both, and by a public proclamation denounced Cortes and his adherents rebels and enemies to their country. Cortes, it is probable, was not much &s;urpri&s;ed at the untractable arrogance of Narvaez; and, after having given &s;uch a proof of his own pacific di&s;|po&s;ition as might ju&s;tify his recour&s;e to other means, he determined to advance towards an enemy whom he had laboured in vain to appea&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches again&s;t him.

His utmo&s;t art was em|ployed in concealing from Montezuma the real cau&s;e of his march. He laboured to per&s;uade him, that the &s;trangers who had lately arrived were his friends and fellow-&s;ubjects; and that, after a &s;hort interview with them, they would depart together, and return to their own country. The captive prince, unable to comprehend the de&s;igns of the Spaniards, or to reconcile what he now heard with the declarations of Narvaez, and afraid to di&s;cover any &s;ymptom of &s;u&s;picion or di&s;tru&s;t of Cortes, promi&s;ed to remain quietly in the Spani&s;h quarters, and to cultivate the &s;ame friend&s;hip with Alvarado which he had uniformly maintained with him.

Having ob&s;erved that the Indians in the province of Chinantla u&s;ed &s;pears of extraordinary length and force, he arm|ed his &s;oldiers with the&s;e, and accu&s;tomed them to that deep and compact arrangement which the u&s;e of this formidable weapon, the be&s;t perhaps that ever was invented for defence, enabled them to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>WITH this &s;mall but firm battalion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Continues to negociate as he ad|vanced.</NOTE> Cortes ad|vanced towards Zempoalla, of which Narvaez had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

The intercour&s;e, however, which this occa&s;ioned between the two parties, proved of no &s;mall advantage to Cortes, as it afforded him an opportunity of gaining &s;ome of Narvaez's officers by liberal pre&s;ents, of &s;often|ing others by a &s;emblance of moderation, and of dazzling all by the appearance of wealth among his

troops, mo&s;t of his &s;oldiers having converted their &s;hare of the Mexican gold into chains, bracelets, and other ornaments, which they di&s;played with military o&s;tentation. Narvaez and a little junto of his creatures excepted, all the army leaned towards an accommodation with their countrymen. This di&s;covery of their inclination irritated his violent temper almo&s;t to madne&s;s. In a tran&s;port of rage, he &s;et a price on the head of Cortes, and of his principal officers; and having learned that he was now advanced within a league of Zempoalla with his &s;mall body of men, he con&s;idered this as an in&s;ult which merited immediate cha&s;ti&s;ement, and marched out with all his troops to offer him battle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attacks Narvaez in the night.</NOTE>BUT Cortes was a leader of greater abilities and experience than, on equal ground, to fight an enemy &s;o far &s;uperior in number, and &s;o much better appointed.

The very circum&s;tance which induced them to quit the field, encouraged Cortes to form a &s;cheme, by which he hoped at once to terminate the war. He ob&s;erved, that his hardy veterans, though &s;tanding under the torrents which conti|nued

to fall, without a &s;ingle tent or any &s;helter what&s;oever to cover them, were &s;o far from re|pining at hard&s;hips which were become familiar to them, that they were &s;till fre&s;h and alert for &s;er|vice. He fore&s;aw that the enemy would naturally give them&s;elves up to repo&s;e after their fatigue, and that, judging of the conduct of others by their own effeminacy, they would deem them&s;elves per|fectly &s;ecure at a &s;ea&s;on &s;o unfit for action. He re&s;olved, therefore, to fall upon them in the dead of night, when the &s;urpri&s;e and terror of this un|expected attack might more than compen&s;ate the inferiority of his numbers. His &s;oldiers, &s;en&s;ible that no re&s;ource remained but in &s;ome de&s;perate ef|fort of courage, approved of the mea&s;ure with &s;uch warmth, that Cortes, in a military oration which he addre&s;&s;ed to them before they began their march, was more &s;olicitous to temper than to in|flame their ardour. He divided them into three parties. At the head of the fir&s;t he placed Sando|val; entru&s;ting this gallant officer with the mo&s;t dangerous and important &s;ervice, that of &s;eizing the enemy's artillery, which was planted before the principal tower of the temple, where Narvaez had fixed his head-quarters. Chri&s;toval de Olid commanded the &s;econd, with orders to a&s;&s;ault the tower, and lay hold on the general. Cortes him|&s;elf conducted the third and &s;malle&s;t divi&s;ion, which was to act as a body of re&s;erve, and to &s;up|port the other two as there &s;hould be occa&s;ion. Having pa&s;&s;ed the river de Canoas, which was much &s;welled with the rains, not without difficulty, the water reaching almo&s;t to their chins, they ad|vanced in profound &s;ilence, without beat of drum, or &s;ound of any warlike in&s;trument; each man armed with his &s;word, his dagger, and his Chinant|lan &s;pear. Narvaez, remi&s;s in proportion to his &s;e|curity, had po&s;ted only two centinels to watch the
<PB N="84" REF="034476_0592_0FFDDA34126C7228">
motions of an enemy whom he had &s;uch good cau&s;e to dread. One of the&s;e was &s;eized by the advanced guard of Cortes's troops, the other made his e&s;cape, and hurrying to the town with all the precipitation of fear and zeal, gave &s;uch timely notice of the enemy's approach, that there was full lei&s;ure to have prepared for their reception. But, through the arrogance and infatuation of Narvaez, this important interval was lo&s;t. He imputed this alarm to the cowardice of the centinel, and treated with deri&s;ion the idea of being attacked by forces &s;o unequal to his own. The &s;houts of Cortes's &s;oldiers, ru&s;hing on to the a&s;&s;ault, convinced him at la&s;t, that the danger which he de&s;pi&s;ed was real. The rapidity with which they advanced was &s;uch, that only one cannon could be fired, before Sando|val's party clo&s;ed with the enemy, drove them from their guns, and began to force their way up the &s;teps of the tower. Narvaez, no le&s;s brave in action than pre&s;umptuous in conduct, armed him|&s;elf in ha&s;te, and by his voice and example ani|mated his men to the combat. Olid advanced to &s;u&s;tain his companions; and Cortes him&s;elf, ru&s;hing to the front, conducted and added new vigour to the attack. The compact order in which this &s;mall body pre&s;&s;ed on, and the impenetrable front which they pre&s;ented with their long &s;pears, bore down all oppo&s;ition before it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and over|comes him.</NOTE> They had now reached the gate, and were &s;truggling to bur&s;t it open, when a &s;oldier having &s;et fire to the reeds with which the tower was covered, compelled Nar|vaez to &s;ally out.

The cry of victory re&s;ound|ed among the troops of Cortes. Tho&s;e who had &s;allied out with their leader now maintained the conflict feebly, and began to &s;urrender. Among

the remainder of his &s;oldiers, &s;tationed in two &s;maller towers of the temple, terror and confu&s;ion prevailed. The darkne&s;s was &s;o great, that they could not di&s;tingui&s;h between their friends and foes. Their own artillery was pointed again&s;t them. Wherever they turned their eyes, they beheld lights gleaming through the ob&s;curity of night, which, though proceeding only from a variety of &s;hining in&s;ects, that abound in moi&s;t and &s;ultry climates, their affrighted imaginations repre&s;ented as nume|rous bands of mu&s;keteers advancing with kindled matches to the attack. After a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance, the &s;oldiers compelled their officers to capitulate, and before morning all laid down their arms, and &s;ubmitted quietly to their conquerors.</P>
<P>THIS complete victory proved more acceptable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The effects of this victory.</NOTE> as it was gained almo&s;t without blood&s;hed, only two &s;oldiers being killed on the &s;ide of Cortes, and two officers, with fifteen private men, of the ad|ver&s;e faction. Cortes treated the vanqui&s;hed not like enemies, but as countrymen and friends, and offered either to &s;end them back directly to Cuba, or to take them into his &s;ervice, as partners in his fortune, on equal terms with his own &s;oldiers. This latter propo&s;ition, &s;econded by a &s;ea&s;onable di&s;tribution of &s;ome pre&s;ents from Cortes, and li|beral promi&s;es of more, opened pro&s;pects &s;o agree|able to the romantic expectations which had invited them to engage in this &s;ervice, that all, a few par|tizans of Narvaez excepted, clo&s;ed with it, and vied with each other in profe&s;&s;ions of fidelity and attachment to a general, who&s;e recent &s;ucce&s;s had given them &s;uch a &s;triking proof of his abilities for command. Thus by a &s;eries of events no le&s;s fortunate than uncommon, Cortes not only e&s;caped from perdition which &s;eemed inevitable, but, when he had lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect it, was placed at the head of a thou&s;and Spaniards, ready to follow

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mexi|cans take arms again&s;t the Spa|niards.</NOTE>BUT, in one point, the prudent conduct and good fortune of Cortes were equally con&s;picuous. If, by the rapidity of his operations after he began his march, he had not brought matters to &s;uch a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue, even this deci&s;ive victory would have come too late to have &s;aved his companions whom he left in Mexico. A few days after the di&s;comfi|ture of Narvaez, a courier arrived with an account that the Mexicans had taken arms, and having &s;eized and de&s;troyed the two brigantines, which Cortes had built in order to &s;ecure the command of the lake, and attacked the Spaniards in their quar|ters, had killed &s;everal of them, and wounded more, had reduced to a&s;hes their magazine of pro|vi&s;ions, and carried on ho&s;tilities with &s;uch fury, that, though Alvarado and his men defended them&s;elves with undaunted re&s;olution, they mu&s;t either be &s;oon cut off by famine, or &s;ink under the multitude of their enemies. This revolt was excited by motives which rendered it &s;till more alarming. On the departure of Cortes for Zempoalla, the Mexicans flattered them&s;elves, that the long-expected oppor|tunity of re&s;toring their &s;overeign to liberty, and of vindicating their country from the odious domi|nion of &s;trangers, was at length arrived; that while
<PB N="87" REF="034476_0595_0FFDDA3B4ED7D1E8">
the forces of their oppre&s;&s;ors were divided, and the arms of one party turned again&s;t the other, they might triumph with greater facility over both. Con&s;ultations were held, and &s;chemes formed with this intention. The Spaniards in Mexico, con&s;cious of their own feeblene&s;s, &s;u&s;pected and dreaded tho&s;e machinations. Alvarado, though a gallant officer, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither that extent of capacity, nor dignity of manners, by which Cortes had ac|quired &s;uch an a&s;cendant over the minds of the Mexicans, as never allowed them to form a ju&s;t e&s;timate of his weakne&s;s or of their own &s;trength. Alvarado knew no mode of &s;upporting his au|thority but force. In&s;tead of employing addre&s;s to di&s;concert the plans or to &s;ooth the &s;pirits of the Mexicans, he waited the return of one of their &s;olemn fe&s;tivals, when the principal per&s;ons in the empire were dancing, according to cu&s;tom, in the court of the great temple; he &s;eized all the avenues which led to it, and, allured partly by the rich or|naments which they wore in honour of their gods, and partly by the facility of cutting off at once the authors of that con&s;piracy which he dreaded, he fell upon them, unarmed and un&s;u&s;picious of any danger, and ma&s;&s;acred a great number, none e&s;cap|ing but &s;uch as made their way over the battlements of the temple. An action &s;o cruel and treacherous filled not only the city, but the whole empire, with indignation and rage.

But a &s;udden motion of the Mexicans engaged him in new conflicts.

From this po&s;t it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;lodge them at any ri&s;k; and Juan de E&s;cobar, with a nume|rous detachment of cho&s;en &s;oldiers, was ordered to make the attack. But E&s;cobar, though a gallant officer, and at the head of troops accu&s;tomed to conquer, and who now fought under the eyes of their countrymen, was thrice repul&s;ed. Cortes, &s;en&s;ible that not only the reputation, but the &s;afety of his army depended on the &s;ucce&s;s of this a&s;&s;ault, ordered a buckler to be tied to his arm, as he could not manage it with his wounded hand, and ru&s;hed with his drawn &s;word into the thicke&s;t of the combatants. Encouraged by the pre&s;ence of their general, the Spaniards returned to the charge with &s;uch vigour, that they gradually forced their way up the &s;teps, and drove the Mexicans to the platform at the top of the tower. There a dread|ful carnage began, when two young Mexicans of high rank, ob&s;erving Cortes as he animated his &s;oldiers by his voice and example, re&s;olved to &s;a|crifice their own lives in order to cut off the author of all the calamities which de&s;olated their country.

they made their retreat in this manner. They be|gan to move, towards midnight, in three divi&s;ions.

Such, how|ever, was the &s;uperiority of the Spani&s;h di&s;cipline and arms, that the impre&s;&s;ion of this &s;mall body was irre&s;i&s;tible; and whichever way its force was directed, it penetrated and di&s;per&s;ed the mo&s;t nu|merous battalions. But while the&s;e gave way in one quarter, new combatants advanced from an|other, and the Spaniards, though &s;ucce&s;sful in every attack, were ready to &s;ink under tho&s;e re|peated efforts, without &s;eeing any end of their toil, or any hope of victory. At that time Cortes ob|&s;erved the great &s;tandard of the empire, which was carried before the Mexican general, advancing; and fortunately recollecting to have heard, that on the fate of it depended the event of every battle, he a&s;&s;embled a few of his brave&s;t officers, who&s;e hor&s;es were &s;till capable of &s;ervice, and placing him&s;elf at their head, pu&s;hed forward towards the &s;tandard with an impetuo&s;ity which bore down every thing before it. A cho&s;en body of nobles, who guarded the &s;tandard, made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, but were &s;oon broken. Cortes, with a &s;troke of his lance, wounded the Mexican general, and threw him to the ground. One of the Spani&s;h officers alighting, put an end to his life, and laid hold of the Imperial &s;tandard. The moment that their leader fell, and the &s;tandard, towards which all directed their eyes, di&s;appeared, an univer&s;al panic &s;truck the Mexicans, and, as if the bond which held them together had been di&s;&s;olved, every en&s;ign was lowered, each &s;oldier threw away

The Spaniards, unable to pur&s;ue them far, returned to collect the &s;poils of the field, which were &s;o valuable, as to be &s;ome compen&s;ation for the wealth which they had lo&s;t in Mexico; for in the enemy's army were mo&s;t of their principal warriors, dre&s;&s;ed out in their riche&s;t ornaments, as if they had been marching to a&s;&s;ured victory.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 8.</NOTE> Next day, to their great joy, they entered the Tla&s;calan territories.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. p. 219.

Happily for them, the enmity of the Tla&s;calans to the Mexi|can name was &s;o inveterate, their de&s;ire to avenge the death of their countrymen &s;o vehement, and the a&s;cendant which Cortes had acquired over the chiefs of the republic &s;o complete, that, far from entertaining a thought of taking any advantage of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation in which they beheld the Spaniards, they received them with a tenderne&s;s and cordiality, which quickly di&s;&s;ipated all their &s;u&s;picions.</P>

<PB N="102" REF="034476_0610_0FFDDA5D1FF2B600">
the effects of the Mexican enmity. A con&s;ider|able detachment, which was marching from Zem|poalla towards the capital, had been cut off by the people of Tepeaca. A &s;maller party, returning from Tla&s;cala to Vera Cruz, with the &s;hare of the Mexican gold allotted to the garri&s;on, had been &s;urpri&s;ed and de&s;troyed in the mountains. At a juncture when the life of every Spaniard was of importance, &s;uch lo&s;&s;es were deeply felt. The &s;chemes which Cortes was meditating rendered them peculiarly afflictive to him. While his ene|mies, and even many of his own followers, con&s;i|dered the di&s;a&s;ters which had befallen him as fatal to the progre&s;s of his arms, and imagined that nothing now remained but &s;peedily to abandon a country which he had invaded with unequal force, his mind, as eminent for per&s;everance as for enter|pri&s;e, was &s;till bent on accompli&s;hing his original purpo&s;e, of &s;ubjecting the Mexican empire to the crown of Ca&s;tile. Severe and unexpected as the check was which he had received, it did not ap|pear to him a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for relinqui&s;hing the conque&s;ts which he had already made, or again&s;t re&s;uming his operations with better hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. The colony at Vera Cruz was not only &s;afe, but had remained unmole&s;ted. The people of Zempoalla and the adjacent di&s;tricts had di&s;covered no &s;ymptoms of defection. The Tla&s;|calans continued firm to their alliance. On their martial &s;pirit, ea&s;ily rou&s;ed to arms, and inflamed with implacable hatred of the Mexicans, Cortes depended for powerful aid. He had &s;till the com|mand of a body of Spaniards, equal in number to that with which he had opened his way into the centre of the empire, and had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the capital; &s;o that with the benefit of greater experience, as well as more perfect knowledge of the country, he did not de&s;pair of quickly reco|vering

The inhabitants of other towns he en|deavoured to conciliate by more gentle means, and though he could not hold any intercour&s;e with them but by the intervention of interpreters, yet, under all the di&s;advantage of that tedious and imperfect mode of communication, he had acquired &s;uch thorough knowledge of the &s;tate of the country, as well as of the di&s;po&s;itions of the people, that he conducted his negociations and intrigues with a&s;to|ni&s;hing dexterity and &s;ucce&s;s.

Cortes having early ob&s;erved &s;ymptoms of their di&s;affection, availed him&s;elf of this knowledge to gain their confidence and friend|&s;hip. By offering, with confidence, to deliver them from the odious dominion of the Mexicans, and by liberal promi&s;es of more indulgent treat|ment, if they would unite with him again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors, he prevailed on the people of &s;everal con&s;iderable di&s;tricts, not only to acknowledge the

<P>WHILE, by tho&s;e various methods, Cortes was gradually circum&s;cribing the Mexican power in &s;uch a manner that his pro&s;pect of overturning it &s;eemed neither to be uncertain nor remote, all his &s;chemes were well nigh defeated, by a con&s;pi|racy no le&s;s unexpected than dangerous. The &s;oldiers of Narvaez had never united perfectly with the original companions of Cortes; nor did they enter into his mea&s;ures with the &s;ame cordial zeal. Upon every occa&s;ion that required any extraordi|nary effort of courage or of patience, their &s;pirits were apt to &s;ink; and now, on a near view of what they had to encounter, in attempting to reduce a city &s;o inacce&s;&s;ible as Mexico, and defended by a numerous army, the re&s;olution even of tho&s;e among them who had adhered to Cortes when he was de|&s;erted by their a&s;&s;ociates, began to fail. Their fears led them to pre&s;umptuous and un&s;oldier-like di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions concerning the propriety of their general's mea&s;ures, and the improbability of their &s;ucce&s;s.

Antonio Villefagna, a private &s;oldier, but bold, intriguing, and &s;trongly attached to Vela&s;quez, art|fully fomented this growing &s;pirit of di&s;affection. His quarters became the rendezvous of the mal|contents, where, after many con&s;ultations, they could di&s;cover no method of checking Cortes in his career, but by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating him and his mo&s;t con&s;iderable officers, and conferring the command upon &s;ome per&s;on who would relinqui&s;h his wild plans, and adopt mea&s;ures more con&s;i&s;tent with the general &s;ecurity. De&s;pair in&s;pired them with cou|rage. The hour for perpetrating the crime, the per&s;ons whom they de&s;tined as victims, the officers to &s;ucceed them in command, were all named; and the con&s;pirators &s;igned an a&s;&s;ociation, by which they bound them&s;elves with mo&s;t &s;olemn oaths to mutual fidelity. But on the evening before the appointed day, one of Cortes's ancient followers, who had been &s;educed into the con&s;piracy, touched with compunction at the imminent danger of a man whom he had long been accu&s;tomed to revere, or &s;truck with horror at his own treachery, went pri|vately to his general, and revealed to him all that he knew. Cortes, though deeply alarmed, di&s;|cerned at once what conduct was proper in a &s;itua|tion &s;o critical. He repaired in&s;tantly to Ville|fagna's quarters, accompanied by &s;ome of his mo&s;t tru&s;ty officers. The a&s;toni&s;hment and confu&s;ion of the man at this unexpected vi&s;it anticipated the confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt. Cortes, while his attendants &s;eized the traitor, &s;natched from his bo&s;om a paper containing the a&s;&s;ociation, &s;igned by the con&s;pira|tors. Impatient to know how far the defection extended, he retired to read it, and found there names which filled him with &s;urpri&s;e and &s;orrow. But, aware how dangerous a &s;trict &s;crutiny might

prove at &s;uch a juncture, he confined his judicial in|quiries to Villefagna alone. As the proofs of his guilt were manife&s;t, he was condemned after a &s;hort trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1521.</NOTE> and next morning he was &s;een hanging before the door of the hou&s;e in which he had lodged. Cortes called his troops together, and having explained to them the atrocious purpo&s;e of the con&s;pirators, as well as the ju&s;tice of the puni&s;hment inflicted on Villefagna, he added, with an appearance of &s;ati&s;|faction, that he was entirely ignorant with re&s;pect to all the circum&s;tances of this dark tran&s;action, as the traitor, when arre&s;ted, had &s;uddenly torn and &s;wallowed a paper which probably contained an account of it, and under the &s;evere&s;t tortures po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch con&s;tancy as to conceal the names of his accomplices. This artful declaration re&s;tored tranquillity to many a brea&s;t that was throbbing, while he &s;poke, with con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt and dread of detection; and by this prudent modera|tion, Cortes had the advantage of having di&s;co|vered, and of being able to ob&s;erve &s;uch of his followers as were di&s;affected; while they, flatter|ing them&s;elves that their pa&s;t crime was unknown, endeavoured to avert any &s;u&s;picion of it, by re|doubling their activity and zeal in his &s;ervice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 283.

The Mexican nobles, &s;oli|citous to &s;ave the life of a monarch whom they revered, prevailed on Guatimozin to retire from a place where re&s;i&s;tance was now vain, that he might rou&s;e the more di&s;tant provinces of the empire to arms, and maintain there a more &s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggle with the public enemy.

Under the &s;anction of tho&s;e ill-founded maxims, they violated every right that &s;hould be held &s;acred between ho&s;tile nations.

<P>AS Pizarro continued to advance towards the center of the Peruvian empire, he gradually re|ceived more full information concerning its extent and policy, as well as the &s;ituation of its affairs at that juncture.

<P>AT the time when the Spaniards invaded Peru,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the Peruvian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> the dominions of its &s;overeigns extended in length, from north to &s;outh above fifteen hundred mile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> along the Pacific Ocean.

Peru, like the re&s;t of the New World, was origi|nally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;mall independent tribes, differ|ing from each other in manners, and in their forms of rude policy. All, however, were &s;o little civi|lized, that, if the traditions concerning their mode of life, pre&s;erved among their de&s;cendants, de|&s;erve credit, they mu&s;t be cla&s;&s;ed among the mo&s;t unimproved &s;avages of America. Strangers to every &s;pecies of cultivation or regular indu&s;try, without any fixed re&s;idence, and unacquainted with tho&s;e &s;entiments and obligations which form the fir&s;t bonds of &s;ocial union, they are &s;aid to have roamed about naked in the fore&s;ts, with which the country was then covered, more like wild bea&s;ts than like men. After they had &s;truggled for &s;e|veral ages with the hard&s;hips and calamities which are inevitable in &s;uch a &s;tate, and when no circum|&s;tance &s;eemed to indicate the approach of any un|common effort towards improvement, we are told
<PB N="166" REF="034476_0673_0FFDDB06A55F9C98">
that there appeared on the banks of the lake Ti|tiaca, a man and woman of maje&s;tic form, and clothed in decent garments. They declared them|&s;elves to be children of the Sun, &s;ent by their be|neficent parent, who beheld with pity the mi&s;eries of the human race, to in&s;truct and to reclaim them. At their per&s;ua&s;ion, enforced by reverence for the divinity in who&s;e name they were &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak, &s;everal of the di&s;per&s;ed &s;avages united together, and receiving their commands as hea|venly injunctions, followed them to Cuzco, where they &s;ettled, and began to lay the foundations of a city.</P>
<P>MANCO CAPAC and Mama Ocollo, for &s;uch were the names of tho&s;e extraordinary per&s;onages, having thus collected &s;ome wandering tribes, formed that &s;ocial union, which, by multiplying the de&s;ires, and uniting the efforts of the human &s;pecies, excites indu&s;try, and leads to improve|ment. Manco Capac in&s;tructed the men in agri|culture, and other u&s;eful arts. Mama Ocollo taught the women to &s;pin and to weave. By the labour of the one &s;ex, &s;ub&s;i&s;tence became le&s;s pre|carious; by that of the other, life was rendered more comfortable. After &s;ecuring the objects of fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity in an infant &s;tate, by providing food, raiment, and habitations, for the rude people of whom he took charge, Manco Capac turned his attention towards introducing &s;uch laws and policy as might perpetuate their happine&s;s. By his in&s;ti|tutions, which &s;hall be more particularly explained hereafter, the various relations in private life were e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the duties re&s;ulting from them pre&s;cribed with &s;uch propriety, as gradually formed a barbarous people to decency of manners. In public admini&s;tration, the functions of per&s;ons in authority were &s;o preci&s;ely defined, and the &s;ubordi|nation of tho&s;e under their juri&s;diction maintained

with &s;uch a &s;teady hand, that the &s;ociety in which he pre&s;ided, &s;oon a&s;&s;umed the a&s;pect of a regular and well-governed &s;tate.</P>
<P>THUS, according to the Indian tradition, was founded the empire of the <HI>Incas</HI> or <HI>Lords</HI> of Peru. At fir&s;t its extent was &s;mall. The territory of Manco Capac did not reach above eight leagues from Cuzco. But within its narrow precincts he exerci&s;ed ab&s;olute and uncontrouled authority. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, as their dominions extended, arrogated a &s;imilar juri&s;diction over the new &s;ubjects which they acquired: the de&s;poti&s;m of A&s;ia was not more complete. The Incas were not only obeyed as monarchs, but revered as divinities. Their blood was held to be &s;acred, and, by prohibiting inter|marriages with the people, was never contaminated by mixing with that of any other race. The family, thus &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the nation, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by peculiarities in dre&s;s and ornaments, which it was unlawful for others to a&s;&s;ume. The monarch him&s;elf appeared with en&s;igns of royalty re&s;erved for him alone; and received from his &s;ub|jects marks of ob&s;equious homage and re&s;pect, which approached almo&s;t to adoration.</P>
<P>BUT, among the Peruvians, this unbounded power of their monarchs &s;eems to have been uni|formly accompanied with attention to the good of their &s;ubjects. It was not the rage of conque&s;t, if we may believe the accounts of their countrymen, that prompted the Incas to extend their dominions, but the de&s;ire of diffu&s;ing the ble&s;&s;ings of civiliza|tion, and the knowledge of the arts which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, among the barbarous people whom they reduced. During a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of twelve monarchs, it is &s;aid that not one deviated from this beneficent character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cieca de Leon, Chron, c. 44.

He is repre&s;ented as a prince di&s;tingui&s;hed not only for the pacific virtues peculiar to the race, but eminent for his martial talents. By his victo|rious arms the kingdom of Quito was &s;ubjected, a conque&s;t of &s;uch extent and importance as almo&s;t doubled the power of the Peruvian empire. He was fond of re&s;iding in the capital of that valuable province, which he had added to his dominions; and notwith&s;tanding the ancient and fundamental law of the monarchy again&s;t polluting the royal blood by any foreign alliance, he married the daughter of the vanqui&s;hed monarch of Quito.&mdash; She bore him a &s;on named Atahualpa, whom, on his death at Quito, which &s;eems to have happened about the year one thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-nine, he appointed his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in that kingdom, leaving the re&s;t of his dominions to Hu|a&s;car, his elde&s;t &s;on, by a mother of the royal race. Greatly as the Peruvians revered the memory of a monarch who had reigned with greater reputation and &s;plendour than any of his predece&s;&s;ors, the de|&s;tination of Huana Capac concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, appeared &s;o repugnant to a maxim coeval with the empire, and founded on authority deemed &s;a|cred, that it was no &s;ooner known at Cuzco than it excited general di&s;gu&s;t. Encouraged by tho&s;e &s;en|timents of his &s;ubject, Hua&s;car required his brother to renounce the government of Quito, and to ac|knowledge him as his lawful &s;uperior. But it had been the fir&s;t care of Atahualpa to gain a large body of troops which had accompanied his father to Quito. The&s;e were the flower of the Peruvian warriors, to who&s;e valour Huana Capac had been indebted for all his victories. Relying on their

<P>THUS the ambition of two young men, the title of the one founded on ancient u&s;age, and that of the other a&s;&s;erted by the veteran troops, involved Peru in civil war, a calamity to which, under a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of virtuous princes, it had hitherto been a &s;tranger. In &s;uch a conte&s;t the i&s;&s;ue was obvious. The force of arms triumphed over the authority of laws. Atahualpa remained victorious, and made a cruel u&s;e of his victory. Con&s;cious of the defect in his own title to the crown, he attempted to ex|terminate the royal race, by putting to death all the children of the Sun de&s;cended from Manco Ca|pac, whom he could &s;eize either by force or &s;trata|gem. From a political motive, the life of his un|fortunate rival Hua&s;car, who had been taken pri|&s;oner in a battle which decided the fate of the em|pire, was prolonged for &s;ome time, that, by i&s;&s;uing orders in his name, the u&s;urper might more ea&s;ily e&s;tabli&s;h his own authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. i. c. 15.

to ruin him by private machinations, that unhappy prince inadvertently contributed to ha&s;ten his own fate. During his confinement he had at|tached him&s;elf with peculiar affection to Ferdinand Pizarro and Hernando Soto; who, as they were per&s;ons of birth and education &s;uperior to the rough adventurers with whom they &s;erved, were accu&s;|tomed to behave with more decency and attention to the captive monarch. Soothed with this re&s;pect from per&s;ons of &s;uch high rank, he delighted in their &s;ociety. But in the pre&s;ence of the governor he was always unea&s;y and overawed. This dread &s;oon came to be mingled with contempt. Among all the European arts, what he admired mo&s;t was that of reading and writing; and he long delibera|ted with him&s;elf, whether he &s;hould regard it as a natural or acquired talent. In order to determine this, he de&s;ired one of the &s;oldiers, who guarded him, to write the name of God on the nail of his thumb.

At length Pizarro entered; and on pre&s;enting it to him, he blu&s;hed, and with &s;ome confu&s;ion was obliged to acknowledge his igno|rance. From that moment, Atahualpa con&s;idered him as a mean per&s;on, le&s;s in&s;tructed than his own &s;oldiers; and he had not addre&s;s enough to conceal the &s;entiments with which this di&s;covery in&s;pired him. To be the object of a barbarian's &s;corn, not only mortified the pride of Pizarro, but excited &s;uch re&s;entment in his brea&s;t, as added force to all the other con&s;iderations which promped him to put the Inca to death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. iii. c. 4.

exempted from &s;tanding &s;ingly re&s;pon&s;ible for the commi&s;&s;ion of it, Pizarro, re&s;olved to try the Inca with all the formalities ob&s;erved in the criminal courts of Spain.

Before this &s;trange tribunal, a charge was exhibited &s;till more amazing. It con&s;i&s;ted of various articles; that Atahualpa, though a ba&s;tard, had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the rightful owner of the throne, and u&s;urped the regal power; that he had put his brother and law|ful &s;overeign to death; that he was an idolater, and had not only permitted, but commanded the offer|ing of human &s;acrifices; that he had a great num|ber of concubines; that &s;ince his impri&s;onment he had wa&s;ted and embezzled the royal trea&s;ures, which now belonged of right to the conquerors; that he had incited his &s;ubjects to take arms again&s;t the Spaniards. On the&s;e heads of accu&s;ation, &s;ome of which are &s;o ludicrous, others &s;o ab&s;urd, that the effrontery of Pizarro, in making them the foun|dation of a &s;erious procedure, is not le&s;s &s;urpri|&s;ing than his inju&s;tice, did this &s;trange court go on to try the &s;overeign of a great empire, over whom it had no juri&s;diction.

Many of them peri&s;hed; and the &s;urvivors, when they de&s;cended into the fertile plains of Chili, had new difficulties to encounter. They found there a race of men very different from the people of Peru, intrepid, hardy, independent, and in their bodily con&s;titution, as well as vigour of &s;pirit, nearly re&s;embling the warlike tribes in North America.

The Spaniards, however, continued to penetrate into the country, and collected &s;ome con&s;iderable quantities of gold; but were &s;o far from thinking of making any &s;ettlement amid&s;t &s;uch formidable neighbours, that, in &s;pite of all the experience and valour of their leader, the final i&s;&s;ue of the expedition &s;till remained extremely dubious, when they were recalled from it by an unexpected revolution in Peru<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib iii. c. 1.

<P>ON Sunday, the twenty-&s;ixth of June, at mid|day, the &s;ea&s;on of tranquillity and repo&s;e in all &s;ultry climates, Herrada, at the head of eighteen of the mo&s;t determined con&s;pirators, &s;allied out of Almagro's hou&s;e in complete armour; and draw|ing their &s;words, as they advanced ha&s;tily towards the governor's palace, cried out, "Long live the king, but let the tyrant die!" Their a&s;&s;ociates, warned of their motions by a &s;ignal, were in arms at different &s;tations ready to &s;upport them. Though Pizarro was u&s;ually &s;urrounded by &s;uch a nume|rous train of attendants as &s;uited the magnificence of the mo&s;t opulent &s;ubject of the age in which he lived, yet as he was ju&s;t ri&s;en from table, and mo&s;t of his dome&s;tics had retired to their own apart|ments, the con&s;pirators pa&s;&s;ed through the two outer courts of the palace unob&s;erved. They were at the bottom of the &s;tairca&s;e, before a page in waiting could give the alarm to his ma&s;ter, who was conver&s;ing with a few friends in a large hall. The governor, who&s;e &s;teady mind no form of dan|ger could appal, &s;tarting up, called for arms, and commanded Franci&s;co de Chaves to make fa&s;t the door. But that officer, who did not retain &s;o much pre&s;ence of mind as to obey this prudent order, running to the top of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, wildly a&s;ked the con&s;pirators what they meant, and whither they were going?

him to the heart, and bur&s;t into the hall. Some of the per&s;ons who were there threw them|&s;elves from the windows; others attempted to fly; and a few drawing their &s;words, followed their leader into an inner apartment. The con&s;pirators, animated with having the object of their vengeance now in view, ru&s;hed forward after them. Pizarro, with no other arms than his &s;word and buckler, defended the entry, and &s;upported by his half-brother Alcantara, and his little knot of friends, he maintained the unequal conte&s;t with intrepidity worthy of his pa&s;t exploits, and with the vigour of a youthful combatant, "Courage," cried he, "companions, we are yet enow to make tho&s;e traitors repent of their audacity." But the armour of the con&s;pirators protected them, while every thru&s;t they made took effect. Alcantara fell dead at his brother's feet; his other defenders were mortally wounded. The governor, &s;o weary that he could hardly wield his &s;word, and no longer able to parry the many weapons furiou&s;ly aimed at him, received a deadly thri&s;t full in his throat, &s;unk to the ground, and expired.</P>

As his youth and inexperience di&s;qualified him from taking the command of them him&s;elf, he appointed Herrada to act as general. But though Almagro &s;peedily collected &s;uch a re&s;pectable force, the acquie&s;cence in his government was far from being general. Pizarro had left many friends to whom his memory was dear; the barbarous a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of a man to whom his country was &s;o highly indebted, filled every impartial per&s;on with horror. The ignomi|nious birth of Almagro, as well as the doubtful title on which he &s;ounded his preten&s;ions, led others to con&s;ider him as an u&s;urper. The officers who commanded in &s;ome provinces refu&s;ed to recognize his authority, until it was confirmed by the em|peror.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;ultati|tions of the emperor concerning his domini+ons in A|merica.</NOTE>DURING tho&s;e violent convul&s;ions in Peru, the emperor and his mini&s;ters were intently employed in preparing regulations, by which they hoped not only to re-e&s;tabli&s;h tranquillity there, but to intro|duce a more perfect &s;y&s;tem of internal policy into all their &s;ettlements in the New World. It is ma|nife&s;t from all the events recorded in the hi&s;tory of America, that rapid and exten&s;ive as the Spani&s;h conque&s;ts there had been, they were not carried on by any regular exertion of the national force, but by the occa&s;ional efforts of private adventurers. After fitting out a few of the fir&s;t armaments for di&s;covering new regions, the court of Spain, during the bu&s;y reigns of Ferdinand and of Charles V. the former the mo&s;t intriguing prince of the age, and the latter the mo&s;t ambitious, was encumbered with &s;uch a multiplicity of &s;chemes, and involved in war with &s;o many nations of Europe, that it had not lei&s;ure to attend to di&s;tant and le&s;s intere&s;ting objects. The care of pro&s;ecuting di&s;covery, or of attempting conque&s;t, was abandoned to individuals; and with &s;uch ardour did men pu&s;h forward in this new career, on which novelty, the &s;pirit of
<PB N="227" REF="034476_0734_0FFDDBA59E614C48">
adventure, avarice, ambition, and the hope of meriting heaven, prompted them with combined influence to enter, that in le&s;s than half a century almo&s;t the whole of that exten&s;ive empire which Spain now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the New World, was &s;ub|jected to its dominion. As the Spani&s;h court con|tributed nothing towards the various expeditions undertaken in America, it was not entitled to claim much from their &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;overeignty of the conquered provinces, with the fifth of the gold and &s;ilver, was re&s;erved for the crown; every thing el&s;e was &s;eized by the a&s;&s;ociates in each ex|pedition as their own right. The plunder of the countries which they invaded &s;erved to demnify them for what they had expended in equipping them&s;elves for the &s;ervice, and the conquered ter|ritory was divided among them, according to rules which cu&s;tom had introduced, as permanent e&s;ta|bli&s;hments which their &s;ucce&s;sful valour merited. In the infancy of tho&s;e &s;ettlements, when their ex|tent as well as their value were unknown, many irregularities e&s;caped ob&s;ervation, and it was found nece&s;&s;ary to connive at many exce&s;&s;es. The con|quered people were frequently pillaged with de&s;tructive rapacity, and their country parcelled out among its new ma&s;ters in exorbitant &s;hares, far exceeding the highe&s;t recompence due to their &s;er|vices. The rude conquerors of America, inca|pable of forming their e&s;tabli&s;hments upon any general or exten&s;ive plan of policy, attentive only to private intere&s;t, unwilling to forego pre&s;ent gain from the pro&s;pect of remote or public benefit, &s;eem to have had no object but to ama&s;s &s;udden wealth, without regarding what might be the con&s;equences of the means by which they acquired it. But when time at length di&s;covered to the Spani&s;h court the importance of its American po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of new-modelling their whole frame became
<PB N="228" REF="034476_0735_0FFDDBA7B13ADC08">
obvious, and in place of the maxims and practices, prevalent among military adventurers, it was found requi&s;ite to &s;ub&s;titute the in&s;titutions of regular government.</P>
<P>ONE evil in particular called for an immediate remedy. The conquerors of Mexico and Peru imitated the fatal example of their countrymen &s;ettled in the i&s;lands, and employed them&s;elves in &s;earching for gold and &s;ilver with the &s;ame incon|&s;iderate eagerne&s;s. Similar effects followed. The natives employed in this labour by ma&s;ters, who in impo&s;ing ta&s;ks had no regard either to what they felt or to what they were able to perform, pined away and peri&s;hed &s;o fa&s;t, that there was rea&s;on to apprehend that Spain, in&s;tead of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing coun|tries peopled to &s;uch a degree as to be &s;u&s;ceptible of progre&s;&s;ive improvement, would &s;oon remain proprietor only of a va&s;t uninhabited de&s;ert.</P>
<P>THE emperor and his mini&s;ters were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of this, and &s;o &s;olicitous to prevent the extinction of the Indian race, which threatened to render their acqui&s;itions of no value, that from time to time various laws, which I have mentioned, had been made for &s;ecuring to that unhappy people more gentle and equitable treatment. But the di&s;tance of America from the &s;eat of empire, the feeblene&s;s of government in the new colonies, the avarice and audacity of &s;oldiers unaccu&s;tomed to re&s;traint, pre|vented the&s;e &s;alutary regulations from operating with any con&s;iderable influence.

Though, &s;ince the mi&s;carriage of his former &s;chemes for the relief of the Indians, he had continued &s;hut up in his cloi&s;ter, or occupied in religious functions, his zeal in behalf of the former objects of his pity was &s;o far from abating, that, from an increa&s;ed knowledge of their &s;ufferings, its ardour had aug|mented.

With the deci&s;ive tone of one &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the truth of his own &s;y&s;tem, he imputed all this to a &s;ingle cau&s;e, to the exactions and cruelty of his countrymen, and contended that nothing could prevent the de|population of America, but the declaring of its natives to be freemen, and treating them as &s;ub|jects, not as &s;laves. Nor did he confide for the &s;ucce&s;s of this propo&s;al in the powers of his ora|tory alone. In order to enforce them, he com|po&s;ed his famous treati&s;e concerning the de|&s;truction of America<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Reme&s;. p. 192, 199.</NOTE>, in which he relates, with many horrid circum&s;tances, but with apparent marks of exaggerated de&s;cription, the deva&s;tation of every province which had been vi&s;ited by the Spaniards.</P>

But as no Spaniard can ea&s;ily &s;urmount that veneration for his &s;overeign which &s;eems to be interwoven in his frame, the idea of marching in arms again&s;t the royal &s;tandard filled him with horror.

which the malcontents had proceeded in that coun|try, the court had received an account of the in&s;ur|rection again&s;t the viceroy, of his impri&s;onment, and the u&s;urpation of the government by Pizarro. A revolution &s;o alarming called for an immediate in|terpo&s;ition of the emperor's abilities and authority. But as he was fully occupied at that time in Ger|many, in conducting the war again&s;t the famous league of Smalkalde, one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and arduous enterpri&s;es in his reign, the care of pro|viding a remedy for the di&s;orders in Peru devolved upon his &s;on Philip, and the coun&s;ellors whom Charles had appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the govern|ment of Spain during his ab&s;ence. At fir&s;t view, the actions of Pizarro and his adherents, appeared &s;o repugnant to the duty of &s;ubjects towards their &s;overeign, that the greater part of the mini&s;ters in|&s;i&s;ted on declaring them in&s;tantly to be guilty of rebellion, and on proceeding to puni&s;h them with exemplary rigour.

The veteran bands of infantry, the &s;trength and glory of the Spani&s;h armies, were then employed in Germany. Spain, exhau&s;ted of men and money by a long &s;eries of wars, in which &s;he had been involved by the re&s;tle&s;s ambition of two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive monarchs, could not ea&s;ily equip an armament of &s;ufficient force to reduce Pizarro.

Civil di&s;cord never raged with a more fell &s;pirit than among the Spaniards in Peru.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all Ga&s;ca's wi&s;e regulati|ons, the tranquillity of Peru was not of long con|tinuance. In a country, where the authority of government had been almo&s;t forgotten during the long prevalence of anarchy and mi&s;rule, where there were di&s;appointed leaders ripe for revolt, and &s;e|ditious &s;oldiers ready to follow them, it was not difficult to rai&s;e combu&s;tion.

The people of both the great empires in America, like the rude tribes around them, were totally unacquainted with the u&s;eful metals, and the progre&s;s which they had made in extending their dominion over the animal creation was in|con&s;iderable. The Mexicans had gone no farther than to tame and rear turkeys, ducks, a &s;pecies of &s;mall dogs, and rabbits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 11. lib. vii. c. 12.</NOTE>. By this feeble e&s;&s;ay of ingenuity, the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence were rendered &s;omewhat more plentiful and &s;ecure, than when men depend &s;olely on hunting; but they had no idea of attempting to &s;ubdue the more robu&s;t ani|mals, or of deriving any aid from their mini&s;try in carrying on works of labour.

<P>IN tracing the line by which nations proceed towards civilization, the di&s;covery of the u&s;eful metals, and the acqui&s;ition of dominion over the animal creation, have been marked as &s;teps of ca|pital importance in their progre&s;s. In our conti|nent, long after men had attained both, &s;ociety continued in that &s;tate which is denominated bar|barous. Even with all that command over nature which the&s;e confer, many ages elap&s;e, before in|du&s;try becomes &s;o regular as to render &s;ub&s;i&s;tence &s;ecure, before the arts which &s;upply the wants and furni&s;h the accommodations of life, are brought to any con&s;iderable degree of perfection, and before any idea is conceived of various in&s;titutions requi&s;ite in a well-ordered &s;ociety. The Mexicans and Pe|ruvians, without knowledge of the u&s;eful metals, or the aid of dome&s;tic animals, laboured under di&s;ad|vantages which mu&s;t have greatly retarded their progre&s;s, and in their highe&s;t &s;tate of improvement their power was &s;o limited, and their operations &s;o feeble, that they can hardly be con&s;idered as having advanced beyond the infancy of civil life.</P>

But our acquaintance with its laws and manners is not, from that circum&s;tance, more complete. What I have remarked concerning the defective and inaccurate information on which we mu&s;t rely with re&s;pect to the condition and cu&s;toms of the &s;avage tribes in America, may be applied likewi&s;e to our knowledge of the Mexican empire. Cortes, and the rapacious adventurers who accompanied him, had not lei&s;ure or capacity to enrich either civil or natural hi&s;tory with new ob&s;ervations. They undertook their expedition in que&s;t of one object, and &s;eemed hardly to have turned their eyes to|wards any other. Or, if during &s;ome &s;hort inter|val of tranquillity, when the occupations of war cea&s;ed, and the ardour of plunder was &s;u&s;pended, the in&s;titutions and manners of the people whom they had invaded drew their attention, the inquiries of illiterate &s;oldiers were conducted with &s;o little &s;agacity and preci&s;ion, that the accounts given by them of the policy and order e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Mexican monarchy are &s;uperficial, confu&s;ed, and in|explicable. It is rather from indicents which they relate occa&s;ionally, than from their own deductions and remarks, that we are enabled to form &s;ome idea of the genius and manners of that people. The ob&s;curity in which the ignorance of its conquerors involved the annals of Mexico, was augmented by the &s;uper&s;tition of tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded them. As the memory of pa&s;t events was pre&s;erved among the Mexicans by figures painted on &s;kins, on cotton cloth, on a kind of pa&s;teboard, or on the bark of trees, the early mi&s;&s;ionaries, unable to comprehend their meaning, and &s;truck with their uncouth forms,

conceived them to be monuments of idolatry which ought to be de&s;troyed, in order to facilitate the con|ver&s;ion of the Indians. In obedience to an edict i&s;&s;ued by Juan de Zummaraga, a Franci&s;can monk, the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Mexico, as many records of the ancient Mexican &s;tory as could be collected were committed to the flames. In con&s;equence of this fanatical zeal of the monks who fir&s;t vi&s;ited New Spain (which their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors &s;oon began to la|ment), whatever knowledge of remote events &s;uch rude monuments contained was almo&s;t entirely lo&s;t, and no information remained concerning the an|cient revolutions and policy of the empire, but what was derived from tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ition, or from &s;ome frag|ments of their hi&s;torical paintings that e&s;caped the barbarous re&s;earches of Zummaraga<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aco&s;ta, lib. vi. c. 7.

From the experience of all nations it is manife&s;t, that the me|mory of pa&s;t tran&s;actions can neither be long pre|&s;erved, nor be tran&s;mitted with any fidelity, by tradition. The Mexican paintings, which are &s;up|po&s;ed to have &s;erved as annals of their empire, are few in number, and of ambiguous meaning. Thus, amid&s;t the uncertainty of the former, and the ob|&s;curity of the latter, we mu&s;t glean what intelligence can be collected from the &s;canty materials &s;cattered in the Spani&s;h writers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In the fir&s;t edition, I ob&s;erved that in con&s;equence of the de&s;truction of the ancient Mexican paintings, occa&s;ioned by the zeal of Zummaraga, whatever knowledge they might have con|veyed was <HI>entirely</HI> lo&s;t. Every candid reader mu&s;t have per|ceived that the expre&s;&s;ion was inaccurate; as in a few lines afterwards I mention &s;ome ancient paintings to be &s;till extant. M. Clavigero, not &s;atisfied with laying hold of this inaccuracy, which I corrected in the &s;ub&s;equent editions, labours to render is more glaring, by the manner in which he quotes the remain|ing part of the &s;entence.

Though &s;everal Spaniards have carried on inquiries into the antiquities of the Mexican empire, no engrav|ings from Mexican paintings have been communicated to the public, except tho&s;e by Purchas, Gemelli Carreri, and Loren|zana. It affords me &s;ome &s;atisfaction, that in the cour&s;e of my re&s;earches, I have di&s;covered two collections of Mexican paint|ings which were unknown to former inquirers. The cut which I publi&s;hed is an exact copy of the original, and gives no high idea of the progre&s;s which the Mexicans had made in the art of paint|ing. I cannot conjecture what could induce M. Clavigero to ex|pre&s;s &s;ome di&s;&s;atisfaction with me for having publi&s;hed it without the &s;ame colours it has in the original painting. p. xxix. He might have recollected, that neither Purchas, nor Gemelli Carreri, nor Lorenzana, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to colour the prints which they have publi&s;hed, and they have never been cen&s;ured on that ac|count. He may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that though the colours in the paintings in the Imperial Library are remarkably bright, they are laid on without art, and without <Q>any of that regard to light and &s;hade, or the rules of per&s;pective,</Q> which M. Cla|vigero requires. V. II. 378. If the public expre&s;s any de&s;ire to have the &s;even paintings &s;till in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion engraved, I am ready to communicate them. The print publi&s;hed by Gemelli Carreri, of the route of the ancient Mexicans when they travelled towards the lake on which they built the capital of their empire, Churchill, Vol. IV. p. 481, is the mo&s;t fini&s;hed monument of art brought from the New World, and yet a very &s;light in&s;pection of it will &s;atisfy every one, that the annals of a nation conveyed in this manner mu&s;t be very meagre and imperfect.</NOTE>.</P>

When the leader of a &s;mall tribe, or the head of a rude community, is dignified with the name of king or emperor, the place of his re&s;idence can receive no other name but that of his palace; and whatever his attendants may be, they mu&s;t be called his court.

Both the&s;e circum&s;tances concur in detracting from the credit due to the de&s;criptions of Mexican manners by the early Spani&s;h writers.

Who among the de&s;troyers of this great empire was &s;o enlightened by &s;cience, or &s;o attentive to the progre&s;s and operations of men in &s;ocial life, as to frame a fictitious &s;y&s;tem of policy &s;o well combined and &s;o con&s;i&s;tent, as that which they delineate, in their accounts of the Mexican government? Where could they have borrowed the idea of many in&s;titutions in legi&s;la|tion and police, to which, at that period, there was nothing parallel in the nations with which they were acquainted? There was not, at the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, a regular e&s;tabli&s;hment of po&s;ts for conveying intelligence to the &s;overeign of any kingdom in Europe. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation will apply to what the Spaniards relate, with re|&s;pect to the &s;tructure of the city of Mexico, the regulations concerning its police, and various laws e&s;tabli&s;hed for the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, or &s;e|curing the happine&s;s of the community. Whoever is accu&s;tomed to contemplate the progre&s;s of na|tions, will often, at very early &s;tages of it, di&s;cover a premature and unexpected dawn of tho&s;e ideas, which give ri&s;e to in&s;titutions that are the pride and ornament of its mo&s;t advanced period. Even in a &s;tate as imperfectly poli&s;hed as the Mexican empire, the happy genius of &s;ome &s;agacious ob|&s;erver, excited or aided by circum&s;tances unknown to us, may have introduced in&s;titutions which are &s;eldom found but in &s;ocieties highly refined. But it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that the illiterate conquerors of the New World &s;hould have formed in any one in&s;tance a conception of cu&s;toms and laws, beyond the &s;tandard of improvement in their own age and country.

<P>IN one particular, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion of the Mexi|cans.</NOTE> the guides whom we mu&s;t follow have repre&s;ented the Mexicans to be more barbarous, perhaps, than they really were. Their religious tenets, and the rites of their wor|&s;hip, are de&s;cribed by them as wild and cruel in an extreme degree. Religion, which occupies no con&s;iderable place in the thoughts of a &s;avage, who&s;e conceptions of any &s;uperior power are ob|&s;cure, and his &s;acred rites few as well as &s;imple, was formed, among the Mexicans, into a regular &s;y&s;tem, with its complete train of prie&s;ts, temples, victims, and fe&s;tivals. This, of it&s;elf, is a clear proof that the &s;tate of the Mexicans was very dif|ferent from that of the ruder American tribes. But from the extravagance of their religious no|tions, or the barbarity of their rites, no conclu&s;ion can be drawn with certainty concerning the degree of their civilization. For nations, long after their ideas begin to enlarge, and their manners to refine, adhere to &s;y&s;tems of &s;uper&s;tition founded on the crude conceptions of early ages. From the genius of the Mexican religion we may, however, form a mo&s;t ju&s;t conclu&s;ion with re&s;pect to its influence upon the character of the people. The a&s;pect of &s;uper&s;tition in Mexico was gloomy and atrocious. Its divinities were clothed with terror, and de|lighted in vengeance. They were exhibited to the people under dete&s;table forms, which created horror. The figures of &s;erpents, of tygers, and of other de&s;tructive animals, decorated their temples. Fear was the only principle that in&s;pired their vo|taries.

the wrath of their gods, and the Mexicans never approached their altars without &s;prinkling them with blood drawn from their own bodies. But, of all offerings, human &s;acrifices were deemed the mo&s;t acceptable.

His pre|cepts were received not merely as the injunctions of a &s;uperior, but as the mandates of the Deity. His race was to be held &s;acred; and in order to pre&s;erve it di&s;tinct, without being polluted by any mixture of le&s;s noble blood, the &s;ons of Manco Capac married their own &s;i&s;ters, and no per&s;on was ever admitted to the throne who could not claim it by &s;uch a pure de&s;cent.

<P>THE &s;uperior ingenuity of the Peruvians is ob|vious, likewi&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their buildings.</NOTE> in the con&s;truction of their hou&s;es and public buildings. In the exten&s;ive plains which &s;tretch along the Pacific Ocean, where the &s;ky is perpetually &s;erene, and the climate mild, their hou&s;es were very properly of a fabric ex|tremely &s;light. But in the higher regions, where rain falls, where the vici&s;&s;itude of &s;ea&s;ons is known, and their rigour felt, hou&s;es were con&s;tructed with greater &s;olidity. They were generally of a &s;quare form, the walls about eight feet high, built with bricks hardened in the &s;un, without any windows, and the door low and &s;trait. Simple as the&s;e &s;truc|tures were, and rude as the materials may &s;eem to be of which they were formed, they were &s;o durable, that many of them &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t in different parts of Peru, long after every monument that might have conveyed to us any idea of the dome&s;tic &s;tate of the other American nations has vani&s;hed from the face of the earth. But it was in the tem|ples con&s;ecrated to the Sun, and in the buildings de&s;tined for the re&s;idence of their monarchs, that the Peruvians di&s;played the utmo&s;t extent of their art and contrivance.

The temple of Pachacamac, together with a pa|lace of the Inca, and a fortre&s;s, were &s;o connected together as to form one great &s;tructure, above half a league in circuit.

But with all the&s;e, and many other imperfections that might be mentioned in their art of building, the works of the Peruvians which &s;till remain, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as &s;tupen|dous efforts of a people unacquainted with the u&s;e of iron, and convey to us an high idea of the power po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by their ancient monarchs.</P>

The Spaniards, allured by the &s;ame of its opulence, early attempted the con|que&s;t of it under Diego Almagro; and after his death, Pedro de Valdivia re&s;umed the de&s;ign. Both met with fierce oppo&s;ition. The former relin|qui&s;hed the enterprize in the manner which I have mentioned<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Book vi. c. 60, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

By de|grees, all the champaign country along the coa&s;t was &s;ubjected to the Spani&s;h dominion. The mountainous country is &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Puel|ches, Araucos, and other tribes of its original in|habitants, formidable neighbours to the Spaniards;

<P>THAT part of Chili then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excellence of its cli|mate and &s;oil.</NOTE> which may properly be deemed a Spani&s;h province, is a narrow di&s;trict, extended along the coa&s;t from the de&s;ert of Ata|camas to the i&s;land of Chiloe, above nine hundred miles. Its climate is the mo&s;t delicious in the New World, and is hardly equalled by that of any re|gion on the face of the earth. Though bordering on the Torrid Zone, it never feels the extremity of heat, being &s;creened on the ea&s;t by the Andes, and refre&s;hed from the we&s;t by cooling &s;ea-breezes. The temperature of the air is &s;o mild and equable, that the Spaniards give it the preference to that of the &s;outhern provinces in their native country. The fertility ot the &s;oil corre&s;ponds with the benignity of the climate, and is wonderfully accommodated to European productions. The mo&s;t valuable of the&s;e, corn, wine, and oil, abound in Chili, as if they had been native to the country. All the fruits imported from Europe attain to full maturity there. The animals of our hemi&s;phere not only multiply, but improve in this delightful region. The horned cattle are of larger &s;ize than tho&s;e of Spain.

In&s;tead of this, a great part of it remains unoccu|pied. In all this extent of country, there are not above eighty thou&s;and white inhabitants, and about three times that number of negroes and people of a mixed race. The mo&s;t fertile &s;oil in America lies uncultivated, and &s;ome of its mo&s;t promi&s;ing mines remain unwrought. Strange as this neglect of the Spaniards to avail them&s;elves of advantages, which &s;eemed to court their acceptance, may ap|pear, the cau&s;es of it can be traced. The only intercour&s;e of Spain with its colonies in the South Sea, was carried on during two centuries by the annual fleet to Porto-bello. All the produce of the&s;e colonies was &s;hipped in the ports of Callao, or Arica in Peru, for Panama, and carried from thence acro&s;s the i&s;thmus. All the commodities which they received from the mother-country, were conveyed from Panama, to the &s;ame harbours. Thus both the exports and imports of Chili pa&s;&s;ed through the hands of merchants &s;ettled in Peru.

which has drawn &s;o much attention, and has been &s;o imperfectly under&s;tood. The latter divi&s;ion of the province contains the governments of Tucuman and Buenos-Ayres, and to the&s;e I &s;hall at pre&s;ent con|fine my ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">View of the latter.</NOTE>THE Spaniards entered this part of America by the river De la Plata; and though a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cruel di&s;a&s;ters be&s;el them in their early attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h their dominion in it, they were encouraged to per&s;i&s;t in the de&s;ign, at fir&s;t by the hopes of di&s;co|vering mines in the interior country, and afterwards by the nece&s;&s;ity of occupying it, in order to prevent any other nation from &s;ettling there, and penetrating by this rout into their rich po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Peru. But except at Buenos-Ayres, they have made no &s;ettle|ment of any con&s;equence in all the va&s;t &s;pace which I have mentioned. There are, indeed, &s;cattered over it, a few places on which they have be&s;towed the name of towns, and to which they have endea|voured to add &s;ome dignity, by erecting them into bi&s;hoprics; but they are no better than paltry vil|lages, each with two or three hundred inhabitants. One circum&s;tance, however, which was not ori|ginally fore&s;een, has contributed to render this di&s;|trict, though thinly peopled, of con&s;iderable import|ance. The province of Tucuman, together with the country to the &s;outh of the Plata, in&s;tead of being covered with wood like other parts of Ame|rica, forms one exten&s;ive open plain, almo&s;t without a tree. The &s;oil is a deep fertile mould, watered by many &s;treams de&s;cending from the Andes, and clothed in perpetual verdure. In this rich pa&s;turage, the hor&s;es and cattle imported by the Spaniards from Europe have multiplied to a degree which al|mo&s;t exceeds belief. This has enabled the inhabit|ants not only to open a lucrative trade with Peru, by &s;upplying it with cattle, hor&s;es, and mules, but
<PB N="343" REF="034476_0850_0FFDDCEDF7FB2188">
to carry on a commerce no le&s;s beneficial, by the exportation of hides to Europe. From both, the colony has derived great advantages. But its com|modious &s;ituation for carrying on contraband trade, has been the chief &s;ource of its pro&s;perity. While the court of Madrid adhered to its ancient &s;y&s;tem, with re&s;pect to its communication with America, the river De la Plata lay &s;o much out of their cour&s;e of Spani&s;h navigation, that interlopers, almo&s;t without any ri&s;k of being either ob&s;erved or ob&s;tructed, could pour in European manufactures in &s;uch quan|tities, that they not only &s;upplied the wants of the colony, but were conveyed into all the ea&s;tern di&s;tricts of Peru. When the Portugue&s;e in Bra&s;il extended their &s;ettlements to the banks of Rio de la Plata, a new channel was opened, by which pro|hibited commodities flowed into the Spani&s;h ter|ritories, with &s;till more facility, and in greater abundance. This illegal traffic, however detri|mental to the parent &s;tate, contributed to the in|crea&s;e of the &s;ettlement, which had the immediate benefit of it, and Buenos-Ayres became gradually a populous and opulent town. What may be the effect of the alteration lately made in the govern|ment of this colony, the nature of which &s;hall be de&s;cribed in the &s;ub&s;equent Book, cannot hitherto be known.</P>

As the country is extremely moun|tainous, deluged with rain during a good part of the year, remarkably unhealthful, and contains no mines of great value, the Spaniards would pro|bably have abandoned it altogether, if they had not been allured to continue by the excellence of the harbour of Porto-bello on the one &s;ea, and that of Panama on the other.

to find a re&s;emblance between what they di&s;|covered in America, and the objects which were familiar to them in Europe. They made &s;ome at|tempts to &s;ettle there, but with little &s;ucce&s;s. The final reduction of the province was accompli&s;hed by means very different from tho&s;e to which Spain was indebted for its other acqui&s;itions in the New World. The ambition of Charles V. often engaged him in operation of &s;uch variety and extent, that his revenues were not &s;ufficient to defray the ex|pence of carrying them into execution. Among other expedients for &s;upplying the deficiency of his funds, he had borrowed large &s;ums from the Vel&s;ers of Aug&s;burgh, the mo&s;t opulent merchants at that time in Europe. By way of retribution for the&s;e, or in hopes, perhaps, of obtaining a new loan, he be&s;towed upon them the province of Venezuela, to be held as an hereditary fief from the crown of Ca&s;|tile, on condition that within a limited time they &s;hould render them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the country, and e&s;tabli&s;h a colony there. Under the direction of &s;uch per&s;ons, it might have been expected, that a &s;ettlement would have been e&s;tabli&s;hed on maxims very different from tho&s;e of the Spaniards, and bet|ter calculated to encourage &s;uch u&s;eful indu&s;try, as mercantile proprietors might have known to be the mo&s;t certain &s;ource of pro&s;perity and opulence. But unfortunately they committed the execution of their plan to &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;oldiers of fortune with which Germany abounded in the &s;ixteenth century.

The fertility of its vallies is not inferior to that of the riche&s;t di&s;tricts in America, and its higher grounds yield gold and precious &s;tones of various kinds. It is not by digging into the bowels of the earth that this gold is found; it is mingled with the &s;oil near the &s;ur|face, and &s;eparated from it by repeated wa&s;hing with water. This operation is carried on wholly by negro &s;laves; for though the chill &s;ubterranean air has been di&s;covered, by experience, to be &s;o fatal to them, that they cannot be employed with advantage in the deep &s;ilver mines, they are more capable of performing the other &s;pecies of labour than Indians. As the natives in the New Kingdom of Granada are exempt from that &s;ervice, which has wa&s;ted their race &s;o rapidly in other parts of Ame|rica, the country is &s;till remarkably populous. Some di&s;tricts yield gold with a profu&s;ion no le&s;s wonderful than that in the vale of Cineguilla, which I have formerly mentioned, and it is often found in large <HI>pepitas,</HI> or grains, which manife&s;t the abundance in which it is produced.

A con&s;iderable trade is carried on with Carthagena, the produce of the mines, and other commodities, being conveyed down the great river of St. Magdalen to that city. On another quarter, the New Kingdom of Granada has a com|munication with the Atlantic by the river Orinoco; but the country which &s;tretches along its banks to|wards the ea&s;t, is little known, and imperfectly oc|cupied by the Spaniards.</P>

Soldiers, accu&s;tomed to the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation of a military life, had neither indu&s;try to carry on any plan of regu|lar cultivation, nor patience to wait for its &s;low but certain returns, In&s;tead of &s;ettling in the val|lies occupied by the natives, where the fertility of the &s;oil would have amply rewarded the diligence of the planter, they cho&s;e to fix their &s;tations in &s;ome of the mountainous regions, frequent both in New Spain and in Peru. To &s;earch for mines of gold and &s;ilver, was the chief object of their acti|vity.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General ideas of the policy of Spain in its colonies.</NOTE>BUT the e&s;tabli&s;hments of the Spaniards in the New World, though fatal to its ancient inhabit|ants, were made at a period when that monarchy was capable of forming them to be&s;t advantage. By the union of all its petty kingdoms, Spain was become a powerful &s;tate, equal to &s;o great an un|dertaking. Its monarchs, having extended their prerogative far beyond the limits which once cir|cum&s;cribed the regal power in every kingdom of Europe, were hardly &s;ubject to controul, either in concerting or in executing their mea&s;ures.

the mo&s;t remote provinces, which had ever been &s;ubjected to any European &s;tate.

<P>THIS early interpo&s;ition of the Spani&s;h crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Early inter|po&s;ition of the regal authority.</NOTE> in order to regulate the policy and trade of its co|lonies, is a peculiarity which di&s;tingui&s;hes their progre&s;s from that of the colonies of any other European nation. When the Portugue&s;e, the Eng|li&s;h, and French, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the regions in America which they now occupy, the advantages which the&s;e promi&s;ed to yield were &s;o remote and uncertain, that their colonies were &s;uffered to &s;truggle through a hard infancy, almo&s;t without guidance or protection from the parent &s;tate. But gold and &s;ilver, the fir&s;t productions of the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in the New World, were more alluring, and immediately attracted the attention of their mo|narchs. Though they had contributed little to the di&s;covery, and almo&s;t nothing to the conque&s;t of the New World, they in&s;tantly a&s;&s;umed the func|tion of its legi&s;lators; and having acquired a &s;pe|cies of dominion formerly unknown, they formed a plan for exerci&s;ing it, to which nothing &s;imilar occurs in the hi&s;tory of human affairs.</P>
<P>THE fundamental maxim of Spani&s;h juri&s;pru|dence with re&s;pect to America,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All power and proper|ty ve&s;ted in the crown.</NOTE> is to con&s;ider what has been acquired there as ve&s;ted in the crown rather than in the &s;tate. By the bull of Alex|ander VI. on which, as its great charter, Spain founded its right, all the regions that had been, or &s;hould be di&s;covered, were be&s;towed as a free gift upon Ferdinand and I&s;abella.

proprietors of the va&s;t territories, which the arms of their &s;ubjects conquered in the New World. From them, all grants of land there flowed, and to them they finally returned. The leaders who conducted the various expeditions, the governors who pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ided over the different colonies, the offi|cers of ju&s;tice, and the mini&s;ters of religion, were all appointed by their authority, and removable at their plea&s;ure.

It is true, that when towns were built, and formed into bodies corporate, the citizens were permitted to elect their own magi&s;trates, who governed them by laws which the community enacted. Even in the mo&s;t de&s;potic &s;tates, this feeble &s;park of liberty is not ex|tingui&s;hed. But in the cities of Spani&s;h America, this juri&s;diction is merely municipal, and is con|fined to the regulation of their own interior com|merce and police.

They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of America by right of conque&s;t, and con&s;cious not only of the feeblene&s;s of their infant &s;ettlements, but aware of the difficulty in e&s;tabli&s;hing their do|minion over regions &s;o exten&s;ive, or in retaining &s;o many reluctant nations under the yoke, they dreaded the intru&s;ion of &s;trangers; they even &s;hun|ned their in&s;pection, and endeavoured to keep them at a di&s;tance from their coa&s;ts. This &s;pirit of jealou&s;y and exclu&s;ion, which at fir&s;t was natural, and per|haps nece&s;&s;ary, augmented as their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in America extended, and the value of them came to be more fully under&s;tood. In con&s;equence of it, a &s;y&s;tem of colonizing was introduced, to which there had hitherto been nothing &s;imilar among mankind. In the ancient world, it was not uncom|mon to &s;end forth colonies. But they were of two kinds only. They were either migrations, which &s;erved to di&s;burden a &s;tate of its &s;uperfluous &s;ub|jects, when they multiplied too fa&s;t for the terri|tory which they occupied; or they were military detachments, &s;tationed as garri&s;ons in a conquered province.

in different parts of Europe, were of the fir&s;t &s;pecies. The Roman colonies were of the &s;econd. In the former, the connection with the mother-country quickly cea&s;ed, and they became independent &s;tates. In the latter, as the disjunction was not complete, the dependence continued. In their American &s;ettlements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Regulati|ons for that pur|po&s;e.</NOTE> the Spani&s;h monarchs took what was peculiar to each, and &s;tudied to unite them. By &s;ending colonies to regions &s;o remote, by e&s;tabli&s;h|ing in each a form of interior policy and admini&s;tra|tion, under di&s;tinct governors, and with peculiar laws, they disjoined them from the mother-country. By retaining in their own hands the rights of legi&s;|lation, as well as that of impo&s;ing taxes, together with the power of nominating the per&s;ons who filled every department of executive government, civil or military, they &s;ecured their dependence upon the parent &s;tate. Happily for Spain, the &s;itu|ation of her colonies was &s;uch, as rendered it po&s;&s;ible to reduce this new idea into practice. Almo&s;t all the countries which &s;he had di&s;covered and occu|pied, lay within the tropics. The productions of that large portion of the globe are different from tho&s;e of Europe, even in its mo&s;t &s;outhern provinces. The qualities of the climate and of the &s;oil natu|rally turn the indu&s;try of &s;uch as &s;ettle there into new channels. When the Spaniards fir&s;t took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their dominions in America, the precious metals which they yielded, were the only object that attracted their attention. Even when their efforts began to take a better direction, they employed them&s;elves almo&s;t wholly in rearing &s;uch peculiar productions of the climate, as, from their rarity or value, were of chief demand in the mother-country. Allured by va&s;t pro&s;pects of immediate wealth, they di&s;dained to wa&s;te their indu&s;try on what was le&s;s lucrative, but of &s;uperior moment.

<P>FROM this brief &s;urvey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Producti|ons of the Spani&s;h co|lonies.</NOTE> &s;ome idea may be formed of the interior &s;tate of the Spani&s;h colonies. The various productions with which they &s;upply and enrich the mother-country, and the &s;y&s;tem of com|mercial intercour&s;e between them, come next in order to be explained. If the dominions of Spain in the New World had been of &s;uch moderate ex|tent, as bore a due proportion to the parent &s;tate, the progre&s;s of her colonizing might have been attended with the &s;ame benefit as that of other na|tions. But when, in le&s;s than half a century, her incon&s;iderate rapacity had &s;eized on countries larger than all Europe, her inability to fill &s;uch va&s;t re|gions with a number of inhabitants &s;ufficient for the cultivation of them, was &s;o obvious, as to give a wrong direction to all the efforts of the coloni&s;ts. They did not form compact &s;ettlements, where in|du&s;try, circum&s;cribed within proper limits, both in its views and operations, is conducted with that &s;ober per&s;evering &s;pirit, which gradually converts what|ever is in its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to a proper u&s;e, and derives thence the greate&s;t advantage. In&s;tead of this, the Spaniards, &s;educed by the boundle&s;s pro&s;pect which opened to them, divided their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Ame|rica into governments of great extent. As their number was too &s;mall to attempt the regular culture of the immen&s;e provinces, which they occupied rather than peopled, they bent their attention to a few objects, that allured them with hopes of &s;udden and exorbitant gain, and turned away with con|tempt from the humbler paths of indu&s;try, which lead more &s;lowly, but with greater certainty, to wealth and increa&s;e of national &s;trength.</P>

Such was the great and &s;udden augmentation of power and revenue, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of America brought into Spain, and &s;ome &s;ymptoms of its pernicious influence upon the political operations of that mo|narchy &s;oon began to appear. For a con&s;iderable time, however, the &s;upply of trea&s;ure from the New World was &s;canty and precarious, and the genius of Charles V. conducted public mea&s;ures with &s;uch prudence, that the effects of this influence were little perceived.

The cacao-tree grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly in &s;everal parts of the torrid zone; but the nuts of the be&s;t quality, next to tho&s;e of Guatimala, and the South Sea, are produced in the rich plains of Caraccas, a province of Tierra Firme.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beneficial effects of it.</NOTE>THE propriety of this innovation, which may be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t liberal effort of Spani&s;h le|gi&s;lation, has appeared from its effects. Prior to the edict in favour of the free trade, Spain derived hardly any benefit from its neglected colonies in Hi&s;paniola, Porto-Rico, Margarita, and Trinidad. Its commerce with Cuba was incon&s;iderable, and that of Yucatan and Campeachy was ingro&s;&s;ed al|mo&s;t entirely by interlopers. But as &s;oon as a ge|neral liberty of trade was permitted, the inter|cour&s;e with tho&s;e provinces revived, and has gone on with a rapidity of progre&s;&s;ion, of which there are few examples in the hi&s;tory of nations. In le&s;s than ten years, the trade of Cuba has been more than tripled. Even in tho&s;e &s;ettlements where, from the langui&s;hing &s;tate of indu&s;try, greater ef|forts were requi&s;ite to re&s;tore its activity, their commerce has been doubled. It is computed, that &s;uch a number of &s;hips is already employed in the free trade, that the tonnage of them far exceeds that of the Galeons and Flota, at the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing aera of their commerce. The benefits of this arrangement are not confined to a few merchants, e&s;tabli&s;hed in a favourite port. They are diffu&s;ed through every province of the kingdom; and by opening a new market for their various produc|tions and manufactures, mu&s;t encourage and add vivacity to the indu&s;try of the farmer and artificer. Nor does the kingdom profit only by what it ex|ports, it derives advantage likewi&s;e from what it receives in return, and has the pro&s;pect of being &s;oon able to &s;upply it&s;elf with &s;everal commodities

Fully &s;en&s;ible of the cau&s;es to which the declen&s;ion of Spain, from her former pro&s;perity, ought to be imputed, they have made it a great object of their policy, to revive a &s;pirit of indu&s;try among their &s;ubjects, and to give &s;uch extent and perfection to their manufactures, as may enable them to &s;upply the demands of America from their own &s;tock, and to exclude fo|reigners from a branch of commerce which has been &s;o fatal to the kingdom.

There is no effort of legi&s;lation more arduous, no experiment in policy more un|certain, than an attempt to revive the &s;pirit of in|du&s;try where it has declined, or to introduce it where it is unknown.

If the quantity of productive indu&s;try, now in Spain, be compared with that of the kingdom under the la&s;t li&s;tle&s;s mo|narchs of the Au&s;trian line, its progre&s;s mu&s;t ap|pear con&s;iderable, and is &s;ufficient to alarm the jea|lou&s;y, and to call forth the mo&s;t vigorous efforts, of the nations now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lucrative trade which the Spaniards aim at wre&s;ting from them.

in the i&s;land of Luconia, was the &s;tation cho&s;en for the capital of this new e&s;tabli&s;hment. From it an active commercial intercour&s;e began with the Chi|ne&s;e, and a con&s;iderable number of that indu&s;trious people, allured by the pro&s;pect of gain, &s;ettled in the Philippine i&s;lands under the Spani&s;h protection.

<P>IN con&s;equence of this indulgence, the inhabitants of that country enjoy advantages unknown in the other Spani&s;h colonies.

<P>THERE is not, in the commercial arrangements of Spain, any circum&s;tance more inexplicable than the permi&s;&s;ion of this trade between New Spain and the Philippines, or more repugnant to its fun|damental maxim of holding the colonies in perpe|tual dependence on the mother-country, by pro|hibiting any commercial intercour&s;e that might &s;ugge&s;t to them the idea of receiving a &s;upply of their wants from any other quarter. This permi&s;|&s;ion mu&s;t appear &s;till more extraordinary, from con&s;idering that Spain her&s;elf carries on no direct trade with her &s;ettlements in the Philippines, and grants a privilege to one of her American colonies, which &s;he denies to her &s;ubjects in Europe. It is
<PB N="436" REF="034476_0942_0FFDDDCE9C4B6880">
probable, that the coloni&s;ts who originally took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Philippines, having been &s;ent out from New Spain, began this intercour&s;e with a country which they con&s;idered, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as their parent &s;tate, before the court of Madrid was aware of its con&s;equences, or could e&s;tabli&s;h regulations in order to prevent it.

<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding this general corruption in the colonies of Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olic re|venue from America.</NOTE> and the diminution of the income belonging to the public, occa&s;ioned by the illicit importations made by foreigners, as well as by the various frauds of which the coloni&s;ts them|&s;elves are guilty in their commerce with the parent &s;tate, the Spani&s;h monarchs receive a very con&s;i|derable revenue from their American dominions. This ari&s;es from taxes of various kinds, which may be divided into three capital branches. The fir&s;t contains what is paid to the king, as &s;ove|reign, or &s;uperior lord of the New World: to this cla&s;s belongs the duty on the gold and &s;ilver rai&s;ed
<PB N="437" REF="034476_0943_0FFDDDD138BBBE20">
from the mines, and the tribute exacted from the Indians; the former is termed by the Spaniards the <HI>right of &s;igniory,</HI> the latter is the <HI>duty of va&s;ulage.</HI> The &s;econd branch comprehends the numerous du|ties upon commerce, which accompany and oppre&s;s it in every &s;tep of its progre&s;s, from the greate&s;t tran&s;actions of the whole&s;ale merchant, to the petty traffic of the vendor by retail. The third includes what accrues to the king, as head of the church, and admini&s;trator of eccle&s;ia&s;tical funds in the New World. In con&s;equence of this he receives the fir&s;t fruits, annates, &s;poils, and other &s;piritual revenues, levied by the apo&s;tolic chamber in Europe; and is entitled, likewi&s;e, to the profit ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of the bull of Cruzado. This bull, which is pub|li&s;hed every two years, contains, an ab&s;olution from pa&s;t offences by the pope, and, among other immu|nities, a permi&s;&s;ion to eat &s;everal kinds of prohibited food, during Lent, and on m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gre days. The monks employed in di&s;per&s;ing tho&s;e bulls, extol their vir|tues with all the fervour of intere&s;ted eloquence; the people, ignorant and credulous, li&s;ten with im|plicit a&s;&s;ent; and every per&s;on in the Spani&s;h colo|nies, of European, Cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lian, or mixed race, pur|cha&s;es a bull, which is deemed e&s;&s;ential to his &s;al|vation, at the rate &s;et upon it by government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XCIX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT may be the amount of tho&s;e various funds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its amount.</NOTE> it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to determine with preci|&s;ion.

But an ac|count,
<PB N="438" REF="034476_0944_0FFDDDD3D8DDBCE8">
apparently no le&s;s accurate than it is cu|rious, has lately been publi&s;hed of the royal re|venue in New Spain, from which we may form &s;ome idea with re&s;pect to what is collected in the other provinces. According to that account, the crown does not receive from all the departments of taxation in New Spain above a million of our money, from which one half mu&s;t be deducted as the expence of the provincial e&s;tabli&s;hment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE C.</NOTE>. Peru, it is probable, yields a &s;um not inferior to this; and if we &s;uppo&s;e that all the other regions of America, including the i&s;lands, furni&s;h a third &s;hare of equal value, we &s;hall not perhaps be far wide from the truth, if we conclude, that the net public revenue of Spain, rai&s;ed in America, does not exceed a million and a half &s;terling. This falls far &s;hort of the immen&s;e &s;ums to which &s;up|po&s;itions, founded upon conjecture, have rai&s;ed the Spani&s;h revenue in America<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See NOTE CI.</NOTE>. It is remark|able, however, upon one account. Spain and Por|tugal are the only European powers, who derive a direct revenue from their colonies. All the ad|vantage that accrues to other nations, from their American dominions, ari&s;es from the exclu&s;ive en|joyment of their trade; but be&s;ide this, Spain has brought her colonies to contribute towards in|crea&s;ing the power of the &s;tate; and in return for protection, to bear a proportional &s;hare of the com|mon burden.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, the &s;um which I have computed to be the amount, of the Spani&s;h revenue from America, ari&s;es wholly from the taxes collected there, and is far from being the whole of what accrues to the king from his dominions in the New World. The heavy duties impo&s;ed on the commo|dities
<PB N="439" REF="034476_0945_0FFDDDD56AF12230">
exported from Spain to America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE CII.</NOTE>, as well as what is paid by tho&s;e which &s;he &s;ends home in re|turn; the tax upon the negro-&s;laves, with which Africa &s;upplies the New World, together with &s;e|veral &s;maller branches of finance, bring large &s;ums into the trea&s;ury, the preci&s;e extent of which I can|not pretend to a&s;certain.</P>
<P>BUT if the revenue which Spain draws from America be great,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> the expence of admini&s;tration in her colonies bears proportion to it. In every department, even of her dome&s;tic police and finances, Spain has adopted a &s;y&s;tem more com|plex, and more encumbered with a variety of tri|bunals, and a multitude of officers, than that of any European nation, in which the &s;overeign po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch exten&s;ive power. From the jealous &s;pirit with which Spain watches over her American &s;ettle|ments, and her endeavours to guard again&s;t fraud in provinces &s;o remote from in&s;pection; boards and officers have been multiplied there with &s;till more anxious attention. In a country where the expence of living is great, the &s;alaries allotted to every per&s;on in public office mu&s;t be high, and mu&s;t load the revenue with an immen&s;e burden. The parade of government greatly augments the weight of it. The viceroys of Mexico, Peru, and the New Kingdom of Granada, as repre&s;entatives of the king's per&s;on, among people fond of often|tation, maintain all the &s;tate and dignity of royalty. Their courts are formed upon the model of that at Madrid, with hor&s;e and foot guards, a hou&s;e|hold regularly e&s;tabli&s;hed numerous attendants, and en&s;igns of power, di&s;playing &s;uch pomp, as hardly retains the appearance of a delegated autho|rity. All the expence incurred by &s;upporting the
<PB N="440" REF="034476_0946_0FFDDDD94E064178">
external and permanent order of government is defrayed by the crown. The viceroys have be&s;ides peculiar appointments &s;uited to their exalted &s;ta|tion. The &s;alaries fixed by law are indeed ex|tremely moderate; that of the viceroy of Peru is only thirty thou&s;and ducats; and that of the vice|roy of Mexico, twenty thou&s;and ducats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Recop. lib. iii. tit. iii. c. 72.</NOTE>. Of late they have been rai&s;ed to forty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>THESE &s;alaries, however, con&s;titute but a &s;mall part of the revenue enjoyed by the viceroys. The exerci&s;e of an ab&s;olute authority extending to every department or government, and the power of di&s;|po&s;ing of many lucrative offices, afford them many opportunities of accumulating wealth. To the&s;e, which may be con&s;idered as legal and allowed emoluments, large &s;ums are often added by ex|actions, which in countries &s;o far removed from the &s;eat of government, it is not ea&s;y to di&s;cover, and impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train. By monopolizing &s;ome branches of commerce, by a lucrative concern in others, by conniving at the frauds of merchants, a viceroy may rai&s;e &s;uch an annual revenue, as no &s;ubject of any European monarch enjoys<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See NOTE CIII.</NOTE>. From the &s;ingle article of pre&s;ents made to him on the anniver&s;ary of his <HI>Name-day</HI> (which is always ob|&s;erved as an high fe&s;tival), I am informed that a viceroy has been known to receive &s;ixty thou&s;and pe&s;os. According to a Spani&s;h &s;aving, the legal revenues of a viceroy are known, his real profits depend upon his opportunities and his con&s;cience. Sen&s;ible of this, the kings of Spain, as I have formerly ob&s;erved, grant a commi&s;&s;ion to their viceroys only for a few years. This circum&s;tance, however, renders them often more rapacious, and
<PB N="441" REF="034476_0947_0FFDDDDADDEB06F0">
adds to the ingenuity and ardour wherewith they labour to improve every moment of power which they know is ha&s;tening fa&s;t to a period; and &s;hort as its duration is, it u&s;ually affords &s;ufficient time for repairing a &s;hattered fortune, or for creating a new one. But even in &s;ituations &s;o trying to hu|man frailty, there are in&s;tances of virtue that re|mains un&s;educed. In the year 1772, the Marquis de Croix fini&s;hed the term of his viceroyalty in New Spain with un&s;u&s;pected integrity; and in|&s;tead of bringing home exorbitant wealth, returned with the admiration and applau&s;e of a grateful people, whom his government had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">endered happy.</P>

<P>OUR knowledge of the events which happened in the conque&s;t of New Spain, is derived from &s;ources of infor|mation more original and authentic than that of any tran&s;action in the hi&s;tory of America. The letters of Cortes to the Emperor Charles V. are an hi&s;torical monument, not only fir&s;t in order of time, but of the greate&s;t authenticit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and value. As Cortes earl a&s;&s;umed a command independent of Vela&s;quez, it became nece&s;&s;ary to convey &s;uch an account of his operations to Madrid, as might procure him the approbation of his &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of his di&s;patches has never been made public. It was &s;ent from Vera-Cruz, July 16th, 1519. As I imagined that it might not reach the Emperor until he arrived in Ger|many, for which he &s;et out early in the year 1520, in order to receive the Imperial crown; I made diligent &s;earch for a copy of this di&s;patch, both in Spain and in Germany, but without &s;ucce&s;s This, however, is of le&s;s con&s;equence, as it could not contain any thing very material, being written &s;o &s;oon after Cor|tes arrived in New Spain. But in &s;earching for the letter from Cortes, a copy of one from the colony of Vera-Cruz to the Em|peror has been di&s;covered in the Imperial library at Vienna. Of this I have &s;ubjoined &s;ome account at the clo&s;e of the Notes to the &s;econd volume. The &s;econd di&s;patch, dated October 30th, 1520, was publi&s;hed at Seville, A. D. 1522, and the third and fourth &s;oon after they were received. A Latin tran&s;lation of them appeared in Germany, A. D. 1532. Ramu&s;io &s;oon after made them more generally known by in&s;erting them in his valuable col|lection. They contain a regular and minute hi&s;tory of the ex|pedition,

with many curious particulars concerning the policy and manners of the Mexicans The work does honour to Cortes; the &s;tyle is &s;imple and per&s;picuous; but as it was manife&s;tly his intere&s;t to repre&s;ent his own actions in the faire&s;t light, his victo|ries are probably exaggerated, his lo&s;&s;es dimini&s;hed, and his acts of rigour and violence &s;oftened.</P>
<P>THE next in order is the Cronica de la Nueva E&s;pagna, by Franci&s;co Lopez de Gomara, publi&s;hed A. D. 1554 Gomara's hi&s;torical merit is con&s;iderable His mode of narration is clear, flowing, always agreeable, and &s;ometimes elegant. But he is frequently inaccurate and credulous; and as he was the dome&s;tic chaplain of Cortes after his return from New Spain and proba|bly compo&s;ed his work at his de&s;ire, it is manife&s;t that he labours to magnify the merit of his hero&punc; and to conceal or extenuate &s;uch tran&s;actions as were unfavourable to his character. Of this Herrera accu&s;es him in one in&s;tance, Dec. ii. lib. iii. c. 2 and it is not once only that this is con&s;picuous. He writes, however, with &s;o much freedom concerning &s;everal mea&s;ures of the Spani&s;h court, that the copies both of his Hi&s;toria de las Indias, and of his Cronica, were called in by a decree of the counci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Indies, and they were long con&s;idered as prohibited books in Spain; it is only of late that licence to print them has been gran|ted. Pinelo Biblioth 589.</P>
<P>THE Chronicle of Gomara induced Bernal Diaz del Ca&s;tillo to compo&s;e his Hi&s;toria Verdadera de la Conqui&s;ta de la Nueva E&s;pagna. He had been an adventurer in each of the expeditions to New Spain, and was the companion of Cortes in all his bat|tles and perils. When he found that neither he him&s;elf, nor many of his fellow-&s;oldiers, were once mentioned by Gomara, but that the fame of all their exploits was a&s;cribed to Cortes; the gallant veteran laid hold of his pen with indignation, and com|po&s;ed his true hi&s;tory. It contains a prolix, minute, confu&s;ed narrative of all Cortes's operations, in &s;uch a rude vu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gar &s;tyle as might be expected from an illiterate &s;oldier. But as he relates tran&s;actions of which he was witne&s;s, and in which he performed a con&s;iderable part, his account bears al the marks of authenticity, and is accompanied with &s;uch a plea&s;ant <HI>naivete,</HI> with &s;uch inter|e&s;ting details, with &s;uch amu&s;ing vanity, and yet &s;o pardonable in an old &s;oldier who had been (as he boa&s;ts) in a hundred and nine|teen battles, as renders his book one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular that is to be found in any language.</P>
<P>PET. Martyr ab Angleria, in a treati&s;e de In&s;ulis nuper in|ventis, added to his Decades de Rebus Oceanicis and Novo Orbe, gives &s;ome account of Cortes's expedition. But he pro|ceeds no farther than to relate what happened after his fir&s;t land|ing. This work, which is brief and &s;light, &s;eems to contain the
<PB N="445" REF="034476_0950_0FFDDDE3025B9B70">
information tran&s;mitted by Cortes in his fir&s;t di&s;patches, emb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lli&s;h|ed with &s;everal particulars communicated to the author by the officers who brought the letters from Cortes.</P>
<P>BUT the book to which the greater part of modern hi&s;torians have had recour&s;e for information concerning the conque&s;t of New Spain, is Hi&s;toria de la Conqui&s;ta de Mexico, por D. Antonio de So is, fir&s;t publi&s;hed A D. 1684. I know no author in any language who&s;e literary fame has ri&s;en &s;o far beyond his real merit. De Solis is reckoned by his countrymen one of the pure&s;t writers in the Ca&s;tilian tongue; and if a foreigner may venture to give his opinion concerning a matter of which Spaniards alone are quali|fied to judge, he is entitled to that prai&s;e. But, though his lan|guage be correct, his ta&s;te in compo&s;ition is far from being ju&s;t. His periods are &s;o much laboured as to be often &s;tiff, and &s;ome|times tumid&punc; the figures which he employs by way of ornament, are frequently trite or improper, and his ob&s;ervations &s;uperficia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. The&s;e blemi&s;hes, however, might ea&s;il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be overlooked, if he were not defective with re&s;pect to all the great qualities of an hi&s;torian. De&s;titute of that patient indu&s;try in re&s;earch, which conducts to the knowledge of truth; a &s;tranger to that impar|tiality which weighs evidence with cool attention; and ever eager to e&s;tabli&s;h his favourite &s;y&s;tem of exalting the character of Cortes into that of a perfect hero, exempt from error, and adorned with every virtue; he is le&s;s &s;olicitous to di&s;cover what was true, than to relate what might appear &s;plendid. When he attempts any critical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, his rea&s;onings are &s;allacious, and founded upon an imperfect view of facts. Though he &s;ometimes quotes the <HI>di&s;patches</HI> of Cortes, he &s;eems not to have con&s;ulted them; and though he &s;ets out with &s;ome cen&s;ure on Gomara, he frequently prefers his authority, the mo&s;t doubtful of any, to that of the other contemporary hi&s;torians.</P>
<P>BUT of all the Spani&s;h writers, Herrera furni&s;hes the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t accurate information concerning the conque&s;t of Mexico, as well as every other tran&s;action of America. The indu&s;try and attention with which he con&s;ulted not only the books, but the original papers and public records, which tended to throw any light upon the &s;ubject of his inquiries, were &s;o great, and he u&s;ually judges of the evidence before him with &s;o much impar|tiality and candour, that his decads may be ranked among the mo&s;t judicious and u&s;eful hi&s;torical collections. If by attempting to relate the various occurrences in the New World in a &s;trict chronological order, the arrangement of events in his work had not been rendered &s;o perplexed, di&s;connected, and ob&s;cure, that it is an unplea&s;ant ta&s;k to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lect from different parts of his book, and piece together the detached &s;hreds of a &s;tory, he might ju&s;tly have been ranked among the mo&s;t eminent hi&s;torians of his coun|try.

<P>THERE is no circum&s;tance in the hi&s;tory of the conque&s;t of America, which is more que&s;tionable than the account of the numerous armies brought into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> again&s;t the Spaniards. As the war with the republic of Tla&s;cala, though of &s;hort dura|tion, was one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable which the Spaniards waged in America, the account given of the Tla&s;calan armies merits &s;ome attention. The only authentic information concerning this is derived from three authors. Cortes in his &s;econd di&s;patch to the emperor, dated at Segura de la Frontera, October 30, 1520, thus e&s;timates the number of their troops; in the fir&s;t battle 6000; in the &s;econd battle 100,000&punc; in the third battle 150,000. Re|lat. ap. Ramus. iii 228. Bernal Diaz del Ca&s;tillo, who was an eye-witne&s;s, and engaged in all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tions of this war, thus reck|ons their numbers; in the fir&s;t battle 3000, p. 43; in the &s;econd battle 6000, ibid. in the third battle 50,000. p. 45. Gomara, who was Cortes's chaplain after his return to Spain and publi&s;hed his <HI>Cronica</HI> in 1552, follows the computation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cortes, except in the &s;econd battle, where he reckons. the Tla&s;calans at 80,000. p. 40. It was manife&s;tly the inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t of Cortes to magnify his own dangers and exploits. For it was only by the merit of extra|ordinary &s;ervices, that he could hope to atone for his irregular con|duct, in a&s;&s;uming an independent command. Bern. Diaz, though abundanly di&s;po&s;ed to place his own prowe&s;s, and that of his fel|low conquerors, in the mo&s;t advantage us point of light, had not the &s;ame temptation to exaggerate; and it is probable, that his ac|count of the numbers approaches nearer to the truth. The a&s;&s;em|bling of an army of 150,000 m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n requires many previous ar|rangements,

and &s;uch provi&s;ion for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence as &s;eems to be beyond the fore&s;ight of Americans. The degree of cultivation in Tla&s;cala does not &s;eem to have been &s;o great, as to have furni&s;h|ed &s;uch a va&s;t army with provi&s;ions.

<P>ACCORDING to Bart, de las Ca&s;as, there was no rea&s;on for this ma&s;&s;acre, and it was an act of wanton cruelty, perpetrated merely to &s;trike terror into the people of New Spain. Relac. de la De&s;truyc. p. 17, &amp;c. But the zeal of Las Ca&s;as often leads him to exaggerate. In oppo&s;ition to him, Bern. Diaz, c. 83, a&s;&s;erts, that the fir&s;t mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;ent into New Spain by the emperor, made a judicial enquiry into this tran&s;action; and having examined the prie&s;ts and elders of Cholula, found that there was a real con&s;piracy to cut off the Spaniards, and that the account given by Cortes was exactly true. As it was the object of Cortes at that time, and manife&s;tly his intere&s;t, to gain the good-will of Montezuma, it is improbable, that he &s;hould have taken a &s;tep which tended &s;o vi&s;ibly to alienate him from the Spaniards, if he had not believed it to be nece&s;&s;ary for his own pre&s;ervation. At the &s;ame time, the Spaniards who &s;erved in America had &s;uch contempt for the natives, and thought them &s;o little entitled to the common rights of men, that Cortes might hold the Cholulans to be guilty upon &s;light and imperfect evi|dence.

<P>CORTES him&s;elf, in his &s;econd di&s;patch to the emperor, does not explain the motives which induced him either to condemn Qualpopoca to the flames, or to put Montezuma in irons. Ramu&s;. iii 236. B. Diaz is &s;ilent with re&s;pect to his rea&s;ons for the for|mer; and the only cau&s;e he a&s;&s;igns for the latter was that he might meet with no interruption in executing the &s;entence pronounced again&s;t Qualpopoca, c. xcv. p. 75. But as Montezuma was his pri&s;oner, and ab&s;olutely in his power, he had no rea&s;on to dread him, and the in&s;ult offered to that monarch could have no effect but to irritate him unnece&s;&s;arily. Gomara &s;uppo&s;es, that Cortes had no other object than to occupy Montezuma with his own di&s;|tre&s;s and &s;ufferings, that he might give le&s;s attention to what befel Qualpopoca Cron. c. 89. Herrera adopts the &s;ame opinion. Dec. ii. lib. viii. c. 9. But it &s;eems an odd expedient, in order to make a per&s;on bear one injury, to load him with another that is greater. De Solis imagines, that Cortes had nothing el&s;e in view than to intimidate Montezuma, &s;o that he might make no attempt to re&s;cue the victims from their fate; but the &s;pirit of that mo|narch was &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and he had &s;o tamely given up the pri&s;oners to the di&s;po&s;al of Cortes, that he had no cau&s;e to apprehend any op|po&s;ition from him. If the explanation which I have attempted to give of Cortes's proceedings on this occa&s;ion be not admitted, it appears to me, that they mu&s;t be reckoned among the wanton and barbarous acts of oppre&s;&s;ion which occur too often in the hi&s;tory of the conque&s;t of America.</P>

Herrera, dec. ii. lib. ix. c. 18. De Solis, lib. iv c. 5. But the chronological order of events refutes this &s;uppo&s;ition. Portocarrero and Montejo &s;ailed from Vera Cruz July 26, 1519. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. v. c. 4. They landed at St. Lucar in October, according to Herrera, ibid. But P Martyr, who attended the court at that time, and communicated every occurrence of moment to his corre&s;pondents day by day, mentions the arrival of the&s;e agents for the fir&s;t time, in December, and &s;peaks of it as a recent event. Epi&s;t. 650. All the hi&s;topians agree, that the agents of Cortes had their fir&s;t audience of the Emperor at Torde&s;illas, when he went to that town to vi&s;it his mother in his way to St. Jago de Compo&s;tella. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. v. c 4. De Solis, lib. iv. c. 5.

With his u&s;ual minutene&s;s, he mentions their names and characters, and relates, in chapter 122, how they were puni&s;hed for their perfidy.

<P>ONE circum&s;tance in this &s;iege merits particular no|tice.&mdash;The account which the Spani&s;h writers give of the numerous armies employed in the attack or defence of Mexico, &s;eems to be incredible According to Cortes him|&s;elf, he had at one time 150,000 auxiliary Indians in his &s;er|vice.

But the quantity of provi&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of &s;uch va&s;t multitudes a&s;&s;embled in one place during three months, is &s;o great, and it requires &s;o much fore&s;ight and arrangement to col|lect the&s;e, and lay them in magazines, &s;o as to be certain of a regular &s;upply, that one can hardly believe that this could be ac|compli&s;hed in a country where agriculture was &s;o imperfect as in the Mexican empire, where there were no t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e animals, and by a people naturally &s;o improvident, and &s;o incapable of executing a complicated plan as the mo&s;t improved Americans. The Spa|niards, with all their care and attention, far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> very poorly, and were often reduced to extreme di&s;tre&s;s for want of provi&s;ions. B.

means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence more than the Spaniards. They fed upon the bodies of the Mexicans whom they killed in battle. Cortes Relat. 176, C. B. Diaz confirms his relation, and adds, that when the Indians returned from Mexico to their own country, they carried with them large quantities of the fle&s;h of the Mexi|cans &s;alted or dried, as a mo&s;t acceptable pre&s;ent to their friends, that they might have the plea&s;ure of feeding upon the bodies of their enemies in their fe&s;tivals, p. 157. De Solis, who &s;eems to con&s;ider it as an imputation of di&s;credit to his countrymen, that they &s;hould act in concert with auxiliaries who fed upon human fle&s;h, is &s;olicitous to prove, that the Spaniards endeavoured to prevent their a&s;&s;ociates from eating the bodies of the Mexicans, lib. v. c. 24. But he has no authority for this from the original hi&s;torians. Neither Cortes him&s;elf&punc; nor B. Diaz, &s;eem to have had any &s;uch &s;cruple; and, on many occa&s;ions, mentions the In|dian repa&s;ts, which were become familiar to them, without any mark of abhorrence. Even with this additional &s;tock of food for the Indians, it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to procure &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for ar|mies amounting to &s;uch numbers as we find in the Spani&s;h writers. Perhaps the be&s;t &s;olution of the difficulty is, to adopt the opinion of B. Diaz del Ca&s;tillo, the mo&s;t artle&s;s of all the <HI>Hi&s;toriadores primitivos.</HI> "When Gomara (&s;ays he) on &s;ome occa&s;ions re|lates, that there were &s;o many thou&s;and Indians our auxiliaries, and others, that there were &s;o many thou&s;and hou&s;es in this or that town, no regard is to be paid to his enumeration, as he has no authority for it, the numbers not being in reality the fifth of what he relates. If we add together the different numbers which he mentions, that country would contain more millions than there are in Ca&s;tile." C. 129. But though &s;ome con&s;iderable de|duction &s;hould certainly be made from the Spani&s;h accounts of the Mexican forces, they mu&s;t have been very numerous; for nothing but an immen&s;e &s;uperiority in number could have enabled them to with&s;tand a body of nine hundred Spaniards, conducted by a leader of &s;uch abilities as Cortes.</P>

<P>THE motive for undertaking this expedition was, to puni&s;h Chri&s;toval de Olid, one of his officers, who had revolted again&s;t him, and aimed at e&s;tabli&s;hing an independent juri&s;diction.

He marched, according to Gomara, three thou&s;and miles, through a country abounding with thick fore&s;ts, rugged mountains, deep rivers, thinly inhabited, and cultivated only in a few places.

<P>IN tracing the progre&s;s of the Spani&s;h arms in New Spain, we have followed Cortes him&s;elf as our mo&s;t certain guide. His di&s;patches to the emperor contain a minute account of his opera|tions. But the unlettered conqueror of Peru was incapable of relating his own exploits. Our information with re&s;pect to them, and other tran&s;actions in Peru, is derived however from contem|porary and re&s;pectable authors.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t early account of Pizarro's tran&s;actions in Peru, was publi&s;hed by Franci&s;o de Xerez, his &s;ecretary. It is a &s;im|ple unadorned narrative, carried down no farther than the death of Atahualpa in 1533; for the author returned to Spain in 1534, and &s;oon after he landed, printed at Seville his &s;hort Hi&s;tory of the Conque&s;t of Peru, addre&s;&s;ed to the emperor.</P>
<P>DON PEDRO SANCHO, an officer who &s;erved under Pizarro, drew up an account of his expedition, which was tran&s;lated into Italian by Ramu&s;io, and in&s;erted in his valuable collection, but has never been publi&s;hed in its original language. Sancho re|turned to Spain at the &s;ame time with Xerez. Great credit is

due to what both the&s;e authors relate concerning the progre&s;s and operations of Pizarro; but the re&s;idence of the Spaniards in Peru had been &s;o &s;hort, at the time w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en they left it, and their inter|cour&s;e with the natives &s;o &s;lender, that their knowledge of the Pe|ruvian manners and cu&s;toms is very imperfect.</P>
<P>THE next contemporary hi&s;torian is Pedro Cieza de Leon, who publi&s;hed his Cronica del Peru, at Seville, in 1553. If he had fini&s;hed all that he propo&s;es in the general divi&s;ion of his work, it would have been the mo&s;t complete hi&s;tory which had been publi&s;hed of any region in the New World. He was well qualified to execute it, having &s;erved during &s;eventeen years in America, and having vi&s;ited in per&s;on mo&s;t of the provinces concerning which he had occa&s;ion to write. But only the fir&s;t part of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hronicle has been printed. It contains a de&s;cription of Peru, and &s;everal of the adjacent provinces, with an account of the in&s;titutions and cu&s;toms of the natives, and is written with &s;o little art, and &s;uch an apparent regard for truth, that one mu&s;t regret the lo&s;s of the other parts of his work.</P>
<P>THIS lo&s;s is amply &s;upplied by Don Augu&s;tine Zarate, who publi&s;hed, in 1555, his Hi&s;toria del De&s;cubrimiento y Conque&s;ta de la Provincia del Peru. Zarate was a man of rank and educa|tion, and employed in Peru as comptroller-general of the public revenue. His hi&s;tory, whether we attend to its matter or com|po&s;ition, is a book of con&s;iderable merit; as he had an opportu|nity to be well informed, and &s;eems to have been inqui&s;itive with re&s;pect to the manners and tran&s;actions of the Peruvians, great credit is due to his te&s;timony.</P>
<P>DON DIEGO FERNANDEZ publi&s;hed his Hi&s;toria del Peru, in 1571. His &s;ole object is to relate the di&s;&s;en&s;ions and civil wars of the Spaniards in that empire. As he &s;erved in a public &s;tation in Peru, and was well acquainted both with the country, and with the principal actors in tho&s;e &s;ingular &s;cenes which he de&s;cribes, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ound under&s;tanding and great impartiality, his work may be ranked among tho&s;e of the hi&s;torians mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their indu&s;try in re&s;earch, or their capacity in judging with re&s;pect to the events which they relate.</P>
<P>THE <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t author who can be reckoned among the contempo|rary hi&s;torians of the conque&s;t of Peru, is Garcila&s;&s;o de la Ve|ga Inca.

with the traditions of his countrymen, his authority is rated very high, and often placed above that of all the other hi&s;tori|ans. His work, however, is little more than a commentary up|on the Spani&s;h writers of the Peruvian &s;tory, and compo&s;ed of quotations taken from the authors whom I have mentioned. This is the idea which he him&s;elf gives of it, Lib. i. c. 10. Nor is it in the account of facts only that he follows them &s;ervilely. Even in explaining the in&s;titutions and rites of his ance&s;tors, his information &s;eems not to be more perfect than theirs. His explanation of the Quipos is almo&s;t the &s;ame with that of Aco&s;ta. He produces no &s;pecimen of Peruvian poe|try, but that wretched one which he borrows from Blas Valera, an early mi&s;&s;ionary, who&s;e memoirs have never been publi&s;hed. Lib. ii. c. 15. As for compo&s;ition, arrangement, or a capa|city of di&s;tingui&s;hing between what is fabulous, what is proba|ble, and what is true, one &s;earches for them in vain in the commentaries of the Inca. His work, however notwith&s;tand-its great defects, is not altogether de&s;titute of u&s;e. Some tra|ditions which he received from his countrymen are pre&s;erved in it His knowledge of the Peruvian language has enabled him to correct &s;ome errors of the Spani&s;h writers, and he has in&s;erted in it &s;ome curious facts, taken from authors who&s;e works were never publi&s;hed, and are now lo&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XXXV. p. 177.</HEAD>
<P>TWO different &s;y&s;tems have been formed concerning the con|duct of Atahualpa. The Spani&s;h writers, in order to ju&s;|tify the violence of their countrymen, contend, that all the In|ca's profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip were feigned; and that his intention in agreeing to an interview with Pizarro at Caxamalca, was to cut off him and his followers at one blow; that for this purpo&s;e he advanced with &s;uch a numerous body of attendants, who had arms concealed under their garments to execute this &s;cheme. This is the account given by Xeres and Zarate, and adopted by Herrera. But if it had been the plan of the Inca to de&s;troy the Spaniards, one can hardly imagine that he would have permitted them to march unmole&s;ted through the de&s;ert of Motupe, or have neglected to defend the pa&s;&s;es in the mountains, where they might have been attacked with &s;o much advantage. If the Peruvians marched to Caxamalca with an intention to fall upon the Spaniards, it is in|conceivable, that of &s;o great a body of men, prepared for action, not one &s;hould attempt to make re&s;i&s;tance, but all tamely &s;uffered them&s;elves to be butchered by an enemy whom they were armed to attack. Atahualpa's mode of advancing to the interview, has the a&s;pect of a peaceable proce&s;&s;ion, not of a military enterpri&s;e. He him&s;elf and his followers were, in their habits of ceremony, preceded, as on days of &s;olemnity, by unarmed harbingers. Though rude nations are frequently cunning and fal&s;e, yet, if a &s;cheme of deception and treachery mu&s;t be imputed either to a monarch&punc; that had no great rea&s;on to be alarmed at a vi&s;it from &s;trangers who &s;olicited admi&s;&s;ion into his pre&s;ence as friends, or to an adventurer &s;o daring, and &s;o little &s;crupulous as Pizarro, one cannot he&s;itate in determining where to fix the pre&s;umption of guilt. Even amid&s;t the endeavour of the Spani&s;h writers to palli|ate the proceedings of Pizarro, one plainly perceives, that it was his intention, as well as his intere&s;t, to &s;eize the Inca, and that he had taken mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e previous to any &s;u&s;picion of that monarch's de&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="464" REF="034476_0969_0FFDDE17C62ADB80">GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA, extremely &s;olicitous to vindicate his countrymen, the Peruvians, from the crime of having con|certed the de&s;truction of Pizarro and his followers, and no le&s;s afraid to charge the Spaniards with improper conduct towards the Inca, has framed another &s;y&s;tem. He relates, that a man of maje&s;tic form, with a long beard, and garments reaching to the ground, having appeared in a vi&s;ion to Viracocha, the eighth Inca, and declared, that he was a child of the Sun, that monarch built a temple in honour of this per&s;on, and erected an image of him, re&s;embling as nearly as po&s;&s;ible the &s;ingular form in which he had exhibited him&s;elf to his view. In this temple, divine honours were paid to him, by the name of Viracocha. P. i. lib. iv. c. 21. lib. v. c. 22. When the Spaniards fir&s;t appeared in Peru, the length of their beards, and the dre&s;s they wore, &s;truck every per&s;on &s;o much with their likene&s;s to the image of Viraco|cha, that they &s;uppo&s;ed them to be children of the Sun, who had de&s;cended from heaven to earth. All concluded, that the fatal period of the Peruvian empire was now approaching, and that the throne would be occupied by new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Atahualpa him&s;elf, con&s;idering the Spaniards as me&s;&s;engers from heaven, was &s;o far from entertaining any thoughts of re&s;i&s;ting them, that he determined to yield implicit obedience to their commands. From tho&s;e &s;entiments flowed his profe&s;&s;ions of love and re&s;pect. To tho&s;e were owing the cordial reception of Soto and Ferdinand Pi|zarro in his camp, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive reverence with which he him&s;elf advanced to vi&s;it the Spani&s;h general in his quarters; but from the gro&s;s ignorance or Philipillo, the interpreter, the de|claration of the Spaniards, and his an&s;wer to it, were &s;o ill ex|plained, that by their mutual inability to comprehend each other's intentions, the fatal rencounter at Caxamalca, with all its dread|ful con&s;equences, was occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that no traces of this &s;uper&s;titious veneration of the Peruvians for the Spaniards are to be found either in Xe|res, or Sancho, or Zarate, previous to the interview at Caxamalca; and yet the two former &s;erved under Pizarro at that time, and the latter vi&s;ited Peru &s;oon after the conque&s;t. If either the Inca him&s;elf, or his me&s;&s;enger, had addre&s;&s;ed the Spaniards in the words which Garci a&s;&s;o puts in their mouths, they mu&s;t have been &s;truck with &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive declarations; and they would certainly have availed them&s;elves of them to accompli&s;h their own de&s;igns with greater facility. Garcila&s;&s;o him&s;elf, though his narrative of the intercour&s;e between the Inca and Spani|ards, preceding the rencounter at Caxamalca, is founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition of his believing them to be Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acochas, or di|vine beings, p. ii. lib. i. c. 17, &amp;c. yet with his u&s;ual inat|tention and inaccuracy he admits, in another place, that the

<P>IN my inquiries concerning the manners and policy of the Mexicans, I have received much information from a large manu&s;cript of Don Alon&s;o de Corita, one of the judges in the Court of Audience of Mexico. In the year 1553, Philip II. in order to di&s;cover the mode of levying tribute from his Indian &s;ubjects, that would be mo&s;t beneficial to the crown, and lea&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive to them, addre&s;&s;ed a mandate to all the Courts of Au|dience in America, enjoining them to an&s;wer certain queries which he propo&s;ed to them, concerning the ancient form of government e&s;tabli&s;hed among the various nations of Indians, and the mode in which they had been accu&s;tomed to pay taxes to their kings or chiefs. In obedience to this mandate, Corita, who had re&s;ided nineteen years in America, fourteen of which he pa&s;&s;ed in New Spain, compo&s;ed the work of which I have a copy. He acquaints his &s;overeign, that he had made it an object during his re&s;idence in America, and in all its provinces which he had vi&s;ited, to inquire diligently into the man|ners
<PB N="470" REF="034476_0975_0FFDDE2953172948">
and cu&s;toms of the natives, that he had conver&s;ed for this pur|po&s;e with many aged and intelligent Indians, and con&s;ulted &s;everal of the Spani&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who under&s;tood the Indian languages mo&s;t perfectly, particularly &s;ome of tho&s;e who landed in New Spain &s;oon after the conque&s;t. Corita appears to be a man of &s;ome learning, and to have carried on his inquiries with the diligence and accuracy to which he pretends. Great|er credit is due to his te&s;timony from one circum&s;tance. His work was not compo&s;ed with a view to publication, or in &s;up|port of any particular theory, but contains &s;imple, though full an&s;wers to queries propo&s;ed to him officially. Though Her|rera does not mention him among the authors whom he had followed as guides in his hi&s;tory, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, from &s;everal facts of which he takes notice, as well as from &s;everal expre&s;|&s;ions which he u&s;es, that this memorial of Corita was not un|known to him.</P>

Cortes de|&s;cribes the extent and populou&s;ne&s;s of Mexico in general terms, which imply that it was not inferior to the greate&s;t cities in Europe.

Tho&s;e who held offices of honour or tru&s;t, paid a certain &s;hare of what they received in con&s;equence of holding the&s;e. 4. Each <HI>Capullae,</HI> or a&s;&s;ociation, cultivated &s;ome part of the common field allotted to it, for the behoof of the crown, and depo&s;ited the produce in the royal granaries. 5. Some part of whatever was brought to the public markets, whe|ther fruits of the earth, or the various productions of their arti&s;ts and manufacturers, was demanded for the public u&s;e, and the merchants who paid this were exempted from every other tax. 6.

Don Antonio Men|doza viceroy of New Spain, having deemed tho&s;e paintings a proper pre&s;ent for Charles V. the &s;hip in which they were &s;ent to Spain was taken by a French cruizer, and they came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Thevet, the king's geographer who having travelled him&s;elf into the New World, and de&s;cribed one of its provinces, was a curious ob&s;erver of whatever tended to illu&s;trate the man|ners of the Americans. On his death, they were purcha&s;ed by Hak|layt, at that time chaplain of the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador to the French

court; and, being left by him to Purchas, were publi&s;hed at the de&s;ire of the learned antiquary Sir Henry Spelman. Purchas, iii. 1065. They were tran&s;lated from Engli&s;h into French by Mel|chizedeck Thevenot, and publi&s;hed in his collection of voyages, A. D. 1683.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd &s;pecimen of Mexican picture-writing, was publi&s;hed by Dr. Francis Gemelli Carreri, in two copperplates. The fir&s;t is a map or repre&s;entation of the progre&s;s of the ancient Mexicans on their fir&s;t arrival in the country, and of the various &s;tations in which they &s;ettled, before they founded the capital of their em|pire in the lake of Mexico. The &s;econd is a Chronological Wheel, or Circle, repre&s;enting the manner in which they computed and marked their cycle of fifty-two years. He received both from Don Carlos de Siguenza y Congorra, a diligent collector of an|cient Mexican documents. But as it &s;eems now to be a received opinion (founded, as far as I know on no good evidence) that Car|reri was never out of Italy, and that his famous <HI>Giro del Mundo</HI> is an account of a fictitious voyage, I have not mentioned the&s;e paintings in the text. They have, however, manife&s;tly the appear|ance of being Mexican productions and are allowed to be &s;o by Boturini, who was well qualified to determine whether they were genuine or &s;uppo&s;itious. M. Clavigero, likewi&s;e, ad|mits them to be genuine paintings of the ancient Mexicans. To me they always appeared to be &s;o, though, from my de|&s;ire to re&s;t no part of my narrative upon que&s;tionable autho|rity, I did not refer to them. The &s;tyle of painting in the former is con&s;iderably more perfect than any other &s;pecimen of Mexican de&s;ign; but as the original is &s;aid to have been much defaced by time, I &s;u&s;pect that it has been improved by &s;ome touches from the hand of an European arti&s;t. Carreri, Churchill, iv. p. 487. The chronological wheel is a ju&s;t delinea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of the Mexican mode of computing time, as de&s;cribed by Aco&s;ta, lib. vi. c. 2. It &s;eems to re&s;emble one which that lear|ned Je&s;uit had &s;een; and if it be admitted as a genuine monument, it proves that the Mexicans had artificia or arbitrary characters, which repre&s;ented &s;everal things be&s;ides numbers. Each month is there repre&s;ented by a &s;ymbol expre&s;&s;ive of &s;ome work or rite peculiar to it.</P>
<P>THE third &s;pecimen of Mexican painting was di&s;covered by another Italian. In 1736, Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci &s;et out for New Spain, and was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by &s;everal incidents to &s;tudy the lan|guage of the Mexicans, and to collect the remains of their hi&s;to|rical monuments. He per&s;i&s;ted nine years in his re&s;earches, with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a projector, and the patience of an antiquary. In 1746, he publi&s;hed at Madrid. <HI>Idea de una Nueva Hi&s;toria General de la America Septentrianal,</HI> containing an account of the
<PB N="475" REF="034476_0980_0FFDDE3704E0B7E0">
re&s;ult of his inquiries; and he added to it a catalogue of his A|merican Hi&s;torical Mu&s;eum, arranged under thirty &s;ix different heads. His idea of a New Hi&s;tory appears to me the work of a whim&s;ical credulous man. But his catalogue of Mexican maps, paintings, tributerols, calendars, &amp;c. is much larger than one could have expected. Unfortunately a &s;hip, in which he had &s;ent a con&s;iderable part of them to Europe, was taken by an Engli&s;h privateer during the war between Great Britain and Spain which commenced in the year 1739; and it is probable that they peri&s;h|ed by falling into the hands of ignorant captors Boturini him&s;elf incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of the Spani&s;h court, and died in an ho&s;|pital at Madrid. The hi&s;tory, of which the <HI>Idea,</HI> &amp;c. was only a <HI>pro&s;pectus,</HI> was never publi&s;hed. The remainder of his Mu&s;eum &s;eems to have been di&s;per&s;ed. Some part of it came into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent archbi&s;hop of Toledo, when he was pri|mate of New Spain, and he publi&s;hed from it that curious tribute-roll which I have mentioned.</P>
<P>THE only other collection of Mexican paintings, as far as I can learn, is in the Imperial Library at Vienna. By order of their Imperial Maje&s;ties, I have obtained &s;uch a &s;pecimen of the&s;e as I de&s;ired, in eight paintings, made with &s;o much fidelity, that I am informed the copies could hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ori|ginals. According to a note in this <HI>Codex Mexicanus,</HI> it appears to have been a pre&s;ent from Emmanuel King of Portugal to Pope Clement VII. who died A. D. 1533. After pa&s;&s;ing through the hands of &s;everal illu&s;trious proprietors, it fell into tho&s;e of the cardinal of Saxe-Eifenach, who pre&s;ented it to the emperor Leo|pold. The&s;e paintings are manife&s;tly Mexican, but they are in a &s;tyle very different from any of the former. An engraving has been made of one of them, in order to gratify &s;uch of my readers as may deem this an object worthy their attention. Were it an object of &s;ufficient importance, it might, perhaps, be po&s;&s;ible, by recour&s;e to the plates of Purchas, and the archbi&s;hop of Toledo, as a key, to form plau&s;ible conjectures concerning the meaning of this picture. Many of the figures are evidently &s;imilar. A. A. are targets and darts, almo&s;t in the &s;ame form with tho&s;e publi&s;hed by Purchas, p. 1070, 1071, &amp;c. B. B. are figures of temples, nearly re&s;embling tho&s;e in Purchas, p. 1109 and 1113. and in Lorenzana, Plate II. C. is a bale of mantles, or cotton cloths, the figure of which occurs in almo&s;t every Plate of Purchas and Lorenzana. E. E.

<P>SINCE I publi&s;hed the former Edition, Mr. Waddilove, who is &s;till plea&s;ed to continue his friendly attention to procure me in|formation, has di&s;covered, in the Library of the E&s;curial, a vo|lume in folio, con&s;i&s;ting of forty &s;heets of a kind of pa&s;teboard, each the &s;ize of a common &s;heet of writing paper, with great va|riety of uncouth and whim&s;ical figures of Mexican painting, in very fre&s;h colours, and with an explanation in Spani&s;h to mo&s;t of them. The fir&s;t twenty-two &s;heets are the &s;igns of the months, days, &amp;c. About the middle of each &s;heet are two or more large, figures for the month, &s;urrounded by the &s;igns of the days. The la&s;t eighteen &s;heets are not &s;o filled with figures. They &s;eem to be &s;igns of Deities, and images of various objects. According to this Calendar in the E&s;curial, the Mexican year contained 286 days, divided into 22 months of 13 days. Each day is repre|&s;ented by a different &s;ign, taken from &s;ome natural object, a &s;er|pent, a dog, a lizard, a reed, a hou&s;e, &amp;c. The &s;igns of the days in the Calendar of the E&s;curial are preci&s;ely the &s;ame with tho&s;e mentioned by Boturini, Idea, &amp;c. p. 45. But, if we may give credit to that Author, the Mexican year contained 360 days, divided into 18 months of 20 days. The order of days in every month was computed, according to him, fir&s;t by what he calls a <HI>tridecennary</HI> progre&s;&s;ion of days from one to thirteen, in the &s;ame manner as in the Calendar of the E&s;curial, and then by a <HI>&s;epte|nary</HI> progre&s;&s;ion of days from one to &s;even, making in all twenty. In this Calendar, not only the &s;igns which di&s;tingui&s;h each day, but the qualities &s;uppo&s;ed to be peculiar to each month, are marked. There are certain weakne&s;&s;es which &s;eem to accompany the human mind through every &s;tage of its progre&s;s in ob&s;ervation and &s;cience. Slender as was the knowledge of the Mexicans in A&s;tronomy, it appears to have been already connected with judicial A&s;trology. The fortune and character of per&s;ons born in each month, are &s;uppo&s;ed to be decided by &s;ome &s;uperior influence predominant at the time of nativity. Hence it is foretold in the Calendar, that all who are born in one month will be rich, in another warlike, in a third luxurious, &amp;c. The pa&s;teboard or whatever &s;ub&s;tance it may be on which the Calendar in the E&s;curial is painted, &s;eems, by Mr. Waddilove's de&s;cription of it, to re&s;emble nearly that in the Imperial Library at Vienna. In &s;everal particulars, the figures bear &s;ome likene&s;s to tho&s;e in the plate which I have publi&s;hed. The figures marked D. which induced me to conjecture, that this painting might be a tribute-roll &s;imilar to the&s;e publi&s;hed by Pur|chas and the Archbi&s;hop of Toledo, Mr. Waddilove &s;uppo&s;es to
<PB N="477" REF="034476_0982_0FFDDE3C64D7ABD0">
be &s;igns of days; and I have &s;uch confidence in the accuracy of his ob&s;ervations, as to conclude his opinion to be well founded. It appears from the characters in which the explanations of the figures are written, that this curious monument of Mexican art has been obtained, &s;oon after the conque&s;t of the empire. It is &s;ingular that it &s;hould never have been mentioned by any Spani&s;h Author.</P>

<P>THE exaggeration of the Spani&s;h hi&s;torians, with re&s;pect to the number of human victims &s;acrificed in Mexico, appears to be very great. According to Gomara, there was no year in which twenty thou&s;and human victims were not offered to the Mexican Divinities, and in &s;ome years they amounted to fifty thou&s;and. Cron. c. 229. The &s;kulls of tho&s;e unhappy per&s;ons were ranged in order in a building erected for that purpo&s;e, and two of Cortes's officers, who had counted them, informed Gomara that their number was an hundred and thirty-&s;ix thou|&s;and. Ibid. c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">2. Herrera's account is &s;till more incredible, that the number of victims was &s;o great, that five thou&s;and have been &s;acrificed in one day, nay, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, no le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and. Dec. iii. lib. ii. c. 16. Torquemada goes beyond both in extravagance, for he a&s;&s;erts, that twenty thou&s;and children, exclu&s;ive of other victims, were &s;laughtered annually. Mon. Ind. lib. 21, ii. c. 16. The mo&s;t re&s;pectable authority in favour of &s;uch high numbers is that of Zumuriaga, the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Mexico, who in a letter to the chapter general of his order, A. D. 1631, a&s;&s;erts that the Mexicans &s;acrificed annually twenty thou&s;and victims. Davila Teatro Eccle&s;. 126. In oppo&s;ition to all the&s;e accounts, B. de las Ca&s;as ob&s;erves, that if there had been &s;uch an annual wa&s;te of the human &s;pecies, the country could never have arrived at that degree of populou&s;ne&s;s, for which it was remarkable when the Spaniards fir&s;t landed there. This rea&s;oning is ju&s;t. If the number of victims in all the pro|vinces of New Spain had been &s;o great, not only mu&s;t population have been prevented from increa&s;ing, but the human race mu&s;t have been exterminated in a &s;hort time.

of the &s;pecies by &s;uch numerous &s;acrifices, it is ob&s;ervable that wherever the fate of captives taken in war is either certain death or perpetual &s;lavery, as men can gain nothing by &s;ubmitting &s;peedily to an enemy, they always re&s;i&s;t to the uttermo&s;t, and war becomes bloody and de&s;tructive to the la&s;t degree.

<P>IT is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the Peruvian Chronology is not only ob&s;cure, but repugnant to conclu&s;ion deduced from the mo&s;t accurate and exten&s;ive ob&s;ervations, concerning the time that elap&s;es during each reign, in any given &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of princes.

Aco&s;ta mea&s;ured one, which was thirty feet long, eighteen broad, and &s;ix in thickne&s;s; and yet he adds, that in the fortre&s;s at Cuzco, there were &s;tones con&s;iderably larger. It is difficult to conceive how the Peruvians could move the&s;e, and rai&s;e them to the height even of twelve feet. The &s;e|cond
<PB N="482" REF="034476_0987_0FFDDE4B58A1E880">
circum&s;tance is, the imperfection of the Peruvian art, when applied to working in timber. By the patience and per&s;everance natural to Americans, &s;tones may be formed into any &s;hape, merely by rubbing one again&s;t another, or by the u&s;e of hatchets or other in&s;truments made of &s;tone; but with &s;uch rude tools, lit|tle progre&s;s can be made in carpentry. The Peruvians could not mortize two beams together, or give any degree of union or &s;ta|bility to any work compo&s;ed of timber. As they could not form a centre, they were totally unacquainted with the u&s;e of arches in building, nor can the Spani&s;h authors conceive how they were able to frame a roof for tho&s;e ample &s;tructures which they rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE third circum&s;tance is a &s;triking proof, which all the monu|ments of the Peruvians furni&s;h, of their want of ingenuity and invention accompanied with patience no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing. None of the &s;tones employed in tho&s;e works were formed into any par|ticular or uniform &s;hape, which could render them &s;it for being compacted together in building. The Indians took them as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell from the mountains, or were rai&s;ed out of the quarries. Some were &s;quare, &s;ome triangular, &s;ome convex, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me concave. Their art and indu&s;try were employed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ining them together, by form|ing &s;uch hollows in the one, as perfectly corre&s;ponded to the pro|jections or ri&s;ings in the other. This tedious operation, which might have been &s;o ea&s;ily abridged, by adapting the &s;urface of the &s;tones to each other, either by rubbing, or by their hatchets of copper, would be deemed incred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble, if it were not put beyond doubt by in&s;pecting the remains of tho&s;e buildings. It gives them a very &s;ingular appearance to an European eye.

<P>P. Torribio de Benevente, or Motolinea, has enumerated ten cau&s;es of the rapid depopulation of Mexico, to which he gives the name of the Ten Plagues. Many of the&s;e are not peculiar to that province. 1. The introduction of the &s;mall-pox. This d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ca&s;e was fir&s;t brought into New Spain in the year 1520, by a negro &s;lave who attended Narvaez in his expedition again&s;t Cortes. Torribio affirms, that one half of the people in the provin|ces vi&s;ited with this di&s;temper, died. To this mortality occa&s;ioned by the &s;mall-pox, Torquemada adds the de&s;tructive effects of two contageous di&s;tempers which raged in the years 1545 and 1576. In the former 800,000, in the latter above two millions peri&s;hed, according to an exact account taken by order of the viceroys. Mon. Ind. i. 642. The &s;mall-pox was not introduced into Peru for &s;everal years after the inva&s;ion of the Spaniards, but there too that di&s;temper proved very fatal to the natives. Garcia Origen, p. 88. 2. The number who were killed or died of famine in the war with the Spaniards, particularly during the &s;iege of Mexico. 3. The great famine that followed after the reduction of Mexico, as all the people engaged, either on one &s;ide or other, had neglected the cultivation of their lands. Something &s;imilar to this happened in all the other countries conquered by the Spaniards. 4. The grievous ta&s;ks impo&s;ed by the Spaniards upon the people belonging to their Repartimientos. 5. The oppre&s;&s;ive burden of taxes which they were unable to pay, and from which they could hope for no exemption. 6. The numbers employed in collecting the gold, carried down by the torrents from the mountains, who were forced from their own habitations, without any provi&s;ion made for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and &s;ubjected to all the rigour of cold in tho&s;e elevated regions. 7. The immen&s;e labour of rebuilding Mexico, which Cortes urged on with &s;uch precipitate ardour, as de&s;troyed an incredible num|ber of people. 8. The number of people condemned to &s;ervitude, under various pretexts, and employed in working the &s;ilver mines. The&s;e marked by each proprietor with a hot iron, like his cattle, were driven in herds to the mountains. The na|ture of the labour to which they were &s;ubjected there, the noxi|ous vapours of the mines, the coldne&s;s of the climate, and &s;carcity of food, were &s;o fatal, that Torribio affirms, the coun|try

round &s;everal of tho&s;e mines, particularly near Guaxago, was covered with dead bodies, the air corrupted with their &s;tench, and &s;o many vultures, and other voracious birds, ho|vered about for their prey, that the &s;un was darkened with their flight. 10. The Spaniards, in the different expeditions which they undertook, and by the civil wars which they carried on, de&s;troyed many of the natives whom they compelled to &s;erve them as <HI>Tamemes,</HI> or carriers of burdens. This la&s;t mode of oppre&s;&s;ion was particulary ruinous to the Peruvians. From the number of Indians who peri&s;hed in Gonzalo Pizarro's expedi|tion into the countries to the ea&s;t of the Andes, one may form &s;ome idea of what they &s;uffered in &s;imilar &s;ervices, and how fa&s;t they were wa&s;ted by them.

<P>IT is very difficult to obtain an accurate account of the &s;tate of population in tho&s;e kingdoms of Europe where the police is mo&s;t perfect, and where &s;cience has made the greate&s;t progre&s;s. In Spani&s;h America, where knowledge is &s;till in its infancy, and few men have lei&s;ure to engage in re&s;earches merely &s;peculative, little attention has been paid to this curious inquiry. But in the year 1741, Philip V. enjoined the viceroys and governors of the &s;everal provinces in America, to make an actual &s;urvey of the people under their juri&s;diction, and to tran&s;mit a report concerning their number and occupations. In con&s;equence of this order, the Conde de Fuen-Clara, viceroy of New Spain, appointed D. Jo&s;. Antonio de Villa Segnor y Sanchez, to execute that com|mi&s;&s;ion in New Spain. From the reports of the magi&s;trates in the &s;everal di&s;tricts, as well as from his own ob&s;ervations, and
<PB N="487" REF="034476_0992_0FFDDE58C7A9CAC0">
long acquaintance with mo&s;t of the provinces, Villa Segnor pub|li&s;hed the re&s;ult of his inquiries in his <HI>Teatro Americano.</HI> His report, however, is imperfect. Of the nine dioce&s;es, into which the Mexican empire has been divided, he has publi&s;hed an account of five only, viz. the archbi&s;hopric of Mexico, the bi&s;hoprics of Pu|ebla de los Angeles, Mechoacan, Oaxaca, and Nova Galicia. The bi&s;hoprics of Yucatan, Verapaz, Chiapa, and Guatimala, are entirely omitted, though the two latter comprehend countries in which the Indian race is more numerous than in any part of New Spain. In his &s;urvey of the exten&s;ive dioce&s;e of Nova Galicia, the &s;ituation of the different Indian villages is de&s;cribed, but he &s;pecifies the number of people only in a &s;mall part of it. The Indians of that exten&s;ive province, in which the Spani&s;h domi|nion is imperfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed, are not regi&s;tered with the &s;ame accuracy as in other parts of New Spain.

We may rely with greater certainty on this computation of the number of Indians, as it is taken from the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ricule,</HI> or regi&s;ter, according to which the tribute paid by them is collected As four dia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;es of nine are totally omitted, and in that of Nova Galicia the numbers are imperfectly recorded, we may conclude, that the number of Indians in the Mexican empire exceeds two millions.</P>
<P>THE account of the number of Spaniards, &amp;c. &s;eems not to be equally complete. Of many places, Villa Segnor ob&s;erves in general terms, that &s;everal Spaniards, negroes, and people of a
<PB N="488" REF="034476_0993_0FFDDE5B66374B70">
mixed race, re&s;ide there, without &s;pecifying their number. If, therefore, we make allowance for the&s;e, and for all who re&s;ide in the four dioce&s;es omitted, the number of Spaniards, and of tho&s;e of a mixed race, may probably amount to a million and a half. In &s;ome places, Villa Segnor di&s;tingui&s;hes between Spaniards and the three inferior races of negroes, mulattoes, and me&s;tizos, and marks their number &s;eparately. But he generally blends them to|gether. But from the proportion ob&s;ervable in tho&s;e places, where the number ot each is marked, as well as from the account of the &s;tate of population in New Spain by other authors, it is manife&s;t that the number of negroes and per&s;ons of a mixed race far ex|ceeds that of Spaniards. Perhaps the latter ought not to be reckoned above 500,000 to a million of the former.</P>
<P>DEFECTIVE as this account may be, I have not been able to procure &s;uch intelligence concerning the number of people in Peru, as might enable me to form any con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ecture equally &s;atisfying with re&s;pect to the degree of its population. I have been in|formed, that in the year 1761, the protectors of the Indians in the viceroyalty of Peru computed that 612,780 paid tribute to the king. As all females, and per&s;ons under age, are exempted from this tax in Peru, the total number of Indians ought by that account, to be 2,449,120. MS. <HI>penes me.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL mention another mode, by which one may compute, or at lea&s;t form a gue&s;s, concerning the &s;tate of population in New Spain and Peru. According to an account which I have rea&s;on to con&s;ider as accurate, the number or copies of the bull of Cruzada, exported to Peru on each new publication, is 1,171,953; to New Spain 2,649,326. I am informed, that but few Indians purcha&s;e bulls, and that they are &s;old chiefly to the Spani&s;h inhabitants, and tho&s;e of mixed race, &s;o that the num|ber of Spaniards, and people of a mixed race, will amount by this mode of computation, to at lea&s;t three million.</P>
<P>THE number of inhabitants in many of the towns in Spani&s;h America, may give us &s;ome idea of the extent of population, and correct the inaccurate, but popular notion entertained in Great Britain, concerning the weak and de&s;olate &s;tate of their colo|nies. The city of Mexico contains at lea&s;t 150,000 people It is remarkable that Torquemada, who wrote his <HI>Monarquia Indiana</HI> about the year 1612, reckons the inhabitants of Mexico at that time to be only 7000 Spaniards, and 8000 Indians. Lib. iii. c. 26. Pueblade los Angeles contains above 60,000 Spaniards, and people of a mixed race. Villa Segnor, p. 247. Guadalaxara contains above 30,000, exclu&s;ive of Indians, Id. ii. 206. Lima con|tains 54,000. D. Co&s;me Bueno De&s;er, de Peru, 1764. Car|thagena contains 25,000. Poto&s;i contains 25,000. Bueno, 1767. Popayan contains above 20,000. Ulloa, i. 287. Towns

<P>SUCH are the detached accounts of the number of people in &s;everal towns, which I found &s;cattered in authors whom I thought worthy of credit. But I have obtained an enumeration of the inhabitants of the towns in the province of Quito, on the ac|curacy of which I can rely; and I communicate it to the Public, both to gratify curio&s;ity, and to rectify the mi&s;taken notion which I have mentioned. St. Franci&s;co de Quito contains between 50 and 60,000 people of all the different races. Be&s;ides the city, there are in the <HI>Corregimiento</HI> 29 <HI>curas</HI> or pari&s;hes e&s;tabli&s;hed in the prin|cipal villages, each of which has &s;maller hamlets depending upon it. The inhabitants of the&s;e are mo&s;tly Indians and Me&s;tizos. St. Juan de Pa&s;to has between 6 and 8000 inhabitants, be&s;ides 27 dependent villages. St. Miguel de Ibarra 7000 citizens, and ten villages. The di&s;trict of Havala between 18 and 20,000 people. The di&s;trict of Tacunna between 10 and 12,000. The di&s;trict of Ambato between 8 and 10,000, be&s;ides 16 de|pending villages. The city of Riobamba between 16 and 20,000 inhabitants, and 9 depending villages. The di&s;trict of Chimbo between 6 and 8000. The city of Guyaquil from 6 to 20,000 inhabitants, and 14 depending villages. The di&s;trict of Atua&s;i between 5 and 6000, and 4 depending villages. The city of Cuenza between 25 and 30,000 inhabitants, and 9 populous depending villages. The town of Laxa from 8 to 10,000 inhabi|tants and 14 depending villages. This degree or population, though &s;lender, if we con&s;ider the va&s;t extent of the country, is far beyond what is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed. I have omitted to mention, in its proper place, that Quito is the only province in Spani&s;h America that can be denominated a manufacturing coun|try; hats, cotton &s;tuffs, and coar&s;e woollen cloths, are made there in &s;uch quantities, as to be &s;ufficient not only for the con&s;ump|tion of the province, but to furni&s;h a con&s;iderable article for exportation into other parts of Spani&s;h America.

D. Hern. Carillo Altemirano relates a curious fact incompatible with this opinion. Wherever mines are wrought, &s;ays he, the number of Indians decrea&s;es; but in the province of Campeachy, where there are no mines, the num|ber of Indians has increa&s;ed more than a third &s;ince the conque&s;t of America, though neither the &s;oil nor climate be &s;o favourable as in Peru or Mexico.

<P>THIS de&s;cription of the manners of the Spani&s;h clergy, I &s;hould not have ventured to give upon the te&s;timony of prote&s;tant authors alone, as they may be &s;u&s;pected of pre|judice or exaggeration. Gage, in particular, who had a better opportunity than any prote&s;tant, to view the interior &s;tate of Spani&s;h America, de&s;cribes the corruption of the church which he had for&s;aken, with &s;o much of the acrimony of a new con|vert, that I &s;hould have di&s;tru&s;ted his evidence, though it com|municates &s;ome very curious and &s;triking facts. But Benzoni mentions the profligacy of eccle&s;ia&s;tics in America at a very early period after their &s;ettlement there. Hi&s;t. lib. ii. c 19, 20. M. Frezier, an intelligent ob&s;erver, and zealous for his own religion, paints the di&s;&s;olute manners of the Spani&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tics in Peru, particularly the regulars, in &s;tronger colours than I have employed. Voy. p. 51. 215, &amp;c. M. Gentil confirms this account, Voy. i. 34. Correal concurs with both, and adds many remarkable circum&s;tances. Voy. i. 61.155.161. I have good rea&s;on to believe, that the manners of the regular clergy, particularly in Peru, are &s;till extremely indecent. Aco&s;ta him&s;elf acknowledges that great corruption of manners had been the con&s;equence of permitting monks to for&s;ake the retire|ment and di&s;cipline of the cloi&s;ter, and to mingle again with the world by undertaking the charge of the Indian pari&s;hes. De procur. Ind. Salute, lib. iv. c. 13, &amp;c. He mentions parti|cularly tho&s;e vices, of which I have taken notice, and con&s;i|ders

the temptations to them as &s;o formidable, that he leans to the opinion of tho&s;e who hold that the regular clergy &s;hould not be em|ployed as pari&s;h prie&s;ts. Lib. v. c. 20. Even the advocates for the regulars admit, that many and great enormities abounded among the monks of different orders, when &s;et free from the re&s;traint of mona&s;tic di&s;cipline; and from the tone of their defence, one may conclude that the charge brought again&s;t them was not de&s;titute of truth. In the French colonies, the &s;tate of the regular clergy is nearly the &s;ame as in the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, and the &s;ame con&s;equences have followed. M. Biet, &s;uperi|or of the &s;ecular prie&s;ts in Cayenne, inquires with no le&s;s appearance of piety than of candour, into the cau&s;es of this corruption, and imputes it chiefly to the exemption of regulars from the juri&s;diction and cen&s;ures of their dioce&s;ans, to the temp|tations to which they are expo&s;ed; and to their engaging in com|merce. Voy. p. 320. It is remarkable that all the authors, who cen&s;ure the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Spani&s;h regulars with the greate&s;t &s;everity, concur in vindicating the conduct of the Je&s;uits. For|med under a di&s;cipline more perfect than that of the other mona&s;tic orders, or animated by that concern for the honour of the &s;ociety, which takes &s;uch full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every member of the order, the Je&s;uits, both in Mexico and Peru, it is allowed, maintained a mo&s;t irreproachable decency of manners.

But by a law i&s;&s;ued September 28th, 1588, Philip II. required the prelates of America to ordain &s;uch me&s;tizos born in lawful wedlock, as they &s;hould find to be properly qualified, and to permit them to take the vows in any mona&s;tery where they had gone through a regular noviciate. Recopil. lib. i. tit. vii. l. 7. Some regard &s;eem to have been paid to this law in New Spain; but none in Peru. Upon a repre&s;entation of this to Char.

Such however, was the aver&s;ion of the Spaniards in America to the Indians, and their race, that this &s;eems to have produced little ef|fect; for, in the year 1725, Philip V. was obliged to renew the injunction in a more peremptory tone.

I owe it therefore as a duty to the public, as well as to my&s;elf, to con|&s;ider each of the&s;e points with care, and to explain the rea&s;ons which induced me to adopt the opinion which I have publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>I KNEW that in the Chri&s;tian church there is no di&s;tinction of per&s;ons, but that men of every nation who embrace the religion of Je&s;us, are equally entitled to every Chri&s;tian privilege which they are qualified to receive. I knew, likewi&s;e, that an opinion pre|vailed, not only among mo&s;t of the Spani&s;h lairy &s;ettled in Ame|rica, but among "many eccle&s;ia&s;tics, (I u&s;e the words of Her|rera, dec. ii. lib. ii. c. 15.) that the Indians were not perfect or rational men, and were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch capacity as qualified them to partake of the &s;acrament of the altar, or of any other be|nefit of our religion." It was again&s;t this opinion that Las Ca&s;as contended with the laudable zeal which I have de&s;cribed in Books III. and VI. But as the Bi&s;hop of Darien, Doctor Sepulvida, and other re&s;pectable eccle&s;ia&s;tics, vigorou&s;ly &s;upported the common opinion concerning the incapacity of the Indians, it became ne|ce&s;&s;ary, In order to determine the point, that the authority of the Holy See &s;hould be interpo&s;ed; and accordingly Paul III. i&s;&s;ued a ball A. D. 1537, in which, after condemning the opinion of tho&s;e who held that the Indians, as being on a level with brute bea&s;ts, &s;hould be reduced to &s;ervitude, he declares, that they were really men, and as &s;uch were capable of embracing the Chri&s;tian religion, and participating of all its ble&s;&s;ings My account of this b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, notwith&s;tanding the cavils of M.

<P>IN an&s;wer to this objection, which e&s;tabli&s;hes in the mo&s;t unequivocal manner, what was the general practice at that period, Torquemada ob&s;erves, that although by their natural di&s;po&s;ition, the Indians are well fitted for a &s;ubordinate &s;ituation, they are de&s;titute of all the qualities requi&s;ite in any &s;tation of dignity and authority; and that they are in general &s;o addicted to drunkenne&s;s, that, upon the &s;lighte&s;t temptation, one cannot promi&s;e on their behaving with the decency &s;uitable to the clerical character. The propriety of excluding them from it, on the&s;e accounts, was, he ob&s;erved, &s;o well ju&s;tified by experience, that when a foreigner of great eru|dition, who came from Spain, condemned the practice of the Mexican church, he was convinced of his mi&s;take in a public di&s;|putation with the learned and mo&s;t religious Father D. Juan de Gaona, and his retractation is &s;till extant. Torquemada, indeed, acknowledges, as M. Clavigero ob&s;erves, with a degree of exultation, that, in his time, &s;ome Indians had been admitted into mona&s;teries; but, with the art of a di&s;putant, he forgets to mention that Torquemada &s;pecifies only two examples of this, and takes notice that in both in&s;tances tho&s;e Indians had been admit|ted by mi&s;take. Relying upon the authority of Torquemada, with regard to New Spain, and of Ulloa with regard to Peru, and con&s;idering the humiliating depre&s;&s;ion of the Indians in all the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements, I concluded that they were not admitted into the eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, which is held in the highe&s;t veneration all over the New World.</P>
<P>BUT when M. Clavigero, upon his own knowledge, a&s;&s;erted facts
<PB N="499" REF="034476_1004_0FFDDE7939D688A8">
&s;o repugnant to the conclu&s;ion I had formed, I began to di&s;tru&s;t it, and to wi&s;h for further information. In order to obtain this, I applied to a Spani&s;h nobleman, high in office, and eminent for his abilities, who, on different occa&s;ions, has permitted me to have the honour and benefit of corre&s;ponding with him. I have been favoured with the following an&s;wer: "What you have written concerning the admi&s;&s;ion of Indians into holy orders, or into mo|na&s;teries, in Book VIII. e&s;pecially as it is explained and limited in Note LXXXVIII. of the quarto edition, is in general accurate, and conformable to the authorities which you quote. And al|though the congregation of the council re&s;olved and declared, Feb. 13, A. D. 1682, that the circum&s;tance or being an Indian, a mulatto, or me&s;tizo, did not di&s;qualify any per&s;on from being admitted into holy orders, if he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of what is required by the canons to entitle him to that privilege; this only proves &s;uch ordinations to be legal and valid, (of which Solorzano, and the Spani&s;h lawyers and hi&s;torians quoted by him, Pol. Ind. lib. ii. c. 29, were per&s;uaded) but it neither proves the propriety of admitting Indians into holy orders, nor what was then the com|mon practice with re&s;pect to this; but, on the contrary, it &s;hews that there was &s;ome doubt concerning the ordaining of Indians, and &s;ome repugnance to it.</P>
<P>"SINCE that time, there have been &s;ome examples of admit|ting Indians into holy orders. We have now at Madrid an aged prie&s;t, a native of Tla&s;cala, His name is D. Juan Cerilo de C&s;tilla Aquihual catehutle, de&s;cended of a Cazique converted to Chri&s;tianity &s;oon after the conque&s;t. He &s;tudied the eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal &s;ciences in a &s;eminary of Puebla de los Angeles. He was a candidate, neverthele&s;s for ten years, and it required much in|tere&s;t before Bi&s;hop Abren would con&s;ent to ordain him. This eccle&s;ia&s;tic is a man of unexceptionable character, mode&s;t, &s;elf-de|nied, and with a competent knowledge of what relates to his clerical functions. He came to Madrid above thirty-four years ago, with the &s;ole view of &s;oliciting admi&s;&s;ion for the Indians into the colleges and &s;eminaries in New Spain, that if, after being well in&s;tructed and tried, they &s;hould find an inclination to enter into the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, they might embrace it, and perform its functions with the greate&s;t benefit to their countrymen, whom they could addre&s;s in their native tongue. He has obtained va|rious regulations favourable to his &s;cheme, particularly that the fir&s;t college which became vacant in con&s;equence of the exclu&s;ion of the Je&s;uits, &s;hould be &s;et apart for this purpo&s;e. But neither the&s;e regulations, nor any &s;imilar ones in&s;erted in the laws of the Indies, has produced any effect, on account of objections and re|pre&s;entations from the greater part of per&s;ons of chief con&s;idera|tion employed in New Spain. Whether their oppo&s;ition be well

founded or not, is a problem difficult to re&s;olve, and towards the &s;olution of which, &s;everal di&s;tinctions and modifications are re|qui&s;ite.</P>
<P>"ACCORDING to the accounts of this eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and the in|formation of other per&s;ons who have re&s;ided in the Spani&s;h domi|nions in America, you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that in the kingdom of Tierra Firme no &s;uch thing is known as either an Indian &s;ecular prie&s;t or monk; and that in New Spain there are very few eccle&s;i|a&s;tics of Indian race. In Peru perhaps, the number may be greater, as in that country there are more Indians who po&s;&s;e&s;s the means of acquiring &s;uch a learned education as is nece&s;&s;ary for per&s;ons who a&s;pire to the clerical character."</P>

<P>WHEN the mines of Poto&s;i were di&s;covered in the year 1545, the veins were &s;o near the &s;urface, that the ore was ea&s;ily extracted, and &s;o rich that it was refined with little trou|ble and at a &s;mall expence, merely by the action of fire.

<P>MANY remarkable proofs occur of the advanced &s;tate of indu&s;try in Spain, at the beginning of the &s;ixteenth cen|tury. The number of cities in Spain was con&s;iderable, and they were peopled far beyond the proportion that was common in other parts of Europe. The cau&s;es of this I have explained, Hi&s;t. of Cha. V. i. 158. Wherever cities are populous, that &s;pecies of indu&s;try which is peculiar to them increa&s;es, artificers and manu|facturers abound. The effect of the American trade in giving activity to the&s;e is manife&s;t, from a &s;ingular fact. In the year 1545, while Spain continued to depend on its own indu&s;try, for the &s;upply of its colonies, &s;o much work was be&s;poke from the manufacturers, that it was &s;uppo&s;ed they could hardly fini&s;h it in le&s;s than &s;ix years. Campom. i. 406. Such a demand mu&s;t have put much indu&s;try in motion, and have excited extraordinary ef|forts. Accordingly, we are informed, that in the beginning of Philip II.'s reign, the city of Seville alone, where the trade with America centered, gave employment to no fewer than 16,000 looms in &s;ilk or woolen work, and that above 130,000 per&s;ons had occupation in carrying on the&s;e manufactures. Campom. ii. 472. But &s;o rapid and pernicious was the operation of the cau&s;es which I &s;hall enumerate, that before Philip III. ended his reign, the looms in Seville were reduced to 400.

<P><PB N="502" REF="034476_1007_0FFDDE7C1B515CC8">SINCE the publication of the fir&s;t edition, I have the &s;atisfac|tion to find my ideas concerning the early commercial intercour&s;e between Spain and her colonies confirmed and illu&s;trated by D. Bernardo Ward, of the Junta de Comercio at Madrid, in his <HI>Proyecto Economico,</HI> Part. ii. c. i. "Under the reigns of Char|les V. and Philip II." &s;ays he, "the manufactures of Spain and of the Low Countries &s;ubject to her dominion, were in a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate. Tho&s;e of France and England were in their infancy. The republic of the U. Provinces did not then exi&s;t. No European power but Spain, had colonies of any value in the New World. Spain could &s;upply her &s;ettlements there with the productions of her own &s;oil, the fabrics wrought by the hands of her own artizans, and all &s;he received in return for the&s;e belonged to her&s;elf alone. Then the exclu&s;ion of foreign manu|factures was proper, becau&s;e it might be rendered effectual. Then Spain might lay heavy duties upon goods exported to America, or imported from it, and might impo&s;e what re&s;traint &s;he deemed pro|per upon a commerce entirely in her own hands. But when time and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive revolutions had occa&s;ioned an alteration in all tho&s;e circum&s;tances, when the manufactures of Spain began to decline, and the demands of America were &s;upplied by foreign fabrics, the original maxims and regulations of Spain &s;hould have been ac|commodated to the change in her &s;ituation.

<P>THE account of the mode in which the factors of the South Sea company conducted the trade in the fair of Porto-bello, which was opened to them by the A&s;&s;iento, I have taken from Don Dion. Alcedo y Herrera, pre&s;ident of the court of Au|dience in Quito, and governor of that province. Don Diony&s;io was a per&s;on of &s;uch re&s;pectable character for probity and di&s;|cernment, that his te&s;timony, in any point would be of much weight; but greater credit is due to it in this ca&s;e, as he was an eye-witne&s;s of the tran&s;actions which he relates, and was often employed in detecting and authenticating the frauds which he de&s;|cribes. It is probable, however, that his repre&s;entation, being com|po&s;ed at the commencement or the war which broke out between Great Britain and Spain, in the year 1739, may, in &s;ome in&s;tances, di&s;cover a portion of the acrimonious &s;pirit, natural at that junc|ture. His detail of facts is curious; and even Engli&s;h authors confirm it in &s;ome degree, by admitting both that various frauds were practi&s;ed in the tran&s;actions of the annual &s;hip, and that the contraband trade from Jamaica, and other Briti&s;h colonies, was be|come enormou&s;ly great. But for the credit of the Engli&s;h na|tion it may be ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e fraudulent operations are not to be con&s;idered as deeds of the company, but as the di&s;honour|able arts of their factors and agents. The company it&s;elf &s;u&s;|tained a con&s;iderable lo&s;s by the A&s;&s;iento trade. Many of its &s;er|vants acquired immen&s;e fortunes. Ander&s;on Chronol. deduct, ii. 388.</P>

<P>SEVERAL facts with re&s;pect to the in&s;titution, the progre&s;s, and the effects, of this company, are curious, and but little known to Engli&s;h readers. Though the province of Venezuela,

or Caraccas, extends four hundred miles along the coa&s;t, and is one of the mo&s;t fertile in America; it was &s;o much neglected by the Spaniards, that during the twenty years prior to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the company, only five &s;hips &s;ailed from Spain to that pro|vince; and during 16 years, from 1706 to 1722, not a &s;ingle &s;hip arrived from the Caraccas in Spain. Noticias de Real Com|pania de Caraccas, p. 28. During this period Spain mu&s;t have been &s;upplied almo&s;t entirely with the large quantity of cacao, which it con&s;umes, by foreigners. Before the erection of the company, neither tobacco nor hides were imported from Carac|cas into Spain. Id. p. 117. Since the commercial operations of the company began in the year 1731, the importation of cacao into Spain has increa&s;ed amazingly. During thirty years &s;ub&s;e|quent to 1701, the number of <HI>Fanegas</HI> of cacao (each a hundred and ten pounds) imported from Caraccas, was 643,215. Dur|ing eighteen years &s;ub&s;equent to 1731, the number of <HI>Fanegas</HI> imported was 869,247; and if we &s;uppo&s;e the importation to be continued in the &s;ame proportion during the remainder of thirty years, it will amount to 1,448,746 <HI>Fanegas,</HI> which is an increa&s;e of 805,531 <HI>Fanegas.</HI> Id. p. 148. During eight years &s;ub&s;e|quent to 1756, there has been imported into Spain by the com|pany, 88,482 <HI>arrolas</HI> (each twenty-five pounds) of tobacco; and hides to the number of 177,354. Id. 161. Since the publica|tion of the Noticias de Campania, in 1765, its trade &s;eems to be on the increa&s;e. During five years &s;ub&s;equent to 1769, it has imported 179,156 <HI>Fanegas</HI> of cacao into Spain, 36,208 arrolas of tobacco, 75,496 hides, and 221,432 pe&s;os in &s;pecie. Cam|pomanes, ii. 162. The la&s;t article is a proof of the growing wealth of the colony. It receives ca&s;h from Mexico in return for the cacao, with which it &s;upplies that province, and this it remits to Spain, or lays out in purcha&s;ing European goods. But, be&s;ides this, the mo&s;t explicit evidence is produced, that the quantity of cacao rai&s;ed in the province is double to what it yielded in 1731; the number of its live &s;tock is more than treble, and its inhabitants much augmented. The revenue of the bi&s;hop, which ari&s;es wholly from tithes, has increa&s;ed from eight to twenty thou&s;and pe&s;os. Notic. p. 69. In con&s;equence of the augmenta|tion of the quantity of cacao imported into Spain, its price has decrea&s;ed from eighty pe&s;os for the <HI>Fanega</HI> to forty. Id. 61.

<P>AS Villa Segnor, to whom we are indebted for this informa|tion contained in his Theatro Americano, publi&s;hed in Mexico, A. D. 1746, was accomptant-general in one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable departments of the royal revenue, and by that means had acce&s;s to proper information, his te&s;ti|mony with re&s;pect to this point merits great credit. No &s;uch accurate detail of the Spani&s;h revenues in any part of America has hitherto been publi&s;hed in the Engli&s;h language, and the par|ticulars of it may appear curious and intere&s;ting to &s;ome of my readers.</P>

Theat. Mex. vol. i. p. 38, &amp;c. According to Villa Segnor, the total produce of the Mexican mines amounts at a medium to eight millions of pe&s;os in &s;ilver annually, and to 5,912 marks of gold. Ib. p. 44. Several branches of the revenue have been explained in the cour&s;e of the hi&s;tory; &s;ome which there was no occa&s;ion of mentioning, require a particular illu&s;tration. The right to the <HI>rithes</HI> in the New World, is ve&s;ted in the crown of Spain, by a bull of Alexander VI. Charles V. appointed them to be applied in the following manner: One fourth is allotted to the bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e, another fourth to the dean and chapter, and other offi|cers of the cathedral. The remaining half is divided into nine equal parts. Two of the&s;e, under the denomination of <HI>los dos Novenos reales,</HI> are paid to the crown, and con&s;titute a branch of the royal revenue. The other &s;even parts are applied to the maintenance of the parochial clergy, the building and &s;upport of churches, and other pious u&s;es. Recopil. lib. i. tit. xvi.

<P>THE <HI>Alcavala</HI> is a duty levied by an exci&s;e on the &s;ale of goods. In Spain it amounts to ten per cent. In America, to four per cent. Solorzano Polit. Indiana, lib vi. c. 8. Aven|dano, vol. i. 186.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Averia,</HI> or tax paid on account of convoys to guard the &s;hips &s;ailing to and from America, was fir&s;t impo&s;ed when Sir Francis Drake filled the New World with terror by his expedi|tion to the South Sea.

<P>IN computing the expence of government in New Spain, I may take that of Peru as a &s;tandard. There the annual e&s;tabli&s;h|ment for defraying the charge of admini&s;tration, exceeds one half of the revenue collected, and there is no rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing it to be le&s;s in New Spain.</P>
<P>I HAVE obtained a calculation of the total amount of the public revenue of Spain from America and the Philippines, which, as the reader will perceive from the two la&s;t articles, is more re|cent than any of the former.</P>
