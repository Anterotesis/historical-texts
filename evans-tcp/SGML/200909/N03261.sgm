<P>_CHri&s;tian Friends and dear Bre|thren, my Errand to you this Day from the great God the Father of Je&s;us, re&s;embles that of <HI>Eliezer</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus, A|brabam's</HI> Servant, who was &s;ent to wooe a Wife for his Ma&s;ters Son: Brethren I come a wooing in the Name and Behalf of Chri&s;t my great Ma&s;ter the Kings Son.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003965_0004_10031985EDE40818">
My Bu&s;ine&s;s with you to day is to per|&s;wade you to be &s;peedily and &s;incerely e&s;pou|&s;ed to the Lamb of God, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> That I mayn't mi&s;s my Errand, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of de&s;ir'd Succe&s;s. What <HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant propo&s;ed by Way of cau|tious Suppo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>peradventure the Woman would not be willing to follow him,</HI> ver&s;. 5. I have Rea&s;on to u&s;e as Matter of doleful Complaint and bitter Lamentation over many of you, whom former Attempts have fail'd to per&s;wade to this Marriage, and al&s;o as an Excitement to awful fear and pa&s;&s;io|nate concerns now.</P>
<P><HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant was engag'd or bound by Oath to be <HI>faithful in the Bu&s;ine&s;s he was &s;ent about,</HI> vers. 9. And you know Bre|thren, I am under a &s;olemn Ordination Oath, to be faithful to God and you; this I hope will excu&s;e for my endeavour to deal with you in good earne&s;t.</P>
<P>Again in the Context you may ob&s;erve, that if the Servant u&s;ed faithful Endeavours, <HI>and the Woman would not be per&s;waded then he was to be clear from his Oath:</HI> So, Friends, if after all the endeavours I can u&s;e to per|&s;wade and reclaim you, ye &s;til continue ob|&s;tinate, I &s;hall be free from the Oath I have taken, and from your Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant had good Succe&s;s, the God of his Ma&s;ter pro&s;per'd his Way; <HI>Re|beca,</HI>

<P><Q><HI>I&s;aac</HI> being a Type of Chri&s;t, &s;ome In|terpreters make this fetching of a Wife for him, to &s;ignify the E&s;pou&s;ing of the Church to Chri&s;t, by the Agency of his Servants, the Mini&s;ters, hence the Church is called the Bride, the Lambs Wife, Chri&s;t the Brid|groom, <HI>Job.</HI> 3.29. Who&s;e great Bu&s;ine&s;s, it is to per&s;wade poor Souls to con&s;ent to embrace him as their Lord and Hu&s;band, in an everla&s;ting Marriage Covenant, its hardly credible that this Story would have been Re&s;olved in &s;o minute Circum|&s;tances, had not a nobler and more my&s;te|rious Marriage been de&s;ign'd to be repre&s;en|ted by it.</Q></P>
<P>Under this view the Text pre&s;ents to our Con&s;iderations, the 2. Propo&s;itions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<ITEM>1. <HI>That the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are Spoke&s;|men for the Marriage of their Ma&s;ters Son,</HI> &mdash;and.</ITEM>

</LIST>
<P>I return to con&s;ider the fir&s;t <HI>Propo&s;.</HI> In Explaining of which, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew the Analogy between a Spoke&s;man in a temporal Marriage, and a Mini&s;ters Proper|ty's
<PB N="7" REF="003965_0006_1003198F14B42BC0">and practice in negotiating a &s;piritual Marriage, between Chri&s;t and Souls, and &s;o improve it; the Analogy, I think, con&s;i&s;ts principally in the following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Spoke&s;man &s;hould be &s;killful, able with apt Expre&s;&s;ions to &s;et forth the Lovers Excellencies; &s;o a Mini&s;ter &s;hould be no No|vice, but like <HI>Apollos, Mighty in the Scrip|tures,</HI> and thereby able in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to &s;peak forth his Redeemers Prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Acquainted with his Per&s;on; for how can they commend him whom they do not know: So &s;hould Mini&s;ters know Chri&s;t and the Truth as it is in him; otherwi&s;e they &s;peake but faintly for him. <HI>The Secrets of the Lord are with tho&s;e that fear him, and he will remember his holy Covenant.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. True to his intere&s;t, a Spoke&s;man &s;hould be a familiar Friend of the Lover, and faith|ful to his Cau&s;e; <HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant was &s;uch whom he appointed to get a Wife for his Son: And &s;o mu&s;t the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t be, <HI>Joh.</HI> 15.14.15. 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.12. <HI>And I thank Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord, for that he counted me faithful putting me into the Mini|&s;try.</HI> Jer. 23.31. <HI>I am again&s;t the&s;e Prophets, that &s;mooth their Tongues,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Poli Synop&s;in in Locum.</NOTE> So the Engli&s;h Annotations and other learned Interpreters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Henery in Locum.</NOTE> render the Word <HI>USE</HI> as our Ver&s;ion hath it.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="8" REF="003965_0007_10031990DC57A550">
4. A Spoke&s;man u&s;eth a Variety of Ar|guments, to alure the Love of the Per&s;on he treats with to his Ma&s;ter, drawn from his per|&s;onal Merit and great Affluence: So the faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t Labour to win the Affections of undone Sinners to him, by &s;etting forth his Greatne&s;s, Goodne&s;s, Suita|blene&s;s, Ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, Tran&s;cendent Excellency, and inexhau&s;tible All &s;uficiency.</P>
<P N="5">5. A faithful Spoke&s;man is griev'd to &s;ee his great Ma&s;ter &s;lighted, and his mo&s;t preg|nant Arguments, and his per&s;wa&s;ive Adre&s;|&s;es fail of de&s;ired Succe&s;s; he can't be con|tented with telling of his Narrative without &s;eeing it take Effect, this our Text confirms, &mdash; So a godly Mini&s;ter is not &s;atisfy'd with the Performance of Preaching as a Ta&s;k, and the Ob&s;ervance of Sinners attent upon it, unle&s;s he can perceive &s;ome Signs of the Ef|fects of his Preaching, &s;ome Signs of Sinners con&s;enting to embrace the Redeemer.</P>
<P N="6">6. A faithful Spoke&s;man will not only Addre&s;s the Woman to whom he is &s;ent, but al&s;o make Application to Heaven, for Direc|tion and Succe&s;s, this did <HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant, <HI>vers.</HI> 12. <HI>And he &s;aid, O Lord God of my Ma&s;ter</HI> Abraham, <HI>I pray thee &s;end me good Speed this Day, and &s;hew kindne&s;s unto my Ma&s;ter</HI> Abraham. So do the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t bow their Knees to the mo&s;t high God, of whom the whole Family in Heaven and
<PB N="9" REF="003965_0008_10031999671683F8">Earth is Named, and vehemently entreat for Guidence and Succe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">. Permit me, kind Hearers, to &s;upplicate the &s;upreme Maje&s;ty, in the Words of <HI>Abrahams</HI> Servant, with &s;ome &s;mall Variation. O Lord God of my Ma&s;ter Je&s;us, &s;end me good Speed this Day, and &s;hew Kindne&s;s unto my Ma&s;ter; in cau&s;ing &s;ome poor Sinners con&s;ent to a Marriage with him.</P>
<P N="7">7. A Faithful Servant, if he &s;ucceeds in his Negotiation, returns the due Honours of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es to God, &s;o did <HI>Eliezer,</HI> vers. 27. <HI>And He &s;aid, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of my Ma&s;ter</HI> Abraham, <HI>who hath not left de&s;titute my Ma&s;ter of his Mercy and of his Truth:</HI> So the Heart of a faithfull Mini&s;ter, when he &s;ees poor Sinners return to their offended Sovereign, and Ki&s;s the Son with the deepe&s;t Homage, Affection and Obedience, beats in his Bo&s;om with joyfull Tran&s;ports and grate|full Emotions of undi&s;&s;embled prai&s;e to God, God and the Lamb that fits upon the Throne.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Spoke&s;man of a Prince or great Man, offers Bracelets or &s;ome rich Love to|kens to the Per&s;on his Ma&s;ter makes his Court to, in Order to demon&s;trate his Ma&s;ters Greatne&s;s and Love, and to gain the Womans con&s;ent, <HI>vers. 22. So the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t offer in their Ma&s;ters Name, the Sealings of the Spirit, the Jewels of the Covenant, to &s;uch
<PB N="10" REF="003965_0009_1003081E9100F760">who will con&s;ent to the Marriage of the King's Son.</HI> But</P>
<P N="9">9. When he can't prevail, he returns to his Ma&s;ter, and gives him an Account of his Treatment; this a pious Writer takes to be the Scope and Drift of our Text. So the poor Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, when you will not hear their wooings, but &s;light their Lord and all the Offeres of his Love, are obliged with &s;or|rowful Hearts and weeping Eyes to complain to their Ma&s;ter, now, of your doleful Stu|pidity and cruel Ob&s;tinacy, and mu&s;t in the great Day, unle&s;s ye repent, Witne&s;s again&s;t you, the Offers of Life they have made to you, the Arguments they have us'd with you to Embrace them, and your ob&s;tinacy again&s;t both. &mdash; But I proceed to the Improve|ment in a 4 fold U&s;e of Information, Exa|mination, Conviction, and Exhortation. &mdash; &mdash; and,</P>

Have not ye readily in the mean Time obeyed Satan and your Lu&s;ts? Followed their Beck, and pur&s;ued their deadly Dictates with ha&s;te and Alacrity? And will ye &s;hut your Ears with the deaf Adder, again&s;t the Charms of your Creator and Redeemer, cour|ting you in the mo&s;t conde&s;cending &s;trains, in Order to confer upon you Liberty and Life?
