<P>IT having been my lot to fall in among the <HI>Quakers</HI> whom I always ob&s;erved in their Preachings to Extoll them&s;elves, telling what God had done for them, and that he had ble&s;&s;ed them above all other People and Profe&s;&s;ions, whom they called <HI>The People of the world,</HI> but them&s;elves. <HI>The People of God, The peculiar People of the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. which made me think my &s;elf happy in being among them, and did not much enquire after the Principles and Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity profe&s;&s;ed and Belie|ved by the <HI>Church of England</HI> and other Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ions, thinking my &s;elf well enough; but about the year <HI>1691.</HI> when <HI>G. Keith</HI> began to Preach Zealou&s;ly the Faith of <HI>Chri&s;t Cruci|fied</HI> among the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and finding them to oppo&s;e him therein, I &s;et my &s;elf to Examine the <HI>Quakers</HI> Books, and compare them with the holy Scriptures, and finding them Incon&s;i&s;tent therewith, and many of them Contradictory one to the other, I thought it my Duty to let others know the &s;ame, that were ignorant, wherefore I collected many of their &V;n&s;ound and Erroneous Doctrines and Principles contained in their printed Books and pub|li&s;hed them in a Book, Entituled, <HI>News of a Trumpet Sounded in the Wilderne&s;s,</HI> which had good acceptance in <HI>America,</HI> and al&s;o in <HI>England,</HI> where it was Reprinted, and in <HI>Holland</HI> it was Tran&s;lated and printed in <HI>Dutch.</HI> About a year and half after it was publi&s;hed there comes out a pretended an&s;wer, Enti|tuled, <HI>Satans Harbinger,</HI> &s;igned by one <HI>Caleb Pu&s;ey,</HI> a Miller in <HI>Penn&s;ilvania.</HI> No &s;ooner had I began to read his an&s;wer but I found &s;everal Lyes, Perver&s;ions, &amp;c. therein, and particularly I found that he charged me Several times with belying and abu&s;ing <HI>W.

<HI>Chri&s;t the finite Impotent Creature,</HI> Whereupon I writ a Challenge to this <HI>C.

Pu&s;ey</HI> &s;hould print and publi&s;h &s;uch a paper of Condemnation, as I &s;hould order him, for abu&s;ing me. Now this paper lay a Con|&s;iderable time in the Printers hands before it was printed, and when it came to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> I was removed from my Planta|tion at <HI>Burlington</HI> to <HI>Egg-harbour,</HI> which is near Eighty Miles, and <HI>C. P.</HI> get the &s;aid paper before me, and took he advantage to pul a Trick upon me, by &s;ending me a Letter dated the 6 of October, to meet him within ten days after the date of that Letter, and &s;even of the &s;aid ten days being expired before I received his Letter, it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for me to prepare my &s;elf and come near 80 miles and end the bu&s;ine&s;s, and all in three days time; or el&s;e he had &s;ome ba&s;e De&s;ign upon me. Therefore in my <HI>Al|manack</HI> for the Year <HI>1701.</HI> I Renewed my Challenge to him, and appointed the <HI>12th</HI> day of <HI>May</HI> to meet him at <HI>Burlington</HI> to refer the matter to &s;ome judicious meen (not <HI>Quakers</HI>) <HI>Whether or no</HI> W.

P.</HI> but in&s;tead of coming him&s;elf he &s;ends a Printed Pamphlet, wherein he pretends to quote <HI>W. P's</HI> words, but deceitfully leaves out that Paragraph where the words <HI>Son of God, Chri&s;t as man, &amp;c.</HI> was, and tells that W. P. means it of as &s;inners, and not of Chri&s;t. And therefore I have quoted <HI>W. P's</HI> words as they &s;tand in his book, called, Sandy Foundation, <HI>p. 20 21.</HI> that people may judge whether I have wronged <HI>W. P.</HI> or not.

<HEAD><HI>W. P.</HI>'s Sandy Foundation, p. 16. begins thus; <HI>The vulgar Doctrine of Satisfaction being dependent on the &s;econd Per&s;on of the imagin'd Trinity, Refuted, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Doctrine:</HEAD>
<P><Q>THat Man having tran&s;gre&s;s'd the Righteous Law of God and &s;o expos'd to the penalty of eternal Wrath, it's altogether impo&s;&s;ible for God to remit or forgive without a Plenary Satisfaction; and that there was no other way by which God could obtain Satisfaction, or &s;ave men, than by inflicting the penalty of infinite wrath and vengeance on Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Second Per&s;on of the Trinity, who for &s;ins pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come, hath wholly born and paid it, <HI>(whether for all or but &s;ome)</HI> to the offended infinite ju&s;tice of his Father.</Q></P>
<P>[<HI>Note, I</HI> do not quote <HI>W. P</HI>'s Scripture Proofs that he brings to Refute this Doctrine, the Point in Controver&s;ie between <HI>C. Pu&s;ey</HI> and <HI>D. Leeds</HI> not being whether the Doctrine be true or fal&s;e, but whether <HI>W. P.</HI> calls Chri&s;t <HI>Finite, Impotent, &amp;c.</HI> which <HI>I</HI> bring the following Quotations to Determine.]</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Pag. 20, 21. <HI>The Ab&s;urdities that unavoidably follow the Compari&s;on of this Doctrine, with the &s;ence of Scripture.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THat God is gracious to forgive, and yet impo&s;&s;ible for him, unle&s;s the Debt be fully &s;atisfied.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Finite and Impotent Creature,</HI> is more capable of extending Mercy and Forgivene&s;s, than the Infinite and Omnipotent Creator.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That God &s;o loved the World, he gave his only Son to &s;ave it;</HI> and yet that God &s;tood off in high di&s;plea&s;ure, and Chri&s;t gave
<PB N="6" REF="001113_0005_0FB04275F2DD2DE0">him&s;elf to God as a compleat &s;atisfaction to his offended Ju&s;tice; with many more &s;uch like gro&s;s Con&s;equences that might be drawn.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Refuted from right Rea&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>But if we &s;hould grant a Scripture &s;ilence as to the nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's &s;atisfying his Fathers Ju&s;tice, yet &s;o manife&s;t would be the Contradictions, and foul the Repugnances to right Rea&s;on, that who had not vail'd his under&s;tanding with the dark &s;ugge&s;tions of unwarrantable Tradition, or contracted his Judgment to the implicit apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome over-valued acquaintance, might with great facility di&s;criminate to a full re&s;olve in this point; for admitting God to be a Creditor, or he to whom the Debt &s;hould be paid, and Chri&s;t he that &s;atisfies or payes it on the behalf of man, the Debtor, this que&s;tion will ari&s;e, Whether he paid that Debt, as God, Man, or both (to u&s;e their own terms.)</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Not as God.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. In that it divides the Unity of the God-head by two di&s;tinct Acts, of being Offended, and not Offended; of condemning Ju&s;tice, and redeeming Mercy of requiring a &s;atisfaction, and then paying of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e if Chri&s;t payes the Debt as God, then the Father and the Spirit being God, they al&s;o pay the Debt.</P>
<P N="3">3. Since God is to be &s;atisfied, and that Chri&s;t is God, he con&s;equently is to be &s;atisfied; and who &s;hall &s;atisfie his infinite Ju&s;tice?</P>
<P N="4">4. But if Chri&s;t has &s;atisfied God the Father, Chri&s;t being al&s;o God, 'twill follow then that he has &s;atisfied him&s;elf, (which can't be.)</P>
<P N="5">5. But &s;ince God the Father was once to be &s;atisfied, and that it's impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould do it him&s;elf, nor yet the Son or Spirit, becau&s;e the &s;ame God; it naturally follows that
<PB N="7" REF="001113_0006_0FB04276C215B100">the Debt remains unpaid, and the&s;e Satisfactioni&s;ts thus far are &s;till at a lo&s;s.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Not as Man.</HEAD>
<P N="6">6. The Ju&s;tice offended, being Infinite his Satisfaction ought to bear a proportion therewith, which Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as Man, could never pay, he being FINITE, and from a Finite cau&s;e could not proceed an infinite effect; for &s;o man may be &s;aid to bring forth God, &s;ince nothing below the Divinity it &s;elf can rightly be &s;tiled Infinite.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Not as God and Man.</HEAD>
<P N="7">7. For where two mediums, or middle Propo&s;itions, are &s;ingly incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of the end for which they were at fir&s;t propounded, their conjunction rather does augment than le&s;&s;en the difficulty of its accompli&s;hment; and this I am per&s;waded mu&s;t be obvious to every unbya&s;'d under&s;tanding. Thus far W. P.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>Now here you &s;ee in his <HI>6th</HI> Paragraph he (in expre&s;s words) &s;ays, <HI>Chri&s;t, as Man, was FINITE;</HI> and if <HI>Finite,</HI> con&s;equently Weak and Impotent in making &s;atisfaction for mens &s;in, which is the only thing W. P. here is Refuting. But <HI>Caleb Pu&s;ey</HI> in his Pamphlet did not quote this, This did not &s;uit his turn, No, This would have di&s;covered his Knavery under his Cloak, and laid him too open; he thought it his &s;afe&s;t way to leave the explaining part out, and quote only that pa&s;&s;age where <HI>Finite Impotent Creature</HI> is named, and not the words, <HI>Son of God,</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;t as Man,</HI> that he might make weak People believe, by his puzeling Non|&s;en&s;e, that W. P. meant &s;ome other things: He al&s;o tells a deceitfull &s;tory of three di&s;tinct Heads, p. 19. as if <HI>W. P.</HI> wanted this Millers help to draw his matter into Heads and Tails. A thing never done nor intended by W. P. for all
<PB N="8" REF="001113_0007_0FB04277DB751938">
who have Eyes may &s;ee, 'tis only three Ab&s;urdities that <HI>W. P.</HI> draws up again&s;t the Doctrine of <HI>Chri&s;ts</HI> &s;atisfying the Of|fended Ju&s;tice of God.</P>
<P>Now I doubt not but by this time all under&s;tanding men, except Quakers, plainly &s;ee that <HI>W. P's</HI> only &s;ubject there is to refute the doctrine of &s;atisfaction made by the &s;econ per|&s;on in the Trinity. Nay, <HI>Quakers</HI> too &s;ee it as plain as the No&s;e of a mans face, who do but lay a&s;ide their Religion, and take up Right Rea&s;on for one minuites time.</P>
<P>And though I could never believe <HI>C. Pu&s;ey</HI> would accept my Challenge, yet I pre&s;ented my &s;elf at <HI>Burlington</HI> the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, where he &s;ent his Pamphlet in&s;tead of appearing in per&s;on, &s;o that 'tis apparent that his Letter to me at <HI>Egg-harbour,</HI> to accept my Challenge, was only a cowardly &s;ham, at be&s;t; for el&s;e, why could he not as well have allowed me three Weeks time as three dayes? and why cannot he meet me now in &s;ix Months time, that I gave him, as well as in three dayes then, if his de&s;ign had been hone&s;t? Nay, he makes it appear in his Pamphlet, that his intentions were deceitfull, and only to mock me, for in p 17. he lets me know, that his de&s;ign was to chu&s;e <HI>Quakers,</HI> which is contrary to the Terms of my Challenge: This he kept hid from me in his blind Letter, where he tells me, he accepts my Challenge; yet now he lets me know he never intended to accept it.</P>
<P>But this was only to kidnap me, for they had provided a better argument for me, if they could have got me thither while <HI>W. P.</HI> was among&s;t them, even a Pri&s;on, their be&s;t argument of all; for at a Caball of them at the hou&s;e of <HI>S Carpenter,</HI> where <HI>W. P.</HI> dwelt, one of their Ju&s;tices, (<HI>viz. S. Richard&s;on</HI> by name) was heard to &s;ay, <HI>He would lay this</HI> Leeds <HI>in Goal for his Scribbling if he could meet him there</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Philadelphia</HI>) and doubtle&s;s <HI>W. P's</HI> influence
<PB N="9" REF="001113_0008_0FB0427837932088">
would have extended this argument to <HI>Burlington</HI> too; and this, a Friend gave me notice of, not long before, who heard this <HI>S. R.</HI> &s;peak tho&s;e words: I'll not be ungratefull to name the per&s;on at pre&s;ent, to expo&s;e my evidence to the Rage and Fury of the <HI>Quakers;</HI> there is a time for all things.</P>
<P>And thus far is the ba&s;ene&s;s of <HI>C P's</HI> de&s;ign di&s;covered; and let him laugh it out for vexations, if he plea&s;e. &mdash; Mean time, I think it as lawful for me to &s;hun the Malice of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as that <HI>Paul</HI> fled from the Malice of the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>But let me a litle examine his Pamphlet, as to the point in Controver&s;ie; for I de&s;ign to be brief, Therefore I think to pa&s;s by the re&s;t of his &s;tuff; yet I will ingage to prove, when need requires, that every page, (in an&s;wer to me, is &s;tuft with Perver&s;ions, Lyes, Abu&s;es or Slanders. And in the ca&s;e about the E&s;tate of <HI>T. Cro&s;s</HI> he is deceitful, and ba&s;e in writing that I expo&s;ed him in print before I demanded it of him, whom as I demanded it by <HI>R. Toung,</HI> my Wifes Father, who brought me his an&s;wer, and is ready to te&s;tify it to the face of him. But he writes like a <HI>Quaker,</HI> therefore it doth not much move me.</P>
<P>But as to the point in hand, I perceive he is in pain about it; for he labours hard, and as the Maxim is, <HI>Who &s;o labours to prove a thing to another, him&s;elf di&s;tru&s;ts it?</HI> And at la&s;t I find it &s;o, for he falls a few Coggs lower, even to a confe&s;&s;ion of my Charge; for though he denyes that <HI>W. P.</HI> held <HI>Chri&s;t as Man to be a Finite Impotent Creature,</HI> yet in P. 25 he in effect confe&s;&s;es it, as if he were Mumbling of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. And becau&s;e he had called it a bla&s;phemous Charge in me, &s;o to affirm of <HI>W. P.</HI> therefore he blunders at it, and will needs thru&s;t in the Prie&s;ts along with W P. as holding the &s;ame, <HI>Both the Prie&s;ts and</HI> W. P. <HI>did own</HI> (&s;ayes he) <HI>that
<PB N="10" REF="001113_0009_0FB0427906C53720">
Chri&s;t as man was Finite.</HI> Nay, in P. 26. he brings <HI>G. Keith</HI> in too, as holding Chri&s;t as Man to be a Creature, and then he adds, <HI>&s;urely nothing created can be either Infinite or Omnipotent.</HI> Here now he grants, that if Chri&s;t, as Man be Created, he mu&s;t needs be a <HI>Finite Impotent Creature;</HI> yea, he is very willing we &s;hould know, that if it be fal&s;e Doctrine, that <HI>G. K.</HI> and the Prie&s;ts are of that faith, but loath he is that <HI>W. Penn</HI> &s;hould be &s;aid to hold &s;o But alas! this is a &s;hameful begging of the Que&s;tion; for I never denyed or di&s;puted this point; I know Per&s;ons of &s;everal Societies of <HI>Chri&s;tans</HI> (as well as <HI>W. P.</HI>) hold Chri&s;t, as Man, to be <HI>Finite</HI> and <HI>Impotent,</HI> but as God, <HI>Infinite</HI> and <HI>Omnipotent,</HI> and I dare not call it Bla&s;phemy &s;o to affirm, as he has ignorantly and ra&s;hly done; 'tis a point beyond my capacity to determine, whether it be Orthodox or not. The point between <HI>Caleb Pu&s;ey</HI> and me, is not whether the Doctrine be True or fal&s;e, but Whether W. P. holds &s;o or not; nor did I ever bring it again&s;t W. P. as fal&s;e Doctrine, but as Contradictory to other of his and his Brethrens Books.</P>
<P>Hence now may be &s;een what &s;ort of &s;tuff the re&s;t of his Book is; for I propo&s;ed this as the Rule and Touch&s;tone of Tryal between us, to try the re&s;t of his Book by, This being by him reputed a Capital, or the Cheif Article or Crime again&s;t me, which now he dare not &s;how his head to vindicate, but on the contrary has at la&s;t (with a blundering unwillingne&s;s) confe&s;&s;ed it, as by me charged; and now I expect he mu&s;t again open his Mu&s;ter-Rool of Rattles and Non&s;en&s;e and compo&s;e another Book in an&s;wer to this, that when his Neighbours tell him of this, he may &s;top their voyces, by &s;aying, he has or will an&s;wer it.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Whereas he in&s;inuates, p. 17. <HI>That I would take
<PB N="11" REF="001113_0010_0FB04279AD2F3708">
men of my own party to judge of the ca&s;e, but ty him from Chu&s;ing of his Party.</HI> But this is a fal&s;e in&s;inuation, I never de&s;igned to take men of my own Party, nor can any &s;uch thing be gathered from any words in my Challenge; &s;o that this is a Quibbling Eva&s;ion, like the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve he tells, p. 12. <HI>That</HI> W. P. &s;ays, <HI>'tis a horrid Abu&s;e put on him;</HI> but if W. P. &s;ays &s;o, 'tis evident that he &s;peaks it not as a Man or a Gentleman, but as a <HI>Quaker,</HI> &amp; his Religion obliges him to &s;ay it. For Why? the <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;ay the &s;ame in their an&s;wer to G. K's broad Sheet of about Fifty Quotations out of their Books, which though eight Mini&s;ters have atte&s;ted to the truth of them and my &s;elf by comparing the Quotations have certain knowledge they are true, yet they boldly call them horrid Lyes: So that what Truth is it that in &s;uch ca&s;es they will not call horrid Lyes? Hence I appeal to all <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> Whether &s;uch men are fit judges in their own ca&s;es? and whether by the&s;e &s;ore of Writings, Sayings and Un&s;ayings, &amp;c. of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> they do not make the whole body of Chri&s;tians look <HI>Black and Odious</HI> (to u&s;e C. P's Terms) <HI>in the eyes of Runigadoes, Julian Apostates, Scavengers, Atheists, Infidels, Turks and Jews?</HI> Though indeed the&s;e are the terms that <HI>C. P.</HI> in his Pamphlet, from his mode&s;t <HI>Quaker Property</HI> be&s;tows on me, and on tho&s;e who have been &s;o kind to him (it &s;eems) as to an&s;wer his Call, in &s;hewing him and his (pretended Perfect) Brethren their Sin and Imperfection. But enough of this, lea&s;t I move him to call for the Names of more of his Unclean Tribe, next time he Prints.</P>
