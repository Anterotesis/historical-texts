<HEAD>SOME <HI>THOUGHTS</HI> ON THE GLOOMY CLOUD THAT HANGS OVER <HI>NEW-ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOME &s;ay, becau&s;e Chri&s;t died for ALL, that ALL will be &s;aved; becau&s;e the &s;cripture &s;aith <Q>that the LORD will have ALL men to be &s;aved and come to the knowledge of the truth</Q> And as GOD is a Being of power, to perform his will, &s;o con&s;equently none can be lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="024803_0004_0FC8A3976893D528">
HOPKINTO'S. Say, CHRIST died for the Elect only, and they only can be &s;aved: That al|tho' God calls upon all men to turn, repent, and be &s;aved, that he doth not intend they &s;hall, for he hath before decreed, their &s;in and damnation, and that God intended &s;in &s;hould come into the world and make a part of the creation eternally mi&s;erable: and to prove it, they &s;ay, God had power to &s;ave all, of he plea&s;ed; and that he delights as much in the damnation of tho&s;e that are damned, as in the &s;alvation of tho&s;e that are &s;aved.</P>
<P>The Armenians &s;ays, children are born free from &s;in, and if they do as well as they can, God will have mercy upon them, and &s;ave them.</P>
<P>Shakers &s;ay, that men will be damn'd, if they lodge with their own wives, and that they mu&s;t believe God through the mother, and the elders, or they cannot be &s;aved, and that they mu&s;t obtain victory over &s;in and lu&s;t, by dancing and &s;haking.</P>
<P>Many &s;chool ma&s;ters &s;ay, the bible is not a &s;uitable book to bring into our common &s;chools, but after children have learnt to read, they &s;ay it is more &s;uitable for them to read in &s;ome hi&s;tory, idle tales, or novels.</P>

<HEAD>An&s;wer to Univer&s;ali&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>WE read of the la&s;t judgment, "That the dead &s;mall and great, &s;tand before God, and that the Sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and hell delivered up the dead that were in them; and they were judged ac|cording to their works: and death and hell were ca&s;t into the lake of fire, which is the &s;econd death; and they that were not written in the book of life, were ca&s;t into the lake of fire, which is the &s;econd death", and we read of no re&s;toration after that in the holy &s;criptures.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>An&s;wer to Hopkintonians.</HEAD>
<P>IF God has cho&s;en the &s;in and de&s;truction of tho&s;e that are damned, then the &s;criptures mu&s;t be read that God hath long cho&s;en the &s;in and de&s;truction of the old world, in&s;tead of its being read, That the long &s;ufferings of God, waited in the days of Noah.</P>

<P>"BEHOLD I was &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother conceive me." And the &s;cripture &s;aith, "Not unto us, not unto us; but to thy name be the glory".</P>

<P>"THE angel of the Lord, &s;aid unto Jo&s;eph, fear not to take unto thee, Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived of her, is of the Holy Gho&s;t". And afterwards we read of Chri&s;ts mother and his brethren.</P>

<HEAD>An&s;wer to School-Ma&s;ters, Who would neglect the bible in Schools, with &s;uch excu&s;es as the&s;e, That it belongs to mini&s;ters to teach them religion, and that it is not &s;uitable to teach the bible in &s;chools, becau&s;e the &s;chools will make a mock of it.</HEAD>
<P>IS this thy care, O vain &s;chool-ma&s;ter? to neglect the bible in thy &s;chool, and teach mockery and novelty; wilt thou render thy &s;chools &s;o much like a company of &s;wine, that pearls &s;hould not be ca&s;t before them? wilt thou teach them &s;o much abomination, that they will abominate tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;t on their attention to the &s;criptures, and require them to neglect their mockery, now in their youth.</P>
<P>When mini&s;ters and &s;chool-ma&s;ters &s;et in the &s;corners &s;eat, how hard it is for religious par|ents to re&s;train their children, and to bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</P>
<P>When America has &s;o manfully fought for liberty, &s;hall they now breed and nur&s;e up a
<PB N="7" REF="024803_0007_0FC8A3A6AF0BC708">&s;erpent in it, to en&s;lave them; and mu&s;t the church be driven to the wilderne&s;s, to be nuri&s;h|ed from the face of the &s;erpent. Mu&s;t evil cu&s;toms bring on evil laws. Shall we believe &s;elfi&s;h men, that are nur&s;ing up young lions to devour. Shall we hear their voice on the moun|tains of America?</P>
<P>Ble&s;t is the man that tru&s;ts in God, knows his holy word, and turns his eyes from vanity, who&s;e &s;oul alone on God relies.</P>
<P>Let us learn to de&s;pi&s;e the vain flatteries of men, and tru&s;t in God. Can men pray to the God of truth, for his ble&s;&s;ing on their novelties, or on their exhibitions and plays, do &s;uch mini&s;|ters pray to God to lead them in the way of holine&s;s, when they are going to the place of wickedne&s;s, are they turning off their eyes from beholding vanity, and meditating on the law of God. Can a fountain at the &s;ame place &s;end fourth &s;alt water and fre&s;h?</P>
<P>"Can a man &s;erve God and his own lu&s;ts" Wo to them that call evil good, and good evil.</P>
<P>Be not of them that do evil, that good may come, who&s;e damnation is ju&s;t. Mu&s;t we not give an account for every idle word, at the day of judgment? Some are &s;aying, this new mode of learning is to make them great men.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="024803_0008_0FC8A3AB73076A60">
The &s;criptures &s;aith, "the merchants are the great men of the earth, for by their &s;orceries were all nations deceived".</P>
<P>Some &s;ay, that children will learn fa&s;ter, to teach them vanity, than to teach them that which is good. Shall &s;chool-ma&s;ters, becau&s;e children choo&s;e the way that leads to de&s;truc|tion help them along? are &s;uch teachers friends or enemies to the children?</P>
<P>"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wi&s;dom, and to depart from evil is good un|der&s;tanding".</P>
