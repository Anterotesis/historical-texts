<P>SEVERAL of the Editors in their introductions to the following Te&s;timonies, have informed us that the con&s;ent of the Preacher to their publication, tho' &s;olicited, had not been obtained, which is a&s;&s;igned as a rea&s;on for not in&s;erting his name;&mdash;it may now be unnece&s;&s;ary to with-hold it, as by his removal from this &s;tate of probation, beyond the reach of human cen|&s;ure or human applau&s;e, the Reader may be gratified therewith, without giving ju&s;t occa&s;ion of offence to any. Several attempts to de&s;cribe this worthy Servant of CHRIST appeared in the public prints &s;oon after his decea&s;e&mdash;two of tho&s;e characters are part of the pre&s;ent collection, which with the account given of his religious progre&s;s and faithful labours in the Go&s;pel of JESUS, by his Brethren in religious profe&s;&s;ion, extracted from Piety promoted, the eighth part, may be a &s;ufficient information to tho&s;e readers who were unacquainted with him and, the high e&s;timation in which he was held by tho&s;e who knew him be&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF THE LATE MR. <HI>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL,</HI> BROTHER TO THE PHYSICIAN DR. FOTHERGILL,</HEAD>
<P>TO commemorate the virtues of great and eminent men, who have been honourable in their day, is a tribute due to their memory. A tribute which &s;en&s;ible men pay from emotions of re&s;pectful gratitude; and from a hope that it may prove an incentive to the Living to emulate their virtues.</P>
<P>Of this cla&s;s the late Mr. SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington, an eminent Preacher among the Qua|kers, may with great ju&s;tice be ranked. I knew him well, and had the happine&s;s of his occa&s;ional acquaint|ance; I call it the happine&s;s, becau&s;e I never enjoyed the company of any per&s;on from whom I received more real &s;atisfaction; and however diver&s;ified with affliction, the future part of my life may prove, I &s;hall never re|member tho&s;e hours I have &s;pent with him, but with pe|culiar plea&s;ure. He was an happy compound of the
<PB N="4" REF="016777_0004_0F9E2EDD28DC01B8">gentleman and the chri&s;tian; the virtues and amiable qualities of each character being admirably blended in him. Graceful in his per&s;on and deportment, ea&s;y and affable in his manner, he commanded both re&s;pect and love; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed natural abilities far &s;uperior to the generality of mankind; and improved them to the ut|mo&s;t of his power. Well read both in books and men, his &s;tudies did not terminate in barren &s;peculation; but the great truths of religion were deeply implanted in his heart, and beamed forth illu&s;triou&s;ly in a benevolent and truly chri&s;tian conduct.</P>
<P>As a member of civil &s;ociety he was exceedingly u&s;eful, filling up the &s;ocial and relative duties of life with great propriety. Blamele&s;s in his manners, kind, charitable, and ready on all occa&s;ions to devote his time and talents to promote the be&s;t of all cau&s;es, the good of mankind. He lived beloved, and his lo&s;s is deeply deplored by all who had the happine&s;s of know|ing his worth.</P>
<P>As a Preacher, he was far &s;uperior to mo&s;t who fill that &s;tation: Sound in the important doctrines of the chri&s;tian faith, he endeavoured to promote them uni|ver&s;ally, with the greate&s;t energy of language, and the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence. In this capacity he was indeed truly great; and his greatne&s;s received additi|onal lu&s;tre from his humility. Although followed by numbers, and courted by per&s;ons of &s;uperior rank and &s;tation, and admired by tho&s;e of all per&s;ua&s;ions, the applau&s;e which his eminence ju&s;tly acquired, did not exalt, but evidently tended to make him humble. He was a per&s;on of an enlarged mind, zealous without bigotry, and a &s;teady promoter of univer&s;al charity. In his &s;ermons, it was evident to all his intelligent hearers, that he deeply felt the force of tho&s;e &s;olemn truths he delivered; and his manner of di&s;playing them was &s;o ju&s;tly emphatical, that none but the in&s;en&s;ible
<PB N="5" REF="016777_0005_0F9E2EDEF3472E98">or obdurate could with&s;tand their force, or remain un|affected by them. He travelled much from the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted motives, among his friends in Great-Bri|tain, Ireland, and the American Colonies, for the pro|motion of piety and chri&s;tian virtue, and for the ad|vancement of that faith and religion in which he mo&s;t &s;urely believed, and was &s;o eminent an example.</P>
<P>During the latter part of his life he was much in|di&s;po&s;ed in his health; but (as I have heard from the be&s;t authority) perfectly happy and ea&s;y in his mind, having an evidence in him&s;elf that he was approach|ing that &s;tate of felicity which is prepared for the righteous. This evidence &s;upported him through the remains of a painful life, and was his unfailing hope in the awful hour of death, which (when near his end) he declared, <Q>Had no terrors, nor would the grave have any victory.</Q> And al&s;o added, <Q>That as he had lived, &s;o he &s;hould clo&s;e with the mo&s;t un&s;haken a&s;&s;urance, that he had not followed cunningly devi&s;ed fables, but the pure living and eternal &s;ub&s;tance.</Q> Such was his exemplary life&mdash;Such his triumphant death!</P>
<P>A life &s;o &s;pent is truly honourable&mdash;And &s;uch a death un&s;peakably glorious.</P>

<P>ON the 15th in&s;tant paid the la&s;t debt of nature, Mr. SAMUEL POTHERGILL, of Warrington, an eminent Preacher among&s;t the people called Quakers, endowed with qualifications &s;uperior to mo&s;t, and ani|mated by a zeal truly apo&s;tolic, he long preached the intere&s;ting truths of the go&s;pel to mankind; whil&s;t the uniform tenor of his life, devoted to religion and &s;pent in the practice of every virtue, was the &s;tronge&s;t com|ment on his doctrine.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="biography">
<P>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington in Lanca&s;hire, was the &s;ixth &s;on of our worthy an|cient friend JOHN FOTHERGILL, mentioned in this Treati&s;e; &s;ee page 29, and of MARGARET his wife, for an account of whom &s;ee volume the &s;ixth, page 90, of Piety promoted.</P>
<P>This their &s;on being of an active and lively di&s;po&s;i|tion, and during his apprentice&s;hip mo&s;tly from under the watchful eye of his affectionate parent, he fled from the Holy Cro&s;s of CHRIST, and indulged him&s;elf in the gratifications of folly and licentiou&s;ne&s;s; violating the repeated convictions of divine grace in his own mind, which had been mercifully extended from his early years, thereby wounding the &s;oul of his tender father (of who&s;e religious care to form and lead the tender minds of his children to piety and virtue, we have an account in the memoirs of his life;) yet his pious admonitions proved neverthele&s;s, as bread ca&s;t on the waters, which returned after many days; for about the twenty fir&s;t year of his age, the vi&s;itation of divine love was &s;o powerfully renewed, that it proved effectual to turn his &s;teps out of the paths of vanity; and as he has expre&s;&s;ed, with humble and awful gratitude to the Pre&s;erver of men, <HI>It then appeared clear to his under|&s;tanding,
<PB N="7" REF="016777_0007_0F9E2EDFE416FBB0">that would be the la&s;t call the heavenly Father would favour him with;</HI> he therefore con&s;ulted no long|er with fle&s;h and blood, but gave up to the holy vi&s;i|tation, devoting his whole heart and affections to &s;uch reconciliation with GOD, through the mediation of JESUS CHRIST; and abiding in great humility under the purifying operation of the holy Gho&s;t and fire, he became thereby qualified for tho&s;e eminent &s;ervices he was called into; for in a few months, by the con|&s;traning power and love of GOD, his mouth was open|ed to bear a Te&s;timony to the &s;ufficiency of that holy Arm that had plucked him as a brand out of the fire: Thus a di&s;pen&s;ation of the mini&s;try being committed to his charge, he attended faithfully thereto, and moved therein at the requirings, and under the direction of divine wi&s;dom, by which means he &s;oon became an able mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, called thereto and qualified by the Holy Gho&s;t, under which influence he laboured with diligence and devoted much of his time and &s;trength, when health permitted, to the &s;ervice of his dear LORD and Ma&s;ter; for the continuance of who&s;e favours he counted nothing too near or dear to part with, that he might be in&s;trumental in gathering &s;ouls to GOD, which was the object he had in view in all his go&s;pel labours; being diligent him&s;elf, he endeavour|ed much to excite friends to a due and con&s;tant at|tendance of meetings for religious wor&s;hip, and tho&s;e for the di&s;ciplince of the church.</P>
<P>Thro' the cour&s;e of his go&s;pel labours, both in pub|lic and private, animated by divine love, he expre&s;&s;ed an uncommon warmth of affection for the ri&s;ing youth of this generation, with whom he was frequently led into a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> brotherly feeling and &s;ympathy for their pre&s;ent and eternal welfare; under which concern his love to this cla&s;s of both &s;exes, under all denominati|ons, was &s;trong and ardent.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016777_0008_0F9E2EE09911B980">
He travelled much in this Nation and Scotland, &s;e|veral times in Ireland, and once through mo&s;t of the North American Colonies, in the &s;ervice of truth; where, tho' &s;ingularly humbled in a &s;en&s;e of poverty, weakne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency on his fir&s;t landing, he was by accounts received, marvelou&s;ly &s;trengthened, both in public and private, in go&s;pel authority and love, to the awakening and comforting of many.</P>
<P>In the fore part of the year 1769, he vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the families of friends in the monthly-meeting of Grace church &s;treet, London; in which &s;ervice he was divine|ly &s;trengthened and enabled to extend a helping hand to many in clo&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary labour, for their in|crea&s;ing care, to live and act con&s;i&s;tent with our holy profe&s;&s;ion, to the comfort and help of divers, and his own peace; and afterwards, at two different opportu|nities, he vi&s;ited the families of friends in Hor&s;lydown and We&s;tmin&s;ter monthly-meetings in that city, to the &s;ame good effect.</P>
<P>He mo&s;tly attended the yearly-meetings in London, and other places, when of bodily ability; in which his go&s;pel labours were very acceptable and edifying; being particularly careful when called from home, to return to his family and friends with as much expedition as the nature of his &s;ervice would admit.</P>
<P>Having acquired a moderate competency by his dili|gence and indu&s;try, he declined trade for &s;everal years before his decea&s;e, devoting his time and talents to the &s;ervice of the churches. As a Pillar in the Lord's hou&s;e he was &s;tedfa&s;t, being actuated by a chri&s;tian and manly zeal; in deportment grave; his private con|ver&s;ation was &s;avory and edifying, corre&s;ponding with his mini&s;try, which at times went forth as a flame, piercing the obdurate, yet di&s;cended like dew upon the tender plants of our heavenly Father's planting, the
<PB N="9" REF="016777_0009_0F9E2EE154BE39F8">true mourners in zion, with the&s;e he travelled in a deep &s;ympathy of &s;pirit; in his go&s;pel labours free from affectation, in doctrine clear, &s;ound and pathetic, filled with charity, allowing for the prejudices of mankind, being indeed a mini&s;ter and elder worthy of double honour, &s;peaking whereof he knew, and what his own hands had handled of the good word of life.</P>
<P>He endured a long and painful illne&s;s with much patience and re&s;ignation, and towards the clo&s;e of his time expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;ome of his relations, when they took leave of him, previous to their &s;etting out for the yearly-meeting in London, to the following effect: <HI>Our health is no more at our command, than length of days:&mdash;Mine &s;eems drawing fa&s;t towards a conclu&s;ion; but I am content with every allotment of Providence, for they are all in wi&s;dom,&mdash;unerring wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There is one thing which as an arm underneath, bears up and &s;upports; and tho' the rolling tempe&s;tuous billows &s;urround, yet my head is kept above them, and my feet are firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed.&mdash;O! &s;eek it,&mdash;pre&s;s after it,&mdash;lay fa&s;t hold of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tho' painful my nights, and weari&s;ome my days, yet I am pre&s;erved in patience and re&s;ignation.&mdash;Death has no terrors, nor will the grave have any victory.&mdash;My &s;oul triumphs over death, hell and the grave.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hu&s;bands and wives, parents and children, health and riches, mu&s;t all go&mdash;di&s;appointment is another name for them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hould have been thankful had I been able to have got to the en&s;uing yearly-meeting in London, which you are now going to attend, where I have been &s;o often re|fre&s;hed

<P><HI>I feel a foreta&s;te of that joy that is to come;&mdash;and who would wi&s;h to change &s;uch a &s;tate of mind?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hould be glad if an ea&s;y channel could be found to inform the yearly-meeting that as I have lived, &s;o I &s;hall clo&s;e, with the mo&s;t un&s;haken a&s;&s;urance, that we have not followed cunningly devi&s;ed fables, but the pure living eter|nal &s;ub&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let the aged be &s;trong, let the middle aged be animat|ed, and the youth encouraged; for the Lord is &s;till with Zion; the Lord will ble&s;s Zion.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>Extract from the Publi&s;her's Introduction to the Printer of the public Ledger, dated London, September</HI> 4, 1769.</HEAD>
<P>"On a vi&s;it lately to a literary acquaintance in the country, I met with the enclo&s;ed manu&s;cript copy of an Epi&s;tle to the inhabitants of Tortola in America, addre&s;&s;ed to a &s;ociety under the di&s;tingui&s;hed appella|tion of Friends.

It is but ju&s;tice to acknowledge that neither the author, nor his relations know any thing of its being conveyed to the pre&s;s for public in&s;pecti|on.

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO FRIENDS IN THE ISLAND OF <HI>TORTOLA.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I am per&s;onally a &s;tranger, and un|known to mo&s;t of you; yet ye have been, of late time e&s;pecially, &s;o frequently the &s;ubject of clo&s;e thoughtfulne&s;s to me, and with &s;o much warmth as to engage my mind to vi&s;it you in a collective capacity with this Epi&s;tle, from &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of duty, and with an heart repleni&s;hed with &s;incere good will, in which I wi&s;h you the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that happine&s;s which is everla&s;ting.</P>
<P>It was tidings of great joy to the living body of friends in this land, to hear that the Lord Almighty was at work in your I&s;land to beget children to him&s;elf: and that the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tantial virtue which wrought upon many in this and other nations, to redeem and purify them a people to the prai&s;e of his great name, had al&s;o vi&s;ited you with the day-&s;pring from on high; and pro|duced the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed fruits in mea&s;ure, even a death
<PB N="13" REF="016777_0013_0F9E2EE91ECA89B0">unto &s;in, and a new birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s; and, by the bapti&s;m of the Holy Gho&s;t, brought them into the body whereof Chri&s;t is head.</P>
<P>Oh the tenderne&s;s, the fear, and watchfulne&s;s, which attended &s;ome of your &s;ouls in that day! A precious day of vi&s;itation, which ought for ever to be remembered; a day wherein the Lord allured &s;ome of you, and brought you into the wilderne&s;s; &s;peaking comfortably to you, and in his own time, gave you vineyards from thence. Some of you, I believe, have in remembrance tho&s;e times of divine betrothing, and cannot but ac|knowledge it was the Lord's doing. Then the mind was humbled as in the du&s;t, and a living concern aro&s;e to walk in white, and to enter into covenant with the Lord your God. A covenant you then hoped would never be broken; in this &s;implicity of heart, the Lord's children are ever &s;afe&s;t; almighty power watching over them for good, and regarding them with a father's care.</P>
<P>As individuals among&s;t you were thus engaged, the &s;piritual &s;ympathy and fellow&s;hip of the one body &s;pread over &s;ea and land; and we became as epi&s;tles written in one another's hearts; and were baptized by the one &s;pirit into the one body, wherein is the bond of peace, and unity of the faints; in this &s;tood our rejoicing on your account; for it is not the acce&s;&s;ion of numbers to any name or di&s;tinction among&s;t men, but the gather|ing of &s;ouls to the everla&s;ting &s;hepherd, which gives joy to the Lord's family in heaven and earth.</P>
<P>Now, dear Friends, is not the dew of your morning at times brought to recollection, and its heavenly reli&s;h remembered, yet hath not a lo&s;s &s;en&s;ibly attended you, and the once promi&s;ing plantation among&s;t you become le&s;s fruitful and beautiful? If &s;o, where &s;hall we enquire for the cau&s;e? We &s;hall not find any deficiency in divine compa&s;&s;ion; but the lo&s;s hath been occa&s;ioned by a ne|glect
<PB N="14" REF="016777_0014_0F9E2EE993BE5DF8">to follow on to know the Lord in his own way and leadings; and a departure in heart from him hath en&s;ued, whereby the work hath been marred; and that goodne&s;s, wherein the holy unchangeable one would have e&s;tabli&s;h|ed you, and rendered a permanent ble&s;&s;ing and beauty to you, hath been to too many as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it hath &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>Such ever was the con&s;equence of unfaithfulne&s;s to the di&s;coveries of the pure light; weakne&s;s, revolt, and back-&s;liding have en&s;ued, and when people have for&s;aken the fountain of living waters (which is open for &s;anctifica|tion and refre&s;hment) all their labour and inventions have been as broken ci&s;terns that can hold no water, and the latter end of &s;uch, unle&s;s they return and repent, will be wor&s;e than their former un-enlightened &s;tate.</P>
<P>Bear with me, dear friends, in this freedom: My &s;oul longs for your help and re&s;toration; that by and through you the great name may be exalted in tho&s;e I&s;lands, and <HI>that</HI> part of the Lord's foot&s;tool may be|come glorious.</P>
<P>Let, I be&s;eech you, the &s;eeming foremo&s;t rank among&s;t you, look clo&s;ely to their own &s;teps; and con&s;ider care|fully, whether they have not by &s;ome means contributed to the general decay of lively zeal and care, through their own declen&s;ion and lukewarmne&s;s, for it is mo&s;t certain the faithfulne&s;s, or unfaithfulne&s;s of this rank hath a very great influence over young and tender minds, as well as of tho&s;e who may be more advanced in years, than experience, and yet not void of a &s;ecret reli&s;h for heavenly matters. Return, therefore, I be&s;eech you, O ye Chiefs among&s;t the people, to your fir&s;t love, and do your fir&s;t works le&s;t greater de&s;olation en&s;ue; and he, who walketh in the mid&s;t of the &s;even golden candle|&s;ticks, come unto you quickly, and remove your's out of its place; for why &s;hould the candle&s;tick remain, when the light and lu&s;tre of the candle is extingui&s;hed.</P>

And dearly beloved friends of the ri&s;ing generation, and ye in the prime of your life, &s;uffer and receive the word of exhortation from one who tenderly loves you; remember your Creator and your Judge.

Let not, therefore, the evil example of others, nor the reproach of the &s;cornful prevail to your hurt; but retain the fear of God, which will keep the heart clean; and be an excellent enduring trea&s;ure, when every thing el&s;e &s;hall vani&s;h as a vapour.</P>
<P>And it mo&s;t certainly behoves you, friends, who are natives of this land, and have had your education among&s;t us as a people, and been frequently directed to the heavenly monitor, to walk with great circum&s;pecti|on: Ye are among&s;t a people who have been made par|takers of the like precious faith with us, principally through the immediate reach of the divine hand. Will not their eyes be turned to look at your conduct, and to ob&s;erve the fruits of your faith, by its prevalence in your lives and conver&s;ations: And if in&s;tead of the ble&s;&s;ed fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the contrary &s;hould appear, and your conduct be the means of &s;tumbling to any, and evil liberties be pur&s;ued by you to your own and others hurt; to &s;uch I te&s;tify in the name, and under an awful &s;en&s;e of the authority of the Mo&s;t High, it had been better for them never to have known the way of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s. Heavy, very heavy will be the weight of
<PB N="16" REF="016777_0016_0F9E2EEB5C03CC78">complicated guilt of their own tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of others made wor&s;e by their example. Wo from a righteous and dreadful God, to tho&s;e by whom &s;uch offences come.</P>
<P>I make no doubt but there are among&s;t you an hone&s;t &s;eed; an afflicted and poor people, &s;ome of the Lord's poor, who retain in &s;ome good degree, their fir&s;t love, and bewail the hurt of Zion. I be&s;eech &s;uch to &s;tand fa&s;t in their own lots, abide in the faith and patience; be &s;ober and hope to the end. Though the times are gloomy, the out-goings of the morning are of God, and he can, and will in his own time, cau&s;e the wilderne&s;s to become a fruitful field. Look not too much at the declen&s;ion of others, le&s;t your faith &s;hould fail, but &s;tedfa&s;tly look to, and follow on to know the Lord Al|mighty, who remains for ever, and the defection of multitudes can by no means impair his unchangeable truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In a &s;en&s;e of the fre&s;h extendings of ancient all &s;uffi|cient help, I mo&s;t tenderly and affectionately &s;alute you; may the &s;cattered among&s;t you be brought home, and the negligent be rou&s;ed to diligence, whil&s;t yet a little day continues. Let the tender breathings &s;till remaining be cheri&s;hed, that they may gather &s;trength, and enter with holy prevalence the ear of the Lord and Father of his people. This is the &s;incere prayer of one concerned at heart, for your re&s;toration and &s;tability in righteou&s;|ne&s;s and peace forever.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following pathetic, and moving exhor|tations, were, as carefully as po&s;&s;ible, taken down in characters, as they flowed from the lips of the preacher to large and crowded audiences; at which were pre&s;ent numbers of different per|&s;ua&s;ions: many of whom have reque&s;ted copies of the tran&s;cript; and others have de&s;ired, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, that they might be made &s;till more public, by means of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The writer is de&s;irous of obliging many, with|out offence to any individual&mdash;The manu&s;cript hath been read and approved of, by numbers of &s;uperior judgment, who were pre&s;ent; and who have joined in this opinion, that from their being publi&s;hed, good may proceed to the well di&s;po&s;ed; nor can any kind of harm be fore&s;een to accrue from hence.</P>
<P>The writer is not con&s;cious of having mi&s;taken the author's &s;en&s;e: And if to the memory of any who were then pre&s;ent, there &s;hould occur any va|riations from his immediate expre&s;&s;ions, the editor is a&s;&s;ured there can be but few, and tho&s;e not of moment, he having to the readie&s;t expedition, joined the mo&s;t perfect attention, tho' in a crowd|ed congregation (where he could have no other re&s;t, or &s;upport, than the hand or the knee.)</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="016777_0019_0F9E2EEFAE68CC60">
Indeed! the lively force and heart-felt energy with which the &s;ub&s;equent exhortations were de|livered, mu&s;t remain from that time wanting: nor is it material to offer, that it is not in the power of the mo&s;t faithful tran&s;criber, to convey that enforcing part to his readers. The texts, i. e. chapter and ver&s;e, have been &s;ince added, in or|der to illu&s;trate the work, and render it (if po&s;&s;i|ble!) more plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The editor hath likewi&s;e taken down (by de&s;ire) two other Sermons, from the &s;ame preacher; the &s;ubject of the fir&s;t taken from the prayer of Agur, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxx. 7, 8, and 9. the other from <HI>Cant.</HI> iv. and 12, and at the clo&s;e of each, a Prayer; but tho&s;e will continue in manu&s;cript unle&s;s a public edition of them be encouraged.</P>
<P>As the mini&s;ter hath been repeatedly &s;olicited, but in vain, to con&s;ent to the pre&s;ent publication; the reader mu&s;t not wonder that his name is not publi&s;hed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The following Sermon was delivered, on Sunday morning the 17th day of May, 1767, at the</HI> opening <HI>of the yearly-meeting, at the Fryers, in Bri&s;tol.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xx. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Art thou in health; my brother?</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been in my mind to adopt the language of &s;alutation of Joab to Ama&s;a; but with &s;entiments different, far different, from tho&s;e which actuated the treachery of Joab; even tho&s;e of true and tender affection, and with a mind repleni&s;hed with that cha|rity, which wi&s;heth well to all.</P>
<P><HI>Art thou in health; my Brother?</HI></P>
<P>I could wi&s;h, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;olicitude, to lead every mind pre&s;ent, into the mo&s;t careful enquiry, in re&s;pect to their &s;piritual &s;tate of health; and to their immediate relation, and affinity, to that &s;upreme almighty being, who is the ju&s;t and awful judge of quick and dead. I fear it hath proceeded from too anxious a &s;olicitude for the health of your bodies, and pro&s;perity of your tem|poral concerns, that too many of you have too frequent|ly, and in a manner totally, neglected the great concern of your immortal &s;ouls; which is indeed <HI>the one thing needful.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e temporal concerns, I &s;ay, which are of a trifling peri&s;hing nature, have, I fear! interrupted and taken off from this principal concern: your anxiety and applicati|on towards the attainment of the trea&s;ures and the enjoy|ment of the plea&s;ures of the world, have occa&s;ioned too great a neglect of your religious duty.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="016777_0021_0F9E2EF1CB275CAB">
The conveniences of life are, by no means, a con|temptible concern, where they are bounded with tem|perance, and confined within their proper channel: but as there is a part in us of infinitely greater, of no le&s;s than eternal moment; it al&s;o requires an attention pro|portionable to its proper worth; for what are temporal concerns, when compared with the important one of eternity!</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the body is &s;ubject to divers maladies; and when we have done our utmo&s;t to pre&s;erve it, we &s;hall find in the end (and how &s;oon that may be none knows) that it is of nece&s;&s;ity, &s;ubject to the &s;troke of death, and to the inclo&s;ure of the grave.</P>
<P>I have therefore thought it by no means an improper enquiry for each individual to make, and deeply ponder, What is thy &s;tate, or how is it with thee, O my &s;oul! who art capable of partaking of immortal joys, and de&s;tined to triumph over death and the grave? <HI>When this earthly tabernacle &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved,</HI> thy appointment and de&s;tination, if in proper &s;oundne&s;s for it, &s;hall be made per&s;ect with the whole family of GOD, and be no longer &s;ubject to the di&s;ea&s;es, pains, trials and afflic|tions of this life, but &s;hare the things which are of GOD,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 23.</NOTE> <HI>With the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born, who&s;e names are written in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>As this is of the mo&s;t infinite importance to the &s;ons of men, I have thought it my particular duty, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to put you in mind of the nece&s;&s;ary enquiry into the &s;tate of your &s;piritual health; the con|dition of your immortal &s;ouls: being very apprehen|&s;ive that all of you, my brethren, are not in perfect health, who have outwardly the appearance of health; but that, on the contrary, many are in a dangerous
<PB N="23" REF="016777_0022_0F9E2EF1D6B9FE40">&s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e and &s;tupefaction; have only pre&s;erved a lethargic frame, and are tottering upon the brink of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>This enquiry into the pre&s;ent &s;tate of experience, and of advancement in the work of &s;alvation, hath branch|ed it&s;elf out in my view, and divided into &s;everal cla&s;&s;es, tho&s;e who are now within the audience of my voice. And, in the fir&s;t place, I intreat the attention of you, the elders, among&s;t whom our LORD, as among&s;t &s;o many &s;hepherds, hath divided his flock; over whom you are appointed to watch, and to teach them to per&s;evere in the path which leadeth to eternal life!</P>
<P>You have experienced the power of religion: you have<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>put on the armour of light;</HI> and ought to &s;tand as guardian angels, and to call as the angel called, &s;ay|ing,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Come up hither, and I will &s;hew thee the bride, the lamb's wife.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Are you in health,</HI> my brethren? <HI>Are you in health,</HI> my &s;i&s;ters?&mdash;<HI>Are you in health,</HI> my fellow labourers in the LORD?&mdash;Are you in a lively active &s;tate in the cau&s;e of religion? in the cau&s;e of virtue and tempe|rance? in the power of the go&s;pel, as it is in CHRIST?</P>
<P>If tho&s;e that have been called with an high and holy calling, as delegated &s;hepherds under the one great &s;hep|herd, walk uprightly in his fear and to his glory; then the &s;heep will with them be more likely to be gained upon to follow the great &s;hepherd; they will then have a frequent de&s;ire, a longing appetite after the divine Manna, which cometh down from GOD out of Hea|ven: for every life hath its food and its proper nutri|ment, and a &s;oul panting after Heaven can be &s;atisfied with nothing &s;hort of the <HI>food</HI> from Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="016777_0023_0F9E2EF28E3B5B38">
In the next place, I addre&s;s <HI>you,</HI> my brethren in the work of the mini&s;try, reminding you of its divine in|&s;titution, all that have entered rightly into it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 4.</NOTE> <HI>being called of God, as was Aaron.</HI></P>
<P>It is written,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm civ. 4</NOTE> <HI>he maketh his angels &s;pirits, and his mini&s;ters a flame of fire;</HI> and tho' the term <HI>angels</HI> be generally under&s;tood of the glorified &s;pirits in Heaven; yet, as it &s;ignifies <HI>me&s;&s;engers,</HI> it here &s;eems to be ap|plicable to tho&s;e whom the Mo&s;t High prepares and &s;ends forth, to excite and enliven his militant church on earth.&mdash;<HI>Are you in health, my brethren:</HI>&mdash;It is the divine will that you be fed with cele&s;tial food; not with the unlawful things of the world, nor with the un|lawful love of its lawful things; but that you become <HI>as angels,</HI> and <HI>like his mini&s;tering &s;pirits,</HI> as a flame of fire. He will make you, if with due con&s;tancy ye adhere to, and attend on him, a &s;acred and fixed flame of love, and of light never to be extingui&s;hed: your care, and pains, and labour here will be but a moment, your reward will be <HI>a crown of life everla&s;ting.</HI> The bread that you eat, and the water that you drink, and of which ye mini&s;ter their due &s;hare to others, will be daily &s;pringing up in you unto everla&s;ting life! The di|vine Manna and the daily &s;acrifice will be continued. Re&s;t in hope,&mdash;look for the coming of your LORD.&mdash;Labour in the di&s;charge of your duty.</P>
<P>Indeed it hath &s;ometimes happened that &s;ome of the mini&s;ters of CHRIST,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>&s;tewards of the my&s;tery of God,</HI> have not been found faithful to what he required. Be ever mindful of the nece&s;&s;ity of putting on and wearing the &s;piritual robes, prefigured by tho&s;e of <HI>Aaron:</HI> the holy girdle about the loins; the brea&s;t-plate, with the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummin;</HI> the <HI>Bell</HI> and the <HI>Pomegra|nate.</HI> Some indeed have had the <HI>Bell</HI> &s;ending forth an empty unavailing &s;ound, but have wanted the <HI>Pome|granate,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="016777_0024_0F9E2EF34DE77A90">the &s;oul-enlivening fruit of the good &s;pirit of CHRIST, our everla&s;ting high prie&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>But I hope better things of you,</HI> beloved in CHRIST, <HI>and things that accompany &s;alvation.</HI> I am &s;ure we have need, with the utmo&s;t diligence, application, and care, to keep the loins of our minds girded about: we had need to &s;tand upon the watch: we have great need to maintain the utmo&s;t &s;teadine&s;s: for if we, who &s;tand in the fore front, &s;hould fall, we fall not alone: if we &s;lide from the path of truth, who among&s;t us will be able to &s;tand!</P>
<P>We ought to be endued with the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom, of judgment, and with &s;ound minds; which he hath promi&s;ed to them that a&s;k this ble&s;&s;ing from him, and hath made good his promi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Are you in health, my brethren?</HI> are you &s;trongly attached to the promotion and exaltation of that glori|ous cau&s;e which you have embarked in? have each of you a &s;hare in, and a proper care of the LORD'S work? do you watch over the flock attending on your mini&s;try, under the great &s;hepherd, and with the tenderne&s;s of go&s;pel love <HI>&s;eeking to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>I freely confe&s;s my own fears, that I am not in a &s;tate of perfect health and &s;ound mind; labouring as I ought in the work of the LORD. As it is a ta&s;k of the ut|mo&s;t importance, I ought to remain ever diffident of my own care, and to watch daily in the di&s;charge of a tru&s;t &s;o great and important as that of the recovery and pre&s;ervation <HI>of the lo&s;t &s;heep of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>The pro&s;tration of the &s;oul before the GOD and Fa|ther of mercies, in a cau&s;e of &s;uch infinite concern, is a continual duty, which can &s;carce ever be &s;ufficiently di&s;charged, The &s;ecret cry of my &s;oul has, after this
<PB N="26" REF="016777_0025_0F9E2EF44D2791A8">manner, frequently ari&s;en, "LORD! &s;pare thy people and ble&s;s thine heritage." I am fully per&s;uaded, my friends, were all the mini&s;ters and elders more ble&s;&s;ed with &s;ound health, the minds of the flock would be more filled with brotherly kindne&s;s, and more and more approach to that &s;tate which I have mentioned; they would know what is meant by the <HI>angels being &s;pirits,</HI> and how to under&s;tand his <HI>mini&s;ters being a flame of fire.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to another cla&s;s, whom I mean to ad|dre&s;s under the title of tho&s;e within the audience of my voice, who continue in a &s;ingle &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Are you in health; my brethren and &s;i&s;ters?</HI> are you po&s;&s;e&s;t of inward virtue, and of ability to live to GOD, as becometh his &s;aints; and which alone will lead you to eternal life: do you a&s;pire after the&s;e, with an una|bated zeal?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not expect always to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the good things of this life. The day may come when you will loath the abundance of your temporal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons: you will then be concerned that you have &s;o in|dulgently<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haggai. i. 4, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>dwelt in cieled hou&s;es, and have let the hou&s;e of God lie wa&s;te.</HI> Then you would be glad to have exchanged the fading plea&s;ures of life for the &s;ub|&s;tantial joys of eternity.</P>
<P>Recollect your&s;elves in the &s;pring time of life; con|&s;ider early the importance of this exchange, while you have it in your power to make it. Look up to an ob|ject more glorious than the pre&s;ent world can afford you, even to the joys of that eternal inheritance, which <HI>the children of the fir&s;t-born, the innumerable company of happy &s;pirits, the general a&s;&s;embly of ju&s;t men already
<PB N="27" REF="016777_0026_0F9E2EF4CB4A6568">made perfect,</HI> are repleni&s;hed with.&mdash;Plea&s;ures un&s;peak|able! that exi&s;t for evermore!</P>
<P><HI>Art thou in health, my brother?</HI>&mdash;my dear brethren, are ye fervently engaged in labouring, nece&s;&s;ary labour|ing, for the promotion of the cau&s;e of GOD upon earth?</P>
<P>O ye parents and heads of families, who are pla|ced as delegated &s;hepherds over them; timely beware, le&s;t the blood of your children, or of any part of your charge, fall on your heads: (if through your mi&s;conduct they become corrupted, and their &s;ouls peri&s;h.) Know that inqui&s;ition for blood will ha&s;ten from the &s;upreme judge, who hath divided the cla&s;&s;es of mankind; and, as it were, &s;eparated from the re&s;t tho&s;e who are parents, and have children:&mdash;his call is to the&s;e, <Q>Go work in my vineyard.</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e precious gifts which he hath given, as pledges of his love, are to be led and in&s;tructed by them with a proper authority.</P>
<P>If the parents experimentally felt the advantages of &s;piritual health in them&s;elves, then would they be con|cerned that the tender minds of their children &s;hould be properly cultivated with the knowledge of the LORD, and a fearful apprehen&s;ion of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing his &s;upreme commands. They would teach them to look further than mere temporal acqui&s;itions; even to GOD their Creator. They would bring them up in the nur|ture and fear of the LORD; in order that their minds might be filled from the &s;tore hou&s;e and magazine of boundle&s;s good, and early enriched with the joys of GOD'S &s;alvation: and <HI>this</HI> would naturally diffu&s;e the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction to the parents them&s;elves, to &s;ee their children become the delight and ornaments of hu|man nature, and fitted for a glorious change! <HI>the com|pany of Angels, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made per|fect.</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="016777_0027_0F9E2EF83ADF4618">The ties of nature, and the &s;tronger ties of gra|titude to him who gave the ble&s;&s;ing, call aloud for teach|ing the tender minds of your children, to walk in the &s;afe and delightful paths of virtue. With what &s;ati&s;|faction and compo&s;ure of mind will &s;uch parents be enabled to an&s;wer the great GOD, upon his awful exa|mination to this purpo&s;e: <Q>What have you done with tho&s;e tender &s;heep which I committed to your care in the wilderne&s;s? have you trained them up in &s;afe|ty?</Q>&mdash;How will &s;uch parents be &s;upported by a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having done their duty, in that &s;olemn hour!&mdash;They then may truly &s;ay, <Q>I have done my utmo&s;t within my contracted &s;phere, within the nar|row precincts of my allotment in life, to fill up my &s;tated duty.</Q> Then the &s;upreme judge will &s;et at his right hand &s;uch parents, and they &s;hall be united to him in glory.</P>
<P>And I be&s;eech you parents, elders, mini&s;ters, (and I include my&s;elf) let us all &s;ay Amen, to this &s;olemn care in our re&s;pective families; let us all di&s;charge our &s;everal duties as men, hoping for the coming of our LORD; who then will &s;ay unto us, <Q>Well done, good and faithful &s;ervants,</Q> even in that hour when he &s;hall come with terrors to make inqui&s;ition for blood thro' the various ranks, whether mini&s;ters, elders, heads of families, even throughout the various cla&s;&s;es of man|kind.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h all parents and heads of families would conti|nually walk, hand in hand with their children and fa|milies, in the path which leadeth to life eternal; daily watching over, and improving their ri&s;ing judgments, with the wi&s;dom which cometh from above; in&s;truct|ing and encouraging them in the contemplation of di|vine things! per&s;uading them to believe, as the truth is, that the things of this world are all uncertain, and fading away! that they have everla&s;ting man&s;ions erect|ed
<PB N="29" REF="016777_0028_0F9E2EF91AB27900">for them in the city of their GOD; where (if they fall not &s;hort, or turn not a&s;ide) they will enjoy the company of &s;aints and angels for ever more.</P>
<P><HI>Are you in health; my brethren and &s;i&s;ters?</HI></P>
<P>Exerci&s;e your&s;elves in this your pre&s;ent &s;tate, diffe|rently from tho&s;e, who&s;e faculties are bounded within the narrow limits of this world; cultivate, continually cultivate, the minds of your offspring: endeavouring to rai&s;e in them a proper comprehen&s;ion of the dignity of their natures, and to fix in them early a &s;teady be|lief of their <HI>immortality;</HI> which is of the utmo&s;t im|portance to all?</P>
<P>The hearts of tho&s;e are un&s;ound, who live in a per|petual attachment to the pride of life, who are conta|minated with the love of the world, wherein their chief happine&s;s appears to be placed: how can &s;uch point out the way to the city of GOD? how can they &s;ay to their children, <Q>Let us retreat from the world, from this &s;cene of corruption; let us withdraw from the cares, the &s;olicitudes of life: let us a&s;cend to our appointed home: let us contemplate the joys of eternity: let nothing &s;eparate us from that ble&s;&s;ed hope!</Q></P>
<P>How can parents thus addre&s;s their children, when they have, perhaps, for a long cour&s;e of years, cea&s;ed to con&s;ider the awful importance of the &s;ubject; and their own minds continue fixed, and tied down to the fading enjoyments of life! Alas! that the folly and va|nity of the &s;uperfluous plea&s;ures of the world &s;hould &s;o entirely engage and engro&s;s the attention of any one immortal individual, as to take up almo&s;t every mo|ment of their precious time!</P>
<P>Hence, &s;ometimes, parents, in&s;tead of in&s;tructing the minds of their children, have &s;o totally corrupted
<PB N="30" REF="016777_0029_0F9E2EFA76C5F130">their own, that they have laid ob&s;tructions in the way to the immortal happine&s;s of their offspring, and, when their children have for a time trod in the ways of reli|gion and virtue, they have been &s;o extremely corrupt them&s;elves, as to oppo&s;e them in their pa&s;&s;age; to ob|&s;truct them, with violence, in their way to glory; and thereby aggravated their own guilt beyond expre&s;&s;ion; alas! what will their puni&s;hment prove, when convict|ed of &s;o great a neglect and violation of their duty? when he that is the judge of quick and dead &s;hall ap|pear in judgment, to render to every man according to his works!

<P>I am convinced that the LORD is at work among&s;t the ri&s;ing generation; many of whom &s;tand convicted in their own minds, of the want of &s;piritual health; and are imploring the mercy of the GOD of their &s;al|vation.</P>

In order to your attaining it, let me call upon you again, the pre&s;ent ri&s;ing generation; who&s;e &s;tations in life may be likely to have &s;ome little continuance; be ever &s;tedfa&s;t in the performance of your religious duties, that you may become heirs of the kingdom; and have your portion, with the children of GOD.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me of the greate&s;t importance, in relati|on to the various affairs of life, to form aright the minds of youth; and therefore, I once more entreat every pa|rent pre&s;ent, that you watch over, and carefully nouri&s;h every &s;eed of virtue &s;pringing up in the minds of your children, for the &s;ake of their, and of your own, tem|poral welfare; as well as for the hope and a&s;&s;urance of both their, and your own, eternal happine&s;s.</P>

<P>In this city he hath laid his hand upon one, and upon another.

I believe it may be &s;aid concerning &s;ome among you, as was &s;aid formerly to CHRIST; <HI>Lord, he whom thou love&s;t is &s;ick.</HI> The decay of health in many, has been owing to foul feeding; to their daily feeding upon the &s;pirit, maxims and manners of the world, upon exteri|or appearances, upon comparative righteou&s;ne&s;s, upon a compari&s;on of their pre&s;ent, with their former &s;tate; who&s;e minds are relaxed with the love and &s;pirit of va|nity. Some have relaxed into evil, and are now be|come too much unacquainted with GOD and his law; which, to holine&s;s, and to <HI>that</HI> only, annexes happi|ne&s;s. Many of the&s;e might have gone on from one degree of &s;trength to another; had they not too much regarded the things of time, and fed too greedily up|on the temptations and plea&s;ures of this Life; not enough con&s;idering, that the di&s;ea&s;es and di&s;orders of the mind thus fed, mu&s;t certainly at la&s;t bring death, even the <HI>death,</HI> tho' not <HI>di&s;&s;olution,</HI> of the &s;oul.

<P>I be&s;eech you, continue in your love to the go&s;|pel of CHRIST: that, day after day, you may feed on the holy &s;acrifice, and on that eternal fruit with which he nouri&s;hes the &s;oul that <HI>hungers and thir&s;ts after righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And, I cannot help, while I am &s;peak|ing, pre&s;&s;ing you in a more immediate manner, if po&s;|&s;ible, that, not relying on your own wi&s;dom, and your own &s;trength, but in a full dependance and leaning up|on the brea&s;t of the beloved JESUS, you all, patiently, with a holy &s;oundne&s;s, proceed in <HI>the highway to the city of God;</HI> that you may be crowned at la&s;t with glory, honour, and immortality!</P>

<P>We behold him, in his agonies on Calvary Mount, offering him&s;elf as a &s;acrifice for the &s;ins of the whole world; that he might purify us, by the &s;hedding of his precious blood! <HI>more precious than the blood of goats and lambs;</HI> or any other that was &s;hed under the law.

<P>I know we have been &s;tigmatized, as di&s;believing the truths of the Chri&s;tian religion.

<P>I am fully convinced were the Chri&s;tian world in ge|neral to leave out exterior ceremonies, and enter more into this inward meditation, their minds would be more largely repleni&s;hed with divine fruits; and tho&s;e who are entering as it were upon the wilderne&s;s of this world, would then partake of the advantage. O! that we might all live in the beauty of holine&s;s!</P>
<P><HI>My heart was hot within me; then &s;pake I with my tongue!</HI>&mdash;A nece&s;&s;ary preparation for a preacher! Abel's offering, on account of &s;uch a preparation, was <HI>more acceptable to God than his brother's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then &s;pake I with my tongue.</HI>&mdash;O! ri&s;ing genera|tion, what you &s;peak with your tongues, let it be from the &s;ame good &s;ource of hearts divinely prepared; &s;ince on the other hand for every <HI>idle word</HI> that men &s;peak, they mu&s;t <HI>give an account in the day of judgment.</HI> As you often &s;peak with your tongues, fervently de&s;ire that the &s;acred faculties of the mind may be fitted for divine meditations, and the tongue to publi&s;h for the honour of GOD and benefit of others, what you have been taught by him: &s;o will you never admit or utter any thing con|trary to the divinity of CHRIST JESUS your LORD.</P>
<P><HI>Lord, let me know mine end!</HI> O that this &s;ound may dwell upon your minds, who are the hope of the next generation! upon whom the weighty tru&s;t and care of the cau&s;e of GOD mu&s;t, in a little time, nece&s;&s;arily devolve; that you may come to the knowledge of the <HI>mea&s;ure of your days.</HI> I think, without violence to the text, you may learn from it that you are de&s;tined for immortality: but the love of worldly things is too apt to engage the attention of that immortal part, the
<PB N="43" REF="016777_0042_0F9E2F0A57F16500">&s;oul; which occa&s;ions, too many, the want of their know|ing the great and glorious end for which they were formed, <HI>a little lower than the angels,</HI> and intended to be <HI>crowned with glory and honour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lord! let me know my end and the mea&s;ure of my days!</HI></P>
<P>I tremble methinks upon the brink of eternity! and &s;o, with a little proper reflection, you might &s;ay all; the aged, the middle aged, and the youth.&mdash;The end of all things is at hand: flatter not your&s;elves therefore with length of days, and a long pro&s;perity of worldly po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions; &s;uffer me to be&s;eech you for the &s;ake of your immortal &s;ouls.</P>
<P><HI>What do I owe to my God?&mdash;What do I not owe him?</HI>&mdash;He hath &s;natched me as a brand out of the fire; and I would not, tho' to gain the world, tread back again in the path of folly.</P>
<P>I know it by experience, and therefore I would per|&s;uade you, not to turn a&s;ide from the GOD of your &s;al|vation; but to acknowledge the infinite debt you owe him, and to pay him daily with obedience, adoration and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Our &s;ins have been great, and our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions <HI>ne|ver</HI> could have been obliterated, had not CHRIST done it for us; let us therefore no longer dwell upon the <HI>rock</HI> of <HI>pre&s;umption</HI> with <HI>Satan,</HI> who hath been a lyar from the beginning; but let us rather <HI>de&s;cend</HI> into the <HI>valley</HI> of <HI>humility and peace,</HI> and <HI>&s;ettle accounts</HI> with the GOD of our <HI>lives,</HI> from whom I had &s;trayed to that degree that my life became a burden to me, and I have wi&s;hed that I had never been born; but CHRIST, who was <HI>a friend to publicans and &s;inners,</HI> is now become <HI>the rock of my &s;alvation!</HI> he hath cau&s;ed me to tru&s;t in him, and to &s;eek the LORD my GOD. The debt I owe is
<PB N="44" REF="016777_0043_0F9E2F0B7121F120">infinite, I de&s;ire ever to acknowledge it with all po&s;&s;ible gratitude; and to do my utmo&s;t towards the di&s;charge of it, while I have my being.</P>
<P>If there is a &s;oul within the audience of my voice which (upon this awful query) <HI>How much owe&s;t thou unto my Lord?</HI> is ready to apprehend, that it owes too much ever to hope for a di&s;charge, or freedom from the heavy load of debt it has contracted; I have a little to &s;ay to &s;uch, even from my own experience: thy tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions do not exceed the bounds of his mercy; he &s;till careth for thee, with an inexpre&s;&s;ible fatherly care and tenderne&s;s. Even when his afflictions are upon thee they are intended for thy good. <HI>The brui&s;ed reed he will not break, the &s;meaking flax he will not quench.</HI> The more any of you &s;ee your real &s;tate, the more you remember the favours you have received, and feel the burthen of your inju&s;tice and ingratitude; the more readily will he meet the penitent di&s;po&s;ition of your minds.</P>
<P>I have no manner of doubt but he, <HI>who&s;e work is &s;alvation,</HI> who <HI>came into the world</HI> purely and purpo&s;e|ly <HI>to &s;ave &s;inners,</HI> will carry on his own work, and, as you wholly re&s;ign your&s;elves to his forming hand, will purify your hearts, reconcile you to the Father, and make you everla&s;ting in&s;tances and monuments of his Infinite mercy. Li&s;t up therefore thy head in hope, whoever thou art, in this humbled penitent &s;tate; for <HI>thy &s;alvation draws nigh.</HI> Thou owe&s;t abundance to thy LORD; and there is an abundance which thou can&s;t ne|ver pay: but there is the good <HI>Samaritan,</HI> ever ready to do for thee, as for him, who going from <HI>Jeru&s;alem to Jericho, fell among robbers;</HI> by whom he was wounded; <HI>and</HI> to &s;ay, <HI>take care of him, and I will pay.</HI> There is a glorious &s;ound from the great and good <HI>friend</HI> of <HI>publicans</HI> and <HI>&s;inners;</HI> he is ready to &s;ay to thee who art in this penitent &s;tate before him,
<PB N="45" REF="016777_0044_0F9E2F0CDBA98B00"><HI>Take thy bill and write down fifty.</HI> He will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. xliv. 22.</NOTE> <HI>blot out thy &s;ins as a cloud, and thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions as a thick cloud.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but remember with renewed feeling, and warm emotion of heart, the day that anxiety (in the view of my condition) &s;eized me; and how his mercy relieved me from it. He made my &s;oul feel his com|pa&s;&s;ion, and in the depth of gratitude thankfully to a|dore him. And hence I often feel a tenderne&s;s of mind toward tho&s;e who are weary of vanity, and heavy la|den with a &s;en&s;e of their manifold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. I be&s;eech &s;uch, by the mercy of GOD, that they would fly to him in their angui&s;h of mind; for it is he, and he alone that can &s;peak peace to the &s;inner: tho' your unrighteou&s;ne&s;s may be great, it is not in any degree of proportion, to his infinite mercy! Again, &s;uch a|mong you to whom I have &s;poke, who delight to dwell in the path of temptation, wherein you have too long continued; I warn you to con&s;ider, that you are in the road to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I would not give up, like E&s;au,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>my birth-right</HI> to &s;eek <HI>a place of repentance with tears, and not to find it.</HI> O my &s;oul! for ever acknowledge how much thou owe&s;t unto thy LORD! Let none &s;ay <Q>he hath ble&s;&s;ed me variou&s;ly, and in &s;ome future time I will awake my &s;oul to gratitude, I have now &s;omething el&s;e to do;</Q> like him who, when an apo&s;tle<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 25.</NOTE> rea&s;oned <HI>of righteou&s;ne&s;s, temperance and judgment to come,</HI> replied <HI>go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient &s;ea&s;on I will call for thee.</HI></P>
<P>The like di&s;po&s;ition continues to prevail in too many: and this &s;eems to be the language of their hearts, <Q>Go thy way this time; call upon me when I have lived
<PB N="46" REF="016777_0045_0F9E2F0D918820F0">to my&s;elf, and an&s;wered my own purpo&s;es a little longer; vi&s;it me at &s;ome di&s;tant time hence.</Q> Oh! rather <HI>to-day, while it is called to-day,&mdash;Harden not thy heart:</HI> do not defer thy repentance a moment; thou knowe&s;t not what <HI>a moment may produce.</HI> Con&s;ider thy repeated tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; thy multiplied offences a|gain&s;t GOD: heap not up <HI>wrath again&s;t the day of wrath:</HI> &s;well not the dreadful account. Thou ha&s;t hitherto trampled upon the goodne&s;s and the mercies of the GOD that made thee; venture not on pre&s;umption and delay. Time is uncertain: Immortality is at hand.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you therefore my friends at the pre&s;ent time, that you will lay to heart the nece&s;&s;ity of your making up this great account: delay it not to the de|cline of life. Many are on the brink of the grave! reflect upon your extreme danger! think not of crowd|ing the account of your repentance into your la&s;t hour of life! You will find it extremely difficult to labour under the infirmities of the body, upon a death-bed, without a rea&s;onable ground of hope: all the offers of mercy having been long continued, and often repeated; yet by you as long &s;lighted, and as often rejected; what then will di&s;charge you from that dreadful account! I wi&s;h it may never be the ca&s;e of any within the audience of my voice. Let us all immediately ponder, rightly con&s;ider, and &s;eriou&s;ly improve this con&s;ideration, <HI>How much owe&s;t thou unto my Lord?</HI></P>

<HEAD>A <HI>PRAYER</HI> upon <HI>May</HI> the 19th, which concluded the afternoon &s;ervice of that day, at the <HI>Fryer's</HI> Meeting.</HEAD>
<P>WITH un&s;peakable reverence we pre&s;ume to approach thy pre&s;ence, O Father! who art in heaven and, with the voice of thank&s;|giving and holy prai&s;e, to offer the tribute, that is due to Thee alone!</P>
<P>In a commemoration of thy mercy, thy infinite mer|cy! we are awfully bowed before thee, as at thy &s;acred foot-&s;tool; in the deepe&s;t reverence and thankfulne&s;s, for the &s;tretching forth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxiii. 4.</NOTE> <HI>of the rod and the &s;taff,</HI> which thou ha&s;t been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s, as the means of our furtherance in the way of life and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Though humbled in du&s;t, in the &s;en&s;e of our un|worthine&s;s, we are, neverthele&s;s, encouraged to breathe unto Thee; to make mention of thy name, with joy of heart: we adore that goodne&s;s, which hath put it into our hearts to &s;eek, &s;erve and fear Thee; and to turn to the place where<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 13.</NOTE> <HI>prayer is wont to be made.</HI></P>
<P>Thou ha&s;t loved us before we loved Thee: thy love, O LORD! hath not been after the manner of men: Thou ha&s;t called us, when we were enemies; and ha&s;t reconciled tran&s;gre&s;&s;iors to thy&s;elf. Thou ha&s;t followed us in the day of our revolting; and, when we were &s;traying in the wilderne&s;s, as a mo&s;t gracious and tender &s;hepherd Thou did&s;t lay thy hand on us, not only with judgment, but with mercy; and ha&s;t
<PB N="48" REF="016777_0047_0F9E2F0F33424C98">brought us home again unto thy flock, and thy fold, and forgiven us our multiplied tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Our deviations from thy holy path have not been puni&s;hed with inexorable ju&s;tice; but thy conduct to|ward us has been cloathed with un&s;peakable compa&s;&s;ion. O! Thou everla&s;ting &s;hepherd, and bi&s;hop of our &s;ouls! who ha&s;t looked upon us, when weltering as in our blood, and by thy divine power ha&s;t healed us.

O! adorable conde&s;cen&s;ion! We have no language to expre&s;s thy mercy, and the boundle&s;s obligations we lie under to thy Maje&s;ty! who ha&s;t thus, in the times of un&s;peaka|ble anxiety, vouch&s;afed to appear for us: and even when we have wandered from the coun&s;el of thy will, and trod in the path of the wicked,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xliii. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Thou &s;ente&s;t forth thy light and thy truth, and did&s;t lead us back to thy holy hill.</HI></P>

<P>To thee we owe all our faculties, and all that is with|in us; and let them all, we pray Thee, be con&s;ecrated to thy honour: we be&s;eech that all our &s;teps may be directed to Thee; and more and more to thy &s;ervice. For, Father of infinite kindne&s;s! it hath plea&s;ed Thee

<P>Oh thou that art fairer than the &s;ons of men! grace flows from thy lips; Thou beholde&s;t us when tempted, and &s;peaks to our &s;tates with all the language of ten|derne&s;s, Father of mercy! grant that innumerable multitudes may re&s;ort to thy temple, that &s;acred hou&s;e, which thou ha&s;t erected to thy honour and &s;ervice.

<HEAD>The following SERMON was delivered at the Fryers Meeting in Bri&s;tol, on Friday the 22d Day of May, <HI>1767.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HAVE frequently thought, and the &s;entiment hath been confirmed from my own ob&s;ervation and expe|rience, that a great and excellent point would be gained, highly conducive to the advantage of mankind, did they generally, tho' from no &s;urer guide than tradi|tion, &s;ub&s;cribe with heart and mind, to that certain truth, recorded in holy writ;</P>
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lviii. 11.</NOTE> Verily, there is a reward for the righteous: Verily he is a God, that judgeth in the earth;</Q>
<P>As &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion, from whatever ground it ari&s;es, naturally tends to influence the conduct, to avoid evil, and to pur&s;ue that which is good; and with regard to many, it hath proved a &s;tep to their nearer acquaintance with GOD, who is the only &s;ure guide to true happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Indeed I &s;carce think there can be many, if there be any, who are hardy enough to deny the exi&s;tence of the &s;upreme Being; but believe on the contrary, that many, through the divine favour enlightened to &s;ee their duty, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to di&s;charge it; do, in con&s;equence of the&s;e favours, contemplate, with &s;atisfaction inexpre&s;&s;ible, the&s;e attributes of the mo&s;t high GOD, here mentioned by the P&s;almi&s;t: and could I be induced to think, that any part of mankind had &s;werved from their duty, for want of a firm conviction of tho&s;e his attributes, as re|lative
<PB N="56" REF="016777_0054_0F9E2F16943C11A8">to his creatures; and of the certainty, that there is really a GOD who judgeth the earth: I &s;ay, could I believe their minds were de&s;titute of this animating and enlivening pro&s;pect of his power, omni&s;cience, and goodne&s;s, in his &s;uperintendant care, and pre&s;ent judg|ing the earth, I &s;hould deem &s;uch but a very little re|moved, if any, from the &s;tate of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> upon who&s;e altars the holy apo&s;tle di&s;covered an in&s;cription,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 23.</NOTE> <Q>"To the unknown God."</Q> Indeed a language that was &s;poken formerly hath been too much adopted by &s;ucceeding generations; numbers of whom have been like tho&s;e men of Jeru&s;alem, who &s;aid,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Zeph. i. 12.</NOTE> <HI>the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</HI> Many (&s;educed by the grand deceiver and his agents) have endeavoured to e&s;trange and withdraw them&s;elves from the arbitrator of the whole earth: they have hence grown dark in their imaginations, and in like manner thus rea&s;oned with them&s;elves, <Q>He will do us no good, why therefore &s;hould we &s;eek him? he will do us no harm; why &s;hould we fear him?</Q> This, we may ju&s;tly look upon, as the mo&s;t unhappy &s;eduction of mind! as it mi&s;leads to the utmo&s;t di&s;tance, (without timely recovery) from that &s;tate of obedience, in which we are only capable of happine&s;s, through the favourable notice of our father who is in heaven.</P>
<P>But we may ju&s;tly conclude, that &s;uch impiety pa&s;&s;ed not the attention of an all-&s;eeing GOD, in as much as he replied, <Q>I will puni&s;h tho&s;e men of Jeru&s;alem, who have &s;aid, The Lord doeth us no good, why &s;hould we &s;eek him? he will not do us any harm, why &s;hould we fear him?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="016777_0055_0F9E2F174BE03110">

Many of the hone&s;t and &s;incere of eve|ry Nation under Heaven, have formed different ideas of the requi&s;ites to &s;alvation, and of cour&s;e have pur&s;ued as different mea&s;ures to accompli&s;h that de&s;irable end. It is not my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, to particularize any of tho&s;e various &s;y&s;tems of Faith, which are adopted by any par|ty among&s;t mankind; it is not to controvert matters, in which &s;incere men of the various denominations mo&s;t &s;urely believe; but rather to recommend them always to &s;tand open to conviction, and a &s;trict attention to tho&s;e rules of conduct, which appear to them mo&s;t agreea|ble to the will of Heaven. I &s;hall therefore addre&s;s my|&s;elf to tho&s;e, in whatever religious &s;ociety they are found, who&s;e hone&s;t inquiries have not yet been attend|ed with &s;ufficient conviction, or led them clearly to per|ceive what are the terms on which their future hap|pine&s;s depends, and who are therefore looking one upon another, whil&s;t this important que&s;tion is found, at lea&s;t in their hearts if not in their mouths <Q>Men and Bre|thren what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall not pre&s;ume arrogantly to dictate to any re&s;pect|ing matters of &s;o important a concern as that of the &s;alva|tion of the Soul; every Man &s;hould exerci&s;e tho&s;e talents with which the Father of lights has endued him, in a clo&s;e and &s;incere attention to the voice of the internal Teacher, and in the di&s;covery of tho&s;e truths both prac|tical and &s;peculative which have an immediate relation to the happine&s;s of a Being circum&s;tanced as he is. I &s;hall &s;imply propo&s;e tho&s;e things which from my own expe|rience as an individual appear to me worthy of God for their Author, and worthy of Man's mo&s;t &s;erious atten|tion. It is an indi&s;putable truth that we made not our|&s;elves: <Q>We are thine offspring, thou ha&s;t made us and not we our&s;elves,</Q> &s;ays the prophet in his appeal to God. The matter which forms the univer&s;e, the vehicles which
<PB N="121" REF="016777_0118_0F9E2F61905DAE98">the &s;oul informs, and the intellectual powers and facul|ties we po&s;&s;e&s;s, derived their being from the eternal fountain of all power and intelligence, whom we cha|racterize by the awful names of Jah, Jehovah and God. It is al&s;o clear to me that we were brought into exi&s;tence with the benevolent de&s;ign of finally &s;u&s;taining the con|fluent dignities of Glory, Honour, Immortality and eter|nal Life; the Lord Almighty hath in un&s;peakable mercy promi&s;ed, that after we have endured a &s;ea&s;on of proba|tion on earth, a conflict with our pa&s;&s;ions excited by numerous cau&s;es, and a fight of afflictions, we &s;hould finally receive a glorious reward, a perpetuity of un|mixed felicity in the unknown regions of eternity. But this de&s;irable and excellent end is not to be effected by what is generally called fate, the laws of nece&s;&s;ity, or the arbitrary will and power of the Author of our exi&s;tence. God has con&s;tituted us free and intelligent beings, and endued us with faculties capable of apprehending and practi&s;ing tho&s;e duties which he makes the condition of our final acceptance with him: he offers, but does not impo&s;e, happine&s;s on his creatures; he &s;hows us the &s;pi|ritual Canaan, he gives us power to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, but does not compel us to enter into it; good and evil are clearly &s;et before us, but our election is not con&s;trained to either; the &s;overeign of the univer&s;e is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, for of one blood he made all nations that dwell on the face of the earth; they &s;tand in the &s;ame relation to the univer&s;al Father, Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of Souls, who tenderly invites the whole race of Mankind to in|herit the Joy of his Salvation. To this doctrine the ho|ly Apo&s;tle bore an ample and explicit te&s;timony: <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 34, 35.</NOTE> Of a truth, &s;aid he, I perceive that God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, but in every nation tho&s;e who fear him and work righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be accepted of him."&mdash;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Romans viii. 13.</NOTE>"If ye live after the fle&s;h ye &s;hall die, but if through the

<P>All this indeed may be acknowledged both by tho&s;e within and without the audience of my voice, who are yet in doubt what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation; they want to be informed of the preci&s;e ideas that &s;hould be affixed to the conditions contained in the text, though perhaps they readily ap|prehend the terms life and death imply future happine&s;s and mi&s;ery. I &s;hall therefore attempt according to the ability I am endued with, to give you my thoughts on the important &s;ubject in que&s;tion at this time. To "live after the fle&s;h" is to live in the gratification of our animal appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, beyond the bounds of rea&s;on, temperance and &s;obriety, which as it frequently introduces numerous di&s;orders into the animal &s;y&s;tem, and aggravates the infirmities to which the&s;e corruptible bodies are incident, &s;o it affects the good of &s;ociety, and renders unfit for tho&s;e contemplations and that felicity which is adapted to the dignity of rational and immortal &s;pirits, beings whom God in his wi&s;dom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 7.</NOTE> <HI>has made a little</HI> (and perhaps but a little) <HI>lower than the Angels,</HI> and who would crown them with a &s;uperior glory, honour and happine&s;s than that which animal gratifications can con|fer on their deluded votaries. Whil&s;t we are in the body we mu&s;t expect to find tho&s;e appetites, affections and pa&s;|&s;ions which belong to our nature; but the&s;e are to be re&s;tricted within the bounds of virtue, and attended to in proportion to our exigencies and nece&s;&s;ities, of which the divine principle which God has graciou&s;ly implanted in our hearts ought to determine.</P>

This principle of intelligence although called by a variety of names in the different profe&s;&s;ions among&s;t Men, is the &s;ame in nature throughout all Mankind. It is the &s;pirit in Man that giveth a right under&s;tanding; it is the light that more or le&s;s enlightens every Man; it is the word of God in the heart; the word of faith which the Apo&s;tle preached to the Gentiles; it is the Grace that hath appeared to all Men, teaching them to deny ungodline&s;s and the world's lu&s;ts, and to live &s;o|berly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world; and finally it is the &s;upreme rea&s;on, the law of truth and rec|titude, the te&s;t of virtue and vice, which God him&s;elf hath erected in the hearts of all Men; and happy are tho&s;e who hear and obey it in all things.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood to mean that this principle of which I am &s;peaking is de&s;igned to in&s;truct us in all truths which the human mind may attempt to inve&s;ti|gate, or to give a clear in&s;ight into tho&s;e numerous &s;pe|culative &s;ubjects, which have, not only unprofitably em|ployed mankind and diverted their attention from more &s;ub&s;tantial objects, but which have perplexed and divid|ed them from generation to generation; but by the exerci&s;e of it we may apprehend tho&s;e truths that belong to us, and have an e&s;&s;ential relation to the important end of our exi&s;tence; of which truths the Father of &s;pirits has enabled us to judge; this is implyed by the que&s;tion which our Lord him&s;elf propo&s;ed to a people mi&s;led by the traditions of their fathers, and who had taken for doctrine the commandments of men, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 57.</NOTE> yea and why judge ye not for your&s;elves, what is right?</Q></P>
<P>Various are our obligations and duties, religious, rela|tive and &s;ocial, ari&s;ing from our various connexions, natural and divine: The relation we &s;tand in to the Au|thor
<PB N="124" REF="016777_0121_0F9E2F5D8F6471E8">of our being is that of Children; filial fear, obedi|ence and wor&s;hip is therefore our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to him, in our conduct at all times, throughout our whole lives. The relation which our fellow creatures &s;tand in to us, is that of brethren, children of the &s;ame univer&s;al Father, and formed for the &s;ame glorious and happy end; ju&s;tice, charity and brotherly kindne&s;s are there|fore our indi&s;pen&s;ible obligations unto mankind. There are al&s;o various accidental relations, &s;uch as father, governor, ma&s;ter, &s;ervant and numerous others, all which have their corre&s;pondent duties. Thus far per|haps the per&s;ons whom I immediately addre&s;s at this time may concur with me in &s;entiment, but they as well as I, are perhaps con&s;cious of having failed in nume|rous in&s;tances of di&s;charging their religious duties to God and their &s;ocial duties to mankind. We have all &s;inned and fallen &s;hort of the glory of God! we have multiplied our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions without number! and our iniquities ri&s;e before us as a thick cloud! which ob&s;cures the brightne&s;s of that eternal Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which would otherwi&s;e illuminate our under&s;tandings with its marvellous light.

"Men and Brethren what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?" The condition of our recon|ciliation and redemption are very clearly expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;acred oracles of truth; the placability of the divine nature is repeatedly a&s;&s;erted; he is repre&s;ented to us in the adorable character of a God of mercy, long &s;uffer|ing and of un&s;peakable kindne&s;s; as a Being ready to blot out our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions from the cele&s;tial regi&s;ter, on our &s;incere repentance, and to remember them no more.</P>

This important and intere&s;ting doctrine was typified under the Law, &s;poken of by the Prophets, and glori|ou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted by the Son of God, who is our Mediator with the Father, and the hope of our future Glory. In his character was di&s;played to Mankind, in the mo&s;t eminent and &s;triking manner, the provident care, mercy and goodne&s;s of God toward the whole rational creati|on; who like &s;heep have gone a&s;tray from the univer&s;al &s;hepherd and bi&s;hop of Souls, who have widely wan|dered from the paths of purity and holine&s;s, which are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s and peace; that path of the ju&s;t Man, which (like the luminous orb as it ari&s;es in our hemi&s;phere) &s;hines with increa&s;ing refulgency, &s;plendor and brightne&s;s, till it arrives at the meridian altitude of a gloriou&s;ly perfect day! This path leads all who &s;teadily pur&s;ue its direction, by degrees of experi|ence, through the wilderne&s;s of this world to the grand and ultimate end of our Creation, to that compleat frui|tion of bli&s;s that is figuratively repre&s;ented to us by <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 10.</NOTE> a City that hath foundations, who&s;e builder and ma|ker God is;" a City "<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah lx. 18.</NOTE> who&s;e Walls are &s;alvation, and who&s;e Gates are eternal prai&s;e;</Q> a City that hath no need of the elementary light of Sun, Moon and Stars, "<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi. 23.</NOTE> for the Lord God and the Lamb are the light there|of" a City where God reigns triumphantly among&s;t his &s;aints, and is to them an inexhau&s;tible fountain of light and felicity; there the weary pilgrim finds an end of all his anxiety and labour, and receives the reward of his faith, the fruition of his hopes, even the &s;alvation of his Soul.</P>
<P>The important me&s;&s;age which Chri&s;t had in commi&s;|&s;ion from his Father and our Father, from his God and our God, was, that he compa&s;&s;ionated his Creatures, encompa&s;&s;ed with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which their &s;ins had
<PB N="126" REF="016777_0123_0F9E2F65D1A5D668">brought upon them, that he willed not their everla&s;ting &s;eparation from him the &s;ource of happine&s;s, that he was willing they &s;hould be reconciled to him; he there|fore called upon them to <HI>Repent and be converted that their &s;ins might be forgiven them, and that they might finally enter into his re&s;t.</HI> This was the intere&s;ting doc|trine which the Saviour of Man promulgated, and hap|py are tho&s;e who hear and obey it. <Q>Repent and be converted that your &s;ins may be forgiven you.</Q> It is not the a&s;&s;ent of the lip and of the tongue to the glorious truths of the Go&s;pel; but a &s;urrender of the will and affections, a renovation of heart, and conform|ity to the divine Image, which can alone gain us admi&s;|&s;ion into the New Jeru&s;alem, the City of God.</P>
<P>If we take an impartial &s;urvey of our pa&s;t lives, re|view our frequent revoltings, and compare our conduct with the convictions we have often received of right and wrong, virtue and vice, there is &s;carcely a Soul pre&s;ent but mu&s;t feel &s;ome degree of remor&s;e, &s;ome de|gree of repentance for the turpitude of his morals, and his want of love, obedience and gratitude to &s;o gracious a Father, who has encompa&s;&s;ed us with ble&s;&s;ings, and pre&s;erved us by his providence from the earlie&s;t period of our lives to the pre&s;ent hour; we mu&s;t (I &s;ay again) upon &s;erious retro&s;pection, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome degree of re|pentance; but unhappily for us the impre&s;&s;ions that are made on our minds by &s;uch a review of our actions, are frequently era&s;ed by the influence which a variety of creaturely objects are &s;uffered to have upon us, and like the early dew they &s;oon pa&s;s away. Tho&s;e who have been clean&s;ed in &s;ome degree by the water of con|trition, are often defiled again by the repetition of that iniquity which in the moments of their humilia|tion they had determined to renounce and for&s;ake, they are again caught in the &s;nare of their lu&s;ts, and capti|vated by tho&s;e objects which have a tendency to alienate

Thus when the force of conviction again &s;ounds the awakening alarm, they are ready to query with &s;urpri&s;e and anx|iety <Q>what is to be done in this afflictive dilemma to which our incon&s;tancy to our virtuous re&s;olutions has reduced us? &s;hall we de&s;pair of that divine mercy we have &s;o often abu&s;ed, of that goodne&s;s we have &s;o long trifled with?</Q> God forbid! rather pro&s;trate your Souls at the Throne of Grace, and humbly im|plore the continued mercy of the univer&s;al parent, as a Father pitieth his Children, &s;o he pitieth them that fear him; he knoweth our frame, he remembereth that we are but du&s;t; be&s;eech him therefore to &s;end forth help from his holy &s;anctuary, that you may be &s;trength|ned to renew and keep your Covenants with him; re|frain from the Commi&s;&s;ion of evil, and wait on him in the &s;ilence of all fle&s;h; &s;ince it hath plea&s;ed him again to enlighten your darkne&s;s, and thus to give you to &s;ee your&s;elves as you are &s;een of him; he may al&s;o be plea&s;|ed to enflame your hearts with that cele&s;tial fire which purgeth away all the intellectual filth and dro&s;s, that prevents the a&s;cent of the Soul godward, and renders it an unfit habitation for his holine&s;s to dwell in.

<P>A SOLEMN &s;ummons which the Almighty gave through his Prophet Joel, to a People whom he had known above all the families of the Earth, (at a time when they had revolted and departed in Heart from him) has been revived in my mind; with an ap|prehen&s;ion that the &s;ame authority requires the repub|lication of it in this day, to a People likewi&s;e highly favoured of him; and who have in like manner depart|ed from their fir&s;t love.</P>

<P>I am of opinion re&s;pecting many of our Youth, that if they had been properly in&s;tructed, and carefully watched over, if they could have &s;een the beauty of Holine&s;s &s;hine in the example of their Parents, they would not have gone out &s;o widely as they have. Oh! you Parents of both &s;exes, an important tru&s;t is repo&s;|ed in you; example your Children in the practice of Piety; example &s;peaks louder, much louder, than pre|cept; its influence is far more exten&s;ive. And while on the one hand you are excited to a faithful di&s;charge of your duty towards them, by the certain hope of a glorious reward; &s;o on the other hand, the powerful ties of natural affection, the warm &s;olicitude for the happine&s;s of tho&s;e you love, mu&s;t &s;tir up to diligence in the work and &s;ervice appointed you.</P>
<P>"Gather the Children." If after your attentive care has been employed, for their pre&s;ervation; if after by the forceable voice of example, you have called them to the perfecting of holine&s;s in the fear of God, they <HI>will</HI> go, they <HI>will</HI> turn a&s;ide into the byways and crook|ed paths of &s;in and iniquity, they mu&s;t &s;tand by their own choice; you have redeemed your Souls, and will be found in your lots at the end of time, a ponderous Crown awaits you, you will clo&s;e your eyes, and open them to the boundle&s;s fruition of unmixt Joy, in a happy eternity.</P>

We do &s;ometimes with &s;orrow ob&s;erve, the unweari|ed labours of a Parent's love, be&s;towed without the de|&s;ired effect; 'tis <HI>mournful</HI> to &s;ee Children pierce with bitterne&s;s and anxiety the brea&s;t that has been their &s;upport in their infantile years; to fill that eye with &s;orrow, that has dropt over them the tear of maternal fondne&s;s! 'tis a cruel thing for a Child to mingle Gall and Wormwood, in the cup of a Parent de&s;cending to the Grave; let us be a&s;&s;ured that their own portion of Gall and Wormwood will be doubly increa&s;ed thereby, in the &s;olemn hour of ju&s;t Retribution! But, Oh belo|ved Youth! I earne&s;tly de&s;ire that you may never thus widely deviate from the paths of rectitude; 'tis on you the hope of the pre&s;ent age mu&s;t &s;hortly devolve; may you wi&s;ely choo&s;e an early &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the holy di&s;|cipline of the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, that you may come up as an Army for God.

We are daily in&s;truct|ed by the powerful eloquent language of Mortality; Death invades all ranks, &s;natches tho&s;e of all ages from the bu&s;y &s;tage of life, &s;he that was ye&s;terday &s;ur|rounded with nuptial Joys, mu&s;t to-morrow be confined within the cold inclo&s;ure of the &s;ilent Grave. <Q>Let the Bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the Bride out of her Clo&s;et;</Q> let the young, the joyous; tho&s;e that are in the bloom of life, leave every thing that tends to retard their progre&s;s towards the City of the Saints &s;olemnity; let them relinqui&s;h their mo&s;t exalted &s;atisfactions, rather than neglect to lay hold on the Joys of God's Salvation; which are unutterably more de&s;irable, than all the &s;in-plea&s;ing gratifications that this World can be&s;tow.</P>
