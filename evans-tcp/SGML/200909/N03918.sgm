<HEAD>A Prefatory Addre&s;s TO THE People of <HI>Nottingham.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOU have been Eye and Ear-Witne&s;&s;es of &s;urprizing &s;piritual Conque&s;ts wrought by the King of <HI>Zion,</HI> thro' the Mini|&s;try of &s;ome de&s;pi&s;ed Servants of Chri&s;t among you. The&s;e &s;upernatural Effects of the Word with you, namely, humbling, renew|ing and reforming of the mo&s;t proud, prejudiced and profligate Sinners in many Places, does plainly prove the Work to be <HI>of God:</HI> For &s;urely any Effect cannot exceed the Vertue of it's producing Cau&s;e. It is an Evidence of awful Blindne&s;s and Prejudice in any to a&s;cribe this Work to <HI>Nature,</HI> or the <HI>Devil;</HI> for a Man may as well make a new World, as renew his own Heart: And to
<PB N="ii" REF="004822_0003_100DF82683909CE8">imagine that the Devil has a Hand in this Work, is to &s;uppo&s;e that he acts contrary to his own Intere&s;t, and that therefore his King|dom is divided again&s;t it &s;elf, and &s;o cannot &s;tand. To a&s;cribe the proper Work of God's Spirit to the Devil by tho&s;e that have been convinced, comes near to the <HI>unpardonable Sin.</HI> This was the Practice of the Phari&s;ees who liv'd in the Time of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles; the&s;e Men notwith&s;tanding of their &s;trict Form of Religion, were the mo&s;t implacable Oppo&s;ers of Chri&s;t and his Followers, altho' they had the cleare&s;t Evidence of the Divi|nity of Chri&s;t's Doctrine and Mi&s;&s;ion; yet thro' the Prejudice of their natural Enmity, together with their Fear of lo&s;ing their Ho|nour and worldly Intere&s;t, they &s;et them|&s;elves to oppo&s;e the &s;preading Power of God|line&s;s by blackening the Character of the In|&s;truments whereby it was promoted, that &s;o they might prejudice the People again&s;t them, and thus hinder the Succe&s;s of their Labours. In particular, they repre&s;ented them as di&s;|orderly Per&s;ons and Di&s;turbers of the publick Peace, becau&s;e they were not careful enough to ob&s;erve the Traditions of the Fathers, and on the Account of the Divi&s;ions and Di&s;tur|bances that attended their Labours in divers Places. Certainly, it mu&s;t be acknowledg|ed that Church Rules do not bind when they hinder the Edification of the Body, for which
<PB N="iii" REF="004822_0004_100DF82892502FC8">they are &s;uppos'd to be made. And is it not rea&s;onable to conclude that Rules which may be proper in ordinary Ca&s;es, may be hurtful in extraordinary; and therefore may there not be a Su&s;pen&s;ion of &s;ome Rules for a Time when the Church is in an extraor|dinary Situation, without the overthrow of Di&s;cipline. Do not general Rules admit of Exceptions; and do not the Formers of Church Rules acknowledge them to be alterable ac|cording to various Circum&s;tances? Now to be more zealous about the Ob&s;ervation of &s;ome Rules, than for the &s;preading Power of God|line&s;s, does it not look like the Phari&s;ees tything Mint and Annis and Cummin, while in the mean Time they neglected the weigh|tier Matters of the Law?</P>
<P>As to Di&s;turbances &amp; Divi&s;ions which na|tural Men are &s;o much afraid of, our Lord has warn'd us not to think that he came to &s;end Peace on Earth, but Fire and Divi&s;ion. It is not to be wonder'd at that the Seed of the Serpent &s;hould ri&s;e up and oppo&s;e the Seed of the Woman, when the Kingdom of the Devil is &s;haken; for thereby their fal&s;e Peace is di&s;turb'd, and their Ma&s;ter is enrag'd, who will doubtle&s;s influence his Servants to con|tend for him. <HI>Contentions</HI> and <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> even <HI>among Relations</HI> is no other than what our Lord foretold would be the Con&s;equence of the powerful preaching of his Go&s;pel.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="004822_0005_100DF82AB3D3C2E0">
<HI>My dear Friends,</HI> My earne&s;t Entreaty to you is, that you would &s;ubmit to the Go|vernment of <HI>Zion</HI>'s King, and depend upon his Power and Promi&s;e that he will, maugre all Oppo&s;ition of Men and Devils, promote and maintain the Intere&s;ts of his Kingdom.

<P>_<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">N the preceding Ver&s;es we have an Account of a cruel Combination formed again&s;t Chri&s;t and his Cau&s;e by the Grandees of the Earth. <HI>Kings and Rulers take Council together, and &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the Lord and his Anointed, &s;aying,</HI> &amp;c. Great Men, alas, are &s;eldom Good. But the Fol|ly and Danger of this impious Attempt is
<PB N="2" REF="004822_0007_100DF830630E9048">ju&s;tly expos'd in the 4th and 5th Ver&s;es of this P&s;alm; where we are told that the great Sovereign of the Univer&s;e who re&s;ts and reigns in Heaven, derides their vain At|tempts, which can no more di&s;turb his Peace controul his Power, or de&s;troy his Intere&s;t, than the Waves of the Ocean the firm Rocks they da&s;h them&s;elves again&s;t. But tho' their deep Devices and effronted Efforts &s;hall be &s;urely rendered ineffectual as to him again&s;t whom they are directed, yet they will be ruining to them&s;elves; for the righteous God &s;hall &s;peak to them in his Wrath and vex them in his &s;ore Di&s;plea&s;ure. And further to encrea&s;e the Terror of <HI>Zion</HI>'s Enemies, and revive the Hearts of her true Friends, our Text opens to our view, a &s;olemn De&s;crip|tion of the Inve&s;titure of the Son of God in|to his Kingly Office.&mdash;Here let us con|&s;ider the following Particulars,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Per&s;on inve&s;ting. I;</HI> viz. God the <HI>Father,</HI> as appears from the 7th <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> where he &s;peaks concerning his <HI>Son.</HI> Here the Word <HI>I</HI> is taken oppo&s;itely, as if the Lord had &s;aid, Altho' the Kings of the Earth extol them|&s;elves, yet I have anointed my King, who &s;hall confound their Devi&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Per&s;on <HI>inve&s;ted,</HI> viz. The <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t: This appears evidently from many Pa&s;&s;ages of this P&s;alm: For in it, fir&s;t He is called expre&s;ly the <HI>Son of God,</HI> which Character belongs to Chri&s;t alone, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.
<PB REF="004822_0008_100DF8337520B158">A Son begotten by God to Day, <HI>i. e.</HI> From Eternity, for this was &s;poken of Chri&s;t long before his Incarnation. Again, He is repre|&s;ented, <HI>Ver.</HI> 11.12. as the <HI>Object of religious Wor&s;hip,</HI> the Foundation of Hope and Source of true Happine&s;s. And in the 8th and 9th Ver&s;es as having <HI>the Heathen for his Inheri|tance, and the utmo&s;t Ends of the Earth for his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI> It's al&s;o ob&s;erved in the 9th and 12th Ver&s;es that De&s;truction and Ruin flow from his angry Frowns. The&s;e Things can be ju&s;tly a&s;crib'd to Chri&s;t alone, and none but he.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Office</HI> in which Chri&s;t is inve&s;ted, namely, that of a <HI>King,</HI> who is a Monarch and Head of a Kingdom. Now Chri&s;t is called the <HI>Lord's King</HI> in the Text to &s;ignify his e|ternal Generation, divine Anointing and Mi&s;&s;ion, as al&s;o the peculiarity &amp; peerle&s;s Ex|cellency of his Kingdom, which not only dif|fers much from, but is infinitely &s;uperior to all the Kingdoms of the World. He is a King worthy of God who rules with him and for him. Now the <HI>Subjects</HI> which King <HI>Je&s;us</HI> governs over are de&s;crib'd in the&s;e Words, <HI>My holy Hill of Zion. Zion</HI> was a certain Fort of the <HI>Jebu&s;ites</HI> almo&s;t impregnable, which <HI>David</HI> having routed, the Inhabitants con|verted into a Palace for the Seat of his own Re&s;idence, on the Border of which was the Mount <HI>Moriah,</HI> on which the Temple &s;tood, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 5.9. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 3.1. But <HI>my&s;tical Zion</HI>
<PB REF="004822_0009_100DF83594253230">is the <HI>Church of God,</HI> which is &s;o called be|cau&s;e of it's unconquerablene&s;s. Our Savi|viour informs us, that the Gates of Hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it; and al&s;o becau&s;e the Go&s;pel proceeds therefrom, P&s;al. 110.2. <HI>The Lord &s;hall &s;end the Rod of thy Strength out of Zion.</HI> To this we may add, that <HI>David</HI> who was the King of the natural Zion, was a Type of Chri&s;t, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 34.23. Now Zion is called <HI>holy</HI> in the Text, <HI>relatively,</HI> becau&s;e of the Temple's being built on the neighbouring Mount <HI>Moriah,</HI> by rea&s;on of which the Town and People were called <HI>holy,</HI> Dan. 9.24. <HI>&amp;</HI> I&s;a. 63 18. and what is here intended by the holy Hill, viz the <HI>Church of God,</HI> is called holy, be|cau&s;e a holy God as it were dwells in her, and his holy Wor&s;hip is celebrated by her, and becau&s;e &s;he is made holy by the Blood and Spirit of Chri&s;t, both imputatively and inhe|rently; as al&s;o becau&s;e it is her Duty to de|&s;ire after, and labour for Holine&s;s in the highe&s;t Degree.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Act</HI> of inve&s;titure, <HI>Set</HI> Yet have I <HI>&s;et,</HI> or <HI>anointed,</HI> as it is in the Margin, or <HI>created</HI> or <HI>appointed,</HI> as &s;ome render it, by which we are to under&s;tand the Father's giving the Son a rightful Claim to exerci&s;e the kingly Office, as Mediator. The Words are ex|pre&s;s'd in the preter Ten&s;e, to &s;hew that the Con&s;titution of Chri&s;t to be King, was done of old in the Council of the Trinity, when the Device of Man's Salvation was form'd.
<PB REF="004822_0010_100DF8371C990798">The Word <HI>anoint</HI> may al&s;o denote the Father's conferring &s;uch Qualifications upon Chri&s;t as Mediator, as were nece&s;&s;ary for the right Di&s;charge of all the Duties of his Kingly-Office&punc; <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 45.7.</P>
<P>That Je&s;us Chri&s;t is King of his Church, and he only, appears by the following Con|&s;iderations,</P>
<P N="1">1. From the <HI>Prophecies</HI> of the old Te&s;tament, concerning him, <HI>Gen</HI> 49.10.</P>
<P N="2">2. From the <HI>Types</HI> &amp; <HI>Figures</HI> of his Kingly-Office which we find in &s;acred Writ, &s;uch as that of <HI>Melchi&s;edeck, David,</HI> and <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. From the <HI>Kingly Titles</HI> which are fre+quently a&s;crib'd to him, in the Book of God. Such as <HI>King of Zion, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Lord of Glory, Prince of Peace, Cap|tain of our Salvation, Head of the Church, Judge and Lawgiver.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. From his <HI>&s;olemn Inve&s;titure</HI> into this Of|fice, as in our Text.</P>
<P N="5">5. From his <HI>own Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> before <HI>Pilate,</HI> and the Writing affix'd to his Cro&s;s, by which his very Enemies acknowledged his Kingly Authority.</P>
<P>Which Particulars afore&s;aid can be a&s;crib'd to none but Chri&s;t; for as no meer Creature is able to manage the Reins of Government, &s;o none of them has a legal Claim thereto. To imagine that one Body the Church has two or more Heads is to deform her Beauty, defile her Honours, and render her mon&s;trous.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004822_0011_100DF8395A4301D8">
Now the Kingly-Office of Chri&s;t may be more generally thus de&s;cribed, namely,</P>
<P><HI>It is that mediatorial Function by which he di&s;|pen&s;es and governs with all Power and Authority, what&s;oever re&s;pects his People's Happine&s;s,</HI> Luk. 1.32, 33.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of Chri&s;t is indeed twofold, viz. Either <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> or <HI>per&s;onal.</HI> His <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> Kingdom is that infinite Power of Govern|ment which belongs to him as God, and is common to all the Per&s;ons of the &s;acred Tri|nity. His <HI>mediatorial</HI> Kingdom is that Power of Government which was committed or de|legated to Chri&s;t as Mediator, God-man, by his Father, as our Text confirms; and this is al&s;o twofold, either <HI>univer&s;al</HI> or <HI>par|ticular.</HI> The <HI>univer&s;al</HI> mediatorial Kingdom of Chri&s;t extends to all Things, with a view to the Churches Good, Eph. 1.22. <HI>And gave him to be Head over all Things to the Church.</HI> The <HI>particular</HI> mediatorial Kingdom of Chri&s;t re&s;pects the Church only, and the compa&s;&s;ing her Good in all the different Periods of Time, whither in this Life or that to come.</P>
<P>But more particularly in order to have a clearer View of the Nature of Chri&s;t's King|ly-Office, let us con&s;ider the An&s;wer in the A&s;&s;embly's Catechi&s;m, to the 26th Que&s;tion concerning it; which is thus, <HI>Chri&s;t execu|teth the Office of a King</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>in &s;ubdu|ing us to him&s;elf, in ruling and defending us, and in re&s;training and conquering all his and our E|nemies.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="004822_0012_100DF83C11319C80">Here are &s;everal Acts of kingly Pow|er pointed to by the A&s;&s;embly, which de&s;erve our Attention;</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of which is, that of <HI>&s;ubduing Per|&s;ons to him&s;elf.</HI> But who are the&s;e? why tho&s;e who were cho&s;en from Eternity to Sal|vation, and given by the Father to Chri&s;t in the Covenant of Redemption, and no others, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.4. Joh. 17.6, 8, 9. <HI>I have manife&s;ted thy Name to the Men thou gave&s;t me out of the World.</HI> Now this Act of <HI>&s;ubduing to him&s;elf</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, that the&s;e very Per&s;ons who have been given by the Father to the Son are while in a State of Nature, Enemies to and Rebels again&s;t his Government, and that they will not be bro't any other ways to &s;ubmit thereto, but by &s;o|vereign Power and Conque&s;t; and this in|deed both Scripture &amp; Experience confirm, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.10. &amp; 8.7. Chri&s;t does not only as a Prophet propo&s;e to the Elect the Terms of Peace, but as a King by the Almighty Power of his Spirit, through his Word, convinces their Minds and per&s;wades their Wills freely to comply with them, <HI>Job</HI> 16.8, 9. <HI>P&s;al</HI> 110 3. Sinners will never &s;ubmit kindly to Chri&s;t's Government, till the &s;trong Man armed be ca&s;t out, and the &s;tubborne&s;s of their Wills be &s;ubdued and broken.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Act of Chri&s;t's Kingly-Power is his <HI>ruling of his People,</HI> after they are &s;ub|dued to him&s;elf; and this he doth outwardly by his Laws, and inwardly by his Spirit. The
<PB N="8" REF="004822_0013_100DF83E713CC838">Government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the Churches is upon Chri&s;t's Shoulder; him hath the Father given to be a Leader and Commander to his People. As he has given a perfect Sy&s;tem of Laws for their Direction, &s;o he helps his Elect to un|der&s;tand, love and obey them by his Spirit, &s;incerely, unexceptionably, willingly, and per&s;everingly. He <HI>puts his Fear in their Hearts that they &s;hall not depart from him,</HI> Jer. 22.40.</P>
<P>Therefore for any Men to devi&s;e new Laws and obtrude them on the Subjects of Chri&s;t, is as needle&s;s as it is pre&s;umptuous, and inju|rious to his royal Prerogative and their Li|berty.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another Act of Chri&s;t's Kingly-Power is his <HI>defending his People.</HI> It is doubtle&s;s the Duty of a Prince to protect his Subjects, to procure and pre&s;erve their Peace by main|taining good Government among them; as well as by guarding them from Violence by foreign Foes. Now the King of <HI>Zion</HI> has given his People a Peace, which their Ene|mies can as little under&s;tand as bereave them of. The King of the Church pre&s;erves her from outward Violence &s;o far as &s;erves her be&s;t Good, and any more would be a Lo&s;s in|&s;tead of a Benefit. If Chri&s;t had not inter|pos'd by the Arm of his almighty Power to &s;creen his People from the Rage of their E|nemies, his Church would have been entirely de&s;troyed long ago. And as the King of the Church defends the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> of his People, ei|ther
<PB N="9" REF="004822_0014_100DF83FFA253D18">from or in Trouble, &s;o as to make them i&s;&s;ue in their Benefit according to his gra|cious Promi&s;e, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. (<HI>By this the Iniquity of Jacob &s;hall be purged, and this is all the Frait to take away his Sins.</HI>) &s;o he defends their <HI>Graces,</HI> from being utterly de&s;troyed, by the vigorous and unwearied A&s;&s;aults of their inward Cor|ruptions and outward Enemies; by his Power they are revived out of their uncomfortable Deadne&s;s, and reduced from their ungrateful Strayings; and &s;o guided by his Council and carried by his Strength to eternal Glory and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.5. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.24. O if they were le&s;t to them&s;elves, they would be utter|ly &s;wallowed up with De&s;pair and Di&s;cou|ragement, under their doleful De&s;ertions, or el&s;e lo&s;e all Reli&s;h of Religion by Security and Sloth, and thus wander eternally from God. O! If our Stock were in our own Hands and we had no better Security for our &s;tand|ing, but our own Endeavours, we &s;hould all &s;urely prove Bankrupts with our fir&s;t Parents, and none of <HI>Adam's</HI> Po&s;terity would cro&s;s the Thre&s;hold of Glory: But ble&s;&s;ed be the gra|cious God, the Father, Son and Spirit by Men and Angels throughout all Eternity, that the Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e; <HI>Zion</HI>'s King is his People's Surety. His almighty Power is en|gag'd, by his gracious Promi&s;e, for his People's final Per&s;everance, <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.40. <HI>Job.</HI> 10.28. Our Power, Purpo&s;es &amp; Promi&s;es are little worth, God knows: O! But the Purpo&s;es of Chri&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="004822_0015_100DF84198DA80C8">&s;tand like Mountains of eternal Bra&s;s. His Power all the Creation cannot with&s;tand, and his Promi&s;e will never, never &s;ail: We may with fulne&s;s of Confidence lay the &s;tre&s;s of our eternal Salvation upon it. O! the Compa|&s;&s;ionate King of <HI>Zion</HI> comforts tho&s;e that are ca&s;t down; tho' he hideth his Face for a lit|tle Moment, yet he returns! he returns! O he returns dear Brethren! to the equal A&s;to|ni&s;hment and Con&s;olation of his People! When the poor People of God are dried like a Leaf in his Ab&s;ence from them, and almo&s;t quite di&s;couraged, becau&s;e of the View they have of their own meane&s;s, vilene&s;s, worth|le&s;sne&s;s and unprofitablene&s;s, O how &s;trangely does it affect them to behold their dear Lord coming again and again over the Mountains of <HI>Bether</HI> to their Souls Succour, after their manifold and ungrateful Abu&s;es of his Love-Tokens, after their repeated Wan|drings and Breaches of their Vows, Purpo&s;es, and Promi&s;es. After Souls have been &s;tain'd by Sen&s;uality &amp; Sloth. O! How does it fill their Mands with Wonder, cover their Fa|ces with Shame, and throughly break their Hearts into bitter weeping, from Love to think, that either God or Man &s;hould take any kind Notice of &s;uch poor, ungrateful, &s;inful and worthle&s;s Worm; as they, the like of which they do not think is in all the World. Their Hearts are &s;well'd &s;o big with Go&s;pel Grief and Gratitude, that they are
<PB N="11" REF="004822_0016_100DF844F8EDAB60">ready to bur&s;t in Pieces; the &s;ecret Language of their Souls this Occa&s;ion, is perhaps to the following purpo&s;e; <Q><HI>Dear Lord!</HI> How &s;trange and &s;urprizing is the Glory of thy pure Grace, which thus pur&s;ues, with the mo&s;t unwearied Patience &amp; endearing Me|thods, a wicked, wretched, worthle&s;s, wan|dring Worm, the like of which, in every re|&s;pect is not among all thy rational Creatures! Merciful God &amp; dear Saviour, I blu&s;h &amp; am a&s;hamed at the Riches of thy free &amp; endu|ring Kindne&s;s&punc; Good Maje&s;ty, wherefore wilt thou love the meane&s;t Du&s;t, without a Motive? and continue thy infinitely va|luable Regard, after the vile&s;t Abu&s;e both of thy comforting &amp; cha&s;tening Providences? How, O how great God! &s;hall I obtain Mercy to walk an&s;werable to the Obliga|tions of thy matchle&s;s Love, and return the Gratitude it demerits. Alas! wo is me, for my In&s;tability and Ingratitude, my Sen&s;uality and Sloth. But, O my God! how invariable is thine Affection, how un|wearied thy Patience, and how &s;ure and faithful is thy Word. Well, great Maje&s;ty, I de&s;erve thy Rebukes, if thou wilt &s;mite me dead or lay other heavy Rods upon me, I dur&s;t not &s;peak again&s;t it, it would &s;ure|ly be righteous and ju&s;t. I therefore com|mit my &s;elf into thine Hands, O thou glo|rious Sovereign, do with me, thy poor Creature, what thou plea&s;e&s;t, only if thou

<P>But a 4th Act of Chri&s;t's Kingly-Power is his <HI>re&s;training his and their Enemies.</HI> The Church of Chri&s;t in this World is compa&s;&s;ed with many and powerful Enemies. She &s;ojourns in <HI>Me&s;ech,</HI> in <HI>Kedar's</HI> Tents, among the en|vious <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI> She has her Seat of mourn|ful Re&s;idence in Dens of Lions &amp; on Moun|tains of Leopards. The&s;e cruel Bea&s;ts of Prey, who are ince&s;&s;antly labouring to worry her, to rob her of her Honour, or Innocence, her Ea&s;e or her Life. Men, Devils and Corrup|tions join in a helli&s;h League to Plot and procure her Ruin. The Children of the Bond-Woman, &s;ome of whom have a &s;trict but dead Form of Religion, like the old Phari&s;ees, per|&s;ecute her under a religious Mask: Some|times the Keepers of the Vineyard will &s;mite her, and take away her Vail from her: Some|times her Mothers Children, unexperienc'd Profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame Religion, will be angry with her; yea &s;o angry as to ca&s;t her out of their Communion, and &s;ay, <HI>Let the Lord be glorified!</HI> In the mean time, the Devil goes about like a Lion rampant, roaring &amp; raging as if he would devour them at once; and indeed he would make &s;hort Work with them all, if he had Liberty. Now with tho&s;e Enemies their Corruptions are ready to con|&s;pire, for the&s;e do al&s;o War again&s;t their Souls,
<PB N="13" REF="004822_0018_100DF8481033C038">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.11. God's People are not able to with&s;tand one of the&s;e Enemies apart, how much le&s;s all together. How &s;oon then would they be ruin'd by them if the King of the Church did not interpo&s;e by his re&s;training Power to check their Rage and bla&s;t their Devices. Indeed he does not de&s;troy them at once, but lets them plot and con&s;pire a|gain&s;t his Heritage, and when they think they have brought their hell-hatch'd Coun|&s;els to Ripene&s;s and Perfection; he turns them to Fooli&s;hne&s;s, catches <HI>Ahitophel's</HI> in their Craftine&s;s, and puts Hooks in the Jaws of <HI>Pharoah</HI>'s, and re&s;trains the remainder of their Wrath, that it &s;hall not produce &s;uch pernicious Effects as they maliciou&s;ly inten|ded. And thus the Power &amp; Love of <HI>Zion</HI>'s King is glorified in pre&s;erving his Church which is afflicted &amp; to&s;&s;ed with Tempe&s;ts from being drowned in the&s;e Waters, in pre&s;erving the burning Bu&s;h from being con&s;umed by the Flames with which it is &s;corched. The Lord Je&s;us does al&s;o re&s;train Satan from doing that Injury to God's People which he would o|therwi&s;e commit, and will &s;hortly brui&s;e him under their Feet. Again, the King of the Church re&s;trains the Corruptions of his Peo|ple from breaking out, as they naturally tend to, otherwi&s;e there is not one of his Subjects but would be a Reproach to his Prince and Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004822_0019_100DF84A536E6168">
The la&s;t Act of Kingly-Power which the A&s;&s;embly mentions is that of <HI>&s;ubduing his E|nemies.</HI> Which he doth by Degrees that the Sincerity of his Subjects may be proved and their Graces exerci&s;ed! But in the End of Time, he will gloriou&s;ly triumph over all his Enemies, and at his Name every Knee &s;hall bow.</P>
<P>But it is Time to &s;peak &s;omething of the <HI>Royal Prerogatives</HI> of the King of <HI>Zion;</HI> and they are principally the&s;e following;</P>
<P N="1">1. His <HI>anointing,</HI> by which he receiv'd the Spirit and Power without Mea&s;ure, yea the fullne&s;s of the Godhead bodily, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 45.6. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.9.</P>
<P N="2">2. His <HI>inve&s;titure,</HI> whereby according to God's eternal Decree, he was appointed to be King, and al&s;o promis'd &amp; prefigur'd, as was hinted before, as well as proclaim'd at his Birth by the Angels, and acknowledged at his Death by his Enemies. But,</P>
<P N="3">2. Another royal Prerogative of the King of Zion is his <HI>Coronation,</HI> which was in his humbled State a little before his Death, by a thorny Crown in Deri&s;ion, but after his A&s;|cen&s;ion into Heaven, by a Crown of Glory at the right Hand of his Father, <HI>Heb.</HI> 29. A Crown is an En&s;ign of Kingly-Maje&s;ty, <HI>E&s;th.</HI> 1.11. Chri&s;t is &s;aid to have many Crowns upon his Head, <HI>Rev.</HI> 19.12. not only to &s;ig|nify that he is King of Kings, but al&s;o to point out the many Victories he hath gain'd
<PB N="15" REF="004822_0020_100DF84C6E128288">over his and his People's Enemies. For it is the Cu&s;tom of victorious Kings to take the Crowns of the Heads off the conquered, and put them on their own, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.30. It was an afflictive Sight to &s;ee the ble&s;&s;ed Head of Chri&s;t crown'd with Thorns. But O its joyful to behold him now crown'd with Glory &amp; Honour infinitely above the highe&s;t Angels! and to con&s;ider that by his Suffer|ings he has purchas'd for his People an in|corruptible Crown, a Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, a Crown of Life, a Crown of Glory, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9. 2.4. 1 <HI>Pet</HI> 5.2, 3.</P>
<P N="4">4. His <HI>Palace-Royal,</HI> which exceeds in Beauty and Magnificence any Ideas that we can form of it. Hence the Ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate is &s;aid to <HI>dwell in that Light which no Man can approach unto,</HI> 1 Tim 6.15, 16. But indeed the Country Seat of this great King's Re&s;i|dence, is the contrite and humble Hearts of his faithful Subjects, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 57.15.</P>
<P N="5">5. His <HI>Throne:</HI> Now a Throne is a Seat for a King, an En&s;ign of royal State &amp; Ma|je&s;ty, <HI>E&s;t.</HI> 5.1. The Throne of Chri&s;t is &s;o far &s;uperior to all earthly Thrones, that they are plac'd on his Foot&s;tool, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 66.1. Now the Throne of Chri&s;t is a Throne of Maje&s;ty and Glory, <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.1. a Throne of Grace &amp; Mercy, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4 16. an exalted, e&s;tabli&s;h'd and eternal Throne, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 66.1. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 93.2. <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.8.</P>
<P N="6">6. His <HI>Scepter,</HI> or <HI>royal Rod;</HI> which is a|nother Token of Kingly-Power &amp; Maje&s;ty,
<PB N="16" REF="004822_0021_100DF84E8D269F78"><HI>E&s;th.</HI> 5.2. Now the King of <HI>Zion,</HI> hath a two-fold Scepter, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Iron.</HI> His <HI>gol|den</HI> Scepter is that by which he rules his Subjects, <HI>outwardly</HI> by his Word, e&s;pecially of the Go&s;pel, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 110.2. and <HI>inwardly</HI> by his Spirit, which is on this Account call'd the Finger and Arm of the Lord, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.20. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 53.1. His <HI>Iron Scepter,</HI> is that by which he breaks and confounds his Enemies, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.27. Ju&s;tly has the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erv'd concerning this King of Zion, Heb. 1.8. <HI>Thy Throne O God is forever and ever, a Scepter of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s is the Scepter of thy Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. His <HI>Laws,</HI> that are <HI>holy, ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> Rom. 7.12. Hence the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> in|forms us, that there is but <HI>one Lawgiver,</HI> Jam. 4.12. It is the royal Prerogative to authorize the publick Coin, which the King's Image and In&s;cription makes current among his Subjects, <HI>Matth.</HI> 2.2. &amp; 20.21. &s;o mo&s;t certain|ly it is only the Stamp of Chri&s;t's kingly Au|thority that can give religious Laws &s;uch a Sanction as de&s;erves the regard of his Sub|jects: And to coin others in addition to his is to confront his Wi&s;dom, u&s;urp his royal Prerogative, and en&s;lave his Subjects: But it is our Duty, our Honour, and our Inte|re&s;t to be as careful that we be not en&s;nared and en&s;laved by the Commandments of Men in religious Matters, as of receiving coun|terfeit Coin in civil Affairs, for they are both rebellious Cheats; It's fa&s;e&s;t to walk in the
<PB N="17" REF="004822_0022_100DF85016328A78">King's High-Way to Heaven, ob&s;erving the Directions of Chri&s;t's royal Law, and as for human Taditions in Religion, let us out of loyal Love to our King and Saviour reject them with Abhorrence, and &s;tand fa&s;t in the Liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free.</P>
<P>To the afore&s;aid Particulars, I may add he following Prerogatives, viz. <HI>Tribute,</HI> a <HI>Trea&s;ury</HI> or <HI>Armament,</HI> and <HI>judicial Power?</HI> The Tribute of Tru&s;t, tran&s;cendent Love and religious Wor&s;hip is due to Zion's King from Men and Angels, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.6. He hath al&s;o a Magazine or Armoury &s;ufficient to fur|ni&s;h all his People in all their Combats with Sin, Satan and the World. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.11,&mdash;19, The King of Zion is al&s;o the &s;upreme and final Judge of Life &amp; Death, having Power to pardon or condemn, <HI>Mark</HI> 25.3.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, it appears that the Kingdom of Chri&s;t is,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Spiritual;</HI> tho' it hath &s;omething re|&s;embling the Kingdoms of the World, yet it's Nature differs much from them: Hence our Saviour ob&s;erv'd that his Kingdom was not of this World, <HI>Joh.</HI> 18.36. It's not at tended with outward Pomp and State, but it's Admini&s;trations are &s;piritual; and in|deed it was this that &s;tumbled the <HI>Jews</HI> at Chri&s;t, for they expected that the Me&s;&s;ias would come attended with the En&s;igns of worldly Glory and Grandeun.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Property of Chri&s;t's Kingdom
<PB N="18" REF="004822_0023_100DF851D0004870">is, that it is <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> as to all Times, all Places, and all Creatures, &s;o far as they &s;erve to promote the Weal of Chri&s;t's Subjects: <HI>His Kingdom ruleth over all,</HI> Matth. 28.18.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Eternal:</HI> It's a Kingdom that <HI>&s;hall &s;tand forever,</HI> Dan. 2.44.</P>
<P N="4">4. It's <HI>rich</HI> and <HI>glorious;</HI> hence it's call'd the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> of <HI>Light, Glory,</HI> becau&s;e it brings the &s;weete&s;t Peace and mo&s;t perfect Felicity to all the &s;incere Subjects of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I proceed to the <HI>Improvement.</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1. This Subject &s;erves to inform us of the Glory of Chri&s;t on the account of his King|ly-Office. He is called the <HI>Lord of Glory,</HI> the <HI>King of Glory.</HI> Now the Glory of Chri&s;t is illu&s;trated by divers Similitudes, as particu|larly by that of a <HI>Horn,</HI> P&s;al. 79.24. in which con&s;i&s;ts the Honour and Power of Bea&s;ts: By a <HI>Lamp,</HI> which &s;catters its Splendor or Bright|ne&s;s, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 132.17. By a <HI>Crown flouri&s;hing, P&s;al.</HI> 132.18. By <HI>Thrones,</HI> in which Monarchs manife&s;t their State &amp; Grandeur, <HI>Luke</HI> 1.32. Now the kingly Glory of Chri&s;t was prefi|gured by the Magnificence of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon;</HI> and it will be the more affecting to us if we con&s;ider the infinite Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;|tice, Mercy and Power of this Prince, by which he is every way &s;uitably qualified to manage the Reins of Government. He is the wi&s;e and wonderful Coun&s;ellor, the mighty-God of ho&s;ts, the Wi&s;dom &amp; Power
<PB N="19" REF="004822_0024_100DF855682B0908">of God, Ju&s;tice and Love it&s;elf. His King|dom is va&s;t and ample, extending to the ut|mo&s;t Boundaries of the Univer&s;e; for to him all Power is given in Heaven &amp; Earth. His Kingdom is peaceable &amp; durable, exten|ding to the utmo&s;t Limits of Time; the&s;e Things may encline us to honour our glo|rious Sovereign, by Thoughts, Words and Works, and to glory in him:</P>
<P N="2">2. If Chri&s;t be the only King of Zion, by divine Appointment then we may learn, that <HI>it is a bold Inva&s;ion of his Crown and Dignity to make new Laws without his Interpo&s;al, to govern his Subjects by, in religious Matters,</HI> and na|turally tends to &s;et up a human King|dom in the room of Chri&s;t's and in oppo&s;i|tion to it; as al&s;o to draw the Subjects of Chri&s;t from their Allegiance to him, and &s;ubject their Con&s;ciences to the Humours and Lu&s;ts of their Fellow-Creatures, as well as to rend the Church of Chri&s;t into an in|finity of Parts. Whether the Pride and Pre|&s;umption of tho&s;e that frame new Laws in religious Matters, be a greater Evil than the Simplicity and Cowardi&s;e of tho&s;e that obey them, is hard to determine. I proceed to a</P>
<P N="2">2d U&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Examination;</HI> Let us exa|mine, whether the King of Zion has &s;ubdu'd us to him&s;elf? To this end,</P>
<P N="1">1. Has Chri&s;t &s;et up a Court in your Bo|&s;oms, and caus'd your guilty Con&s;ciences to draw up an Indictment again&s;t you, for your
<PB N="20" REF="004822_0025_100DF856EFD95BF0">Rebellion in State &amp; Practice; and to pro|duce Evidence to prove this dreadful Charge? and have your Con&s;ciences as Judges on the Bench, pa&s;s'd Sentence upon you according to Law &amp; Evidence, that you were in your pre&s;ent Condition, Rebels again&s;t the great God, your rightful Sovereign, and that for this you were cur&s;ed by God, and mu&s;t be damned to all Eternity, unle&s;s ye obtain Re|conciliation and Conver&s;ion?</P>
<P N="2">2. Have ye bitterly bewail'd from your Hearts with Shame &amp; Indignation, that you have been &s;o long, unju&s;tly, ungratefully and fooli&s;hly Rebellious again&s;t the Son of God, the King of Zion? And has this your mourn|ing proceeded from Love, and been frequent|ly repeated? <HI>P&s;al</HI> 51.4, 17, <HI>Ezra</HI> 9.5, 6. <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.19.</P>
<P N="3">3. Have you renounced your former Ma&s;|ters, Sin and Satan, and under a Sen&s;e of your own Vilene&s;s, Mi&s;ery &amp; Inability, hank|fully accepted of the Act of Grace proclai|med by the King of Zion in his Go&s;pel, for the Pardon of returning Rebels? Did ye &s;ur|render your &s;elves entirely to his Govern|ment, and do you wholly lean upon his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s for your Acceptance with God? <HI>Matth</HI> 6.24. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12. <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.12,&mdash;14. and <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55.1.</P>
<P N="4">4. Are the Laws of the King written on your Heart? other Princes have their Image on their Coin, but Chri&s;t engraves his on his
<PB N="21" REF="004822_0026_100DF8591046A040">People's Hearts. Do ye &s;incerely &amp; habitu|ally love Chri&s;t's Laws, &s;o as to de&s;ire ho|ne&s;tly and endeavour earne&s;tly &amp; generally to be conform'd to them without Exception? <HI>Heb.</HI> 8.10. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 1. <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.29. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18.</P>
<P N="5">5. Are your Wills made &s;ubject to Chri&s;t as King? Temporal Princes may ty the Hands of Rebels, but cannot turn their Hearts; but Zion's King can &amp; does change the Hearts of the perver&s;e&s;t of Men, and make them willing in the Day of his Power, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 110.3.

As Chri&s;t our King did not lead a worldly Life, but avoided all worldly Pride and State, &s;o &s;hould we be &s;pi|ritual, and look upon all vain Pomp and im|moderate Love to other worldly Things, to be below our kingly Dignity. In this Imi|tation of Chri&s;t con&s;i&s;ts our greate&s;t Per|fection and highe&s;t Happine&s;s; for if we are made like to Chri&s;t the King here by Grace, we &s;hall be like to him in eternal Glory.</P>
<P><HI>NOW to the King eternal, immortal, invi|&s;ible, the only true GOD, be Glory for ever.</HI></P>
