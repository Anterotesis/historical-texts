<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE yearly-meeting in 1783, having a concern for the revi&s;al of our di&s;cipline, committed the important work to the meeting for &s;ufferings, who, after waiting for a right qualification, proceeded on the bu&s;ine&s;s; and having the revi&s;al of the London di&s;cipline of 1782, with tho&s;e of our neigh|bouring yearly-meetings as well as our own to compare, have with much labour and clo&s;e attention, in the ability afforded, performed the &s;ame, which being laid before the la&s;t yearly-meeting, a large committee, con&s;i&s;ting of friends from each quarter, were appointed to join the meeting for &s;ufferings in examining the &s;ame, who being met accordingly, were favoured after &s;e|veral &s;ittings to go through the work; and the whole, as contained in the fol|lowing pages, was agreed to; and the yearly-meeting having committed to the meeting for &s;ufferings the further care of communicating the &s;ame to the &s;eve|ral quarterly and monthly-meetings, they have thought fit to direct a &s;uit|able number of copies to be printed for that purpo&s;e, in order,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That every quarterly and monthly-meeting may be furni&s;hed with a fair and correct collection of the minutes and advices which have been agreed to, for regulating the affairs of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. "That the&s;e minutes and advices being more generally received, may be more uniformly ob&s;erved and put in practice, that order, unity, peace and harmony, may be pre&s;erved throughout the churches."</P>
<P N="3">3dly. "That in an e&s;pecial manner the youth of the pre&s;ent and &s;ucceed|ing generations may not only be early and more fully in&s;tructed in our reli|gious principles, but in the nature and de&s;ign of our Chri&s;tian di&s;cipline; and through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance be enabled to adorn our holy profe&s;&s;ion, by a con|&s;i&s;tent conduct and circum&s;pect conver&s;ation in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty,
<PB N="iv" REF="019014_0003_0FA958C3C43E78B8">thereby avoiding the reproach which many, through a defection in principle, or a degeneracy in practice, have brought upon them&s;elves, and the body of which they profe&s;s to be members."</P>
<P N="4">4thly. "That the unfaithful, the immoral, and the libertine profe&s;&s;ors, may be &s;ea&s;onably reminded of their danger and of their duty, as well as of the great labour, which, in much go&s;pel love, hath been from time to time be&s;towed for their help and recovery; and that &s;uch as continue to de&s;pi&s;e and reject the convictions of truth, and the coun&s;el of their brethren, and refu&s;e to be reclaimed, may be made &s;en&s;ible that they them&s;elves are the cau&s;e of their &s;eparation from our religious fellow&s;hip and communion: For when any, by their incon&s;i&s;tent and di&s;orderly conduct, or by imbibing and adopting principles or practices contrary to the doctrine which we have receiv|ed, have fir&s;t manife&s;ted their di&s;unity with the &s;ociety, it is but ju&s;t and requi&s;ite, that, after endeavouring and waiting to re&s;tore them without effect, the body &s;hould te&s;tify its di&s;unity with &s;uch erring and refractory members; at the &s;ame time earne&s;tly de&s;iring that they may be convinced of the error of their ways, and that through unfeigned repentance, and a con&s;i&s;tent orderly conduct in future, they may be re-united to the body. This being the utmo&s;t extent of our di&s;cipline re&s;pecting offenders, it is very evident, that, from the right exerci&s;e thereof, no degree of per&s;ecution or impo&s;ition can be ju&s;tly in|ferred; for the impo&s;ition re&s;ts entirely on the part of tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;t on being retained as members, whil&s;t at open variance with the body, either in principle or practice."</P>
<P>We are not however without a clear &s;en&s;e that this publication will prove in&s;ufficient to produce the de&s;ired effect, unle&s;s we are very careful to move and act under the immediate influence of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, in the pure love of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>"And whil&s;t we are earne&s;tly recommending this work to the notice and regard of friends, we cannot omit to pre&s;s upon them a diligent reading of the Holy Scriptures, as &s;uperior to all other writing for in&s;truction; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="v" REF="019014_0004_0FA958C58A7CC0E0">mu&s;t yield great &s;atisfaction to ob&s;erve how con&s;onant the&s;e advices are to the doctrine and precepts of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles."</P>
<P>Although this collection is printed &s;olely for the u&s;e of our own &s;ociety, yet, &s;hould it get abroad and meet the public eye, it is not doubted but every &s;erious and candid reader will ob&s;erve, throughout the whole, the con&s;tant and earne&s;t endeavours of the &s;ociety for the promotion of virtue and religion.</P>

<HEAD>ARBITRATION.</HEAD>
<P>AGREED, that the choo&s;ing of arbitrators is proper in ca&s;es of differ|ence about a man's property. 1684.</P>
<P>Whereas it &s;ometimes happeneth, to the hurt of truth, and grief of many friends, that differences do ari&s;e among&s;t &s;ome profe&s;&s;ing truth, about outward things; it is therefore by this meeting thought convenient, and advi&s;ed, that when any friend or friends &s;hall hear of any &s;uch difference betwixt any friends in that meeting to which they do belong, that they forthwith &s;peak to, and tenderly advi&s;e, the per&s;ons between whom the difference is, to make a &s;peedy end thereof; and if that friend or tho&s;e friends do not comply with their advice, that then they take to them one or two friends more, and again exhort them to end their difference; and if they or either of them refu&s;e, then to let them know, that it is the advice and coun&s;el of friends, that they &s;hould each choo&s;e an equal number of indifferent, impartial and judicious friends, to hear and &s;peedily determine the &s;ame; and that they do bind them&s;elves to &s;tand to their award and determination, or the award and deter|mination of the major part of them, that &s;hall be made and &s;igned by the arbitrators.</P>
<P>Al&s;o this meeting doth advi&s;e, that if any per&s;on profe&s;&s;ing the truth among us, and e&s;teemed a friend, &s;hall refu&s;e &s;peedily to end the difference, or refer it as before advi&s;ed, complaint be made of that per&s;on or per&s;ons, unto the monthly-meeting to which he doth belong; and if after admonition he &s;hall refu&s;e &s;o to refer his ca&s;e, that then the meeting do te&s;tify again&s;t &s;uch per&s;on, and di&s;own him to be of our &s;ociety, until he &s;hall comply with the equal methods and agreements of our &s;ociety, and by &s;uch his compliance

<P>Advi&s;ed, that in all ca&s;es of controver&s;y and difference, the per&s;ons con|cerned therein either &s;peedily compo&s;e the difference between them&s;elves, or make choice of &s;ome faithful friends to determine the &s;ame; or otherwi&s;e, if they cannot agree upon the choice, to &s;ubmit to the monthly-meeting's choice of certain per&s;ons meet to in&s;pect and determine the controver&s;y, and to &s;tand to their award and final determination thereof; that &s;uch controver|&s;ies may not be continued, to cau&s;e a reproach. 1692.</P>
<P>And it is the advice of this meeting, that per&s;ons differing about outward things do, as little as may be, trouble public mini&s;tering friends with being arbitrators in &s;uch ca&s;es. 1697.</P>
<P>And that all per&s;ons differing be exhorted by the monthly-meeting to which they belong, when their ca&s;es are referred, and judgment and award made, &s;igned and given thereupon, as afore&s;aid, to &s;tand to and perform the &s;aid award, which they have bound them&s;elves to perform: And if any &s;hall refu&s;e &s;o to do, that then the monthly-meeting to which &s;uch per&s;on doth belong, upon notice thereof to them given, &s;hall appoint a &s;uitable committee to labour with him, and if he do not make it evident, that there is manife&s;t error or inju&s;tice, they admoni&s;h him thereunto; and if after admonition he per&s;i&s;t to refu&s;e, then the meeting to te&s;tify again&s;t him as before; but if &s;uch error or inju&s;tice be made to appear, then the matter be recon&s;idered by the &s;ame or other arbitrators, as in the judgment of the monthly-meeting may appear be&s;t, and &s;uch correcting judgment be final. And the bonds of arbi|tration are not to be con&s;idered binding and final, where evident error or inju&s;tice is made to appear, and it is advi&s;ed that bonds be written accordingly; but where this is not manife&s;t, &s;uch bonds be conclu&s;ive and final.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="019014_0014_0FA958D245FE7068">
It is the &s;en&s;e and judgment of this meeting, that if any per&s;on profe&s;&s;ing truth with us &s;hall arre&s;t, &s;ue, or implead at law, any other of our members, before he hath proceeded in the methods herein before recommended, that &s;uch per&s;on doth therein depart from the principle of truth, and the known way thereof, and acts contrary thereunto, and ought to be dealt with by the meeting he belongs to for the &s;ame; and if he &s;hall not give &s;atisfaction to the meeting for &s;uch his di&s;orderly proceeding, by condemning it, and him|&s;elf therein, that then he be di&s;owned by the meeting. 1697. 1692.</P>

<HEAD>DEFAMATION and DETRACTION.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED to watch again&s;t all tale-bearing and defaming friends or others, or evil-&s;peaking tending thereunto; and &s;hut out all occa&s;ions of offences, contentions and divi&s;ions, and to put a &s;peedy &s;top thereto, pa&s;&s;ing righteous judgment upon all, who appear in&s;truments of divi&s;ions and offences, contrary to that peaceable truth and go&s;pel we profe&s;s to be guided by. Be kind and tender-hearted one to another, earne&s;tly labouring for univer&s;al love, union, and peace in our religious &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But when any hath received offence from another; let him fir&s;t &s;peak privately to the party offending, and endeavour reconciliation between them&s;elves, and not to whi&s;pher, or aggravate matters again&s;t one another, behind their backs, to the making parties, and the breach wider. 1692.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e ju&s;t and ancient commands of God be ob&s;erved, Levit. xix. 16, "Thou &s;halt not go up and down as a tale-bearer among thy people;" and Exodus xxiii. 1, "Thou &s;halt not rai&s;e a fal&s;e report." In the fear of the Lord &s;tand again&s;t all whi&s;perers, backbiters, tale-bearers, defamers and &s;landerers, and again&s;t all whi&s;perings, backbitings, tale-bearing, reproaching, and &s;lander|ing, and put a &s;peedy &s;top thereto as much as in you lies, for &s;uch works of dark|ne&s;s and envy tend to divi&s;ion and di&s;cord, and the righteous law of God goes again&s;t both the authors, fomenters, receivers and encouragers thereof. 1695.</P>
<P>Be careful to avoid all backbitings, whi&s;perings, and tale-bearings; for "The words of a tale-bearer," &s;ays the wi&s;e man, "are as wounds," Prov. xviii. 8, tending to the defamation and le&s;&s;ening the characters one of ano|ther. Be not therefore like tho&s;e of whom the prophet complains, "Report, &s;ay they, and we will report;" but when you hear a thing tending to the defamation of any, enquire of the reporter, whether he has acquainted the
<PB N="32" REF="019014_0033_0FA958E85C90AAF8">per&s;on affected thereby with &s;uch a report; if not, caution him to forbear &s;preading the &s;ame, le&s;t the reputation of the innocent be injured thereby. Endeavour to put a &s;peedy &s;top to all &s;uch wicked practices, and works of dark|ne&s;s, ju&s;tly condemnable, not only in the authors, but the encouragers thereof. "He that worketh deceit," &s;ays the Royal P&s;almi&s;t, <Q>&s;hall not dwell within my hou&s;e; he that telleth lies &s;hall not tarry in my &s;ight,</Q> P&s;al. ci. 5, 7. 1738.</P>
<P>We remind you to &s;tand upon your guard again&s;t all whi&s;pering, backbiting and detracting &s;pirits, who bu&s;y them&s;elves in &s;preading evil &s;urmi&s;ings one of another, and to di&s;courage every practice of that nature, ob&s;erving the ad|vice of the apo&s;tle, <Q>Let all bitterne&s;s, wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-&s;peaking, be put away from you, with all malice; be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chri&s;t's &s;ake hath forgiven you,</Q> Eph. iv. 31, 32. Always mindful of the precept of our Lord, <Q>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them,</Q> Mat. viii. 12. 1748.</P>
<P>And in order to put a &s;top to all tale-bearing and &s;landering, friends would do well to manife&s;t their aver&s;ion to &s;uch a practice. <Q>The north wind, &s;ays Solomon, driveth away rain; &s;o doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue,</Q> Prov. xxv. 23. 1733.</P>
<P>It is the advice of this meeting, that any per&s;on charged with defamation or &s;candal, ought to be proceeded again&s;t in the manner and by the &s;everal &s;teps following: Fir&s;t, the per&s;on defamed, or &s;uppo&s;ed to be defamed, in his own per&s;on, or any other to whom the knowledge of the ca&s;e &s;hall come, to go to the accu&s;ed and tell him his fault, or &s;uppo&s;ed fault, between them alone, and by the be&s;t method he is capable of to labour to convince him of it, in order to his acknowledgment of the truth and repentance, if he appears to be guilty. But if the accu&s;ed &s;hall appear, either through ignorance not to apprehend the validity of the proof, or through wilfulne&s;s not to yield to it, or being convinced, &s;hall refu&s;e to make &s;uch &s;atisfaction as the nature of ca&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="019014_0034_0FA958E9D2105808">requires (that being the con&s;equence of true repentance) in &s;uch ca&s;e the accu&s;er to take with him one or two more of the monthly-meeting the accu&s;ed belongs to, if it may be conveniently done, and if the accu&s;ed thinks fit, he may bring with him one or two friends al&s;o of the &s;ame monthly-meeting, if it may be conveniently done; and they together, in the wi&s;dom of God, to endeavour to obtain the true knowledge of the ca&s;e, by hearing witne&s;&s;es, if there be occa&s;ion. And if they all judge him guilty, and he doth not make &s;atisfaction; or if they do not all agree that he is innocent; in either of the&s;e ca&s;es happening, the per&s;on charging is at liberty to bring the matter before the church, who are the only judges now remaining, both of the nature of the fact, and the validity of the proof of it; and they, in the wi&s;dom of God, which we hope will not be wanting to his church, as they humbly wait on him for it, to deal with him for the good ends before mentioned, and as they &s;ee cau&s;e, upon a mature and deliberate con&s;ideration, to ju&s;tify or condemn him. And if the church &s;hall &s;ee meet to commit the con&s;ideration of a ca&s;e of this nature, for better di&s;patch, to certain per&s;ons of their own body, we recom|mend it as our tender advice, in ca&s;e the accu&s;ed &s;hall object again&s;t one or more of the friends &s;o cho&s;en, that the church have a due regard to &s;uch objection, and &s;et a&s;ide the per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;o objected again&s;t, and &s;ub&s;ti|tute another or others in his or their room, provided &s;uch objection doth not extend to the major part of the friends &s;o cho&s;en; and in general we de&s;ire all tenderne&s;s and regard may be had to a per&s;on under &s;uch circum&s;tances; and that friends, in a &s;pirit of love and conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;hould be ready to make him as ea&s;y as they can, provided they keep up the authority of their meetings.</P>
<P>Namele&s;s books, pamphlets, and papers, reflecting darkly on friends, are te&s;tified again&s;t; and it is de&s;ired that no &s;uch book, pamphlet or paper, be written, printed, publi&s;hed, or privately handed about, by any under our profe&s;&s;ion, for the time to come. 1718.</P>
<P>If you hear a report of a friend (to his di&s;advantage) be careful not to report it again, but go to the per&s;on of whom the report is, and enquire if it
<PB N="34" REF="019014_0035_0FA958EA8A9CFAE0">be true; then deal with &s;uch a per&s;on for it, according to the doctrine of Chri&s;t, Mat. xviii. 16, 17; but if fal&s;e, then endeavour as much as in you lies to &s;top &s;uch report: For, as Solomon &s;ays, <Q>A good name is rather to be cho&s;en than great riches,</Q> Prov. xxii. 1. 1719.</P>
<P>Whereas it may happen, that &s;ome friends may &s;uffer much in their repu|tation and character, by a detracting &s;pirit, which too much prevails among &s;ome bearing our name, who &s;helter them&s;elves under a pretence that they &s;ay no more than they have heard from others, but will not di&s;cover who they are; wherefore, to prevent this evil of reporting and tale-bearing, it is agreed, that &s;uch reporters or tale-bearers &s;hall either di&s;cover their authors, or be dealt with, and te&s;tified again&s;t, as the authors thereof. 1744.</P>

<P>ADVISED that friends be tender to the principle of God in all, and &s;hun the occa&s;ion of vain di&s;putes and janglings, both among&s;t them|&s;elves and others; for this many times is like a blu&s;tering wind, that hurts and brui&s;es the tender buds of plants. 1676.</P>
<P>Seeing our comfort, as a people, depends upon our care to maintain peace and fellow&s;hip among&s;t brethren, in all our &s;ervices, we earne&s;tly recommend an humble and conde&s;cending frame of &s;pirit unto all; that with godly fear, wi&s;dom and meekne&s;s, we may be &s;o ordered in all our re&s;pective &s;ervices, that every high and rough thing may be laid low, that all occa&s;ions of &s;triving may be prevented, and the peace of the church of Chri&s;t pre&s;erved and increa&s;ed among&s;t us.</P>
<P>And to this purpo&s;e it is tenderly advi&s;ed, that we diligently and carefully ob&s;erve the comely and ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel order, &s;o long known and in practice among&s;t us, in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s and of a &s;ound mind, which is the way to cru&s;h all differences in their infancy, and &s;uppre&s;s the ri&s;e as well as &s;top the progre&s;s of every thing that is un&s;eemly, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the te&s;ti|mony of the precious truth. 1699.</P>
<P>Advi&s;ed that a &s;pirit of love and humility may more and more diffu&s;e it&s;elf among us, and influence the hearts of all, &s;o that every one may come to &s;eek peace and pur&s;ue it; and that none be apt to take offence; but each, in his own particular, be more careful to rectify his own failings and imper|fections, than curious in ob&s;erving, cen&s;uring and aggravating, tho&s;e of others. This will lead to the exerci&s;e of mutual forbearance and forgivene&s;s one of another, by which the occa&s;ions of contention will be avoided, and the church pre&s;erved in a &s;tate of peace and tranquility. 1736.</P>

<P>Earne&s;tly recommended, whatever your places and &s;tations in the church may be, that in the mo&s;t weighty and &s;erious manner you often call to remembrance, in all humility of mind, what it was that brought us to be a people; and what is and will be that which will pre&s;erve us &s;uch: That the foundation on which a true Chri&s;tian is built, is the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t; let this therefore direct you in all things, both re&s;pecting your private conver&s;ation, and whatever you do for God in his church: This is the only true means to pre&s;erve you holy and blamele&s;s in the one, as well as &s;erviceable and u&s;eful in the other; in this every one will have a &s;ingle regard to the &s;ervice that comes before him, in monthly and quarterly-meetings, without partiality or re&s;pect of per&s;ons.</P>

<P>FORASMUCH as a godly care is growing among friends in many places, that all things which are un&s;avoury and hurtful may be removed, &s;o that all who profe&s;s the precious truth with us, may come up together in the good order of the go&s;pel, for the furthering of which, and encouraging thereto, it is recommended that weighty and &s;en&s;ible friends, of unblameable conver&s;ations, be cho&s;en in the wi&s;dom of God to vi&s;it the families of friends in his love; and they are de&s;ired to advi&s;e and admoni&s;h, in the peaceable &s;pirit of truth, as occa&s;ion may offer. 1708.</P>
<P>And we be&s;eech you, brethren, let the tender advice of &s;uch as &s;hall under|take &s;o brotherly an office, meet with a kind and open reception, that in the mutual giving and receiving of whole&s;ome coun&s;el and advice, you may co|operate to the help and furtherance of each other's faith, and the reviving our ancient Chri&s;tian te&s;timony. 1752.</P>
<P>Let the Chri&s;tian duty of vi&s;iting the &s;ick be timely remembered and prac|ti&s;ed, it having often left comfort, ea&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s, upon the &s;pirits of many to their very end. 1710.</P>
<P>A weighty concern being livingly impre&s;&s;ed on our minds in this meet|ing, that good &s;ervice may ari&s;e from vi&s;iting the families of our brethren, by rightly concerned friends, we are engaged to recommend it to the &s;en&s;i|ble members of the body, and to monthly and quarterly-meetings, to feel deeply after the pointings of truth; and that as this divine principle opens their way, they may promote this u&s;eful &s;ervice in their re&s;pective meetings, by appointing &s;uitable friends, of either or both &s;exes, who are de&s;ired to proceed therein in the love of the go&s;pel, and under the tendering influence thereof; which we have good cau&s;e to hope may thus be attended with beneficial effects to the vi&s;ited, and with &s;olid &s;atisfaction, and additional experience in the work of truth, to tho&s;e who may be engaged therein. 1773.</P>

<HEAD>MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>WE do exhort friends every where, that in the great concern of mar|riage, whereon much of the comfort and happine&s;s of life depend, they be mindful to proceed in the fear of the Lord, and have an eye to him for coun&s;el and in&s;truction in their choice; the neglect of which has been the ruin of many. 1734.</P>
<P>Parents, who have children to di&s;po&s;e of in marriage, are tenderly advi&s;ed not to make it their fir&s;t or chief care to obtain for them large portions or &s;ettlements of marriage; but rather be careful that their children be joined in marriage with per&s;ons of religious inclinations, &s;uitable di&s;po&s;itions, temper, &s;obriety of manners, and diligence in bu&s;ine&s;s (which are things e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to a comfortable life in a married &s;tate) and carefully to guard again&s;t all mixt marriages, and unequal yoking of their children therein. 1722.</P>
<P>We being &s;en&s;ible of the hurt that may happen by per&s;ons under our pro|fe&s;&s;ion drawing out the affections of one another, without the knowledge or con|&s;ent of parents or guardians, do, for preventing &s;uch mi&s;chief, deliver it as our &s;en&s;e and judgment, that in ca&s;e any member of our &s;ociety &s;hall make application to any woman, being al&s;o a member, with intention or endeavours to entangle her affections, or make &s;uit in order to marriage, without the privity and con&s;ent of her parents or guardians fir&s;t had and obtained, or &s;hall countenance or admit of &s;uch &s;uit or application, whether &s;uch parents or guardians be friends or not; &s;uch per&s;ons ought not to be allowed or permit|ted to proceed in any meeting of friends, in order to the accompli&s;hing &s;uch intended marriage, until they &s;hall have removed the offence, and given &s;atis|faction both to &s;uch parents or guardians, and to the meeting of friends where they belong, by an open and due acknowledgment of the offence, and con|demnation

<P>And it is further advi&s;ed, that after parents and guardians have &s;uffered their children to engage one another in affections, they do not break off up|on any worldly account, but that they wait upon and &s;eek the Lord for their children in propo&s;als of marriage, before they give any encouragement there|unto. 1707.</P>
<P>It is our &s;en&s;e and judgment, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the leadings of truth, for brothers children, &s;i&s;ters children, half brothers children, or half &s;i&s;ters children, to marry together, and for any to marry a fir&s;t cou&s;in's child, or any per&s;on nearer than a &s;econd cou&s;in; and if any notwith&s;tanding &s;hould proceed in marriage together, nearer than a &s;econd cou&s;in, being previou&s;ly cautioned and advi&s;ed again&s;t it, that the monthly-meeting where &s;uch may belong give forth a public te&s;timony again&s;t them, and not receive &s;uch into unity again, until &s;uch meetings are well a&s;&s;ured that they have found a place of &s;incere repentance, and are received in the truth. 1772.</P>
<P>It is our &s;en&s;e and judgment, that no friend be allowed to marry with a decea&s;ed wife's &s;i&s;ter, or decea&s;ed hu&s;band's brother: That friends be careful to give timely advice and admonition again&s;t &s;uch proceedings; and if any &s;hould be reluctant thereto, and proceed in marriage, that they be without delay te&s;tified again&s;t, and be not admitted to member&s;hip again in &s;ociety, until friends be well a&s;&s;ured that they are received in the truth. 1773.</P>
<P>And we do al&s;o, in the name of the Lord, advi&s;e and exhort all young and unmarried people among friends, that they do not make or admit any motion or procedure one with another, upon the account of marriage, without fir&s;t acquainting their parents or guardians therewith, and duly waiting upon them for their con&s;ent and agreement therein. And we al&s;o advi&s;e, that, in the fir&s;t

<P>We having con&s;idered what time &s;hall be held to be too early for propo&s;als of marriage, after the decea&s;e of former hu&s;band or wife; it is our &s;en&s;e and judgment, that it is not advi&s;eable for any friend to make or admit of pro|po&s;als of marriage in le&s;s than twelve months. 1778.</P>
<P>The prudent and Chri&s;tian care that has been maintained among&s;t us, in relation to marriage, ever &s;ince we were a people, having obtained a good report, it is become afre&s;h the concern of this meeting, that the reputation of our religious &s;ociety, and the cau&s;e of truth herein, may &s;till be kept up; and that not only the &s;everal weighty advices of this meeting, in re&s;pect to the proceedings of the parties concerned, and the conduct of their parents and guardians, may be ob&s;erved, but likewi&s;e that as little diver&s;ity as may be may appear among&s;t us in regard to the form and manner of &s;olemnization.</P>
<P>In order therefore that the general practice of the &s;ociety in re&s;pect to mar|riage may be uniform, it is agreed, that the following directions be &s;ent to the &s;everal quarterly-meetings, to be by them communicated to the monthly-meetings, as the rule of their proceedings, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P><PB N="66" REF="019014_0057_0FA9590432C62B40">
The man; <HI>That be intends to take</HI> A. B. <HI>to be his wife, if the Lord permit.</HI> The woman; <HI>That &s;he intends to take</HI> B. C. <HI>to be her hu&s;band, if the Lord per|mit.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The&s;e declarations are to be made, fir&s;t before the womens meeting, and then before the mens meeting. If they have parents or guardians pre|&s;ent, they are to declare their con&s;ent; if ab&s;ent, a certificate or certificates are to be produced, &s;ignifying, <HI>that it is with their con&s;ent the parties do proceed to accompli&s;h their intended marriage,</HI> previous to the declaration of the parties.</P>
<P>After which declaration, no objection appearing, the meeting is to acquaint them, that notice will be taken thereof, and that they may come to the next monthly-meeting for an an&s;wer. An entry is then to be made in both the mens and womens meeting, and two friends out of each to be appointed to enquire into the conver&s;ation and clearne&s;s of the parties; and if there are chil|dren by a former marriage or marriages, to &s;ee that their rights are duly and legally &s;ecured, and to make report to the next monthly-meeting.</P>
<P>When, if no objection has appeared, the parties are to declare before the womens and mens meeting the <HI>continuance of their intention of marriage;</HI> and if nothing yet appears to ob&s;truct, liberty is then to be granted them to &s;olemnize the &s;ame, according to the good order u&s;ed among us.</P>
<P>But if the parties are of different monthly-meetings, the man is fir&s;t to propo&s;e the matter to the monthly-meeting to which he belongs, de&s;iring their certificate, &s;ignifying his clearne&s;s to proceed in marriage with <HI>A.

<P>For &s;olemnizing the marriage, a meeting may be appointed on &s;ome con|venient week-day, as the elders and over&s;eers of the marriage may think pro|per,
<PB N="67" REF="019014_0058_0FA95904C93E0338">of which due notice is to be given; but unle&s;s &s;ome &s;pecial circum&s;tan|ces make it nece&s;&s;ary, it is advi&s;ed to &s;olemnize our marriages at the u&s;ual week-day meeting, at the meeting-hou&s;e to which the woman belongs, unle&s;s leave hath been obtained of the monthly-meeting to &s;olemnize the marriage in &s;ome other meeting-hou&s;e, and the con&s;ent of that meeting likewi&s;e pro|cured.</P>
<P>And it is earne&s;tly recommended, that the con&s;ummation be performed decently, gravely and weightily; and in order thereto, and for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the parties immediately concerned, the monthly-meeting where the marriage is allowed is to appoint two judicious, grave and weighty men, and two &s;uch women friends, to attend the &s;ame, and to &s;it with the parties in the meeting for wor&s;hip, and in a proper time, towards the conclu&s;ion of the meet|ing, &s;peak to the parties to proceed, who are then to &s;tand up, and taking each other by the hand, declare in an audible and &s;olemn manner to the fol|lowing effect; the man fir&s;t, viz. <HI>Friends, I take this my friend</HI> A.

<P>The committee appointed are to take the certificate, and lodge it with the clerk, to be recorded in a book for that purpo&s;e; and after attending at the hou&s;e where the parties retire, to make report to the next monthly-meeting.</P>
<P>Agreed that it be recommended to the quarterly-meetings, that according to the ancient decent practices among friends, they take care that &s;uch men
<PB N="69" REF="019014_0060_0FA95907936C32D0">and women friends, as do make &s;uit or concern them&s;elves in propo&s;als of marriage, one to the other, do not dwell in the &s;ame hou&s;e, from the time they begin to be concerned, until their marriage is con&s;ummated. 1714.</P>
<P>In order to put a &s;top to an undue liberty in contracting marriages with &s;uch as are not of our &s;ociety, it is advi&s;ed, that all parents and guardians of children do take e&s;pecial care, as much as in them lies, to prevent their children from running into &s;uch marriages; and that the friends of each particular meeting, as al&s;o of the monthly-meeting to which &s;uch per&s;ons belong, do in the wi&s;dom and power of truth u&s;e their endeavours to put a &s;top to the &s;aid evil, by admoni&s;hing &s;uch as may attempt to marry as afore&s;aid to de&s;i&s;t from accompli&s;hing the &s;ame; but if they refu&s;e to take coun&s;el, or privately go to marry as afore&s;aid, that then &s;uch per&s;ons be dealt with according to the good order of truth, and judgment fixed upon all who take &s;uch undue liberty. 1719.</P>
<P>This meeting having deliberately con&s;idered the great exerci&s;e brought upon our &s;ociety, by divers in profe&s;&s;ion with us, who contrary to our known principles, and the whole&s;ome di&s;cipline e&s;tabli&s;hed among us, are joined in marriage by the prie&s;t, with per&s;ons either of our own or other per&s;ua&s;ions, do earne&s;tly advi&s;e, that all friends u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to prevent &s;uch marriages, when&s;oever the parties inclinations may come to their know|ledge.</P>
<P>And it is the &s;en&s;e and judgment of this meeting, that where any do marry by the prie&s;t, or in any other manner, contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed rules of the &s;ociety, they &s;hall be dealt with in a &s;pirit of Chri&s;tian love and tenderne&s;s, agreeable to our known di&s;cipline; and that, after the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch offence, their collection &s;hall not be received, nor &s;hall they be relieved in the manner of poor friends, nor be admitted to &s;it in meetings of di&s;cipline, until they are re&s;tored into unity with the monthly-meeting to which they belong.</P>
<P>And we earne&s;tly advi&s;e all friends, that you watch diligently over one another for good, and that you deal in due time with &s;uch offenders, and all
<PB N="70" REF="019014_0061_0FA95907CBED2578">others that walk di&s;orderly, endeavouring to reclaim and re&s;tore them by brotherly admonition and coun&s;el; but where, after patient waiting, you find that your continued labour of love hath not its de&s;ired effect, that you neglect not to te&s;tify again&s;t and di&s;own &s;uch per&s;ons; thereby preventing the reproach and di&s;honour which might be brought on our holy profe&s;&s;ion through their mi&s;conduct, and that the end and de&s;ign of friends in &s;ettling a whole&s;ome di&s;cipline among us may be an&s;wered. 1744, 1783. But as expre&s;s direc|tions cannot be given for each particular ca&s;e that may ari&s;e, the &s;everal monthly-meetings are at liberty to judge how often &s;uch offenders are to be vi&s;ited and dealt with, and in what manner they are to be proceeded again&s;t. Likewi&s;e monthly-meetings are to judge of the &s;incerity of &s;uch acknowledg|ments as may be offered to them, and to accept or reject, as in true wi&s;dom may &s;eem meet. 1768.</P>
<P>This meeting being &s;orrowfully affected, under the con&s;ideration of the great exerci&s;e brought on friends by divers in our &s;ociety entering into marriage with &s;uch as are not of our &s;ociety, or, being in profe&s;&s;ion with us, are mar|ried contrary to our e&s;tabli&s;hed rules; to prevent which, many minutes directing dealing with &s;uch offenders have from time to time been made, but it doth not appear that &s;aid minutes extend to parents and guardians, that may be con&s;enting to or encouraging &s;uch marriages; it is therefore the direction of this meeting, when that appears to be the ca&s;e, that &s;uch parents or guardians, &s;o offending, be dealt with in a &s;pirit of Chri&s;tian love and meek|ne&s;s; and unle&s;s &s;atisfaction be given to the monthly-meeting in which &s;uch circum&s;tance may fall out, that a te&s;timony do go forth for the clearing of truth again&s;t &s;uch offenders. 1752.</P>
<P>We al&s;o recommend the good order of friends relating to marriage, that it be carefully pre&s;erved and daily maintained in the fir&s;t and earlie&s;t proceed|ings leading thereunto, as well as the orderly &s;olemnization thereof; and if any per&s;ons, contrary to the repeated advice and e&s;tabli&s;hed order of friends, &s;hall, under any pretence what&s;oever, pre&s;ume to take one another in any meeting for wor&s;hip, without the con&s;ent of the monthly-meeting to which
<PB N="71" REF="019014_0062_0FA9590B2B159250" MS="y">they belong, &s;uch proceeding being of a clande&s;tine nature, tending to make void the ju&s;t care of friends in that ca&s;e, we advi&s;e that the monthly-meeting do not fail to te&s;tify again&s;t the practice, as well as again&s;t the per&s;ons con|cerned therein. 1730.</P>
<P>And as we have great cau&s;e to believe, that remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in dealing, and weakne&s;s in &s;ome monthly-meetings in accepting &s;uperficial and in&s;incere acknowledgments, have had a great tendency to promote &s;uch marriages, we earne&s;tly advi&s;e, that monthly-meetings be very careful not to accept acknow|ledgments without full &s;atisfaction of the &s;incere repentance of &s;uch tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors, manife&s;ted by a conduct circum&s;pect and con&s;i&s;tent with our religious profe&s;&s;ion. 1783.</P>

This meeting de&s;ires that you, whom the Lord hath gifted with a public te&s;timony for his name and truth, may be careful to attend to the motions of truth, and in it be diligent to vi&s;it the heritage of God in their meetings, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e lea&s;t frequented. 1695.</P>
<P>We farther entreat you, that in all your religious meetings, appointed for the wor&s;hip of Almighty God, you wait in humble reverence for the influence of the word of life; be cautious not to move, in acts of devotion, in your own will; &s;et not forward &s;elf to work, but patiently attend and wait for the gift and enlivening power of the Divine Spirit, without which your perform|ances will be unacceptable, and like tho&s;e of old, of which it was &s;aid, "Who hath required this at your hand?"

<P>As we are fully per&s;uaded, that the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel is not received of man, but by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, according to that apo&s;tolical direction, <Q>As every man hath received the gift, even &s;o mini&s;ter the &s;ame one to another, as good &s;tewards of the manifold grace of God; if any man &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the oracles of God; if any man mini&s;ter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified:</Q> And as this mini&s;try is divine, the motives and inducements thereunto are perfectly di&s;intere&s;ted, and no way mercenary and lucrative, but concurrent to the precept Chri&s;t gave to his apo&s;tles, and immediate fol|lowers, "Freely ye have received, freely give." 1771.</P>
<P>Friends, in their re&s;pective counties and meetings, are earne&s;tly de&s;ired and advi&s;ed to u&s;e prudence and caution, &s;o as not to be impo&s;ed upon by cheats, or impo&s;tors, pretending to mini&s;try or otherwi&s;e; and where there is a doubt or que&s;tion concerning the mini&s;try of any per&s;ons, in that ca&s;e let &s;uch be called upon to &s;hew what certificate they have; and in general it is recom|mended to the monthly and quarterly-meetings, to &s;ee that friends who travel in the work of the mini&s;try do go in the unity of the meetings to which they belong, and with certificates therefrom; and further, that it may become the tender care of the &s;aid meetings to watch over &s;uch as may be young in the mini&s;try, to &s;ee that they walk humbly and wi&s;ely: That as on the one hand,
<PB N="86" REF="019014_0073_0FA95D8BFB10B658">nothing truly tending to the glory of God, and the edification of his church and people, may be di&s;couraged, &s;o on the other, where any thing appears which may make advice nece&s;&s;ary, that the elders of the church, both mini&s;ters and others, do, in the wi&s;dom of God, give their advice thereupon, with due regard to the &s;tate of weakne&s;s and childhood that &s;uch may be in. 1720.</P>
<P>And we do in much love caution tho&s;e friends who are rightly concerned in the work of the mini&s;try, to watch over their own &s;pirits, and not to be over ha&s;ty or cen&s;orious in pa&s;&s;ing judgment re&s;pecting the &s;tate of tho&s; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> hear them; but to manife&s;t that, in the exerci&s;e of their mini&s;try, they are led by the love of God; and that their principal aim is, that they may be in|&s;trumental to admini&s;ter &s;piritual con&s;olation and &s;trength to the churches where they come.</P>
<P>Farther we earne&s;tly exhort, that none would offer to impo&s;e them&s;elves as preachers, in any meeting of friends, who are not them&s;elves faithful again&s;t the payment of prie&s;ts wages, and in ob&s;erving the other branches of our Chri&s;tian te&s;timony. 1745.</P>
<P>We tenderly and with earne&s;tne&s;s advi&s;e all friends, who travel in the work of the mini&s;try, as well as others, that they not only &s;hut their ears again&s;t all private informations of per&s;ons and things, tending to the defamation of particular per&s;ons or families, and to &s;tir up di&s;putes and contentions in meet|ings for di&s;cipline; but al&s;o to rebuke and reprove the per&s;on or per&s;ons, who &s;hall attempt to prejudice their minds with any private informations of that nature. 1752.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of God being be foundation of all true knowledge and expe|rience, both in mini&s;ters and hearers, we earne&s;tly exhort that all would dili|gently wait upon, and mind it: Mini&s;ters, in their public &s;ervices e&s;pecially, ought always to attend clo&s;ely to their &s;everal and peculiar gifts, and mini&s;ter the word faithfully as it is manife&s;ted and revealed to them; ob&s;erving a decent and mode&s;t behaviour in the exerci&s;e of their mini&s;try, and not entan|gling them&s;elves with the affairs of this life, that they may the better an&s;wer the holy warfare in which they are engaged. And let the hearers be watchful
<PB N="87" REF="019014_0074_0FA95D8C4A343690">over their own &s;pirits, and not forwardly judge or cen&s;ure the te&s;timonies which may be delivered among&s;t them; for if they be not very careful and diligent in attending upon the Lord in meetings, they are liable to mi&s;take in the judgment they may pa&s;s on the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Now this being a matter of great moment, for the pre&s;ervation of love and concord in the churches; and knowing the danger and ill con&s;equences which attend an ha&s;ty and cen&s;orious judging of the mini&s;try, we think it nece&s;&s;ary to caution friends not to let their own &s;pirits &s;way them, but let the Spirit of God rule and reign in their hearts; for this will pre&s;erve all in &s;weet|ne&s;s and tenderne&s;s one towards another: The due ob&s;ervance of which will be a great help to mini&s;ters in the di&s;charge of their duty, and the &s;ervice to which they are called.</P>
<P>And we earne&s;tly reque&s;t, that the elders in monthly and quarterly-meet|ings would be ready to help and inform the weak, when &s;uitable opportunities pre&s;ent; and that both mini&s;ters and hearers, pur&s;uing one and the &s;ame end, namely, the glory of God, and the good and welfare one of another, the church may be edified, increa&s;e and flouri&s;h, to the con&s;olation of the faithful.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we advi&s;e mini&s;ters to have it very much at heart, to maintain a perfect harmony and good under&s;tanding with the monthly-meet|ings to which they belong; that as the &s;aid meetings may &s;ometimes find them&s;elves concerned to advi&s;e them, re&s;pecting their conduct in meetings, or otherwi&s;e, they &s;hew them&s;elves ready to hear and receive advice, as well as to teach and in&s;truct.</P>
<P>We further advi&s;e all monthly-meetings, to take great care in giving cer|tificates to tho&s;e who travel, to prevent the unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;ometimes falls on the church, from a weak and un&s;kilful mini&s;try; and let the elders, when they &s;ee occa&s;ion, advi&s;e mini&s;ters to be very prudent in their conduct, not as bu&s;y bodies, nor meddling with family or per&s;onal affairs, in which they are not concerned, or required to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting; that they be very tender of one another's reputation, and of that of friends among whom they travel; neither giving ear to nor &s;preading reports, tending to rai&s;e in the minds of others a

<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, ju&s;t before his a&s;cen&s;ion, commanded his di&s;ciples to wait at Jeru&s;alem, till they were endued with power from on high; knowing their inability, without the &s;en&s;ible feeling of that power, to &s;peak in his name for the conver&s;ion of the nations. It was this power that enabled them to &s;peak boldly in the name of Je&s;us: This alone that made them able mini|&s;ters of Chri&s;t; who&s;e preaching was not with enticing words of man's wi&s;|dom, but in the demon&s;tration of the Spirit, and with power.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing many of us have experienced much &s;piritual con&s;olation, by waiting in &s;ilence and humbly depending upon the Lord alone, we exhort friends, that when met together for religious wor&s;hip, they labour to feel their minds ab&s;tracted from vi&s;ible objects, into a true &s;tillne&s;s and nothing|ne&s;s of &s;elf; wherein the teachings of the Holy Spirit are witne&s;&s;ed by humble and contrite &s;ouls.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a waiting &s;tate, you will have a true reli&s;h and &s;avour of the mini|&s;try of tho&s;e who are rightly concerned by the &s;ame &s;pirit, to labour in word and doctrine among you. 1738.</P>
<P>We earne&s;tly caution and intreat all &s;uch among you, as find them&s;elves concerned in Chri&s;tian love to exhort and admoni&s;h others, that they be e&s;pecially careful of their own conduct; that by circum&s;pect walking in all holine&s;s of life and conver&s;ation, they may become living examples of the puri|ty and excellence of the advices they recommend. 1748.</P>
<P>You that are elders and over&s;eers in the church, and concerned in the maintenance of good order and pre&s;ervation of di&s;cipline, keep your own hands clean, and garments un&s;potted, that you may rebuke with authority, and being cloathed with the meekne&s;s and gentlene&s;s of the Lamb, may &s;tedfa&s;tly per|&s;evere in the &s;upport of that te&s;timony committed to you, that when the Great Shepherd &s;hall appear, you may come before him with reverent a&s;&s;urance,
<PB N="89" REF="019014_0076_0FA95E33E4105C60">and receive the reward of <Q>Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant, enter into the joy of thy Lord.</Q> 1753.</P>
<P>As to the elders among you, and &s;uch whom God, having endued with knowledge and experience of the clean&s;ing operations of his Spirit, hath concerned to mini&s;ter to others, let them adorn the doctrine of the go&s;pel, by &s;hewing, out of a good conver&s;ation, their works with meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom: Such as the&s;e, being cloathed with humility, and exemplary to the flock whom the feed; not by con&s;traint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; are worthy of double honour, and to be highly e&s;teemed in the church of Chri&s;t. 1751.</P>
<P>As the Lord is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed effectually to touch the hearts of many of the youth, and prepare them for the reception of his heavenly gifts, where|by many are called to the work of the mini&s;try; and well knowing it is a due attention to the gift, and waiting for the heavenly power and life to di&s;|charge them&s;elves therein, which has ever proved a ble&s;&s;ing to the particular, and the churches in general; we earne&s;tly recommend, that the elders and &s;en&s;ible &s;olid friends do watch over &s;uch in an holy concern for their and the churches good; that the weak and tender may be encouraged in a faithful di&s;charge of their duty, and where a forward &s;pirit appears, that would lead into many words out of the power and life, &s;uch may be properly admoni&s;hed in the meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom, that each may &s;peak the language of truth, by the ability which the Lord only gives; and that the monthly-meetings do not indulge any to travel and appoint meetings too &s;oon, for many have been hurt thereby. 1753.</P>
<P>We recommend the apo&s;tolic advice, "Lay hands on no man &s;uddenly," for we have cau&s;e to believe that injudicious encouragement hath tended to promote an un&s;ound mini&s;try in &s;ome places. It is therefore recommended, that the approved mini&s;ters and elders, in the &s;everal monthly-meetings, would tenderly advi&s;e tho&s;e who come forth in public te&s;timony, to wait patiently under a deep con&s;ideration of their &s;tate of infancy and childhood, without de&s;iring to be introduced into the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, until their
<PB N="90" REF="019014_0077_0FA95E358EF27638">fruits afford &s;ufficient evidence of their qualifications for &s;o important a &s;er|vice, and they approved of by the monthly and quarterly-meetings to which they belong; that &s;uch young mini&s;ters be reported to their monthly and quarterly-meetings; which, upon &s;olid and deliberate con&s;ideration, may, as in the wi&s;dom of truth &s;hall &s;eem meet, recommend them to the &s;elect-meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, in order to their becoming regular members of tho&s;e meetings. 1773.</P>
<P>Looking into the &s;tate of this part of the &s;ociety, which &s;tands in a more con&s;picuous point of view than the more private members, the nece&s;&s;ity of their being en&s;amples to the flock appears exceeding great, particularly in a diligent attendance of all our meetings for &s;olemn wor&s;hip and the di&s;cipline of the church, and therein to be very deep and weighty in &s;pirit, labouring with an ardour of &s;oul &s;uited to the occa&s;ion, for the ari&s;ing of the ancient &s;pring of life; which of a truth is the crown of our a&s;&s;emblies, and the ground of our joy and rejoicing in him, and one in another: It being this alone which pre&s;erves living, fre&s;h and active members in the church of Chri&s;t, who are enabled to communicate a degree of warmth to the ri&s;ing youth, and tho&s;e of le&s;s experience in this mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary exerci&s;e; not only in word and doctrine, but al&s;o in &s;ilent, humble waiting on God, for the renewings of help day by day.</P>
<P>That where it &s;hall appear, upon due in&s;pection made, that any member &s;hall or do neglect or omit the due attendance of their meetings for wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline, through &s;loth, indolence, love of the world, lukewarmne&s;s in religion or other in&s;ufficient cau&s;e, that each monthly-meeting take care, that all &s;uch be timely vi&s;ited in love, and acquainted with the de&s;ire and mind of friends in that ca&s;e, and admoni&s;hed to faithfulne&s;s therein. And if, not|with&s;tanding the due Chri&s;tian labour and admonition, he, &s;he or they, &s;hall continue in the &s;aid neglect or omi&s;&s;ion; if a mini&s;ter, his or her public te&s;ti|mony be denied; and if an elder, he or &s;he be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from that &s;tation. 1770.</P>

Advi&s;ed to have a godly care of judging or contradicting one another in pub|lic meetings, or &s;hewing any marks or &s;igns of divi&s;ion therein, among mini&s;ters or others; it being of a very pernicious con&s;equence to bring blame or contempt upon the mini&s;try, and a great hurt to our youth and others. 1716.</P>
<P>This meeting taking under their &s;erious con&s;ideration the beauty and credit of keeping decency and good order in our meetings for wor&s;hip, advi&s;es friends every where to avoid public oppo&s;ition to a mini&s;ter not di&s;owned by the monthly or quarterly-meeting to which he or &s;he &s;hall belong, by keeping on their hats in time of prayer, or any other tokens of di&s;union.</P>

<P N="1">1. Are mini&s;ters and elders careful duly to attend all their meetings for wor&s;hip and dicipline, bringing with them as many of their families as they can? And are they good examples in humble waiting therein, not giving way to drow&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P N="2">2. Are mini&s;ters &s;ound in word and doctrine, careful to mini&s;ter in the ability God gives and thereby kept from burthening the living?</P>
<P N="3">3. Are the lives and conver&s;ations of mini&s;ters and elders clean and blamele&s;s among&s;t men? Are they in unity one with another, and with the meeting they belong to, harmoniou&s;ly labouring together for truth's honour, and careful to give no ju&s;t occa&s;ion of offence to any?</P>
<P N="4">4. Do they rule their own hou&s;es well, bringing up their families in plain|ne&s;s which truth requires, in dre&s;s, language and true moderation? And are they good examples in tho&s;e re&s;pects them&s;elves?</P>
<P N="5">5. Are they peace-makers in families and in the church, not concerned in rai&s;ing or &s;preading evil reports, nor bu&s;y bodies where they have no pro|per bu&s;ine&s;s?</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="95" REF="019014_0082_0FA95E3A54449170">
6. Are they careful to maintain the di&s;cipline in every part thereof, not even to hide their own families from truth's judgment, if occa&s;ion be given, but impartially to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice as faithful &s;ervants?</P>
<P N="7">7. Do any travel abroad as mini&s;ters, without being fir&s;t recommended to and accepted by the quarterly-meeting as &s;uch? And do any appoint meet|ings out of the limits of the quarterly-meeting they belong to, without a cer|tificate from the monthly-meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s, or the concurrence thereof?</P>
<P>It is further earne&s;tly and affectionately recommended that mini&s;ters and elders watch over one another for good, to help tho&s;e who are young in the mini&s;try in the right line, di&s;couraging forward &s;pirits that run into words without life and power, advi&s;ing again&s;t affectation of tones and ge&s;tures, and every thing that would hurt their &s;ervice; yet encouraging the humble, care|ful traveller, &s;peaking a word in &s;ea&s;on to them that are weary. And let all dwell in that which gives ability to labour &s;ucce&s;sfully in the church of Chri&s;t, adorning the doctrine they deliver to others, being examples of the believers in word, in conver&s;ation, in charity, in &s;pirit, in faith, and in purity.</P>

<HEAD>MONTHLY-MEETINGS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the love of Chri&s;t we earne&s;tly exhort you to watch diligently over the flock of God, and deal in due time, and in a &s;pirit of Chri&s;tian love and tenderne&s;s, with all &s;uch as walk di&s;orderly among&s;t you, in order to reclaim and re&s;tore them by brotherly coun&s;el and admonition; and when, after patient waiting, you find that your Chri&s;tian labour of love hath not its de&s;ired effect, you neglect not to te&s;tify again&s;t and di&s;own &s;uch per&s;ons, and thereby prevent the reproach and di&s;honour which may be brought upon our holy profe&s;&s;ion through their means, that the end and de&s;ign of our whole&s;ome di&s;cipline may be an&s;wered.</P>
<P>We think it both un&s;ea&s;onable and di&s;honourable, when per&s;ons apply to monthly-meetings on account of marriage, or for relief in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity or any &s;imilar occa&s;ion, then to object to them &s;uch offences as the meeting, through neglect of their own duty, have &s;uffered long to pa&s;s by them unre|proved and unnoticed. 1743.</P>
<P>It is the ancient and con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of friends, that any per&s;on denied by a monthly-meeting, is adjudged as di&s;owned by friends, and to &s;tand and re|main in that &s;tate, till by his repentance, or by the rever&s;al of &s;uch denial by a &s;uperior meeting, he is reconciled to friends, or rein&s;tated in member|&s;hip among them, with which this meeting hath unity, and therefore confirms the &s;ame. 1727.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on commits an offence, as &s;oon as it comes to the knowledge of the meeting wherein he re&s;ides, he not being a member thereof, that meet|ing &s;hall acquaint the meeting of which he is a member therewith.</P>
<P>The meeting of which he is a member &s;hall then proceed to vi&s;it and deal with him, unle&s;s by rea&s;on of di&s;tance it be not convenient; in which

<P>If a te&s;timony of denial be i&s;&s;ued, a copy thereof &s;hall be &s;ent to the meet|ing in the compa&s;s of which the offender re&s;ides, who &s;hall acquaint him therewith, and read it in a public meeting, if they &s;ee meet, and acknowledge the receipt thereof to the meeting that &s;ent it.</P>
<P>If the offender remove after dealing be commenced, the meeting that had him under their care &s;hall continue the &s;ame, if he be equally within their reach, or otherwi&s;e write to the meeting into the compa&s;s of which he is removed, which meeting &s;hall proceed therein, and report to the meeting of which he is a member, who &s;hall receive his acknowledgment, or proceed to deny him as afore&s;aid. But if the monthly-meeting where the offence is committed judge the ca&s;e to be of &s;uch a nature as to require their more &s;peedy dealing, and even di&s;owning the offender, for the clearing of truth according to our ancient care and practice; they are at liberty &s;o to do, giving the meeting the offender did belong to as early notice thereof as they can. 1747, 1782.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e offenders &s;hall remove to places not within the acknowledged limits of any monthly-meeting, it is agreed that they &s;hall be under the care of the meeting to which they are the neare&s;t &s;ituated.</P>
<P>If the offender cannot be found after rea&s;onable enquiry, the meeting to which he belongs, on notice thereof, &s;hall i&s;&s;ue a te&s;timony again&s;t him, if the nature of the ca&s;e require it, and acquaint the other meeting or meetings thereof.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on is di&s;owned by a monthly-meeting of which he was a pro|per member, and afterwards removes into, and re&s;ides within, the compa&s;s of another meeting, he having come to repentance, and being de&s;irous to be re&s;tored into unity, the nece&s;&s;ary acknowledgment &s;hould be made to the monthly-meeting by which he was di&s;owned; which acknowledgment being
<PB N="98" REF="019014_0085_0FA95E3CB4D131C8">received and accepted, he &s;hall be deemed a member of the &s;aid meeting 1763.</P>
<P>We recommend to friends in their &s;everal monthly-meetings, to take e&s;pe|cial care to appoint proper, prudent and judicious friends, to vi&s;it their brethren in their families, to inform, advi&s;e or admoni&s;h, pur&s;uant to former advices; and that &s;uch friends labour faithfully in a &s;pirit of love, and in the meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom, to convince the judgments of their re&s;pective members of the nece&s;&s;ity of their coming up with their brethren in practice, agreeable to our Chri&s;tian principle, that &s;o the &s;everal branches of the te&s;timony, which truth hath given our ancients and us to bear, may be maintained in|violate. 1733, 1751.</P>
<P>It is recommended, that the book of di&s;cipline be pre&s;ent in all our month|ly, quarterly and yearly-meetings, that the &s;ame may be con&s;ulted as occa&s;ion requires; and as opportunity offers, &s;uch portions thereof be read in each monthly-meeting, the women being pre&s;ent, as the elders, over&s;eers or other concerned friends, may from time to time think proper, for the in&s;truction, help and furtherance of the young and ri&s;ing generation, and &s;uch as may not otherwi&s;e be conver&s;ant or acquainted therewith.</P>

<P>Advi&s;ed that friends, in making their wills, have a &s;trict regard to ju&s;tice and equity, and be not actuated by caprice and prejudice, to the injury of tho&s;e who may have a rea&s;onable expectation from their kindred and near connexions; nor carry any re&s;entment, though occa&s;ion may have been given or taken, to the grave, remembering we all &s;tand in need of mercy and forgivene&s;s.

<P>WITH re&s;pect to the poor among&s;t us, it ought to be con&s;idered, that the poor, both parents and children, are of our family, and ought not to be turned off to any others for their &s;upport or education; and although &s;ome may think the poor a burthen, yet be it remembered, when our poor are well provided for, and walk orderly, they are an ornament to our &s;ociety; and the rich &s;hould con&s;ider it is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive, and that he who giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord, who will repay. 1718.</P>
<P>As mercy, compa&s;&s;ion and charity, are eminently required in this new-covenant di&s;pen&s;ation we are under; &s;o, re&s;pecting the poor and indigent among us, and to &s;ee there be no beggar in our I&s;rael, it is the advice of this meeting that all poor friends be taken due care of, and none of them &s;ent to the town or pari&s;h to be relieved; and that nothing be wanting for their nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply; which has been according to our ancient practice and te&s;ti|mony. And it has long been of good report, that we have not only main|tained our own poor, but al&s;o contributed our &s;hare to the poor of the re&s;pec|tive towns and pari&s;hes wherein we dwell. 1720.</P>
<P>Advi&s;ed that where friends want ability in the world, their monthly and quarterly-meetings a&s;&s;i&s;t them, that the children of the poor may have due help of education, in&s;truction, and nece&s;&s;ary learning; and that the children both of the rich and the poor may early be provided with u&s;eful employments, that they may not grow up in idlene&s;s, loo&s;ene&s;s and vice; but that being &s;ea&s;oned with the truth, taught our holy &s;elf-denying way, and &s;anctified of God, they may become a reputation to our holy profe&s;&s;ion, the comfort of their hone&s;t parents, in&s;trumental to the glory of God, and the good of the &s;ucceeding generations. 1709.</P>

<HEAD>QUERIES.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the &s;en&s;e and judgment of this meeting, that it will tend to the bene|fit of the &s;ociety, that the following queries be &s;ent to the &s;everal quar|terly, monthly and preparative-meetings, with the advice to be read preced|ing, as follows:</P>
<P>It is recommended that all contention and per&s;onal reflexions be kept out of our meetings: That all friends be careful to keep out of heats and pa&s;|&s;ions, and doubtful di&s;putations; and that we &s;uffer no turbulent, contentious per&s;on among&s;t us, in ordering and managing the affairs of truth; but that the &s;ame be managed in the peaceable &s;pirit and wi&s;dom of Je&s;us, with decency, forbearance and love, to each other.</P>
<P N="1">1. Are all meetings for religious wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline duly attended, the hour ob&s;erved; and are friends pre&s;erved from &s;leeping, or any other unbecoming behaviour therein?</P>
<P N="2">2. Is love and unity maintained among&s;t you, as becomes the followers of Chri&s;t? Are tale-bearing, back-biting, and evil reports, di&s;couraged? And where any differences ari&s;e, are endeavours u&s;ed &s;peedily to end them?</P>
<P N="3">3. Are friends careful to bring up tho&s;e under their direction in plain|ne&s;s of &s;peech, behaviour and apparel? To re&s;train them from reading per|nicious books, and the corrupt conver&s;ation of the world? Are they good examples herein them&s;elves?

<P N="4">4. Are friends careful to avoid the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, except for medicine, or upon extraordinary and nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions? The unnece&s;&s;ary frequenting of taverns, and places of public re&s;ort? And to keep in true

Do their children freely partake of learning, to fit them for bu&s;ine&s;s? And are they, and other friends children, placed among friends?</P>

<HEAD>SCRIPTURES.</HEAD>
<P>RECOMMENDED as an incumbent duty on friends, to cau&s;e their children to be frequent in reading the Holy Scriptures, and in ob&s;erv|ing to them the examples of &s;uch children, as in Scripture are recorded to have early learned the fear of the Lord, and hearkened to his coun&s;el: In&s;truct|ing them in the fear and dread of the Lord; planting upon their &s;pirits impre&s;&s;ions of reverence towards God, from whom they have their daily &s;upport; &s;hewing them they ought not to offend him; but love, &s;erve, and honour him, in who&s;e hand all ble&s;&s;ings are. 1709.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o &s;eriou&s;ly advi&s;ed, that no friends &s;uffer romances, play-books, or other vain and idle pamphlets, in their hou&s;es or families, which tend to cor|rupt the minds of youth; but, in&s;tead thereof, that they excite them to the reading the Holy Scriptures, and other religious books. Let the Holy Scriptures be early taught our youth, diligently &s;earched, and &s;eriou&s;ly read by friends, with due regard to the Holy Spirit from whence they came, and by which they are truly opened: For they contain excellent doctrine, rules and precepts, divine and moral. 1720.</P>
<P>And, dear friends, ina&s;much as the Holy Scriptures are the external means of conveying and pre&s;erving to us an account of the things mo&s;t &s;urely to be believed concerning the coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the fle&s;h, and the fulfilling the prophe&s;ies relating thereto; we therefore recommend to all friends, e&s;pecially elders in the church, and ma&s;ters of families <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they would, both by example and advice, impre&s;s on the minds of the younger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reverent e&s;teem of tho&s;e &s;acred writings, and advi&s;e them to a frequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and meditating therein; and that you would, at proper times and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, when you find your minds rightly di&s;po&s;ed thereunto, give the youth to under|&s;tand,
<PB N="130" REF="019014_0111_0FA95E59CBE72A38">that the &s;ame good experience of the work of &s;anctification, through the operations of the Spirit of God, which the Holy Scriptures plentifully bear te&s;timony to, is to be witne&s;&s;ed by believers in all generations, as well as by tho&s;e in the fir&s;t ages of Chri&s;tianity; in which ca&s;e &s;ome account of our own experience will be helpful to them; and this we recommend as the mo&s;t ef|fectual means of begetting and e&s;tabli&s;hing in their minds a firm belief of the Chri&s;tian doctrine in general, as well as the nece&s;&s;ity of the aid and help of the operations of the Holy Spirit of God in the hearts of men in particular, con|tained in that mo&s;t excellent book the Bible; and for the pre&s;erving them from being defiled with the many pernicious notions and principles, contrary to &s;uch &s;ound doctrine, which are at this time indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed in this country, to the reproach of the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion in general. 1728.</P>
<P>And in order to render the&s;e advices more effectual, we further tenderly recommend to all heads of families, that they do frequently call their chil|dren and &s;ervants together; and, in a &s;olemn way, audibly read, or cau&s;e to be read, the Holy Scriptures; and in &s;o doing that they humbly wait upon God with their families, for in&s;truction and coun&s;el to them re&s;pecting Chri&s;tian faith and practice, according to the former advices of this meeting.</P>

<HEAD>TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED that none launch into trading, and worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, beyond what they can manage honourably and with reputation; &s;o that they may keep their words with all men, that their yea may prove yea indeed, and their nay, nay; for what&s;oever is otherwi&s;e cometh of evil; and that they u&s;e few words in their dealings, le&s;t they bring di&s;honour to God through their forwardne&s;s; and &s;uch as make them&s;elves guilty, by thus di&s;honouring God, and the holy profe&s;&s;ion of his name and truth, are for judgment, and the judgment of truth ought to be &s;et over them, that tho&s;e who walk and abide in the truth may be clear of their iniquities. 1675, 1688.</P>
<P>It is advi&s;ed, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that the payment of ju&s;t debts be not delayed by any profe&s;&s;ing truth, beyond the time promi&s;ed and agreed upon; nor occa&s;ion given of complaint to tho&s;e they deal with, by their backward|ne&s;s of payment, where no time is limited; nor any to overcharge them&s;elves with too much trading, or with bu&s;ine&s;s beyond their capacities and abilities to manage in the truth.</P>
<P>It is the advice of this meeting, to the &s;everal quarterly-meetings, that care may be taken, that &s;ub&s;tantial friends be appointed to vi&s;it every family among&s;t us, where they think there is occa&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect they are going backwards in their worldly e&s;tate, in a manner that may be to the ill example of others, or prejudice of creditors; and to enquire and &s;ee how things are with them, advi&s;e them in tenderne&s;s according to our di&s;cipline; and if they do not manife&s;t a di&s;po&s;ition to take &s;uch advice, and comply with it, then to give them go&s;pel order, and proceed therein again&s;t them.</P>
<P>And, dear friends, this meeting being under an holy care and deep concern, for the glory of God, the honour of our holy profe&s;&s;ion, and &s;afety and

<P>Advi&s;ed that &s;uch be dealt with as trade by &s;ea or land, or buy, bargain or contract, beyond their abilities; and &s;uch as keep not their words, pro|mi&s;es or engagements, in their dealings; and do not pay or &s;atisfy their ju&s;t debts, according to time agreed on. The&s;e being a reproach to truth, and a manife&s;t injury and inju&s;tice, advice to all &s;uch &s;hould be &s;peedily given, and if they do not reclaim, amend and duly an&s;wer, they are to be further proceeded again&s;t. 1719.</P>
<P>It is earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that all friends every where be very careful to avoid all inordinate pur&s;uits after the things of this world, by &s;uch ways and means as depend too much upon the uncertain probabilities of hazardous enter|prizes; but rather labour to content them&s;elves with &s;uch a plain way and manner of living, as is mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;elf-denying principle of truth which we profe&s;s, and which is mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ducive to that tranquility of mind that is requi&s;ite to a religious conduct through this trouble&s;ome world. 1724.</P>
<P>Advi&s;ed that a con&s;cientious care dwell on all our minds, not only to be ju&s;t in our trade and dealing, neither deceiving the buyer in what we &s;ell, or fal&s;ifying the balances; but that we keep to our promi&s;es, and pay our debts in due time; not exceeding our circum&s;tances or rea&s;onable expectations in our way of living, nor engaging in hazardous things more out of vanity than nece&s;&s;ity. And it is our advice, when any profe&s;&s;ing truth finds him&s;elf not able to comply with his contracts, that he call his creditors, and declare his condition in time, and by &s;hewing the hone&s;ty of his intentions may clear the
<PB N="145" REF="019014_0120_0FA95E62CC9BF378">&s;ociety from any &s;candalous imputations; and where any &s;o circum&s;tanced refu&s;es to do &s;o, let him be duly cen&s;ured. And, on the other hand, we are to remind you to take heed and beware of covetou&s;ne&s;s; this grand enemy of the love and faith of Je&s;us being too apt to prevail in this time and place of outward tranquility, wherein we are a people &s;ignally ble&s;&s;ed of God. 1737.</P>
<P>It is the &s;en&s;e and judgment of this meeting, that no per&s;ons who &s;hall fail of paying their ju&s;t debts ought to be admitted to act in meetings for bu&s;ine&s;s, or join with friends in collecting for the poor and the &s;ervice of the church, until they have made &s;atisfaction to the monthly-meeting they belong to, and done what is in their power to take off the reproach they have, by their imprudent conduct, brought on our Chri&s;tian principle. 1737.</P>
<P>We are al&s;o engaged to caution every individual again&s;t imprudently enter|ing into joint &s;ecurities with others; for, by the&s;e practices, many innocent wives and children have been inevitably and unexpectedly involved in ruinous and deplorable circum&s;tances. We therefore earne&s;tly de&s;ire friends to keep &s;trictly on their guard, that none, through any &s;pecious pretences of rendering acts of friend&s;hip to others with &s;afety to them&s;elves, may ri&s;que their own peace and reputation, and the &s;ecurity of their families: In order hereunto, we recommend this &s;alutary advice of the wi&s;e man to their e&s;pecial notice and regard: <Q>Be not thou one of them that &s;trike hands, or of them that are &s;ureties for debts. If thou ha&s;t nothing to pay, why &s;hould he take away thy bed from under thee?</Q> Prov. xxii. 26, 27. 1771.</P>
<P>It is earne&s;tly recommended, that friends frequently in&s;pect the &s;tate of their affairs, and frequently &s;ettle their accounts; and when any find them|&s;elves unable or have not more than &s;ufficient to pay their ju&s;t debts, that they immediately di&s;clo&s;e their circum&s;tances to &s;ome judicious friends, or principal creditors, and take their advice how to act, and be particularly careful not to pay one creditor in preference to another. 1782.</P>

<P>And it is advi&s;ed, that men and women be attentive and ready in their monthly and quarterly-meetings to unite their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to each other, when it appears u&s;eful and be&s;t, whether expre&s;sly de&s;ired or not; and that te&s;timo|nies of denial be read, approved and minuted, in both meetings, and then be &s;igned by the clerk of the mens meeting, if re&s;pecting a man, and if a woman, by the clerk of the womens meeting.</P>

<HEAD>YEARLY-MEETING.</HEAD>
<P>THE good and ble&s;&s;ed intent and end of this and all our a&s;&s;emblies is, with the Lord's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for his honour, in the promoting and main|taining of our Chri&s;tian &s;ociety and religion, in life and practice, in all the parts and branches thereof. 1695.</P>
<P>It is the fervent de&s;ire of this meeting, that the bu&s;ine&s;s and concerns there|of be &s;olidly, in the fear of God, managed and carried on, without contention or &s;triving; and with as few words, and in as pertinent expre&s;&s;ions to the matter in hand, as may be, for expediting the affairs thereof without lo&s;s of time, or any ways di&s;ordering the meeting; but one at a time &s;peaking, and &s;tanding up, that all things may be done decently, and in good order. 1710.</P>
<P>That the quarterly-meetings be careful annually to depute &s;uch friends to attend the &s;ervice of the yearly-meeting, as are men fearing God, of good conver&s;ation, weighty &s;pirits, prudent and &s;incere, well acquainted with the affairs of truth, and diligent attenders of meetings for di&s;cipline at home; who&s;e practice and conver&s;ation is an&s;werable to the te&s;timony they profe&s;s to bear; men known to be faithful and con&s;cientious. 1714, 1733.</P>
<P>Advi&s;ed that no repre&s;entatives withdraw from the meeting before it ends, without leave fir&s;t reque&s;ted and granted, that the &s;ervice of the meeting may not be neglected. 1709.</P>
<P>It behoveth us, in all &s;uch our a&s;&s;emblies, to have our minds &s;ea&s;oned with a &s;en&s;e of the weight of the work we are engaged in, and to exert our&s;elves with an holy zeal for the cau&s;e of God, and the promotion of his truth; care|fully watching again&s;t an exalted &s;pirit, which would &s;trive for ma&s;tery and dominion, labouring in love and meekne&s;s of wi&s;dom to be helpful one unto another, that <Q>Nothing may be done through &s;trife, or vain-glory; but, in
<PB N="154" REF="019014_0126_0FA95E6A5FA4B928">lowline&s;s of mind, let each e&s;teem other better than them&s;elves.</Q> Phil. ii. 3. 1747.</P>
<P>Agreed that at the clo&s;e of the yearly-meeting for wor&s;hip all the repre|&s;entatives retire, and agree upon a clerk for the pre&s;ent year; and when the meeting of bu&s;ine&s;s is entered by the former clerk, or in his ab&s;ence the clerk of the meeting for &s;ufferings, the clerk named by the repre&s;entatives being approved is to be entered, and then to take his &s;eat at the table, and proceed on the bu&s;ine&s;s before the meeting.</P>
<P>Agreed that all papers that come before this meeting, as well as quarterly and monthly-meetings, except &s;uch as are from immediate corre&s;pondents, be fir&s;t examined by a committee, to be from time to time appointed, before they be read up in our meetings.</P>

<HEAD>YOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>WE earne&s;tly be&s;eech our friends, and e&s;pecially the youth among us, to avoid all &s;uch couver&s;ation as may tend to draw out their minds into the fooli&s;h and wicked pa&s;times with which this age aboundeth (par|ticularly balls, gaming-places, hor&s;e-races, and play-hou&s;es) tho&s;e nur&s;eries of debauchery and wickedne&s;s, the burthen and grief of the &s;ober part of other &s;ocieties, as well as of our own; practices wholly unbecoming a people under the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, contrary to the tenor of the doctrine of the go&s;pel, and the examples of the be&s;t men in the earlie&s;t ages of the church. For as "Evil communications corrupt good manners," &s;o it is the duty of men profe&s;&s;ing religion, who live in this world in order to obtain a better, not only to <Q>Shake their hands from holding of bribes, and &s;top their ears from hearing of blood,</Q> but al&s;o "to &s;hut their eyes from &s;eeing of evil." I&s;ai. xxxiii. 15. 1739.</P>
<P>And dearly beloved youth, in an humble &s;en&s;e of the continued vi&s;itations of the Father's love, and experience of their ble&s;&s;ed effects, we entreat you, by the mercies of God receive its holy impre&s;&s;ions, &s;ubmit to its di&s;cipline; this will pre&s;erve you from the deplorable effect of Satan's transformations, in&s;pire you with holy re&s;olutions, and enable you to maintain them in all godly conver&s;ation, and purity of life and faith, adorning the doctrine of the go&s;pel by a blamele&s;s demeanour. True peace will then flow as a river in your own minds; and the fruits of the tree of righteou&s;ne&s;s be brought forth to your inexpre&s;&s;ible con&s;olation in Chri&s;t, the revival of Zion's beauty, the rebuilding of her de&s;olations; &s;o that, by and through you, &s;he may yet appear beautiful to the &s;incere-hearted, but to her enemies terrible as an army with banners. 1751.</P>
