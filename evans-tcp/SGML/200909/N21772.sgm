<HEAD>THE FEMALE CHARACTER VINDICATED.</HEAD>
<P>INJUDICIOUS cen&s;ure rarely ef|fects reformation&mdash;the &s;hafts of ridicule are formidable to the votories of folly&mdash; but unle&s;s aimed by accurate judgment and pointed by &s;kill, prove not only un|availing and futile, but al&s;o wound the intere&s;t of humanity: Wit rolled forth without di&s;cretion, often, nay always, precipitates the author into ba&s;e invective and &s;currilous &s;lander. It is really to be lamented, that in every age our be&s;t &s;atiri|cal writers have indulged them&s;elves in this, and laid a&s;ide all candour, mode&s;ty, and ju&s;tice, in treating of the <HI>fair &s;ex,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="028664_0003_0FDA3E1E762A2278">and have uniformly degraded their brilliant effu&s;ions of wit and humour, with the tarte&s;t &s;neers of malignity. The moro&s;e morali&s;t, the &s;narling cynic, and bigotted enthu&s;ia&s;t, all concur in maintaining opin|ions unfavourable to the fairer half of the human race. How ba&s;e, how degrading in a gentleman, to indulge him&s;elf in in|humanity where he knows no oppo&s;ition will be made! The blacke&s;t dye is infi|nitely too white to draw his portrait&mdash;he dares not &s;tep forth and a&s;per&s;e characters where he knows he will be bravely oppo&s;|ed&mdash;but &s;neaks, with the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, and &s;tabs the unarmed&mdash;he is bold and intrepid where no danger appears&mdash;he is ba&s;ely in|human where his opponent cannot re&s;i&s;t&mdash; &s;uch is the character of every coward&mdash; Recoil O humanity at the &s;cene! Weep O true and virtuous valour! In the aera when bodily &s;trength was the &s;ole <HI>virtue</HI> and criterion of merit, then I grant wo|men were ju&s;tly con&s;idered as inferior&mdash; but now, when it is the mental accom|pli&s;hments that form the <HI>man</HI>&mdash;now, when real merit is the criterion of greatne&s;s, why &s;hould the artillery of &s;arca&s;m be levelled at the citadel of &s;emale excel|lence? Who can read the writings of
<PB N="5" REF="028664_0004_0FDA3DFE18F7E438">Swift upon this &s;ubject, without perceiv|ing his feelings rai&s;ed, even to perfect ab|horrence? Who can realize the &s;atires of the immortal Young, as &s;entiments really candid, without lamenting his irrecovera|ble di&s;grace? In his Night thoughts, he draws the character of his wife and daugh|ter with the pencil of perfection, and re|flects honour on the whole &s;ex. In his Satires on Women, he de&s;cends to &s;curri|lity and invective, and (pardon the expre&s;|&s;ion) holds forth ideas familiar only to the debauchee&mdash;how does rea&s;on, how does charity recoil at viewing a man of pro|found &s;en&s;e, of con&s;ummate erudition, and of renowned piety, expo&s;ing tho&s;e unju&s;t|ly who cannot vindicate their cau&s;e. It really &s;hews the want of true greatne&s;s for a man, when h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> has exaulted his fund of ideas, to &s;ink to this la&s;t refort of <HI>dupe,</HI> and make tho&s;e who are the grand link in the &s;ocial chain, the objects of indi&s;|criminate cen&s;ure. Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">re men of cha|racter indulge them&s;elves in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">s, they &s;hould accurately inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of the difference between the tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">xes, and prove that they are natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ally more deprav|ed, inferior, and unworthy our friendly in|tercour&s;e. The cau&s;e of the di&s;parity be|tween
<PB N="6" REF="028664_0005_0FDA3E219A67EB10">the two &s;exes, appears &s;o obvious to need but little explication; which I conceive to exi&s;t wholly in the degree and method of their education.&mdash;"'Tis education forms the tender mind."</P>
<P>That the ladies are as capable of eru|dition as the men, cannot be denied by tho&s;e capable of ob&s;ervation&mdash;only vi&s;it a common Engli&s;h &s;chool&mdash;does not incon|te&s;tible experience declare, that there the ladies make the mo&s;t accurate and rapid progre&s;s? It is futile and ridiculous to a&s;|&s;ert, that the ladies are capable of a certain degree of education only&mdash;and that a de|gree far below the abilities of men&mdash;with more apparent propriety it may be a&s;&s;ert|ed of him who roves the de&s;ert with the le&s;s &s;avage brute.</P>
<P>The education of the females has been &s;uch as could &s;carcely fail to deba&s;e the mind, and at the &s;ame time to inflate it with vanity. Romances generally con&s;ti|tute the whole of their library, which, as to improvement, are empty as the wind, they are good when kept in proper bounds but tend to engro&s;s the whole attention, vitiate the ta&s;te, and render <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">he peru&s;er as full of &s;elf-importance as though &s;he was the very character before and to whom all
<PB N="7" REF="028664_0006_0FDA3DFFB48C9F18">adoration and apparent devotion &s;hould be paid. The ladies have had no incitement to noble undertakings&mdash;cu&s;tom has long declared that the cultivation of the mental powers is not their e&s;pecial bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;a liberal education has been uniformly deni|ed them&mdash;and when attempted, has render|ed them the objects of mirth and raillery&mdash; the cold hand of prejudice has clo&s;ely &s;ealed every door of the temple of Fame again&s;t them&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in &s;pite of the&s;e di&s;ad|vantages, many have &s;hone with &s;uperior lu&s;tre&mdash;many have proved them&s;elves ca|pable of &s;waying the &s;ceptre of empires&mdash; many have awoke to extacy the harmoni|ous lyre. America can boa&s;t of three, unrivalled in the annals of hi&s;tory&mdash;Eng|land &s;hines with a Seward, a Chapone, a Moore, and a Rowe&mdash;and France, per|haps never nurtured a more &s;ublime mo|rali&s;t or a keener &s;atire&s;t than her boa&s;ted Montague.</P>
<P>But this is not the ground, declaimers again&s;t &s;emale excellence wi&s;h to tread on&mdash;they know it to be difficultly tenable &mdash;they &s;neak into the corner of error&mdash;ral|ly round the &s;tandard of &s;lander, and level their artillery with more than manly cou|rage at &s;emale weakne&s;s, vices, and vani|ties.
<PB N="8" REF="028664_0007_0FDA3E23931BA9A0">While we touch at &s;ome of their delightful topics, we &s;hall &s;purn every thing really ob&s;cene, and ju&s;t remark, that in this the female character &s;tands infinitely above the long catalogue of often failing yet always per&s;uaded debauchees. We &s;hall con&s;ider two things which are gen|erally the &s;ubjects of &s;atire, and render the fair, in the eyes of our too-refined gentlemen, the objects of contempt, viz. Dre&s;s and Detraction. Our modern de|claimers cry out, Oh dre&s;s, thou fir&s;t, thou vile&s;t fruit of man's apo&s;tacy? Such a declamation really looks well coming from a gentleman who is a beau in its full extent. This is precept and exam|ple going hand in hand.</P>
<P>But even &s;uppo&s;ing it were true that the ladies are more careful to furbi&s;h and dre&s;s their per&s;ons than to improve their minds&mdash;have they not a rea&s;onable, nay, a ju&s;t excu&s;e? Are not beauty and &s;how of wealth what every one of us wor&s;hip: The character of a gentlemen is formed from his conduct and mental abilities&mdash;a lady's mo&s;t frequently from her appear|ance&mdash;a gentleman attracts the attention of the ladi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">s by his character, his station in life, his propo&s;al&mdash;a lady draws the at|tention
<PB N="9" REF="028664_0008_0FDA3E02D1ACBC08">of a gentleman altogether by her beauty, joined with mode&s;t conduct&mdash; mental accompli&s;hments are not looked for in her to a great degree&mdash;a lady can|not live independent, and cu&s;tom &s;ays &s;he mu&s;t not choo&s;e until &s;he be cho&s;en&mdash;it mu&s;t therefore be right for her to u&s;e tho&s;e means by which cu&s;tom &s;ays &s;he will mo&s;t probably be cho&s;en. Suppo&s;e a lady pays little or no attention to dre&s;s, reads all day, talks of Saturn's belt, Her&s;chel's aerology, o&s;teology, dioptics, and politics, who will ever be her &s;uitor? So power|ful are the effects of cu&s;tom in this, that unle&s;s a lady dre&s;&s;es neatly, and in &s;ome degree according to her ability, &s;he would attract but very few or no admirers of our &s;ex, and would &s;igh out an exi&s;tence of comfortle&s;s celibacy.</P>
<P>The next crime, in point of turpidity and frequency, with which the ladies have been charged, is mercile&s;s detraction. In this, as in dre&s;s, precept and example coin|cide. Perhaps in this very act the de|claimer, by &s;tigmatizing the whole &s;ex for the conduct of a very few, exhibits as true a &s;pecimen of detraction as could po&s;&s;ibly be adduced. The cup of life is &s;urely &s;ufficiently bitter without additional
<PB N="10" REF="028664_0009_0FDA3E275737FC28">gall. Who but mu&s;t execrate the wretch who poi&s;ons enjoyment with the bane of &s;candal. The &s;landerer de&s;troys all con|fidence in friend&s;hip, kindles the flame of di&s;cord, and tran&s;mutes our faire&s;t hopes of harmonious &s;ociety into the direful di&s;|cord of infernals. To this dete&s;table vice we are all prone; it is connate with human nature; and who can affirm that the ladies with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure &s;ip this with their tea, and not al&s;o believe that the gentlemen drink it in full draughts with their grog.</P>
<P>Sympathy is an univer&s;al characteri&s;tic of the fair&mdash;their feelings are more ten|der, and their &s;olt affections more ea&s;ily moved; and does not this run directly counter to detraction?&mdash;Why then brand them alone with that propen&s;ity from which their natures appear more aver&s;e than tho&s;e of men: And are the ladies really more prone to this than men? Or is it merely becau&s;e they, for want of oth|er &s;ubjects for conver&s;ation, have more frequently to talk of characters? Gentle|men have a variety of &s;ubjects both public and private, which afford topics for con|ver&s;ation, of which the ladies are altogeth|er deprived&mdash;the topics of their conver&s;a|tion
<PB N="11" REF="028664_0010_0FDA3E2A65191DB8">are little more exten&s;ive than the cir|cle of their acquaitance. Some ladies, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, are &s;hamefully prone to detraction; but mu&s;t the whole &s;ex be &s;tigmatized for the frailties of a few: Where is the &s;ect, even among &s;acred de|nominations, where the whole, according to this te&s;t of merit, might not be &s;tig|matized with the mo&s;t opprobrious epi|thets&mdash;Although my acquaintance with mankind is but &s;mall, yet even in detrac|tion, as many might be cho&s;en among men of its votaries, as among&s;t the fair. Then with the &s;ame propriety may our &s;ex be branded with this, of all crimes the mo&s;t dete&s;table.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely believe the rea&s;on why our &s;ex indulge them&s;elves in &s;uch ba&s;e invec|tive again&s;t the ladies, is becau&s;e we are con&s;cious that our vices in &s;wearing, drink|ing, &amp;c. of which they are clear, and which deba&s;e us below the level with the brute, va&s;tly over-run the catalogne of fe|male frailties, not only in the ba&s;ene&s;s of the act, but al&s;o in the &s;ub&s;equent evilne&s;s of the con&s;equences; and therefore, in order to &s;trike a parallel with the other &s;ex, we mu&s;t invent new vices for them&mdash; make tho&s;e peculiar of which we equally
<PB N="12" REF="028664_0011_0FDA3E2C97ADB8C8">partake&mdash;and paint &s;mall ones with the brighte&s;t dye. Is this generous? Is it not glaring inhumanity? Does it be&s;peak that candour and attachment to truth which &s;hould always characterize the no|ble mind&mdash;the man of &s;en&s;e&mdash;the <HI>truly re|fined gentleman?</HI></P>
