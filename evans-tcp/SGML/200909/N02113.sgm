<HEAD>A Defence, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read the <HI>Sober Remarks</HI> on the <HI>Mode&s;t Proof,</HI> &amp;c. whereon you ask my Opinion: And &s;ince all your De&s;ires have with me the force of Commands, I now tran&s;mit to you my Thoughts and Ob&s;ervations on that Performance.</P>
<P>IF that Author took the Title for his Text, I find him following a Method too common, in leaving it as &s;oon as mentioned, and all along keeping at a Di&s;tance from it far and wide; and that therefore the Adjective is by no means applicable to the Animadver&s;ions.</P>
<P>HE was doubtle&s;s in this mi&s;led by a vulgar Error, which often runs through the Conduct of Humane Life, the not ob&s;erving the Di&s;tin|ction founded in Religion, [2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.1.] be|tween Sins of the Fle&s;h, and Sins of the Spirit; in &s;uch as do not con&s;ider, that Envy and Ma|lice,
<PB N="4" REF="002510_0004_0FDB642050BC6898">
Heretical Opinions and Inclinations, for <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> and <HI>Sedition,</HI> are as heinous Provocations in the &s;ight of Heaven, as the fruition of the forbidden Plea&s;ures of the Animal Life. Hence &s;ome with a &s;eeming Solemnity wor&s;hip God at <HI>Meeting,</HI> but Mammon in the Heart and Clo&s;et; abhor Idols, yet love Sacrilege; forbear Swear|ing, but &s;trongly incline to Lie and Over-reach; and ob&s;erve the <HI>Saturday Evening</HI> with a Jewi&s;h nicety, and on the &s;ucceeding, fall into all the Works of the Gentiles, that can be contained within the Veil of Hypocri&s;y.</P>
<P>THIS Ob&s;ervation might be run through eve|ry Precept of the Second Table, tho' I &s;hall for my Purpo&s;e only in&s;tance in that which relates to Riot and Exce&s;s; where we may take No|tice, that be&s;ides drinking to a Debauch, there is another kind of Intemperance flowing from the bilious Ferment of the Pa&s;&s;ions, and the Fumes of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> and a heared Fancy.</P>
<P>HAD the Author of the <HI>Remarks</HI> duly ob|&s;erved this, he could never have prefixed &s;o im|proper an Epithet as that of <HI>Sober</HI> unto them. I don't indeed know that he is a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in the gro&s;&s;er Meaning of the Word, yet I think there is no Propo&s;ition in <HI>Euclid</HI> more demon&s;trable, than that the Guilt of Intemperance taken in the la&s;t Sen&s;e is chargeable upon him. And to &s;how you that all the Symptoms and Di&s;orders of that Vice are applicable to him, and that by Con&s;equence his <HI>Remarks</HI> could not be <HI>Sober</HI> ones, I &s;hall repre&s;ent him unto you, as appear|ing really to be under all the Signatures of the Crime of Intemperance.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002510_0005_0FDB6422D042DB68">WE may di&s;cern a Per&s;on to be under this Di&s;order by the&s;e Marks and Signs.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THAT his Head is full of delirious <HI>Vi|&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Delu&s;ions</HI> imagining <HI>chimerical Exi&s;tences.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THAT he is &s;o tenacious of his Opi|nions, that he is full Proof again&s;t Conviction by the cleare&s;t Evidence, but thinks him&s;elf privi|ledged to affirm or deny at his plea&s;ure, without any other Satisfaction than his Word.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THAT he is very incon&s;i&s;tent in his Talk, and apt to contradict him&s;elf, as well as others.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THAT he is &s;oon angry, and often very quarrel&s;ome, even without Provocation.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>NOW it the&s;e Spots are remarkably di&s;cern|able, in the <HI>Remarker</HI>'s Countenance, I hope is will be granted, that the&s;e <HI>Remarks</HI> will not be allowed the Performance of a Per&s;on under a <HI>&s;ober</HI> Character: And that they evidently appear in him, will be clear and manife&s;t by ob&s;erving.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, THAT his Head &s;eems giddilly to &s;wim (as if there was a Vortex in his Brain) with deli|rious Vi&s;ions and delu&s;ive Phantoms, his Fancy repre&s;enting to him Images that are meer Chi|meras, which never had nor ever could have any real Exi&s;tence; thus by a &s;udden Whirl, Saints and Sinners in&s;tantly change Places in his vertiginous Imagination, and by the nimble Powers of Transformation, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, by his own Confe&s;&s;ion a worthy good <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, is changed into an Heretick, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> the Heretick in the Opinion of the Ancients, becomes an Orthodox Divine.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002510_0006_0FDB6426E82DF708">THUS the Vi&s;ionary paints on his Fancy, Cardinal <HI>Wol&s;ey,</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Cranmer,</HI> and Su|perintendant <HI>Spot&s;wood,</HI> in a <HI>Geneva</HI> Dre&s;s, hold|ing forth to Independant Congregations: For this is the certain Con&s;equence of his affirming, that both <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> were again&s;t <HI>E|pi&s;copacy</HI> at the Reformation; whereas it is un|di&s;putable Fact, that this was the Government of the <HI>Church</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince the planting of Chri|&s;tianity in it to this very Day, excepting the Anarchy from 1641, to 1660. and that the <HI>Church</HI> was reformed by <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> who afterwards became <HI>Martyrs</HI> under their <HI>Epi&s;copal Characters;</HI> who mu&s;t in the <HI>Remarker</HI>'s Judgment been Fools, or Knaves, or both, to have practi&s;ed even un|to Death, &s;o contrary to the Principles he dreams they had.</P>
<P>AND as for <HI>Scotland,</HI> there is nothing clearer in Hi&s;tory, than that the <HI>Church</HI> at and after the Reformation there, was governed by <HI>Superintend|ants,</HI> who&s;e Office was &s;o far from being an Anti-prelatical Creation, as the <HI>Remarker</HI> fondly ima|gines, that it differed in nothing from <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> but the Name; and it is not to be di&s;puted, but that the Reformation not only in <HI>Britain,</HI> but in all Monarchical Governments, was carried on by <HI>Praelates;</HI> as in <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and in|deed every where, &s;ave in a few <HI>Republican</HI> States, &s;uch as <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Geneva,</HI> where their Church-Government was framed to their Ple|bean Schemes. No Man who&s;e Head was not &s;trangely turned, would imagine the <HI>Fathers</HI> on the <HI>Remarker</HI>'s Side, who all with one Breath
<PB N="7" REF="002510_0007_0FDB6428D5F66020">
condemn his Opinions. Tho' with equal Man|ners and A&s;&s;urance that he provokes unto their Judgment, he di&s;pi&s;es it, and contemns the Au|thority of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> for this very good Rea&s;on, becau&s;e it te&s;tifies again&s;t him. In fine, who but a &s;illy Dreamer could have feigned him&s;elf an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> or rather &s;ome body of a &s;uperiour Character, in giving and taking away Com|mi&s;&s;ions at his plea&s;ure, and which have no Foundation but in Fancy, to be &s;ure not in the <HI>&s;acred Pages.</HI> It is with difficulty that he will allow <HI>Stephen</HI> to be a Preacher, tho' I think we have a good long Sermon of his <HI>Acts</HI> 7. But as to <HI>Philip,</HI> the In&s;tance is &s;o flagrant of his preach|ing and baptizing, that there was no other way to condemn the <HI>Epi&s;copal Deacon</HI> following that Practice, than by framing a new Commi&s;&s;ion for <HI>Philip:</HI> For he would not allow the Powers for his Practice were contained in his <HI>Diaconate;</HI> however we call upon him and his Brethren for a &s;ight of an authentick Copy of that Commi&s;&s;i|on upon Divine Record, which becau&s;e we are &s;ure they can't produce, we can't but firmly adhere to our Opinion, that the &s;econd Com|mi&s;&s;ion is an imaginary Fiction. And &s;ince &s;o good Men would not be found in the&s;e Mini&s;te|rial Functions without a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion,</HI> we mu&s;t con|clude that they di&s;charged them in the virtue of that which they received, at the impo&s;ition of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> Hands, <HI>Acts</HI> 6.6. But this will be anon more fully con&s;idered; this In&s;tance with the foregoing being only here adduced, to di&s;|cover the Di&s;orders the <HI>Remarker</HI> was under,
<PB N="8" REF="002510_0008_0FDB642A5822FC50">
having his Head full of delireous <HI>Vi&s;ions</HI> and <HI>De|lu&s;ions,</HI> imagining <HI>chimerical Exi&s;tences,</HI> and there|fore could not with any Truth or Hone&s;ty prefix the Epithet of <HI>Sober</HI> to his <HI>Remarks.</HI> Nor could he, if we con&s;ider</P>
<P>Secondly, THAT he is &s;o tenacious of his Opinions, that he is full Proof again&s;t Convicti|on by the cleare&s;t Evidence, but thinks him&s;elf privileged to affirm or deny at his plea&s;ure, without any other Satisfaction than his Word.</P>
<P>TO prove this Charge upon him, I &s;hall make it appear, that he has without any Ground de|nied the Di&s;tinction of the three Orders of <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> Mini&s;ters, with their proper Functions and Admini&s;trations, as retained in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> and without any Proof introduced Officers and Offices into the <HI>Go&s;pel Mini&s;try,</HI> not founded in Scripture, and Strangers to the <HI>Church of Chri&s;t,</HI> in its be&s;t and pure&s;t Times. Now for the evincing of this Charge, wherein lies the Merits of the Cau&s;e, and whereon the Hinge of the whole Controver&s;y turns, I &s;hall proceed gradually, and make it good in every one of tho&s;e Orders.</P>
<P>FIRST then, to begin with the lowe&s;t, that of <HI>Deacons,</HI> we mu&s;t con&s;ider that Office in the Rea&s;on of its In&s;titution, and the Exerci&s;e of it; it's plain they were appointed to take &s;ome Charge and Care from off the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Offices of the Mini&s;try, as their Name im|ports, part whereof was to di&s;tribute the Ele|ments at the Celebration of the Lord's Supper, as well as to &s;upervi&s;e the <HI>Churches Trea&s;ury,</HI> and
<PB N="9" REF="002510_0009_0FDB642E9AD5C428">
&s;upply the Poor; but the&s;e Services do not &s;eem to include all that was implied in their de&s;ignation to this Office, and that for the&s;e two Rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t. For the&s;e only there &s;eems no nece&s;&s;ity for &s;o great a Solemnity as an <HI>Or|dination</HI> by the <HI>Apo&s;tolick Hands.</HI> And &s;econdly, Becau&s;e we find &s;ome of them actually employ|ed in more &s;acred Functions, for which they doubtle&s;s then received their Power and Orders. For we don't find they received any for tho&s;e &s;acred Mini&s;trations at any other Time: Now &s;ince they could not preach without being &s;ent, and that it don't appear they were &s;ent at any Time but this we are upon, it mu&s;t be granted, that either they now received their Powers for the mini&s;terial Functions of Preaching and Bap|tizing, or that they acted without any, and were intruders on the &s;acred Function. But this is impious and ab&s;urd, therefore they were now ordained to tho&s;e Parts of the Mini&s;try, they afterwards di&s;charged with &s;o much Diligence and Succe&s;s. And now let us view what tho&s;e Parts were, in the exerci&s;e whereof we find any of them; for from their Practice, we may well conclude that of all the re&s;t. There are but two of tho&s;e <HI>Deacons,</HI> who&s;e Acts are more par|ticularly taken notice of by the <HI>&s;acred Hi&s;torian,</HI> One of then, as has been already hinted, we find has left us an excellent Sermon <HI>Acts</HI> 7. and the other we know preached &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, as to gain many Converts, whom he al&s;o baptized, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. And be&s;ides the&s;e, we don't find any o|ther Act. of their Mini&s;tration in holy Things:
<PB N="10" REF="002510_0010_0FDB642F8FB8DF30">
For tho' they a&s;&s;i&s;ted indeed at the Lord's Ta|ble, yet we don't find that ever they con&s;ecrated the Elements, or ever were ve&s;ted with the Powers of <HI>Ab&s;olution</HI> or <HI>Cen&s;ures,</HI> but rather the contrary is implied <HI>Acts</HI> 8.14, 18. For that af|ter the <HI>Samaritans</HI> were baptized by <HI>Philip the Deacon,</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tles Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> went from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Samaria</HI> to confirm the new Con|verts.</P>
<P>NOW let us &s;ee how the <HI>Church of England Deacon</HI> comes up to the In&s;titution and the Ex|erci&s;e of the Office; after he is recommended, tried, approved and found meet for it, he is &s;o|lemnly ordained by laying on of Hands, inve&s;ted with Power to &s;erve Tables, provide for the Poor, to preach and to baptize, but not to ad|mini&s;ter the Lord's Supper; as that implies the Act of Con&s;ecration, nor remit or retain Sins, in our Saviour's Sence of tho&s;e Words, but as for the <HI>di&s;&s;inting Deacon,</HI> if ever, he is very rarely ordained, and to be &s;ure never to the Offices of preaching and baptizing; and pray now who comes neare&s;t to the primitive In&s;titution, and the manife&s;t Acts of that Office? the <HI>Church of England,</HI> which de&s;ires to obey Divine Com|mands, and be guided in her Conduct by Divine Examples, and in this In&s;tance comes as near the Pattern as is po&s;&s;ible for Imitation, or tho&s;e who &s;acrilegiou&s;ly mutilate this Office, and de|prive it of the be&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful Parts there|of: And therefore who that was <HI>&s;ober</HI> and in his Sen&s;es, could have expre&s;&s;ed his Virulence a|gain&s;t the preaching <HI>Deacon,</HI> as the <HI>Remarker</HI> has
<PB N="11" REF="002510_0011_0FDB64312A483BE8">
done, to &s;ay no wor&s;e in Language like his Cau&s;e, and therefore evident it is upon the whole and mu&s;t be owned, that tho&s;e <HI>Remarks</HI> on this the lowe&s;t Office in the <HI>Evangelical Mini&s;try,</HI> betray a Mind full of Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order, and therefore that they could never be the neat Produce of a <HI>&s;ober</HI> Man, nor they ever ju&s;tly claim an Epithet they have no Title to. From hence let us proceed,</P>
<P>Secondly, TO the next Order, that of <HI>Pre&s;|byters,</HI> and &s;ee if there be any more Marks of Sobriety on the <HI>Remarks</HI> on their Order than on the former; and here I think it will be obvious to every Eye, that the further he goes, the fur|ther he &s;taggers from the Truth, until he falls into gro&s;s Ab&s;urdities, from whence he cannot recover him&s;elf, from the&s;e Reflections.</P>
<P>THE Author of the <HI>Mode&s;t Proof</HI> had alledged with a great deal of Rea&s;on, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> were Succe&s;&s;ors to the <HI>Seventy Di&s;ciples,</HI> who by many Marks of Imparity by him there adduced, and not yet di&s;proved, were in an Office inferiour in Dignity and Power unto the <HI>Apo&s;tolate.</HI> Now he &s;eems extreamly concerned to expunge this Notion, and blots &s;everal Pages, to blot <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion; and &s;o fiercely contends again&s;t the Perpetuity of it, that upon the Sup|po&s;ition of its continuing, he would grant <HI>Pre&s;|byters</HI> to be their proper Succe&s;&s;ors. Now upon this Conce&s;&s;ion we will join I&s;&s;ue with him and give up the Cau&s;e, if we don't make appear, that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion continued after the Time he affirms it determined; and that the
<PB N="12" REF="002510_0012_0FDB6432A5CFB000">
Grounds he goes upon are ab&s;urd, &s;uppo&s;itious and contrary to Fact and the Rea&s;on of Things, he affirms but without Proof, that their Com|mi&s;&s;ion is not now in being, ina&s;much as it ex|pired with them&s;elves, or rather at their Return unto our Lord, and that it was limited only to <HI>Judea.</HI> Now if the&s;e Premi&s;&s;es be not true, the Conclu&s;ion that he would draw from them mu&s;t needs be fal&s;e; and that there is no Truth in either of tho&s;e Pretences, will be clear as Light, from the following Con&s;iderations on each of them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, THAT that Commi&s;&s;ion having never been formally revoked, and the Rea&s;ons where|on it was granted continuing, it mu&s;t al&s;o con|tinue as long as they do.</P>
<P>Secondly, SO far it is from being true, that it was revoked at their Return, that they were then furni&s;hed with new Powers for the Exer|ci&s;e of tho&s;e Functions it authori&s;ed them unto.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I &s;ay the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion having never been formally revoked, and the Rea&s;ons whereon it was granted continuing, it mu&s;t al&s;o continue as long as they do. There is a pro|found Silence in the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> about the Revoca|tion of that Commi&s;&s;ion, not the lea&s;t Inuendo that glances that way, no Account of the Time, Place, and Per&s;on, when, where, or by whom it was taken from them, and they di&s;charged from that Service; and therefore he mu&s;t have a hardy Front, that would affirm this Commi&s;&s;i|on to have been formally revoked. And that it was not virtually &s;o, is &s;till, if po&s;&s;ible, more
<PB N="13" REF="002510_0013_0FDB64370FDCE9C0">
evident, for the Rea&s;ons of its fir&s;t In&s;titution continuing, it mu&s;t be of the &s;ame Duration with them; Now the&s;e Rea&s;ons we have <HI>Luke</HI> 10.2. The greatne&s;s of the Harve&s;t, and the fewne&s;s of the Labourers, and &s;ince the Harve&s;t will continue until the la&s;t Conflagration, &s;o mu&s;t the Labourers, and by Con&s;equence their Commi&s;&s;ion for it. The <HI>Remarker</HI> therefore mu&s;t be guilty of this ab&s;urd Suppo&s;ition, That the Harve&s;t is over, &s;ince the Labourers Commi&s;&s;ion to work therein, is according to him, annulled; unle&s;s he will &s;till more ab&s;urdly &s;uppo&s;e, that there is a Harve&s;t and no Labourers in it. But &s;ince both the&s;e Suppo&s;itions are fal&s;e in Fact, and bla&s;phemous Imputations on the Wi&s;dom of its Ma&s;ter; and that therefore the Harve&s;t will continue to the la&s;t period of Time, &s;o mu&s;t the Labourers Work, and their Commi&s;&s;ion for it, run in a Line parallel to that Duration. Add to this,</P>
<P>Secondly, THAT it is &s;o far from being true that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion was revoked at their return to our <HI>Lord;</HI> that they were then by him furni&s;hed with new Powers for the ex|erci&s;e of tho' Functions it authori&s;ed them un|to. Of this we have an inconte&s;tible Proof <HI>Luke</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.18, 19. where we are told, that even after their return from their fir&s;t Progre&s;s, that our <HI>Lord</HI> &s;aid unto them, <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Satan as Lightning fall from Heaven, behold I give unto you Power to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> on Serpents and Scorpions, and over all the power of the Enemy, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall by any means hurt you.</HI> I demand therefore to what purpo&s;e were
<PB N="14" REF="002510_0014_0FDB64395B29CFC8">
the&s;e extraordinary Powers conferred, if not to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the Work of their Mini&s;try? for as private Chri&s;tians they were u&s;ele&s;s to them, having no direct tendency to promote Faith and Repentance in them&s;elves: The <HI>Remarker</HI> mu&s;t therefore either go upon this bla&s;phemous Sup|po&s;ition, that our <HI>Lord</HI> did in vain be&s;tow upon them the&s;e Powers, and for no wi&s;e End or U&s;e, or confe&s;s to the Truth that they were endowed with them, for the better enabling of them, &s;ucce&s;sfully to di&s;charge the Functions contained in the Commi&s;&s;ion they had received from him; the Conver&s;ion of the World to the Faith and Acknowledgements of their Ma&s;ter, by their Doctrines, atte&s;ted with Miracles. Nor will it follow here, that becau&s;e Miracles are cea&s;ed, therefore their Commi&s;&s;ion has likewi&s;e: For they are two different Things, Commi&s;&s;ion or Authority whereby to act, and Extraordina|ry Gifts whereby to make their acts Succe&s;sful, and per&s;wade the World that their Commi&s;&s;ion was Divine; and therefore it mu&s;t be granted, that the Rea&s;on of the one cea&s;ing, and the o|ther continuing, tho' the one has cea&s;ed, the other mu&s;t continue.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, now I appeal to the com|mon Sen&s;e of Mankind, if the <HI>Remarker</HI> can be &s;aid to be in his Sen&s;es, when he affirms, that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion is expired, or that &s;uch a <HI>Remark</HI> can be called <HI>Sober,</HI> any more than the Second, That their Commi&s;&s;ion was limited to <HI>Judeae.</HI> It is owned, that in their fir&s;t Mi&s;&s;i|on, they were to go unto Places whither our
<PB N="15" REF="002510_0015_0FDB643ADB5880E8">
<HI>Lord</HI> him&s;elf would come, <HI>Luke</HI> 10.1. But even then not exclu&s;ively of others; it is no where &s;aid to the&s;e Places only, or as it was once to the <HI>Apo&s;tles, That they &s;hould not turn into the way of the Gentiles,</HI> Matth. 10.5. Nothing of all this, much le&s;s is there any re&s;traint laid on them after their return: For as their Work concern|ed Mankind in general, &s;o mu&s;t needs their Commi&s;&s;ion be of univer&s;al Extent; and not a Word to be found that confines them to any Place or Nation. But becau&s;e the <HI>Remarker</HI> can find no &s;uch Limitation to the Circumci&s;ion in the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion, his Eyes reel back to the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.5. and would argue it from thence, but how unfairly. They were two di&s;tinct Commi&s;&s;ions, and there|fore it is all precarious Rea&s;oning from one to the other. Nor will it follow upon the Suppo&s;i|tion, that the <HI>Seventy</HI> were to go out unto the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> before they went to them, were to make the fir&s;t Offers of Sal|vation unto the <HI>Jews,</HI> that therefore the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion was more honourable than the <HI>A|po&s;tles,</HI> any more than that the <HI>Remarker,</HI> who, for ought I know, may be a Native of <HI>Britain,</HI> and now upon his pretended <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> in a far di&s;tant Country, is more honourable, than that publick Scandal and avowed Enemy to Chri&s;ti|anity, that denier and derider of the Divinity of the <HI>Son of God,</HI> his Brother <HI>Pierce,</HI> who&s;e Books and Quotations he is &s;o fond of. No, the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> had the greate&s;t Honour in beginning their <HI>Mi|ni&s;try</HI> among&s;t the once peculiar People of God,
<PB N="16" REF="002510_0016_0FDB643FD16D6918">
before they made any tender thereof to tho&s;e who were Aliens from that Common-Wealth. But &s;ince he knows it is denied him, that the <HI>Seventy</HI> were &s;uperiour to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> either in Power or Character, he is re&s;olved to bring them upon a level; and &s;ince he cannot find, he will make, 82 <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> by a new Creation of Seventy at a Time; and rather than fail in this attempt, impiou&s;ly charge the In&s;piration <HI>Luke</HI> 10.1. with an Omi&s;&s;ion, and the Tran&s;|lators, for not enli&s;ting a Word that was not in the Original, and in &s;pite of both, add the Word <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> that it may run, as it does in his Head, and be read <HI>Seventy Apo&s;tles.</HI> But what would the <HI>Remarker</HI> get by it, if we &s;hould allow his fictitious Reading, and fal&s;e Suppo&s;ition to be a true one? nothing &s;urely but the ruine of his Cau&s;e, by &s;ubverting that Foundation where|upon he de&s;igned to erect it, the expiration, of the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion. For now by his own Confe&s;&s;ion, and Pleading too, it mu&s;t be perpe|tual: For he has freely and frequently allowed, that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion, with regard to their ordinary Mini&s;trations in the Word and Sacraments, is perpetual, and to continue to the end of the World: Now if the&s;e <HI>Seventy</HI> be <HI>A|po&s;tles,</HI> as he would have us believe, their Com|mi&s;&s;ion according to him mu&s;t continue to the end of the World, and then what has he been di&s;puting about all this while, and contending that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion is expired; and yet very con&s;i&s;tently with him&s;elf, that it is not expired, but is to continue to the end of Time,
<PB N="17" REF="002510_0017_0FDB64418D538790">
becau&s;e they were <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> Or we may ob&s;erve him Rea&s;oning after this ridiculous manner, as they were <HI>Seventy Di&s;ciples,</HI> their Commi&s;&s;ion is &s;pent and cea&s;ed, but as they were <HI>Seventy Apo|&s;tles,</HI> it will la&s;t as long as the World. There is no eviting &s;uch Con&s;equences as there will na|turally flow from this new Hypothe&s;is, which I will allow him the Honour to be the Author and Inventor of, and all his own; and as &s;uch I have only argued upon it, for I don't believe the <HI>Seventy</HI> to be a whit the more <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> for his dubbing them, nor that any of them a&s;cend|ed to that &s;uperiour Order, but as they were ad|vanced by the immediate call of Heaven, or mediately by a Con&s;ecration to the <HI>Apo&s;tolate.</HI> Add, that it was the Opinion of the primitive Church, as it is of the be&s;t part of the pre&s;ent, that the Helpers and Fellow-Labourers of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> of whom we have frequent Mention in the <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Epi&s;tles,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> called <HI>Bar&s;abas, Mark, Luke, Apollos, Rufus, Niger,</HI> and <HI>Matthias</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> before they were made <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> were of the Number of the <HI>Seventy.</HI> Who would know the Truth of this, may con|&s;ult <HI>Eu&s;eb.</HI> Lib. 1.

<P>IT has, been made appear, that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion never was formally revoked; and
<PB N="18" REF="002510_0018_0FDB6443487F1450">
that the Rea&s;ons whereon it was granted conti|nuing, it mu&s;t al&s;o continue as long as they do, and that again it was &s;o far from being true that it was revoked at their return, that they were furni&s;hed with new Powers for the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e Functions it authori&s;ed them to; and that moreover it does not appear that their Com|mi&s;&s;ion was confined to <HI>Judea,</HI> e&s;pecially after their fir&s;t return, and their new Endowments, and that he is guilty of the greate&s;t Profanity in his impious Attempts to add unto the Scripture, and create <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> at his plea&s;ure. It mu&s;t be granted, that the <HI>Remarks</HI> are &s;o far from being a <HI>&s;ober</HI> Performance, that they are an undeniable Evidence of an intractable Per&s;on, incapable of Conviction, and re&s;olved to maintain Paradoxes, I therefore appeal to the World that this is his Ca&s;e, and in con&s;equence thereof, that he ought to allow <HI>Presbyters</HI> to be Succe&s;&s;ors to the <HI>Seven|ty.</HI> &s;ince he &s;eem'd to lay the Stre&s;s of the Di&s;|pute, upon the Point of their Commi&s;&s;ion being perpetual, and not limitted to the Circumci&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT if he will further wrangle and &s;ay, that if we will not grant him that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Com|mi&s;&s;ion did determine at their return to our Lord; yet we can't deny but that it expired with them&s;elves, for &s;ince according to us, they were meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> they could not ordain o|thers, and tran&s;mit their Succe&s;&s;ion; and their Ma&s;ter had left the World but no Power to per|petuate that Order. Yet however he may like it, we will deny him the Favour even of that Suppo&s;ition, and affirm and prove it too, that the

Succe&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Seventy</HI> was continued in the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> who were ordained to that Office by the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> their Succe&s;&s;ors, and will be to the end of the World. For the Rea|&s;on of their Commi&s;&s;ion continuing beyond their Lives, even to the end of the Harve&s;t, their Commi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed to do the &s;ame, and mu&s;t actually therefore have been continued, and contained, and confirmed, in the la&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion given to the <HI>Apo&s;tles, Matth.</HI> 28.19, 20. <HI>John</HI> 20.21, 22, 23. the higher Or|der and Power including the two lower Orders and their Powers.

And by this al&s;o the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion was not only confirmed and conti|nued, but enlarged with regard to Place, and powers of Government and Ordination. For Mr. <HI>Remarker</HI> acknowledges that this la&s;t Com|mi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be thus interpreted, to include Go|vernment and Ordination, as well as the Mini|&s;try in the Word and Sacraments, Pages 19 and 25.</P>
<P>IF it be asked, What are the Offices of tho&s;e <HI>Presbyters</HI> we here contend for? I an&s;wer, be|&s;ides preaching and baptizing, the admini&s;tring the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and ab&s;olv|ing Penitents.</P>
<P>IF it be further demanded, By what Divine Warrant they are ve&s;ted with &s;uch Offices? I an&s;wer, That we are willing to have our Prac|tice regulated by the primitive Pattern, as we find it in the Scriptures. And</P>

&s;how wherein he yields, and my &s;elf, wherein again&s;t all Rea&s;on, he does not.</P>
<P>BE it known then that, by this own Conce&s;&s;i|ons, we are upon this Head agreed in the&s;e Ar|ticles.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, WE agree, that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were ho|noured with extraordinary Powers and Privi|ledges, and among&s;t them, with an unlimitted Juri&s;diction over all the Churches, which was to expire with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Secondly, WE are agreed, that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> la&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19 and 20. empow|ered them and their Succe&s;&s;ors, not only to the Mini&s;trations of the Word and Sacraments, but to the Government of the Church, and to the Ordination of Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Thirdly, WE are further agreed, that the Powers of Government and Ordination are an|nexed.</P>
<P>Fourthly, HE will doubtle&s;s grant with me, That in Fact, whatever it may be as to Rea&s;on, the Government of <HI>Praelates</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> are two different &s;orts of Government; that is, the Government of a <HI>Praelate</HI> over a <HI>Dioce&s;s,</HI> wherein are many <HI>Presbyters</HI> and Congregations, is not the &s;ame with that of a <HI>Presbyter</HI> over a &s;ingle <HI>Flock.</HI> And I wi&s;h we were agreed as well about the</P>
<P>Fifth Point. THE Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion whereof deter|mines the Controver&s;y, whereby I affirm, what he denies, That the Power of Ordination was annexed to the Government of <HI>Praelates,</HI> taken in its proper pre&s;ent Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Sen&s;e, and not to that Government that meer <HI>Presbyters</HI>

<P>Now there is no other way to be determined in this Point, but by Facts and Precedents upon &s;acred Record, and the Rea&s;on of Things For to run out into wild Excur&s;ions, and imperti|nent: Quotations, (which make up the bulk of the <HI>Remarks,</HI> and whereof if &s;trip'd, there would remain nothing of a real Argument,) is to fall from &s;olid Rea&s;oning, and run wide of the Que|&s;tion.

The cleare&s;t and mo&s;t unexceptionable Facts and Precedents of what kind of Government was annexed to the Power of Ordination, by and after the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> upon the &s;acred Records, are contained in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epi&s;tles to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and Chri&s;ts unto the <HI>A&s;ian Angels, Rev.</HI> 1.20. and Chap 2.1. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I mention St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epi&s;tles fir&s;t, becau&s;e fir&s;t wrote.

<P>Fir&s;t, LET us con&s;ider the Nature of a <HI>Prae|lates</HI> Government, as he is a <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hop;</HI> and upon enquiry we &s;hall find, that it implied at its fir&s;t In&s;titution, as it does now, the giving In&s;tructions to tho&s;e <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> that are within the Verge of his In&s;pection, con|cerning their Behaviour, and the exerci&s;e of their Offices, the pre&s;cribing Rules for a decent and regular Performance of publick Wor&s;hip, taking care that their Doctrines be Sound and Orthodox, encouraging and promoting tho&s;e that are faithful and diligent, as on the contra|ry puni&s;hing with Cen&s;ures or Su&s;pen&s;ion, the contumacious and di&s;obedient; in&s;pecting al&s;o into the Conver&s;ations of the People within their Juri&s;diction, that they be as becometh their Profe&s;&s;ion, and if not, being liable to his Judg|ment and Correction.

<P>Secondly, Whether <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were intru&s;ted with &s;uch Powers and Authority, and if their Government be found <HI>Praelatical</HI> in the&s;e In&s;tances, I hope it will not be denied, that they were in the pre&s;ent proper Sen&s;e of the Words, <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops.</HI> Now that in Fact they were ve&s;ted with &s;uch a Government, will be clear by

having recour&s;e to the Epi&s;tles to them, where Records thereof are pre&s;erved.

Now the&s;e were all proper Acts of a <HI>Praelatical Government,</HI> over &s;everal <HI>Pre&s;|byters</HI> and Congregations, and not over a &s;ingle <HI>Fleck,</HI> as is here evident from the &s;everal In&s;tan|ces of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Rule over <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and is un|deniable from <HI>Crete</HI>'s being a place where were many Cities, in every one of which <HI>Presbyters</HI> were to be &s;ettled; it will therefore follow, they were <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops,</HI> in the &s;trict proper pre&s;ent Sen&s;e of the Words.</P>
<P>Thirdly, WE are to ob&s;erve, that to tho&s;e very Per&s;ons thus ve&s;ted and intru&s;ted with the <HI>praelatical Powers</HI> and Government of <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops,</HI> was committed the Power of Ordination. It was no other than <HI>Timothy</HI> adorned with all tho&s;e Signatures of Rule over the <HI>Presbyters</HI> of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> that was to lay on Hands with Caution,

and as he found the Candidates qualified for &s;a|cred Services, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.21, 22. It was no other, than this very <HI>Titus,</HI> in whom we have found &s;uch legible Characters of a <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hop,</HI> that for this very end was left in <HI>Crete,</HI> to ordain El|ders in every City, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.5. And it is to no purpo&s;e for the <HI>Remarker</HI> to alledge, that they had tho&s;e Powers of Government and Ordina|tion as endowed with extraordinary Powers or Gifts. This is <HI>petitio Principii,</HI> or in his own de|cent Expre&s;&s;ion, a mean begging of the Que&s;|tion; for as we know, he will hardly believe us, even although we prove, &s;o he may be a&s;&s;ured that his <HI>perhaps</HI> and <HI>may be</HI>'s are of no weight with us; for we will never take his Word for any thing he don't make appear. And it is ri|diculous for him and his Party, who are &s;o Cla|morous for Scripture Proofs and Examples, for every thing that is to be done about &s;acred Things or Per&s;ons, to go upon bare Suppo&s;iti|ons in Things of the highe&s;t Moment. For no|thing extraordinary either of Powers or Gifts, appears in the whole Ca&s;e; nothing but what <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops</HI> with their ordinary Powers may and do ordinarily perform. And it is mo&s;t un|ju&s;t, and again&s;t all the Laws of Rea&s;oning, to put us upon the proof of the&s;e Negatives, That they had no A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that they did not all this as <HI>Presbyters,</HI> &amp;c. We deny all the&s;e groundle&s;s Surmi&s;es, and therefore the Proof belongs to him the po&s;itive Affirmer, which becau&s;e there is no Ground to go upon, we are a&s;&s;ured it can never be done. We are now further for the Confimation of our Point,</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002510_0026_0FDB6456903D8C08">Fourthly, TO evince, that the <HI>A&s;ian Angels</HI> were ve&s;ted with a like Government, and in ju&s;t Con&s;equence had the Power of Ordination. That they were ve&s;ted with a <HI>praelatical Govern|ment</HI> appears from hence, that &s;everal of them were threatned and condemned by our Lord, for &s;uffering or not re&s;training the Doctrines of <HI>Balaam,</HI> the <HI>Nicolaitans</HI> and <HI>Jezebel,</HI> Rev. 2.14, 15. and 20. which plainly implied, that they were ve&s;ted with a coercive ruling Power over the&s;e Churches: For if they were only <HI>&s;enior Pa&s;tors</HI> or <HI>Moderators,</HI> as the <HI>Remarker</HI> dotes, how could they be culpable and made criminal for not doing, what was not in their Power to do?

So that the <HI>Remarker</HI> mu&s;t either bla&s;|phemou&s;ly feign our Lord to bring an unju&s;t Charge again&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Angels,</HI> accu&s;ing them of what they were not guilty, and puni&s;hing them for what they could not help, or confe&s;s the Truth, that their Accu&s;ation and threatned Pu|ni&s;hment was ju&s;t, becau&s;e they had not exerted their <HI>praelatical Powers</HI> in cen&s;uring and re&s;train|ing licentious Doctrines of &s;educing Teachers, within their &s;everal Juri&s;dictions; and that tho' they were con&s;tituted Guardians of the Purity of the Chri&s;tian Faith, they had been remi&s;s in their Charge, and permitted the Corruption of it, to the Di&s;honour of its Author, and the Scan|dal of their own Characters. This is the only good and true Account that can be given of
<PB N="27" REF="002510_0027_0FDB645A404A6AC8">
that Matter; as for the <HI>Remarker</HI>'s Dream, that every <HI>Angel</HI> was a Company of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> it is hardly worth while to awake him out of it, by any &s;erious Ob&s;ervation on &s;o remarkable a Fa|ble. He may with much more Rea&s;on allow all the <HI>Presbytery</HI> that ordained <HI>Timothy</HI> to be in St. <HI>Paul,</HI> than all the <HI>Presbyters</HI> that were in the <HI>le&s;&s;er A&s;ia</HI> to be in &s;even <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI> But I &s;hall not follow him in his Wild-Goo&s;e Cha&s;e, but pro|ceed to ob&s;erve, That &s;ince tho&s;e <HI>Angels</HI> had committed to them the <HI>praelatical</HI> Power of Go|vernment, they mu&s;t al&s;o have been ve&s;ted with the Power of Ordination; for we find the&s;e Pow|ers annexed, as in the foregoing In&s;tances of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and &s;ince it plainly appears they were ve&s;ted with the Powers of the one, there is no rea&s;on to deny them the Power of the other. And by ju&s;t Con&s;equence in both they were <HI>Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops.</HI> Having then found &s;o many <HI>Prelates</HI> in their <HI>Dioce&s;&s;es,</HI> let us now &s;ee whether there were any Coadjutors appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their Ordinations, or to the making them the more valid: And upon a due enquiry we &s;hall find,</P>
<P>Fifthly, THAT to them ve&s;ted with &s;uch Powers of Government, was committed the &s;ole power of Ordination, exclu&s;ive of meer <HI>Presby|ters.</HI> For in Points of &s;o great Con&s;equence, we mu&s;t go upon certain Facts and Precedents, and not upon meer Conjecture, &s;upported by no Rea&s;on; and when nothing of this Nature ap|pears or is affirmed, it is intolerable Boldnene&s;s to conclude it confidently. When St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays,
<PB N="28" REF="002510_0028_0FDB645BD7DAEB18">
I charge <HI>Thee</HI> to lay Hands, I left <HI>Thee</HI> to ordain, without the lea&s;t mentioning of <HI>Presbyters</HI> to a&s;|&s;i&s;t, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, that the &s;ole pow|er of Ordination was committed to them only, &s;ince we have no Warrant or Precedent for the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Presbyters</HI> Concurrence, unle&s;s it be in that often mi&s;-interpreted Text, <HI>The laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery,</HI> whereby is meant even in the Judgment of tho&s;e who were not in every thing the greate&s;t Friends to the <HI>Epi&s;copal Order,</HI> the Office which was transferred on <HI>Ti|mothy,</HI> at his Ordination by St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s own Hands. And therefore what A&s;&s;urance mu&s;t it be in meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> to a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the greate&s;t Power in the Church, that of Ordina|tion, and pretending to perform that Action not only without a <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> but in oppo&s;ition to him. For neither of which Practices is there any Foundation in the Word of God, or any Exam|ples of &s;uch a Practice there. And now to &s;um up the Evidence,</P>
<P>IF from Facts and Precedents upon the Di|vine Records, if it appears that a <HI>Praelatical Go|vernment of Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in their Ad|vancement above, and Rule over <HI>Presbyters</HI> and their Churches, that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were ve&s;ted with that Government, that the &s;ole pow|er of Ordination was committed to them ve&s;ted with tho&s;e Powers of Government, that the <HI>A&s;ian Angels</HI> were ve&s;ted with &s;uch a <HI>praelatical Govern|ment;</HI> and that therefore to them al&s;o the &s;ole Power of Ordination was committed exclu&s;ive of others the Propo&s;ition mu&s;t be granted, name|ly,
<PB N="29" REF="002510_0029_0FDB646095CDF478">
That the Powers of Ordination was annexed to the Government of <HI>Praelates,</HI> taken in its pre|&s;ent Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Sen&s;e, exclu&s;ive of meer <HI>Pre&s;|byters.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, I argue the Truth of this Propo&s;i|tion again&s;t the <HI>Remarker</HI> from the Rea&s;on of Things. He allows the Nece&s;&s;ity and Being of <HI>Praelacy</HI> during the Times of In&s;piration, before the Canon of the Scripture was fini&s;hed, and during the Infancy of the Church, and all tho&s;e Rea&s;ons now cea&s;ing, he &s;ays, there is no fur|ther Occa&s;ion for it, and that the Church now wants no &s;uch Governours, ina&s;much as the Af|fairs of Religion will be as well provided for without them; an In&s;tance whereof is the &s;tate of Religion in this Country, as he &s;ays. Now if the rever&s;e of all this be the Truth, as it is demon&s;trable, &s;o then the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Praelacy</HI> &s;till continues. And</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, IF there was a Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Praelacy</HI> in the Times of In&s;piration, it is much more Ne|ce&s;&s;ary it &s;hould continue, that cea&s;ing: For the infallible Conduct, of the Spirit, was &s;ufficient to guide the Church in all its Duties and Or|dinances, whereas now there is a nece&s;&s;ity for a &s;ettled Government and Laws. And it's more than probable, for that very Rea&s;on a <HI>Praelacy</HI> was in&s;tituted, to keep the World within the proper Bounds of their Duty, and direct their Practice, and their Con&s;cience in more doubt|ful Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Secondly, THERE is as much if not more Rea&s;on for <HI>Praelacy;</HI> to be &s;ure, more clear In|&s;tances
<PB N="30" REF="002510_0030_0FDB64635A3AA920">
of it after, than before the fini&s;hing of the Canon of the Scripture. However, the Go&s;|pels were writ before the cleare&s;t Marks we have of the e&s;tabli&s;hing <HI>Praelacy,</HI> and there is nothing in the Epi&s;tles or Revelation that tends to &s;ub|vert it, but much every way to confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h it. And</P>
<P>Thirdly, AS to the Infancy of the Church, if that be a good Rea&s;on for it, it &s;till holds, e&s;|pecially in this Country, where the Church is in its infant State. But why &s;hould it be &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary for Infant, and &s;o needle&s;s for Adult Chri&s;tianity? When Per&s;ons grow up, they of|ten grow unruly, and very much want to be kept under Re&s;traint and Government. And</P>
<P>La&s;tly, AS to Appeals to his own Country, and the &s;tate of Religion in it, what could have been brought as a more fragrant Evidence for the Nece&s;&s;ity of another kind of Government than what is in it, than the Di&s;orders and Di&s;|putes, the Contentions and Confu&s;ions that are among them, for want of one to whom the dor|nier Re&s;ort is to be made, and the Hydra of Here&s;ies which ought to be beat down by the Cro&s;ier.</P>
<P>ADD therefore the Rea&s;on of the Things to the Facts and Precedents we have for <HI>Praelacy,</HI> and upon them both, I think I may venture to appeal to the common Sen&s;e of Mankind, for its agreeing to the Truth of the Propo&s;ition. I can't pa&s;s from this Head, without animadvert|ing on &s;ome Cavils, that the <HI>Remarker</HI> has at two Texts adduced by the <HI>Mode&s;t Proof,</HI> for the
<PB N="31" REF="002510_0031_0FDB13B92B117F58">
perpetuity of the <HI>Apo&s;tolate.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.17. He may &s;et his Teeth and grin at the Word <HI>Set</HI> in one of tho&s;e Texts, yet there is an ob&s;ervable Empha&s;is on it, as if it denoted the Stability of that In&s;titution in the Divine Inten|tion. And as to his imperious Demand, By what Laws of Interpretation we con&s;true what follows the three Words fir&s;t named, (whereby we mean the three Orders we contend for) of Gifts, and the Exerci&s;es of them.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, By the acknowledged Laws of in|terpreting Scripture by Scripture, for as to <HI>Pre&s;|byters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> he him&s;elf acknowledges their Continuance, and that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> &s;hall conti|nue as long as the World. The Texts are ex|pre&s;s and we have no Account of any other Office of a &s;tanding Nature: And therefore all tho&s;e De&s;ignations that are delivered in ab&s;tract Words, mu&s;t be applied to the three Orders which are expre&s;&s;ed in concrete Terms.</P>
<P>LET us here again view his Vanity, and ob|&s;erve him glorying in an imaginary Conque&s;t over tho&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Mode&s;t Proof, That tho' the Apo&s;tles were ve&s;ted with an unlimitted Ju|ri&s;diction, yet thy only tran&s;mitted a limitted one.</HI> But notwith&s;tanding of this, they have true Succe&s;|&s;ors both in Government and Ordination. For the&s;e are Truths, and even reconcileable to our Apprehen&s;ions. Suppo&s;e a great Prince has &s;e|veral Sons, and &s;everal Principalities, and to each Son he gives a Principality, and all the Power whereby he governed it, certainly each Son &s;ucceeds the Father in the whole Power
<PB N="32" REF="002510_0032_0FDB646915CBD198">
over his re&s;pective Principality, tho' not in the whole of the Power the Father had over all the Principalities. This is the very Ca&s;e; St. <HI>Paul,</HI> for In&s;tance, and &s;o by a Parity of Rea&s;on, the &s;ame is to be &s;aid of the re&s;t of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> gave his Son <HI>Timothy,</HI> as he calls him, the Govern|ment of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> as he did <HI>Titus</HI> that of <HI>Crete,</HI> with full Power to govern tho&s;e Places, as he would do was he pre&s;ent. And now who can deny but that <HI>Timothy</HI> &s;ucceeded <HI>Paul</HI> in the whole Power he had over <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> tho' not in the whole of the Power he had over all other Churches; and the like of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and all others whom the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> con&s;tituted <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> in their re&s;pective <HI>Dioce&s;&s;es.</HI> And has not Mr. <HI>Remarker</HI> acknow|ledged all this? Yea verily, all the Difference is, that he contends this limitted Juri&s;diction &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily be contracted to a &s;ingle <HI>Pari&s;h,</HI> whereas we deny that Nece&s;&s;ity, and have prov|ed that it was not thus originally &s;o bounded.</P>
<P>BUT tho' it's thus evident that the Govern|ment &s;ettled by Chri&s;t and his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> in the Church, was founded in an Imparity of Officers, or rather in a proper <HI>Dioce&s;an Epi&s;copacy;</HI> yet &s;ince often the Di&s;tance is wide between Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Right, I don't affirm there is &s;uch an inviolable and e&s;&s;ential Connection be|tween the Powers of Ordination and Juri&s;dicti|on, that they mu&s;t always be found in an actual Conjunction. For the Ordinations of a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> unju&s;tly expelled his See, are good and valid, wherever he is, and to who&s;e Character the Faithful will always every where pay their doe Regards.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="002510_0033_0FDB646A12A164D8">NOR do I mea&s;ure the <HI>Epi&s;copal Power</HI> of Or|dination by the extent of Juri&s;diction, for that Power varies not by Accidents or Circum&s;tan|ces: And therefore let the <HI>Remarker</HI> make as little Logical a Dioce&s;s for a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> as he can, we cannot admit his <HI>independent Pa&s;tor</HI> to u&s;urp it, or &s;u&s;tain &s;o much as the very lowe&s;t Office in the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try; and that for the Rea|&s;on we have been upon, becuu&s;e he has not been ordained by a Succe&s;&s;or to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> in whom always according to the original In&s;titution, the powers of Ordination and Juri&s;diction over a plurality of <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> either in Fact or Right, that is a capacity or plenitude of Pow|er for &s;uch a Government, are connected; the Fact he di&s;owns, and the Right he di&s;claims, and therefore from neither can he make any ju&s;t pretence to a valid Ordination.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now under this &s;econd Head &s;ubjoin &s;ome Defences of the An&s;wers, that were made to the Objections which the <HI>Remarker</HI> and his Party commonly urge again&s;t <HI>Epi&s;copacy.</HI> Fir&s;t, as to that of <HI>Acts</HI> 20&punc;17, and 28. tho&s;e were cer|tainly pre&s;ent at that Meeting at <HI>Miletus</HI> with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> among whom he had gone preaching for three Years in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the&s;e were undoubt|edly <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> about, as well as the Elders of the City of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> unle&s;s we will admit the&s;e three Ab&s;urdities, Fir&s;t, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> travelled three Years preaching only in <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> which who can believe, who con&s;iders not only the Im|propriety of the Expre&s;&s;ion, but the greatne&s;s of his Work, and the extent of his Commi&s;&s;ion?
<PB N="34" REF="002510_0034_0FDB646F0B374AC8">
Secondly, that the Country <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> were &s;o dif|ficult of acce&s;s and &s;tiff, that they could not &s;o ea&s;ily be convened as the <HI>Ephe&s;ian Elders;</HI> for the <HI>Remarker</HI> &s;eems to hint &s;uch a thing, when he &s;ays, The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> was in ha&s;t, and could not wait for them; which who can believe of &s;o good a Man?

<P>Thirdly, All this to be replied and applied unto 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.2&mdash;7. And however &s;trange the <HI>Remarker</HI> may think that St. <HI>Paul</HI> did not expre&s;s him&s;elf in Language &s;ignificant to his Apprehen|&s;ions, it is much more &s;trange that he &s;hould fault the Conduct of an in&s;pired <HI>Apo&s;tle.</HI> How|ever for his Satisfaction in this Point, I remit him to St. <HI>Chry&s;.</HI> whom he will find giving a very good Rea&s;on, why there is little &s;aid to or of

<P>And thus have we the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e Fathers upon the Di&s;pute, whom the <HI>Remarker</HI> has had the mode&s;ty to affirm to be on his &s;ide of it.</P>

<P>But to make a ju&s;t Improvement on the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|marker</HI>'s pretence to this Virtue, I would &s;ub|&s;ume, that it amounts to no le&s;s than a Demon|&s;tration, that <HI>Epi&s;copal Government</HI> is of a Divine Original, and that upon the&s;e Rea&s;ons:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That in Fact it being found in the pri|mitive Church, no Time can be a&s;&s;igned but the <HI>Apo&s;tolical</HI> when it begun.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="002510_0046_0FDB648E2DF32B18">Secondly, That it was &s;o far from being &s;et up by the &s;ecular Power, that it was the Go|vernment of the Church in the heat of the fierce&s;t Per&s;ecutions, wherein the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> e&s;peci|ally, were in a manner &s;ure of a Crown of Mar|tyrdom.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That if <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> was not coeval with Chri&s;tianity, it would be a Miracle that at one and the &s;ame In&s;tant, the Government of the Church &s;hould become univer&s;ally <HI>prelatical,</HI> for &s;o we find it every where e&s;tabli&s;hed where Chri&s;tianity was planted. And</P>
<P>Fourthly, That it would be no le&s;s Wonder|ful, that there &s;hould be no Envy or Ambition among any of the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as not to complain and remon&s;trate again&s;t the <HI>Praelates</HI> Encroach|ments on their Priviledges, before the Heretick <HI>Aerius,</HI> nor any of them have &s;o much Goodne&s;s and Re&s;olution, as not to a&s;&s;ert their own Au|thority again&s;t tho&s;e unrea&s;onable U&s;urpations upon their Powers, had they e&s;teemed them &s;uch.</P>
<P>And therefore upon the whole, it mu&s;t be granted, that whether by Miracles, or (which is mo&s;t evident) by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles Epi&s;copacy</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;hed, it is every way of a Divine Ori|ginal.</P>
<P>But as if it was not criminal enough to break open the Monuments of Antiquity and bring forth tho&s;e Reverend Per&s;ons to di&s;own their avowed Principles, &amp; deny their kown Practice, he has the Sincerity to apply to others of a later Date, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; and even

B. <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from <HI>p.</HI> 153. to <HI>p.</HI> 160. and <HI>Petries</HI> on the &s;ame Subject, from <HI>p.</HI> 232. to <HI>p.</HI> 380. he will find, (contrary to the fal&s;e Po&s;ition he has laid down) that the <HI>Scotch</HI> Superintendants had power of Ordination, which they called Admi&s;&s;ion, of Vi&s;itation, Tran&s;lati|on, Depo&s;ition, holding Dioce&s;an Synods, re|ceiving Appeals, judging Divorces, injoining Pennance, and in a Word, doing every thing that is properly Epi&s;copal.</P>
<P>And if he will read Father <HI>Paul</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> from <HI>p.</HI> 573. to <HI>p.</HI> 687. he'l find, that the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Legates there u&s;ed all their Endeavours to overthrow <HI>Epi&s;copacy;</HI> which wicked De&s;ign however the <HI>Gallican</HI> Bi&s;hops chiefly as &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, and maintained <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> to be <HI>Jure Divino;</HI> &s;o that had the <HI>Pope</HI> then obtained his Ends, <HI>Presbyterian Govern|ment</HI> would have been &s;et up in all the Popi&s;h Countries and the <HI>Pope</HI> been <HI>Moderator,</HI> and would &s;till if he could, &s;o that in him indeed <HI>Presbytery</HI> has a Patron and a Pillar, and the <HI>Re|marker</HI>

a Friend to his Cau&s;e, tho' that is not the only Point wherein they meet.</P>
<P>But finding no Friends a home, the <HI>Remarker</HI> lays a&s;ide all his mode&s;t Pretences to their Suf|frages and with an Air of A&s;&s;urance would look for &s;ome Countenance abroad, but for all his Confidence, he needs not be &s;o &s;anguine to think that he is much in the Favour of any there; for I might produce the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the fo|reign Divines, pronouncing &s;olemn Anathemas upon the rebellious Separati&s;ts from the <HI>Engli&s;h Epi&s;copal</HI> Communion, and make it appear that they &s;tand condemned Schi&s;maticks by the Judg|ment of <HI>Calvin, Bezs, Amyrould&punc; Claud, Le Blanc,</HI> &amp;c. only in hopes of his becoming a Penitent, I would not increa&s;e his Sorrow, by &s;aying now, what they have &s;aid upon this Subject.</P>
<P>But one remarkable Te&s;timony is worth our Ob&s;ervation, and our Pains to bring it out to Light, becau&s;e it has been indu&s;triou&s;ly con|cealed, and now not very commonly known, and that is of Mr. <HI>David Blondel,</HI> the <HI>Coriphaeus</HI> of all the Parity Men, who having been em|ployed by the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;embly</HI> to write his <HI>Apologia pro Hieronymo,</HI> concludes it in Words to this purpo&s;e; <HI>By all that we have &s;aid to a&s;&s;ert the Rights of the</HI> Presbytery, <HI>we do not intend to in|validate the ancient and Apo&s;tolick Con&s;titution of</HI> Epi&s;copal <HI>Preheminence, but we believe that where&s;o|ever it is e&s;tabli&s;hed conformable to the ancient Canons, it mu&s;t be carefully pre&s;erved, and where&s;oever by &s;ome heat of Contention or otherwi&s;e it has been put down or violated, it ought to be reverently re&s;tored.</HI>

Which Pa&s;&s;age being de&s;tructive to his Employ|ers De&s;ign, upon their vehement and re&s;tle&s;s Im|portunity, he was prevailed upon to put it out. So prevailing oftentimes is Party Affection and Intere&s;t over Truth. Now that this is Fact, we have the Te&s;timony of Dr. <HI>Peter Du Moulin</HI> in his Letter to Dr. <HI>Durell,</HI> to be &s;een in the la&s;t Page of the 4th Vol. of the <HI>Memoirs of Literature,</HI> writ|ten by Mon&s;ieur <HI>La Rocque,</HI> wherein <HI>Du Moulin</HI> &s;ays he had the certain Account of this Affair, not only from Primate <HI>U&s;her,</HI> but from Mr. <HI>Da|vid Blondel</HI> him&s;elf, in a Letter to his Brother.</P>
<P>And now upon the whole of the <HI>Remarkers</HI> pretences to tho&s;e Characters of Mode&s;ty and Integrity, however &s;ome may call evil good, yet Vice and Vertue are of unalterable Natures, and it's in vain to vail one with the Appearance of the other; for upon drawing a&s;ide the Curtain, the unmasked Spectacle will be &s;een in its pro|per Habit. And therefore to fini&s;h this Head, it mu&s;t be granted me, that if he is abandoned to &s;uch an in&s;en&s;ible State, that he feels no Horror or Relenting at the Injuries and Indigni|ties he has offered to &s;ome of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of Men, what all the World be&s;ides him&s;elf, and &s;uch whom Demon&s;tration cannot convince, will allow me, that he has a&s;&s;umed Characters he has no Right in, or any ju&s;t Claim unto.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude, by an An&s;wer to all his cornuted Dilemma's, with the Story of the Man who had the unhappy Dilemma put to him, to kill his Father, abu&s;e his Mother, or be Drunk; whereupon he cho&s;e the la&s;t, becau&s;e, as he

If the Story is a Fable, the Moral is plain; that a Per&s;on in the <HI>Remarker's</HI> Frame, would be guilty of the mo&s;t unnatural Parricide, in de&s;troying the Fathers the Bi&s;hops, and in &s;pite of all the Ties of Gratitude and filial Reverence, pro&s;titute the Honour of his Mother the Church of <HI>England</HI> to his vile Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;|&s;ions, and expo&s;e her to Contempt and Scorn.

<HEAD>Po&s;t&s;cript.</HEAD>
<P>THE Adver&s;aries to the Book I have been defending, offer them&s;elves Evidences of its not being &s;o contemptible a Piece as they would repre&s;ent it; &s;ince with all the Efforts of impotent Malice, they fly from every Quarter to hi&s;s and &s;pit their Venom on it: For as I was concluding my Letter, the Pre&s;s was deli|vered of a mi&s;-&s;hapen Production, &s;prung from the di&s;ordered Brain of one <HI>J Dickin&s;on,</HI> who with the &s;ame degrees of A&s;&s;urance, as when Canting from his <HI>Tub,</HI> would commence an Advocate for <HI>Presbyterian Ordination;</HI> proceed|ing on the Principles peculiar to that Side, equal Pretences to the Mode&s;ty and Manners they are equal Strangers to. Tho' it mu&s;t be owned, the&s;e Scribblers have their &s;ingular Ta|lents, and that the <HI>Remarker</HI> as much excels in Craft and Quibble, as the <HI>Defender</HI> does in Vani|ty and Confidence, and therefore there mu&s;t be &s;ome Difference in dealing with them.</P>
<P>Having then treated the <HI>Remarker</HI> as he de|&s;erves, I &s;hall now Remark on the <HI>Defender,</HI> with re&s;pect to things peculiar to him; and &s;hall not repeat what I have &s;aid to the In&s;tances where they fall into the &s;ame Ditch, in climbing

over the Hedge de&s;ign'd to keep them out of the Pa&s;toral Charge. For like the Herds of o|ther Animals, if one breaks loo&s;e, all are prone to follow the Tracks of the fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>To detect his Fallicies, and prove the Truths he has denied, and illu&s;trate tho&s;e he has ob|&s;cured, I &s;hall fir&s;t animadvert on his <HI>Preface</HI> and <HI>Introduction,</HI> and then on what the bold Pre|tender li&s;ps on every Head.</P>
<P>The <HI>Preface</HI> gives the Idea of the Man, and di&s;covering his Petulence and Ignorance, plain|ly &s;nows the narrow View he has, of what Ex|tent and Order the My&s;tical Body of Chri&s;t has been in all Ages, and is in the pre&s;ent; el&s;e how could he have &s;ugge&s;ted that the Be&s;t and Brighte&s;t Part of the Catholick Church is an up&s;tart Sect? We will here allow him all the Club of <HI>Socinians, Antinomians, Muggletonians,</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, joined in a Confe|deracy with all the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> there, and upon a fair Poll contend, that they all together are not One to Ten, who are hearty and &s;trenuous A&s;&s;ertors of <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> there, and that all the <HI>Sectaries</HI> in the World, are not One to Twenty in the Catholick Church, who maintain it in all its Powers and Rights.</P>
<P>And however far Zeal and Charity may be the Objects of tho&s;e Per&s;ons Envy, who are of his Size of thinking, yet we cannot allow it to be an Exce&s;s of one, or a Defect in the other, to deny the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Separati&s;ts the Favour of &s;orouding them&s;elves under the Covert of Fo|reign Churches; for the one oppo&s;e <HI>Epi&s;copacy,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="002510_0055_0FDB64959D8C6C30">
and the Men of Learning and Con&s;cience in the other condemn them for it. But here with re|&s;pect to all, the Maxim holds univer&s;ally true, That if the Premi&s;&s;es are ju&s;t, Con&s;equences make them&s;elves, which &s;uch are to look to as are affected with them. Nor does any thing that is or can be &s;aid upon the Subject, Un|church any <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> who have proper Mini|&s;ters and Sacraments, neither doth it Unchurch them if they have not, for they never were nor are they now any Parts of the Catholick Church.</P>
<P>The Government will doubtle&s;s re&s;ent the advancing that &s;editious Po&s;ition, that the Do|ctrines of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and Non Re&s;i&s;tance, whereon is founded its own Security, are <HI>Jaco|bite Principles, and ought to be exploded.</HI></P>
<P>Pa&s;s we now to the <HI>Introduction,</HI> a meer jingle of Words, without Sen&s;e or Signification, unle&s;s in &s;ome Strokes, where it was well if they had had none.</P>
<P>I have in my Reply to the <HI>Remarker,</HI> given the Sen&s;e of tho&s;e venerable Per&s;ons on the Ca&s;e, who&s;e Voices the <HI>Defender</HI> has the A&s;&s;u|rance to &s;ollicit for him, and &s;hall only add, that the Rea&s;on why <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> are &s;o fond of <HI>Aerius,</HI> &s;eems to be, that he being branded for an <HI>Arian</HI> as well as <HI>Schi&s;matick,</HI> they are willing to pay a Deference to his Opinions in Doctrine, as well as in Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Mode&s;t Proof</HI> would have &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ome difference betwixt <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Presbytery,</HI> by alledging, that tho' <HI>Epi&s;copal Rights</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="002510_0056_0FDB649713BB77C8">
had deen early u&s;urped upon by the Papal <HI>Hie|rarchy,</HI> yet that they had not been di&s;puted by the other for 1400 Years together; but this the <HI>Defender</HI> won't grant, but infers that becau&s;e there were Papal U&s;urpations on that Order, therefore <HI>Presbyterian Government</HI> was &s;et up at <HI>Rome</HI> before that Period.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Defender</HI> and the <HI>Pope</HI> agreed not only in that Point, but in that of Infallibili|lity, yet I do not conceive him &s;o incapable of Error, as to have had any Occa&s;ion for the Ex|clamation, <HI>Have I mi&s;taken this Author all this while?</HI> Yet he has; and it is impo&s;&s;ible for him, or any that would defend his Principles, not to go on in an endle&s;s Mi&s;take; and particularly he errs in the In&s;tances he has brought here of his being infallible.</P>
<P>For however near the Nature of the <HI>Stygian,</HI> the Waters of <HI>Geneva</HI> Lake may be, and how|ever &s;wift the <HI>Geneva Raven</HI> in its Flight, yet Thanks to the Glorious Head of the Church, it was pre&s;erved from being poi&s;oned with their pe&s;tiferous Influences: And therefore it will not follow, that there are no real <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> in the Nor|thern Kingdoms, tho' <HI>Bugenhage</HI> was improved as an In&s;trument of the Reformation in <HI>Denmark,</HI> where we are a&s;&s;ured there are two <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hops</HI> and thirteen <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> any more than that contra|ry to known Fact and the Truth of Hi&s;tory, there were no <HI>Superintendants</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where <HI>Knox</HI> was improved as a like In&s;trument.</P>
<P>Having thus accounted for the Truth and Sen&s;e of the <HI>Preface</HI> and <HI>Introduction,</HI> let us now
<PB N="57" REF="002510_0057_0FDB649BEF441518">

<P>Fir&s;t H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, and here he begins with the <HI>Re|marker</HI>'s Iniquity of adding to the Scriptures, creating <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and giving Commi&s;&s;ions at plea&s;ure, and therefore let them both &s;tand to the &s;ame Correction I have already given that Wickedne&s;s. And I &s;hall only further ob&s;erve, that either &s;ome evil Genius mu&s;t have cull'd out for them both, that Pa&s;&s;age of Mr. <HI>Sage,</HI> (who&s;e drift there was to prove a Truth that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> had not at the time he was upon, re|ceived their la&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion for Government) or that they mu&s;t be judicially hardened, to have read that Book unto that Pa&s;&s;age, and not have dropped the Pen out of their trembling Hands, &s;truck with the &s;trength and light of the Argu|ments, adduced there for <HI>Epi&s;copcy.</HI> But rather than yield that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion was continued after their fir&s;t return, they will re|nounce their own Friends, and deny Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> to be their Oracle, who in <HI>Luke</HI> 10.19. &s;ays, <HI>He repeated, ratified and enlarged their Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>But under this Head there are &s;ome Strokes peculiar to the <HI>Defender,</HI> which mu&s;t not e&s;cape their ju&s;t Rebukes; as that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were no Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, while ble&s;t with their Ma&s;ter's Pre&s;ence upon Earth, and that in that Interval there was no Go&s;pel Church. Upon this Point I de&s;ire a Re&s;olution of the&s;e <HI>Queries;</HI> Might not Believers in the Me&s;&s;iah the Lamb of God come to take away the Sins of the World, e&s;pecially when baptized in that Faith, be accounted Mem|bers of the Go&s;pel Church? and was our Savi|our's
<PB N="58" REF="002510_0058_0FDB649E9170C090">
Mini&s;try &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful, as to gain no Converts to the Faith of this Article? Were not tho&s;e who in &s;o many Words are &s;aid, <HI>Luke</HI> 9.6. to have went through the Towns preach|ing the Go&s;pel, Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel? And is the Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection the only Ar|ticle of the Chri&s;tian Faith? If the <HI>Defender</HI> an|&s;wers con&s;i&s;tently with the Principle he here ad|vances, he mu&s;t be concluded to be far removed from, and preach another Go&s;pel than that of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Another grand Mi&s;take he here labours un|der, is with re&s;pect to the <HI>Deacons</HI> Office, part of which, it is readily granted, was their being charged with the Church Stock, and the care of the Poor; but here he &s;trains the Point unto &s;o high a Pin, that he would have it to be the on|ly thing they were ordained to, and for this purpo&s;e would feign the&s;e Suppo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the primitive Church was &s;o im|men&s;ly Rich in re&s;pect to what it is at pre&s;ent, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity there &s;hould be or|dained Trea&s;urers for the Charge of their Wealth, tho' according to him, the Church Stock is &s;ince fallen &s;o low, that there is no Occa&s;ion now for tho&s;e ordained Officers, page 13.</P>
<P>Secondly, That they had their Lazarettos and Ho&s;pitals, where the Poor were &s;et at Tables, and whereat the&s;e Trea&s;urers were to &s;erve.</P>
<P>Now that there is no ju&s;t Foundation for the&s;e Fancies, will appear from the&s;e Reflections.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Tho' &s;ome &s;old their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions for the good of the Community, yet it's plain the chief
<PB N="59" REF="002510_0059_0FDB64A0104F4EE8">
Support of their Poor, was from Collections among the Churches, who, according to their Abilities, mini&s;tred to each others Nece&s;&s;ities. But what were they to the Riches and Reve|nues of the Churches every where at pre&s;ent? And even in the Meetings in this Country, large Sums are often collected, under the Colour of charitable U&s;es; &s;o that if there was Rea&s;on to have Officers ordained for the Charge of them <HI>then,</HI> it mu&s;t be owned there is much more Rea|&s;on <HI>now.</HI> But,</P>
<P>Secondly, What a groundle&s;s Fancy is it, that in the wandring per&s;ecuted State of the Church, there &s;hould be &s;uch Attendance given to the Poor at Tables, and that by ordained Mini&s;ters? But the <HI>Defender</HI> &s;eems utterly ignorant of the Nature of tho&s;e Tables, which were &s;uch where the Euchari&s;t was celebrated; and for his In|&s;truction, I refer him to the Opinion of the An|cients concerning the <HI>Deacons</HI> Office about them. Thus <HI>Ju&s;t.

And there|fore here we are to ob&s;erve, what I have made appear in dealing with the <HI>Remarker,</HI> that be&s;ides the&s;e lower Offices of the care of the Churches Stock and Poor, and Attendance upon the Eu|chari&s;tical Tables, they were ordained for the

Superior, of preaching and baptizing. Nor will the <HI>Defender</HI>'s &s;hift, here avail him, that the <HI>Dea|cons</HI> preached as <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> for that is a plain Tautology, and no more than they preached as Preachers, <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> being the <HI>Greek</HI> of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h Go&s;peller,</HI> and both mean a preacher of the Go&s;pel. So that if the <HI>Defender</HI> would &s;peak Sen&s;e, he mu&s;t &s;ay, they evangelized or preach|ed as <HI>Deacons.</HI> Tired theerefore with the&s;e li&s;ps, let us hearken to what is uttered from the</P>
<P>Second Head, From <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the <HI>Defender</HI> breaths nothing but the Vanity and Vapours of an empty, Skull, for the Defence of which, from being crackt, (if it is not &s;o already) he will have occa&s;ion now to <HI>hold up his Shield;</HI> for by his Mr. <HI>Hereboord</HI>'s leave, one of the meane&s;t of the Tribe of <HI>Praelati&s;ts,</HI> will undertake to an|&s;wer his Herculean Argument by another <HI>ad Ho|minem,</HI> tho' it equally affects all the Parity Tribe.</P>
<P>They are bold and in&s;olent Intruders into the Inclo&s;ure wherewith our Lord has fenced his Vineyard, who u&s;urp the Mini&s;terial Function without being ordained to it by a Succe&s;&s;or to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> in whom, by the original Charter, the Powers of Ordination and Juri&s;diction over a plurality of <HI>Presbyters</HI> in Churches, are annex|ed either in Fact or Right, as I have explained the&s;e Words in my Reply to the <HI>Remarks;</HI> but <HI>Jonathan Dickin&s;on</HI> was never ordained by any &s;uch Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Ergo, <HI>Jonathan Dickin&s;on</HI> is a bold and in&s;o|lent intruder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and no Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;|pel at <HI>Elizabeth-Town;</HI> and therefore in the
<PB N="61" REF="002510_0061_0FDB64A785AA7080">
mentioned Reply he will find a full An&s;wer to his Sophi&s;m, which &s;uppo&s;es, that there is but one &s;ingle Office contained in the Commi&s;&s;ion, and one &s;ingle Part of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try. For there I have made it appear, that by the Expla|nations given of that Commi&s;&s;ion, by the Prac|tice of tho&s;e who acted by it, and who being under the infallible Direction of the Spirit, un|der&s;tood it fully; that there were &s;everal things contained in it, and &s;everal Offices warranted by it, as the Powers of Preaching, admini&s;tring the Sacraments, Ordination, and Government, by proper Officers, and that tho' all that di&s;charged any of tho&s;e Functions, acted by virtue of this Commi&s;&s;ion, yet that all were not authorized thereby, to do all that was contained therein, and I in&s;tanced that <HI>Deacons</HI> by virtue thereof, did preach and baptize, but not con&s;ecrate the Lord's Supper, nor meddle with the Powers of Ab&s;olution and Cen&s;ures, which <HI>Presbyters</HI> did; but not Ordain, becau&s;e not ve&s;ted witht the Epi&s;copal Powers of Ordination and Juri&s;dicti|on</P>
<P>So that there being &s;everal Parts of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try to be di&s;charged by &s;everal Officers, his Argument is lo&s;t, and is no more than they that are authorized by the &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ion, to the exerci&s;e of the &s;ame Parts of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, have the &s;ame Office and Authority: But now for want of a Minor, there is no Con|clu&s;ion, and &s;o the frightful Spectre vani&s;hes. But yet after this vain fit is over, we may ob|&s;erve him coming into Conce&s;&s;ions enough to
<PB N="62" REF="002510_0062_0FDB64A865F479F8">
give up the Cau&s;e, or Contradictinos enough to overthrow it. For he confe&s;&s;es that our Lord did maintain the Symmetry and Proportion, be|tween the Jewi&s;h Synagogue and the Chri&s;tian Church; and he has brought in Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> tel|ling us, who were the Officers there, a <HI>Bi&s;hop, Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons;</HI> from whence it nece&s;&s;ari|ly follows, according unto him, that tho&s;e Offi|cers are to be continued in the Chri&s;tian Church. And here he has given us the very thing we contend for. For by <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Government he doubtle&s;s means a Government that ought to be, and he &s;ays that having <HI>Bi&s;hops, Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> is an exact De&s;cription of this Govern|ment, which is all we plead for; and therefore we are only now to agree upon the Propriety of the Name, which after &s;o free Conce&s;&s;ions, he will not &s;urely be &s;o ill natured, as to deny to be Epi&s;copal; &s;ince &s;o excellent a Government ought to be denominated from its mo&s;t excel|lent Title.</P>
<P>In my Rea&s;oning with the <HI>Remarker,</HI> I have fully replied to what the <HI>Defender</HI> has offered un|der the <HI>Third Head,</HI> tho' he has here one pecu|liar Stroke, in denying St. <HI>Paul</HI> the Honour of being an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> for before his Conver&s;ion he had not &s;een our Lord, and the <HI>Defender</HI> expre&s;ly &s;ays, none could be admitted into the <HI>Apo&s;tolate,</HI> but &s;uch as had &s;een <HI>Je&s;us</HI> before his Death. He indeed afterwards owns him as an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> but that however, involves him in a Contradiction Proceed we now to what he &s;ays from the</P>
<P>Fourth Head, And &s;ince this chiefly relates to
<PB N="63" REF="002510_0063_0FDB64AC8DA846E0">
Facts, I mu&s;t clear them from his Mi&s;repre&s;en|tations; for doing this I &s;hall appeal to Scrip|ture, Rea&s;on, and Authorities. The In&s;tances are chiefly of <HI>James</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Timothy</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> as <HI>Titus</HI> of <HI>Crete,</HI> and the <HI>An|gels</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of <HI>the &s;even Churches in the le&s;&s;er A&s;ia;</HI> as for <HI>Matthias,</HI> it's granted his Call to the <HI>Apo&s;tolate</HI> was immediate, tho' probably his Con|&s;ecration to it, was by the <HI>Apo&s;tles;</HI> and &s;till the Probability advances in the <HI>Apo&s;tle Barnabas,</HI> who&s;e Call does not appear to have been imme|diate.</P>
<P>To begin therefore with <HI>James,</HI> there are ju&s;t Grounds from Scripture, as well as Authorities from the Ancients, to conclude for his being a|bove twenty Years re&s;ident <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> for when St. <HI>Paul,</HI> three Years after his Con|ver&s;ion, went to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> he found none other of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> there, &s;ave <HI>James,</HI> Gal. 1.18, 19.

<P>Come we now to the In&s;tance of <HI>Timothy,</HI> whom the bu&s;y Mocker had almo&s;t men ioned under the Stile of a <HI>Primate.</HI> If the Sting in the Tail be not Devil, be that as it is, he thereby de&s;igned a <HI>Hail King,</HI> and to treat that venerable Character, with an Air of Impiety, and the flouting Sneer of a Scorner; for nothing incen|&s;es them more, than the flaming Evidences that are produced of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s being ve&s;ted with pre|latical Powers, and therefore I &s;hall now take off the Exceptions he has &s;eign'd again&s;t them.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Will it follow, that becau&s;e <HI>Timothy</HI> had been with <HI>Paul</HI> in &s;everal Places, that he was not afterwards &s;ettled at <HI>Ephe&s;us?</HI> when the Words he ironically cites, do plainly prove he was, any more, than becau&s;e <HI>Jonathan Dickin&s;on</HI> has been &s;ometimes at a &s;chi&s;matical Seminary, and other Places, that therefore he is not now &s;ettled a pretended Pa&s;tor, at <HI>Elizabeth-Town,</HI></P>
<P>Nor,</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="002510_0065_0FDB64B03536E8D8">Secondly, Is there any more Evidence from <HI>Acts</HI> 20.25. of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s not being <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>E|phe&s;us,</HI> than there is from thence, of <HI>Jonathan Dickin&s;on</HI>'s not being the <HI>Defender</HI> of <HI>Presbyterian Ordination?</HI> And,</P>
<P>Thirdly, I believe <HI>Jonathan</HI> would look on any one of his Brethren with a jealous Eye, who &s;hould offer at the exerting any prelatical Pow|ers, in cen&s;uring his Manners, (for which by the way, there are ju&s;t Grounds for &s;ome others to do it) or charging him with un&s;ound Doc|trines, (which indeed don't &s;eem very Orthodox) and that he would ask the Que&s;tion, <HI>Who made thee a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">?</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, It's plain, if <HI>Jonathan</HI> can't pray better than he pleads, tho' it even be a very bad Cau&s;e, he has great need of a <HI>Common Prayer</HI> Book, as an In&s;trument under the Conduct of the Spirit, to help his Infirmities.</P>
<P>Fifthly, All Commi&s;&s;ions are exclu&s;ive of all but tho&s;e to whom they are granted; to con|vince M. A. <HI>Jonathan</HI> of this, &s;uppo&s;e his <HI>Deacon Tom</HI> &s;hould &s;tep up into his Stall, and alledge, that M.

A. <HI>Jonathan,</HI> for the recovery of his Desk, would &s;oon reply, Tho' you was not excluded by Name, yet you was by the Nature of Commi&s;&s;ions, which exclude all to whom they are not given; and tho' as a Chri&s;tian and a Parent, you may privately ex|hort your Neighbours, and teach your Children,

yet preaching in the proper Sen&s;e, is the pecu|liar Duty of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, All Accu&s;ations are not &s;landerous and evil Reports, for I have brought &s;ome very true and ju&s;t ones again&s;t the <HI>Defender,</HI> and &s;uch as it is the Prerogative of <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> to take Notice of, and puni&s;h &s;uch Per&s;ons of evil Report, as it was of <HI>Timothy,</HI> not as an <HI>Evangeli&s;t,</HI> and &s;o an extraordinary Per&s;on, as he dreams: For the <HI>Defender</HI> pretends to be an <HI>Evangeli&s;t,</HI> or Preach|er, and I am well a&s;&s;ured, he is no extraordina|ry Per&s;on, unle&s;s it be for Impertinence and Pre|&s;umption.</P>
<P>The next In&s;tance is <HI>Titus,</HI> whom the <HI>Defen|der,</HI> upo his bare Word, de&s;ires us to believe ne|ver returned to his See, after his Journey to St. <HI>Paul;</HI> but he has &s;o often fal&s;ified his Word, that we can't but disbelieve every thing he &s;ays: However, he has not here been carried on with his u&s;ual A&s;&s;urance, to deny what we plead for, that <HI>Titus</HI> di&s;charged the Epi&s;copal Office, while he was at <HI>Crete.</HI></P>
<P>We are at la&s;t come to the Company of <HI>An|gels,</HI> at the &s;ight of whom the <HI>Defender</HI>'s Head is filled with Apocaliptick Vi&s;ions, which want a new Revelation to explain them, and would from them infer, that becau&s;e &s;ometimes the Di&s;|cour&s;es in <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. re&s;pect tho&s;e <HI>Angels</HI> and their Churches, therefore they mu&s;t always do &s;o; and gives this as the only Rea&s;on for it, becau&s;e the plural Number is &s;ometimes u&s;ed there: Now if this be a good Argument, I have ten to one of &s;uch again&s;t him, where the &s;ingular

However, it's plain the <HI>Defender</HI> is an utter Stranger to the Idiom of Scripture Lan|guage, where an Anallagy of Numbers is ob&s;er|vable, as 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.15. <HI>She &s;hall be &s;aved in Child-bearing, if they continue in the Faith.</HI> In treating with the <HI>Remarker</HI> on this Point, I have accoun|ted for the Sen&s;e of the Word <HI>Angel,</HI> and that I have ju&s;tly done it, I have the Concurrent O|pinions of ancient and modern Divines, thus <HI>Aug.</HI> Ep. 162. <HI>Divina voce &s;ub Angeli nomine lau|datur praepo&s;itus Eccle&s;iae.</HI> The Governour of the Church is prai&s;ed by the Voice of God, under the Name of an Angel.

<P>And thus for the Epi&s;copal In&s;tances, that &s;till do, and ever will &s;tand impregnable, again&s;t all the Attacks that are made upon them by &s;aw|cy puny Scriblers.</P>
<P>We are now to enter upon a new Logical, I wi&s;h I could &s;ay, Rational Scene; where by Mood and Figure, the <HI>Defender</HI> would argue all the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try out of the World. But pre|vious to the Enquiry into the Nature of his <HI>Pa|ralogi&s;ms.</HI> we are to ob&s;erve, that a Word got into his Head, which he could not get rid of, and therefore without knowing its Meaning, &s;ets it down &s;everal times in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> and that is the Word <HI>Co-ordinate,</HI> which means Equality, and not Identity; &s;o that he has more Powers than he thought of; for if he is <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter,</HI> and they are <HI>Co-ordinate,</HI> he has two di&s;tinct Powers, tho' according to him, equal, and thus tho' all his Powers are <HI>Co-ordinate</HI> to his Brethren's, yet they are not numerically the &s;ame; the Powers he has are not the indivual Powers ano|ther has, tho' they may be equal or <HI>Co-ordinate.</HI></P>
<P>Having remarkt this Blunder, I am further to ob&s;erve, that in my Reply to the <HI>Remarks,</HI> I
<PB N="69" REF="002510_0069_0FDB64BD11F84BC8">
have accounted for the Community of Names mentioned in the Arguments, and how to ap|propriate them, and thither I refer him. It remains therefore, that I demon&s;trate, that by his way of Rea&s;oning, he has gratified the <HI>En|thu&s;ia&s;is</HI> and <HI>Libertines,</HI> in that by his Craft, he would clear the World of <HI>Prie&s;ts.</HI> In order to this, I mu&s;t &s;et down &s;ome Po&s;itions, which he has either expre&s;ly granted, or mu&s;t confe&s;s to.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, He affirms it to be ju&s;t arguing from a Community of Names, to a Co-ordination of Powers; that is, if he means any thing, that he who has any, or all of tho&s;e Names, is the &s;ame Officer, under all or any of tho&s;e different De|&s;ignations.</P>
<P>Secondly, He will doubtle&s;s grant, but in Ca&s;e he &s;hould not, &s;ince he has not mentioned them with the other Names, I &s;hall prove, that <HI>Deacon</HI> is a Name of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter. Thus 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.6. <HI>Col.</HI> 4.7.17. 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 3.2. the Words Mi|ni&s;ter or Mini&s;try, are in the Original <HI>Deacon,</HI> or <HI>Deacon&s;hip.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Page thirteenth he gives the Rea&s;on why <HI>Deacons</HI> are not now ordained, and that for want of Church Stock; tho' I think he don't want a &s;ort.</P>
<P>Now from the&s;e Po&s;itions, I will, by his way of Rea&s;oning, prove upon him the&s;e two things.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That there is a Church-Stock at <HI>Eliza|beth-Town,</HI> and that he is re&s;pon&s;ible for it, as he pretends to be the <HI>Deacon</HI> there.</P>
<P>Secondly, That to relieve him from his fear of Refunding, I will by the &s;ame way of Rea|&s;oning
<PB N="70" REF="002510_0070_0FDB64BE0D564A98">
prove, that he is no <HI>Deacon</HI> there, nor any where el&s;e, nor a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel at all, and &s;o not at the Place he pretends to be.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, By his way of Rea&s;oning, I prove there is a Church-Stock at <HI>Elizabeth-Town,</HI> and that he is re&s;pon&s;ible for it, as he pretends to be <HI>Dea|con</HI> there: Thus by his way of arguing,</P>
<P><HI>Bi&s;hops, Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> are a Communi|ty of Names for Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, from whence it's ju&s;t to argue, a Co-ordination of Powers. I &s;uppo&s;e he means an Identity of Offices, if he has any meaning.</P>
<P>But <HI>Jonathan Dickin&s;on</HI> &s;ays, that the Commu|nity of Names with their <HI>Co-ordinate</HI> Powers, that is an Identity of Offices, if his Words have any Signification, are applicable to him:</P>
<P><HI>Ergo, Jonathan Dickin&s;on</HI> is a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter in all its Offices. Again,</P>
<P><HI>Deacons</HI> were ordained to the Care of the Church-Stock, where there was enough to be taken care of.</P>
<P>But <HI>Jonathan Dickin&s;on</HI> was ordained to the Office of a <HI>Deacon,</HI> that being one of the com|mon Names of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo, Jonathan Dickin&s;on</HI> is chargeable with the Churches Stock, which he mu&s;t an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>But le&s;t as an In&s;olvent he &s;hould think of running, I will relieve him under that Appre|hen&s;ion, and by his way of Rea&s;oning prove, that he had nothing to do with their Stock nor Church, and that he is no Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;|pel at all. Thus,</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="002510_0071_0FDB64BFA32B0D40"><HI>Deacon</HI> is one of the common Names of Go&s;|pel Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>But <HI>Jonathan Dickin&s;on</HI> for want of Church-Stock, was not ordained <HI>Deacon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> Is no Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, nor has any thing to do with Church or Stock.</P>
<P>And this Rule of Rea&s;oning will univer&s;ally hold with re&s;pect to all the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, which <HI>Jonathan Dickin&s;on</HI> has now &s;yllogized out of the World, by his ridiculous arguing from a Community of Names, to an Identity of Offi|ces; which he fal&s;ly calls a <HI>Co-ordination</HI> of Powers.</P>
<P>And now at la&s;t we are come to his Expo&s;tu|latory Conclu&s;ion, wherein he &s;ums up his idle Tales with the &s;ame Appeals to Belief, as if he was vending them to his credulous Audience; but what little regard they de&s;erve, I appeal to the World in the following Particulars.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The mo&s;t ob&s;erving Part of Mankind, mu&s;t and do grant, that the Contempt where|with the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> have treated the Epi&s;copal Character, and Sacerdotal Powers, has given Occa&s;ion to the <HI>Libertine</HI> to call in Que&s;tion the Truth of all revealed Religion; and to conclude that <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> of all Religions were the &s;ame, and no Truth in any.</P>
<P>Secondly, That as the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> fir&s;t encouraged the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Conventicles, by &s;ending their gifted <HI>Emi&s;&s;aries</HI> to hold forth among&s;t them; &s;o have they always promoted the&s;e Separations, with a De&s;ign to divide and weaken the <HI>Church of Eng|land,</HI> the chiefe&s;t Bulwark in Chri&s;tendom a|gain&s;t
<PB N="72" REF="002510_0072_0FDB64C110632508">
<HI>Popery,</HI> well knowing, that their <HI>Idolatry</HI> can never be introduced, but at the Breaches made on that Church, by <HI>Schi&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, That it is a very daring A&s;&s;urance in the <HI>Defender,</HI> whereby he would dive into the Political Rea&s;ons of State, whereby <HI>Presbytery</HI> is e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>North,</HI> as well as tolerated in <HI>South Britain.</HI> I hope he won't affirm it has ever been determined, by the Legi&s;lature, that it is a <HI>Jure Divino</HI> Government: Nay, the contrary &s;eems to be, and doubtle&s;s is, the fixed Opinion of the Legi&s;lature. For the King and the Officers of his Government are Members of the <HI>Church of Eng|land,</HI> and under the &s;tronge&s;t, the mo&s;t &s;olemn and &s;acred Engagements &s;o to be; &s;o that what|ever In&s;ults are offered, by the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> to the Church, are direct Affronts upon the Legi&s;la|ture, and their Sentiments of Things of the highe&s;t Con&s;equence, and is no le&s;s than to call in Que&s;tion, whether they be Members of a Church from which a Separation is groundle&s;s, and which with their u&s;ual Mode&s;ty and Duty they deny; and the Members of the Church, with a becoming Behaviour, and the &s;tronge&s;t Evidence, maintain and prove.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That it is in the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> own power, to put in Tune the jarring String, they are always harping on, and whence yet they &s;ay they can't bear the di&s;plea&s;ing Sound of un|churching <HI>Prote&s;tants.</HI> It has been already hinted, that nothing that can be &s;aid, doth Unchurch any that have true Pa&s;tors and Sacraments, and that tho&s;e who have not, are not organized
<PB N="73" REF="002510_0073_0FDB64C48853DDD0">
Parts of the My&s;tical Body of Chri&s;t; for whe|ther they will own it or no, the&s;e things are clear and demon&s;trably true.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the Notes of a true Church, are the Orthodox preaching of the Word, and the regular Admini&s;trations of the Sacraments, by Per&s;ons fully authorized for tho&s;e Functions.</P>
<P>Secondly, That from the Holy Scripiures, we are to learn what Doctrines are Orthodox, what the Nature of Sacraments, and al&s;o (there being now no immediate Mi&s;&s;ion from Heaven) what the Powers of Preachers and Admini&s;trators, and who are ve&s;ted with them.</P>
<P>And &s;ince it is the la&s;t of tho&s;e that has been now under Con&s;ideration, I appeal to the un|bia&s;&s;ed and di&s;intere&s;ted Part of Mankind, who they are who appear to have the true and only Title to tho&s;e Powers.</P>
<P>From all which the Inference is natural, that it as much concerns every one as his Salvation amounts to, to be well a&s;&s;ured that he is within the Pale of the true Church, and &s;its under the Means of Grace, and that at the great Audit, he &s;hall be owned by Chri&s;t, to have been a Mem|ber of his My&s;tical Body upon Earth.</P>

<P>In replying to whatever has the Face of Ar|gument in this Rhap&s;ody of the <HI>Son of Martin,</HI> alias <HI>Belial,</HI> I &s;hall prove,</P>

<P>Secondly, That neither Idolatry nor Here&s;y, &s;uppo&s;ing them universal in all the vi&s;ible Mem|bers of the Church, do invalidate the Offices and Functions of the Prie&s;thood.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002510_0076_0FDB64C8942EA428">Thirdly, That there are undeniable Eviden|ces, from Fact and Rea&s;on, that the Chain of Succe&s;&s;ion, in Epi&s;copal Government and Or|dinations, was never broke; and that the mo&s;t impious Ab&s;urdities follow, upon <HI>Mar-Prelates</HI> Suppo&s;ition, that ever it was, or could be bro|ken.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t I affirm, upon the highe&s;t as well as cleare&s;t Evidences, that the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try was founded in an Imparity of Officers, or ra|ther a proper Epi&s;copacy. This mu&s;t be gran|ted, if the Acts of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> are allowed to be Authentick, for the&s;e &s;hew them to have been inve&s;ted with a Superiority over &s;ome Brethren, <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> Acts 6.2, 8. 14.11, 12.22.12, 25.13.5. And while the E|pi&s;tles to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> are allowed to be Canonical, they will continue, and contain De|mon&s;trations, that tho&s;e who ordained <HI>Presbyters,</HI> had a Juri&s;diction both over them, and their Churches. 1 <HI>Tim</HI> 1, 3, 5, 19, 20, 22. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.10. And therefore, until Athei&s;m has di&s;proved the Authority of the &s;acred Regi&s;ter, wherein tho&s;e Te&s;timonies are pre&s;erved, the fir&s;t Particular mu&s;t be concluded certain. I proceed then</P>
<P>Secondly, to evince, that neither Idolatry nor Here&s;y, &s;uppo&s;ing them univer&s;al in all the vi|&s;ible Members of the Church, do invalidate the Offices, and the Functions of the Prie&s;thood. I &s;ay vi&s;ible Members, for to bring tho&s;e that are invi&s;ible into the Argument, is to go wide of the Ca&s;e: For an invi&s;ible Church can have only invi&s;ible Priviledges, and when it lo&s;es
<PB N="4" REF="002510_0077_0FDB64CA64BF0738">
them, or if it is capable of lo&s;ing them, cannot be known to us, and therefore the Di&s;pute can only refer to the vi&s;ible Church; and in that we are to ob&s;erve a va&s;t Difference betwixt even gro&s;s Idolatry, and a total Apo&s;tacy, the one of which does, tho' the other does not, de|&s;troy the very Being of a Church. Thus tho' the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> believes the Apo&s;tles Creed, probably in the &s;ame Sen&s;e, and upon the &s;ame Arguments with us, yet in as much as it wor&s;hips the true God, under improper Repre&s;entations, it cannot be excu&s;ed from the Charge of Ido|latry: Which, however, is &s;till a Crime of ano|ther Nature, than a full denying the God that is above, and the Lord that bought them, for this quite de&s;troys the Relation of God in Co|venant with any People, but the other puts them only &s;o far out of Favour, as they are capable, yet &s;till with a Pre&s;ervation of their Being: For none who have been admitted into the <HI>Peculium,</HI> are excluded from the Priviledges of it, until they have explicitly renounced the Advantages of being in it. Thus <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Acce&s;&s;ion to Ido|latry, did not vacate his Commi&s;&s;ion of being <HI>High Prie&s;t,</HI> nor the People's repeated Idolatry, deprive them of peculiar and di&s;tingui&s;hing Ble&s;|&s;ings, <HI>Neb.</HI> 9.18, 20. And while that Polity &s;tood, the Prie&s;thood remained, even until our <HI>High-Prie&s;t</HI> did abrogate that Oeconomy, with all its Rites, and Offices. And even in the early Times of Chri&s;tianity, we find Churches over|&s;pread with great Corruptions, as tho&s;e of <HI>Co|rinth,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.11. 5.7, 11, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

and tho&s;e in <HI>Rev.</HI> Ch. 2 and 3. and for them re|prehended, but their Being and Exi&s;tence, was never on that &s;core denied. And now granting his Argument, all the &s;trength it can have, and that for the &s;ake of the invi&s;ible Members, the Priviledges of the vi&s;ible Church were continued, I have the &s;ame Evidence on my &s;ide, that our Lord had an invi&s;ible Church, through all the Ages of Chri&s;tianity, for the &s;ake whereof, he pre&s;erved the Covenant Priviledges, to that which was vi&s;ible. This he mu&s;t grant, unle&s;s he confe&s;&s;es that the Gates of <HI>Hell</HI> had a greater prevalency over the Chri&s;tian, than the Jewi&s;h Church, which is a Suppo&s;ition too ab&s;urd, ei|ther to be asked, or allowed: And here we may ob&s;erve the partial Spirit of the Party, who al|ledge, that Idolatry, or Here&s;y, unchurches all, but &s;uch as they are; for according to them, the mo&s;t flagrant Impieties will not un&s;aint any, on their &s;ide. I come now</P>
<P>Thirdly, to evince, that there are undeniable Evidences, from Fact and Rea&s;on, that the <HI>Chain of Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> in Epi&s;copal Government and Or|dinations, was never broke, and that the mo&s;t impious Ab&s;urdities follow, upon <HI>Mar-Prelate</HI>'s Suppo&s;ition, that ever it was, or could be bro|ken.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, we appeal to Fact, that as the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try was founded in Epi&s;copacy, &s;o by all who have wrote the Hi&s;tory of the Church, from the Acts of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> to this Time, we have an Account of the Churches being univer&s;ally under Prelatical Government, as from <HI>Eu&s;ebius,
<PB N="6" REF="002510_0079_0FDB64D0181252B0">
Socrates,</HI> and <HI>Evagrius Schola&s;ticus,</HI> until about the Year 600, and from thence, every Country where Chri&s;tianity was planted, can produce Regi&s;ters of their <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and we challenge the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> to a&s;&s;ign a Time, after the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> when there was no Epi&s;copacy, or when it di&s;|continued in the Chri&s;tian Church, or to pro|duce any In&s;tance of a National Church, that ever was under the Government of meer Presby|ters before <HI>Calvin,</HI> or even &s;ince, but &s;ome very few that follow him, in other of his rigid No|tions. The In&s;tance of the <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">lder&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> can be of no Service to them here, unle&s;s they prove that their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs were carried on in a Parity, which they may, after their u&s;ual way affirm, but mu&s;t, as they always do, &s;ail in the Proof. Come we from Fact,</P>
<P>Secondly, To Rea&s;on upon the Ca&s;e, and I argue again&s;t the maintainer of that Paradox, that the <HI>Chain of Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> can, and has been bro|ken, from the&s;e two Arguments.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, If it is, the Chri&s;tian Religion is an Impo&s;ture. And</P>
<P>Secondly, Suppo&s;e it true, there are now no proper Mini&s;terial Powers therein.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, If the <HI>Chain of Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> is broke, the Chri&s;tian Religion mu&s;t be an Impo&s;ture, for the Author of it affirmed, that he would be with it until the end of the World: Now if he was not &s;o, but by withdrawing his Pre&s;ence, let it be broken, he failed in his Promi&s;e, the Con&s;e|quence whereof is, to disbelieve every thing he &s;aid; for no Rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for the
<PB N="7" REF="002510_0080_0FDB64D19B3F4010">
Faith of one Article, more than another, which equally depends upon the Veracity of the A&s;&s;er|tor, and if the one be found fal&s;e, the other can|not be proved true; and &s;o with our <HI>broken Chain,</HI> there is an end of Chri&s;tianity. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, If we &s;uppo&s;e a &s;ingle failure in this Point, it will make it impo&s;&s;ible, that there can be now any proper Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel; for when the Succe&s;&s;ion was interrupted, and the <HI>Chain</HI> broke, there mu&s;t either have been &s;ome Power lodged in the Community of Chri|&s;tians, to &s;oulder it again, or the Original Au|thor mu&s;t have made a &s;econd, or there mu&s;t now be none.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t as fal&s;e, cannot be proved, for in Fact tho&s;e Powers were originally left with pro|per Officers, and not with the Faithful, in com|mon, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.16 <HI>ad fin. John</HI> 20.19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Nor can any Laws of Nece&s;&s;ity, war|rant an Intru&s;ion, upon what is the peculiar Prerogative of a Divine Power to in&s;titute, namely, to appoint Per&s;ons to di&s;charge the Sa|cerdotal Functions, <HI>Numb.</HI> 16.40. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 13.8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 6.6, 7.2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26.19, 20, 21, 22. <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.4, 5.</P>
<P>Not the &s;econd, unle&s;s they will conde&s;cend upon the Time, Place and Per&s;ons, when and where this new <HI>Chain</HI> was forged, and to whom committed, and who tho&s;e are that are now linked in it; and prove that either our Lord came from Heaven to renew it, or delegated &s;ome by an audible Voice, or the Power of Miracles to vouch for their Commi&s;&s;ion to
<PB N="8" REF="002510_0081_0FDB64D667E1EA48">
that Purpo&s;e, which cannot be done. And there|fore,</P>
<P>Thirdly, It will nece&s;&s;arily follow, that upon &s;uppo&s;ing a Breach in the Succe&s;&s;ion, there has not been any Go&s;pel Mini&s;try &s;ince the Moment it happened, nor is there at pre&s;ent, nor can be for the future, without a new Revelation for it.</P>
<P>To &s;um up then the Evidence upon the Ar+gument, &s;ince it appears from the Divine Re|cords, that the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try was founded in Epi&s;copacy, and from the &s;ame, that neither Idolatry nor Here&s;y are able to invalidate the Sacerdotal Powers, that in Fact the Epi&s;copal Succe&s;&s;ion has continued uninterrupted through all the intermediate Ages from the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> Times to ours, and that the mo&s;t impious Ab|&s;urdities follow up <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the denial, the Con&s;e|quence is unavoidable, that the <HI>Son of Martin,</HI> who would marr Prelacy, and con&s;equentially &s;ubvert the Foundations of Chri&s;tianity, mu&s;t be a Son of Perdition.</P>
<P>Having thus accounted for what is material in that Libel, I turn to the Appendix, writ in|deed in a &s;ofter Strain, but &s;uperiour to the o|ther in the Arts of Sophi&s;try, for the one is one continued Rhodomantado, but the other now <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our View, has more of Cunning and De|&s;ign; the Author often varies Shapes and Cha|racters, to avoid the Stroke he might be &s;ubject to, under any one; for now he per&s;onates an <HI>Independent,</HI> and anon a <HI>Ruling Elder,</HI> which is
<PB N="9" REF="002510_0082_0FDB64D792E4EDE8">
exceeding di&s;ingenuous and unfair, to oblige us to enter the Li&s;ts with an Enemy in Ma&s;querade. It's true indeed, all the <HI>Sectaries</HI> militate under the &s;ame common Standard of <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> and <HI>Rebel|lion,</HI> but then it would be fair to di&s;tingui&s;h their Squadrons by their proper En&s;igns.</P>
<P>However, we mu&s;t take him in his way, (an Expre&s;&s;ion often u&s;ed ironically by him) and for his Conviction, as well as that of others, I &s;hall &s;et down &s;ome Preliminaries, which may give a ju&s;t turn of Thought to tho&s;e who have been under an unhappy Bia&s;s in the Controver|&s;y, and then give the true Sen&s;e of the Texts he mi&s;takes or mi&s;applies. As to the Prelimi|naries, I &s;hall</P>
<P>Fir&s;t explain the Nature of the Commi&s;&s;ion given to the <HI>Apo&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, con&s;ider the Nature of the Gift conferred in Ordination.</P>
<P>Thirdly, enquire whether the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or whether they were not ve&s;ted with proper Epi&s;copal Powers.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, As to the Nature of the Apo&s;tolical Commi&s;&s;ion, which is on all Hands agreed to be the Grand Charter for the Evangelical Mini&s;try, in all its Powers and Offices, it is delivered in &s;uch general and yet &s;o few Words, that it is by all confe&s;&s;ed, to contain more in its Nature than is expre&s;&s;ed; for taking in both Places where the Commi&s;&s;ion is mentioned, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19, 20. <HI>John</HI> 20.21, 22, 23. we find nothing to be expre&s;&s;ed in both of them, except the Powers of Preaching, of Ab&s;olution and Cen&s;ures, and
<PB N="10" REF="002510_0083_0FDB64DC99FF3278">
di&s;pen&s;ing one of the Sacraments; but then the other Sacrament mu&s;t al&s;o &s;urely be meant, as well as there mu&s;t be included therein the Pow|ers of Ordination and Government, and there|fore the Intent and Purport of this Commi&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be gathered from the Practice of the <HI>Apo|&s;tles,</HI> as they under&s;tood and explained it in their acting by and upon it.</P>
<P>By virtue whereof we find in Fact, that they ordained <HI>Deacons,</HI> be&s;ides &s;ome lower Offices to preach and to baptize, that in &s;ome Churches they &s;ettled <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as at <HI>Corinth,</HI> who had the Powers of both Sacraments and Cen&s;ures, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.5, 7, 12, 13. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2, 6. and that Dioce&s;an <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> in whom the Powers of Ordination and Jurisdiction over a Plurality of <HI>Presbyters</HI> &amp; Chur|ches were annexed, were &s;ettled by them, in their re&s;pective <HI>Sees,</HI> is evident from the In&s;tances of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and the <HI>Apocalyptical Angels,</HI> and is made fully to appear in the Defence of the <HI>Mode&s;t Proof.</HI> So that if following the Ex|planations given of this Commi&s;&s;ion by Apo&s;to|lick Practice be warrantable, the A&s;&s;ertors of Epi&s;copacy are undoubtedly right. Let us now</P>
<P>Secondly, Con&s;ider the Nature of the Gift con|ferred in Ordination, and thereby is unque&s;tion|ably meant the Office and the Power whereby to di&s;charge it, and not the Holy Gho&s;t, which never was, nor is it po&s;&s;ible to be, in the Power of Man to be&s;tow; for tho' indeed its Influences are conveyed by its glorious Author, through Means and In&s;truments, as the Word, Sacra|ments and Impo&s;ition of Hands, yet no Creature in a proper Sen&s;e, can be &s;aid to confer it; and
<PB N="11" REF="002510_0084_0FDB64DD92DE3340">
therefore the Expre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be taken in a me|taphorical Meaning, let it be u&s;ed by whom and on what &s;ide &s;oever. For tho' it's &s;aid the Holy Gho&s;t was given at the laying on of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> Hands, <HI>Acts</HI> 8.17. yet it is not &s;aid they gave it; and tho' our Church retains our Saviour's Form in its Ordinations, and the Ordainers de|&s;ire the Ordained may receive the Holy Gho&s;t, yet do not &s;ay that they be&s;tow it; their Action indeed is the Conduit of its Conveyance, but its &s;elf mu&s;t flow from the Fountain of it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Let us enquire whether the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or were not al&s;o ve&s;ted with proper Epi&s;copal Powers; and here the In&s;tan|ces are plain and numerous to prove them &s;o ve&s;ted, as in their Ordination of <HI>Deacons,</HI> Acts 6.5, 6. <HI>Elders in every City,</HI> Acts 14.23. and <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.5. And it's granted on each &s;ide, that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> were ve&s;ted with Juri&s;dicti|on over the <HI>Presbyters</HI> and the Churches too.</P>
<P>Having thus adju&s;ted the&s;e Preliminaries, I &s;hall now take hold on the <HI>Impartial Hand,</HI> if it is not too nimble or ill-natured to be taken in its own way; and all that is offered will be fully replied to, by &s;etting a few Texts in their true Light.</P>
<P>And Fir&s;t, As to 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6. I will take him in his own way, by condemning <HI>Calvin's In&s;ti|tutes,</HI> and admitting his <HI>Comment</HI> on the Text that <HI>Timothy</HI> was ordained by a <HI>Colledge of Presbyters;</HI> but then he mu&s;t grant al&s;o, that tho&s;e <HI>Presbyters</HI> were either <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> or meer &s;ingle <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> pre&s;iding among them in either Ca&s;e: If the fir&s;t, our Point is gained; for the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="002510_0085_0FDB64DF1150FBC0">
were not only <HI>Presbyters,</HI> but <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> al&s;o in the full and &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word, by the third Preliminary; and this will &s;ave the Credit and the Evidence of the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy</HI> for Epi&s;copacy, and be exactly agreeable to the Practice of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> if the &s;econd, its plain, that <HI>Paul</HI> alone conferred the Gift, that is, the Office and the Power of executing it, which is there its meaning, by the &s;econd Pre|liminary, and that the <HI>Presbyters</HI> only gave their A&s;&s;ent, it being impo&s;&s;ible in the Nature of the Thing, that the <HI>Presbyters</HI> could have any other Influence on the Act; for taking him in his own way, if the Gift conferred was the Holy Gho&s;t, (which by the way I do not grant) and if <HI>Paul</HI> alone did not con&s;er it, then every &s;ingle <HI>Presby|ter</HI> did that as well as he, and every one has Power to give it, which is contrary to his own Scheme, which confines it to the <HI>Apo&s;tles;</HI> and it will follow, that the more ordaining <HI>Presbyters</HI> there be, the more of the Holy Gho&s;t the ordain|ed &s;hall receive; and in that Ca&s;e, who would not covet to be ordained by an <HI>Oecomenical Coun|cil</HI> of them, and with &s;uch va&s;t Collations of it &s;uch a Per&s;on might be fitted al&s;o to be <HI>Pa&s;tor of the Oecomenical Church,</HI> and in Proportion, tho&s;e who had fewer Ordainers, had fewer Shares in this Gift or the Holy Gho&s;t, and proportionably would be of le&s;s u&s;e to the Church. Or if by Gift be under&s;tood the Office and the Powers for its Execution, as &s;eems mo&s;t evident, then if <HI>Paul</HI> did <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> alone confer it, it will follow, that each ordaining <HI>Presbyter</HI> conferred a Part, or the Whole
<PB N="13" REF="002510_0086_0FDB64E314226758">
of his Gift; if a Part, it would gratify the Pub|lick, to conde&s;cend upon what Part, or how ma|ny there mu&s;t be to make up the Whole; if each Ordainer conferred the whole Gift, then in pro|portion to their Number, mu&s;t the Offices be multiplied, and then in&s;tead of one, there might be a dozen or more Offices conferred, according to the Number of Ordainers. From the&s;e Refle|ctions therefore, and the Ab&s;urdities that flow from them, it mu&s;t be owned, that if there were <HI>Presbyters</HI> who laid their Hands with <HI>Paul</HI>'s on <HI>Ti|mothy,</HI> that it could be only to expre&s;s their Con|&s;ent; &s;o that whether that Place refers to the <HI>Presbyterate</HI> or <HI>Epi&s;copate,</HI> he is extreamly &s;illy who affirms this to be an Eva&s;ion, it being demon&s;tra|ble from the very Nature of the Action, that it could be for no other End. A Second Text is <HI>Acts</HI> 13.1. where he &s;ays, we &s;hall find <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> &s;eparated to their &s;pecial Mini&s;try a|mong the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> by the Hands of certain <HI>Pro|phets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> at <HI>Antioch,</HI> who were neither <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> nor <HI>Dioce&s;ans,</HI> but has he proved it? no, that is an unu&s;ual Method with the Writers on that &s;ide; however, we cannot believe them, when the A&s;&s;ertion appears plainly fal&s;e, as it does in this Ca&s;e. For in that Text we find Per|&s;ons there of a &s;uperiour Character to meer <HI>Pres|byters,</HI> and yet only &s;aid there to be <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers;</HI> for it's certain <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> and as &s;uch of a &s;uperiour Character to meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and no Rea&s;on can be given to que&s;tion it in the others, for <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> not being al|ways mentioned under the Title of their highe&s;t

Office and Order, it will not follow, that tho' &s;ometimes named under the Character of their lowe&s;t Order, that they have no higher; and therefore it will follow, that if <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were (notwith&s;tanding their being called there <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI>) really <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> that the o|thers were al&s;o really &s;uch, tho' with them al&s;o mentioned under inferiour Characters.</P>
<P>As to 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. he here acts the di&s;ingenuous Part&punc; in not being po&s;itive which of the Expo&s;itions he is for, whe|ther he takes the <HI>Eliers</HI> for the &s;ame or one, as he words it, or for two kinds of <HI>Presbyters.</HI> I am ready to think he is &s;o far in the right, as to be for the former, and that he al|lows 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.12. to be a good Comment on that Text, the Sen&s;e whereof according to him, mu&s;t be, that part of your Office which is Doctrinal, is more to be honoured, than that which is Ruling; or you are to be honoured as a <HI>Ruler,</HI> but with half the Honour of a <HI>Teacher.</HI> Now this &s;illy Expo&s;ition can have no Con&s;equence, unle&s;s he can prove our <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> to have renounced their Powers of Preach|ing, when they were ve&s;ted with the Powers of Ruling; and &s;ince this is fal&s;e in Fact, it remains, that &s;ince to their Powers of Preaching, there are added the Powers of Ru|ling, and both Offices joined, the honours annexed to them mu&s;t be al&s;o, and then it will follow, that they are to be honoured with all the Honours due to all the Offices.</P>
<P>Upon the whole therefore, &s;ince it's thus evident, even upon the <HI>Appendix maker</HI>'s own way of arguing, that <HI>Paul</HI> alone conferred the Office, with the Powers to execute it, the <HI>Presbyters</HI> only a&s;&s;enting to it, that tho&s;e who &s;e|parated <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> were Per&s;ons of a &s;uperiour Character to meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and that <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> who Rule well, and Labour in Word and Doctrine, are to be held worthy of more than double Honour, becau&s;e if there is a Complication of the Offices, there ought to be of the Honours annexed to them: The Con&s;equence is plain, that the <HI>Appendix maker</HI> has no le&s;s mi&s;taken his Argu|ment than the <HI>Remarker,</HI> and to borrow his own decent Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Confu&s;ion mu&s;t equally cover them both.</HI></P>
