<P><HI>Mr. Atwood, the fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner</HI> give a long Charge to the Jury, aggravating the Facts &s;uppo&s;ed again&s;t the Pri&s;oner, &amp; po&s;itively a&s;&s;erting, That tho&s;e Facts not only were Per&s;on within the words of this Act of A&s;&s;embly, but al&s;o by the Common Law before the Statute of the 25 <HI>E. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></P>

<P>By your Honour's permi&s;&s;ion I am of Council for Coll. <HI>Bayard</HI> the Pri&s;oner at the Barr, but by rea&s;on I am unwilling to &s;pend too much of your time, this Tryal already having been very long, and Mr. <HI>Nicoll,</HI> who is al&s;o of Council of the &s;ame &s;ide, having among&s;t other things made it very evident, that for the Subject to Petition his Maje&s;ty, is their antient and undoubitable Right.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore make it may bu&s;ine&s;s only, as near as <HI>I</HI> can, to demon|&s;trate to this Court and Jury, That had the King's Council made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mple proof of all the Matters of Fact alledged in the Indictment, as the &s;igning the Addre&s;&s;es, and other things therein contained, to have been true; yet in point of Law they cannot amount to that grand Crime of <HI>High <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rea&s;on</HI></P>
<P>In order to this, &s;hall with as much brevity as I can, examine into, and put your Honours in mind, and withal inform the Gentlemen of the Jury what the Law of <HI>England</HI> by which we are or ought to be govern'd here) hath been, for near the &s;pace of four hundred years la&s;t pa&s;t, relating to this grand Crime of High-Trea&s;on: whereby it will manife&s;tly appear how cautious the Parliaments of <HI>England</HI> have been, in making and increa&s;ing the Laws to take away me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s lives, and particularly for High-Trea&s;on. And &s;hall begin with the Statute of 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. a Statute to which the greate&s;t Regard has been paid, of any Act of Parliament what|&s;oever, unle&s;s <HI>Magne Charta,</HI> as hereafter I &s;hall briefly &s;hew</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve to your Honours, that before the making of this Act of Parliament of the 25 <HI>E.</HI> 3. which was in <HI>Anno</HI> 1350 and which was the very fir&s;t Act relating to Trea&s;ons, &s;o many things were charged as High-Trea&s;on by the common Law, and there were &s;o many Ambiguities and Diver&s;ities of Opinions, that both Hi&s;tory and our Books of the Law &s;ufficiently inform us, that &s;carcely any man knew how to behave him&s;elf. But now by this Statute the particulars and Species of this grand Crime are reckoned up, and all others excluded, till declared by Parliament.

<P>This Act of Parliament is branch't out by <HI>Sir Edw. Cook</HI> in the 3d part of his <HI>In&s;titutes,</HI> into fix Cla&s;&s;es or Heads, which I &s;hall the rather take Notice of, for that Tryals of this Nature are very rare in the Plantations; and they are the&s;e,

<P>Now if there is any other Offence, which was not comprehended within one of the&s;e Cla&s;&s;es, the &s;ame was thereby declared to be no Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>In the Clau&s;e of which Act of Parliament, we find the&s;e words, which I &s;hall the rather read, becau&s;e I apprehend it will very much concern this en&s;uing Tryal</P>
<P><Q>And becau&s;e that many other like Ca&s;es may happen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to come, which a Man cannot think of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">are at this pre&s;ent time.

<P>By this we may ea&s;ily perceive, and its very obvious, that this cau&s;e was made to prevent the Judges from taking upon them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> declare any thing to be High-Trea&s;on, but &s;uch as are particularly expre&s;t by this Sta|tute of 25 <HI>Ed</HI> 3. or by &s;ome other &s;ub&s;equent Act.</P>
<P>Again, in the Reign of <HI>Richard 2d.</HI> we find &s;undry other things were decla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by Parliament to be High-Trea&s;on, which were not comprehenced within the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 25 <HI>Ed</HI> 3.

<P>Now this Statute, I am humbly of Opinion, is directly in the Negative, which &s;ays. That for the future nothing &s;hall be adjudged Trea&s;on, other|wi&s;e than it was ordained by the afore&s;aid Statute 25 Edw. 3</P>
<P>Yet neverthele&s;s this indictment is grounded up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an Act of A&s;&s;embly of this Province, which is, I am humbly of Opinion, not only contrary to, but directly repugnant to the afore&s;aid Statute (which appeareth to me to limit all new Species of Trea&s;on to be declared in Parliament, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> el&s;e where) Which if it &s;hould admit of &s;uch a Con&s;truction, as is now intended, I think I may mode&s;tly &s;ay, it will introduce five hundred &s;everal new &s;pecies of Trea&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o that his Maje&s;ties good Subjects of this Province would fall under much greater Hard&s;hips than whatever the People of <HI>England</HI> were &s;en&s;ible of before the making of this Act, which I cannot to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> often mention, the 25 Edw. 3.</P>
<P>If we look further downward upon the coming in of Edw 6 which was in the Year 1546. &s;undry new &s;pecies of Trea&s;on having been again introduced by Act of Parliament, it was in the very fir&s;t Year of his Reign Enacted, That no Offence made Trea&s;on by any Statute, &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o deemed and adjudged for the future, but &s;uch as were made Trea&s;on by the afore&s;aid S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at. 25 Edw. 3. other than &s;uch as were by that pre&s;ent Statute ordained and declared.</P>
<P>But yet in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Time, in the fir&s;t year of her Reign, this grand Crime was brought to its an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ient Standard, and it was then declared in Parliament. <HI>That no Act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> what&s;oever &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Trea&s;on or Mi&s;pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ion of Trea&s;on but &s;uch as were decla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> by the Statute</HI> 25 Edw. 3. and the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Preamble is this, <HI>That the &s;tate and &s;afety of the King &s;tandeth more a&s;&s;uredly by the Love of his Subjects than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of his Laws</HI></P>
<P>So that upon Examination, we find how careful and cautious the People &amp; Parliament of <HI>England</HI> have been in introducing and increa&s;ing of Sangui|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ary Laws, and that through the Revolution of many Ages.

<P>If we look but into the Bill of Attainder of <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> in the year 1640, &amp; 41. even in tho&s;e times, what Regard was paid to this Statute, which I have &s;o often mentioned, wherein it was provided, That the Judgment again&s;t &s;aid Earl &s;hould never be drawn into Pre&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent.

<P>Now, if we do but Reflect upon the great Concern and Care that has been taken through all Ages, by the wi&s;e People of <HI>England,</HI> in preve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">g, the Judges from in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erpre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing any A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t or Thing what&s;oever to be Trea&s;on, but &s;uch only as are enumerated in the Statute 25 <HI>Edw</HI> 3.</P>

<P>Now both the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le, Preamble and Words of this Act of A&s;&s;embly, and the cau&s;e of making thereof, is very obvious (however the &s;ame may be now interpreted) which were the&s;e two.</P>

<P>I very well remember that the Court was plea&s;ed to tell the Jury, after they had been together &s;ome days, and not being agreed upon the Verdict, <HI>That if they were under any Difficulty whether the Overt Acts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Indictment, if proved, were Trea&s;on, of they found the Pri&s;oner Guilty, he had his Remedy by moving the Matter of Law in Arre&s;t of Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>I therefore humbly offer, in arre&s;t of Judgment, That if the Overt Acts laid in the Indictment were admitted to be proved, yet in point of Law they cannot amount to High-Trea&s;on, within the meaning of the Act of A&s;&s;embly upon which the Indictment is laid.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="001038_0039_0FAEF1BF233C3F98">
For I take it that all Acts of Parliament, and con&s;equently Acts of A&s;|&s;embly, are to be under&s;tood and taken by rea&s;onable Con&s;truction, to be gathered and collected out of the words of the Act only, and that accor|ding to the natural, grammatical, plain and legal Sen&s;e thereof, without any forc'd Interpretation.</P>
<P>Then if &s;o, this Act of A&s;&s;embly both by the Title, Preamble, and the Enacting part thereof, plainly demon&s;trates the meaning of the Law-makers, and what was thereby de&s;igned for the future to prevent. The Title of this Act is in the&s;e words, <HI>An Act for the Quieting and Settling the Di&s;orders that have lately happened within this Province, and for e&s;tabli&s;hing and &s;ecuring their Maje&s;ties pre&s;ent Government again&s;t the like Di&s;orders for the future.</HI> Now what the&s;e Di&s;orders were, we have great cau&s;e to remember, and they are very well known to this Court to have been occa&s;ioned by &s;ome Per&s;ons &s;etting up an Arbitrary Power over the Kings Subjects with|out Authority from the Crown of <HI>England</HI> as appears from the Preamble of the &s;aid Act, part whereof is in the&s;e words, <HI>And whereas the late ha&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y and incon&s;iderate Violation of the good and quiet of this Province by the &s;eting up a Power over their Maje&s;ties Subjects, without Authority from the Crown of</HI> England, <HI>both vitiated and deba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hed the Minds of many People.</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For the prevention whereof in time to come, Be it exacted,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That what&s;oever Per&s;on or Per&s;ons &s;hall by any manner of ways, or upon any pretence what&s;oever, endea|vour by fore of Arms or otherwi&s;e to di&s;turb the Peace, Good and Quiet of this their Maje&s;tie Government as it is now e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;halt be deemed and e&s;teem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d as Rebells and Traytors, &amp;c</HI></P>
<P>From hence it plainly appears, that the Intention of the Law-makers was only to declare &s;uch Per&s;on or Per&s;ons Rebels and Traytors as &s;hould, for the future &s;et up a Power over his Maje&s;ties Subjects in this Province, with|out Authority from the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> which undoubtedly is Trea&s;on within the Statute of 25 <HI>Edw</HI> 3</P>
<P>But it can never he under&s;tood, (without the greate&s;t of Violence to the rea&s;onable Con&s;truction of the &s;aid Act of A&s;&s;embly, &amp; the plain Intention of the Makers thereof) to be con&s;trued to extend to the &s;igning the Ad|dre&s;&s;es mentioned in the Indictment, which is the only thing the Pri&s;oner is po&s;itively charged withal; for all the re&s;t are only pre&s;umtive, con&s;truc|tive and accumulative Crimes drawn from thence.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays <HI>Mr Solicitor,</HI> the words of this Act of A&s;&s;embly are in generals, <HI>That if any Per&s;on &s;hall endeavour by force of Arms, or Otherwi&s;e to di&s;turb the peace, good and quiet of the Government, &s;hall be deemed and e&s;teemed Rebels and Traytors.</HI></P>
<P>Now from the word <HI>[Otherwi&s;e] Mr. Solicitor</HI> would fain in&s;inuate that the Pri&s;oner is within the meaning of the Act of A&s;&s;embly: A very fine Explanation! for by &s;uch a Con&s;truction as this every breach of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;uddain Quarrel or &s;mall Battery &s;hall be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emed Trea&s;on.

That here in the Plantations we are not capable in our A&s;&s;emblies to make and declare any new Species of Trea&s;on, but &s;uch as are comprehended in the Statute 25 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dw</HI> 3. or &s;ome other &s;ub&s;equent Statute.</P>

<SPEAKER>Solicitor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Emot,</HI> The&s;e Authorities which you have here cited, its true, are grounded upon the Statute which you have mentioned of 12 <HI>Ed</HI> 2. but this Statute has only relation to Writs, and in this ca&s;e the Sheriff &s;um|moned the Jury not by virtue of a Writ, but a Precept under the hands of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, which differs the ca&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emot</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Solicitor,</HI> Then you &s;ay that the ca&s;e at the Bar is not within the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ords of this Stat. 12 <HI>Ed</HI> 2 for that this is a Precept to &s;ummon the Jury, and not a Writ, and to con&s;equently the Sheriff not obliged to &s;ign and return the &s;ame. A very wi&s;e Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>However, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, that this Precept is within the Rea&s;on and Equity of the Statute, and that the &s;ame ought to be returned and &s;igned by the Sheriff In order thereto I &s;hall put this Court in mind, how Statutes have from time to time been taken by Equity in divers manners, that tho&s;e things which are alike in Rea&s;on, are alike in Law; and that where an Act of Parliament hath been made to remedy &s;ome Mi&s;chiefs, that the &s;ame hath been extended to other things in like Degree, and that even in Penal Law. <HI>As for Example:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stat. of Glouce&s;ter. cap. 5</HI> By this Statute, an Action of Wa&s;te is given again&s;t one who holds for years; yet by the Equity of this Statute, a man &s;hall have an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ction again&s;t him who holds but for half a year, notwith|&s;tanding the Act be Penal.</P>
<P><HI>We&s;tm 2. cap. 3.</HI> This Statute gives an Action of <HI>cui in vita,</HI> after the Coverture di&s;&s;elved by Death, Yet if the Coverture be di&s;&s;olved by Divorce; the Wife &s;hall have, by the equity of this Statute, a Writ of <HI>cut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></HI></P>
<P>And la&s;tly, the <HI>Stat. 25 Edw. 3. de proditionibus,</HI> This Statute expre&s;&s;ly &s;ays, That no ca&s;e &s;hall be taken by equity unle&s;s it be adjudged in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arlia|ment; and yet by the equity of the words of that Statute, which are, <HI>If the Servant kill the Ma&s;ter,</HI> it is taken, <HI>If the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d kill the Ma&s;tre&s;s,</HI> That this is Petty Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>So that from hence I am humbly of Opinion, That we are fairly within the Equity of this <HI>Stat. 12 Edw.</HI> 2. Be&s;ides, a Writ and Precept in this Ca&s;e are only S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nonimous Terms, and &s;ignifie one and the &s;ame thing.</P>
</SP>
<P>The&s;e Rea&s;ons were Over-ruled.</P>
<P>And the Court ordered the Sheriff to make a Return upon the Precept to &s;ummon the Jury, conform to the above <HI>Stat. 12 Edw.</HI> 2. which the Court &s;aid they had power to do, and to help that Defect.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emot.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find your Honour has Over-Ruled all the Rea&s;ons that we have offered in arre&s;t of Judgment, in behalf of the Pri&s;oner Coll <HI>Bayard,</HI> why Judgment ought not to pa&s;s again&s;t him, according to the Verdict of the Jury; but have not as yet ob&s;erved that either Coll. <HI>D' Pey&s;ter</HI> or Capt. <HI>Walters</HI> have given their Opinion to all or any of the Rea&s;ons we have offered.
