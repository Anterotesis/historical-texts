<P>O! wor&s;hip the Lord in the Beauty of Holine&s;s,&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT is a common Mi&s;take which hath too much prevailed in the&s;e Times, and in this Country, and that even among &s;ome well-meaning People, that they &s;eem to account the Hear|ing of Sermons, to be the principal and mo&s;t important and edifying Part of the publick Wor&s;hip of GOD. Hence, as it is very likely that Some, heretofore, left the Church under the Notion that they could el&s;ewhere meet with, what was then, though with very little Rea&s;on, called the mo&s;t powerful Preaching; &s;o Others may have conformed to the Church, principally, from being &s;en&s;ible (e&s;pecially in the late Times of Confu|&s;ion) that the Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity were more truly, more purely, and in a more in&s;tructive Manner taught in the Church than out of it. In which they indeed judged very rightly; and this was, among others, a very good Rea&s;on for their conforming to it. And as this was the principal Occa&s;ion with Many, of their coming over to us, &s;o it is not unlikely that there may be Some, with whom the Wor&s;hip of the Church, after all, may &s;eem but tolerable for the &s;ake of the Doctrine, and they may not, even yet, have any high Sen&s;e of the Excellency of it, and its va&s;t Preference to the extempore Way.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, it is very probable, that there are but too many of Tho&s;e who have been bred up, and lived
<PB N="4" REF="008892_0005_103092F14DC091A0">
all their Days in the Bo&s;om of the Church, and in the U&s;e of its publick Wor&s;hip; who, partly by Rea&s;on of the Com|monne&s;s of it, and partly their Negligence, and for Want of giving a due Attention to the Propriety and Excellency of every Part of it; may not be &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible what a Pearl of ine&s;timable Price they enjoy, nor duly thankful for it: As they daily breathe in the Air, and enjoy the Sun, and the Beauties and Fruits of the Earth, without being &s;o deeply &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e wonderful Favours and Ble&s;&s;ings of Provi|dence, (by Rea&s;on of the Commonne&s;s of them, and their own &s;trange Incogitancy) or being &s;o affectionately thank|ful for them, as the va&s;t Worth and Importance of them do mo&s;t rea&s;onably de&s;erve and require.</P>
<P>WHAT I aim at, therefore, in the following Di&s;cour&s;e, is to awaken us all, both of the one and the other Sort, to a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the intrin&s;ic Worth and Excellency of that Method of wor&s;hipping God our Heavenly Father, which we are &s;o happy as to enjoy in the <HI>Church of England;</HI> that we may be affectionately thankful to his kind Providence for &s;o ordering Things as to give us the ine&s;timable Advan|tage of it; that we may give the &s;tronger Attention to the Propriety and U&s;efulne&s;s of every Part of it; and that our Souls may be filled with the greater Devotion and Edifica|tion in the U&s;e of it; as being &s;en&s;ible that we do truly <HI>wor&s;hip God in the Beauty of Holine&s;s,</HI> and are under the greate&s;t Advantage of <HI>growing up in Holine&s;s and Comfort thro' Faith unto eternal Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>IT is indeed an un&s;peakable Advantage that we enjoy by the preaching of God's Holy Word, and particularly in this excellent Church, in that we have it explained to us in the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t intelligible Manner, and that according to the original Simplicity of the Go&s;pel. That being freed from human Schemes and Devices, we are &s;et at Liberty from all tho&s;e idle ab&s;urd and groundle&s;s Notions of God and the Go&s;pel, which, both tend to give us hard and un|worthy Apprehen&s;ions of <HI>the Father of Mercies,</HI> and to make his Go&s;pel, (the plaine&s;t and be&s;t Thing in the World) a meer unintelligible Riddle, almo&s;t void of common Sen&s;e; and at the &s;ame Time, to weaken and enervate it's mo&s;t powerful Motives to the utmo&s;t Vigour and Activity on our

Part, and to di&s;courage our earne&s;t Prayers and Endeavours, by filling us with endle&s;s Doubts and Fears, and dark Sur|mizes and De&s;pondencies: For in the Church we are led to attend to nothing but the plain Language and Meaning of the Holy Gho&s;t; and have all the mo&s;t &s;alutary Doctrines, Precepts, Promi&s;es and Threatnings of the Go&s;pel &s;o clearly &s;et before us, and the Way of our Duty and the Road to everla&s;ting Happine&s;s made &s;o plain, that <HI>he that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s may read,</HI> and <HI>the wayfaring Man though a Feel cannot err there|in:</HI> This I &s;ay is an un&s;peakable Happine&s;s, and we ought to prize it <HI>beyond Gold, even the fine&s;t Gold,</HI> and to <HI>ta&s;te a Sweetne&s;s in it</HI> beyond that <HI>of Honey, and the Honey Comb,</HI> and make Con&s;cience of diligently attending upon it; but yet &s;trictly &s;peaking, preaching is not to be con&s;idered as being properly a Part of the publick Wor&s;hip, but rather as an Appendage to it.</P>
<P>FOR the proper Notion of Wor&s;hipping God, con&s;i&s;ts in prai&s;ing him for all his Benefits, and praying to him for what&s;oever we want both for Soul and Body, and in devo|ting our&s;elves to his true and faithful Service: In all which we do, as it were, conver&s;e with the great <HI>Father of our Spirits,</HI> and have the neare&s;t Intercour&s;e with him that our Souls are capable of; and con&s;equently &s;hould put the greate&s;t Value upon it, as the principal End of our meeting together at the Hou&s;e of God; and that we may openly and jointly do all the Honour we can to him our common heavenly Father. So that if there were no Sermon at all, we &s;hould go together to the publick Offices of Prayer and Prai&s;e, with not a Whit the le&s;s Zeal and Forwardne&s;s; fora&s;much as our Bu&s;ine&s;s there, is, not to hear any new Thing, but to do our Duty to our great Creator, and Be|nefactor; e&s;pecially &s;ince the Reading of God's Holy Word is a great Part of our publick Wor&s;hip, and that, va&s;tly preferable to any human Compo&s;ition or Preaching what&s;oever.</P>
<P>LET us then learn to value Things in Proportion to the real Worth of them, and prefer the Wor&s;hip of the Church, for the &s;olid intrin&s;ick Worth and Importance of it, before any the mo&s;t eloquent Preaching: Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it there were no Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one very g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

Many that would hardly think it worth their While to go to Church meerly to wor&s;hip God, though that is by far the mo&s;t valuable and important Part of our publick Service. And we ought to account it a very great Advantage and Excellency of our Church, that her publick Wor&s;hip is always the &s;ame, and equally excellent, even the be&s;t in the World, how&s;oever indifferent the Capacity or Abilities of the Mini&s;ter may be, con&s;idered as a Preacher. In order therefore that we may highly prize it, and make a &s;erious and con&s;cientious U&s;e of it, and think our&s;elves very happy in it; I proceed, from the Words I have read, to explain and point out to you, the real Worth and Excellency of it; and in Conformity to it, call upon you all, as I truly may, in the Words of the holy P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>O! Wor&s;hip the Lord in the Beauty of Holine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>KING <HI>David</HI> was one of the greate&s;t Patterns of true Devotion that ever lived, as well as one of the be&s;t Com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ers of Publick Forms for the right Exerci&s;e of it: And it is to be remarked, that his admirable Compo&s;itions have &s;tood the Te&s;t of Time, and been con&s;tantly u&s;ed both by the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian Church, as forms of publick Wor|&s;hip, for at lea&s;t 2750 Years, which abundantly &s;peaks the Excellency of them. We indeed can u&s;e only a Tran&s;lation of them, and that we u&s;e, may (chiefly through Length of Time and Alteration in our Language,) need a few Emen|dations; and tho&s;e that know the Original, are very &s;en|&s;ible that no Tran&s;lation can come up to the noble Simplicity and Grandeur of the original Language: However the Tran&s;lation we have, generally carrieth in it &s;uch an inimi|table Maje&s;ty, and intelligible Simplicity, that no modern Compo&s;itions can be compared with it. I &s;ay this holy King was one of the greate&s;t Patterns of Devotion that ever lived.</P>
<P>FOR though the Materials for Devotion, then, were much &s;hort of what they are now, under the more clear Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation&punc; yet he &s;eems to have had &s;uch a Spirit of Devotion, as put him into a Kind of Rapture at the Thoughts of it. <HI>I was glad,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>when they &s;aid, come let us go up to the Hou&s;e of the Lord,</HI> &amp;c.

<P N="1">1.

And what can better tend to this Purpo&s;e, than the excellent <HI>Exhortation</HI> which the Mini&s;ter thereupon makes, to put us upon the Exerci&s;e of &s;uch a Repentance, by <HI>confe&s;&s;ing and for&s;aking our Sins that we may obtain Mercy?</HI> And what can more effectually tend to make us abhor our Sins and reform our Lives, than to begin our Wor&s;hip with &s;uch a &s;erious &s;olemn Act of <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of Sin, and im|ploring God's Mercy and Pardon in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as is expre&s;&s;ed in that exce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nt comprehen&s;ive Form, which our holy Mother the Church hath put into our Mouths; upon which the Mini&s;ter is directed to declare God's Pardon to every true Penitent.

<P N="2">II.

<P N="1">1.

all, in every Thing, learn to <HI>do</HI> and <HI>&s;ubmit to his holy Will,</HI> as the Saints and Angels do <HI>in Heaven,</HI> that we may be forever holy and happy with them. We next te&s;tify our entire Dependence upon God, by praying for our <HI>daily Bread, i. e.</HI> for our Pre&s;ervation, and what&s;oever is needful for our comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tence; which Sen&s;e of our Dependence is a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat Principle of true Holine&s;s. We next pray for the <HI>Forgivene&s;s</HI> of all our Sins, wherein&s;oever we have been unholy in Heart or Life; and that we may be qualified for God's Pardon, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that we have truly re|pented of them; and we are here taught to te&s;tify our hearty <HI>Forgivene&s;s of others,</HI> without which we dare not look for Forgivene&s;s from Him; which is another great Article of <HI>that Holine&s;s,</HI> in Imitation <HI>of him, without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> We then pray that he would <HI>keep us</HI> from all <HI>Temptation,</HI> to every kind of Sin or Unholine&s;s; and that he would &s;ave and <HI>deliver us from all Evil;</HI> both the Evil of Sin, and the Evil of Puni&s;hment; both from the Power and Guilt of Sin here, and the Wrath and Di&s;plea|&s;ure of God hereafter, that we may be &s;ecure of his ever|la&s;ting Favour. And la&s;tly, in Dependence upon Him, and Acknowledgment to Him for all that we a&s;k of Him, we a&s;cribe unto Him, <HI>the Kingdom, Power, and Glory, for ever and ever.</HI> To which, as to all our Prayers, according to the Scripture Pattern we add a joint vocal <HI>Amen.</HI> Than all which, nothing can more abundantly tend to promote univer&s;al Piety and Holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. HAVING made this Entrance on the publick Wor&s;hip of God, we proceed to the Celebration of his <HI>Prai&s;es</HI> in the P&s;alms of holy <HI>David,</HI> and other devout Hymns, taken out of the New Te&s;tament, and that admirable Chri&s;tian Hymn called <HI>Te Deum,</HI> between the Le&s;&s;ons; all which breathe nothing but Holine&s;s, Devotion and Purity. For they do either celebrate the Glories, Perfections, and Ope|rations of God, in his wonderful Works of Creation, Pro|vidence, or Redemption; or expre&s;s our Sen&s;e of our entire Dependence upon Him, and innumerable Obligations to his infinite Goodne&s;s; our Abhorrence of every Thing di&s;|plea&s;ing to Him, or our Re&s;olution to be in all Things obedient to his Will; or explain the Duty and Happine&s;s

of every Virtue, or the Ba&s;ene&s;s, Perver&s;ene&s;s and Mi&s;ery of every Vice; or open the glorious Views both of God's Kingdom of Grace, and his Kingdom of Glory, and teach us the Practice and Experience of all tho&s;e heavenly Graces which are nece&s;&s;ary to qualify us for an Intere&s;t in the Glories, and Felicities thereof. The&s;e, and &s;uch as the&s;e, are the noble Subjects of tho&s;e &s;ublime Odes, all which are in effect, nothing el&s;e but univer&s;al <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord.</HI> So that the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> are a mo&s;t copious Store-Hou&s;e of Devotion, con|&s;i&s;ting of an endle&s;s and mo&s;t beautiful Variety.</P>

This &s;ure, if any Thing may be called impo&s;ing the Inven|tions of Men in the Wor&s;hip of God; for I believe it may be truly &s;aid, (with regard to many of their A&s;&s;emblies at lea&s;t) that there are twenty Times as much Scripture in one of our Services, as in one of theirs.</P>

<P N="3">3. THIS Beauty is further mightily improved by that <HI>grateful Variety</HI> that appears among them, which renders our Liturgy like a beautiful Garden, wherein there is a de|lightful Variety of luxuriant Nature intermixed with curious Art<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of other various Plants with Trees; of Fruits with Flowers of divers Sorts, all ranged in a various and beau|tiful Order. In like Manner, in our Liturgy, Devotions are gratefully intermixed with Le&s;&s;ons, and Prayers with Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;es. The People's Part is generally intermixed with the Mini&s;ter's, and &s;hort Re&s;pon&s;es, in the Form of Eja|culations, with &s;et and continued Prayers, in which there is an agreeable Variety, and the Prayers are each of them &s;hort, in Imitation of our Lord's Prayer; and there is a corre&s;pondent Variety of Actions of the Body, &s;uited to this Variety of the Exerci&s;es of the Mind; all wi&s;ely con|trived to keep the Congregations wakeful, lively and atten|tive. This Method is therefore va&s;tly preferable to one te|dious, long-continued Prayer, without any Variety, as is the Ca&s;e with our Neighbours, in which the People's At|tention flags, and they grow dull and heavy, and the Force of their Devotion is extremely weakened. On which Ac+count nothing &s;hould tempt me to exchange our beautiful Variety of &s;hort Devotions, for their long, dull, and un+va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied Performances: For &s;uch is our Frailty at be&s;t, that we need all the wi&s;e Precautions imaginable to be u&s;ed to
<PB N="22" REF="008892_0023_10309320DD613D80">
keep our Minds vigorous, wakeful and attentive, both by a Variety of Devotions and of bodily Wor&s;hip, which is the true Intent of all that beautiful Variety wherewith our Wor&s;hip is attended; and which, in Proportion as it at|tains tho&s;e Ends, it may be truly &s;tiled, <HI>the Beauty of Ho|line&s;s.</HI> But,</P>
<P N="4">4. Tho' there is &s;uch a grateful Variety in our Method of Wor&s;hip, there is neverthele&s;s a mo&s;t <HI>beautiful Unifor|mity</HI> therein pre&s;cribed, which if acted up to, would va&s;tly add to the Beauty and Excellency of it: Particularly in the uniform Appearance and <HI>Ge&s;ture of the Body</HI> in the whole A&s;&s;embly, pre&s;cribed to each Part of Wor&s;hip. This is made light of by many as a trivial Matter, but herein they are certainly much in the wrong. St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s rea&s;oning is very forcible to &s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity of bodily Wor&s;hip, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 20. where he tells us <HI>we are bought with a Price,</HI> meaning our Bodies as well as our Souls, and that with no le&s;s a Price than the Blood of the Son of God, and there|fore it is mo&s;t fit and rea&s;onable that we &s;hould <HI>glorify God with our Bodies as well as our Spirits,</HI> which are equally his; and of great U&s;e is bodily Adoration: The Eye is apt to affect the Heart, and the Liveline&s;s and Activity of our Bodies naturally awakens and enlivens our Minds. Hence the Church ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wi&s;ely thought fit to direct and pre&s;cribe the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ons and Po&s;tures of our Bodies as well as the Devo|tions of our Minds, that as St. <HI>Paul</HI> directs, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiv. 40, 26, <HI>all Things may be done decently and in Order. and for the U&s;e of edifying.</HI> Now the Po&s;tures of the Body I &s;hall here mention are &s;itting, &s;tanding and kneeling: Of the&s;e <HI>&s;itting</HI> is the farthe&s;t from betokening any thing like Reverence or Devotion. For which Rea&s;on it is very &s;trange that any Chri&s;tians &s;hould u&s;e that Po&s;ture either in Prayers or Sacraments, &s;ince according to the common Acceptation of Mankind, nothing is under&s;tood to be more di&s;re&s;pectful and irreverent, and therefore indecent and ab|&s;urd. It is indeed not improperly indulged while we are in a Condition of Hearers and Learners, as in the Time of Sermon, but utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Condition of Wor|&s;hippers, in which Ca&s;e <HI>&s;tanding</HI> or <HI>kneeling</HI> was always u&s;ed by the Church of God; and with good Rea&s;on; becau&s;e
<PB N="23" REF="008892_0024_10309325090E0610">
the Po&s;ture or Action of the Body was ever con&s;idered as a Kind of Language expre&s;&s;ive of the inward Sen&s;e of the Mind, and as &s;uch it is u&s;ed in holy Scripture; where you ob&s;erve that <HI>kneeling</HI> is always the Po&s;ture of <HI>Prayer,</HI> and <HI>&s;tanding</HI> the Po&s;ture of <HI>Prai&s;e;</HI> which we ought accordingly to ob&s;erve, if we would expre&s;s a due Regard to that glo|rious Almighty Being whom we adore. For this Rea&s;on our Church, according to Scripture, pre&s;cribes that we kneel at our Prayers and &s;tand at our Prai&s;es. Since there|fore, Beauty implies <HI>Uniformity in the Mid&s;t of Variety,</HI> the <HI>Beauty of Holine&s;s</HI> in the Wor&s;hip of God, mu&s;t manife&s;tly imply that according to the Rules of the Church we &s;hould all act alike in one uniform Manner. If then, there be not that Beauty of Uniformity in our Wor&s;hip that were to be wi&s;hed, it is not becau&s;e the Church doth not pre&s;cribe it, but becau&s;e we do not act up to her Pre&s;criptions. What can be more beautiful than a well-diciplined Army, where all look one Way, all ob&s;erve the &s;ame Motions, all act alike with the utmo&s;t Exactne&s;s, according to the Word of Command. Now what is a Beauty there, would be equally &s;o in the public Wor&s;hip, where, as well as in an Army, all &s;hould be Life and Activity, Uniformity and Exactne&s;s, <HI>Decency and Order,</HI> as if one Soul animated every Body. This would be indeed to <HI>wor&s;hip God in the Beauty of Ho|line&s;s.</HI> Moreover,</P>
<P N="5">5. As our Wor&s;hip would be entirely beautiful if the Rules of it were ob&s;erved as to the Uniformity of Ge&s;ture; &s;o I mu&s;t think it another great Article in its Beauty, that the <HI>People hear a uniform vocal Part</HI> in it, in&s;omuch that we do lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erally, <HI>with one Mouth</HI> and Voice, as well as <HI>one Mind</HI> and Heart <HI>glorify God</HI> our heavenly Father. For as there cannot be imagined a more beautiful Sight than for a large Number of Wor&s;hippers to join together in Wor&s;hip with one Heart and Voice, like Children in doing Honour to a common Parent; &s;o it looks like a Kind of holy Strife, in our Method of joint vocal Wor&s;hip, who &s;hall do the greate&s;t Honour to our common heavenly Parent, while, <HI>keeping the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</HI> we do, as it were, call upon one another, (the Mini&s;ter and the People interchangably) and <HI>admoni&s;h one another</HI> in the &s;hort

Re&s;pon&s;es, and in the <HI>P&s;alms and Hymns and &s;piritual Songs,</HI> all with Life and Spirit chaunting forth the high Prai&s;es of God. I am &s;en&s;ible, to tho&s;e who have been bred up in a contrary Way, this Method may &s;eem at fir&s;t to look like Confu&s;ion; but let me a&s;&s;ure tho&s;e to whom it may &s;o &s;eem, that if they would only have each his Book, and &s;ee every Thing with his own Eyes, and come a little while into the Cu&s;tom, this Objection would not only entirely vani&s;h, but &s;oon turn into the Appearance of a very &s;en&s;ible Beauty, and be found to be a &s;olid Advantage. For not only the Eye, as I ob&s;erved before, but al&s;o the Ear would affect the Heart, and it would not only animate a Spirit of Devotion towards God, but a Spirit of Charity towards one another, to find our&s;elves &s;urrounded with our Chri&s;tian Neighbours and Brethren, all joining together, and according to the Pattern of the holy Apo&s;tles, (<HI>Acts</HI> iv. 24) <HI>lifting up our Voices with one Accord</HI> in the Prayers and Prai&s;es offered up to Almighty God. My Neighbour's Voice will be &s;o far from interrupting, that it will rather animate my Devotion, and give it the more Life and Spirit. This is what, I a&s;|&s;ure you, I find to be the Ca&s;e; and I believe I may appeal to the Experience of all that have had an Opportunity of coming into a Habit of it. And let me farther a&s;&s;ure you, that now after near forty Years U&s;e of our excellent Me|thod of Wor&s;hip, upon this Account, as well as the other Rea&s;ons above mentioned, it is &s;o far from growing tedious or a Matter of Formality, as &s;ome imagine, that every Op|portunity &s;eems to add fre&s;h Life, and I &s;ee fre&s;h Beauties, and find further Advantages in it from Time to Time. And one Thing that makes it the rather appear &s;o amiable is, that in the U&s;e of it I am off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring up, not the Devotions of this or that A&s;&s;embly only, much le&s;s of this or that par|ticular Per&s;on or Mini&s;ter, but the Prayers and Prai&s;es of the whole Engli&s;h Church and Nation, enjoined by lawful Au|thority, and which every A&s;&s;embly is jointly offering up at the &s;ame Time. And moreover, that, I find I am wor|&s;hipping God according to the antient Scripture Method, wherein it was the Manner for all the People to <HI>lift up their Voice with one Accord,</HI> not only in Singing, but in <HI>&s;aying</HI> their Devotions.

<P N="6">6. And now <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> I might, if there was Room, add a good deal more upon the Beauty of our <HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ic.</HI> As to the Poetry of the Ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms which we u&s;e, I mu&s;t think it none of the lea&s;t of the many Beauties and Excellencies wherein we have va&s;tly the Advantage of our Neighbours, that we u&s;e &s;uch an excellent Ver&s;ion, which excels theirs beyond all Compari&s;on. And in the Harmony of our Mu&s;ic we generally excel, and &s;hould do &s;o much more, if we would more generally take a little Pains to be ver&s;ed in the Tunes and Rules of Singing.
