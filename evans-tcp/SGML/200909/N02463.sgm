<HEAD>REMARKS UPON THE <HI>Earthquake.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Night</HI> that followed the Twenty ninth of <HI>October</HI> [1727.] was a <HI>Night</HI> whereto NEW-ENGLAND had never in the Memory of Man, &s;een the like before. The <HI>Air</HI> never more <HI>Calm,</HI> the <HI>Sky</HI> never more <HI>Fair;</HI> every thing in all imaginable Tran|quillity: But about a quarter of an Hour before Eleven, there was heard in BOSTON, pa&s;&s;ing from one end of the Town to the other, an horrid rumbling like the Noi&s;e of many Coaches together, driving on the paved Stones with the utmo&s;t Rapidity. But it was attended with a mo&s;t awful <HI>Trembling of the Earth,</HI> which did heave and &s;hake &s;o as to Rocque the Hou&s;es, and cau&s;e here and there the falling of &s;ome &s;maller Things, both within Doors and without. It cannot be imagined, but that it gave an un|common Concern unto all the Inhabitants, and even a degree of Con&s;ternation, unto very ma|ny
<PB N="2" REF="002919_0004_0FE6966739570BF0">of them. This <HI>fir&s;t Shock,</HI> which was the mo&s;t Violent, was followed with &s;everal others, and &s;ome Repetition of the Noi&s;e, at &s;undry times, pretty di&s;tant from one another. The Number of them is not entirely agreed; but at lea&s;t Four or Five are allow'd for; The la&s;t of which was be|tween Five and Six of the Clock in the Morning.</P>
<P>How far this <HI>Earthquake</HI> extended thro' the Countrey, we are not yet informed; but that it extended Scores of Miles, we have already a certain Information. And what added unto the Terrors of it, were the terrible Flames and Lights, in the Atmo&s;phere, which accompani|ed it. The Ve&s;&s;els on the Coa&s;t, were al&s;o made &s;en&s;ible of it, by a &s;hivering that &s;iezed on them.</P>
<P>When the greatly affected People, had a little Opportunity to look about them in the Morn|ing, the Pa&s;tors of the <HI>Old North Church,</HI> directed the <HI>Bells</HI> to be rung, that &s;uch of the People as could and would, might a&s;&s;emble immediately unto &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable Exerci&s;es of Religion. The Pa&s;tors of the <HI>New</HI> joined with them in &s;ending up unto Heaven, the Supplications which the &s;olemn Occa&s;ion called for. And the Pa&s;tors in the other part of the Town, made a &s;peedy and hearty Appearance, and mo&s;t affec|tionately united in a Concurrence with them. The A&s;&s;embly that came together, did more than croud and fill the mo&s;t capacious of our Meetinghou&s;es; And as there was a multitude of &s;erious Chri&s;tians, who are acquainted with
<PB N="3" REF="002919_0005_0FE696675946C788"><HI>Real</HI> and <HI>Vital</HI> PIETY, &s;o the whole Auditory expre&s;&s;ed a Devotion which was truly Extraor|dinary.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Exerci&s;es were fini&s;hed about Two in the Afternoon, after &s;ome &s;hort Inter|rai&s;&s;ion of an Hour or Two, &s;everal Churches in the other part of the Town, followed the Exemple, and with va&s;t Congregations, conti|nued the proper Exerci&s;es of Religion, until a|bout Eight a Clock in the Evening. For the Animation thereof, there was not only the joint Inclination of the <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and the <HI>People,</HI> but likewi&s;e a Recommendation from His Honour the L. GOVERNOUR; Who&s;e <HI>Piety,</HI> ever di&s;covered on every other, as well as this, Oc|ca&s;ion, di&s;po&s;ed him, to Direct al&s;o the keeping of the <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> following (which is the Day of the u&s;ual weekly Lecture,) as a Day of SUP|PLICATIONS in all the Churches of the City.</P>
<P>In the Year 1580. <HI>England</HI> felt an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> which tho' no con&s;iderable Damage was done by it, awakened the Government of the Nation, to call upon all the Subjects throughout the Kingdom, to be fervent and in&s;tant in Prayer, that the Wrath of GOD whereof the <HI>Earthquake</HI> was a <HI>Token,</HI> might be averted from the Land. Such a Di&s;po&s;ition po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es our <HI>Commander in Chief,</HI> and his People mo&s;t readily come into it.</P>
<P>One of the MINISTERS, who did their part, in the Great A&s;&s;embly of the Morning judg'd it Expedient, yea, Nece&s;&s;ary, that PRAYER
<PB N="4" REF="002919_0006_0FE6967149A89090">&s;hould have the WORD accompanying of it. He thought, that if ever he did <HI>preach the Word IN SEASON,</HI> he &s;hould now do &s;o, by taking the Pre&s;ent SEASON to render the <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious GOD, in the EARTHQUAKE, while it was yet &s;carce over, Articulate and In|telligible unto the Hearers: 'Twould be Em|phatically, A WORD IN SEASON. And he hop'd, that <HI>Hearts made &s;oft</HI> by the ALMIGH|TY <HI>Troubling</HI> of them with the Occurrences of the Night before, would be more likely than ever, to receive Good Impre&s;&s;ions, and be moulded into durable Re&s;olutions of Godline&s;s; Yea, that as the primitive <HI>Outpouring</HI> of the Ho|ly SPIRIT, was attended with an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> &s;o the EARTHQUAKE would now be attend|ed with &s;uch on <HI>Out-pouring</HI> of the Holy SPI|RIT as would make an Holy, and &s;o an Happy People. Accordingly, with the Divine A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, he made a SPEECH, [or, if you plea&s;e, A SERMON,] which was no &s;ooner offered in the A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Zion</HI> there convened. but it was de&s;ired, that it might be further offered in the way of the Pre&s;s, for the Service of PIETY, not only here, but in other parts of the Land, which <HI>GOD makes to Tremble.</HI> He dur&s;t not re|ject the De&s;ire. Tis true, There can be expect|ed none but a mean Preparation, from a few Minutes of a Morning filled with Di&s;turbances; which may be an Apology for the Deficiencies which a curious Reader may &s;oon di&s;cover in it.
<PB N="5" REF="002919_0007_0FE696716324CBB0">But our Gracious GOD is plea&s;ed &s;ometimes to make u&s;e of <HI>&s;uch,</HI> to do Good in the World; that &s;o, <HI>Man</HI> may be Nothing, and HE may be <HI>All in All.</HI> Tis not po&s;&s;ible for him to give Word for Word, a Di&s;cour&s;e which he could have no Time to Write, before it was delivered. But it is here without many material <HI>Additions,</HI> &amp; per|haps, with &s;ome Forgetful <HI>Sub&s;tractions,</HI> Exhibited as very near as can well be asked for, to what was delivered.</P>
<P>O! May the Holy SPIRIT of our GOD, make it come with <HI>Efficacy!</HI></P>
<P>We find, the <HI>Hill</HI> on the North &s;ide whereof <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was buried, had [Jo&s;h.

<HEAD>A SPEECH, Made by One of the Mini&s;ters, to the Inhabitants of BOSTON; A&s;&s;embled the Morning after the EARTH|QUAKE. <HI>Octo.</HI> 30. 1727.</HEAD>
<P>THE Glorious GOD has <HI>Roared out of Zion.</HI> We have the la&s;t Night heard the terrible <HI>Roaring;</HI> with general and uncommon Terror, heard the awful Repetition of it. Who is here of you, among them who felt the <HI>Earth trembling</HI> under them, that &s;aid not upon it, <HI>When I heard, my Lips quivered at the Voice, and I trembled in my &s;elf, that I might find Re&s;t in the Day of Trouble!</HI> Who is there that &s;aid not, <HI>Lord, my Fle&s;h trem|bles for fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy Judg|ments!</HI> The <HI>Lion hath roared; Who will not fear?</HI> We are wor&s;e than <HI>Bea&s;ts,</HI> if we <HI>tremble</HI> not.</P>
<P>Never did the City of BOSTON, in the Ninety &s;even Years that have rolled over it, &s;ee
<PB N="7" REF="002919_0009_0FE696798DC160A8">&s;uch a <HI>Night,</HI> as what we &s;aw a few Hours ago. A MIDNIGHT CRY was heard; The Con|&s;ternation whereof is not this Morning over with us; An <HI>Augui&s;h</HI> like that on a <HI>Travailing Woman,</HI> &s;iezed upon <HI>Men</HI> as well as <HI>Women.</HI> What <HI>Fear,</HI> from the Apprehen&s;ion of going to the <HI>Pil,</HI> by a &s;troke like a <HI>&s;uare</HI> upon us!</P>
<P>We have had the repeted, more than three times repeted <HI>Shocks,</HI> of a Formidable EARTH|QUAKE. And GOD knows, whether there are any more to come, or what Execution they may do, when they come.</P>
<P>When the never-to-be-forgotten <HI>Sicilian</HI> EARTHQUAKE in our Days, had given &s;ome <HI>Shocks</HI> which only terrified the People, after an Intermi&s;&s;ion of Two Days, there came on tho&s;e, which horribly de&s;troy'd them; A <HI>Bo&s;om of De|&s;truction</HI> that &s;wept away near one hundred and fifty Thou&s;and of them.</P>
<P>The Ancient Cry of the <HI>Prophets,</HI> is now mo&s;t certainly the Cry of our <HI>Earthquakes;</HI> Ho&s;. X. 12. <HI>It is Time to &s;eek the Lord.</HI> The poor Popi&s;h <HI>Idolaters,</HI> in their <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> make their Proce&s;|&s;ions &amp; their Addre&s;&s;es to, <HI>Lying Vanities,</HI> &amp; &s;illy gods that <HI>cannot &s;ave</HI> them; <HI>They cry, but there is none to &s;ave them!</HI> We will <HI>walk in the Name of</HI> JEHOVA-JESUS, <HI>who is our</HI> only GOD, as tho&s;e unhappy Creatures <HI>walk in the Name</HI> of Theirs. <HI>Their Rock is not as our Rock;</HI> We have a SAVIOUR, in whom we find a &s;ufficient <HI>Re|fuge,</HI> for us, and a <HI>very pre&s;ent Help in Trouble,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002919_0010_0FE69672EB875368">when the <HI>Earth is moved</HI> under us, and the <HI>Moun|tains are &s;haking</HI> about us. We will invert the Order of the <HI>Eighteenth P&s;alm;</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t &s;aid, <HI>In my Di&s;tre&s;s I called on the Lord, and cried unto my GOD, Then the Earth &s;hook and trembled.</HI> We will &s;ay, <HI>Since the Earth &s;hakes and trembles; Now in our Di&s;tre&s;s we will call on the Lord, and cry unto our GOD.</HI> It is with plea&s;ure that I read in <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> a Letter of <HI>Antoninus,</HI> who was a &s;tran|ger to the True GOD, but yet complains, That the <HI>Pagan</HI> urged him to per&s;ecute the <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> <Q>Whereas (he &s;ays) I under&s;tand, that they are a good People, and whenever there happens an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> their Cour&s;e is to go and pray unto their GOD, that His Wrath may be turned away from us; And in this they &s;how more of Religion than the People that urge me to de&s;troy them!</Q> We are this Day doing what the <HI>Primitive Chri&s;tians</HI> did, and what all <HI>Genuine Chri&s;tians</HI> will.</P>
<P>We have Two <HI>Occa&s;ions,</HI> to repair unto our gracious GOD; we have Two <HI>Petitions</HI> to carry unto Him. The one is, That we may have the Grace to <HI>know,</HI> and to <HI>do,</HI> the <HI>Duties,</HI> which the <HI>Earthquake</HI> does in its hideous Rumbles mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible call us to. The other is; That there may be no &s;uch <HI>Returns</HI> of the <HI>Earthquake</HI> as to lay us in De&s;olations, and make our <HI>Plagues wonderful.</HI> But, the <HI>&s;ucce&s;s</HI> of our Supplications, will very much turn upon our Attention to the Voice of our glorious GOD in the <HI>Earthquake</HI> which is
<PB N="9" REF="002919_0011_0FE696A1DAECDE38">now affrighting of us. Don't we remember tho&s;e Divine <HI>Retaliations; As He cried, and they would not hear, &s;o they cried and I would not hear, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> And again, <HI>Becau&s;e I called, and ye refu&s;ed, I will laugh at your Calamity, and I will mock when your Fear cometh; when your Fear cometh as De&s;olatioa, and your De&s;truction corn|eth as a Whirlwind; when Di&s;tre&s;s and Angui&s;h cometh upon you?</HI> Yea, I may &s;ay unto you, The <HI>Di&s;po&s;itions</HI> of PIETY, will be &s;o many <HI>Supplica|tions;</HI> and indeed, the be&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Supplications,</HI> the mo&s;t proper and the mo&s;t potent <HI>Supplicati|ons;</HI> There are <HI>pure Hands lifted up</HI> in our <HI>Suppli|cations</HI> when we <HI>Do</HI> what our GOD has oblig'd us to.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as a Praeliminary, and as a Foun|dation to the Di&s;cour&s;e, wherewith I propo&s;e to treat you, the TEXT which I now pitch upon is That;</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Mic. VI. 9.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Voice of the LORD, crieth unto the City.</P></Q>
<P>CErtainly, you will not expect, that I &s;hould &s;pend any time in proving, That there is a VOICE of the glorious GOD, in all that He <HI>does,</HI> in the World. All the <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Creation,</HI> and all the <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Providence,</HI> there is a <HI>Voice</HI> of the glorious GOD in them. He <HI>&s;peaks</HI> in all
<PB N="10" REF="002919_0012_0FE69679A72B7F10">that He <HI>does.</HI> And there is no place, where their <HI>Voice</HI> may not be <HI>beard.</HI> O <HI>Deaf</HI> we, if we hear it not! &mdash; That <HI>Voice, &mdash; O Love,</HI> O <HI>Ad|mire, O Adore, the glorious One, who does all the&s;e things. O Fear this GOD, and give Glory unto Him!</HI></P>
<P>'Tis very &s;ure; In the <HI>Works</HI> wherein the glorious GOD goes out of the <HI>Ordinary Road,</HI> or, His <HI>Extraordinary Di&s;pen&s;ations;</HI> In the&s;e, His <HI>Voice</HI> becomes very Notable; and mo&s;t inexcu|&s;able are they who <HI>Regard not the Works of the Lord, nor the Operation of His Hands: He &s;hall de|&s;troy them, and not build them up.</HI></P>
<P>EARTHQUAKES are &s;uch <HI>Works.</HI> We read, P&s;al. XXIX. 8. <HI>The Voice of the Lord &s;hakes the Wilderne&s;s.</HI> There is the <HI>Voice of the Lord,</HI> in it, when He <HI>&s;hakes</HI> our Territories. &mdash; There may be &s;ome <HI>Earthquakes</HI> more <HI>Supernatural</HI> than others: We reckon that of Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> One; And &s;o we reckon that at the <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> of our Ble&s;&s;ed JE|SUS; and yet more con&s;picuou&s;ly that of His <HI>Crucifixion.</HI> The <HI>&s;plit Rocks</HI> at this Day ob&s;erved by Travellers who are <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> and &s;omewhat Nice in their Credulity, are thought by &s;ome no Injudicious Men, to be the la&s;ting Monu|ments and Memorials of it. But u&s;ually, our <HI>Earthquakes</HI> have <HI>Natural Cau&s;es</HI> a&s;&s;igned for them. What they are, 'tis now and here, nei|ther a Time nor Place for Philo&s;ophical Di&s;qui|&s;itions. Whether <HI>Colluctations</HI> of <HI>Minerals</HI> pro|ducing Vapours that mu&s;t have an Explo&s;ion,
<PB N="11" REF="002919_0013_0FE696A1F6E738B8">may cau&s;e tho&s;e direful Convul&s;ions in the Bow|els of the Earth, which are &s;elt in our <HI>Earth|quakes?</HI> &mdash; Or, whether the huge quantities of <HI>Waters,</HI> running in the Bowels of the Earth, may not by Degrees wa&s;h away the Bottom of the upper <HI>Strate</HI> here and there, &s;o as to cau&s;e their falling in? &mdash;Or, whether the <HI>Subterraneous Fires,</HI> getting head, may not by their Sulphureous and Bituminous Exhalations in the Bowels of the Earth, cau&s;e a Combu&s;tion that may carry all before it? &mdash; Or, whether &mdash; But it mu&s;t be &s;omething more <HI>Theological,</HI> that you are now to be treated with. Let the <HI>Natural Cau&s;es</HI> of <HI>Earth|quakes</HI> be what the <HI>Wi&s;e Men of Euquiry</HI> plea&s;e, <HI>They</HI> and their <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> are &s;till under the Govern|ment of HIM that is the <HI>GOD of Nature.</HI> Shall we &s;ay, All this is but a <HI>Chance that happens to us,</HI> or the meer unguided <HI>Motion</HI> of <HI>Matter?</HI> Ah, profane <HI>Phili&s;tine!</HI> &mdash; 'Tis a Language for none but a <HI>Phili&s;tine.</HI> A <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> cannot &s;peak &s;o; No, He is one that will be &s;en&s;ible of GOD in the&s;e things. Verily, In them, <HI>Lo, GOD &s;ends forth His Voice, and that a mighty Voice</HI> unto us.</P>
<P>You will yet le&s;s expect, that I &s;hould be at any pains, for proving, That this VOICE of the glorious GOD, is to be hearken'd to. When the <HI>great GOD who formed all things,</HI> will plea&s;e to <HI>utter His Voice,</HI> What? Shall it not by all that have the Faculties of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> in them rendring them capable of hearkening to it, be hearken'd to? O mo&s;t <HI>unrea&s;onable!</HI> GOD our Maker
<PB N="12" REF="002919_0014_0FE6967BF9873410">&s;ays, <HI>Unto you, O Men, I call, and my Voice is unto the Sons of Men.</HI> We are <HI>Bruits</HI> rather than <HI>Men,</HI> and <HI>Colts of the wild A&s;s,</HI> yea, <HI>Children of the wick|ed One,</HI> rather than the <HI>Sons of Men,</HI> if we do not hearken to the <HI>Voice</HI> of his Eternal <HI>Wi&s;dom.</HI> He will not own us, for the <HI>People of His Pa&s;ture, and the Sheep of His Hand,</HI> if we do not even <HI>To Day bear His Voice.</HI> An hardy <HI>Pharaoh</HI> may &s;ay, Exod. V. 2. <HI>Who is the Lord, that I &s;hould Obey His Voice!</HI> Words to come from the Mouth of none but a <HI>Pharaob,</HI> and a <HI>Devil!</HI> But, Ah, <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> ah! Mon&s;ter, The Almighty GOD, whom thou &s;o in&s;ulte&s;t, and who&s;e <HI>Voice</HI> thou &s;o defie&s;t, what will the affronted JEHOVAH do unto thee! <HI>What will He do unto thee!</HI></P>
<P>Indeed there is this Argument for hearkening to the <HI>Voice</HI> of our GOD, that if we do it not, we provoke Him to <HI>Render His Rebukes in Flames of Fire</HI> unto us; We provoke Him, to inflict <HI>great Plagues and of long continuance</HI> upon us. If we do not hearken to His <HI>Voice,</HI> e&s;pecially in His <HI>Ca&s;ti|gatory Dealings</HI> with us, &mdash; He &s;ays, <HI>If ye will not hearken unto me, I will puni&s;h you yet &s;even times more for your Sins.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore, Be now at length effectually <HI>Alarmed,</HI> O Inhabitants of BOSTON, yea, and of the whole Countrey whereof this is the <HI>Me|tropolis.</HI> What a <HI>Trial,</HI> Yea, what a Gradu|ally de&s;cending <HI>Trial,</HI> is our glorious GOD making of us, whether we will <HI>hearken to His Voice</HI> or no? A few Months ago, how fearfully did

And how frequently did loud <HI>Thunder-Claps</HI> rou&s;e us out of our Le|thargies! How frequently did hot <HI>Thunderbolts</HI> fall where many Objects felt the Force of an <HI>Arm</HI> which, <HI>What can &s;tand before?</HI> But, alas, Did we <HI>bear Attentively,</HI> and Obediently, the <HI>Noi&s;e of Hu Voice,</HI> or, Mind as we &s;hould have done, the <HI>Sound that went out of His Mouth?</HI> Af|ter this, The <HI>Stormy Wind which fulfils His Word,</HI> came ru&s;hing down upon us.

<P>About, <HI>Jun.</HI> 2. 1638. there was an <HI>Earth|quake</HI> that &s;hook the Hou&s;es, and &s;hook down the Things that &s;tood upon Shelves in them; and People that were abroad, could not &s;tand, but laid hold upon what was next them, to pre|&s;erve them from falling down. A &s;econd <HI>Shock</HI> &s;ucceeded, but not equal to the former. The <HI>Sea al&s;o was troubled;</HI> and the Ve&s;&s;els there felt the Shock, with &s;urprize and con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>GOD was at the &s;ame time, <HI>&s;haking</HI> the Churches in the Country, with a Shock that would have torn them to pieces: if <HI>GOD in the mid&s;t</HI> of them, had not prevented their be|ing <HI>moved:</HI> Their GOD and SAVIOUR <HI>helped</HI> them, in that <HI>Morning</HI> of the Colony.</P>
<P>On <HI>Octob.</HI> 29 1653. there was an <HI>Earthquake;</HI> on which the Aged Hand of the famous Mr. <HI>Peter Bulkly,</HI> the never-to-be-forgotten Pa&s;tor and Glory of <HI>Concord,</HI> could not forbear taking a Pen, and Writing this Epigram.

<P>In the Year, 1658. <HI>New-England</HI> felt another con&s;iderable <HI>Earthquake.</HI> Nothing memorable is left upon Record concerning it. It had Con|comitants that were <HI>too Memorable.</HI></P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>January,</HI> between 1662 and 1663, there was an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> whereof we find this Account given by that worthy Man, Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth</HI> of <HI>Roxbury;</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>Jan.</HI> 26. &amp; <HI>28.</HI> The Foundations of the Earth trembled, and &s;ome our Hou&s;es rocqu'd like a Cradle. Six or &s;even times did the <HI>Earth &s;hake</HI> under us, in the &s;pace of Two or Three Days. It was then tho't &amp; &s;aid, That the&s;e <HI>Earth|quakes</HI> might portend the &s;haking the Founda|tions of our Churches, and of our Civil State.</Q></P>
<P>In the Year 1705. there was a &s;mall <HI>Earth|quake</HI> felt by the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et</HI>-Province on <HI>Jun.</HI> 16. And in <HI>Connecticut</HI>-Colony, <HI>Jun.</HI> 22. On which occa&s;ion Dr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather,</HI> preached and printed, <HI>A Di&s;cour&s;e concerning Earthquakes.</HI> In that Sermon, there are the&s;e among other Pa&s;&s;ages:</P>
<P><Q>The Lord &s;eldom Vi&s;its any Town or Coun|try with de&s;olating Judgments, but He fir&s;t gives them Warning of it, by one means or another; and many times by <HI>Earthquakes.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="002919_0044_0FE6969E30A431B8">A Roman Hi&s;torian ob&s;erves, that the City of <HI>Rome</HI> never felt any <HI>Earthquake,</HI> but &s;ome ter|rible Judgment &s;oon followed. In the Scrip|ture, it is &s;aid, <HI>There &s;hall be Earthquakes in diver&s;e Places;</HI> The Next Words are; <HI>And FAMINES &amp; PESTILENCES. Earth|quakes</HI> are &s;ometimes <HI>prodromous</HI> of tho&s;e other Judgments. &mdash; But, &mdash;We have at this Day Rea&s;on to expect that a Notable COMING of the LORD is near at hand. Yea, we may &s;ay, <HI>The Great-DAY of THE LORD, is Near, it is Near, and it Ha&s;teth greatly.</HI></Q></P>
<P>There have been more than One or Two le&s;|&s;er <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> be&s;ides the&s;e, at &s;everal Times in the Country. But never any that on all Ac|counts has equalled THAT which is now Alarming of us.</P>
<P>We will at pre&s;ent conclude, with a few Lines extracted from a little Treati&s;e entituled, <HI>Geologia Norvegica:</HI> written by a Dani&s;h Mi|ni&s;ter, who&s;e Name was <HI>Michael Peter&s;on E&s;|cholt,</HI> on the Occa&s;ion of (what he calls) <HI>That very great &amp; &s;pacious Earthquake, almo&s;t quite thro' the South Parts</HI> of <HI>Norway, Apr.</HI> 24. 1657.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, <Q>It carryed &s;uch a Noi&s;e &amp; Sound with it, that the People at fir&s;t knew not but it was the Noi&s;e of Thunder, until they per|ceived the Hou&s;es &s;hook, and all their Move|ables totter. &mdash; Yet it hath not done any Re|markable Harm; for which we ought to be very Thankful unto GOD.&mdash; Neverthele&s;s,
<PB N="6" REF="002919_0045_0FE696CDB76C7DE8">in regard that this <HI>Earthquake</HI> was of &s;uch a Length and Breadth, namely an hundred and &s;ixty Miles, we need not doubt but that it may &s;ignify &s;ome Remarkable Change and Alteration. The ancient Hi&s;toriographer <HI>He|rodotus,</HI> has recorded it; That when any Re|markable Change or Calamity approaches, it is commonly &s;ignified by &s;uch preceding Tokens! &mdash;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&mdash;When GOD Almighty, now in the&s;e la&s;t Times of the World, &s;hall permit &s;uch <HI>Great &amp; Spacious Earthquakes,</HI> for &s;o many many Miles in length to happen, Men ought not carele&s;ly to &s;light them, and think no more of them: No, But regard &amp; receive them, as partly &s;ignifying &s;ome unu&s;ual Accident Im|pending or Approaching; and partly as in|fallible <HI>Forerunners</HI> of the DAY, which the <HI>earne&s;t Expectation of the Creature waiteth for, yea, Groaneth and even Travaileth in Pain.</HI></Q></P>
