<OPENER><SALUTE>Candid Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Rea&s;on of my chu&s;ing the <HI>Subject</HI> of the following Sermon, in the Cour&s;e of my &s;tated Mini&s;trations to my own Congregation, was the &s;orrowful Apprehen&s;ion I had of the low State of <HI>vital Religion,</HI> in general among us, at this Time; and a &s;incere De&s;ire to excite truly pious Per&s;ons, to more Earne&s;tne&s;s and Diligence in the Service of God: I had not the lea&s;t Thought of its Publication when it was preached; but being &s;ince Earne&s;tly de|&s;ired to commit it to the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> I have con&s;ented, ho|ping and praying, that it may thro' the divine Ble&s;&s;ing, be of &s;ome U&s;e to Mankind: The Sovereign God &s;ends by whom he will &s;end, he can, and has in many In|&s;tances, ble&s;&s;ed weak Means; if we &s;incerely endea|vour as well as we can to promote his Kingdom, he will graciou&s;ly accept of our humble Endeavours, and probably ble&s;s them to &s;ome; both which Con&s;iderations are great Incentives to Action: To prevent <HI>Prolixi|ty,</HI>

I have not expre&s;&s;ed in the <HI>Sermon,</HI> the Words of many Places of &s;acred Scripture, which confirm and illu&s;trate the Matters treated of: I would there|fore intreat the <HI>Reader,</HI> to turn to them for his own Satisfaction and Benefit; and I earne&s;tly beg his Prayers, for one who is le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints, that I may obtain Mercy, to be faithful to the Death:</P>

be neglected nor de&s;troyed, but excited, and duly regulated in their Tendencies, by Rea&s;on and Revelation, according to the Nature and Impor|tance of their Objects: This is the <HI>Remedy</HI> which the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> propo&s;es in the Words of our Text, to the <HI>lukewarm Church</HI> of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> to cure her <HI>Degeneracy,</HI> and remove the <HI>Calamities</HI> con&s;e|quent upon it; which are &s;uppo&s;ed by the pre|ceeding Part of the Ver&s;e, from which the <HI>Text</HI> is an Inference: <HI>As many as I love, I rebuke and cha&s;ten; be</HI> ZEALOUS <HI>therefore and repent. q. d.</HI> Seeing the Afflictions I &s;end to correct you for, and reclaim you from your Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in Religion, proceed not from Prejudice, but regard to your be&s;t Good, therefore they &s;hould be kindly accep|ted and faithfully improved, by the exerci&s;e of <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Penitence;</HI> without which they will not be removed in Mercy: Certainly, <HI>the Wounds of a Friend, are better than the Ki&s;&s;es of an Enemy;</HI> if therefore you have any gratitude to God, or re|gard to your own Intere&s;t, <HI>Be ZEALOUS! Ardent Love</HI> is termed <HI>ZEAL, (Num.</HI> xi. 29. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> lxix. 9.)

(Matth.</HI> v. 13.)&mdash;<HI>And repent: i. e.</HI> Candidly confe&s;s, and &s;incerely lament your Coldne&s;s and Negligence in Time pa&s;t, and re&s;olve in the Strength of God to do better in Time to come, in Pur&s;uance of which, &s;trive to keep your&s;elves in the Love of God, &s;trive to keep alive in your Souls the &s;acred Fire of divine Grace, that ye may not be dead while ye live, but live in Love, live to God, and feel you live! let your Spikenard ince&s;&s;antly diffu&s;e to all around you, its aromatic, delightful, and u&s;eful Fragrance, and your Hearts glow with unremit|ting&punc; pious, and noble Ardors!</P>
<P>THE Subject of our pre&s;ent Meditations is ZEAL, which is twofold, <HI>viz.</HI> bad and good: Of the former <HI>Genus</HI> or Sort, there are various Kinds or <HI>Species,</HI> particularly</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="008745_0007_102FD854C0083D60">1. THERE is a <HI>natural Zeal</HI> and Activity&punc; un&s;anc|tified, which is the Effect of a &s;prightly <HI>Tempera|ture</HI> of Body; which, tho' it be not po&s;itively Evil, yet has Nothing &s;piritual or &s;aving in it, and &s;o is comparatively Bad.</P>
<P N="2">2. AN <HI>ignorant Zeal,</HI> when Per&s;ons are zealous and they dont know for what or why; and hence it is &s;aid of the carnal <HI>Jews,</HI> that <HI>they had a Zeal for God, but not according to Knowledge, for being ignorant of Gods Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> or of the Nece&s;&s;ity and Sufficiency of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of a Mediator, to the Ju&s;tification of a believing Sinner, which is of Gods Appointment; <HI>and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own</HI> in Place thereof, <HI>they did not</HI> &s;incerely <HI>&s;ubmit to,</HI> or entirely depend upon, <HI>the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of God, (Romans</HI> x. 2, 3.) And <HI>thus</HI> I&s;rael <HI>that followed after the Law of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, hath not attained to the Law of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Where|fore? Becau&s;e they &s;ought it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law, (Romans</HI> ix. 31, 32.) But be&s;ides this <HI>Self-righteous Vein,</HI> ignorant <HI>Zeal</HI> is equally liable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> into the wilds and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">reaks of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m;</HI> when Men leave the Guidance of the holy Scriptures, and follow the blind <HI>Impul&s;es</HI> of their own Minds, which they reckon &s;ufficient without them; contrary to the &s;acred Oracles,
<PB N="9" REF="008745_0008_102FD861DB378780">
(1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 14. <HI>Rev.</HI> iii. 17. <HI>Luke</HI> xi. 13.) Ig|norant Zeal is exceeding Dangerous, like a <HI>Sword</HI> in the Hand of one that is blind, or mad! Wit|ne&s;s the <HI>Boors</HI> Wars in <HI>Germany;</HI> and many other In&s;tances nearer Home.</P>
<P N="3">3. A <HI>hypocritical Zeal,</HI> when Men affect to ap|pear zealous before others, when they are not &s;o in Reality; thus the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> wore broad <HI>Phylac|tery's,</HI> made long <HI>Prayers,</HI> compa&s;&s;ed Sea and Land to make a <HI>Pro&s;elyte,</HI> gave <HI>Alms</HI> in public, built the <HI>Tombs</HI> of the <HI>Prophets,</HI> that they might be &s;een of Men, and e&s;teemed Religious; and yet they <HI>per&s;ecuted</HI> at the &s;ame Time, the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Prophets.</HI> Tho&s;e Hypocrites our Lord acco&s;ts in the following Language, <HI>Ye Serpents, ye Genera|tion of Vipers, how can ye e&s;cape the Damnation of Hell, (Matthew</HI> xxiii. Chapter.)</P>
<P N="4">4. A <HI>proud Zeal,</HI> when Men are <HI>fervent</HI> in any Matter that concerns them, their Opinions, Hu|mors, Honors, Intere&s;ts, Friends, or any Thing that is theirs, and principly becau&s;e it is theirs: And yet &s;uch is the Deceitfulne&s;s of the human Heart, that &s;ome are plea&s;ed with this &s;orry <HI>Mu&s;h|room</HI> Witne&s;s <HI>Jehu,</HI> who had the Confidence to a&s;k good <HI>Jonabab, to come and &s;ee his Zeal.</HI> (2 <HI>Kings</HI> x, 16.)</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="10" REF="008745_0009_102FD8564C347F18">5. A <HI>factious Zeal,</HI> when <HI>Pride</HI> or <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> hath engaged Men in a <HI>Party,</HI> and they think it their Duty, at lea&s;t their Intere&s;t, to contend ear|ne&s;tly for all the Opinions and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Sect</HI> they have cho&s;en, without examining whe|ther they be right or wrong: In the mean Time &s;lighting and rejecting all who are of other Deno|minations, and Sentiments in le&s;&s;er Things; and &s;olicitou&s;ly labouring to pro&s;elyte others, rather to a Party than to vital Piety, that they may <HI>glory in their Fle&s;h,</HI> and an&s;wer &s;ome mean De&s;ign, (<HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 13.) As if it was a great Catch to be damned, rather in this, than in that <HI>Faction;</HI> but ble&s;&s;ed be God, the Church of Chri&s;t is not confined to any Party, (<HI>John</HI> x 16.) Nor does the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of God con&s;i&s;t in <HI>Meats</HI> and <HI>Drinks, but in Peace and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Joy in the holy Gho&s;t, (Rom.</HI> xiv. 17.) The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> expre&s;&s;ed his Abhor|rence of promoting <HI>Schi&s;ms</HI> in the Church of God, by a noble Depre&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf on that Occa&s;ion, <HI>who then is</HI> Paul, <HI>and who is</HI> Apollos? (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 5.) The main Point is to be <HI>holy</HI> in Heart and Life, &s;uch will &s;urely get to Heaven, and there their Differences in Sentiment will be comfortably &s;et|tled.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="11" REF="008745_0010_102FD85885FFD3E0">6. A <HI>&s;uper&s;titious Zeal,</HI> for &s;mall and indifferent Things while greater are neglected, thus the <HI>Pha|ri&s;ees</HI> were fond of their <HI>Wa&s;hings</HI> and <HI>Traditions,</HI> and <HI>paid Tithes</HI> of <HI>Mint, Ani&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Cummin,</HI> while they <HI>omitted the weightier Matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and Faith.</HI> They <HI>&s;trained at a Gnat, and &s;wallowed a Camel, (Matthew</HI> xxiii. 24.)</P>
<P N="7">7. AN <HI>envious Zeal,</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e that have the Precedency and cro&s;s their De&s;ires, contradict their Notions, or cloud their Honor: <HI>But if ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts, glory not, and lie not again&s;t the Truth: This Wi&s;dom de|&s;cendeth not from above, but is earthly &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h. (James</HI> iii. 14, 15.)</P>
<P N="8">8. A <HI>malignant Zeal,</HI> again&s;t the faithful Ser|vants of Chri&s;t, for their Soundne&s;s, Holine&s;s, and U&s;efulne&s;s, and in Proportion thereto: Not|with&s;tanding all the plau&s;ible Pretexts with which it is artfully covered, (<HI>See this &s;hocking</HI> PARADOX <HI>confirmed by divine Te&s;timony: Gen.</HI> iii. 15. <HI>Gal.</HI> iv. 29. <HI>Luke</HI> xii. 51, 52, 53. 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 12. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xvi. 9. <HI>Rev.</HI> xii. 12, 13.)</P>
<P>As &s;inful <HI>ZEAL</HI> is manifold in Kind, &s;o it is exceeding hainous and of malignant Influence; it di&s;honoreth God by pre&s;uming to affix his &s;acred Name to Error in Principle, and Impiety in Prac|tice;
<PB N="12" REF="008745_0011_102FD86369DB2DF0">
it charges upon infinite Purity all the Wic|kedne&s;s it commits; it injures the Church of God, as well as civil Society and our own Souls; this made <HI>Paul</HI> exceeding <HI>mad</HI> again&s;t the Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, &s;o that he &s;hut them up in Pri&s;ons and compelled them to bla&s;pheme! (<HI>Acts</HI> xxvi. 10, 11.) This breeds Contention, and over&s;ets the Peace and Order of Societies and Families: As pious <HI>Zeal</HI> is the Fervency of Grace, &s;o is &s;in|ful <HI>Zeal</HI> the Fervency of Sin, it makes Men dou|bly &s;inful, for hereby they are induced to do much Evil in a little Time, and that in the Name of God, whereby they fight again&s;t him by his own Authority: (Perverted) this blinds Men's Minds, and prejudices their Hearts again&s;t Conviction; the zealous Sinner ju&s;tifies his Sin, and pleads Scrip|ture and Rea&s;on in its Defence: Yea, he thinks he is &s;erving God, when he is <HI>murdering</HI> his Servants, and oppo&s;ing the <HI>Power</HI> and Spirit of Religion, a melancholy Ca&s;e this indeed! Yea, even <HI>Zeal</HI> for &s;mall and circum&s;tantial Matters, when high in Degree, is of hurtful Tendency, for it de&s;troyeth Charity and Peace, and di&s;parages holy Zeal by Accident, making the profane think that all Zeal is no better than the fooli&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions of deceived Men; and hence it di&s;ables tho&s;e that have it to do Good, even when they are zealous for important Truth and Duty, for many will be inclined to
<PB N="13" REF="008745_0012_102FD864F4241D30">
think it of the &s;ame Nature with their eronious Zeal, and &s;o di&s;regard them. Now &s;eeing the Ca&s;e of &s;inful Zeal is &s;o awful and dangerous, it &s;hould put us all upon our guard, le&s;t we be de|ceived and en&s;nared by Satan and our own Hearts!</P>
<P>BUT the PIOUS <HI>ZEAL</HI> enjoined in our Text, is of a very different Kind, and may be thus de|&s;cribed, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is <HI>a devout Fervour or Warmth, wrought in the Affections of a regenerated Per&s;on by the holy Spirit, in the U&s;e of appointed Means, whereby they are carried out to the utmo&s;t, in promoting the Kingdom of God, from Love to his Maje&s;ty, with an Eye to his Glory, and according to the Directions of his written Word, (Romans</HI> xii. 11. <HI>James</HI> v. 16. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> i. 22 and 48.)</P>
<P>HERE ob&s;erve, that <HI>love</HI> to God, is the <HI>Principle</HI> from which this pious Pa&s;&s;ion proceeds, (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 14.) His <HI>Glory</HI> is its <HI>End,</HI> (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 31.) His <HI>Word</HI> is the <HI>Rule</HI> by which it is regulated, (<HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 16.) His <HI>Spirit</HI> its <HI>Efficient, (Rom.</HI> viii. 9.) And <HI>Regeneration</HI> its <HI>Antecedent, (Colo&s;&s;i.</HI> iii. 1, 2.) It is not a di&s;tinct Grace by it&s;elf, but the <HI>Vigor</HI> and fervent Operation of every <HI>Grace;</HI> and has the following <HI>Properties, viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="008745_0013_102FD86AE021C0F8">1. IT is <HI>according to Knowledge, (Rom.</HI> x. 2.) for Truth and Holine&s;s, and not for Error and Sin: It is &s;uch as a Man can give a Rea&s;on for, and &s;o is a <HI>rea&s;onable Service, (Rom.</HI> xii. 1.) Without Knowledge the Mind cannot be good, (<HI>Prov.</HI> xiii. 2.) The popi&s;h and enthu&s;ia&s;tical Notion therefore, that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion, is as fal&s;e as it is fooli&s;h and pernicious, a reproach to Chri&s;tianity, yea, a &s;candal to human Nature!</P>
<P N="2">2. SINCERE and &s;imple, for God and his King|dom, without mean Artifice and &s;elfi&s;h De&s;ign. (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 12.) <HI>For our rejoicing is this, even the Te&s;timony of our Con&s;cience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fle&s;hly Wi&s;dom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Conver&s;ation in the World.

<HI>the Word of God, but as of Sincerity, but as of God, in the &s;ight of God, &s;peak we in Chri&s;t,</HI> (2 <HI>Corin.</HI> ii. 17.)</P>
<P N="3">3. TEMPERED with <HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and attended with <HI>Meekne&s;s, Self-denial</HI> and <HI>Patience:</HI> True Zeal makes the Saints <HI>humble,</HI> Witne&s;s the <HI>Publican</HI> and Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, (Luke</HI> xviii. 13. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 15. <HI>Philip.</HI> iii, 8.) But while they think
<PB N="15" REF="008745_0014_102FD867C7C5FD80">
meanly of them&s;elves, they highly e&s;teem others, and give them all that Honor that is due to their &s;everal Places and Relations, (<HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. 7.) And while their Indignation burns again&s;t the Sins of Men becau&s;e of the di&s;honor done thereby to God; they feel Bowels of Pity towards their Per&s;ons! (<HI>Rev.</HI> ii. 2. <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 12.) When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tho' the meeke&s;t of Men, &s;aw the Calf which the People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had made, and Dancing, his Anger wax|ed hot, and he broke the Tables of Stone, (<HI>Ezod.</HI> xxxii. 19.) Yet he earne&s;tly plead for Mercy to|wards their Per&s;ons, (<HI>Exod.</HI> xxxiii. 19.) Thus our dear Lord looked on ungrateful Impenitents with <HI>Anger,</HI> who &s;ought to flay their kinde&s;t Be|nefactor; being <HI>grieved for the Hardne&s;s of their Hearts, (Mark</HI> iii. 5.) And hence we may learn that true <HI>Zeal</HI> is a compound of <HI>Anger</HI> and <HI>Grief,</HI> both which proceed from <HI>love</HI> to God and Man, and therefore is incon&s;i&s;tent with Barbarity and Blood! (<HI>See Gal.</HI> iv. 12. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 21. <HI>Luke</HI> ix. 53 to 57&punc;) <HI>Wilt then that we command Fire to come down from Heaven, and con&s;ume them? But he turn|ed and rebuked them, and &s;aid, Ye know not what Manner of Spirit ye are of: For the Son of Man is not come to de&s;troy Men's lives, but to &s;ave them.</HI> See how contrary Chri&s;t is to <HI>Dragooning</HI> for <HI>Religion,</HI> and &s;preading his <HI>&s;piritual Kingdom</HI> by the carnal Weapons of <HI>Sword</HI> and <HI>Terge:</HI> A Method which

&s;ome fierce Bigots would fain tamper with, to &s;pread the <HI>Shibboleths</HI> of their Schi&s;ms!
