<HEAD>I Ob&s;erve, in a <HI>Proclamation,</HI> given forth by Governour <HI>Fitch,</HI> of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> at the de&s;ire of the General A&s;&s;em|bly in <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, under the Con&s;ideration of the tokens of God's Di&s;plea&s;ure, by his Judgments already come upon us; and what we have cau&s;e to Fear is ha&s;tening, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is therefore Required, in order to a Reformation in &s;aid Colony, in the&s;e Words,&mdash;<HI>A Proclamation, command|ing and &s;trictly enjoining every A&s;&s;i&s;tant, Ju&s;tice of the Peace and all Grandjurymen &amp; other informing Officers within this Colony, in their re&s;pective Offices, duly to put in Ex|ecution, the Laws made for the Ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath or Lord's-Day, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To this I An&s;wer,&mdash; There is not the lea&s;t command, example, name nor the lea&s;t breath or tittle in Scripture for &s;aid Sabbath, much
<PB N="4" REF="008084_0003_102E25F54B1C96D8">
le&s;s for the ob&s;ervation of it; but comman|ded to be a day of labour, both in the Old Te&s;tament and New,&mdash; See Exod. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.9, 10. <HI>Six days &s;halt thou labour &amp; do all thy work, but the &s;eventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God</HI> &amp;c. Mat. 26.32. <HI>But after I am ri&s;en again, I will go before you into Galilee.</HI> Compare this with Chap. 28.1. to 10. and we may &s;ee, Chri&s;t before he &s;uffered, as al&s;o the Angel of the Lord upon his Re&s;urrection, and Chri&s;t him&s;elf requi|ring his Di&s;ciples, calling them Brethren, to go into Galilee, and there they &s;hould &s;ee him. Here is not the lea&s;t word &s;poken of a Sabbath; but commanded to labour, by travailing into another Province: Luke 3.1. as al&s;o John 20.19. <HI>Then the &s;ame day, at evening, being the fir&s;t day of the week, when the doors were &s;hut where the Di&s;ciples were a&s;&s;embled for fear of the Jews.</HI> Neither is here the lea&s;t tittle relating to a Sabbath, but called the fir&s;t day of the week, as thro' out the New Te&s;tament; and no where called Sabbath, but fir&s;t day of the week. And whereas you quote in your confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, Chap. 22.7. parag. Rev. 1.10. <HI>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day,</HI> and apply the words of the Apo&s;tle to the fir&s;t day of the week, and &s;ay, which in Scripture
<PB N="5" REF="008084_0004_102E25F6D8734318">
is called the Lord's Day, without any proof, from this text or any other text of Scripture, that the fir&s;t day of the week was ever &s;o intituled; or, that the Apo&s;tle had reference to any particular or natural day, but the time of Chri&s;t's revealing him&s;elf to him, and requiring him to write tho&s;e my&s;teries as Chri&s;t purpo&s;ed to reveal them; which, for ought we know, might be as long as Mo&s;es was with the Lord in Mount Sinai, writing the words of the Covenant, the ten Commandments, forty days and forty nights Exod 34.28. Thus you wre&s;t the Scrip|tures, by putting expo&s;itions of your own devi&s;ing, contrary to Scripture, and make them the foundation of your Sabbath, which is the main principle of your Religion.</P>
<P>And &s;ay,&mdash; <HI>This Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, we offer as our firm Per&s;wa&s;ion; well and fully grounded upon the holy Scriptures; and com|mend the &s;ame unto all, and particularly to the people of our Colony; to be examined, accepted &amp; con&s;tantly maintained: We do not a&s;&s;ume to our&s;elves that any thing be taken upon tru&s;t from us, but commend to our peo|ple the&s;e following Coun&s;els. &amp;c. Believe in all divine wor&s;hip: It not enough, that this or that act of wor&s;hip is not forbidden in the
<PB N="6" REF="008084_0005_102E25F948E3DD18">
word of God. If it be not commanded and you perform it, you may fear you will be found guilty, and expo&s;ed to divine di&s;plea&s;ure: Nadab and Abihu paid dear for offering in divine wor&s;hip that which the Lord comman|ded them not,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This taken out of your coun&s;els, and much more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which to be brief I omit: Thus by your good words and fair &s;peeches you deceive the hearts of the &s;imple. Rom. 16 18. <HI>For they that are &s;uch, &s;erve not our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t but their own Bellies; and by good words and fair &s;peeches deceive the hearts of the &s;imple:</HI> That is, &s;uch as lean upon your words but don't follow your coun&s;els, for your coun&s;els are good; agreeing with Rom 4.15. <HI>Where no law is there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion:</HI> al&s;o Chap. 5.13. <HI>Sin is not imputed when there is no law.</HI> But by your flattering words &amp; wre&s;|ting the Scriptures, you deceive the world and worldly powers, who are all joined to|gether in a &s;pirit of flattery in the love and friend&s;hip of the world, and &s;o &s;hut your &s;elves out from believing in God, John 5.44. And are become enemies to God, Jam. 4.4. While you think your &s;elves more righteous than others in the performance of your own in&s;titutions of wor&s;hip; but you
<PB N="7" REF="008084_0006_102E25FDC9FB1590">
are in danger of its turning to your greater condemnation.</P>
<P>I al&s;o ob&s;erve, in the clo&s;e of &s;aid Pro|clamation, &mdash; our pre&s;ent King intituled, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. As al&s;o in the clo&s;e of a Proclamation, for a Fa&s;t, the 31&s;t day of Augu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t; and both under &s;aid Governor's hand, and doubtle&s;s it is his u&s;u|al manner &s;o to write. It may be well for us to know how the King came by that Title, it being no Scripture title given to any King neither Jew nor Gentile; but I find the Pope gave to Henry the 8th, King of England, the Title, Defender of the Faith, and to all his Succe&s;&s;ors, becau&s;e he wrote a Book again&s;t Luther, in defence of Popery, &s;ee the Hi&s;t, of Engl. N. Tindal Vol. I. Pag. 749. But &s;aid Luther was an in&s;trument under God, of a great reformation out of Popery, which cau&s;ed the Pope to do his utmo&s;t endeavour to &s;uppre&s;s him, and by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the Title is continued to the Kings of England to this day, as we &s;ee; &s;o that if we acknowlege the authority of the Title we mu&s;t acknowlege the authority of the giv|er; which opens a door to all Popery, for the Pope gave the Title in commendation of the &s;aid King, for oppo&s;ing God's faithful Mi|ni&s;ter, for preaching again&s;t the &s;aid Pope,
<PB N="8" REF="008084_0007_102E25FFAF701E88">
or popi&s;h Idolatry; and by &s;aid King and Parliament confirming and defending po|pi&s;h Articles, it opened a door to Bi&s;hops, Chancellors, Prelates &amp; divers ranks of Men, both in the popi&s;h Church and common Wealth, to break in upon Chri&s;t's flock like &s;o many &s;orts of ravenous Bea&s;ts, taring and devouring, and few got out of their hands, but were burnt to Death, under the name of Hereticks. Thus we may &s;ee the &s;tupid|ne&s;s, yea, blindne&s;s of our reputed wife and learned Men; to wit, the rulers and e&s;tab|li&s;h'd Mini&s;ters, to te&s;tify again&s;t Popery&punc; &amp; yet adore &s;uch a popi&s;h title, for now 200 years or more; for faith in God i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> the foun|dation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Religion, but without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e him, &s;ee Heb. 11.6. al&s;o Mark 11 22 <HI>Je&s;us an&s;wering, &s;aith unto them, have faith in God</HI> To have faith in God excludes our faith to be in Popes or Kings, or in any mortal fle&s;h: but as the Devil deceived our fir&s;t Parents thro' his &s;ubtilty, &s;o al&s;o by this Title given to the King, by the mo&s;t holy Lord Pope, Chri&s;t's vicegerent on earth, &s;o called. It is a title of Honour, and mu&s;t needs be en&s;naring to the whole Kingdom; for, if the King be defender of the Faith, then every Man in authority under him, has a &s;hare in the Title,

and may be &s;aid to be defenders of the Faith with the King, according to their office. Now let us &s;ee how far the two Govern|ments, to wit, Bo&s;ton and Connecticut, have clo&s;ed in practice with this popi&s;h Title, to defend their in&s;titutions of Wor&s;hip; fir&s;t Connecticut, &s;ee their Law, Entituled <HI>Here|ticks,</HI> as followeth.</P>

BUT notwith&s;tanding the repealing this Law, there has been great Per&s;ecutions in Connecticut Colony, by Fining, Whip|ping and Impri&s;oning, and other inhumane doings, towards tho&s;e that under &s;cruple of Con&s;cience, have withdrawn from their e|&s;tabli&s;hed Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>As to Bo&s;ton Government, they Per&s;e|cuted the Annabapti&s;ts in 1651, by Fining, Whipping and Impri&s;oning, in defence of the then e&s;tabli&s;hed Wor&s;hip: See Daniel Neal's Hi&s;tory of New-England, Vol. I. Pag. 278, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And the fir&s;t People called Quakers that came from England to Bo&s;ton, was in the be|ginning of July, 1656, viz. Mary Fi&s;her and Ann Au&s;tin; but before they came on Shore, the Deputy-Governor &s;ent on board the Ship, and took their Papers, and about 100 Books from them, and ordered them, to be kept Pri&s;oners there until he &s;hould &s;end for them; and &s;aid Books were Burnt by the common Hang|man. And in the Month following, came eight more, viz. four Men and four Wo|men, and Suffered in like manner: Their Boxes, Che&s;ts and Trunks being &s;earched
<PB N="13" REF="008084_0012_102E260C26C94A70">
before they came on Shore; and their Books were Burnt, &amp; they committed to Pri&s;on, be|cau&s;e &s;uch as were call'd Quakers, but not for what they had done, either good or evil; and kept clo&s;e Pri&s;oners, and a Five Pound Fine for any that &s;hould &s;peak with them; to prevent People from having any Com|munion or Communicating to them things not practi&s;ed to the wor&s;t of Murderers, together with many other Inhumanities.</P>
<P>I here note a Speech of John Indicot, Governour of Bo&s;ton, to one that came to Bo&s;ton with tho&s;e afore&s;aid,&mdash;<HI>Take heed,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>you break not our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws, for then ye are &s;ure to &s;tretch by a Halter</HI>&mdash; A threatning word by the Papi&s;ts to the Martyrs, was, fry a Faggot. And &s;hall we believe when God takes Vengeance on tho&s;e that put his Saints and Martyrs to Death by Fire and Faggots, will not Mea&s;ure the &s;ame Mea&s;ure to them that put them to Death by a Halter and Gallows. I al&s;o cite another &s;peach of &s;aid Governour, to a Wo|man, after &s;he had been put in Pri&s;on, and Whipt Ten Stripes, with a threefold Corded knotted Whip; <HI>That they were likely to have a Law to Hang her, if &s;he came hither again.</HI> To which &s;he an&s;wered,&mdash; <HI>If God call us, wo be to us if we come not: And I que&s;tion not, but he whom we love will make us not

<P>Patience Scot, a Girl about eleven Years old, came from Providence to bear Witne&s;s again&s;t Per&s;ecution; who was &s;ent to Pri&s;|on, there to remain until the &s;etting of the Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tants: The Child, it &s;eems, was not of Years as to Law, to deal with her by Bani&s;hment, but otherwi&s;e in under|&s;tanding, for &s;he confounded her Adver&s;a|ries; and &s;ome of them confe&s;t, <HI>that they had many Children, and they had been well Educated; and that it were well if they could &s;peak half &s;o much for God as &s;he could for the Devil:</HI> An Ignorant and Bla&s;phe|mous Speech!

was the e&s;tabli&s;hed Mini&s;ters and Au|thority in fellow&s;hip together, who fought by Per&s;ecution, under the Dragon; as in Chap. 13.6. <HI>And he opened his Mouth in Bla&s;phemy again&s;t God, to Bla&s;|pheme his Name, and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven.</HI> In An&s;wer, to this Text, I &s;hall recite &s;ome of the foregoing In&s;tances; as fir&s;t, Governour Endicot's An&s;wer to a Woman, as afore|&s;aid; that in obedience to God, they &s;hould not count their Lives dear, &amp;c. Said Governour replied, &mdash; <HI>And we &s;hall be as ready to take away your Lives, as ye &s;hall be to lay them down.</HI> This was high Contempt again&s;t the Throne of God, and Bla&s;pheming his Name and his Tabernacle, and them that dwell in Heaven; and in a &s;pecial Manner, &s;uch Saints as &s;hould &s;o chearfully lay down their Lives for God's Name, and truth &s;ake, &amp;c. As al&s;o of Patience Scot afore&s;aid; that they had many Children, and they had been well Educated, and that it were well if they could &s;peak half &s;o much for God as &s;he could for the Devil: This was al&s;o Bla&s;phemy, to put God in the place of the Devil, and the Devil in the place of God; but &s;o they Wor&s;hip, &s;ee ver. 4. <HI>And

they Wor&s;hipped the Dragon, which gave Power to the Bea&s;t, and they Wor&s;hip|ped the Bea&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I &s;hall al&s;o mention one in&s;tance of &s;aid Wil&s;on, Prie&s;t of Bo&s;ton; who &s;aid
<Q>he would carry Fire in one Hand, and Faggots in the other, to Burn all the Quakers in the World:</Q>
Who ha|ving Friend's Books in his Hand, as they were Burning; Friend's Books by order of Authority; he threw them al&s;o into the Fire, &s;aying,
<Q>From the De|vil they came, and to the Devil let them go:</Q>
This &s;hews he was both a Bla&s;pheamer and a Murderer in his Heart.</P>
<P>I de&s;ire the Reader to take Notice. That all the afore&s;aid Per&s;ecutions were carried on to defend their form of Wor|&s;hip, or image made to the Bea&s;t, Rev. Chap. 13 ver. 14, 15. And not the lea&s;t tit|tle of a tender Con&s;cience toward God in it all; neither in Mini&s;ters nor Au|thority; for when they could not over|come by Cruelty and Death, to keep them out of their Government, but their Doctrine &s;pread among the People, then they tried to weary them out by Fines, without regard to Con&s;cience or Scrip|ture,
<PB N="26" REF="008084_0025_102E262CC2CFB618">
Five Shillings a Week, for not coming to the allowed Meetings; and if they met among them&s;elves, the Fine was Forty Shillings a Time, for every Speaker, and Ten Shillings a Time for every hearer, and Forty Shillings a Time for the owner of the Place; and for refu&s;ing to Swear, the Fine was Five Pounds, &s;o often as the Oath was ten|dered as afore&s;aid, and they refu&s;ed for Con&s;cience &s;ake, becau&s;e it was forbid|den by Chri&s;t, Matth. 5.34, &amp;c. As al&s;o, James 5.12. And the not taking off the Hatt before Authority, was a Fine of Twenty Shillings; and if any entertained a Quaker, if but a quar|ter of an Hour, he was to forfeit Five Pounds, &s;aid Authority al&s;o cau&s;ed Ma|ry Fi&s;her, and Ann Au&s;tin afore&s;aid, to be &s;tripped &s;tart Naked, and &s;o to be Searched, under a &s;u&s;picion of Witch|es, and mi&s;u&s;ed as one of them: A married Woman, and a Mother of five Children, &s;uffered not the like in the bearing any of them into the World; but what proof of Witches could they have in &s;o doing: But mark what fol|lowed in Bo&s;ton Government, Twenty innocent Per&s;ons were put to Death,

for &s;uppo&s;ed Witchcraft, and above an Hundred and Fifty Impri&s;oned, and a|bove Two Hundred more Accu&s;ed, and &s;ome fled into other Governments to &s;ave thair Lives; &s;ee Cotton Ma|ther's Book of Witches, Page 110, &amp;c. But not one Quaker accu&s;ed on that Account; &s;ee &s;aid Whiting, Page 37.</P>
<P>By all the&s;e doings, under a pretence to defend the Wor&s;hip of God, it is evident it was to defend the Wor&s;hip of the Devil, under all their formalities and in&s;titutions of Wor&s;hip; the Devil was the Author of all their Cruelties: And as to the Cruelties done to the Engli&s;h Captives by the Indians, noted by &s;aid Mather, who calls them
<Q>mer|cile&s;s Tygers, who&s;e tende. Mercies are Cruel; the wor&s;t of Executioners, the mo&s;t Bea&s;tly &amp; Bloody Things that ever wore the &s;hape of Men in the World, and Devils Incarnate.</Q>
Thus he Con|demns the Cruelties done to the Engli&s;h Captives by the Indians, but don't call in que&s;tion their Cruelties done to the Qua|kers. And as to his Confe&s;&s;ions to the Judgments of God on them, in his late Church Hi&s;tory of New-England;
<PB N="28" REF="008084_0027_102E2631EF1ED9D8">

Their &s;econd Que&s;tion, Page 107,
<Q>What is to be done, that &s;o the&s;e Evils may be reformed?</Q></P>
<P>I &s;ay, neither &s;aid Mather nor Mi|ni&s;ters have called in que&s;tion a word of their Per&s;ecuting the Quakers: And many of the Quakers fore-telling the Judgments of God coming upon &s;ome of the mo&s;t violent Per&s;ecutors, which al&s;o came to pa&s;s; and of God's Judg|ments coming on New-England in ge|neral; which &s;aid Mather and Mini|&s;ters have confe&s;&s;ed too, but not as fore told by the Quakers; which &s;hews they were in the &s;ame willful Blindne&s;s and hardne&s;s of Heart, and not willing that the Truth &s;hould be made mani|fe&s;t; as their Ance&s;tors were that Per|&s;ecuted them; which is now more than an Hundred Years pa&s;t; fir&s;t the An|nabapti&s;ts, then the Quakers.</P>
<P>And as for Connecticut, from what is afore&s;aid, it is evident they have

been vile Per&s;ecutors; and God has been going on with his Judgments, on both Governments; and they have been going on, Wor&s;hipping the Dra|gon, under their own In&s;titutions of Wor&s;hip; and Mini&s;ters, in the man|ner of Jeroboam's Prie&s;ts, and defen|ded by humane Authority, which makes it the compleat Wor&s;hip of the Dra|gon; and they Crying,
<Q>What are the Evils, that have provoked the Lord to &s;end his Judgments on New-England?</Q></P>
<P>Will God be enquired of by &s;uch a People as this? that have rebelled again&s;t his Warnings, and &s;o inhumane|ly Per&s;ecuted his Servants; and put &s;ome to Death, viz. Bo&s;ton, and &s;ay,
