<P>Behold, I &s;tand at the Door, and knock: If any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, and will &s;up with him, and he with me.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT hath plea&s;ed the mo&s;t wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of all Things, out of the Riches of his Free <HI>Grace,</HI> to tender Je&s;us Chri&s;t to poor, lo&s;t and undone Sinners; and al&s;o it plea&s;ed the Lord Je&s;us, not only to die for Sinners, to redeem them from Death, and the Cur&s;e of the Law, that he might open a Way for poor lo&s;t Sinners, to return to God, but is plea&s;ed to &s;tand knocking at the Door of their Hearts, to woo, to be&s;eech and intreat poor Souls to be re|conciled to God.</P>
<P>The&s;e Words now read, are very full of Matter, and upon each Word might be almo&s;t written an intire Vo|lumn; but my narrow &s;cantling will not permit me to explain the Terms, only come to the main Thing intended.

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P>That Je&s;us Chri&s;t waits and calls long upon Sin|ners, and earne&s;tly labours with them for Admi&s;|&s;ion: He &s;tands at the Door and knocks.</P>
<P>An Hundred and twenty Years waited he upon the old World; thirty Years upon the <HI>Jews;</HI> forty Years in the Wilderne&s;s by Signs and Wonders; the&s;e one hundred Years well nigh hath he waited upon <HI>Eng|land.</HI> Twenty Years he waits upon one Sinner, forty Years upon another. How often doth he &s;ay to us, <Q>Open to me, my Si&s;ter, my Love, my Dove, my Un|denied; for my Head is filled with the Dew, and my Locks with the Drops of the Night,</Q> <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.2. <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.37. <Q>How often would I have gathered thy Children as a Hen gathereth her Chickens, but ye would not</Q>? What doth the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages hold forth but the Love of Chri&s;t? But to enlarge a little,</P>
<P><HI>Fri&s;t,</HI> Chri&s;t gives not Sinners over, tho' they have given him no An&s;wer at all, tho' they lie in the Bed of Ignorance, and mind not the Dignity of his Per&s;on, nor the Heavenline&s;s of his Voice, nor the Excellency of his Salvation, and tho' he call louder and louder, and knock harder and harder, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 3.11) <Q>It is high Time to awake out of Sleep, the Night is far &s;pent, the Day is at hand</Q>; yet Chri&s;t waits &s;till to be gracious.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Chri&s;t hath continued knocking and call|ing tho' Sinners have made light of his Invitations. Tho' the Soul be lazy, and hath put off his Coat, and cannot put it on, and hath wa&s;hed his Feet, and is loth to defile them; yet for all this, Chri&s;t puts his Hand in by the Hole of the Door.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Chri&s;t hath not given over knocking, tho' Sinners have opened their Mouths again&s;t him, and
<PB N="4" REF="004778_0004_100DF93AFAD71C40">
reviled him yet he &s;tands thru&s;ting at the Po&s;t of the Sinners Hearts, and he waits and labours much to reconcile the Soul to God. He &s;ends his Mini&s;ters who intreat and exhort, tho' all to no Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But to give you the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> why Chri&s;t is thus gracious to &s;uch gracele&s;s Souls.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> I. Chri&s;t continues knocking at the Sinners Heart, that he might glorify his free Grace and Love in converting &s;ome poor Soul to him&s;elf. That the Soul might be brought to &s;ee the tender Care of Chri&s;t and his vehement De&s;ire to be&s;tow him&s;elf upon him: That he might at Length &s;ee the free Bounty of Chri&s;t in his long calling, <HI>Open to me, Open to me:</HI> That it might &s;ee Salvation to be had no where el&s;e. That the Heart at length &s;ees it mu&s;t open to Chri&s;t or el&s;e it mu&s;t peri&s;h; that it might &s;ee its lo&s;t Condition without Chri&s;t: That it might &s;ee Chri&s;t's Travel|lings, and Sufferings, Torments and Tortures, and all to redeem and &s;ave them which was lo&s;t and undone forever without him.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> II. Chri&s;t continues knocking and inviting that in the End he might gain the Soul to e&s;teem him as the only and de&s;irable Object in the World. That the Sinner at length may confe&s;s it is better to let Chri&s;t in, than keep Chri&s;t out. That the Soul may &s;ee him whom he hath reviled, yea, crucified, all his Life, &s;ee him to be the &s;weete&s;t Saviour, livelie&s;t Man in the World, and delight in him, and as it were be ravi&s;hed with his Excellencies.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> III. Chri&s;t knocks long at the Door of the Sinners Hearts, that thereby he might magnify the Glory of his Ju&s;tice, in their meer Ruin and De&s;truc|tion. For, O Soul, wilt thou be left without Excu&s;e? Thou &s;tout Rebel, that &s;tood'&s;t it out again&s;t the
<PB N="5" REF="004778_0005_100DF93DADD60240">
Lord, that tho' he called again and again, thou wa&s;t re&s;olved thou would not hear, tho' Mercy were upon his Knee before thee, and beg'd thee to give Admi&s;|&s;ion to the Lord of Life; yet Impenitent thou wert, and Impenitent thou would'&s;t be; ay, and mi&s;erable wert, and mi&s;erable, thou woulde&s;t be.</P>
<P>Therefore will he magnify the Glory of his Ju&s;tice upon thee, and make thee &s;mart to Purpo&s;e, becau&s;e thou would'&s;t not hear the Voice of the Charmer, tho' he charmed never &s;o wi&s;ely. Now you have no longer any Cloak for your Sins, now take what falls, and expect a Reward according to your Works; <Q>For the righteous Lord loveth Righteou&s;ne&s;s, but the Wicked his Soul hateth:</Q> As it is in <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 11.5, 6, 7. Ver&s;es, No marvel now if the Lord rain Fire and Brim&s;tone, and an horrible Tempe&s;t; for this &s;hall be the Portion of their Cup, who have de|&s;pi&s;ed the rich Grace of GOD, and abu&s;ed his Pati|ence and Long-&s;uffering towards them: <HI>Mal.</HI> 4.1. <Q>For the Day is coming that &s;hall burn as an Oven, and all the Proud, yea, and all that do wickedly &s;hall be as Stubble; and the Day cometh that &s;hall burn them up, &s;aith the Lord; and &s;hall leave them neither Root nor Branch.</Q></P>
<P>But to proceed to the APPLICATION which is the main Thing intended. The USES I &s;hall make are the&s;e:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Exhortation to Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Terror and Affrightment.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Encouragement.</HI> And then clo&s;e all with &s;ome Directions.</P>

<P>USE I. Of EXHORTATION, to exhort and &s;tir up, if po&s;&s;ible every &s;ecure Sinner to &s;tand it out no longer, but to &s;et open your Hearts, that the King of Glory
<PB N="6" REF="004778_0006_100DF93F363C00B0">
may enter in. O Sinner, now Chri&s;t is &s;tanding and calling to thy Soul, <HI>If thou hear and open, I will come in unto thee.</HI> Now Chri&s;t is &s;aying, <HI>I know thy Work,</HI> I know well enough what thou ha&s;t been, and what thou ha&s;t done. I know thou ha&s;t been a Bla&s;phemer, or a Drunkard, or a Whore-monger, or a Thief, or a Liar, or a Sabbath-breaker, or a Scorner: Yet I &s;tand at the Door this Day, and knock, I will receive thee unto Mercy, I will forgive thee all thy Sins, I will accept, I will heal, I will &s;ave thy Soul, if thou wilt open thy Heart this Day unto me, and let me in. O Brethren, for Chri&s;t's Sake refu&s;e not Chri&s;t, Do not reject, nor neglect &s;o great a Salvation, &s;o am|ple a Salvation, &s;o waiting a Salvation, le&s;t you peri&s;h.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Con&s;ider,</HI> The Nece&s;&s;ity you have of him, 'Give me Children or el&s;e I die,' &s;aith <HI>Rachel:</HI> O give me Chri&s;t, or el&s;e I peri&s;h forever. Can you be &s;aved without Chri&s;t? And if you may have Chri&s;t, but for opening the Door; <Q>Then while he is calling to day, hear and open to him.</Q> If the Door of Grace &s;hould be &s;hut, thou would'&s;t be &s;hut up with a Ven|geance forever.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Con&s;ider,</HI> What An&s;wers thou wilt be able to make at the great Day if thou wilt harden thy Heart and not open. Why, what wilt thou? Why, what can&s;t thou plead for thy &s;elf at the Day of Judgment? Wilt thou &s;ay, the Go&s;pel never offered thee Chri&s;t? Why thou ha&s;t heard this Day, <Q>If any Man will hear and open, I will come in and &s;up with him.</Q> Wilt thou &s;ay, I would have opened my Heart, had it not been for the Love of Sin, or for Ea&s;e, or Li|berty, or Honour, or Friends, or Companions! Oh! how will Men and Angels hi&s;s at thee <Q>This is the Per&s;on who for Lu&s;ts Sake, for&s;ook his Mercies!
<PB N="7" REF="004778_0007_100DF94154BB6368">
Who for a little Vanity, rejected his own Salvation!</Q> O how wilt thou cur&s;e thy &s;elf for Nothing: Nay, for that which is wor&s;e than Nothing: Thou ha&s;t put off Chri&s;t and his Salvation; therefore Men and Brethren and Fathers, hearken unto me. As <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aid to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> &s;o this Day I propound unto you <Q>Ble&s;&s;ings and Cur&s;ings, Life and Death; Salvation if you open to Chri&s;t, and Damnation if you re|fu&s;e Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>For the Lord's Sake, chu&s;e not Cur&s;ing, but Ble&s;|&s;ing; chu&s;e not Death but Life; chu&s;e not Hell, but Heaven, chu&s;e not Sin, but Chri&s;t. Tho' you have formerly &s;lighted him, if you will now regard, tho' you have formerly contemned him, yet if you will now prai&s;e him; tho' if you have formerly re|&s;i&s;ted, if yet you will yield, if yet you will con&s;ent, if yet you will become willing to open unto <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> Chri&s;t will be yours, <HI>Mercy</HI> will be yours, and Salva|tion will be yours.</P>
<P>And what would you have more? What, will not this do? Will not Mercy allure you? Will not Love con&s;train you: Then give me leave to reprove you, and affright you, (if it be po&s;&s;ible) out of tho&s;e Depths of Satan, unto which you are fallen. However, I am re&s;olved whether you will or no; and the Lord fa&s;ten it upon your Souls.</P>

<P>USE II. Of TERROR, To you who have no Com|munion with Chri&s;t, that have refu&s;ed to let in the King of Glory. Oh! &s;eriou&s;ly lay to Heart your un&s;peakable Mi&s;ery forever.</P>
<P>And here I know not how to begin; If Non-Communion with the Church of God, be &s;o direful a Cur&s;e, that makes <HI>Cain</HI> cry out; <Q>Thou ha&s;t dri|ven me out this Day from the Face of the Earth,

<P>O Soul, where wilt thou abide after Death? Let me beg of thee to a&s;k thy Soul the <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> following.</P>
<P>In the Bowels of Love and Mercy let me beg thee to a&s;k thy Soul this <HI>Que&s;tion;</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> I. How long will this Life and the Comforts of it la&s;t? Thy Soul is immortal and mu&s;t never die; but it mu&s;t have a Being &s;omewhere to all Eternity.</P>
<P>This Worlds Happine&s;s is it everla&s;ting? No &s;ure|ly; thy Money, and thy Corn, and thy Land will do the no Good in the great Day. Oh! what ha&s;t thou done for hereafter? what ha&s;t thou laid up for the World to come? Is the Door of thy Heart open to Chri&s;t? Alas! Is thy poor Soul Un-armed all this while?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> II. What will become of thee when this Life and the Comforts thereof are gone? O hard hearted Sinner, this broad Way which thou walke&s;t on, will never lead thee to the promi&s;ed Land. Thy Gold and Silver Key will never open Heavens Gate for thee: Thy Care of this World's Goods will not plead for thee before the Judge; all thy careful Friends, Acquaintance, with whom thou had &s;pent many joy|ful Hours, will &s;tand thee in no &s;tead.</P>
<P>Then thou wilt be ready to cry, O where is the Chri&s;t that I have de&s;pi&s;ed? O where is the Je&s;us which I have re&s;i&s;ted? Will he plead for me? No &s;urely: <Q>But go to the God's whom thou ha&s;t cho|&s;en</Q>:
<PB N="9" REF="004778_0009_100DF945AE3BA5C8">
Oh what will become of me? Mu&s;t I not die? O whither will Death carry me? Into which of the Regions of the World will my Death land me? either of Light or Darkne&s;s? To which of the&s;e two Regions am I now travelling? Certainly the Way of Plea&s;ure, or worldly Profit, the broad Way of the World, its not the Way to tran&s;port me to Heaven and everla&s;ting Happine&s;s. Say, O Sinner to thy Soul, What mu&s;t I be taken from all my Glory and Great|ne&s;s, from all my Delights and Dalliances, and be thrown like <HI>Lucifer,</HI> Son of the Morning, from all my Brightne&s;s into Blackne&s;s and Darkne&s;s forever? When Death hath clos'd up my Eyes, mu&s;t I awake in everla&s;ting Flames? Ay Sinner, Thou &s;halt with|out Remedy, unle&s;s thou open to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> III. A&s;k thy Soul on which Hand thou art like to &s;tand in the Day of Judgment; on the Right Hand or on the left: Among the Sheep, or among the Goats? If thou wilt not hear and open now; if thou wilt not open thy Heart now, be a&s;&s;ured the Devil will open Hell's Mouth for thee. What will be the End of tho&s;e Joys which now makes glad thy Heart; you who are in the broad Way to De&s;truction and utter Separation from God's Pre&s;ence for ever? Thy Plea&s;ures here we may judge of: Oh! but who can tell the Thou&s;and part of tho&s;e fiery Torments, to which thou art liable unto in the other World.</P>
<P>While thou live&s;t here, thou art a cur&s;ed Sinner, and when thou die&s;t, thou &s;halt be a damned Crea|ture: While thou live&s;t, thou art fed like a Bea&s;t by common Providence, and art a meer Stranger to never fading Promi&s;es. If thou looke&s;t Upwards, God is frowning, and his Wrath is revealed from Heaven a|gain&s;t

thee, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.18. The Heavens and their Ho&s;ts are ready every Moment to di&s;charge God's Cur&s;es, like Thunder-bolts again&s;t thee.

<P>Ah! when thou die&s;t Man, what mu&s;t thou then do? When the Captain Death &s;trikes, whole Armies of Wolves will fall upon thee. Look to, it and re|member thou wert once warned; for if thou die&s;t naturally, before thou live&s;t &s;piritually, thou die&s;t e|ternally. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>'s Prayer was, <Q>O Lord, hack me, hew me, burn me here; but &s;pare me here|after.</Q> As long as thou refu&s;e&s;t to hear Chri&s;t's Voice, thou ha&s;t a Hell upon Earth. It is not the Multitude of thy Companions that go thither, &s;hall any whit le&s;&s;en thy Torments, but rather increa&s;e them. <Q>Thy Life that hath been full of worldly Joy, &s;hall end in deadly Woe.</Q></P>
<P>All you into who&s;e Hands this little Book &s;hall come; O let me beg you to con&s;ider, if you have any Bowels of Love to your own Souls, how your Hearts can endure to think of being &s;hut out of Hea|ven, out of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s for ever. A&s;k your Hearts the&s;e Que&s;tions; <Q>Can I burn? Can I endure the Vengeance of eternal Fire? Will boiled Oil, burn|ing Brim&s;tone, &s;calding Lead, a glowing Oven, a &s;corching Furnace be an ea&s;y Lodging for me?</Q> Oh! Why my Soul, wilt thou not be per&s;waded to repent? Is there too much Pain in that? Thou art ready to &s;ay, Thou can&s;t not bear a Cro&s;s, nor an

Affliction, a Scoff, or a Reproach. Talk to thee of the crucifying of the Fle&s;h, of parting with thy Lu&s;t, with thy worldly Companions, of entring in at the &s;trait Gate? <Q>O the&s;e are hard Sayings, who can bear them?</Q> But how wilt thou do to dwell with devouring Fire, how wilt thou dwell with everla&s;ting Burnings? <Q>What&s;oever thou thinke&s;t now, think what Hell will be when the Day comes thou mu&s;t de&s;cend into it?</Q> Thou maye&s;t drink or laugh away the Fear of it, but what will it be to thee when thou feele&s;t thy &s;elf wrapped in the Flames of it, and not a Drop of Water to cool thy Tongue? Think on Hell, O Soul, and then think on Chri&s;t; and con&s;i|der if a Redeemer from &s;uch a Mi&s;ery, be not worth the accepting of? Think on Hell, and think on Sin, and carnal Plea&s;ures and Delights; con&s;ider how they will reli&s;h with thee, when thus &s;alted with everla&s;t|ing Fire. Are the&s;e the Price for which thou &s;elle&s;t thy Soul to Hell, Oh! bid the&s;e Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures be gone, bid your Companions and Sin be gone; and tho' you loved them well, and have &s;pent your time &s;infully with them; yet tell them you mu&s;t not burn for them; that you will not damn your Soul to plea&s;e your Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly as may be, laid down the U&s;e of Terror, which I hope will awaken &s;ome poor Souls, out of the Depths of carnal Security: Now I &s;hall proceed to the la&s;t U&s;e of Encouragement; To encourage poor &s;ecure Sinners, to venture to lay fa&s;t hold on Chri&s;t, before that it be too late.</P>

Thou can'&s;t never come to the Wedding Supper, without the Wedding-Garment: The old Man mu&s;t be done away, before all Things can be made new: <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.14. <Q>Oh! <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> wa&s;h thy Heart from Wickedne&s;s, that thou may&s;t be &s;aved.</Q> <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.31. <Q>Make you a new Heart, for why will you die?</Q> <HI>Acts</HI> 16.31. <HI>Saith</HI> Paul <HI>to the Jaylor,</HI> <Q>Repent and be baptized, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved and thy Hou&s;e.</Q> Chri&s;t will never enter into an unclean Heart. O get thy Heart wa&s;hed by the Tears of true and hearty Repentance, and then Chri&s;t will come in, and dwell with thee.</P>
<P>By this Time, I hope you &s;ee the ab&s;olute Nece&s;|&s;ity of clo&s;ing with Chri&s;t, and of opening the Door to him.</P>
<P>And having given you &s;ome Directions, &s;uffer me now in the Conclu&s;ion, to per&s;uade you by all the Bowels of Love and Mercy, which Chri&s;t doth exer|ci&s;e towards you. If Chri&s;t had come to de&s;troy your Souls, he could not have had le&s;s Welcome: Will you not believe Chri&s;t? Will you never believe his Me&s;&s;engers? If the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel had been Me&s;&s;engers &s;ent up from the bottomle&s;s Pit, to de|ceive Nations, to de&s;troy Souls, to drag them down
<PB N="14" REF="004778_0014_100DF94F65D09678">
to everla&s;ting Darkne&s;s, there could hardly been a greater Hate and Outcry again&s;t them. Oh! Hath Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;weated, groaned, travelled, laboured in Pain, and all to bring forth a Lie? Did he die to purge, clean&s;e and wa&s;h his People, and when all comes to all, is it but a Cheat? What do you mean Sinners, by your wilful Neglect? See what's the Rea|&s;on of this Abu&s;e of God's Grace, Mercy and Pati|ence; comes it not from Sin? O it is Sin that hath made Men Devils; Devils again&s;t God, Devils again&s;t one another. There is but one, and let his Wicked+ne&s;s have its full Cour&s;e, he would do his utmo&s;t to damn all the World: It is SIN.</P>
<P>O Friends; let me beg of you, to con&s;ider what SIN hath done: Go to Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> and &s;ee what it hath done there. What was it that &s;lew the Lord of Glory; that put Chri&s;t to Death; was it not tho&s;e Sins which were laid upon him? The&s;e were his Betrayers, his Murtherers: The&s;e were the Thorns, the Nails, the Spear, that wounded HIM. Let the Sweat, the Cries, the Groans, the Blood, the Soul that was pierced and poured out by Sin, let the&s;e &s;peak. Turn a&s;ide from Mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> and go down to the Valley of <HI>Hinnom,</HI> lay your Ear to the Mount <HI>Tophet</HI> and hearken O poor Soul, what Work SIN hath done there. What is it that hath filled Hell &s;o full already? What &s;ent down <HI>Cain, Judas, Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira,</HI> with tho&s;e Millions of dead Souls that are already tormented in tho&s;e Flames? Stand and admire, O thou that art not there to bear them Company! 'Tis meerly the Mercy of God that &s;pareth thee: Oh therefore, <Q>Be not high-mind|ed, but fear.</Q> Did God puni&s;h &s;o many damned Souls for nothing, for a Trifle; inflict &s;o great Tor|ments
<PB N="15" REF="004778_0015_100DF951C2EB3528">
for &s;o &s;mall Offence? What was it that ca&s;t them thither? Was it their Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or rather, was it not their Iniquities? If you &s;tep down to tho&s;e Chambers of Death, and a&s;k tho&s;e wretched Creatures, 'Friends how came you hither'? What would they an&s;wer? <Q>Oh! It is our SINS brought us into this Place of Torment.</Q> Oh, &s;ays one, <Q>'Twas my Covetou&s;ne&s;s bro't me hither. Oh, &s;ays another Twas my Pride, my Wantonne&s;s, and my Slothful|ne&s;s: Oh! SIN! SIN! SIN! This is that for which we burn, we roar, we rave, we die, we die eternally.</Q> O therefore Sinners, de&s;pi&s;e not the Riches of his Grace any longer, lea&s;t his Wrath break forth, and he tear you in Pieces, and there be none to Help. But let me beg of you to open the Door of your Hearts, <Q>that the King of Glory may enter in.</Q> Take the Yoke of Chri&s;t upon you, for that is ea&s;y, and his Burden, for it is light. Wa&s;h your Hearts from your Iniquities, that you may be &s;aved: Oh! How long &s;hall vain Thoughts lodge within you? And my Prayer to God for you &s;hall be, <Q>That the God of Peace, would &s;anctify you whol|ly; and I pray God, That your whole Spirit, Soul and Body, may be pre&s;erved blamele&s;s, unto the Coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> Now the God of Peace make you perfect in every good Work, to do his Will, working in you that which is well plea&s;ing in his Sight; that after you have run with Joy the Race which is &s;et before you, you may po&s;&s;e&s;s a King|dom, and a Crown which is Incorruptible, which fa|deth not away, re&s;erved in Heaven for you.</P>
