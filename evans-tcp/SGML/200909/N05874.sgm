<HEAD>A REMONSTRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>I Think it is evident, beyond all Rea&s;on of Controver&s;y, that no Order, Office or Pro|fe&s;&s;ion among Mankind, hath been treated more roughly, and with more &s;atyre and Sarca&s;m, by the <HI>Independent Reflector,</HI> in his Weekly E&s;&s;ays, than the Clergy; yet I, who am a Clergyman, and be&s;ides, one that openly accepted the <HI>Re|flector's</HI> Challenge, not from a Spirit of Liti|giou&s;ne&s;s and Contention, but to take away the Reproach from the Armies of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> do, notwith&s;tanding, condole the <HI>Reflector's</HI> Fate; nor could I have imagined his Cata&s;trophe would have been &s;uch, as the Event hath a&s;cer|tained; I thought an Author of &s;o ma&s;terly a Pen, who be&s;ides is &s;o zealous an Advocate for Liberty, would have met with more Ap|plau&s;e, and better Encouragement, than that his own Printer &s;hould find it his Intere&s;t to ca&s;t him off. For my Part, I had my own Rea&s;ons, for not making any Encomiums upon his Performances, though at the &s;ame Time
<PB N="2" REF="007457_0003_102D92C9DEB1BE08">
I could not help admiring them, which, I think, in Point of ma&s;terly Writing, have not hitherto been equalled by any in the Province, if in the Land: I do therefore, &s;incerely acknowledge both the Delight and the Improvement I have received by them, and heartily wi&s;h he may again re&s;ume his Theme, where he broke it off. I have heretofore confe&s;&s;ed, that I thought him not &s;o independent in his &s;ecular Animad|ver&s;ions, as in his religious Rhap&s;odies, and am of Opinion, it is Pity, the Public &s;hould be de|prived of his Reflections, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome of them prove very unwarrantable in Point of <HI>real Religion:</HI> I &s;ay, real Religion; for as to the Arminion and Latitudinarian Scheme, it is &s;o notoriou&s;ly countenanced and preached up, even by &s;ome of the Clergy in this Land, that the <HI>Independent Reflector</HI> cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay wor&s;e; nor have I ever di&s;covered any Thing in him, more diametrically contrary to the Tenor of holy Scripture, and more directly re|pugnant to the Articles of the Church of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> than I have &s;ince found in the Writings of &s;ome Clergymen in our Parts of the World; wherefore, as the Fear of his broaching fal&s;e Doctrine and Here&s;y, was the chief Rea&s;on, which con&s;trained me to attack the <HI>Reflector,</HI> and as he has now been &s;ilenced almo&s;t a Year, I could wi&s;h he would begin again: I remem|ber to have heard when I was in <HI>Holland,</HI> that
<PB N="3" REF="007457_0004_102D92CD4CC7D1F0">
when a Mini&s;ter of our Church, publickly teacheth any erroneous Doctrine, the Cla&s;&s;is to which he belongs, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Synod, behave to|wards him in this Manner: They fir&s;t &s;ilence him, for the Space of &s;ix Weeks, then permit him to preach again; if he de&s;i&s;t from his Error, all is well; but if he &s;till per&s;i&s;t therein, he is &s;ilenced for a longer Time; and at length, after much Admonition, in vain, is depo&s;ed, when he is judged quite incorrigible. Ain't it then too hard, that the <HI>Reflector</HI> &s;hould be at once &s;ilenced and depo&s;ed for ever? 'Tis true, he is no Clergyman; what then? We know very well, the old Engli&s;h Law, relating the Benefit of the Clergy, was of &s;uch va&s;t Cir|cumference, that it included all tho&s;e who could read Latin; <HI>Legit ut Clericus,</HI> &s;aid they; and it was enough: And I dare &s;ay of the <HI>Reflector, Scribit ut Clericus,</HI> which I am &s;ure is more; be&s;ides, who knows, but the <HI>Reflector</HI> may have &s;een his Errors, and may have heartily repented of them? Or if he has not as yet, who knows but he may in Time to come? Indeed, when I con&s;ider, what a Ble&s;&s;ing he might be to this Land, if he was really con|verted and become a new Creature of God, my Soul is in&s;pired with Tenderne&s;s towards him; and methinks, I &s;ee already by Antici|pation, him throwing away that arrogant and opprobrious Title of <HI>Independent;</HI> (for the Lord

knows, we are all poor dependent Creatures, did we but know it too!) contenting him&s;elf with commencing <HI>Reflector</HI> only, and be&s;ides his Reflections on &s;ecular Affairs, pleading the Nece&s;&s;ity of Regeneration, Conver&s;ion and Holine&s;s of Life, in order to obtain eternal Salvation. Oh! if this &s;hould happen, me|thinks we would be ble&s;&s;ed with a <HI>Watts,</HI> a <HI>Doddridge,</HI> or a <HI>Hervey</HI> in our Land; nay, &s;o &s;anguine are my Hopes, that I even flatter my&s;elf, he would yet perhaps, enter into Holy Orders, and combat the Empire of <HI>Chaos,</HI> and ancient Night, from the Pulpit. I do then heartily wi&s;h, he may begin again, to &s;et about his Reflections, after this Year's Meditation and Pau&s;e; but with this Provi&s;o, that the Pre&s;s be free and open to all tho&s;e who think they di&s;cover any Errors and Here&s;ies in his Lucubrations, and that the Clergy e&s;pecially, who are the Watchmen on the Walls of <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI> keep a good Look-out, and have a watchful Eye over him.</P>
<P>And while I am on this Head, I cannot for|bear putting my Reverend Brethren, in mind of their Duty, to watch over one another al&s;o. Our Land is at pre&s;ent, in a critical Con|juncture; we are preparing to re&s;i&s;t and repel our incroaching Neighbours; we are about erecting a College for the Education of Youth; the Doctrines that are taught among us, will
<PB N="5" REF="007457_0006_102D92D0CB9B7368">
have a near Connexion with the good or bad Succe&s;s of both tho&s;e important Enterpri&s;es. I &s;incerely thank the <HI>Reflector,</HI> that he hath been &s;o watchful over the Public, as to point out in his Preface, &s;ome of the enormous Doctrines, that have been taught by Clergymen at h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">e; and I mo&s;t earne&s;tly entreat him, when he begins again, to be &s;o good as to put up on that Score one lately come abroad in our Land, of which we may &s;ay, <HI>there is no Smith in</HI> I&s;rael; and it is this: <Q>As for you, who are yet under the Direction of others, if you behave &s;o as to merit the E&s;teem of your Parents, In&s;tructors, and good Men, that you are conver&s;ant with, you need not doubt of meriting al&s;o the love of God in Chri&s;t. Thus, however early your Summons from Life maybe, you &s;hall neither fall unprepared nor unlamented. If un&s;ullied Innocence and Purity of Manners, be the Means of Happine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>This Doctrine I take to be &s;uch, that the bare Reading of it, mu&s;t give &s;ome Shock to a pious Mind; wherefore, I am of Opinion it may met with a Reprehen&s;ion, from the right Reverend Father in God the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London;</HI> for I am certain it has a wor&s;e Tendency, than the ranke&s;t Enthu&s;ia&s;m, which is &s;o often checked from that venerable See. Notwith|&s;tanding, in the mean while, as the Word of
<PB N="6" REF="007457_0007_102D92D285A86CE0">
God is the Standard, by which we are to judge concerning tho&s;e Things, which lead to our eternal Peace, it may not be ami&s;s to open and unfold it a little, and then to compare it to holy Scripture, and to the Articles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that the Contra&s;t may appear.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ons here &s;poken of, or &s;poken unto, are tho&s;e who are yet under the Direction of others, that is, the Youth in the Academy, and a Suppo&s;ition is made, if they behave &s;o as to merit the E&s;teem of their Parents, In|&s;tructors, and good Men they are conver&s;ant with, (which I think no one will deny, or can deny, they may do; nay, they hardly behave &s;o ill as to forfeit the E&s;teem of their Parents, In&s;tructors, and good Men they are conver&s;ant with; for, who can forbear e&s;teeming them, if they are not guilty of any gro&s;s Immorali|ties?) and upon this Suppo&s;ition, upon this Condition, and upon the&s;e Terms, they need not doubt of meriting al&s;o the Love of God in Chri&s;t; and that in &s;uch a Manner, as however early their Summons from Life may be, they &s;hall not fall unprepared. Was there any &s;uch Thing (as there is not) of merting the Love of God in Chri&s;t, I believe the behaving &s;o as to merit the E&s;teem of our Parents, In&s;tructors, and good Men we are conver&s;ant with, would come very far &s;hort of it, and to expect to Merit the love of God in Chri&s;t, at this rate,
<PB N="7" REF="007457_0008_102D92D483421F28">
would be Sacrilegiou&s;ly depreciating the &s;ame. But come on; let us look into our Bibles, and if I mi&s;take not, we &s;hall find, beyond all Doubt, there is no &s;uch Thing as meriting the Love of God in Chri&s;t. We read, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> lxvi. 6. <HI>But we are all as an unclean Thing, and all our Righteou&s;ne&s;s are as filthy Rags, and we all do fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities, like the Wind, have taken us away.</HI> We al&s;o read, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxiii. 6. <HI>In his Days</HI> (that is, in the Days of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah) Judah &s;hall be &s;aved, and I&s;rael &s;hall dwell &s;afely: And this is his Name whereby he &s;hall be called, the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And, <HI>Luke</HI> xvii. 10. <HI>So likewi&s;e ye, when ye &s;hall have done all tho&s;e Things which are commanded you, &s;ay, We are unprofitable Servants: We have done that which was our Duty to do.</HI> And e&s;pe|cially, <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 8, 9. <HI>For by Grace ye are &s;aved, through Faith, and that not of your&s;elves: It is the Gift of God:</HI> Not of Works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould boa&s;t. For my Part, I cannot &s;ee how the Doctrine afore&s;aid, can be ever reconciled to this Doctrine of holy Scripture, or be rendered compatible therewith; they appear to me dia|metrically oppo&s;ite, and ever&s;ive of one another.</P>
<P>Let us next &s;ee, what Account we &s;hall find about the Doctrine, in the Articles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which are very &s;criptural. The XI. Article contains the&s;e Words: <Q>We are accounted righteous before God, only for the
<PB N="8" REF="007457_0009_102D92D7AAE9DED0">
Merit of our Lord and Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> by Faith, and not for our own Works, or De&s;ervings. Wherefore, that we are ju&s;tified by Faith only, is a mo&s;t whol&s;ome Doctrine, and very full of Comfort, as more largely is expre&s;&s;ed in the homily Ju&s;tification.</Q> The XIIIth Article is thus: <Q>Works done before the Grace of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the In&s;piration of his Spirit, are not plea&s;ant to God, fora&s;|much as they &s;pring not of Faith in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> neither do they make Men mute to receive Grace, or (as the School Authors &s;ay) de&s;erve Grace of Congruity; yea, rather for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin.</Q></P>
<P>Now behold how the Doctrine afore&s;aid, agrees with the Doctrine of the Church! the one &s;aith, (if you behave &s;o as to merit the E&s;teem of you Parents, In&s;tructors, and good Men that you are conver&s;ant with,) you need not doubt of meriting al&s;o the Love of God in Chri&s;t; the other &s;aith, we are accounted righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> by Faith, and not for our own Works or De&s;ervings. The modern Doc|trine teacheth, as for you, who are yet under the Direction of others, if you behave &s;o as to merit the E&s;teem of your Parents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> you need not doubt of meriting al&s;o the Love of
<PB N="9" REF="007457_0010_102D92D9366848A0">
God in Chri&s;t. The Church teacheth, Works done before the Grace of <HI>Chri&s;t&punc;</HI> and the In|&s;piration of his Spirit, are not plea&s;ant to God, fora&s;much as they &s;pring not of Faith in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;o forth, as in the Article is ex|pre&s;&s;ed; and &s;urely, I think it can't be believed, that all tho&s;e who being yet under the Direction of others, behave &s;o as to merit the E&s;teem of their Parents, In&s;tructors, and good Men they are conver&s;ant with, have received the Grace of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the In&s;piration of his Spirit: Con&s;equently &s;ome are &s;o far from meriting the Love of God in Chri&s;t, that they are by meriting the E&s;teem of Men, not &s;o much as rendered mute to receive Grace, or de&s;erve Grace of Con|gruity, but their be&s;t Works have the Nature of Sin: Which of the&s;e two widely different Doc|trines are we then to believe? It is po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould behave, and that without doubt, a Doc|rine &s;et up in manife&s;t Contradiction again&s;t the Oracles of &s;acred and unerring Truth, and again&s;t the Articles of the Church? For my Part, I am &s;o far from believing that up&s;tart Doctrine, that I doubt not in the lea&s;t but it is fal&s;e, and be&s;ides Soul de&s;tructive to tho&s;e who are &s;o unhappy as to believe it: And as &s;uch I complain of it; I remon&s;trate, I prote&s;t again&s;t it, before God and all his Saints.</P>
<P>O! it grieves me to the Heart, to &s;ee a Clergyman of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> run &s;o
<PB N="10" REF="007457_0011_102D92DB251CAFC8">
directly counter to holy Scripture, and to the Articles of his own Church, which he hath &s;ub&s;cribed, if not &s;worn to: What mu&s;t the World think of it? How many de&s;pi&s;e all Religion for it, and think it is all a Sham, a Farce? Pious and well grounded Minds, who have Truth inwardly, and are inbued with &s;alutary Principles of Religion, will con&s;ider that there mu&s;t be Offences given, on the one Hand, that the faithful be made manife&s;t; and on the other, that there be Stumbling Blocks for tho&s;e who walk not Upright; but Woe to them by whom they are given! I am not bigotted to the Articles of any Church upon Earth, &s;o as not to recede from them, if I could di&s;cover them, to be fal&s;e. But holy Scripture, the Nature and Fitne&s;s of Things, and the Dictates of my own Con&s;cience, a&s;&s;ure me, the Love of God, in Chri&s;t, is free, unde&s;erved, and un|merited; and from the contrary Doctrine, Good Lord deliver us!</P>
