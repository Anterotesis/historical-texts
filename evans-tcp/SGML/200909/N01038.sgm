<P>We have had <HI>G. Fox's</HI> Will &s;everal times printed, (both in <HI>England</HI> and here in <HI>America</HI>) as it lies to be &s;een in the Prerogative Office in <HI>London,</HI> wherein there is &s;carce two Lines good Sence or Engli&s;h; and the&s;e two Letters are a Confir|mation of his Learning; for by the fir&s;t, we &s;ee, he could not write the date of the Year or &s;pell his own Name right; how then was he capable to write a Book, notwith&s;tanding the many Books the <HI>Quakers</HI> have &s;o impudently publi&s;hed in his Name, e&s;pecially his Journal, craftily dre&s;t up by their chief Wits, that People in after Times might not &s;u&s;pect the <HI>Quakers</HI> great Apo&s;tle to be &s;uch a Buzard as he was. But this is <HI>Quaker</HI> Plainne&s;s and Sin|cerity.</P>
<P>His Book, called, <HI>A Primmer for all the Doctors and Schollars, &amp;c.</HI> of 2434 Queries, wherein he is &s;et up as Head and Tutor to all <HI>Europe,</HI> that the World might think him to be a Learned Per&s;on: This al&s;o is <HI>Quaker</HI> Plainne&s;s and Sincerity.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, his Book called, <HI>A Battledoor,</HI> of the Interpretation of 20 or 30 Languages, when he under&s;tood not one of them, by
<PB N="6" REF="001235_0005_0FB182E7E5FE8060">which the poor deluded <HI>Quakers</HI> were made to believe that <HI>G. Fox</HI> had the Gift of Tongues by In&s;piration, as the Apo&s;tles had at Pentico&s;t. But this is proved a Cheat; for it is di&s;covered that the <HI>Quakers</HI> hired certain learned Men to do it for them: They gave one <HI>Jew</HI> Thirty Pounds to do the greate&s;t part of it, and <HI>G. Fox</HI> only put his Name to it, as the Author, to deceive. This is al&s;o <HI>Quaker</HI> Sincerity. Yet the pre&s;ent Followers of the <HI>Quakers</HI> will not believe this; &s;o &s;trong is the Spirit of Delu&s;ion, when once it has &s;eized the Soul.</P>
<P>Yet by the Mercy of God, &s;ome who have not &s;hut their Eyes &s;o hard, have di&s;covered the <HI>Quakers,</HI> e&s;pecially by &s;eeing what a wicked cour&s;e this <HI>Fox</HI> took to an&s;wer his Opponents Books, <HI>viz.</HI> by picking 10, 12 or 14 words out of a Sentence of 20 or 30 words, and tran&s;po&s;ing them, and placing them &s;o as to turn their &s;ound and Chri&s;tian Sayings into Here&s;ie &amp; Non-&s;ence, and then an&s;wer them as their Sayings. Nay, &s;ometimes he would charge his Op|ponent with the <HI>Qrs.</HI> Here&s;ie or Error he was writing again&s;t. And the <HI>Qrs.</HI> knowing their own Guiltine&s;s in this ca&s;e, would hide it by charging their Oppo&s;ers with the &s;ame ba&s;e Method of an&s;wer|ing their Books. But this they charge without Proof, only to amu&s;e. I &s;ay, &s;ome &s;eeing the&s;e ways of <HI>Fox,</HI> are convinced that he was an In&s;trument of Satan, and not of God, and &s;hewed them by what Power and Spirit he took upon him to throw a&s;ide Chri&s;ts Ordinances, and in&s;tead thereof &s;et up his Womani&s;h Inventions of Female Prelates, and his honourable Courts of Women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed, his Denyal of the Ordinances of BAPTISM and the SUPPER of our LORD, and counting them as Humane Inventions, Carnal and Devili&s;h, is alone &s;ufficient to prove to all who are not bewitched with the &s;ame Spirit, that he was a Mini&s;ter of <HI>Anti-chri&s;t.</HI> And becau&s;e all Chri&s;tians from the Apo&s;tles to his Time had continued in the Practice of the&s;e Ordi|nances, he had no way to confirm his Followers in a Belief that he had Power to put an end to them, but by declaring him&s;elf to be EQUAL WITH GOD, and &s;et up for a Worker of Miracles, by the &s;ame Authority as Chri&s;t did; for you &s;hall find in his Journal, in the third Table, his vile and &s;en&s;le&s;s Miracles are &s;aid to be done by the Power of God, Not in the Name of JESUS, as the Apo&s;tles wrought Miracles, but in his own Name, by the
<PB N="7" REF="001235_0006_0FB182E9B7579A40">Power of God, To whom, (he bla&s;phemou&s;ly &s;aid) <HI>He was Equal,</HI> as his Books te&s;tifie. And upon this account the <HI>Quakers</HI> Idolize their great Apo&s;tle <HI>FOX,</HI> and his Inventions &s;et up in&s;tead of Chri&s;ts Ordinances, as the <HI>Turks</HI> Idolize their Prophet <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s And were the <HI>Quakers</HI> but in Power, and half &s;o Numerous as the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee they would as little bear to hear their <HI>FOX</HI> &s;poken again&s;t, as they their <HI>Mahomet.</HI> And unle&s;s, it plea&s;e God to contiue Watch-men upon the Walls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> this De|lu&s;ion may prove as dangerous as that of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> becau&s;e it carries with it a Pretence of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> under the Gui&s;e of an out|&s;ide Righteou&s;ne&s;s; <HI>Mini&s;ters of Satan</HI> (&s;aith St. <HI>Paul</HI>) <HI>Transform|ing them&s;elves as Mini&s;ters of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, who&s;e End &s;hall be accor|ding to their Works,</HI> 2 Cor. 11.15.</P>
<P>And to &s;peak it with Commi&s;&s;eration; Have we not &s;een this to be the Self Righteous end of the <HI>Quakers?</HI> for never any right <HI>Quaker</HI> has been known to dye with a <HI>Lord have mercy upon him</HI> in his Mouth!</P>
<P>For their Foundation Principle being the &s;ame with the <HI>Heathen Dei&s;ts,</HI> as they Live, &s;o they dye in the Mode mo&s;t in voge among the <HI>Dei&s;ts, viz.</HI> Hard without any &s;ence of Chri&s;t or of revealed Religion, tru&s;ting only to what is within them, the which, one calls Light, the other <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and in which both <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> do magnifie them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e <HI>W. Penn</HI> extols this <HI>Fox</HI> in the Preface to his Journal, for his wonderful depth in Divinity and his extraordinary Gift in opening Scripture, and would go to the Marrow of things. Therefore take two or three proofs as follow.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In his Book of Di&s;tinction between the Two Suppers, p. 21. he quotes 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 17.18. <HI>But</HI> Hymen<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">us and Philetus [&s;ays he] <HI>concerning the truth erred, who &s;aid the Re&s;urrection was pa&s;t already, &s;uch overthrew People from the Faith that &s;tands in Chri&s;t, who is the Re&s;urrection and the Life, through which Faith they attained to the Re&s;urrection, and had their vile Bodyes changed, and made like unto his Glorious Body.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> How he preverts the Scripture both in words and &s;ence, to defend their Here&s;ie, denying the Re&s;urrection of the Body after Death; for the words of Scripture, <HI>Who &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our vile Bodyes,</HI> Re&s;pect the time to come at the Re&s;urrection of the dead, but <HI>Fox</HI> will have it that they have <HI>Already</HI> attained the Re&s;urrection,
<PB N="8" REF="001235_0007_0FB182EAE3BDBFF0">and had their vile bodies changed. Al&s;o, he makes the Re&s;urrection that <HI>Paul</HI> Preached, <HI>Acts</HI> 17.19, 22. and 23.6. to be Chri&s;t him&s;elf, perverting our Saviours words, who called him&s;elf the Re&s;urrection and the Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> litteral &s;ence, which is plain [to all intelligent per&s;ons] contains a figurative &s;ence, to wit, the Author and Cau&s;e of the Re&s;urrection; As when God is called in Scripture the Saints Hope, Confidence and Salvation, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Author and Cau&s;e of their Hope, Confidence and Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> In his Book, called, <HI>Truths Defence</HI> p. 49, 50. in an&s;wer to his opponent, he quotes 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.29. and &s;ays, <HI>The Mini&s;ters of God they &s;pake to the Spirits in Pri&s;on, and the Pri&s;oner &s;hall come out of Pri&s;on. The Son of Perdition is above all that is called God in thee &mdash; Thou art one that keeps the Light in Pri&s;on in thee.</HI> [And in an&s;wer to the Que&s;tion, Whether the Devil is &s;tronger then Chri&s;t, the Fle&s;h than the Spirit; or, Whether do&s;t thou find he was ever a Pri&s;o|ner in Satans Chains? <HI>Fox</HI> an&s;wers, <HI>We witne&s;s he was in Satans Chains, and is in thee, el&s;e how could they crucify him afre&s;h?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> At what a &s;en&s;le&s;s rate he here perverts the Scripture, and all to prove his Bla&s;phemy, <HI>viz.</HI> to prove that God is impri&s;oned, and in Bondage in Wicked Men, bound in Satans Chains in men: For the Spirits in Pri&s;on, whereof <HI>Peter</HI> writes in that place, were &s;ometimes di&s;obedient in the days of <HI>Noah,</HI> as the following words expre&s;ly declare. But how could Chri&s;t in them be di&s;obedient, and not only Spirits, but di&s;obedient Spirits? Are not the&s;e Rare in&s;tances of <HI>Fox</HI> his wonderful Depth and extraordinary Gift of Opening Scripture, and going to the Marrow of things, as <HI>W. Penn</HI> by his wit has there Romanced? I could give many the like In&s;tan|ces to prove that his under&s;tanding in Divinity was equal to that of his Schollar&s;hip afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>But to be &s;hort; I &s;hall leave his Books, which have all pa&s;&s;ed through the <HI>Index ex Purgitor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">es</HI> of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> before they were publi&s;hed, and will conclude with a pa&s;&s;age taken from his Mouth, which is a more perfect Proof of his Parts and Learning, being a &s;hort Di&s;pute which he maintained again&s;t <HI>T.

<P><HI>OB&s;erve, Reader:</HI> He that engages to Defend to the utmo&s;t of his Power, according to the common &s;en&s;e of the words, He does Engage to do it both in Per&s;on and E&s;tate, [if he has it] for &s;o all the World under&s;tands the words [Defend to the Utmo&s;t of Our Power] I &s;ay this is the common &s;en&s;e of the words, let the <HI>Quakers</HI> deny it if they can or dare.</P>
<P>And you &s;ee above, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> have ingaged to Defend to the Utmo&s;t of their Power, according to the common &s;en&s;e of the words; Therefore they have engaged to do it in Per&s;on and E&s;tate, as their Ability, and Occa&s;ion is. And yet almo&s;t in the next breath, they declare they cannot do it in Per&s;on. Can &s;uch Equivocators as the&s;e be fit Per&s;ons to be tru&s;ted in the Goverment?</P>
<P>But will they Defend with their E&s;tates? Will they pay to main|tain War or Fighting? Have they no mental Eva&s;ion or &s;ecret Re|&s;ervation in this? for we &s;ee (as above) that they have &s;olemnly declared, they have none: Yes indeed, they have; for &s;ince the year 1660 'tis known to be the <HI>Quakers</HI> avowed Principle to deny to pay, and cannot pay &s;o much as one penny to maintain War or Fighting. And this <HI>Samuell Jenings</HI> a&s;&s;erted before my Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> at the Council Table at <HI>Amboy,</HI> the whole A&s;&s;embly being pre&s;ent, <HI>viz. That they could no more pay towards War or Fighting, than they could Fight or bear Arms.</HI></P>
<P>Behold here! The <HI>Quakers</HI> have fir&s;t engaged to defend the <HI>Queen,</HI> &amp;c. to the utmo&s;t of their Power, and that as Defence is commonly under&s;tood, without Eva&s;ion or Re&s;ervation what&s;o|ever, and yet at the &s;ame time declare their Intentions are, Not to do it neither in Per&s;on nor E&s;tate: This is &s;uch an Equivocating Contradiction, as is not [I believe] to be parallelled in the whole

Pu&s;ey,</HI> tell us in his next Print, how and which way they can defend the <HI>Queen,</HI> &amp;c. to the Utmo&s;t of their Power, and yet neither do it in Per&s;on nor E&s;tate, and that too, as [Defend] is commonly under&s;tood; if he can do this, and clear his Brethern from the Guilt of Perjury, I will then be engaged he &s;hall be &s;et in the Legend for a Worker of Miracles along with the great <HI>Fox,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Saints both of <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New-Rome;</HI> Mean time, let the World Judge of this peice of <HI>Quaker</HI>-Sincerity.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t do <HI>S. Jenings</HI> Ju&s;tice in this ca&s;e, for he al&s;o &s;aid, that they did not expect to be gainers by refu&s;ing to pay; meaning (I &s;uppo&s;e) that their Goods might be taken from them. But this is what they have always called Per&s;ecution; therefore this makes the matter wor&s;e; for here the <HI>Queen</HI> and tho&s;e in Authority un|der her are rendered Per&s;ecutors, and by the <HI>Quaker</HI>-Chronicles pa&s;s for &s;uch in the next Age. Now this is at lea&s;t a pa&s;&s;ive Di&s;obe|dience to the Law; and is not their defending in any re&s;pect, much le&s;s a doing it to the Utmo&s;t of their Power, heartily and willingly declared?</P>
<P>I &s;ay again, What Government can be &s;afe in tru&s;ting to &s;uch a Quick-Silver Tribe of men, whom no words will tye, though never &s;o expre&s;ly &s;poken? And they are the &s;ame in mo&s;t other matters. As in Swearing, they cannot in Con&s;cience Swear, but they can take an Oath, and their Con&s;cience in this Country is tayled to their Brethrens Con&s;cience in <HI>England;</HI> for the Magi&s;trates here could not per&s;wade their Con&s;cience, [for &s;ome time] to take their own New Oath, till they heard that their Brethren took it in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But now, Suppo&s;e the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould be&s;et us: The <HI>Quakers</HI> count them&s;elves no way engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in defence of out <HI>Queen</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> Therefore they are free, (if any tempting occa&s;ion offer) to Joyn with the <HI>French</HI> again&s;t us. For, as to their Saying, they cannot for Con&s;cience &s;ake bear Arms to Fight, or [as they word it] u&s;e Force and Arms; this is Deceipt and a Lye, as I could in&s;tance in &s;everal matters of fact: One pregnant Proof of this has happened &s;o lately as the la&s;t <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in the County of <HI>Burlington,</HI> wher a report was, that a part of <HI>French</HI> were Lucking

<P>Now let not <HI>C.

<HEAD>Po&s;t-&s;cript.</HEAD>
<P>SInce the fore-going was written, I met with the <HI>Quaker</HI>-Alma|nack, put out by <HI>J. T.</HI> and <HI>C. P.</HI> for this year 1705. 'Tis a Two-handed Piece, wherein they wou'd make their Readers think, that they have Conquor'd me on both &s;ides. One will have me to be a meer Ignoramus in Art, and 'tother a Renogado in Religion, and con&s;equently it mu&s;t be as they &s;ay, That I am not fit for <HI>Religious</HI> nor <HI>Civil Society.</HI> High Charges! But if this be the wor&s;t they can do to me, I think my &s;elf the more happy in that they have &s;aid as bad of &s;ome of the be&s;t Men of our Age.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="001235_0013_0FB182F585C441E0"><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to <HI>J. T</HI>'s Vapours again&s;t me, if it would edifie, or be of advantage to Mankind, I would Confute him; for 'tis &s;ome Errors of the Pre&s;s which he harps mo&s;t upon, and would make to be mine; nay, and he rakes them out of old Almanacks too; whenas he knows I could &s;everely la&s;h him with the &s;ame Whip from all his (calculated) Almanacks, and his Book too; but I have now other Fi&s;h to fry. His grudging me the u&s;e of his Book, is like &s;elling me Roa&s;t-Meat, and then beating me with the Spit, but what le&s;s can I expect from a <HI>Quaker? Gad|bury</HI> would have &s;corn'd to have done &s;o by him, for copying after his Ephemerides &s;everal years in his Book. But in &s;hort, he is wellcome to me to go on with his Yearly Calculations; he has, (it may be) more lea&s;ure than I; and I &s;hall make a &s;hift to write an Almanack, (perhaps as true as his) either with his help or without it: And let him not be grieved that my Almanack &s;ells better than his.</P>
<P>And as to <HI>C. Pu&s;ey</HI>'s Reply to my Almanack, he has not an&s;wer'd one quarter part of it, but runs upon other matters, to bring his Reader off from the Scent of their Here&s;ies: In his An&s;wers he copies after the <HI>London-Quakers</HI> An&s;wers, and dares venture no further than they have done to his hands. As to other things he &s;ees it his &s;afe&s;t way to tell me, <HI>He has not &s;een the Books out which I brought my Quotations;</HI> and that he thinks is &s;ufficient to Refute me; or el&s;e he tells me, <HI>G. K</HI>'s <HI>Quaker</HI>-Books &s;ay &s;o and &s;o. But this is hard patching up Religion, when one <HI>Quaker</HI>-Book mu&s;t be brought to mend or ju&s;tifie another. And as to the <HI>London-Quakers,</HI> alas! They are baffled in their An&s;wers, and Confounded to their perpetual Shame, by the Author of the Book, called, <HI>The Snake in the Gra&s;s,</HI> in his <HI>Defence</HI> and <HI>Reply,</HI> as all who read tho&s;e Books may &s;ee.</P>
<P>But has <HI>C. Pu&s;ey</HI> not one word to &s;ay to what I have charged of their Mon&s;trous Notions concerning <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> No. They &s;till &s;tand Guilty of the Charge often proved again&s;t them, <HI>viz. That when they &s;peak or write of the Chri&s;tians</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>they mean not a word of what they &s;ay;</HI> for they will not &s;ay, nor dare not confe&s;s, <HI>That they believe in a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> now in Heaven, and that Chri&s;t is now, and forever to come, truly
<PB N="15" REF="001235_0014_0FB182F6EADAF280">and really a Man, in true and proper Humane Nature, With|out all other men.</HI> No, They have been &s;everal Times pro|voked to give us a Proof of their Sincerity, in an&s;wering to this Chri&s;tian Confe&s;&s;ion, but they will not. And their refu&s;ing to confe&s;s to this, bewrays them, and di&s;covers the Cloven Foot to all Intelligent Chri&s;tians, and is another repeated Proof, <HI>That they Mean not a Word of what they &s;ay concerning Chri&s;t Without;</HI> and therefore are Implacable Enemies to the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>And whereas I noted in my Preface, That <HI>Peter Fretwell</HI> con|demned <HI>Eliz. Fenton</HI> for being baptized, and that therefore &s;he mu&s;t know a bitter Day of Repentance; and that <HI>Mary Wheat</HI> confirmed the &s;ame. Now if there be occa&s;ion <HI>Eliz. Fenton</HI> will make Oath to the Truth of this before a Magi&s;trate.</P>
<P>But behold what a &s;incere <HI>Quaker</HI>-Turn-off they have invented for this. Why, they &s;ay, <HI>It was for her evil Life and Conver|&s;ation that</HI> Fretwell <HI>&s;aid &s;he mu&s;t know a bitter Day of Repentance for, and not for being Baptized.</HI> But do they tell what this Evil was that &s;he was guilty of? No, No; have a care of that; you &s;hall not catch them there; for it was pa&s;t their skill to tell that: They know that none of her Neighbours can charge her with &s;o much as a Spot in her Life and Cover&s;ation, tho&s;e many years that &s;he has lived both a Wife and a Widdow among them: If they could, no doubt, we had had it in Print, now at this Pinch: Therefore let tho&s;e her Accu&s;ers think of what Reward they mu&s;t have for &s;uch &s;landerous Lyes again&s;t the Innocent.</P>
<P>But why wou'd the <HI>Quakers</HI> now deny their Banters again&s;t Bapti&s;m? Is it becau&s;e they begin to be a&s;hamed of them? Truly I &s;hould be glad to be an In&s;trument to bring them to that. No, but here is a <HI>Snake in the Gra&s;s,</HI> for they u&s;e their Arts of Confe&s;&s;ing and Denying (as occa&s;ion requires) only to avoid the Odium of the World; for be&s;ides their former Outrage again&s;t Bapti&s;m (which they &s;till ju&s;tifie) <HI>C. Pu&s;ey</HI> in pag. 3. (even while he would take his Friend <HI>Fretwell</HI> off from &s;peaking again&s;t Bapti&s;m) does him&s;elf bring a bantering Scoff again&s;t it, and fal&s;ifies <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Bucer</HI> by perverting their &s;ence to make them
<PB N="16" REF="001235_0015_0FB182F92B86BB10">&s;peak again&s;t it too. And all this he does under a deceitful pre|tence, That 'tis only <HI>Infant Bapti&s;m</HI> that the <HI>Quakers</HI> deny; whenas 'tis evident that both he and they &s;hoot their poy&s;oned Arrows again&s;t Bapti&s;m it Self. Their Practice proves this to all that know them, <HI>viz.</HI> That 'tis <HI>All manner of Water-Bapti&s;m</HI> which they deny: They Practi&s;e none.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>C. P.</HI> has the Impudence to deny [after his fa&s;hion] that <HI>W. Penn</HI> calls it <HI>Poy&s;on, to believe or have faith in the Hi&s;tory of Chri&s;ts outward Manife&s;tation.</HI> But what they expect to gain by this way of an&s;wering Books, I know not. But this I know, that &s;everal who were zealous <HI>Quakers</HI> have for&s;aken them for the &s;ake of this very Doctrine of <HI>William Penn</HI>'s, and that other, where he denys <HI>The Outward Per&s;on,</HI> JESUS, <HI>who was born of the Virgin, to be properly the Son of God.</HI> I &s;ay, the <HI>Quakers</HI> refu&s;ing to condemn the&s;e two Doctrines of <HI>W. P.</HI> has cau&s;ed many (and &s;ome very &s;en&s;ible Per&s;ons, as they know) to for&s;ake their Society, Thanks be to God for it. And as the Proverb &s;ays, <HI>'Tis an ill Wind that blows no body Good.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with one In&s;tance of what I noted before, that C. P. wou'd lead his Reader from the Scent of their Here&s;ies, by running from the Charge to other Matters&punc; You mu&s;t Note, that I had provoked him to &s;ay (if he dur&s;t) That they did the Scrip|tures that honour as they did their own Books, <HI>viz.</HI> as ever to read &s;o much as one Chapter of them in any of their Meetings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now <HI>C. Pu&s;ey</HI> knowing their own guiltine&s;s in the ca&s;e, in&s;tead of giving me a plain hone&s;t an&s;wer, he falls foul upon the Author of the <HI>Snake, &amp;c.</HI> and then brings Cirtificates to prove that their School-Boys read them in their Schools. But, Pray what is this to the purpo&s;e? Any body knows that the Bible is as nece&s;&s;ary a Book to learn Schollars to read in, as another Book. But this is not reading them in their Meetings, as they do their own Books and Epi&s;tles. This is one of Friend <HI>Caleb</HI>'s go-by's, and this is <HI>Quaker</HI>-plainne&s;s too, which he gives in&s;tead of an&s;wers to me.</P>
