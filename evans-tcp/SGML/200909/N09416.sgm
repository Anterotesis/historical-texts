<HEAD>The PREFACE <HI>To the</HI> READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>COURTEOUS READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Apologies of Authors for appearing in print, and their craving the Indulgence of the Candid Reader to the Imperfections of their Performances, are generally con&s;idered as meer Words of Cour&s;e. Therefore without the Vanity to imagine I have no Need, I &s;hall however omit troubling him with any &s;uch Application. Nor do I think it nece&s;&s;ary to take up his Time with the Rea&s;ons and Motives, which have induced me to this Publication. It is to be &s;uppos'd in a Judg|ment of Charity, that a Writer aims at the In&s;truc|tion and Good of Mankind (unle&s;s there appear &s;trong Rea&s;ons to the Contrary) and hopes his Per|formance is, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, calculated for that Purpo&s;e. The Subjects here touched at are, I have ob&s;erv'd, lately become Matters of much Controver&s;y; I have not been &s;o happy as to be fully &s;atisfied with the Publications I have &s;een on either Side: At lea&s;t as to the Manner of treating the&s;e Points, even by &s;uch as take the Side, I apprehend to be &s;ub&s;tantially the Truth. I thereupon determin'd to renew my Examination of Matters &s;o Important, and &s;o intere&s;ting in our Faith and Daily Practice; and in doing &s;o, I re&s;olv'd &s;imply to enquire, what appears, from the Word of God, to be the Truth on the&s;e Topicks; and as impartially as I could, examine the Weight of occurring Objections, without inter|meddling as a Party in the pre&s;ent di&s;putes. Thus I have laid none under a Nece&s;&s;ity, nor I hope provok'd any to commence a Controver&s;y with me. Angry Debate &s;eldom does the Ju&s;tice to Truth,
<PB N="4" REF="011997_0003_0F8920D655154EF0">
that may be expected from free di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Enquiry; and in Matters of Controver&s;y, Readers are gene|rally more curious to ob&s;erve which Combatant man|ages his Part with mo&s;t Ingenuity, or is likely to come off Conqueror, than to di&s;cover the real Truth. Many of my Friends will, probably, be &s;urpri&s;ed, to find I have changed my Sentiments with Re&s;pect to &s;ome Subjects of one of the Sacraments; for they know it was formerly my Opinion, that the Unre|generate ought not, by any Means, to adventure to the Lord's Table; tho' they ought to dedicate their Children to God in Bapti&s;m. But for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, I dur&s;t not be peremptory in that Matter; and upon a more exten&s;ive View of the Subject, I could not &s;ee, that the Arguments, upon which I founded my former Opinion, were conclu&s;ive, for Rea&s;ons which appear in my An&s;wers to Objections. Whether my Arguments for the Side I have taken &s;hall appear &s;ufficient, or not, I hope my Friends will not be &s;tum|bled, but will &s;ee at lea&s;t, &s;o much Appearance of Weight in them, as may &s;atisfy them, that I have changed upon Principle, and from a Conviction of Truth by what appears to me full Evidence. I hope, my Readers in general will endeavour to con&s;ider impartially the Point of Light, in which I have &s;et the&s;e intere&s;ting Subjects, and enter into the true Spirit and Strength of my Arguments, without Prejudice; and not content them&s;elves with throw|ing up a little Du&s;t, in Order to Support &s;trong Pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions at any Rate.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE NATURE, USES, and SUBJECTS of the SACRAMENTS of the NEW-TESTAMENT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT is di&s;puted by &s;ome, whether God ever enter'd into Covenant with Man; the Rea&s;on alledged again&s;t it is, that the Parties in a Covenant mu&s;t, at lea&s;t in Re&s;pect of the Matters contain'd therein, be upon equal Footing, and free from previous Obliga|tions. But, I think, this Conclu&s;ion is not founded in the Nature of Things, but too ra&s;hly drawn from the State of Matters among&s;t Men; which takes Place only in certain Ca&s;es, where human Laws have made Provi|&s;ion to that Purpo&s;e, in Order to prevent the Abu&s;e and Encroachments of Power. A Rea&s;on this, which can have no Place with Re&s;pect to the ble&s;&s;ed God. I &s;ee no Rea&s;on in the Nature of Things, why a Superior may not conde&s;cend to enter into Covenant with an Inferior for his Advantage and Benefit. Yea, &s;uch Tran&s;actions do take Place among Men in many In&s;tan|ces, as between Parents and Children, Princes and their Subjects; of this Nature are Charters, which are of Force only on their being accepted. Now &s;urely the great God, who can do no Wrong, nor ever abu&s;e his Power, may, if he plea&s;es, thus conde&s;cend. And I think, the In&s;titution of Sacramental Signs and Seals, puts it beyond Di&s;pute, that in Fact he has. By the&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="011997_0005_0F8920D7D4C1A4F8">
he ratifies and confirms a Right to Benefits confer'd by way of Promi&s;e, upon the Con&s;ent of Per&s;ons to certain Terms; which Con&s;ent is expre&s;s'd, and the Per&s;ons brought under &s;olemn Obligations, by partaking of them. Surely, this contains, not only the Sub&s;tance, but the Form of a Covenant.</P>
<P>In every Di&s;pen&s;ation, the ble&s;&s;ed God has confirmed his Covenant with Man in this Manner. By the Tree of Life, he confirmed the Promi&s;e of Life: And by the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, the Threat|ning of Death, in the Covenant of Works.&mdash;To this, upon it's Violation, &s;ucceeded the Covenant of Grace. This was confirm'd in the patriarchal Age (when God made a public Di&s;tinction between his Church and the World) by the Sign of Circumci&s;ion, a Seal of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith. Rom. 4.11. To which, the Pa&s;&s;over was added, upon Occa&s;ion of the I&s;raelites' Deliverance from Egyptian Bondage. The In&s;titution of a &s;econd Seal was re&s;erv'd until this Time, becau&s;e this Deliverance was &s;o eminently typical of the Re|demption of Sinners by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;Upon the Re|&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, when an entire Change of the whole external Admini&s;tration of that gracious Cove|nant took Place, Bapti&s;m was &s;ub&s;tituted in the Room of Circumci&s;ion, and the Lord's Supper in the Room of the Pa&s;&s;over, as Ordinances better &s;uited to this new Frame of Admini&s;tration. And as this is the la&s;t Di&s;|pen&s;ation of the Covenant of Grace, the&s;e are the la&s;t &s;acramental In&s;titutions, and none other are to be expected.</P>
<P>Seeing the&s;e &s;acred Ordinances, Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper, have &s;o clo&s;e and &s;olemn Connection with the Covenant of Grace, which is the Great Char|ter of all our &s;piritual Privileges and Mercies, it is of va&s;t Importance that they be rightly under&s;tood, in Order to a proper Attendance upon, and Improvement of them. With a View to a&s;&s;i&s;t the common Chri&s;tian in this, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;et before him, the Nature,
<PB N="7" REF="011997_0006_0F8920D8ECDB1BC8">
U&s;es, and Subjects of the&s;e Ordinances, as briefly as I can, in the few following Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Name, Sacrament, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, is not of divine Authority, but human Invention. It is deriv'd from the Latin Word, Sacramentum, which, among the Romans, &s;ignified the Oath, whereby their Soldiers &s;wore Fidelity to their General; and by Divines, applied to the&s;e &s;acred In&s;titutions, becau&s;e of the &s;olemn Obligations to the ble&s;&s;ed God, infered on tho&s;e who partake of them. But the principal U&s;e of Names, is to &s;ugge&s;t to the Mind, without tedious Circumlocutions, the Things to which they are given: And this Name, by common Con&s;ent, an&s;wers that End in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. There can, therefore, be no Danger from the U&s;e of it, while we give a &s;criptural View of the Things &s;ignifyed thereby. This is next to be attempted.</P>
<P N="2">II. A Sacrament is an holy Ordinance, in which, &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Thing, or Things are, by divine In&s;titu|tion, to be u&s;ed as a Sign and Seal of the Privileges, Mercies and Engagements, of the Covenant of Grace between God and his People.&mdash;A Sign is Something, which, by its Pre&s;ence or U&s;e, &s;ugge&s;ts or repre&s;ents &s;omething el&s;e to the Mind. This mu&s;t therefore, be &s;ome &s;en&s;ible vi&s;ible Thing. The Sign in a Sacrament is not a natural, but arbitrary Sign, it has no natural ne|ce&s;&s;ary Connection with the Thing &s;ignifyed; but its Connection is by In&s;titution for that Purpo&s;e.&mdash;Written Covenants among Men, are confirmed by adding a Bit of Wax impre&s;&s;ed with the Character of a Seal, which is, by a particular Action and expre&s;s Declaration, ac|knowledged, and is therefore called a Seal. When this is done, the Covenant cannot be revoked, but by the Con&s;ent and Deed of both Parties; without which, their Engagements to each other &s;tand good and in full Force. Now if any other Sign or Thing, attended with &s;ignificant Actions, be appointed for the &s;ame Pur|po&s;e,
<PB N="8" REF="011997_0007_0F8920D970403BE0">
it is called by the &s;ame Name. Thus the Ele|ments of Water in Bapti&s;m, and Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper, are call'd Seals, becau&s;e when u&s;ed according to their In&s;titution, they have the &s;ame Effica|cy with Re&s;pect to the Covenant of Grace, that there is in Seals, annex'd to written Covenants among Men.&mdash; Thus then &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Sign; it's Separation and Ap|pointment to it's proper Purpo&s;e; and in Con&s;equence thereof, it's Significancy and Efficacy as a Sign and Seal of the Covenant of Grace, all concur to the Con|&s;titution of a Sacrament. This is the View of the Mat|ter which the Scriptures give us. thus Gen. 17.10.11. <HI>This is my Covenant;&mdash;every Man-Child among you &s;hall be circumci&s;ed.&mdash;And it &s;hall be</HI> A TOKEN OF <HI>the Covenant betwixt you and me.</HI> It &s;hall be <HI>a Token or Sign:</HI> It &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t to your Minds the Nece&s;&s;ity of your being cut off from the old Stock, and engrafted into Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the living Vine; and that <HI>the Fore&s;kin of your Hearts,</HI> their natural Hardne&s;s and Stubbornne&s;s, <HI>mu&s;t be taken away, and be turned to the Lord.</HI> (&s;ee Jer. 4.4. Rom. 2.28, 29.) It is al&s;o a Sign or Token of the Exi&s;tence of the Covenant. The Tenor of the Covenant, was the Promi&s;es made to Abraham in v. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. &s;ee al&s;o Gal. 3.14,&mdash;16. Yet Circumci|&s;ion is call'd the Covenant v. 10. Which can only mean, that the Promi&s;es of the Covenant are confirm'd by it. Hence the Apo&s;tle u&s;es the Terms, Promi&s;es, and Covenant, promi&s;cuou&s;ly; and ob&s;erves, that the Covenant was confirm'd before, of God in Chri&s;t, viz, to Abraham by Circumci&s;ion. Gal. 3.17. And the Apo&s;tle calls <HI>it</HI> A SEAL <HI>of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith.</HI> Rom. 4.11.</P>
<P N="3">III. Bapti&s;m and the Lord's Supper agree in the general Nature of a Sacrament, as above de&s;cribed. Yet, they differ not only in the external Elements, (without which, they, cou'd not be two Sacraments) but in &s;undry other con&s;iderable Re&s;pects. As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="9" REF="011997_0008_0F8920DAFB7A9000">
Bapti&s;m is an initial common&s;trative<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A common&s;trative Sign, is that, which denotes the Pre|&s;ence of the Thing &s;ignified.</NOTE> Sign and Seal, which vi&s;ibly denotes the Exi&s;tence of God's Covenant between him and the baptized Party, and their Entrance into the School of Chri&s;t as his Di&s;ciples; and by which, their vi&s;ible Member&s;hip in the Church is publickly ra|tified. This Ratification of Member&s;hip in the Church of Chri&s;t as his vi&s;ible Di&s;ciples, is, in Scripture, attributed to this, and never to the other Sacrament. Thus <HI>Mat.</HI> xxviii. 19, 20. Go ye therefore, and teach, (<GAP DESC="foreign"> Di&s;cipline) all Nations; and then take Care of and treat them as Di&s;ciples, <GAP DESC="foreign"> teaching them to ob&s;erve all Things, what&s;oever I have commanded you; they are hereby bound and engaged to ob&s;erve and attend upon all Ordinances and Duties.</P>
<P>The Lord's Supper is a commemorative Sign, wherein Per&s;ons recollect and recognize their Engagements to be the Lords, previou&s;ly entered into in the initiating Sacra|ment of Bapti&s;m; and e&s;pecially commemorate, and im|prove the Sufferings and Death of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Per&s;ons Church-member&s;hip is pre-&s;uppo&s;ed in, and pre-requi&s;ite to their Acce&s;s to this Sacrament. Hence 2d, the Sacrament of Bapti&s;m is only once to be admini&s;tred to, and received by the &s;ame Subject. For, from what has been ob&s;erved, it appears, that by one Admini&s;tra|tion it obtains its whole Effect. Member&s;hip in the Church of Chri&s;t admits not of Degrees; a Per&s;on is either a Member or no Member of the Church; there is no Ground in Scripture or Rea&s;on for the Di&s;tinction of imperfect or perfect Members, Members in a pa&s;&s;ive and active State as different Sorts of Members, the &s;ame Member may have very different Degrees of Capacity for the Di&s;charge of the Duties and Enjoyment of the Privileges of a Member, but he is the &s;ame Member
<PB N="10" REF="011997_0009_0F8920DB92C11DF0">
&s;till. An Infant Member cannot exerci&s;e Knowledge, nor perform Duty, nor in Childhood can he perform Duties, which require Degrees of Knowledge above his Capacity; but yet &s;till he is truly a Member, training up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord. I would a&s;k what is done to per&s;ons in their pa&s;&s;ive State, viz. Infancy, when they are baptized. Are they not &s;eparated from the World, and dedicated to God as his peculiar Pro|perty? Are they not brought under the Bond of God's Covenant, and under the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel or means of Grace, as they become capable of In&s;truction? Are they not really bound, and that &s;o as, upon its being duly laid before them, their Con&s;ciences mu&s;t feel the Obligation, to cleave to God in Chri&s;t, to perform all Chri&s;tian Duties, and, among the re&s;t, to renew their Covenant Engagements at the Lord's Table. But do they, by approaching the Lord's Table, acquire a new State of Member-&s;hip? In what Scripture is that declared? I would further a&s;k, whether an adult Per&s;on, when bap|tized, is a perfect Member, or only imperfect, a Member in Embrio? If the latter, then, the Matter does not turn upon the Difference between the pa&s;&s;ive and active State, and &s;o that Di&s;tinction mu&s;t be given up; but the Im|perfection of his Member&s;hip mu&s;t ari&s;e from an in&s;uffi|ciency in the Sacrament of Bapti&s;m to ratify it, that is, it is not &s;ufficient to ratify what it is expre&s;ly appointed to ratify, Mat. xxviii. 19, which is ab&s;urd; but if the former, then there is perfect Member&s;hip by Bapti&s;m, previous to coming to the Lord's Table. Therefore al&s;o, Bapti&s;m &s;o confirms Church-member&s;hip to an Infant, as to maintain and make good his Title, as he arrives to Capacity of Enjoyment; for its Efficacy takes Place af|ter, as well as at the Time of Admini&s;tration, even thro' the whole Cour&s;e of Life. Thus, though a baptized Per|&s;on &s;hould not be regenerated and united to Chri&s;t by a &s;aving Faith until old Age; yet, thereupon, his Bapti&s;m, which he received in Infancy, &s;eals his ingrafting into
<PB N="11" REF="011997_0010_0F8920DD82ED4480">
Chri&s;t, and per&s;onal Intere&s;t in the Special Ble&s;&s;ings of the Covenant, otherwi&s;e, where is the great Advantage of Infant Bapti&s;m? Hence al&s;o, it appears how ground|le&s;s and unrea&s;onable the Di&s;tinction, which obtains in many Places, between the Church and the Congregation. By this means, the greater Part of wor&s;hipping Societies are excluded from the Care and Di&s;cipline of the Church, and yet are, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, treated as Members, in being admitted to dedicate their Children to God in Bapti&s;m; their is great Incon&s;i&s;tency in the&s;e Things. but to return. From the very Nature of a commemora|tive Sign, it is evident, it is de&s;igned to affect the Heart by frequently bringing to Remembrance the Things &s;ig|nified; therefore, mu&s;t be frequently u&s;ed for that Pur|po&s;e. Hence, as the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is &s;uch, therefore it mu&s;t be often celebrated by the &s;ame Per&s;ons. They are to <HI>eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord often.</HI> 1 Cor. xi. 26.</P>
<P N="3">III. The&s;e two Sacraments differ with Re&s;pect to &s;ome of their Subjects. Actual Exerci&s;e, and a competent Knowledge of the Nature of the Ordinance and Tran&s;|actions required, for which a proper Degree of natural Capacity is requi&s;ite, are indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to an At|tendance on the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. With|out this, it could not be to Per&s;ons what it is, viz. a com|memorative Sign, its Sub&s;erviency to its End, is from the Impre&s;&s;ion it is calculated to make on the Heart, in at|tending upon it; but as Circumci&s;ion of old, &s;o Bapti&s;m, which &s;ucceeds it now, is to be admini&s;tred to Infants, born of profe&s;&s;ing Parents.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Sacraments are public Signs and Seals of the Covenant of Grace, as tran&s;acted between the ble&s;&s;ed God and his Church as &s;uch. The Covenant of Grace, is the great and glorious Charter, by which Jehovah has erected and con&s;tituted his Church. She &s;tands re|lated to him, and intere&s;ted in him by Covenant, Ezek. xvi. 8. <HI>Now when I pa&s;&s;ed by thee, and looked upon thee, be|hold
<PB N="12" REF="011997_0011_0F8920DE59426E40">
thy Time was a Time of Love, and I &s;pread my Skirt over thee, and covered thy Nakedne&s;s: yea, I &s;ware unto thee, and thou become&s;t mine.</HI> Hence it is, that the Church is &s;o repeatedly con&s;idered in Scripture, as married to the Lord. It is a Marriage Covenant: This, I think, is the primary View of the Covenant of Grace, as thus repre|&s;ented and confirmed by Sign and Seal; and it compre|hends all the per&s;onal Intere&s;ts of Individuals, as Mem|bers of the Body of Chri&s;t, and belonging to that Society; in all God's Covenant-Tran&s;actions with Men; of which we have an Account in Scripture; the Per&s;ons, with whom he immediately tran&s;acted, are not to be con&s;ider|ed in a &s;trict or ab&s;tract per&s;onal Capacity, but as Mem|bers of Society, or as including the Church. Thus when the gracious God opened and e&s;tabli&s;hed his Covenant with our fir&s;t Parents after the Fall, [Gen. iii. 15,] they were then the Church of God, and the Stock from whence it was to be propagated. In the Covenant-tran&s;|action with Abraham, he is con&s;idered as the Father of many Nations. Gen. xvii. 5. The Church is &s;et up in his Hou&s;e, his Family, yea, the whole, both Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian Church are included. Rom. iv. 10, 11, 12, 13. Gal. iii. 14&mdash;16. None of the Promi&s;es of the Covenant are directed to any, who are out of the Church. All who are Aliens to the Commonwealth of I&s;rael, are Stangers to the Covenants of Promi&s;e. Eph. ii. 12. The Promi&s;es do, indeed, de&s;cribe particular Characters, and point out particular Conditions and Circum&s;tances of God's People, to which they are accommodated. Hence, each Per&s;ons of tho&s;e Characters, and in &s;uch Condition or Circum&s;tan|ces, may claim a per&s;onal Intere&s;t in &s;uch Promi&s;es. Yet, this is not by Virtue of any per&s;onal Direction of the Pro|mi&s;e; but he pleads it as comprehended in the Church, and belonging to the Character de&s;cribed. Yea, there are Promi&s;es, which cannot be claimed by the particular Per&s;ons who&s;e Character and Ca&s;e they point out; but can be pleaded only by the Church. Thus, Ezek. xxxvi.
<PB N="13" REF="011997_0012_0F8920DE976B6C20">
26, 27. <HI>A new Heart al&s;o will I give you, and a new Spi|rit al&s;o will I put within you, and I will take the &s;tony Heart out of your Fle&s;h, and I will give you an Heart of Fle&s;h, and I will put my Spirit within you; and cau&s;e you to walk in my Statutes.</HI> Here the Character pointed out is that of the ungenerate; but &s;urely, the Promi&s;e cannot be con|&s;idered as directed to that Character. For then, the ble&s;|&s;ed God would &s;tand engaged by Promi&s;e, to all of that Character, to give them regenerating Grace, and each one might claim it, as that which God could not refu&s;e con&s;i&s;tent with his faithfulne&s;s, or without denying him|&s;elf: but the Faith of the Church may re&s;t upon it, and &s;he may plead it as a Promi&s;e of God's Pre&s;ence in her with his own Ordinances, for the Purpo&s;e of regenerating Sinners: And in every In&s;tance of their Conver&s;ion, God is fulfilling that Promi&s;e to his Church. Sinners are, in|deed, hence encouraged to call to cry to God for Grace, and to attend upon the Means of Grace, but they can find no Claim upon it. Hence we may &s;ee, that to have Mat|ter of Encouragement, and to have a Ground of Confi|dence and Claim, are not the &s;ame Thing, as &s;ome &s;eem &s;trangely to imagine.</P>
<P>The Church of Chri&s;t is u&s;ually, and very properly di&s;tingui&s;hed into vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible. By the invi&s;ible Church is meant, the whole Number of true Believers wherever they are. All the&s;e are, by a vital Union with Chri&s;t by Faith, &s;avingly intere&s;ted in the Covenant of Grace; in God as their God, and in all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings. But their Con&s;ent to the Covenant, and their Relation to God thereby, is altogether invi&s;ible, and known only to God and their own Con&s;ciences. The&s;e are called a Church, becau&s;e they are Members of Chri&s;t by a com|mon Union with him, and &s;tand united with, and related to each other in one Body in a Church State, as they are included in the Catholic vi&s;ible Church.</P>
<P>The vi&s;ible Church con&s;i&s;ts of all tho&s;e, who by an ex|ternal Profe&s;&s;ion of the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, and

Subjection to the Laws and Ordinances of Chri&s;t, ap|pear as a Society &s;eparated from the World, and dedi|cated to God and his Service. In this View, in this im|perfect State, the Church comprehends Branches that are withered, as well as tho&s;e that bear Fruit. Now the Co|venant of Grace &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the ble&s;&s;ed God and the Church, as &s;uch a vi&s;ible Society<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In no other Way can we conceive the Covenant to &s;ub&s;i&s;t be|tween God and Believers as a Church. In the Exerci&s;e of Faith, Believers have Union to, and Communion with Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but by this alone, they could have no Fellow&s;hip with one another; for each one could only be con&s;cious of his own Exerci&s;e of Faith, and could have no Society with any other therein. Whatever real Relation to each other is founded in their common Union to Chri&s;t, yet they could not at all perceive it. They would be Members of Chri&s;t, but utterly detached from each other, and &s;o not former|ly a Body. It is only as incorporated in the vi&s;ible Church, that they are fitly placed in the Body, and can have any Knowledge one of another, and to have any Fellow&s;hip.</NOTE>, and is rendered vi&s;i|ble, by a vi&s;ible Tran&s;action and external Admini&s;tration in various Ordinances; and comprehends &s;undry exter|nal Privileges for the Advantage and &s;piritual Edificati|on of the Church.</P>
<P>Here are not two Covenants, one for the invi&s;ible Church, and another for the vi&s;ible; for the&s;e are not two Churches, but a twofold Con&s;ideration of the &s;ame Church, though undoubtedly con&s;idered as vi&s;ible; &s;he includes more Members, than con&s;idered as individuals.&mdash; The vi&s;ible Church includes the invi&s;ible. Wherever there is a true vi&s;ible Church, there are, no doubt, a Number of true Saints; from the&s;e as the better Part, the vi&s;ible Church is denominated; by their Faith, the Church lays hold on the Covenant, and her Covenant-Relation to God is maintained, and all vi&s;ible Believers &s;hare in her external Privileges, whatever their real internal State be. Accordingly then one and the &s;ame Covenant, comprehends the whole Intere&s;ts of the Church
<PB N="15" REF="011997_0014_0F8920E012FA5660">
con&s;idered both as vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, with Re&s;pect to internal, &s;pecial, &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, and external Privi|leges. The great God &s;tands related to the invi&s;ible Church, by Virtue of this Covenant, as her God by Way of &s;pecial Intere&s;t in him, and by the &s;ame Cove|nant to the vi&s;ible Church, as vi&s;ibly her God and Lord.</P>
<P>It is the Covenant of Grace in this View, viz. as vi&s;ibly &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between God and his Church, con&s;idered as a vi&s;ible Society, a public Body &s;eparated and di&s;tingui&s;hed from the World, and dedicated to God, that the Sacra|ments are annexed as vi&s;ible Signs and Seals thereof. To this Purpo&s;e I would ob&s;erve, that when it plea&s;ed God fir&s;t to &s;et up his Church in Adam's Family, the Whole was included. As there were none from whom to &s;eparate and di&s;tingui&s;h his Church, the Lord &s;aw fit then to propo&s;e his Covenant more ob&s;curely, and de&s;igning that as a more imperfect Di&s;pen&s;ation, he only taught them by Sacrifices, thereby &s;hadowing forth the Redemption of Sinners by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. When Mankind greatly, though gradually degenerated, as he was not gathering his Church out of the World, but Men went out of the Church, he did not &s;till &s;ee fit to appoint any public Badge of Di&s;tinction; but upon a general Apo&s;ta|cy, he de&s;troyed the old World, and the Church con|tinued to exi&s;t in Noah's Family. Thus he was plea&s;ed, as it were to give a new Edition of his Church, and the whole World was again included in it. But when Man|kind had again generally revolted and turned a&s;ide to Idolatry, having promi&s;ed and confirmed it by his Bow in the Cloud, that he would no more de&s;troy the World; he &s;aw proper to call Abraham out from among&s;t his Kindred, and erect his Church in his Family. Here the ble&s;&s;ed God more fully opens his great Plan, more ex|plicitely propo&s;es his Covenant, and &s;olemnly tran&s;acts it with Abraham, not as a private Per&s;on, but as the Fa|ther of many Nations; compri&s;ing therein, not only his Family then in being, but both the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian

Church. It was proper, that a Matter of &s;o great and exten&s;ive Importance, &s;hould be tran&s;acted with peculiar Solemnity, and that there &s;hould be &s;ome public Badge of Di&s;tinction between the Church, thus &s;eparated to him, and the World. God was plea&s;ed, therefore, to ratify his Covenant, and publickly di&s;tingui&s;h his vi&s;ible Church, from the World, by the Sign of Circumci&s;ion, a Seal of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Faith. To di&s;tingui&s;h between the Church and the World, &s;eems to be one important De|&s;ign of the initiating Seal of the Covenant; becau&s;e in that, a Per&s;on's Member&s;hip in the Church is publickly declared and ratified. Commemorative Signs, &s;uch as the Pa&s;&s;over of the Lord's Supper, are de&s;igned to e&s;tabli&s;h, edify and quicken tho&s;e who are in the Church, rather than to di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e who are with|out. But the initiating Seal, as Circumci&s;ion or Bapti&s;m, though it has other Ends in Common with the other Sa|crament; yet is particularly de&s;igned as God's Mark &s;et upon Per&s;ons, to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the World, as his. Thus, though he had indulged the Frailties in the Omi&s;&s;ion of Circumci&s;ion, while travelling in the Wilder|ne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay indulged their Omi&s;&s;ion, not becau&s;e he had excommu|nicated them, for he had abundantly &s;hew'd his Care of, and Re|gard to the Congregation of I&s;rael as &s;till his People; and the&s;e who were uncircumci&s;ed, were not the Subject of the re&s;entful Sentence God had pronounced, but tho&s;e who fell in the Wilder|ne&s;s, upon whom it was fully executed.</NOTE>, partly becau&s;e of their continual journeying, and partly becau&s;e they were then entirely at a Di&s;tance from all other Nations; (otherwi&s;e he could have ordered them to delay their Journey for a Time, in Order, to perform it;) yet when they came over Jordan among the Canaan|ites, they mu&s;t not enter upon the War until they were circumci&s;ed; as al&s;o, in order to the Celebration of the Pa&s;&s;over. This Day, &s;ays the Lord, have I rolled away the Reproach of Egypt from off you, <HI>i. e.</HI> your being un|circumci&s;ed
<PB N="17" REF="011997_0016_0F8920E2A6E89628">
like the Egyptians from among&s;t whom ye came. Jo&s;h. v. 9.</P>
<P>Hence appears the great Impropriety of private Bap|ti&s;ms, unle&s;s where real Nece&s;&s;ity requires it. Seeing it is God's public Seal, it &s;hould be publicly applied; as it is a Sign and Seal of Member&s;hip in the vi&s;ible Church of Chri&s;t, it &s;hould be tran&s;acted in the Face of the Church.</P>
<P N="5">V. Sundry important U&s;es of the Sacraments have been already &s;ugge&s;ted in the foregoing Ob&s;ervations. Yet it may be proper here to recollect, and more ex|plicitly attend to them, together with &s;ome others not ex|pre&s;ly mentioned, that we may have them more fully be|fore us in one View. And</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. As Signs of the Covenant of Grace; they &s;erve in the fir&s;t Place, to give divine Truths a more ea&s;y Acce&s;s to the Mind, with more fixed Impre&s;&s;ion. Such is the &s;trange Connection between Soul and Body in the pre&s;ent State, that they mutually affect each other. Hence the Attention and Thoughts of the Mind are ex|cited to, and fixed upon Objects by the Exerci&s;e of the external Sen&s;es, and by this Means it is more deeply af|fected. Thus, in Bapti&s;m, by the wa&s;hing with Water, the Efficacy of which is to clean&s;e, we are led to con|template our Guilt and moral Pollution by Sin, the Ef|ficacy of the atoning Blood of Chri&s;t to remove Guilt, and of the Holy Spirit's Influences to purify the Heart; the Excellency, Freene&s;s and Abundance of the &s;piritual Ble&s;|&s;ings, &amp;c. The Elements of Bread broken and Wine, which was pre&s;&s;ed from the Grape in the Lord's Supper; &s;ugge&s;t to our Remembrance the painful Angui&s;h and violent Death of Chri&s;t, when his Body was broken on the Cro&s;s, and his precious Blood was &s;hed. 1 Cor. xi. 26. Bread, which is the Staff of Life, and Wine which chears the Heart, points out Chri&s;t as the Source of Life, Strength and Con&s;olation; and while many partake of the &s;ame Bread, and the &s;ame Cup, it denotes their
<PB N="18" REF="011997_0017_0F8920E350F29F80">
Communion with one another, as Members of the &s;ame Body of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Second. They &s;erve as vi&s;ible Signs of the Exi&s;tence of the Covenant of Grace between God and his People, and &s;o renders their Covenant Relation to God vi&s;ible. Yea, in the Participation of the Sacraments, the Cove|nant is vi&s;ibly tran&s;acted; con&s;enting to the Covenant, whereby Per&s;ons truly enter into it, is an internal Act of the Heart, invi&s;ible, and purely per&s;onal, in which there can be no &s;ocial Concurrence of the Church. It was, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary there &s;hould be &s;ome external So|lemnity, &s;ome vi&s;ible Tran&s;action, whereby it &s;hould be declared, rendered vi&s;ible, and wherein the Church can unite and have Fellow&s;hip. Thus God &s;ays of Circumci|&s;ion, <HI>it &s;hall be a Token of the Covenant betwixt me and you.</HI> Gen. xvii. 11. Therefore, 3dly, the&s;e Signs are public Badges of Di&s;tinction between the Church and the World. They are, as it were God's Mark, whereby he publickly challenges the Church as his, and Per&s;ons are vi&s;ibly &s;e|parated to his Service; and e&s;pecially, in the initiating Sacrament, one particular De&s;ign of which, is to &s;igni|fy and confirm our vi&s;ible Member&s;hip in the Church.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. As Seals confirming the Covenant of Grace, they primarily Seal the Truth and Certainty of Go&s;pel Pro|mi&s;es according to their true Tenor. They confirm the certain Connection by divine Con&s;titution, between Faith in Chri&s;t and the Pardon of Sin, and the Vouch&s;afement of all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings; and that in this Way, God will be his People's God, and not otherwi&s;e. 2d. They con|firm the Obligations of the Covenant upon all tho&s;e who partake of them. They are bound to cleave to the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, to give up their Hearts to God, and to &s;erve him in all holy Obedience; to ob&s;erve his Sta|tutes, and attend upon all his Ordinances. Mat. xxviii. 20. Hence the Offences and Di&s;obedience of vi&s;ible Church Members are peculiarly re&s;ented as a Breach of Covenant. Ho&s;. vi. 7, <HI>ad Fin.</HI> 3. When Per&s;ons do truly
<PB N="19" REF="011997_0018_0F8920E4E989D5B8">
con&s;ent to the Covenant by embracing Je&s;us Chri&s;t, then, and not otherwi&s;e, the Sacrament Seal, is a per&s;onal &s;aving Intere&s;t in the Promi&s;es of the Covenant. The Seals of the Covenant confirms its Promi&s;es only as they are pro|po&s;ed, and not as they are not. Therefore, whoever on|ly vi&s;ibly con&s;ents to the Covenant, but not with the whole Heart, though the Sacraments &s;eal the Truth and certainty of the Promi&s;es in them&s;elves, &s;. gr. Who&s;oe|ver believes &s;hall be &s;aved, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (the Connection between Faith and Salvation is ratified. Hence Sinners have &s;ure Ground to go upon in venturing upon Chri&s;t) yet they do not confirm an Intere&s;t in the Promi&s;e of Salvation to this Per&s;on while he does not truly believe; but when he truly believes, the Seals of the Covenant, in &s;ealing or ratifying the certain Connection between Faith and Sal|vation, con&s;equently &s;eals his per&s;onal Intere&s;t in the Promi&s;e of Salvation; as being one of the Characters to which the Promi&s;e is made and ratified. 4. They &s;eal to the Church, as a vi&s;ible Society, the external Privileges of the Covenant; &s;uch as the Care and Di&s;cipline of the Church over her &s;everal Members; the Ordinances of Wor&s;hip by which the Covenant is admini&s;tred, a Go&s;|pel Mini&s;try, and the Care of divine Providence both in correcting and in pre&s;erving and protecting her, &amp;c. from all which, completely taken, it appears,</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The Sacraments are de&s;igned to promote and maintain the external Purity, and vi&s;ible Holine&s;s of the Church, and this they do two Ways. Fir&s;t, they lay Bonds upon the Con&s;cience. Sacramental Tran&s;actions in|clude in them the mo&s;t &s;olemn Engagements to be the Lord's, to renounce the Service of Sin, and to walk in the Way of God's Commandments. The&s;e Engagements af|fect the Con&s;cience, and, at lea&s;t, lay Re&s;traints upon Men, whereby they are kept in from the external Prac|tice of Sin, and excited to practi&s;e the external Duties of Religion: hereby the vi&s;ible Reputation of Religion is much pre&s;erved. Tho&s;e who look upon them&s;elves free from the&s;e Obligations, though they own the Doctrines
<PB N="20" REF="011997_0019_0F8920E552A95BE8">
of the Go&s;pel to be true, and would rather claim the Chri&s;tian Name than any other, yet more generally live as they li&s;t, and &s;till their Con&s;ciences &s;leep pretty &s;ecure; hereby the Name of God is greatly di&s;honoured. I really think, the &s;o general Neglect of the Lord's Table much promotes this Security in the Indulgence of &s;inful Practices and Neglect of Religion. People entertain an unaccount|able Notion, that Bapti&s;m, which they received in In|fancy, does not &s;o deeply bind them to &s;uch great Strictne&s;s in the Ways of Holine&s;s; and therefore, while they keep back from the other Sacrament, they may take a greater Latitude. 2. They give Exi&s;tence and Ef|ficacy to Di&s;cipline. In order to the very being of Di&s;cipline, there mu&s;t be &s;omething from which Per|&s;ons may be debarred, or cut off, con&s;i&s;tent with the great De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel; and it mu&s;t be &s;omething of very great Importance. But this cannot con&s;i&s;t in de|barring any from hearing the Word preached, and the other Means of In&s;truction; for that would be to give up with them altogether, and u&s;e no more Means for their Conver&s;ion. It mu&s;t therefore lye in debarring them from the Seals of the Covenant, till they appear peni|tent, where the lighter Cen&s;ures, &s;uch as Admonitions and Rebukes, are found ineffectual or inadequate, and indeed the&s;e would not be regarded as Cen&s;ures, if the Contumacious had no higher to expect. The Govern|ment of Chri&s;t's Hou&s;e could not be kept up, if there were no Penalties to be inflicted in his Name. The Effi|cacy of Di&s;cipline lies in affecting and awing the Con|&s;cience; but what can &s;o effectually do this, as &s;u&s;pend|ing Offenders from the Privilege of communicating with God's People in the Seals of the Covenant, either in de|dicating their Children to God in Bapti&s;m, or approach|ing the Lord's Table, until they appear, in dealing with him, to be brought to Repentance? Or finally cutting them off, when their Conduct &s;hall be found &s;uch as a|mounts to a full, ob&s;tinate, and avowed Violation of their Covenant Obligations? If they have any Regard to
<PB N="21" REF="011997_0020_0F8920E839CDF940">
Chri&s;tianity at all, they will dread the Thoughts of being reduced to the State of Heathen Men and Publi|cans. See 1 Cor. x. 21, 22. Cap. v. Ver&s;e 3, 4, 5. 2 Cor. ii. 6, 7, 8.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The&s;e Holy Ordinances &s;eem to be in&s;tituted to &s;hew, that the ble&s;&s;ed God is not to be put off with acknowledging in general Terms, the Truth of Go&s;pel Doctrines, and that Religion is good, and ought to be cho&s;en. He demands our avowed Choice of it, and that we avouch the Lord for our God. The Lord, by the&s;e In&s;titutions, as it were, &s;ays, I will bring the Matter to a Point with you Sinners. You acknowledge me to be the only true God, and that you ought to &s;erve me; come then to a Re&s;olution on the Matter. Here are the Terms of Salvation, and on which I will be your God, propo&s;ed to you in a Way of gracious Covenant, either accept or refu&s;e; enter into &s;olemn, openly avowed Ob|ligations to me, or di&s;own me, and declare you will not take me for your God. Choo&s;e you this Day whom you will &s;erve, the Lord, or your own Heart's Lu&s;ts. Either join your&s;elves openly to my People, or acknowledge you will not be of them. Surely, if Men viewed Things in this Point of Light, it would have a &s;trong Tendency to awaken them to &s;olemn Exerci&s;es of Heart about this Matter.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, The Sacraments are, in a &s;pecial Manner, cal|culated and de&s;igned to cheri&s;h, quicken and &s;trengthen the Graces of the Holy Spirit in true Believers. They exhibit Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucified, (the great Object of a ju&s;tifying Faith) and the glorious ble&s;&s;ings he has purcha&s;ed to the Mind in a very &s;triking and lively Manner. Such Pledges of the divine Faithfulne&s;s; &s;uch &s;olemn Confirmations of the Promi&s;es of Life and Salva|tion through the Redemption of Chri&s;t, lay the firme&s;t Foundation for the Confidence, and mo&s;t inten&s;e acting of Faith. Here are the mo&s;t affecting Repre&s;entations of the Love and Grace of God towards his Children. Surely
<PB N="22" REF="011997_0021_0F8920E9CBFCAA20">
then, the Influence of the Holy Spirit concurring with all the&s;e Exhibitions, mu&s;t needs envigorate Faith, quick|en and rai&s;e the Affections, and enliven every Grace. The&s;e Ordinances, therefore, are often Means of the mo&s;t &s;weet and near Communion with God.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The foregoing Ob&s;ervations, if duly attended to, I think, throw con&s;iderable Light upon this Que&s;ti|on; <HI>viz.</HI> Who are the proper Subjects of the Sacra|ments? as may, perhaps, more fully appear by and by. This Que&s;tion has a Re&s;pect to two Sorts of Per&s;ons, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e who are born out of the Church, and &s;o mu&s;t enter at &s;uch Years of &s;uch Under&s;tanding as to be capable of tran&s;acting for them&s;elves, if ever they do; and &s;uch as are born in the Church, <HI>i. e.</HI> of Parents who are them|&s;elves vi&s;ible Church Members. The latter have a Right to Member&s;hip by Virtue of the Covenant, as &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between God and his vi&s;ible Church. It is true, the Child's Right to Member&s;hip follows the Right of the Parents, either both, or any one of them. Hence, if Parents be &s;u&s;pended from Privileges by the Cen&s;ures of the Church, or charged with &s;uch Offences as expo&s;e thereto, the Child's Right is in Su&s;pence until that &s;tumbling-block be removed; for hereby the Parents Right is called in Que&s;tion. The Rea&s;on is, that though the Parents are not cut off from Member&s;hip, but only under a temporary Su&s;pen&s;ion from Privilege; by which Di&s;cipline, the Church is dealing with them, in order to bring them to Repentance, and to behave as becomes Members, and &s;o recover their Right; yet, if to &s;uch Offence, they &s;hould add ob&s;tinate Impenitence, and all due Pains to bring them to Repentance, prove ineffectual; they would be cut off. In that Ca&s;e, they would be ex|cluded all Right, and &s;o could not be a Medium, by which their Child could derive any. Therefore, their Conduct, in the mean while, renders their Right doubtful until they appear to repent; con&s;equently, the Child's Right is doubtful al&s;o. But &s;till, it is not the Faith of the Parents,
<PB N="23" REF="011997_0022_0F8920E9E7C6DC80">
ever con&s;idered as vi&s;ible, which immediately confers the Right upon the Child. For an Act of Faith, con&s;idered &s;imply as &s;uch, is merely per&s;onal, and can communicate Nothing to another; but it is from the Parent's vi&s;ible Intere&s;t in the Covenant, and its external Privileges, in con&s;equence of their vi&s;ible Faith, (of which Privileges, its comprehending their Infant Seed together with them|&s;elves, is an important one) that the Child derives its Right of Member&s;hip, <HI>i. e.</HI> from the Parent's vi&s;ible Church-member&s;hip.</P>
<P>As to the former, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;uch as are born out of the Church, they have no Right of Member&s;hip, until, by their own per&s;onal Tran&s;action, they acquire it. This is done by acknowledging the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel to be true, yielding Subjection to the Laws and Ordinances of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and publickly embracing the true Reli|gion and expre&s;&s;ing a Con&s;ent to the Covenant of Grace in the Sacrament of Bapti&s;m, which is the Door of En|trance, and Seal of Member&s;hip. Thus the Son of the Stranger joins him&s;elf to the Lord, by taking hold of his Covenant. I&s;aiah lvi. 6.</P>
<P>But in Order to throw greater Light upon my Subject in my further Con&s;ideration of it, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top while I con&s;ider another Que&s;tion of great Impor|tance here, <HI>viz.</HI> What is that Profe&s;&s;ion of true Religion which con&s;titutes Member&s;hip in the vi&s;ible Church? I &s;ay, con&s;titutes Member&s;hip. For, to be vi&s;ibly one of the true Religion, and to be a Member of the vi&s;ible Church, is the &s;ame Thing. Now, this includes in it an Acknow|ledgment of the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel as true, and Obligation of the Laws of Chri&s;t, both verbal; for with the Mouth, Confe&s;&s;ion is made unto Salvation. Rom. x. 9, 10.) and practical by Obedience, and partaking of Bapti&s;m as a Sign and Seal of embracing the true Religi|on, and Dedication to God and his Service. In which Co|venant Relation to God thus &s;olemnly ratified, vi&s;ible
<PB N="24" REF="011997_0023_0F8920EAD3C1D4B0">
Church-member&s;hip formally lies. Member&s;hip in the Church is pre-requi&s;ite to, and &s;uppo&s;ed in approaching to the other Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, but not con&s;tituted by it. In this Sacrament, former Engagements are recognized and renewed; and the Edification and &s;pi|ritual Advantage of tho&s;e already Members of the Church, is promoted. Now, the afore&s;aid Profe&s;&s;ion and Dedication is either actual, when Per&s;ons are arrived to Years of Under&s;tanding, and tran&s;act for them&s;elves, or virtual; in the Profe&s;&s;ion and Tran&s;actions, in their Behalf, of tho&s;e who have a Right to dedicate them to God, as in the Ca&s;e of Infants. The&s;e are comprehended in the Covenant with the Church as the Seed of profe&s;|&s;ing Parents, and are vi&s;ibly Children of the Promi&s;e, their Parents are engaged to train them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, and teach them, from their early Childhood, the Ways of true Religion. As they become capable of In&s;truction, it is expected of them that they will be acquainted with, and acknowledge the Truths, and practi&s;e the Duties of Religion; and are reputed the Profe&s;&s;ors of it until they di&s;avow it. If any Thing contrary to this &s;hould appear, either in neglect|ing the known Duties of Religion or Immoralities in Practice; they ought to be dealt with by the Di&s;cipline of the Church, until they are either reclaimed, or regu|larly cut off. To the Neglect of this, no doubt, it is in a great Degree owing, that there is &s;o much Negligence in Matters of Religion among&s;t Youth. Now all the&s;e to|gether, and none of them alone, amount to a vi&s;ible Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of true Religion. The mo&s;t orthodox Sentiments only &s;hew, that a Per&s;on owns &s;ound Principles to be true, at lea&s;t under&s;tands them, but does not amount to a Profe&s;&s;ion of embracing them. The Practice of religious Duties affords yet a higher Probability, that the Doctrines of Religion make &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Heart, yet does not &s;ignify upon what Principles a Per&s;on profe&s;&s;es to act; whether from a &s;upreme Regard to God, or
<PB N="25" REF="011997_0024_0F8920EB5B5252E0">
merely from Cu&s;tom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but when to both the&s;e is added, a &s;olemn Covenant-Tran&s;action, in partaking of a Seal thereof in&s;tituted on Purpo&s;e, not only to confirm the Truth of the Go&s;pel on God's Part, but to expre&s;s the Man's Con&s;ent to the Covenant of Grace, and Dedi|cation of him&s;elf to the Lord, to &s;erve him upon the Principles thereof; then the Matter becomes determinate and fixed; if he does all this with his whole Heart, he is a true Chri&s;tian. By this external Profe&s;&s;ion he vi&s;ibly appears &s;uch, and never does appear &s;uch, until he par|take of, at lea&s;t, the initiating Seal and Token of the Covenant. As the Word and Sacraments are the Marks of the true Church, &s;o they are of the true Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, who place a Profe&s;&s;ion of true Re|ligion in &s;omething be&s;ide the above-mentioned, and altogether prior to coming to Sacraments, namely &s;ome Declaration that they do &s;o far as they know them|&s;elves, accept of Chri&s;t as their Saviour, and take God for their God, and give them&s;elves up to his Service with all their Hearts. Upon this Principle, many Mi|ni&s;ters draw up a Covenant in Form, containing &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions as the above. This they require Per&s;ons to take publickly, previous to their approaching the Lord's Table. or pre&s;enting their Children to Bapti&s;m. No doubt a Mini&s;ter &s;hould be very careful in examin|ing &s;uch as he admits to Sacraments. Hereby he will de|tect the gro&s;sly ignorant, who ought, on that Account, to be debarred. In this Way he will be under better Ad|vantages for apprehending what Views and Sen&s;e of Things they have, and to judge what Advices it may be proper to give them; but I have &s;ome Exceptions to the Requi&s;ition of a Declaration of &s;uch a Tenor, or taking a Covenant drawn up in &s;uch a Set Form. I doubt it will rather prove a Snare, than be of any real Advantage. Such a Covenant is de&s;igned either, as an immediate Tran&s;action with God, or as a &s;olemn Declaration to the Church, for their greater Satisfaction as to the Per&s;ons admitted. In the former View, it is u&s;ele&s;s and &s;uperflu|ous;
<PB N="26" REF="011997_0025_0F8920EC1AAC79D8">
for it is only doing the &s;ame Thing that is done in partaking of the Seals of the Covenant, which God has in&s;tituted as public Signs, and &s;olemn Ratifications of &s;uch a Tran&s;action; with this Difference, that in&s;tead of the public Actions of Divine Appointment as Signs, to which the Word of God has affixed &s;uch a Sen&s;e, &s;uch a particular Form of Expre&s;&s;ion is propo&s;ed as the public Sign; and with re&s;pect to Per&s;ons already baptized, it &s;eems to in&s;inuate, that they are not already in the Church, and in Covenant with God by Virtue of their Bapti&s;m, which is contrary to Fact. But are not the Signs which our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has appointed, and the Manner of covenanting which he has pre&s;cribed &s;ufficient, without the Addition of our own Inventions to &s;upply the Defect?</P>
<P>But if only a Declaration, as Matter of Satisfaction to the Church, is de&s;igned; pray, will it afford better Evi|dence of a Man's Sincerity of Heart, to hear him pro|nounce &s;uch Words, than to &s;ee him u&s;e Actions, which, by Divine Appointment, &s;ignify &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame Thing? and therefore, of the &s;ame Import with the a|fore&s;aid Declaration? To require &s;uch a Declaration is to require a Per&s;on to pronounce or affirm &s;omething con|cerning the Exerci&s;es of his own Heart as a Term of Ad|mi&s;&s;ion. This cannot be con&s;idered as a Declaration of a Matter of Fact, but only his Opinion, or, at mo&s;t, Judgment of him&s;elf. Now his Judgment may be formed upon Evidence, that is really &s;uch to him&s;elf. But, pray, what Evidence is that to others? Here I doubt, the for|mal Profe&s;&s;or will be more ready to pronounce, than many a true Chri&s;tian. I would appeal to the Mini&s;ters who are in this Practice, whether on the one Hand, they don't find Rea&s;on to fear that the&s;e Declarations, or even Covenants, are &s;unk to Matter of mere Form; and on the other, whether they don't find a Number of poor perplexed Souls, upon whom they mu&s;t look in a Judgment of &s;criptural Charity, as the Children of God; who yet are full of Apprehen&s;ion they have not the &s;ay|ing
<PB N="27" REF="011997_0026_0F8920ECD7E1BD30">
Grace of God. Yea, their prevailing Opinion may be on that Side, and dare not make &s;uch a peremptory Declaration, either to their Fellow-men, or in a Cove|nant-Tran&s;action with God; and though many a Salvo be propo&s;ed, yet their Con&s;cience is not &s;atisfied. May not a Chri&s;tian really give up his Heart to God, and yet not be able to declare he has done &s;o, even in his own Judgment? Others may flatter them&s;elves that they have really con&s;ented to the Covenant, when, indeed, it is o|therwi&s;e. Can it be the Divine Will that Matters &s;hould be &s;et upon &s;o precarious a Footing, and &s;uch a Snare &s;hould be laid for Men, to embarra&s;s their Way? Shall our Duty be directed by &s;o uncertain a Rule;</P>
<P>If it be objected here, that I maintain &s;acramental Tran&s;actions to be &s;ub&s;tantially of the &s;ame Import, and the Sacraments are Signs of our Con&s;ent to the Cove|nant of Grace, and will not that involve the &s;ame Diffi|culty?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, No. The Sacraments are indeed Signs of our Con&s;ent to the Covenant; but they are not Signs of our Opinion of the Kind of that Con&s;ent too; they are not Signs of our declaring that Con&s;ent to be true and &s;av|ing. It is one Thing really to con&s;ent; and another to be able to pronounce that Con&s;ent to be Right; the Com|mand of God is a plain Rule of Duty. A Per&s;on, there|fore, under great Perplexity about the State of his Soul, may yet find him&s;elf bound in Con&s;cience to attempt Obe|dience to God. Very true, he ought to have in View the Nature of the Duty, and what is required of him in it. He is required to give the full Con&s;ent of his Heart to the new Covenant, and yield him&s;elf up to God. This is the Bu&s;ine&s;s that lies before him, and which he is to attempt in receiving the Seals of the Covenant, but here is no Set Form of Words he is to u&s;e; he will tran&s;act with God in &s;uch mental Language as be&s;t expre&s;&s;es the Frame of his Heart. Perhaps, he cannot feel that Freedom of Heart he de&s;ires, and dare not &s;ay, I do con&s;ent; I do
<PB N="28" REF="011997_0027_0F8920ED91E00CC0">
give up my Heart to thee O God, but can only &s;ay, I de|&s;ire to cleave to Chri&s;t; O to be found in him! O that I could get my Heart opened, and full of Cheerfulne&s;s in giving my&s;elf away to the Lord. If he has ju&s;t Appre|hen&s;ions of the&s;e Things, and the&s;e De&s;ires under the&s;e Apprehen&s;ions are really from his Heart, he does con|con&s;ent, and yield him&s;elf to God; and yet, at the &s;ame Time, may be far from being &s;atisfied that he has done &s;o, but go away full of bitter Complaints. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee the wide Difference in the two Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>But it is Time to return to the Que&s;tion I left. When the Sons of the Stanger are in&s;tructed in the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, are convinced in their Judgment and Con|&s;cience, they are true and exhibit the true Religion; that they are bound by the Authority of God to embrace it, and yield Obedience to the Divine Laws; it is their immediate Duty to embrace it, and that publickly and avowedly by joining them&s;elves to the Lord, and his Church, in the Sacrament of Bapti&s;m; and thus make a public Profe&s;&s;ion of the true Religion, come under &s;o|lemn Obligations to walk in the Ways of God's Com|mandments, and under the Care and Di&s;cipline of the Church. The ble&s;&s;ed God will not have Matters lying loo&s;e, but has appointed the Sacraments to bring them to a Point, and to reduce Per&s;ons to &s;ome Determination, either to appear for God and Religion, or reject him; nor may they plead, by Way of Excu&s;e, that though they are convinced of the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religi|on, and that all this is their Duty, yet their Hearts hang back and do not yield. God will not &s;u&s;tain this as a Plea. Shall their Di&s;obedience &s;tand as a good Argument why they &s;hould not obey? Surely they are more likely to obtain Divine Grace in the Church, than out of it among the Heathen; they ought to &s;tretch out the withered Hand, to attempt giving them&s;elves to the Lord in Co|venant. They are to &s;et the Terms of the Covenant in View, and attempt to give the Con&s;ent of their Heart,
<PB N="29" REF="011997_0028_0F8920EF07F9DEC0">
and that in the &s;olemn Tran&s;action which God has com|manded. How know they, but while they are attempt|ing, the Heart may be made to yield? or, if it &s;till hang back, and does not go forth in Acts of Faith: Are they not likely to be more exerci&s;ed about the Matter, now they are under &s;olemn Obligation thereto, than when they had not come under it?</P>
<P>Now, all baptized Per&s;ons, I have already &s;hewed, are vi&s;ible Members of the Church of Chri&s;t. By this Dedi|cation, they are bound to attend upon all the Duties and Ordinances belonging to the Chri&s;tian Character, as they &s;hall arrive to &s;ufficient Strength of natural Powers; dif|ferent Duties require different Degrees of natural Abili|ty. The Want of this will excu&s;e from the Di&s;charge of Duties, which would otherwi&s;e be incumbent, but Want of moral Ability, thro' our Default, does not excu&s;e at all. Therefore, I &s;ay, they &s;tand bound, by their bap|ti&s;mal Dedication, to &s;erve God in all the Duties of the Chri&s;tian Religion, for which they have a &s;ufficient na|tural Capacity; and it is given in Commi&s;&s;ion to the Mi|ni&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, to teach tho&s;e they have <HI>di&s;cipled to ob&s;erve all Things what&s;oever Chri&s;t has commanded.</HI> Mat. xxviii. 20. Now the Lord's Supper is one of tho&s;e Things he has commanded his Di&s;ciples. Therefore, all baptized Per&s;ons are bound, as they come to Years of Under&s;tanding, to attend upon it.</P>
<P>It is indeed here to be ob&s;erved, that &s;uch as are gro&s;ly ignorant, (having &s;ufficient natural Capacity) or Guilty of gro&s;s Immoralities, or habitually neglect the known Duties of practical Religion, are to be excluded from the Sacraments by the regular Exerci&s;e of Church Di&s;cipline. till by Repentance and Reformation they remove the Of|fence. The Rea&s;on is, that the&s;e Things are &s;uch vi&s;ible Violations of, and Contradictions to the Covenant, that to admit &s;uch, would de&s;troy one great De&s;ign of the Sa|craments, <HI>viz.</HI> to pre&s;erve the external Holine&s;s and Pu|rity of the Church, and be vi&s;ible Signs of our Con&s;ent
<PB N="30" REF="011997_0029_0F8920EF1E983AC8">
to God's gracious Covenant, and avouching the Lord for our God; for they, who, by their Works deny God, can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed to choo&s;e him. It would be, in Short, to pro&s;titute the Ordinance, and leave no vi&s;ible Differ|ence between the Deportment of Church-members and the World, and de&s;troy all Di&s;tinction of the Church from tho&s;e who are without. But all this is &s;o far from infering, that the Law commanding Attendance upon Sacraments does not bind them; that it &s;uppo&s;es the con|trary. For how el&s;e can this Prohibition be con&s;idered as a Penalty and Privation of Privilege? It is upon this Prin|ciple, <HI>viz.</HI> the Obligation of the Duty, that &s;uch Cen|&s;ure &s;erves to affect the Con&s;cience, and awaken the Of|fender to Repentance, that he may be re&s;tored. The Ground of &s;uch a Cen&s;ure mu&s;t be &s;ome Fact or Facts, which can be certainly known and judged of; and of &s;uch a Nature as, if ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in, after all due Pains taken with the Party, would cut him off from all Right of Member&s;hip. The Obligation to attend tho&s;e Holy Ordinances, binds &s;uch Offenders to &s;hun the Scan|dals which exclude them; and by thus excluding them|&s;elves, they very criminally turn their Backs upon them.</P>
<P>But the Church has the Authority of Chri&s;t for thus excluding the Scandalous, 1 Cor. v. 11. <HI>But now I have written unto you,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>not to keep Company, if any Man, that is called a Brother, be a Fornicator, or cove|tous, or an Idolator, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Ex|tortioner, with &s;uch an one, no, not to eat.</HI> I am not &s;o clear as &s;ome Commentators &s;eem to be, that the eating here mentioned does not mean eating at the Lord's Table, be|cau&s;e connected with the Caution not to keep Company, I rather think it does; for they are plainly Matters of Di&s;cipline of which the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, and a Conduct con&s;equent upon the Church's pa&s;&s;ing Judgment, as ap|pears by the next Ver&s;e; and it was natural enough to ob|&s;erve, that &s;uch a Judgment pa&s;&s;ed upon a Per&s;on, infer|ed an Obligation on Church-members, to avoid even
<PB N="31" REF="011997_0030_0F8920EFD23D1528">
that civil Society or Company with &s;uch a Per&s;on, which they might allow them&s;elves in with their Heathen Neighbours. However, if it intend eating in ordinary Meals, the Argument from this Pa&s;&s;age, in Support of Di&s;cipline, will &s;till hold good. For if we mu&s;t avoid civil Society or Fellow&s;hip with a Per&s;on at his, or our own Table, much more, &s;uch a &s;olemn Act of Communi|on as eating with him at the Lord's Table. But all re|gular Members of the vi&s;ible Church of Under&s;tanding &s;ufficient to be able to attend to the Lord's Supper as a commemorative Sign, are bound, by the Authority of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to &s;hew forth his Death till he come and are highly criminal in neglecting it; and &s;uch as are Pa|rents, are bound to dedicate their Children to God in Bap|ti&s;m. By this Means, the vi&s;ible Church is propagated and pre&s;erved. It is doubtle&s;s one End of the Ordinance of Bapti&s;m, to collect Materials into the Church, and under the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel, as Subjects of divine In|fluences.</P>
<P>It will be objected here, that many baptized Per&s;ons, yea, it is to be feared the greater Part, are unregenerate, and unbaptized Per&s;ons may be convinced in their Con&s;ci|ences, that the Chri&s;tian Religion is true, and it is their Duty to embrace it, yet be &s;till in a natural State; there|fore it will follow, that the unregenerate ought to come to Sacraments, this their unhappy State notwith&s;tanding. I admit the Con&s;equence; they are under the &s;ame Obli|gation to this as to other Duties of Religion.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that if the unregenerate are bound to come to Sacraments, then it will follow, that the Sacraments are not vi&s;ible Signs of true Chri&s;tians, or of a vi&s;ible Profe&s;&s;ion of true Religion.</P>
<P>I deny the Con&s;equence. It no more follows on this than the contrary Suppo&s;ition; for on all Hands it is granted that many unregenerate Per&s;ons do come to Sa|craments: Indeed, if I alledged, no more was required of them in that Tran&s;action, than an unregenerate Sinner,
<PB N="32" REF="011997_0031_0F8920F309A2CC00">
continuing &s;uch, can do, then the afore&s;aid Con&s;equence would follow. For the Sacraments can be vi&s;ible Signs of no more than they &s;ignify or is required in them: But I only &s;ay, the Per&s;ons who are unregenerate, are, notwith&s;tanding, really bound, by the Authority of God, to this, as well as any other Duty of Religion, they di&s;|obey him in neglecting it; nor will their Unregeneracy be any Plea for their Neglect. But yet they are bound to do all in attending that the true Chri&s;tian does: To accept Chri&s;t as their Saviour, make Choice of God as their God, and to give them&s;elves wholly to him. He requires the unregenerate to make them new Hearts, and turn into the Lord. Ezek. xviii. 31, 32. And &s;urely he may ju&s;tly require them to do this with external Solemnity by Way of Covenant, and vi&s;ibly avow and ratify their join|ing them&s;elves to the Lord. By the In&s;titution of the&s;e Ordinances, the Lord, as it were, &s;ays to Sinners, it will not do only to entertain a good Opinion of Religion as true and nece&s;&s;ary, but I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that you will ei|ther embrace or reject it; avouch me as your God, or di&s;avow me. Choo&s;e you this Day whom you will &s;erve. here is my Covenant; here are the Terms of Salvation; the&s;e Overtures I &s;olemnly ratify; on my Part, by the&s;e public Signs and Seals, as mo&s;t &s;ure Foundations, on which you may &s;afely depend, and I demand that you &s;trike a Covenant with me, and openly confirm it by re|ceiving the&s;e Seals thereof. If, indeed, in this Tran&s;|action your Hearts hang back, and don't con&s;ent, I can|not approve and accept you; yet if you neglect this In|&s;titution, and will not &s;o much as make the Attempt to yield your&s;elves; I will con&s;ider this as an open and avowed Rejection of me and my Service. Is there any Thing unrea&s;onable in this Requi&s;ition? and who can tell but that in &s;etting the&s;e Matters &s;olemnly before them, and attempting, in Obedience to God's Commands to give them&s;elves up to him in the&s;e &s;olemn Covenant-tran&s;|actions, the Holy Spirit may concur, and make the Heart
<PB N="33" REF="011997_0032_0F8920F3E109BBB0">
to yield? If it do, the Bu&s;ine&s;s is done; they are true Chri&s;tians; and who that beholds the&s;e &s;olemn Tran&s;|actions, can &s;ay the Heart does not con&s;ent? Therefore, the Sacraments are vi&s;ible Signs of a Profe&s;&s;ion of true Religion, and the Per&s;ons who partake of them are to be treated as Chri&s;tians, till the contrary appears.</P>
<P>It is &s;ometimes &s;aid, that the unregenerate are, indeed, obliged to come to Sacraments, but not immediately: It is their Duty, but not their immediate Duty. They are fir&s;t to come to Chri&s;t, and then come to Sacraments.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, then it is not now their Duty in pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances; therefore their &s;taying back is &s;o far from being criminal, that they do right. To talk of the mediate Obligation of a Law pre&s;cribing Duty, is a Contradiction. The Law either obliges a Per&s;on now, or it does not oblige him. In a Covenant or Promi&s;e, there may be a conditional Obligation, which depends upon &s;ome Event, or &s;omething to be done by another as the Condition. Yet even then, until the Condition takes Place, there is no actual Obligation. But a Law obliges with|out any other Condition than the rightful Authority of the Legi&s;lator, and it obliges all, to whom it is given, to immediate Obedience from the Time of its Promulgation, or Commencement; and the Neglect of it expo&s;es to Puni&s;hment as a Di&s;obedience, Ca&s;es of natural Inability only excepted.</P>
<P>As to the newly invented Plea, that God commands no unregenerate Duties (a very odd Phra&s;e) or does not command unregenerate Men, as &s;uch, to do Duties. It really does not de&s;erve a &s;erious An&s;wer; for the mean|ing mu&s;t be, either, that the Law of God does not com|mand any Duties to be done upon the Principles from which unregenerate Men act, or in the Manner, in which only they can perform them, while they continue &s;uch, and then, it is nothing to the Purpo&s;e. None of my Rea|&s;onings are built upon, or require any &s;uch Suppo&s;ition. No, it is a &s;piritual holy Obedience that is required of them; the &s;ame that is required of the mo&s;t holy Saint;
<PB N="34" REF="011997_0033_0F8920F455326828">
and their Unregeneracy or moral Inability, affords them no Excu&s;e,&mdash;Or el&s;e it mu&s;t intend, that Per&s;ons, who are unregenerate, are not comprehended in the Obligation of the Law; it does not command them to do any Thing in Religion, till they &s;hall be regenerated. The very mention of which &s;o glares with Ab&s;urdity, that I believe there will none be found daring enough to a&s;&s;ert it. For, upon that Suppo&s;ition, the unregenerate would be &s;et free from all Obligation to the Practice of Duty at once; their Neglect of all Religion would be no Di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>But it is objected, there is a Difference between natu|ral and po&s;itive, or in&s;tituted Duties. The former, as Prayer for In&s;tance, bind all Mankind, by Virtue of the original Law given to Man in Innocence; but the latter are, by the Qualifications required in them, limited to the Per&s;ons, in whom the Qualifications are found.</P>
<P>An&s;w. Natural Duties are qualified, as well as po&s;itive. Gracious Principles, and a holy Manner of Action are equally required in both. Nor will the original Obligati|on of the moral Law natural, make any Difference in the Ca&s;e. For it is a Principle of that Law, that what&s;oever po&s;itive In&s;titutions God &s;hall make known as his Will, are to be obeyed. Po&s;itive Laws as univer&s;ally bind all of the general Character to which they are directed, as do natural. Nor do the Qualifications required in Duties, at all limit the Subjects of the Law. The divine Legi&s;lator does not give his Laws in this Manner, <HI>viz.</HI> Who&s;oever have the Qualifications required in them, are to perform the enjoined Duties; but he requires Duties &s;o and &s;o qualified ab&s;olutely, without IF or AND, of all who claim a Share in the general Character to which they be|long. All, who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, &s;tand obliged to all the Duties of Chri&s;tians as &s;uch.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that partaking of Sacraments im|ports a Con&s;ent to the Covenant of Grace, which unre|generate Sinners cannot give: And &s;urely God does not require Per&s;ons to declare a Lie, and that in &s;o &s;olemn a Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="011997_0034_0F8920F513E25500">I an&s;wer, the ble&s;&s;ed God is &s;o far from requiring any to declare a Lie, that he commands them to tran&s;act in this Covenant with all their Hearts. As he has in&s;tituted Sa|craments, &s;o he requires all to attend upon them with all the Qualifications requi&s;ite in &s;uch Attendance. Their Want of the Qualifications does not excu&s;e the Neglect of the external Duty one Moment; for their rightful So|vereign does not admit their continuing unholy one Mo|ment; and therefore, there is no Plea for Di&s;obedience in any one In&s;tance. The Obligation of God's Law does not turn upon the internal Qualifications of the Subjects, but the rightful Authority of the Law-giver; and it is &s;uf|ficient to ju&s;tify this, that Man had originally &s;ufficient Ability to obey all the Will of God in a proper Manner, but lo&s;t it by his own Default. The ble&s;&s;ed God, there|fore, has a ju&s;t Right to command all that is ju&s;tly due from the Subjects of his Goverment, in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute Manner, whatever their pre&s;ent internal Qualifications may be. Nor can it be &s;aid, that even the Unregenerate do not, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, really con&s;ent to the Covenant. The Terms of the Covenant are &s;et before them; they acknowledge the&s;e to be the Terms, the only Terms of Salvation; they yield, that it is ju&s;t and right, that God &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon this as the only Way of receiving Sinners to Favour; and con&s;ent that this Tran&s;action &s;hall &s;tand as a Wine&s;s again&s;t them if their Hearts &s;tand back. It will &s;tand good again&s;t them as a vi&s;ible public Con&s;ent, before God, Angels and Men; and be pleadable, yea pleaded again&s;t them in the great Day of God, if their Hearts &s;hall be found wanting. This &s;hews, it is not a vain Thing to require their Attendance. Here is a &s;uf|ficiently important, though not the only End of the&s;e In&s;titutions. The Tran&s;action imports a Declaration, that they are at lea&s;t attempting to give their hearty Con&s;ent, but not a Declaration, whether that Con&s;ent be truly &s;incere or not. The Sacraments are not in&s;tituted to be vi&s;ible Signs of Per&s;on's Opinion or Judgment concerning the Exerci&s;es of their own Hearts; but Signs of vi&s;ible
<PB N="36" REF="011997_0035_0F8920F5DFD3B480">
Con&s;ent they are, which will be of great Importance for the Illu&s;tration of the divine Ju&s;tice, in the aggrava|ted Condemnation of Go&s;pel Sinners.</P>
<P>It is further objected, that unregenerate Sinners, in partaking of Sacraments, perjure them&s;elves in the very Act, and &s;ure God does not require Perjury.</P>
<P>An&s;w. It is not the Crime de&s;igned by the Name of <HI>Perjury. That</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in calling God to Witne&s;s to the Truth of what the Party knows to be fal&s;e. <HI>This</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the Non-Concurrence of the Heart in a &s;olemn Engage|ment, into which the Party enters. This is the unrege|nerate Sinner's great Fault in every holy Duty, his Heart is not in it; and the greater Solemnity of a Co|venant-Tran&s;action is no Doubt, a great Aggravation of his Crime: but it is not taking God to Witne&s;s to a known Fal&s;ehood, he takes God to Witne&s;s, indeed, to a &s;olemn Engagement, which he vi&s;ibly, publickly, and really enters into, and declares. Though his Heart con|curs not in the Manner God requires, yet the Engage|ment is real; he will feel him&s;elf held and obliged to be the Lord's. But he declares nothing herein about the Sincerity or In&s;incerity of his Heart in this Tran&s;action, or the Engagement he thus ratifies. Were it under&s;tood to import &s;o &s;olemn a Declaration of the Per&s;on's Judg|ment of his own Conduct, the Child of God, who&s;e Heart &s;incerely con&s;ents, would often not dare to make &s;uch a Declaration. To give Force to the Objection, it &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Per&s;on knowingly di&s;&s;embles. That he publickly engages, only to &s;ave Appearances, and to impo&s;e upon others for &s;ome Purpo&s;e or other, while he explicitly and formally re&s;olves in his Heart, he will not cleave to the Lord to &s;erve him, but walk after the Imagination of his own evil Heart; but this is not to be alledged in this Ca&s;e. The Per&s;on is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;et the Terms of the Covenant in View, con&s;ider the Claim God has to him, and the Obligations redeeming Love lays up|on him; &s;ets him&s;elf, from Con&s;cience of Duty, to pre|&s;ent him&s;elf before the Lord, and attempt to give the
<PB N="37" REF="011997_0036_0F8920F6979696E8">
Con&s;ent of his Heart; and wi&s;hes, upon &s;ome Principle or other, there was &s;uch an Heart in him. Thus far an unregenerate Sinner may go; and however his Heart fails in this Matter, yet he con&s;titutes a real Engagement which binds him to accept of Chri&s;t, and be the Lord's forever. To this, God, Angels, and Men are Witne&s;&s;es. If the&s;e Things be duly con&s;idered, the Objection vani&s;h|es; and it will appear, the unregenerate Sinner is no more chargeable with Perjury in receiving the Sacra|ments, than with lying in Prayer; But would any one per&s;uade him, by all Means, not to dare to pray?</P>
<P>It is often objected, that the Unregenerate, when they partake of Sacraments, put a Seal to a Blank.</P>
<P>An&s;w. If the Sacraments were primarily, and only Seals of a per&s;onal Intere&s;t in the Covenant, there would be Weight in the Objection. But while the Sacra|ments, in the U&s;e of them, even by the Unregenerate, do really &s;eal the Truth and Certainty of the Covenant of Grace, in its true Tenor on God's Part; and on the Communicant's Part a &s;olemn Engagement, binding on his Con&s;cience, to embrace this Covenant, with all his Heart, and will &s;tand firm again&s;t him, for his aggravated Condemnation, if he does not; it is very far from being a Seal to a Blank.</P>
<P>Again, it will be &s;aid, if the Sacraments were con|verting Ordinances, then all &s;hould attend upon them as well as Prayer, hearing the Word, &amp;c. but as they are only &s;ealing, and not converting Ordinances, the Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>An&s;w. All this is <HI>gratis Dictum,</HI> a mere A&s;&s;ertion without Proof. For my Part, I know not how Divines have come by this Di&s;tinction of Ordinances into con|verting and Non-converting. I don't know any Ordinance of the Go&s;pel, which is not a converting Ordinance. Surely, that the Sacraments are Seals, does not hinder, but promotes their Tendency to the Conver&s;ion of Sin|ners. I think, we have no Way to know, that any Or|dinance
<PB N="38" REF="011997_0037_0F8920F756D327A8">
is a converting Ordinance, but from its native Tendency to that End, and its being u&s;ed by God for that Purpo&s;e. Now, what &s;tronger Tendency can there be, to bring home Sinners to God, than the Exhibition the Sacraments give of Chri&s;t; of the Way of Salvation through Faith in his Blood; of the Grace of God, and the Stability of the new Covenant? their very De&s;ign is to engage Men to come to a Point, and to clo&s;e in with the Terms of Salvation propo&s;ed in the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, it will then follow, that the profane and &s;candalous ought to be admitted to the Sacraments, that they may be converted.</P>
<P>An&s;w. So far from it, that directly the rever&s;e is the Con&s;equence. This is one Circum&s;tance, from whence ari&s;es the &s;trong Tendency of Sacraments to convert Sin|ners, <HI>viz.</HI> that they &s;ecure and promote the vi&s;ible Holi|ne&s;s and external Purity of the Church, and thereby di&s;tingui&s;h her from the World. They thus a&s;&s;ert the Nece&s;&s;ity of true Holine&s;s, and point it out as the di&s;|tingui&s;hing Character of God's People; but the Force of this Argument would be lo&s;t, if no &s;uch Di&s;tinction was made. Yea, not merely be lo&s;t, but Sinners would be greatly encouraged to continue &s;ecure in Sin.</P>
<P>It is an Objection of great Weight with &s;ome, that to admit unregenerate Men to Sacraments, and teach them that they are bound to come, tends to flatter their vain Hopes, make them &s;ecure, and build them up in Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s. To make out this Con&s;equence, it is alledged, we mu&s;t, in this Ca&s;e, proceed upon this Prin|ciple, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;ome unregenerate Men have &s;ome good Principles, &s;ome &s;incere Regard for, and liking to God in his proper Character; are in Heart friendly to the Way of Salvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; have &s;ome real and proper De&s;ires for Holine&s;s, (from a View of its Excel|lency, or for its own Sake, I &s;uppo&s;e) and an Intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; (which would be, I think, to &s;uppo&s;e they were not unregenerate, and &s;o would be a Contradiction
<PB N="39" REF="011997_0038_0F8920F8970B42F0">
in Terms) and that God &s;o far approves and accepts them, as on that Ground to enter into Covenant with them.</P>
<P>An&s;w. I think, it will appear from the whole I have &s;aid in the preceding Pages, that the Matter depends on no &s;uch Principle. The Acceptablene&s;s of the Per&s;ons and Duties of even the holie&s;t Saints on Earth with God, is not at all the Ground or Rea&s;on of his entering into Covenant with them. So far from it, that their Accept|ance with him is founded in the Covenant of Grace, and provided for by it. To alledge otherwi&s;e, would be to take the Arminian Side of the Que&s;tion indeed.</P>
<P>I readily grant the unhappy State and Character of all unregenerate Sinners; they are at Enmity with God, and have no holy Di&s;po&s;itions, but are wholly depraved. But is that any Rea&s;on why the great God, their rightful Sovereign, &s;hall not demand their immediate Submi&s;&s;ion and Return to him? He offers his Mercy, and requires their Return in a Way of Covenant, and that tran&s;acted in a vi&s;ible public Manner. For this Purpo&s;e he in&s;tituted Sacraments, that they may render the Covenant vi&s;ible, and be a vi&s;ible Expre&s;&s;ion or Token of Con&s;ent. This Tran&s;action, and that with the whole Heart, he requires without Delay. Unregenerate though they be, yet &s;ince it is in the Way of his own In&s;titutions he meets with Sinners, they are to &s;tretch out the withered Hand, and attempt Obedience. It is the carele&s;s Admi&s;&s;ion of the profane and &s;candalous, and the unfaithfulne&s;s of Mini|&s;ters in neglecting to lay Matters fairly before People, and addre&s;s the Con&s;cience with the Arguments ari&s;ing from this Topic, that depreciates the Sacraments, and promotes Security and Self-Righteou&s;ne&s;s. In&s;tead of the Con&s;equences above-mentioned, there would be the &s;tronge&s;t Tendency to convince and awaken the Con&s;ci|ence, and affect the Heart, upon Suppo&s;ition of the fol|lowing Things, <HI>viz.</HI> that Di&s;cipline, whereby the open|ly irreligious and profane are to be kept off, be duly
<PB N="40" REF="011997_0039_0F8920F8EA7DA7B0">
exerci&s;ed. That Mini&s;ters deal faithfully with the Con&s;ci|ence, &s;et the Terms of the Covenant fairly before Peo|ple, &s;hew them that a Con&s;ent to the&s;e is required in at|tending the Sacraments, and nothing &s;hort of it will be accepted; that if their Hearts refu&s;e, they will grievou&s;ly Sin, and be found Guilty before God; yet they may not neglect his In&s;titutions without ADDING to their Guilt by open Di&s;obedience. That they awaken them to look to, and carefully examine their Hearts before and after &s;uch &s;olemn Tran&s;actions; and pre&s;s them to con&s;i|der their awful Guilt, if their Hearts are found wanting: yet &s;hew them, they are under the Bond of the Covenant; are bound in Con&s;cience to &s;eek an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t with ince&s;&s;ant Anxiety, and yield up their Hearts to God; and that, in the great Day of Account, they will be dealt with as Covenant-Breakers if they do not. Yea, tho&s;e injurious Con&s;equences rather follow on the other Side of the Que&s;tion. For, on that State of the Ca&s;e, &s;uch unregenerate Sinners as come to Sacraments, look upon their <HI>Admi&s;&s;ion</HI> as a Ground of Confidence that they are true Chri&s;tians; and thinking they are &s;afe, &s;it down &s;e|cure. Such as look upon them&s;elves as unprepared, ap|prehending they are not under a Nece&s;&s;ity of acting, con|clude to neglect it, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;s any further Care about Preparation, and think them&s;elves more at Liberty to in|dulge their Corruptions thro' the Cour&s;e of Life. Thus a Sen&s;e of Obligation by Virtue of their Bapti&s;m is much de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume I have now taken Notice of the mo&s;t weigh|ty Objections to my Sentiments, and by removing them, have gone, at lea&s;t, a good Length towards evincing the Truth of what I have advanced. However, there remain &s;undry Arguments, which to me appear conclu&s;ive on the affirmative Side of the Que&s;tion; the&s;e I &s;hall here take Liberty to propo&s;e, and</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, All tho&s;e, who are convinced that the Chri&s;tian Religion is true, are immediately obliged to embrace and
<PB N="41" REF="011997_0040_0F8920FBB69C58C0">
openly profe&s;s it; this is almo&s;t a &s;elf-evident Propo&s;iti|on. For to &s;uppo&s;e otherwi&s;e, would be to &s;uppo&s;e, that the ble&s;&s;ed God had made known his Will, and propo&s;ed a Sy&s;tem of Religion, which yet Men, convinced of its Truth, were at Liberty to reject; and this would be the &s;ame Thing, as to &s;ay, he had not a rightful Authority to oblige them; the very Mention of this &s;hews the gla|ring Ab&s;urdity. Now it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that if &s;uch Per&s;ons are immediately bound to embrace the true Re|ligion, they are immediately bound to profe&s;s it, <HI>i. e.</HI> pub|lickly con&s;ent to it; for, when Religion is publickly pro|po&s;ed, not to profe&s;s and avow it, is openly to di&s;avow and reject it, there is no Medium. It is the mo&s;t flat Con|tradiction to imagine we embrace the true Religion, and at the &s;ame Time, openly neglect and di&s;avow it. But I have already &s;hewed, that to embrace the true Religion is to enter into Covenant with God; without con&s;enting to the Covenant of Grace, there is no &s;uch Thing as em|bracing Religion. So to profe&s;s Religion is openly and vi&s;ibly to tran&s;act that Covenant; and this is done in the Participation of the Sacraments, and not otherwi&s;e. There is no full formal Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion antece|dent to this; for without it, none are vi&s;ibly in Covenant, unle&s;s they can be vi&s;ibly in Covenant without ratifying and &s;ealing it. In this Point of View, I think, the Scrip|ture &s;ets the Matter, Act. ii. 37, 38. <HI>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their Hearts, and &s;aid unto Peter, and to the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles, Men and Brethren, what &s;hall we do? then Peter &s;aid unto them, repent and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI> The Apo&s;tle had laid before them the Evidence of Chri&s;t's being the true MESSIAH, from the Fulfilment of antient Prophecies concerning him in his Re&s;urrection from the Dead. The Con&s;equence was, they were convinced of the Truth of Chri&s;tianity, and of their aggravated Guilt in the Crucifixion of the Lord of Glory, full of Anxiety, they enquire what to do. The An&s;wer is, REPENT and be BAPTIZED, <HI>i. e.</HI> en|ter
<PB N="42" REF="011997_0041_0F8920FD4569C1E8">
into Covenant with God, publickly tran&s;acting and ratifying it by the Seal of Bapti&s;m. If it be &s;aid here is the Order, fir&s;t repent, and then be baptized. I an&s;wer,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, This is no more than I have in&s;i&s;ted on as nece&s;|&s;ary to be done, <HI>viz.</HI> to &s;et before Per&s;ons the Nature of true Religion and the Terms of Salvation, and let them know that a cordial Compliance with all this is required, and nothing &s;hort of it will do. This is fully con&s;i&s;tent with what I have &s;aid, and this they are to profe&s;s in their Bapti&s;m. Nor do they vi&s;ibly profe&s;s Repentance, while they &s;tand back from this Ordinance. 2d. Though they are called upon to repent, there is not the lea&s;t Hint, that they were to defer their Bapti&s;m until they &s;hould have Evidence, on which they might judge they had &s;aving Repentance. They were immediately to of|fer them&s;elves to Bapti&s;m, and were forthwith baptized; and in Con&s;equence thereof, they went on in the con&s;tant Attendance on all other Ordinances, <HI>they continued &s;ted|fa&s;tly in the Apo&s;tle's Doctrine and Fellow&s;hip, and in the breaking of Bread,</HI> (i. e. the Participation of the Lord's Supper) <HI>and in Prayer.</HI> Ver. 41.42. Al&s;o, Act. viii. 27, Philip tells the Eunuch, if thou believe&s;t with all thine Heart, thou may&s;t [be baptized.] The Eunuch does not pronounce whether his Faith was &s;aving or not, but only profe&s;&s;es a Belief of that Foundation Truth, <HI>that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God,</HI> and on this Declaration he was baptized.</P>
<P>The Heathen are not immediately obliged to embrace the Chri&s;tian Religion, but fir&s;t to enquire into it; but &s;uch as are in&s;tructed and convinced in their Judgment and Con&s;cience of the Truth of Religion, are under a Nece&s;&s;ity of acting one Way or other about it, either to profe&s;s or reject it. This is one De&s;ign of the In&s;titution of Sacraments, that the Per&s;ons may be reduced to this Nece&s;&s;ity. What then &s;hall they do? If they apprehend they are &s;till unregenerate, &s;hall they, for that Rea&s;on, openly reject it? This is to go again&s;t the Dictates of
<PB N="43" REF="011997_0042_0F8920FD5DE47F10">
their own Con&s;ciences; or &s;hall they publickly profe&s;s their Belief of it, con&s;ent to its Obligation upon them, and re&s;olve to appear on the Side of Religion? One would think it very ea&s;y to decide on this Ca&s;e, and determine which Side was &s;afe&s;t, and attended with lea&s;t Guilt.</P>
<P>Arg. 2. All baptized Per&s;ons are, thereby, bound to perform all the Duties of true Chri&s;tians, as they &s;hall become capable and have Opportunity, both as to inter|nal Exerci&s;es, and external Actions. I &s;ay, as they &s;hall become capable; for the greater Part are baptized in Infancy. But the&s;e, as well as all others, are brought under the Bond of the Covenant. This &s;hould be early laid before them, to let them &s;ee, that, by this Dedicati|on to God, they are bound to perform all Duties of Re|ligion for which they have Capacity, to receive In&s;tructi|on, and appear for Religion as the Profe&s;&s;ors thereof. As &s;oon as they have a Competency of Knowledge, and are capable of the Di&s;cipline of the Church, they are bound to commemorate the Death of Chri&s;t, and renew their Engagements to him at his Table, unle&s;s regularly debarred by Di&s;cipline for unchri&s;tian Conduct. When they &s;hall become Parents, they are bound to dedicate their Children to God in Bapti&s;m. In one Word, they are bound to continue &s;tedfa&s;t in the Apo&s;tle's Doctrine and Fellow&s;hip, and in the breaking of Bread and Pray|er. To &s;ay that Bapti&s;m, even when received in Infancy, does not bind to all this, is to &s;ay, they are not bound by this Covenant to all Chri&s;tian Practice, till they come to the Lord's Table; that they are not obliged to con|&s;ider them&s;elves as Profe&s;&s;ors of Religion in Con&s;equence of their Bapti&s;m, and that they are not chargeable with Breach of Covenant in neglecting to appear for it, and &s;tanding back from the Lord's Supper; and that is, I think, to repre&s;ent Infant-Bapti&s;m as a Matter of no great Benefit or Importance. Or, are they hereby bound to
<PB N="44" REF="011997_0043_0F8920FE443DFFA0">
all other Chri&s;tian Duties, but not to come to the Lord's Table? Where is the Ground or Scripture Authority for that Di&s;tinction? Is there any Qualification requi&s;ite for this Duty; different in Kind from what is required in other Duties? Is not true Grace or Holine&s;s required in all other Duties, as well as this? And is not this Or|dinance among the <HI>all Things, what&s;oever he has commanded his Di&s;ciples,</HI> and which they are to be taught to ob&s;erve? Or, does the Unregeneracy of any, who, according to God's own In&s;titution, are vi&s;ible Members of his Church, nullify this Obligation, &s;o that their Omi&s;&s;ion of this Ordinance is not their Sin? If it be &s;aid, as indeed it frequently is, that they are, it's true, bound by the Di|vine Command, and Non-Attendance on the Lord's Table is their Sin; yet &s;uch is their Di&s;qualification, that they &s;in more, and contract greater Guilt by coming, than &s;taying away; &s;o that upon the whole, it is &s;afer for them to ab&s;tain. I an&s;wer, if there is any Weight in the Objection, it will hold equally with Re&s;pect to all the other Duties of Religion; for &s;uch are equally di&s;|qualified for the Performance of them; and &s;o the Un|regenerate are at once &s;et free from all Obligation, as vi&s;ible Church Members or baptized Per&s;ons, to the Law of God. A Con&s;equence, which I believe few, but the Di&s;ciples of Sandiman, will choo&s;e to admit; be&s;ides this Objection is Self-Contradictory. For if they Sin more in coming, and upon the whole it is &s;afer to ab&s;tain, it mu&s;t be, becau&s;e it is not the Will of God they &s;hould attempt to obey him with Re&s;pect to this Ordinance: They are excepted from the Command to ob&s;erve it; if &s;o, they are under no Obligation to ob&s;erve it. To ab&s;tain, is, therefore &s;o far from being their Sin, as this Objection &s;uppo&s;es, that it is their Duty, they do right. For to &s;uppo&s;e two contradictory Obligations to take Place at the &s;ame Time, by the &s;ame Law, is a gro&s;s Contradicti|on; for they either mutually de&s;troy each other, or, at lea&s;t, the one of them makes the other void. And to &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="45" REF="011997_0044_0F8920FED62AB2A8">
a pre&s;ent Obligation, and yet that the &s;afe&s;t Cour&s;e is to counteract or violate it, is a glaring Ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>Arg. 3. The Authority of God, in&s;tituting and ap|pointing Sacraments in his vi&s;ible Church, is the Ground and Rea&s;on of the Obligation on vi&s;ible Church Mem|bers to ob&s;erve them; and his Command to ob&s;erve them, is the Rule of their Duty, and not any internal Qualifi|cation in them. Therefore, all vi&s;ible Church-members are immediately obliged to attend upon them, let their internal State be what it will. The internal Qualification required in Attendance on Sacraments, cannot be the Ground or Condition of the Command to attend upon them; for God requires and commands the Qualification it&s;elf, however de&s;titute of it many may be. Surely he, who has a Right to command the Qualification, has a Right to command immediately and ab&s;olutely the Per|formance of the Duty it&s;elf, in which &s;uch Qualification is required, whether the Per&s;ons be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it or not. Con&s;equently, all who &s;hare in the vi&s;ible Character, to which the Sacraments, by Appointment belong; <HI>i. e.</HI> all vi&s;ible Church-Members, &s;tand immediately obliged to attend upon them, and that with the Qualification re|quired whether they actually have it or not. They &s;tand obliged to this in the &s;ame Manner, as they do to any other Duty of Religion: Now the Divine Command in the Ca&s;e is the Rule, the only Rule of their Duty; and if the Command extend to all vi&s;ible Church-members, then it is an explicit Rule which can be applied with Cer|tainty. But, upon this Principle, <HI>viz,</HI> that the Command to attend Sacraments is &s;o limited and qualified, as to ex|clude and prohibit all vi&s;ible Church-members who are unregenerate; it will be impo&s;&s;ible to apply it with Cer|tainty in many Ca&s;es; for then, the Rule of Interpreta|tion mu&s;t be &s;ome Judgment of People's internal States; but none, who&s;e Judgment de&s;erves any Notice, alledge that Church Officers can judge in that Ca&s;e, for they know not the Hearts of others, and therefore many Mini|&s;ters
<PB N="46" REF="011997_0045_0F89210068A89990">
don't require any Account of their Exerci&s;es from tho&s;e they admit; but only a Profe&s;&s;ion of having, &s;o far as they know their own Hearts, embraced Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and given them&s;elves up to God, upon which they are admitted, Now this Profe&s;&s;ion is only a Declaration of their Opinion or Judgment of their Exerci&s;es of Heart, or internal State. Con&s;equently, the Party's own Judg|ment, in this Ca&s;e, is the Rule of interpreting and ap|plying the Divine Command; and according to this, they are to conduct them&s;elves. In this Declaration, they place that Profe&s;&s;ion of true Religion, or their being vi|&s;ibly the People of God, which is required in Order to their Admi&s;&s;ion. But &s;urely, we have nothing made vi&s;ible here, but their Judgment of them&s;elves. Pray how does this render their Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion more vi&s;ible, than their acknowledging the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel as Divine Truths, and manife&s;ting their In|fluence, by a Practice agreeable to them? Nothing does this, &s;hort of publickly tran&s;acting a Covenant with God in the Way of his own Appointment; <HI>i. e.</HI> by partaking of the Signs and Seals of his Covenant. Such a Judg|ment of them&s;elves would be as precarious a Ground of Conduct to Per&s;ons in coming to Sacraments, as any Judgment formed of them would be to Church-officers in admitting them. For be&s;ides, that many judge favour|ably of them&s;elves without &s;ufficient Ground to &s;upport it, and &s;o mi&s;take their Ca&s;e; there are others, who, tho' really the Children of God, are in great Su&s;pence, and cannot determine on which Side the Evidence preponde|rates; while not a few, though at Sea&s;ons they have com|fortable Hopes, yet frequently labour under di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Apprehen&s;ions that they have nothing more than com|mon Grace. Upon this Footing, I think, Per&s;ons, who doubt of their gracious State, cannot with Safety come to Sacraments at all. For tho' they are told the Sacraments are appointed to &s;trengthen weak Faith, and cheri&s;h weak Grace; yet that is the great Matter in Que&s;tion, whe|ther
<PB N="47" REF="011997_0046_0F892101431AE818">
they have any true Grace. The mo&s;t plau&s;ible Thing that can be &s;aid to them is, that if upon impartial Self Examination, they find &s;tronger Ground of Hope than the contrary; they are to follow the &s;tronge&s;t Evi|dence. But here e'en to a Child of God, the Ground of Doubt may often &s;eem &s;tronge&s;t; and though at Times he may have Hopes, yet, perhaps, he more frequently fears his Hopes are fal&s;e; and in that Ca&s;e, he is told, he will contract greater Guilt by coming than &s;taying a|way. How then &s;hall he run &s;o awful a Ri&s;que, when he fears that is more probably his &s;ad Condition? Hence probably, yea, in many Ca&s;es doubtle&s;s, the exerci&s;ed Chri&s;tian is kept off, while the &s;ecure &s;elf flatterering Sinner comes forward; yea, the doubting Chri&s;tian can|not be certain, that the Command &s;o limited and qualified as afore&s;aid, includes him.</P>
<P>Arg. 4. If unregenerate vi&s;ible Church Members con|tract greater Guilt by ab&s;taining from Sacraments than in coming to them, then they ought not to ab&s;tain. But they do contract greater Guilt by ab&s;taining, therefore they ought not.</P>
<P>Here, to prevent Mi&s;takes, I would ob&s;erve, I mean coming in a con&s;cientious Manner, otherwi&s;e, if Per&s;ons &s;hould come to the Lord's Table merely to qualify for a civil Po&s;t, or in a profane Manner, they would contract much the greate&s;t Guilt in coming. This would be to eat and drink unworthily with a Witne&s;s, and to be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord; but to return,</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the major Propo&s;ition will not be denied by any. For if unregenerate vi&s;ible Church-Members con|tract greater Guilt by ab&s;taining, which is the &s;ame Thing as to &s;ay they &s;in more; then certainly in coming, from a Con&s;cience of Duty, attempting Obedience to the Divine Command, they are le&s;s &s;inful, and con&s;equently act more as they ought to do, than in omitting it. The only Thing, therefore, to be confirmed is the minor Pro|po&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="011997_0047_0F892101DA4718B8">That &s;uch unregenerate Sinners do &s;in more, and con|tract greater Guilt by ab&s;taining.</P>
<P>I readily grant, that by their Unbelief in &s;o &s;olemn a Tran&s;action, which in its very Nature &s;o &s;pecially re|quires Faith in Chri&s;t; they &s;in and contract great and ag|gravated Guilt. Their Want of Grace renders them alto|gether unacceptable to God, he di&s;approves them. The only Que&s;tion is, whether in ommitting, they do not &s;in yet more, and God does not more highly di&s;approve them?</P>
<P>Now, in order to decide on this Que&s;tion, let it be con|&s;idered, that it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ed God, when he in&s;tituted the&s;e Ordinances, left Men at Liberty to neglect them. All of the general Character to which the Sacraments are appointed, are obliged by their very In&s;titution to ob&s;erve them. But to &s;uppo&s;e it to be the Will of God, that &s;uch as are unregenerate, though vi&s;i|ble Church-Members, &s;hould not approach to Sacra|ments under the Notion of being di&s;qualified, is incon&s;i&s;t|ent with any pre&s;ent Obligation to attend upon them; and that is to &s;uppo&s;e that the In&s;titution of Ordinances obliges only when Men are &s;uitably di&s;po&s;ed towards them; their Want of Faith and other Graces &s;ets them free, &s;o that their Non-Attendance upon them adds no|thing to their Guilt; yea, in that they obey God and do quite right, which is an Ab&s;urdity, that, I believe, will meet with but &s;mall Reception; but if they are under a pre&s;ent and continual Obligation to attend upon the Sa|craments by Virtue of their authorative In&s;titution, then not to attend upon them is Di&s;obedience. In either Ca&s;e, a gracious Heart is wanting; but in the Omi&s;&s;ion of the external Duty, another In&s;tance of Di&s;obedience is added, keeping back the Heart is, as it were, avowed, and no Attempt is made to yield it up. Surely to act accord|ing to the Light of Con&s;cience, impre&s;&s;ed with a Sen&s;e of pre&s;ent Obligation, mu&s;t be le&s;s &s;inful, and infer le&s;s Guilt, than to go again&s;t the Dictates of Con&s;cience, and
<PB N="49" REF="011997_0048_0F89210297CB1080">
live in the Neglect of a known Duty. Even when Per&s;ons ab&s;tain, in a Sort, con&s;cientiou&s;ly from a Reverence of the Ordinance, and Con&s;ideration of their Unfitne&s;s, however that may extenuate the Guilt of their Omi&s;|&s;ion, yet &s;uch an Error in Judgment cannot alter the Nature of Things and take away all Addition to their Guilt thereby, or render their Conduct innocent.</P>
<P>But to neglect the Sacraments from a carele&s;s Neglect of Religion, and Unwillingne&s;s to come under &s;trict Obligations to it, is &s;inning with a high Hand. It is to &s;ay with proud Pharoah, who is the Lord, that I &s;hould obey his Voice? <HI>Rebellion is as the Sin of Witchcraft, and Stubbornne&s;s as Iniquity and Idolatry.</HI> 1 Sam. 15.23. Surely none will he&s;itate to determine, that a Con&s;cience impre&s;s'd with a Sen&s;e of Duty, and tenderly influen|cing to the Performance thereof, is better, and di&s;covers a le&s;s Degree of Wickedne&s;s and Impiety, than &s;uch a Contempt of Religion and &s;tubborn Temper of Mind. Thus, I think, the minor Propo&s;ition is confirm'd, and therefore the Conclu&s;ion &s;tands good.</P>
<P>Argument 5. That God &s;hould in&s;titute public Cove|nant Signs and Seals to be admini&s;ter'd in his Church, on purpo&s;e to bring the whole vi&s;ible Church, in the Celebration of them, to enter publicly into Covenant with him; and con&s;equently, require the whole vi&s;ible Church to attend upon them, is perfectly agreeable to his Conduct towards the Jewi&s;h Church in repeated In|&s;tances.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding their &s;acramental Covenant|ing in Circumci&s;ion and the Pa&s;&s;over, that Nation was exceedingly prone to Idolatry, which they mingled with the true wor&s;hip of the true God. Their Temptation hereto aro&s;e from the Practice of the Heathen Nations round about them. To prevent this, and in order to their avouching the Lord more explicitly as the only true God, and Renunciation of Idols, Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, Nehemiah and Ezra, undoubtedly by Divine Direction,
<PB N="50" REF="011997_0049_0F892104776B8BB8">
led the whole People to a verbal Covenant-Tran&s;action. Upon which I beg leave to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. That a holy cleaving to God with all the Heart; a gracious clo&s;ing in with, and con&s;enting to his Cove|nant, was as really, and as much requir'd in the&s;e Tran&s;|actions, as in coming to the Lord's Table. In this View Jo&s;hua &s;ets the Matter before the Congregation of I&s;rael. Jo&s;h. 24.19.20. <HI>And Jo&s;hua &s;aid unto the People, ye cannot &s;erve the Lord; for he is a holy God, he is a jealous God, he will not forgive your Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, nor your Sins. If ye for&s;ake the Lord and &s;erve &s;trange Gods, then he will turn and do you Hurt, and con&s;ume you, after that he has done you Good.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, con&s;ider the pure and holy Character of the great God with whom you have to do, in a very &s;olemn Manner; and con&s;equently, the Holine&s;s of that Service he demands of you, and now requires your Covenant Engagement to practi&s;e. It is no ea&s;y Matter to approve your&s;elves to him in this Af|fair: And terrible will be the Con&s;equence of turning a&s;ide from that con&s;tant holy Obedience he requires. In &s;hort, he &s;ets before them the Requi&s;itions of the great God in that Tran&s;action, in the &s;ame &s;olemn pun|gent Manner that Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are to do in admini&s;tring the Sacraments of the New-Te&s;tament.&mdash; It is not Holine&s;s in a diminutive Sen&s;e that he requires; it is the Holine&s;s of true Saints. Yet,</P>
<P N="2">2. He requires all I&s;rael to enter into this Covenant, and brings them under Engagements to this Holine&s;s, without &s;tanding to inquire whether they are already regenerated or not.&mdash;He does not admit them to this Covenant-Tran&s;action from a Judgment of their appear|ing to be regenerate, upon a previous Profe&s;&s;ion; but pre&s;&s;es upon them then to choo&s;e the Lord for their God, by an Induction of Facts, as &s;o many &s;triking Argu|ments to per&s;uade them; and their yielding and actually con&s;enting to the Covenant then propos'd, was it&s;elf the
<PB N="51" REF="011997_0050_0F89210502A46C10">
Profe&s;&s;ion of Holine&s;s they made. It was by that they appear'd to be a holy People.&mdash;No Doubt a Number of them were unregenerate, but Jo&s;hua does not con&s;ider that as an Ob&s;truction in the Way. He con&s;iders them as rightfully the Lord's, and however deprav'd in Con|&s;equence of their Apo&s;tacy, and the Forfeiture they were under, yet he ju&s;tly requires them to be holy; and upon this Principle, con&s;i&s;tently commands their Performance of all tho&s;e external Duties in which this Holine&s;s is profe&s;s'd, and required to be exercis'd: And con&s;equently, requires them to profe&s;s and engage to it in a &s;olemn Covenant-Tran&s;action.&mdash;By a Parity of Rea|&s;on, all this is &s;till requir'd of all vi&s;ible Church-Mem|bers, and they are con&s;i&s;tently requir'd to profe&s;s and engage to it. By the Participation of the Sacraments of the New-Te&s;tament. And in thus entering into Cove|nant, the vi&s;ible Church appears as much, and as really now to be a holy People, as I&s;rael did then. It is as much the Duty of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters now to lead forward the whole Church to Covenant-Tran&s;actions with God, in the &s;olemn Ordinances he has appointed for that very Purpo&s;e, as it was the Duty of Mo&s;es and others to bring the People of I&s;rael to &s;uch verbal Covenanting then, which imported the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion, and as much requir'd true Holine&s;s.</P>
<P>Argument 6. The &s;teady Attendance of all regular Members of the vi&s;ible Church upon the Sacraments of the New-Te&s;tament, greatly tends to promote, and give Efficacy to the Di&s;cipline of the Church; and thereby one great End of their In&s;titution will be obtain'd. Con&s;equently, it is the Will of God that all &s;uch &s;hould attend upon them.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erv'd, that the very Exi&s;tence and Efficacy of Di&s;cipline depends upon the Sacraments. The Weight of Cen&s;ure upon the Con&s;cience of an Offender ari&s;es from his con&s;idering the Enjoyment of
<PB N="52" REF="011997_0051_0F892106947E0860">
Sacraments, and &s;tanding among God's vi&s;ible Covenant-People as a great Privilege, which he wou'd otherwi&s;e have a Right to, but now is cut off from, in Con&s;equence of his own offen&s;ive Conduct.&mdash;But if he is taught, that as an unregenerate Per&s;on he would have no Right to them, were he never &s;o regular, or externally religi|ous; and that it is &s;o far from being a Privilege to him, that it would exceedingly increa&s;e his Guilt, &s;hould he dare to approach; then the Argument is lo&s;t. Upon that Principle, he is not cut off from any Thing he had a Right to, or had any Thing to do with. When a &s;candalous Per&s;on is judicially dealt with, and upon Conviction, Sentence is pronounc'd, viz. that, he is de|bar'd from the Lord's Table; what is done to him? In Con&s;equence of the In&s;truction he had all along receiv'd, he had no Tho'ts of a&s;king Admi&s;&s;ion. He ob&s;erves too, his very &s;ober Neighbour, who is not only orthodox in his Sentiments, but con&s;cientiou&s;ly religious in his Prac|tice, &s;tands off as unfit to come: Yea the Officers of the Church are not free to admit him, becau&s;e he appre|hends after all, he is unregenerate. Is it then any Blot upon him to be in the &s;ame Ca&s;e with his reputable Neighbour? Does the afore&s;aid Sentence bring any Evil upon him, more than he would be under without it?</P>
<P>Upon this Principle, that none but gracious Per&s;ons ought to approach, the Sacraments are con&s;ider'd as de|&s;ign'd to di&s;tingui&s;h between the regenerate and unrege|nerate Members of the vi&s;ible Church (which yet can never be done in this State) rather than as public Badges of Di&s;tinction between the vi&s;ibly holy and profane, the Church and the World. Hence not the vicious only, but con&s;cientious externally religious Per&s;ons, are kept off from Communion with the Church. Now pray, to what Cla&s;s of Mankind do the&s;e belong? They cannot well be number'd with the Heathen, or the openly wicked? They &s;ome how belong to the Church, yet
<PB N="53" REF="011997_0052_0F89210712443D30">
are not e&s;teem'd proper Members, and may not come to Sacraments more than the Heathen; how then can the Sacraments make Di&s;tinction between the Church and the World?&mdash;What does it &s;ignify to an ob&s;tinate Of|fender, who will not hear the Church, tho' you e&s;teem him as a heathen Man and a Publican, while he &s;ees &s;o many of his apparently religious Neighbours, upon the Matter, in the &s;ame Ca&s;e? thus Di&s;cipline is depre|ciated and weaken'd. But &s;urely this is not according to the Will of God; but rather that Conduct of vi&s;ible Church Members, which will maintain and &s;upport Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arguments, I think, abundantly confirm the Truth of what I am maintaining, viz. that all who are convinc'd of the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the Obligation of it's Duties, are immediately bound to join them&s;elves to the Lord and his Church; and all baptiz'd Per&s;ons, who have arrived to a competent Capacity, are bound to come to the Lord's Table.&mdash;I &s;hall conclude the whole with a few general Ob&s;er|vations.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervation 1. From what has been &s;aid we ob&s;erve, upon what footing the vi&s;ible Church is called a <HI>holy, a &s;pecial People to the Lord.</HI> Deut. 7.6, <HI>A holy Nation.</HI> Exod. 19.6, <HI>Holine&s;s to the Lord.</HI> Jer, 2.3. <HI>Saints.</HI> P&s;al. 79.2. and 89.5.7. And very commonly <HI>the Lord's People.</HI> It is from the Covenant-Tran&s;actions which have pa&s;&s;ed between God and them, whereby they &s;tand related to him, and dedicated to his Service for the Purpo&s;es of Holine&s;s: And not from any previous Appearance of Holine&s;s as the Ground of their Ad|mi&s;&s;ion thereto.&mdash;Whatever Awakenings, Humiliations, or Affections may be effected by the Word among&s;t Sin|ners, it is never to Purpo&s;e, until they reject Sin, and cleave to God by Covenant. And therefore, nothing &s;hort of public covenanting is a vi&s;ible Sign of Holi|ne&s;s,
<PB N="54" REF="011997_0053_0F89210928BC44B8">
as before ob&s;erv'd. From the Solemnity of &s;uch Tran&s;actions in their very Nature, and the affecting Ar|guments and Con&s;iderations u&s;ually urg'd on &s;uch Occa|&s;ions, Per&s;ons are commonly excited to much Seriou&s;ne&s;s, which exhibits a more &s;triking Appearance of Holine&s;s, than on any other Occa&s;ion.&mdash;Hence &s;aith the Lord, <HI>I remember thee, the Kindne&s;s of thy Youth, and the Love of thine E&s;pou&s;als, when thou wente&s;t after me in the Wilder|ne&s;s, in a Land that was not &s;own. I&s;rael was Holine&s;s to the Lord.</HI> Jer. 2.2.3.</P>
<P>Ob&s;. 2. We may hence ob&s;erve with what Propriety the &s;acred Scriptures require of all, who have been en|tered as Members of the vi&s;ible Church by Circumci&s;ion of old, or Bapti&s;m now, that they live to God in the Exerci&s;e of univer&s;al Holine&s;s of Heart and Life; and urge it by all the Arguments belonging to the Character of God's Children: Such as that he is their God; they are his People; the Redemption of Chri&s;t; the rich Grace and Love of God; and the Glories of Heaven. &mdash;The great God addre&s;&s;es them in his Word, not ac|cording to his Knowledge of their real internal State as the Searcher of Hearts, but according to their external Character and vi&s;ible Appearance, and the Obligations they are bro't under. Hence their Sins are highly ag|gravated, and deeply re&s;ented as a Contradiction to their public Character; and &s;o reflecting great Di&s;honour upon the Name and Ways of God. I&s;a. 63, 8, 9, 10. <HI>For he &s;aid &s;urely they are</HI> MY PEOPLE, CHILDREN, THAT WILL NOT LIE, <HI>&s;o he was their Saviour. In all their Affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Pre&s;ence &s;aved them: In his Love and in his Pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the Days of Old, But they</HI> REBELLED <HI>and</HI> VEXED <HI>his holy Spirit: Therefore he was turned to be</HI> THEIR ENEMY, <HI>and he</HI> FOUGHT <HI>again&s;t them.</HI> It is re&s;ented as exceed|ingly offen&s;ive, that I&s;rael walked in the <HI>Statutes of the
<PB N="55" REF="011997_0054_0F89210A0DC60FE0">
Heathen;</HI> and aggravated from this Circum&s;tance, that it was again&s;t the Lord THEIR GOD. 2 Kin. 17.8.9. and that hereby, they rejected <HI>his Statutes</HI> and HIS COVENANT. V. 15.</P>
<P>Ob&s;. 3. We may &s;ee from what has been &s;aid, the Propriety, and Nece&s;&s;ity there is that the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hould, in the Di&s;pen&s;ation of God's Word, di&s;tingui&s;h Characters, and Addre&s;s them to the Con&s;ci|ences of Men. For tho' their public Character is that of Saints, God's Children &amp;c, and accordingly all the Holine&s;s of Saints is demanded of them; yet the Word of God a&s;&s;ures us there are Hypocrites in Zion, Branch|es in Chri&s;t which are withered, fooli&s;h Virgins among&s;t the wi&s;e, and Tares growing among the Wheat, in the be&s;t State of the Church here below. Tho' the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e, per|&s;onally from true Saints, yet they can di&s;tingui&s;h the Characters which de&s;cribe the one and the other, where|by the Con&s;ciences of Men may be enabled to di&s;cern their own proper Character. It is one Thing to be vi&s;ibly a Child of Abraham, and another to walk in the &s;aving Faith of Abraham. One Thing to be a vi&s;ible Saint, another to be really one in the Sight of the Heart-&s;earching God. Therefore, Profe&s;&s;ors had need to look well to them&s;elves; and examine, and <HI>know them&s;elves whether they be in the Faith, and Chri&s;t be in them.</HI> And not re&s;t in this, that they have <HI>Abraham to their Father.</HI> Hence John the Bapti&s;t dealt in &s;o &s;olemn and awakening a Manner with tho&s;e he baptiz'd. Mat. 3.7.8.9.10, 11.12. In like Manner, let every Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter acquit him&s;elf. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON REGENERATION, Wherein the Principle of Spiritual Life, thereby implanted, is particularly con&s;i|der'd.</HEAD>
<P>AS no Truth is more intere&s;ting and important, &s;o none has been more frequently and fully treated in a practical View, by pious Writers, than the Doctrine of Regeneration. Many have, in this Way, very excellently and largely de&s;cribed the happy Change, which, by Virtue of the &s;upernatural Work of the holy Spirit, takes Place in the whole Man. I have therefore no De&s;ign at pre&s;ent to enter upon a full Con&s;ideration of the Subject; but &s;hall only beg Leave to make a few very brief Ob&s;ervations, &s;ome of which have not been &s;o particularly con&s;ider'd in practical Treati&s;es, but yet, perhaps, may be of &s;ome U&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the right Apprehen&s;ion of, and tend to prevent Mi&s;takes about a Doctrine, which lies &s;o much at the Foundation of all true Religion,</P>
<P>Ob&s;erv. 1. Regeneration is the Communication of a Principle of Spiritual Life to the Soul of a Sinner, na|turally dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, by the Agency of the holy Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="011997_0056_0F89210AD9141EC8">I call it a Principle, not only becau&s;e it is a Beginning of Spiritual Life, but e&s;pecially, becau&s;e it denotes a &s;ettled Determination of the Mind to right Activity to|wards &s;piritual Objects, under a moral Con&s;ideration of them, whence re&s;ults every right Exerci&s;e of Heart about divine Things.&mdash;It is the Determination of the Soul to a holy Activity about God and divine Things, or to &s;uch a Kind of Action; not from the Impul&s;ion of an external Force, but an internal active Principle: And therefore is ju&s;tly call'd Life. Life of the mo&s;t excellent Kind. It is the Life of Life.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is &s;ome Di&s;tinction between a natural and a moral Principle of Action. the former lies in the very E&s;&s;ence of the Being to which it belongs, or is a Determination to &s;ome particu|lar Kind of Action re&s;ulting from it's Frame or Con&s;titution. Thus Self-Activity, or natural Life, which is e&s;&s;ential to the Soul, is a Principle of Action in general. A Determination to particu|lar Kinds of natural Action, &s;uch as we call In&s;tinct in Brutes, or Rea&s;on in Men, ari&s;es immediately from the Exi&s;tence of natural Faculties, or &s;omething in the Frame or Con&s;titution of Crea|tures re&s;pectively. But a moral Principle is a Determination to &s;ome particular Kind of Action, ari&s;ing from &s;ome &s;ettled Judg|ment or Sentiment in which the Will acquie&s;ces. Thus a Principle of holy Action is the fix'd Impre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome &s;piritual Truth or Truths upon the Heart.</NOTE></P>
<P>But as our Apo&s;tacy from God has fixed in us, by Nature, a very contrary Determination, to a Cour&s;e of &s;inful Action; therefore, while that continues (which will be till &s;ome Power &s;ubdue it) there can be no Ten|dency in the Soul to an holy Temper. The Power of the Soul to any Activity lies formally in the Will. Hence it's whole Power, by Nature, is to &s;in, and to reject God: For <HI>the carnal Mind is Enmity again&s;t him.</HI> Rom. 8.7. Con&s;equently &s;ome other Power mu&s;t be exerted in Order to break this evil Determination, and reduce the rebellious Creature to a right Temper. And that mu&s;t be a Power that has Dominion over the Will. This new Determination, therefore, is from the Almighty
<PB N="58" REF="011997_0057_0F89210B94EF7770">
Agency of the holy Spirit, it is he that communicates this new Principle of Life. Accordingly it is every where a&s;cribed to him in Scripture. John 3.3.&mdash;5. and 6.63. Tit. 3.5.</P>
<P>Ob&s;. 2. This Principle of Spiritual Life and the Manner of it's Communication are not immediately in them&s;elves perceptible.</P>
<P>As Adam did not perceive when God breath'd into his No&s;trils the Breath of natural Life, but perceiv'd it's Exi&s;tence and Nature from it's Activity and Effects: So the Exi&s;tence and Nature of &s;piritual Life are known only by the Experience the Chri&s;tian has of it's Exerci&s;e and Efficacy. in this View, our Lord ob&s;erves, Joh. 3.8. <HI>The Wind bloweth where it li&s;teth, and thou heare&s;t the Sound thereof, but can&s;t not tell whence it cometh, or whi|ther it goeth:</HI> So is <HI>every one that is born of the Spirit.</HI> There are, indeed, who greatly abu&s;e this Pa&s;&s;age, thence flattering them&s;elves, that they may be the Sub|jects of Regeneration without perceiving any great Change in their Hearts and Lives. But this is not only foreign to the Sen&s;e of the Place, but Contradictory to it. For the Wind is very &s;en&s;ibly perceiv'd. The De&s;ign of our Lord &s;eems to be to remove Nicodemus's Sur|pri&s;e at the My&s;teriou&s;ne&s;s of the Doctrine, by &s;hewing him it is a &s;upernatutal Work, perform'd by the holy Spirit as a gracious Sovereign: To which the Sinner him&s;elf is &s;o far from contributing any Thing, that he is not &s;o much as &s;en&s;ible of the Article of Communi|cation, nor perceives the Manner of the holy Spirit's Operation. Q. d. There are My&s;teries in Nature which you cannot account for. You cannot immediately per|ceive the Origin of the Wind, nor account for its cea&s;|ing when once in Motion, or perceive the Rea&s;on why it continually, and often very &s;uddenly Changes it's Di|rection. You hear the Sound, and feel the Effects, but it is only by Ob&s;ervations on the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, either
<PB N="59" REF="011997_0058_0F89210C53DBB1C8">
made by your&s;elf, or &s;ugge&s;ted by others, that you can infer any Conclu&s;ions about it's Nature or Cau&s;es. Why then &s;hould you be &s;urpris'd to find My&s;teries in the Manner of divine Operations, when performing Works of Grace? In this new Birth, a Man can only perceive the Exerci&s;es of divine Life in his Heart; and by Scrip|tural Ob&s;ervations on the&s;e, infer what Sort of a Life he lives, or form Conclu&s;ions about it's Nature and Principle. For any one therefore, to pretend to tell what the Principle of divine Life is, antecedent to all Exerci&s;es of Life in the Heart, and undertake from thence to demon&s;trate and explain tho&s;e Exerci&s;es, is a vain Attempt. When he di&s;tingui&s;hes this Life from all its Exerci&s;es, and goes about to tell us what it is antecedent to them all, he mu&s;t talk in the Dark about a certain &s;omething, of which he has no Idea. To give it a Name, to call it, for In&s;tance, a new Temper or Ta&s;te, is not to tell us what it is. Let any Man explain what he means by a new or holy Temper, without in|cluding &s;ome Exerci&s;e of Life in the Heart, if he can.</P>
<P>Ob&s;. 3. Regeneration and Conver&s;ion, &s;trictly taken, are not di&s;tinct Things; but the&s;e different Denomina|tions, expre&s;s the &s;ame Thing under different Views.</P>
<P>I &s;ay Conver&s;ion &s;trictly taken. For largely taken, it includes the fir&s;t Exerci&s;es of the &s;everal Graces of the holy Spirit, which are but the various Modifications of the &s;ame Principle of Spiritual Life, &s;uch as a ju&s;tifying Faith, Hope, Joy, Zeal, Sorrow for Sin, &amp;c. From which Regeneration (tho' the Term is often al&s;o u&s;ed in the &s;ame Latitude, yet) is &s;o di&s;tinct in a &s;trict Sen&s;e, as to be altogether antecedent, not only in the Order of Nature, but of Time too.&mdash;But &s;trictly taken, Con|ver&s;ion is the actual Submi&s;&s;ion or turning of the Soul to God in the mo&s;t &s;imple Notion of it. This may per|haps, lie in the Soul's &s;ubmitting it&s;elf into the Hands of divine Sovereignty, as mo&s;t fitly having a Right to do

with him as he plea&s;es: Or in a &s;upreme Regard to God as a mo&s;t glorious Being, and rightful Lord. Now this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;idered as the Effect of the holy Spirit's Agen|cy, enabling, or cau&s;ing the Soul to turn to God, is cal|led Regeneration; but when con&s;idered as an Activity e&s;&s;ential to &s;piritual Life, and formally as the Soul's Act, it is called Conver&s;ion; but the&s;e are only different Views, and Re&s;pects of the &s;ame Thing. For Regeneration undoubtedly denotes a moral Effect produced by the Spi|rit of God. But this Effect, which he produces, is the Soul's turning to God. Surely nothing &s;hort of this can be called the new Birth. Regeneration is the Implantation of Holine&s;s in the Heart. Now certainly, there can be no real Holine&s;s without turning to God, The Soul that has not turned to God, is &s;till, without Controver&s;y un|regenerate. Hence it follows,</P>
<P>Ob&s;. 4. That this Principle wrought in the Soul in Regeneration, is not &s;omething antecedent to every Act and Exerci&s;e of Holine&s;s, but includes in it, or is a fir&s;t Act or Exerci&s;e of Holine&s;s, of the &s;ame Nature with all the Exerci&s;es of Holine&s;s that follow after, through the Cour&s;e of Life.</P>
<P>To cau&s;e Life is to cau&s;e Action; for Activity is e&s;|&s;ential to the Idea of Life. When the holy Spirit regene|rates a Sinner, he communicates an active Principle, o|therwi&s;e it were not Life. But to talk of an active Prin|ciple exi&s;ting in the Soul ab&s;olutely without Action, would be a Contradiction; now this Action mu&s;t be cleav|ing to God. Hence ari&s;es,</P>
<P>Ob&s;. 5. A fifth Ob&s;ervation, <HI>viz.</HI> that this Principle of &s;piritual Life con&s;i&s;ts in, or includes &s;ome new View of the Mind, and Determination or Approbation of the Will.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e, becau&s;e it is a moral Principle; otherwi&s;e, it could not be the Principle of a Cour&s;e of moral Action; when therefore, a Principle of &s;piritual Life is implanted, a moral Effect is produced; but that Effect
<PB N="61" REF="011997_0060_0F89210E5D8F2380">
which includes no Acts of the Under&s;tanding and Will, but is ab&s;olutely antecedent to them, mu&s;t be a mere phy&s;ical, and not a moral Effect, and then to regenerate, would be to create in a phy&s;ical, not a moral Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>I think, the &s;acred Scriptures &s;et the Matter in the &s;ame Light with the above Ob&s;ervation. Sometimes this happy Change is expre&s;&s;ed by the Term Light. Eph v. 8. <HI>Ye were &s;ometimes</HI> DARKNESS, <HI>but now are ye</HI> LIGHT <HI>in the Lord.</HI> Sometimes it is repre&s;ented under the Notion of being made willing. P&s;al. cx. 3. <HI>Thy Peo|ple &s;hall be</HI> WILLING <HI>in the Day of thy Power.</HI> Either of the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions includes the other. Thus when the regenerate are called <HI>Light,</HI> the Matter is not confined to the Under&s;tanding only, but includes the Approbation of the Will, and to be willing, certainly, includes the View of the Under&s;tanding; for there can be no Act of the Will without it; &s;ometimes both are &s;et in View together, as Acts xxvi. 18. <HI>To open their Eyes, and to turn them from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God,</HI> Certainly to open the Eyes and turn from Darkne&s;s to Light, is to enlighten. the Under&s;tanding, and to turn to God is an Act of the Will. To the &s;ame Purpo&s;e is 2 Cor. iv. 6. <HI>For God hath &s;hined into our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> To &s;ee the Glory of God, mu&s;t include both the View of the Under&s;tanding, and the Approbati|on of the Will. It is no Objection to this, to &s;ay, the&s;e Scriptures &s;peak of this Change largely taken. For ad|mitting that, yet it is not by Way of Contra-di&s;tinction from, or exclu&s;ive of the fir&s;t In&s;tance; but the fir&s;t Exi&s;t|ence of Life comes under the &s;ame Predicament. Thus they, who were &s;ometimes Darkne&s;s, are not &s;aid to be enlightened only but to be <HI>Light.</HI> God in the new Cre|ation, &s;hines into the Heart, in a Manner analogous to his &s;hining in the natural World, when he created Light in it. It is very ea&s;y to &s;ay, that in Regeneration, a holy
<PB N="62" REF="011997_0061_0F89210EDC3056D0">
Temper is produced whence this Knowledge and Voli|tion ari&s;e; but perhaps, it would not be &s;o ea&s;y to tell, in that Connection, what we are to under&s;tand by that Temper. Surely we are not to conceive of a moral, in the &s;ame Manner as of a natural Temper. In the Latter, we take into the Con&s;ideration &s;uch a certain, yet various Con&s;truction of the human Frame, as is apt to produce &s;uch and &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ions and Feelings of Nature. Now, if we have an Idea of the Former any Thing like this, we mu&s;t then con&s;ider it only as a new Faculty created in the Soul, and has nothing moral in it, any more than the Under|&s;tanding or Will con&s;idered as natural Faculties. But if we conceive of it as a moral Determination of the Soul towards God, then we mu&s;t con&s;ider it as including &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion of God in the Under&s;tanding, and an Act of the Will embracing him, which brings the Matter to what I have &s;aid. Thus we are, as it were in&s;en&s;ibly led to &s;ome Apprehen&s;ion of what this divine Principle is, or wherein it con&s;i&s;ts, tho' we cannot comprehend the Manner of the holy Spirit's Operation in producing it, or explain how it exi&s;ts. It is an experimental practical Knowledge of God, or it is a new View of the infinite Perfections of God, with the Approbation of them in the Will as mo&s;t excellent; or, which is, indeed, the &s;ame Thing under its proper Denomination, it is a &s;upreme Love to God: Supreme Love to God, is the very E&s;&s;ence of true Religi|on. Hence it is called <HI>the fulfilling of the Law.</HI> Rom. xiii. 10. Our Lord mentions Love to God and our Neighbour as the Sum and Sub&s;tance of the whole Law. Mat. xxii. 37, 38, 39, 40. No Action can be called true Obedience, if it don't flow from Love to God, and every Exerci&s;e of true Grace may be reduced to this as its Principle.</P>
<P>Ob&s;. 6. The holy Spirit makes u&s;e of the Word of God as a Mean in the Work of Regeneration, which he renders irre&s;i&s;tably efficacious for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="011997_0062_0F89211068243AD8">I am far from thinking with the Arminians, that the only Influence of the holy Spirit in this Matter lies in what they call moral Sua&s;ion; that is, as I under&s;tand it. The holy Spirit having &s;et before us the Arguments and Motives of the Go&s;pel in the Word, both by his Providence, and an Influence upon the Mind, excites its Attention to the&s;e Things, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts the natural Facu|ties in weighing tho&s;e Arguments and Motives, and thus &s;trives to per&s;uade the Sinner to a Compliance with Go&s;pel Overtures, but &s;till leaves it with him&s;elf to yield to, or reject tho&s;e Arguments by a &s;overeign Act of his own Will. According to this, it is only an objective Light that is &s;et before Mind, as contained in the Word; a Repre&s;entation of Objects, as yet at a Di&s;tance, of which the Mind has no Knowledge but by the Report and De&s;cription of the Word; and perhaps the mo&s;t, if not all the Light, which is u&s;ually call'd common Illu|mination, may be obtained this Way.</P>
<P>Nor can I agree with &s;ome, even eminent Calvini&s;tic Divines, that there is only a gradual Difference between common and &s;aving Illumination; I believe there is a &s;pecific Difference; there is in Regeneration a &s;ubjective Light created in the Soul, which, tho' it is the Know|ledge of a glorious Object pre&s;ented to the Mind, yet may fitly be called &s;ubjective in Re&s;pect of the Manner of its Communication, as contra-di&s;tingui&s;h'd from, tho' not oppo&s;ed to the mere objective Light of the Word before de&s;cribed; it is an immediate intuitive Sen&s;e, or Know|ledge of the moral Perfections and Character of God, not gained by Way of Conclu&s;ion from Premi&s;es or by Argumentation, but ari&s;ing from the Approach of God to the Soul, by Way of gracious Pre&s;ence; he thus takes Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Heart, and fills it with a Sen&s;e of him&s;elf by his Pre&s;ence in a peculiar Manner; and this is a Way of knowing, very different from that received merely by the De&s;cription and Report of the Word;
<PB N="64" REF="011997_0063_0F892110D2691E98">
and therefore a different Kind of Knowledge, <HI>viz.</HI> by Way of &s;piritual Sen&s;e and Experience.&mdash;Tho' we cannot perceive or explain the Manner of this divine Pre&s;ence or Acce&s;s to the Soul; yet the Fact is abundantly wit|ne&s;&s;ed by the Experience of God's People; notwith|&s;tanding, they have an habitual &s;piritual Knowledge of God and divine Truths, yet, at one Sea&s;on, they are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with Darkne&s;s, and cannot get any proper Views of God; at another, they &s;hall be full of Light, and a&s;toni&s;hed with the View of divine Glory; now what is the Rea&s;on of this va&s;t Difference? &s;urely, not from any Difference in the objective Light of the Word, or their Capacity to meditate upon it. But the Rea&s;on of it is, the Ab&s;ence of God in the one Ca&s;e, and his glo|rious Pre&s;ence in the other; therefore, their fir&s;t &s;uch Knowledge of God was from &s;uch an Approach to the Soul, or divine Pre&s;ence in it. And for the Reality of this Experience in God's People, I refer to the Account the &s;acred Scriptures give us&punc; &s;ometimes of their bitter Com|plaints of God's hiding him&s;elf, and panting for him as the Hart for the Water Brooks; at other Times, of their rejoicing in his Beauty and Glory, with which they are, as it were tran&s;ported; and, I think the&s;e Words of Job, xlii. 5. <HI>I have heard of thee by the Hearing of the Ear, but now mine Eye &s;eeth thee,</HI> fully ju&s;tify this Di&s;tincti|on of objective and &s;ubjective Knowledge; for admit that the De&s;ign of the Words is to repre&s;ent the very lively Views he had of the divine Excellency, &s;o that compa|ratively &s;peaking, all his former, even experimental Views were but like Report; yet, by a Parity of Rea&s;on there is a va&s;t Difference between Experience in the lowe&s;t Degree and Report; and he goes upon this Principle, That Report, or by the Hearing of the Ear, is a very languid and imperfect Way of knowing, com|pared with Sight and intimate Acquaintance. The&s;e are very different Kinds of Knowledge, as different as
<PB N="65" REF="011997_0064_0F892112F746F488">
Knowledge a Man has of a Country from an hi&s;tori|cal Account and Map of it, or the Report of Travellers; and that he has from travelling through, and &s;eeing it him&s;elf. Thus then, by this Pre&s;ence of God in the Soul, it has a Knowledge of him, which it could not po&s;&s;ibly have without it, by the mo&s;t animated De&s;cripti|ons and Repre&s;entations of the Word. It was thus, even innocent Adam knew the moral Character and Excellen|cy of God, not only by objective Evidence from without, but al&s;o by &s;ubjective Evidence, from his Experience of the divine Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>But all this does not exclude moral Influence by Way of Argument, the Arguments contained in the Word; but rather accounts for their irre&s;i&s;table Efficacy. Tho' mere moral Sua&s;ion will not do the Bu&s;ine&s;s, yet it is not excluded; it is a moral Effect that is to be produced;&mdash; therefore, it is natural enough to expect that the Power producing it &s;hould be exerted in a moral Way; and con&s;equently, a moral Mean with great Propriety be admitted.</P>
<P>That this Matter may be better apprehended, I beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that the ble&s;&s;ed God mu&s;t be exhibited to the Mind as an Object of Contemplation, in order to any Act of the Will towards him. The Will approves him as mo&s;t fit and worthy to be cho&s;en, which mu&s;t be founded upon the Contemplation of him in the Mind. Length of Time is not, indeed, nece&s;&s;ary for this Pur|po&s;e. The Operations of the Mind are very quick.&mdash; Were we to &s;uppo&s;e an Adult, who had no Opportunity of the Word, to be regenerated; no Doubt, a Reflection upon his own intuitive Perceptions would exhibit the ble&s;&s;ed God to the Mind, as an Object of Contemplation. For it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e a new Heart to exi&s;t in an adult Per&s;on without any Ideas of God and divine Things in the Under&s;tanding; for that is to &s;uppo&s;e a Per&s;on regenerated, and yet altogether ignorant of God; to

turn to God without any Knowledge of him, which, I think, is a Contradiction, and the &s;ame Thing as to &s;ay, a Man is changed without any Alteration; the Thief on the Cro&s;s &s;eems to be an In&s;tance of the Contrary: Tho' he lived in the Land of Judea, and had Opportunity of the Word of God, it is not probable a Man of his aban|doned Character &s;ought any con&s;iderable Acquaintance with it; yet his Speech to his Fellow-Criminal, and his Addre&s;s to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hewed very con&s;iderable Di&s;|coveries of God, and the Character of his Saviour.</P>
<P>But let it be con&s;ider'd, that with Re&s;pect to Sinners who live under the Means of Grace and enjoy the Word of God, tho', by Rea&s;on of their E&s;trangement from God, they have no proper Views of divine Truths, yet their Under&s;tandings are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome general &s;pe|culative Knowledge of them: yea, convinced Sinners have more, they have &s;uch an experimental Knowledge of the Law convincing them of Sin, as is effectual to arou&s;e them out of their fatal Security, and confute their fal&s;e Notions, and awaken them to a very &s;olemn Atten|tion to the Word of God.&mdash;Now in Regeneration, the intuitive Views, impre&s;&s;ed on the Mind by the divine Pre&s;ence, are exactly the &s;ame with the De&s;criptions and Delineations of the divine Character in the Word. The Mind therefore, in&s;tead of reflecting immediately upon its own Perceptions, looks forward to the Word. Now the Man's Eyes are opened, and he under&s;tands the Scrip|ture in a Manner he never could before; there he &s;ees this glorious Object repre&s;ented as in a Gla&s;s; from thence the Reflection is &s;o &s;trong and lively as irre&s;i&s;tably, tho' in a moral Way, to determine the Will; for &s;urely, it is very apprehen&s;ible, that the Views of the Mind may be &s;o experimental, &s;trong, and full of Evidence, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a rational Being to with-hold the Approbation and Con&s;ent of the Will; and thus this divine Temper is formed in the Heart: In this Point of

Light, I think, the Apo&s;tle &s;ets the Matter, ii Cor. 3.18. <HI>But we all with open Face, beholding,</HI> AS IN A GLASS, <HI>the Glory of the Lord, are</HI> CHANGED INTO THE SAME IMAGE, <HI>from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> Tho' the&s;e Words comprehend the gradual per|fecting the Image of God, in the Progre&s;s of the Work of Grace; yet certainly the fir&s;t Step of the Proce&s;s is in the &s;ame Way with all the &s;ub&s;equent, in the whole Series. Nor does the U&s;e of the Gla&s;s at all derogate from the Efficiency of the Spirit, in cau&s;ing and conducting this whole Matter; and, indeed, there is as really an immediate Agency of the Spirit upon the Soul, in every progre&s;|&s;ive perfecting of the Image of God, and every In&s;tance of the quickening of Grace in Believers (where yet the concurring In&s;trumentality of the Word, notwith&s;tanding, is acknowleged) as there is in the fir&s;t begetting of the divine Life.</P>
<P>Here I would take Notice, how very different this View of divine Illumination is from the wild Conceits of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts; their pretended extraordinany Di&s;coveries and In&s;pirations con&s;i&s;t in unaccountable Impul&s;es with|out the Word, the warm Flights of Imagination, and Agitation of their Pa&s;&s;ions; in all this they either have no Reference to the Word of God, but rather &s;et light by it in Compari&s;on of their own great Light; or el&s;e in pre|tending to the Word, put incon&s;i&s;tent ridiculous Con|&s;tructions upon it;&mdash;but the&s;e intuitive Views of God, I mentioned as primarily ari&s;ing from his Pre&s;ence in the Soul, are but the Impre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch Truths as the Word of God de&s;cribes; they lead to the Scriptures, and give a rational con&s;i&s;tent View of them; this Light is tried and judged by the Word of God: <HI>To the Law and to the Te&s;timony, if they &s;peak not according to this Word, it is becau&s;e there is no Light in them.</HI> I&s;a. viii. 20.</P>

Pet. 1.4. and to be made Partakers of the divine Na|ture is to be regenerated; another Pa&s;&s;age, is Jam. i. 18. <HI>Of his own Will begat he us with [or by] the Word of Truth.</HI> The Word here u&s;ed, cannot, with any Propriety, I think, be under&s;tood of any Thing el&s;e than the fir&s;t Infu&s;ion or begetting of &s;piritual Life; when this is &s;aid to be done with, or by the Word, it mu&s;t intend that it is u&s;ed as an In&s;trument or Mean; in this View, this ble&s;&s;ed Change is expre&s;&s;ed, by <HI>putting God's Law in the inward Parts, and writing it in the Heart.</HI> Jer. xxxi. 33.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s the Holy Spirit could as ea&s;ily accompli&s;h this great Work without u&s;ing any Mean; yet as it ap|pears very plain, he has cho&s;en to do otherwi&s;e; we may not only &s;uppo&s;e, but readily &s;ee great Propriety in his making u&s;e of the Word in this Matter: This Change is to be tried and judged of by the Word; therefore mu&s;t an&s;wer to the De&s;criptions and Characters there given, as the Impre&s;&s;ion on the Wax an&s;wers to the Characters of the Seal. The Views of God in the Mind mu&s;t be &s;uch as exactly agree to the De&s;criptions and Repre&s;enta|tions of him in the Word.

<P>From this View of the divine Character in the en|lightened Mind, naturally ari&s;es a Di&s;covery of the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's Satisfaction to divine Ju&s;tice, and the Fitne&s;s and Glory of that Way of Reconciliation with God. Hence Faith in Chri&s;t. This Plan of Mercy &s;till more illu&s;trates the Glory of the divine Character; for it &s;hines in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; by the&s;e Views of Faith, &s;piritual Affections are excited, Sorrow for, and Hatred again&s;t Sin rai&s;ed; hence an habitual Watchful|ne&s;s again&s;t Sin and Oppo&s;ition to it, and Delight in the Service of God; and all this infers a great and perma|nent Change in the whole Cour&s;e of Life and Action; but practical Writers have abundantly explained and de|&s;cribed the&s;e Things; to whom I refer my Readers, and &s;hall in&s;i&s;t no further upon them here.</P>

While we are warmly intere&s;ted in deciding the &s;peculative Di&s;pute, we are apt to forget the practi|cal Con&s;ideration of the important Subject, and the Ap|plication of it to our&s;elves; and tho&s;e who attend to us are led to treat the Matter in the &s;ame Manner; by this Means the Intere&s;ts of vital Piety langui&s;h. While we ju&s;tly lament the low State of experimental Religion, to devote our&s;elves to the&s;e &s;peculative Refinements will not be found the Way to revive it. Experience will always &s;hew, that to keep up a practical View of divine Truths, and the &s;olemn Application of them in &s;erious pungent Addre&s;&s;es to the Con&s;cience, is the be&s;t calculated for that Purpo&s;e. Be&s;ides, if we lay down, by Way of Hopothe&s;is, a certain &s;omething, of which we can have no Idea (as of a Principle of Life, antecedent to all Exerci&s;es of Life, we cannot; nor can we infer any Conclu&s;ions about its Nature from any Exerci&s;es of the Heart, if it include neither Idea nor Volition, but is &s;omething ab&s;olutely antecedent to both) then we &s;hall be in Danger of a Su|per&s;tructure, as unintelligible as the Ba&s;is upon which we build. Thus &s;ome have wildly dreamed, that the Principle of &s;piritual Life may exi&s;t in the Soul without any Act or Exerci&s;e of Life, as a Ta&s;te, which lies dor|mant until a proper Object be applied to it; and if it may exi&s;t thus one Moment, why not Two? and if Two, why not a Minute? and &s;o on, till they bring the Suppo|&s;ition to Hours, Days, Months, and Years; and &s;o a rege|nerate Per&s;on may &s;till continue an Unbeliever, and of Con&s;equence, in an unju&s;tified State: And I &s;ee not why it would not be as ea&s;y to continue the Suppo&s;ition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Death, and &s;o &s;end him to Hell, with his dormant Prin|ciple along with him.

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE MEANS of GRACE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE great God &s;tands in no Need of Means, in or|der to accompli&s;h his Purpo&s;es. He could, if he plea&s;ed, cau&s;e all Events he &s;ees meet to effect, to come to pa&s;s in the &s;ame Way he cau&s;ed the World at fir&s;t to exi&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> by the Word of his Power or Sovereign Act of his Will; yet it does not at all derogate from his Effi|ciency, but rather &s;erves to illu&s;trate his Power, to u&s;e Means, becau&s;e all their Efficacy upon the Effect, is from him. Accordingly it has plea&s;ed him, that rational Crea|tures might more di&s;tinctly ob&s;erve his Works, to u&s;e Means, and appoint a Connection between them and the End in View, both in the natural and moral World; yet &s;uch a Connection as always depends upon the divine Plea|&s;ure. Means are effectual or ineffectual, as he affords or withholds his Concurrence&mdash;particularly, in the Admini|tion of his moral Government, he deals with the Sub|jects thereof in a Way &s;uited to their rational Natures, and u&s;es Means of a moral Nature, in carrying on the In|tere&s;ts
<PB N="74" REF="011997_0072_0F892119425296D8">
of Religion in our degenerate World. To this Purpo&s;e, he has given his holy Word, appointed a Go&s;|pel Mini&s;try and Ordinances of Wor&s;hip, &s;uch as the Sa|craments of the New-Te&s;tament, Prai&s;e and Prayer.</P>
<P N="2">II. The&s;e Divines commonly call Means, not of In|&s;truction only, but of Grace; the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e it is in the U&s;e of the&s;e Means, the holy Spirit, ordinarily communicates or be&s;tows Grace on Sinners, and builds up his Children in Holine&s;s, until he brings them &s;afe Home to Glory. Now, whatever can be con&s;idered as a Mean with Reference to an End, mu&s;t have &s;ome Tendency to, and, in its own Way, have Influence upon, or con|cur in attaining it; for that which has no &s;uch Tendency or Influence, has no Manner of Connection with the Ex|i&s;tence or Accompli&s;hment of the End; and con&s;equently is no Means of it at all. If therefore, the&s;e Ordinances are Means of Grace, they mu&s;t have a Tendency to, and in the Hand of the Holy Spirit, Concurrence in the Rege|neration and Conver&s;ion of Sinners, and thence forward, in carrying on the Work of Grace in them. As all Ordi|nances of Wor&s;hip are but various Manners of admini&s;|tering the Word of God, it is e&s;pecially to be con&s;idered as a Mean for the&s;e Purpo&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">III. That we may &s;ee with what Propriety the&s;e are called Means of Grace, let us attend to what we find a&s;|cribed to, or predicated of the Word, in the Bible; which only can be &s;aid of it con&s;idered as an In&s;trument or Means, and not as an efficient Cau&s;e; which it cannot be. The Conviction of Sinners is a&s;cribed to it, <HI>By the Law is the Knowledge of Sin.</HI> Rom. iii. 20. Peter's Hearers upon hearing his Di&s;cour&s;e, wherein he proved from the Scrip|tures of the Old Te&s;tament, that Je&s;us, whom they had cru|cified, was the true Me&s;&s;ias, <HI>Were pricked in their Hearts.</HI> Acts ii. 37. By this God di&s;tingui&s;hes his Word delivered by the true Prophets, from that delivered by the fal&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> this
<PB N="75" REF="011997_0073_0F89211AE957C550">
That his <HI>Word is like a Fire, and like a Hammer that break|eth the Rock in Pieces.</HI> Jer. xxiii. 29. <HI>The Word of God is quick and powerful, and &s;harper than any two edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing a&s;under of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joints and Marrow, and is a Di&s;cerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart.</HI> Heb. iv. 12. it kills the legal Pride of Sinners. <HI>I through the Law am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God.</HI> Gal. ii. 19. I have already taken Notice in my Ob&s;ervations on Regeneration, that Chri&s;ti|ans are &s;aid to be <HI>born again, begotten,</HI> and <HI>made Partakers of the divine Nature,</HI> by the Word of God. 1 Pet. i. 23. Jam. i. 18. 2 Pet. i. 4. to which I would add, P&s;al, xix. 7, 8. where the Word under the Terms, <HI>Law, Te&s;timony,</HI> and <HI>Commandments,</HI> is &s;aid <HI>to convert the Soul, make Wi&s;e the Simple, and enlighten the Eyes;</HI> all which Terms plainly expre&s;s the &s;aving Change wrought in Regenera|tion: This Change is an In&s;cription of the divine Law up|on the Heart. Jer. xxxi. 33. all the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions &s;ignify much more than merely in&s;tructing the &s;peculative Un|der&s;tanding. They mu&s;t import the Concurrence of the Word as a Mean or In&s;trument in the Hand of the Holy Spirit, both in the preparatory Work of Conviction, and al&s;o in effecting the &s;aving Change in Regeneration. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to recite the many Pa&s;&s;ages which repre&s;ent the Word and Ordinances as Means of quickening, &s;up|porting, comforting, &s;anctifying, perfecting and &s;trength|ening of God's People. I would only ob&s;erve, that the Efficacy of the Word for the&s;e Purpo&s;es, depends upon the Pre&s;ence and immediate Agency of the Holy Spirit in the Heart; which as really takes Place in the&s;e In&s;tan|ces, as in the Regeneration of a Sinner, and the latter as ea&s;ily admits the U&s;e of Means as the former.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Efficacy of the Means of Grace lies not in any intrin&s;ic Virtue in them&s;elves, nor depends upon the Power or Will of tho&s;e who attend upon them; for the Effect to be produced is &s;upernatural, to which Sinners
<PB N="76" REF="011997_0074_0F89211B744CF638">
are by Nature entirely aver&s;e, and de&s;titute of a true Di&s;cernment of the Excellency of the Truths and Weight of the Arguments propo&s;ed in the Word; but they are rendered effectual to the Attainment of the End, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of the holy Spirit upon them, and his Energy in them; they are Means in the Spirit's Hand, rather than the Creature's. And Sinners are to attend upon them in that View, that they may lie in the Way in which the Spirit meets with &s;uch, and works upon them; like the poor impotent People, who lay at the Pool, waiting for the De&s;cent of the Angel to trouble the Waters. John v. 3.4. With Re&s;pect to Creature Agents, the Applica|tion or U&s;e of Means depends upon them, but the Cau&s;a|lity it&s;elf, or Energy of Means in order to the End is not in their Power, nor depends upon their Will. Hence they often fail of Succe&s;s in the U&s;e of the be&s;t adapted Means; but when this Divine Agent onde&s;cends to u&s;e Means, he cau&s;es their Efficacy, and makes them effectual when, and with Re&s;pect to whom he plea&s;es. I &s;ay, con|de&s;cends to u&s;e Means; for the very Circum&s;tance I have mentioned, &s;hews he needs them not; he could immedi|ately Will what&s;oever he plea&s;es; when, therefore, he is plea&s;ed to make U&s;e of Means, it is in Order to the more ea&s;y Di&s;covery of him&s;elf to his Creatures. Hence it follows, that the Great God is not the le&s;s an efficient, for his u&s;ing Means, nor the le&s;s di&s;plays his Power in accompli&s;hing the End by them.</P>
<P N="5">V. Yet, notwith&s;tanding, there is an Aptne&s;s and Ten|dency in the Means, in Order to the End in View; other|wi&s;e they would not be properly Means. Tho&s;e Things which have no Aptne&s;s or Tendency to the Attainment of the End, can have no Sort of Influence upon it; the Exi&s;tence of the End has no Kind of Connection with them, and con&s;equently they are no Means at all of its Exi&s;tence. Now, the Aptne&s;s or Tendency of the Word of God to reduce Sinners to the Obedience of Chri&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="011997_0075_0F89211D08256F18">
lies in. 1&s;t. The Clearne&s;s of Repre&s;entation, whereby divine Truths are &s;et before the Mind; Divine Truths are clothed in the mo&s;t plain and intelligible Language, their &s;ublime Nature will allow of; they are de&s;criptively expre&s;&s;ed, &s;o as not only to declare their Nature, but al|&s;o to de&s;cribe their true Influence, and the Impre&s;&s;ions they &s;hould make upon the Heart. They are al&s;o illu&s;tra|ted by the mo&s;t familiar Similitudes. 2d. In the intere&s;t|ing Manner in which the&s;e &s;acred Truths are urged, or the Weight of the Arguments with which they are pre&s;|&s;ed home. 3d. In the awful Authority and great Maje|&s;ty with which they are delivered, whence they bind and affect the Con&s;cience; they are &s;et before us with a <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord or Jehovah,</HI> our rightful Sovereign, with whom is terrible Maje&s;ty, <HI>and your God,</HI> who has a Cove|nant Claim upon his profe&s;&s;ing People. Hence then, when the holy Spirit takes the Word in his Hand, and makes Application of it to the Heart, it is mo&s;t apt and fit, as a Mean, to in&s;truct the Mind and inform the Con|&s;cience, and thus to convince and awaken the Sinner; to lay Re&s;traints upon Men, and repre&s;s, or in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, re&s;train even the natural Enmity of the awakened Sinner; and when the Holy Spirit effectually opens the Sinner's Eyes, and makes him under&s;tand divine Truths as they are repre&s;ented in the Word, they have a mo&s;t apt Ten|dency, by Way of Argument, to per&s;uade and determine the Will; and to promote the Life and Exerci&s;e of all the Graces of the Holy Spirit, in true Chri&s;tians.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would here refer the Reader to what I have &s;aid in the 6th Ob&s;ervation on Regeneration, concerning the In&s;trumentality of the Word therein.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have &s;aid that when the Word is &s;o effectually ap|plied to the Con&s;cience as to convince the Sinner, it is a Means of repre&s;&s;ing or re&s;training his natural Enmity. As this will probably be, in a particular Manner, called in Que&s;tion, I beg Leave to offer a few Thoughts further
<PB N="78" REF="011997_0076_0F89211D91D25508">
upon it. I do not at all &s;uppo&s;e the Sinner's Enmity is, in this Ca&s;e, &s;ubdued; for then he would be regenerated, which is contrary to the Suppo&s;ition. The Wickedne&s;s of Men may, yea, in many In&s;tances is re&s;trained, when its governing Power is not at all broken. Hence, <HI>tho&s;e who were clean e&s;caped from them who live in Error, and e&s;|caped the Pollutions of the World through the Knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, may be allured through the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h, and much Wantonne&s;s, and be again entangled; yea, it too often proves to be the Ca&s;e, that ac|cording to the true Proverb, the Dog is turned to his own Vo|mit again, and the Sow that wa&s;hed to her Wallowing in the Mire.</HI> 2 Pet. ii. 18, 19, 20&mdash;22, The acting of the Sinner's Enmity is, indeed, more direct again&s;t God and &s;piritual Objects, thus brought near and &s;et in View be|fore him by Conviction, and this, no doubt, is a great Aggravation of tho&s;e Exerci&s;es of Enmity; yet it will by no Means follow that Enmity, as an evil Principle in the Heart, is more prevalent, or has, in this Ca&s;e, acquired a greater Degree of Power. The Power of this, as well as every other evil Habit, lies in the Sway and Dominion it has in the Heart. Enmity reigns in the Heart ever while it is de&s;titute of true Love to God; but yet the more peaceably it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Heart, and the more fully it has its Con&s;ent, the more powerful it is. While the Sinner is in a State of Security, though he don't feel &s;o explicit Oppo&s;ition to God in his Heart, as being more out of View; yet it is the &s;ame Principle of Enmity that carries him on in ca&s;ting God's Law behind his Back; in neglecting the Divine Service; and giving a loo&s;e Rein to his Corruptions, while he de&s;pi&s;es, and perhaps derides &s;trict Religion. His Enmity lords it over him with|out Control, and hardens his Heart again&s;t Reproof and Conviction. It is unmole&s;ted in its Sway, and carries the Sinner headlong whichever Way it directs; and he ju&s;tifies him&s;elf in all this, and refu&s;es to take Blame to
<PB N="79" REF="011997_0077_0F89211F9449F070">
him&s;elf; but the awakened Sinner, while Conviction is born home upon the Con&s;cience, confe&s;&s;es the ju&s;t Au|thority over him, that he has mo&s;t unju&s;tly trampled upon it, and violated his Law; though he has no Holy Acquie&s;cence in, or Choice of the divine Government, yet he has a rational Conviction that it is rightful, and that he de&s;erves Puni&s;hment for contradicting it; that he feels his Heart aver&s;e, greatly alarms him, and convinces him, of the Exi&s;tence of Enmity in his Heart. In&s;tead of &s;purn|ing at his Convictions, trampling them under Foot, and ca&s;ting them off, which would be the Ca&s;e if his Enmity acquired Strength in Proportion to his Convictions, he cheri&s;hes them, and is afraid of falling back into Securi|ty again. Though he feels Ri&s;ings of Heart, yea, &s;ome Sinners make &s;ome Attempts to &s;hake of their Convicti|ons, with whom they are too powerful, and are increa&s;|ed till they &s;o break their &s;tout Spirits, as that they give up their Stuggles to &s;tifle them, and become afraid le&s;t they &s;hould leave them again to fall into an hardened State; yet this is &s;o far from proving the Increa&s;e of En|mity as to Strength or Prevalence, that, in Reality, it proves the Re&s;traint of it by the Authority of God's Law in the Con&s;cience, and convincing Influences of the Holy Spirit. Upon a Di&s;covery of the exceeding Depravity and Wickedne&s;s of his Heart, the Sinner, upon &s;ome Principle, wi&s;hes his Heart was changed. True, he does not choo&s;e Holine&s;s or turning to God in it&s;elf con&s;idered, for that he does not, is one main Thing that fills his Con&s;cience with &s;o much Guilt; yet he earne&s;tly de&s;ires there was &s;uch an Heart in him as did &s;ee the Beauty of Holine&s;s, and truly choo&s;e it. He de&s;ires this, indeed, upon no higher Principle, than a Regard to his own Hap|pine&s;s. This, where there is no higher, is not a Holy Principle, nor is this Sort of De&s;ire of Grace &s;uch as de|notes true Grace in the Heart; yet it is not, in it&s;elf, a wicked Principle. That this Re&s;pect to his own Happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="80" REF="011997_0078_0F8921206AF0B0E8">
does not regard Holine&s;s as an Ingredient in it, and is not &s;ubordinate to, and under the Influence of an high|er and more noble Principle, is his Crime; but that it is in him, and has Influence upon him, is not. Surely, the Sin|ner's Enmity is not as prevalent and unre&s;trained, when he is thus anxiou&s;ly &s;olicitous to obtain Heart-changing Grace, even on this Principle, as when he utterly di&s;re|garded the Matter, and ju&s;tified him&s;elf in refu&s;ing to re|turn.</P>
<P>When it is &s;aid, that the awakened Sinner &s;till conti|nues to reject Chri&s;t, and hate God with all his Heart; The Meaning mu&s;t either be, that under all his Convic|tions, the Sinner exerts him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t with all his Might in Oppo&s;ition to them; that he the more pours Contempt on the Go&s;pel, and &s;toutly re&s;olves to reject Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that he ca&s;ts about to find out how he may bear him&s;elf up in a determined Oppo&s;ition to the Go&s;|pel Overtures of Salvation, and the more he is convinced, the more maliciou&s;ly does he oppo&s;e, and impudently ju&s;tify him&s;elf in refu&s;ing Chri&s;t and his Redemption, like the Scribes and Phari&s;ees of old, which would argue the Increa&s;e of Enmity with a Witne&s;s; and then, the Propo&s;ition is not true, yea notoriou&s;ly contrary to Fact. Or el&s;e the Meaning mu&s;t only be, that notwith&s;tanding all his Convictions and Increa&s;e of Light, his Enmity is not at all &s;ubdued, but if pre&s;ent Re&s;traints were remo|ved, it would return to its old &s;tubborn Stoutne&s;s in the Way of Sin; and all the Faculties and Powers of the Soul are &s;till under the reigning Power of that hateful Principle; and then I have no Controver&s;y with any Man about it: But this is no Way incon&s;i&s;tent with what I have &s;aid, unle&s;s we &s;ay, that to lay Re&s;traints upon the Lu&s;ts and Corruptions of Men, is incon&s;i&s;tent with their Dominion in the Heart; or el&s;e, that they have as great a Degree of Power under Re&s;traints as when mo&s;t un|re&s;trained; neither of which, will any Man, in the due

U&s;e of his Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ert, for that would de&s;troy all Ideas of different Degrees of Wickedne&s;s. The Sinner's Con|victions awaken his Attention to tho&s;e glorious Objects, God, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Way of Salva|tion thro' him; and thereby the Actings of his natural Enmity are more direct and explicit, which, doubtle&s;s, more aggravates them as particular Acts, and expo&s;es the Malignity of that hateful Principle. Yet that very Di&s;|covery, and the Sinner's condemning him&s;elf for it, and Cries to God for Deliverance from it, &s;hew that it has not as quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Heart, and as prevalent Energy in it as formerly.&mdash;Now it is from the Principles, good or bad, which have the governing Prevalence in the Heart, that Per&s;ons have their Character; a Cour&s;e of Action only fixes the Character, as it indicates the Prevalence of the Principle from which &s;uch Actions flow; and the Degree of that Prevalence determines the Degree of the Character, e&s;pecially in the Eye of the Heart-&s;earching God; if then under &s;olemn Convictions by the Authority of God's Law, and the convincing In|fluences of the Holy Spirit, the Sinner's natural Enmity be re&s;trained, it will follow, that the awakened Sinner's Character is not, on the Whole, rendered more vile and odious in the Sight of God, than it was in the Days of his Security and contented Cour&s;e of Sin again&s;t him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will by no Means follow, that awakened Sinners are in a Degree accepted of God, on Account of their being le&s;s &s;inful than they were in the Days of their Security; for the divine Law &s;till condemns them as falling &s;hort, infinitely &s;hort of its Demands; and their le&s;s Sinfulne&s;s makes no Atonement for the &s;malle&s;t pa&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: It only follows that in their pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e, they demerit a le&s;s Degree of Di&s;approbation and Pu|ni&s;hment; i. e. they are le&s;s offen&s;ive; and this we mu&s;t admit, or el&s;e deny any different Degrees of Wickedne&s;s; or a&s;&s;ert that the lowe&s;t Degree of Wickedne&s;s is as offen&s;ive, and di&s;approved in as high a Degree as the greate&s;t.</NOTE>&mdash; Can it be imagined, that the Sinner's Enmity has as

<P>That the Means of Grace have a Tendency to the Conviction and Conver&s;ion of Sinners, as well as the Edification of God's People, appears by the Expo&s;tula|tions God u&s;es with them in his Word, as utterly inex|cu&s;able and perver&s;e in continuing Impenitents after all the Pains he has taken upon them, and Means u&s;ed with them. I&s;a. v. from the Beginning of the Chapter, the Lord repre&s;ents the abundant Provi&s;ion he had made for their Fruitfulne&s;s, in Point of Means and Advantages which he had afforded them; on which he expo&s;tulates with them. V. 4. <HI>What could have been done more to my Vineyard that I have not done in it? wherefore when I looked that it &s;hould bring forth Grapes, bro't it forth wild Grapes?</HI> Jer. vii. 23.24.25.26.27.28.29. <HI>But this Thing commanded I them, &s;aying obey my Voice, and I will be your God, and ye &s;hall be my People: and walk ye in all the Ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you; but they hearkened not, nor inclined their Ear, but walked in the Coun&s;els and the Imaginations of their evil Heart, and went backward and not forward. Since the Day that your Fathers came forth of the Land of Egypt unto this Day, I have even &s;ent you all my Servants the Prophets, daily ri&s;ing up early and &s;ending them.

There is no certain or infallible Connection between the mo&s;t diligent and earne&s;t Attendance on the Means of Grace, that unregenerate Sinners are capable of, and their obtaining the &s;aving Grace of God.

If we &s;uppo&s;e a certain nece&s;&s;ary Connection in this Ca&s;e, it mu&s;t ari&s;e, either from the Nature of the Thing, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ome Con&s;titution or Law of Nature, or from &s;ome Pro|mi&s;e and po&s;itive Appointment of God to that Purpo&s;e;
<PB N="84" REF="011997_0082_0F892122D1B43230">
but in the Ca&s;e before us, there is no &s;uch Connection in either Way. Not the former; for the Means of Grace are po&s;itive In&s;titutions, and don't fall under the Laws of Na|ture; nor do they operate by Way of Influence upon God, to move him to &s;hew Mercy, but are Means where|by the ble&s;&s;ed God deals with Sinners, and works effectu|ally on whom he plea&s;es; their Efficacy depends upon his Ble&s;&s;ing and Energy. In this View he has appointed Means, and requires fallen Men to attend upon them. Guilty Sinners lie at Mercy, upon which they have no Claim, but it lies in the Brea&s;t of God as a Sovereign of his own Grace, to &s;hew Mercy or not as he plea&s;es; and therefore, according to his &s;overeign Plea&s;ure, he renders the Means of Grace effectual or not; and as to the latter Part of Connection, <HI>viz.</HI> by Promi&s;e or po&s;itive Appoint|ment; there is not the &s;malle&s;t Evidence of it in the Word of God; if there be, let any one &s;hew it, who thinks he can. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have not met with one &s;uch Pro|mi&s;e in all the Book of God. As to &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages, as Luke xi. 9. and Mat. vii. 7. <HI>A&s;k and it &s;hall be given you; &s;eek and ye &s;hall find; knock and it &s;hall opened unto you.</HI> There the Conduct of God as a Father towards his Children, is plainly &s;poken of; and therefore, a&s;king, &s;eeking, and knocking in Faith, a&s;king, &amp;c. in a gracious Manner, is intended; and they are the Children of God who are &s;poken of. If the moral Efficacy of the Means of Grace terminated on God, to move him to give Grace (the very mention of which &s;hews the Ab&s;urdity of the Suppo&s;i|tion) or the Sinner's U&s;e of them were at all the Ground or Rea&s;on of his &s;hewing Mercy; then, indeed, the very Appointment of Means would imply a Promi&s;e of Suc|ce&s;s, or &s;omething equal to it, in the required U&s;e of them; but this is &s;o far from being the Ca&s;e, that on the Contrary, the Tendency of the Means to the End lies in their moral Influence upon the Con&s;ciences and Hearts
<PB N="85" REF="011997_0083_0F892124236F4618">
of Sinners; yet whatever Aptne&s;s to &s;uch an Influence there is in the Means of Grace, &s;uch is the Blindne&s;s, Deadne&s;s, Enmity and Prejudice of poor Sinners, that until the Holy Spirit accompany them with his Pre&s;ence and Energy, no &s;uch Influence will effectually take Place in their Hearts. Now he works in or by the&s;e Means as a Sovereign; hence he &s;trives with many only in &s;uch a Way, as that he &s;uffers them &s;till to re&s;i&s;t, until in ju&s;t Re&s;entment, he for&s;akes them: But with Re&s;pect to the Ve&s;&s;els of Mercy, he pro&s;ecutes his gracious De&s;ign, until by the <HI>Rod of his Strength</HI> (the Word of his Grace) he irre&s;i&s;tibly conquers <HI>and rules in the Mid&s;t of his Enemies.</HI> P&s;al. cx. 2. Therefore Sinners are to u&s;e the Means of Grace as Creatures lying at Mercy, &s;eeking pure Grace, which depends on the mighty Energy of the Holy Spirit; but they can found no Claim to Grace on their mo&s;t diligent U&s;e of &s;aid Means. It is enough to engage Sinners to the U&s;e of Means, that God has ap|pointed them as &s;uch, has required their Attendance up|on them; there is an Aptne&s;s in the Means them&s;elves and a proper Tendency, and it is by the&s;e Means the Holy Spirit works; in this Way he meets with peri&s;hing Creatures in Mercy, and they cannot expect the Grace of God in the Neglect of his In&s;titutions: While there is a MAY BE <HI>the Lord will be gracious</HI> (Amos v. 15.) an WHO KNOWETH <HI>if the Lord will return, and repent, and leave a Ble&s;&s;ing behind him.</HI> (Joel ii. 14.) Sinners will be utterly inexcu&s;able in neglecting them, and ju&s;tly charged with choo&s;ing their own De&s;truction.</P>
<P N="7">VII. From what has been &s;aid it will follow, as a Con|clu&s;ion on the Whole, that all Sinners, where the Go&s;|pel comes, are under the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible Obligations to attend the Means of Grace. The De&s;ign of their In|&s;titution as Mediums of the Spirit's dealing with their Souls about their eternal Intere&s;ts, lays them under Bonds of Gratitude. For why, &s;hall the offended Maje&s;ty of Heaven, thus &s;eek after rebellious Sinners? Would it
<PB N="86" REF="011997_0084_0F892124A264CB58">
not then be the ba&s;e&s;t Ingratitude to treat him with Ne|glect? The gracious Authority of God binds their Con|&s;ciences, he requires their Attendance upon his Ordinan|ces; their very In&s;titution implies &s;uch a Requi&s;ition, and it will be a Di&s;obedience, highly criminal, to neglect them.</P>
<P>We al&s;o hence &s;ee what Ground of Encouragement Sinners have for their Attendance on the Means of Grace; they have not the A&s;&s;urance of a Promi&s;e that they &s;hall be &s;ucce&s;sful; the great God has come under no &s;uch Engagement: they have no Ground of pre&s;ent Peace and Security from their mo&s;t diligent and earne&s;t U&s;e of them. Such Apprehen&s;ions would lead to, and &s;upport a &s;elf-righteous Spirit, and be an Abu&s;e of the Means of Grace. They have great Rea&s;on of deepe&s;t Anxiety le&s;t they fail of the Grace of God, and provoke the Holy Spirit to for&s;ake them. Yet they have &s;ufficient Motives from the afore&s;aid De&s;ign of their In&s;titution; their mo|ral Aptne&s;s and Tendency, whereby they are adapted to our rational Natures and the Spirit's Operations, and &s;uited to affect the Hearts of Men in a moral Way: It is the &s;tated Way of the Spirit's dealing with the Souls of Men; by his Word and Ordinances he &s;trives with Sin|ners, and by the &s;ame Means he accompli&s;hes his &s;pecial Work of Grace; and in this Way there is the only Probability of meeting with Mercy. In the continued Neglect of God's Ordinance there is certain De&s;truction, but in waiting on God in this Way, there is a Peradven|ture the Lord may have Mercy. The Holy Spirit has rendered the Means of Grace effectual to Multitudes, and how knows each Sinner, but of his rich Grace, he may effectually reach him?</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o we may &s;ee that the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;|pel not only may with Safety and Propriety, but are bound in Duty to urge unregenerate Sinners, as well as others, to a diligent U&s;e and Improvement of the Means of Grace, and in that Way &s;eek unto God for regenerating

Grace. If the preceding View of the Matter he kept up, &s;uch Exhortations can have no Tendency to &s;et|tle People in a legal Dependence on the Means, nor pro|mote Security and carnal Confidence. Yea, it is highly incumbent on the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to give particular Directions to poor Sinners in order to their Improvement of the Means, in &s;uch a Manner as has the mo&s;t likely Tendency, and wherewith it is mo&s;t probable the Holy Spirit may concur for their Conver&s;ion to God.&mdash;Cer|tainly a mere external Attendance upon the Admini&s;tra|tion of Ordinances, while the Heart is &s;ecure and care|le&s;s, is not likely to an&s;wer any good End. Undoubted|ly, &s;uch have Need to be directed &s;o to attend to the Word of God as to compare them&s;elves therewith, to examine them&s;elves and enter into a &s;erious Con&s;ideration of their own State and Character, and lay to Heart the Danger they are in.&mdash;Awakened Sinners are inclined to &s;eek Shelter in the Duties of Religion, and to expect Heal|ing and Relief to their Con&s;ciences from their earne&s;t U&s;e of Means. The&s;e need to be warned of that dangerous Rock, and be directed to &s;uch a View of God's Law as may more deeply convince them of their utter Depravity, and &s;lay them dead to the Law. Gal. ii. 19. Their Attention to the Overtures of the Go&s;pel &s;hould be urged. Our &s;afe Path lies between two dangerous Extremes, <HI>viz.</HI> of tho&s;e who only try to con|vince Men of their unregenerate State, call upon them to embrace Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and there leave them under all their perplexing Exerci&s;es and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, without any Coun&s;el or Direction; and thus their various Temptati|ons, Di&s;couragements and De&s;pondencies are overlooked, and no A&s;&s;i&s;tance is admini&s;tred when they mo&s;t need it. It is a Matter of great Con&s;equence, into what Hands poor convinced Sinners fall; an un&s;kilful Treatment of them is va&s;tly injurious. The other Extreme is of tho&s;e, who direct Sinners to Duties and Attendance on the Means of
<PB N="88" REF="011997_0086_0F892126922D4260">
Grace in &s;uch a legal Manner, as to encourage their De|pendance upon them; &s;uch lead poor Creatures to think they can do &s;omething to recommend them to God; their utter In&s;ufficiency in them&s;elves is never fairly opened up. On the contrary, they are told, if they do their Part, God will do his; and thus they are made to believe, there is a certain Connection between their own be&s;t Endea|vours and the Saving Grace of God; that if they DO WHAT THEY CAN, God will do the Re&s;t. Thus the Na|ture and De&s;ign of the Means is mi&s;repre&s;ented. They are con&s;idered as Means which Sinners u&s;e with God, in order to prevail with him, rather than Means whereby he deals with them, in order to call them back again to him&s;elf, and renders them irre&s;i&s;tably efficacious for that Purpo&s;e when he plea&s;es. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Extremes tends to make Sinners neglect all Attempts to perform the Duties of Religion, or if they give their Pre&s;ence at Ordinances, yet make no E&s;&s;ay to &s;trive with their own Hearts; as be|ing altogether in vain, without any Tendency to pro|mote their Good, and not required of them in their pre|&s;ent Circum&s;tances. While this Doctrine is believed, Sa|tan is not much afraid of Damage to his Intere&s;t from all their Convictions of being in an unregenerate State; for the Con&s;equence is, they quench the Spirit. If Convicti|ons &s;tartle them, they, upon this Principle, make no At|tempt to cheri&s;h their Convictions, ea&s;ily fall a&s;leep again, and lie &s;till in a carele&s;s Indolence. By the latter Extreme the &s;triving of Sinners is turned into a wrong Channel, and they are directed to the U&s;e of Means upon Princi|ples entirely wrong. The Directions they get, &s;end them to the Law for Life, and &s;ettle them upon a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own. Both the Extremes are injurious to the In|tere&s;ts of Religion, and de&s;tructive to the Souls of Men; Both are to be avoided; the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are to endeavour the Conviction and awakening of Sinners; and where there are any Awakenings, they are to attend to, and cheri&s;h them, and, by prudent &s;ea&s;onable and evange|lical
<PB N="89" REF="011997_0087_0F892128BAA8F3D8">
Council to direct their Way, and point out the Me|thod of Salvation to them. They have &s;ufficient Encou|ragement to &s;uch a Conduct, upon this Principle, that however dead, mi&s;erable and helple&s;s Sinners are, yet, it is by &s;uch Views and Impre&s;&s;ions as evangelical Coun|cils and Directions tend to, that the Holy Spirit carries on his Work in the Souls of Men; and therefore, when he concurs, they &s;hall be rendered effectual. May the God of all Grace teach his Servants how to negotiate the Treaty of Peace and Reconciliation, and make them a|bundantly wi&s;e to win Souls to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, AMEN.</P>
