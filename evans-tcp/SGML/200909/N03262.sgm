<P>THE great goodne&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ed God is equally apparent and con|&s;picuous in preparing a Happine&s;s for his People, revealing the way to it, and &s;ending his Servants to incultate by all Arts of Per&s;wa&s;ion po&s;&s;ible, the Nece&s;&s;ity, Importance and Rea&s;onablene&s;s of travelling in the One, in order to obtain the other. Of this the Text under our pre|&s;ent Con&s;ideration treats, in which we may Note Three Things,

<P N="1">1. As to the Bapti&s;ts Commendation: It's &s;aid, that <HI>from his time the Kingdom of Heaven
<PB N="2" REF="003966_0004_10031AA3058B53A8">&s;uffered Violence,</HI> i. e. from the Time in which he began to preach, the Go&s;pel Church be|gan to be remarkably e&s;tabli&s;hed; its Doc|trines eagerly embraced, and it's Precepts ve|hemently Practi&s;ed; and in this importunate painful cour&s;e, his convinced hearers longed after, and labour'd for the Happine&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed in Heaven. To this purpo&s;e <HI>Pi&s;eator</HI> and others, &s;peak. <HI>Lightfoot</HI> ob&s;erves perti|nently, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> People were forbid to touch the <HI>Mount Sinai,</HI> but that now we may u&s;e Violence in a&s;cending the mi&s;tical Mountain: So <HI>Grotius</HI> al&s;o notes, <HI>Suffers Violence, Biazetai,</HI> i. e. is obtained by <HI>Mortifi|cation, Repentance, Ignominy, Poverty,</HI> &s;o <HI>Meno|chius, Ba&s;il, Chri&s;o&s;tom, Hilarie, Au&s;tine.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. God's Goodne&s;s is great in not only &s;uffering guilty Creatures to take Heaven by Violence, but even in exciting them to it, and in a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in the performance of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have a De&s;cription of the Way to the Imperial Heaven in the&s;e Words, <HI>and the Violent take it by Force:</HI> The&s;e who are truly convinc'd of Sin, of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and of Judgment<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> 16.8.</NOTE> labour to take Heaven by Storm and will not &s;tick at any co&s;t to obtain it. The&s;e &s;eek with importunate vehemence,
<PB N="3" REF="003966_0005_10031AA62349E3C8">like <HI>Jacob</HI> of old, and will not cea&s;e until they obtain the ble&s;&s;ing.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 32.26.</NOTE> The&s;e put a force upon their corrupt Nature, are willing to perform the harde&s;t Services, and under|go the &s;evere&s;t &s;ufferings, in order to obtain the great Salvation, <HI>(by force)</HI> as Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> ob&s;erves; the <HI>Jews</HI> who were the Children of the Kingdom rejected it, and the de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Gentiles</HI> imbrac'd it with readine&s;s and vehe|mence; even the Publicans and Harlots; the poor and Illiterate People, whom the proud Rabbins deem'd accur&s;ed.</P>
<P>Again, the Word &s;eems to &s;ignify, that the Kingdom of Heaven is not now confin'd to one People as of old, but lies open and ex|po&s;ed, without any National Inclo&s;ures, that whoever will take per&s;evering pains for it may po&s;&s;e&s;s it; &s;o <HI>Brugen&s;is, Tirinus, Hilary</HI> and <HI>Ambro&s;e.</HI> Once more it may &s;ignify that the Kingdom of Heaven, is not now &s;o much entail'd on De&s;cent and progeny, as confer'd on per&s;evering Virtue; &s;o <HI>Menochius</HI> and <HI>Mal|donate.</HI> We are &s;aid to take that by Violence which we tear out of anothers Hands; the Kingdom of Heaven &s;eem'd to belong to the <HI>Jews,</HI> as Children by Covenant, even that Kingdom is &s;eiz:d and taken out of their Sloathful indolent Hands, by the inferiour

<P>From the Words of our Text, thus briefly paraphrazed, we may ob&s;erve the following Propo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI> That the&s;e who wou'd obtain an Intere&s;t in the Kingdom of Hea|ven, mu&s;t u&s;e <HI>Violence,</HI> in order to it.</P>
<P>Intreating upon this Propo&s;ition, I &s;hall en|deavour to &s;hew, 1&s;t, what are the Properties of this Kingdom. 2d, What are the Qualifica|tions of its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, or what is included in that <HI>Violence</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to obtain an Intere&s;t in it. 3d.

</LIST></P>
<P>And, 1. I am to &s;hew you what are the Pro|perties of this Kingdom; it will appear, I think, by con&s;idering the following particu|lars, that it has all the amiable Qualities that may command E&s;teem, or excite, De&s;ire. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is an Ancient Kingdom, it had its ri&s;e before the Foundation of the Earth were laid, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Specious Kingdom: The Globe of the Earth is a va&s;t Body in extent and Mag|nitude, and yet it is but a &s;mall Point, com|pared with the vi&s;ible Heavens, which at an immen&s;e di&s;tance circle and compa&s;s it. Now
<PB N="5" REF="003966_0007_10031AADB7A5DD68">the Emperial, or third Heaven is Superiour to, and therefore doubtle&s;s greater than the Chri&s;taline. Therefore well might the ble&s;|&s;ed Je&s;us inform his mourning Di&s;ciples, that in his Fathers Hou&s;e were many Man&s;ions, <HI>John</HI> 14.2.</P>
<P N="3">3. A rich opulent Kingdom; it abounds with all things, that are nece&s;&s;ary, for Hon|our, Support, Wealth, Plea&s;ure. There are Thrones of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, En&s;igns of Ma|je&s;ty, Palms of Victory, Man&s;ions of Beauty, Diadems of Glory.</P>
<P>There unambitious Honour bears un&s;ullied Laurels, being fearle&s;s of a Rival, or invidi|ous Detractive, the poignant Darts of Malig|nant Reproach &s;hall never &s;tain the white Names of the Lambs followers in their Fa|thers Kingdom.</P>
<P>There is the Manna of Angels to feed upon; there be the pure Chri&s;tal Fountains of Life to bathe in, and drink of, that Spring from the Throne of God, and the Lamb, with an invarible and eternal Tenor; there is the Tree of Life, richly laden with Apples of Salvation, bearing Twelve manner of Fruits, who&s;e Leaves are for the healing of the Nations.<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev,</HI> 22.1, 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>There are Streets of Gold, Gates of Pearl, and Walls of Ja&s;per.<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> 21.</NOTE> But above all,
<PB N="6" REF="003966_0008_10031AAF6E6B0E80">there is a Lamb of God, the Pearl of great Price, who is infinitely more valuable than if the immen&s;e Globe of the Earth, the un|fathomable Deeps of the Ocean, the broad Sheets of the Chri&s;taline or Emperial Hea|vens were turned into a Body of Ma&s;&s;y or Liquid Gold! And this Pearl, <HI>dear Brethren,</HI> who&s;e worth Surpa&s;&s;es the highe&s;t Flight of an Angel's Thought to conceive, or his Tongue to expre&s;s, belongs to every inha|bitant of that Kingdom. O Ble&s;&s;ed God, how Great and Stupendious is thy Mercy, and dear Affection, that &s;uffers &s;uch a Kingdom to be taken through Violence by the guilty, ba&s;e Creatures. But to proceed,</P>
<P>There are pure and perpetual Plea&s;ures, &s;inle&s;s and un&s;tain'd Delights; for the Lamb is the perpetual &s;ource of Light to the Me|tropolis of that Kingdom; there &s;in with all its ruful train of Sorrow, Shame, Soli|tude, Di&s;ea&s;es, Darkne&s;s and Death, has not acce&s;s or re&s;idence; all Tears are wiped a|way, Sorrow and Sighing forever flee; the Inhabitants of that Kingdom &s;hall not &s;ay, they are &s;ick.<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;a.</HI> 33.24.</NOTE> So that there will be no Avenues of entrance for that Sable Serjeant <HI>Death</HI> to arre&s;t them: But on the contrary, the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s will &s;hine with uncloaded Lu&s;tre upon all the Denizons of
<PB N="7" REF="003966_0009_10031ABB0315A088">that City, opening to their Under&s;tandings, all the dark Scenes of Nature, Grace and Providence, &s;hewing the united tendency of every of them to exalt the declaritive Hon|ours of the Divine Perfections, and to &s;e|cure the compleat Happine&s;s of the Redee|med.</P>
<P>But more particularly expre&s;&s;ing the ama|zing heights of his Wi&s;dom, the Stupendu|ous depths of his Love, and the awful extent of his Power! what joyful Tran&s;ports mu&s;t needs po&s;&s;es the Brea&s;ts of the Redeem'd! When without an intercepting Gla&s;s they &s;hall perpetually behold the Glorious Per|fections of God, the amiable and tran&s;cendent Excellencies of the Redeemer, and clearly perceive (without the lea&s;t doubt to Eternity) every of the&s;e engaged to promote their Hap|pine&s;s, and al&s;o feel the everla&s;ting Streams of the Divine Love and Affection; and be ble&s;s'd with the Social Wor&s;hip of Saints and An|gels, without any defect, variation or Period. but do I pretend to de&s;cribe the&s;e things! Eye hath not &s;een, neither hath Ear heard, neither hath it entr'd in the Heart of Man, to conceive what God hath prepared for tho&s;e that love him.<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">I <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.9.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. A <HI>beautiful and glorious Kingdom;</HI> therefore called Paradi&s;e, with an Allu&s;ion to the
<PB N="8" REF="003966_0010_10031AC14BEFFC08">earthly <HI>Eden,</HI> which was crowned with a variety of Beauties and innocent Plea&s;ures. That mu&s;t needs be a beautiful Place, which infinite Wi&s;dom, has contriv'd, and infinite Power fram'd, for the Manife&s;tation of the Perfections of the Deity, and Con&s;umation of his Peoples Felicity. That mu&s;t needs be a glorious Place, where a glorious God be|ing &s;eated on a blazing Throne of &s;olemn Maje&s;ty, and unexpre&s;&s;ible Beauty, makes the Perfections of his ble&s;&s;ed Nature &s;hine forth with unvail'd Brightne&s;s and Splendor, to the equal wonder and delight of the whole Heavens, like the Sun in his Meridean Alti|tude, when no dusky Cloud hides his Beau|ty, or intercepts his Rays. The happy In|habitants of that Kingdom do then with open face, (indeed) behold the Glory of God &s;hi|ning in the Face of Chri&s;t, and are transfor|med from Glory to Glory.</P>
<P N="5">5. An <HI>un&s;haken and everla&s;ting Kingdom.</HI> It is a City that hath Foundations, who&s;e Builder and Maker is God; perfectly free'd from all the vertegenous Vici&s;&s;itudes, or various Changes of Time, a Hou&s;e not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens. But I proceed to confider, the Second propos'd, <HI>viz.</HI> To &s;hew what is included in that <HI>Violenee,</HI> which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to obtain an In|tere&s;t in eternal Happine&s;s.

<P N="1">1. Sometimes he will tell them that they are not in a right Frame now, your Prayer with

<P N="1">1. It's unrea&s;onable; it's as if a poor Beggar would neglect a&s;king an Alms, 'till it was given him without a&s;king for, (which he can|not rea&s;onably expect) and then go and a&s;k for it. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. It's fal&s;e that there is no good in &s;uch Prayers as are offer'd with a Cold frame; the Matter is &s;urely good, for it is an Act of Obe|dience to the divine Command; and oftentimes when the People of God begin with a cold frame, they end in a warm one; for God will meet the&s;e that wait upon him in his Way. Di|ligence after this manner, with a holy Vio|lence is an Evidence of our uprightne&s;s, and the good God is not unju&s;t to forget our Work and Labour of Love. And truly it is an Act of greater Self-denial to be dili|gent in Duty when Gods Face is hid from us, than when we are under the &s;hines of it. Again.</P>
<P N="3">3. Satan will plead, you have no Time, no Time for Prayer; and &s;o point to other Duties you have to do; <HI>An&s;w.</HI> Pray how

<P N="4">4. It Satan finds that we will go to Prayer do what he can, then he'll li&s;ten into your Ear, be &s;hort, be &s;hort, ju&s;t run over the Heads of Prayer, and that will do for this Time well e|nough; God knows your wants before you &s;peak, you can't inform him, he is unchange|able, you can't turn him, and al&s;o you mu&s;t beware of vain Repetitions.
