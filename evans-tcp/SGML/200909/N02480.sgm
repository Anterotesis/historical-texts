<PB N="12" REF="002940_0012_0FE69B8DE19B93A0">and intere&s;t, agreed to be paid to the Complainants, that the Con&s;ideration on the Complainants part to be done, was, Fir&s;t, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to make further Proffers for the We&s;t-Neck,</HI> and Secondly, <HI>By the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to write to their Corre&s;pondents, to de&s;i&s;t;</HI> the performance of both which is ex|pre&s;ly averred by the Bill, and no way denyed, but confe&s;&s;ed by the An&s;wer. That as to what's alledged on this point, in behalf of the Defendents, viz. <HI>That the Complainants had Circumvented and Surprized them is the Agreement, and had deceived them, by &s;ending the fir&s;t Letter by</HI> Quinby, Cornwall, <HI>and</HI> Town&s;end, <HI>under pretence that they had Corre&s;pondents, when the Defendents alledge, they had none, by which they were damnified.</HI> It appears, <HI>the Defend|ents had the Articles in their hands for two days before the Execution thereof,</HI> and the Complainants are but Illiterate, and the Defendants men of Figure and Knowledge, which leaves little room to &s;u&s;pect either Surprize or Circum|vention on the part of the Complainants. That <HI>its not affirmed by the An&s;wer, That</HI> Quinby, Cornwall <HI>and</HI> Town&s;end &s;aid, <HI>they particuarly had Corre&s;pond|ents,</HI> but by their Letter, <HI>it appears they wrote not to them as &s;uch,</HI> but as to <HI>the Corre&s;pondents of the</HI> Palmers, <HI>and Company,</HI> and <HI>that they had Corre&s;pond|ents, is admitted,</HI> That by the Second Article of Agreement, in the Defendent, Philips's writing, which was propo&s;ed and agreed to, after the fir&s;t Letter was &s;ent away, it appears, <HI>the Letter agreed to be &s;ent, was then to be &s;ent,</HI> which <HI>Could not be that which had been before Sent;</HI> and <HI>which Letter is acknowleged to have been received by the Defendents,</HI> and <HI>which, with the De&s;i&s;ting to make further Proffers,</HI> is a Performance of what, on the Complainants part was to be Performed; and if any room is left to &s;uppo&s;e Surprize or Circumvention, in &s;ending the fir&s;t Letter, it &s;eemeth not &s;ufficient to make void the Argeement, it not being the Sub&s;tance of the Matter, but <HI>the de&s;i&s;ting further Proffers</HI> with <HI>the Second Letter by the</HI> Palmers, remain &s;ufficient Con&s;iderations for Perform|ance on the part of the Defendents; the&s;e being all that appear to be &s;tipulated to be done on the part of the Complainants.</P>
<P>Then as to the <HI>Bounds of the Great or midle Neck,</HI> which is the Chief thing in que&s;tion, I conceive what appears in the Defendents An&s;wer, and has been urged by them, <HI>as to the meaning of the word Neck,</HI> in the Mortgage of <HI>Richbell</HI> to <HI>Richbell,</HI> under which the Complainants now claim, that it extends no fur|ther than the flux of the Salt-Water: I conceive it to be an Expo&s;ition which will neither agree with the words of the Patent, nor Deeds that are &s;et forth, referred to, and produced either by the Complainants or Defendents, nor with the Intention of the Parties to the Deeds them&s;elves. It has been &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on by the Defendents Council, that the word <HI>Neck</HI> is a plain familiar Engli&s;h word, and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, and that it means not nor can mean any more than <HI>a point of Land, limitted or bounded with Water on three Sides,</HI> and can bear the Name of a <HI>Neck</HI> no further than the Water makes it &s;o, that is, where the Tyde ri&s;es; and <HI>that the words in the Patent, and all the Deeds contain two &s;everal Grants,</HI> to wit, <HI>One of the Necks,</HI> and <HI>another of the Land, without the Necks, running into the Woods.</HI> Now, whatever there might be in this Ex|po&s;ition of the word <HI>Neck,</HI> &s;tanding &s;ingly by it &s;elf, which yet I do not think will hold; for it is well known, that Valleys between two or more Ridges of Higher ground, far beyond where the Neck reaches, in common acceptation, do as frequently fall under the Denomination of <HI>Necks</HI> of Land, as the other: But leaving that, I &s;ay, whatever the word <HI>Neck,</HI> &s;ingly &s;tanding by it &s;elf, might &s;ignify in the ca&s;e before me, at pre&s;ent, I conceive, <HI>it mu&s;t be under&s;tood as the Words of the Patent and Deeds of the Grantor de&s;cribes and intended it.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="002940_0013_0FE69B8E42D80ED0">It will not be denyed, but that Names both of Places and Things are arbitrary, even tho' very fal&s;e, as <HI>Black and White Acre,</HI> which do not receive thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Names from their <HI>Colour,</HI> and yet when things obtain &s;uch a Name, by reputa|tion, they will pa&s;s by the&s;e Names. A piece of Painting, taking in that part of the body above the middle, and &s;o in <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts,</HI> has obtained the Name of <HI>a Head,</HI> and is &s;o called, <HI>tho' we &s;ee it takes in the Neck, shoulders, and a great part of the Body;</HI> &s;o it may well be that the extent or bounds of a Piece of Land, can|not always be gathered, nor clearly under&s;tood by the Name which is given it. It is Evident, that in the original Grant or Patent of this Land it is de&s;cribed to be 

  <Q>A parcel or Tract of Land, contained within three Necks, the Ea&s;ter-mo&s;t of which is bounded with a &s;mall River, called, <HI>Mamaroneck River,</HI> being the Ea&s;ter-mo&s;t Limits or Bounds of this Government, and the We&s;ter-mo&s;t, by the Gravelly or &s;tony Brook or River, which makes the E&s;ter-mo&s;t Bounds of Mr. <HI>Pells</HI> Purcha&s;e, having to the South the Sound, and running North-ward from the marked Trees upon the &s;aid Necks, twen|ty Miles into the Woods.</Q>

 This <HI>parcel or Tract of Land,</HI> it is plain, is de&s;cribed under the Name of <HI>one Tract only,</HI> having the Sound to the South|ward, and <HI>running North-ward Twenty Miles into the Woods;</HI> which is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, <HI>being bounded to the South-ward with the Sound,</HI> and <HI>to the North-ward at the Extent of Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> It is further Ob|&s;erveable, That in the &s;ame Patent, it is granted by the Name of <HI>One parcel or Tract of Land only,</HI> and in the <HI>Habend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m,</HI> there it is called the &s;aid <HI>Parcel and Tract of Land in the &s;aid Three Necks contained,</HI> and a yearly Quit-Rent of Eight bu&s;hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of Wheat, is re&s;erved upon <HI>the &s;ame Tract of Land.</HI> So, I think, by the Patent, there is no doubt but the whole was called and under&s;tood to be <HI>One Tract of Land, contained in three Necks.</HI> And who can &s;ay, the Grantor had not a right to extend the&s;e Necks of Land by the Name of <HI>Necks,</HI> as far back into the Woods as he thought fit. But the Second Deed produced and agreed to by both Parties, is a deed made by the Patentee <HI>John Richbell,</HI> about one year after the Date of the Patent, and is a Grant of the Ea&s;ter-mo&s;t of the &s;aid three <HI>Necks,</HI> to one <HI>Rider,</HI> in tru&s;t for a Joynture, to the Grantor <HI>John Richbell's Wife.</HI> Now by this Deed, it is evident, that as the &s;aid Tract of Land <HI>was granted or patented by the name of three necks,</HI> &s;o the Grantee or Patentee, under|&s;tood it, &amp; &s;o he calls it; for in this Deed of <HI>Riders,</HI> he di&s;cribes it by the Name of a certain <HI>tract or parcel of Land upon the Main, containing three necks,</HI> &amp; granted for the u&s;es in the &s;aid Deed mention'd, all that <HI>parcel or tract of Land where be now lives, called the Ea&s;t-Neck;</HI> &amp; to leave it without doubt, what he means by <HI>neck,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>the Neck includes all the Lands, as well North into the Woods above</HI> We&s;tche&s;ter <HI>Path, Twenty Miles, as the Lands below the Path, South-wards towards the Sound.</HI> And after having &s;o de&s;cribed the <HI>Neck</HI> in the Premi&s;&s;es of the Deed, &s;o in the <HI>Habendum,</HI> he calls it, without the addition of more words, <HI>The &s;aid Neck of Land.</HI> And in the Covenant, for further a&s;&s;urance, he calls it by the &s;ame Name of <HI>Neck</HI> only. From all which, it is plain, to a Demon&s;tration, that the Grantor, <HI>John Richbell,</HI> meant and under&s;tood by the word <HI>Neck</HI> of Land, <HI>all the Land between the Sound on the South-ward, and the Extent of Twenty Miles to the North-ward.</HI> And looking into the Deed of Mortgage, as us Steenwyck, about five years after date of the Patent, under which Mortgage the Defendents claim, and is by them &s;et forth and referred to, in their An&s;wer, we find the &s;aid <HI>John Richbell</HI> for the &s;ecuring the pay|ment of Two Thou&s;and Four Hundred Guilders, Wampon (which is worth Sixty Pounds <HI>York Money</HI>) did 

  
  <Q>Bind his the &s;aid <HI>John Richbell</HI>'s Neck or
  <PB N="14" REF="002940_0014_0FE69B9B979110D8">piece of Land lying upon the Main, being the mo&s;t We&s;terly Neck of Land of the three, to him the &s;aid <HI>John Richbell</HI> belonging, Limitting the Neck of Land afore&s;aid, to the South, with the Sound, and running from the marked T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es &s;tanding on the &s;aid Necks, Twenty Miles into the Woods.</Q>

 
  
Here he again tells us what he under&s;tood the &s;aid <HI>Neck</HI> to be, and which is contained in as certain words as can well be expre&s;&s;ed. And &s;o, it appears, he had Granted or Mortgaged <HI>both the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Necks,</HI> as they are de&s;cribed in the Patent, <HI>bounded on the Sound to the South-ward, and running Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> But then, as to the Deed or Mortgage of the &s;ame, <HI>John Richbell</HI> to his Uncle <HI>Robert Richbell,</HI> made about Seven Years after the Date of the Patent, for &s;ecuring the payment of Two Hundred and Fifty Pounds, Bo&s;ton Silver Money, which at that time was equal in Value to Six Shillings and Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pence <HI>per Ounce,</HI> by which he grants 

  
  <Q>all his Right, Title and Intere&s;t in and to One Neck of Land commonly called and known by the Name of the great Neck, bordered or bounded by the Sound on one End, &amp; betwixt his other two &s;mall Necks, on each &s;ide of the great Neck, To have and To hold <HI>the &s;aid great neck.</HI></Q>

 
  
And thus &s;tand the words of this Deed, and upon which the whole Di&s;pute, at pre&s;ent, is. The Defendants &s;ay, That here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o more pa&s;&s;eth but what nature makes a Neck, <HI>becau&s;e the Extent of Twenty Miles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the woods, is not Expre&s;&s;ed, therefore it shall not be intended to pa&s;s;</HI> &amp; that wherever the grantor, <HI>John Richbell,</HI> intended twenty Miles &s;hould pa&s;s, he &s;aid &s;o, &amp; &s;o ex|pre&s;&s;ed it. And here they urge &s;trongly, That this <HI>Grant of a parcel or tract of Land, contained in three necks having the Sound is the South-ward, &amp; running twenty Miles into the Woods, makes two Different Grants of two &s;everal parcels of Land;</HI> and &s;ay further, that the words <HI>parcel or Tract of Land,</HI> &s;hould be read, <HI>parcel &amp; Tract of Land;</HI> and &s;o by changing the Disjunctive into a Conjunctive, it will then be clear, that <HI>the grant of the Twenty Miles into the Woods, from the marked Trees on the &s;aid Necks, is a &s;eperate Tract of Land,</HI> and cannot pa&s;s by the word <HI>Neck,</HI> which is a Di&s;tinct <HI>parcel of Land,</HI> unle&s;s mentioned. And &s;o, by the Mortgage, under which the Complainants claim, nothing can pa&s;s but the Land lying between the <HI>Two Creeks,</HI> as high as the Salt-Water flows; And to &s;up|port this Expo&s;ition, they product a third Mortgage of the &s;aid We&s;t-Neck, &s;et forth and referred to by them in their An&s;wers, and made by the &s;aid <HI>John Richbell</HI> in One Thou&s;and Six Hundred and Seventy Eight, to the &s;ame <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck,</HI> for the &s;ecuring of One Hundred and Twenty Five Pounds. And by this Mortgage Deed, they &s;ay, that <HI>John Richbell</HI> granted the &s;ame <HI>We&s;t-Neck,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods;</HI> and from thence urge, That as be intended to grant: <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> &s;o he took care to expre&s;s it accordingly. The words of the Deed are the&s;e, 
  
  <Q>Hath Demi&s;ed, Granted, &amp;c. to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck</HI> all that his Neck of Land lying upon the Main, being the mo&s;t We&s;terly Neck of the three, belong|ing to the &s;aid <HI>John Richbell,</HI> the &s;aid Neck of Land bordering on the &s;toney or gravelly Water or River, which is the Ea&s;t-Limits of Mr. <HI>Pells</HI> Land, and having to the South &s;ide, the Sound, and running from the marked Tree, which is on the &s;aid Neck, North-ward, Twenty Miles into the Woods.</Q>


  
Now, &s;ay they, it is plain, that in the grant of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Neck,</HI> and in both the before-mentioned Grants of the <HI>We&s;t-Neck,</HI> as he intended to grant the <HI>Necks</HI> with the <HI>other Tracts of Land Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> &s;o he Expre&s;&s;ed it: But, as in the Grant of the <HI>Middle Neck,</HI> Nothing is <HI>Expre&s;&s;ed</HI> but the <HI>bare Neck,</HI> &s;o nothing &s;hall be intended to pa&s;s, but the <HI>Neck only;</HI> which they &s;ay, is an ea&s;y and natural Expo&s;ition of the word <HI>Neck,</HI> and fully
<PB N="15" REF="002940_0015_0FE69B9BB4E5E2A8">Expre&s;&s;es the Intention of Grantor, and crave great Allowances for the Igno|rance of the times, when there were few or none that under&s;tood Clerk&s;hip, or the art of Conveyancing. Then, to corroberate this, they &s;et forth in their An&s;wer, that &s;ome of the Complainants them&s;elves &s;o under&s;tood the word <HI>Neck,</HI> and offered to take a Lea&s;e from the Defendent <HI>Philip&s;e,</HI> of part of the Land they now claim. And as a further argument to prove that the Complainants have no Right to any part of the Lands in <HI>John Richbells</HI> Patent, except the Lands in the <HI>great Neck, as far as the Salt-Water flows,</HI> they produce the Deeds of Lea&s;e and Relea&s;e of the &s;aid <HI>John Richbells</HI> Heir, to the Com|plainants, bearing Date the Eighth Day of <HI>Feburary,</HI> 1722. in which Relea&s;e the Mortgage of the <HI>great Neck,</HI> by <HI>John Richbell</HI> to <HI>Edward Richbell,</HI> made in One Thou&s;and Six Hundred and Seventy Three, is recited, and the great Neck is there exactly de&s;cribed, as it is in the &s;aid Mortgage, and &s;o from thence conclude, That the Heir of <HI>John Richbell,</HI> granting only the great Neck, as being "Bounded to the South-ward with the Sound, and lying between <HI>"John Richbells</HI> other two &s;mall Necks, "Nothing can pa&s;s but what nature makes a Neck. And then, the &s;ame Defendents produce their own Deeds of Lea&s;e and Relea&s;e from the &s;ame <HI>Edward Richbell,</HI> Heir of <HI>John Richbell,</HI> Dated the Twelfth and Thirteenth Days of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> One Thou&s;and Seven Hundred and Twenty Three to the&s;e Defendants, for all the re&s;idue of <HI>John Richbells</HI> Lands, contained in the before mentioned Patent, except the <HI>great Neck,</HI> before relea&s;ed to the Complainants, or &s;ome of them, and by virtue of this, the De|fendants &s;ay, they have a good Right to all the Lands <HI>above the Natural Neck Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> But I can, by no means, be of the Defendents Opinion, as to the meaning of the word <HI>Neck,</HI> nor allow of &s;uch a Change of words, where there is not an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, as in this ca&s;e there is not; Nay, I think &s;uch a Change of words cannot be admitted, without making the Patent and the other Deeds contradict them&s;elves; for when the Grantor him|&s;elf takes &s;o much pains, when he goes about to grant one of the&s;e <HI>Necks</HI> of Land, to limit, De&s;cribe, and in expre&s;s words, to call it a <HI>Neck of Land,</HI> and &s;o to de&s;cribe its Bounds and Extent, it would be a very great Violence done to the Intention of the Grantor, to change his words, in order either to Di|mini&s;h or to Enlarge his Grant, without &s;ome apparent Nece&s;&s;ity or Rea&s;on for &s;o doing, upon the bare &s;uppo&s;ition of his not intending the <HI>great Neck</HI> &s;hould extend as far as the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Necks,</HI> becau&s;e it is only called <HI>his great Neck lying between his other two &s;mall Necks.</HI> I &s;ay, this would, in my Opinion, be changeing both the Words and Intent of the Grantor; for by the Second Mortgage of the Rever&s;ion of the <HI>great Neck</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Neck</HI> to one <HI>Kellond,</HI> under which the Complainants do al&s;o Claim, in One Thou&s;and Six Hundred and Seventy Six, for the &s;ecurity of One Hundred Pounds, Di&s;cover|ed and referred to by the Defendents, in their An&s;wer, It is manife&s;t, that he under&s;tood the <HI>We&s;t-Neck</HI> and the <HI>great Neck</HI> to be of the &s;ame Extent; for having before Mortgaged the <HI>great Neck</HI> to <HI>Robert Richbell,</HI> without adding the words <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> and al&s;o to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck,</HI> his <HI>We&s;t-Neck, with the&s;e words Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> In this Mortgage to <HI>Kellond,</HI> of the Rever&s;ion of the <HI>two Necks,</HI> to wit, the <HI>great and We&s;t-Necks,</HI> he there recites that 
  
  <Q>Whereas he had granted to <HI>Robert Richbell</HI> his <HI>Neck</HI> of Land, commonly called, his <HI>great Neck,</HI> for Ninety Nine years, for the &s;ecuring the payment of Two Hundred and Fifty Pounds, and had granted to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck</HI> his <HI>We&s;t-Neck</HI> for &s;ecuring the payment of Two Thou&s;and Four Hundred Guilders,</Q>

 he there grants <HI>the Rever&s;ion of the &s;aid</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="002940_0016_0FE69B9E96BBFDF8"><HI>Two necks of Land</HI> to the &s;aid <HI>Kellond,</HI> without any addition or De&s;cription, but that of the <HI>Necks</HI> only, tho' it is mainfe&s;t, that in the Mortgage of the <HI>We&s;t-Neck</HI> to <HI>Steenwyck,</HI> here referred to, in this Mortgage, the words <HI>Twenty Miles are contained;</HI> yet when he comes here to mention, that he has formerly Mortga|ged it, he calls it <HI>only by the Name of his We&s;t-Neck,</HI> and thinks this a full De|&s;cription. And why as much &s;hould not be under&s;tood here by <HI>great Neck,</HI> as by <HI>We&s;t-Neck,</HI> I have not yet heard a Rea&s;on. And were I at a lo&s;s to find out the mind of the Grantor, there is yet a <HI>Con&s;ideration,</HI> which in this Court will always have great weight, and that is, 
  <Q>To make &s;uch Con&s;truction of Deeds, when the words will bear it, and &s;uch Expo&s;ition does not break in upon any known Rule of Law, that no party may be hurt by the Con&s;truc|tion.</Q>

 Now it is plain to me, that to confine the word <HI>Neck</HI> in the manner the Defendents would have it; then <HI>Robert Richbell</HI> had not a Security for a fifth part of the Money by him advanced. It is &s;aid by the Complainants, and owned by the Defendents, that the Neck, in the &s;en&s;e the Defendents contend for, contains not above <HI>Three hundred &amp; twenty Acres of Land, the Fee-Simple whereof, at the time of the Mortgage, as the Complainants charge, was not worth above Seventy Pounds, Money of</HI> New-York, <HI>it being a New Country,</HI> &amp; <HI>but very few Inhabitants.</HI> Now, &s;hall it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that when <HI>John Richbell</HI> Mortgaged the Fee-&s;imple of the <HI>we&s;t-neck, running Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck</HI> for <HI>Sixty Pounds,</HI> that he intended that a term of <HI>Ninety Nine years, in a fort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth part of that Quantity of Land,</HI> as a good &s;ecurity for <HI>Two Hundred</HI> and <HI>Fifty Pounds,</HI> it is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e it; be&s;ides, it appears that <HI>John Rich|bell</HI> wanted more Money, and was Obliged to Mortgage the Rever&s;ion of both the <HI>great and we&s;t-neck</HI> for a term of Ninety Nine Years, to commence after the fir&s;t Mortgages upon the&s;e two <HI>Necks</HI> were cleared off. Now, can it be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, if that part of the <HI>great Neck running Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> had not been Mortgaged, that <HI>Kellond</HI> would have left that, and ac|cepted &s;o mean a &s;ecurity as a term of Ninety Nine Years, in the Rever&s;ion of <HI>the great and We&s;t-Neck,</HI> after the term of Ninety Nine Years &s;hould be ex|pired, or the Sum of two Hundred and Fifty Pounds, and Two Thou&s;and four Hundred Guilders, and Intere&s;t, &s;hould be paid, when he well knew, that no Lands at that time in the&s;e parts, would let for any annual Rent at all. I &s;ay, the&s;e are Improbabilities, and may only be po&s;&s;ible; but it is the more Rational Conclu&s;ion, that <HI>John Richbell</HI> and <HI>Mr. Kellond</HI> well Knowing <HI>both the whole great neck and we&s;t-neck to be Mortgaged, and that</HI> John <HI>having &s;ettled his Ea&s;t-neck for a Jointure on his Wife, he had then nothing left but to give a Second Mortgage on all that he had,</HI> which was the Rever&s;ion of his <HI>great and We&s;t-Neck.</HI> Then, as to what was urged by the Complainants, upon reading of the third Mortgage of <HI>Richbell</HI> to <HI>Steenwyck,</HI> under which the Defendents al&s;o claim the <HI>We&s;t-Neck,</HI> I cannot conclude with them, that be|cau&s;e in this Mortgage neither the Mortgagor, nor the Mortgagee have taken any Notice of any former Mortgage being upon the We&s;t-Neck, and that the Mortgagor hath al&s;o 

  <Q>Covenanted, That the &s;ame &s;hall be peaceably held and enjoyed by the Mortgagee, his Heirs, Executors, Admini&s;trators &amp; A&s;&s;igns, freed and Di&s;charged from all other and former Bargains and Sales, &amp;c.</Q>

 I &s;ay, I cannot pre&s;ume, as the Complainants in&s;i&s;t, that the former Mortgage of the We&s;t-Neck, to <HI>Steenwyck</HI> the Mortgager, was paid off, and that this la&s;t Mortgage for &s;ecuring the payment of One Hundred and Twenty five Pounds to <HI>Steenwyck,</HI> was for all the Money that was then Due by Bond, or other-wi&s;e, Tho' it &s;eems Strange, that <HI>Steenwyck</HI> &s;hould advance the Sum of One Hundred
<PB N="17" REF="002940_0017_0FE69B9ED5A0B670">and Twenty Pounds upon a New Mortgage of the We&s;t-Neck, which was Mortgaged to him&s;elf before, and not take any Notice of a former Mortgage or the Money due to him upon that Mortgage, nor include the Money due to him upon the &s;everal Bonds &s;et forth in the Defendents An&s;wer; nor mu&s;t I pre|&s;ume, that the Obliterations on the back of this Mortgage Deed, as the Com|plainants alledge, are Receipts for payment of Money due upon that Mort|gage; for as they cannot be read, I mu&s;t leave them as they are, and pre&s;ume, as the Heir of <HI>Richbell</HI> has done (when he &s;old the Rever&s;ion of the We&s;t-Neck to the Defendents) that the Money on this and the other Mortgages, was due, and by &s;o doing, I hurt no Per&s;on; and the &s;ame is not otherwi&s;e pro|perly in Di&s;pute now&punc; than that the Complainants would &s;how, that the Defendents have no rea&s;on to endeavour to &s;tretch their Claims to the Lands of the great Neck, &s;eeing the Lands of the We&s;t-Neck are a far greater &s;atisfaction than they pretend the Defendents had any Right to; but, as the Heir of <HI>Rich|bell</HI> has Relea&s;ed to the Defendents the Equity of Redemption of the We&s;t-Neck, I cannot think the Con&s;ideration of his &s;o doing, ought to be Enquired into here, upon this Suit. And the ca&s;e being &s;tript of all the&s;e particular Circum|&s;tances, charged in the Bill, and &s;et forth, confe&s;&s;ed or denyed in the Defendents An&s;wer, It will &s;tand thus.</P>

<HEAD>Opinion of the Court upon the Ca&s;e &s;o &s;tated.</HEAD>
<P>AND <HI>Now upon the whole &s;tate of the Ca&s;e,</HI>
 As to the Land in Que&s;tion, I think it appears very plain, that the word <HI>Neck</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood in the Ca&s;e before me, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e it is u&s;ed both in the Patent and Deeds; and in the Patent it appears <HI>the whole Tract of Land is &s;aid to be contained in Three Necks, and its South Bounds is the Sound, &amp; its North Bounds is Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> Now, it is plain, there is <HI>not two parcels</HI> of Land, for the very Tract that runs Twenty Miles into the Woods, has the Sound for its Bounds to the Southward, and in this &s;en&s;e the Patentee, <HI>John Richbell,</HI> under&s;tood the word <HI>Neck,</HI> as ap|pears by the fir&s;t Grant he made of one of the&s;e three <HI>Necks,</HI> in about a year after the Date of his Patent, I mean, his Deed to <HI>Rider,</HI> in Tru&s;t for a Joyn|ture to his Wife: In the Premi&s;&s;es of which Deed, he calls it the <HI>Ea&s;t-Neck,</HI> and de&s;cribes it by the&s;e words <HI>including therein betwixt the two Lines, all the Lands, as well North into the Woods above</HI> We&s;tche&s;ter <HI>Path Twenty Miles, as the Lands below the Path towards the Sound,</HI> Habendum <HI>the &s;aid Neck of Land.</HI> So here we have as particular an account and De&s;cription of what the Grantor, <HI>John Richbell</HI> under&s;tood to be called a <HI>Neck of Land</HI> as words can expre&s;s; and in the next Deed he makes, which is the Mortgage of the We&s;t Neck to <HI>Steenwyck,</HI> he u&s;es the word <HI>Neck</HI> in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, and De&s;cribes it to be his the &s;aid <HI>John Richbells Neck or piece of Land,</HI> lying upon the Main, being the mo&s;t We&s;terly Neck of the three, limitting <HI>the Neck of Land</HI> afore|&s;aid, upon the gravelly or &s;toney Water, which is the Ea&s;terly Limits of Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> and, <HI>having at the South-&s;ide the Sound, and running thus from the marked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> upon the &s;aid necks, Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> So here we find the &s;ame De&s;cription of <HI>a Neck of Land</HI> as before, <HI>the &s;ame Neck running Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> And then, as to the Mortgage of <HI>John Richbell</HI> to <HI>Robert Richbell,</HI> concerning the meaning of which, the pre&s;ent Controver&s;ie is, I can|not conceive how the Grantor or Mortgagor, by the word <HI>Neck,</HI> in this Deed, &s;hould be under&s;tood to mean le&s;s than in his other Deeds of Mortgages; for here he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ells all his Right, Title &amp; Intere&s;t in &amp; to one <HI>Neck,</HI> commonly called and <HI>known</HI> by the name of <HI>the great Neck,</HI> border'd or <HI>bounded by the Sound on the one end, and between his other two &s;mall Necks on each &s;ide of the great Neck afore&s;aid,</HI> Haben|dum, <HI>all the &s;aid great Neck.</HI> Now what occa&s;ions the di&s;pute, is, that this <HI>neck</HI> is not &s;aid or De&s;cribed to run <HI>Northward from the marked Trees on the &s;aid Neck twenty Miles into the woods;</HI> which words I <HI>conceive,</HI> are not needful in the <HI>de&s;cription</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="002940_0020_0FE69BB24959A570">of this <HI>Neck,</HI> or at lea&s;t the want of them, cannot be under&s;tood to limit or con|fine this <HI>Great Neck</HI> to any Bounds &s;hort of the Extent of <HI>Twenty Miles,</HI> as the others run; for, Can there be a plainer De&s;cription of it, than here is, to wit, <HI>Bounded by the Sound on the one End, and between his two &s;mall Necks on each &s;ide.</HI> The Patent has de&s;cribed <HI>all the Necks to run Twenty Miles northward; John Richbell</HI> has De&s;cribed both the <HI>other two Necks to run Twenty Miles, north|ward into the Woods:</HI> And what need could there be, for de&s;cribing <HI>the North Bounds of the middle Neck,</HI> after he had De&s;cribed it to lye <HI>between his other two &s;mall Necks?</HI> or by what words are we to find out the Extent of the <HI>Great Neck</HI> to the Northward, if it mu&s;t not run into the Woods as far as the others? Sup|po&s;e <HI>John Richbell</HI> had &s;aid to his Uncle <HI>Robert,</HI> as the truth is, 
  <Q>I have &s;et|led my <HI>Ea&s;t-Neck</HI> upon my Wife for a Joynture, and my <HI>We&s;t-Neck</HI> I have Mortgaged in fee to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck</HI> for Sixty Pounds; I will now give you a Mortgage of Ninety nine Years on my <HI>Great Neck,</HI> lying between my two <HI>&s;mall necks</HI> for two Hundred and Fifty Pounds.</Q>

 Now, can any body &s;uppo&s;e, without doing Violence to Rea&s;on, that becau&s;e he called it his <HI>great Neck,</HI> and Mortgaged it only for a term of years, and for above double the Sum of Money advanced upon the Fee-&s;imple of the <HI>We&s;t-Neck,</HI> that there|fore he did not intend him a Twentieth or thirtieth part or quantity of the Land for his Security. I think his having fir&s;t de&s;cribed the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Necks,</HI> as running Twenty Miles into the Woods, it was a full and compleat De&s;cription of the <HI>great Neck,</HI> and of its Extending as far as the others, when he bounded it by his two <HI>&s;mall Necks,</HI> on each &s;ide: And this Opinion is &s;ufficiently &s;up|ported by the &s;ub&s;equent Mortgage of <HI>John Richbell</HI> to <HI>Thomas Kellond,</HI> where he recites his having before Mortgaged both his <HI>Middle</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Necks;</HI> for tho' he well knew he had formerly, in expre&s;s words, Mortgaged the <HI>We&s;t-Neck</HI> running Twenty Miles into the Woods, to <HI>Steenwyck;</HI> and his <HI>Great Neck</HI> only by words of being between his other two <HI>&s;mall necks:</HI> yet here when he comes to &s;peak of the&s;e <HI>Necks,</HI> as being formerly Mortgaged, he &s;hews plainly, that he under&s;tood the word <HI>Neck,</HI> when apply'd to the <HI>great Neck,</HI> to mean the &s;ame thing as it did, when apply'd to <HI>We&s;t-Neck,</HI> for his words are the&s;e, 
  <Q>Grant, Bargain and to Farm-Let unto <HI>Thomas Kellond,</HI> &amp;c. the Rever&s;ion of one <HI>Neck</HI> of Land, commonly called or known by the Name of the <HI>great Neck,</HI> as al&s;o the Rever&s;ion of one other <HI>Neck</HI> of Land, being the <HI>mo&s;t we&s;terly Neck</HI> of Land of the three, which is Mortgaged to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck.</HI></Q>

 He has not &s;aid, as al&s;o the Rever&s;ion of one other <HI>Neck</HI> of Land, being he mo&s;t we&s;terly of the three, and running from the marked Trees on the &s;aid <HI>Neck</HI> Twenty Miles into the Woods; Here there might have been &s;ome room to &s;ay he meant one thing by <HI>Neck,</HI> and another thing by <HI>Neck running Twenty Miles into the Woods;</HI> but as he has not &s;aid &s;o, but the contrary, it would be hard to put &s;uch a Con&s;truction on his Intentions, when his words would never warrant, but Contradict &s;uch a &s;trained Con&s;truction. Now if we come to the Parties them&s;elves, I mean the <HI>Complainants</HI> &amp; <HI>Defendants</HI> in this Cau&s;e, it does appear that &s;omething more than the Quantity of Land lying between the two Creeks, was meant by their Articles of Agreement before|mentioned; for there it is &s;aid, 
  <Q>That fora&s;much that it did not then appear that the <HI>Line</HI> runing into the Woods between <HI>the Great and We&s;t-Neck,</HI> had ever been &s;ettled, markt out, or even the Cour&s;e that it ought to run, appointed or limitted; therefore to prevent differences between the Parties to the &s;aid Articles, if the Defendent, <HI>Courtland,</HI> &s;hould happen to purcha&s;e the Rever&s;ion of the <HI>We&s;t-Neck,</HI> the &s;aid Complainants and De|fendants
<PB N="21" REF="002940_0021_0FE69BB269186A90">to view the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>we&s;t-necks,</HI> and endeavour amicably to &s;ettle <HI>the line to its Extent into the Woods</HI> between the &s;ame <HI>Necks.</HI></Q>

 Now, if nothing was under&s;tood by the Parties, by the word <HI>Neck,</HI> but the Land lying between the two Creeks, as far as the Tide or Salt Water flows, as the De|fendents in&s;i&s;t: how id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, nay, how ab&s;urd was it to take all this Caution about runing <HI>a Line between the two Necks,</HI> if no more was intended? or, can it be under&s;tood, that the words <HI>&s;ettling the Line to its Extent into the Woods,</HI> between the <HI>&s;ame Necks,</HI> can be &s;atisfied with this Con&s;truction? No, it is Contradicting common &s;en&s;e, in my Opinion, to &s;ay &s;o; but I do not rely &s;o far upon the Articles, as to alter either the words or Intent of <HI>John Richbell,</HI> in his &s;aid &s;e|veral Grants or Mortgages, but by the Articles it is evident, as well as by the An&s;wer, that the Complainants claimed the <HI>Great Neck,</HI> as Extending <HI>North|ward Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> And tho' the words <HI>Twenty Miles</HI> were &s;truck out, as not being a proper Recital of the words of the Mortgage and Relea&s;e, under which the Complainants claim, yet it appears they all agreed to run <HI>a Line to its Extent into the Woods, between the two Necks.</HI> And for as much as the Defendants well knew the Claim of the Complainants, and at that time talk'd of purcha&s;ing nothing but the Rever&s;ion of the <HI>We&s;t-Neck,</HI> upon which they had two Mortgages; and tho' &s;ome thing was &s;aid, as appears by the An&s;wer, of getting the Relea&s;e from the Heir of <HI>Richbell,</HI> &s;o General as to include a piece of Land formerly Exchanged with Mr. <HI>Pell,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Richbell</HI> bordering upon the <HI>we&s;t-neck,</HI> yet it neither appears from the Articles, nor the An&s;wer it &s;elf, that ever the Defendants Di&s;covered the lea&s;t De&s;ign of pur|cha&s;ing any part of the <HI>great Neck,</HI> or of <HI>the Lands,</HI> as the Defendants call them, <HI>running from the &s;aid Neck Twenty Miles northward into the Woods,</HI> but the Contrary; and it is plain enough, that what the parties &s;eemed apprehen&s;ive of differing about, was <HI>the Running of the Line between the two Necks, to its Extent into the Woods,</HI> that is, lea&s;t the Owners of the <HI>We&s;t-Neck</HI> &s;hould en|deavour to run the <HI>Line</HI> too far <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI> upon the <HI>Great Neck,</HI> or that the Owners of the <HI>great Neck</HI> &s;hould endeavour to run the <HI>Line</HI> too far <HI>We&s;tward</HI> upon the <HI>We&s;t-Neck;</HI> and this appears plainly to be the intent of the&s;e Articles, as to the Land in Controver&s;ie: And that both the <HI>Complainants</HI> &amp; <HI>Defendants,</HI> as well as <HI>John Richbell,</HI> under&s;tood more by the word <HI>Neck,</HI> than the Land between the two Creeks, as far as the Tyde flows. So that what appears here to be meant by the word <HI>Neck,</HI> in the Patent, and the &s;everal Mortgages that have been produced, &amp; by the Articles them&s;elves, I mu&s;t be of Opinion, that the De&s;cription of the <HI>middle neck</HI> is as Exten&s;ive as the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> &amp; <HI>We&s;t,</HI> &amp; if &s;o, the Defendants by their Relea&s;e of <HI>Ed. Richbells</HI> Right to all the Lands in <HI>J. Richbells</HI> Purcha&s;e, will not help them, becau&s;e the <HI>great Neck</HI> is expre&s;ly Excepted in their own Deed which has been produced here. Now if it be enquired, how the Equity of the Ca&s;e &s;tands upon the part of the Complainants? I think it is plain|ly with them; for it has been urged by both &s;ides, 
  <Q>That when the words of Deeds are uncertain, they &s;hall receive &s;uch a rea&s;onable Con&s;truction and Ex|po&s;ition, as mu&s;t be without Injury to the Grantor, &amp; with the greate&s;t advan|tage to the Grantee.</Q>

 Now, by this Rule, it is plain, that <HI>J. Richbell</HI> having only Mortgaged, &amp; not &s;old, his <HI>Great Neck</HI> to his uncle <HI>R. Richbell,</HI> if the Neck be under&s;tood to Extend <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> &amp; if that were allowed to be too large a &s;ecurity, yet it was no hurt to <HI>John,</HI> becau&s;e h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had it in his power to redeem it, when he thought fit; but if the meaning of the word <HI>Neck</HI> be limitted, as the Defendants would have it, then the Mortgagee had little or no &s;ecurity for his Money, and was without any further Relief; for as it appears
<PB N="22" REF="002940_0022_0FE69BC0F5C81CB8">by the Mortgage, there was no Covenants for the Payment of the Money to <HI>Robert Richbell:</HI> So that by &s;uch an Expo&s;ition or Con&s;truction of the words of this Mortgage, as the Defendants would make; This Rule of Law would be Inverted, &amp; the greate&s;t Wrong would be done to the Mortgagee. But under|&s;tanding the <HI>Great Neck</HI> to run <HI>to us Extent,</HI> or <HI>to the Extent of the Patent,</HI> which I think is the &s;ame thing, that is, <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> the Com|plainants, who claim under the Mortgage to <HI>Robert Richbell,</HI> will have Ju&s;tice done them, and the Defendants, who well knew before their own Purcha&s;e, that the Complainants had purcha&s;ed the Equity of Redemption of the <HI>great Neck</HI> of <HI>John Richbells</HI> Heir, and Claimed by that Purcha&s;e, <HI>all the Lands to the Extent of the Patent,</HI> cannot be hurt; for in their An&s;wer, it is not &s;o much as &s;ugge&s;ted that the Lands Relea&s;ed to the Defendants, by the Heir of <HI>Richbell,</HI> is not a full Con&s;ideration for their Money, and of a far greater Value than what they paid for them; and were it otherwi&s;e, the Defendants being Purcha&s;ers of what they own they knew the Complainants claimed, they could not, accord|ing to the Cour&s;e of a Court of Equity, expect to be favoured here; 
  <Q>for a Pur|cha&s;er out of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with notice of a former Claim or Incumbrance (and &s;uch as its plain the Defendants are) can never hope to prevail in a Court of Equity.</Q>

</P>
<P><HI>I am therefore of Opinion, that both by the words of the Deeds, the Intent of Parties, and the Equity of this Ca&s;e, the Great Neck does and ought to Extend as far Northward as the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Neck.</HI> And accordingly, it is this pre&s;ent Day, that is, the Second Day of <HI>May,</HI> in the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord, <HI>George,</HI> by the Grace of God, of <HI>Great Bri|tain, France,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ireland,</HI> King, Defender of the Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by his Excellency <HI>William Burnet,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Captain General and Governour in Chief of the Province of <HI>New-York, New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and Territories thereon depending in <HI>America,</HI> and Vice-Admiral of the &s;ame, &amp;c. and Keeper of his Maje&s;ty's great Seal of the Province of <HI>New-York, Ordered, Adjuaged</HI> and <HI>Decreed,</HI> That the Defendant, <HI>Jacobus van Courtland,</HI> do pay to the Complainants, <HI>Jo&s;iah Quinby, Thomas Town&s;end,</HI> and <HI>Richard Cornwall,</HI> the afore&s;aid Sum of One Hundred and Fifty Eight Pounds, with the Intere&s;t thereof from the Date of the Articles of Agreement afore&s;aid, for that Purpo&s;e made; and that the Defendants and all Claiming under them, be enjoyned to De&s;i&s;t making any further Claim or Pre|tence to that Part of the Great Neck which is to the Southwards and Ea&s;t|wards of <HI>Branks</HI>'s <HI>River,</HI> and that they pay the Complainants Co&s;ts of Suit; and it is referred to <HI>Robert Walter,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the Ma&s;ters of this Court, to tax the Complainants Co&s;ts of this Suit, and to make Report thereof to this Court, with all Convenient Expedition.</P>

<P>Its to be ob&s;erved, That as the Complainants entered not upon the Pur|cha&s;e of the We&s;t Neck, till they had fairly askt Mr. <HI>Cortland,</HI> Whether he had thoughts of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and that he &s;lighted it, as by the An&s;wers to the <HI>&s;econd Charge</HI> appears; &s;o, when they found that Mr. <HI>Cortland</HI> became a Compe|titor in the Purcha&s;e, they were willing to de&s;i&s;t upon rea&s;onable Terms; and to agree upon &s;uch, they had many Meetings with the Defendants, in order, that if the Defendants &s;hould happen to become &s;o nigh Neighbours, no Di&s;pute might ari&s;e betwixt them and the Complainants, concerning the <HI>Line</HI> betwixt the <HI>Great-Neck</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Neck,</HI> which then remained un&s;ettled, but that it might be &s;ettled in an amicable manner. It appears confe&s;&s;ed, That during the Treaty, before the Parties began to put their Agreements in writing, <HI>the Line betwixt the Great Neck and We&s;t Neck was talkt of,</HI> But the Defendants avoid &s;aying what was talkt of it, and leave that to be gue&s;&s;ed at; And to give a right gue&s;s, It mu&s;t rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that what is con|tained in the Articles of Agreement (<HI>before printed, fol.</HI> 9, 10 <HI>&amp;</HI> 11.) concern|ing the <HI>Line,</HI> is the Re&s;ult of that Talk. It appears al&s;o confe&s;&s;ed, That during that Treaty, it was talkt, <HI>That the Great Neck extended the length of the Patent,</HI> and that <HI>the Defendant</HI> Philip&s;e, <HI>under&s;tood, that to &s;ecure the Twenty Miles into the Woods, from all Claims, was the Complainants aim;</HI> and the Articles contain a full Declaration, that &s;o was their Aim, even tho' there had been no Declaration of it before. It appears the&s;e Articles were delivered to the Defendants, two days before they were Executed, as the matters that had been treated of, and agreed to in the Treaty; during which two days, the Defendants had them in their keeping to con&s;ider of. By the Articles it appears, that the Complainants agreed, to de&s;i&s;t further Proffers for the We&s;t Neck, which was what was to be done on their Parts; And in Con&s;ideration thereof, the Defendant <HI>Courtland</HI> agreed, to pay their former Charges about it, and <HI>that there might be no di&s;pute, about the Line running into the Woods between the Great and We&s;t Neck.</HI> &mdash;2&mdash; So flagrant an act, as the altering an Agreement, after the Con&s;ideration performed on one part, without con&s;ent of the Parties who had performed, on Faith and Confidence of the Execution of the Articles of Agreement, as they &s;tood at the time of performance, re|quires &s;ome Excu&s;e to be found for it; And the Excu&s;e is, that &s;ays Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e,</HI> the Articles were not agreed to &s;o far as were written, <HI>For, that he took Exception to the words</HI> 20 <HI>Miles upon reading the Articles,</HI> and <HI>told the Complainants of it, the fir&s;t time they came for an An&s;wer.</HI> But whether this

No, the matters in the fir&s;t Charge, and that being their very aim by the Treaty, fully <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ugh &s;how the impo&s;&s;ibility they &s;hould; and its even not &s;o much as pre|tended by all the An&s;wer, that they did agree to leave the&s;e words out, which had they agreed, would not have been forgot. Again, Who made this Ex|ception? Not Mr. <HI>Courtland</HI> the other party contracting, but Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e,</HI> who was not known by the Complainants to have any concern in the thing, further than as a Scriviner, or as a Friend to Mr. <HI>Courtland;</HI> and from Mr. <HI>Philip&s;es</HI> having once Excepted to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e words, it will in no ways follow, that Mr. <HI>Courtland</HI> did not agree to them. Again, as Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> confe&s;&s;es, that in the di&s;cour&s;e in the Treaty, concerning the Great Necks reaching to the Extent of the Patent, he was on the Re&s;erve, is not there great rea&s;on to believe that Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erve was al&s;o u&s;ed here? &s;eeing its concerning the &s;ame thing, &amp; concern|ing which, the Complainants had fully, by the words 20 Miles, in the Articles, Expre&s;&s;ed their intention? Again, can there be any thing &s;o much as &s;uppo&s;ed, that could induce the Complainants, to depart from the&s;e words <HI>Twenty Miles?</HI> It can hardly be imagined, e&s;pecially at that time, when they &s;tood as fair as the Defendants, for the Purcha&s;e of the Remainder of the Patent, they having then the &s;ame Opportunity as the Defendants, to make Proffers for it by the Ship then bound for <HI>London</HI> and tho' the Defendants don't remember the Sight of the Letter, the Complainants put on board of the Ship, yet, as they remember, they told them, they would give &s;uch Orders, it amounts to the &s;ame thing, &s;eeing undoubtedly it was in their Power to give &s;uch Orders. &mdash;3&mdash; Again, will it follow from &s;uch an Exception being once made, <HI>that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;i&s;ted on, and not waved?</HI> It certainly cannot, but if it was made, its not only <HI>unnatural, to think the Complainants should a&s;&s;ent to it,</HI> for the rea&s;ons before, but al&s;o there's the greate&s;t Probability, <HI>that it was not in&s;i&s;ted on, but waved:</HI> For, after the making of it, is confe&s;&s;ed the Treaty dropt, and they came to a Treaty again; how con&s;i&s;tent the An&s;wer is with it &s;elf, and how eva&s;ive concerning that, is left to the <HI>Impartial;</HI> when its con&s;idered, that its &s;aid, before the Treaty dropt, the Sum of 158 Pounds, demanded by the Complainants, was then agreed to; And again, its &s;aid, they met afterwards about the Articles, and talked about the Sum; Its a little Strange, that if the Sum was agreed to before, that that &s;hould be the thing talkt of, for its of things that are in difference, that one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e People would Treat of, and not of things agreed to; And when &s;o Expre&s;s a Demand as is made by the Bill, <HI>Whether at that further Treaty, any other thing was expre&s;&s;ed to be in difference between them, than the Sum?</HI> is con&s;idered with the An&s;wer to it, viz. <HI>But the Defendant</HI> Philip&s;e <HI>denys, that the Sum was the only thing talk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of to be in difference;</HI> Then, what el&s;e was there talked of to be in difference? If any thing el&s;e, it might be rea&s;onably expected, it would have been &s;aid what, but its not &s;aid what, for the words that follow are, <HI>for that the &s;aid words</HI> Twenty Miles <HI>were excepted to, as afore&s;aid;</HI> how is it &s;aid before, that they were Ex|cepted to? <HI>when he read them, he Excepted to them, and told the Complainants &s;o, during the former Treaty;</HI> But &s;ure that won't be &s;aid telling them &s;o, during this la&s;t Treaty: and if &s;o, its plain, that nothing is &s;howed to be treated of, as in difference, during this Treaty, but the Sum.

<PB N="35" REF="002940_0035_0FE69BF8ED4687C8">was agreed to, and filled up in the Articles, the Agreement was Compleat; or had the Defendants then <HI>a secret Re&s;erve,</HI> that they might alter them as they plea&s;ed, after they had got the Complainants Letter back from on board:</HI> is al&s;o con&s;idered with the An&s;wer to it, viz. <HI>The Defendant</HI> Philip&s;e <HI>&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, <HI>he did not secretly Re&s;erve</HI> his Intention, of having that Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Twenty Miles</HI> altered, but declared the &s;ame to them, as afore&s;aid.</HI> How, when, and what did he declare, as afore&s;aid, to that purpo&s;e? <HI>I.e, in a former Treaty, &s;ays, he told them that the words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> should not be there, becau&s;e they were not in</HI> Richbell<HI>'s Mortgage;</HI> But why did he not tell them &s;o now? &s;eeing if he had told them &s;o before, <HI>the Complainants never agreed it should be &s;o;</HI> and if it was not told them now, upon this la&s;t Treaty, (which neither the&s;e Words of his, nor any others in the An&s;wer, can import that he did) and if he then had &s;uch an Intention, <HI>it must have been secretly Re&s;erved to himself,</HI> he having no way Expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch Intention, during this Treaty.

But, <HI>with all due Deference to that his</HI> OATH, the Complainants will beg leave to a&s;&s;ign <HI>a few In&s;tances,</HI> wherein he either under&s;tood the <HI>Necks</HI> to go further, or his Actions did not &s;quare with his Opinion or Under&s;tanding of the <HI>Necks,</HI> or, in plain English, meant one thing, and &s;aid, acted and tran&s;acted another.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t In&s;tance.</HI> Let the Reader turn back to pag. 10. of the <HI>Decree,</HI> where he will find this Clau&s;e in the Articles of Agreement, <HI>Ask whereas it does not appear that the</HI> LINE <HI>running into the Woods, between the &s;aid</HI> GREAT NECK <HI>and the &s;aid</HI> WESTERMOST NECK, <HI>has ever been &s;ettled, run

It appears in the <HI>2d Charge, No. 2.</HI> that Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> tran&s;acted that Agreement for Mr. <HI>Courtland;</HI> Then, the <HI>Candid Reader,</HI> and all the World be&s;ides Mr <HI>Philip&s;e,</HI> will under&s;tand by that Clau&s;e, <HI>That the</HI> GREAT NECK <HI>and</HI> WEST NECK, <HI>were &s;uch things, as were capable of having a</HI> LINE <HI>between them, running into the Woods.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> knows b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t whether he did not under&s;tand &s;o too, by the words <HI>GREAT NECK</HI> and <HI>WEST NECK</HI> there, and <HI>LINE</HI> between them; And if he did not, he can be&s;t tell what he meant by them there; For &s;ure it is, if the <HI>GREAT NECK</HI> extended no further than where the Water comes up, (as he Swears, he always under&s;tood) it could not be divided by a <HI>LINE</HI> from the <HI>WEST NECK,</HI> it being already &s;eperated from it by the Water; and if it was &s;uch a thing as was to be &s;eperated by a LINE, from the WEST NECK, Un|doubtedly, that LINE mu&s;t begin where the Water cea&s;ed to &s;eperate them, and from thence to run into the Woods; and on the one &s;ide of that LINE, (by that Clau&s;e) was the <HI>GREAT NECK</HI> under&s;tood to run, and on the other, the <HI>WEST NECK;</HI> which is further than what the Water, or Nature makes to be a Neck.</P>
<P>The Complainants &s;ay, The Almighty made every thing that is upon the face of the Earth, but did not a&s;&s;ign Names to them, but left that to Man to do, and that &s;ome Men a&s;&s;ign one, and others another Name to the &s;ame thing; and &s;ome by one Name under&s;tand one thing, others by the &s;ame Name under|&s;tand another thing. <HI>For Exemple,</HI> The Geographers and the Learned World, under&s;tand by <HI>a Neck of Land,</HI> that which joyns a Penin&s;ula (or what's al|mo&s;t an I&s;land) to the Continent or Main Land; and the &s;imilitude &s;eemeth to be drawn from the human Body; for as the Neck there joyns the Head to the Body, &s;o a Neck of Land joyns a Penin&s;ula to a Continent; and there, neither the Penin&s;ula nor the Continent are under&s;tood to be included in the Neck, no more than the Head or Body of a Man are included in his Neck. Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> again, being a little more favourable to the Complainants, than the learned World, in the meaning of a <HI>Neck of Land,</HI> allows it to contain, not only what the Learned World under&s;tand by <HI>a Neck of Land,</HI> but al&s;o the Penin&s;ula it &s;elf, or &s;omething in a gro&s;s way, allows the <HI>Head</HI> to be part of the <HI>Neck:</HI> This certainly is favourable! &s;eeing the Complainants can &s;how no Title to the Penin&s;ula, more than to the part of the Main Land they claim; and of Con&s;equence, had he dealt with them &s;o hard as the Learned World, (it &s;eems) would do, in&s;tead of 320 Acres, that he allows them, the learned World would not have left them, perhaps, the 20 Acres; &s;o the 300 is a piece of meer Favour and Grace.</P>
<P>But others again, (in &s;till a more gro&s;s and vulgar way) &s;uch as <HI>Governour Lovelace, John Richbell, John Rider, Robert Richbell, Steenwick, Kelland, Edward Richbell,</HI> and the <HI>Complainants,</HI> by the Patent and Deeds before Printed, tell you plainly, that they under&s;tand, that a <HI>Neck of Land</HI> con|tains, not only the <HI>Neck,</HI> (as the Learned World under&s;tand it) and the whole <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> is &s;o favourable to under&s;tand it) but al&s;o a part of the <HI>Main Land</HI> be&s;ides; and even Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> by his Words and Actions, for near one year (as by this and the eleven following <HI>In&s;tances</HI> will appear) had the &s;ame way of Thinking of a <HI>Neck</HI> too.

<PB N="43" REF="002940_0043_0FE69C16E21985D0">don't deny that the Name is gro&s;s, and far from being accurate and expre&s;&s;ive the thing meant; but its &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me Excu&s;e, that the whole Herd of Statuaries and Painters have given as gro&s;s and unapt Names from things meant by them; As, By what they call a <HI>Head,</HI> they mean <HI>Head, Neck</HI> and <HI>Shoulders.</HI> Our Fore-Fathers, (whom we ought not to de&s;pi&s;e) have by a <HI>Yard of Land,</HI> meant often, many Acres, whereas the Learned World, by <HI>A Yard of Land,</HI> don't mean &s;o much as the <HI>Four hundreath part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one Acre.</HI> Nay, for one Name that's accurately Expre&s;&s;ive, of the thing meant by it, the Complainants will be at no great lo&s;s to a&s;&s;ign ten Names that are not.

<PB N="45" REF="002940_0045_0FE69C1CB2BD9020"><HI>meant more by the Word</HI> NECK, <HI>Thrice mentioned in the Additional Articles, than by his An&s;wer, he Swears he always did;</HI> Or el&s;e <HI>He meant to give more than half of the Incumbrances on the</HI> WEST NECK, <HI>for what's much le&s;s than</HI> 160 <HI>Acres of Unimproved Land.</HI> If he meant the fir&s;t, the Complai|nants think the Reader will be at &s;ome Difficulty to reconcile it with his Oath; for the Complainants cannot &s;ee how to Reconcile them; And if he meant the la&s;t, the Reader will be no le&s;s at a L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s to Reconcile his then Moderation, and his now Va&s;t Demands. And the Complainants think, the Man will be of a happy Invention, that can &s;how what el&s;e Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> meant, if he meant neither of the&s;e, barring that of his Meaning as <HI>Hackerton</HI> did of his Cow, or which is the &s;ame, That he meant, that he was to mean by the Word NECK, when the Complainants &s;hould Claim; by it, only &s;o far as the Water comes; but when he him&s;elf &s;hould Claim by it, in that Agreement, then he was to mean all that, and Twenty Miles more. This Third Meaning of <HI>Hackerton</HI>'s the Complainants allow, he might have, and therefore they mu&s;t barr the Man of Invention from a&s;&s;igning that as another Meaning.</P>

<P>Above, the Complainants have a&s;&s;igned a Dozen of In&s;tances, and if a nece&s;&s;ity were for it, could a&s;&s;ign as many more, wherein, according to the Conception of Men of common Rea&s;on, the Defendant <HI>Philip&s;e,</HI> mu&s;t have under&s;tood more by the NECKS, than to where the Water comes up; and that, he under&s;tood where the Water cea&s;ed to divide THE NECKS, they were to begin to be divided by A LINE, from thence running into the Woods: And if every Man of common Rea&s;on, mu&s;t &s;o interpret his Words and Actions; Why mu&s;t all the&s;e Clamours be again&s;t the Court for &s;o under|&s;tanding them? when without under&s;tanding them &s;o, the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Ab&s;urdities and Contradictions mu&s;t of Cour&s;e follow. But the rea&s;on of his Swearing, he always under&s;tood &s;o of the <HI>Necks,</HI> may be gue&s;&s;ed at a little; becau&s;e, if he allows they go beyond the place where the Water divides them, whatever
<PB N="47" REF="002940_0047_0FE69C2859298B28">rea&s;on will carry them one Foot beyond it, will carry them to the Extent of the Patent; for, let but <HI>A LINE</HI> be, and he well knows there's no &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pping it till it come there. But when he Swore &s;o, he mu&s;t have either Thought his Antagoni&s;ts &s;o Blind, as not to &s;ee thro' it, or, that if they did, they would not, or dur&s;t not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enture to point it out: which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t he conceived not altogether ami&s;s in, for tho' they very well &s;aw that, and many other things herein &s;et forth, before the hearing, yet they were very loath to Touch upon them, and what they did towards it, was in &s;o tender Touches, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ew but Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> him&s;elf could gather much from them; and that becau&s;e, they thought the Deeds them&s;elves, made all clear enough, without dipping into the&s;e things; and &s;o the matter &s;hould have remained upon that footing only, if &s;o many vile, fal&s;e and &s;candalous Reports. Reproaches and Clamours, had not &s;ince the Decree, been invented and &s;pread thro this Province, of this Cau&s;e, and of the Complainants, and of mo&s;t who have dared to do their duty in it, (by who&s;e means the Complainants &s;ay not, but leave the Reader to gue&s;s) that more than &s;ufficiently, give the&s;e Complainants cau&s;e, to keep the Truth no longer hid.</P>
<P>But to proceed,&mdash;5&mdash;The Complainants &s;hall agree, that Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> now began a little nearer to &s;quare his Actions and Words, with what he Swears, always was his Meaning of the NECKS. And in order to that, it being, by the <HI>3d Clau&s;e</HI> of the Articles of Agreement, in the mo&s;t Expre&s;s words agreed, <HI>That in ca&s;e the Parties cannot by them&s;elves agree How the</HI> LINE OF DIVISION <HI>between the</HI> TWO NECKS <HI>shall Run</HI> TO ITS EXTENT (as Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> has made it) <HI>into the Woods, Then they have agreed, to leave the Determination thereof to &s;ix Indifferent Per&s;ons.</HI> The fir&s;t Step that's taken, is to break th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat Solemn, Plain and Expre&s;s Agreement: That this his Declining to enter into Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds, was a breaking thro' it, is plain; for when People agree to leave a Thing to the Determination of others, it cer|tainly mu&s;t be thereby al&s;o tacitly agreed, to do every thing that may be nece&s;|&s;ary to impower the&s;e to Determine, and to compel the Performance of what's determined; and the denying to do the&s;e things, (as here to enter into Bonds) is a denying to comply with the Agreement, or in plain terms breaking thro' it.&mdash;6&mdash;The Sequel &s;hows, how much of verity there was in this; if he thought that Power from Mr <HI>Courtland,</HI> and his verbal a&s;&s;ent, impowered the <HI>Arbitrators,</HI> why would not he al&s;o give his Bond; Its &s;aid <HI>AN HONEST MAN,</HI> will never Scruple his Bond where he gives his Word; for AN HONEST MAN, values his Word as much as his Bond, and &s;hould think it a Di&s;honour to him, for any one to think it of le&s;s force; but it &s;eems Mr. <HI>PHILIPSE</HI> here, did not put an equal Value on them.&mdash;7&mdash;The next &s;tep Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> took, to &s;quare his Actions and his Words, with what he Swears always was his meaning; was, <HI>that the Defendant</HI> Philip&s;e <HI>then ob&s;erved, that the</HI> TWENTY MILES INTO THE WOODS, <HI>was</HI> A SEPARATE GRANT, <HI>and that the</HI> NECK, <HI>cannot go further than the Water makes it &s;o.</HI> How much truth was in this Ob&s;ervation, and whether this was not the fir&s;t time, he had ever opened his <HI>RESERVE,</HI> by telling the Complainants &s;o; the Reader is referred to the Patent, Deeds and Decree it &s;elf, which fully di&s;cu&s;s that matter; and to the 6th Ob&s;ervation on the <HI>3d Charge,</HI> to judge by. And how <HI>Ju&s;t, Equitable</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cionable,</HI> his preten&s;ion by <HI>Edward Richbell</HI>'s Relea&s;e is, the Reader is referred, to the <HI>fir&s;t Charge</HI> and Ob&s;ervations thereon, to judge by.&mdash;8&mdash;Mr. Philip&s;es <HI>denying, that this was the fir&s;t time, that he had Expre&s;&s;ed his Sentiments about the Boundaries;</HI> mu&s;t appear very Eva&s;ive and Ambigu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us; when its con&s;idered, that a Man may have different
<PB N="48" REF="002940_0048_0FE69C2B17901AC0">Sentiments at different Times, and declaring any of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, comes up to all this: and this may as well mean, that he had before declared his Sentiments, that the Boundaries of the <HI>GREAT NECK,</HI> went to the Extent of the Patent, as that they did not; but when its con&s;idered, that Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e,</HI> for near a years time, <HI>viz.</HI> From the Executing of the Articles to this time, <HI>had different Sentiments, even at the &s;ame times,</HI> viz. a Set of <HI>EXPRESSED SENTI|MENTS</HI> by his Words and Actions that A LINE was to be run between the GREAT NECK and WEST NECK, as appears from the 12 In&s;tances before, and a Set of <HI>RESERVED SENTIMENTS,</HI> that NO LINE was to be run at all, &s;eeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Swears, he always under&s;tood the NECKS to reach no further than the Wat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and of Con&s;equence, not capable of being divided by A LINE. Now his <HI>Expre&s;sed Sentiments,</HI> its agreed, this was not the fir&s;t time he declared them, but as to the others, he can hardly &s;how a probability, to induce any Man to believe he did declare them to the Complai|nants before; &s;eeing, his <HI>Expre&s;sed Sentiments,</HI> were &s;o Diametrically oppo&s;ite thereto. The next Paragraph, <HI>viz. And affirms, that he had long before, and at &s;everal times, told &s;ome of the Complainants, they had a Right to no more than the <HI>Middle Neck</HI> only; as has been &s;et forth before.</HI> When its con&s;idered, will appear equally Ambiguous with the la&s;t; for, as to what's before the words, <HI>as has been &s;et forth before,</HI> its agreed he might tell them &s;o, and the Complainants never pretended to any more than the <HI>Middle Neck;</HI> but they always under&s;tood the <HI>Middle Neck,</HI> to extend further than what he &s;ays he under&s;tood it, &s;o that that was ju&s;t nothing. Then does the words, <HI>as has been &s;et forth before</HI> determine his meaning here, to be theirs or his? No, for the Complainants &s;et forth before, that the <HI>Middle</HI> or <HI>Great Neck,</HI> does extend to the Extent of the Patent, and he otherwi&s;e, and which of the&s;e is meant, is left Ambiguous. The next Paragraph is, <HI>The alteration of the Articles, was declared at fir&s;t &s;ight thereof.</HI> The Complainants need not di&s;pute that, &s;eeing, as before, they were not with him at the fir&s;t &s;ight thereof, as appears by the 2d and 6th Articles, and latter part of the fir&s;t Article of the 3d Charge, and the Ob&s;ervations thereon; and of Con&s;equence, that declaration was not to them. The next Paragraph is, <HI>And at the time of making the alteration, not objected again&s;t by them, as is &s;et forth before.</HI> That the alteration was objected to, the Complainants conceive plain, from what appears under the 6th Article of the 4th Charge, and Ob&s;ervations thereon. But why did not Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> once mention to the Arbitrators, <HI>this (&s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on) Argument,</HI> that he objected to the words <HI>TWENTY MILES</HI> before hand; it &s;eems very &s;trange, that what he now conceives, <HI>&s;o weighty an Argument,</HI> &s;hould have been intirely forgot by him, and not one word of it thought of, at lea&s;t Expre&s;&s;ed, during all this Arbitration, the Complainants may well &s;ay &s;o, &s;eeing thro' all his An&s;wer he does not &s;ay he did; but to make up for it, he here introduces in his An&s;wer, concerning the Tran&s;actions before the Arbitrators, a repetition of the old Story, in order probably to induce the&s;e who read it unwarily, to think that it was a matter in&s;i&s;ted on or mentioned before the Arbitrators: but whoever will but read it, with the lea&s;t Attention, may ea&s;ily &s;ee, its not pretended to be a matter mentioned to the Arbitrators; tho' &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly &s;o introduced, as to make it &s;eem as if it had. And as its Evident from hence, that this mighty new pretence, of having objected to the TWENTY MILES beforehand, and of having told the Complainants thereof, was not &s;o much as once thought on, or mentioned before the Arbitrators, the Reader is left to judge, whether that gives not a great deal of Ground, to Su&s;pect that to be AN AFTER THOUGHT, as is before hinted, under <HI>Charge 3d, No.</HI> 2 and 6; for, had
<PB N="49" REF="002940_0049_0FE69C2BA1FA74B0">&s;uch a thing ever been, its hardly rea&s;onable to be &s;uppo&s;ed, it would have been then forgot; &s;eeing that time, was within a year of the Tran&s;action. And to &s;u&s;pect that Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> finding his GRAND ARGUMENT before the Arbitrators (in the next Article) Defeated, by making it &s;o obvious to his memory, that the Facts then a&s;&s;erted by him were untrue: there was a nece&s;&s;ity of thinking, or dreaming of &s;ome colour or other, to make an excu&s;e, for that flagrant act, of &s;triking out the word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> TWENTY MILES, after the Con|&s;ideration for the Agreement had been accepted of; and that without Con&s;ent of the Parties, as before in the <HI>3d Charge</HI> fully has appeared. And when the &s;everal places in the An&s;wer, where this Exception or Objection is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">epeated; <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">77, 95, 110, 112, 113, 115, 118, 147, 148, 149.</NOTE> are carefully con&s;ider'd together, the&s;e Su&s;picions will be not a little encrea&s;|ed. <HI>Truth is always the &s;ame, but the Contrary varies.</HI> But the&s;e Su&s;picions, will be much more encrea&s;ed, when he means that Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> is capable of taking, for to gain his Ends (as in the <HI>2d Charge</HI>) are con&s;idered, with his Swearing concerning his Opinion of the <HI>Necks,</HI> (as in the beginning of the Ob&s;ervations on the <HI>4th Charge</HI>) and concerning the power of Attorney (as in the Ob&s;ervations on the An&s;wer in general.)</P>
<P>And now We come to the GRAND ARGUMENT in&s;i&s;ted on before the Arbitrators, &mdash;9&mdash; which the Reader is de&s;ired to turn back to, and carefully to peru&s;e. The GRAND ARGUMENT it may be called, for had it been true, there would have been a great deal of weight in it. As for the other ARGUMENT, <HI>That the</HI> NECKS <HI>are to the Markt Trees, and what's above them is a &s;eperate Grant,</HI> it may well be called the LITTLE ARGUMENT, in re&s;pect of the Other; in &s;o far, as any Man of very moderate Capacity, by looking over <HI>Lovelace</HI>'s Patent (above, Printed in <HI>fol.</HI> 1 and 2, of the Decree) cannot be long in Determining, that the Facts of that Argument are Untrue; For its plain, there's not <HI>Two Grants,</HI> but <HI>One Grant,</HI> Not <HI>Two Tracts,</HI> but <HI>One Tract,</HI> granted thereby. But this Argu|ment appearing &s;o fully Refuted in the Decree, there's no need here of fur|ther &s;howing the <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Littlene&s;s</HI> of it. But Unluckily the GRAND ARGUMENT falls to the Ground! That Matter being &s;o lately tran&s;acted, as within a year, and in &s;o Unhand&s;om a manner, (as before, in the <HI>3d Charge</HI> appears) that it could not but leave lively Impre&s;&s;ions of the Circum&s;tances thereof, on the Complainants Minds; which being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id before him in &s;o &s;trong a manner, we find it brought the matter too clear in his Memory to deny it. But had this Matter been &s;lowly followed, its &s;ubmitted to the Reader, Whether, probably, <HI>Mr. Philip&s;e</HI> would not have in time, Sworn the&s;e Things to be True, which he now, before the Arbitrators, &s;o gravely A&s;&s;erted to be True, and which by his An&s;wer on this Point, he con|fe&s;&s;es, He was Mi&s;taken in. Its al&s;o here &s;ubmitted to the Reader to judge by this, Whether Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> be any way entitled to the Ob&s;ervation con|cerning Memories, in the <HI>6th Article</HI> of the <HI>3d Charge?</HI> And if he &s;hould be of Opinion, That this no ways entitles him to it, then they refer the Rea|der to the Ob&s;ervations on the An&s;wer in general. Its al&s;o &s;ubmitted to the Reader to judge, Whether at that time, had he been in the Complainants Ca&s;e, he had not a great deal of rea&s;on to believe, he &s;hould &s;oon be clear of the Preten&s;ions of Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e,</HI> &s;eeing the ONLY ARGUMENTS he then pretended to u&s;e, before the Arbitrators, were &s;o clearly Refuted, as

<P><HI>Impartial Reader,</HI> Con&s;ider that long Story of 24 pages, and &s;ay to what U&s;e can it be of, in this Cau&s;e, other than to throw Dirt at the Complainants and others, and to encrea&s;e Charges, by &s;welling the Proceedings to an Ex|ce&s;&s;ive L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gth; for the Facts pretended to be obviated by it, are not in the lea&s;t obviated thereby: Is the Complainants Kindne&s;s and Candidne&s;s, <HI>in tell|ing the Defendants of the Heir, and enquiring whether Mr.</HI> Courtland <HI>had intentions to purcha&s;e,</HI> any thing the le&s;s, for the Defendants knowing of the Heir before hand? No &s;urely, for their Kindne&s;s and Candidne&s;s was the &s;ame. And this long Story is &s;o far from an&s;wering that purpo&s;e of Obvi|ating the&s;e Facts, that on the contrary, it plainly demon&s;trates a Tract of Unfair Dealing in the Defendants; for <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">65.</NOTE> the Defendant <HI>Philip&s;e calls it <HI>undermining</HI> in the</HI> Palmers, <HI>for to have Treated for the We&s;t-Neck, becau&s;e Mr.</HI> Courtland <HI>had &s;o great an Intere&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n it by the Incumbrances he had on it;</HI> Tho' the Complainants acted &s;o Candidly, and with Notice, as before. Now if the Complainants Treaty for the <HI>We&s;t Neck</HI> de&s;erves that Name, when the Defendants confe&s;s, <HI>They had Expended no Money in the Improvement of it,</HI> What mu&s;t this Treaty of the Defendants, for the whole Right of the Heir, and of con&s;equence for the <HI>Great Neck,</HI> de&s;erve the Name of? when its confe&s;&s;ed by the Defendants, <HI>That the Complainants had been &s;o long in quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and Expended &s;o much in the Improvement of it,</HI> as in the <HI>fir&s;t Charge</HI> appears, and that without any Notice to the Complainants of &s;uch Treaty, or asking them, whether they had thoughts of Purcha&s;ing, as in the <HI>Second Charge</HI> appears. Certainly if the Complainants Treaty for the <HI>We&s;t-Neck</HI> de&s;erves the Name of UNDERMINING, this Treaty of the Defendants de&s;erves no le&s;s.</P>
<P>Again, What is it to this Cau&s;e, if all that's &s;aid about Sending the Power of Attorney home, were true? No Man of Sen&s;e will &s;ay that it affects the Cau&s;e, but very much affects the Characters of the Complainants and Mr. <HI>Haskoll;</HI> and were it true, &s;hows them to be Vile Men, to be guilty of &s;uch Underhand and Unfair Dealing (Whether it has any Affinity with giving Orders to Treat with the Complainants Corre&s;pondents, as in the <HI>2d Charge</HI> appears, the Complainants leave the Reader to judge) But will it be a Rea&s;on becau&s;e the Complainants (as Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> a&s;&s;erts) are Vile Men, and have dealt Unfairly by Mr. <HI>Richbell,</HI> that therefore their E&s;tates &s;hould be taken from them, and given to Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e?</HI> The Complainants think, it will
<PB N="53" REF="002940_0054_0FE69C38CD1A10A0">hardly make a good Title to <HI>Mr. Philip&s;e,</HI> nor had he any thing to do with this Matter in this Cau&s;e; but if they had Injured Mr. <HI>Richbell</HI> thereby, Mr. <HI>Richbell</HI> was the Only Per&s;on to whom Reparation was due for the Injury. How much the Complainants have Injured Mr. <HI>Richbell,</HI> more than the Defendants would have done, appears (in &s;ome mea&s;ure) by the Defendants dropping it out in this long Story. <HI>That they might have had Mr.</HI> Richbell<HI>'s whole Right for Four Hundred Pounds;</HI> whereas it appears, he has now got for it, by the Complainants means, hear double that Money.</P>
<P>But to con&s;ider this Matter a little clo&s;er; Should any Candid Man ad|venture to attack anothers Reputation, upon &s;o &s;light grounds as the Defen|dant <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> here &s;ets forth, (viz. <HI>That he has been Informed, and Thinks; by one of the Complainants, that ba&s;e Means were u&s;ed to cau&s;e this Power of Attorney to be &s;ent Home</HI>) without fir&s;t making all proper Enquiry about the Matter, which he had the means of doing, the Per&s;on impowered being upon the Spot, and might be enquired of, as to the Truth of this Matter, at any time &s;ince? Is that In&s;inuation fair, <HI>That thy Complainant</HI> Quinby <HI>could not di&s;own, but it co&s;t him Money, to get the Power &s;ent home? Mr. Philip&s;e</HI> does not &s;ay, that ever <HI>Quinby</HI> &s;aid any thing to that purpo&s;e; and if (as the truth is) <HI>Quinby</HI> never heard of any &s;uch thing, till he found it in this <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> it certainly was impo&s;&s;ible for him to di&s;own; what he never heard of, or was Taxed with. How could <HI>Mr. Philip&s;e</HI> &s;ay, from any thing he there &s;ets forth, and without enquiry of the Perion having the Power, That SURE IT IS, THE SAME WAS RETURNED? The very nature of the Thing hardly admits of any &s;uch Swearing about it; and if ten Thou&s;and People had told him &s;o, it was not &s;ufficient for him to Swear &s;o Po&s;itively about this Matter; Nay, if even the Per&s;on having the Power had &s;aid &s;o, it was not &s;ufficient for him to Swear &s;o.</P>
<P>The <HI>Impartial Reader;</HI> its conceived, cannot well e&s;cape being at a &s;tand what to think of this SWEARING, but the Complainants Think he will be &s;till more &s;o, when they do aver, and offer to prove the following Facts to be True
<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">50, 51.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> That Mr. <HI>Hask<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l</HI> brought that Power of Attorney over with him from <HI>England</HI> to this Place, in the year 1720. <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">52.</NOTE> That in a few days after his Arrival, he gave it to Mr. <HI>Alexander</HI> to tran&s;act, as a Per&s;on who was a Council at Law, and had &s;ome Knowledge in Land Affairs. <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">52, 53.</NOTE> That <HI>Mr. Alexander</HI> &s;oon after waited on <HI>Mr. Courtland</HI> with the Power, and &s;how'd him it, who declared, <HI>He rather inclined to have the Money due to him, than to Purcha&s;e;</HI> but however, &s;aid, <HI>he would afterwards Treat further of the Matter, either for to &s;ettle what was due to him, or to Purcha&s;e.</HI> That no further Treaty was ever between them on either of the&s;e Heads: Never any Enquiry whether the Power was &s;till remaining in his Hands. That the Power of Attorney was never &s;ent Home again; nor was any thing ever &s;aid by Mr. <HI>Alexander</HI> or Mr. <HI>Haskoll,</HI> to give any rea&s;on to any Body, to believe or &s;ugge&s;t, that it was; that they never heard of &s;uch a Sugge&s;tion till it was found to be Sworn in this An&s;wer; But <HI>That very Power of Attorney</HI> has ever &s;ince remained in <HI>Mr. Alexander</HI>'s Hands here.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE CLAMOURS,</HEAD>
<P>AS to the Clamours them&s;elves, the Complainants think it would be paying them too much Regard, to &s;et about to an&s;wer them one by one, in Print, being well a&s;&s;ured, the Propogators of them (if any Mode&s;ty they have remaining) mu&s;t Blu&s;h when any Man of Sen&s;e puts a few Que&s;|tions to them, &s;uch as, <HI>How do you know This? Is this &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons for you to believe, and Report this again?</HI> But in general, the Complainants &s;ay, That they think all of them, that concern the Merits of this Cau&s;e, will appear &s;ufficiently an&s;wered, by what appears in the Decree, and what's be|fore in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to it. As to the other Clamours about this Cau&s;e, which touch not the Merits of it, they know none of them worth Notice, that have any Truth to &s;upport them, except One, and that is about the <HI>Height of the Co&s;ts</HI> of this Cau&s;e: As to which, it is true, that the <HI>Bill of Co&s;ts</HI> offered for Taxation, amounted to <HI>Seven Hundred Pounds,</HI> which Bill was moderated to and Taxed at about <HI>Four Hundred and Fourteen Pounds,</HI> which its al&s;o acknowledged is a great deal of Money for the Co&s;ts of one Suit; but whether the Complainants had not more rea&s;on to clamour for this, than Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e,</HI> the Reader will be able to judge, when he con&s;iders what follows.</P>
<P>The Complainants do conceive, That as <HI>Mr. Philip&s;e</HI> did endeavour to weary them out by Numbers of Attendances, in-order for the Settling this Controver&s;ie in an Amicable manner, as in the <HI>4th Charge</HI> appears; &s;o likewi&s;e his Conduct in this Suit, gives them &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe, his Aim and View was to give Delay, and to &s;well the Proceedings, as much as in his Power, in order to rai&s;e the Charge of this Suit to &s;uch a Height, as that either the Complainants &s;hould not be able to carry it on, or to give ground for the Clamours now made about the Co&s;ts.</P>
<P>For, the Bill of Complaint, in this Cau&s;e, was filed on the 24th of <HI>Janu|ary,</HI> 1725, 6, and the Defendants had even much more Time than, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Court is allowed to make An&s;wer in; yet when Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> was a&s;hamed to ask more Time of the Court, he prevailed upon the Com|plainants and their Council, to give &s;undry Months longer Time, as by Letters, <HI>No.</HI> 1, 2 and 3, following, will appear. And yet, after all that, put the Complainants, at la&s;t, to the Nece&s;&s;ity of taking out the Compul&s;ory Proce&s;s of the Court; by which means the Complainants were delayed, for want of an An&s;wer, till the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> 1726. and then the Defendants gave in an An&s;wer con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>One Hundred and Ninty Nine Sheets,</HI> whereof the greate&s;t part could be of no other U&s;e than to Calumniate the Complainants, as by a Specimen of it in the <HI>Ob&s;ervations in General</HI> on the <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> before, in part, appears; in which An&s;wer there was al&s;o a Demurrer, which took
<PB N="56" REF="002940_0057_0FE69C3AB4BC1770">long Time to argue, and &s;end for Council for that purpo&s;e. And after the Decree was Pronounced, on the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> 1727. tho' the Defendants Council were often entreated Per&s;onally, and by Me&s;&s;engers, to &s;horten the An&s;wer, in order to take &s;o much of it only into the Decree as was of Mo|ment, yet they would neither do it, nor give a Po&s;itive Denyal, till the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> when they in&s;i&s;ted on having the whole An&s;wer <HI>Verbatim,</HI> in the Decree. Whereupon the Complainants Council, &s;u&s;pecting Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e</HI>'s View of rai&s;ing a Clamour, from the Height that this would nece&s;&s;arily bring the Co&s;ts to, he made that Frote&s;t in Letter <HI>No.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>As to Reducing the Bill of Co&s;ts from <HI>Seven Hundred</HI> to <HI>Four Hundred Pounds,</HI> its Notorious that the Complainants employed four Council in, this Cau&s;e, whereof Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ilton</HI> lives in the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ilvania,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kin&s;ey</HI> in the Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> and yet no Fees were ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed but for two Council, and nothing allowed for the&s;e Gentlemens coming here, who cannot be pre&s;umed to come from the&s;e Provinces for a &s;mall matter.</P>
<P>Which Matters being con&s;idered, the Complainants think, the <HI>Candid Reader</HI> will come into the &s;ame way of Thinking with them, concerning <HI>Mr. Philip&s;e</HI>'s Delays, and &s;welling of the Proceedings, <HI>to wit,</HI> That they were de&s;igned by him either to di&s;able the Complainants from Pro&s;ecuting this Suit, at &s;o great a Charge, or to furni&s;h him with a matter for Clamour, at the great|ne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">harge.</P>
<P>And it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;idered al&s;o, That the Sum Taxed does not amount to the one half of the actual Charges the Complainants have been put to, in the Pro&s;ecution of this Suit; and, how little ground <HI>Mr. Philip&s;e</HI> has for his Pre|tences, which have occa&s;ioned this Suit; and, how much Pains the Com|plainants have taken to Prevent this Suit, by Amicable means, as all through the <HI>3d</HI> and <HI>4th Charges</HI> does appear; No Rea&s;onable Man can but think, that the Hard&s;hip is upon the Complainants, and that they had the mo&s;t rea&s;on to Clamour.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, Let the <HI>Reader</HI> Judge, Try and Speak as he finds the Truth is.</P>

<P>I Wi&s;h you would have told me before, that you would have the whole An&s;wer of <HI>Courtland</HI> and <HI>Philip&s;e</HI> in the Decree of <HI>Palmers</HI> again&s;t them, which would have &s;aved us all this <HI>Time</HI> &s;ince Pronouncing of the <HI>Decree,</HI> which we have waited, for your pointing out the material parts you would have had in. The taking in the whole, will be a great Charge, and will fall heavily &s;ome where: I really believe the Charge of the <HI>Decree,</HI> and Copies that will be nece&s;&s;ary, will not come much &s;hort of <HI>three or four hundred Pounds,</HI> which will, perhaps, be made a handle of for Clamour, by your Clyents; and I &s;u&s;pect not a little, their de&s;ire of things at length, to be with that View, which, I hereby declare, is your own faults, &amp;, as much as in me lies, Prote&s;t again&s;t, and that you are the cau&s;e of &s;uch Va&s;t Charge.</P>
