<HEAD>TO THE CHURCH of ENGLAND PLANTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE ob&s;erved it to be the Track of many a little Scribbler, who &s;teps into a News-Paper, to u&s;her in his Production with a pompous Account of what <HI>he is.</HI> In your Hand-Bill of the 28th of la&s;t <HI>September,</HI> communicated to us with the <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> Chronicle, you have avoided this Fault, and informed us <HI>what you are not;</HI> you would be original in this as well as your other Plans &mdash;You &s;ay, <HI>You have not the Honour of a Seat in the Lower Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly.</HI> You might have &s;pared your&s;elf this Trouble, no one could have &s;u&s;pected it; there cannot be a Set of Freeholders upon Earth &s;o ignorant as to choo&s;e a Man for their Repre&s;entative, who is capable of <HI>di&s;clo&s;ing &s;uch weak Sentiments to the Publick,</HI> and in&s;ulting the repre&s;entative Body of a Province, by giving Advice unworthy the lowe&s;t Circle of a Tippling-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Your chief Complaint lies, <HI>That the Clergy ride you like A&s;&s;es;</HI> I will venture to &s;ay, that the Par&s;on who rides you has a very dull Bea&s;t under him. You may think per|haps that I am angry with you; far otherwi&s;e. I was never better plea&s;ed. I am plea&s;ed with you for writing again&s;t the Clergy, becau&s;e you have done it &s;o weakly, that you have advanced their Intere&s;ts rather than impaired them, have proved their Advocate rather than their Opponent, and by a feeble and impotent Attack have confirmed the E&s;tabli&s;hment you endeavoured to overthrow.</P>
<P>To give Advice even to a Friend is a delicate Matter; it implies a Kind of Supe|riority which Men unwillingly acknowledge. It is a good Maxim never to give Ad|vice until it is a&s;ked; had you &s;tayed until you had been a&s;ked, you would have been &s;ilent for ever.&mdash;But when an Individual pre&s;umes to in&s;truct the Repre&s;entatives of a Country, the greate&s;t Caution is nece&s;&s;ary not to give Offence: But this &s;eems below your Concern; you not only inform the A&s;&s;embly what their Duty is, but you plainly tell them they have neglected their Duty, and in&s;ult the Body from whom you expect Redre&s;s. You talk of Grievances and <HI>Burdens,</HI> but <HI>One in particular which</HI> THEY <HI>have had in their Power to have relieved you of ever &s;ince the fir&s;t Ri&s;e of it, and that is, in Regard of the Clergy, who now ride you like A&s;&s;es, and think it out of your Power to relieve your&s;elves.</HI> How far the A&s;&s;embly could effect your Relief of <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> the
<PB N="4" REF="011830_0003_0F8D4E5BC76635F8">
Nature of the Con&s;titution mu&s;t determine; but had the Burden been &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, I dare &s;ay they would have u&s;ed their be&s;t Endeavours to have prevented your being rode to Death.</P>
<P>You proceed to tell us, That at the Time of the fir&s;t &s;ettling of the Province,
<Q>there was an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity to encourage the Clergy to &s;ettle among&s;t us in a <HI>WILDERNESS COUNTRY;</HI> but why &s;o much larger Encouragement was given to them than our neighbouring Provinces gave you cannot conceive.</Q>&mdash;The Nece&s;&s;ity to encourage the Clergy to con|tinue among&s;t us is as ab&s;olute and evident as it was fir&s;t to &s;ettle them in this <HI>Wilderne&s;s Country.</HI>&mdash;As the E&s;tabli&s;hment of a national Religion, ought to be One of the fir&s;t and principal Acts of Civilization, &s;o it ought to be the la&s;t Act that cea&s;es, and only to expire with the Con&s;titution. Men are prone to &s;lide back into a Savage State when left without In&s;truction, and the Precepts of Religion are as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to our Children now, as they were formerly to our Fathers.</P>
<P>[Before I proceed further with our <HI>Planter</HI>'s Remarks, I &s;hall beg Leave to lay before the Publick, a brief Account of the Origin of that E&s;tabli&s;hment the Church at pre&s;ent enjoys, extracted from authentic Papers.</P>
<P>The Charter of the Province recites Two Rea&s;ons which induced the then Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> to a&s;k, and the Crown to grant it: The Fir&s;t was for the Propagation of the Chri&s;tian Religion in a Country partly occupied by Savages, who had no Knowledge of the divine Being; and the Second was for the extending of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions.</P>
<P>As to the Fir&s;t declared Intent of the Crown in the Charter, the Propagation of the Chri&s;tian Faith, it happened that for above Sixty Years after the Grant, no Attempt was made for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Prote&s;tant Church or Clergy in this Province, but, the Government of <HI>Maryland</HI> devolving at the Revolution into the Hands of his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>William,</HI> then it was that under Governors appointed by his Maje&s;ty, &s;ome Acts of A&s;&s;embly were propo&s;ed, and indeed pa&s;&s;ed here, for &s;ettling the religious Wor&s;hip of the Church of <HI>England</HI> among&s;t his Maje&s;ty's Prote&s;tant Subjects in this Colony.</P>
<P>But as the Province abounded with Papi&s;ts, Quakers, and other Di&s;&s;enters, who had then a great Influence in our A&s;&s;emblies, none of tho&s;e Acts which they prepared and pa&s;&s;ed among them&s;elves were made effectual, but they were all from Time to Time repealed in <HI>England,</HI> on Account of &s;everal Defects therein.</P>
<P>The Acts prepared and pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Maryland</HI> for e&s;tabli&s;hing Religion, ju&s;t now mentioned, were repealed and declared void by Order of his Maje&s;ty's Council of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>January</HI> 1695, and the 30th <HI>November</HI> 1699.</P>
<P>The next Act for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Religion which was prepared in <HI>Maryland,</HI> was pa&s;&s;ed the 26th of <HI>April</HI> 1700, and that being tran&s;mitted to the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for Trade and Plantations, their Lord&s;hips, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and al&s;o of the principal Officers of the Crown named in their Commi&s;&s;ion, took that Act into Con&s;ideration, and judged it liable to many material Objections, and accordingly repre&s;ented the &s;ame to his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>William</HI> in Council.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty had &s;o much at Heart the E&s;tabli&s;hment of religious Wor&s;hip here according to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Maintenance of Mini&s;ters, that there|upon,
<PB N="5" REF="011830_0004_0F8D4E61E4631428">
by Order in Council of the 13th of <HI>February,</HI> 1701, he declared his Di&s;like of that Act, and directed the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners for Trade and Plantations to prepare a new Draught of an Act for that Purpo&s;e, with &s;uch Alterations from the former Act as were proper to tho&s;e Ends, and agreeable to the Toleration allowed in <HI>England</HI> to Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>The Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade and Plantations having prepared a Draught of an Act accordingly, and laid it before his Maje&s;ty in Council, &s;ome of the People called Quakers, in Behalf of their Brethren in <HI>Maryland,</HI> petitioned his Maje&s;ty in Council again&s;t that Draught, on the 22d of <HI>May,</HI> 1701, as appears by Order of Council of that Date. His Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to hear them and their Coun&s;el again&s;t it, as well as to hear the Rea&s;ons offered for it; and after due Con&s;ideration of the whole, by Order of Council of the 5th of <HI>June,</HI> 1701, directed that Draught to be &s;ent to the Governor and Council in <HI>Maryland,</HI> to be by them propo&s;ed to the A&s;&s;embly here at their next Meeting, in order to be pa&s;&s;ed into a Law. That Draught was &s;ent, was propo&s;ed, and was pa&s;&s;ed into an Act here accordingly, upon the 25th of <HI>March,</HI> 1702, and was tran&s;mitted from hence, and again referred to the Examination of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade and Plantations, and by them re|ported for the royal Sanction and Approbation, on the 18th of <HI>January,</HI> 1702. And, by Order of Council of the &s;ame Day, reciting that the Governor, Council, and A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Maryland</HI> had Authority to ordain Laws, which were to con|tinue and be in Force until the royal Plea&s;ure &s;hould be &s;ignified to the contrary, that Act, &s;o &s;olemnly devi&s;ed, prepared and con&s;idered in <HI>England,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Maryland,</HI> was approved, confirmed, finally ratified and e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Innovation that I find to have been made in this E&s;tabli&s;hment was, by an Act pa&s;&s;ed in 1715, C. 24. now in Force, whereby Five <HI>per Cent.</HI> is to be deducted and paid by the Clergy to the Sheriff for his Collection, although the forementioned Act had enacted, that the Sheriff &s;hould collect the Forty <HI>per</HI> Poll in the &s;ame Manner he did the Publick and County Levies, which County Levies were paid for by the County, and given to the &s;everal Officers, without deducting any Thing for Collection.&mdash;To this the Clergy &s;ubmitted, being from their &s;mall Income then and low Circum&s;tances unable at a great Expence to &s;eek Relief at Home.</P>
<P>The next Attempt was of a more important Nature, and tended more effectually to reduce the Maintenance provided and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the royal Authority for the Clergy of this Province. An Act was pa&s;&s;ed in 1728, C. 2. entitled, <Q><HI>An Act for the amending the Staple of Tobacco,</HI>" which enacted, That, for the Ea&s;e of the People, and for the di&s;charging all parochial and other Charges payable in Tobacco, and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and levied on the People, all Per&s;ons may pay the whole or any Part thereof at Ten Shillings Currency <HI>per Cent.</HI> at or before the 10th of April Yearly, or 3-4th Parts thereof in Tobacco in Specie, in full Di&s;charge and Satisfaction of the whole, at the Choice of the Debtor; and that the Sheriffs &s;hall have until the la&s;t of <HI>June</HI> Yearly to return and make up the Accounts of the publick Allowances and other Tobacco Demands; and that all Per&s;ons paying Money in Di&s;charge of Tobacco or 3-4ths in Tobacco, &s;hall be as good as a Tender of the whole.</Q></P>
<P>Again&s;t this Act the Reverend Mr. <HI>Hender&s;on,</HI> with Six Clergymen, put in a Petition into the Upper Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, in Behalf of them&s;elves and ab&s;ent Brethren, which
<PB N="6" REF="011830_0005_0F8D4E62A7951650">
was un&s;ucce&s;sful. Upon the Act pa&s;&s;ing in <HI>Maryland</HI> on the 3d of <HI>October,</HI> 1728, Mr. <HI>Hender&s;on</HI> went over to <HI>England</HI> to petition the Crown again&s;t it; and on the 17th of <HI>December,</HI> 1729, being the Day appointed for the Hearing by the Committee of the Lords of his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t honourable Privy Council, to whom his Maje&s;ty had referred it to con&s;ider and report what was fit for his Maje&s;ty to do therein, on that Day the late Lord <HI>Baltimore</HI> &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Hender&s;on,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured him if he would withdraw his Petition from before the Council, he would di&s;&s;ent to the Act; and promi&s;ed <HI>upon his Honour</HI> that he would give po&s;itive In&s;tructions to his Governors never to pre&s;ume to pa&s;s an Act of that Nature for the future.&mdash;However the &s;e|veral In&s;pection Laws in 1747, 1753, and 1763, &s;tripped the Clergy in the &s;ame Manner of One Fourth of their original Stipends; and the Bill now depending, which has pa&s;&s;ed the Lower Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, and waits the Concurrence of the Council and Governor, gives an Option to the People to pay off the Clergy 30 <ABBR>lb</ABBR> of Tobacco <HI>per</HI> Poll, in&s;tead of 40 <ABBR>lb</ABBR> <HI>per</HI> Poll, if paid in Specie by the 10th Day of <HI>June</HI> Yearly, or 30 <ABBR>lb</ABBR> <HI>per</HI> Poll at the Rate of 12 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> Currency <HI>per</HI> Hundred in Money, if not paid in Tobacco by that Time, and &s;ubjects the Clergy to the very &s;ame Inconveniences the Act of 1728 would have laid them under, had it not been di&s;|&s;ented to at that Time. If Tobacco be a Drug, the Planter will pay off in Tobac|co; if it be worth more than 12 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> he will pay off in Money, becau&s;e he is al|lowed until the 10th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> for his Money Payment; and then he pays but for 30 <ABBR>lb</ABBR> in&s;tead of 40 <ABBR>lb</ABBR> of Tobacco allowed by the old Act, &s;o that the Planter not only gains One Fourth in the Quantity, but may, if Tobacco bears the Price it has done for Three Years pa&s;t, be a Gainer of 100 or 150 <HI>per Cent.</HI> in the Price, rating his Payment at 12 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6 <HI><ABBR>d.</ABBR> per</HI> Hundred.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of the 40 <ABBR>lb</ABBR> <HI>per</HI> Poll for the Clergy was de&s;igned in Lieu and in Nature of Tythes, and was formerly paid as &s;uch in Kind; by which the Clergy had the &s;ame Chance and Benefit as other Per&s;ons, either as to the Ri&s;e or Fall of the Commodity, as they have in their Tythes in Kind in <HI>England.</HI> Now by this Act all that Advantage is taken from them, let it ri&s;e or fall they mu&s;t &s;till be Sufferers, they will lo&s;e in any Ca&s;e, and have no Po&s;&s;ibility of gaining.</P>
<P>Hence it appears how far the&s;e &s;everal Acts have tended virtually and in Sub&s;tance to repeal the Act &s;o &s;olemnly enacted and ratified by the royal Authority, and how greatly the Maintenance thereby provided and e&s;tabli&s;hed for the Clergy has been re|duced and dimini&s;hed. And this Con&s;ideration may have Weight to make the A&s;|&s;embly cautious how they act with re&s;pect to the Clergy, who, upon this Principle, can never fail of Redre&s;s, when they are driven to the Nece&s;&s;ity of applying Home.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now return to our <HI>Church of England Planter,</HI> who, though he writes to the Vulgar, and writes like one of the Vulgar, may &s;erve to &s;how the Clergy what they are to expect, if they once lo&s;e Sight of their fundamental Law.</P>
<P>If indeed, Sir, your Allegations be true, <Q>That tho&s;e Gentlemen <HI>(the Cler|gy)</HI> have vaunted over Government, Ve&s;try, and Laity, bidding Defiance to the whole, as, <HI>you urge,</HI> it is notoriou&s;ly known they have done ever &s;ince the Year <HI>1702,</HI> until the Fir&s;t In&s;pecting Law on Tobacco pa&s;&s;ed which you date in <HI>1751:</HI></Q> If this be true, that the Clergy, in&s;tead of recommending Obedience to Govern|ment,
<PB N="7" REF="011830_0006_0F8D4E632971FC40">
have <HI>bid Defiance to the whole;</HI> in&s;tead of cultivating the Good-Will and Con|fidence of their Ve&s;try and Pari&s;hioners, have notoriou&s;ly in&s;ulted and abu&s;ed them, and have become <HI>Ramping Lions,</HI> as you elegantly expre&s;s it in another Place, in&s;tead of <HI>Meek Lambs,</HI> I wonder they had not been chained down in their Dens long &s;ince, and that the A&s;&s;embly, <Q><HI>in who&s;e Power</HI> (you &s;ay) it was to have corrected the&s;e Enormities, &s;hould have let them pa&s;s unnoticed from the Year 1702, <HI>until</HI> the Fir&s;t In&s;pecting Law on Tobacco;</Q> but as we hear no more of them &s;ince, and your Complaints of the&s;e Violences terminate <HI>then,</HI> it is hoped that Law worked a thorough Cure, and the Wi&s;dom of the Legi&s;lature could not be too much ad|mired, that under One Act reformed the Clergy and the Tobacco.</P>
<P>You wonder <Q>why the Clergy had a larger Encouragement here, than in our neighbouring Provinces;</Q> you may as well wonder why they had any Encourage at all, &s;ince in many of our neighbouring Provinces they have none; which are thereby deprived of the ine&s;timable Benefit of religious Union, and for Want of a national Church, are by the Equality of all Sectaries, torn and convul&s;ed by con|tinual Struggles between them for Superiority and Pre-eminence, whil&s;t their Mini&s;ters feel all the Mi&s;eries of a precarious Dependance often on involuntary Contributions, and are expo&s;ed to Contempt, the never failing Attendant on Poverty.</P>
<P>You re&s;t your whole Plan of Reform, upon a Pre&s;umption that the Act of 1701-2, <HI>for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Prote&s;tant Church, and the Maintenance of Mini&s;ters in this Province, is not in Force:</HI> Now, if it appear that this Act is in full Force, and has all the Marks of legal Authority a Law can have, the pretty Structure you have been erecting, falls (like the ba&s;ele&s;s Fabric of a Vi&s;ion) to the Ground in an In&s;tant.</P>
<P>It appears then that after pa&s;&s;ing the General A&s;&s;embly, it was a&s;&s;ented to by a Gover|nor acting under a Royal Commi&s;&s;ion, that was ratified by Queen <HI>Anne</HI> in Council, <HI>Jan.</HI> 18, 1702, that it was excepted, with only one Act more, out of the general Repeal in 1704, that it was made the Ba&s;is of many &s;ub&s;equent Acts, and that it has been acknow|ledged by the Legi&s;lature here, and admitted by the People for nearly 70 Years. You urge, <Q>that this Act of A&s;&s;embly was <HI>INTENDED</HI> to be made in our Sovereign King <HI>William</HI>'s Time, but the King was dead at that Time, altho' not known here, as he died on the <HI>8th</HI> Day of <HI>March 1701-2,</HI> and the Se&s;&s;ion began on the <HI>16th</HI> of the &s;ame Month, &s;o that he could not give his A&s;&s;ent to it, by which Means it became void.</Q> That a dead King could not give his A&s;&s;ent to an Act, is a Di&s;covery for which you &s;hall have Credit; but tho' he could not, his Governor acting under <HI>his Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> could; and the dead King could no more <HI>di&s;&s;ent</HI> than <HI>a&s;&s;ent.</HI> In Judgment of Law, the King in his political Capacity <HI>dieth not&punc;</HI> he is not dead in Law at lea&s;t, until publick Proclamation of his Succe&s;&s;or in tho&s;e Dominions wher in his Deputies re&s;ide.&mdash;All his Gover|nors mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily continue in Commi&s;&s;ion until formaly &s;uper&s;eded by his Suc|ce&s;&s;or, and if the A&s;&s;ent of his Governor to a Law in his Maje&s;ty's Name, before the Knowledge of his De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;e, be not valid in Law, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> foreign Dominions mu&s;t ever be expo&s;ed to Anarchy and Confu&s;ion: No governmental Act would be legal, and the Judge who condemns a Criminal may be arraigned for Murder. And this continuing Power upon the Demi&s;e of a King is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to good Government;
<PB N="8" REF="011830_0007_0F8D4E63D1F5D2F8">
that it is extended by Act of A&s;&s;embly to the Officers of the Lord Proprietary.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1751 Chap. 27.</NOTE>&mdash; You &s;ay, he (the King) <HI>could not give his A&s;&s;ent to it, by which the Act became void;</HI> I never heard that the A&s;&s;ent of the King or the Lord Proprietary him&s;elf, not per&s;onally pre&s;ent, was nece&s;&s;ary to the Validity of a Law here; the Power of Di&s;&s;ent indeed lies at home, but the A&s;&s;ent of the Governor, as the King's or Proprietor's Repre&s;entative, and one Branch of the Legi&s;lature, gives an Act full and competent Authority, until the Di&s;&s;ent arrives. By an Act, 1638, C. 1, for e&s;tabli&s;hing the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, <HI>all Acts a&s;&s;ented to and approved by the &s;aid Hou&s;e, or major Part thereof, and afterwards a&s;&s;ented to by the Lieutenant-Governor, in the Name of the Lord Proprietary, are adjudged and e&s;tabli&s;hed for Laws</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o 1650, C. 2.</NOTE>. And by the Order of Council before recited, of the 18th of <HI>January</HI> 1702, it was declared, <Q>that the Governor, Council, and A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Maryland,</HI> had Authority to ordain Laws, which were to continue and be in Force, until the Royal Plea&s;ure &s;hould be &s;ignified to the contrary.</Q>&mdash;If there be any Doubts concerning the Legality of the original Law of 1701-2, the Exception out of the general Repeal in 1704 would &s;erve to remove them; if the Authority of the Law and of the Exception could be objected to, the &s;everal Acts dependant upon it, by which it is interwove into, and become Part of, the Con&s;titution, would in Return prop, &s;upport and confirm it.&mdash;I will take them in order, and quote the References acknowledging the Validity of the Act of 1701-2.</P>
<P>By an Act pa&s;&s;ed in 1704, C. 34, &sect; 5, the Ve&s;trymen are directed, where there is no Mini&s;ter re&s;ident in the Pari&s;h, to keep a fair Account of the 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll, levied in their Pari&s;h, according to an Act, entitled, <HI>An Act for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of religious Wor&s;hip,</HI> &amp;c. and al&s;o of the 10 <HI>per</HI> Poll <HI>to be rai&s;ed and levied in Virtue of that Act,</HI> and tran&s;mit it to the Governor and Council.&mdash;By an Act in 1715, C. 24, the Defects of the Act of 1701-2 are remedied, and the 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll during a Vacancy, not before provided for, was therein directed to be laid out by the Ve&s;try, in repairing or building Churches, or in purcha&s;ing or &s;tocking a Glebe: By the la&s;t Section of this Act, the Sheriff, who had no Allowance for his Trouble under the original Act, was allowed to deduct 5 <HI>per Cent</HI> for collecting the 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll, and paying the &s;ame either to the Incumbent or Ve&s;try.</P>
<P>An Act in 1715, C. 30, repeals a Clau&s;e in an Act of A&s;&s;embly, entitled, <HI>An Act for e&s;tabli&s;hing religious Wor&s;hip in this Province,</HI> &amp;c. requiring that all Ve&s;trymen &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe the A&s;&s;ociation, and directs that they &s;hall take the Oaths of Ad|juration. An Act in 1716, C. 5, directs, that nothing therein contained, &s;hall extend, or be con&s;trued to extend, to alter any Directions given by the Act for the <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hment of religious Wor&s;hip within this Province,</HI> as to the Manner of admini&s;tering the Oaths required.

I wi&s;h as much as he, that the Clergy may be precluded the Occa&s;ion of their returning to their old Claim of 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll, but by endeavouring to invali|date the Act it&s;elf, he not only intere&s;ts the Bi&s;hops' Influence with the Proprietor in their Favour, (of which, he &s;ays, he is apprehen&s;ive) but perhaps the Crown it&s;elf, which cannot tamely &s;ee an Act pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;o &s;olemnly confirmed by the Royal Authority, &s;o wantonly trampled under Foot, or permit the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o long and &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed in this Province, to be &s;tript of its whole Support by a pitiful Cavil; but I dare &s;ay that the Wi&s;dom and Policy of the Le|gi&s;lature here, will make &s;uch an Application needle&s;s, and that they will equally de&s;pi&s;e his Plans and Apprehen&s;ions: The Clergy, if they are wi&s;e, will be very cautious how they apply Home for Redre&s;s, and the A&s;&s;embly will be too ju&s;t, as well as too politic, to drive them to that Extremity.</P>
<P>The Clergy are intitled under the Act of 1701-2, to the full Compliment of 40 <ABBR>lb</ABBR> of Tobacco <HI>per</HI> Poll; the Sheriff is therein obliged to collect it in the &s;ame Manner, and by the &s;ame Authority as the Publick and County Levies<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Which are under Execution. <HI>Vide</HI> LL, N^o. 2. fol. 245 &amp; 1724, C. 21.

On making the Fir&s;t In&s;pection-Law in 1747, (not as you &s;ay in 1751, for you are as bad at Chronology as Legi&s;lation) it was thought proper as the Value of the Staple would increa&s;e by the Regulation, that there &s;hould be a Fifth deducted in all Tobacco Payments; the Clergy were included under this Act; One Fifth deducted would reduce the 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll to 32 <ABBR>lb</ABBR>; 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> was al&s;o allowed for Con|veniency

<P>The Tobacco and Money Payments, we may pre&s;ume, were at that Time (<HI>Anno</HI> 1753) ju&s;tly proportioned, and 12<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 looked on nearly as an average Price for One Hundred Pounds of publick Tobacco: The Benefit of the In&s;pection-Law to the Province is hence notorious, that 12<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 is become &s;carcely Two Thirds, and of late not One Half of the Worth of that Quantity of Tobacco: but if the Tobacco be increa&s;ed in Value, the Planter has no Rea&s;on to complain <HI>in Fact,</HI> becau&s;e he only pays his old Proportion of 30 <HI>per</HI> Poll; it would be uncharitable to &s;uppo&s;e, that he grudges the Mini&s;ter tho&s;e Returns he receives him&s;elf in &s;o much greater Propor|tion. His Complaint lies only on the Compari&s;on. The Farmer, who&s;e Lands, now cleared and fitted for Cultivation, produce va&s;t Crops of Grain, for which he finds an immediate and liberal Market, compounds at the Rate of 12<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6; and here the Compari&s;on &s;trikes. There can be no good Rea&s;on given, why in publick Taxa|tions, one Man &s;hould pay double or treble the Proportion of another, for the &s;ame Services; and if there appears a Nece&s;&s;ity for ea&s;ing the Planter, there may be Room to lay a little Addition on the Farmer, the Merchant, and the Gentleman, &s;o that the Lo&s;s may not be &s;o &s;everely felt by the publick Officer, the Lawyer, or the Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>I calculate that One Half of the Pari&s;hes of <HI>Maryland</HI> do not con&s;i&s;t of above 1200 Taxables; &s;everal of them fall &s;hort of that Number. You think <Q><HI>10 per</HI> Poll would be &s;ufficient to maintain a much greater Number of the Clergy than we have now, in a very genteel Way.</Q> I &s;uppo&s;e you would choo&s;e to a&s;&s;e&s;s the 10 <HI>per</HI> Poll at 12<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 <HI>per</HI> Hun|dred; the Salary then on 1200 Taxables would amount to &pound; 75.

<P>The Clergy of <HI>Virginia,</HI> who were before allured into this Province, and filled the Pari&s;hes here, when tho&s;e in <HI>Virginia</HI> were left de&s;titute, will now be no longer de&s;irous of changing their Situation, &s;ince, at the Rate of 12<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 <HI>per</HI> Hundred, One Half of the Pari&s;hes of <HI>Maryland</HI> will fall &s;hort of the <HI>Virginia</HI> Stipend, con&s;idered together with the Conveniency of their Glebes. As for new <HI>Virginia,</HI> which is yet in Embryo, there cannot be &s;o proper a Per&s;on to draw up a Code of Laws for its internal Police, if <HI>Maryland</HI> can &s;pare him, as the <HI>Church of England Planter;</HI> and as there is not yet any Form of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline in the <HI>Provinces</HI> of <HI>Virginia,</HI> whatever he may think to the contrary, there may be a further Latitude for his Le|gi&s;lative Abilities, &s;ince his Plan for <HI>Maryland</HI> would do Honour to a <HI>Solon</HI> or a <HI>Lycurgus.</HI> We mu&s;t have it in his own Words, for his Style is as compleat as his Projects.</P>
<P><HI>"I would further recommend that there &s;hould be a Clau&s;e in that Act to impower the Ve&s;try of each Pari&s;h to call before them, by Way of Summons, the Clergyman of their Pari&s;h, for Neg|lect of Duty, or any Mi&s;conduct, when of their own Knowledge, or on the Complaint of any Two or Three reputable Pari&s;hioners, that they &s;hall fix a Day and &s;end their Summons to their Clergyman, and that they &s;hall al&s;o &s;et up an Adverti&s;ement at the Church Door at lea&s;t Ten Days before the Time of meeting, &s;ignifying that their Clergyman is to appear on &s;uch a Day before the Ve&s;try&mdash;and if any of his Pari&s;hioners have any Complaint to make again&s;t him, they may attend on that Day, and then if they of</HI> THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE, <HI>or upon the Oath of Two or more creditable Witne&s;&s;es, have Rea&s;on to condemn him for Neglect of Duty or Mi&s;conduct, that they &s;hall reprimand him for the fir&s;t and &s;econd Time, and for the third di&s;|charge him."</HI>&mdash;A very &s;ummary Way of Proceeding, indeed!

<P>The Revenues of the Clergy, wherever they have become any ways con&s;iderable, have always been the Subject of popular Conver&s;ation, and often been made a Topic fit for the Purpo&s;e of factious and de&s;igning Men to rai&s;e publick Di&s;content. But violent Changes have &s;eldom proved for the better, and Innovations in religious Matters have ever been of dangerous Con&s;equence to a State&mdash;as we read in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, Four different Changes in Religion took Place during the Cour&s;e of a few Years, by the Authority of the Sovereign alone.&mdash;If the Act of 1701-2 be not in Force, we have no e&s;tabli&s;hed Church of <HI>England</HI>&mdash;for no Church is deemed a &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, unle&s;s a certain Income or Revenue is provided for its Mini&s;ters.

<P>If the Act of 1701-2 were a real Grievance to the People; if the Tax of 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll were too heavy for their Circum&s;tances to bear; if they were really oppre&s;&s;ed and rode by the Clergy, there is not a Man in the Province that would be more ready with Heart and Hand to give a Lift to overturn the Act than my&s;elf: But this is far from being the Ca&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>The 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll is reckoned not a 20th Part of the Increa&s;e of that One Commo|dity, and if the In&s;pection-Law had been continued, which would have been much to the Clergy's Content, the 30 <HI>per</HI> Poll&punc; therein a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was One Fourth le&s;s, and the Compo&s;ition at 12<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR>6 <ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> may be computed, for the Rea&s;ons before a&s;&s;igned, &s;carcely One Hundredth Part of the Farmer's Increa&s;e.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> the Farmer pays One Tenth Part of the Produce of his Lands, which, his Labour inclu&s;ive, is nearly One Fifth of the Returns, either to the Church or the Im|propriator who claims under the &s;ame Title: yet he has no Rea&s;on to complain. If he received the Land by De&s;cent from his Ance&s;tors, it was with this Re&s;ervation; if he purcha&s;es it with his Money, or rents it of another, a proportionable Deduc|tion is made. What is not a Man's by Inheritance, or Purcha&s;e, or Contract, can|not properly be his own. The Tithes in <HI>England</HI> and the 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll in <HI>Maryland</HI> &s;tand upon the &s;ame Principle, to wit, the Law of the Land; and Law is the Foun|tain of Property: Remove the Land-mark and the Field lies in common&mdash;and I &s;peak of Property as inviolable, at lea&s;t until the Time comes, when <HI>inter Arma &s;ilent Leges.</HI> If then the Freeholder in <HI>England</HI> has no ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Complaint, how much le&s;s has the Inhabitant of <HI>Maryland,</HI> who contributes &s;o much le&s;s to the Maintenance and Support of an e&s;tabli&s;hed Clergy, which certainly tends to the Peace and civilizing of any Country, and conduces as well to the temporal as to the eternal Welfare of a People.</P>
<P>The Right of Patronage is one of the riche&s;t Plumes in the Proprietor's Cap&mdash;but as this falls to the Ground entirely with the Act of 1701-2 (for what is a Right of Patronage worth without an Endowment?) &s;o the &s;plitting of Pari&s;hes into &s;mall Por|tions
<PB N="15" REF="011830_0014_0F8D4E6E8BEE36E8">
is a great Diminution of the Value of that Right; it deprives him of the Power of rewarding Merit, and cuts off, in great Mea&s;ure, the generous Emulation of ex|celling among the Clergy; the Hopes of Rewards being the human Means for en|couraging Virtue, and recommending Learning among&s;t Mankind. This minute Divi&s;ion is not only incompatible with the infant State of any Country, where the Inhabitants lie thinly &s;cattered over a va&s;t Tract of Land, unle&s;s <HI>an additional Burden be laid on each Individual to maintain &s;o numerous a Clergy,</HI> but is highly impolitic in the back Parts of this Province, where Three Fourths of the Inhabitants are Foreigners, invincibly attached to their own Religion, Language and Manners, among&s;t whom no Clergyman of the Church of <HI>England</HI> can hope for any more Re&s;pect than his Hu|manity entitles him to or his Income commands.</P>
<P>The Clergy are at pre&s;ent divided in their political Character&mdash;tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good Livings and &s;ecured by the Laws of the Province, un&s;olicitous of further Pro|motion, have a natural De&s;ire to promote the Happine&s;s and &s;ecure the Liberties of the People by whom they are maintained, and thus become Friends of the Publick. The expectant Clergy, who are in waiting for Preferment, which flows from Go|vernment, will naturally fall in with, at lea&s;t not openly oppo&s;e, the Views and De|&s;igns of tho&s;e Per&s;ons from whom they are to receive Promotion.&mdash;Power always follows Property&mdash;a Balance of Power can only be pre&s;erved by a Balance of Pro|perty&mdash;but this Balance had like to have been de&s;troyed by a Bill in the Year 1768, e&s;tabli&s;hing a Commi&s;&s;ion Court for Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Matters&mdash;which would have united and blended together the Property and Influence of the whole Body of the Clergy with that of the Government; for he that can puni&s;h, will command and mu&s;t be obeyed too. It will always be an Object worthy the Policy and Wi&s;dom of the Lower Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, to keep the Puni&s;hment of the Clergy out of the Hands of the Government, le&s;t by inculcating into the Minds of their Hearers that pa&s;&s;ive Obe|dience to which they are &s;ubjected, the Contagion &s;pread to the Laity too; and the Government, if they are wi&s;e, will keep the Puni&s;hment as well as Promotion of the Clergy out of the Hands of the People, le&s;t they prove, as they do in <HI>Virginia,</HI> a dead Weight again&s;t Government; and thus balanced will they become an excellent Barrier, either when the Government would break through that &s;acred Compact which makes the Intere&s;ts of the governing and the governed reciprocal, or the Peo|ple would throw off all Obedience to Government, by which they are protected in their Per&s;ons and Properties.</P>
<P>I &s;hould never have thought the <HI>Church of England Planter</HI> worth an&s;wering, had I not found that the Idea of the Invalidity of the Law of 1701-2 had been mentioned in a re&s;pectable Meeting, and had become popular under the Sanction (by what Au|thority I know not) of one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Men in the Province. There cannot therefore be the lea&s;t Doubt but that the Church is in Danger.&mdash;To neglect to provide for Self-defence at any Time is to &s;leep in a Siege&mdash;but to neglect it now is to &s;leep on an Attack.&mdash;The Con&s;cience as well as the Intere&s;t of the Clergy is concerned in this Debate; the Pre&s;ervation of the pure&s;t Church on Earth is intru&s;ted to their Care, and they never will be able to an&s;wer it either here or hereafter, if they neglect &s;o &s;acred a Depo&s;it.&mdash;That the Notion of the Invalidity of the Act of 1701-2 is a mere Fiction, calculated to rai&s;e an Alarm, there is not the lea&s;t Doubt:
<PB N="16" REF="011830_0015_0F8D4E6F44170710">
But the Clergy, if they are not dead to every Sen&s;e of their Duty as well as their In|tere&s;t, will, upon the fir&s;t Attack upon any Individual, join their Pur&s;e, Heart and Hand, to defend his and their own Rights again&s;t all Oppo&s;ition. The Church of <HI>England</HI> has at pre&s;ent the Right, and will be &s;upported, doubtle&s;s, by the Power both of the Proprietor and the King, if &s;uch Interpo&s;ition be nece&s;&s;ary. The Church tolerates all other Per&s;ua&s;ions, but &s;hould the Sectaries obtain the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Loaves and Fi&s;hes, it would hardly meet even with Toleration it&s;elf.

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Partition of Pari&s;hes is at pre&s;ent a favourite Object of the Lower Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, it may not be ami&s;s to inquire how far &s;uch a Practice is agree|able to publick Faith, to Law and o Precedent.</P>
<P>The Charter gives <HI>Lord Baltimore "the Patronage and Advow&s;on of all Churches, which (with the increa&s;ing Wor&s;hip and Religion of</HI> CHRIST) <HI>hereafter &s;hall happen to be built within the Province.</HI>"&mdash;The Act of 1701-2 <HI>appropriates "the</HI> 40 per <HI>Poll that is to be levied upon every taxable Per&s;on within each re&s;pective Pari&s;h within this Province, as they have been, now are, or hereafter &s;hall be, laid out, limited or appointed by Laws of this Province, to the Mini&s;ter of each re&s;pective Pari&s;h, pre&s;ented, inducted, or appointed by his Excellency the Governor, or Commander in Chief for the Time being."</HI></P>
<P>The different Modes or Variations of Payment &s;ince, refer to the &s;ame original. The Que&s;tion is, whether his Lord&s;hip, or his Lieutenant Governor, having once pre&s;ented or inducted a Par&s;on into a Pari&s;h, can revoke or annul that Induction by his own Act, or with the Concurrence of any other Power within this Province.&mdash; If he can, he has more Power than the King has in <HI>England;</HI> for after Induction, a Church is full again&s;t the King; and the Rector of a Pari&s;h here is no longer a Te|nant for Life, but Tenant at Will. If he can take away Part, by little and little he may take away the whole, and give the &s;ame Thing Ten Times over.</P>
<P>It has been &s;een in the foregoing Sheets, how &s;olemnly the Act of 1701-2 was enacted, ratified and confirmed, by which 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll was &s;ettled on the e&s;tabli&s;hed Clergy, as an Encouragement for them to <HI>come</HI> and <HI>re&s;ide</HI> in this Province. In con|&s;equence of which, many Clergymen of the Church of <HI>England</HI> have come over from Time to Time, and made &s;ome little Settlement for them&s;elves and Families. The 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll may be con&s;idered in lieu of Tithes; both were given for the &s;ame Intent; both belong to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons; and both have the Law of the Land for their Support.&mdash;<Q>A Par&s;on has, during his Life, the Freehold in him&s;elf of the Par&s;onage Hou&s;e, the Glebe, the Tithes, and other Dues.</Q> It were needle&s;s to quote Authorities for this Po&s;ition, it never has been contravened. This is a Right common to, and in|herent in every Mini&s;ter of the Church, in every Country where it is e&s;tabli&s;hed by Law.&mdash;The publick Faith is pledged to a Mini&s;ter of a Pari&s;h in this Province by Three &s;olemn Acts; Fir&s;t, by an Act of A&s;&s;embly, conferring an Endowment here upon the Church of <HI>England;</HI> Secondly, by another Act, fixing and a&s;certaining the Bounds and Limits of each particular Pari&s;h; and Thirdly, by an Act of the Pro|prietor's, by Virtue of his Charter-Powers, con&s;tituting and appointing the Rector of a Pari&s;h, <HI>to have, hold and enjoy his Church, with all the Profits and Advantages what&s;oever, appertaining to a Mini&s;ter of that Pari&s;h, and requiring the Churchwardens, Ve&s;trymen and Pari&s;hioners of the Pari&s;h, to receive, acknowledge and a&s;&s;i&s;t him, in all Matters relating to the Di&s;charge of his Function.</HI></P>
<P>This Act is ab&s;olute, unconditional, final and irrevocable; all which Properties are nece&s;&s;ary to make it legal. If it were conditional it would be Simoniacal, and if
<PB N="18" REF="011830_0017_0F8D4E72770DA4A8">
revocable it would be void in Law. Even Bonds of Re&s;ignation, which the Cor|ruption of the Times has introduced into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, are held by &s;ome emi|nent Men to be null in Law, becau&s;e they put a Power of Deprivation in the Patron's Hands, which belongs only to a Court of Judicature. A Divi&s;ion is a partial De|privation, a Deprivation a Puni&s;hment, a Puni&s;hment implies a Crime, and a Crime requires Proof, Proce&s;s and Judgment&mdash;but here, by a &s;imple Vote, a Clergyman incurs the highe&s;t Puni&s;hment he can merit in his official Character, without a Tri|al, and may be deprived of half his Salary, of half his Glebe, of half his Hou&s;e, of half his Dues (they &s;hould in Pity take half his Children too) without a Crime.</P>
<P>The Charter of this Province requires, "<HI>That the Laws of this Province be con&s;onant to Rea&s;on, and be not repugnant and contrary, but, &s;o far as may be, agreeable to the Laws, Cu&s;toms and Rights of the Kingdom of</HI> England." I cannot repeat too often, and I do it with Confidence, <HI>"that a Par&s;on has during his Life the Freehold in him&s;elf of the Par|&s;onage Hou&s;e, the Glebe, the Salary, whether accruing from Tithes or Modus, or</HI> 40 <ABBR>lb</ABBR> per <HI>Poll of Tobacco, and other Dues, if not removed by voluntary Ce&s;&s;ion, or legal Deprivation by due Cour&s;e of Law."</HI></P>
<P>And becau&s;e the Idea of the Clergy's Property &s;eems to be lightly con&s;idered in the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute, I would a&s;k, What Rea&s;on can be given, why they &s;hould be pre|clud'd the common Privileges of Mankind?</P>
<P><Q>The third ab&s;olute Right, inherent in every <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> is that of Pro|perty; which con&s;i&s;ts in the free U&s;e and Enjoyment, and Di&s;po&s;al of all his Acqui&s;itions, without any Control or Diminution, &s;ave only by the Laws of the Land. The original of private Property is probably founded in Nature; but the Modifications under which we at pre&s;ent find it, the Method of con&s;erving it to the pre&s;ent Owner, and of tran&s;lating it from Man to Man, are entirely de|rived from Society; and are &s;ome of tho&s;e civil Advantages, in Exchange of which every Individual has re&s;igned a Part of his natural Liberty.&mdash;The Laws of <HI>England</HI> are therefore, <HI>in Point of Honour and Ju&s;tice,</HI> extremely watchful in a&s;cer|taining and protecting this Right. Upon this Principle the Great Charter has declared, that no Freeman &s;hall be di&s;&s;eized or dive&s;ted of his Freehold, or of his Liberties, or free Cu&s;toms, but by the Judgment of his Peers or by the Law of the Land. And by a Variety of antient Statutes it is enacted, that no Man's Lands or Goods &s;hall be &s;eized into the King's Hands, again&s;t the Great Charter and the Law of the Land, and that no Man &s;hall be di&s;inherited nor put out of his Franchi&s;es or Freehold, unle&s;s he be duly brought to an&s;wer, and be forejudged by Cour&s;e of Law <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Page 13.</NOTE>: <HI>If any thing be done to the contrary, it &s;hall be redre&s;&s;ed, and holden for none.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>So great, moreover, is the Regard of the Law for private Property, that it will not authori&s;e the lea&s;t Violation of it; no, not even for the general Good of the Community. If a new Road, for in&s;tance, were to be made through the Grounds of a private Per&s;on, it might, perhaps, be exten&s;ively beneficial to the Publick; but the Law permits no Man or Set of Men to do this without Con&s;ent of the Owner of the Land. In vain may it be urged that the Good of the Individual ought to yield to that of the Community; for it would be dangerous to allow any private Man, or even publick Tribunal, to be the Judge of this common Good,
<PB N="19" REF="011830_0018_0F8D4E72D0CAB0D8">
and to decide whether it be expedient or no. Be&s;ides, the publick Good is in no|thing more e&s;&s;entially intere&s;ted than in the Protection of every Individual's pri|vate Rights, as modelled by the municipal Laws. In this and the like Ca&s;es, the Legi&s;lature a one can, and indeed frequently does, interpo&s;e and compel the Indi|vidual to a quie&s;ce. But how does it interpo&s;e and compel? Not by ab&s;olutely &s;tripping the Subject of his Property in an arbitrary Manner; but by giving him a full Indemnification and Equivalent for the injury thereby &s;u&s;tained. The Pub|lick is now con&s;idered as an Individual, treating with an Individual for an Ex|change: All that the Legi&s;lature does is to oblige the Owner to alienate his Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions for a rea&s;onable Price; and even this is an Exertion of Power which the Legi&s;lature indulges with Caution, and which nothing but the Legi&s;lature can perform.</Q></P>
<P>Such is the Practice of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e of Commons; &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o temperate, &s;o worthy of Imitation! So tender are they of private Property, that the mo&s;t imme|diate publick Utility will not permit them to infringe it. A Canal is to be cut for the Benefit of Trade; it intercepts and ruins the Navigation of a River, made before at great Expence; many private Per&s;ons had embarked their Property in clearing the River, and a Bill was rejected in the Hou&s;e of Commons for cutting a Canal, until the Petitioner had &s;atisfied all the Adventurers in the Navigation of the River. A publick Good is propo&s;ed; private Advantage ought to &s;ubmit: True; publick Good implies more Good than Harm; but it would be more Harm than Good to the Publick to de&s;troy the Idea of Property, and forcibly to take away a Man's Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions without due Satisfaction, either to make a Road or cut a Canal; the Precedent would lead to Anarchy, Confu&s;ion and Ruin&mdash;Nor is the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Legi&s;lature le&s;s tender of the Property of the Church: The Great Charter begins with granting all its Rights and Liberties to the Church; the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Legi&s;lature protects the Pro|perty of the Church inviolable. A Bill was agitated &s;ome Time ago, to defalcate Part of the rich Dignities, and to apply it to the Augmentation of &s;mall Benefices. It was rejected upon this Principle, that the Revenues were private Property, which ought to be held &s;acred and inviolate; and if they admitted a Precedent of that Nature, there would be no End to Applications, until the Crown was &s;tripped of every Piece of Preferment worth be&s;towing.&mdash;To render a Divi&s;ion of a Pari&s;h practicable in <HI>England,</HI> the Con&s;ent of the Ordinary, Patron and Incumbent, is ne|ce&s;&s;ary. The Ordinary is a Party, as &s;uperintending the Affairs of the whole Church; the Patron is a Party, having the Advow&s;on thereof, which is a temporal Right; and the Incumbent is a Party, as per&s;onating that particular Church, and having it not only for his own U&s;e, but in Tru&s;t for that of his Succe&s;&s;ors. There is not One In&s;tance in all the Parliamentary Proceedings of a forcible Divi&s;ion of a Pari&s;h, to take Place during a Plenarty, without the Con&s;ent of the Incumbent.&mdash; Deprivation indeed is the Con&s;equence of an Attainder by Act of Parliament; but a Deprivation without a Crime is an Idea too arbitrary ever to be brought into Con|templation. A Man is &s;et apart for the Mini&s;try; his Youth is &s;pent in Study; he is cut off by Law from the Exerci&s;e of any Trade or handicraft Bu&s;ine&s;s, even from turning Agriculture into a Profit: He obtains a Living; where he &s;its down, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the Duty of his Function, or, if his Charge be too exten&s;ive, or In|firmities
<PB N="20" REF="011830_0019_0F8D4E738F110670">
incapacitate, he di&s;charges his Office by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of another; he &s;its &s;ecure under his Vine or Fig-tree, depending on his own Innocence and the Law of the Land. The Law directs what he is to do, and what to avoid; and, whil&s;t he executes the Condition to the be&s;t of his Power, and avoids the Crimes, by which he may incur a Forfeiture, no Power on Earth can in Ju&s;tice deprive him.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the&s;e Principles has been the Practice of the Legi&s;lature of this Pro|vince hitherto, in re&s;pect to the Divi&s;ion of Pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>When the Pari&s;h of <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> was erected out of <HI>St. Stephen,</HI> in the Year 1744, C. 3, the Act recites, that the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hugh Jones &s;hall continue Incumbent of both Pa|ri&s;hes during his Life.</HI>&mdash;When <HI>All Hallows</HI> Pari&s;h in <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> County was divided, and <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> Pari&s;h erected thereout, 1744, C. 24. the Divi&s;ion was directed <HI>to take Place after the Death of the Rev.</HI> Mr. Gla&s;gow, the then Incumbent&mdash;When <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s Pari&s;h in <HI>Baltimore</HI> County was divided, and Part thereof, lying in <HI>Anne-Arundel</HI> County, was united to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Pari&s;h, 1742, C. 15. the Partition was directed to take Place after the Death of the Rev. <HI>Benedict Bourdillon.</HI>&mdash;When <HI>St. Mary Whitechapel</HI> Pari&s;h was erected out of <HI>Great Choptank</HI> Pari&s;h, 1725, C. 10. the Act recites, that the Rev. <HI>Thomas Nowel</HI> had Notice thereof, and <HI>a&s;&s;ented thereto.</HI>&mdash;By an Act appointing Commi&s;&s;ioners for dividing <HI>St. Mary</HI>'s County into Four Pari&s;hes, and to erect <HI>Trinity</HI> Pari&s;h in <HI>Charles</HI> County out of Part of <HI>All Faith,</HI> and <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> Pari&s;hes, 1744, C. 14. it is provided by the 7th Section, that all the Part of <HI>All Faith</HI> and <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen</HI> Pari&s;hes, now lying within <HI>Charles</HI> County, &s;hall hereafter be deemed and remain a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate Pari&s;h, by the Name of <HI>Trinity</HI> Pari&s;h, but &s;o as not to affect the 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll, until after the Decea&s;e or Removal of the pre&s;ent Incumbent or Incumbents of the &s;aid Pari&s;hes of <HI>All Faith</HI> and <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Queen.</HI>&mdash;By the 9th Section it is provided, that &s;uch Divi&s;ions or Alterations of the Pari&s;hes afore&s;aid, or the erecting the afore&s;aid <HI>Trinity</HI> Pari&s;h in <HI>Charles</HI> County, &s;hall not take Place or Effect, until the Death or Removal of the pre&s;ent Incum|bents re&s;pectively, &s;o as to alter the Income of any of the &s;aid pre&s;ent Incumbents in the Pari&s;hes they now enjoy.</P>
<P>It were needle&s;s to multiply Examples. The Legi&s;lature has been hitherto too ju&s;t and con&s;iderate to deprive a Man of Part of his Property without his Con&s;ent. The Precedent brought on the other Side proves nothing. When <HI>St. Luke</HI>'s Pari&s;h was erected out of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s in <HI>Queen Anne</HI> and <HI>Talbot</HI> Counties, 1728, C. 19. the Preamble recites, <Q>Whereas Mr. <HI>Chri&s;topher Wilkin&s;on,</HI> the pre&s;ent Incumbent of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s Pari&s;h afore&s;aid, having had due Notice thereof, and <HI>making no material Ob|jections</HI> again&s;t pa&s;&s;ing of an Act, as above prayed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
It has been argued from the Words making <HI>no material Objections,</HI> that the Divi&s;ion was made without the Con&s;ent of the Incumbent; which Con&s;truction is not admi&s;&s;ible. Tho&s;e Words rather imply his Con&s;ent, and this Explanation is confirmed by a &s;imilar Recital in an Act pa&s;&s;ed 1722, C. 3. to unite Part of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s Pari&s;h in <HI>Baltimore</HI> County to <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> Pari&s;h in <HI>Anne-Arundel</HI> County, <Q>that the Rev. Mr. <HI>Tibbs,</HI> the pre&s;ent In|cumbent of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s Pari&s;h, had due Notice thereof, and <HI>makes no Objections</HI> again&s;t pa&s;&s;ing of an Act as afore&s;aid.</Q></P>
<P>Again, when the remaining Part of the &s;aid Pari&s;h of <HI>St. Paul</HI> was made a new Pari&s;h, and Part of <HI>All Hallows</HI> and <HI>St. Anne</HI>'s Pari&s;hes added, the Preamble recites,
<PB N="21" REF="011830_0020_0F8D4E745F556490">
<Q>that the Rev. Me&s;&s;. <HI>Tibbs, John Humphreys</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph Golbatch,</HI> the &s;everal Incum|bents of the &s;everal Pari&s;hes, after having due Notice thereof, and <HI>making no mate|rial Objections,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>In both the&s;e In&s;tances, <HI>making no Objections,</HI> and <HI>making no material Objections,</HI> are &s;ynonimou&s;ly u&s;ed, and imply the Con&s;ent rather than the Di&s;&s;ent of the &s;everal In|cumbents. For if they had made any Objections, that &s;uch a Divi&s;ion, again&s;t their Will, was contrary to publick Faith, to Law and Precedent, they mu&s;t have ap|peared <HI>material</HI> to any Legi&s;lature upon Earth.</P>
<P>It may be contended, that a Legi&s;lature can make a Precedent where they find none; and that they are omnipotent within their Juri&s;diction. But there are &s;ome Things impo&s;&s;ible for Omnipotence it&s;elf. God him&s;elf cannot contradict his own Attributes; one of the principal of which is <HI>Ju&s;tice.</HI> He cannot do an <HI>unju&s;t</HI> Thing. An Example worthy the Imitation of the Powers on Earth.</P>
<P>The Charter, which give the Legi&s;lature here its legal Exi&s;tence, grants the Cler|gy the Protection of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws. <HI>The Church is directed to be dedicated and con&s;ecrated according to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws of the Kingdom of</HI> England. The Rights of the Clergy and of the Laity are coeval and coexi&s;tent: As the Layman claims a Trial by his Peers, &s;o a Clergyman &s;hall not be deprived but by legal Proce&s;s, and a final Sentence pronounced by a Bi&s;hop; that is to &s;ay by canonical Cen&s;ures, or in pur&s;uance of diver&s;e penal Statutes, which declare the Benefice void, for &s;ome Non-fea&s;ance or Neglect, or &s;ome Mal-fea&s;ance or Crime. The Extent of a Pa|ri&s;h, or the Largene&s;s of an Income, are not Objects within the Cogni&s;ance of that Law; and if a Man perform his Duty con&s;cientiou&s;ly and to the be&s;t of his Abili|ties, he is as free from its Cen&s;ures as its Puni&s;hments. If Property may be alienated by Violence, becau&s;e it is thought too much, no Man is &s;ecure, becau&s;e each en|vious Per&s;on thinks his Neighbour has too much.</P>
<P>Tithes in <HI>England</HI> are of common Right. They have the Protection and Support of the common Law. If a Per&s;on be unju&s;tly deprived of his Benefice by an eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Court, he has his Remedy in the Court of King's Bench, where a Prohibi|tion is granted. But old Age, Infirmity, or Non-re&s;idence, are not &s;uffi|cient, in the Eye of the common Law, to countenance a Deprivation. In &s;uch Ca&s;es the Ordinary may provide, who has by Statute <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">12 <HI>Ann.</HI> St. 2. C. 12.</NOTE> a Power of &s;eque&s;tering Part of the Income of the Pari&s;h to pay an A&s;&s;i&s;tant.</P>
<P>An Induction in this Province is in the Nature of a Patent; and if an Induction can be vacated, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it includes the Circumference of 100 Miles, a Patent may be vacated upon the &s;ame Principle, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it contains Ten or Twenty Thou&s;and Acres of Land. The Publick is much more injured by the latter than by the former Grant. Immen&s;e Bodies of Land in a few Hands prevent the Settlement and Po|pulation of a Country, in which its Wealth and Strength con&s;i&s;t&mdash;but it is immate|rial to the Publick, if divine Service is performed, and the Ceremonies of Marriage, Burial and Chri&s;tening be done by a Per&s;on legally authori&s;ed, whether it be done by a Rector or Curate of a Pari&s;h. If the &s;acred Boundaries of Property be once vio|lated by Authority, there will &s;oon be as little legal Security on this as on the other Side of the <HI>Allegany</HI> Mountains; and our Lives will be as un&s;afe as our Property.
<Q>To bereave a Man of Life, or by Violence to confi&s;cate his E&s;tate, without Ac|cu&s;ation

or Trial, would be &s;o gro&s;s and notorious an Act of De&s;poti&s;m, as mu&s;t at once convey the Alarm of Tyranny throughout the whole Kingdom <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Black&s;tone.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;tirring up the People to petition again&s;t their re&s;pective Mini&s;ters, without any ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Complaint, is not only highly ungenerous, but &s;hows a factious and ma|lignant Di&s;po&s;ition, and tends to ruin the Peace and Happine&s;s of Society. It agitates and inflames the Minds of the People, makes them unfit to receive tho&s;e divine Precepts which recommend brotherly Love, Unity and Concord, totally de&s;troys that mutual Confidence that ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between a Mini&s;ter and his Congregation, and gives the Sectaries every po&s;&s;ible Advantage again&s;t the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church. A Man may perhaps gain a little tran&s;itory popularity, an additional Vote at an Election, or the Huzzas of a Mob, but can never have the Approbation of his own Con&s;cience, or the Applau&s;e of prudent Men, who di&s;turbs the Peace of his Neighbourhood, from &s;uch mean, and apparently &s;elf-intere&s;ted Con&s;iderations.&mdash;The Clergy have now, how|ever, an Opportunity of counteracting tho&s;e Mea&s;ures, and of regaining the good Will and Confidence of the People. They are looked upon as mercenary; I do not know they are more &s;o than other Men. Upon Failure of the In&s;pecting Act, the Law of 1701-2 will give them an indubitable Right to 40 <ABBR>lb</ABBR> of Tobacco <HI>per</HI> Poll: but the Upper Hou&s;e has propo&s;ed during this Se&s;&s;ion, and the Lower Hou&s;e has acceded to the Propo&s;ition, that the Clergy &s;hould receive on 32 Pounds of Tobacco, at the Rate of 12<ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 <HI>per</HI> Hundred (<HI>i. e.</HI> 4 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> common Money <HI>per</HI> Poll) which additional Two Pounds in the Money Payments, to what was a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed under the late In&s;pection Law, may, I apprehend, be founded on &s;imilar Rea&s;ons to tho&s;e explained in the Tenth Page of the foregoing Letter.</P>
<P>The Advantage hence to tho&s;e who do not rai&s;e Tobacco will be con&s;iderable, as they will be freed from the di&s;agreeable Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;wearing off making Tobacco for the future, or otherwi&s;e of lying at the Mercy of the Sheriff, who may make them pay at the Tobacco Price; and the Benefit to the Tobacco makers will be &s;till greater, who, &s;uppo&s;ing Tobacco to average 20<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> Currency <HI>per</HI> Hundred, may pay the Clergy off at 4<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> in&s;tead of 8<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> a Tax, the Value of 40 Pounds of Tobacco.</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit it therefore, whether it would not be equally for the Ea&s;e of the Clergy and of the People, that the Clergy agree, and publi&s;h their Con&s;ent in the Gazette, that all Per&s;ons indebted to them for the 40 Pounds of Tobacco <HI>per</HI> Poll, may di&s;|charge the &s;ame to the Sheriffs in Tobacco before the 10th of <HI>June</HI> Yearly, or in common Money, at 4<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> <HI>per</HI> Poll, before the 10th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> Yearly, until other Pro|vi&s;ion be made by Act of A&s;&s;embly.&mdash;The Clergy can give no Umbrage to Govern|ment, as the Propo&s;ition flowed from the Upper Hou&s;e, and the People will pay with Chearfulne&s;s, as it was approved by their Repre&s;entatives. By this Conduct the Clergy will prevent the undue Advantages that may be taken of them in the Collection of the 40 <HI>per</HI> Poll, will cut off many Occa&s;ions of Di&s;pute and Altercation, will &s;top many unnece&s;&s;ary Law-&s;uits, &s;tand higher than ever in the Opinion of their Friends, and even force their Enemies to admire, what they would not have Virtue to imitate.</P>
