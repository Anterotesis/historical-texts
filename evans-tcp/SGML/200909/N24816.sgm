<L>Your ro&s;es Iillies, and &s;ighs pa&s;s away,</L>
<L>And pa&s;&s;ion will die as your beauties decay.</L>
<L>U&s;e the man that you wed like your fav'rite guittar,</L>
<L>Tho' mu&s;ic in both, they are both apt to jar;</L>
<L>How tuneful and &s;oft from a delicate touch,</L>
<L>Not handled too roughly, nor play'd on too much!</L>
<L>The &s;parrow and linnet will feed from your hand,</L>
<L>Grow tame by your kindne&s;s, and come at command;</L>
<L>Exert with your hu&s;band the &s;ame happy &s;kill,</L>
<L>For hearts, like your birds, may be tam'd to your will.</L>
<L>Be gay and good humour'd, complying and kind,</L>
<L>Turn the chief of your care from your face to your mind;</L>
<L>'Tis thus that a wife may her conque&s;t improve,</L>
<L>And Hymen &s;hall rivet the fetters of LOVE.</L>

<L>His Phyllis was fond of his prai&s;e,</L>

<L>Since life I know &s;hortly mu&s;t end:</L>
<L>While Ceres mo&s;t kindly refills my brown jug,</L>
<L>With good ale I will make my&s;elf mellow;</L>
<L>In my old wicker chair I will &s;eat my&s;elf &s;nug,</L>

<L>I'll ne'er trouble my head with the cares of the nation,</L>

<L>For the cares of this life are but grief and vexation,</L>
<L>To death we mu&s;t all be con&s;ign'd:</L>
<L>Then I laugh, drink and &s;moke, and leave nothing to pay,</L>
<L>But drop like a pear that is ripe and mellow;</L>

Heire&s;s of a good many hou&s;es, and a bit of very plea&s;ant ground,</L>
<L>Which would have amounted, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, to very near five thou&s;and pound.</L>

<L>He had great hopes one day of becoming Lord Mayor, &s;o he look'd mighty big,</L>
<L>And came in cutting as many capers as if he had been dancing a jig.</L>
<L>Oftentation!</L>

<L>So Mr. Starch was very much affronted, and left the hou&s;e in a terrible rage.</L>
<L>Indignation!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next came a <HI>Lawyer,</HI> as big as my Lord Chancellor, and with maje&s;tic bow,</L>
<L>Pre&s;ented his <HI>petition</HI> in due form&mdash;for who had a better title to <HI>&s;ue?</HI></L>

<L>Expectation!</L>
</LG>

<L>On his entrance, with &s;ome ceremony, he made bold to &s;it down,</L>
<L>And inform'd her he was a per&s;on of great fame and re|nown,</L>
<L>Well known to all the young bloods of fortune, and rakes in the town,</L>
<L>And that he was even &s;ometimes employed by gentry of of the gown.</L>

<L>During this &s;peech, in ev'ry feature importance you might trace;</L>

<HEAD>SONG. THE LUCKY ESCAPE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>I THAT was once a ploughman, a &s;ailor am now,</L>
<L>No lark that aloft in the &s;ky,</L>
<L>Ever &s;lutter'd his wings to give &s;peed to the plough,</L>
<L>Was &s;o gay and &s;o carele&s;s as I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But my friend was a carfindo aboard a king's &s;hip,</L>
<L>And he ax'd me to go ju&s;t to &s;ea for a trip,</L>
<L>And he talk'k of &s;uch things,</L>
<L>As if &s;ailors were kings,</L>
<L>And &s;o teazing did keep,</L>
<L>That I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep.</L>
<L>No longer the horn,</L>
<L>Call'd me up in the morn,</L>
<L>I tru&s;ted the carfindo and the incon&s;tant wind,</L>
<L>That made me for to go and leave my dear behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I did not much like to be aboard a &s;hip,</L>
<L>When in danger there's no door to creep out;</L>
<L>I lik'd the jolly tars I lik'd bembo and flip,</L>
<L>But I did not like rocking about:</L>
<L>By and by came hurrican, I did not like that,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="032901_0172_0FF742D9AC3202B8">
Next a battle that many a &s;ailor laid flat,</L>
<L>Ah! cried I who would roam,</L>
<L>That like me had a home,</L>
<L>When I &s;ow and I'd reap,</L>
<L>Ere I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep.</L>
<L>Where &s;weetly the horn,</L>
<L>Call'd me up in the morn,</L>

<L>That made me for to go and leave my dear behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At la&s;t &s;afe I landed and in a whole &s;kin,</L>
<L>Nor did I make any long &s;tay,</L>
<L>Ere I found by a friend that I ax'd for my kin,</L>
<L>Father dead, and my wife ran away:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah who but thy&s;elf, &s;aid I, ha&s;t thou to blame,</L>
<L>Wives loo&s;ing their hu&s;bands oft loo&s;e their good name;</L>
<L>Ah why did I roam,</L>
<L>When &s;o happy at home,</L>
<L>I could &s;ow and could reap,</L>
<L>Ere I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep.</L>
<L>When &s;o &s;weetly the horn</L>
<L>Call'd me up in the morn,</L>
<L>Cur&s;e light noon the carpenter and the incon&s;tant wind,</L>
<L>That made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for to go and leave my dear behind.</L>

<LG>
<L>Why, if that be the ca&s;e, &s;aid this very &s;ame friend,</L>
<L>And you b'ent no more minded to roam,</L>
<L>Gi's a &s;hake by the fi&s;t, all your care's at an end,</L>
<L>Dad's alive and your wife's &s;afe at home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stark &s;tarting with joy, I lept out of my &s;kin,</L>
<L>Bu&s;s'd my wife, mother, &s;i&s;ter, and all of my kin;</L>
<L>Now, cried I, let them roam,</L>
<L>Who want a good home,</L>
<L>I am well &s;o I'll keep,</L>
<L>Nor again leave my plough to go ploughing the deep</L>
<L>Once more &s;hall the horn,</L>
<L>Call me up in the morn,</L>
<L>Nor &s;hall any d&mdash; carfindo nor the incon&s;tant wind</L>
<L>E'er tempt me for to go and leave my dear behind.</L>
