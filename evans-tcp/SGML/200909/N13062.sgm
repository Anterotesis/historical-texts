<P>Fir&s;t, in all their <HI>Meetings and Communi|cations</HI> with each other.</P>
<P>Secondly, in <HI>Society</HI> at large. And</P>
<P>Thirdly, in <HI>private Life,</HI> as Individuals glowing with the Love of their Spe|cies; and &s;eeking to promote their Hap|pine&s;s, as far Opportunities can reach, or the wide Wi&s;h of Benevolence extend.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e THREE GRAND PILLARS, founded on the adamantine Rock of ETER|NAL TRUTH, we profe&s;s to &s;upport the <HI>Fabric of our Labors;</HI> convinced that other Foundation than what the great MASTER-BUILDER hath laid, can no Man lay.

<P>The&s;e were my early <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sermon preach'd on St. John Bapti&s;t's Day, 1755.</NOTE> Declarations. Many Years have &s;ince roll'd over my Head.

I proceed, then, to apply the Apo&s;tle; Doctrine to my <HI>fir&s;t Head</HI> of Di&s;cour&s;e; and, for that End, it is nece&s;&s;ary to recite &s;ome preceding Parts of his &s;ublime CHARGE.</P>
<P><Q>Wherefore, &s;ays he, laying a&s;ide all Malice, and all Guile, and Hypocri&s;ies, and Envies, and all Evil-Speaking&mdash;</Q> be ye as <Q><HI>living Stones,</HI> built up a <HI>&s;piritual Hou&s;e</HI>&mdash;as FREE, and not u&s;ing your LI|BERTY as a Cloak of Maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the Servants of GOD.</Q></P>
<P>For the better under&s;tanding the&s;e Words it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that, as in our modern Times; &s;o likewi&s;e, from the fir&s;t Stages of the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> its true Purpo&s;e, re&s;pecting Li|berty both &s;piritual and temporal, hath been mi&s;under&s;tood or mi&s;interpreted by many.</P>
<P>From the Power of Bigotry, the Strength of Prejudice, a &s;trange Meanne&s;s and unhal|lowed Frame of Mind; &s;ome, who were fir&s;t called into evangelic Freedom, had &s;till, rooted in their Temper, a beggarly Hanker|ing after the old abrogated Rites and Cu&s;|toms, both <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Pagan.</HI></P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed at this, St. Paul, with his u&s;ual Fervor of Eloquence, cries out&mdash; <Q>O fooli&s;h Galatians! who hath bewitched
<PB N="9" REF="016526_0009_0F9C8B0524D3F2B0">you?&mdash;After having known God, or ra|ther are known of Him, how turn ye back to the weak and beggarly Elements, wherewith ye de&s;ire again to be united?</Q>&mdash;Quit this Folly&mdash;be per&s;uaded to <Q>&s;tand fa&s;t in the Liberty, wherewith CHRIST has made us FREE; and be not en|tangled again with the Yoke of Bondage.</Q></P>
<P>Others there were, and &s;till are, in the contrary Extreme; &s;o hardly do Men ever <HI>&s;quare</HI> their Conduct by the <HI>golden Rule,</HI> re|commended in the Text.</P>
<P>Such were many of the early Jewi&s;h Con|verts. The <HI>new Law</HI> of CHRIST, which promi&s;ed them Liberty from the ancient &s;piritual Bondage, they interpreted into a Scheme of &s;uch unbounded Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, as di&s;&s;olved all Obligations even of their own <HI>moral Law,</HI> which, he expre&s;&s;ly told them, he "came not to de&s;troy but to fulfil." Affecting to con&s;ider them&s;elves as the pe|culiar Favorites of God, and under his &s;ole Government, they &s;ought an Exemption from the Authorities of this World, and were for trampling under Foot the Powers ordained, or permitted, by him.</P>
<P>Thus, forgetting the <HI>Spirit of the Go&s;pel,</HI> and blown up with the Pride of their <HI>own
<PB N="10" REF="016526_0010_0F9C8B05E1795600">Spirit;</HI> they treated with Contempt all whom they con&s;idered as Unbelievers, or le&s;s righteous than them&s;elves. In <HI>private Life,</HI> they thought that their &s;uperior Profe&s;|&s;ions of Sanctity and furious Zeal would atone for all Sorts of <Q>Malice, Guile, Hy|pocri&s;y, Envies and Evil Speaking;</Q> and, in <HI>public Life,</HI> would ju&s;tify Seditions, Mur|ders and the De&s;truction of their Brethren&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;erable Infatuation! as if the GOD of all <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> could be &s;erved, by extirpating from our Hearts not only tho&s;e native Dictates of <HI>Humanity</HI> which were im|planted to give us &s;ome Degree of Happi|ne&s;s in this World; but tho&s;e nobler Le&s;|&s;ons of CHRISTIAN CHARITY, which are our be&s;t Preparation for the unbounded Happine&s;s of the World to come!</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle, in my Text, contends ear|ne&s;tly again&s;t this &s;ad Mi&s;take; teaching that it leads not to the <HI>U&s;e</HI> but deplorable <HI>Abu&s;e</HI> of <HI>true Liberty;</HI> making it a Covering for every wicked Purpo&s;e, and en&s;laving us more and more to tho&s;e internal Pa&s;&s;ions, from which our DIVINE MASTER came to &s;et us FREE.</P>

The&s;e are fundamental Principles, and Practices of immutable Obligation in our Society.

<P>SECOND HEAD, which was to &s;hew&mdash; That our Love to God and Man leads us to cultivate the &s;ame rational and evang lie U&s;e of Liberty in <HI>Society at large,</HI> as in our own &s;ubordinate Societies.</P>
<P>This, we know, is a more arduous La|bor; becau&s;e the &s;ame watchful Care cannot be &s;o ea&s;ily applied to the Admi&s;&s;ion, Re|jection or Government of Members, in large Societies as in &s;mall. Neverthele&s;s, if every Man, fir&s;t in his own Hou&s;e, and then in all tho&s;e le&s;&s;er Societies of Brethren with whom he may be connected, would learn, in the Apo&s;tle's U&s;e of Liberty, to &s;ubdue every evil and di&s;cordant Pa&s;&s;ion; the ble&s;&s;ed Ha|bit would ea&s;ily be carried forth into Soci|ety at large.

The whole World would be as ONE HARMONI|OUS LODGE, knit together in <HI>Brotherly Love,</HI> and obedient to the Will of the great HEAVENLY MASTER!</P>

From GOD, the &s;upreme Fountain of all Power, it could not come; without &s;uppo&s;ing he granted it to di&s;honour his own Perfections, deface his Image in his Works, and deba&s;e his whole Creation.

<P>To contend for &s;uch Governments, with a holy, enlightened, and unquenchable zeal, is the highe&s;t temporal Glory. Wherefore, we dwell with Rapture upon the Records of former Renown, and con|template with Veneration tho&s;e tran&s;cend|ent Scenes of Heroi&s;m; in which we behold the BRAVE 2nd the FREE wearing upon their Swords the Fate of Millions&mdash;while the divine GENIUS OF VICTORY, e&s;pou&s;ing their Cau&s;e, hovers o'er their Heads with expanded Wing; reaching forth the immor|tal Wreath that is to &s;urround their trum|phant Brow; and &s;miling upon the <HI>deci&s;ive Moment</HI> that is to fix the Happine&s;s of future Generations!</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>LUCIUS QUINTIUS CINCINNATUS was a Patrician of Rome. In the 293d Year of the City, his Son CAESO, a Youth of high Spirit, great Credit, and con&s;um|mate Bravery, exa&s;perated the Tribunes of the People, by &s;ome &s;evere Animadver&s;ions upon their Conduct; and was accu&s;ed of TREASON. A Day was appointed for his Trial, and ten Securities (which was the fir&s;t in&s;tance of <HI>Bail</HI>) taken for his Appearance; each being bound in the Sum of <HI>three thou&s;and A&s;&s;es,</HI> about <HI>Nine Pounds Thirteen Shill|ings and Nine Pence,</HI> Sterling. Apprehen&s;ive of a Trial, where his Accu&s;ers were to be his Judges, he retired into voluntary Bani&s;hment among the Etrurians, before the Day fixed for his Appearance. His Father refu&s;ed to &s;uffer the Securities to Pay the Forfeiture, which fell &s;hort of <HI>One Hundred Pounds, Sterling;</HI> and &s;old all his E&s;tate, to &s;atisfy the public Ju&s;tice, except about FOUR ACRES and a MEAN COTTAGE, on the farther Side of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> afterwards called the <HI>Quintian Meadows.</HI> To this little Spot he re|tired, and &s;upported him&s;elf in a humble, virtuous, and ob|&s;cure Independency, by the Labour of his own Hands, and of &s;ome Slaves; never cro&s;&s;ing the River to vi&s;it the City, or take Part in Public Affairs.</P>
<P>About a Year afterwards, he was elected Con&s;ul, and called from his Retreat. He di&s;charged his high Office with Dig|nity; appea&s;ed the Tumults of the City; re&s;tored the Ad|mini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice; refu&s;ed to &s;et the bad Example of

<P>About two Years afterwards, the Aequi, having made War upon Rome, &s;hut up the Con&s;ul MINUCIUS within his Camp near the City; and brought him to the Extremi|ty, either of &s;tarving by Famine, or &s;urrendering at Di&s;|cretion. In this &s;ad Emergency, CINCINNATUS was de|clared DICTATOR, and a deputation of the Senate &s;ent to bring him from his Retreat. The venerable Patriot was <HI>at his Plough,</HI> <Q>covered only from his Reins to his Knees, with a Cap on his Head.</Q> When he &s;aw the Deputies, with their Croud of Attendants approaching, he &s;topped his Oxen; and a&s;king, <HI>if all was well,</HI> ordered his wife <HI>Racilia</HI> in ha&s;te to bring his Gown, that he might be co|vered, in Re&s;pect to his Vi&s;itants.

But, on Account of the Tumults in the City, the Elec|tion of Con&s;uls did not take place that Year, till the Month of De|cember; a Sea&s;on neither &s;uitable for the Plough, nor corre&s;pond|ing with Du&s;t, Sweat, and a half-naked Body. I have, therefore, followed Livy, as better informed than the Greck Hi&s;torian; though, without doubt, Cincinnatus on both Occa&s;ions was found bu&s;y in his rural Labour.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is the CINCINNATUS who&s;e Character is briefly touched in the foregoing Sermon; but, as if Magnanimity and Moderation were the hereditary Qualities of the Name and Family, there was another CINCINNATUS (TITUS QUINTIUS) in the 375th year of Rome (Liv. VI. 28, 29) who followed the Example of the former. At that Period, when the private Di&s;&s;entions of the Citizens raged with &s;uch violence, as &s;uper&s;eded all attention to the public Safety; the Praene&s;tines, &s;eizing the favourable opportunity, invad|ed the Roman Territory; and, laying all wa&s;te before them, advanced to the Colline Gate, threatning the immediate De&s;truction of the City. In this dreadful Cri&s;is, the Second CINCINNATUS, who had been one of the Military Tribunes, was called forth to the high Office of Dictator Such was the Veneration of his Character among his Fel|low-Citizens, and the Dread of it among their Enemies; that the Voice of Di&s;&s;ention immediately cea&s;ed among the former, and the latter fled with Precipitation from the Walls. He pur&s;ued and reduced them to Peace, having fir&s;t taken all their Cities (<HI>nine</HI> in Number) including <HI>Prene&s;te</HI> it&s;elf; carrying back from thence in Triumph the <HI>Statue</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which, as a monument of his Virtues, was erected
<PB N="33" REF="016526_0033_0F9C8B1720A577B8">in the Capitol, with the following In&s;cription upon its Pede&s;tal, viz.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>JUPITER ATQUE DIVI OMNES HOC DEDERUNT, UT T. QUINTIUS DICTATOR OPPIDA NOVEM CAPERET.</Q></P>
<P>But it was neither this Monument of his Country's Gra|titude, nor the Exploits for which it was Dedicated, that could have &s;ecured to him his principal Eminence of Re|nown. The Monument hath yielded to the wa&s;te of years or barbaric Rage; and his Fame, as well as that of the Elder Cincinnatus, would now, at mo&s;t, have only been blended with theirs, who, for the &s;ake of their Country, have mag|nanimou&s;ly &s;ubdued <HI>others;</HI> if each of them had not exhi|bited a more illu&s;trious Proof of Magnanimity by &s;ubduing <HI>Him&s;elf.</HI> For, although they might &s;everally have held the Dictator&s;hip <HI>&s;ix Months,</HI> and thereby advanced their own Fortune, their Friends and Dependents; yet having attained the glorious End for which they were inve&s;ted with it, the former, as already mentioned, abdicated the &s;ame the <HI>&s;ixteenth,</HI> and the latter the <HI>twentieth Day;</HI> both retiring &s;elf-&s;atisfied, amid&s;t the Applau&s;es of their Country, to enjoy the calm Repo&s;e of private Life.</P>
<P>The eloquent and judicious <HI>Rollin,</HI> &s;peaking of the elder CINCINNATUS, makes the following beautiful Reflections: <Q>Methinks I &s;ee Poverty enter Rome in Triumph with him. It appears indeed cloathed with Purple, and with a pompous Equipage; but does not derive its Lu&s;tre from them. It rather adorns that Pomp, and exalts the Splen|dor of the Purple. The Dictator will &s;oon return to his Field and his Labor; but he will be neither le&s;s great nor le&s;s venerable, in his humble poor Cottage, than he is now upon his Car of Victory. What force, what Power has Virtue!

<P>Struck with an enthu&s;ia&s;tic Veneration for this Part of Cincinnatus's Character (and that of other Romans, &s;uch as Fabricius, who &s;hewed them&s;elves &s;uperior to all the Temp|tations of Wealth and Power) our Poet THOMSON nobly contra&s;ts the following beautiful Lines, to the growing Luxury and Corruption of his Day&mdash;</P>
