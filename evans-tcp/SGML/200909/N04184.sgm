<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Honoured</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT your De&s;ire the following <HI>Sermon</HI> is &s;ent to the Pre&s;s; to YOU therefore I in Form pre&s;ent it. You have al&s;o gratified the De&s;ires of others, who wi&s;h'd to <HI>read</HI> it after they had heard it. I pray GOD it may be of &s;piritual Profit to you and them.</P>
<P>GOD <HI>has made his wonderful Works to be remem|bred: His Work is honourable and glorious, &s;ought out by all them that have Plea&s;ure therein;</HI> which <HI>all</HI> ought to have. At Times therefore we ought to <HI>preach</HI> on this Subject, but always in an <HI>evangelical, &s;criptural</HI> and &s;piritual Manner. A <HI>Chri&s;tian Audience</HI>
<PB N="ii" REF="005155_0004_1016C9540B7F9698">&s;hould ever be &s;o treated, edified and gratified. I plea&s;e my &s;elf with thinking, it was <HI>this</HI> that gave the <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> it's Force and Acceptance with &s;o many. If now in <HI>reading</HI> it, they or others may find a like Plea&s;ure and <HI>Benefit,</HI> they will thank you, <HI>Sir,</HI> under GOD, as the Hand that conveys it to them.</P>
<P>GOD has &s;et You near the Head of our <HI>Province</HI> for worldly E&s;tate and <HI>Riches;</HI> but the <HI>true Honour</HI> which we wi&s;h You, and to all our Brethren of like <HI>&s;uperior</HI> worldly Circum&s;tances, <HI>cometh from above the Firmament;</HI> even the Riches of <HI>Grace,</HI> the <HI>endur|ing Sub&s;tance,</HI> a Trea&s;ure in <HI>Heaven</HI> which faileth not. We are therefore commanded by our LORD and SAVIOUR, to <HI>charge them that are rich in this World, that they be not high-minded, nor tru&s;t in uncertain Riches, but in the</HI> LIVING GOD, <HI>who gives us richly all Things to enjoy: That they do Good, be rich in good Works, ready to di&s;tribute, willing to communicate; laying up in Store for them&s;elves a good Foundation again&s;t the Time to come, that they may lay hold of eter|nal Life.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>weekly</HI> SABBATH is the &s;pecial, reverend and perpetual <HI>Memorial</HI> to us of the Wi&s;dom, <HI>Power</HI> and Goodne&s;s of GOD in his Work of CREATION; and a more gracious and &s;olemn <HI>Memorial</HI> thereof could not be given us, for the <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD from us, or for &s;piritual <HI>Good</HI> to us from GOD.</P>
<P>How nece&s;&s;ary is it for us in our fallen State, to be call'd <HI>off</HI> every <HI>Week</HI> from our worldly Works, to a <HI>calm</HI> deliberate and rais'd <HI>Contemplation</HI> of GOD our MARKER, PRESERVER, REDEEMER and SANCTIFIER; in his whole Work of Nature, Providence &amp; Grace!
