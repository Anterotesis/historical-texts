<P>MAN was orginally form'd &amp; de|&s;ign'd by the glorious, bounteous and beneficent Author of his be|ing, for Religion and Happine&s;s; and in a wi&s;e &amp; harmonious &s;ub&s;erviency here|unto for Society, mutual Conver&s;e, Commerce, Aid and Helpfulne&s;s: As is evident from his original Make, Frame and Con&s;titution; and likewi&s;e from the Oracles of Truth.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="005295_0004_1016F458F6401B78">
<HI>Adam</HI> was fir&s;t form'd then <HI>Eve:</HI> For the LORD God &s;aid, <HI>It is not good that the man &s;hould be alone.</HI> And if the fir&s;t man <HI>Adam</HI> while in a &s;tate of Innocence, would have been unea&s;ie, even in the garden of <HI>Eden</HI> and grop'd for happine&s;s in the mid&s;t of Paradi&s;e: at lea&s;t would not have been &s;o happy as his Nature (which was a Copy of the Divine and therefore Communicative) was capable of, for want of a Companion of his own Species; a Fellow-helper and a Partner in his Joys, had not God made him an <HI>Help-meet for him:</HI> If Company was nece&s;&s;ary to compleat his Fe|licity while in a &s;tate of integrity &amp; perfecti|on; &s;urely we in this lap&s;ed State, can't &s;ub|&s;i&s;t and live independent one of another. Naked &amp; helple&s;s come we out of our Mothers womb and &s;hould &s;oon return thither, &s;hou'd die from the womb and give up the gho&s;t as &s;oon as born, did not the knees prevent us &amp; the brea&s;ts that we &s;hould &s;uck. Nor are or wants dimini&s;hed as our days or years are mul|tiplied, but rather grow and increa&s;e upon us: Wo therefore to him that is alone and hath not another to help him.</P>
<P>Mankind cou&s;ider's as divided into different and di&s;tinct Families, Churches, Towns, Go|vernments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are Members one of another, and thence obliged to be Social. God hath &s;o &s;et and plac'd the &s;everal Members of each
<PB N="3" REF="005295_0005_1016F45BC23C6340">Body-politick of each Comminity whether Civil or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, that the Eye cannot &s;ay to the Hand, I have no need of thee; nor a|gain the Hand to the Foot, I have no need of thee: For as in the Boby-natural, if one Mem|ber rejoice, all the Members rejoicce with it; and <HI>e. c.</HI> if one Member &s;uffer, all the Mem|bers &s;uffer with it; &s;o it is here, &mdash; The King cannot &s;ub&s;ift without his Subjects; (for <HI>the King is &s;erved by the Field</HI>) neither can the Subejct be &s;afe and happy without their Sove|reign. When there is no King in I&s;rael every one does what is right in his own eyes: The dire Effects, fatal and de&s;tructive Con&s;e|quences of which, have made mankind long &s;ince, generally give into that Maxim, viz. <HI>That Tyranny it &s;elf is better and more elegible than Anarchy.</HI> Had we no Ruler over us, alas! how &s;oon &s;hould we become like the Fi&s;hes of the Sea that devour one another?</P>
<P>Well then, Since it is our intere&s;t to be un|der civil Government, it mu&s;t needs be our bounden duty to Revere, Honour and Obey them that have the Rule over us; to be &s;ubject to the higher Powers, to the King as Supream, and unto Governours and Magin&s;trates and all in Civil Authority as unto them that are &s;ent by Him, derive their Authority from Him, and act in His Maje&s;ty's Name, Ac|cordingly, we find this duty &s;trictly injoin'd &amp;
<PB N="4" REF="005295_0006_1016F460015BDAC8">frequently inculcated on us throughout the Revelations of God; and particularly in the pa&s;&s;age of &s;acred Writ and words of In&s;pira|tion which I have now read to you. Which words are found among the &s;age, judicious &amp; pithy Sentences or wi&s;e Sayings of Solomon the Son of David King of I&s;rael; who was a di|vinely in&s;pir'd Preacher, and &s;pake as he was moved by the Holy Goh&s;t</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid he &s;pake three Thou&s;and Proverbs, and in this divine Collection of them his Doctrine drop'd as the Rain, his Speech di&s;till'd as the Dew, as the &s;mall Rain upon the tender Herb and as the Showers upon the Gra&s;s: That it might be fulfilled which was &s;poken of the Lord by the Prophet David his Royal Father, &s;aying, <HI>He &s;hall come down like the Rain on the mown Gra&s;&s; and as the Showers that water the Earth, P&s;al.</HI> 72. 6.</P>
<P>It would now be an inva&s;ion of the Prie&s;ts Office for Civil Rulers (as it is for any others who are not call'd of God as was Aaron) to take this honour to them&s;elves, <HI>viz.</HI> to be publick Teachers or Exhorters. (<HI>The Lord rebuke the madne&s;s of all &s;uch fal&s;e Prophets who run before they are &s;ent; &s;uch Sons of Chorah, &s;uch pre&s;umptuous &V;zza's who venture to touch the Ark.</HI>) Neverthele&s;s in the days of In&s;piration and while the Mo&s;aick Oeconomy and Legal Ad|mini&s;tration la&s;ted, we find that &s;ome who
<PB N="5" REF="005295_0007_1016F462B8E5FAA0">were Kings were likewi&s;e Prophets and Teachers. So Solomon by God's Command|ment was anointed King, and by his Spirit was made the Preacher: Nor does this great and renowned Prince think it beneath the dig|nity of his Royal Character to undertake the In&s;truction of others in things pertaining to God and Religion; &mdash; For 'tis manife&s;tly his great Scope and De&s;ign in this (as al&s;o in his Book call'd <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tes</HI>) to teach men <HI>the fear of the Lord which is the beginning of wi&s;|dom, and to depart from evil which is under&s;tanding.</HI> See <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.1, &mdash; 4.</P>
<P>Happy were they that continually &s;tood be|fore him and heard his wi&s;dom; and happy are we that have the&s;e Divine <HI>Aphori&s;ms</HI> copied out and handed down to us: But e&s;pecially &s;ince we know the&s;e things, happy are we if we do them.</P>
<P>Among many other Excellent words of Coun&s;el, documents of Wi&s;dom, precepts and rules of Living contain'd in this Book, calcula|ted and tending to render us happy both here and hereafter, our Text is one; which is in|troduc'd with this loving &amp; endearing, kind and winning Compellation, <HI>My Son,</HI> &mdash; A term or title expre&s;&s;ive of his tender Affection and paternal Regards to his fellow Men; of his pitying them like as a Father pities his Children. And it may likewi&s;e be de&s;ign'd
<PB N="6" REF="005295_0008_1016F46441E6FFE0">to intimate to his Hearers that they ought (as becomes Children) to be of a docible, tracta|ble, teachable di&s;po&s;ition, ready and forward to learn, to hearken to and follow whol&s;om &amp; good Advice.</P>
<P>The Coun&s;el of GOD and the Divine Cau|tion here given, is (if I mi&s;take not) peculiar|ly Sea&s;onable for us at this <HI>Pre&s;ent Day.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore we &s;hall now endeavour briefly to Explain and Inforce the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The words may be divided into Three parts or di&s;tinct Heads of Di&s;cour&s;e, which I &s;hall a little Expatiate and Inlarge upon, in the Order wherein they here &s;tand plac'd.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t is, &mdash; <HI>Fear thou the LORD,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Now to fear the Lord, is to be truly, &s;incerely and practically Religious and Godly, or Holy in heart and life. The phra&s;e denotes <HI>univer&s;al Piety:</HI> And we are here implicitly injoin'd to labour after all that &s;piritual &amp; divine Know|lege, Faith, Love, Repentance, Reverence, Fear, Hope and holy Obedience which the Go&s;pel makes requi&s;ite and nece&s;&s;ary in order to our finding Acceptance with God and be|ing Intided to that great Goodne&s;s, (that un|&s;peakable and eternal Felicity) which he hath laid up for them that fear him, and tru&s;t in him before the Sons of men &mdash; Diligently to
<PB N="7" REF="005295_0009_1016F4674A90F8A8">&s;earch and &s;tudy the holy Scriptures, in order to know what we are to believe concerning God and what duties he requires fo us, &mdash; To believe and medicate on the Being, Attributes and Perfections of the Deity, &mdash; To believe that God is, and that he is (thro Chri&s;t) a Rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek and faith&s;ully &s;erve Him, &mdash; To realize our natu|rally &s;inful and guilly State, the Depravity, Corruption and Impotency of our fallen Na|ture, and the great Guilt we have contracted by our multiplied acts of Rebe&s;&s;ion again&s;t the Divine M je&s;ty. &mdash; To turn from Sin to God by Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t &mdash; To make choice of Him &amp; delight in Him as the chief Object of happine&s;s and as our <HI>Summun <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">o|num</HI> &mdash; To &s;ee to it that our Hearts be right with God and &s;teadfa&s;t in his Covenant, con|form'd and obedient to his Preceptive and Re|&s;ign'd to his Providential Will, &mdash; To Love, Honour, Admire, Wor&s;hip, Reverence and A|dore Him, &mdash; To be Thankful to Him and ble&s;s his Name for all his Benefits, &mdash; To Pray and make Supplications to Him Sanctity his Day, wait on him in all his Sacred in&s;thu|tions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In a word, To be as becometh the Go&s;pel both in the temper of our Mind and in the tenour of our Life and practical Conver|&s;ation. &mdash; Our rightly fearing of the Lord implies thus much. We find the &s;ame phra&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="005295_0010_1016F46B80CDDB38">frequently u&s;ed in Scripture, importing a &s;e|rious and firm Belief, and con&s;cientious Ob|&s;ervance of all that God in his Word teacher us &amp; requires of us. And this Royal preacher in particular thus Expounds him&s;elf, Eccl. 12. 13 <HI>Fear God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for this is the whole of man:</HI> His whole duty and intere&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Ble&s;&s;ed of God and happy then are all they that fear Him and hope in his Mercy, who&s;e Mercy is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting upon them that fear him. Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his Commandments. The fear of the Lord tendeth to Life, and he that hath it &s;hall abide &s;atisfied. The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will &s;hew them his Convenant. Surely his Salvation is nigh them that fear him, and as the Heaven is high above the Earth, &s;o great is his Mercy toward them. He will ble&s;s them that fear the Lord, both &s;mall and great: He will fulfill their de&s;ire, He al&s;o will hear their Cry and will &s;ave them.</HI></P>
<P>But I pa&s;s on,</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider the Importance of the next Head of advice contain'd in the Text, or to &s;hew what it is to <HI>fear the King.</HI> The term King is undoubtedly here figurately and &s;y|necdochically put for all that are in civil Au|thority, whom we are frequently in Scripture commanded to Fear, Honour, Obey and be in
<PB N="9" REF="005295_0011_1016F46E2E92ED88">all dutiful Subjection unto. And as fearing the Lord imports univer&s;al Piety; &s;o by fear|ing the King, we may under&s;tand <HI>univer&s;al Loyalty,</HI> i e all the Duties we owe to civil Rulers as &s;uch: Not only the King who is Supream, but all who are in Subordinate Au|thority have a right to what is couch'd and in|tended in this expre&s;&s;ion See 1 Pet 2 12, 14 <HI>Submit your &s;elves to every Ordinance of man, for the Lord's &s;ake; whether it be to the King as Su|pream, or unto Governours, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This commandment in our text is exceeding broad and comprehen&s;ive: And would we obey it in the full Latitude and Extent of it, <HI>Supplications, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions and giving of Thanks mu&s;t be made by us for Kings, and for all that are in Authority,</HI> 1 Tim. 2 1, 2.</P>
<P>Moreover, We mu&s;t pay all due Re&s;pect &amp; civil Honours to men of this character, accord|ing to their dignity and worth; So St <HI>Peter</HI> expounds our Text, 1 Pet. 2.17. <HI>Fear GOD, Honour the King.</HI> Compare this with Rom. 13.7. <HI>Render to all their dues, Cu&s;tom to whom Cu&s;tom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Ho|nour.</HI> We &s;hould beware that we our &s;elves do in no wi&s;e &s;light, de&s;pi&s;e or ca&s;t contempt upon their Per&s;ons or Authority; and do all we can to prevent this in others, &mdash; And that their Honour may be upheld and their Per&s;ons had in Reverence of all, &mdash; That none may
<PB N="10" REF="005295_0012_1016F46FB523AB10">di&s;regard and trample on their Authority, vilify their Government, or lay their Honour in the du&s;t. We are bound and obliged by all the Laws of God re&s;pecting our duty to|wards them, to yield a chearful Obdience to all their good and whol&s;om Laws. <HI>Rebellion is as the &s;in of Witchcraft.</HI> Before men adven|ture to tran&s;gre&s;s humane Laws, they had need be &s;ure that that Text will bear 'em out in &s;o doing. Act. 4.19 <HI>Whether it be right in the &s;ight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, Judge ye.</HI> &mdash; A Text frequently mi&s;|applyd, wre&s;ted, perverted and mi&s;improv'd, e&s;pecially <HI>at this Day.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t be able to make it evident from the lively Oracles, that Mi&s;chief is fram'd and that Iniquity is e&s;tabli&s;h'd by a Law, be|fore we may venture to act Counter there|unto.</P>
<P>They certainly run a dreadful ri&s;que and do it at their utmo&s;t peril, who di&s;obey and trample on &s;uch Laws of Men, as are not re|pugnant but con&s;onant to the Divine Law. See Rom. 13.1, 2. <HI>Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject unto the higher Powers; for the Powers that be are ordained of God: Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God; and they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves Damnation. Where|fore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for Con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005295_0013_1016F4716DB9C3C8">
The Enacting human Laws &amp; civil Statutes for the Puni&s;hment of evil doers and the En|couragement of them that do well; the main|taining and promoting Peace and good Order, the protection of the Church and furthering of the Common-weal, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all Di&s;or|ders, frowning away Seducers, and preventing the prevailing and &s;preading of dangerous Er|rors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is one (and none of the lea&s;t) of tho&s;e ways wherein they that are inve&s;ted with Legi&s;lative Power and Authority are the Mini&s;ters of God unto their People for good: And it is a de&s;pi&s;ing the Divine goodne&s;s here|in; a contemning and di&s;honouring our Poli|tical Fathers, and a &s;hameful violation of the fifth Commandment for any to di&s;regard, go a|bre&s;t to or counter-act &s;uch Laws.</P>
<P>Further, We are bound in all proper ways and methods, to expre&s;s our gratitude and thankfulne&s;s not only to God, but likewi&s;e to the&s;e wi&s;e and good Patriots; the&s;e Patrons of our Civil and Religious Enjoyments, Liberties, Rights and Privileges; for all the Quietne&s;s we injoy by their Providence, &mdash; To te&s;tify our Fidelity to them; to &s;tand by 'em, to &s;tand up for them and endeavour to Encourage their Hearts and &s;trengthen their Hands; and not imagine Mi&s;chief again&s;t them, nor con&s;ult to ca&s;t them down from their Excellency.

Further &s;till, The&s;e publick Labourers are worthy of their Hire, <HI>Rom</HI> 13.7. The dignity of their Po&s;t their publick Tru&s;t and exten&s;ive U&s;efulne&s;s demands an an&s;werable, that is, an honourable Reward. And the withholding more than is meet in this ca&s;e is a burning &s;hame, a high di&s;grace and reproach to any People, &mdash; It argues them to be of a narrow, contracted, &s;tingy, &s;ordid and ungrateful &s;pirit and temper of mind.&mdash; And &s;uch Par&s;imony for ever tendeth to poverty.</P>
<P N="3">III. We come now to con&s;ider the la&s;t and Cautionary Branch or part of the Text,&mdash; <HI>And meddle not with them that are given to Change.</HI></P>
<P>And here I &s;hall endeavour of &s;hew,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Who or what manner of Per&s;ons the&s;e are.</HI> And.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>That the&s;e are not to be meddl'd with.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>To begin with the fir&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to draw the ugly, mi&s;hapen and forlorn Picture of them that are given to Change.</P>
<P>And this mu&s;t be done in <HI>Miniaeture:</HI> For it would be endle&s;s to trace them in their almo&s;t infinite mutations, mazes, meanders, intricate turnings &amp; windings, in all their Excentrick, Progre&s;&s;ive and Retrograde, Apogee and Perigee motions.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005295_0015_1016F47A6D0A9420">
But to come to the Point and to the Ca&s;e in hand.</P>
<P>They that are given to Change, are men that (being under the direction, influence &amp; government of no fix'd &s;teady Principles) are frequently altering their Mind, &s;hifting and changing their Opinion, and in con&s;equence hereof their Practice and Conduct, not for the better but for the wor&s;e</P>
<P>There is a good as well as a bad Change: A Change which all of us are, or mu&s;t be the Subjects of as ever we hope to be happy, <HI>viz.</HI> That which St Paul &s;peaks of; 2 Cor. 3.18 <HI>We all with open face beholding as in a gla&s;s the glory of the Lord, are chang'd into the &s;ame Image from glory to glory, oven as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> There is &s;uch a thing as a man's chan|ging from bad to good, and from good to bet|ter, which cannot be condemned. If men have imbib'd un&s;ound Principles, embrac'd Errors and e&s;pous'd fal&s;e Maxims and acted upon them; 'tis fit they &s;hould change their Sentiments and alter their Cour&s;e of acting &mdash; 'Tis &s;trictly Ju&s;t, 'tis Honorary to our Profe&s;|&s;ion as Chri&s;tians, and our Glory as Men to Embrece Truth when ever it offers it &s;elf to our Choice: 'Tis highly commendable for any when they find them&s;elves in an Error, whether in Opinion or Practice, &s;peedily to renounce, relinqui&s;h and abandon the &s;ame:
<PB N="14" REF="005295_0016_1016F47BF5097FD8">To exchange fal&s;hood for truth, darkne&s;s for light, and bitter things for &s;weet. 'Tis prai&s;e|worthy to do all we can to rectify our Mi&s;takes and fal&s;e Judgments of things, and to turn from crooked and perver&s;e Ways into &s;uch as are right and &s;trait, and the paths of Peace,</P>
<P>But this (I conceive) is not the Change here intended. No but a changing from good to bad, or from better to wor&s;e; a changing true Maxims and Opinions for fal&s;e ones: turning away from the truth and turning unto fables, and turning from the right ways of the Lord to commit works with the workers of Iniquity.</P>
<P>Changlings there are of this &s;ort too too many. There are, who love and u&s;e Changes, and are &s;o addicted hereunot, that they are here &s;aid <HI>to be given to Change;</HI> even as one that inordinately loves and follows &s;trong Drink is &s;aid to be given to it, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.8.</P>
<P>Some there are who are Un&s;table in all their ways, in their obedience to God, and to the King, and are prone to Rebellion again&s;t both. They Change their mind &amp; manners al|mo&s;t as often as the <HI>Camaleon</HI> is &s;aid to change his Colour: Are as changeable as the Wea|ther &amp; variable as the Wind: Meer Weather-Cocks &mdash; Con&s;tant in nothing, &s;ave only in Incon&s;tancy.</P>

<P>Proceed we now to make it our, that men given to Change are not to be meddled with. And this may appear in the light of the&s;e following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. The meddling with men of this Character is expre&s;ly Forbidden by the Holy Gho&s;t in this and implicitly in &s;undry other Texts of Scripture: Particularly where we are Cau|tion'd not to be <HI>Partakers of other mens Sins; To withdraw from them that walk Di&s;orderly; To mark them that cau&s;e Divi&s;ions and avoid them.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. Their being oppos'd in the Text to &s;uch as Fear GOD and the King, plainly intimates that they are men of no Religion, men void of Piety and Loyalty; and therefore they are not to be meddl'd with.</P>
<P>The mixing our &s;elves with them in com|mon Cover&s;ation, but e&s;pecially in their Coun|&s;els, is unprofitable, yea, 'tis hurtful: <HI>For their Heart &s;tudieth De&s;truction and their Lips talk of Mi&s;chief,</HI> Prov. 24.2. Hence Job could &s;ay, Chap. 21.16. <HI>The Coun&s;el of the wicked is far from me.</HI> He that walketh with the wi&s;e &s;hall be wi&s;e; but a companion of fools &s;hall be de|&s;troyed. And per&s;ons that Fear not GOD neither regard men cloath'd with Authority,
<PB N="23" REF="005295_0025_1016F4938B03C360">mu&s;t needs be unqualify'd and unfit to &s;u&s;tain any publick Po&s;t either in the Church or in the State. <HI>Shall even he that hateth right, govern?</HI> Job 34.17. So that they are to be let alone and not meddl'd with in this re&s;pect. If they that are given to Change are men that fear not GOD nor the King, what profit can we expect to reap from intermeddling or mixing our &s;elves with them in their Coun&s;els and Practi&s;es?</P>
<P><HI>O may Soul, come not thou into their Secret!</HI> It was David'<HI>s</HI> honour and happine&s;s that he could Appeal to Almighty GOD and profe&s;s, <HI>I am a Companion of all them that fear Thee, and of them that keep thy Precepts.</HI> And again, <HI>I have not &s;at with Vain Per&s;ons, neither will I go in with Di&s;&s;emblers: I hate the congregation of Evil doers and will not &s;it with the Wicked.</HI> So Jeremiah, Chap. 15.17. <HI>I &s;at not in the A&s;&s;embly of the Mockers, nor rejoiced.&mdash; Ble&s;&s;ed is the man that walketh not in the Coun&s;el of the &V;ngodly, nor &s;tandeth in the way of Sinners, nor &s;itteth in the &s;eat of the Scornful. The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the coun&s;els of the wicked are deceit,</HI> Prov. 12.5.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we view them in that light (or rather in that darkne&s;s) wherein they have been plac'd in the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e, we &s;hall &s;ee &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to &s;teer clear of, and have nothing to do with the&s;e men, &mdash;</P>
