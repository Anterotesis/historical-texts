<HEAD>THE ATONEMENT of CHRIST, EXPLAINED and VINDICATED.</HEAD>
<P>EVIDENCE of the infinite wi&s;dom, good|ne&s;s and power of God, has appeared in all his works from the beginning; but none of the children of Adam were ever willing to glorify him as God, until they were renewed by his grace. And where his grace hath been clearly revealed, they have always di&s;covered a di&s;po&s;ition to neglect it, and to abu&s;e its precious privileges. His law is holy, ju&s;t and good; and his go&s;pel reveals the way wherein it is magnified and made honorable in the &s;alvation of &s;inners, even the chief of them. This &s;alvation is from &s;in, as well as from mi&s;ery; and the nature of &s;in is wor&s;hipping and &s;erving the creature more than the Creator, or loving of plea&s;ures more than God. Therefore the go&s;pel, the be&s;t of news, hath ever been offen&s;ive to mankind while in their natural blindne&s;s. Yea, this blindne&s;s cannot be plainly &s;poken of, without danger of an angry inquiry, <HI>Are we blind al&s;o?</HI> Yet none of them would think it equal, in their temporal affairs, to have <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> men &s;et up as their judges, however capable they were to di&s;cern what was right, in ca&s;es wherein they were not bia&s;&s;ed. Felix found a va&s;t difference, betwixt hearing of the faith in Chri&s;t as a curio&s;ity, and his being arre&s;ted thereby as a criminal before God. Acts xxiv. 24, 25. When freemen have fairly di&s;|charged all their <HI>debts,</HI> they ever claim a right to be|&s;tow
<PB N="4" REF="020214_0004_0FAE4715284B8570"><HI>gifts</HI> on whom they plea&s;e; and gifts cannot be be&s;towed with honor upon any who claim them as debts. Neither can debts be forgiven by a credit|or, nor crimes by authority, while the debtor or the criminal denies the ju&s;tice of the charge or &s;entence again&s;t him, without giving up the nature of all go|vernment; the end of which, is the &s;afety and hap|pine&s;s of the faithful, relief to the poor and needy, and infliction of ju&s;t puni&s;hment upon the wicked. And the infliction of &s;uch puni&s;hment is as much a debt to the univer&s;e, as any thing can be a debt to individuals; <HI>For the wages of &s;in is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</HI> And every child of Adam is a <HI>&s;ervant of &s;in,</HI> until he obeys <HI>this form of doctrine from the heart.</HI> Rom. vi. 16&mdash;23.</P>
<P>But men have wracked their inventions, from age to age, to avoid this heart obedience, and yet to gra&s;p the honors and profits of religion to them&s;elves. And they have now gone &s;o far in this way, as openly to &s;et up their rea&s;on above revelation, and their feel|ings above rea&s;on. Our Lord &s;ays to all, <HI>If any man will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his cro&s;s daily, and follow me; for who&s;oever will &s;ave his life, &s;hall lo&s;e it; but who&s;oever will lo&s;e his life for my &s;ake, the &s;ame &s;hall &s;ave it.</HI> Luke ix. 23, 24. But a noted mini&s;ter in Bo&s;ton lately &s;aid, "<HI>Self-determination</HI> in us men, is the only ba&s;is of mo|ral obligation. To go about to prove this, by a long train of rea&s;oning, would be very like holding a candle to the &s;un, in its meridian lu&s;tre, for light that we might be able to &s;ee. It is a fir&s;t, and fun|damental principle in morals, and to be evidenced, not by arguing, but by an appeal to common &s;en&s;e; or, in other words, to the perceptions of mankind univer&s;ally. We <HI>feel</HI> the exi&s;tence, and operation
<PB N="5" REF="020214_0005_0FAE4715E2BE2658">of this power every day we live." And if it is not &s;o, he &s;ays, "Religion, whether natural or revealed, is a &s;en&s;ele&s;s pretence, &s;uited only to &s;erve the pur|po&s;es of politicians and prie&s;ts."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chauncy on God's benevolence, 1784, p. 128, 130, 137.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus he &s;et up rea&s;on above revelation, and feel|ings above rea&s;on; for &s;elf-determination is &s;o far from being the only ba&s;is of moral obligation, that all are <HI>rebellious children, who take coun&s;el, but not of God, and that cover with a covering, but not of his &s;pi|rit.</HI> I&s;ai. xxx. 1, 9. From &s;uch coun&s;el, multitudes are now carried away with the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation. Others oppo&s;e that doctrine, who yet act upon the principle from whence it came; as we may &s;ee in a book publi&s;hed la&s;t year, by Mr. John Rem|mele, of Newport in New-Hamp&s;hire, to prove that atonement con&s;i&s;ted wholly in the excellency of Chri&s;t's teaching and example, in his life and death, and not at all in his &s;uffering the penalty of the law for &s;inners. This book was &s;ent to me from thence, with a reque&s;t of my remarks upon this mo&s;t impor|tant &s;ubject. His arguments are as follow.</P>
<P N="1">"1. Nothing could merit favour for &s;inners, which was not in it&s;elf agreeable to the divine mind. Chri&s;t is &s;ometimes repre&s;ented in &s;cripture as paying a price, by which he purcha&s;ed his people. Acts xx. 28. 1 Cor. vi. 20. 2 Pet. ii. 1. Whatever that <HI>price</HI> was, it is &s;elf-evidently true, that it was &s;imply in it&s;elf plea&s;ing to God; therefore the &s;ufferings, the mi&s;ery, which he endured, could not be the price.&mdash;<HI>I have no plea&s;ure in the death of him that dieth, &s;aith the Lord God.</HI> Ezek. xviii. 23, 32. If God can have no plea&s;ure in the mi&s;ery and ju&s;t &s;ufferings of a &s;inful di&s;obedient creature, <HI>rea&s;on</HI> forbids the con|clu&s;ion, that he &s;hould have any plea&s;ure in the &s;uf|ferings of his dutiful well-beloved Son." P. 19.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="020214_0006_0FAE471723D13C38">
An&s;wer, He can have no plea&s;ure in the ruin and mi&s;ery of any creature, &s;imply con&s;idered; but all the puni&s;hments that ever came upon fallen angels, or fallen men, were for iniquity, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in; and if Chri&s;t did not &s;uffer for the &s;ins of men, ju&s;tice could not have been honored by his &s;uffer|ings, nor in &s;aving any &s;inner from hell. For <HI>by the deeds of the law, there &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight.&mdash;God hath &s;et forth Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be a propi|tiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his right|eou&s;ne&s;s for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins that are pa&s;t, through the forbearance of God&mdash;that he might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him who believeth in Je&s;us.</HI> Rom. iii. 20&mdash;26. We are warned again&s;t glorying in the wi&s;dom, might or riches of men; becau&s;e <HI>in the Lord &s;hall all the &s;eed of I&s;rael be ju&s;tified, and &s;hall glory.</HI> Jer. ix. 23, 24. I&s;aiah xlv. 22&mdash;25. From whence the apo&s;tle proved, that the preaching of <HI>Chri&s;t cru|cified,</HI> was unto the Jews a &s;tumbling block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s; but unto them who were called, both Jews and Greeks, Chri&s;t the power of God, and the wi&s;dom of God. 1 Cor. i. 23&mdash;31. And al&s;o that we &s;hould ever keep to the <HI>line of things made ready to our hand,</HI> and not have our <HI>minds cor|rupted from the &s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t, as the &s;er|pent beguiled Eve.</HI> The word <HI>line</HI> in this text, hath been applied to the lines which men have drawn around dioce&s;es and pari&s;hes, by teachers who have <HI>mea&s;ured them&s;elves by them&s;elves.</HI> 2 Cor. x. 12&mdash;17. xi. 3. And they have been &s;o much beguiled by the adver&s;ary, as to claim all the power for them|&s;elves and earthly rulers, that Abraham, Mo&s;es, Aaron and David ever had, over the bodies and &s;ouls of men. Yea, much more; for the whole of their power, was to command their children and their hou&s;ehold after them, <HI>to keep the way of the

But the old dragon hath ever been at war with the &s;eed of the true church, who <HI>keep the commandments of God, and have the te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> wherein the merits of his <HI>blood</HI> is the fir&s;t article. Rev. xii. 11, 17. He is e&s;tabli&s;hed as our prophet, prie&s;t and king, by the <HI>oath of God,</HI> in an <HI>order</HI> above Abraham, Mo&s;es, Aaron or David. Rom. xiv. 10&mdash;12. Heb. iii. 3. vii. 4&mdash;22. And the go&s;pel &s;ays, <HI>Loo&s;e thy&s;elf from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion; for thus &s;aith the Lord, Ye have &s;old your&s;elves for nought; and ye &s;hall be redeemed without money.&mdash;Thy God reigneth.&mdash;He made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, becau&s;e he had done no vio|lence, neither was any deceit in his mouth; yet it plea&s;ed the Lord to brui&s;e him, he hath put him to grief; when thou &s;halt make his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, he &s;hall &s;ee his &s;eed, he &s;hall prolong his days, and the plea&s;ure of the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per in his hand. He &s;hall &s;ee of the travel of his &s;oul, and &s;hall be &s;atisfied: by his know|ledge &s;hall my righteous &s;ervant ju&s;tify many; for he &s;hall bear their iniquities.</HI> And to believe this <HI>report</HI> with the <HI>heart,</HI> and to confe&s;s it with the <HI>mouth,</HI> is the only way of <HI>&s;alvation.</HI> I&s;ai. lii. 3, 7. liii. 1, 9&mdash;11. Rom. x. 4, 10, 15, 16. He &s;aid, <HI>They who hate me without a cau&s;e, are more than the hairs of mine head, then I re&s;tored that which I took not away.</HI> P&s;al. lxix. 4. John xv. 25. Yet it is now &s;aid,</P>
<P N="2">"2. If Chri&s;t appeared in the place of &s;inners, to ward off the &s;troke of vengeance, by giving it an opportunity to alight on him&mdash;the con&s;equence is unavoidable, that he in a <HI>very &s;hort &s;ea&s;on</HI> endured the &s;ame quantity of mi&s;ery which would have born &s;inners down to eternity. A thought which exceeds all rules of computation, and departs from all prin|ciples of ju&s;t rea&s;oning." P. 21.</P>

An&s;wer, Here is the root of all the evils in the world. Angels and men have erred, becau&s;e their knowledge was limited; and the only certain &s;ecu|rity again&s;t all error, is obedience to the revealed will of the <HI>Father of lights, with whom is no variablene&s;s, neither &s;hadow of turning.</HI> It is the only <HI>perfect law of liberty.</HI> James i. 16&mdash;25. Before our glorious <HI>Shepherd, all nations are as nothing, and they are counted to him le&s;s than nothing, and vanity.</HI> And he &s;ays, <HI>I lay down my life for the &s;heep;</HI> a cho&s;en number, and not for all mankind. I&s;aiah xi. 10, 11, 17. John x. 15, 26&mdash;29. And when he was going to do it, he &s;aid, <HI>If they do the&s;e things in the green tree, what &s;hall be done in the dry?</HI> Luke xxiii. 31. Nothing is more unrea&s;onable, than for us to imagine, that finite can comprehend infinite, or that debtors and crimi|nals are adequate judges of their own cau&s;es. Yet it is now &s;aid,</P>
<P N="3">"3. Tho&s;e animals made u&s;e of in ancient rites are never &s;aid to make atonement, but this is often acknowledged of the prie&s;ts who were active in the matter. Therefore, &s;o far as &s;ufferings were inflict|ed on Chri&s;t, and &s;o far as atonement con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>&s;uf|ferings,</HI> he can only be con&s;idered as the <HI>medium</HI> by which atonement was made, and not the per&s;on who made it. What Chri&s;t <HI>did,</HI> and not what was done to him, was the matter of atonement." P. 22, 23.</P>
<P>An&s;wer, Tho&s;e animals were innocent, while the prie&s;ts who offered them were guilty; and were daily to offer, fir&s;t for their own &s;ins, and then for the &s;ins of the people; therefore <HI>Je&s;us was Surety of a better te&s;tament. For if the blood of bulls, and of goats, and the a&s;hes of an heifer &s;prinkling the unclean, &s;anctifieth to the purifying of the fle&s;h, how much more &s;hall the blood of Chri&s;t, who through the eternal Spirit, offered him&s;elf without &s;pot to God, purge your con&s;cience from

If the &s;ins of the elect were not <HI>imputed</HI> to Chri&s;t as their <HI>Surety,</HI> he never could have made any atonement for them, nor they be &s;aved by him; yet our author &s;ays, "Some have &s;ecured them&s;elves under the vapory idea that Chri&s;t was by <HI>imputation</HI> &s;inful, and &s;u&s;taining this imputa|tive &s;inful character, he was the object of divine di&s;|plea&s;ure." P. 24. But he ought to know, that be|lievers do not hold that Chri&s;t was ever made a &s;in|ful per&s;on; or that the Father was ever angry with him; but that he <HI>made him to be &s;in for us, who knew no &s;in, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.</HI> 2 Cor. v. 21. When Aaron and his &s;ons put their hands upon the head of the bullock, and it was killed before the Lord, and its inwards were burnt upon the altar, and its body without the camp, for a <HI>&s;in-offering,</HI> the bullock was not made a <HI>&s;inner</HI> thereby; neither was Je&s;us, when he <HI>&s;uffered without the gate.</HI> Exod. xxix. 10&mdash;14. Heb. xiii. 11, 12. And though Aaron was to lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and to confe&s;s over him all the iniquities of the children of I&s;rael, and all their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions in all their &s;ins, putting them upon the head of the goat, which was to bear upon him all their iniquities, unto a land not inhabited, the goat was not made a &s;inner thereby, any more than Chri&s;t was, when <HI>the Lord laid on him the ini|quity of us all.</HI> Levi. xvi. 21, 22.

The plan of reconciliation left mankind in &s;uch a condition, as that they might be the objects of the ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure of God.&mdash;If it be only granted, that men have univer&s;ally rejected the <HI>offers</HI> of &s;alva|tion, and are criminal for &s;uch rejection, there can be no rea&s;onable objections again&s;t God's ju&s;tice, if all men &s;hould be excluded from that &s;alvation." It is al&s;o &s;aid, "The go&s;pel-offers &s;hould be <HI>as lim|ited</HI> as the premi&s;es from which they grow: for if the offers are more exten&s;ive than the provi&s;ion of|fered, there is an appearance <HI>at lea&s;t</HI> of &s;omething little better than deception." P. 22, 27.</P>
<P>An&s;wer, It is mo&s;t certain, that the ju&s;tice of God will ever &s;hine clear in the condemnation of man|kind, even in countries where they have not the writ|ten word. Rom. i. 18&mdash;21. And much more where they have it; but go&s;pel-offers, is the language of deceitful men, and not of the word of God; who &s;ent his Son to <HI>preach good tidings unto the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn.</HI> And when he made this proclamation, many wondered at his <HI>gracious words,</HI> until he let them know, that he had a good right to &s;ave whom he
<PB N="13" REF="020214_0013_0FAE471D61A8F568">plea&s;ed, even among the Sidonians or Syrians, and to leave many in I&s;rael to peri&s;h in their &s;ins; and then they were <HI>filled with wrath.</HI> I&s;aiah lxi. 1, 2. Luke iv. 17&mdash;29. And natural men di&s;cover the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition to this day. God never proclaimed atonement for <HI>pre&s;umptuous</HI> &s;inners; but &s;uch were to die without mercy, by the &s;entence of the prie&s;t and judge in I&s;rael; and of how much &s;orer puni&s;h|ment &s;hall he be thought worthy, who hath <HI>trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was &s;anctified, an unholy thing, and hath done de&s;pite unto the Spirit of grace!</HI> Num. xv. 30, 31. Deut. xvii. 1&mdash;12. Heb. x. 26&mdash;29. His per&s;on never could be trodden under foot by any; but his laws and authority are &s;o, to an amazing degree; and his <HI>blood,</HI> which <HI>purgeth believers from all &s;in,</HI> (1 John i. 7.) is now made u&s;e of to harden multitudes in iniquity, who would not dare to act as they do, if he had not died for &s;inners; and he only knows how many have done de&s;pite to the Spirit of grace. His grace hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodline&s;s, and worldly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world, looking for that ble&s;&s;ed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Titus ii. 11&mdash;14. His proclamation of <HI>grace</HI> ever contained fixed cha|racters, and a limited time. He &s;ays, <HI>Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of &s;alvation.</HI> And they who hold the contrary are <HI>unbelievers and idolators,</HI> with whom we ought not to be <HI>yoked.</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 1, 2, 14&mdash;18. The Son of God is infinitely above Mo&s;es; and the Holy Gho&s;t &s;aith, <HI>To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</HI> Heb. iii. 1&mdash;9. Yet the&s;e hearts are now appealed to, as our rule; and it is &s;aid, "Let no one be alarmed,
<PB N="14" REF="020214_0014_0FAE471E81D4B448">if we po&s;itively deny, that he &s;uffered any of that di|vine wrath which &s;inners ju&s;tly de&s;erve; for there can no &s;uch contradictory idea exi&s;t, that a being &s;hould be <HI>angry</HI> with an object with which he is at the &s;ame time <HI>well plea&s;ed."</HI> P. 33.</P>
<P>Here our &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions are &s;et up again&s;t the eter|nal truth of God, who a&s;&s;ures us, that he who &s;pareth his rod <HI>hateth</HI> his &s;on; but he that <HI>loveth</HI> him, cha&s;t|neth him betimes. Prov. xiii. 24. Hence hatred and love are directly oppo&s;ite to the carnal feelings of parents and children; and the conduct of the <HI>Son of God</HI> under &s;ufferings, ought to rai&s;e all our &s;ouls above the folly of <HI>babes.</HI> Prov. iii. 11, 12. Heb. v. 8&mdash;14. xii. 5&mdash;10. And to deny that God can do more than men, is infinitely wor&s;e than babes. Men readily admit of &s;ureties for debt, and for the faithful di&s;charge of promi&s;es and covenants; and when a &s;urety freely and fairly enters into bonds in &s;uch ca&s;es, ju&s;tice as clearly exacts the bonds of the &s;urety, as of the fir&s;t contractor. Neither can ju&s;tice be done to debtor or &s;urety, if the judge is <HI>angry</HI> with them, or hath any <HI>per&s;on in admiration becau&s;e of advantage.</HI> Men cannot ju&s;tly admit of a &s;urety in capital ca&s;es, becau&s;e they cannot rai&s;e the dead, nor change the heart of the living; but God can do both, and the whole plan of revelation, and of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is built upon this truth. Hence he &s;aid to the di&s;puters of that day, <HI>Ye do err, not knowing the &s;criptures, nor the power of God.</HI> Mat. xxii. 29. And this error was &s;o deeply rooted in the minds of his di&s;ciples, that one of them plainly &s;ays, <HI>As yet they knew not the &s;cripture, that he mu&s;t ri&s;e again from the dead.</HI> John xx. 9. And this point was di&s;puted in the church of Corinth, which made the apo&s;tle &s;ay, <HI>If Chri&s;t be not rai&s;ed, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your &s;ins.</HI> But he boldly &s;ays, <HI>Now is Chri&s;t ri&s;en
<PB N="15" REF="020214_0015_0FAE471FB8CCDCF0">from the dead, and become the fir&s;t-fruits of them that &s;lept. For &s;ince by man came death, by man came al&s;o the re&s;urrection of the dead: for as in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive.</HI> And the belief of this is openly declared by every per&s;on who is rightly <HI>baptized.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 20&mdash;23, 29.</P>
<P>As by union with Adam, our natural head, we all die, &s;o all believers will hereafter be rai&s;ed by their union with Chri&s;t, their &s;piritual head. It is by <HI>his voice</HI> that any &s;oul is now rai&s;ed to &s;piritual life; and by <HI>his voice</HI> all will hereafter be rai&s;ed from their <HI>graves; they that have done good, unto the re&s;urrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the re&s;ur|rection of damnation.</HI> And &s;ays he, <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. I receive not honor from men; but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</HI> John v. 25, 28, 29, 40&mdash;42. Yet the&s;e hearts, which have not the love of God in them, are now &s;et up as our rule, in&s;tead of his revealed will. And our author &s;ays, "Let what &s;cheme of atone|ment be invented that may, the whole weight of the arguments mu&s;t depend on one of three general prin|ciples, either that atonement was made for only a part of mankind, while the other part are excluded even from a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation by the plan; or, for all mankind, in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, that none can be lo&s;t and the divine de&s;ign be accompli&s;hed; or for all mankind, in the &s;en&s;e of a general principle upon which reconciliation may take place, and even mil|lions lo&s;t, and the de&s;ign be completely executed." P. 38.</P>
<P>Here all may &s;ee that the whole weight of his ar|guments turns upon <HI>invented</HI> &s;chemes, and not upon what God has revealed. And we may di&s;cover the following errors in his inventions.</P>
<P N="1">1. A want of di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt &s;in, the only
<PB N="16" REF="020214_0016_0FAE4720703CA200">object of God's anger, and the per&s;on who bears it. Of the be&s;t of his &s;aints it was truly &s;aid, <HI>Thou wa&s;t a God that forgave&s;t them, though thou tooke&s;t venge|ance of their inventions.</HI> P&s;alm xcix. 8. He <HI>par|doned</HI> many in the wilderne&s;s, who&s;e carca&s;es he doomed to fall therein, for their unbelief. Yea, Aaron and Mo&s;es mu&s;t openly know his di&s;plea&s;ure, <HI>becau&s;e they &s;anctified him not in the mid&s;t of the children of I&s;rael.</HI> Num. xiv. 11, 20, 21. Deut. xxxii. 51. David's &s;in of adultery and murder were put away; and yet God requited him with the &s;ame evils in his family. One &s;on defiled his daughter; another murdered him; and then drove his father from the throne, and lay with his wives in the &s;ight of the &s;un. 2 Sam. xii. 7&mdash;14. xiii. 14, 29. xvi. 22. And though Solomon built the temple, and was greatly owned by God therein; yet ten tribes were rent away from his &s;on, for his &s;in of &s;itting up the high places. And though immediate war betwixt the two kingdoms was prevented, yet it broke out after|wards; and half a million were &s;lain in one day; the greate&s;t &s;laughter that ever happened among mankind in any one day, &s;ince Adam fell. 2 Chron. xiii. 17, 18. How great then is God's anger again&s;t &s;in, even in his own people!</P>
<P N="2">2. Our author appears to be &s;trangely blinded, by the practice of taking the &s;hadows of the law, to draw a vail over the truth and glory of the go&s;pel. The word &s;in, is u&s;ed in the law for a &s;in-offering; from whence many have tried to prove, that the words <HI>&s;inned</HI> and <HI>&s;inners</HI> in the go&s;pel, mean <HI>&s;uffered</HI> and <HI>&s;uf|ferers.</HI> Rom. v. 12, 19. That is, they would prove from thence, that all mankind are &s;ufferers, before they are &s;inners. But as the wages of &s;in is death, none can hold that he pays tho&s;e wages where they are not due, without implicitly denying the ju&s;tice
<PB N="17" REF="020214_0017_0FAE47212F0D93F8">of God, in his government of the world. Our au|thor takes the &s;ame truth in the law, and &s;ays from thence concerning Chri&s;t, "For him to be made <HI>&s;in</HI> therefore, is for him to become a <HI>&s;acrifice,</HI> or an <HI>of|fering for &s;in."</HI> Yet, becau&s;e actions are &s;ometimes a&s;cribed to God, which are performed by the devil and his children, and God &s;aid, <HI>Thou &s;halt brui&s;e his heel,</HI> Remmele &s;ays, "Let no one then be alarmed, if we po&s;itively deny, that he &s;uffered any of that di|vine wrath which &s;inners <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> de&s;erve." P. 32, 33. Hence,</P>
<P N="3">3. He denies the e&s;&s;ence of atonement. The in|finite excellency of Chri&s;t's teaching and example, was &s;o far from making any atonement for &s;in, that it enhanced the guilt of tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;ed and re|jected him, above the guilt of the Sodomites, who <HI>&s;uffer the vengeance of eternal fire.</HI> Luke x. 12. Jude 7. Blood upon God's altar, offered by his prie&s;t, by fire from heaven, is the only thing which could make an atonement for the &s;oul, as we have before proved. And two &s;ons of Aaron were &s;truck dead, <HI>becau&s;e they offered &s;trange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not.</HI> Levi. ix. 15&mdash;24. x. 1&mdash;3. And how terrible mu&s;t it be for any to imagine, that Chri&s;t was &s;acrificed by the devil or his children, with fire from hell! Yet this is the natural effect of holding that the covenant of circumci&s;ion is the covenant of grace. For Abraham had no warrant to circumci&s;e any per&s;on, who was not born in his hou&s;e, until he had bought him as a <HI>&s;ervant</HI> with money. And &s;ince the death of Chri&s;t, by which he purcha&s;ed his peo|ple, the tongues of them who are for <HI>many ma&s;ters, defile the whole body, and &s;et on fire the whole cour&s;e of nature, and it is &s;et on fire of hell.</HI> The wi&s;dom of men who have bitter envying and &s;trife in their hearts, is <HI>earthly, &s;en&s;ual, devili&s;h. But the wi&s;dom
<PB N="18" REF="020214_0018_0FAE4721E433A788">that is from above, is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocri&s;y.</HI> James iii. 1, 6, 14&mdash;18. And the u&s;e of &s;ecular force to &s;up|port religious teachers, was always full of partiality and hypocri&s;y; and this appears by their own account of how it was fir&s;t introduced under the Chri&s;tian name.</P>
<P>The Holy Gho&s;t gave loud warnings to Chri&s;tians, again&s;t ob&s;erving days, months and years, in imita|tion of the &s;hadows under the law. Gal. iv. 9&mdash;11. And again&s;t being &s;poiled through philo&s;ophy and vain deceit, &s;o as to be &s;ubjected to ordinances, after the commandments and doctrines of men; which is will-wor&s;hip, and hath only a &s;hew of humility. Col. ii. 8, 19&mdash;23. But the my&s;tery of iniquity was car|ried &s;o far, in the &s;econd and third centuries, as to call religious teachers prie&s;ts, in di&s;tinction from other &s;aints; and at length to &s;et &s;ome teachers above the re&s;t, under the name of bi&s;hops, with an imagin|ation that they could make times, places and per&s;ons holy, by their decrees and admini&s;trations. This led on to the calling of wooden buildings churches, and bapti&s;m regeneration; as well as to the holding that office power in the church is derived by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from other officers, and not from the community as a body. In the mean time, heathen per&s;ecution was become very odious, and the doctrine of a crucified Saviour very honorable; therefore, in the beginning of the fourth century, by a pretended revelation from heaven, the <HI>cro&s;s</HI> was erected as a military &s;tandard, to gratify, and not to crucify the fle&s;h. And then each bi&s;hop was &s;et up as a <HI>high-prie&s;t,</HI> to whom Con&s;tantine wrote, and &s;aid, "You, and other bi&s;h|ops, prie&s;ts and deacons, ought to look unto the re|pairing of &s;uch <HI>churches</HI> as are under your govern|ment
<PB N="19" REF="020214_0019_0FAE4722A2007F90">and juri&s;diction; that tho&s;e which are yet &s;tanding, may be repaired and enlarged; or new built if occa&s;ion &s;o require. And both you, and others in your name, may <HI>will</HI> and require the ma|gi&s;trates and governors of provinces to furni&s;h you with materials nece&s;&s;ary to the building or repairing thereof; for we have &s;ignified unto them by our royal letters, that they &s;hall willingly and chearfully furni&s;h you with what&s;over <HI>your holine&s;s</HI> &s;hall think nece&s;&s;ary thereunto." This was his language to each bi&s;hop; and "He confirmed with his royal authority, the <HI>canons</HI> and determinations of the <HI>bi&s;h|ops,</HI> which they had decreed in their publick con|&s;i&s;tories, that &s;o the <HI>princes</HI> of other nations might not abrogate their <HI>decrees.</HI> For the judgments of the <HI>prie&s;thood</HI> in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, is to be pre|ferred before the opinion of a <HI>&s;ecular</HI> judge." And when he had gone on in this way until the thirtieth year of his reign, the hi&s;torian &s;aid, "His empire re&s;embleth the cele&s;tial empire, &s;o that lifting up his eyes to heaven, he governeth his &s;ubjects in this in|ferior empire, according to the pattern and form of the heavenly empire. For Law, which is the King of all, hath pre&s;cribed a Monarchy to be a govern|ment mo&s;t &s;uitable to prince and people; for a monarchy doth exceed all other kinds of common|wealths and manners of government; for that go|vernment is various which con&s;i&s;teth in an Ari&s;to|cracy, or government of men equal in riches and dignity; al&s;o a Democracy, or government of the people, which is oppo&s;ed to a Monarchy, is rather a &s;editious confu&s;ion than a government." Yet in all this time Con&s;tantine never &s;ubmitted to the <HI>yoke</HI> of Chri&s;t. But when he found his health to fail, in the &s;ixty-fifth year of his age, he &s;et off for the <HI>place</HI> where Je&s;us was baptized; but when he came to
<PB N="20" REF="020214_0020_0FAE472362ECF2D0">Nicomedia, he perceived that he &s;hould not reach there; and then he a&s;&s;embled a number of bi&s;hops, and &s;aid to them, "Brethren, the &s;alvation which I have earne&s;tly de&s;ired of God the&s;e many years, I do now this day expect; it is time therefore that we &s;hould be <HI>&s;ealed</HI> and &s;igned with the badge of im|mortality. And though I purpo&s;ed to receive it <HI>in</HI> the river Jordan, <HI>in</HI> which our Saviour, for our ex|ample, was baptized; yet God, knowing what is fitte&s;t for me, hath appointed that I &s;hall receive it in this place, therefore let me not be delayed. And if he in who&s;e power life and death are, will permit me to live any longer among&s;t you, and to join my prayers in the church, with the prayers of the con|gregation of God's people, I will live in &s;uch a re|gular manner, as may become a <HI>&s;ervant of God."</HI> After which, &s;ays the bi&s;hop, "The &s;ervice of bap|ti&s;m was read, and they baptized him with all the ceremonies belonging to this <HI>my&s;terious</HI> &s;acrament. So that Con&s;tantine was the fir&s;t of all the Emperors that was <HI>regenerated</HI> by the <HI>new birth</HI> of bapti&s;m, and that was &s;igned with the &s;ign of the <HI>cro&s;s,</HI> &s;o that his &s;pirit rejoiced, and being thus <HI>regenerated,</HI> his mind was illuminated, and by the raptures of faith &s;o tran&s;ported, that he admired in him&s;elf the wonder|ful <HI>work of God.</HI> After this &s;acred ceremony was performed, being clothed now in robes of light, in|&s;tead of his robes of regality, he went home, and re&s;ted upon his royal bed, putting off his royal robes, which he would not any more endure to touch.&mdash;Afterward he made his la&s;t will and te&s;tament, and hereby gave honorable annual pen&s;ions to the citi|zens of Rome. He left unto his children the inhe|ritance of his empire for their patrimony, and di&s;|po&s;ed of other matters in expre&s;s words as he thought convenient. The&s;e things were performed in the
<PB N="21" REF="020214_0021_0FAE4724692DC368">time of the holy fea&s;t of Penteco&s;t, beginning on the &s;eventh Sunday after E&s;ter, in a holy remembrance of the confirmation of the &s;criptures, by the a&s;cend|ing of Chri&s;t into heaven, and the de&s;cending of the Holy Gho&s;t upon men.

<P>This is the account of how <HI>a form of godline&s;s</HI> was then adopted as an engine of &s;tate-policy; given by a bi&s;hop who was very active therein, and who al&s;o wrote the hi&s;tory of the church, from the birth of Chri&s;t, unto the death of Con&s;tantine, with rai&s;ed expectations of glorious effects that would follow. But what were the effects? By removing the &s;eat of the Empire to Con&s;tantinople, and dividing it among his three &s;ons, Con&s;tantine prepared the way for its being rent and torn to pieces, and for the bi&s;hop of Rome to advance him&s;elf above all men upon earth, and above the God of heaven, who&s;e Son came into the world to <HI>bear witne&s;s unto the truth, and to de&s;troy the works of the devil,</HI> which are <HI>lying and murder.</HI> John viii. 44. xviii. 36, 37. 1 John iii. 7&mdash;14. And the&s;e evils were carried &s;o far, before England was &s;ubjected to the Pope of Rome, that becau&s;e the fir&s;t archbi&s;hop of Canterbury could not effect it by

<P>America had been di&s;covered forty years before, and it was granted to the crown of Spain, by the Pope of Rome.

<P>Ten years after, tho&s;e Independents came over and planted New-England; where their foundation principles now loudly call for the attention of their po&s;terity, without which our INDEPENDENCE can never be maintained. For if we believe not, yet God abideth faithful; he cannot deny him&s;elf. 2 Tim. ii. 13. And not to condemn our&s;elves in the things which we allow, is the only way of happine&s;s. Rom. xiv. 22. Every man who violates the univer&s;al rule of equity, exalteth him&s;elf above the eternal God, who never could do any &s;uch thing, and never will let the violation of it e&s;cape without puni&s;hment in any one in&s;tance. It is therefore impo&s;&s;ible that &s;in can ever e&s;cape without puni&s;hment, either in the guilty per&s;on, or in his Surety. And we may now &s;ee that <HI>reviling</HI> and <HI>lying</HI> is the mo&s;t dangerous <HI>per|&s;ecution</HI> in the world, as it hath ob&s;cured <HI>the light</HI> more than corporal tortures ever did. Mat. v. 10&mdash;16. <HI>Natural men</HI> have always <HI>per&s;ecuted</HI> tho&s;e who were

Fir&s;t, becau&s;e their <HI>pride</HI> was again&s;t allowing that others knew more than them&s;elves; therefore they <HI>&s;pake evil of tho&s;e things which they knew not.</HI> Jude 10. Secondly, becau&s;e the light of holine&s;s is directly again&s;t <HI>covet|eou&s;ne&s;s</HI> which is <HI>idolatry;</HI> and the command of God is, <HI>Be not ye partakers with them.</HI> Eph. v. 1&mdash;7, 11. Thirdly, becau&s;e it is al&s;o again&s;t <HI>luxury,</HI> even the walking <HI>in la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, lu&s;ts, exce&s;s of wine, revel|lings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries;</HI> again&s;t which the go&s;pel <HI>arms the minds</HI> of the &s;aints. But &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>They think it &s;trange that you run not with them to the &s;ame exce&s;s of riot, &s;peaking evil of you.</HI> 1 Peter iv. 1&mdash;4. Paul &s;ays, <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon me&mdash;le&s;t that by any means when I have preached to others, I my&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t-away.</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 16&mdash;27. He al&s;o &s;ays, <HI>The end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good con&s;cience, and of faith unfeigned.</HI> Faith in Chri&s;t, who &s;aves the <HI>chief of &s;inners,</HI> who had &s;inned <HI>ignorantly,</HI> and not <HI>pre&s;umptuou&s;ly.</HI> But &s;ome had <HI>put away a good con&s;cience,</HI> and concerning faith had made <HI>&s;hipwrack.</HI> 1 Tim. i. 5, 13&mdash;16, 19. They were <HI>pre&s;umptuous</HI> and <HI>&s;elf-willed,</HI> under the name of <HI>liberty.</HI> 2 Pet. ii. 10, 19. Saints who <HI>&s;hine as lights in the world</HI> ex|po&s;e the <HI>crooked ways of a perver&s;e nation.</HI> Phil. ii. 15. God's <HI>two witne&s;&s;es</HI> have therefore <HI>tormented them that dwelt on the earth.</HI> Men who have acted as <HI>lords over God's heritage</HI> are of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and they &s;hall <HI>tread the holy city under foot forty and two months;</HI> and the la&s;t article of their victory appears to be the <HI>temple of God, and the altar.</HI> Rev. xi. 1&mdash;10. Mark x. 42. The world have long trampled upon the government which Chri&s;t appointed in his church; and when the merits of his blood are rejected, what have we more?</P>

The Hebrew and Chri&s;tian churches are his two candle&s;ticks, into which he poured the oil of his grace, by his law and his go&s;pel, the two olive-trees; the one revealing duty plainly, the other how it is performed acceptably, in his <HI>kingdom which cannot be moved.</HI> And every thing which can be &s;haken, is evidently now &s;haking, that <HI>the de&s;ire of all nations may come, and his hou&s;e be filled with glory.</HI> Hag. ii. 6&mdash;9. Zech. iv. 2&mdash;12. Heb. xii. 18&mdash;29. Safety and happine&s;s is the de&s;ire of all nations; and this will be gloriou&s;ly enjoyed when the witne&s;&s;es &s;hall be rai&s;ed above all earthly powers, <HI>and the kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was &s;een in his temple the ark of his te&s;tament.</HI> Rev. xi. 11&mdash;19. The fir&s;t tables of the law were broken by man, but the &s;econd tables were kept whole in the ark; and the mercy-&s;eat was above upon it, ju&s;t as long and ju&s;t as broad as the ark. Over it was the cloud of glory, and none but the high-prie&s;t might go into the holy place where it was, and that but once a year, with the holy garments on, to &s;prinkle blood upon it, and to offer incen&s;e, by fire which came from heaven, and was kept alive upon the altar for burnt-offerings. And the people were to <HI>afflict their &s;ouls</HI> without, while the prie&s;t made atonement within. Levi. xvi. 13, 14, 24, 29, 34. After the Babylonian captivity, the Jews la|mented the want of the ark, the cloud of glory, the holy garments, and the fire from heaven; but Chri&s;t hath them all to perfection, and we are mo&s;t &s;olemnly called to <HI>go on unto perfection.</HI> And nothing hath done more to ob&s;truct it, than the imagination, that an <HI>external &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bapti&s;m, and laying on of hands,</HI> is e&s;&s;ential to any true church power in this world. Heb. vi. 1&mdash;6. Aaron and his &s;ons were <HI>wa&s;hed</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="020214_0026_0FAE472BAC5DCDA8">before their holy garments were put upon them, and then they <HI>laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the &s;in-offering.</HI> Levi. viii. 6&mdash;8, 14. And per|&s;ons who were unclean, were to be &s;prinkled with the a&s;hes of a burnt heifer, and then each one was to <HI>wa&s;h his clothes, and bathe him&s;elf in water, and &s;o be clean.</HI> Num. xix. 19. Which divers <HI>bapti&s;ms</HI> were a figure of what Chri&s;t hath done to purge our con&s;cience from dead works to &s;erve the living God. He is <HI>light,</HI> and he <HI>is love;</HI> and <HI>if we &s;ay we have no &s;in, we deceive our&s;elves, and the truth is not in us. If we confe&s;s our &s;ins, he is faithful and ju&s;t to forgive us our &s;ins, and to clean&s;e us from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s. This is he that came by water and blood.</HI> 1 John i. 5&mdash;10. iv. 8. v. 6. And as God is light and love, every rational &s;oul is under indi&s;pen&s;able obligation to be|lieve all his revealed will, and to obey all his com|mandments.</P>
<P>All the light that ever was enjoyed by fallen men, came from the <HI>Lamb of God, who taketh away the &s;in of the world.</HI> But <HI>every one that doth evil hateth the light;</HI> and <HI>this is the condemnation. They hate him without a cau&s;e.</HI> And he &s;ays the Spirit reprov|eth <HI>of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not on me.</HI> John i. 9, 29. iii. 14&mdash;21. xv. 25. xvi. 9. He was <HI>within</HI> the Jewi&s;h church, when he warned them again&s;t looking any where el&s;e for his kingdom. Luke xvii. 21. But he is now at the right hand of the Father, making his people willing in the day of his power, to &s;erve him in the beauties of holine&s;s. And he will yet &s;trike through Kings in the day of his wrath, and wound the heads over many countries. P&s;alm cx. 1&mdash;3, 5, 6. Rev. xix. 11&mdash;21. But many have been in &s;uch blindne&s;s, as to bring the&s;e &s;criptures to prove that God had &s;et up a <HI>light within them,</HI> above his written word. Well therefore did he &s;ay,

Had it not been for &s;uch darkne&s;s, men would not have told of God's <HI>exclud|ing</HI> any from his free &s;alvation; nor of his <HI>de&s;igning</HI> atonement for any who are finally lo&s;t. No, nor of any want of &s;incerity, in his proclaiming free grace to all, becau&s;e he did not de&s;ign to exert the <HI>ex|ceeding greatne&s;s of his power,</HI> to bring all to <HI>believe</HI> therein. Eph. i. 19. Neither would men have de|nied the plain truth of God, who &s;ays, <HI>As by one man's di&s;obedience, many were made &s;inners, &s;o by the obedience of one, &s;hall many be made righteous.</HI> The one by a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> &s;entence of law; the other by a free <HI>gift</HI> of grace. The fir&s;t man, by one offence ruined all his race; the &s;econd man, delivers from <HI>many offences unto the ju&s;tification of life.</HI> Rom. v. 12&mdash;19. The &s;in which we derive from Adam, is loving the creature more than the Creator, or loving of plea&s;ures more than God. Rom. i. 25. 2 Tim. iii. 1&mdash;5. This is to be <HI>dead while we live.</HI> 1 Tim. v. 6. Eph. ii. 1, 2. Hence to be <HI>taught of God,</HI> is the only way wherein any <HI>can come</HI> to Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and <HI>every man</HI> who hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto him. John vi 44, 45. The excellency which this know|ledge brings them, is, gladly to quit all confidence in the fle&s;h, and to place their tru&s;t and affections upon things above, where God is, and Chri&s;t at his right hand.</P>
