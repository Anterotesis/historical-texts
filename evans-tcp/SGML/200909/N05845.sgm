<P>WHEN we con&s;ider, that &s;oon after the Begin|ning, the eternal Father, having brought forth this whole Creation of his, &s;at on a Throne, glorious, exalted and lifted up on high, &s;ur|rounded by Ho&s;ts of exulting Angels (tho&s;e Morning Stars that &s;ang together, tho&s;e Sons of God that &s;houted for Joy) viewing every Thing he had made, pronouncing it all, <HI>very good;</HI> and we do then reflect on the pre&s;ent Situation of Affairs among Mortals, we mu&s;t condole the Fate of our Globe, as being changed from a Garden of God, an Eden, a Paradi&s;e of Holine&s;s, Joy and Fe|licity, into a Haunt of impure Spirits, a Scene of Sin, Horror, Woe and Di&s;appointment, a Lazar-hou&s;e of Angui&s;h and Torture, infe&s;ted with Wars and Rumors of Wars, Famines, Earthquakes, Inundations, Confla|grations, Di&s;ea&s;es, Pe&s;tilences, Deaths. And, notwith|&s;tanding this Reflection, gloomy as it is, we would be very fooli&s;h indeed, if we thought the infinitely wi&s;e, and great JEHOVAH, to whom all his Works are known from Eternity, had been fru&s;trated in his Scheme, he concerted to demon&s;trate the Glory of his eternal Power and Deity;&mdash;he who calleth the Things that are not, as if they were, can bring forth Light out of Darkne&s;s, and

Life out of Death;&mdash;he is both wi&s;e and able, by his ab&s;olute and irre&s;i&s;table Providence, &s;o to over-rule the greate&s;t Evils, that they &s;erve the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t glorious Purpo&s;es.&mdash;Had there been no Fall, no Need had there been of a Redeemer; nor &s;hould the Saints in Glory ever have had Rea&s;on to adore the Love, Mercy, and free Grace of God, which &s;aved them from &s;o great Damna|tion, as the Ve&s;&s;els of his Wrath and Indignation, &s;hall &s;uffer in the horrid Aby&s;s, burning with Fire and Sul|pher uncon&s;umed, prepared for the Devil and his apo&s;|tate Crew. It is indeed an awful Reflection, that this our Globe &s;hall, in the la&s;t Conflagration, be all in a Blaze of Fire; but that it will &s;erve to purify and renew it, makes more than ample Amends.&mdash;And do we animad|vert upon the Calamities and Tribulations that befall a &s;inful World, we &s;hall &s;oon perceive that they &s;erve wi&s;e Purpo&s;es, <HI>to wit,</HI> that Sinners may learn Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and that Saints by their Patience and Re&s;ignation to the eternal Decree of Heaven, by their Courage and godly Heroi&s;m, may glorify the heavenly Father, when they fight the Battles of the Lord Sebaoth.</P>
<P>Therefore our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with &s;o much Calmne&s;s and Compo&s;ure of Mind, fore-tells his Di&s;ciples, what great Changes &s;hould happen on the Earth, before the End of the World come&mdash;The Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;hould be de&s;troyed, that not one Stone be left upon the other, <HI>Judea</HI> laid wa&s;te and de|&s;olate, and the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> State aboli&s;hed.&mdash;As they were nearly concerned in this (and the human Mind is always inqui&s;itive) they came privately unto him, and &s;aid, Tell us, Lord, when &s;hall the&s;e Things be? And what &s;hall be the Sign of thy coming, and of the End of the World?&mdash;Je&s;us cautions them again&s;t the Delu&s;ions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Impo&s;tors, who &s;hould come in his Name, and dece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> many, by high Prote&s;tations and marvalous Predictio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>

he reveals unto them the Fate of the World, before the great and tremendous Day of Conflagration, and Con|&s;ummation of all Things come; <HI>to wit,</HI> that there &s;hall be terrible Calamities and doleful Tribulations on Earth, occa&s;ioned by Wars, Famines, Pe&s;tilences, Earthquakes, Per&s;ecutions and Impo&s;tures.&mdash;Again&s;t all which Je&s;us exhorts them to &s;tand, not only with manly Re&s;olution and Courage, but al&s;o with godly Heroi&s;m and Magna|nimity of Soul, &s;aying, Ye &s;hall hear of Wars, and Rumors of Wars: See that ye be not troubled; for all the&s;e Things mu&s;t come to pa&s;s, but the End is not yet.</P>
<P>So that the Words of my Text contain a Prediction of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, wherein he foretells his Di&s;ciples, that it &s;hould be the Fate of the World to be mole&s;ted with Wars and Rumors of Wars, at the &s;ame Time commanding and charging them not to be troubled thereat, but to have good Courage, and to be in&s;pired with godly Heroi&s;m and divine Magnanimity, from a Con&s;ideration that the&s;e Things were ordained and de|creed &s;o to be, and &s;o to happen, before the End of the World come.</P>
<P>If ever any Words were appo&s;ite to an Occa&s;ion, the&s;e are &s;o to our pre&s;ent Situation, while we not only hear of Wars and Rumors of Wars, at a Di&s;tance, but are upon an Expedition, to remove the Encroachments our antichri&s;tian Neighbours, who al&s;o are our great Enemies, have made on our Borders: For which End this Army, in the Mid&s;t of which I &s;tand, is rai&s;ed, and now &s;oon to go forth to meet their Adver&s;aries in an awful In&s;tant, in a critical Conjuncture, and in a portentous Interval, that mu&s;t determine our great Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>I do then bend my Knees; I lift up my Eyes to the open Canopy of Heaven; I &s;pread out my Hands unto the Lord, my God, and pray from the Bottom of my Heart; give Eear, O Shepherd of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> thou that leade&s;t <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> like a Flock, thou that dwelle&s;t between the Cherubim, &s;hine forth before <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Benjamin,</HI>

<P>In order that I may lay open and unfold the Pre|diction of the Lord, I &s;hall &s;tand up and &s;peak, as the Lord plea&s;eth to grant me Utterance (and O Lord, do thou enlighten me by thy holy Spirit, &s;trengthen and &s;upport me by thy omnipotent Hand. Let one of the cele&s;tial Seraphims come with a live Coal from thy Altar, and touch my Heart and my Mouth, that I may &s;peak as it becometh me to &s;peak) of the&s;e three great Things.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That it is the Fate of the World, to be mole&s;ted by Wars and Rumors of Wars.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the People of God mu&s;t &s;ee to it, that they be not troubled thereat; but be in&s;pired with good Courage and godly Heroi&s;m.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the&s;e Things are ordained and decreed, &s;o to be, and &s;o to happen, before the End of the World cometh.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t; we mu&s;t remark, that he who here &s;peaketh, is our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, who &s;peaketh not as Men &s;peak, often by meer Conjecture, or from external Ap|pearances of Things, but with divine Infallibility, and never-erring Authority. All Things, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come, are known to him: And it is his Province to reveal unto his Prophets and Saints, what&s;oever he &s;ees fit they &s;hould know. Wherefore he doth here lay open and unfold to his Di&s;ciples, the Fate and Lot of the World in general, and that of <HI>Judea</HI> in particular; which is, that they &s;hould <HI>hear of Wars and Rumors of Wars:</HI> Wars pre&s;ent, and Wars at a di&s;tance, but in Pro&s;pect; a Succe&s;&s;ion of Wars and Rumors of Wars: Scarce was the one pa&s;t, but the other was near at Hand, even at the Doors.&mdash;And it hath Weight with me, that to Wars, here are added Rumors of Wars: Becau&s;e it

is with Wars, as with other temporary Evils we fear and dread, that the Pro&s;pect of them oftentimes is more terrible and more alarming, than the Experience of the very Thing it&s;elf; though not always, but &s;ometimes the rever&s;e&mdash;We have at pre&s;ent no more than Rumors of Wars, and it hath put us to &s;uch Preparation (which it ought to do) to &s;uch Expences, to &s;uch Labour and Toil, that we wi&s;h for War it&s;elf; nay, we conceive, if War in Fact do not come, the Rumors of War we have had, would pre&s;s very heavily upon us&mdash;And be felt throughout our whole Land a long Time.</P>
<P>Do we endeavour to trace the fir&s;t Origin of Wars, we may find that they de&s;cend from a grand Battle that was fought in Heaven, when Satan threw of his Alle|giance from the eternal Father, and with his Apo&s;tates waged War again&s;t <HI>Michael</HI> and his Angels&mdash;Satan lo&s;t the Battle (for how &s;hould he &s;tand again&s;t the Almighty?) And was doom'd to the infernal Aby&s;s, there to &s;uffer with his apo&s;tate Crew, the everla&s;ting Condemnation of Hell-fire, as Saint <HI>Jude</HI> &s;aith in his Epi&s;tle, and the Angels which kept not their fir&s;t E&s;tate, but left their own Habitation, he hath re&s;erved in everla&s;ting Chains under Darkne&s;s, unto the Judgment of the great Day&mdash; Satan notwith&s;tanding, by the Sufferance of Heaven, found Means to come upon this earthly Globe; on which Man was created, good and upright, after the Image and Likene&s;s of his great Maker, whom the arch Enemy of God and Man beguiled, deceived and perverted, to fall off from his Creator, and to enter into Allegiance with him&mdash;And hence &s;pring Wars and Rumors of Wars on Earth.&mdash;</P>
