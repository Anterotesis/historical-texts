<P>ALL MEN ARE EQUAL.</P>
<P>"SOHO! What the plague have we got here now? All men equal! All men equal!!! Here's a pretty love powder for us truly&mdash;An arrant do&s;e of Jacobini&s;m I'll warrant it, &s;ufficient to poi&s;on the nation."</P>
<P>This is ju&s;t what I apprehended; for &s;ome gentlemen, the moment they hear mention of EQUALITY, fancy they &s;ee a ho&s;t of hungry &s;ans-culottes in full march for de&s;olation, equalling all property, levelling all di&s;tincti|ons, knocking down kings, clapping up beggers, and waving the tri-coloured flag of anarchy, confu&s;ion and wretchedne&s;s, over the ruins of happine&s;s and order.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="036696_0004_100A6B93982D0E70">
From &s;uch equality, good Lord, deliver us! But the equality now in que&s;tion is as different from that, as is a &s;pirit of heaven from a goblin damn'd. 'Tis an equali|ty of mutual dependence, of civil obligation, of &s;ocial affection, of dutiful obedience to the laws, and of har|monious co-exertion to make our&s;elves and our country happy.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay that all men are equal, I allude not to the endowments of mind or body. For, whether we con&s;ider the &s;ize, &s;trength and activity of the former, or, the wit, memory and other faculties of the latter&mdash;there is cer|tainly a &s;urpri&s;ing inequality among men.</P>
<P>As to SIZE&mdash;</P>
<P>Some are dwarfs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of dwarfs there have been numbers; but Baby, the little Frenchman, born in <HI>1741,</HI> is the mo&s;t remarkable. At his birth he weighed but a pound and a quarter, and was for &s;ome time rocked in a large &s;lipper by way of cradle. When full grown he was ju&s;t <HI>29</HI> inches tall, healthy, hand|&s;ome and well proportioned. At <HI>22</HI> he died of old age.</NOTE> mere pigmies, hardly a match for cranes&mdash;while others, the giant<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As to giants, both Ireland and Patagonia have pro|duced a great many, <HI>7, 8.</HI> and <HI>9</HI> feet high: but Goliah of Gath out-gianted all the&s;e by far; for he mea&s;ured up|wards of <HI>11</HI> feet &s;traight rabbet.</NOTE> &s;ons of earth, lift their mighty forms, terrible to look on.</P>
<P>As to STRENGTH&mdash;</P>
<P>Some are &s;o very feeble, that the weight of a gra&s;s|hopper is burthen&s;ome&mdash;while others, like Samp&s;on, among the Hebrews, or Peter Franci&s;co<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This extraordinary man, a native Virginian, has been known to lift a cannon of <HI>1500</HI> weight, and to throw a &s;tout bully over the pales of a garden with great ea&s;e.&mdash; He was at the famous battle of the Eutaw &s;prings, where the gallant Williams, who led the ho&s;t of Columbia, being knocked down, the Briti&s;h grenadiers endeavored to di&s;|patch him on the ground. The Americans defended him with great bravery, and dreadful was the cla&s;hing of the bayonets over our pro&s;trate hero. He was &s;oon covered with the dead bodies of the combatants falling on him; Peter, being an officer, had no better weapon than a hea|vy cutla&s;s, with which however, he got a blow a piece at four grenadiers. Every blow was ready money to old Charon.</NOTE> among our|&s;elves, po&s;&s;e&s;s a degree of bodily force that is truly a&s;ton|i&s;hing.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="036696_0005_100A37609879E650">
As to ACTIVITY&mdash;</P>
<P>Some men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For example&mdash;Col. Daniel Boon, the &s;ettler of Ken|tucky, who in his flight from the Indians, ran upwards of <HI>150</HI> miles in <HI>36</HI> hours.</NOTE> &s;wift footed as the roe-buck, can bound acro&s;s the fields with the motion of the winds, &s;carcely injuring the tender gra&s;s in their rapid cour&s;e; while others &s;nail &s;low in progre&s;s, can &s;carcely drag their tor|pid limbs along.</P>
<P>As to HEALTH&mdash;</P>
<P>Some ble&s;t with con&s;titutions of &s;teel, hardly know what &s;ickne&s;s means, as was the ca&s;e of a Mrs. Blackney, an Engli&s;h lady, who on her death bed declared, that during a life of 80 years, &s;he had never felt even a pain of the head&mdash;while others enervated by &s;loth and &s;trong tea, can &s;eldom get through a whole day without mak|ing dreadful complaints.</P>
<P>And, as to LONG LIFE&mdash;</P>
<P>Millions return to the du&s;t almo&s;t as &s;oon as they are awakened out of it; while others, like &s;uperanuated &s;trulbrugs live 'till they are quite tired of living. Wit|ne&s;s, Thomas Parr, an old Engli&s;h ploughman, who lived to &s;ee ten kings and queens ri&s;e and fall from the throne of England. Such bubbles are kings, compared to cheerful labourers! He died aged 153 years. Old Henry Jenkings, (of Bolton England,) went a good vay beyond Parr, for he lived 169 years. Both of the&s;e ve|terans were hone&s;t, temperate, hard working, poor men.</P>
<P>As to BEAUTY&mdash;</P>
<P>Some have &s;o much of heaven in their looks, that a &s;ingle glance is enough to electrify with delight every nerve in our frames, and to throw our leaping hearts into the &s;weete&s;t palpitation; while others are &s;o &s;lightly
<PB N="8" REF="036696_0006_100A6B958204EFF0">touched with this divine magneti&s;m that they attract none of our iron race, but are at full liberty to point to|wards heaven and make angels their admirers.</P>
<LG>
<L>"E'en cro&s;&s;es from our Maker's hand,</L>
<L>"Are ble&s;&s;ings in di&s;gui&s;e."</L>
</LG>
<P>Equally great is the difference between different per|&s;ons, in the powers and qualities of their minds.</P>
<P>As to COURAGE&mdash;</P>
<P>Some, like the war-hor&s;e, rejoice, at the &s;ound of the trumpet and plunge with eagerne&s;s into the thicke&s;t bat|tle, declaring with the mad-cap king of Sweden, that no mu&s;ic equals the whi&s;tling of bullets; while others like delicate court-ladies fall into a tremor at the fight of an unloaded gun.</P>
<P>As to UNDERSTANDING&mdash;</P>
<P>Some are &s;o very dull that it is a hard matter to teach them a &s;um in the rule of three; while others quickly drink dry the &s;hallow fountains of human knowledge, and then boldly &s;trike out into the main ocean of the Al|mighty's works. Witne&s;s our great RITTENHOUSE, of whom it' was well &s;aid by the Vice-Pre&s;ident of the United States, that, "though he never made a world, yet he came nearer to it than any man ever did."</P>
<P>And witne&s;s too our &s;age FRANKLIN, who, though bro't up a poor Printer's boy, &s;oon learnt the art to chain the thunderbolts of heaven and to bid fierce lightnings play harmle&s;sly about our buildings. "E coelo ful|mina eripuit, &s;ceptraque tyrannis."</P>
<P>AS to ELOQUENCE&mdash;</P>
<P>Some, like our famou~s PATRICK HENRY, can lead the pa&s;&s;ions of men about, with as much ea&s;e as a countryman calls his pigs after him; while another hardly has utterance &s;ufficient to declare his pa&s;&s;ion to a pretty milk-maid.</P>
<P>As to HUMANITY&mdash;</P>
<P>One is &s;o tender hearted, that like the amiable Dr. GOLDSMITH, he can &s;ay to a little captive fly, "go poor thing, there is &s;urely room enough in this great world for you and me;" while another can pickle the raw hide of a poor &s;lave, for breaking a tea-cup.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="036696_0007_100A6B978C401FA8">
As to BENEVOLENCE&mdash;</P>
<P>This, like the man of ROSS, will &s;ell his elegant pictures and plate, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed tenant; while that, will di&s;tre&s;s his tenant, &s;elling even the bed from under his &s;ick wife and children, to rai&s;e money for gawdy pictures and plate.</P>
<P>Thus there appears a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing inequality between men, both in mind and body; an inequality almo&s;t as great as that between angels and men, or between men and children. This inequality is &s;o very &s;triking, that &s;ome, when told, that all men are equal, bur&s;t out into a hearty laugh, treating it as a &s;illy French conceit.&mdash; Such gentlemen will perhaps keep up the laugh when they hear that this inequality among men, as individuals, is the very cau&s;e of their equality as a &s;ocial body.&mdash; That great philo&s;opher, Paul of Tar&s;us, has explained this &s;eeming paradox in a mo&s;t beautiful and ma&s;terly manner. He compares the various members in the body of &s;ociety to the members in the human body.&mdash; "We have all, &s;ays he, many members in one body; &s;ome of the&s;e occupy a high place, as the head; &s;ome a low, as the feet; &s;ome appear to enjoy great honor; the eye which &s;ees beautiful objects, the ear which hears &s;weet &s;ounds: while others, the poor feet, are obliged to plod on the ground liable to be brui&s;ed by &s;tones or defiled by mud." But notwith&s;tanding this apparently great inequality among the members, they have no ju&s;t cau&s;e of pride or di&s;content. The foot has no rea&s;on to envy the eye, nor the eye to in&s;ult the foot. They are all equally dependent on one another, equally nece&s;|&s;ary to the perfection of the body, and to each others welfare. For, what could the eyes do without the feet? Or how could the feet do without the eyes? With the like admirable wi&s;dom, God has placed together the members which compo&s;e the great body of &s;ociety.&mdash; Some are rich, &s;ome poor, &s;ome wife, &s;ome ignorant, &s;ome &s;trong, &s;ome feeble. The&s;e though &s;eemingly very unequal, are yet perfectly equal, in their mutual depend|ence, in their ab&s;olute need of one another. The wife are like eyes, to &s;ee, for the ignorant; the poor, like the feet, to plod; &s;ome, like the head, to contrive;
<PB N="10" REF="036696_0008_100A6B9934EE6A40">others, like the arms, to execute. Some were made to direct; others to obey; the&s;e to labour with their head, and tho&s;e with their hands. None of the&s;e can do with|out the re&s;t. As in the body, the head cannot &s;ay to the foot, "I have no need of you"; &s;o in &s;ociety, the riche&s;t man, nay, the greate&s;t king cannot &s;ay to the poore&s;t tradesman, "I have no need of you"; for the laced coat that glitters on his back, the &s;word which graces his &s;ide, the chariot in which he rolls, the palace wherein he lives, the books that amu&s;e his mind, the mu&s;ic that enchants his ear; all the&s;e, and the ten thou|&s;and other conveniences and elegancies of his life are the joint production of as many different artificers. Were it not for the&s;e ingenious poor men, what would become of the greate&s;t monarch on earth? Why, he would &s;oon find him&s;elf a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;itous and wretched being. To be more &s;en&s;ibly convinced of this, let us &s;uppo&s;e the proude&s;t Nebuchadnezzar that ever &s;coffed contempt on his poor &s;ubjects, to be placed in a &s;ituation where he could derive no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them, and mark the fi|gure his haughty king&s;hip makes. "With a flint to|mahawk he hacks down a dozen or two of &s;applings; the&s;e he &s;ets up on end, ties at the top, and covers with bark and mud, leaving a hole ju&s;t big enough for him|&s;elf and his dog to creep in and out at. This is his wigwam, his ca&s;tle, his palace. In the mid&s;t of this he kindles up a fire, around which he yawns and dozes away his gloomy winters. With no cloaths but &s;kins torn from the quivering limbs of Wolves and Bears, no food but acorns and the carca&s;es of &s;uch animals as he has ma&s;tered by his club and bow; no mu&s;ic but hi&s;&s;ing &s;erpents, &s;creaming wild cats, or the &s;torm howling thro' the fore&s;t."</P>
<P>Thus de&s;titute is the condition, thus imperfect the happine&s;s of the man who has none to help him. His abilities, though the greate&s;t ever be&s;towed on man, are infinitely in&s;ufficient to procure tho&s;e innuinerable feli|cities of which his kind Creator has rendered him capa|ble. His body embraces a number of &s;en&s;es &s;uch as &s;ee|ing, hearing, ta&s;ting, &amp;c. which are &s;o many plea&s;ant inlets to a va&s;t variety of gratifications; add to this,
<PB N="11" REF="036696_0009_100A6B9B6091D078">his mind, with its capacities, for all the far &s;ublimer plea&s;ures of knowledge, virtue, beauty, painting, poe|try, harmony, &amp;c. &s;o numerous, that nature her&s;elf with all her exhau&s;tle&s;s trea&s;ures can hardly &s;upply them.</P>
<P>But how utterly impo&s;&s;ible it is for an individual to acquire all the&s;e things for him&s;elf, mu&s;t in&s;tantly occur to any one who con&s;iders what a world of indu&s;try, time and ingenuity it takes to invent and carry to perfection a &s;ingle art or &s;cience: then how pa&s;&s;ing ab&s;urd to think that any one man though armed with the &s;trength of Samp&s;on and the wi&s;dom of Solomon, can manage the thou&s;and arts and &s;ciences which exalt the citizen above the &s;avage, which &s;weeten and embelli&s;h life, and which from the mo&s;t helple&s;s of the animal creation render man the lord of the world! No: this is the work, not of ONE, but of MYRIADS; a work to be effected by men not as &s;olitary, &s;cattered individuals, but as the members of a compact all powerful &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Let us now view them in their a&s;&s;ociated &s;tate. Con|vinced of their extreme feeblene&s;s while alone, they come together for mutual &s;afety and benefit. The va|rious talents which God has di&s;tributed among them individually, are now brought into the common &s;tock and exerted for the general good. Some contribute great bodily &s;trength, others increa&s;e that &s;trength by the aid of art and ingenious inventions: the old coun&s;el the young, the wi&s;e teach the ignorant, the bold encour|age the timid; and as fifty thou&s;and men, taken indi|vidually, have but little &s;trength or terror, but con&s;oli|dated into an army, furni&s;hed with proper weapons aid|ed by di&s;cipline, and led on by brave commanders, they become un&s;peakably formidable. So, when the talents and &s;trength of thou&s;ands (though in&s;ignificant in the individual) are collected into one great &s;ocial body, aid|ed by arts and acting in harmonious concert, they ac|quire a force that is truly a&s;toni&s;hing, and can with ea&s;e accompli&s;h things beyond the reach of imagination. See them now, like a noble band of brothers, bending to the glorious toil. The deepe&s;t mines cannot conceal their precious metals. Furnaces and forges begin to blaze and thunder. Iron and &s;teel are fa&s;hioned into tools.&mdash;
<PB N="12" REF="036696_0010_100A6B9D4118C300">Quarries of &s;tone and marbles are dug up and poli&s;hed for buildings. The &s;tronge&s;t animals are &s;ubdued and put into their &s;ervice; the bounding hor&s;e, the &s;turdy ox, and even the mighty elephant lends them all his powers. Nothing can re&s;i&s;t their force. Old ocean roars and foams in vain. Tall &s;hips ri&s;e upon the &s;tocks, &s;uck the yielding flood and plough the main in que&s;t of foreign luxuries. The aged fore&s;t falls beneath their &s;ounding axes. Elegant hou&s;es are erected; the fields are ploughed, meadows drained, and orchards planted. Adorned with fruits and flowers, the earth &s;miles like the garden of God. Their barns are filled with plenty, and their pre&s;&s;es bur&s;t out with new wine. Royal dainties, even cakes of wheat-flour with marrow and fatne&s;s, are piled upon their tables; while their wardrobes are filled with fine linnens and purple, and with &s;ilks dyed in the rich colours of the &s;howing arch!</P>
<P>Thus abundantly &s;upplied with all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life, they now get lei&s;ure to cultivate the fine arts and to ta&s;te of tho&s;e far &s;ublimer plea&s;ures of which God has rendered them capable. Painting and printing are invented, by the help of which we can take a view of all the great men and mighty nations of ancient or modern days. Their origin, wars, vices and virtues, with all their intere&s;ting con&s;equences, are &s;et before us, to our infinite entertainment and in&s;truction. Mu&s;ic is &s;tudied, that magic art, who&s;e wondrous notes can waken every pa&s;&s;ion of our &s;ouls, and charm our &s;en&s;es into rapture. Poetry too is cultivated, that a&s;toni&s;hing power which tran&s;ports us out of our&s;elves, and lifts our thoughts to heaven.</P>
<P>Who, without the &s;weete&s;t emotions of gratitude, can ca&s;t an eye over this immen&s;e fea&s;t, this royal banquet of delights which the great king has &s;pread for us his &s;ubjects? Or who can meditate, though but for a mo|ment, on this plea&s;ing wondrous theme, without feeling that great truth; the natural equality of men? Does not every man, rich or poor, equally covet the&s;e felici|ties of life; and is he not, of him&s;elf, equally unable to procure them? Are we not equal in our wants, and equal in our inability to &s;upply them without the help
<PB N="13" REF="036696_0011_100A6BA048C55898">of others, and therefore equally dependant on one another? Without our brethren we can do nothing, no, not even make a hoe or a hatchet; but united with them, &s;upported by their ingennity and &s;trength, we can look on this world with all its rich furniture as our own, and gratefully exclaim with the Poet.</P>
<Q><L>"For us kind nature wakes her genial power,</L>
<L>Suckles each plant, and blo&s;&s;oms every flower.</L>
<L>Annual for us, the grape, the ro&s;e renew</L>
<L>The juice nectarious and the balmy dew.</L>
<L>For us the mine a thou&s;and trea&s;ures brings,</L>
<L>For us health gu&s;hes from a thou&s;and &s;prings.</L>
<L>Seas roll to waft us, &s;uns to light us ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Our foot &s;tool earth, our canopy the &s;kies."</L></Q>
<P>What virtuous min I can think of the&s;e things with|out catching impre&s;&s;ions the mo&s;t de&s;irable, without feeling &s;entiments the mo&s;t tender and benevolent to|wards his fellow-men? We have &s;een that, it is not good for man to be alone; that alone, he is a feeble helple&s;s wretch, living in a world &s;tored with ten thou|&s;and ble&s;&s;ings, but which, Tantalus-like, he has not power to ta&s;te; that alone, he is but as a poor &s;hip|wrecked &s;ailor ca&s;t on a de&s;olate i&s;land, where he is hard put to it for berries and roots to keep him from &s;tarv|ing. But that in our a&s;&s;ociated &s;tate, we are like a great family of brothers whom God has placed together as mutual aids, and has endued with &s;uitable talents, giv|ing this to one, that to another, &s;o that we can now mo&s;t ea&s;ily command all the conveniences and elegan|cies of a happy life. O how clo&s;ely ought the&s;e con|&s;iderations to unite us to our &s;pecies, how powerfully do they bind it upon us to love one another? Is it not as much a law of nature that we &s;hould love one another, as it is that the members of the body &s;hould love one another? As that the eyes &s;hould love the feet for car|rying them to gaze on the dear objects of their affecti|ons? Or, that the feet &s;hould love the eyes for directing them to &s;lowery walks to ramble in?</P>
<P>This endearing light in which nature her&s;elf teaches us to view one another, is enough one would think to
<PB N="14" REF="036696_0012_100A6BA375008EC8">bani&s;h all hateful pa&s;&s;ions from our bo&s;oms, and e&s;peci|ally, pale, heart &s;ickening envy. Envy! Merciful God! Whom &s;hall we envy? Our own fle&s;h and blood kindly multiplied into a thou&s;and brothers, and placed around us on purpo&s;e to admini&s;ter to our happine&s;s! And for what &s;hall we envy them? For tho&s;e very tal|ents and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which God has conferred on them for our own good, and which will be the more for our good, in exact proportion as they po&s;&s;e&s;s them in a more eminent degree. This were a &s;in not only again&s;t na|ture, but utterly unknown to nature. Do the members of the body ever repine at each others perfections?&mdash; Does the foot repine becau&s;e the eye is quick &s;ighted to &s;ee a thou&s;and charming objects; becau&s;e the ear with admirable nicety can di&s;tingui&s;h enchanting &s;ounds; or becau&s;e the arms are &s;trong and able to get an abund|ance of good things? No: they rejoice in each others perfections, as in the in&s;truments of their own glory and happine&s;s. In like manner, ought not every mem|ber of the great body of &s;ociety to rejoice in the per|fections of his brother member? Am I a poor man, ought I not to rejoice that God has be&s;towed great riches on my neighbor, who can undertake works of great public u&s;efulne&s;s and give employment and bread to thou&s;ands of poor men and their families? Am I weak and ignorant, ought I not to thank God for giv|ing my neighbor wi&s;dom to invent and to in&s;truct me in tho&s;e arts which make my life &s;o much more ea&s;y and comfortable? Am I timid and fearful, ea&s;ily fright|ened out of my rights&mdash;ought I not to be thankful that my neighbor has courage to ri&s;e up in my behalf and to defend me again&s;t him who would be too &s;trong for me? Am I rich, never &s;o rich&mdash;I have equal cau&s;e of gratitude that I am not left to &s;tarve amid&s;t my piles of guineas and half-joes, but that God has kindly placed around me thou&s;ands of poor brothers, all ready, this with his &s;trength, that with his ingenuity; one with this charming are, another with that, to add to me all the comforts and plea&s;ures of life!

<P>This endearing view of human kind, this looking on our neighbor as our&s;elf, kindly multiplied into many members, into many dear brothers for mutual good, mu&s;t &s;hew us as with a &s;un beam what a horrid thing it is for one man to hurt another!

<P>This great doctrine "the natural equality of men," founded in our equal wants and equal inability to &s;upply them, &s;ugge&s;ts the great duty of exerting our&s;elves for the common benefit. He who neglects this de&s;erves not to be called a good man, for he withholds from the community the ble&s;&s;ings which he might confer, &amp; by meanly with|drawing his &s;houlders from the common burden, he cruelly throws too great a part of it upon others. Such a man, in&s;tead of ri&s;ing as is fooli&s;hly imagined, by &s;uch a life of idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, degrades him&s;elf into the condition of an ungrateful beggar, who lives upon the labours of others without making any return.</P>
<P>And be&s;ides, what can &s;ink a man more even in his own eyes, than that he has done nothing to &s;erve his neighbors, to benefit his poor relations, to educate and e&s;tabli&s;h his own children, or to advance the intere&s;t and glory of his country; in fine, that he has buried his talents, defeated the kind intentions of heaven in be|&s;towing them, and that if he were cut off by death, his place would not be mi&s;led, nay, the world would be happily delivered from an u&s;ele&s;s burden.</P>
<P>On the other hand, what nobler &s;atisfaction can any per&s;on enjoy than in the reflection, that, no day pa&s;&s;es over his head but &s;ees him diligently employed in pro|moting his own and the happine&s;s of mankind: that he not only &s;upplies others with many of the good things of this life, but endeavors by his good example to rai&s;e their joyful views to a far brighter world. An exalting con&s;ideration this, and one equally open to the poor and to the rich; for as in the natural body, the &s;malle&s;t joint, the &s;malle&s;t nerve and fibre, contributes

Hence it is not to be doubted, that the meane&s;t laborer, the poore&s;t &s;lave, who cheerfully exerts him&s;elf in the duties of his place, has a right to &s;hare with the mo&s;t exalted of the &s;ons of men, that glorious tide&mdash;the friend of mankind and the &s;ervant of God.</P>
<P>This great doctrine "the natural equality of men," &s;weeps away all ground of pride from the rich, and of dejection from the poor.</P>
<P>Some of the great nabobs of the earth, long accu&s;tom|ed to the cap in hand homage of the poor, may not per|haps like to be told that there is no difference between the rich lord in his &s;ilks, and the poor black-&s;mith in his lea her apron; no odds between the learned doctor in his velvet cap and morocco &s;lippers, and the &s;imple un|lettered ploughman.</P>
<P>Incon&s;iderate mortal! who can take airs upon your|&s;elf and de&s;pi&s;e your poor brother becau&s;e he is ignor|ant and you learned. You under&s;tand Latin and Greek, and can talk of Comets and Eclip&s;es, and yet after all, the Cobler is a more independent man than you are, for he can do better without your Comets and Eclip&s;es, without your hic, haec, hoc's, than you can without his &s;hoes.</P>
<P>And you my monied friend who are plea&s;ed to &s;up|po&s;e your&s;elf quite independent of mechanics and trades|men &mdash;worth a ho&s;t of black&s;miths, butchers and bakers, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.

<P>Every thing &s;hews "the natural equality of man." If the philo&s;opher confers a favor on the ploughman by inventing for him a plough, the ploughman requites the favor by u&s;ing it, and thereby &s;upplying the philo&s;opher

Thus we all depend on each other like the linke in a golden chain, which tho' not all preci&s;ely of the &s;ame &s;ize are yet equally e&s;&s;ential to the beauty and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the whole.

Take away our mechan|ics, and of how many conveniencies &s;hould we be de|prived? Take away our men of genius, and what a number of noble arts and inventions &s;hould we lo&s;e? Take away our poets, painters and mu&s;icians, and how many &s;weet embelli&s;hments would be lo&s;t to &s;ocial life? And if our gallant &s;eamen and &s;oldiers, our Truxtons'.

Thus has GOD, the common PARENT, removed far from us all ground of pride on the part of the rich, and of dejection on the part of the poor&mdash;" the rich and the poor, &s;ays Solo|mon, meet together, the Lord is the maker of them all." In his view all good men are equally honorable, and none of them are more or le&s;s worthy than another; but in as far as he di&s;charges or neglects the part allotted him and increa&s;es or dimini&s;hes the &s;um of general hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Since then no individual has either time or talents to procure the materials of a happy life, without an affec|tionate union with his fellow men in &s;ociety&mdash;it is very plain that God intended man for &s;ociety, and it is as plainly his intention that good laws and government &s;hould be introduced among them. As in the human body tho&s;e numberle&s;s &s;inews which give it all its mo|tions, are not left at liberty to di&s;tort and convul&s;e it at

The weakne&s;s of human nature ren|ders this nece&s;&s;ary; for when men leaving their caves and dens fir&s;t came together, they were neither Solo|mons nor Saints, but a rude &s;elfi&s;h race, too ready to lay light hands on whatever plea&s;ed them, and to knock down all who di&s;plea&s;ed them; and at this day there are but too many of the &s;ame mohawk principles, ready to rob, to &s;lander, and even to murder their neighbors in duels. Yes, the Iron re&s;traint of the laws is nece&s;|&s;ary; and laws require rulers to execute them&mdash;for it would never do for a whole country to quit their ploughs and convene to make laws to puni&s;h criminals. Cer|tain per&s;ons mu&s;t be elected by the people and inve&s;ted with their authority to make good laws and to &s;ee them rigorou&s;ly executed, "to the terror of evil doers and to the prai&s;e of them that do well."</P>
<P>Hence appears the exceeding obligation of civil obe|dience, an obligation the greate&s;t of all others, our duty to God excepted. Indeed this con&s;titutes a very con|&s;iderable part of our duty to him; for God de&s;ires above all things the happine&s;s of man. But as man cannot be happy without &s;ociety, nor &s;ociety &s;ecure without laws, nor laws effectual without rulers, nor ru|lers beneficial unle&s;s they are dutifully obeyed&mdash;it fol|lows that CIVIL OBEDIENCE is infinitely plea&s;ing to God. 'Tis the accompli&s;hment of his favorite wi&s;h and therefore he looks on it as paid to him&s;elf, and ve|ry ju&s;tly too: for as we are to be their &s;ubjects, God has been plea&s;ed to delegate to us the power to chu&s;e &s;uch laws and rulers as we &s;hall think mo&s;t likely to make our&s;elves happy. And &s;ince in chu&s;ing the&s;e we are but u&s;ing the right which God him&s;elf put into our hands, expre&s;sly to make our&s;elves happy according to his ble&s;&s;ed will; it follows that the rulers which we cho&s;e are, in fact, of God's chu&s;ing.&mdash;"Let every &s;oul (cries that noble&s;t of patriots St. Paul,) be &s;ubject to the higher powers (the rulers) for they are ordained of

No wonder that the great pre&s;erver of men is &s;o anxious that we &s;hould du|tifully obey our rulers, for it is indeed the greate&s;t of ab &s;ocial ble&s;&s;ings, the grand principle of union, &s;trength, order, peace, and happine&s;s to a nation. Embraced in this golden band, we are no longer feeble, crumbled in|dividuals, but the force of millions is collected and ex|erted as a mighty man. The ample &s;hield of a nation's power is &s;pread over each virtuous character. Under its awful &s;hade we enjoy &s;afety and peace. The &s;ons of violence are curbed, the bloody effects of individual rage and re&s;entment are happily checked. The weak|e&s;t if innocent, is a match for the mightie&s;t, having the force of the whole community to take his part.&mdash; And, be&s;ides, cla&s;ped in the fo&s;tering bo&s;om of his country, he can partake of all the conveniencies and plea&s;ures procured by the art and indu&s;try of his fellow citizens, and at the &s;ame time following his own fa|vorite bu&s;ine&s;s he can gather the rich fruits of it for his own and the good of others. Thus, &s;ecure in each others protection, thus abundant and happy in the &s;weet rewards of their mutual labours, they can eat, drink, and rejoice together like brothers, under the &s;hade of their own vine and fig-tree, none daring to make them afraid. O how goodly a thing it is to &s;ee a whole nati|on living thus together in unity! A &s;ingle in&s;trument of mu&s;ic artfully touched, affords much delight, but how much more delightful to hear an hundred different in&s;truments all mingling their &s;weet notes in one grand concert! So, to &s;ee one man living prudently and hap|pily, affords a heartfelt &s;atisfaction; but to &s;ee thou&s;|ands and millions living harmoniously together, under the &s;ame excelient laws, all cheerfully engaged at their &s;everal works, and moving on &s;moothly in their proper ranks: the rulers wi&s;ely leading, the people dutifully following, and all lovingly accompanying one another.</P>
<P>This is a &s;pectacle worthy the eyes of ble&s;&s;ed angels; nay, God him&s;elf looks down delighted upon them, the

<P>Since &s;o many and &s;uch precious plea&s;ures and advan|tages ari&s;e from good government, what virtuous man can otherwi&s;e than mo&s;t cheerfully pay his part of the taxes nece&s;&s;ary to its &s;upport. O let us not wait 'till ju&s;tice knitting her brow declares, that &s;ince we de&s;ire &s;o much from government, we are bound in equity to contribute to its maintenance; let us not wait 'till the great lover of men thunder forth his orders&mdash;"for this cau&s;e (the welfare of government) pay you taxes al&s;o, for they are God's mini&s;ters attending on this very thing:" No, let generous &s;entiment, let a grateful &s;en&s;e of the numberle&s;s ble&s;&s;ings we receive from our excellent go|vernment render it a plea&s;ure to us to contribute to its &s;upport, its honor and peace.

<P>In Great Britain which is thought to be the happie&s;t government in Europe, they tax every thing, even the elements cannot e&s;cape them. They tax the air above, the earth beneath, and the waters under the earth. And as if all this was not enough, as if wearied of this little peace meal kind of work, they have made lately a &s;hort apoplectic &s;troke at once of ten percent ad valorem, that is, one hundred dollars out of the thou&s;and every year&mdash;in addition to a thou&s;and little hectic taxes be|&s;ides. But in this country, thanks to God, our taxes are &s;o very trifling as ju&s;tly to excite our a&s;toni&s;hment. That a man dwelling in a comfortable hou&s;e, rated at 150 dollars; a plantation of 500 acres, (called a princi|pality in Europe) and 3 valuable &s;laves, making in all 3000 dollars, &s;hould be taxed &s;carcely 3 dollars for the whole. Is not this mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing! and are there. Americans who can think this oppre&s;&s;ive who can re|fu&s;e to pay it, can berate and go near to kill their bro|thers ju&s;t for a&s;king this well earned pittance, can even fly in the venerable face of the parent country, blowing up the flames of a bloody and expen&s;ive in&s;urrection!

<P>Many of the poor, to my knowledge are not quite &s;o chearful in paying their taxes as good citizens ought to be, becau&s;e they have been taught (God forgive their teachers) that all the money goes to the Pre&s;ident and to the quality, i. e. the great folks. This is &s;o far from being true that the very rever&s;e of it is true; that is, in|&s;tead of the poor paying taxes for the rich, the rich pay taxes for the poor. The really poor pay nothing, nay, tho&s;e in circum&s;tances that may be called comfortable pay nothing. e. g. with 99 dollars and 99 cents, you may build a very &s;nug hou&s;e, a much better one than Abraham, I&s;aac or Jacob ever lived in, and in which you and your loving dame with half a &s;core chubby ro&s;y|cheeked boys and girls may live as merry as crickets, and yet your country does not a&s;k you a copper for your hou&s;e, the &s;cene of all this innocent mirth. But Mr. Bingham of Philadelphia, one of the quality, living in a hou&s;e that co&s;t 30,000 dollars, pays no le&s;s than 270 dollars yearly.</P>
<P>Again, you own a heavy waggon and team: with this, Jehu like, you rattle along the high ways, tear up the roads, break down the bridges, and &s;et the poor road menders to cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, and after all, what is your tax? Why not even a &s;harp-&s;hin. But lo! here comes one of the quality in a little gim-crack phaeton and Lilliputian pair, not a tythe the &s;ub&s;tance of your waggon&mdash;a carriage that makes no more impre&s;&s;ion on the roads than does a cat running over a harp&s;ichord, and yet this gentleman pays a tax of 9 dallars.</P>
<P>No, no, my brothers, if you be really poor, you pay nothing, even though your poverty &s;hould be owing to your own &s;hameful love of ea&s;e, or of whi&s;key, you pay nothing! Your dear country, like the &s;trong eagle of heaven gathers you her poore&s;t her unfledged-ne&s;tlings, under her wings, and imparts to you her vital warmth and &s;trong protection, with no other motive than love: or no other pay than the plea&s;ure of doing it.

<P>Who could &s;uffer this without a decline of love for his country, or indeed without feeling that love turn'd into dete&s;tation?</P>
<P>But O happy Americans! we groan under none of the&s;e iniquitous impo&s;itions to wean us from our coun|try; with us the political body &s;till pre&s;erves its exqui|&s;ite &s;hape and &s;ymmetry: the head is not bloated, the feet are not &s;tarv'd.

<P>Another con&s;ideration which mu&s;t rivet the &s;ouls of all rea&s;onable men to our con&s;titution, is that charming delicacy, that profound and equal re&s;pect, with which &s;he treats the religious opinions of her children. Even in that government, which is looked on as the mo&s;t equit|able in the Ea&s;tern world, (I mean Great Britain) the people are at daggers drawn about religion. The Ups in&s;i&s;ting on the Downs to think of God Almighty, and to wor&s;hip him ju&s;t as they do, or to dow&s;e their money. Oh! this is a &s;hameful thing, a dreadful draw-back on patrioti&s;m! What, &s;hall I &s;weat and bleed in &s;upport and defence of my country, and when I expected her &s;weete&s;t &s;miles, her kinde&s;t care&s;&s;es, &s;hall &s;he mo&s;t un|gratefully reject my petition to &s;ay what prayers I think be&s;t; &s;hall &s;he look tamely on and &s;ee my hard-earned &s;ub&s;tance &s;old by the &s;heriff to &s;well the princely revenue of &s;ome bi&s;hop, to who&s;e church I belong not? He mu&s;t be an I&s;raelite indeed, in whom there is no gall, whom this would not provoke to dete&s;t his country as a cruel &s;tep-mother, and to turn his back on her forever. But, thanks to God, we have none of the&s;e pontifical vil|lamies to wean our affections from our country, or from one another. We are perfectly at liberty to wor&s;hip our Maker, every man according to the dictates of his own con&s;cience; and provided we act up to the high character of good citizens, our excellent con&s;titution &s;tands equally a wall of fire around all, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, Chri&s;tians or Mahometans.</P>
<P>O my beloved mother country! my &s;oul embraces thee with more than filial ardour for this thy wi&s;e and equal love to all us thy dutiful children, and for that thou allowe&s;t no e&s;tabli&s;hment to create heart burnings among us, no mercile&s;s Prie&s;t with fire and faggot to roa&s;t us to death.</P>
<P>And O my dear brothers, native or adopted &s;ons of Columbia! If ever people on earth were under particu|lar obligations to love their country, we are that people. Our land is &s;ignally favor'd of heaven and our govern|ment has every thing to make it dear to us. Bought by
<PB N="27" REF="036696_0025_100A6BC2955C4AD0">the deare&s;t blood of our Fathers; planned by our able&s;t Legi&s;lators; approved by our firme&s;t Patriots; and ra|tified by the &s;acred majoriy of our nation: It &s;tands on the broad ba&s;e of Equity; maintains inviolate the ju&s;t rights of every cirizen; &s;ecures to all alike their civil and religious liberties; and to all alike holds out the faire&s;t opportunities to ri&s;e to wealth, to u&s;efulne&s;s, and to glory. O ble&s;&s;ed land of well &s;ecured liberty, of equal laws, of moderate taxes, and of univer&s;al tolera|tion! where no king can trample, no &s;tate&s;man oppre&s;s, not prie&s;t can per&s;ecute us; but where all, like an equal band of brothers, cheerfully cultivating our &s;everal tal|ents, may enjoy more happine&s;s than can be found in any other nation on earth! What dutiful &s;on can think of all the&s;e thy truly republican favors without cla&s;ping thee to his heart as thy deare&s;t be&s;t of mothers, who gave us our birth, nur&s;ed our helple&s;s infancy, &s;upports our manhood, and lavi&s;hes on us a profu&s;ion of every earthly good. Or what prodigal &s;on who con&s;iders the hu&s;ks fed on by the poor in other lands, but their plen|teou&s;ne&s;s of bread at thy table O Columbia, but mu&s;t in&s;tantly exclaim, "I will ari&s;e, and will go to the arms of my country." Volney a&s;&s;ures us, that in the Holy land the people are &s;o wretchedly poor, that to avoid &s;tarving they u&s;e &s;o much cockle and wild &s;eeds in their bread as often &s;ickens them&mdash;and that he actually &s;aw at the gates of the once flouri&s;hing Dama&s;cus a couple of meagre, half naked wretches contending with hungry dogs over the carca&s;e of a dead camel. O that we did but know in this our day the many felicities we enjoy under this our government, and did but love the govern|ment as we ought!</P>
<P>But how &s;hall we manife&s;t our love? By &s;plitting into parties and mortally hating one another? No, God for|bid; for a furious party &s;pirit is the greate&s;t judgment, the heavie&s;t cur&s;e that can befal our country. It extin|gui&s;hes love in the be&s;t hearts, and in the wor&s;t it blows up the coals of hatred to ten fold fury. It makes even good men &s;hy of one another and breaks off the &s;weete&s;t friend&s;hip. This vile &s;pirit deforms every thing; by giving a hardne&s;s to the features and a fiercene&s;s to the

It pollutes the mo&s;t &s;acred places, introducing unnatural &s;trifes even there where &s;weete&s;t harmony &s;hould ever &s;ound; in our &s;treets and at our tables. It fills our new&s;papers which were meant to be the vehicles of innocent amu&s;ement and calm in|&s;truction, with the bittere&s;t abu&s;e, provoking to bloody battles and murderous duels. It confounds all the great di&s;tinctions of worth and villainy in characters; the vileft creature, the ba&s;e&s;t Arnold, if on our &s;ide, is cried up as an angel; while an angel if he oppo&s;e us, though never &s;o decently and for ever &s;o good rea&s;ons, is brand|ed as a mi&s;creant! It corrupts our ta&s;te; the dirtie&s;t new&s;paper printer, if he blackguard for us, is applauded as a Junius; while a Junius, if again&s;t us, is execrated as a mere Billingsgate writer. It bani&s;hes all &s;en&s;e of gratitude, ju&s;tice, and truth. What &s;ignifies the pure&s;t innocence, the uprighte&s;t intentions, the greate&s;t abilities, the profounde&s;t learning, if oppo&s;ed to us, they vani&s;h into nothing; the greate&s;t abilities are hooted at, the brighte&s;t virtues are not &s;een, the longe&s;t and faithfule&s;t &s;ervices are all forgotten under the bias of this mo&s;t di&s;|ingenious &s;pirit&mdash;JEFFERSON is an empty Pedant, FRANKLIN and old Fool, ADAMS a Briti&s;h Agent, and WASHINGTON&mdash;let faction write the re&s;t! It ruins all our public affairs; the ble&s;&s;ed end of &s;ociety and government is to unite men in promoting their mu|tual intere&s;t, but the aim of party &s;pirit is to di&s;unite them entirely. Overlooking the general good, the &s;tu|dy of each faction, (I mean the de&s;igning men) is, to advance their own &s;eparate &s;trength, and to &s;ink their opponents in the public e&s;teem, calumniating the wor|thie&s;t characters, charging the wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ures with fol|ly, the be&s;t intentions with villainy; thus fiding the minds even of hone&s;t men with prejudices again&s;t their rulers, and oppo&s;ition to taxes, which, by compelling govern|ment to u&s;e coercive mea&s;ures, bring on in&s;urrection and civil war with all their horrors: when brother with wor&s;e than helli&s;h fury &s;hall &s;heath his &s;teel in his bro|ther's heart, or call in ruthle&s;s foreigners to aid the ac|cur&s;ed deed; and when God, the righteous Judge, in

<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, 'tis &s;till in our power to e&s;cape this political damnation, and to become the happie&s;t of all nations; the remedy is &s;imple, and is contain'd in the following admirable precepts of an in&s;pired writer:&mdash; "HONOR <HI>all men</HI>&mdash;LOVE <HI>the brotherhood</HI>&mdash;FEAR GOD&mdash;HONOR <HI>the king.</HI>"</P>
<P>Let us honor all men; yes, even tho&s;e who differ from us in political &s;entiments. They may love their country as dearly as we do, and may, with equal &s;inceri|ty, be aiming at her be&s;t intere&s;ts, though they do not approve the &s;ame means. They may be more in the right than we are aware. Let us treat them with re|&s;pect, and never di&s;grace our character and cau&s;e by rudene&s;s and reviling, by "ra&s;h &s;u&s;picions and unmanly &s;lander."</P>
<P>To make this more ea&s;y and plea&s;ant; Love the bro|therhood. Let us remember that we are the &s;ame ma|terials wrought by the great. Architect, into thou&s;ands of &s;prings, wheels, and cogs, of different &s;trengths and &s;izes, but to make up the &s;ame grand harmonious ma|chine; that we are the &s;ame fle&s;h and blood wonderfully multiplied into millions of brothers, and wifely gifted with different talents and a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;ociety, to make up one great political body. O then let us live toge|ther as brothers, treating each other's &s;entiments with re&s;pect, making proper allowance for education, read|ing, abilities and company; overcoming tho&s;e who dif|fer from us, by &s;oft words, &s;ound arguments, and good lives; and wifely recollecting that violent oppo&s;ition even to the mo&s;t ab&s;urd opinions, in&s;tead of breaking, will rivet the chains of error, and preclude all po&s;&s;ibili|ty of future conviction. And O, if our own happine&s;s is dear to us, let us forever remember that in exact pro|portion as we le&s;&s;on our mutual love we le&s;&s;en our own happine&s;s; we di&s;&s;olve the golden bands of union, we become weak, contemptible, and an ea&s;y orey to any cruel and wutchful enemy.

Let us fear God; that is the only firm ba&s;e on which the happine&s;s of individuals, the pro&s;perity of nations can re&s;t &s;ecurely. It is the only root from which every branch of duty can &s;pring in full vigor, be fed and en|livened, It gives courage in danger, moderation in pro&s;perity, and contentment in poverty.

And thank God, we have a Chief Magi&s;trate, who is, and has, for a great many years, been "a mini&s;ter of God to us for good," one whom we can honor with alacrity, not coldly as from duty, but cordially as from love; love, for his great virtues, love for his eminent &s;ervices to our dear country. For, who fir&s;t alarmed our country again&s;t Briti&s;h encroachments? Our Pre&s;ident. Who fir&s;t rou&s;|ed the indignation of our oppre&s;&s;ed Colonies? Our Pre|&s;ident.

And who, for &s;even and twenty long years has cea&s;ele&s;sly toiled to advance our nation to glo|ry and happine&s;s? Our Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>Now, who can have any claim on our gratitude, or on our confidence, if this man has not. Who can meditate on all the&s;e his great &s;ervices, without feeling a fire kindling and breaking out in earne&s;t prayers to heaven,
