<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent Collection of Laws, which founded the Government of <HI>Harvard-College,</HI> was made on a late extraordinary Ca&s;e, wherein the Over&s;eers of &s;aid College a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves a SOVEREIGN Power over that College, and the SOLE Right to judge and cen&s;ure and <HI>di&s;mi&s;s</HI> the PRESIDENT or ANY Member of the Corpo|ration of &s;aid College, without the <HI>Con&s;ent</HI> or any <HI>Act</HI> of that Corporation for the &s;ame.

PRACTICES upon the Preceeding Laws of 42 and 50, which originally con&s;tituted the Over&s;eers and Corporation of <HI>Harvard-College.</HI></P>
<P>The four preceeding Laws of 42, 50, 57, 72, were all the &s;tanding Laws, on which the Govern|ment of &s;aid College was founded, in old Charter Times. And &s;ince Practices upon ancient Laws, neare&s;t the Times wherein &s;uch Laws were made, do be&s;t explain and interpret them; here are &s;ub|joined &s;ome Acts of the Court, in tho&s;e early Times, which &s;how what Sen&s;e the Court put upon the&s;e two Laws which originally con&s;tituted the Over&s;eers and Corporation of &s;aid College; and what Powers the Court, without Re&s;erve to them&s;elves, had been <HI>plea&s;ed</HI> to grant in the&s;e Laws to the Over&s;eers and Corporation of &s;aid College. Thus;</P>
<P><HI>Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 1654. After the Court had con&s;tituted the Over&s;eers and Corporation of &s;aid College; it appears from the Province Records, (Vol. 3. P. 245) That the Court <Q>on Peru&s;al of the RETURN of the <HI>Committee</HI> appointed to con&s;ider of the College-Bu&s;ine&s;s, ORDER that all the STOCK ap|pertaining to the College &s;hould be committed to the <HI>Care</HI> and TRUST of the <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> of &s;aid College.</Q> Now by the Act of 42 the Over&s;eers had the <HI>College-Stock</HI> given to them; but after|wards the Charter of 50 takes it out of their Hands and puts it into the Hands of the Corpora|tion; and now in 54 the Court in an extraordinary Ca&s;e INTERPOSE and <HI>&s;u&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd</HI> the Powers of the Charter, and, for a Time, put that Stock back again into the Hands of the Over&s;eers. At fir&s;t View this may &s;eem an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Act in the Court, who by a &s;olemn <HI>Grant</HI> of the Charter of 50 had ve&s;ted the <HI>Property</HI> of that Stock in the &s;aid Corporation. But there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ally <HI>nothing extr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rdinary</HI> in this Act. For as VISITORS, of <HI>their</HI> OWN <HI>College,</HI> the Court had a Right at ALL <HI>Times</HI> to &s;ee that <HI>this</HI> STOCK <HI>was well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hen Care of!</HI> And therefore this Year when the &s;aid Corporation were &s;o few in Number, and Pre&s;ident <HI>Dun&s;ter</HI> being now about to quit his Place, and &s;o the &s;aid College be lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> a HEAD: In the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> weak State of that Society, the Court <HI>&s;eem</HI> for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of that Stock <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">commit</HI> it, for a Time, to the <HI>Care</HI> and TRUST of the Over&s;eers. This was on Act that, in <HI>Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> the VISI|TORS of a College had a Right to do.</P>
<P><HI>Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> 1654. The Court ordered (Prov. Rec. Vol. 3. p. 274) that <Q>Mr. <HI>Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> and Mr. <HI>Cobbet</HI> Pa&s;tors or Teachers of the Churches of <HI>Dedham</HI> and <HI>Lyn</HI> and Mr. <HI>Norton</HI> an <HI>un&s;ettled</HI> Teacher <HI>in</HI> Bo&s;ton, <HI>&s;hould</HI> BE <HI>Over&s;eers;</HI> and JOIN with the re&s;t of the Over&s;eers, in the Work of the College.</Q> And thus, notwith&s;tanding the Acts of 42 and 50, the Court in the Year 54 made NEW Over|&s;eers; and by the &s;ame Power the Court could have unmade the <HI>Former</HI> Over&s;eers. So dependent were the Over&s;eers of the &s;aid College in tho&s;e Times upon the Court. Such a state of Depen|dency, for the <HI>Continuance</HI> of their Being on the Court, does not <HI>&s;eem</HI> to imply that the Over&s;eers of &s;aid College were, in and by their Con&s;titution, the VISITORS of &s;aid College; For Vi&s;itors, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> have not a dependent precarious Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1654. Mr. <HI>Henry Dun&s;ter,</HI> the Pre&s;ident appointed and <HI>named</HI> in the College Charter of 50, re&s;igned his Place; while that Charter and all the Powers granted in it (as well as the Powers granted in the Act of 42 to the Over&s;eers) were &s;o well under&s;tood by ALL <HI>Parties concerned!</HI> For the Court had granted that Charter but <HI>four</HI> Years before. Now from the publick Hi&s;tories of this Country, and from the large Account of the Matter in the College Records, it appears that Mr. <HI>Dun&s;ter</HI> (like Mr. <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt</HI> at <HI>Mar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>) was <HI>forced</HI> either to <HI>re&s;ign</HI> his Place or to <HI>recant</HI> &s;ome of his religious Tenets, and he cho&s;e the former. So this forced Re&s;ignation was in effect the &s;ame Thing with a <HI>Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion</HI> of him from his Place. And now let it be ob&s;erved, "To WHOM <HI>He re&s;igns;</HI> and how far the <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> or <HI>Corporation</HI> of &s;aid College were concerned in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Re&s;ignation, which here follows.</P>

<P>Let it be noted that this Re&s;ignation of Mr. <HI>Dun&s;ter,</HI> implied in it a <HI>proper</HI> Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of him; for a <HI>voluntary</HI> Re&s;ignation is of a quite different Nature.

But this is far from implying that the &s;aid Pre&s;ident can <HI>force</HI> &s;uch a Member to re&s;ign. But <HI>that</HI> Power that can rightfully <HI>force</HI> him to re&s;ign, is mo&s;t certainly A POWER which can rightfully <HI>di&s;mi&s;&s;</HI> him. Now this was Pre&s;ident <HI>Dun&s;ter</HI>'s Ca&s;e.

<P>N. B. The <HI>next</HI> and the <HI>only other</HI> In&s;tance of a Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of a Member of &s;aid Corporation was on Feb. <HI>la&s;t</HI> 1741, 2; without <HI>any</HI> Power from the COURT or <HI>any Act</HI> of &s;aid Corporation for the &s;ame, but by the Sole and SOVEREIGN Authority of the Over&s;eers of &s;aid College; who having no plain Law for it not from Times immemorial any In&s;tance of &s;uch a Thing on their Side, <HI>&s;eemed</HI> now re&s;olved to <HI>make</HI> one, that &s;o they might <HI>plead</HI> it in future Times.

<HEAD>V. The State of <HI>Harvard-College</HI> &s;ince the now Province Charter was granted.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the vacating the old Colony Charter of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets in 1684, there were &s;ome new Laws or College-Charters made by the general Court of this Province. But the&s;e Laws (as all others made under our pre&s;ent Province-Charter) were of Cour&s;e to be &s;ent Home for the Royal Approbation; And they all were &s;ent Home accordingly, and have been di&s;approved. So that no Laws whatever remain, but the four preceeding Laws fo 42, 50, 57 and 72, as the Foundation on which the Government of the &s;aid C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e now &s;tands.

<HEAD>REASONS to prove that the Honourable and Reverend <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> of <HI>Harvard-College</HI> have no Independent Pow|er over the Corporation of &s;aid College, nor can Di&s;mi&s;s a Member of &s;aid Corporation, &s;olely by Them&s;elves; But that the GENERAL COURT alone have &s;uch a <HI>Sove|reign</HI> Power; And are the VISITORS of &s;aid College.</HEAD>
<P>IN Order to the Proof of This, Let it be Premi&s;ed.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That from all the Preceeding Laws it appears that the &s;aid <HI>Harvard-College</HI> was originally the College of the General Court of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett;</HI> Colo|ny; That the General Court of &s;aid Colony <HI>built</HI> it and <HI>named</HI> it and ordered <HI>where</HI> it &s;hould be built and <HI>what Kind</HI> of Building it &s;hould be; And that all the Powers which any Per&s;ons ever had from the beginning, or now have over the &s;aid College, were originally derived to them from the General Court of the Colony above&s;aid; &s;o that no Per&s;ons whatever can have any Power over the &s;aid College, but only &s;o far as the General Court have been <HI>plea&s;ed</HI> to grant it to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It appears in particular that the Over&s;eers and Corporation of &s;aid College owe their Being and all the &s;tanding Powers They now have, or ever had over the &s;aid College, To Four Laws of the General Court which were made in the Year 1642, 1650, 1657 and 1672. The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> of which Laws originally con&s;tituted Over&s;eers of &s;aid College; The <HI>Second</HI> incorporated the &s;aid College, and is called the Charter of 50; The <HI>Third</HI> is called an Appendix to &s;aid Charter; And the <HI>Fourth</HI> confirmed, added to or altered, &s;ome or <HI>all</HI> of the&s;e preceeding Laws. So that no Powers can now belong to the Over&s;eers and Corporation of &s;aid College but tho&s;e Powers which the Court granted to them in &s;ome or all of the&s;e four Laws.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That in the two latter Laws of 57 and 72, the Court gave to the Over&s;eers of &s;aid College no <HI>New</HI> Powers of any Importance over the &s;aid Corporation; And &s;o there is no Occa&s;ion to con&s;ider any of the&s;e four Laws, but the two <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> in order to determine whether the Over&s;eers of &s;aid College have an <HI>Independent</HI> and Sovereign Power over the &s;aid Corporation.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now from the&s;e two Laws, which con&s;tituted the Over&s;eers and Corporation of &s;aid College, it manife&s;tly appears that the Court did not ve&s;t the Over&s;eers of &s;aid College with &s;uch a &s;overeign Power over the &s;aid Corporation; But that the Court, who originally had this Power, re&s;erved it to them&s;elves; And are VISITORS of &s;aid College.

<P>This Law was made before the Corporation of &s;aid College <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ING; and therefore it gave the Over&s;eers only a Power ever and <HI>unincorp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> College.

And thus the latter Law &s;uper&s;edes or repeals the former Law of 1642. And this Sen&s;e the Great and General Court &s;eem to have put upon the latter Law of 1050; For when in Decemb. 1707 the &s;aid Corporation were ordered to regulate them&s;elves according to the original Con&s;titution of the &s;aid <HI>College,</HI> the Court then declared that <Q>The fir&s;t Foundation and E&s;tabli&s;hment of That Hou&s;e and the Government thereof had its Origin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from an Act of the General Court made and pa&s;&s;ed in the Year 1650 which had not been <HI>repealed</HI> or nulled.</Q> So that the FIRST Foun|dation both of <HI>that Hou&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Government</HI> thereof had <HI>not</HI> its ORIGINAL from the <HI>prior</HI> Law of 1642 but from the latter Law of 1650. And hereon it follows that the Law of 1642 (which was <HI>before</HI> the FIRST Foundation of that Hou&s;e and the <HI>Government</HI> thereof) was &s;at <HI>a&s;ide</HI> and <HI>re|moved</HI> out of the Way in order to <HI>Lay</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that Hou&s;e and in <HI>Government</HI> upon the incorporating Act of 1650.

So that by this Law of 42 the Over&s;eers of &s;aid College (in&s;tead of having 2 &s;overeign Power over it) &s;eem to have no Power at all over it, not over the Corporation thereof.</P>
<P>A plain In&s;tance may illu&s;trate this Law of 164<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: Suppo&s;e the General Court in 1642 had ap|pointed Over&s;eers to order and govern the Inhabitants of a Place, in the Colony, who had not as yet been incorporated into a <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n;</HI> and afterwards in 1650 the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rt &s;hould have have made the place a <HI>Town<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hip;</HI> &mdash; How <HI>far</HI> would the&s;e Inhabitants, now incorporated into a Town, be <HI>&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ject</HI> to their former Over&s;eers by Virtue of the Law which con&s;tituted &s;uch Over&s;eers before the Place was made a Town?

By N. Means! Unle&s;s the <HI>latter</HI> Law, which incorpo|rated the Place into a Town&s;hip, gave &s;uch a Power to the former Over&s;eers of the Place. Nor would the&s;e Over&s;eers have any Powers at all over &s;uch a Place, <HI>after</HI> it was made a Town, unle&s;s

<P>Some truly worthy and valuable teaching Elders of the &s;ix neighbouring Towns are of Opinion, <Q>That the Law of 42 above&s;aid is the great STANDING Law that contains all the more important and &s;uperior Powers over the &s;aid College; And that the Charter of 50 was made as a Thing by the BY, and only empower the Pre&s;ident and Fellows to do &s;ome <HI>&s;mall</HI> Matters; and for the Sake of the College-Stock, it being nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be a Corporation in Law in order to acquire and hold a Stock.</Q> But in An&s;wer hereto. 1. This Suppo&s;ition is <HI>apparently</HI> contrary to the above mentioned Declaration of the General Court, which determines that the Act or Charter of 50 is the ORIGINAL of &s;aid College. So that the &s;aid Law of 42 is <HI>beyond</HI> the ORIGINAL of that College, and therefore <HI>&s;eems</HI> to be out of Date. So far is it from being <HI>certain</HI> that this Law of 42 is "The <HI>great &s;tanding</HI> LAW&mdash;"the LAW that contains all the more <HI>important</HI> and <HI>&s;uperiour</HI> Powers over the &s;aid College. But 2. This Suppo&s;ition above&s;aid is contrary to the whole Strain and Tenou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the &s;aid Charter of 50 which no longer treates the Pre&s;ident and Fellows <HI>as</HI> in a State of <HI>Minority</HI> under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> (though the mo&s;t <HI>Honourable</HI> in the Land) but at now grown up <HI>to the full Statute of</HI> MEN. Thus particularly the &s;aid Charter enacts, <Q>That in all <HI>great</HI> and <HI>difficult</HI> Ca&s;es a general Meeting of ALL the Over&s;eers and Society, or Corporation, &s;hall be procured; and the <HI>Conclu&s;ion</HI> be made by the major Part (of the Corporation) the Over&s;eers con&s;enting thereto</Q>&mdash;Is this only a Power in &s;aid Corporation to do &s;ome <HI>&s;mall</HI> Matters? Or is this treating the Pre&s;ident and Fellows as &s;till in a State of Mi|nority and <HI>Pupillage</HI> under Over&s;eers, when a <HI>general</HI> Meeting of ALL the Over&s;eers can make <HI>no</HI> Conclu&s;ion at all, and that in the mo&s;t <HI>great</HI> and <HI>difficult</HI> Ca&s;es, but by <HI>con&s;enting</HI> to a Conclu&s;ion made on &s;uch Ca&s;es by the Corporation? &mdash; Thus again 'tis enacted in &s;aid Charter, <Q>That the Pre&s;ident and Fellows &s;hall forever hereafter in Name and Fact be one Body Politick or Cor|porate in Law to ALL Intents and Purpo&s;es</Q> and therefore <HI>not</HI> to ONE Intent and Purpo&s;e <HI>only.</HI> viz. The acquiring and holding a Stock, and the &s;uing or being &s;ued on the Account thereof. And thus evidently did the Court by this Charter, <HI>manumitt</HI> the &s;aid College from a State of <HI>meer</HI> Pupillage to Over&s;eers, and locked on it as now grown up to Maturity and <HI>&s;itting</HI> to be incorporatd

And as a Law that incorporates a Town can by a very ju&s;t Figure of Speech be called the ORI|GINAL of &s;uch a Town, &s;o the incorporating Act of 1650 above-mentioned is, in its own Nature, the ORIGINAL of Harvard-College, as well as it has been declared by the Legi&s;lature to <HI>Be</HI> the ORIGINAL of &s;aid College. And therefore</P>
<P N="2">II. The latter Law of 1650, which incorporated Harvard College, and not the Prior Law of 1642, contains tho&s;e Powers which the pre&s;ent Over&s;eers have over the Corporation of the &s;aid College.</P>
<P>Now by this latter Law which incorporated Harvard College, the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">For the Truth of this FACT let the &s;aid Charter of 50, be con&s;ulted from Beginning to End! all the Powers of the Over&s;eers which are either <HI>granted</HI> or <HI>mentioned,</HI> or even <HI>referred</HI> to, in that Charter are contained in the 3d, 6th and 8th &s;mall Paragraphs of &s;aid Charter, <HI>at</HI> it is printed in the preceeding Collection of Colony Laws relating to Harvard College.

So that the Over&s;eers of &s;aid College have no independent and SOVEREIGN Power over the Corporation of &s;aid College, even by that Law which is the only Law that now gives them any Power over that Corporation. To apply this in particular to the POWER of <HI>di&s;mi&s;&s;ing</HI> a Member of &s;aid Corporation.

For &s;ince this Power of removing a Member of the Corporation is no where mentioned in the prior Law of 42 (and no Wonder, for the &s;aid Corporation and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> NO Being) it therefore follows that if &s;uch a Power is contained <HI>at all</HI> in that Law, It mu&s;t <HI>be</HI> &s;o, becau&s;e it is <HI>implied</HI> under &s;ome of the GREAT and more important Powers granted to the Over&s;eers in that Law.

If any Thing farther need to be added, in <HI>&s;o plain a</HI> CASE! there are two Things that may be urged which put it out of all Que&s;tion that the Ge|neral Court re&s;erved this Power to Them&s;elves among other Powers of VISITATION which the Court <HI>never</HI> granted to <HI>any</HI> Per&s;ons whatever!</P>
<P N="1">1. The Fir&s;t is that the explanatory Law of 57 is <HI>more Silent</HI> on this Power than the Charter of 50 it&s;elf! Now one <HI>great</HI> De&s;ign of this Law of 57 was to explain or determine what might <HI>&s;eem</HI> ob&s;cure and undermined in the Charter of 50; and of all <HI>Ca&s;es</HI> that needed to be explained or determined in &s;aid Charter, <HI>This</HI> Ca&s;e (<HI>&s;uppo&s;ing</HI> it to be contained in that Charter!) needed it the mo&s;t; take it <HI>either</HI> Way, viz. as a Ca&s;e not determined <HI>at all</HI> in that Charter, or as of Importance to be determined and not <HI>fitting</HI> to be left at a loo&s;e!&mdash;<HI>Yet</HI> does that explanatory Law leave this Clau&s;e in the Charter (which barely mentions the removing Members of the Corporation, <HI>without</HI> mentioning who had the Power to remove them) at as great a loo&s;e as it was before! And though this Law de&s;cends to &s;uch <HI>little</HI> Affairs as "How the Corporation &s;hould hold a Meeting to agree with <HI>College-Servants</HI> and be re&s;pon&s;ible to the Over&s;eers for all <HI>&s;uch</HI> Agreements; yet this Law &s;ays not one Word on &s;o <HI>great</HI> and &s;o <HI>undetermined</HI> a Ca&s;e as this "Who &s;hould have the Power of removing a <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> or <HI>Fellow</HI> of &s;aid Corporation" which (on <HI>both</HI> the Accounts <HI>above</HI>) needed more to be explained or determined by this Law of 57 than any Thing in that Charter whatever. Nothing therefore can <HI>account</HI> for the Rea&s;on why this explanatory Law &s;hould pa&s;s over &s;o important a Matter in Silence, but this, viz. that &s;uch a Power, not being granted in &s;aid Char|ter to any Per&s;ons whatever, was never looked on in <HI>tho&s;e</HI> Times to be contained in that Charter <HI>at all.</HI> And THEN the Wonder cea&s;es why this explanatory Law did not determine or &s;ettle" Who had or &s;hould have &s;uch a Power; for this Law was to explain or determine what was IN the &s;aid Charter, and <HI>not</HI> this Power which was <HI>Still</HI> in the General Court (for who can imagine that the Court in this explanatory Law de&s;igned to explain or &s;ettle their OWN Powers?) And hereon al&s;o <HI>Another</HI> Wonder cea&s;es viz. Why the Over&s;eers of &s;aid College &s;hould be &s;o <HI>wanting to Them&s;elves</HI> as no to put &s;uch a Thing into their <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> to the Court for Explanation (though the&s;e PROPOSALS, which were for the <HI>Benefit</HI> of the Over|&s;eers, was the very Occa&s;ion of making this Law it&s;elf, as appears from the Preamble.) The Rea&s;on hereof &s;eems to be very plain viz. Becau&s;e ALL Parties concerned with the Government of the College were <HI>con&s;cious,</HI> in tho&s;e early Times which were &s;o near the Time wherein &s;aid Charter was granted, that the <HI>Power</HI> of removing the <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> or <HI>any</HI> Member of &s;aid Corporation was never given BY Charter to any Per&s;ons whaterver, but that the Court had re&s;erved it to them&s;elves. And therefore if one (among the re&s;t) of the PROPOSALS of the Over&s;eers to the Court had been to explain or determine "Who had the Power of removing the Pre&s;ident, or any other Members of the Corporation, on <HI>Male-Admini&s;tration</HI> of when guilty of <HI>&s;undry Crimes and Mi&s;demeanours;</HI> The Over&s;eers of &s;aid College (with all due and <HI>&s;incere</HI> Deference to them be it mentioned) might have been honourably <HI>reminded</HI> by the <HI>Court</HI> "WHO had <HI>This</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="005041_0028_10168D9EF092AD58">Power <HI>in Them&s;elves</HI> but three Years before, in the Ca&s;e of Pre&s;ident <HI>Dun&s;ter</HI> "When the Court thought <HI>fit</HI> to appoint the Over&s;eers (without joining the Corporation <HI>with</HI> them) as their Com|mittee to manage that Affair, and "to make <HI>Return</HI> to the Court of what they had done therein."</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Thing which puts it out of Que&s;tion that the Court re&s;erved this Power to Them&s;elves, is, the manife&s;t Difference made in the Charter between the removing a Member of the Corporation and removing inferiour College Officers and Servants. Now to exhibit this to <HI>Eye &s;ight,</HI> let tho&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ages be laid together, which are the <HI>only</HI> Pa&s;&s;ages in the Charter that mention the removing of Both the&s;e Kinds of Officers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chu&s;ing</HI> and <HI>Removing</HI> Members of the Cor|poration <HI>by</HI> Charter. <Q>And the &s;aid &s;even Per&s;ons or the greater Number of them procuring the Pre|&s;ence of the Over&s;eers of the College, and by their Counc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l and Con&s;ent &s;hall have Power, and are hereby authorized, at any Time or Times to ELECT <HI>a new Pre&s;ident Fellows or Trea&s;urer</HI> &s;o often and from Time to Time <HI>as any of the &s;aid Per&s;on or Per&s;ons</HI> SHALL <HI>die or</HI> BE <HI>removed</HI></Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>FINIS to <HI>This</HI> Power granted in the Charter!</P>
<P>The <HI>Chu&s;ing</HI> and <HI>Removing</HI> College Servants <HI>by</HI> Charter. <Q>And the Pre&s;ident and Fellows, or major Part of them, from Time to Time may meet and CHUSE &s;uch <HI>Officers and Servants</HI> for the College, and make &s;uch Allowance to them, <HI>and</HI> THEM <HI>al&s;o to</HI> REMOVE, <HI>and after</HI> DEATH <HI>or</HI> REMOVAL <HI>to chu&s;e &s;uch others</HI>&mdash;as they &s;hall think Fit.</Q></P>
<P>Thus <HI>equally</HI> expre&s;s and particular is this Law in &s;pecifying Who &s;hould have the Power of <HI>chu&s;ing</HI> Both the&s;e Kinds of Officers. But when it comes to &s;ay Who &s;hould have the Power to <HI>remove</HI> Then. -THEN <HI>appears the Difference!</HI> for as to the <HI>&s;mall</HI> Power of removing College Servants, the Law is as plain and expre&s;s "Who &s;hould have <HI>That</HI> Power, as it is "Who &s;hould have the Power to <HI>Chu&s;e</HI> them. But as to the <HI>important</HI> Power of removing Members of the Corporation (which in Law can exi&s;t &s;eparately from the Power of chu&s;ing them, as well as in Conjunction <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">h</HI> it, and <HI>often</HI> does &s;o in Colleges <HI>abroad</HI>) Here the Law is all over <HI>altum Silentium</HI>&mdash;Not a <HI>Word</HI> is &s;aid who &s;hould have this Power!&mdash;Now what Rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;ign'd for &s;o manife&s;t a Difference, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">his? viz. That the latter Power being of &s;o much greater Importance than that of removing College <HI>Servants,</HI> the Court who had <HI>All</HI> Power originally in them&s;elves over this College (and who therefore could &s;over|eignly grant the Power of chu&s;ing <HI>without</HI> granting t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ower of removing, ju&s;t as they <HI>plea&s;ed</HI>) did not <HI>intend</HI> in this Law to grant the important Power of removing Members of that Corporation, out of their own Hands; but thought <HI>fit</HI> to re&s;erve it to them&s;elves, among tho&s;e <HI>Vi&s;itatorial</HI> Powers which the Court originally had over this College and never granted to <HI>Any</HI> Per&s;ons whatever.</P>
<P>The <HI>only</HI> Objection that can be here made has, in Reality, been obviated already, viz. That <Q>tis implied of Cour&s;e, and in the Nature of the Thing that tho&s;e have the Power of <HI>removing</HI> who by Charter have the Power of <HI>making</HI> Members of the Corporation; &s;ince the Court mention not, in
<PB N="30" REF="005041_0029_10168DA09360B950">the Charter, who &s;hould have the Power of removing them or grant it to others.</Q> But this Objecti|on &s;uppre&s;&s;es <HI>one Half</HI> of the Truth; if the <HI>Whole</HI> Truth had been given, the Objection would appear inconclu&s;ive a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t View: Thus <Q>that 'tis implied of Cour&s;e and in the Nature of the Thing <HI>[<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ther]</HI> that tho&s;e, who by Charter have the Power of <HI>making</HI> Members of the Corporation, have the Power of <HI>removing</HI> them [or el&s;e <HI>that the</HI> COURT, <HI>who</HI> originally <HI>had this Power, did not part with it</HI> at all, <HI>but re&s;erved it to them&s;elves</HI>] &s;ince the Court mention not in the Charter who &s;hould have this Power or grant it to others.</Q> Now that the latter of the&s;e Suppo&s;itions is <HI>True,</HI> appears by what has been &s;aid already; and may further appear beyond Contradiction by what follows. For 1. The <HI>Former</HI> Suppo&s;ition (on which the Objection is grounded) no Way <HI>accounts</HI> for the Rea&s;on why this Law &s;o expre&s;ly grants the <HI>&s;mall</HI> Power of <HI>Removing</HI> (as well as chu&s;ing) the <HI>inferiour</HI> Officers; and <HI>yet</HI> makes no Grant at all of &s;o much <HI>greater</HI> a Power as that of removing the <HI>Superiour.</HI> Whence comes it <HI>to pa&s;s!</HI> that this Law does not leave the <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> Power of removing College Servants, to be <HI>implied of Cour&s;e</HI> in the Power of <HI>chu&s;ing</HI> them; as well as according to this Suppo&s;ition, it does the <HI>greater</HI> Power of removing Members of the Corporation?&mdash;If this Law had not expre&s;ly mentioned who &s;hould have the Power of removing <HI>Either</HI> of the&s;e Kinds of Officers, the Objection would then have been of &s;ome Force&mdash; Or if the Law had expre&s;ly mentioned who &s;hould have the <HI>greater</HI> Power of removing Members of the Corporation and had &s;aid nothing about the <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> Power of removing College <HI>Servants;</HI> then it might have been &s;uppo&s;ed (what &s;eems to be the <HI>true</HI> Way of arguing in &s;uch Ca&s;es) that the <HI>Greater</HI> Power being granted, the <HI>Le&s;&s;er</HI> was left to be <HI>under&s;tood</HI> and &s;o <HI>implied of cour&s;e.</HI> But &s;ince, unfortunately, for the Objection 'tis quite the contrary. "What po&s;&s;ible Rea&s;on can be given [if this Law &s;uppo&s;es <HI>of cour&s;e</HI> and in the <HI>Nature of the Thing,</HI> the&s;e are to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the POWER <HI>of removing</HI> who have the Power of <HI>making</HI> College Officers] that the Law is not as &s;ilent on the <HI>petty</HI> Power of removing a College <HI>Ser|vant,</HI> as it is ab&s;olutely &s;ilent about the <HI>important</HI> Power of removing a Pre&s;ident or other Members of that Corporation? This is ea&s;ily accounted for, on Suppo&s;ition that the Court re&s;erved this <HI>greater</HI> Power entirely to them&s;elves; but 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to account for it on Suppo&s;ition that the Court made NO &s;uch Re&s;erve. 2. There is no Connection in the <HI>Nature of the Thing</HI> between the Power of removing and the Power of putting into Office. So that it cannot be inferred that both the&s;e Powers are granted <HI>only</HI> becau&s;e One of them is &s;o. Yea 'tis utterly untrue in <HI>Fact</HI> that tho&s;e always have the Power of removing, who have the Power of putting into Office. And of this the Repre&s;entatives them&s;elves, belonging to that Honourable Court who made this Law, are a known and publick In&s;tance! For by the Choice of their re&s;pective Towns they are <HI>made</HI> Repre&s;entatives; but their re&s;pective Towns, 'tis well known, have not the Power of removing their Repre&s;entatives from out of the General Court; But the Hou&s;e, alone, who have not the Power to <HI>make</HI> Repre&s;entatives for the Province, have yet the &s;ole Power to remove them from their Place in the Hou&s;e. So that 'tis not true <HI>either Way,</HI> that tho&s;e have the Power
<PB N="31" REF="005041_0030_10168DA60BE75918">of removing, who have the &s;ole Power of putting into Place or Tru&s;t; nor tho&s;e the Power of putting into Place, who have the &s;ole Power of removing a Per&s;on from Place or Tru&s;t&mdash;and that from one of the mo&s;t Honourable PLACES and <HI>Tru&s;ts</HI> in the Province. Thus it appears, from &s;o <HI>eminent</HI> an In|&s;tance, that there is no Connection in the <HI>Nature of the Thing</HI> between the&s;e two Powers.&mdash;In Truth, they are &s;ometimes granted and conveyed &s;eparately and &s;ometimes in Conjunction, ju&s;t as the &s;upreme Power from whom they are communicated thinks <HI>fit.</HI> Certainly then a <HI>General Court</HI> who originally had the&s;e two Powers over a College that was a Creature of their OWN, may grant the <HI>One</HI> and &s;overeignly keep the <HI>Other</HI> to them&s;elves without granting it <HI>at all.</HI> Now an ab&s;olute SILENCE, under &s;ome Circum&s;tances, upon One of the&s;e Powers (when the other is <HI>expre&s;ly</HI> and <HI>formally</HI> granted) is every Way equivalent to an <HI>Exception;</HI> and &s;o makes an expre&s;s <HI>Negation</HI> of &s;uch a Grant to be <HI>intirely</HI> &s;uperfluous. And of this &s;ort is that <HI>Silence</HI> in the Charter on the Power of removing Members of the Corporation; for, by what has been ob&s;erved above, it can be accounted for <HI>no other</HI> Way. But 3. and <HI>finally</HI> to de|cide this Matter "On which Side of the Que&s;tion are ancient Practices upon this Law? The&s;e are the be&s;t Expo&s;itors of ancient Laws. Now let the Ca&s;e of Pre&s;ident <HI>Dun&s;ter</HI> (p. 5. &amp; 9&mdash;12 of this Paper) be read over in View to the Charter on this Point, and it will appear that no <HI>Comment</HI> ever determined the Meaning of a TEXT better than the Account of this Ca&s;e determines (what the Charter has not <HI>expre&s;ly</HI> done) by whom <HI>the Pre&s;ident, Fellows or Trea&s;urer</HI> SHALL <HI>be removed!</HI> &mdash;<HI>The</HI> JUDGES on this Law (as <HI>Vi&s;itors</HI>) in his Ca&s;e, were the Legi&s;lature who made the Law. And who can explain or determine the Sen&s;e of a Law &s;o well as the Legi&s;lature who made it?&mdash;particularly if a great Part of that Legi&s;lature con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;ame <HI>individual</HI> Per&s;ons who framed and pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch a Law; which, from the <HI>Elections</HI> in the Records <HI>for</HI> the Year 1690 and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> appears in this Ca&s;e to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">!&mdash; <HI>The Over&s;eers and Corporation</HI> al&s;o to whom the Charter of 50 was granted, con&s;i&s;ted by a great Majority of the &s;ame Per&s;ons in 1654 when Mr. <HI>Dun&s;ter</HI> was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, as they did in 1650. So that the generality of all Per&s;ons concerned in his Ca&s;e mu&s;t have had a perfect Under&s;tanding and even <HI>per&s;onal Knowledge</HI> of the Powers granted in the Charter; and of the Rea&s;on of that SILENCE in it, on the Power of removing Members of the Corporation. <HI>The Time</HI> al&s;o was &s;o <HI>near</HI> the Time when that Charter was granted, that the very IDEAS of the &s;everal Power put into it, and the Import of the Clau&s;e that is &s;o <HI>Silent</HI> on the Power of removing Members of that Corporation mu&s;t have been <HI>fre&s;h</HI> and <HI>lively</HI> in the Minds of all the&s;e Per&s;ons who were concerned in his Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.

And thus <HI>the Court,</HI> to whom he re&s;igned, ap|pear to receive his Re&s;ignation as a Matter the Cogni&s;ance of which belonged properly to them; and

In one Word, "The Con&s;titution which gives them <HI>No</HI> negative, and on which therefore they are but PRIMI <HI>inter</HI> PARES is what they <HI>cannot</HI> bear! Nothing &s;hort of BASHAW.

IV. THE GREAT and GENERAL COURT who <HI>founded</HI> Harvard College, and appointed <HI>No</HI> Vi|&s;itors to it, when they finally incorporated the &s;ame, are the <HI>Sole</HI> local VISITORS of that College.</P>
<P>Colleges <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have Vi&s;itors! "Every College, &s;ays <HI>Holt</HI> on Colleges, hath a VISITOR either by to Appointment of the Founder, or the <HI>Law</HI>" &s;o that if the Founder appoints no Vi&s;itor him&s;elf, the Law will do it for him. To imagine therefore that Harvard College has no Vi&s;itor is not only a <HI>vain</HI> Fancy but a <HI>dangerous</HI> Delu&s;ion!&mdash;If that Society has none, the Conclu&s;ion is &s;hort "Har|vard College is NO Corporation in Law" And <HI>Then</HI> what will become of all their STOCK. 'Tis, on this Suppo&s;ition, gone <HI>for ever</HI> out of the Hands of tho&s;e SEVEN that pa&s;s by the <HI>idle</HI> Name of Pre&s;ident and Fellows of Harvard College."&mdash;<HI>The very</HI> FERRYMEN will de&s;pi&s;e them! And tho&s;e mu&s;t be <HI>weaker</HI> than FERRYMEN who give any further Donations to an unincorporated Number of Men that can re|ceive none, or Let them to U&s;e, or &s;ue for them in again, by any NAME that they <HI>dare</HI> publickly own and can <HI>maintain</HI> in Law. But if that College is a Corporation, the Conclu&s;ion is as &s;hort the other Way, that "VISITORS there are and <HI>mu&s;t be</HI> Somewhere", and <HI>The&s;e</HI> can call the whole Body of them to Account and make the loftie&s;t Head of that College to TREMBLE if they find him &s;poiling his LORD's <HI>Goods</HI> or &s;miting his Brethren with the FIST of Wickedne&s;s. The Power of VISITORS does not de|pend on any accidental or local Cu&s;toms or Laws. It depends not even on the Appointment of the Founder him&s;elf! But has a <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Exi&s;tence; and his Heirs <HI>will</HI> have it after him, if he appoints no VISTOR to a College or his own rounding. Now the Court alone founded Harvard College, and appointed no Vi&s;itor to it. So <HI>None</HI> but the Court could be the Vi&s;itors; and therefore, as Heir, none but the Legi&s;tature is or <HI>can be</HI> the local VISITORS of this College.</P>
<P>Here let the Proof of this 4th Article and the general <HI>A&s;&s;ertions</HI> under it be made out. The grea|ter Part &s;hall be taken from what Dr. <HI>Ayliff</HI> (i. e. L. L. D.) has written in his Account of the Uni|ver&s;ity of OXFORD," in which this <HI>Doctor of</HI> LAWS has treated at large on the Power of <HI>Vi&s;itors</HI> as warranted by Cu&s;tom, Law, and common Right. Here then 1. It <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;aid that Harvard Col|lege is a LAY <HI>Corporation.</HI> <Q>A College, &s;ays the Dr. Vol. 2. Pag. 52, is an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Corpo|ration, by Cannon Law, if the Number of <HI>Clerks</HI> exceed or equal that of <HI>Laymen:</HI> If not; 'Tis confe&s;&s;ed to be a LAY Corporation.</Q> Now in the Charter of 50, which is the &s;ole Foundation of Harvard College <HI>as</HI> a Corporation, there is no Provi&s;ion made for any <HI>Clerks</HI> at all! And &s;o 'tis <HI>accidental</HI> to that Foundation, whether tho&s;e who are upon it be <HI>Clerks</HI> or Lawyers or Phy&s;icians. Yea as to the <HI>Fact,</HI> viz. What Function the fir&s;t SEVEN on that Foundation <HI>happened</HI> to be of, it appears there were &s;ix <HI>Laymen</HI> to one <HI>Clerk.</HI> Yet further, if the Over&s;eers were here con&s;idered (as being <HI>on</HI> the Foundation though not incorporated upon it) it appears that the <HI>Honourable</HI> were twenty, and the <HI>Reverend</HI> not more than ten, when fir&s;t &s;et on the Foundation of 50. And thus if the &s;aid Corpo|ration are taken &s;ingly, or together with the Over&s;eers, and this in View either to <HI>Fact</HI> or <HI>Right,</HI> it appears that more <HI>Laymen</HI> were on the Foundation than <HI>Clerks.</HI> So that according to Dr. <HI>Ayl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> <Q>It mu&s;t be <HI>confe&s;&s;ed</HI> that Harvard College is a LAY Corporation.</Q> 'Tis evident al&s;o from the expre&s;s De&s;ign of the In&s;titution that the &s;aid Corporation is <HI>not</HI> accle&s;ia&s;tical. All the Pa&s;&s;ages in the Char|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er relating to its <HI>De&s;ign</HI> are the&s;e, "For the Advancement of all good Literature Arts and Sciences." This is plainly an In&s;titution <HI>at large.</HI> Again "For the Education of Youth in Knowledge and Godline&s;s." Now Godline&s;s does not di&s;tingui&s;h a <HI>Clerk</HI> from a <HI>Layman</HI> any more than <HI>Knowledge</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="005041_0034_10168DAF9CDB5FF8">does. La&s;tly <Q>For the Advancement and Education of Youth in <HI>all Manner</HI> of good Literature Arts and Sciences,</Q> This De&s;ign is as unappropriated as <HI>can</HI> be; 'Tis common and <HI>indifferent</HI> to all; and <HI>not</HI> as we are told in ELECTION Sermons that <Q>the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>peculiar</HI> De&s;ign of our pi|ous Ance&s;tours in founding this College was that it might be a NURSERY for the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try a|mong us, and to &s;upply our Churches with Pa&s;tors and Teachers</Q> nothing of this is written by <HI>our pious Ance&s;tors</HI> in the Charter; and 'tis <HI>directly</HI> again&s;t the very TEXT of the Charter it&s;elf; and &s;o it mu&s;t pa&s;s for <HI>Oral</HI> Tradition. And thus this College taken in all Views is <HI>not</HI> an eccle&s;ia&s;tical Corporation: If it had been &s;o, the Right of Vi&s;itation (according to <HI>Ayliff</HI> Pag. 7. And <HI>Holt</HI> on Colleges) would have devolved to the CHURCH as <HI>Heir;</HI> but now we mu&s;t look el&s;ewhere for this Right. And therefore 2. It mu&s;t be determined who were the <HI>Founders</HI> of this College. Now <HI>Ayliff</HI> Page 6. &s;ays <Q>He is the Founder of a College who <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> erects and endowes it and not He who incorporates it.</Q> In this Sen&s;e of Founding (as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the incorporating ACT by which <HI>alone</HI> a College is founded as a Body politick) the Dr. goes on and &s;ays, <Q>If the King and a common Per&s;on at the &s;ame Time gives Lands &amp;c. to a College <HI>on</HI> its Foundation [viz. o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> being FIRST erected and endowed] The King is &s;aid to be the Founder by Rea&s;on of his Eminence; But if a common Per&s;on founds a College WITH Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of &s;mall Value, and the King afterwards endowes it with greater, yet the common Per&s;on &s;hall be taken to be the Founder and not the King.</Q> Hence "th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n by a Parity of Rea&s;on; In the fir&s;t Ca&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing any common Per&s;ons had been <HI>as early</HI> in erecting and endowing that College as the Court was, yet the Court alone (by Rea&s;on of its <HI>Eminence</HI>) would have been the Founder; and the&s;e common Per&s;ons could by no Means be &s;tiled <HI>Co-Founders</HI> with the Court! But in the latter Ca&s;e <HI>(a fortiori)</HI> the Court is the &s;ole Founder: For if a common Per&s;on, on being the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> in erecting and endowing that College, would have held the Name of Foun|der again&s;t the Court it&s;elf; certainly then the Court, who <HI>really were</HI> the FIRST, will hold the Name of Founder again&s;t all common Per&s;ons; let the&s;e afterwards give ever &s;o much to it. Now that the Court were <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> in erecting and endowing it, appears from the <HI>Province</HI> and <HI>College Records</HI> compared Page 4. 5, of this Paper. The Court fir&s;t began the FUND for erecting and endowing this College in 1636. But what all private Per&s;ons gave to is was <HI>afterwards;</HI> and in particular what Mr. <HI>Harvard</HI> gave to it was by WILL in 1638. Hence then Mr. <HI>Harvard</HI> and all other private Donours were <HI>Benefactors</HI> to this College: but the COURT alone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Founders</HI> This brings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> directly to the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ters</HI> of &s;aid Col|lege. For 3. The <HI>Founder</HI> and his Heirs MUST be the Vi&s;itors of a College, that is a <HI>lay</HI> Corporation, if he appoints no Vi&s;itor to it himself.&mdash;Though Corporations for publick Governmennt as Cities, Towns, &amp;c. have no Visitors, yet chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt</HI> affirms of private Societies founded on the Score of Charity (as he &s;ays all Colleges <HI>are</HI>) that <Q>Where there is a Corporation, as a <HI>College</HI> or Ho&s;pital, there <HI>mu&s;t</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Vi&s;itors (Tit, <HI>Vi&s;itors</HI>)</Q> A College <HI>cannot</HI> BE without a Vi&s;itor, &s;ays <HI>Ayliff.</HI> Page 74. <Q>It is not <HI>at the Plea|&s;ure</HI> of the Founder whether there <HI>&s;hall be</HI> a Vi&s;itor or not. Page 76." A Vi&s;itor &s;ays <HI>Holt,</HI> is of <HI>Nece&s;&s;i|ty</HI> by Law!&mdash;This Power was not introduced by <HI>Canons</HI> or Con&s;titutions eccle&s;i&s;tical; but is an <HI>Appoint|ment i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Law;</HI> it ari&s;es from the Property which the <HI>Founder</HI> had in the Lands given &amp;c. and as HE is the <HI>Author</HI> of the Charity, the <HI>Law</HI> gives HIM and his HEIRS a vi&s;itatorial Power</Q> (Tit. <HI>Vi&s;itors</HI>) Thus this Right has a nece&s;&s;ary Exi&s;tence. 'Tis originally in the Founder and <HI>Will</HI> de&s;cend to his Heirs if he appoint <HI>No</HI> Vi&s;itor him&s;elf. Herein Dr. <HI>Ayliff</HI> and a greater than the Dr, are expre&s;s. <Q>If there be no particular Vi&s;itor appointed by the <HI>Founder's</HI> Statutes, the Law appoints the <HI>Founder</HI> and his <HI>Heirs</HI> to be Vi&s;itors. Thus <HI>Ayliff</HI> Page 76. In a Word, "The LAW doth in <HI>Defect</HI> of a particular Ap|pointment, make the <HI>Founder</HI> Vi&s;itor. If HE is &s;ilent during his own Time, the Right will de&s;cend to his HEIRS.</Q> Thus <HI>Holt</HI> on Vi&s;itors. And after him what Need of further Evidence.</P>
<P>And now the only remaining Que&s;tion is, "Whether the Court who founded Harvard College <HI>ever did</HI> appoint a Vi&s;itor to it? If not; Then from all the&s;e Authorities, this Right will de&s;cend to every <HI>&s;ucceeding</HI> A&s;&s;embly <HI>as</HI> Heir. And that College <HI>cannot</HI> BE without the Court as Vi&s;itors" yea GREAT <HI>and</HI> GENERAL as the COURT <HI>is,</HI> yet in all Humility let it be &s;aid that <Q>it is not <HI>at the Plea&s;ure</HI> of that Court whether they <HI>&s;hall be</HI> Vi&s;itors or not</Q>&mdash;for in this Ca&s;e the Court is <Q>Vi&s;itor of <HI>Nece&s;&s;i|ty</HI> by Law.</Q> But that the Court never appointed any Vi&s;itor, appears from the Laws of 42 and 50 which are the <HI>only</HI> Laws in which 'twas ever pretended that Vi&s;itors were appointed. The Name <HI>Vi|&s;itor</HI> or the Terms <HI>Vi&s;itation, Vi&s;itatorial</HI> &amp;c. do not once occur in the&s;e Laws. Now <HI>Ayliff</HI> (Page 74. 5)
<PB N="36" REF="005041_0035_10168DB45A4BAC98">makes it &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for "a Vi&s;itor to be <HI>appointed</HI> and <HI>named</HI> &s;uch by the Founder in <HI>expre&s;s</HI> Terms" that he even labours to prove that <Q>by the De&s;cription of &s;uch a Power given to any Per&s;ons they are cre|ated Vi&s;itors, whether expre&s;ly <HI>&s;tiled</HI> &s;uch in the Founder's Statutes or not. Becau&s;e otherwi&s;e, &s;ays he, the giving &s;uch a Power would be vain and the Clau&s;e u&s;ele&s;s</Q> &s;ince none therefore are &s;tiled or appoin|ted Vi&s;itors by <HI>Name</HI> in the&s;e Laws, let the Powers <HI>granted</HI> in them be con&s;idered and compared with that of Vi&s;itation as de&s;cribed by <HI>Ayliff</HI> and chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt.</HI> To begin then with the Law of 42 which appointed Over&s;eers to Harvard College <HI>before</HI> it was incorporated. And here 1. Vi&s;itors are <HI>not</HI> the &s;tated Legi&s;lative or executive Power of a College; but are appointed by the Founder to &s;ee that tho&s;e, who are &s;uch, do their Duty. But by the Law of 42, <HI>before</HI> there was a Corporation, the Over&s;eers them&s;elves were the <HI>only</HI> &s;tated and ordinary Power to make Laws and Orders for the College. By this then they are not de&s;cribed as having a Power of Vi&s;itation, nor would the <HI>Power</HI> given them to make Laws and Orders <HI>be vain</HI> and <HI>the Clau&s;e u&s;ele&s;s</HI> though they were not Vi&s;itors&mdash;Unle&s;s that College was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be governed without any Laws and Orders at all! 2. Vi&s;itors are Independet and <HI>Sovereign</HI> in all Ca&s;es where they are Vi&s;itors at all. Thus on Appeals they are the <HI>dernier</HI> Re&s;ort, <Q>Who &s;hall judge them? &mdash;Let their Sentence be <HI>right or wrong,</HI> the Party is <HI>concluded</HI> by it</Q> &s;ays <HI>Holt</HI> on Vi&s;itors. But by the Law of 42 the Over&s;eers in all Ca&s;es of Appeals whatever, made from a Meeting of their Number that was not General <HI>to</HI> a General Meeting of their whole Number, could conclude <HI>Nothing</HI> again&s;t an Apel|lant! For if they did not <HI>rever&s;e</HI> former Judgment, the Party was &s;o far from being <HI>concluded</HI> by i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, that the Over&s;eers them&s;elves were to <HI>&s;tand accountable</HI> to the General Court for it; But a &s;tanding Power over VISITORS to call them <HI>to Account</HI> for their Conduct, and that in the mo&s;t <HI>ordinary</HI> Ca&s;es that could come before them, is &s;uch a <HI>Paradox</HI> as was never heard of in the World! Appeals lie from our infe|rior Courts to the Superior; but even <HI>Inferior</HI> Courts &s;tand not <HI>accountable</HI> to the Superior for their Acts. 'Tis therefore <HI>doubly</HI> ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible that the Over&s;eers &s;hould be Vi&s;itors on this Law. But 3. The great <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of a Vi&s;itor, and the main <HI>End</HI> of his Power, is to &s;ee that the Charity of the Founder is not perverted &s;ays <HI>Ayliff</HI> Page 77. <Q>To prevent all perverting the Charity there is by Law a vi&s;itatorial Power</Q> &s;ays <HI>Holt</HI> on Vi&s;itors. But by the Law of 42 the Over&s;eers were the <HI>very</HI> Per&s;ons who were betru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted with the College-Stock and all Donations to it; &s;o that 'till it can be &s;hewn that this Law appoints them "on their perverting the Charity" to vi&s;it <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> to &s;et in Judgment <HI>upon them&s;elves</HI> for &s;o doing, 'tis to <HI>No</HI> Purpo&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them this Law appoints them Vi&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 4. All Power given the Over&s;eers in the Law of 42 (whether re&s;pecting the College-Stock or the making Statutes Orders or Con&s;titutions for the College) was <HI>abrogated</HI> a few Years after, by the Charter of 50; as has been demon&s;trated (Page 16, 17. of this Paper) both from the Nature of an incorporating Act, end from the expre&s;s Declaration of the General Court that <Q>the FIRST Foundation of that College and the <HI>Govern|ment</HI> thereof had its ORIGINAL from the Act of 50.</Q> So then from the Year 1650 the Over&s;eers were &s;o far from being Vi&s;itors by the Act of 42, that on that Act they could neither be <HI>Vi&s;itors</HI> or <HI>Vi|&s;ited</HI> on ANY Foundation at all! But 5. <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing</HI> the Charter of 50 did not <HI>wholly</HI> &s;uper&s;ede the Act of 42; yet the Argument <HI>Ex Abundanti,</HI> Page 19. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eq.</HI> of this Paper, may be urged as &s;trongly again&s;t a Power of Vi&s;itation in the Over&s;eers, as it may again&s;t <HI>any other</HI> Power of Importance granted to them in this Act; For the Charter of 50 comes <HI>after</HI> this Act, and leaves NO Powers of Importance in it: but ve&s;ts them in the General A&s;&s;embly of <HI>all the Over&s;eers and Society!</HI> &mdash;And now what a VAIN Attempt would it be in any Per&s;ons to &s;truggle through &s;uch a SERIES <HI>of Impo&s;&s;ibilities</HI> in order to &s;ettle a Power of Vi&s;itation on &s;uch a Law?

Why over the <HI>whole</HI> &s;tated Legi&s;lative and Executive Power of the College (for &s;o are ALL Vi&s;itors of Colleges!) And thus the WHOLE Legi&s;lative and executive Power of that College would be Vi&s;itors of the WHOLE Legi&s;lative and Executive Power of that College&mdash;<HI>Wholly</HI> Vi&s;itors and <HI>Wholly</HI> to be vi&s;ited by <HI>them&s;elves.</HI> And &s;o their WHOLE Number to &s;et upon and give Sentence for (or <HI>again&s;t</HI>) their WHOLE Number. Such Ab&s;urdities are too gro&s;s to need any Refutation. Let <HI>One</HI> Con&s;equence of &s;o ab&s;urd an Interpretation of the Charter be mentioned: The only Ground on which <HI>Ayliff</HI> (and even <HI>Holt!</HI>) argues that a Power of Vi&s;itation will exi&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity by Law, is, that they Charity might not be perverted by the incorporated, who have it in their Hands. Now &s;up|po&s;e (what the very End of a vi&s;itatorial Power <HI>obliges</HI> us to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>may</HI> happen) that &s;o great and diffi|cult a Ca&s;e <HI>Should</HI> happen, as that the Corporation &s;hould embezzle the College-Stock or pervert if from its devoted U&s;es;&mdash;How could this Mi&s;chief be prevented! Or how would it be <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> to call the Corporation to an Account for it! When in this very Ca&s;e and by this very Clau&s;e of the Char|ter (if the Corporation with the Over&s;eers <HI>were</HI> Vi&s;itors) the Conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be made by the Corpo|ration <HI>it&s;elf;</HI> and hereon the <HI>more</HI> they embezzled the College-Stock (and &s;o the more they <HI>needed</HI> to be vi&s;ited!) the <HI>le&s;s likely</HI> they would be to make the Conclu&s;ion that they <HI>&s;hould be</HI> vi&s;ited for it&mdash;or with the Over&s;eers to &s;it in Judgment <HI>upon them&s;elves</HI> for &s;o doing&mdash;unle&s;s it were for this <HI>fatal</HI> Purpo&s;s, viz. To vote them&s;elves <HI>innocent,</HI> and &s;o come off Triumphant! For what could be done in &s;uch a Ca&s;e? None of <HI>the&s;e</HI> Vi&s;itors could, BY Charter, make the <HI>Conclu&s;ion</HI> (for the Over&s;eers to <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to) but the Corporation. So that if they &s;hould be <HI>hardy</HI> enough to make &s;uch a Conclu&s;ion (and <HI>&s;tand by it!</HI>) They could go on to make Wa&s;te of the College-Stock, and defy the whole Number of the Honourable and Reverend Over&s;eers to do <HI>their Wor&s;t.</HI> Thus the very <HI>End</HI> for which the Law appoints a Power of Vi&s;itation would be <HI>de&s;troyed,</HI> if this Clau&s;e in the Charter was to be <HI>taken</HI> as de&s;cribing &s;uch a Power given to the Corporation and Over&s;eers. 'Tis Time then to give up this Sen&s;e of the Clau&s;e and with it ALL Thoughts of finding a Power of Vi&s;itation de&s;cribed in the Char|ter: since this, which comes neare&s;t to the De&s;cription of &s;uch a Power, is not and <HI>cannot</HI> be a De&s;crip|tion of it.</P>
<P>And thus it appears, after a thorough Examination, that there is NO Law in which the Founder of this College conveyed this Right of vi&s;iting the &s;ame, <HI>away</HI> to others. And then this Right (<HI>which</HI> MUST <HI>exi&s;t &s;omewhere!</HI>) Can exi&s;t in <HI>None</HI> but the <HI>Founder</HI> and his Heirs; That is, according to chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt,</HI> the COURT in this Ca&s;e is <HI>Vi&s;itor of</HI> NECESSITY <HI>by Law!</HI> &mdash;Thus it is in all Colleges in <HI>England,</HI> when the Founder appoints <HI>no</HI> Vi&s;itor.

The&s;e publick Affronts offered them by that Corporation, the Writer of this Paper has &s;een with his own Eyes and has blu&s;hed to &s;ee what he <HI>could not</HI> help; at the &s;ame Time that he has trembled at what might follow on their thus treating the LEGISLATURE! &mdash; A Legi&s;lature who gave them their BE|ING at <HI>fir&s;t;</HI> and by who&s;e Bounty <HI>annually</HI> continued to them, they have <HI>Sub&s;i&s;ted</HI> ever Since!</P>

The Writer of this Paper (who in Times pa&s;t has been concerned in placing many a College <HI>Cla&s;s</HI>) was &s;o weary of the Injuries done to particular Per&s;ons herein, that he at Length freely and publickly told the Pre&s;ident and Fellows that <Q>he could not in Con&s;cience have any Thing to do with &s;uch Matters as they had been managed; it appearing to him that there was no RULE by which a <HI>Cla&s;s</HI> could be placed, but what (on &s;ome View or other) was acted <HI>backward</HI> and <HI>forward</HI> upon, almo&s;t every Year&mdash;And &s;ometimes in placing <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Cla&s;s; And that if they <HI>in&s;i&s;ted</HI> on his acting with them in this Affair, he mu&s;t <HI>in&s;i&s;t</HI> upon it to enter his Prote&s;t <HI>with Rea&s;ons</HI> and numerous <HI>Examples</HI> that he could produce; and would refe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the whole Matter to the Over&s;eers and Corporation.</Q> On which his Brethren in the Govern|ment of the College cho&s;e <HI>not to in&s;i&s;t</HI> on his acting with them in this Article; and from that Time forward went on <HI>without</HI> him.&mdash;And indeed the Matter is <HI>flagrant.</HI> There is &s;carce a Family of Note in the Country but what have had Inju&s;tice done them on <HI>this</HI> Account. 'Tis but their look|ing over the printed Catalogues and they may find where the Names of their abu&s;ed <HI>Parents</HI> or abu&s;ed <HI>Selves</HI> or abu&s;ed <HI>Son<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> or <HI>Relatives</HI> &s;tand for a publick and la&s;ting Mark of Infamy on their Families. Even the Sons of Governours! And Sons of Councellours! <HI>After</HI> the Parents have been rai&s;ed to the&s;e High Stations, are found placed <HI>beneath</HI> the Sons of tho&s;e who were only teaching Elders.

With what Face can any Per&s;on vindicate &s;o &s;candalous an Act as that of placing him below &s;o many Sons of teaching Elders, and of others, in a publick <HI>printed</HI> Catalogue to be &s;pread over the whole Land! 'Tis &s;urprizing that &s;uch Numbers of Gentlemen in the Country, who have &s;uffered the&s;e Indignities, can <HI>pa&s;&s;ively</HI> bear them without &s;eeking Redre&s;s;&mdash;Or at <HI>lea&s;t</HI> not enquire "Whether the Acts of the Pre&s;ident and Fellows are <HI>Final</HI> in this Ca&s;e?
