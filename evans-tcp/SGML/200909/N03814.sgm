<P>THE Glory of the <HI>LORD</HI> &s;hall endure forever, the <HI>LORD</HI> &s;hall rejoice in his Works.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Glory of the LORD in his Works of Creation and Provi|dence, but more e&s;pecially the latter, is the Subject of this high and lofty <HI>P&s;alm.</HI> The <HI>Style</HI> and Strain of it perfectly agrees to the &s;tately Subject. "It is a noble <HI>Poem,</HI> e&s;teem'd by very competent Judges, far to excel all that the Wit and Devotion of Man has ever wrote upon the <HI>Dominion</HI> of GOD manife&s;t in the Works of Nature;
<PB N="6" REF="004695_0005_100DBADBD2AC6540">
if we only con&s;ider it in the Brightne&s;s of Ideas and Ornaments of Diction."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HENRY's <HI>Expo&s;.</HI></NOTE> It begins with giving <HI>Glory</HI> in the highe&s;t; <HI>O</HI> LORD <HI>my</HI> GOD, <HI>thou art very Great, thou art clothed with Honour and Maje&s;ty; who covere&s;t thy &s;elf with Light as with a Garment!</HI> And it draws to a clo&s;e with my Text, "<HI>The Glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>&s;hall endure forever, the</HI> LORD <HI>&s;hall rejoice in his Works.</HI></P>
<P>Or it may be read as a <HI>Prayer,</HI> the <HI>Hebrew</HI> being in the Imperative <HI>Mood, Let</HI> the Glory of the LORD endure forever; <HI>Let the Lord rejoice in his Works.</HI> q. d. "<HI>Amen,</HI> O LORD mo&s;t great and gracious! It <HI>is</HI> &s;o, it <HI>will</HI> be &s;o, and ever <HI>may</HI> it be! <HI>Let</HI> the whole Earth ever give thee Glory.</P>
<P>Every way the Words breathe a mo&s;t fervent <HI>Dox|ology,</HI> upon the Contemplation and Recitation of the glorious Work of GOD thro' the <HI>Univer&s;e,</HI> and expre&s;s a raptrous <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> to Him thereon; "O may the LORD have <HI>Glory</HI> from us, and <HI>Joy</HI> in all his Creatures; and never more be <HI>grieved,</HI> as He once was, that he had <HI>made Man upon the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>But the Words are <HI>more</HI> than a Prayer: They are an <HI>Affirmation</HI> of what ever was, is and &s;hall be: "Thy <HI>Glory</HI> &s;hall endure to Eternity, and thy <HI>Joy</HI> in all thy Works, in thy <HI>own</HI> unchangeable <HI>Complacency</HI> in them, which is infinitely more than all the <HI>Ado|rations</HI> of Angels and Saints on the Account of 'em, for ever and ever.</P>
<P>It is only the latter Part of the <HI>Text</HI> I &s;hall di&s;|cour&s;e of, and to be &s;ure in a poor and <HI>low</HI> manner, on &s;o <HI>high</HI> a Subject, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>&s;hall rejoice in his Works.</HI></P>
<P>The Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and Glory here a&s;crib'd to GOD, is <HI>Joy.</HI> Glory and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, cannot be without Joy. They are e&s;&s;ential to and in&s;eparable from each other:
<PB N="7" REF="004695_0006_100DBADD5A959290">And GOD is the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate</HI> in this, be|cau&s;e his <HI>Joy</HI> is perfect in <HI>all</HI> his Works. Never did King or Saint come near to this, no not <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his Glory. He wrote <HI>Vanity</HI> of Vanities on his great Works, for he err'd and &s;inn'd in his doing and u&s;ing them. GOD's Works are all perfect; <HI>"They are Verity and Judgment, and are done in Truth and Uprightne&s;s";</HI> and the King of Glory has a perfect <HI>Joy</HI> in the Perfection of them all; his Works of <HI>Creation, Providence</HI> and <HI>Grace.</HI> A perfect Wi&s;dom, Holine&s;s, Goodne&s;s, Munificence, Benediction &s;hines forth in them; &s;o that ineffable, perfect, infinite <HI>Joy</HI> mu&s;t be the con&s;tant Re&s;ult. It can be no otherwi&s;e for ever and ever. It mu&s;t be <HI>without Variablene&s;s or Shadow of Change.</HI> The invariable Cau&s;e and Rea&s;on mu&s;t have an invariable Effect. Perfectne&s;s is the Cau&s;e, Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and Fulne&s;s of Joy is the Re|&s;ult. There can be neither Addition or Diminution.</P>
<P>Altho' my <HI>Text</HI> leads me more particularly to the Con&s;ideration of GOD's Works of <HI>Providence,</HI> yet I will &s;ay &s;omething al&s;o of the Work of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Redemption.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. GOD ever had, hath and will have a Divine ineffable <HI>Joy</HI> in his Work of <HI>Creation;</HI> in all and every Part of it.</P>
<P>How <HI>manifold</HI> the&s;e are, we may &s;ee thro' the <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> which in&s;tances in GOD's making the <HI>Angels,</HI> &s;tretching forth the <HI>Heavens,</HI> laying the Foundation of the <HI>Earth,</HI> covering it with the <HI>Deep,</HI> filling it with <HI>Springs</HI> of Water, clothing it with <HI>Gra&s;s</HI> and <HI>Trees,</HI> the Food of the <HI>Cattle,</HI> and the Dwelling of the <HI>Fowl.</HI></P>
<P>At the <HI>Creation</HI> of all the&s;e, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> tells us how GOD expre&s;&s;ed his divine Joyes; He &s;aw 'em all to be <HI>very good,</HI> perfect in their Kind, and he <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> them, re&s;ted and in&s;tituted the weekly <HI>Sabbath;</HI> a holy perpetual <HI>Re&s;t</HI> to Man: &mdash;How could <HI>Compla|cency</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="004695_0007_100DBAE1058E2268">and <HI>Joy</HI> be more expre&s;&s;ed? No wonder that all his <HI>Angels &s;ang together,</HI> and all the <HI>Sons of GOD</HI> in one World and other <HI>&s;houted for Joy.</HI> Job. xxxviii. 7. They &s;aw the <HI>Joy</HI> of GOD in every Thing that was made, and <HI>far</HI> into the Rea&s;ons of it. But GOD only comprehends his own Work, and <HI>his</HI> Joy tran&s;cends theirs infinitely, as does his Knowledge and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> was the Joy of his GOD, in the Day of his Creation: <HI>Let us make Man in our Image, after our Likene&s;s, and let him have Dominion.</HI> GOD made an <HI>Eden</HI> for him, put him into the <HI>Garden</HI> of Plea&s;ure, and fill'd him with <HI>Joys</HI> in his holy and happy State. To give <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Being, mu&s;t be an unknown <HI>Joy</HI> to to him that gave it.</P>
<P>When we &s;ee but a little into the Works of GOD, O what a <HI>Joy</HI> does it give us?

When we go down to the <HI>Sea</HI> in Ships, and the <HI>Dol|phin</HI> or the <HI>Whale</HI> play about us; &mdash; <HI>There is that Leviathan!</HI> Or be it the more terrible <HI>Crocodile</HI> near the Shore, with the <HI>Things creeping innumerable both &s;mall and great Bea&s;ts,</HI> whereof our <HI>Context</HI> &s;ings: How do the Silver <HI>Shoals</HI> glitter on the Hook or in the Net as we draw them up!</P>

<P N="2">II.

<P>I might go into particulars, if there were any End of them, and &s;peak of the perpetual <HI>Joyes</HI> which the LORD <HI>mo&s;t High</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have in the daily and annual Cour&s;e of the <HI>Sun,</HI> or of the Planets in their Revolutions and Circles about it; whereby Heat and Life, Light, Food and <HI>Joy,</HI> is pre&s;erved in them all; and all our <HI>precious Things are put forth,</HI> Gra&s;s for the <HI>Cattel,</HI> and Herbs for the &s;ervice of <HI>Man,</HI> and <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Oil</HI> to make <HI>glad</HI> his Heart and his Face to &s;hine. Nor does the LORD <HI>of all</HI> overlook the <HI>Life</HI> that is mo&s;t <HI>below ours: "He knows all the Bea&s;ts of the Mountains, and the Cattel upon a thou&s;and Hills,</HI> are His! and almo&s;t all for <HI>Us,</HI> O <HI>we</HI> of little Ob&s;ervation and Gratitude! &mdash; But how <HI>va&s;t</HI> mu&s;t <HI>His</HI> Satisfaction be, in his va&s;t Provi&s;ions for us Daily? "<HI>His Thoughts are very deep,</HI> while the <HI>bruti&s;h Man knows not, nor the Fool under&s;tands</HI> any of them.
