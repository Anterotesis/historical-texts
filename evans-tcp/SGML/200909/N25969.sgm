<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AS the following pages may po&s;&s;ibly be read by per&s;ons who are unacquainted with the mer|its of the tran&s;actions, therein alluded to, which have occurred at Norwich, in the State of Con|necticut, it may not be ami&s;s to give a brief &s;tatement of the &s;ame. It is generally known that &s;ince the commencement of the pre&s;ent war in Europe, the trade of America has been ex|tended beyond any former example. This in|crea&s;e of trade has occa&s;ioned a great demand
<PB N="iv" REF="034537_0003_0FFDC6F9445FE368">
for money; and although many Banks have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, in different parts of the conti|nent, their funds have not been &s;ufficient to an|&s;wer the demands of the Merchants. In con|&s;equence of this deficiency, recour&s;e has been had to rich individuals, who, thinking their money, like merchandi&s;e, &s;hould bear a price in proportion to the demand for it, have, I un|der&s;tand, purcha&s;ed Notes and Bills of Ex|change, at 3, 4 and 5 per cent per month di&s;|count, in the large towns, &s;uch as Philadelphia, New-York and Bo&s;ton. This practice has, on a &s;maller &s;cale, extended to &s;ome of the more in|con&s;iderable places, and, among the re&s;t, to Norwich; where notes have, it &s;eems, been purcha&s;ed at a di&s;count of 2 per cent per month. This de&s;perate &s;ituation of money affairs has alarmed &s;ome of the <HI>good</HI> citizens of Connecti|cut to a very con&s;iderable degree; in&s;omuch that at Norwich, and, I am informed, at anoth|er place in Hartford County, (the only places in the United States, or in the world, I believe, that ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch worthy guardians of the publick weal,) &s;ocieties have been formed to cru&s;h this alarming evil, as it is called, by means of the Statute again&s;t U&s;ury. The So|ciety
<PB N="v" REF="034537_0004_0FFE2013AA864AA0">
at Norwich is headed by a Mr. Eli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Hyde, an Attorney, who&s;e common Informer is a per&s;on of the name of Cyrus Bi&s;hop. The Deputy Informers of the Society are a Mr.&mdash;Ames, (not the honourable Mr. Ames, Reader,) Mr. Bi&s;&s;el, Mr. Davi&s;on, &amp;c. There are &s;everal per&s;ons belonging to the Society who&s;e names I do not know; but I am told they are people who are not of a de&s;cription to have much to do with either buying or &s;elling of Notes: This circum&s;tance, however, proves them to be the mo&s;t proper men in the world for the bu&s;ine&s;s they have engaged in; they being perfectly di&s;intere&s;ted&mdash;for although they laid informations, again&s;t different gentlemen, to the amount of about four thou&s;and Dollars, one half of which was to come to them, if they &s;uc|ceeded, they meant to pocket their own two thou&s;and Dollars, merely for the publick good.</P>
<P>ONE of the&s;e cau&s;es came to a hearing before the City Court in the month of January la&s;t. It was then contended by the Coun&s;el for the Defendant, that the action was brought before a wrong Court, the City not having authority to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y cau&s;es of that nature. The members of
<PB N="vi" REF="034537_0005_0FFE1FCE29077AA0">
the City Court, actuated no doubt by the pur|e&s;t motives, decided that they were competent to try this cau&s;e: but from their deci&s;ion the Defendent appealed to the Superior Court. In March la&s;t the Superior Court &s;at at Norwich, and the Judges decided that the City Court had no juri&s;diction of the cau&s;e, it being the province of the County Court to try it. This determination of the Judges of cour&s;e annulled all the writs that had been i&s;&s;ued by Mr. Hyde, who had to pay co&s;ts and begin <HI>de novo.</HI> But with what mu&s;cles &s;hall I relate the cata&s;trophe of this great affair! When Mr. Hyde's new writs arrived, (the morrow after this determi|nation of the Judges,) it was di&s;covered that the Defendants had all been &s;upplied with oth|er writs the evening before! and the wor&s;t part of the bu&s;ine&s;s is, there is great room to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome of their friends have &s;tepped in be|tween them and the Society, and demanded the 4000 Dollars in que&s;tion. I hear that on this occa&s;ion the &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;may of Mr. Bi&s;hop was equal to that of Par&s;on Adams, when he fell from his imaginary throne into a Tub of Water. Nor was that of Mr. Hyde exceeded, when the weighty hand of Mr. Dag|geu fell, like thunder, on the table of the

Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, and he &s;aid "Sit down Mr. Hyde."</P>
<P>SUCH is the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the bu&s;ine&s;s. What will be the final i&s;&s;ue of it is more than I can determine. I &s;hall however proceed to enquire what the end of it ought to be.</P>

<HEAD>CURSORY REMARKS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE attention of the people of America, from &s;ome of the be&s;t to the ba&s;e&s;t, from the Governor and Legi&s;lature of New-York, to the Connecticut Societies, having lately been turned, in a con&s;iderable degree, to the &s;ubject of U&s;ury, it has been a matter of &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e to me to ob&s;erve, that no one has undertaken a thorough inve&s;tigation of the principles of U&s;ury laws. In order to promote inquiry on the &s;ubject, I &s;hall take leave to offer a few cur|&s;ory remarks relative to it, in hopes that &s;ome per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing better information, may be

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>On the Hi&s;tory of U&s;ury Laws.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LAWS again&s;t U&s;ury have been made in many countries. Probably that of Mo&s;es (Deut. xxiii. 19, 20,) was one of the fir&s;t. The Intere&s;t of Money was fixed at 12 <HI>per cent|um per annum,</HI> by the Roman Decemvirs, and that law exi&s;ted till the time of Ju&s;tinian. The character of Ju&s;tinian exhibited the paradoxical
<PB N="11" REF="034537_0009_0FFE201C4A015EF0" MS="y">
extremes of avarice and profu&s;ion. The di&s;|order of his finances was &s;uch as would hardly admit of being remedied; but in order to im|prove them, he reduced the Intere&s;t of money to 4 <HI>per cent. per ann.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pandects (l.</HI> 22. <HI>tit.</HI> 1, 2,) <HI>and Code</HI> (l. 4. <HI>tit.</HI> 32, 33.)</NOTE> In &s;ome ca&s;es indeed he allowed 6 <HI>per cent.</HI> and merchants and manu|facturers were permitted to pay 8 per cent. be|cau&s;e among them the ri&s;que was greater; but &s;uch per&s;ons as were the mo&s;t likely to lend to him&s;elf were not to have more than 4 <HI>per cent.</HI></P>
<P>THE In&s;titutes, Pandects and Code of Ju&s;ti|nian have been the Scriptures from which the Engli&s;h Civilians have drawn their legal know|ledge. From them they probably got the idea of laws again&s;t U&s;ury. In England there was very little trade before the &s;ixteenth century, and, con&s;equently there was not much money in circulation. Scarcity of money always has a tendency to rai&s;e the Intere&s;t of it; &s;uch at lea&s;t was the ca&s;e in England; for from the time of Edward 3d, to that of Henry 7th, and indeed for &s;everal centuries, the Jews and Lom|bards, who had money to lend to the Barons, and others, on per&s;onal &s;ecurity, could make
<PB N="12" REF="034537_0010_0FFE1FD6D246F480">
from 45 to 50 per cent. for if. Henry the 8th was an avaricious man who wanted to borrow money cheap, and as he could oblige the Par|liament to do ju&s;t what he plea&s;ed, he got a law pa&s;&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">37 <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 9.</NOTE> to fix the rate of Intere&s;t at 10 per cent. This was the fir&s;t Engli&s;h U&s;ury law, and this law was repealed by the Parliament of Edward 6th, which declared the law it&s;elf to be "unlawful, and mo&s;t impious." The Statute of Henry, was, however renewed by Elizabeth (13. c. 8.) who had it declared, in the pream|ble to the Act of Parliament, that U&s;ury was forbidden by the law of God, and con&s;equent|ly was unlawful. James 1&s;t, (c. 17) reduced the intere&s;ts of money to 8 per cent, and the Rump Parliament lowered it to 6 per cent. This rate of intere&s;t was fixed in New-England, and, I &s;uppo&s;e has continued &s;o ever &s;ince; a law of the Rump Parliament, having been con&s;idered as of equal authority with both law and go&s;pel, by many of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of Ma&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">chu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. That act of the Rump Parliament was confirmed by Charles 2d. (c. 13) who wanted large &s;ums of money to &s;upport the licentiou&s; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s and debaucheries of his court, and his fooli&s;h wars again&s;t the Dutch. He
<PB N="13" REF="034537_0011_0FFE201F2743A6A8">
Indeed endeavoured to reduce the rate of Inter|e&s;t &s;till lower, and employed Sir Thomas Cul|pepper, and others, to publi&s;h pamphlets on the &s;ubject; but the parliaments of tho&s;e times were not &s;o manageable as &s;ome which had met before. Anne carried on a very expen&s;ive con|tinental war, and in order to rai&s;e money on better terms, the parliament pa&s;&s;ed a law (12 Ann. St. 2. c. 16.) which fixed legal intere&s;t at 5 per cent. and enacted that whoever took more &s;hould forfeit treble the money borrowed. That &s;tatute, although &s;o gro&s;sly unju&s;t, is now in force in England, but almo&s;t the only purpo&s;e it an&s;wers is to di&s;tre&s;s &s;uch people as cannot give good &s;ecurity, by putting it out of their power to borrow money. The U&s;ury laws in England have been made &s;ometimes under a pretence of religion, but in reality they have always been made with a view to enable the go|vernment to get as much money as po&s;&s;ible from the people, on the cheape&s;t terms. The govern|ment however cannot now borrow money at 5 per cent. or any thing like it. The mini&s;ter cannot get more than about &pound; 45 for &pound; 100 of 3 per cent Annuities, and the Navy, Victualling and Tran&s;port Bills, &amp;c. are at &s;uch a di&s;count as makes the intere&s;t on them equal to about
<PB N="14" REF="034537_0012_0FFE1FD85746F430">
15 per cent. The mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed men in England prefer government &s;ecurity to any other, and as much more than legal intere&s;t can be got for that &s;ecurity, per&s;ons in trade who often want to borrow money, cannot now get any for the paltry con&s;ideration <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 5 per cent; they are therefore obliged to go without money, as a larger intere&s;t cannot be taken with &s;afety. This &s;tate of things has made the money-bor|rowers clamorous for a repeal of the U&s;ury Laws, and if the government can find re&s;our|ces by forced loans, or any better method than borrowing, tho&s;e laws will doubtle&s;s be repealed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>On the connexion between Religion &amp; U&s;ury Laws.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOME Law-makers have pretended, and many religious people believe, that it is contra|ry to the Chri&s;tian religion to take more than a
<PB N="15" REF="034537_0013_0FFE2020AD41A9B0">
certain &s;um for the u&s;e or intere&s;t of money. This opinion is taken from the law of Mo&s;es, (Deut. xxiii. 19, 20.) which &s;ays, <HI>Thou &s;halt not lend upon u&s;ury to thy brother; u&s;ury of mo|ney, u&s;ury of victuals, u&s;ury of any thing that is lent upon u&s;ury. Unto a &s;tranger thou maye&s;t lend upon u&s;ury, but unto thy brother thou &s;halt not lend upon u&s;ury.</HI> Now, whatever Chri&s;tian carefully examines this pa&s;&s;age, he will find that the law was not intended for any other people than the Jews; it was to bind them in their tran&s;actions between each other only, but like the re&s;t of their laws and ceremonies, was not extended to either Heathens or Chri&s;tians, and even a Jew was allowed to take u&s;ury of any per&s;on who was not a Jew. Religious men may, however, be di&s;po&s;ed to he&s;itate about be|lieving me on this occa&s;ion; I will therefore produce the authority of the learned and Rev|erend Archdeacon Paley, who was as religious as the be&s;t of them. He &s;ays <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Philo&s;ophy, p.</HI> 158, 159.</NOTE> <Q>There exi&s;ts no rea&s;on in the law of nature why a man &s;hould not be paid for the lending of his mo|ney, as well as of any other property into which the money might be converted.</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="16" REF="034537_0014_0FFE1FDB31F5FA60">
<P>THE &s;cruples that have been entertained upon this head, and upon the foundation of which the receiving of Intere&s;t or U&s;ury (for they formerly meant the &s;ame thing) was once prohibited in almo&s;t all Chri&s;tian coun|tries, aro&s;e from a pa&s;&s;age of the law of Mo|&s;es, Deut. xxiii. 19, 20.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quoted above.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS prohibition is now generally under|&s;tood to have been intended for the Jews a|lone, as part of the political or civil law of that nation, and calculated to pre&s;erve among&s;t them&s;elves that di&s;tribution of property, to which many of their laws were &s;ub&s;ervient; as the marriage of an heire&s;s within her own Tribe; of a widow who was left childle&s;s to her hu&s;bands brother; the year of Jubilee, when alienated e&s;tates reverted to the family of the original proprietor&mdash;regulations which were never thought to be binding upon any but the commonwealth of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>THIS interpretation is confirmed, I think beyond all controver&s;y, by the di&s;tinction made in the law between a Jew and a foreign|er, <Q>unto a &s;tranger thou maye&s;t lend upon
<PB N="17" REF="034537_0015_0FFE2024E5232038">
u&s;ury, but unto thy brother thou maye&s;t not &s;end upon U&s;ury</Q> a di&s;tinction which could hardly have been admitted into a law, which the di|vine Author intended to be of moral and ;univer&s;al obligation.</P></Q>
<P>BUT left the con&s;ciences of Religious men &s;hould not be quieted, or their doubts removed by the Divine, I will produce the te&s;timony of a Lawyer, who&s;e opinion is not often controver|ted; I mean that of Judge Black&s;tone. He &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commentary, Vol. 2. p. <HI>455</HI> and &s;equel.</NOTE> <Q>The enemies to intere&s;t in general make no di&s;tinction between that and U&s;ury, hold|ing any increa&s;e of money to be indefen&s;ibly u&s;urious. And this they ground as well on the prohibition by the law of Mo&s;es among the Jews, as al&s;o upon what is laid down by Ari&s;totle<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pelit. l. <HI>1,</HI> c. <HI>10.</HI></NOTE>, that money is naturally barren, and to make it breed money is prepo&s;terous, and a perver&s;ion of the end of its in&s;titution, which was only to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of ex|change, and not of increa&s;e. Hence the &s;chool divines have branded the practice of taking Intere&s;t, as being contrary to the di|vine law both natural and revealed; and the
<PB N="18" REF="034537_0016_0FFE1FE0C6832510">
canon law has pro&s;cribed the taking any, the lea&s;t, increa&s;e for the loan of money as <HI>a mor|tal &s;in.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>BUT in an&s;wer to this it may be ob&s;erved, that the Mo&s;aical precept was clearly a polit|ical, and not a moral precept. It only pro|hibited the Jews from taking u&s;ury from their brethren the Jews; but in expre&s;s words permitted them to take it of a &s;tranger: which proves that the taking of moderate U|&s;ury, or a reward for the u&s;e, for &s;o the word &s;ignifies, is not <HI>malum in &s;e,</HI> &s;ince it was al|lowed where any but an I&s;raelite was concern|ed. And as to Ari&s;totle's rea&s;on, deduced from the natural barrenne&s;s of money, the &s;ame may with equal force be alledged of hou&s;es, which never breed hou&s;es; and twenty other things, which nobody doubts it is lawful to make profit of by letting them to hire.</Q></P>
<P>THESE authorities and arguments will I pre|&s;ume be &s;ufficient to convince any man that there is no connexion at all between Religion and U&s;ury. No wonder however that many men are now puzzled on the &s;ubject, as that is
<PB N="19" REF="034537_0017_0FFE2027C59C0130">
no more than has happened before to Ari&s;totle, Cato, Seneca and Plutarch among the heathens; to Cyprian, Lanctantius, Ba&s;il, Chry&s;o&s;tom, Gregory, Ambro&s;e, Jerom, Augu&s;tin and Shake&s;peare, and other ca&s;ui&s;ts, with whole councils among the Chri&s;tians. The Parlia|ment of James I. in&s;erted in his U&s;ury law, which allowed 8 <HI>per cent.</HI> intere&s;t, <Q>that this Statute &s;hall not be con&s;trued or expounded to allow the practice of U&s;ury <HI>in point of re|ligion or con&s;cience.</HI></Q> And the learned Bi&s;h|op Sander&s;on determined that <Q>to take &s;ix in the hundred is &s;abbath breaking, becau&s;e the plow goes on Sundays.</Q> If all the&s;e ab|&s;urdities were to be admitted as authorities, eve|ery man who receives intere&s;t of any kind &s;hould be denominated a U&s;urer, and it mu&s;t be believed, that he who receives only 6 per cent breaks the Sabbath by &s;o doing: indeed there are very few ab&s;urdities which &s;ome of the above named writers have not maintained. Now I not only differ with them all, after the example of Paley and Black&s;tone, but I go far|ther. I mean plainly and unequivocally to a&s;&s;ert, that &s;o far from being conformable to religion, the exi&s;ting U&s;ury laws are contrary
<PB N="20" REF="034537_0018_0FFE1FE261DFDC18">
to the &s;pirit of both the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian religions. The utmo&s;t extent of the law of Mo&s;es goes no farther than <HI>an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth</HI>&mdash;that is make good what you have taken wrongfully; if you have taken U&s;ury of a brother re&s;tore it&mdash;but the law a|gain&s;t U&s;ury &s;ays you &s;hall forfeit both princi|pal and intere&s;t: which is at the rate of all your teeth and eyes for one. The go&s;pel directs that <HI>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do un|to you, do ye even &s;o to them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. vii. <HI>12.</HI></NOTE>. Now &s;uppo&s;e any one of the&s;e religious men &s;hould have charged 6, 12, or 18 per cent more than is al|lowed by law, would they wi&s;h, for &s;uch an o|vercharge, to pay &pound; 124? Impo&s;&s;ible! If then they would not chu&s;e to be &s;ubject to this law them&s;elves, how can they de&s;ire to &s;ubject others to it con&s;i&s;tently with this &s;acred rule; which is the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive that ever was was laid down, and contains in it&s;elf a whole body of morality and practical religion. It is di&s;gu&s;ting to hear religious trade&s;men&mdash;Paper-makers, Carpenters, Coopers, Bakers, &amp;c. declaiming again&s;t U&s;ury, and, like the Phari|&s;ee in the Go&s;pel, thanking God that they are
<PB N="21" REF="034537_0019_0FFE202960DEDB20">
not as U&s;urers are&mdash;unju&s;t, covetous and extor|tioners&mdash;they never charged more than 6 <HI>per cent:</HI> whereas the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e is, they make a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and their not hav|ing charged more is &s;olely owing to their not having money to charge upon. They can &s;ee the more in the eye of their brother but not the beam which is in their own eye. For what Pa|per-maker is there who does not, or would not if he could, make 100 per cent profit on every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ag he grinds? What Carpenter would not make as large a profit on every Chai&s;e or oth|er article he &s;ells? Are there not Coopers who ought to be indicted for extortion on every hoop they &s;ell? Bakers too, who condemn U|&s;ury, have not &s;crupled to &s;ell twelve ounces of Bread for &s;ix-pence, and yet the&s;e pious Gen|tlemen take upon them to a&s;&s;ert that they nev|er charged more than 6 per cent. Might it not with propriety and ju&s;tice be &s;aid of them <HI>Thou that judge&s;t another doe&s;t</HI> wor&s;e <HI>things.</HI> If the intere&s;t of money is to be &s;ettled by religi|on, let us have the profits of trade &s;ettled by the &s;ame rule.

<P>THE next thing I propo&s;e to con&s;ider is, the moral tendency of U&s;ury Laws. In this point of view, however, I can &s;ee nothing but a to|tal departure from, and oppo&s;ition to, all the rules of morality, notwith&s;tanding the pream|bles to &s;ome of tho&s;e laws make a whining pro|fe&s;&s;ion of regard to poor debtors. I conceive the morality of trade con&s;i&s;ts in every man ma|king the be&s;t bargain he can, and adhereing with religious exactne&s;s to that bargain; wheth|er he be a buyer or &s;eller, borrower or lender. Now if the rule I have here laid down is right, the non-compliance with an agreement, mu&s;t be a breach of morality. The U&s;ury laws not on|ly &s;anction this breach, but they authorize the mo&s;t outrageous oppo&s;ition to this rule of mor|ality.

They encourage a &s;harper to agree for the payment of more than legal intere&s;t, and that po&s;&s;ibly with a man who does not know that &s;uch laws exi&s;t, and afterwards to cheat him out of the whole &s;um, principal and inter|e&s;t. Indeed they do more for they hold out a lure, and, as it were, invite the &s;harper to com|mit this deliberate piece of villainy; for one half of the money forfeited by the lender, is to go to the informer. Or whole gangs of the&s;e &s;harpers may con&s;pire together for the purpo&s;e of ruining men who po&s;&s;e&s;s more property than them&s;elves; and though they might not ulti|mately &s;ucceed in their wicked de&s;igns, the laws put it in their power to di&s;turb the peace of families, and much better members of &s;ocie|ty than them&s;elves, for a certain time. If &s;uch be morality, then the Robbers of Greece, the Pirates de&s;troyed by Pompey, the plundering Arabs, and the Banditti of Italy were good and moral people.

<PB N="27" REF="034537_0025_0FFE20339A3FBA00">
The law of England, on a conviction of u&s;urious practices, enjoins a forfeiture of three times the amount of the capital loaned. The law of the State of Connecticut al&s;o en|acts that <Q>Every per&s;on who &s;hall take, accept and receive by any way or means, more than Six Dollars for the u&s;e of One Hundred Dollars, for a year, &s;hall forfeit and lo&s;e for &s;uch offence, the full value of the money &s;o lent; one moiety thereof to the public Trea|&s;ury of this State, the other half to the Infor|mer who &s;hall &s;ue for and pro&s;ecute the &s;ame to effect.</Q> Now it will, at fir&s;t &s;ight, be evident to every per&s;on that no man, although he were more learned than Yelverton, or Lit|tleton, or Coke, or Hales, or Black&s;tone, or Mansfield, or all of them together, can ever prove that there is any ju&s;tice in &s;uch mo&s;t hor|rid and barbarous forfeitures.

But admitting there ought to be U&s;ury laws, tho&s;e which now ex|i&s;t appear to be ju&s;t the contrary of what they ought to be; for living is at lea&s;t fifteen times as expen&s;ive now, as it was when the Intere&s;t of money was 10 or 12 per cent. In the 12th Century a fat ox and a meal of bread for an hundred men could be had for two &s;hillings; and twenty hor&s;es might be fed for four pence. In the 13th Century, wheat might be bought for a &s;hilling, and oats for four pence a quarter, a goo&s;e for four pence, a lamb for &s;ix pence, and fowls at a penny for a couple.

Does this look like ju&s;tice?</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;pecies of inju&s;tice which the U&s;u|ry laws &s;anction, is their tolerating a &s;pecies of per&s;ecution again&s;t men of property.

Governor Jay is an enemy to the practice; but he &s;peaks of it in the language of a Gentleman. Very different however is the ca&s;e with the gen|erality of people, and the Societies, who con|ver&s;e on the &s;ubject. They repre&s;ent people who have money to lend as a &s;et of Robbers, Swindlers, Extortioners, and I know not what be&s;ide; and they &s;ucceed in rai&s;ing an odium again&s;t monied men among&s;t unthinking peo|ple,

But if I have money to lend, and another man wi&s;hes to borrow it, &s;urely I have a right to con&s;ider his ability to repay it, the inconvenience I might be put to by lending, the value of money, and to demand intere&s;t accordingly.

That it will do this is proved by a variety of facts, none of which I think is &s;tronger than that of the variation in the price of gold and &s;ilver, according as it is &s;carce or plenty. In China the proportion between gold and &s;ilver is as one to ten, that is, one ounce of gold is worth ten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unces of &s;ilver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;uppo&s;e this is the rea&s;on why merchants &s;end out &s;ilver to China, it being worth near one third more there than it is here.</NOTE>.
<PB N="34" REF="034537_0032_0FFE1FF688451890">
in other parts of the Ea&s;t-Indies, the propor|tion varies from one to eleven, twelve and thir|teen. In ancient Greece it was as one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o thir|teen. In ancient Rome as one to ten, but in the time of Tiberius it ro&s;e to thirteen. Dur|ing the reign of the Monks the variations were greater in extent and almo&s;t infinite in number; but when Columbus fir&s;t di&s;covered America, the proportion was one to twelve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Raynal, Hi&s;t.

From that time the importations of &s;ilver from Mexico and Peru, have been more than a counterpoi&s;e to the gold of Brazil, and it now requires near fifteen ounces of &s;ilver, both in Europe and America, to purcha&s;e an ounce of gold; but at times when &s;ilver has been &s;carce and much demanded, I have known the proportion redu|ced as low as one to twelve, in England. The relative value of gold and &s;ilver being thus clearly proved to be governed by circum&s;tan|ces, there can be little doubt, but the value of money, in general, would always be determi|ned by the quantity, as it ought to be, therefore there can be no nece&s;&s;ity for fixing it by law.</P>
<P>BUT I will mention another fact, which I
<PB N="35" REF="034537_0033_0FFE203F37F07328">
think will &s;ettle the matter beyond di&s;pute. In peaceable times, when money is plenty in Eu|ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, it is never worth more than 3, 4 or 5 per cent. In England particularly, &s;o late as the year 1792, &pound; 100 of Annuities which pay only 3 per cent.

<P>IT is &s;aid by &s;ome that U&s;ury laws are nece&s;|&s;ary to re&s;train the avarice of creditors, who, if their debtors cannot pay them, either advance the intere&s;t or demand &s;omething for forbear|ance; that they are a re&s;traint upon taking ad|vantage of a man's di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, to extort a large intere&s;t from him, and therefore they are politic. But if &s;ome creditors are apt to be hard on debtors, why do they not borrow of other per&s;ons to &s;ave the advance of Intere&s;t, or forbearance money, if they can do it on bet|ter terms? Their not doing &s;o is a &s;ufficient pre&s;umption that they cannot get the money cheaper, or perhaps, on any terms whatever, el&s;ewhere. Again, where a man is in di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances, who, except a very uncommon friend, would &s;tep forward and relieve him from his di&s;tre&s;s, without a pro&s;pect of an advantage which &s;hould be equivalent to the ri&s;k he runs? In this re&s;pect the U&s;ury Law is &s;o far from being politic, that I am convinced many men fall to ruin and decay, becau&s;e no one for 6 <HI>per cent</HI> will advance money to relieve him at

<P>There can be no good policy in a law which countenances a combination of knaves to con|&s;pire the ruin of their more wealthy neighbours and creditors.

FROM what has been &s;aid before, it evidently appears that prohibiting the lending of money is altogether impolitic. The pre&s;ent U&s;ury laws are equal to a prohibition, therefore they mu&s;t be impolitic al&s;o. For what man will now lend to an individual on per&s;onal &s;ecurity at <HI>Six per cent?</HI> The Funds of the Government, the Banks, Turnpike Roads, &amp;c. pay more, where the money can at any time be command|ed, which is not the ca&s;e with individuals. Sup|po&s;e a man lends another man 100 Dollars on a note, he will think him&s;elf well off if he gets the money in calling for it three times. If the note &s;hould be at two months, he will get a Dollar di&s;count (at 6 per cent) and if he has to hire a chai&s;e to go two or three miles, three times, that will co&s;t him nine &s;hillings, &s;o that the buyer of &s;uch a note &s;tands a chance of be|ing half a dollar out of pocket be&s;ides being kept out of his money two or three months, and taking as much trouble as would co&s;t him a dollar or two more if he was to hire a per&s;on to do the bu&s;ine&s;s. As payments are now made it is worth about 2 per cent to collect money, &s;o that it cannot be expected any man in his &s;en|&s;es &s;hould enter into the &s;y&s;tem of lending at 6 per cent. It will therefore be politic for the

<P>ANOTHER circum&s;tance which indicates the good policy of repealing the U&s;ury laws, is their being particularly injurious to certain cla&s;&s;es of individuals. Among the&s;e are &s;ome of the Engli&s;h nobility and gentry who po&s;&s;e&s;s entail|ed E&s;tates, which they cannot either &s;ell or mortgage without an act of Parliament. Per|&s;ons of this de&s;cription might get money for little more than legal intere&s;t if their friends could give legal &s;ecurity for them; but as that cannot be done they are obliged to rai&s;e mon|ey in a very di&s;advantageous way, by <HI>Po&s;t-obit</HI> bonds, or Life Annuities. In the latter ca&s;e a gentleman borrows a certain &s;um of money for life, and mortgages the <HI>rent</HI> of his E&s;tate for the payment of the Intere&s;t, or Life Annui|ty, as it is called. He al&s;o has his life In&s;ur|ed to the amount of the &s;um borrowed, at one of the offices, e&s;tabli&s;hed in London for &s;uch purpo&s;es, and the policy remains with the len|der; who is thereby enabled to recover from
<PB N="48" REF="034537_0046_0FFE2009963FD0E8">
the office the original &s;um loaned, at the death of the borrower. For money borrowed in this way the Intere&s;t and premium of In&s;urance can|not amount to le&s;s than 15 or 18 per <HI>cent. per <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nn.</HI> when money is plenty; yet a tran&s;action of this kind is not adjudged to come within the Statute again&s;t U&s;ury.</P>
<P>BUT there it another and more numerous cla&s;s of men who are much more materially injured by the U&s;ury laws, I mean the poorer fort of trade&s;men. Per&s;ons or Societies who In&s;ure property at &s;ea charge a premium in proportion to the ri&s;k; for example the Premium of In|&s;urance to the We&s;t Indies may now be 20 per cent; but in time of peace would be only two per cent. So if a poor trade&s;man, who is thought in a hazardous &s;ituation, attempts to borrow money he mu&s;t pay 24 <HI>per cent.</HI>&mdash;whereas if he could legally give the &s;ecurity of two or three of his friends, it is probable the lender would rather let him have the money at 8 or 10 per cent, than at 24 or even 30 per cent, and run the ri&s;k of his &s;ingle &s;ecurity and the U&s;ury laws. Such is the difficulty this de&s;cription of men often experience in rai&s;ing money, that they are frequently obliged to &s;end
<PB N="49" REF="034537_0047_0FFE2053921D5058">
their goods into auctions and &s;ell them for hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what they co&s;t. I could produce the example of a man in Norwich who bought a hog&s;head of &s;ugar for 9 Dollars per Cwt. at three months credit, and &s;old the &s;ame for 7 Dollars ready money, in order to rai&s;e a little current ca&s;h. Now &s;uppo&s;ing there was no more than 10 Cwt. of &s;ugar in the hog&s;head, he lo&s;t 20 Dollars by the &s;peculation, whereas if he had borrowed the money, he rai&s;ed, at 2 per cent a month, it would have co&s;t him only 4 Dollars and a frac|tion; and had there been no U&s;ury law &s;o that he could have given legal &s;ecurity, no doubt he could have borrowed the &s;um for two Dol|lars.&mdash;Probably &s;imilar in&s;tances occur daily in larger Towns.</P>
<P>THUS in whatever way I view the U&s;ury Laws, I can find in them neither Religion, Morality, Ju&s;tice, Nece&s;&s;ity or Policy, but they contain abundance of the directly contrary qualities. As men become enlightened, legi&s;|lators will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity for repealing the&s;e laws, as they have already repealed others which were made by the Monki&s;h and gloomy profe&s;&s;ors of religion, in earlier times.

<P>THIS writ, with the exception of the name of the Defendant; is copied <HI>ad literam,</HI> and it will appear that, however legal it may be, it is not very logical. I have &s;een another writ &s;igned by Mr. Hyde which has the following pa&s;&s;age in it.&mdash;<Q>To the Plaintiff the Defen|dant owes, and unju&s;tly detains, whereupon the plaintiff Declares, and &s;ays that within the city afore&s;aid, the Defendant <HI>Loaned and Lent</HI> Six Hundred Dollars to Eliphalet Bulk|ley and William Lee, both then of Colche&s;ter

From the 10th of June to the 30th of Augu&s;t, I conceive, there are eighty-one days: how the Society made it "le&s;s than &s;ixty days" I am at a lo&s;s to imagine. If they calculate no better on general principles than on dates, I &s;u&s;pect they will find them|&s;elves on the wrong &s;ide of the que&s;tion. In|deed at all events I have no &s;cruple about be|lieving that the Society will ultimately find that it has been mi&s;taken. For when the&s;e ca|&s;es come to a full hearing in a court of ju&s;tice, it will appear that they are acting on an entire|ly new &s;y&s;tem; &s;uch as was never heard of, or thought of, before, in any age or country. It will be di&s;covered that in order to a convict|ion
<PB N="58" REF="034537_0056_0FFE2072B74E2078">
the law requires "full evidence." I will not attempt to deny that in &s;ome ca&s;es the per|&s;on who borrowed money at u&s;urious intere&s;t might be admitted as a competent witne&s;s by a court of ju&s;tice; but it is far from being evident that this practice was contemplated by the fra|mers of the Connecticut U&s;ury law. On the contrary there is &s;trong pre&s;umptive evidence of an oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;ition.&mdash;1&s;t. In the clau&s;e (called ob&s;olete by Mr. Swift) which directs Grand-jurors to pre&s;ent &s;uch per&s;ons as are of "Evil name for taking exce&s;&s;ive intere&s;t." Now if the law-makers thought that the evi|dence of a per&s;on who had tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s with the U&s;urer was &s;ufficient, what nece&s;&s;ity was there for this clau&s;e? 2. If a borrower has made a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous contract with a lender, there is a provi&s;o in the Statute, in ca&s;e the borrow|er is pro&s;ecuted for amount of the loan, which enables him, the defendant, to file a bill in equi|ty, whereby the plaintiff is obliged to be exam|ined on oath touching the real &s;um he lent; and he is to receive that &s;um only, without in|tere&s;t: Now if the makers of this law had been of opinion that the evidence of the defendant alone, would be &s;ufficient proof of u&s;urious practices, is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they would
<PB N="59" REF="034537_0057_0FFE206460E9D3B8">
have enacted a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of this nature? 3. The&s;e parts of the law (the pre&s;entment and bill in equity) are to be carried into effect on the evi|dence of "one credible witne&s;s;" but p. 12, it is <Q><HI>Always provided,</HI> That nothing in this act be con&s;trued to prevent any per&s;ons from pro|ceeding upon <HI>full Evidence</HI> in the common cour&s;e of law again&s;t exce&s;&s;ive U&s;ury, and u&s;urious contracts.</Q> Thus there is a clear di&s;tinction made between <Q>one credible wit|ne&s;s,</Q> and "full evidence." This con&s;ider|ation alone I &s;hould think &s;ufficient to prove that the compilers of the U&s;ury Statute had it not in contemplation to admit the evidence of one man, and he a party in the tran&s;action, as <HI>full evidence.</HI> The legi&s;lators of tho&s;e times mu&s;t have known that a law &s;o con&s;trued would occa&s;ion many frauds, there being in all countries men who, for the &s;ake of a reward, would invent or forge a ca&s;e in u&s;ury, and &s;wear that there was u&s;ury in tran&s;actions were none exi&s;ted. They knew very well that there is no method to prevent a man from giving a premium privately on money, becau&s;e every man has a natural right to do &s;o if he chu&s;es it; but it appears to me that the law was only in|tended to prevent the receiving more than le|gal

intere&s;t by cour&s;e of law. I know very lit|tle of the practice of the courts in this country. But in England I believe I can &s;afely a&s;&s;ert, that there never was a conviction on the U&s;ury State on the evidence of an Informer: A man of that de&s;cription would not dare to &s;hew his face on any exchange in that country. No doubt u&s;urious practices are carried on to a con&s;iderable extent in England, but pro&s;ecutions for U&s;ury &s;eldom occur, unle&s;s in ca&s;es of Bankruptcy, or Death; and they do not then occur unle&s;s it can be proved by the clear in|di&s;putable evidence of Deeds, Books, and di&s;|intere&s;ted living witne&s;&s;es; which is there cal|led <HI>full evidence</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The U&s;ury Statute directs that in no ca&s;e whatev|er &s;hall contracts be made for more than <HI>6</HI> pet cent; but the Legi&s;lature of Connecticut has allowed <HI>12 per cent. per annum</HI> to the proprietors of &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bridges and Turn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ike roads in this State&mdash;&s;hould not this operate a virtual repeal of the U&s;ury law?

If the Norwich (Li&s;bon) Society was in England their witne&s;&s;es would not only be thought ineligible, but the mem|bers of the Society them&s;elves would be indict|ed for a con&s;piracy: for &s;uch their a&s;&s;ociating, actually is. When a man voluntarily comes forward with an information on a ca&s;e of U&s;ury,

he it certain of making him&s;elf infamous for the remainder of his life; and few men will run this ri&s;k without a pro&s;pect of con&s;iderable ad|vantage. I under&s;tand the witne&s;&s;es of the So|ciety are to &s;wear that they are totally di&s;inter|e&s;ted; but will any Jury ever believe &s;ome of of them? And even if a credible witne&s;s &s;hould be examined the evidence of one man does not appear to be <HI>full</HI> evidence, and therefore will not warrant the giving of a verdict for the plaintiff. And when it is con&s;idered that the U&s;ury Statute is almo&s;t ob&s;olete; that it is &s;o highly injurious to &s;ociety as it has been proved to be; that Juries ought to do &s;trict ju&s;tice be|tween all parties; and that they are judges of Law as well as of Fact, a Jury ought to be ex|tremely cautious about going into the practice of convictions under this Statute.</P>
<P>SUCH indeed the conduct of Juries generally is in regard to old and barbarous laws. In the cale where a man is killed in a duel the law calls it murder; but if the duel is fought by mutual agreement, and nothing di&s;honourable appears on the part of the &s;urvivor, a Jury al|ways brings it in Man&s;laughter only. Juries in England are generally very &s;crupulous in
<PB N="62" REF="034537_0060_0FFE2075C4B7BF98">
&s;uch ca&s;es, in&s;omuch that I have known a ver|dict of Man&s;laughter brought in when the Judges charged the Jury to find the pri&s;oner guilty of Murder. Two in&s;tances of this come within my own immediate knowledge, namely, on the trials of Mr. Patter&s;on and R. England for killing Gen. Adair, and Mr. Rowles. Lycurgus the Spartan Law-giver, in his code of laws, directed that every child born with any natural defect &s;hould be put to death. Draco decreed that every crime &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death. It was the law, of cu&s;tom, at lea&s;t, among the Poles, &s;o late as the 13th century, to put every old man, who was pa&s;t labour, and every imperfect child to death. And by the laws of France, England and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay, every poor old woman who happened to be troubled with convul&s;ions, St. V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tus's dance, &amp;c. was condemned to be burnt for a witch. In the barbarous times when tho&s;e laws were made, they were carried into execution: but if they exi&s;ted now, and a Jury was impanelled to try a child for being crook|ed, a man for being old, a boy for &s;tealing an apple, or an old woman for having fits, would the Jury condemn the&s;e &s;everal per&s;ons to death on &s;uch accounts? No Jury could be
<PB N="63" REF="034537_0061_0FFDC6F01EC3FA00">
found to do this, whatever the law might &s;ay, in any civilized country; in England &s;uch Laws as are barbarous and unju&s;t are always got rid of by what is called Fictions in law. When the ca&s;es in U&s;ury come to be heard, a Jury will no doubt be puzzled to know how per&s;ons who never had a tran&s;action with Cyrus Bi&s;hop, can be made to owe him 4000 Dol|lars by law. If the law could be made to ap|ply to the ca&s;e, a Jury would &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity for evading it by a fiction; but the Jurors be|fore whom the&s;e cau&s;es are brought will per|ceive that it never was the intention of the law to do more than put it in the power of the per|&s;on aggrieved, or his heirs to injure the U&s;urer; they will learn that very few convictions have ever been had under this Statute; that pro&s;ecu|tions like the&s;e of the Society have never been carried on, or even thought of; and that they cannot either on the principles of Law, Ju&s;tice or Honour, give a verdict for Cyrus Bi&s;hop and Company.</P>
