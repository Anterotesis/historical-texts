</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN the&s;e Words, which contain the In&s;cription of this Epi&s;tle, we have&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. The Writer's Name and Stile. "<HI>Simon Peter,</HI> a Servant and an Apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t."&mdash;It is not, like &s;ome other of the &s;a|cred Epi&s;tles, anonymous: but in the Face of it carries the Penman's Name; as well the additional one his Di|vine Ma&s;ter had put upon him, as that which his Parents had originally given him.&mdash;Al&s;o to contribute Authority and Weight to his Letter, and gain Attention to it, he &s;uperadds a notable Appellative, &s;ignifying his being an in&s;pired Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and &s;ugge&s;ting that he wrote as he was moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.&mdash;But while he claims the Honour of being an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> he does it in &s;uch a Manner as at the &s;ame Time di&s;covers his deep Humili|ty. For he affects not to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by any pompous Characteri&s;ms; as, the Chief of the Apo&s;tles;
<PB N="2" REF="007666_0004_102DBB005106EEB8">
&mdash;the Fir&s;t Apo&s;tle,&mdash;or, the Apo&s;tle of the Circum|ci&s;ion (much le&s;s by tho&s;e vain-glorious Titles, which his pretended Succe&s;&s;or at <HI>Rome</HI> arrogates to him&s;elf; &s;uch as, the univer&s;al Bi&s;hop, Vicar of Chri&s;t, &s;upreme Head of the Church on Earth, or the like) but only calls him&s;elf in &s;imple Terms, <HI>an</HI> Apo&s;tle of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in common with others dignify'd with the &s;ame reverend Appellation. And even this he qualifies, by joining with it that mo&s;t diminutive Title, a <HI>Servant.</HI> Though the Lord had &s;aid to his Apo&s;tles, "Henceforth I call you not <HI>Ser|vants,</HI> but <HI>Friends</HI>"; yet <HI>Peter</HI> mode&s;tly declines the latter, and a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf the former Denomination. Truly he glories in being Chri&s;t's <HI>Servant;</HI> notwith&s;tand|ing he was an Apo&s;tle, and more than a Prophet, yea, greater in the Kingdom of God than <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t him&s;elf, though among them that are born of Women there had not before ri&s;en one greater than he.&mdash;Even <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> with all the Honours of their immediate Divine Mi&s;&s;ion, In&s;piration and extraordinary Gifts, had but a <HI>Mini&s;terial</HI> Power in the Church: they were not <HI>Lords</HI> over God's Heritage. They own them&s;elves Servants of Chri&s;t; and even Servants of the Church for Je&s;us &s;ake.&mdash;'Tis a humble, yet truly honourable Title, this, a <HI>Servant</HI> of Chri&s;t. And indeed it belongs to Chri&s;tians in common; who have all one Ma&s;ter, and are all Bre|thren in Chri&s;t: the Mini&s;ters of the Word being only a Sort of upper Servants in their Lord's Family, who have &s;ome &s;pecial Tru&s;ts committed to them, as Stewards and Over&s;eers, to feed the Hou&s;ehold, to in&s;pect and regu|late it, and to enlarge it, by drawing in others to become the Servants of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Let us all then bear in Mind the Title we &s;u&s;tain, the Profe&s;&s;ion we make; and &s;tudy to adorn it by &s;hewing all good Fidelity, as becometh Servants, in our Lord's Bu&s;ine&s;s. What will it profit us, my Brethren, to wear an empty Title! To &s;tile our&s;elves Servants of Chri&s;t, and yet not do our Ma&s;ter's Will; but do the Will of Man, or the Will of the Fle&s;h, and &s;erve divers Lu&s;ts and
<PB N="3" REF="007666_0005_102DBB041BBE2C40">
Plea&s;ures!&mdash;Or can we imagine, that Chri&s;t will be plea|&s;ed with our giving him an empty Title; complimenting him with the Name of Ma&s;ter and Lord, while yet in Works we deny him, or at lea&s;t regard Iniquity in our Hearts, but di&s;regard his Honour and Intere&s;t! "If I be a Ma&s;ter (&s;ays the Lord) where is my Fear?" And if we be his Servants, where is our Duty? where is the Homage and Obedience we owe him?&mdash; "But wilt thou know, O vain Man, that Faith without Works is dead!" That the meer Title of Servant, and idle Profe&s;&s;ions of Service, will avail us nothing; nay, will rather turn to our va&s;t Di&s;advantage in the End, and dreadfully aggravate our future Condemnation, in proportion as it enhances our pre&s;ent Guilt!</P>
<P>What &s;aith the Scripture? "That Servant which knew his Lord's Will, and prepared not him&s;elf, neither did according to his Lord's Will, &s;hall be beaten with <HI>many</HI> Stripes." A Con&s;ideration, that &s;hould awaken our mo&s;t &s;erious Concern and Dread, le&s;t, while we call our&s;elves Servants of Chri&s;t, we incur the Reproach and Doom of &s;lothful and unprofitable Servants; as having been neg|ligent of our Duty to him, practically independent of him, and only &s;erving other Lords, who have no Right of Dominion over us. "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your &s;elves Servants to obey, <HI>his</HI> Servants ye are whom ye <HI>obey?</HI>"&mdash;The Ca&s;e is peremptorily decided by an infallible Judge. "No Man can &s;erve two Ma&s;ters: ye cannot &s;erve God and <HI>Mammon.</HI>"&mdash;So neither can we &s;erve Chri&s;t and <HI>Belial;</HI> or Chri&s;t and <HI>Sin.</HI> Vain there|fore are our Preten&s;ions to be Chri&s;t's Servants, &s;o long as Sin reigns in our mortal Bodies, and we obey it in the Lu&s;ts thereof. And is not that univer&s;ally the Cour&s;e of this World?&mdash;What the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> charges on the <HI>Roman</HI> Chri&s;tians, "Ye were the Servants of Sin," &s;uch by Nature, and &s;uch by Practice, is it not applicable to all in every Age? And while we are the Servants of Sin, the &s;ame in&s;pired Writer a&s;&s;ures us, we are "free from Righteou&s;ne&s;s," Now &s;urely "they that are &s;uch, &s;erve
<PB N="4" REF="007666_0006_102DBB0645AAED80">
not our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;But if by a regenerating Change, if by Faith purifying our Hearts, we are "made free from Sin, and become the Servants of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, having our Fruit unto Holine&s;s," then are we indeed Servants of Chri&s;t; &s;uch as are now accepted of him, and whom he will in the Day of Judgment di&s;tingui&s;h by that gracious <HI>Euge,</HI> "Well done, thou good, and faith|ful Servant! Enter into the Joy of thy Lord."&mdash;O that all who are making their Boa&s;t of God, and &s;aying to Chri&s;t, LORD, LORD, would allow them&s;elves to recol|lect their pa&s;t Experiences, to review God's Dealings with their Souls, and enter into a &s;olemn Self-Debate, whether they have ever yet pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life, in the New-Birth, that mo&s;t important Change. For, as our Lord has given us the expre&s;s A&s;&s;urance, <Q>Verily, verily, except a Man be born again (born of the <HI>Spirit</HI>) he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God.</Q>&mdash;Nor are any in Truth the Servants of Chri&s;t, but &s;uch as are the Chil|dren of God by Faith in Chri&s;t,&mdash; obedient Children. <Q>Hereby do we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments.</Q></P>
<P>And our Text in&s;tructs me to remind my&s;elf, and my Brethren, who are the Servants of Chri&s;t in a peculiar Sen&s;e, as <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of his Word, of the &s;olemn Charge and Vows of God upon us, to take Heed to our&s;elves, that we be indeed &s;anctify'd and meet for the Ma&s;ter's U&s;e, prepared unto every good Work; that we &s;tudy to &s;hew our&s;elves approved unto God, Workmen who need not to be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth: and to take Heed to our Mini&s;try, which we have received in the Lord, that we fulfil it, in all the various Parts and Labours of it; watching for Souls, as they that mu&s;t give Account.&mdash;So, when the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e cometh, tho' ever &s;o &s;oon or &s;uddenly, to require of us an Account of our Steward&s;hip, we &s;hall give it with Joy, and not with Grief; and be Partakers of the Glory, that &s;hall be revealed, even the Grace that is to be bro't unto us at the Revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that great
<PB N="5" REF="007666_0007_102DBB07C776CC10">
Shepherd of the Sheep, the chief Bi&s;hop of Souls, and the Lord of all. To Him be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</P>
<P>Thus much for the fir&s;t Thing in the Text. I pa&s;s now to what I had principally in View. We have here,</P>
<P N="2">2. A De&s;cription of tho&s;e <HI>to</HI> whom <HI>Peter</HI> writes this Epi&s;tle: namely, <Q>To them which have obtained like precious Faith with us, through the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>It is called an Epi&s;tle <HI>general,</HI>&mdash;not as being written by one that claim'd to be Head of the Church catholic, or univer&s;al Bi&s;hop, but as being of common Concern|ment and U&s;e; and directed, not to any particular Per|&s;on or Society, but to the Saints indefinitely. Accord|ingly, the Character of true Saints or Servants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, contain'd in the Super&s;cription, being applicable to all &s;uch in every Age, indifferently, the pre&s;ent as well as primitive, I propo&s;e now to con&s;ider this in its excel|lent and various Contents, whether expre&s;s'd, or imply'd: and &s;hall then conclude with &s;ome &s;uitable Application of the Subject, as the Time will allow.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erv'd di&s;tinctly,</P>
<P N="1">I. Here is the <HI>Faith</HI> of the Saints: which is a primary and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Article in the Character of good and acceptable Servants of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Now, Faith is &s;ometimes &s;poken of in it's <HI>objective</HI> Notion; as meaning the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, "the Faith of the Go&s;pel,&mdash;"the Faith once delivered to the Saints. But in our Text, as in many other places, it is thought, Faith is to be under&s;tood in the <HI>&s;ubjective</HI> Notion; as meaning the Grace, or evangelical Principle in the Heart, that goes under that Name. The Word &s;eems mo&s;t frequently u&s;ed in the practical and experimental Sen&s;e: As, where we read of "the Shield of Faith,&mdash;of "the Joy of Faith,&mdash;of "living by Faith,&mdash;of "&s;hewing our Faith by our Works, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Undoubtedly in all &s;uch places it refers to an inward vital Principle, whereby
<PB N="6" REF="007666_0008_102DBB0B1E0B8B28">
"with the Heart Man believeth unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s."&mdash; This being a radical and primary Grace, fundamental to the other Graces of the chri&s;tian Life, always &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in Union with them, and influential to the Exerci&s;e of them, they are thought to be &s;ometimes all collected and &s;um|med up in this one comprehen&s;ive Word, <HI>Faith.</HI>&mdash;But at other times it is to be con&s;ider'd in a more limited Sen&s;e, in its &s;impler Notion, as a particular Grace, tho' a cardinal and leading one. For In&s;tance, the Apo&s;tle in our Context exhorts Chri&s;tians to "add unto their Faith Virtue.&mdash;So el&s;ewhere it is &s;aid, "Faith worketh by Love. &mdash; And of <HI>Abraham</HI> we are told "how Faith wrought with his Works, and by Works was Faith made perfect.</P>
<P>The Word, Faith, &s;eems indeed &s;ometimes apply'd only by way of Allu&s;ion, or Accommodation to Men's Pretences and Profe&s;&s;ions: as, where we read, "What doth it profit, though a Man &s;ay he hath Faith, and have not Works? Can Faith &s;ave him?" <HI>i. e.</HI> Can a meer worldy O&s;tentation of Faith, or "a Man's &s;aying he has Faith," profit him to &s;alvation?&mdash;So, where it is &s;aid, "Faith without Works, is dead," this means only a verbal Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith, exclu&s;ive of its genuine Ef|fects. It does not imply, that there is any &s;uch Thing in Fact, properly &s;peaking in the Sen&s;e of the Go&s;pel, as a <HI>Faith</HI> that is dead; a really exi&s;tent <HI>true</HI> Faith, &s;epa|rate from Works. For the Faith thus de&s;cribed, what|ever it may po&s;&s;ibly have of real Exi&s;tence, yet is but <HI>feigned</HI> Faith, if it be con&s;idered in a relative View, and under the Notion of its being that which the Go&s;pel-Pre|cept requires of us, by the Name of Faith, in Order to Salvation. Becau&s;e the Faith of the Go&s;pel, or that unfeigned Faith which the Go&s;pel-Requi&s;ition refers to, is ever a living practical Principle; of an operative and an imperative Nature; attended with a prevalent moral Efficacy and Command over us; always di&s;po&s;ing and enabling us to follow Holine&s;s; and producing an habi|tual Obedience in Heart and Life to all the Divine Com|mandments,
<PB N="7" REF="007666_0009_102DBB0D528BB228">
as believing them to be holy, ju&s;t, and good. Hence we read of "the Obedience of Faith,&mdash; "the Work of Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;But often there is the Profe&s;&s;ion and &s;ome Shew of this Faith, and Men imagine them|&s;elves Subjects of the true Go&s;pel-Grace, altho' it appears not in all its genuine Actings and Effects. Now &s;uch a wordy Profe&s;&s;ion and airy Shew is but analogically and equivocally &s;tiled Faith.&mdash;I look upon it only as Irony or Sarca&s;m, when it is &s;aid in the Epi&s;tle of <HI>James,</HI> "Shew me thy Faith without thy Works." It is a Propo&s;al founded on an ab&s;urd Hypothe&s;is; on the Suppo&s;ition of an impo&s;&s;ible Ca&s;e, or a Thing never exi&s;tent in Fact; Activity and Efficiency being in&s;eparable Properties of a lively (i. e. unfeigned) Faith.&mdash;There may be a &s;ort of Philo&s;ophical or meer moral Faith, which has &s;omething of Reality in it, and may produce &s;ome real Fruits: yet if it claim to be the evangelical and &s;aving Grace, it is in Scripture-Account but Faith fal&s;ely &s;o called.&mdash;How|ever, &s;ometimes by Way of Allu&s;ion or Accommodation to human Preten&s;ions and &s;ome vi&s;ible Appearances, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> has put upon it the Title of <HI>Faith,</HI> which yet is little or nothing better than the Faith of <HI>Devils,</HI> who are &s;aid to believe and tremble. Such a Belief &s;urely is ineffectual to the proper End of Faith, the Salvation of the Soul. At be&s;t, it is comparatively but an impotent frigid Opi|nion, a lifele&s;s Notion &s;wimming in the Brain, and never de&s;cending to the Heart, nor powerfully influencing the Life. Or, whatever Re&s;emblance there may be of Faith, in its Effects and Operations, if it be not a Principle in|laid in the Heart, it is but a Counterfeit; and far from being that Faith which is intended in the Go&s;pel-De|mand. Undoubtedly a Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith, how &s;pecious &s;oever, that is without Works, internal, as well as exter|nal, corre&s;ponding to it, is but Faith which is dead; dead in it &s;elf, as well as dead to the proper Ends and U&s;es of Faith: and no more de&s;erves the Name of Faith, than an inanimate breathle&s;s Corp&s;e does that of a Man. In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, the Scripture intimates, that a Man does
<PB N="8" REF="007666_0010_102DBB0F7329DAC8">
but <HI>&s;ay</HI> he has Faith: and boa&s;ts of a fal&s;e Gift, like the Man that pretends to Charity, tho' he &s;hews it only in good Wi&s;hes and Profe&s;&s;ions of Benevolence, while he neglects the proper Offices of Love and Kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Faith, in its mo&s;t &s;imple primary Idea, and &s;tricte&s;t Acceptation, I grant, is A&s;&s;ent,&mdash;A&s;&s;ent upon Te&s;ti|mony.&mdash;Divine Faith is an A&s;&s;ent upon Divine Te&s;ti|mony. The Subject-Matter of this Belief is, in general, the Revelation God has made of his Mind and Will in his holy Word; though, more e&s;pecially and eminently the Record he has given of his Son, and the Promi&s;e of Life which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Go&s;pel-Faith, whether in its doctrinal or practical Notion, does not terminate in the Mediator, as &s;uch: but a&s;cends to the &s;upreme Be|ing, the God of Truth and God of all Grace. There|fore it is &s;ometimes called Faith towards <HI>God.</HI> Yet the &s;ame is al&s;o called Faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It commonly has this latter Denomination, not only with a View to di&s;tingui&s;h it from that Faith of <HI>Jews</HI> and others, which is defective either in its Nature, Matter, or Grounds of Belief, but likewi&s;e to &s;ignify Chri&s;t's being its proximate and &s;pecial Object. Go&s;pel-Faith more immediately re&s;pects the Saviour, and is eminently a Belief of the Peculiars of the Chri&s;tian Revelation,&mdash;of the Truth as it is in Je&s;us. Nor indeed (as I &s;aid) an idle Notional Belief, a cold and unaffecting A&s;&s;ent: but a warm and vital, impre&s;&s;ive Per&s;wa&s;ion, rooted in the Heart, and producing all corre&s;pondent Bia&s;&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the Will, all agreable Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions. In the Scheme of Salvation, and in Experience, Sanctification and Be|lief are connected; and the latter in&s;trumental to the for|mer. We are therefore &s;aid to be &s;anctified thro' Faith.&mdash; View'd particularly in this light, as the &s;anctifying Prin|ciple, and regarded in its Connections and Re&s;ults, Be|lief or Faith admits of a complex Notion: and hence the Word &s;eems u&s;ed &s;ometimes in Scripture with a La|titude, or in an exten&s;ive Sen&s;e, taking in concomitant Graces and con&s;equent Effects, the genuine Evidences of
<PB N="9" REF="007666_0011_102DBB11DA0C1F10">
its Sincerity; &s;uch as Love to God, Sorrow for Sin, Re|&s;olutions and Endeavours of Obedience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;"Faith indeed comprehends in it &s;elf the Seeds of all other Gra|ces; which will &s;pring up in due Time, and in their pro|per Orders.&mdash;"No &s;ooner is any Mea&s;ure of Belief en|tred, than accordingly it influences the Soul to &s;uitable Actings; and &s;ome of them are &s;o immediate and in&s;e|parable, that they &s;eem rather to be the &s;ame Thing with that Belief wrought by the Spirit, than any con&s;equential Actings of it.</P>
<P>Belief, or Faith, con&s;ider'd according to the Go&s;pel-U&s;e of the Word, does in its e&s;&s;ential Notion imply Heart-Con&s;ent to the Method of Grace in &s;aying us by a Mediator, cordial Approbation of the appointed Re|deemer, intire Submi&s;&s;ion to, and Tru&s;t in him.&mdash;Faith, view'd in its Reference to Ju&s;tification before God, nextly and e&s;pecially regards Chri&s;t, as the End of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to them which believe; or as made Sin for them, and made Righteou&s;ne&s;s to them; and &s;ignally operates by way of Recumbence or Dependence on him for Ju&s;tification of Life. This is judg'd to be emphati|cally the leading uniting Act of Faith.&mdash;Hence tho&s;e pe|culiar Phra&s;es in Scripture, of believing <HI>in</HI> (or <HI>into</HI>) Chri&s;t, &mdash;Faith <HI>in</HI> his Blood,&mdash;Faith <HI>in</HI> the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; as in our Text, according to the Reading which &s;ome prefer.&mdash;Faith, though it knows Chri&s;t is not divi|ded, yet viewing him in his di&s;tinct Capacities, primarily and very eminently regards him in his Office of a <HI>Prie&s;t;</HI> as having once offered him&s;elf a Sacrifice for Sin, and entred with his own Blood into the holy Place: and accordingly receives, approves, and makes U&s;e of him in that Capacity; tru&s;ting in him as the only Mediator both of Atonement and Interce&s;&s;ion, the Procurer of Pardon and Peace, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Life.&mdash;Yet Faith extends its Views and Applications to him in his other Capacities. It eyes Chri&s;t in his Office of a <HI>Prophet;</HI> con&s;iders him as the Apo&s;tle, as well as High-Prie&s;t of our Profe&s;&s;ion: and accordingly repairs to him for In|&s;truction,
<PB N="10" REF="007666_0012_102DBB14291C8558">
by his Word and Spirit, in Divine Things, and tru&s;ts in him as the Light of the World. It al&s;o eyes him in his Office of a <HI>King,</HI> bows to his Sceptre, and confides in him as the Prince of Life, the grand Tru&s;tee of Divine Power, and &s;upreme Admini&s;trator of Divine Government and Judgment, the &s;acred Repo&s;itory and immediate Source of Divine Ble&s;&s;ings, for all that Grace and Comfort we need; realizing the Exhibition of all Good to us in the Go&s;pel-Promi&s;e, relying on his Faithfulne&s;s and Ability to fulfil his Word, and looking for the Mercy of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto eternal Life.</P>
<P>In Sum, to believe in Chri&s;t imports, not meerly that with the <HI>Mouth</HI> we make Confe&s;&s;ion of him, in the united Characters of Prince and Saviour, the Me&s;&s;iah promi&s;ed to the Fathers, but that we believe in him with all our <HI>Heart;</HI> that under a Conviction of our Sin and Mi&s;ery, of the Excellency and Greatne&s;s of his Salvation, and of his Sufficiency and Willingne&s;s to &s;ave to the ut|termo&s;t them which come unto God by him, we do ac|cordingly receive him for our Saviour; &s;incerely enter|taining and employing him in all the Offices of his Medi|ation; applying and leaning to him, or re&s;ting in him alone, for all the Benefits of his Redemption, as exhibited to us in the Go&s;pel, and freely granted to all that are &s;incerely willing to accept the &s;ame, and do commit them&s;elves to him to be &s;aved by him.&mdash;So that Faith imply's a Per&s;wa&s;ion (not indeed, that Chri&s;t and all his Benefits are actually ours before our Believing, or that we are in a pardoned and ju&s;tify'd State <HI>already,</HI> but) that Chri&s;t and his Benefits are in the Go&s;pel-Pro|mi&s;e held forth to us, in &s;uch a Manner, as to warrant our &s;eeking them, and to give Liberty for our accepting them, according to the Tenor of the Word of Reconci|liation. "In this Sen&s;e (&s;ays a judicious Divine) all the&s;e Things belong &s;o to us, as that we may without any Let or Hindrance apply them unto our&s;elves, for all tho&s;e Ends and U&s;es for which they are appointed"; or in other Words "may in Faith of the Go&s;pel-Exhibi|tion

apply them to our&s;elves in God's Way,&mdash;in the Way and Manner pre&s;cribed in the Promi&s;e,&mdash;where the Matter (&s;ays he) is &s;o contrived, not that every one may &s;ay <HI>po&s;itively,</HI> Chri&s;t and his Benefits belong to me [<HI>i. e.</HI> in &s;pecial] but none can &s;ay, They do <HI>not,</HI>" i. e. in com|mon with others under the Go&s;pel-Call.</P>
<P>And this &s;eems the more nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved, not only as it points out one eminent Difference between the Faith of <HI>Men</HI> and that of <HI>Devils,</HI> founded in the Dif|ference of their relative Circum&s;tances, re&s;pecting a Sa|viour and the Promi&s;e in him; but al&s;o "as it is very common for a poor humbled broken Soul to put the&s;e Things away from him&s;elf, upon the Pretence, that they <HI>belong not</HI> to him. To which Objection it may ju&s;tly be an&s;wered, They <HI>do</HI> belong to him," in the Sen&s;e a|bovementioned: and therefore &s;uch may &s;afely conclude, &s;ince they have this Ground of Faith, it is no Pre&s;ump|tion in them (as they too readily &s;urmi&s;e) to flee for Re|fuge, and lay Hold upon the Hope &s;et before them, in the Go&s;pel of the Grace of God,&mdash;while the fallen An|gels at the &s;ame Time are left in a State of ab&s;olute and final De&s;pair, without all Remedy.</P>
<P>Such, in my View of the Thing, is that Faith by which the Ju&s;t do live. Such is that Faith, by which the Elders obtained a good Report; even God's Te&s;timony that they were righteous before him. Such is that Faith, by which Chri&s;t dwells in our Hearts: Such that Faith, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.&mdash;This I con&s;ider as the Faith of God's Elect: &s;o termed, becau&s;e it &s;prings from electing Love; is the univer&s;al Character|i&s;tic of the Election; and peculiar to tho&s;e who being from the Beginning cho&s;en to Salvation, are in Time called into the Fellow&s;hip of the Son of God, and made Partakers of the Benefit.</P>

"He was numbred with us, and had <HI>obtained</HI> Part of this Mini&s;try.&mdash;It is evi|dently an Allu&s;ion to Men's coming to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome valu|able Good (as the I&s;raelites had their Inheritance in <HI>Canaan</HI> divi|ded to them) by a <HI>Lot;</HI> which, how ca&s;ual &s;oever to Men, undoubt|edly God is the wi&s;e Director and &s;overeign Determiner of, in Ex|clu&s;ion to an imaginary Fortune. Thus &s;aith the true Proverb, "The <HI>Lot</HI> is ca&s;t into the Lap, but the whole Di&s;po&s;ing thereof is of the LORD.&mdash;As for Men, Time and Chance happen to them all: but with God there is no &s;uch Thing as Time or Chance. For his Under&s;tanding is infinite, and at one View are &s;een and known to him all his Works, from the Beginning, to the End of the World; his Works of Grace, in particular. He always infallibly knows, who already have obtained an Inheritance in Chri&s;t, and who here|after &s;hall have their Lot of Inheritance in him: they being pre|de&s;tinated according to the Purpo&s;e of him, who worketh all Things after the Coun&s;el of his own Will, that they &s;hould be to the Prai&s;e of his Glory, as tru&s;ting in Chri&s;t. He always knows who do, and who will believe; &s;ince of Him it is given Men to believe, according as he hath cho&s;en them in Chri&s;t before the Foundation of the World. He is mo&s;t certainly ever con&s;cious to the eternal Purpo&s;e, which he purpo&s;ed in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord; and to his own Donations in Time, pur&s;uant thereto, wherever and when-ever it is given any to believe.&mdash;But &s;till the Gift is a Ca&s;ualty to us; like the <HI>Lot,</HI> which though under the wi&s;e Direction and providen|tial Di&s;po&s;ition of him who ruleth over all, is to Men a Thing quite adventitious or contingent: and they are alike pa&s;&s;ive in one Ca&s;e, as the other; having no more Hand in planting in them&s;elves the Principle of Faith, than in procuring to them&s;elves a Prize in a <HI>Lottery.</HI> It is the Gift of God, and comes at fir&s;t, as it were by Surpri&s;e, or by Accident, to human Apprehen&s;ion; unexpected, un|merited, uninfluenced. <HI>Zaccbeus,</HI> the Publican, when climbing the Tree out of Curio&s;ity to &s;ee Je&s;us, little thought of having Sal|vation come to his Soul, by Faith's being wrought in him. And <HI>Saul,</HI> the Phari&s;ee, when furiou&s;ly pur&s;uing his bloody Errand to <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> as little thought of being apprehended as he was of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. The happy Event that befel the one and the other, was un|&s;ought, unlook'd for, and to them quite a Ca&s;ualty. In the Expe|rience of Believers, in common, fir&s;t Faith is a like Contingence and Surpri&s;e. It happens to them according to that Word of God, "I am found of them that &s;ought me not.&mdash;Seeking is unque&s;ti|onably a Duty, of univer&s;al Obligation: but both right Seeking, and Finding, are wholly owing to the Interpo&s;ition and Efficacy of &s;pe|cial Grace; in&s;omuch that unle&s;s the Lord plea&s;es fir&s;t to &s;eek us, and effectually call us by his Spirit, we &s;hall never &s;eek him aright, nor find in our Hearts truly to believe in him. However, there is a general Invitation to adventure in the &s;piritual Lottery, to attend the Means of Grace, and ca&s;t our&s;elves at the Foot of Divine Mer|cy, reque&s;ting to be made Partakers of the Benefit: and while we thus are applying to the Throne of Grace for the Gift of God, there is Room to hope, and equal Encouragement to all to wait for it; though there is no Probability that all will obtain it, nor is there an ab&s;olute Promi&s;e of it to any one in particular. Hence, before Sinners attain fir&s;t to believe, it is an utter Uncertainty to them&s;elves and others, whether they ever will, there is but a Peradventure in the Ca&s;e: and when it happens they do, this is an Event as fortui|tous or precarious, as unpromi&s;ed, unfore&s;een and &s;urpri&s;eing to them, even as a Benefit accruing by the <HI>Lot;</HI> which they could have no Foreknowledge of, and have no Promi&s;e of, nor might pretend any Claim to in point of Ju&s;tice, and therefore mu&s;t impute their Suc|ce&s;s to the meer Goodne&s;s of God, who with a &s;overeign Hand has &s;o di&s;po&s;ed the Event in their Favour. In like Manner, he gives or denies the &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ing after his own Plea&s;ure: neither they that are Partakers of it, may a&s;cribe it to any Merit of theirs; nor can they that mi&s;s of it, complain of Wrong done them, any more than he may who draws a Blank in a <HI>Lottery.</HI></NOTE>&mdash;This &s;eems plainly deducible from the pro|per

<P N="1">1. That Faith is <HI>no innate</HI> Principle, nor an <HI>hereditary</HI> Privilege:&mdash;even as that which we receive by a <HI>Lot,</HI> is far from being either the Re&s;ult of Nature, or the Prero|gative of Birth and Parentage.</P>
<P>No Man is born a Believer; either &s;uch in Fact, or of Right.&mdash;Faith does not &s;pring up of it&s;elf, from &s;ome latent Seeds in our degenerate Nature: but is altogether of a foreign Extract, and &s;upernatural Ri&s;e.</P>
<P>Alas, if we give any Credit to the holy Scriptures, or con&s;ult our own Experience and Ob&s;ervation, we mu&s;t confe&s;s, this holy Faith in a Thing no Man brings into the World with him: but we are born with an evil Heart of Unbelief in us. We are all in the Number of the Many, who by one Man's Di&s;obedience were made Sinners: and there is an inbred Principle of Infidelity (a &s;ecret Root of Bitterne&s;s) in the corrupt Nature we de|rive from apo&s;tate <HI>Adam.</HI> Fooli&s;hne&s;s is bound up in the Heart of a Child: and nothing can drive it out, but the Rod of <HI>his</HI> Strength, who makes his People willing in the Day of his Power. The carnal Mind is Enmity a|gain&s;t God, and not &s;ubject to his Law,&mdash;is Enmity again&s;t Chri&s;t, and not &s;ubject to his Go&s;pel,&mdash;neither indeed can be, without a transforming Change wrought upon us. So &s;elf-conceited, &s;o &s;en&s;ual, and &s;tupid is the Mind of Man (vain Man, born like the wild A&s;s's Colt) that while it remains under the uncontrouled Power of this native Enmity, it neither feels the Need of a Saviour, nor &s;ees the amiable Excellency and Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: nay, tho' reduced by Convictions to &s;ome Sen&s;e of Guilt and Danger, and put in Fear, yet &s;till its habitual Tendency is to ri&s;e up in Oppo&s;ition to Je&s;us Chri&s;t the righteous. It labours of perver&s;e Prejudices again&s;t his Divine Per&s;on and Perfections, his Medittorial

Character and Offices, his Doctrine and Precepts, his A|tonement and Merits, and the Way of Salvation by Grace thro' Faith in his Blood. The&s;e Things, which the Angels of Light a&s;pire to look into, and in which they di&s;cover the manifold wi&s;dom of God, are never|thele&s;s very Fooli&s;hne&s;s to the unenlighten'd Mind of Man. It relucts again&s;t tho&s;e Self-denying Duties of Chri&s;tianity, Repentance towards God and Faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It knows not how to come bro|ken-hearted and empty-handed, to God and our Saviour, for the free Pardon of Sins, Redre&s;s of Mi&s;eries, and Sup|ply of Wants. In its natural Operation, at be&s;t, it puts Men upon going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righteou&s;|ne&s;s; and, as of it &s;elf, is unreconcilable to the whole Me|thod of Go&s;pel-Grace, as well both in ju&s;tifying us thro' Faith, and in &s;anctifying us through Faith. The haughty Spirit of the vain natural Man, till &s;ubdued by the Power of the Holy Gho&s;t, cannot tell how to brook, either the Wa&s;hing of Regeneration, or Sprinkling of the Blood of Je&s;us. The unhappy Tem|per of the Self-righteous and Self-&s;ufficient Phari&s;ee is ha|bitually prevalent in the Carnally-minded.&mdash;If they think at all about the Salvation of their Souls, they are for be|ing &s;aved in their own Way; either in their Sins, or el&s;e by Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which they do them&s;elves. By the Principles of Nature, unrenewed Men are Ene|mies in their Minds, as well to the Grace of God and the Merits of Chri&s;t, in the Scripture-Notion of them, as to his Holine&s;s and moral Government. If ever they be &s;aved, they de&s;ire but to &s;ave them&s;elves, and care not to be beholden to another.&mdash;Or, if by any Means, un|der Parental or Mini&s;terial In&s;tructions, they have had beaten into their Heads &s;ome Notion of the Scripture-Doctrine concerning Chri&s;t's Satisfaction, and the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s which is of Faith, they u&s;ually either take up a <HI>fal&s;e Notion</HI> of this Faith, or el&s;e re&s;ting in &s;ome &s;imilar, but imperfect Exerci&s;es of Mind, they deceive them&s;elves with a <HI>fal&s;e Appearance</HI> of Faith; while yet really they

have a &s;ecret Di&s;plicence and Reluctance again&s;t the Thing in Truth. Nay, even under a Work of Convicti|on, when in &s;ome notable Degree illuminated and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by common Grace to &s;ee them&s;elves under the Cur&s;e, and in Hazard of peri&s;hing for ever, without an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and a Change of their &s;piritual State, yet how does an Attachment to the Law, u&s;ually re&s;train them, and the Spirit of the Phari&s;ee operate and prevail in them? In&s;omuch that altho' they have &s;ome Sort of De&s;ire to|wards a Saviour, and in a Manner &s;eek to be ju&s;tify'd by Chri&s;t, they however are for tempering and com|pounding Matters, mingling Law and Go&s;pel, or going a middle Way between them. They aim (it &s;eems) at "wa&s;hing away their Sins by the Tears of Repentance, joined with Faith in the Blood of Chri&s;t," as they have &s;ometimes expre&s;s'd them&s;elves: or el&s;e they hope to make a Righteou&s;ne&s;s (as it were) of their Reformations, Prayers, and Duties, though as yet de&s;titute of Faith; thinking, by &s;uch Things, to recommend them&s;elves to the Grace of God, to win Chri&s;t, and get intitled to his Benefits. At be&s;t, the Pride of their unbroken Hearts will not let them come to Chri&s;t <HI>as Sinners,</HI> naked and blu&s;hing at their Shame, wretched and trembling under the Apprehen&s;ion of their Mi&s;ery and Danger; worthle&s;s and helple&s;s in them&s;elves, depending on him to make them righteous, &amp; to work in them both to will and to do.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it appears, we are by Nature, not on|ly Strangers, but Enemies to holy and unfeigned Faith; &s;o far is this from being a connate Principle in us.</P>
<P>Nor is it a Thing <HI>hereditary,</HI> or as a Family-Privilege entail'd upon us. Indeed there has &s;ometimes been a beautiful Series of Examples of Faith, in the &s;ame Fami|ly; an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion, from Parent to Child, for a Number of Generations. An In&s;tance the Apo&s;tle mentions in his &s;econd Epi&s;tle to <HI>Timothy:</HI> where &s;peak|ing of <HI>unfeigned faith,</HI> he &s;ays to him, "Which dwelt fir&s;t in thy Grandmother <HI>Lois,</HI> and in thy Mother <HI>Eunice,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="007666_0019_102DBB2435F8D560">
and I am per&s;uaded that in <HI>Thee</HI> al&s;o." Here was Faith exemplify'd in the &s;ame Family for three Generations &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. So, <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> afford a like Example: and there have been many &s;uch. Yet the Ca&s;e is comparatively rare.&mdash;Nor in &s;uch In&s;tances is this Faith tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity in the Manner of an here|ditary Privilege. None are born the lawful Inheritors of it. We do not &s;ucceed to it as the Inheritance of Fathers. We do not come by it in Right of our An|ce&s;tors, in Con&s;equence of our vi&s;ibie Covenant-Relation to God, or by Virtue of our pious Parentage, though we had even <HI>Abraham</HI> to our Father. On whatever Ac|count the Faith of a Parent may benefit his Infant-Seed, yet the Adult mu&s;t every one have a Faith of his own: nor does this belong to the &s;piritual Patrimony we enjoy as the natural De&s;cendents of believing Progenitors. They that now have unfeigned Faith dwelling in them, were not by Birth the rightful Heirs (any more than actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors) of the Grace of Life: but have &s;ince <HI>obtained</HI> it, without any previous Title or Claim to it.</P>
<P>I go on to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">2. Neither is this Faith a Thing of <HI>their own Pro|curement and Acqui&s;ition;</HI> the natural Effect or proper Produce of human Endeavours.&mdash;As it is not a Princi|ple born with us, or rooted in the Nature We bring into the World, nor an Heritage derived from our Parents by Succe&s;&s;ion; &s;o neither is it an acquired Habit, which we work up our&s;elves to, or procure to our&s;elves, in Virtue of our own moral Improvements on natural Rea|&s;on and Con&s;cience, or any &s;uch Remains of the Image of God in fallen Man.</P>
<P>There is indeed in our lap&s;ed Nature that which &s;ome call a pa&s;&s;ive Receptivity of this and every other holy Principle, or gracious Habit; but no Power of active Production, or Efficiency. I mean, although the Spirit of Man &s;till retains natural Faculties &s;uitable to be wrought on, nor is any Violence done them by the Power exert|ed upon us, in bringing as to believe; and &s;o has what
<PB N="18" REF="007666_0020_102DBB25B993FD80">
is by &s;ome termed an <HI>objective</HI> Capacity of believing: yet neverthele&s;s it has not properly a <HI>&s;ubjective</HI> Capaci|ty, or a &s;ufficient Ability in it&s;elf to accompli&s;h the ble&s;|&s;ed Effect by its own &s;olitary Endeavours.&mdash;It is granted, that the Effect is to be &s;ought after, as by Prayer, &s;o in a diligent U&s;e of the Means of Grace; e&s;pecially God's Word, which is called the Word of Faith, perhaps partly becau&s;e Faith comes by Hearing.&mdash;And it is granted, that Efforts or Trials are to be made by us, if perad|venture it may be given us to believe. So, the happy Event may be, that while we are feebly e&s;&s;aying, as it were, to &s;tretch forth the withered Arm at the Lord's Bidding, we may experience the powerful Influence of an invi&s;ible Agent, effectually enabling us (impotent as we are in our&s;elves) to &s;tretch out the Hand of Faith.&mdash; But if left to our&s;elves, though accommodated with the mo&s;t de&s;irable Creature-Helps and &s;ub&s;ervient Means, all our Attempts to believe in Chri&s;t will leave us &s;hort of that Faith which is unto Salvation. For it is always to be remembred, this is not the meer Re&s;ult of our own Endeavours; not the &s;ole Product of Means and In&s;tru|ments, in natural Con&s;equence of our Attendance on them, however &s;edulous and con&s;tant: but whoever obtain this holy Principle of Faith, derive it from an extrin&s;ecal Cau&s;e, in a way of &s;upernatural Influence; and are made Partakers of it by a &s;ecret Power, beyond or out of them|&s;elves, and above the Reach of meer human Agency, as much as is that which has the Di&s;po&s;ing of a <HI>Lot.</HI>&mdash;This I &s;uppo&s;e to be connoted in the &s;ignificant Phra&s;e, <HI>ob|tained</HI> Faith.&mdash;But to proceed, this implies,</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is a <HI>Gift received from</HI> GOD; that Men have this Faith wrought in them by a <HI>Divine Energy,</HI> in the Way of <HI>free Grace.</HI></P>
<P>All Succe&s;s of Means depends intirely on the Divine Pre&s;ence and Ble&s;&s;ing, and is intirely gratuitous. "Who is <HI>Paul,</HI> and who <HI>Apollos,</HI> but Mini&s;ters by whom ye be|lieved, even as the LORD <HI>gave</HI> to every Man.</P>

Did they challenge to them&s;elves the Ho|nour of acquiring it by any Power of their own, or by any Merit of theirs? No, but they give God all the Glory. In like Manner they teach <HI>us</HI> to own a Divine <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Fini&s;her</HI> of our Faith. They repre&s;ent it as "<HI>given</HI> us to believe.

wa&s;te away by Exerci&s;e.&mdash;It is of &s;uch Account with the Believer, that he will never voluntarily alienate or part with his happy &s;piritual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Neither &s;hall the Adver&s;ary of Souls ever be able by Force or Fraud to rob him thereof.&mdash;And be&s;ure the Believer's Friend &amp; Fa|ther, the original Donor of this Benefit, will never in Wrath deprive him of it. It belongs to <HI>the good Part,</HI> which the Scripture of Truth a&s;&s;ures us <HI>&s;hall not be ta|ken away.</HI> Unfeigned Faith, wherever it is, is &s;aid to <HI>dwell</HI> in its Subject, becau&s;e it is not a tran&s;ient, but fix'd, permament Principle. It is the Faith of God's <HI>Elect:</HI> and electing Love, the Source of it, will &s;ecure its Per&s;everance to the End. It is the Fruit of the <HI>Spi|rit,</HI> who, wherever he has begun a good Work, will per|form it to the Day of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Its Stability or Du|ration is owing to the Supply of the Spirit, procured by the Interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t. Hence that Saying of his to <HI>Peter,</HI> "I have prayed for thee, that thy <HI>Faith</HI> fail not." Agreably Believers are &s;aid to be "pre&s;erved in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.&mdash;In Virtue of his Interce&s;&s;ion, the Habit of Faith (at lea&s;t) is never-failing: though (as in <HI>Peter</HI>'s Ca&s;e) its Actings may be &s;adly interrupted and &s;u&s;pend|ed for a Sea&s;on, and in the End the Form of its Exer|ci&s;e may be changed, when the pre&s;ent Scene of Action is clo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But a hint or two further &s;hall conclude this Head.&mdash; It is imply'd in our Text,</P>
<P N="5">5. That Faith is a <HI>&s;pecial</HI> Property; not a Gift com|mon to all, but a <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing</HI> Favour. The Phra&s;e, "Them which have obtained Faith," denotes this to be the Privilege of a happy &s;elect Number, in Di&s;tinction from others. As in a <HI>Lottery</HI> it is not every one's Ca&s;e to have a Prize fall to his Share, &s;o in the Di&s;pen&s;ation of Grace the Divine Gift of Faith does not fall to every one's Lot. "All Men have not Faith." Even in the profe&s;&s;ing World, and among tho&s;e of the be&s;t Morals too, it is not every Man has Faith. No; but they are in Scripture-Account a <HI>peculiar People,</HI> that have unfeigned
<PB N="21" REF="007666_0023_102DBB2E4E390D60">
Faith dwelling in them. This is an Attainment appro|priate to a cho&s;en Generation, the &s;ame that our Apo&s;tle in his fir&s;t Letter de&s;cribes as "<HI>Elect</HI> according to the Foreknowledge of God the Father.&mdash;But &s;till to every one of them it mu&s;t be &s;aid, "Who maketh thee to dif|fer? This Faith, the Fruit of the Spirit, is produced by Him, where he will, in a way of di&s;criminating Grace; yet without the lea&s;t Partiality, &s;ince it is not an Act of Ju&s;tice, but of Grace, and done in Quality of a Benefac|tor. In giving of Faith, God exerci&s;es a &s;overeign Beneficence, without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons; preferring none for any national Con&s;iderations, for their civil Di&s;tinctions, for their Parental or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Connections, for their worldly Circum&s;tances, for their intellectual, or even moral Endowments. "Ye &s;ee your calling, Brethren," how God &s;o orders the Ca&s;e, in his un&s;potted Sovereign|ty, that "no Fle&s;h &s;hall glory in his Pre&s;ence. Truly, "they are not all <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> which are <HI>of I&s;rael:</HI> neither becau&s;e they are the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> are they all Chil|dren of the Promi&s;e, as was <HI>I&s;aac.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, the De&s;cription in our Text, "Them which have obtained Faith," gives the true Character of <HI>Saints in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> exclu&s;ively of all others; and &s;peaks their peculiar Dignity, their &s;uper-eminent Excellency above all others. It was intended by the Apo&s;tle for a commendatory, as well as a di&s;tinctive Character. And truly it is a very &s;hining Character, full of Glory and Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>But this brings me to ob&s;erve, under another general Head.</P>
<P N="3">III. Their Faith is here denominated <HI>precious</HI> Faith, <HI>like precious</HI> with that of <HI>Peter</HI> and others that fir&s;t tru&s;t|ed in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles, who were our Lord's earlie&s;t Di&s;ciples, and &s;pecial Favourites, are eminently the Standard or Pattern of Faith under the new Te&s;tament, as <HI>Abraham</HI> had been under the Old. Indeed the Faith of <HI>Abraham</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="007666_0024_102D74301735C5C0">
and of <HI>Peter,</HI> the Faith of the Patriarchs and Apo&s;tles, that of primitive <HI>Jews</HI> and Chri&s;tian <HI>Gentiles,</HI> were &s;pe|cifically all one and the &s;ame, however gradually and circum&s;tantially varying. "Know ye therefore, that they which are of Faith, the &s;ame are the Children of <HI>Abra|ham,</HI>&mdash;are the Children of the Prophets and Apo&s;tles. Hence <HI>Peter</HI> directs his Epi&s;tle in this Form, "To them which have obtained like precious Faith with us.</P>
<P>It will not, I hope, be unprofitable, to make the fol|lowing Remarks here di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. We will &s;uppo&s;e it in&s;inuated in this Expre&s;&s;ion, that there may be a Sort of Faith, which is of a <HI>different</HI> Complexion and Character from that of the Apo&s;tles and fir&s;t Followers of Chri&s;t:&mdash;a Faith, which &s;o far as it hath any Reality, is of an inferior and ba&s;er Kind than theirs; or, if it claims Affinity with that, and pretends to be like precious Faith, is but fal&s;ely &s;o called.</P>
<P>Not to &s;peak now of the con&s;trained Faith of <HI>Devils,</HI> who &s;ay of the holy Je&s;us, "What have we to do with Thee!&mdash;nor of the Faith of <HI>Pagan</HI> Morali&s;ts, that never heard of Chri&s;t;&mdash;nor of the like natural Faith of <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> who explode all reveal'd Religion, and renounce the Hope of the Go&s;pel;&mdash;nor of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith, which, though it honours Chri&s;t as a great Prophet, yet advances a vile Impo&s;tor above him;&mdash;to &s;ay nothing more particularly of the&s;e,&mdash;there is the once authentic, but now counterfeit Faith of the <HI>Jews;</HI> who, tho' they profe&s;s to believe the Scriptures of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Pro|phets, that wrote of the Me&s;&s;iah, yet mi&s;under&s;tanding both "What, and what Manner of Time the Spirit of Chri&s;t which was in them, did &s;ignify," do refu&s;e JE|SUS of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> as a Deceiver. They pretend to be|lieve the Go&s;pel as it was preached before unto <HI>Abra|ham</HI> and the Fathers, and adhere to the Law and the Prophets, yet &s;till expect the future Coming of the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah. But their Faith is vain, and far from being <HI>like,</HI> in Nature and Effects, to theirs who believe in Chri&s;t as already come in the Fle&s;h.&mdash;Indeed before
<PB N="23" REF="007666_0025_102DBB2FD5DEA200">
his Coming, while the <HI>Jews</HI> walked in the Steps of that Faith of their Father <HI>Abraham,</HI> which he had when he &s;aw Chri&s;t's Day and rejoiced in Hope, they were &s;ound in the Faith, and acceptable Believers. Such were <HI>Si|meon</HI> and <HI>Anna,</HI> and others. But the pretended Follow|ers of their Faith, the <HI>Jews</HI> of the pre&s;ent Age and of every Age &s;ince the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation has been e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd, have not obtained <HI>like</HI> Faith with them. No; it is but a groundle&s;s, worthle&s;s, corrupt, rotten, and dead Faith, at be&s;t, which &s;uch have to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o the like worthle&s;s, adulterate and fal&s;e Faith of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> who name the Name of Chri&s;t, yet abide not in the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, but turn a&s;ide to <HI>ano|ther Go&s;pel:</HI> We may well then &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch to have al&s;o <HI>another Faith.</HI> For, however involuntary le&s;&s;er Mi&s;takes in the Doctrine of Faith may con&s;i&s;t with the Being of the Grace of Faith, yet &s;urely damnable Here&s;ies, that &s;ub|vert the former, can by no Means &s;tand with the latter.</P>
<P>In fine, there is the like worthle&s;s and feigned Faith of <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> or meer Formali&s;ts in Religion, who per|haps in Theory hold a Creed &s;ufficiently Orthodox; but &s;till they have little better than a meer Head-Knowledge. Though they profe&s;s Belief of the Truth, it is done in Pretence, not &s;incerely, but to deceive others: or, at lea&s;t, they make a Profe&s;&s;ion without any true Engaged|ne&s;s of Heart, and re&s;t in a &s;piritle&s;s dead Faith, deceiv|ing them&s;elves with the Workings of &s;ome fal&s;e Affec|tions and &s;eeming Graces. A Faith therefore not of the <HI>Apo&s;tolic</HI> Kind, not of the &s;ame Species, not of the &s;ame Quality with that which tho&s;e primitive Servants of Chri&s;t were Teachers and Examples of; and which implies our &s;incerely receiving of Chri&s;t, giving him our Hearts, and committing our Souls into his Hands, to be wa&s;hed with his Blood, &s;anctify'd by his Spirit, ju&s;tify'd in his Name, and pre&s;erved to his heavenly Kingdom. The Scrip|ture di&s;tingui&s;hes this by the Name of <HI>Faith unfeigned,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to the feigned or counterfeit Faith of meer no|minal Chri&s;tians.&mdash;It is a Faith, that tran&s;cends the highe&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="007666_0026_102DBB3215BD52A8">
Attainments of unregenerate Nature. It is &s;aid indeed of the very <HI>Devils,</HI> that they believe and tremble. But &s;urely they do not believe in the &s;ame Sen&s;e, and to the &s;ame Purpo&s;es, as &s;uch do who are &s;aid to believe unto everla&s;ting Life. Neither did <HI>Simon</HI> the Sorcerer believe with the &s;ame Faith, as <HI>Simon</HI> the Apo&s;tle.</P>
<P>I come then to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Faith of the Saints in common is of the <HI>&s;ame Kind,</HI> with that of the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves.&mdash;This is im|ply'd in the Phra&s;e, "Them which have obtained <HI>like precious</HI> Faith with US.</P>
<P>Indeed the Apo&s;tles had a particular Faith, of the pro|phetic Kind, and for miraculous Effects. But the Text has no Reference to this: nor in Truth does the Epithet, <HI>precious,</HI> belong to this, in Compari&s;on with that Faith which worketh by <HI>Love,</HI> without which a Man is <HI>No|thing.</HI> The Apo&s;tle undoubtedly had his Eye to the <HI>Grace</HI> of Faith: and this is exi&s;tent in every Period of the Church, common to the Saints of every Age. The meane&s;t real Saint has Faith (in Kind) <HI>like</HI> that of the ancient Fathers, and very chief of the Apo&s;tles, or rather the <HI>&s;ame</HI> with theirs, in all e&s;&s;ential Re&s;pects. It is the &s;ame with theirs in its general Nature, Properties, Act|ings, and Effects. It has the &s;ame Object, the &s;ame Seat, the &s;ame Original, the &s;ame De&s;ign and I&s;&s;ue; the &s;ame Operations, the &s;ame Influences attending it, the &s;ame Privileges annexed to it, and the &s;ame Ble&s;&s;ings con&s;e|quent upon it.&mdash;All are alike ju&s;tify'd thro' Faith, alike &s;anctify'd thro' Faith, and alike finally &s;aved by Grace thro' Faith.&mdash;But I go on to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3">3. Faith is <HI>precious,&mdash;alike</HI> precious, in every In&s;tance. Says our Text, "Them that have obtained <HI>like pre|cious</HI> Faith with with us.&mdash;It is one compound Word in the Orignal. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;<HI>Ex</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, par, aequalis, &s;imilis, idem; <HI>et</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, honor, decus, dignitas, jus, pretium.</NOTE> Some read it <HI>co-equal:</HI> and it is &s;o in regard of its general Properties, Objects, Ends, U&s;es, and final Re&s;ult; though not always &s;o in the Degree
<PB N="25" REF="007666_0027_102DBB35D212ADB0">
of its Vigour, Operation, and Influence.&mdash;Others read it <HI>equally excellent:</HI> and &s;o it always is in the Kind; what|ever Di&s;parity there may be in the particular Exerci&s;es and Effects of it.&mdash;But our engli&s;h Ver&s;ion well enough renders it <HI>like precious.</HI> So that although it implies the Faith to be of the <HI>like</HI> Nature, or of the &s;ame <HI>Species;</HI> the Faith of one corre&s;ponding to that of another: yet, I confe&s;s, the direct Meaning is, that it is <HI>alike precious.</HI> The Faith of the lea&s;t of all Saints is of &s;imilar Excel|lency,&mdash;of the &s;ame Preciou&s;ne&s;s, in Proportion,&mdash;as that of the very chiefe&s;t of the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>Faith is <HI>precious,</HI> wherever it is found; in one Sub|ject, or another, and in whatever Degree.&mdash;And it may be &s;o called for its <HI>Rarity:</HI> which is a Circum&s;tance that u&s;ually advances the Rate of Things in human E&s;tima|tion. Among Men, we know, as Propriety gives an additional Lu&s;tre to the Excellency of any valuable En|joyment, &s;o when that Good is &s;carce, and falls to the Share of Few, this is a Circum&s;tance that heightens the Worth of it in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's Account, and draws others, through a Principle of Curio&s;ity or Emulation, the more to covet it, and be willing to give the greater Price for it. Diamonds, chiefly for that Rea&s;on, are called <HI>precious Stones.</HI> So, Faith may be termed pre|cious, it being the mo&s;t uncommon Jewel.</P>
<P>This Epithet points al&s;o to its <HI>valuable Nature,</HI> and admirable <HI>Utility.</HI> Faith certainly is mo&s;t excellent in a <HI>comparative</HI> View; as it excells all other Graces on &s;ome Accounts; and as the Faith of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> ex|cels the Faith of all others. &mdash;But con&s;idering Faith in an <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> Light, it appears a Thing mo&s;t worthy and beneficial; de&s;erving the Name of <HI>Gold tried in the Fire,</HI> even the mo&s;t refined Gold, as u&s;eful as it is ornamental. The Value of the <HI>Object</HI> derives an an&s;werable Preciou&s;ne&s;s to the Faith employ'd upon it.&mdash;So the <HI>Price,</HI> which pro|cured this Ble&s;&s;ing for us, this &s;tamps an Excellency on Faith, and &s;peaks it preferable to Thou&s;ands of Gold and Silver.&mdash;Likewi&s;e its <HI>Original,</HI> which is eminently divine<PB N="26" REF="007666_0028_102DBB37A5120D20">
and heavenly, it being the Fir&s;t-fruit of the Spirit, this puts a further Dignity on Faith, and argues its &s;uperla|tive Excellency.&mdash;It's <HI>Seat</HI> is in the inward Man, the noble&s;t Con&s;tituent of human Nature.&mdash;In fine, this Faith is of a mo&s;t excellent <HI>Tendency,</HI> and admirably &s;ub&s;er|vient to the mo&s;t excellent <HI>De&s;igns</HI> in the Kingdom of Grace. Love, as excellent as it is, is founded in Faith, and &s;prings from it: Yea, Faith is the Root and Life of every chri&s;tian Grace and Duty: and in the Nature of Means, by Virtue of a Divine In&s;titution, and in Subor|dination to Chri&s;t, it is the prime Source of all &s;piritual Good and Comfort. It is the &s;pecial uniting, applying, participating, and appropriating Principle.</P>
<P>Faith has this high Office peculiar to it, to ju&s;tify us in the Sight of God, as we thereby receive Chri&s;t, and thus make his Righteou&s;ne&s;s our own, for that ble&s;&s;ed Pur|po&s;e. And &s;ubordinately to Chri&s;t, Faith is the Foun|dation of new and excellent Privileges; the Ba&s;is of new and excellent Relations; the Spring of a new and excel|lent Life in this World, and Preparative to a better in the next; the Pre&s;ervative from Hell, and the Pledge of Heaven.</P>
<P>Faith inve&s;ts us with a Title to <HI>great and precious Promi&s;es,</HI> nor does it fail of <HI>obtaining the Promi&s;es,</HI> &s;ooner or later. "Who&s;oever believeth on Him, &s;hall not be a&s;hamed.&mdash;"The Trial of Faith worketh Patience: and "the tried Faith, being much more <HI>precious</HI> than refined Gold, &s;hall be found unto <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> at the Appearing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,&mdash;in that Day when he will "bind up <HI>his Jewels.</HI></P>
<P>Well then may the Faith of the Saints have this Di&s;|tinction put upon it, to be call'd <HI>precious</HI> Faith. It is admirably excellent and precious in it&s;elf, mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for us, and more gainful to us, than, if the whole World were given us.&mdash;And this Faith appears, by the whole Tenor of Scripture-Repre&s;entation, very precious &amp; amia|ble in the Sight of GOD. It is &s;o likewi&s;e in the Eyes of holy <HI>Angels,</HI> who rejoice over one Sinner brought to repent
<PB N="27" REF="007666_0029_102DBB3933A20098">
and believe.&mdash;And in the Eyes of the <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> them&s;elves, that live by Faith, certainly it is of great Account.</P>
<P>Let it now be added, The Faith of Saints, in com|mon, is <HI>alike</HI> precious in every Ca&s;e. Being a rich &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ing, purcha&s;ed by the &s;ame infinite Price, the Blood of Chri&s;t; and be&s;towed by the &s;ame Divine Power and Grace; having always the &s;ame Object, the &s;ame Seat, the &s;ame Nature and Qualities, the &s;ame Actings, the &s;ame Re&s;ults, and the &s;ame final I&s;&s;ue, in general; it mu&s;t, of Con&s;equence, be <HI>alike precious</HI> in all Saints.</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ed God bears the like Benevolence to all true Believers, without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons. All are alike the Children of God, Heirs of God, and Joint-Heirs with Chri&s;t Je&s;us. They are all <HI>one</HI> in Chri&s;t; are in one &s;piritual State, of one heavenly Nature, of one Heart, and bound for one End: and in general, God deals with them all alike, in one Way; by one Covenant, by one Mediator, and by one Comforter, appointing them to one common Salvation. Which argues the Faith of all to have one and the &s;ame Pretio&s;ity in his Sight: only allowing for a gradual Difference in the various Ca&s;es of a weak and a &s;trong, or a little and a great Faith; according as it more or le&s;s gives Glory to the God of all Grace, and to the Son of his Love; in whom he is ever well-plea&s;ed, and for his &s;ake is well-plea&s;ed with Believers, putting no Difference for their outward Cir|cum&s;tances.&mdash;"Hearken, my beloved Brethren, hath not God cho&s;en the <HI>Poor</HI> of this World, <HI>rich in Faith,</HI> and Heirs of the <HI>Kingdom?</HI></P>
<P>I pa&s;s now to the la&s;t Thing in the Text.</P>
<P N="4">IV. After that Part of the De&s;cription, "Which have obtained like precious Faith with us," it follows, "Thro' the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of GOD and <HI>our Saviour</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t," or, of <HI>our God and Saviour,</HI> according to &s;trict gram|matical Conctruction.</P>
<P>Indeed it is the Title of LORD, that is mo&s;t commonly given Chri&s;t in this Epi&s;tle; and &s;ometimes the Stile is,
<PB N="28" REF="007666_0030_102DBB3CD09FEF88">
"Our LORD and Saviour: But in the Text it is, "our GOD and Saviour. And no Wonder, &s;ince tho&s;e Names are of equal Dignity and Importance; and are accord|ingly applied in this Epi&s;tle indifferently, as of equivalent Meaning.&mdash;The Day of the LORD and the Day of GOD, are Phra&s;es here conveying one Idea. It concludes with a&s;cribing Glory to Chri&s;t under the united Characters of "our LORD and Saviour": And is it at all &s;trange, that it &s;hould begin with doing Honour to the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t under the like Characters, of "our GOD and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</P>
<P>We el&s;ewhere read of "Grace reigning thro' Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal Life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. (<HI>Rom.</HI> 5.21.) It means a Righteou&s;ne&s;s that is a <HI>Gift</HI> to us; it is called "the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>One;</HI>&mdash; and is the &s;ame Thing with "the <HI>Obedience of One;</HI> by which, it is there &s;aid "Many &s;hall be <HI>made righteous.</HI>&mdash;A My|&s;tery this, that any &s;hould be con&s;tituted righteous by the Obedience of Another!

<P>Chri&s;t's being here &s;tiled <HI>our Saviour,</HI> points out the &s;pecial <HI>Capacity,</HI> in which he wrought out this Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s;&mdash; and the <HI>End</HI> in View, namely, <HI>Salvation,</HI> no otherwi&s;e to be effected;&mdash;as al&s;o the <HI>Party</HI> who&s;e Benefit was re&s;pected, not the &s;inning Angels, but fallen Man|kind, even as many as receive him in his Character of Saviour. In the way of Grace and Faith, this Righteou&s;|ne&s;s becomes <HI>ours,</HI> to the Salvation of the Soul.&mdash; In the Coun&s;el of God, it was ours by original Intention: and
<PB N="29" REF="007666_0031_102DBB3EF86F0D50">
upon believing, it becomes ours by actual Application. It is ours with re&s;pect to its being accepted for us, and reckoned to us, or placed to our Account, as wrought in our Stead. It is ours, to all the Purpo&s;es for which we needed a Saviour's Righteou&s;ne&s;s. It is &s;o ours, upon our receiving the Gift, that we may plead it with God, in An&s;wer to the Challenges of offended Ju&s;tice, and as a Ground of Claim to Pardon and Favour. Having this Righteou&s;ne&s;s for ours, we may have Confidence toward God, in Life and Death; and &s;hall have Boldne&s;s even in the Day of Judgment. It is a Righteou&s;ne&s;s admira|bly glorious in it&s;elf, infinitely amiable and dear to God, infinitely important and beneficial to us.</P>
<P>And no Wonder, &s;ince it is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t, our</HI> GOD <HI>and Saviour.</HI>&mdash;I think, &s;ome have que&s;tion'd whether there is any expre&s;s Mention ia Scripture of "the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t," in &s;o many Words. But it &s;eems they had forgot our Text, which pre&s;ents us with an In&s;tance; and where the Phra&s;e is u&s;ed in a Manner extreamly advantageous to that Cau&s;e which they are no Advocates for. "The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> our God and Saviour.&mdash;It means the &s;ame that is often called "the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD.&mdash;And it is &s;o called, not only for its tran&s;cendent Excellency, or for its being of God's Contrivance and Appointment, or becau&s;e approved and accepted by him, or becau&s;e it is God's Gift to tho&s;e he ju&s;tifies: but rather becau&s;e Chri&s;t, its Efficient, is GOD, as well as Man. The Text points out this Con&s;truction of the Phra&s;e, as our Lord is here expre&s;ly named, and it is called "the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of our GOD and Saviour, Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;The Operator and immediate Subject of it is the &s;ame who is el&s;ewhere cha|racteri&s;ed "The LORD of Glory,&mdash;"GOD manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h,&mdash;"GOD ble&s;&s;ed for evermore.&mdash;Its being the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of a <HI>Divine</HI> Per&s;on, incarnate in our Nature, this &s;peaks its ab&s;olute Perfection, entire Fitne&s;s to its De&s;ign, and univer&s;al Suitablene&s;s to our Ca&s;e.&mdash;It is that <HI>everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> the Me&s;&s;iah was to bring in.&mdash;
<PB N="30" REF="007666_0032_102DBB4079746F60">
Well might the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> glory in this, and compara|tively de&s;pi&s;e his own. And well might he impute it to the <HI>Jews Ignorance,</HI> that they went about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;ubmitted not them&s;elves to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD.</P>
<P>The &s;ame is often call'd "The Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of God by Faith:&mdash;denoting Faith to be the Medium of its Reception, the Means of its becoming actually ours. Some read the Text accordingly,&mdash;not <HI>through,</HI> but <HI>with</HI> the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t: &s;ignifying, that this accompanies Faith, and is made ours in the way of believing. Hence we are &s;aid to "believe <HI>unto Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Others (as the Greek Prepo&s;ition is <HI>'EN</HI>) render it, <HI>in</HI> the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; as &s;pecifying the <HI>Object</HI> of Faith. Agreably we read of "Faith <HI>in</HI> his Blood.&mdash; But then Evangelical Faith re&s;pects the Blood of Chri&s;t, not as its Object only, but it's <HI>Price,</HI> or meritorious Cau&s;e, and in the View of Divine Grace, the &s;ole Rea&s;on of its being given. So we read, "Unto you it is given <HI>in the behalf of Chri&s;t</HI> (that is, for the &s;ake of his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and in Con&s;equence of his Merits) to believe on him.&mdash;Accordingly many tran&s;late the Greek Par|ticle (EN, per) <HI>by</HI> or <HI>through;</HI> our Engli&s;h Bible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">ds the Text, <HI>Through</HI> the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t.&mdash;And thus render'd, &s;ome have turn'd it, through the <HI>Mercy</HI> of Chri&s;t: and certainly "the <HI>Grace</HI> of our Lord is ex|ceeding abundant, with <HI>Faith.</HI>&mdash;But others prefer the u&s;ual Sen&s;e of the Word, <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> and keeping to this, &s;ome think the Text may intend, that Faith is <HI>pre|cious</HI> through <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or in Virtue of its Relation to this, as both its Object and its Price. But rather the Word <HI>obtained</HI> &s;eems to be the Antecedent; and in this Connection, the Text means, that the Grace of <HI>Faith</HI> owes its Exi&s;tence (as well as Value) to Chri&s;t's <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as its procuring Cau&s;e, and the Rea&s;on or Ground of its being obtained by any.</P>

this precious Gift of Faith; and by his Interce&s;&s;ion, in Virtue of his Merits, procures the actual Be&s;towment of it: and the Spirit comes <HI>in his Name,</HI> to call them into the Fellow&s;hip of the Son of God, by per&s;uading and ena|bling them to believe on him.&mdash;Indeed the <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> of Chri&s;t, pre&s;ented to the Eye of the awaken'd Mind in a true and powerful Light, has an <HI>objective</HI> Force, an attractive Efficacy and moral Power (in the Manner of a Medium or Argument) to excite the Principle of Faith, where the Spirit has implanted it, to its genuine Exer|ci&s;es, in a way of active receiving Chri&s;t, &s;ubmitting to his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and depending on his Mediation.&mdash; In all the&s;e Regards, Faith is obtained <HI>through</HI> (or in Vir|tue and by Means of) the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>I will only add, that many have thought there is &s;ome Act of Divine Sovereignty referrible to the Head of <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> (view'd as <HI>Con&s;titutive,</HI> in Di&s;tinction from <HI>Declarative</HI>) which co-incides or falls in with the In&s;tant of Regeneration or pa&s;&s;ive Conver&s;ion, and is previous even to the very <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Exerci&s;e of Faith: Which Act of God, they &s;uppo&s;e, is what the Scriptures call his "<HI>bring|ing near</HI> his Righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;But I may not tarry to &s;ay any Thing for the Illu&s;tration of this Point.&mdash;</P>
<P>The APPLICATION remains. And here,</P>

<P>By Office he is our <HI>Saviour,</HI> and in this Capacity he has all the Authority of a Prophet, Prie&s;t, and King; has all the excellent Qualifications, and does all the important Works, belonging to the&s;e mediatorial Characters. Ac|cordingly he expects and demands, that we own him as the Author of eternal Salvation to all that obey him; and that we take him to be <HI>our</HI> Saviour, put our Tru&s;t in him, and pay him all the Honour and Homage due to him as <HI>Mediator.</HI></P>
<P>Yet we mu&s;t remember, this is <HI>not his highe&s;t</HI> Capa|city.
<PB N="32" REF="007666_0034_102DBB45B99FD8A8">
For in this he &s;u&s;tains "the Form of a <HI>Servant.</HI> With re&s;pect to his created Nature, and his mediatorial Office, "Chri&s;t is <HI>God's,</HI>" is "<HI>of</HI> God,&mdash;derivative from him, dependent on him, &s;ubordinate and accountable to him.

<P>Truly, we may with full A&s;&s;urance of Faith avouch Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be <HI>our</HI> GOD, as well as our <HI>Saviour;</HI> &s;ince in&s;pired Apo&s;tles have &s;at us an Example, and &s;ince, the holy Scriptures in&s;truct us to "follow their Faith.&mdash;Cer|tainly none but &s;o extraordinary a Per&s;on, the <HI>God-Man,</HI> was capable of &s;u&s;taining &amp; executing the arduous &amp; high Office of <HI>Mediator</HI> between God &amp; Men.

And one who has the Name, but in Truth is <HI>no</HI> God or Saviour, how unfit is he to be the Object of our holy Wor&s;hip? how unworthy of our &s;upreme Affection, Submi&s;&s;ion, and Affiance?&mdash;To &s;uppo&s;e our dear Lord JESUS to be but <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Saviour-God as this, exceedingly derogates from the Riches of his redeeming Grace, as well as from the Dignity of his Per&s;on; and by Con&s;equence, from the Glory of the Father's Wi&s;dom and Love, in his Mi&s;&s;ion: manife&s;tly &s;ubverts the Scripture-Doctrine of Atonement and Ju&s;tification; and tends to overturn the whole re|vealed Scheme of Redemption. On &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition, no wonder if Men deride the Notion of an imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s; explain away, by perver&s;e Comments, the ble&s;&s;ed Doctrine of our being &s;aved by Grace through Faith; make light of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, in his Per&s;on and Operations; deny the Per&s;everance of Believers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>As a very worthy Divine (the late Dr. <HI>Calamy</HI>) ob&s;erves, <Q>The denying Chri&s;t's proper <HI>Deity</HI> [i. e. <HI>his e&s;&s;ential eternal Divinity</HI>] is ju&s;t like opening a Sluce, to let in Floods of Errors, to the endangering a common De|luge.

nominal <HI>God</HI> will make but a nominal <HI>Saviour:</HI> And "a God without <HI>infinite</HI> Perfections, is only a <HI>nominal</HI> God." And to &s;uppo&s;e a meer nominal God to be endow'd with infinite Perfections, is to &s;uppo&s;e a <HI>created true God,</HI> or <Q>an <HI>infinite Creature:</HI> which carries in it more of <HI>Ab|&s;urdity,</HI> than the greate&s;t Difficulty, that the Doc|trine of the <HI>Trinity</HI> has attending it, can be charged with,&mdash;with any Colour of Rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>Let us then take Heed to our&s;elves, that we fall not from our own Stedfa&s;tne&s;s, in this important Point of Chri&s;t's Divinity.

<P N="2">2. Is <HI>Faith</HI> &s;o <HI>precious,</HI> as has been repre&s;ented?

This is eminently "the Evil; to be mourn'd and abhor'd and deprecated by us.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is Faith <HI>like precious</HI> in all? We &s;hould then have the <HI>like E&s;teem</HI> for it in all, without Partiality. "My Bre|thren, have not the <HI>Faith</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us, the Lord of Glory, with Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons.</P>

<P>The <HI>Preciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of Faith, its Excellency and Rarity, are <HI>Motives</HI> to induce us to a careful and impartial Self-Examination.

Reviewing the Scrip|ture-Account of <HI>their</HI> Faith, its Properties and Effects, and comparing ours with theirs, we may thus come to know whether our Faith be genuine. Well, have we been pricked in our Heart, and become dead to the Law, as they were?&mdash;Is Chri&s;t truly precious to us, as he was to them? Does our Faith, like theirs, work by Love?&mdash;Purify our Hearts?&mdash;Overcome the World?&mdash;Shield us again&s;t the fiery Darts of the Wicked?&mdash;Shew it&s;elf by good Works?&mdash;Do we live by the Faith of the Son of God, the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Strength, our God and Saviour?&mdash;And hope to die in Faith, counting all Things but Lo&s;s, that we may win Chri&s;t, and be found in him?&mdash;We are thus to examine our&s;elves, whether we be in the Faith.&mdash;And we &s;hould do this prayerfully; begging the Spirit of God to witne&s;s with our Spirits.&mdash;O let us con&s;ider the Hazard of deceiving our&s;elves with a &s;purious Faith;&mdash;the Po&s;&s;ibility, by divine Help, of attaining A&s;&s;u|rance; and the Advantages of this.&mdash;Let &s;uch Reflections engage us to make &s;ure of unfeigned Faith.&mdash;In fine, Exerci&s;e will, under the Spirit's Influence, increa&s;e our Faith: and by its Growth we may come to know its Truth. As our Faith improves, the proper Effects will abound more and more: and its genuine Efficacy will &s;erve to evidence its Reality.&mdash;Then in this Way be &s;eeking A&s;&s;urance.</P>
