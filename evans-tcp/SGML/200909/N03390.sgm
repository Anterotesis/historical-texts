<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I AM &s;o far from finding Fault with your Attempt to vindicate the Church of England from the Exceptions both of Mr. <HI>J. G.</HI> and my &s;elf, that I cannot but think every Man equally entitled, both to follow the Dictates of his own Rea&s;on, and Con&s;cience in matters of Religion; and to give the Rea&s;on of his Hope to others for their Conviction or Satisfaction. And I mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
<PB N="4" REF="004136_0003_1003D611327AD618">
that you and the re&s;t of your Bre|thren that have de&s;erted our Communion for that of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> had a &s;pecial Call to &s;atisfy the World about you, as to the Rea&s;ons of your &s;urprizing Conduct. And I know no other but this publick Method of do|ing it, that would &s;o effectually obviate tho&s;e har&s;h In&s;inuations and cen&s;orious Reflections, unto which you are liable; and convince every Body, that your Change was not owing to the Want of nece&s;&s;ary &s;elf-Denial, and chri&s;tian Contentment with the Hard&s;hips and Indigen|cies, that (thro' the Ingratitude of the People) are the too common Lot of the Mini&s;try in this Country. But you'll pardon me, if I find it more difficult to apologi&s;e for the Method, in which you have cho&s;en to publi&s;h your Vindication.</P>
<P>It might have been expected, that tho' you had &s;een Rea&s;on to change &s;ome of your Re|ligious Principles; you would neverthele&s;s have retain'd &s;omething of that common Ci|vility, for which you have formerly been famous; and at lea&s;t have treated your Adver|&s;aries with that Decency, that is alwaies due to human Nature; if your new Principles could not have allowed us the Character of Friends, Gentlemen, or Chri&s;tians. (Indeed Sir, I cannot account for tho&s;e opprobrious Epithets you are plea&s;ed &s;o freely to be&s;tow,
<PB N="5" REF="004136_0003_1003D611327AD618">
&s;uch as <HI>bruti&s;h Noi&s;e, palpable and notorious Untruths, Prophane enough for an Infidel, Fool &amp;c.</HI> I cannot but think your Arguments would have been every whit as conclu&s;ive, without the&s;e Decorations as with them.</P>
<P>I am in like Manner uncapable to apolo|gi&s;e; for your overlooking &s;o great a Part of the Sermon you had undertaken to an&s;wer. You have wholly overlook'd the Preface to that Sermon. &mdash; You have made no Reply to the Imputation of <HI>Arminiani&s;m,</HI> which me|thinks might have &s;tuck pretty clo&s;e to &s;uch Clergy-men of the Church of England, as have &s;ub&s;cribed the xxxix Articles.&mdash; You have made no Reply to the Rea&s;ons offered again&s;t Requiring as a religious Duty, what God has not propo&s;ed as &s;uch, nor required of us; a|gain&s;t enjoining as Terms of Communion, what God has not enjoined; and again&s;t im|po&s;ing any Terms of Communion by penal Sanctions. &mdash;Nor have you taken any parti|cular Notice of the three following Heads, wherein is &s;hewn, how <HI>teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men,</HI> renders our Wor|&s;hip vain.&mdash; You have indeed roundly a&s;|&s;erted, that <HI>there cannot be any publick Wor&s;hip, but there mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;tinted Prayer impo&s;ed.</HI> p. 17. And that <HI>there neither is nor can be any Church upon Earth, but what hath Terms of Communion and Ceremonies impo&s;ed, which
<PB N="6" REF="004136_0004_1003D617511DE1B8">
God hath not expre&s;ly commanded.</HI> p. 51. But did you think that the&s;e &s;trong A&s;&s;ertions, were &s;ufficient An&s;wer to all the Arguments in the Sermon again&s;t Impo&s;itions? Are we to take your Word in this Ca&s;e, and not know why? This is I confe&s;s a very conci&s;e and &s;ummary Method of an&s;wering that Di&s;cour&s;e, to wholly neglect the greate&s;t Part of it; and even that Part which was propo&s;ed as the Grounds and Foundation of tho&s;e Exceptions, that you have been plea&s;ed to make &s;ome Re|marks upon.&mdash; If you thought the&s;e Things unworthy your Notice, 'twuold have been proper for you to have treated the whole with the &s;ame Contempt; &s;ince it was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to take off <HI>Samp&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Hair,</HI> (as you are plea&s;ed to &s;tyle my Arguments again&s;t Impo&s;itions) in Order to prevent his making further Spoil of the Phili&s;tines.</P>
<P>But perhaps you might &s;uppo&s;e, that the an&s;wering tho&s;e Arguments would not at pre|&s;ent be quite &s;o popular, among the new Pro|&s;elytes at <HI>Newark,</HI> to whom it might be &s;ome|thing &s;hocking to think, that they had parted with their old Profe&s;&s;ion and Freedom toge|ther.&mdash; They might have been frighted at the Sight of the Yoke; and it is therefore too early to endoctrinate, them in the Nece&s;&s;ity of a blind Obedience to their &s;piritual Guides, and an ab&s;olute Subjection to their Impo&s;itions.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004136_0004_1003D617511DE1B8">Having premi&s;ed the&s;e Things, I proceed to con&s;ider your <HI>Vindication,</HI> which as you in|form us, <Q>is no new Reply; but a Collection from &s;everal Writers, that we may &s;ee how each Complaint has been an&s;wered, long before I preached or publi&s;hed them; and therefore, how little Need there was to renew the tragi|cal Outcry.</Q> By which Declaration I find, I have the united Strength of all your Party to grapple with.&mdash; For you have doubtle&s;s collected the be&s;t An&s;wers, that you could find, among all the Authors that have written on your Side of the Controver&s;y.&mdash; And if I can ju&s;tify my Exceptions, again&s;t all the&s;e Champions called in to your A&s;&s;i&s;tance; it will appear, that we have good Rea&s;ons, why we cannot ordinarily join with the Wor&s;hip of the Church of England; which was the Thing I undertook to prove in that Sermon. And that there is Cau&s;e to continue the &s;ame Com|plaint, that has ever been made from the be|ginning of the Reformation, again&s;t the Im|po&s;itions of the Church of England, in the Points under Debate.</P>
<P>I am fir&s;t to attend upon your Explication of the Text I preach'd upon; and your An|&s;wer to that Enquiry, <HI>What is it to teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men?</HI> This (you tell us) <Q>is no more nor le&s;s, than to teach that, that is a divine Law or Ordinance,
<PB N="8" REF="004136_0005_1003B61DBB0D62C8">
which is really but a human Appointment. When Men father tho&s;e Practices on God which have only an human Original; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that God has made that a Duty or a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> which he has never commanded nor forbidden <HI>p. 5.</HI></Q> But by what Argument is this Glo&s;s ju&s;tified? &mdash; You tell us out of Dr. <HI>Pride</HI> and of the Jews pretending to a twofold Law, the <HI>Written</HI> and the <HI>Oral</HI> Law; the latter equally divine, and of the &s;ame Authority with the former; that this <HI>Oral Law,</HI> or Bundle of Traditions, was committed to Writing in a Book called the <HI>Talmud, &amp;c.</HI> In the <HI>Talmuds</HI> I confe&s;s the&s;e Traditions were pretended to be of Divine Authority: But don't you know, that the <HI>Jeru&s;alem Talmud</HI> was written above five Hundred Years after Chri&s;t; and the <HI>Babylonian Talmud</HI> much later? &mdash; How then does the ridiculous Dotages of the <HI>Tal|mudi&s;ts,</HI> prove this to be the Doctrine of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> oppo&s;ed by our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour in this Text? It is certain they had Multitudes of mo&s;t trifling ridiculous Traditions and Ob|&s;ervances, at the Time that the <HI>Talmuds</HI> were written, which were utterly unknown, while our Saviour &s;ojourned upon Earth. 'Twould therefore have been more to the Purpo&s;e, for you or your Author to have proved, That this Doctrine of the <HI>Oral Law,</HI> and of <HI>Wa&s;hing of Hands before Meat</HI> as a part of it, was re|ceived
<PB N="9" REF="004136_0005_1003B61DBB0D62C8">
to be of Divine Authority in tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of which that Context treats; than <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> have founded your confident and po&s;itive interpretation of the Text, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;o many Hundred Years after.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e this was the Ca&s;e, I can't &s;ee how it at all affects the pre&s;ent Argument. &mdash; are not they as well changeable with teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, who enjoyn the&s;e Commandments by the &s;evere&s;t Penalties; and are more careful of their Ob&s;ervation, than of the Ob&s;ervation of God's own In&s;titutions; as they who expre&s;ly declare, that the&s;e Commands are of divine In&s;titution? &mdash; What does it &s;ignify for the Church of <HI>England</HI> to teach that, <Q>The&s;e Ce|remonies are not Ordinances nece&s;&s;ary to Sal|vation,</Q> when they are impo&s;ed with &s;uch &s;evere and dreadful Sanctions? &mdash; You tell us, the Scribes and Phari&s;ees valued their pretend|ed <HI>Oral Law,</HI> <Q>more than the written Law of God; and made the written Law give way to it.</Q> p. 9. &mdash; And I mu&s;t tell you, That the written Law of God requires us, to <HI>receive one another, as Chri&s;t al&s;o received us, to the Glory of God,</HI> Rom. xv. 7. <HI>To receive him that is weak in the Faith, but not to doubtful Di&s;pu|tations,</HI> Rom. xiv. 1. <HI>Not to judge one ano|ther any more; but to judge this rather, not to put a Stumbling-block, or Occa&s;ion to fall, in
<PB N="10" REF="004136_0006_1003D6220EBE98E0">
our Brothers Way.</HI> Rom. xiv. 13. And <HI>not to de&s;troy him with our Meat, for whom Chri&s;t died; nor to eat Fle&s;h; nor drink Wine; nor any Thing whereby thy Brother &s;tumbleth, or is offended, or made weak.</HI> ver&s;. 15.24. &mdash; The written Law of God requires, that we &s;hould <HI>have Compa&s;&s;ion one of another, love as Breth|ren, be pittiful, be courteous.</HI> 1 Pet. iii. 8. &mdash; And would it not be a valuing the Command|ments of Men, above the written Laws of God, to declare all excommunicated <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> that don't acknowledge the&s;e Commandments of Men, to be <HI>&s;uch as they may with a good Con&s;cience approve, u&s;e, or &s;ub&s;cribe to;</HI> or that <HI>do but pretend to groan under certain Grievan|ces, impo&s;ed upon them</HI> by the Commandments of Men? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">vid. <HI>Can.</HI> vi. &amp; x.</NOTE> And yet you are no Stranger to that excellent Con&s;titution, where all &s;uch as the&s;e are by Canon delivered up to Satan. &mdash; And did the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> ever go further than this, in <HI>teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men?</HI></P>
<P>You al&s;o inform us, That the Scribes and Phari&s;ees <Q>e&s;teemed this In&s;tance of wa&s;hing of Hands before Meat, as much a divine Command, as that <HI>thou &s;halt not kill;</HI> or <HI>thou &s;halt not commit Adultery.</HI></Q> &mdash; And would it not be a virtual and practical declaring the
<PB N="11" REF="004136_0006_1003D6220EBE98E0">
&s;ame Thing, to treat &s;uch as capital Offenders, who con&s;cienciou&s;ly refu&s;e Subjection to the&s;e <HI>Commandments of Men?</HI> And yet that many Hundreds have been laid in Irons, in &s;tinking Dungeons, been bani&s;hed, di&s;membred, and put to Death in this Cau&s;e, is well known to all that are acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of our Nation.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Sir,</HI> I dare even make the Ap|peal to your &s;elf, whether it ben't as much teaching the&s;e for Doctrines, to impo&s;e them with &s;uch dreadful Severity, as to barely de|clare them divine, when they are not.</P>
<P>You tell us, <HI>they are not taught to be nece&s;|&s;ary to Salvation.</HI> p. 7. And that <HI>the Church has declared to the World, That they place no Religion in the&s;e Things.</HI> p. 9. And mu&s;t all be lookt upon as <HI>Heathen Men and Publicans, by</HI> Virtue of the Church's Excommunication, who can't conform to the&s;e Things, that by your own Confe&s;&s;ion have no Religion in them? &mdash; Mu&s;t they be perpetually pelted, with the frightful Clamours of damning Schi&s;m, who &s;cruple the Ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e Commandments of Men, which the Impo&s;ers them&s;elves declare to the World that they place no Religion in?</P>
<P>But that we may put an End to this Debate, let us view the Ca&s;e, as it is repre&s;ented by the <HI>Evangeli&s;t</HI> him&s;elf, and &s;ee whether all
<PB N="12" REF="004136_0007_1003B622550F9618">
<HI>teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men,</HI> are not condemned in the Text.&mdash; And whether all Impo&s;itions of our own In|&s;titutions upon other Mens Con&s;ciences, (whe|ther we give them the Character of divine Ordinances or not) are not culpable, by this Verdict of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. If we recur to the &s;acred Story, we find it thus related. &mdash; <HI>Then came to him the Phari&s;ees, and certain of the Scribes which came from Jeru&s;alem; and when they &s;aw &s;ome of his Di&s;ciples eat Bread, with defiled (that is to &s;ay, with un|wa&s;hed Hands they found Fault. &mdash; Then the Phari&s;ees and Scribes asked him, why walk not thy Di&s;ciples according to the Tradition of the Elders, but eat Bread with unwa&s;hen Hands? He an&s;wered and &s;aid unto them, well hath I &s;aids prophe&s;yed of you Hypocrites, as it is written. &mdash; This People honoureth me with their Lips; but their Heart is far from me.&mdash; Howbeit in vain do they wor&s;hip me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</HI> &mdash; By which Narrative it plainly ap|pears, that the Thing and the only Thing found Fault with by the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, was that the Di&s;ciples <HI>eat Bread with unwa&s;h|ed Hands.</HI> &mdash; That the Rea&s;on and the only Rea&s;on of their finding Fault was, that they <HI>walked not according to the Tradition of the Elders.</HI> There was not the lea&s;t Pretence that
<PB N="13" REF="004136_0007_1003B622550F9618">
his Ob&s;ervance was founded upon any divine Authority.&mdash; It was the Injunction of this (in it &s;elf) innocent and indifferent Rite, by the lawful Authority in the Jewi&s;h Church, that brought upon 'em the&s;e &s;evere Cen&s;ures. <HI>You Hypocrites, in vain do you wor&s;hip me,</HI> &amp;c. And I mu&s;t take Liberty to &s;ay, that I cannot imagine any Plea or Pretence, that can po&s;&s;ibly be made for the Impo&s;ition of the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England, that may not with like Propriety be offered, in Favour of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees in this Context.&mdash; Are the Injunctions of the Church of England impo&s;ed by lawful Autho|rity? So was wa&s;hing of Hands before Meat.&mdash; Are they &s;ignificant of inward Purity and Ho|line&s;s? So was this.&mdash; Are they pretended to be decent and orderly? And was not this Pre|tence much more plau&s;ible in the Ca&s;e before us? Are your Ceremonies as you tell us, p. 11. <Q>convenient; and conducive to the Peace and and good Order of the Church, in the Opi|nion of the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Gover|nours?' And was not this &s;o too? Do you pre|tend that the Churches Injunctions are not forbidden by God, and therefore lawfully im|po&s;ed?</Q> You know this has been alwaies a Sub|ject of Debate.&mdash; But none can pretend that God has any where forbidden us, to wa&s;h our Hands before Meat.&mdash; Or do you plead, that
<PB N="14" REF="004136_0008_1003D62E1D9F9E40">
your Ceremonies are indifferent Things; and therefore what can't be ju&s;tly objected again&s;t. But can they be more indifferent, than the wa&s;hing of our Hands before we eat? In &s;hort, try your Skill in making what Apolo|gy you plea&s;e for the Impo&s;ition of your Rites and Ceremonies; and the &s;ame Arguments will conclude with equal Force, in Favour of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees in this Context.</P>
<P>And now I'm come to con&s;ider your artful turning the Point upon us; and to try if we can no Way avoid the dangerous Thru&s;t.&mdash; <Q>No, no, they teach for Doctrines the Com|mandments of Men, (you inform us) who &s;ay it is a Sin to join in an impo&s;ed Form of Prayer, when God never &s;aid &s;o, &amp;c.</Q> p. 8. But what is this to the Purpo&s;e? We do indeed &s;ay it's a Sin for any to join in tho&s;e impo&s;ed Forms and Ceremonies, again&s;t the Remon|&s;trances of their own Con&s;ciences; and a Sin for any to impo&s;e them.&mdash; But you mu&s;t give us better Conviction than your bare Word, that God has never &s;aid &s;o.&mdash; I am &s;ure God hath &s;aid, that <HI>he that doubteth is damned if he eat, becau&s;e he eateth not of Faith; for what&s;oever is not of Faith is</HI> SIN, Rom. xiv. 23. &mdash; And God has al&s;o &s;aid, that if ye SIN <HI>again&s;t the Brethren and wound their weak Con&s;cience, ye</HI> SIN <HI>again&s;t Chri&s;t.</HI> 1 Cor. viii. 12.&mdash; But you tell us. <Q>They are the
<PB N="15" REF="004136_0008_1003D62E1D9F9E40">
guilty Per&s;ons, who make the&s;e Things &s;in|ful, which God has left indifferent; as he has all the Ceremonies of the Church of England.</Q> Has God left the&s;e Things in|different? Why then I be&s;eech you, don't the Church of England leave them indifferent too? Can they order this Matter better than God has done? And I mu&s;t further enquire, to whom are the&s;e Things indifferent? If to the Impo&s;ers, they could ea&s;ily part with indif|ferent Things, for the Peace and Union of the Church, without any Prejudice to their Con&s;ci|ences.&mdash; But how often mu&s;t you be told, that they are not indifferent to us; and there|fore cannot be comply'd with without Sin.&mdash; If you &s;ay, that our Scruples are unrea&s;ona|ble.&mdash; I an&s;wer, that you have no Bu&s;ine&s;s to monopolize all Rea&s;on to your &s;elves. &mdash; We have as good a Claim to follow the Dictates of our own Rea&s;on, as you have.&mdash; We mu&s;t believe for our &s;elves, act for our &s;elves, and give an Account for our &s;elves.&mdash; And are therefore not to depend upon your Rea&s;on for our Guide.</P>
<P>Thus I've endeavour'd to re&s;cue my Text out of your Hands, and have (I think) left the Founda|tion of that Di&s;cour&s;e &s;afe, notwith&s;tanding all your Attempts to &s;ubvert and undermine it.</P>
<P>You next endeavour to turn my own Con|ce&s;&s;ions again&s;t me; and <Q>appeal to any Man
<PB N="16" REF="004136_0009_1003D636E34A3DA0">
that is not &s;tark blind with Prejudice, whe|ther I have not by the&s;e true A&s;&s;ertions, wholly freed your Church from that dread|ful Charge, of teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</Q> But why could you not give your Reader my Conce&s;&s;ions in my own Words, without leaving out &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages, and altering and adding others, ac|cording to your own Fancy? Did not your publi&s;hing tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages in the <HI>Italick</HI> Cha|racter, give your Reader Rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e them an exact Tran&s;cript; and did not the Ju&s;tice of the Cau&s;e require, that they &s;hould be &s;o? Indeed Sir this looks a little &s;u&s;picious.</P>
<P>I did (I confe&s;s,) allow, that agreeing among our &s;elves, upon any meer Circum&s;tantials and Apendages of Wor&s;hip, is not <HI>teaching for Doctorines the Commandments of Men.</HI>&mdash; That it's impo&s;&s;ible to attend upon any publick Wor&s;hip, without adju&s;ting &s;ome external Cir|cum&s;tances with Relation to it, &s;uch as the Time and Place of Wor&s;hip, and &s;uch like Things as are altogether extrin&s;ecal to the Wor&s;hip it &s;elf; and which have no Religion placed in them.&mdash; But what is this to the Affair under Con&s;ideration? You indeed de|mand, <Q>What has the Church of England done, but only agreed together about &s;ome meer Circum&s;tantials and Apendages of Wor&s;hip?</Q> And tell us, <Q>They have de|clared
<PB N="17" REF="004136_0009_1003D636E34A3DA0">
to the World; that they place no Re|ligion in the&s;e Things, &amp;c.</Q> But could you be &s;erious, when you wrote this? Are the Churches Impo&s;itions of the&s;e Things with &s;uch &s;evere penal Sanctions, no more then an Agreement among them&s;elves? Is there no Difference, between adju&s;ting &s;uch external and altogether extrin&s;ecal Circum&s;tances with Relation to the Wor&s;hip of God, as the Time and Place of Wor&s;hip; and the impo&s;ing your my&s;tical &s;ignificant Ceremonies, your Modes and Forms of Wor&s;hip? Don't you your &s;elf allow, that the Sign of the Cro&s;s (for In|&s;tance) is a vi&s;ible Sign of invi&s;ible Grace.&mdash; That it is a Badge of our Chri&s;tianity; that it is a covenanting Sign, a Sign of profe&s;&s;ed Con&s;ent to the Covenant Duties, an obliging Sign, an inve&s;ting Sign; that it is to operate Grace morally on the intelligent: And that it is a Di&s;charge of our Duty, by glorying in the Sufferings of Chri&s;t? From p. 20. to 26. And can any Body pretend, that this is no more than meer Circum&s;tantials and Appen|dages of Wor&s;hip, &s;uch as Time, Place and the like? Or can any Body pretend, that the Modes of Wor&s;hip are altogether extrin&s;ecal to the Wor&s;hip it &s;elf; that they are meer Circum|&s;tantials, that have no Religion in them?

<P>Pardon me Sir, if I here take Liberty to en|quire of you, upon what Warrant the Church of England have rejected the Popi&s;h Ceremo|nies and In&s;titutions?

Now according to your own Rule. p. 12. <HI>&s;ince you think to plea&s;e God by avoiding what he has not forbid|den,</HI> are you not guilty of Will-Wor&s;hip and Super&s;tition, in rejecting of the&s;e Things?

Authority in appointing &s;uch un&s;criptural In|&s;titutions, as &s;he thinks decent and orderly in the Wor&s;hip of God, I mu&s;t take leave to tell you again, that tho' there is greate&s;t Difference in the Nature of the Things impo&s;ed; yet there is none at all in the Authority to impo&s;e them; nor any at all in the Authority to judge, what are, and what are not decent and order|ly in Gods Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Thus I'm prepar'd to hear what you have to &s;ay, to the particular Charges as you call them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, that I think &s;tinted and impo|&s;ed Liturgies, are teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, for this Rea&s;on a|mong others; becau&s;e the Scriptures have not impo&s;ed nor pre&s;cribed any. And is not this a good Rea&s;on? Such impo&s;ed Liturgies mu&s;t be either the Commandments of God or the Commandments of Men.&mdash; If the former, God has pre&s;cribed and enjoined them; and if he has not, they are the Commandments of Men, which is what I undertook to prove; and I think this falls nothing &s;hort of Demon&s;tra|tion.&mdash; If it had been the Will of God that we &s;hould wor&s;hip him by &s;tinted Liturgies, he would have told us &s;o in his Word.&mdash; It is impo&s;&s;ible by any Evidence to determine that to be his Will in this Ca&s;e, which he has not revealed to be &s;o in his Word, which is the only Manife&s;tation of his Will, with Re|&s;pect

to the Modes of Wor&s;hip. &mdash; And it is not &s;o light a Concern, whether we wor&s;hip God with a Form or without, whether we have a &s;tated and &s;tinted Liturgy or none at all, or by that &s;ort of Form or Liturgy, whether by a <HI>Ma&s;s-Book,</HI> or <HI>Common-Prayer-Book,</HI> or &s;ome other, we are to perform our publick Wor&s;hip, that there &s;hould be no Provi&s;ion made about it in the Word of God, if it had been the di|vine Plea&s;ure, that there &s;hou'd be a &s;tated &s;tinted Liturgy con&s;tantly u&s;ed in the Church, for publick Wor&s;hip.

<P>What next offers, is your Attempt to vindi|cate the Prayer-Book from the Imputation of <HI>vain Repetitions.</HI> And in Order to a ju&s;t view of the Ca&s;e, it may be proper to enquire into the meaning of our Lords Prohibition of vain Repetitions, in <HI>Mat.</HI> vi. 7 &mdash; And then con|&s;ider, how applicable that Text is to the Ca&s;e before us.

That there are numerous Re|petitions of the &s;ame Thing, is certain. And that the&s;e Repetitions are altogether needle&s;s, is as certain. One &s;ingle U&s;e of <HI>Good Lord

deliver us;</HI> or of <HI>We be&s;eech thee to hear us good Lord,</HI> would have been as well connected with the Whole of that Prayer in the <HI>Litany,</HI> as the Repetition of the one eight Times, and the other Twenty. And what is this much &s;peaking of the &s;ame Thing for? Is it not that God may hear you? Or is it meer trifl|ing to no Purpo&s;e at all? The one or other of the&s;e mu&s;t be the De&s;ign of it. If the for|mer, how can you be excu&s;ed from vain Repe|titions, in the very Sence that they are prohi|bited in this Text? If the latter, it is horrible Profanene&s;s, which therefore cannot be the End of it. I don't apprehend what An&s;wer you can give to this.</P>
<P>It don't at all affect the Ca&s;e, for you to &s;ay as p. 19. <Q>When we repeat <HI>Good Lord deliver us,</HI> it always relates to new Matter;</Q> &s;ince there is no new Matter at all, &s;poken by tho&s;e that vocally pronounce the&s;e Petitions; nor a|ny Cau&s;e at all (that I know of) that calls for their Repetition. And there are be&s;ides this, many other <HI>Repetitions</HI> in your Prayers, where there can be no Pretence for any new Matter intervening. For in&s;tance, in the very &s;ame Prayer before referred to, that Petition <HI>Have Mercy upon us mi&s;erable Sinners,</HI> is u&s;ed eight Times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, without any other Petition between; and that Petition, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon us, Chri&s;t have Mercy upon us,</HI> &s;ix Times
<PB N="43" REF="004136_0022_1003D7369590D7F0">
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively, without any new Matter. And you know where to find more of the like Kind. The Common Prayer Book complains of the Papi&s;ts u&s;ing <HI>Multitudes of Re&s;ponds, Ver&s;es and vain Repetitions</HI> We make the &s;ame Complaint of the Prayer-Book. And the like|lie&s;t Way to &s;atisfy our Complaint, is to &s;hew how Multitudes of <HI>Repetitions</HI> in the Popi&s;h Prayers are <HI>vain;</HI> and Multitudes of Repeti|tions in the Prayer-Book are not <HI>vain.</HI> But I can think of no po&s;&s;ible Method of doing this, unle&s;s you pretend, That the Papi&s;ts have wrong Ends in their u&s;ing the&s;e Repetitions: But then, mayn't they that joyn in your <HI>Li|tany</HI> have wrong Ends too? And don't the Repetitions in both, tend to the &s;ame End? You tell us indeed, that <Q>the&s;e Repetitions are very nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e our Devotion, and keep up our Attention.</Q> p. 19. And won't the Papi&s;ts make the &s;ame Plea, upon the &s;ame Grounds? But unto what, I be&s;eech you, are they likely to rai&s;e our Devotion, and keep up our Attention, when we are doing Nothing but repeat the &s;ame Thing over and over again, unle&s;s it be to an Expectation of our being <HI>heard for our much &s;peaking?</HI> This appears to me their direct Tendency; and I don't know how you can in&s;tance in any <HI>Repetitions</HI> u&s;ed among the Heathen, that carry a greater Shew of this Kind in their Countenance, than the&s;e do.

Let us for In&s;tance, pitch upon that Prayer of the <HI>Prie&s;ts of Baal,</HI> 1 <HI>King</HI> xviii. 25.

<P>But in Ju&s;tification of the&s;e Repetitions, you plead, that <Q><HI>in</HI> P&s;alm <HI>cxxxvi,</HI> there are but Twenty &s;even Ver&s;es; and tho&s;e Words, <HI>For his Mercy endureth forever,</HI> are repeated twenty &s;even times.</Q> And what can you ar|gue from hence, but that becau&s;e we may u&s;e Repetitions in Singing, where Chri&s;t has not forbidden it, we may u&s;e Repetitions in Pray|er, where Chri&s;t has forbidden it.

For <HI>(fir&s;t)</HI> if it were granted, that our Lord did u&s;e the &s;ame Words three times; it was in three di&s;tinct different Prayers; and what is this to the Ca&s;e of u&s;ing needle&s;s Repetitions in the &s;ame Prayer? Did ever any Body object again&s;t praying for the &s;ame Thing, in &s;everal di&s;tinct Prayers? If you pretend, that the&s;e Words were repeated in the &s;ame Prayer you directly contradict the &s;acred Story referred to, where we are expre&s;sly informed, that he came from his Retirement to his Di&s;ciples, the fir&s;t Time, the &s;econd and third Time; and waked them up, conver&s;ed with them; and then returned again to his &s;e|cret Devotion. And (&s;econdly) there is no &s;uch Thing in the Original of that Text you quote, as Chri&s;t's repeating the &s;ame Words. The Original Words are <HI>TON AUTON LO|CON,</HI> which &s;ignifies the <HI>&s;ame Speech,</HI> or the <HI>&s;ame Matter;</HI> but not the <HI>&s;ame Words;</HI> and &s;o it is accordingly rendred in both the <HI>Latin</HI> Ver&s;ions. And it is certain that he did not u&s;e the &s;ame Words. For the Words of his fir&s;t Prayer were, <HI>O my Father, if it be po&s;&s;ible, let this Cup pa&s;s from me; neverthele&s;s, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</HI> ver. 39. But his &s;e|cond

Prayer was thus expre&s;s'd, <HI>O my Father, if this Cup may not pa&s;s away from me except I drink it, thy Will be done.</HI> ver. 42. So that it's plain, our Lord u&s;ed no Liturgy, in that he prayed for the &s;ame Thing in different Words, much le&s;s did he u&s;e any Repetitions at all. So far from it, that in his praying for the &s;ame Thing, in &s;everal di&s;tinct Prayers, he u&s;ed dif|ferent Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>And as for your la&s;t mentioned Text. Was there any Petition twice u&s;ed, or any Thing like it, in the &s;ame Breath? What then could you mean by pretending to it? That he in|voked the Name of God twice is true, but no|thing to the Purpo&s;e. I can't but think it looks pretty hard upon your Cau&s;e, that you have no better Arguments to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>And now I proceed to the Con&s;ideration of what you have to &s;ay in Vindication of your Churches appointing the <HI>Apocrypha</HI> to be read, as a Part of publick Wor&s;hip, while there are a great many Parts of the canonical Scripture, never read in publick. Your fir&s;t An&s;wer is by Way of Recrimination upon your Adver|&s;aries, for complaining of this, <Q>when they them&s;elves have laid by the whole Bible; and never read one Chapter by way of Le&s;&s;on.</Q> But who are the&s;e Adver&s;aries you &s;peak of? It was with me, that you had to do in this De|bate; and you very well know, that it is my

con&s;tant Practice to read a Chapter of the Bi|ble, upon every Occa&s;ion of publick Wor&s;hip.

Our publick For|mula's do (I think) all declare for it. And I confe&s;s my &s;elf ignorant, upon what ju&s;tifi|able Pretence it can be omitted.</P>
<P>Your other An&s;wer is, that <Q>they <HI>(your Ad|ver&s;aries)</HI> know, that <HI>you</HI> never read the <HI>A|pocrypha</HI> as the Word of God, never read it on the Lord's Day, never neglect the Holy Scripture for it.</Q> To which I an&s;wer.

<HI>Angel</HI> (that &s;aid his Name was <HI>Azarias, Tobit's</HI> near Kin&s;man, of the Tribe of <HI>Naphtali, &amp;c.</HI> who in Company with <HI>Tobit's</HI> Son, re&s;cued him out of the Mouth of a Fi&s;h big enough, and fierce enough, it &s;eems, to have devour|ed him; and yet the&s;e two (a couple of nota|ble Trencher Men, I confe&s;s!) eat up the mighty Fi&s;h at a Meal, except his Heart, Gall, and liver, which were re&s;erved for very &s;acred U&s;es; the one of 'em, to cure <HI>Tobit's</HI> Eyes, that were muted out by a Swallow; the other, two to &s;moak away the Devil into the further|mo&s;t Parts of <HI>Egypt,</HI> that he might be bound there, and return no more, to carry on his A|mour with the young Man's Wife.

<P><HI>It &s;eems &s;o. But then I don't under&s;tand, why in the Definition of a Sacrament the&s;e Words are added,</HI> ordained by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, as a Means whereby we receive the &s;ame; and a Pledge to a&s;&s;ure us thereof.</P>

<P>No wonder you don't under&s;tand it; for you confe&s;s your &s;elf to be but a <HI>Novice,</HI> p. 4. and you can't expect to learn every Thing at once. It may'nt be un&s;erviceable therefore, for you to have it explain'd to you. That the&s;e Words do not belong to the Definition of a Sacrament as &s;uch, plainly appears by the following An&s;wer in the Catechi&s;m, where we are told, that there are but the other two Parts, in a Sacrament: But it belongs to a <HI>divine</HI> Sa|crament, to have it ordain'd by Chri&s;t him&s;elf. In&s;titution is indeed of the very E&s;&s;ence of a Sacrament; and Chri&s;t's In&s;titution is what makes it of divine Original.&mdash; But then a hu|man Ordinance &s;uch as the Sign of the Cro&s;s, may be, nay mu&s;t be, according to your Ca|techi&s;m, a Sacrament neverthele&s;s; if it have (tho' by human In&s;titution) both the Parts of a Sacrament. For what can be wanting to make it a Sacrament, if it have all the Parts? To make this a little more familiar to you. It's to be ob&s;erv'd, that the Catechi&s;m counte|nances
<PB N="52" REF="004136_0027_1003B61787C6F398">
this Di&s;tinction of a <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>human</HI> Sacrament, in the immediately foregoing An|&s;wer, where we are taught, that <HI>there are but two Sacraments only,</HI> GENERALLY NECESSARY <HI>to Salvation, that is to &s;ay, Bapti&s;m and the Supper of the Lord.</HI> Where|by it's plainly intimated, that there may be other Sacraments, tho' not <HI>generally nece&s;&s;ary;</HI> and it belongs only to the&s;e two, that are <HI>ge|nerally nece&s;&s;ary</HI> that they be ordained by Chri&s;t him&s;elf <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash; Thus you &s;ee, what Injury your Parents have done you, by neglecting to teach you this Catechi&s;m in your Childhood.

I &s;hall therefore add no more upon this, but re|turn to the Con&s;ideration of what you have further to offer.</P>
</SP>
<P>You inform us, that, <Q>if this Definition of a Sacrament be true, then Kneeling or Stand|ing in Prayer is a Sacrament. For it is a vi|&s;ible Sign of our Fear and Reverence of God; yea my mini&s;terial Band is a Sacrament.&mdash; For that is a vi&s;ible Sign of my being devoted to Chri&s;t in the Mini&s;try.</Q> Well! &s;uppo&s;e this were true, who I be&s;eech you are you di&s;|puting again&s;t? Who have determined the&s;e
<PB N="53" REF="004136_0027_1003B61787C6F398">
two Things to be the only Parts of a Sacra|ment? But I mu&s;t take Leave to inform you, that the&s;e are groundle&s;s Surmizes, unle&s;s you can prove that every one that Kneels or Stands in Prayer, and every Mini&s;ter or Law|yer that wears a Band, are gracious Per&s;ons. Nor would that do neither.&mdash; For the&s;e are not in&s;tituted either by God or Man, to &s;igni|fy any &s;uch Thing.&mdash; And it is the In&s;tituti|on that makes a Sacrament, as I ob&s;erved before. And as I am utterly aver&s;e to all human Sa|craments, &s;o in an e&s;pecial Manner, to the gi|ving by In&s;titution, the Honour of a Sacra|ment to a popi&s;h Idol, as you can't but ac|knowledge the Cro&s;s to be.</P>
<P>I had demanded in my Sermon, why this Honour was done to the Cro&s;s, on which Chri&s;t was crucified, any more than to the Thorns with which he was crowned, to the Traytor by whom he was betrayed; or the malicious Court by which he was condemned? To which you an&s;wer, <Q>becau&s;e the Scripture makes an honourable Mention of the Cro&s;s frequently; but not of <HI>Judas</HI> and the re&s;t.</Q> p. 22. You in&s;tance in two Places of Scrip|ture, <HI>Mat.</HI> xvi. 24. and 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 17. p. 26. But could you &s;eriou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e or any other Scriptures that mention the Cro&s;s, intend thereby the material Cro&s;s upon which Chri&s;t &s;uffered, or the Figure of it made in the

Air? Let us &s;ee what Work we &s;hall make of it, if we under&s;tand the&s;e quoted Scriptures in that Sence.&mdash; <HI>If any Man will come after me, let him take up his Cro&s;s,</HI> (that is let him carry a wooden Cro&s;s on his Back; or keep making an Aerial Cro&s;s on his Forehead) <HI>and follow me. For the preaching of the Cro&s;s,</HI> (that is preaching about a wooden Cro&s;s; or the Sign of it made in the Air) <HI>is to them that pe|ri&s;h Fooli&s;hne&s;s; but unto us which are &s;aved, it is the Power of God.</HI>&mdash; Can you think this a ju&s;t Interpretation of the&s;e Scriptures? If not, why are they quoted, if it be, why is the wooden Cro&s;s laid a&s;ide? Why don't you wear Cro&s;&s;es upon your Brea&s;t? Why are not Cro&s;&s;es painted on your Church Walls; and erected at every Corner of the Streets? Why don't you cro&s;s your &s;elf upon every Occa&s;ion? I believe you will be hard put to it to find any Thing in Scripture, that &s;peaks more honourably of your U&s;e of the Cro&s;s, than of the&s;e Practices of the Papi&s;ts, which you have rejected.&mdash; But the Truth is, wherever the Scripture makes honourable Mention of the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, it intends the Death of Chri&s;t, or Chri&s;t him&s;elf that &s;uffered upon the Cro&s;s; and not either a Cro&s;s of Wood, or the Sign of it.&mdash; How impertinent therefore, are all tho&s;e Pleas or Pretences from Scripture! And the &s;ame An|&s;wer is &s;ufficient for your &s;econd Pretence, that
<PB N="55" REF="004136_0028_1003B664B61569C8">
<HI>the Cro&s;s was reproach'd by Infidels; but &s;o were not the re&s;t.</HI>&mdash; That is, they reproached our Saviour and his Followers, on Account of his accur&s;ed Death.&mdash; And what is this in Fa|vour of the Sign of the Cro&s;s? Did he not &s;uffer this accur&s;ed Death, thro' the Trea&s;on of <HI>Judas,</HI> by the Sentence of the malicious Court by which he was condemned; and with a Crown of Thorns on his Head? And I ven|ture to affirm, that there is no more honoura|ble Mention made in the Scriptures, of the Cro&s;s of Wood on which he &s;uffered, than of the&s;e.&mdash; That is, there is no honourable Menti|on made of either of them.</P>
<P>But its Time to attend upon the An&s;wers you give, to <Q>any that &s;hall be &s;o impertinent, as to a&s;k what Warrant you have from Scrip|ture for the Sign of the Cro&s;s,</Q> p. 25. And you tell us, <Q>The Scripture requires of us, that we expre&s;s our inward Sence of God and Duty towards him, by &s;uch Actions as general Cu&s;tom has made &s;ignificant in like Ca&s;es.</Q> Ibid. But I'm afraid you have not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered this Rule of yours; and what Con&s;equences mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow from it. &mdash; For if this be true, then the Scrip|ture requires of you, that you &s;hould paint God the Father in the Form of an old Man, Our Saviour in the Shape of a Younger Man upon the Cro&s;s; and the Holy-Gho&s;t in the Form of
<PB N="56" REF="004136_0029_1003D79EC5A57AF8">
a Dove.&mdash; You &s;hould keep Images of An|gels and Saints in your Churches; and in your Hou&s;es. For yon know where the&s;e, and mul|titudes more of &s;uch Abominations, are by <HI>general Cu&s;tom, become &s;ignificant of our inward Sence of God and Duty towards him.</HI> If you &s;ay, the&s;e are evil Cu&s;toms, be plea&s;ed to clear the Cu&s;tom in Que&s;tion from that Imputation. And be&s;ides, the Rule you have given, has made no Di&s;tinction in this Ca&s;e. If it had 'twould have been altogether impertinent.</P>
<P>You go on to argue, <HI>"glorying in the Suf|ferings of Chri&s;t is a Duty.</HI> Gal. vi. 14. But good Sir, is there no way to glory in the Sufferings of Chri&s;t, but by making a Cro&s;s on the Forehead? For my Part I can't conceive how this is glorying in his Sufferings at all.</P>
<P>You add, <Q>making the Sign of the Cro&s;s, is an Action which by univer&s;al Cu&s;tom in all Ages, &s;ince the Apo&s;tles Time&punc; has been ap|plyed to &s;ignify our glorying in the Sufferings of Chri&s;t,</Q> A bold A&s;&s;ertion, without any Pretence of Proof! Be plea&s;ed in your next to &s;hew, that the Cro&s;s in Bapti&s;m was ever once u&s;ed during the three fir&s;t Centuries; and it will be more to the Purpo&s;e.&mdash; But &s;uppo&s;e it were &s;o, &s;ince it was not u&s;ed in the Apo&s;tles Time, I enquire by what Authority was that Cu&s;tom introduced.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="004136_0029_1003D79EC5A57AF8">There is one Thing more, propo&s;ed as an Argument for this U&s;e of the Cro&s;s; and that is, <Q>'Tis Part of our Chri&s;tian Liberty, that God allows us to expre&s;s our Devotion, in &s;uch becoming Actions, as univer&s;al Cu&s;tom has made &s;ignificant.</Q> p. 27. But is it Part of your Chri&s;tian Liberty, to impo&s;e the&s;e Things upon tho&s;e that &s;cruple them? Is your Li|berty infringed, if you want Liberty to ex|communicate the half of the Kingdom? Have none any Claim to Chri&s;tian Liberty, but your &s;elves? Or is it an Attempt upon your Li|berty, to peaceably debate the&s;e Things with you? I know not how you can pretend, that your Liberty is in the lea&s;t invaded, unle&s;s in the&s;e In&s;tances. &mdash; Thus I have, tho' but briefly, yet (I think) fully an&s;wered all your Arguments for the U&s;e of the Sign of the Cro&s;s in Bapti&s;m; and &s;hall under this Head only &s;ubjoin &s;ome Qeries, which I hope you will particularly an&s;wer in your next.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 1.

<P><PB N="58" REF="004136_0030_1003D7AEB43BB058"><HI>Q.</HI> 2. Whether, &s;ince the Sign of the Cro&s;s has no divine In&s;titution, and has been abu&s;ed to the mo&s;t abominable Super&s;tition and Idola|try, it ought not to be treated as <HI>Hezekiah</HI> did the brazen Serpent, and called <HI>Nebu&s;htan,</HI> 2 <HI>Kings</HI> viii. 4? And whether God's Directions to his ancient People, that they &s;hould utterly de&s;troy all the Remainders and the Monuments of Idolatry, all that had been abu&s;ed and pol|luted by an Idolatrous U&s;e, be not from the Nature and Rea&s;on of the Thing obligatory upon us?

<P><HI>Q</HI> 3.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 4. Whether the cur&s;ed In&s;trument of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's extream Sufferings, &s;hould (on the Account of its having been &s;uch to him) be had in highe&s;t Honour and Reverence by us?</P>

which I have already proved from your Pray|er Book to have the Nature of a Sacrament, by the In&s;titution of your Church?</P>
<P>I am now prepared to con&s;ider your Argu|ments for <HI>Kneeling</HI> at the Lords Supper. And I &s;hall begin with that which you triumph mo&s;t upon. <Q>But does he think <HI>(&s;ay you)</HI> that the Apo&s;tles continued eating or &s;itting, whil&s;t Chri&s;t was at Prayer over the Bread and Wine. &mdash; But if the Apo&s;tles ro&s;e up or kneeled, whil&s;t Chri&s;t prayed, where does he find that they &s;at down again to receive imme|diately after the Con&s;ecration.

We are told by one of them, That <HI>when the Hour was come, he</HI> SAT DOWN, <HI>and the twelve Apo&s;tles with him, &mdash; And he took the Cup and gave Thanks, &amp;c.

And is not their &s;itting down to the Table at the Beginning; and their ri&s;ing up from it when they had done, a &s;ufficient Evidence, that they partook of this Ordinance &s;itting? If not, I di&s;pair of ever
<PB N="60" REF="004136_0031_1003D7C148CA4268">
&s;eeing any Thing proved, by the mo&s;t plain, po&s;&s;itive and intelligible Expre&s;&s;ions. There|fore as to your curious Que&s;tion, whether the Apo&s;tles continued &s;itting, whil&s;t Chri&s;t was at Prayers over the Bread and Wine? Or whe|ther they aro&s;e and &s;at down again after the Con&s;ecration? I an&s;wer, they might do ei|ther the one or the other. If the former, it would not be the fir&s;t Time that they &s;at by our Saviour's expre&s;s Commandment, while he prayed for a Ble&s;&s;ing upon his Table. See <HI>Mat.</HI> xiv. 19, <HI>And he commanded the Multi|tude to &s;it down on the Gra&s;s, and looking up to Heaven, he ble&s;&s;ed and brake, &amp;c.</HI> So al&s;o <HI>Mat.</HI> xv. 35. Nor do I &s;ee any Incongruity in &s;uppo&s;ing on the other Hand, that they ro&s;e up whil&s;t Chri&s;t was at Prayer; and &s;at down again after the Con&s;ecration. Certain it is, if they did ri&s;e at the Con&s;ecration of the Ele|ments, they did &s;it down again, or el&s;e they could not ri&s;e from the Table, when the Sup|per was ended. In &s;hort, whether the Apo&s;tles &s;at or &s;tood whil&s;t Chri&s;t was at Prayer, we know that &s;tanding is by divine In&s;titution, a proper praying Po&s;ture, which is a &s;ufficient Warrant for our Conduct in &s;tanding up, whil&s;t we pray for a Ble&s;&s;ing on the Elements. And the Example of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, is a &s;ufficient Warrant for our &s;itting, when we partake of them. We do not know, whether
<PB N="61" REF="004136_0031_1003D7C148CA4268">
they &s;at or &s;tood whil&s;t Chri&s;t ble&s;&s;ed the Ele|ments, and therefore may attend upon that Part of the In&s;titution, in a proper praying Po&s;ture. But we do know that they &s;at, whil&s;t they partook of the Elements, and therefore may not deviate from that Pattern. Imperti|nent therefore are all tho&s;e &s;pecious Pretences, urged from Bi&s;hop <HI>Beveridge,</HI> of Kneeling out of greater Humility, Reverence, and the like. For where will the Charge of wanting Reverence, Humility, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> terminate? Was &s;itting the Po&s;ture that Chri&s;t him&s;elf appoint|ed; and &s;hall his own in&s;titutions be charged with Irreverence? Or can you pretend to re|fine upon his In&s;titutions, and order Things better than he has done? Would not this be the highe&s;t Reflection upon his Wi&s;dom and Authority? Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord has given us an Example, which ought to be a &s;tanding Pat|tern to his Church, this we are bound to imi|tate. We have no Allowance to decline from it, no Authority to alter or change it, no War|rant to contrive a more humble, decent, or reverend Po&s;ture, than he has exemplified. And are therefore certainly &s;afe&s;t, whil&s;t we are <HI>Followers of him as dear Children.</HI> For Obedience is the be&s;t Humility.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore again enquire; &s;ince the Church of <HI>England</HI> di&s;claims any Adoration to the Elements, why does &s;he u&s;e the Po&s;ture of

Adoration? Why will &s;he &s;ymbolize with the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> in their Adoration of their Breaden God?

I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that your pretended pa|rallel Ca&s;e, is altogether impertinent: For when I kneel before a Chair in Prayer, I don't kneel down to any Sign, Repre&s;entation or I|mage, with my Mind and Eyes fixed upon that, as you do, when you kneel at the Lord's Supper; and therefore can be in no Danger of Idolatry, when I kneel immediately to the highe&s;t Object of Wor&s;hip, without any inter|mediate Sign.</P>
<P>You deny that Kneeling was brought in by the Papi&s;ts.&mdash; And in An&s;wer, I make you this fair offer.&mdash; If you'll prove that Kneel|ing was u&s;ed in any Church upon Earth, at the Lord's-Supper, before Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation was brought in, I will acknowledge my Mi&s;take, as publickly as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>You complain of my &s;aying, that the glo|rious Author of this Fea&s;t, is plea&s;ed to &s;toop to a friendly Familiarity with his Gue&s;ts; and &s;eem ignorant of what I mean by it. &mdash; I will therefore inform you, that I mean by it, that Chri&s;t is dealing by us in this Ordinance, as a great Monarch does by his mean Subjects, whom he invites to a Fea&s;t.&mdash; He is &s;uffer|ing

us to <HI>&s;it down with the King at his Table;</HI> and allowing us mo&s;t near and intimate Com|munion with him&s;elf.&mdash; He is here calling upon us &s;aying, <HI>eat O Friends, Drink, yea drink abundantly, O my beloved.</HI>&mdash; And now I'll conculde this Head al&s;o, with a few Que|ries, which I hope you'll particularly an&s;wer in your next.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 1. I fir&s;t enquire, whether Bowing down or Kneeling to Signs or Repre&s;entations of God, and heavenly Things, does not incur the Guilt of Idolatry and Image Wor&s;hip, e|ven when the Adoration does ultimately re|fer to God him&s;elf? Whether this &s;ort of Ido|latry ben't expre&s;ly forbidden, by the Letter of the &s;econd Commandment? Whether the Elements in the Lords Supper, be not Signs and Repre&s;entations of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and therefore, whether this don't look too much like that &s;ort of Idolatry, to bow down or kneel to the&s;e Elements; or whether it has not at lea&s;t too much Tendency to lead weak and ignorant Per&s;ons to it?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 2. Whether Meditation and ejaculatory Prayer, ben't the proper Exerci&s;es to be atten|ded at the Time of Participation; and whe|ther Kneeling be an in&s;tituted Po&s;ture for the attending tho&s;e Duties?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 3. Whether appointing a different Po&s;|ture in this Ordinance, from that in&s;tituted by
<PB N="64" REF="004136_0033_1003D7F3207C2980">
our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, under a Pretence of Humility, be not according to the Letter of that Text, <HI>Col.</HI> ii. 22. <HI>A Shew of Wi&s;dom in Will-Wor&s;hip, and Humility?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 4. Whether tho&s;e can be in any Danger of di&s;plea&s;ing our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who imi|tate his own Example in the Po&s;ture they u&s;e at this Ordinance? And whether there be no Danger on the other Hand, in deviating from the Pattern he him&s;elf has &s;et us?</P>
<P>The next Thing that offers, is your Vindica|tion of your Sureties in Bapti&s;m.&mdash; Upon this Head you tell us, that <Q>It's no Wonder I find Fault with it; For I have mi&s;took the whole Matter.&mdash; Here the Sureties make not one Promi&s;e of any Thing, that they will do for the Child; but only are the Mouth of the Child; and the Child promi&s;es and pro|fe&s;&s;es by them as Proxies.</Q> p. 30. 31. Then according to this account of the Matter, the Sureties are under no Obligation at all.&mdash; <HI>They don't make one Promi&s;e of any Thing, that they will do for the Child.</HI>&mdash; What then do you mean by &s;aying; that <Q>Tho' &s;ome Sure|ties are carele&s;s of their Duty in this Regard, yet others do it very well.</Q> What Duty I be|&s;eech you? They are under no Obligation.&mdash; <HI>they are</HI> ONLY <HI>the Mouth of the Child,</HI> to let the Congregation know for their Edification, what the Child ought to have &s;poke, if he had
<PB N="65" REF="004136_0033_1003D7F3207C2980">
been able to &s;peak. What &s;ignifies it to tell us, that <HI>we may &s;ee the Duties of the Sureties, in the Exhortation, at the End of the Office;</HI> when they are under no Obligation to regard that Exhortation, any more than their Neigh|bours? They have done their Part already. <HI>They are only the Mouth of the Child,</HI> to &s;peak in his Name; and that they have performed. And what is all this, but a meer Piece of Pa|geantry? Could not the Mini&s;ter acquaint the People with the Nature of this Ordinance, and the Duties belonging to it, without all this a|do? And does not his Office oblige him to it? How came the Sureties by their Call, to preach to the Congregation? <HI>The Child</HI> (you &s;ay) <HI>&s;peaks and profe&s;&s;es by them, as his Pro|xies.</HI> As his Proxies for what? Who con&s;titu|ted them his Proxies? How came they &s;uch with|out his Leave? Or how does the Child promi&s;e and profe&s;s by them, when he knows Nothing of what they &s;ay? How ludicrous is the Pretence! How vain and trifling is the whole Affair, if this be a true State of the Ca&s;e! But I &s;u&s;|pect, that upon an impartial View, it will ap|pear in very different Colours.</P>

<P><HI>I &s;ee I was in a Mi&s;take. But &s;ince they have taken the&s;s Vows upon them, they mu&s;t en|deavour to perform them.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>Thus your own Catechi&s;m and Prayer-Book determines the Ca&s;e again&s;t you. It's mo&s;t certain, the Sureties do make all the&s;e Vows and Promi&s;es for the Child, according to the Churches own Interpretation of the Obliga|tions; and it is as certain, that the&s;e are Pro|mi&s;es beyond human Strength or Ability to perform. For who can promi&s;e for an Infant, that it &s;hall have the Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on, much le&s;s that it &s;hall have the highe&s;t Exerci&s;e of Grace? As I ob&s;erved before. Nor may we pretend to (for we may not expect) divine A&s;|&s;i&s;tance, in invading the divine Prerogative.</P>
<P>I had before ob&s;erved, that God has never given, never promi&s;ed A&s;&s;i&s;tance to any Man, in changing the Hearts, &s;anctifying the Na|tures, and governing the Affections and Pa&s;&s;i|ons of others. Upon which you exclaim; &mdash; <Q>This I confe&s;s is as fine a Piece of Divinity, as ever I heard in my Life.</Q> And &s;o go on to gravely argue. <Q>If this Doctrine be true, it renders not only the Office of Sureties vain;
<PB N="68" REF="004136_0035_1003B67FFADA8B28">
but all Endeavours of Parents to educate their Children. And why does our Author preach, and endeavour to convert his People, when God will never a&s;&s;i&s;t him, nor any Man, for the obtaining that End?</Q> But what a Pity it is, you could not under&s;tand this plain ea&s;y and familiar Sentence, before you got into &s;uch a Heat, as to cry out &s;o vehemently, <Q>How madly will &s;ome Men lay about them, when they de&s;ign to &s;care People from the Church!</Q> Can you &s;eriou&s;ly think, That there is no Dif|ference between having God's. A&s;&s;i&s;tance IN changing Mens Hearts efficiently; and in u&s;|ing the appointed Means, <HI>for the Obtaining that End?</HI> Is it the &s;ame Thing to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted IN doing the Work our &s;elves; or in being only In&s;truments in the Hands of the great Workman? Or in other Words. Is it the &s;ame Thing for us to do it, or God to do it? To apply this to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. The Sure|ties promi&s;e what none but God can perform. They promi&s;e, that the Heart of the Child &s;hall be changed, the Nature &s;anctified, and the Af|fections and Pa&s;&s;ions be under con&s;tant good Government. But are they Gods! Is this in their Power? Or can they even expect di|vine A&s;&s;i&s;tance IN doing that which no Man ever did do, what no Man ever could do, or ever will do; and what belongs to the divine Royalty to do? Can they enable the Child to
<PB N="69" REF="004136_0035_1003B67FFADA8B28">
<HI>renounce the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, to believe all the Articles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, &amp;c.?</HI> If not, how can they promi&s;e that he &s;hall do it; &s;ince they have no Power, nor are ever like to have Power, to endue him with that Grace, which they have vowed and pro|mi&s;ed that he &s;hall live in the Exerci&s;e of? I hope now you &s;ee, what little Rea&s;on you had for that pa&s;&s;ionate Exclamation. &mdash; And thus I'll conclude this Particular, with a few Queries, unto which I &s;hall expect your An|&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> 1. Have not Infants a Claim to Bapti&s;m, on Account of their Parents Covenant Rela|tion? According to that, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vii. 14. <HI>El&s;e were your Children unclean, but now are they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 2. Since Infants are baptized in their Parents Right, &s;hould not their Parents dedi|cate them to Chri&s;t in this Ordinance, and come under proper Covenant Obligations on their Behalf, to whom it belongs, <HI>to bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, Eph.</HI> vi. 4?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 3. Whether you can agreable to the Rules in the Prayer Book, allow Parents to do their Duty in this Re&s;pect, to dedicate their Children to Chri&s;t in this Ordinance; and to be (as they ought to be) Sureties for their Re|ligious Education?</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="004136_0036_1003D835C65133E8"><HI>Q.</HI> 4. Whether accepting of the Sureti&s;hip of Strangers, has not a direct Tendency to make Parents unmindful of their Duty to|wards their Children; and whether it be'nt therefore a great Prejudice, in&s;tead of a Fur|therance to the religious Education of the Children?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 5. Whether there be any Direction or Warrant in the Word of God, for Sureties in Bapti&s;m?</P>
<P>But it's Time to take &s;ome Notice of your Vindication of the <HI>Burial Office;</HI> <Q><HI>and</HI> here you ob&s;erve to us, that when you &s;ay <HI>in &s;ure and certain Hope of the Re&s;urrection,</HI> &amp;c. It is only a Repetition of that Article of the Creed, We believe there will be a Re&s;urrection of the Body; and it is very injurious to &s;ay, that this nece&s;&s;arily relates to the dead Per&s;on, &s;o as to imply a certainty of his happy Re&s;urrection.</Q> I am then at &s;ome Difficulty to under&s;tand, what you mean by &s;aying, <Q><HI>That it never was the De&s;ign of the Church, that it &s;hould be u&s;ed over a Per&s;on,</HI> let him have lived never &s;o wicked a Life; and dyed in the very Act of Sinning. <HI>I know of no Mini&s;ter that would; and I am &s;ure I would not, u&s;e it over &s;uch a Per&s;on.</HI></Q> But I pray, why would you not u&s;e it over &s;uch a Per&s;on? Is it not as &s;uitable that the People &s;hould be put in Mind of the general Re&s;urrection, at the Funeral of a wic|ked

<P>As to your trifling Accu&s;ation, that the Parti|cle <HI>(the)</HI> was left out in my Sermon.

<P><HI>Q.</HI> 1. Whether it does not directly tend to harden loo&s;e Sinners in a carele&s;s &s;en&s;ual Life, to hear the eternal Salvation of &s;uch as them|&s;elves, &s;o po&s;&s;itively and &s;olemnly declared, in your Addre&s;&s;es to God?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 2. Whether it ben't an Affront to the glorious Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth, to &s;o|lemnly declare in his Pre&s;ence, and prai&s;e him for, the Salvation of tho&s;e, who have never by their Lives and Conver&s;ations evidenced their Conver&s;ion to God; and thereby their Title to eternal Happine&s;s?</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="004136_0038_1003D85DD677B580"><HI>Q.</HI> 3. Whether the&s;e Things which are &s;uch ju&s;t Matter of Prejudice, can do any good to the Dead or to Living; and if not, why are they retained to the Offence and Scandal of &s;o many good Chri&s;tians?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 4. Is it not much &s;afer to let the&s;e Things alone, that are at the be&s;t &s;o very &s;u|&s;picious?</P>
<P>The next Thing that offers, is your perem|tory and authoritative Ab&s;olving Men from all their Sins, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t. And do you verily believe (as you are ordered by the Pray|er Book to declare) that there is Authority committed to you, to ab&s;olve Men from all their Sins? If &s;o, what Fault can you find with the Popi&s;h Indulgencies? Have not the Po|pi&s;h Prie&s;ts as much Authority in this Ca&s;e as you have? And can't they cite that Text <HI>Joh.</HI> xx. 23. in Ju&s;tification of their Conduct, as pertinently as you can? If it gives Authority to you to ob&s;olve Men from all their Sins, it al&s;o gives Authority to them to ab&s;olve Men from all their Sins. But if Chri&s;t has yet re|tained the Prerogative of Pardoning Mens Sins in his own Hands, it is impertinently urged by you, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But you pretend, that you mean no more, than that <Q>you think his Repentance is &s;incere; and that if it be, God will certainly forgive
<PB N="75" REF="004136_0038_1003D85DD677B580">
him.</Q> But then why do you declare any more than you mean? If you intend no more than that God will ob&s;olve him, upon his true &amp; &s;incere Repentance, why do you declare, that you ab&s;olve him from all his Sins? Is God's Ab&s;olving, and your Ab&s;olving, the &s;ame Thing? Who has placed you in God's Stead; and ve&s;ted you with that incommunicable Branch of his Prerogative, to Pardon Sins? To what Purpo&s;e is your Quotation from Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> that <HI>the Pa&s;tors of the Churches may as God's Officers declare the conditional general Pardon, &amp;c.</HI> wherereas it is an Authoritative &s;pecial Pardon, that we find fault with. A Pardon <HI>by Virtue of the Power left by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t to his Church.</HI> A Pardon pro|nounced by Vertue of <HI>his Authority committed to the Prie&s;t.</HI> A Pardon not only pray'd for, but Authoritatively pronounced. <HI>I ab&s;olve you, &amp;c.</HI> And do you think indeed, that there is no Difference, between a Declaration of con|ditional and Authoritative Pardon? Or be|tween the Declaration of a general Pardon to all that truely repent and believe; and a &s;pe|cial unconditional Pardon, to this particular Per&s;on, upon a bare Pre&s;umption of his Since|rity? I mu&s;t needs &s;ay (whatever you in par|ticular may intend, when you pronounce the Ab&s;olution) the Words are very exceptionable, and of a very ill Sound. And I can't be re|conciled

to that Office where the Mini&s;ter mu&s;t &s;ay one Thing, and mean another.</P>
<P>Why, I be&s;eech you, does he that finds Fault with the Ab&s;olution, at the &s;ame Time con|demn both the Sacraments, as you &s;ugge&s;t? Is God's Conditional Offer and Confirmation of Pardon at the Sacraments, the &s;ame Thing with the Mini&s;ter's ab&s;olute authoritative De|claration, That he ab&s;olve the &s;ick Per&s;on from all his Sins? How impertinent is this Pretence!</P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;pend Time to debate with you the Meaning of that Text in <HI>Joh.</HI> xx. 23. which you &s;eem to build upon, &s;ince you your &s;elf don't pretend, that it authorizes an ab&s;o|lute authoritative Ab&s;olution, which is the only Thing here in Que&s;tion. But &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that this Text is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to imply no more, than a gracious Promi&s;e to the regular Exerci&s;e of Church Di&s;cipline. When by the Di&s;cipline of the Church, &s;can|dalous Offences are regularly remitted or re|tained, this is ratified in Heaven. Some there are (I confe&s;s) that under&s;tand it of a mini&s;te|rial and conditional Declaration of God's For|givene&s;s. But no Prote&s;tant that I know of, &s;o much as pretends, that this Text gives any Man Authority, to actually di&s;charge Men from their Guilt; which is what your Office in Que&s;tion &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e.

&s;o much as to po&s;itively declare, that their Sins are forgiven; tho' this is what you &s;eem to have e&s;pecially brought the Text to prove. I &s;hall add no more under this Head; but only a few Queries, which you'll be &s;o kind as to give a particular An&s;wer to.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 1. Has it not a direct Tendency to give ignorant Men a vain Confidence of their good E&s;tate, to hear a Mini&s;ter po&s;itively and Au|thoritatively pronounce the Forgivene&s;s of all their Sins, in whatever Sence the Mini&s;ter him&s;elf may under&s;tand the Words?</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 2. If the Church has any good and &s;afe Meaning in that Office, why was not her Meaning plainly and intelligibly expre&s;&s;ed? And why is this &s;tumbling Block in the Way? See <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 13.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> 3.

<P>Let us next &s;ee whether your Rea&s;onings will conclude in Favour of the <HI>Holy Days,</HI> ap|pointed by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and by the Church of <HI>England.</HI> I reminded you in my Sermon, that the Apo&s;tle particularly com|plains of the <HI>Galatians,</HI> that they <HI>ob&s;erved Days and Months and Times and Years,</HI> on which Account, he was <HI>afraid he had be&s;tow|ed Labour upon them in vain, Gal.</HI> iv. 10, 11. I endeavour'd to &s;hew, that this Text militated as much again&s;t the Holy Days ob&s;erved by the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as again&s;t tho&s;e ob&s;er|ved by the <HI>Galatians;</HI> that if it was unlawful to the&s;e, it mu&s;t be &s;o al&s;o to us. And why did you not vouch&s;afe &s;ome An&s;wer to this? Had you Nothing to reply? Or did you think it would be more popular to endeavour, to re|tort the &s;ame Accu&s;ation upon us, than to di|rectly oppo&s;e and contradict the Scripture? &mdash; <Q>Methinks this <HI>(you &s;ay)</HI> &s;ounds very oddly, in the Mouth of a Pre&s;byterian, when they ob|&s;erve Holy Days as well as we.</Q> And then demand, <Q>By what Authority are Di&s;&s;enters Lectures kept; and in <HI>New-England</HI> annual Fa&s;ts and Thank&s;giving Days enjoined? &amp;c.</Q> p. 40, 41. &mdash; Your Pretence of our Lectures being Holy Days, is too trivial to de&s;erve any Notice, &s;ince in this Ca&s;e, there is no Time
<PB N="79" REF="004136_0040_1003D88B76707278">
&s;anctified, con&s;ecrated, or dedicated to God. There never was any more intended or pre|tended by Lecture Days, than an Agreement to meet together upon &s;ome &s;et Day and Hour, to hear a Sermon, and to attend upon the other religious Exerci&s;es that &s;hould accompany Preaching. And I hope that you'll allow that this is done by God's Authority, who has ex|pre&s;ly required Mini&s;ters to <HI>preach</HI> (and con|&s;equently People to hear) <HI>in Sea&s;on, and out of Sea&s;on.</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 2.</P>
<P>And as to your other Demand, by what Au|thority are our Fa&s;t Days, and Thank&s;giving Days enjoyn'd? I an&s;wer, by God's Authori|ty. God has given us Examples and Directi|ons in his Word, that when we are under &s;pe|cial Calls of Providence to it, we &s;hould &s;et a|part Days to the&s;e Purpo&s;es. We have parti|cular Directions how a Fa&s;t Day &s;hould be ce|lebrated; and to what End, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> lviii. 3. for|ward. And many Examples as well as Pre|cepts for the Ob&s;ervation of &s;uch Days. See 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xx. 3. <HI>Neh.</HI> ix. throughout. <HI>Jonah</HI> iii. 7. <HI>Joel</HI> i. 14. and ii. 15. <HI>Mat.</HI> vi. 17, 18. <HI>Mark.</HI> ii. 20 And in many other Places. &mdash; And the Argument is the very &s;ame, for Days of Thank&s;giving. Tho' we have not Authori|ty from God to make any Time holy; yet we have Authority to &s;et apart Time for the&s;e ho|ly Services, when his Providence calls for it.
<PB N="80" REF="004136_0041_1003D89825004A40">
In Obedience to his Authority, <HI>when we have eaten and are full,</HI> we may <HI>ble&s;s the Lord, for the good Land which he hath given us. Deut.</HI> iii 10 We may <HI>prai&s;e him in the Mid&s;t of the Congregation: Our Prai&s;e be of him in the great Congregation.</HI> And we may <HI>pay our Vows be|fore them that fear him. P&s;.</HI> xxii. 22, 25. We may <HI>offer the Sacrifice of Thank&s;giving, and call upon the Name of the Lord.</HI> We may <HI>pay our Vows unto the Lord, in the Pre&s;ence of all his People, P&s;.</HI> cxvi. 17, 18. and we may agree upon &s;ome Time to that Purpo&s;e, accor|ding as the &s;pecial Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence call for the&s;e Thank Offerings. &mdash; Thus you &s;ee one In&s;tance of very great Di&s;parity be|tween your Holy Days, and the&s;e that you would have thought parallel to them. Ours are of God's directing and appointing: Yours without any Direction or Warrant from him. And I think it is not very good Arguing, that becau&s;e we may ob&s;erve Days which God has appointed, that therefore we may con&s;ecrate Days which he has not appointed. Be&s;ides the&s;e Days are &s;et apart on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, and for &s;uch Services as God has alwaies, and every where approved of in his Word; where|as the greate&s;t Part of your Holy Days are &s;et apart on &s;uch Occa&s;ions as God no where, ever approves of in his Word. For In&s;tance, I think you won't pretend to any Scripture Ap|probation
<PB N="81" REF="004136_0041_1003D89825004A40">
of any Saints Days, much le&s;s of &s;uch a Number of 'em. And therefore in this Re&s;pect al&s;o, there is a great Di&s;parity in the pretended Parallel Ca&s;es. Moreover the Di&s;pari|ty is al&s;o manife&s;t in this. The Days we appoint for the&s;e &s;pecial Services, are occa&s;ionally ac|commodated to the pre&s;ent Di&s;pen&s;ations and Calls of Providence. Your Holy Days by be|ing unalterably Stated, are often directly contrary thereto.&mdash; When Providence <HI>calls for Mourning and girding with Sack-Cloth,</HI> your Prayer Book often calls for Fea&s;t|ing, and &s;o on the Contrary, as I have ob&s;erv|ed before. I may add, That the Days we &s;et apart for the beforementioned Services, accur but &s;eldom, upon &s;pecial emergent Occa&s;ions. Whereas your Prayer Book appoints above half the Year to be kept as Holy Time. How con|&s;i&s;tent with the fourth Commandment, it be|longs to you to inform us. Allow us to ob&s;erve once more. In keeping Days of Fa&s;ting and Thank&s;givings, we <HI>are followers of tho&s;e,</HI> who from the fir&s;t Ages of the Church, <HI>have by Faith and Patience inherited the Promi&s;es.</HI> &mdash; Whereas in the Ob&s;ervation of the&s;e Particu|lar Holy Days, you have no higher, nor bet|ter Example than the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> And by far the greate&s;t Part of them have been brought in by her &s;ince her antichri&s;tian Apo|&s;tacy.

Thus you &s;ee, you have not been very &s;uccesful in this Attempt.</P>
<P>As to your Rea&s;oning from the Days of <HI>Pu|rim</HI> and the Fea&s;t of Dedication, it may be &s;ufficient to tran&s;cribe a Reply to it, written before you was born. <Q>The Days of <HI>Purim E&s;th.</HI> ix. were &s;even Hundred Years &s;ince ob|jected by <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> unto the <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> and &s;ince by all <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> that have written again&s;t <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> about Ceremonies, as <HI>Gregorius de Valentia, Belarmine, Suarez.</HI> And we need not &s;eek for new An&s;wers about it; for that which our Divines have an&s;wered to the Pa|pi&s;ts is &s;ufficient in two Words. <HI>1.</HI> That it cannot be evinced, that the&s;e Days of <HI>Purim</HI> were religious Fea&s;ts. <HI>Junius</HI> &s;aith <HI>Preceptum fuit Politicum,</HI> they were only Days of civil re|joicing, they are called only the <HI>Days of Purim,</HI> not the <HI>Holy Days of Purim.</HI> They are not called <HI>Chaggim.</HI> No particular Sacrifice was appointed; nor any holy Convocation of the People enjoin'd. The Ordinance required but Fea&s;ting and Joy; and &s;ending of Portions to one another. The Re&s;t mentioned in <HI>E&s;th.</HI> ix. was from their Enemies. So much Work as might &s;tand with a fea&s;ting Day, was not forbidden. &mdash; <HI>2.</HI> Upon Suppo&s;ition of a re|ligious Fea&s;t in&s;tituted by <HI>Mordecai,</HI> He did it, &s;aid Dr. <HI>Whitaker,</HI> God in&s;piring him; and peradventure by order of &s;ome Prophet,
<PB N="83" REF="004136_0042_1003D89FE3681E10">
as <HI>Zech. viii.</HI> they changed their Fa&s;ts into Fea&s;ts, by the Mouth of the Lord, by the Mini|&s;try of the Prophet. And tho' we do not read expre&s;ly, that either God or any Prophet did require this Fea&s;t of <HI>Purim;</HI> yet forasmuch as it &s;tands approved in Scripture, there is no Doubt but it was done by Warrant from God.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The <HI>Fea&s;t of Dedication, Joh. x. 22, 23.</HI> hath al&s;o been objected, from the Time of the <HI>Walden&s;es.</HI> But it is not certainly known what Dedication this was, and whether meer|ly of human In&s;titution. Some take it for that which <HI>Solomon</HI> appointed. Some a&s;cribe it to <HI>Ezra,</HI> others to the <HI>Maccabees.</HI> Neither is there any Evidence, that Chri&s;t approved it. The Text only &s;aith, that he walked then in <HI>Solomon's</HI> Porch, which he might do, without ob&s;erving or approving it. If it was nothing but a Tradition of the Elders, we may be &s;ure that Chri&s;t who te&s;tified again&s;t other Inventi|ons of Men, did never ob&s;erve this.</Q> Thus you &s;ee that it yet lies upon you to prove, that the Days of <HI>Purim</HI> were ever ob&s;erved by the <HI>Jews,</HI> as a religious Fea&s;t. For it is cer|tain that there were no Exerci&s;es purely reli|gious, required by the In&s;titution to be attended upon tho&s;e Days, as on all other Religious Fea&s;ts. And it belongs to you to prove, that if they were religious Fea&s;ts, that they were
<PB N="84" REF="004136_0043_1003D8AA028DB3A8">
not appointed by divine In&s;piration. &mdash; For <HI>Mordecai</HI> that in&s;tituted that Fea&s;t, is general|ly &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Penman of the Book of <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> and con&s;equently divinly in&s;pired. &mdash; And it al&s;o lies upon you to prove that the Fea&s;t of Dedication was that in&s;tituted by the <HI>Maccabees;</HI> and that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t did ever ob&s;erve and approve that Fea&s;t, nie|ther of which is capable of Proof. You tell us indeed, that <Q>Chri&s;t was no Di&s;&s;enter; but came many Miles in Winter, to keep this Fea&s;t.</Q> p. 44 But how does this appear? There is not a Word of that Nature in the Sacred Sto|ry. His walking in <HI>Solomons Porch,</HI> is no Proof of it. He might take that Opportunity of a Congre&s;s of People, as he did all other proper Opportunities, to do good, without any Approbation of the Fea&s;t. Such is the &s;andy Foundation upon which your <HI>Holy Days</HI> are built.</P>

Or if they were in an immedi|ate Succe&s;&s;ion, how were they Re&s;pon&s;es, &s;ince they were &s;everal Services, from &s;everal Com|panies or Congregations; and from &s;everal Places? And la&s;tly, the&s;e are but my&s;tical and vi&s;ionary Repre&s;entations, and no Wor&s;hip actually performed by Saints and Angels in Heaven, at all. The Heaven here repre&s;ent|ed, is generally under&s;tood by all Interpreters

of Note, to be the true Church of Chri&s;t upon Earth, called Heaven, from her heavenly Ori|ginal, and heavenly Doctrine and Manners; in Oppo&s;ition to the Antichri&s;tian Church, that had no Relation to Heaven. And the&s;e imaginary Re&s;pon&s;es, to be Nothing el&s;e, but the Prai&s;es of the &s;everal Parts of the Chri&s;ti|an Church, as well from the newly converted <HI>Jews,</HI> as <HI>Gentiles,</HI> a&s;cribed to God for the De|&s;truction of Antichri&s;t. And what Foundation have you then, for your triumphant Con|clu&s;ion?</P>
<P>Thus I've taken particular Notice of all the Arguments you have brought in Vindication of your Rites and Ceremonies; and the Ap|peal mu&s;t be made to the World, whether the Exceptions in my Sermon are not fully ju&s;ti|fied. But what was the Rea&s;on that you had not one Word in Favour of your <HI>canonical Ve&s;t|ments,</HI> your <HI>Womens &s;peaking in the Churches;</HI> and the manife&s;t Curruptions in the old Tran|&s;lation of the P&s;ams, yet in u&s;e? Do you ac|knowledge the&s;e to be indefen&s;ible?</P>
<P>And now &s;hall we con&s;ider what you can &s;ay in defence of your Impo&s;ition of all the&s;e Things. &mdash; You &s;eem to acknowledge the Charge, that you do impo&s;e all the&s;e Things; and have nothing to vindicate your &s;o doing but this, that <Q>there neither is nor can be any Church upon Earth, but what hath Terms of
<PB N="94" REF="004136_0048_1003D8CB354E06D0">
Communion and Ceremonies impo&s;ed, which God hath not expre&s;ly commanded.</Q> p. 51. And that <HI>'the Pre&s;byterians do the &s;ame.'</HI> Now &s;uppo&s;e this were true. It is either well or ill done of all the&s;e Churches, thus to im|po&s;e upon People's Con&s;ciences. If well done, you could ea&s;ily have an&s;wered my Argu|ments again&s;t the&s;e Impo&s;itions. If ill done, it's no Ju&s;tification of your Guilt, that others are in like Manner Guilty. The&s;e Arguments therefore conclude again&s;t you, as well as again&s;t all others that are equally chargeable. Be&s;ides, if others al&s;o are guilty of &s;ome Impo&s;itions, it does not appear from thence, that they are guilty of impo&s;ing Things equally di&s;agreea|ble to the Word of God, equally wounding to Men's Con&s;ciences; and equally de&s;tructive to the Peace and Purity of the Church. But let us con&s;ider how you prove your confident A&s;&s;er|tion. Did we ever puni&s;h or excommunicate any Man for believing the Lord's Supper &s;hould be admini&s;tred at Evening; or for not approving the <HI>New-England</HI> Ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms for regular &s;inging; or for &s;crupling to receive the Sacrament at the Hands of an un|ordained Deacon, or any Thing el&s;e of the like Kind; that you pretend to bring the&s;e In&s;tan|ces again&s;t us? Mayn't every Body entertain their own Opinions in the&s;e Points; and be treated with Kindne&s;s and Friend&s;hip, having
<PB N="95" REF="004136_0048_1003D8CB354E06D0">
all &s;acred Priviledges allow'd them notwith|&s;tanding, among us? If they will be peace|able with us, we &s;hould be &s;o with them, and &s;uffer them to abound in their own Sence. If they wo'nt impo&s;e upon us their own Humours or Imaginations, neither will we impo&s;e upon them. They may peaceably neglect what they can't comply with, and yet be treated with Chri&s;tian Love and Charity. How then could you &s;ay, that they are excommunicated for the&s;e Things <HI>ip&s;o Facto?</HI> Be plea&s;ed to give one &s;ingle In&s;tance, of any Man that was excommunicated among us for any of the&s;e Things, or for any Thing el&s;e of like Nature. But if you can't, it certainly concerns you to be more careful of publi&s;hing &s;uch Things for true, which can't be proved nor exemplified in one &s;ingle In&s;tance. For my own Part I would admit any Man that I have Rea&s;on to believe a true and &s;incere Chri&s;tian, unto Com|munion in all the Ordinances of Chri&s;t, if he would regularly and peaceably de&s;ire it; not|with&s;tanding any le&s;&s;er Differences in Prin|ciple. And for ought I know this is the Mind of all the Mini&s;ters of our Per&s;wa&s;ion. But is it &s;o in your Church? Are not the Stumb|ling Blocks of your Rites and Ceremonies thrown in our Way? Mu&s;t we not comply with the&s;e to every Punctilio of a Ceremony (tho' never &s;o much again&s;t our Con&s;ciences)
<PB N="96" REF="004136_0049_1003D8D070A12478">
or be rejected, excommunicated, refu&s;ed all Chri&s;tian Priviledges; and in <HI>England</HI> be ren|dred uncapable of any temporal Honours and Dignities, in the State? And can there be &s;o much as a Pretence, that the&s;e are parallel Ca&s;es? That we are as much chargeable with Im|po&s;itions, as the Church of <HI>England.</HI> The Prin|ciples of a Church are be&s;t known by their pub|lick Formulas. Look into ours; look into the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> and the <HI>New-England</HI> Confe&s;&s;ions, and into the Agreement of the <HI>Synod</HI> at <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> &s;earch them throughly, and &s;ee if you can find any thing of this Na|ture; any damning Creeds; or any Canons that excommunicate <HI>ip&s;o Facto,</HI> all that don't approve of our Rites and Ceremonies, that don't approve of the Government of our Chur|ches by an un&s;criptural Hierarchy, or that pretend to groan under any Grievances impo&s;|ed upon them by our Churches. But if there can nothing of this Nature be found. If it ap|pear upon &s;tricte&s;t Search, that the&s;e are the Peculiarities of your own Church, and are monopoli&s;ed to your &s;elves, I hope you will have &s;uch a Regard to your Reputation, as not to entertain us with any Thing more of this Nature.</P>
<P>That an impo&s;ing Power has ever been claimed by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> even from her fir&s;t Deliverance from the <HI>Papal Yoke</HI> and
<PB N="97" REF="004136_0049_1003D8D070A12478">
<HI>Smithfield Fires,</HI> is an inconte&s;table Truth. A Truth awfully evinced by the bloody Per&s;e|cutions begun in Queen <HI>Elizabeth's</HI> Reign; and long continued in the Reigns of her &s;everal Succe&s;&s;ors. A Truth mo&s;t apparent from the xx. Article of the Church; and equally appa|rent form this Doctrine's being mo&s;t openly and &s;olemnly avouched in your Book of <HI>Ca|nons,</HI> that yet remain unrepealed and in their full Force, whereby every one that con&s;cien|ciou&s;ly &s;cruples the lea&s;t Tittle of your Injun|ctions, is excommunicated and deprived of all &s;acred Priviledges in your Church. Nay, the impo&s;ing Power has been &s;o little que&s;|tioned by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that they have even ventured to publi&s;h it with the ho|ly Bible it &s;elf, as a Part of the Contents of it. A flagrant In&s;tance of which we have in the Argument of the cxlix. <HI>P&s;alm;</HI> where we are &s;aid to be <HI>exhorted to prai&s;e God, for the Pow|er which he has given to the Church, to rule the Con&s;ciences of Men.</HI></P>
<P>And this is what has in all Times pa&s;t rai&s;|ed the Wall of Seperation, between the Church of <HI>England</HI> and her nonconforming Brethren; and yet continues the great Article of our Com|plaint.</P>
<P>This is what we cannot but e&s;teem mo&s;t in|con&s;i&s;tent with the Rights of the Chri&s;tian Church; and even with Humanity it &s;elf. &mdash;
<PB N="98" REF="004136_0050_1003B6B0B8015378">
This is not only to make us meer Machines, to receive our religious Sentiments from external Impre&s;&s;ions, without any inward Principles of Conviction or rational Per&s;wa&s;ion; but what we cannot but think a direct Inva&s;ion of Chri&s;t's Regal Power. And while the Church conti|nues the Exerci&s;e of this impo&s;ing Power; and refu&s;es to extend the Terms of Communion to all &s;uch as vi&s;ibly comply with the Nece&s;|&s;ary Terms of Salvation; and will not open the Doors of the Church to all tho&s;e that a Judgment of Charity obliges her to believe are &s;incere Chri&s;tians; there will forever remain Cau&s;e of Complaint again&s;t your Con&s;titution. And I tru&s;t there will ever be a Body of Men, that will &s;tand up in Defence of the <HI>Liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' the&s;e Impo&s;itions are varni&s;h'd o|ver with the &s;pecious Pretences of <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Order:</HI> Yet they have fatally prov'd the un|happy Engines of dividing the Chri&s;tian Church, and de&s;troying that Peace and Charity that are the e&s;&s;ential Characters of the true Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t; &mdash; I cannot but think it would be more agreeable to the Nature and De&s;ign of the Chri&s;tian In&s;titution, to <HI>receive one another as Chri&s;t al&s;o has received us to the Glory of God,</HI> than to go on thus &s;miting our fellow Servants, by impo&s;ing upon their Con&s;ciences, or depriving them of the
<PB N="99" REF="004136_0050_1003B6B0B8015378">
Ordinances of Salvation, upon Accounts con|fe&s;&s;ed to be in them&s;elves incon&s;iderable and of an indifferent Nature.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore but e&s;teem it the peculiar Glory of our Churches, that we open the Arms of our Charity and Communion, to all the vi|&s;ible Members of Chri&s;t; and bear our Te&s;ti|mony again&s;t all Encroachments upon the Rights of human Nature, and the Liberty and Priviledges of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>What Laws of <HI>New-England</HI> you refer to I know not; nor do you give any Account what they be. If there be any Laws that require the Per&s;ecution of tho&s;e that con&s;cienciou&s;ly &s;cruple their Methods of Wor&s;hip, as you in|&s;inuate, p. 51. I have not one Word to &s;ay in their Ju&s;tification. I acknowledge Per&s;ecution to be as bad in them as in you; and to be an unmerciful Violation of the Laws of Nature, wherever it is practiced. But you mu&s;t par|don me, if I can't give a full A&s;&s;ent to your Repre&s;entation of the Ca&s;e; becau&s;e I know there are a Variety of A&s;&s;emblies for publick Wor&s;hip, of very different Principles, in <HI>New-England,</HI> none of whom meet with the lea&s;t Oppo&s;ition from the Government.</P>
<P>I acknowledge that it is no Ju&s;tification of the Principles of any Sect. that they were handed down to them from their Progenitors. But yet it is a great Apo&s;tacy, to renounce the
<PB N="100" REF="004136_0051_1003D78463196D88">
pure In&s;titutions and Wor&s;hip of God, which our Fathers maintained at their Peril, for tho&s;e human In&s;titutions and un&s;criptural Impo&s;i|tions, which were the Cau&s;e of &s;uch dreadful Per&s;ecution to them. If their Cau&s;e was good (as I before proved it to be) then to decline from <HI>the good old Way</HI> of our Fathers would be di&s;plea&s;ing to God, and injurious to our own Souls: And this would be every where true, when Reformations in Religion, that have been procured by our Progenitors, at the Ex|pence of every Thing that is dear to them of a worldly Nature, are given up, and a Declen|&s;ion is made from a pure &s;piritual Wor&s;hip, to &s;uch a Wor&s;hip as is un&s;criptural, without any divine In&s;titution, wounding to the &s;crupulous Con&s;ciences; and de&s;tructive to that <HI>Liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free.</HI> Which (I think) I have proved to be the Ca&s;e with Re|&s;pect to the Rites and Ceremonies in Que&s;tion, with the People of <HI>Newark,</HI> as well as <HI>New-England.</HI> And if you'll prove this to be the Ca&s;e at <HI>Canada,</HI> I will allow, that the Argu|ment concludes for them too, and that your Harrangue is pertinent; but not otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>You were not willing (I &s;ee) to conclude your Book, without giving us &s;ome Intimation of what Manner of Spirit you are of. <Q>Its true (<HI>you tell us</HI> many of tho&s;e who &s;etled <HI>New-England,</HI> came from what they called Per&s;e|cution.</Q>

p. 52. But don't you call it Per&s;e|cution too, as well as they? Was it not a real Per&s;ecution to have Mini&s;ters &s;ilenced, &s;e|que&s;tred and deprived; to have the Laity ex|communicated, plundred and ruined; to have Ears cut off, No&s;es &s;lit, Foreheads branded with hot Irons, unmerciful Fines impo&s;ed; to be barbarou&s;ly and cruelly whipt, and to be &s;hut up in the mo&s;t afflicting and loath&s;ome Dunge|ons; and bani&s;hed to foreign Countries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We &s;ee then, what we might expect from you, if you had the Power in your Hands. If <HI>New-England</HI> were guilty of &s;ome unju&s;tifiable Se|verities towards a mad Sort of <HI>Quakers,</HI> they don't pretend to vindicate it, as you implicit|ly do, the barbarous Cruelties of the High Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>You tell us, that <Q>it's certain, our Fathers did not cro&s;s the <HI>Atlantick</HI> for Pre&s;byteria|ni&s;m, but for Browni&s;m, or Independency.</Q> p. 53. But I an&s;wer, they did not cro&s;s it for either of the&s;e; but to fly from the Per&s;ecu|tions of Epi&s;copacy; and to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ed Priviledge of God's own pure unmixed In&s;ti|tutions. As to <HI>Browni&s;m,</HI> they all di&s;claimed it; and tho' the mo&s;t of them were of Congre|gational Principles; yet there were a con&s;ider|able Number of <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> among them. There was from the Beginning and is yet, a Mixture of both Sorts, who have always lived

together as united Brethren. &mdash; Some of the people of <HI>Newark</HI> have indeed formerly been culpable, for managing a Controver&s;y with their worthy Mini&s;ter, upon the&s;e points: And I hope your putting them in Mind of it, may conduce to their Humillation, if there be any of them yet living. But then, they did not imitate the Di&s;po&s;ition of the people in <HI>New-England,</HI> in this their Oppo&s;ition to that worthy Gentleman, who removed from their Abu&s;es to <HI>New-England,</HI> was there received with greate&s;t Kindne&s;s and Love, advanced to the Rectoral Charge of their <HI>Colledge,</HI> in which Station he lived and dyed, in the highe&s;t Ho|nour and E&s;teem among them all, notwith|&s;tanding his <HI>Pre&s;byterian Principles.</HI> &mdash; In a Word, as both <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> and <HI>Congregatio|nali&s;ts,</HI> were from the Beginning embark'd upon the &s;ame Bottom, &s;o have they yet Rea|&s;on to conclude, notwith&s;tanding their le&s;&s;er trifling Differences in their Sentiments, that they have all the &s;ame common Intere&s;ts to pur&s;ue; &mdash; <HI>What then doth your Arguing re|prove?</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have endeavoured to prove that the Sermon you took Notice of, was <HI>agreeable to the Council of God.</HI> And I think I have prov|ed it from the Word of God. I hope therefore, I may now venture to &s;ay &s;o, without the Ha|zard of &s;uch a &s;evere Reprimand, as you gave
