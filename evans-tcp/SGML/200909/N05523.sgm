<P><HI>IN the Examination of the Ca&s;e, which is publi&s;hed at the De&s;ire of &s;ome Gentle|men that attended the Trial, the Reader will find, that in the Year 1749, Mr.</HI> Va&s;&s;all <HI>&s;eems to have taken a Re&s;olution to be my Ruin; and to accompli&s;h this</HI> vile and wicked End <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to have made it his Practice</HI> for above two Years following, <HI>to &s;ay</HI> in all Companies <HI>&s;uch Things of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as had a direct Tendency to bla&s;t my Character and Reputation, and is de&s;troy my Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, without having</HI> even the Shadow of Truth <HI>to &s;upport what he &s;aid, or</HI> any other <HI>Provocation th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n my</HI> cen&s;uring his Conduct <HI>in delivering to</HI> one Andrew Hall <HI>a promi&s;&s;ary Note of con&s;iderable Value, which be the &s;aid</HI> Va&s;&s;all <HI>ought to have delivered to me,</HI> as plainly appears by the Rule of Court in that Ca&s;e annex'd hereto, and by doing of which I was wrong'd of the &s;ame, <HI>be&s;ides being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed in the Law with the &s;aid</HI> Hall <HI>for above</HI> three Years <HI>on Account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hereof. &mdash; It will al&s;o appear that Mr.</HI> Va&s;&s;all <HI>could have us other Drift i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ummoning the&s;e Evidences which he did, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> to try to fi&s;h out <HI>how much I was, or had been in Debt, and with what Honour I had dealt; how far his End was an&s;wered, or what Effect it could have had in this Ca&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I been four Times as much in Debt as I was, the Reader will judge. Every Gentleman in Bu&s;ine&s;s kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ws, that a Mer|chant of exten&s;ive Trade mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ary be in Debt. The Que&s;tion is not, how much he is in Debt? but, with what Honour does be deal? for the more exten&s;ive his Trade is, and the more he is in Debt, the greater Damage is it to him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his good Name taken away; as is very elligantly &s;et forth in the following Paragraph taken from the</HI> SPECTATOR, <HI>Vol. 3.</HI> N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 118.</P>
<Q><P>The mo&s;t unhappy of all Men, and the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the Malignity or Wan|tonne&s;s of the common Voice, is the Trader. Credit is undone in Whi&s;pers. The Trade&s;man's Wound is received from one who is more private and more cruel than the Ruffian with the Lanthorn and Dagger. The manner of repeating a Man's Name, <HI>As Mr.</HI> Ca&s;h, <HI>Oh! do you leave your Money at his Shop? Why do you know Mr.</HI> Searoom? <HI>He is indeed a general Merchant.</HI> I &s;ay, I have &s;een, from the Iteration of a Man's Name, hiding one Thought of him, and explaining what you hide, by &s;aying &s;omething to his Advantage when you &s;peak, a Merchant hurt in his Credit; and him who every Day he lived, literally added to the Value of his native Country, undone by one who was only a <HI>Burthen and a Blemi&s;h to it.</HI> Since every Body who knows the World is &s;en&s;ible of this great Evil, how careful ought a Man to be in his Language of a Merchant? It may po&s;&s;ibly be in the Power of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Creature</HI> to lay the Ruin of the be&s;t Family in the mo&s;t opulent City; and the more &s;o, the more highly he de&s;erves of his Country; that is to &s;ay, the farther he places his We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> out of his Hands, to draw home that of another Climate.</P>

In this Ca&s;e an ill Word may change Plenty into Want, and by a ra&s;h Sentence a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and generous Fortune may in a few Days be reduced to Beggary. How lit|tle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> imagine, that an idle Phra&s;e to the Disfavour of a Mer|chant, may be as pernicious in the Con&s;equence, as the Forgery of a Deed to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> would be to a Gentleman? Land &s;tands where it did before a Gen|tleman was calumniated, and the State of a great Action is ju&s;t as it was before Calumny was offered to dimini&s;h it, and there is Time, Place and Occa&s;ion, ex|pected to unravel all that is contrived again&s;t tho&s;e Characters; but the Trader who is ready only for probable Demands upon him, can have no Armour again&s;t the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> the <HI>Malici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s,</HI> and the <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">itus,</HI> who are prepared to fill the Cry to his Di&s;honour.

<P>For this Rea&s;on, I thought it an imitable Piece of Humanity of a Gentleman of my Acquaintance, who had great Variety of Affairs, and u&s;ed to talk with Warmth enough again&s;t Gentlemen by whom he thought him&s;elf ill dealt with; that he would never let any thing be urged again&s;t a Merchant (with whom he had any Difference) except in a Court of Ju&s;tice. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, that to &s;peak ill of a Merchant, was to begin his Suit with Judgment and Execution. One cannot, I think, &s;ay more on this Occa&s;ion, than to repeat, That the Merit of the Merchant is above that of all other Subjects; for while he is untouched in his Credit, his Hand|writing is a more portable Coin for the Service of his Fellow-Citizens, and his Word the Gold of <HI>Op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> in the Country wherein he re&s;ides.</P></Q>
