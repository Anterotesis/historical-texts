<P><HI>WHEREFORE the Law was our School-Ma&s;ter to bring us unto CHRIST, that we might be ju&s;tified by Faith.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE chief De&s;ign of the pre&s;ent Di&s;|cour&s;e is to give the true Sen&s;e of this Text; which will go far towards leading us into the Nature of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Religion, and of the Chri&s;tian; and help to remove &s;everal dangerous Mi&s;takes, which Mankind have been apt to run into.&mdash;Now, in Order to under&s;tand any Text of Scripture, we are to con&s;ider the various Circum&s;tances of the Di&s;cour&s;e; &s;uch as, the Character of the Per|&s;ons &s;poken to, the Manner how the Text is intro|duced, and for what Purpo&s;e: That, we, &s;eeing the Occa&s;ion of what is written, and the Scope and De|&s;ign of the in&s;pired Writer, may the more readily and certainly di&s;cern the true Sen&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;age.&mdash; Here, therefore let us enquire into&mdash;the Character of the Per&s;ons St. <HI>Paul</HI> had to deal with&mdash;the Occa|&s;ion and De&s;ign of the&s;e Words, and how they were introduced in the Thread of his Argument&mdash;and the Grounds he &s;aw in the Nature of the <HI>Mo&s;ais</HI> Di&s;pen|&s;ation
<PB N="2" REF="007618_0004_102B87A99A95AA00">for this Ob&s;ervation, That <HI>the Law was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> School-Ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. As to the <HI>Character</HI> of the Per&s;ons St. <HI>Paul</HI> had to deal with.&mdash;They, at lea&s;t the Ring-leaders of them, were, by Birth <HI>Jews,</HI> by Education <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and now lately converted to <HI>Chri&s;tianity;</HI> but yet zea|lous for &s;ome of their old <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> Notions, fond of making <HI>Pro&s;elytes</HI> to their own Scheme, a Scheme, in the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s Opinion, &s;ubver&s;ive of <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE of the Sect of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> before their Conver&s;ion to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> they expected Ju&s;tification <HI>wholly</HI> by the <HI>Deeds of the Law. (Rom.</HI> x. 3.) But now, &s;ince their Conver&s;ion to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> they ex|pected Ju&s;tification by the <HI>Deeds of the Law;</HI> and yet it &s;eems, not <HI>wholly;</HI> for they hoped that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> would <HI>profit them &s;ome,</HI> be of <HI>&s;ome Effect,</HI> and they had <HI>&s;ome Dependence on Grace,</HI> as is implied in the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s Manner of Rea&s;oning in <HI>Gal.</HI> v. 2, 3, 4.&mdash;As to their Notions of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> by which they expected Ju&s;tification, it &s;eems, they con&s;idered it, not at all, as a Di&s;pen&s;ation preparitory to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> &s;uited to &s;hew them their Need of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to lead them to Faith in him by Types and Shadows; but only as a Rule of Life, to which, if they conformed, they &s;hould be &s;aved. And it &s;eems they did not doubt, but that &s;uch a Conformity to it, as they were capable of, would an&s;wer the End: Little con&s;ider|ing, that if they depended upon their Circumci&s;ion, and their others Works for Life, they were obliged to keep the whole Law.&mdash;Ju&s;t as now a Days there are tho&s;e, who ignorantly imagine, that if they en|deavour to do as well as they can, they &s;hall be &s;aved; little thinking, that if they depend upon their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s for Salvation, they ought to yield a perfect Obedience, as they would not finally be di&s;|appointed.</P>
<P>HAD they viewed the <HI>Law of Mo&s;es</HI> as a Di&s;pen&s;a|tion preparatory to <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> they might more rea|dily have &s;oon the Propriety of its being aboli&s;hed, and
<PB N="3" REF="007618_0005_102B87769C535F90">giving Place to the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> but while they con&s;idered it, with all its Rites and Ceremonies, only, as a Rule to which they were to Conform, as a Con|dition of Salvation, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> only making up for their Deficiencies, it was natural to think it of perpetual Obligation; and that not only to them&s;elves, but al&s;o to the <HI>Gentile Converts.</HI> When therefore they ob&s;erved St. <HI>Paul</HI> con&s;tantly preaching <HI>Ju&s;tification by Faith alone without the Deeds of the Law,</HI> and the <HI>Gentile Converts</HI> received and embraced as good <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> without their paying any Regard to the Rites and Ce|remonies of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law, they were chagrined, and &s;et up them&s;elves to oppo&s;e St. <HI>Paul,</HI> affirming <Q>that unle&s;s the <HI>Gentile Converts</HI> were circumci&s;ed and kept the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> they could not be &s;aved.</Q> <HI>Act.</HI> XV. 1, 5.</P>
<P>AND as the <HI>Jews</HI> were, in tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> early Times, the greate&s;t Enemies Chri&s;tianity had, and the mo&s;t bitter Per&s;ecutors, enraged to &s;ee the Rites of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Law neglected; &s;o the&s;e <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> Chri&s;tians, by their Zeal for <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Law, ingratiated them&s;elves very much, in the Favour of the&s;e bitter Enemies of Chri&s;tianity, which made them the more zealous in their Way, that they might not only avoid Per&s;ecu|tion from the unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> but al&s;o have it to glory in, that they had pro&s;elyted &s;o many <HI>Gentiles</HI> to be circumci&s;ed. <HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 12, 13.&mdash;So that they were not only bigoted to their Scheme by their Edu|cation while <HI>Jews,</HI> and attached to it, as it &s;uited their &s;elf-righteous Temper; but al&s;o proud of it, as it freed them from the chief Odium of Chri&s;tianity, and &s;creened them from the Malice of its bittere&s;t Ene|mies.&mdash;And they were in &s;ome Places more than a Match for St. <HI>Paul</HI> with all his extraordinary Gifts. They rai&s;ed &s;uch a Du&s;t at <HI>Antioch,</HI> as that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Bar|nabas</HI> could not &s;ettle the Point; but were obliged to refer it to the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> And they made &s;uch &s;ad Work in the Churches in <HI>Galatia,</HI> that altho' the Converts there, once, could have even <HI>plucked
<PB N="4" REF="007618_0006_102B87AB26F32D18">out their Eyes</HI> and given to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> yet they were now much di&s;affected towards him, and even become his <HI>Enemies.</HI> And the&s;e <HI>Seducers</HI> were in eminent Dan|ger of even overthrowing Chri&s;tianity in all that Country; which at la&s;t obliged St. <HI>Paul</HI> to write this <HI>Epi&s;tle</HI> to the &s;everal Churches in <HI>Galatia.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Now the&s;e were the Men the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> had to deal with; and the Method he took, which was wi&s;ely adapted to let in Light upon, their Minds and tho|roughly convince their Judgments, may be fully &s;een, if we carefully read thro' this Epi&s;tle: But I may now only give you a brief and cur&s;ory View of &s;ome Parts of it, ju&s;t to let you &s;ee his Manner of Addre&s;s, and his Way of Rea&s;oning, and how our Text is in|troduced in the Thread of the <HI>Apo&s;tle's</HI> Argument.&mdash; Which take as follows&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>THIS Epi&s;tle is &s;ent to the Churches of <HI>Galatia,</HI> from <HI>Paul,</HI> an Apo&s;tle, who received his Mi&s;&s;ion not of Men, neither by Men, but immediately from <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> And it is approved by all the Brethren with him, and it comes wi&s;hing you all Ble&s;&s;ings.&mdash;But I am a&s;toni&s;hed and greatly mar|vel, after all the Pains I have taken with you to in&s;truct you into the true Nature of Chri&s;tianity, to &s;ee you &s;o &s;oon drawn away by the&s;e Seducers, to quite another Kind of a Go&s;pel; which indeed is no Go&s;pel: But is a mo&s;t dangerous Scheme.&mdash; The&s;e Seducers, how plau&s;ible &s;oever they appear, ought not to be regarded. Yea, if an Angel from Heaven &s;hould preach any other Go&s;pel, than that I have preached, let him be ACCURSED.&mdash;I &s;peak plainly: For I am no TRIMMER. I do not make it my ultimate End to plea&s;e Man; but mean, in the Uprightne&s;s of my Heart, to be faithful to <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;And I know, I received the Go&s;pel I preached to you by immediate Revelation from God, after, as it was publickly known, I had been exceedingly zealous in the <HI>Phari&s;aical Scheme;</HI> be|ing met with in a very extraordinary Manner, as I
<PB N="5" REF="007618_0007_102B87788DDFE910">was going to <HI>Dama&s;cus:</HI> Ever &s;ince which Time, I have con&s;tantly preached this Go&s;pel; being in|&s;tructed, not even by any of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> but by immediate Revelation.&mdash;And I have con&s;tantly maintained, that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> need not be Circum|ci&s;ed, or keep the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and that no Man is ju&s;tified by the Deeds of the Law, but only by Faith in Chri&s;t. &amp;c. <HI>Chapters</HI> i, and ii.</Q></P>
<P><Q>NOT that I countenance Licentiou&s;ne&s;s. For at the &s;ame Time, that I thro' the Law am dead to all Hopes of Ju&s;tification by the Law, I am but hereby prepared to live with a &s;ingle Eye to the Glory of God: Still having all my Hopes of Ac|ceptance founded on <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash;And indeed I could not con&s;i&s;tently preach up Ju&s;tification by the Law. For if I did, I &s;hould quite overthrow the Go&s;pel. For if Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Ju&s;tification come by the Law, and is to be obtained by our own Works, then there was no Need of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> But he is dead in vain. <HI>Chap.</HI> ix. 17.21.</Q></P>
<P><Q>O FOOLISH, infatuated <HI>Galatians,</HI> may I not ap|peal even to your own Experience? Cannot you recollect that an extraordinary Outpouring of the Spirit, in his miraculous Gifts, has attended the Preaching of the <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> and not of the <HI>Phari&s;aical Scheme,</HI> as in all the Churches, &s;o al&s;o among you? And is not this a &s;ufficient Confirma|tion that they are from God? And were not even you your&s;elves converted to Chri&s;tianity by the&s;e Doctrines attended with a divine Influence? And can you think to perfect your&s;elves now by going off from this &s;piritual, divine Scheme, to one, &s;o mean and low? <HI>Chap.</HI> iii. 1&mdash;5.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AND this indeed, is not any new Doctrine. It is the old Way of Ju&s;tification. Your Father <HI>Abraham</HI> was, two Thou&s;and Years ago, ju&s;tified in this Way. And in this Way all his Children are ju&s;tified. <HI>Ver.</HI> 6&mdash;9.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007618_0008_102B87ACF9A81608">
<Q>BESIDES, you cannot be ju&s;tified by the Law, if you are ever &s;o de&s;irous of it. All your Hopes are built upon ignorant and mi&s;taken Notions. For it is evident that the Law requires &s;inle&s;s Perfection under the &s;evere&s;t Penalty.&mdash;Therefore, &s;o far from being ju&s;tified will you be, if you adhere to this Way of Ju&s;tification, that every Man of you, who does &s;o, will inevitably fall under the Cur&s;e. For it is expre&s;sly written, <HI>cur&s;ed is every one, that con|tinueth not in all Things, which are written in the Bock of the Law, to do them. Ver.</HI> 10.&mdash;And there|fore, &s;ee you remember, that if you are circum|ci&s;ed, and intend to be &s;aved by the Law, that you yield a &s;inle&s;s Perfection. For I <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ure every Man of you, that is circumci&s;ed under that Notion, that he is a Debtor to keep the whole Law, he is bound to yield a perfect Obedience, as he hopes to be &s;aved. For if you go this Way to obtain Ju&s;ti|fication, I a&s;&s;ure you, whatever you think, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will profit you nothing: You &s;hall, however you may flatter your&s;elves, have no Benefit from him: But mu&s;t &s;tand, or fall, as you yield a perfect Obedience, or not. <HI>Chap.</HI> v. 2, 3, 4.
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>An <HI>Arminian</HI> might ju&s;tly query&mdash;Why did not the <HI>Gala|tians</HI> reply to St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and &s;ay&mdash;<Q>Sir, you quite abu&s;e us, we have no Notion of being ju&s;tified by Law in your Sen&s;e. We only depend upon our &s;incere Obedience, and hope and expect to receive &s;ome Benefit from Chri&s;t, and free Grace, as you are &s;en&s;ible. We are in the Main, exactly of your Mind. The Di&s;pute is only about Words. We mean the &s;ame Thing you do. For when you &s;ay, <HI>That a Man is ju&s;tified by Faith without the Deeds of the Law,</HI> You only mean that he is ju&s;tified by <HI>&s;incere Obedience,</HI> and not by <HI>perfect.</HI> And this is ju&s;t the Thing we would. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou your&s;elf know we do not pretend to perfect Obedience. Why then do you bear down &s;o very hard upon us? And even pronounce the Man ACCURSED, that teaches our Scheme? Pretending that it is &s;o e&s;&s;entially different from yours. We think we obey God in being circumci&s;ed, and ob|&s;erving the Rites of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Law. And you think you obey God in not doing the&s;e Things. We own we have been too uncha|ritable in thinking none could be &s;aved, unle&s;s they were cir|cumci&s;ed and kept the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> But, if this is all the Er|ror we are in, you are full as uncharitable towards us, to doom us to De&s;truction for &s;uch a Mi&s;take. Therefore, being now willing to give up this one Point, as for all the Re&s;t, we think your own Words will equally &s;uit us both. <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 3, 4. <HI>Let not him that eateth, de&s;pi&s;e him that eateth not. And let not him that eateth not, judge him that eateth. Who art thou that judge&s;t another Man's Servant?</HI> For as to the Terms of Ju&s;tification, that one Mi&s;take excepted, we are exactly of your Mind.</Q></P>
<P>AND had St. <HI>Paul</HI> been in the &s;ame Scheme with our modern <HI>Arminians,</HI> I do not &s;ee how he could have an&s;wered them: Be|ing obliged to own, as he would have been, that their Notions about Ju&s;tification were right in the Main, although he had con|demned them by whole&s;ale.</P>
<P>BUT if St. <HI>Paul</HI> denied Ju&s;tification, by any Kind of Obedience, &s;hort of ab&s;olute Perfection, how &s;incere &s;oever it might be, as it is plain he did; then there was no Room for the <HI>Galatians</HI> to make this Reply to his Manner of arguing. Nor is there any more Room for the <HI>Arminian</HI> Way of Ju&s;tification by &s;incere Obedience, con|&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s Way of rea&s;oning.&mdash;For if they will be ju&s;tified by their Obedience, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> will profit them nothing, will make up for none of their Defect. They therefore mu&s;t yield a perfect Obedience, or fall under the Cur&s;e; but they do not yield a perfect Obedience. As many, therefore, as are, not only in Head, but in Heart, in the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme, are under the CURSE, according to St. <HI>Paul. Gal.</HI> iii. 26.</P></NOTE></Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007618_0009_102B877A30BAE250">
<Q>AND if to all this you &s;hould object, and &s;ay&mdash; <HI>And what was the Law given for, if we are not to ju&s;ti|fied by it?</HI>&mdash;I reply, it was given to an&s;wer many wi&s;e Ends, as for In&s;tance, to check and re&s;train Vice. <HI>Chap.</HI> iii. 19. But e&s;pecially to be a School-Ma&s;ter, to bring us to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> that we might be ju&s;tified by Faith. For by the Law all Sin was forbid under the highe&s;t Penalty. And &s;o by it we were &s;hut up under Sin and Condemna|tion. and &s;hut up to the Faith. There was no Way to e&s;cape the Cur&s;e, but by Faith. All o|ther Ways were &s;hut up. And thus the Law was to teach us our Need of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and free Grace: And to bring us to look this Way for Ju&s;tification and eternal Life. <HI>Ver.</HI> 22, 23, 24.</Q> And thus we &s;ee the Occa&s;ion of the Words, and how they were introduced in the Thread of the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI>'s Ar|gument.</P>

III. AND now that we may more fully under|&s;tand them, let us turn back to the &s;acred Books of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and take a View of the Law given on <HI>Mount-Sanai,</HI> that we may &s;ee what Foundation there was in that Di&s;pen&s;ation, for this Ob&s;ervation of the in&s;pired <HI>Apo&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>LET us begin then with the xixth <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Ex|odus,</HI> and &s;ee the particular Steps divine Wi&s;dom took to introduce that Di&s;pen&s;ation, after that God had already in general prepared the Way for it, by redeeming the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> by an out-&s;tretched Hand, by Signs and Wonders, and led them through the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI>&mdash;Two Months they had now been in the Wilderne&s;s (miraculou&s;ly &s;up|plied were they with Water out of the flinty Rock, and with Bread from Heaven) when they came to the Mount of God&mdash;and all to teach them, that the God of <HI>Abraham</HI> was the MOST HIGH GOD; and to make them &s;en&s;ible, that they were under the greate&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Obligations to him.</P>
<P>ISRAEL pitched in the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Sinai,</HI> and there they camped before the Mount. And that it might be &s;een whether they would receive his Law, God called unto <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> out of the Mountain, and &s;ent him to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and bid him tell the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI>&mdash;"Ye have &s;een what I did unto the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and how I bare you on Eagle's Wings, and brought you unto my &s;elf. Now therefore if ye will obey my Voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ye &s;hall be a peculiar Trea&s;ure to me above all People: For all the Earth is mine." To which the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> made An&s;wer&mdash;"All that the Lord hath &s;poken will we do."&mdash;"And <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> told the Words of the People unto the Lord."&mdash;And the Lord &s;ent him to &s;anctify the People that Day, and the next, that they might be ready again&s;t the third Day, when he would come down in the Sight of all the People upon Mount <HI>Sinai.</HI>&mdash;"And it came to pa&s;s on the third Day in the Morning, that there were Thunders and Light|nings,
<PB N="9" REF="007618_0011_102B877BF0E10020">and a thick Cloud upon the Mount, and the Voice of the Trumpet exceeding loud: So that all the People that was in the Camp trembled."&mdash;Upon which "<HI>Mo&s;es</HI> brought forth the People out of the Camp to meet with God. And Mount Sinai," to look to,

<P N="1">1. "THAT the Law given on Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> re|quired &s;inle&s;s Perfection of the whole Congregation of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI>"&mdash;If &s;inle&s;s Perfection be defined to be, "a feeling and acting towards intelligent Beings, as being what they are;" this, their Law required. For it required them, "to love God with all their Heart, and obey him in every Thing; and to love their Neighbours as them&s;elves, and to do as they would be done by:" Which would have been to feel and act towards God and their Neighbours, as being ju&s;t what they were.&mdash;Or, if &s;inle&s;s Perfection con&s;i&s;ts in always doing that, "which is right and fit and beau|tiful to be done, all Things con&s;idered:" Still it comes to the &s;ame Thing. To love God with all our Heart, and obey him in every Thing; and to love our Neighbours as our&s;elves, and do as we would be done by; is the Sum of what is to be done by us, "as right and fit and beautiful."&mdash;Or, if &s;inle&s;s Perfection con&s;i&s;ts in a perfect Conformity of Heart
<PB N="12" REF="007618_0014_102B87B21731CA38">and Life to the Will and Law of God:" This was plainly required. For it is e&s;&s;ential to every Law, to require an exact, and entire Conformity to it&s;elf. And it is a plain Contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e, that God did not require them to do <HI>all</HI> that he did require them to do. They were always to obey God, and never to di&s;obey him. And the Law re&s;pected their Hearts and Lives, their Thoughts, Words and Acti|ons; all their inward Tempers, and all their outward Behaviour: And it was never lawful for them to commit the lea&s;t Sin, or to omit the lea&s;t Duty; but, as to all Things written in the Book of the Law, they were to do them.&mdash;And</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS perfect Obedience was the Condition, upon which, the Law promi&s;ed Life."&mdash;"Ye &s;hall keep my Statues and my Judgments, which if a Man do, <HI>he &s;hall live in them.

<P>AND, that this <HI>Life,</HI> thus promi&s;ed in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Law upon Condition of perfect Obedience, implied in it ETERNAL LIFE and Happine&s;s, is evident from the Te&s;timony of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, in <HI>Luke</HI> x. 25&mdash;28. "What &s;hall I do to inherit ETERNAL LIFE?" Said a certain <HI>Jew</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> To whom our Saviour re|plied, turning him back to the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> with the&s;e Que&s;tions, "what is written in the Law? How reade&s;t thou?"&mdash;To which the Man an&s;wered and &s;aid,&mdash;"Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength, and with all thy Mind; and thy Neigh|bour as thy&s;elf."&mdash;This he gives, as the Sum of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Law.&mdash;To which our Saviour replied,&mdash;"Thou ha&s;t an&s;wered right. <HI>This do, and thou &s;halt live."</HI> i. e. Inherit ETERNAL LIFE.&mdash;The &s;ame Reply our Saviour made to another Man, who al&s;o came to him, to know, <HI>what he &s;hould do that he might have
<PB N="13" REF="007618_0015_102B878048ED1090">ETERNAL LIFE:</HI>&mdash;"If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commandments." Said our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <HI>Matt.</HI> xix. 16, 17.&mdash;It is plain, that in both the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, our Saviour means to declare how <HI>Eternal Life</HI> was to be obtained by the Law: And he gives the &s;ame An&s;wer that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had done before. <HI>Which, if a Man do he &s;hall live in them.</HI> So that according to our Saviour's Interpretation of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> ETERNAL LIFE was implied in the <HI>Life</HI> therein pro|mi&s;ed.</P>
<P>THIS al&s;o is plain from the Te&s;timony of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in <HI>Rom.</HI> x. Where oppo&s;ing the Way to Ju&s;tification and <HI>eternal</HI> Life by <HI>the Law,</HI> to that which is by <HI>the Go&s;pel,</HI> and &s;hewing the Difference, he &s;ays, <HI>ver.</HI> 5. "Mo&s;es de&s;cribeth the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the Law, that the Man that doth tho&s;e Things, &s;hall live by them." And then adds, <HI>ver.</HI> 6.

Where he intimates that the Law does not promi&s;e Ju&s;tification to Faith, but to perfect Obedience; plainly taking it for granted, that <HI>the Life,</HI> promi&s;ed in the <HI>Law,</HI> implied ETER|NAL LIFE.&mdash;I have in&s;i&s;ted the longer on this, be|cau&s;e, if the <HI>Life</HI> promi&s;ed in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Law implied <HI>eternal Life;</HI> no doubt, the <HI>Death</HI> threatned, implied <HI>eternal Death:</HI> Which &s;eems to be the Meaning of <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 23. "The Wages," (i. e. according to Law) "of Sin is Death." i. e. Eternal Death and Mi&s;ery: Even as "the Gift of God is <HI>eternal Life</HI> thro' our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t."&mdash;Therefore I may venture to affirm</P>
<P N="3">3. "THAT the CURSE threatned in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Law, again&s;t the Man that broke it in any one Point, im|plied in it, ETERNAL DAMNATION, and that with|out any Abatements made on Account of their in|ability."</P>
<P>How great their Impotency was, whether from their native Corruption, or from their contracted bad
<PB N="14" REF="007618_0016_102B87B3F12CDE00">Habits, I &s;hall not pretend now to determine.

<P>Now that the <HI>Law</HI> did <HI>cur&s;e</HI> every One, who con|tinued not in all Things written in the Book of the Law to do them, is plain from <HI>Deut.</HI> xxvii.&mdash;and that this <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> compri&s;ed the <HI>Sum total</HI> of the Puni&s;h|ment due to Sin, according to the <HI>Law,</HI> there is no Doubt.&mdash;And that ETERNAL DAMNATION was im|plied in the Puni&s;hment threatned in the <HI>Law,</HI> and compri&s;ed in the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> in <HI>Deut.</HI> xxvii.

<P>FOR otherwi&s;e the wicked <HI>Jews,</HI> who died in their Sins, were not expo&s;ed to Hell: But we &s;ee they were expo&s;ed to Hell, from the Repre&s;entation <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> gives in his Parable of the <HI>Rich Man</HI> and <HI>Lazarus.</HI> "The rich Man died and was buried, and in HELL he lift up his Eyes being in Torments." <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 22, 23. &mdash;This Parable was &s;poken to the <HI>Jews,</HI> then under <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Law.&mdash;But they could not have been expo&s;ed to Hell, unle&s;s it were by <HI>their own Law,</HI> for St. <HI>Paul</HI> expre&s;sly affirms, that they &s;hould be judged by that, and by no other: "As many as have &s;inned in the Law, &s;hall be judged by the Law."

<P>ANSWER. God de&s;igned the whole <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation as a SHADOW of &s;piritual Things.&mdash;Their Bondage in <HI>Egypt</HI> was a Shadow of our &s;piritual Bondage&mdash;Their Redemption out of <HI>Egypt</HI> a Shadow of our Redemption by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>&mdash;The Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> with all the <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Honey,</HI> a Shadow of Heaven and its eternal Delights and Joys&mdash;Their being turned out of the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> for their Sins, and <HI>Cur&s;ed</HI> in all their temporal Intere&s;ts, a Shadow of an eternal Bani&s;hment from Heaven, and of the everla&s;ting Mi&s;eries of Hell.&mdash;So that the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Law was, in its <HI>&s;piritual Meaning,</HI> of the &s;ame Import, with the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> that &s;hall be executed at the la&s;t Day; when the Judge &s;hall &s;ay, "Depart from me, ye CURSED, into everla&s;ting Fire." <HI>Matt.</HI> xxv. 41. And accordingly, St. <HI>Paul</HI> under&s;tood it &s;o.&mdash; This is the true Solution of the Difficulty. And it mu&s;t be quite &s;atisfactory to tho&s;e who believe, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation was by God de&s;igned to be a <HI>Shadow</HI> of &s;piritual Things. For this being &s;uppo&s;ed, and taken for granted, as indeed it is every where in the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> might be full as certain what was the <HI>&s;piritual,</HI> as what was the <HI>literal</HI> Sen&s;e.&mdash;Nor was this <HI>&s;piritual Sen&s;e</HI> de&s;igned to be wholly hid from the whole Con|gregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as the learned Dr. <HI>Warburton</HI> &s;eems to imagine; (vid. <HI>div. Leg. Mo&s;.</HI>) but rather, we ought to think, God de&s;igned to give them &s;ome general Idea of the <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> by all tho&s;e <HI>Sha|dows,</HI> which were held forth before their Eyes, (and in which <HI>the Go&s;pel was preached to them: Heb.</HI> iv 2.) becau&s;e otherwi&s;e the&s;e Shadows would have been of no Service to lead them to look to the promi&s;ed <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> who was to come: And &s;o the End for which they were appointed, would have been fru&s;trated. They were, therefore, not de&s;igned to <HI>&s;ecrete;</HI> but to <HI>reveal</HI> &s;piritual Things: Not indeed <HI>clearly;</HI> but yet to give a <HI>Shadow of them:</HI> And &s;uch a <HI>Sha|dow,</HI> as was well &s;uited to lead their Minds to the <HI>Sub&s;tance.</HI> As might be largely &s;hewn.&mdash;Particularly, all the <HI>Cur&s;es</HI> written in their Law again&s;t the Sinner, were de&s;igned and &s;uited, not to <HI>hide</HI> and <HI>&s;ecrete</HI> the <HI>Wrath of God,</HI> but to <HI>reveal</HI> and <HI>realize</HI> it to the Heart. And while the guilty <HI>Jew</HI> died <HI>&s;en&s;ibly</HI> under the <HI>Wrath of God,</HI> and <HI>Cur&s;e of the Law,</HI> he could have a Pro&s;pect of nothing but a mi&s;e|rable Eternity, nor expect any Thing &s;hort of <HI>eternal Damnation.</HI> i. e. To continue forever under the <HI>Wrath of God,</HI> an <HI>accur&s;ed</HI> Creature.&mdash;But whether every Reader &s;hall think <HI>this,</HI> the true Solution of the Difficulty mentioned in the <HI>Objection,</HI> or not; yet this is plain, that by the <HI>Cur&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> means that <HI>eternal Mi&s;ery from which Chri&s;t redeems Sinners:</HI> and by the <HI>Law,</HI> he means <HI>the Law of Mo&s;es,</HI> of which he had been &s;peaking, and out of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e had quoted the Pa&s;&s;age he refers unto, when he &s;ays, <HI>Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the Cur&s;e of the Law.</HI> Read <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 10. and compare it with <HI>Deut.</HI> xxvii. 26. and you may &s;ee, it is as evident as it can be, that he is &s;peaking of the <HI>Cur&s;e of Mo&s;es</HI>'s <HI>Law.</HI> Wherefore Dr. <HI>Doddridge</HI>'s Note on <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 13. is not &s;atis|factory.&mdash; But to conclude, if the <HI>Life</HI> promi&s;ed in the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> implied <HI>Eternal Life;</HI> as it is certain, from our Saviour, that it did: Then, according to the &s;ame Rule of Interpretation, the <HI>Death</HI> threatened mu&s;t imply <HI>eternal Mi&s;ery;</HI> as we &s;ee it did ac|cording to St. <HI>Paul.</HI> And no Doubt that Interpretation of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> mu&s;t be right, which is thus confirmed by two &s;uch <HI>Di|vine Expo&s;itors.</HI></P></NOTE>&mdash;So that, as the Law

<P N="1">1. <Q>THE Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Manner of Rea&s;oning upon it, are incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme of Religion, and do as effectually confute it, as the Scheme of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;aical</HI> Chri&s;|tians of that Age.</Q></P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t fundamental <HI>Maxims</HI> in the <HI>Ar|minian</HI> Scheme, is,&mdash;<Q>That, in the Nature of Things, it is not ju&s;t for God to require more of his Creatures than they can do, and then threaten to puni&s;h them for not doing.</Q>

<P>WELL,&mdash;be it &s;o&mdash;How then will they reconcile their Scheme with the <HI>Law of Mo&s;es?</HI>&mdash;Did not the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> require perfect Obedience? It is plain it did. It is a Fact that cannot be denied. <HI>Arminians Pelagians, Socinians,</HI> that are Men of Learning do not pretend to deny it.&mdash;Well, had the whole Congre|gation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> POWER, in the Sen&s;e <HI>Arminians</HI> u&s;e the Word, to yield perfect Obedience, in Heart and Life, all their Lives long, without ever failing in the lea&s;t Degree, in any one Point, at any one Time? It is plain they had not. Yea, no <HI>Arminian</HI> ever pretended they had.&mdash;Well, when the <HI>Levites</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Cur&s;ed be the Man, that confirmeth not all the Words of this Law, to do them;</HI> were not all the People to &s;ay, <HI>Amen,</HI> and &s;o approve the Law in all its Rigour? This again is plain Fact.&mdash;So that here, the <HI>Armi|nian</HI> has no <HI>metaphy&s;ical Niceties,</HI> (as he loves to call tho&s;e clear Di&s;tinctions, and conclu&s;ive Arguments, which he is not able fairly to get rid of,) to grapple with; but <HI>plain Facts.</HI> Facts acknowledged on all Hands.&mdash;Now <HI>Facts are &s;tubborn Things.</HI>&mdash;Here we &s;ee, God gave a Law, required more than they could do, denounced the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> again&s;t the Man, that failed in the lea&s;t Point; and yet, in expre&s;s Contradiction, the <HI>Arminian</HI> &s;ays, <Q>it is ab&s;olutely unju&s;t for God to require more of his Creatures than they can do, and then threaten to puni&s;h them for not doing.</Q> Wherefore, it is manife&s;t, that the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme is, in <HI>this,</HI> directly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> And therefore, if the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> came from God, their Scheme in this <HI>fundamental Maxim,</HI> and in all that depends upon it, is fal&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS is a <HI>&s;hort</HI> and <HI>ea&s;y</HI> Way to confute the <HI>Ar|minian</HI> Scheme, quite level with the Capacity of com|mon People, who are not &s;o well able to attend to a long Chain of Arguments. And it was de&s;igned by
<PB N="40" REF="007618_0042_102B87CC5F5D9250">a God of infinite Wi&s;dom, who knows how to let in Light upon weak and ignorant Minds, in Effect, for this very Purpo&s;e. For it was de&s;igned to convince Men, that, in Them&s;elves, they are ab&s;olutely lo&s;t and undone.&mdash;And every Thing meets in this Me|thod of confuting the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme, which could be de&s;ired, to give the fulle&s;t Satisfaction to the Minds of Men. For the Argument is not founded upon, here and there, a dark Text of Scripture, of doubtful Signification, and &s;eemingly capable of &s;e|veral different Meanings; but upon the plain Nature of the whole <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation; upon Facts, &s;o evi|dent, as to be acknowledged on all Hands. Nor is there &s;o much as Room left to &s;u&s;pect, that we mi&s;un|der&s;tand the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, and view the Facts in a wrong Light, ina&s;much as St. <HI>Paul</HI> has led the Way before us, and, under divine In&s;piration, has &s;hewn this to be the Nature and De&s;ign of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, viewing the Facts in the &s;ame Light, and arguing from them in the &s;ame Manner, as has been already ob&s;erved. That if we may give Credit to the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or to the great <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> or to a Method of Rea&s;oning full of Light and Demon&s;tration, or to all together, we may &s;it down here fully &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>AND as the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the Go&s;pel of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> are in a perfect Harmony; and, as on this Account, what is incon&s;i&s;tent with one, mu&s;t be with the other: So it is manife&s;t from the <HI>Apo&s;tle's</HI> Man|ner of rea&s;oning, that the afore&s;aid <HI>Arminian</HI> Maxim is quite incon&s;i&s;tent with the Go&s;pel. For, according to that Maxim, Mankind have power to do that, which would entitle them to the Favour of God, if <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> had never died. But, &s;ays St. <HI>Paul, if there had been a Law, which could have given Life, verily Righteou&s;ne&s;s had come by the Law. And if Righteou&s;ne&s;s come by the Law, then Chri&s;t is Dead in vain. Gal.</HI> ii. 21. and <HI>Chap.</HI> iii. 21.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>IF the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme is incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Law,</HI> and with the <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> it will unavoidably follow, that the <HI>religious Exer|ci&s;es,</HI> of tho&s;e who are <HI>Armenians</HI> at Heart, are not in Conformity to <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> but of a contrary Nature; even, their <HI>Love to God,</HI> their <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t,</HI> their <HI>Repeniance,</HI> their <HI>&s;incere Obedience,</HI> and <HI>every other Branch</HI> of their <HI>Religion.</HI> The whole Spirit and Frame of their Minds is contrary to Law, and to Go&s;pel, ju&s;t as their Scheme of Religion is.

<P N="2">2. FROM what has been &s;aid, we may learn, "That, altho', we are ju&s;tified <HI>by Faith;</HI> yet we are
<PB N="50" REF="007618_0052_102B87D6B92BC9B8">not ju&s;tified <HI>for Faith."</HI> That is, our faith, con&s;idered, as Something <HI>holy, virtuous</HI> and <HI>good</HI> in us, is not that which recommends us to God, in Whole, or in Part. Nor has it, viewed in this Point of Light, <HI>any Hand in our Ju&s;tification.</HI>&mdash;For</P>
<P>THE true Believer, con&s;idered as in him&s;elf, with|out any Relation to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> does, in &s;trict Ju&s;tice, de&s;erve Damnation, after he believes, as much as he did before. The Act of Faith makes no Amends for his pa&s;t Sins, none at all. The Account &s;tands ju&s;t as it did. Only, as he falls &s;hort of &s;inle&s;s Per|fection every Moment; &s;o every Moment he merits Damnation afre&s;h; according to Law: A Law <HI>holy, ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>good.</HI>&mdash;And indeed, it mu&s;t in Rea&s;on be &s;o. For if we &s;hould perfectly devote Our&s;elves to God in Heart and Life for the Time to come; we &s;hould but give God his ju&s;t Due: For we are His: wholly his. But doing our Duty for the Future, cannot make up for pa&s;t Neglects; any more than our paying the Debts we may contract for the Time to come, will &s;a|tisfy for Debts contracted in Time pa&s;t.&mdash;Be&s;ides, our Sins are infinite Evils: But our Virtues are of finite Worth: But Finite put in Ballance to Infinite is No|thing. For when it is &s;ub&s;tracted, the Remainder is &s;till infinite. Therefore only the mere defects, at|tending our be&s;t Services, our highe&s;t Exerci&s;es of Grace, in this imperfect State, merit eternal Damna|tion: Nor does all the Grace and Goodne&s;s in us make the lea&s;t Amends.&mdash;So that the Believer, in his pure&s;t and highe&s;t Act of Faith, con&s;idered as in him&s;elf, without any Relation to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> merits eternal Dam|nation; in&s;tead of Ju&s;tification to eternal Life.</P>
<P>OR, if we leave <HI>Speculation,</HI> and come to <HI>Experience;</HI> &s;till the Point before us appears to be true. "For the Believer feels that Hell is his proper Due, that very Moment he exerci&s;es Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI>"&mdash;For why el&s;e does he apply to the Atonement of <HI>Chri&s;t?</HI> For if he does not de&s;erve to go to Hell, he does not need the Sacrifice of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to &s;ave him from Hell.
<PB N="51" REF="007618_0053_102B87F61D236190">His looking to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by Faith, to be &s;aved from Hell &s;uppo&s;es, he feels Hell to be his proper Due. Elfe, 'tis a mere Mockery.</P>
<P>BUT it is plain from <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and from St. <HI>Paul,</HI> "That no Goodne&s;s &s;hort of &s;inle&s;s Perfection can entitle us to the Favour of God." <HI>Faith,</HI> as it is our Virtue, cannot do it, any more than <HI>Repentance,</HI> or <HI>&s;incere Obedience.</HI> For nothing &s;hort of &s;inle&s;s Perfection can do it.

But, as there was Nothing of the Nature of true Virtue, in the Duties of the &s;elf-righteous <HI>Galatians;</HI> &s;o there is Nothing of the Nature of true Faith, in the Faith of the&s;e &s;elf-righteous Believers: It being as incon&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> for a Man to make a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his Faith; as it is to make a Righteou&s;ne&s;s of any Thing el&s;e.</P>

<P N="4">4. WHAT has been &s;aid, may &s;erve to determine the&s;e following Things, concerning <HI>the Nature of ju&s;|tifying Faith.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="007618_0064_102B87E1F3CD7980">
(1.) IN <HI>General.</HI> It implies an hearty Approbation of the Law, and an hearty Acquie&s;cence in the Go&s;|pel; as being &s;uited to honour God, and di&s;coun|tenance Sin:&mdash;And therefore more <HI>particularly,</HI></P>
<P>(2.) IT implies, a Conviction, and &s;ome realizing Sen&s;e, of the infinite Greatne&s;s and Glory of God; as al&s;o a &s;upreme Love to God, and Regard to his Honour. For otherwi&s;e, we can never approve the Law, from the Heart; nor will it ever appear beau|tiful, or agreeable, that God's Honour is &s;o much con&s;ulted and &s;et by, both in the Law and Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>(3.) IT implies <HI>Regeneration.</HI> Or, that a new, &s;piritual, divine Nature, Ta&s;te and Reli&s;h, is com|municated to us from God. For, there is no Princi|ple in unrenewed Nature, from which, a Man may have &s;uch a &s;upreme Regard to God and his Honour, as from the Heart to approve the Law, in requiring &s;inle&s;s Perfection on Pain of eternal Damnation. The Law never appeared Glorious to an unregenerate Heart. But every unregenerate Heart is at Enmity again&s;t it. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 7.</P>
<P>(4.) IT implies a Conviction, and &s;ome realizing Sen&s;e, of the infinite Evil of Sin, as it is again&s;t a God or infinite Glory. For otherwi&s;e it cannot appear as an agreeable, amiable Thing in God to puni&s;h it with eternal Damnation: And &s;o the Law cannot be real|ly approved of and liked.</P>
<P>(5.) IT implies <HI>true Repentance.</HI> In that, we are thus heartily turned again&s;t Sin, to God, to be on his Side, to approve and ju&s;tify his Law, and &s;tand for his Honour. For now the <HI>Rebel</HI> is become, and has the Heart of a <HI>loyal Subject.</HI>&mdash;And &s;o,</P>
<P>(6.) IT implies a Principle of <HI>new Obedience.</HI>&mdash; Yea,</P>
<P>(7.) IT implies the Seeds of every moral Virtue, and every chri&s;tian Grace. For, they are compri&s;ed in a hearty Approbation of the Law, and Acqui|e&s;cence in the Go&s;pel.&mdash;And &s;o,</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="007618_0065_102B8801A92562E0">
(8.) IT implies, virtually, a Preparedne&s;s of Heart, to deny Our&s;elves, take up our Cro&s;s, and follow <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and be true to him at all Adventures.&mdash;A Character ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to every true Chri&s;tian. <HI>Luke</HI> xiv. 25&mdash;33.&mdash;And &s;o beyond all Di&s;pute,</P>
<P>(9.) Ju&s;tifying Faith is an <HI>HOLY ACT.</HI>&mdash;And yet.</P>
<P>(10.) IT implies, that we have no Dependence, no, not the lea&s;t, on any Goodne&s;s, of any Kind, which is inherent in us, to recommend us to God's Favour and Acceptance.&mdash;For,</P>
<P>(11.) IT implies, that we &s;ee and feel, that eter|nal Damnation is, at that Moment, our proper Due, according to Law and Rea&s;on, according to &s;trict and impartial Ju&s;tice.&mdash;Yea,</P>
<P>(12.) IT implies, that we are &s;o far from a Di&s;|po&s;ition to think hard of God, and complain of his Law, as too &s;evere; that on the Contrary, we are di&s;po&s;ed to think well of God, and to think the Law to be ju&s;t what it &s;hould be, quite right, altogether right, ju&s;t and fair.&mdash;Yea,</P>
<P>(13.) IT implies, that the Law, altho' a Mini|&s;tration of Death, appears to be <HI>glorious.</HI> For, other|wi&s;e, it cannot appear fit and beautiful, that the Ho|nour of it &s;hould be &s;ecured, by the Blood of the SON OF GOD. And yet, unle&s;s this does appear fit and Beautiful, the Go&s;pel-Way of Life cannot be heartily acquie&s;ced in.</P>
<P>(14.) AND if the Law, altho' a Mini&s;tration of Death, appears to be glorious, as it is &s;uited to ho|nour God and di&s;countenance Sin; the Go&s;pel will appear much more exceedingly glorious: as being wi&s;ely calculated, not only to an&s;wer the&s;e Ends, to even better Advantage than the Law; but al&s;o to humble and &s;ave the Sinner, and glorify Grace.&mdash; And therefore, in the Exerci&s;e of Faith, the Go&s;pel-Way of Life by free Grace thro' <HI>Je&s;us Christ,</HI> will be admired, loved, e&s;teemed, rejoiced in, as being full of the manifold Wi&s;dom of God; while we behold,
<PB N="64" REF="007618_0066_102B87E46DAAE718">how Satan is di&s;appointed, God exalted, the Law honoured, God's Authority e&s;tabli&s;hed, Sin puni&s;hed, the Sinner humbled and &s;aved, and Grace glorified, all at once.</P>
<P>(15.) Ju&s;tifying Faith, the&s;e Views and Tempers, being thus &s;uppo&s;ed and implied, con&s;i&s;ts more e&s;pe|cially in a cordial Compliance with the Go&s;pel-Way of Life, by <HI>tru&s;ting in</HI> and <HI>entirely depending upon Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI>&mdash;that <HI>Lamb of God,</HI> typically <HI>&s;lain</HI> in daily Sacrifices <HI>from the Foundation of the World;</HI> who, in the Fulne&s;s of Time, <HI>bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree&mdash;died, the Ju&s;t for the Unju&s;t</HI>&mdash;being <HI>&s;et forth,</HI> as the Bullock of old, <HI>to be a Propitiation for Sin, that God might be ju&s;t</HI>&mdash;and who is now <HI>a&s;cended into Hea|ven, to appear,</HI> as our <HI>great High-Prie&s;t, in the Pre&s;ence of God</HI>&mdash;and is <HI>able to &s;ave to the Uttermo&s;t, all that come to God by him.</HI>&mdash;So the pious <HI>Jew,</HI> with an hum|ble and broken Heart, laid his Hands on the Head of the Bullock, or the Goat, which he had pre|&s;ented before the Lord, to die in his Room. The con&s;ecrated Animal was &s;lain, his <HI>Blood &s;prinkled,</HI> his Carca&s;s burnt, and &s;o <HI>Atonement</HI> was made. <HI>Without &s;hedding of Blood, there was no Remi&s;&s;ion.</HI> Even &s;o now, we are ju&s;tified by FAITH IN CHRIST'S BLOOD. i. e. by an entire Tru&s;t, Dependence, Reliance, on the Atonement, Merits, and Mediation of Chri&s;t, for Pardon and Acceptance in the Sight of God, and for eternal Life.&mdash;This FAITH IN CHRIST'S BLOOD&mdash; is St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Definition of ju&s;tifying Faith.</HI> in <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 25.&mdash;And</P>
<P>(16.) It implies <HI>a firm Belief of the Truth of the Go&s;pel.</HI> For, otherwi&s;e, a Sinner, &s;o wide awake, would not dare, to venture his Soul and eternal Con|cerns, thus wholly and entirely, upon it, without any other Dependence.&mdash;And la&s;tly,</P>
<P>(17.) IT implies <HI>a &s;upreme Value for the Favour of God, above all the World.</HI> As this will naturally ari&s;e from a Sen&s;e of his &s;upreme Dignity, Greatne&s;s and Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="007618_0067_102B880652B9CAF0">
THESE Things are all &s;o ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, and &s;o evidently true, from what has been alrea|dy &s;aid, that they need neither farther Illu&s;tration, nor farther Proof.</P>
<P>AND thus, from the Nature of the Law, and of the Go&s;pel,&mdash;from the very Frame and Con&s;titution of the&s;e two Di&s;pen&s;ations, we learn the Nature of the <HI>preparatory Work,</HI> and the Nature of <HI>Saving Faith.</HI>&mdash; And nothing can be more &s;atisfactory than to &s;ee the&s;e two Things, which lay the Foundation for all experimental Religion, i. e. for all <HI>real Religion,</HI> thus growing up, as it were, out of the <HI>whole Bible,</HI> not re&s;ulting from, here, and there, a detached Sentence; but the natural and nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of both Di&s;pen&s;ations, jointly viewed. And this <HI>joint View</HI> &s;et in a divine Light, by the great <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> before our Eyes.&mdash;And thus, the Religion of the Heart an&s;wers exactly to the <HI>Bible;</HI> as Face an&s;wers to Face in a Gla&s;s. As it is written, <HI>we all beholding, as in a Gla&s;s, the Glory of the Lord, are chang|ed into the &s;ame Image.</HI>

<P>AND from the&s;e Things, it is evident, that ju&s;tify|ing Faith is entirely of a different Nature, from a|ny Thing, an unregenerate Man experiences; who has neither the&s;e Views, nor the&s;e Tempers, which are implied in it, and properly belong to its E&s;&s;ence, And accordingly, we find, that he, who faith, <HI>He that believeth not, &s;hall be damned:</HI>

<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iii. 3.</NOTE>&mdash;And particularly</P>
<P>WE may now, in the Light of all the&s;e Truths, &s;ee, as in the Light of Noon-Day, that for a Man, merely, <HI>to believe that his Sins are pardoned,</HI> and <HI>that God loves him,</HI> has in it nothing of the Nature of <HI>ju&s;|tifying Faith;</HI> but is altogether a different Thing.</P>
<P>(1.) JUSTIFYING Faith is a <HI>Grace,</HI> it is an <HI>holy Act.</HI> But there is nothing of the Nature of Holine&s;s, mere|ly, in believing my Sins are forgiven. Yea, many a gracele&s;s Sinner believes &s;o.</P>
<P>(2.) JUSTIFYING Faith is a <HI>&s;aving Grace.</HI> But Sal|vation is no where promi&s;ed to a Man's firmly believ|ing his Sins are forgiven.</P>
<P>(3.) JUSTIFYING Faith is <HI>wrought,</HI> and <HI>can be wrought</HI> in the Heart by <HI>none</HI> but the <HI>Spirit of God.</HI> But this Belief may be the Effect of a Man's own Pre&s;umption, or of the Devil's Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>(4.) JUSTIFYING Faith implies all the Seeds of Holine&s;s in it, and &s;o naturally lays a Foundation for a <HI>holy Life.</HI> But this Belief, as there is no Ho|line&s;s in it; &s;o it may naturally lay a Foundation for a <HI>wicked Life:</HI> As it tends to embolden a gracele&s;s Heart in Sin.</P>
<P>(5.) JUSTIFYING Faith implies <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and cannot exi&s;t without it. But this Belief <HI>may be</HI> with|out it. There is no <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of Regeneration in Order to its Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>(6.) JUSTIFYING Faith implies <HI>a thorough Convic|tion of Sin.</HI> But a thorough Convicton of Sin would be a Hindrance to this Faith. If They &s;aw how bad they were, they would not be &s;o apt to believe their Sins forgiven. Yea, thorough Conviction would ef|fectually prevent this Belief, and keep them from this Delu&s;ion, and &s;hew them their Need of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> indeed. Sudden Terrors, without any deep Conviction, are Preparation enough for this Belief. Yea, the <HI>Mora|vians,</HI> who think this Belief true Faith, are again&s;t
<PB N="67" REF="007618_0069_102B8808788E4198">any Convictions, or Terrors, as doing more Hurt than Good.</P>
<P>(7.) JUSTIFYING Faith &s;uppo&s;es, that eternal Damnation is &s;een to be ju&s;tly due: Nor can there be an Act of Faith without it. But deluded Sinners may be &s;trong in this Belief, when quite &s;ecure in Sin, and at the greate&s;t Remove from a Sen&s;e of their De&s;ert of Damnation.</P>
<P>(8.) JUSTIFYING Faith &s;uppo&s;es, that the Law is approved of, and loved. But this Belief may be in an <HI>Antinomian</HI> Heart, that hates the Law.</P>
<P>(9.) JUSTIFYING Faith &s;uppo&s;es the Way of Sal|vation, by free Grace thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is rightly under&s;tood; as it re&s;ults herefrom. But a right Under&s;tanding of the Go&s;pel-Way of Life is not needful to this Belief; as it does not take its Ri&s;e from the Go&s;pel, but from a new Revelation. Yea, a clear In&s;ight into the Go&s;pel-Way of Life, would do more Hurt than Good; as it would tend to convince them of their Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>(10.) JUSTIFYING Faith &s;uppo&s;es, that we believe the Go&s;pel to be true. But that Belief a Heretick may have. Yea, a profe&s;&s;ed Infidel may have it: A <HI>Turk,</HI> or a <HI>Jew</HI> may as firmly believe that his Sins are forgiven, as any <HI>Chri&s;tian.</HI> And doubtle&s;s &s;ome of them do.</P>
<P>(11.) JUSTIFYING Faith &s;uppo&s;es, that the Go&s;|pel is heartily approved of and loved. But this Be|lief is con&s;i&s;tent with an habitual Enmity to the Go&s;|pel, as well as the Law.</P>
<P>(12.) JUSTIFYING Faith hath for its Object, <HI>Je&s;us Christ.</HI> But this Belief has for its Object, no Being; but only a &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Fact.</HI> viz. <HI>That my Sins are forgiven.</HI></P>
<P>(13.) JUSTIFYING Faith, is that, by which, we are ju&s;tified. But this Belief &s;uppo&s;es the Man <HI>was ju&s;tified,</HI> that his Sins <HI>were actually pardoned</HI> before he believed.&mdash;Therefore,</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="007618_0070_102B87E87584CA58">
(14.) As ju&s;tifying Faith is founded only on Truth; &s;o this Belief is founded only on Fal&s;hood.&mdash; And</P>
<P>(15.) As ju&s;tifying Faith is founded only on Truths revealed in the written Word; &s;o this Belief is only on a &s;uppo&s;ed Fact, no where revealed in the written Word. Yea, contrary to the written Word, which teaches, that before Faith our Sins are <HI>not pardoned:</HI> But <HI>the Wrath of God abideth on us.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iii. 18, 36.</NOTE></P>
<P>(16.) JUSTIFYING Faith is wrought by the Spirit of God, <HI>enlightening</HI> our Minds, &s;piritually to under|&s;tand the Truths of the Go&s;pel <HI>already</HI> revealed in the written Word. But this Belief is begotten by an <HI>immediate Revelation,</HI> of a Fact <HI>never</HI> revealed before.&mdash;Yea, of a Fact not true.</P>
<P>(17.) JUSTIFYING Faith attaches the Heart to that whole Sy&s;tem of Truths revealed in the Go&s;pel. But this Belief leaves the Heart open to Error, and inclines it to <HI>Antinomiani&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>(18.) IT is every Sinner's Duty, that hears the Go&s;pel, to believe on <HI>Christ</HI> with a ju&s;tifying Faith, But it is not every Sinner's Duty to believe his Sins are forgiven.</P>
<P>(19.) AN Aver&s;ion to the Exerci&s;e of true Faith in <HI>Christ,</HI> is a Sin in all Ca&s;es. But a Backwardne&s;s to believe his Sins are forgiven, is no Sin, in one, who is unpard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed.</P>
<P>(20.) JUSTIFYING Faith, the &s;tronger it is, &s;o much the better, always. But this Belief, the &s;trong|er it is, in a &s;elf-deceived Hypocrite, &s;o much the wor&s;e.</P>
<P>(21.) JUSTIFYING Faith works by Love to God, as glorious and amiable in him&s;elf. But this Belief works only by Self-Love. As the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> at the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> were, from Self-Love, filled with Joy, in a Sen&s;e of their Deliverance, without any true Love to God in their Hearts; &s;o a Man may be filled with Joy, in a firm Belief that his Sins are forgiven;

<P>(22.) THE true Believer naturally makes Holine&s;s of Heart and Life his Evidence of a good E&s;tate, as this is the natural Fruit of true Faith. But this Be|lief naturally leads Men to make, what they call, the immediate Witne&s;s of the Spirit, their only fun|damental Evidence; as all their Faith, and all their Religion, ari&s;es from it, and is entirely dependent on it: And di&s;po&s;es them to think Sanctification, a very dark, un&s;teady, uncertain Evidence; their own religious Frames being &s;uch.</P>
<P>(23.) THE fir&s;t and fundamental Article of a true Believer's Creed, and that on which all his Religion and Hopes are built, is, that the Scriptures of the Old and New-Te&s;tament are the Word of God.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 20.</NOTE> But the fir&s;t and fundamental Article of the other Sort, and that on which all their Religion and Hopes are built, is, that the immediate Di&s;covery they have had of the Love of God, and that their Sins are pardoned, is from God.&mdash;Shake them here, and you Shake their very Foundation.&mdash;De&s;troy this Belief, and you de&s;troy all their Religon and all their Hopes, and leave them quite uncertain in every Thing.</P>
<P>(24.) IN ju&s;tifying Faith the Believer is married to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> becomes One with him; and &s;o is intere&s;t|ed in all his Benefits. But in this Belief, They are per&s;uaded, that the Benefits of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> are Theirs, with|out being ever married to Him.&mdash;To render this perfectly familiar to the weake&s;t Capacity, let me add, &mdash;That the Church, in <HI>Scripture,</HI> is called, <HI>the Bride, the Lamb's Wife.</HI> And being thus united to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> is con&s;idered, as being <HI>IN CHRIST,</HI> and &s;o intere&s;ted in all his Benefits.&mdash;Now there ari&s;es this <HI>Que&s;tion&mdash; What is the Nature of that Faith, whereby the Soul is thus united to Chri&s;t?</HI>&mdash;When a Woman is married to a Man, there is, (1.) the Tran&s;action it&s;elf, in and
<PB N="70" REF="007618_0072_102B87EAB2A20940">by which, they are married. (2.) A Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the Tran&s;action, at that Time. (3.) A Remembrance of it afterwards. (4.) Duties and Privileges flowing from it. So it is in true Faith.&mdash;But what if a Woman &s;hould take it in her Head, without ever be|ing married, to believe, (1.) &s;uch a Man is my Hus|band. (2.) He has paid all my Debts and given me all his E&s;tate.&mdash;<HI>Objection.</HI> No, but <HI>you are not married to him.&mdash;An&s;wer.</HI> Yes, I am. For Marriage con&s;i&s;ts in believing he is my Hu&s;band, and has paid all my Debts.&mdash;Might it not in this Ca&s;e be affirmed?&mdash; <HI>Believing I am married, is not the whole E&s;&s;ence of the Marriage-Covenant, nor any Part of it.</HI>&mdash;So it is equally plain and certain, that&mdash;<HI>believing that Chri&s;t is mine, and that my Sins are pardoned, is not the whole E&s;&s;ence of ju&s;tifying Faith, nor any Part of it.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Altho' it appears, &s;o clear a Ca&s;e, that ju&s;tifying Faith, and a <HI>mere Belief that my Sins are pardoned,</HI> are two di&s;tinct, different Things, in their whole Nature and Effects; &s;o that, it &s;eems &s;trange, how they &s;hould be taken for One and the &s;ame Thing, unle&s;s where Men are bia&s;&s;ed by their own corrupt Experiences: Yet, &s;till I have Charity for &s;ome <HI>Divines,</HI> who &s;eem to think, that ju&s;tifying Faith con&s;i&s;ts in &s;uch a Belief, hoping they have a <HI>better Faith</HI> in their <HI>Hearts,</HI> than <HI>that,</HI> which they de&s;cribe in their <HI>Books,</HI>&mdash;But their being good Men, does not make this Notion of Faith, ever the better; but on the Contrary, the Dan|ger of its doing Mi&s;chief in the World, is greatly increa&s;ed, when it is e&s;pou&s;ed and recommended by Men of great Names. And, therefore, there is the greater Rea&s;on, and the more Need, &s;o particularly, to point out its Difference from <HI>true Faith.</HI></NOTE> To proceed</P>
<P N="5">5. FROM what has been &s;aid, the following <HI>Ca&s;e of Con&s;cience</HI> may be ea&s;ily and &s;afely re&s;olved.&mdash;viz.&mdash;<Q>A Man is greatly at a Lo&s;s about the State of his Soul. He has been awakened, and has been com|forted, and has frequently had &s;omething like Communion with God. He makes Con&s;cience of all his Ways. And yet, for &s;everal Rea&s;ons, is at a great Lo&s;s, whether, what he has experi|enced, be a <HI>common,</HI> or <HI>&s;aving Work of the Spirit.</HI>&mdash; He opens his Ca&s;e to his chri&s;tian Friends; they are afraid to &s;peak comfortably, le&s;t it &s;hould &s;ettle
<PB N="71" REF="007618_0073_102B880CC3B003F8">him down on a fal&s;e Foundation, if all &s;till be wrong. But they dare by no Means &s;peak di&s;|couraging; becau&s;e, according to his Account, his Ca&s;e is hopeful, altho' not clear. So they know not what to &s;ay.&mdash;Now what is the be&s;t Advice that can be given to a Man in &s;uch a Ca&s;e?</Q></P>
<P>TELL him, that altho' he is at a <HI>Lo&s;s,</HI> about his State; yet the&s;e <HI>three</HI> Things he may be <HI>certain</HI> of. They are true, and may be depended upon. viz. He is a Sinner&mdash;the Go&s;pel is true&mdash;and it is his Duty to comply with it.&mdash;Thus tenderly addre&s;s him.</P>
<P><Q>Altho' you are Con&s;cientious in all your Ways, yet you know, you have been, and &s;till are a Sinner. Your Heart is not what it ought to be. Your Temper towards God, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and divine Things is not as it &s;hould be. Nor do you take that Pains in the U&s;e of Means, in Prayer, Meditation, keeping the Heart, &amp;c. as you might.&mdash;You are to blame.&mdash;You are wholly to blame.&mdash;God is righteous in his pre&s;ent Dealings with you.&mdash;Yea, you de&s;erve infinitely wor&s;e than all this: Even, to be &s;ent immediately to Hell.&mdash; Wherefore, &s;ee it; own it; come down, and lie in the Du&s;t at the Foot of God. And learn habi|tually to under&s;tand, realize and approve of God's Law, as holy, ju&s;t and good.</Q></P>
<P><Q>AND, as it is true, that you are a Sinner, and de&s;erve Hell; &s;o it is equally true, that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has died for Sinners, and God is ready, thro' him, to be reconciled to all that believe.&mdash;And the Truth of the&s;e glad Tidings may be depended upon. And you cannot rea&s;onably de&s;ire, that God &s;hould be reconciled to you, in any other Way than this, which is &s;o perfectly adapted and &s;uited to ho|nour God, di&s;countenance Sin, humble the Sinner and glorify Grace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now whether you was ever &s;avingly converted or not; yet it is equally your Duty, in a Sen&s;e, that Hell is your proper Due, and that you are
<PB N="72" REF="007618_0074_102B87EC441D15D8">ab&s;olutely helple&s;s and undone in Your&s;elf, and in a firm Belief of the Truth of the Go&s;pel, to apply to the great Atonement of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to look to the free Grace of God thro' him, for Mercy to pardon, and Grace to help according to all your Needs.&mdash;And thro' <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> to devote and give up Your&s;elf to God, to love him, live to him, and to be for ever His.&mdash;And in this Way your State may be cleared up, and your Doubts removed.</Q></P>
<P><HI>OBJECTION. But is there not Danger, that all This may Jettle him down on a fal&s;e Hope; if as yet be never was converted?</HI></P>
<P><HI>ANSWER.</HI> (1.) IF he never was converted, then he never yet heartily approved of the Law, or really believed the Go&s;pel, or ever heartily complied with it. Therefore, putting him upon the&s;e Things, will tend to convince him, that he never did. For it will tend to &s;how him, that it is <HI>not in his Heart to do it.</HI> And con&s;equently, that there is <HI>no Seed of Grace</HI> there: But that he is quite <HI>dead in Sin.</HI> And that, therefore, unle&s;s <HI>he is born again, he &s;hall never &s;ee the Kingdom of God.</HI>&mdash;I &s;ay, it will tend to con|vince him of all this; and if, after all, he remains unconvinced, the Fault will be his own.</P>
<P>(2.) IF he has been &s;avingly converted, then this Method of dealing with him, will be like pointing out the Way to One lo&s;t in a Wilderne&s;s.&mdash;He likes the Directions&mdash;he takes them&mdash;he ha&s;tens towards the Road&mdash;he finds it&mdash;he remembers it&mdash;he rejoices &mdash;and takes better Heed to keep the right Path thro' the Re&s;t of his Journey. For the true Convert, altho' under great Back&s;lidings, has &s;till the <HI>Root</HI> of the Matter in him. Has it in his Heart to ju&s;tify the Law, to be plea&s;ed with the Go&s;pel-Way of Life, and to look to free Grace through <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> for all Things.&mdash;Like <HI>Jonah</HI> in the <HI>Belly of Hell,</HI> when the <HI>Weeds wrapt about his Head,</HI> and he was ready to &s;ay, that he was <HI>ca&s;t out of God's Sight;</HI> and his Soul <HI>fainted within him.</HI> Then he <HI>remembred God,</HI> and <HI>looked
<PB N="73" REF="007618_0075_102B880E5BB04D78">again towards his holy Temple,</HI> where God dwelt in the Cloud of Glory over the Mercy-Seat, under which the Law was laid up in the Ark, in the mo&s;t holy Place of the HOLY of HOLIES, into which the High-Prie&s;t entered once a Year with the Blood of Atonement.&mdash;He looked <HI>hither</HI>&mdash;his former Ideas of God revived: He <HI>remembered</HI> the Lord: And a Sen&s;e of God, as <HI>there</HI> manife&s;ted, encouraged him to pray. &mdash;He prayed, and God heard him, and delivered him out of all his Di&s;tre&s;&s;es.&mdash;And many a poor broken hearted Back&s;lider has done in like Manner, and found it <HI>good to draw near to the Lord.</HI> And thus the Truth clearly held forth to the Con&s;cience, as it tends to kill the fal&s;e Hopes of a &s;elf-deceived Hy|pocrite; &s;o it tends to awaken and encourage the true Saint to &s;uch Exerci&s;es of Grace, as may be plainly di&s;cernible, and lay a Foundation for a full A&s;&s;u|rance. To conclude</P>
<P N="6">6. FROM what has been &s;aid, "the true State of the Chri&s;tle&s;s Sinner appears in a clear Light." For, while we view the Sinner, as under a Law, that re|quires &s;inle&s;s Perfection under Pain of eternal Dam|nation, we may ea&s;ily &s;ee how the Ca&s;e &s;tands with him.&mdash;He is under the Cur&s;e&mdash;he cannot obtain De|liverance, by any Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;, which he can do&mdash;he daily runs deeper into Debt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;he has no Claim to any Mercy, of any Kind, temporal, or &s;piritual&mdash;till he &s;ees this to be his Ca&s;e, and hear|tily approves the Law, by which he &s;tands con|demned, it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould &s;ee his Need of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or approve of or fall in with, the Way of Salvation by him.</P>
