</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN the&s;e Words of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> now read in your Audience, we have &s;et forth one principal and important Branch of the mini&s;terial Office, and the grand Scope and De&s;ign of it. What he here affirms, with Re&s;pect to him&s;elf and o|ther Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, is incumbent upon all who are &s;olemnly &s;et apart, according to di|vine Appointment, to the Work of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try. For whatever Di&s;tinction there may be between the Office of an <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> and that of an <HI>ordinary Mini&s;ter</HI> in the chri&s;tian Church, their Work, with Re&s;pect to Preaching, is the &s;ame, as to the Subject-Matter, compleat Man|ner, and true Scope and End of it: So that the Apo&s;tles, and fir&s;t Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, were, in this Point, En&s;amples to all their Succe&s;&s;ors in the mini&s;terial Office; and it is now, as much
<PB N="6" REF="009394_0005_0F7345E616A5A738">
as ever it was, the &s;pecial Duty of tho&s;e, who are put in Tru&s;t with the Go&s;pel, to <HI>preach CHRIST, warning every Man, and teaching eve-Man, in all Wi&s;dom; that they may pre&s;ent every Man perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, in di&s;cour&s;ing upon the&s;e Words, I &s;hall, without any critical Remarks upon them, immediately apply my&s;elf to the Con&s;ideration of the &s;everal Things, clearly held forth in them, touching the Duty of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>That they &s;hould preach Chri&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>That they &s;hould do this in a clear, full and per&s;ua&s;ive Manner,</HI> "warning every Man, and teaching every Man in all Wi&s;dom&punc;"</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>That their principal View and governing Aim herein &s;hould be,</HI> "that they may pre|&s;ent every Man perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us."</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I &s;ay then,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters &s;hould preach Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not &s;pend Time to prove what is here &s;uppo&s;ed, viz. That Preaching is a principal and important Part of the Work of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters. The Characters by which they are de&s;cribed&mdash; the Duties injoined upon and Directions given to them in holy Scripture&mdash;and the Examples of the fir&s;t Mini&s;ters of the chri&s;tian Church, imply and &s;hew this to be a Duty &s;pecially incumbent on them,&mdash;a Bu&s;ine&s;s belonging to them, &s;o as it does not to others, who are not intru&s;ted with the &s;ame Office. But the main Point here to be con&s;idered is, What they &s;hould make the Sub|ject-Matter, the grand Theme of their Preach|ing:
<PB N="7" REF="009394_0006_0F7345E96DEFA4C0">
And this is JESUS CHRIST. Chri&s;t is, by Way of Eminency, the great Subject of the Go&s;|pel-Revelation, and Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, in their Preaching, &s;hould have a &s;pecial Reference and Regard to him; not meerly glance at, but point directly to him, &s;o as to di&s;pen&s;e and <HI>make ma|nife&s;t the Savour of the Knowledge of him,</HI> and lead Men to a thorough, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to a &s;aving Acquaintance with him. As they are Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters by Office, &s;o they &s;hould preach Chri&s;t, as he is revealed and &s;et forth in the Go&s;pel, as they would faithfully di&s;charge their &s;acred Of|fice, and an&s;wer the true End and De&s;ign of it. So did the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the great Oppo&s;ition and Ill-Treatment they met with for it. Acts V. 42. <HI>Daily in the Temple, and in the Hou&s;e, they cea&s;ed not to teach and to preach Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>This Phra&s;e of <HI>Preaching Chri&s;t</HI> is &s;everal Times u&s;ed in the New-Te&s;tament: And it is with a particular and immediate Reference to him, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays in the Text&mdash;<HI>Whom we preach.</HI> Now to preach Chri&s;t, as the Apo&s;tles did, and every one of his Mini&s;ters ought to do, is to preach the Doctrine or Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; <HI>even the My&s;tery</HI> (as it is expre&s;&s;ed ver. 26.) <HI>which hath been hid from Ages and from Generations, but now is made manife&s;t to his Saints.</HI> It is not barely in&s;i&s;ting upon, or frequently mentioning the Name of Chri&s;t, but preaching <HI>the Truth as it is in Je&s;us;</HI> declaring the whole Coun&s;el of God to Mankind revealed by Chri&s;t; always, in the
<PB N="8" REF="009394_0007_0F7345EA33CFAFE8">
Cour&s;e of their Mini&s;try, making the peculiar Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, which immediately concern the Kingdom of God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the principal Topics of Di&s;cour&s;e; and <HI>teaching Men to ob&s;erve all Things what&s;oever he hath commanded;</HI> explaining and urging the Precepts of Chri&s;tianity in a Manner agreable to the Nature, Spirit, and Genius of it.</P>
<P>More particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To preach Chri&s;t is to preach the per&s;onal Dignity of Chri&s;t:</HI> To &s;et him forth, in a &s;criptu|ral Light, both in his <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>human</HI> Nature, as <HI>God manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 3.16.</NOTE> This is one of tho&s;e My&s;teries of Godline&s;s, which, however inconceivable by us, is expre&s;sly revealed in the Go&s;pel, and to be preached by the Mini&s;ters of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Divinity</HI> of Chri&s;t's Per&s;on is to be taught and maintained again&s;t tho&s;e who deny it. He is to be preached, <HI>that he is the Son of God:</HI> yea, <HI>the only begotten Son of God</HI> by Way of Eminence and Di&s;tinction; not only fully re&s;embling, but al&s;o partaking of the Nature and Perfections of the Deity, <HI>being the Brightne&s;s of his Father's Glo|ry, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on:</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 1.3.</NOTE> Who <HI>was in the Beginning with God, and was God,</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Joh. 1.1.</NOTE> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of divine Excellencies, <HI>the Image of the invi&s;ible God, the Fir&s;t-born of every Creature,</HI> or before all Creatures, and <HI>by whom all Things, both in Heaven and in Earth, were created, and do con|&s;i&s;t,</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Cont: Ver. 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> and to whom divine Titles are given, and divine Attributes and Works are a&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009394_0008_0F7345EB0E8EE208">He is likewi&s;e to be repre&s;ented in his <HI>Huma|nity,</HI> and preached, that he is <HI>the Son of Man</HI> &mdash; that he became incarnate, or <HI>was made Fle&s;h and dwelt among Men</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. 1.14.</NOTE>&mdash;a&s;&s;umed the human Nature, and <HI>was made in all Things like unto his Brethren,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 2.17.</NOTE> whom he came to redeem and &s;ave&mdash;a mo&s;t in|nocent and righteous Per&s;on, who, altho' he really partook of the e&s;&s;ential Properties of hu|man Nature, was yet, by his extraordinary Con|ception and Birth, exempt from human Sin and Guilt, and was ever perfectly <HI>holy, harmle&s;s, and undefiled</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 7.26.</NOTE> &mdash; one who was <HI>filled with the Holy Gho&s;t without Mea&s;ure,</HI> <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John 3.34.

<P>And it is of no &s;mall Importance that the Mi|ni&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hould preach up his per&s;onal Dignity and Excellency; not only to lead Men to ju&s;t and worthy Conceptions of him, but al&s;o to convince them of his Suitablene&s;s and Ability to &s;ave them, and to &s;how what &s;olid Ground there is to hope and tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To preach Chri&s;t is to preach him in his Office-Character and Work, as the only Mediator between God and Man, and the Saviour of lo&s;t, guilty and peri&s;hing Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>The Go&s;pel contains the glad Tidings of Sal|vation to fallen Men by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in it we have the cleare&s;t and fulle&s;t Di&s;covery hereof. Yea, it is the &s;pecial Bu&s;ine&s;s, and peculiar Glo|ry, of the Go&s;pel, to unfold this great My&s;tery of &s;inful Man's Redemption by Chri&s;t. Herein
<PB N="10" REF="009394_0009_0F7345EB58A5C4C8">
the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented, not only in his per&s;onal Character and Dignity, as <HI>God mani|fe&s;t in the Fle&s;h,</HI> but al&s;o as being appointed and &s;ent of God, to mediate between him&s;elf and us, to effect a Reconciliation, and procure eternal Redemption and Salvation for us; and, as acting in this noble and exalted Character, performing the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Mediator and Saviour for us. And &s;urely this, which is &s;o much the Bu&s;ine&s;s and Drift of the Go&s;pel, &s;hould be made the Sub|ject and Scope of Mini&s;ters Preaching, to whom the Di&s;pen&s;ation of it is committed. Nor can they be &s;aid truly and fully to preach Chri&s;t, and to an&s;wer the &s;pecial Bu&s;ine&s;s and De&s;ign of their Office, if they wholly, or in a great Mea&s;ure, neglect to treat of tho&s;e peculiar and important Doctrines of the chri&s;tian Revelation, which re|late to Chri&s;t's Office-Character and Work.</P>
<P>They &s;hould not only treat of the human A|po&s;tacy and Guilt, which is &s;uppo&s;ed in the Sal|vation of the Go&s;pel, and upon which it is grounded, and labour, by the Precepts and Te&s;|timony of the Law, to convince Men of their Sins and Obnoxiou&s;ne&s;s to God's eternal Wrath and Cur&s;e, and of their own Inability to obtain Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Ju&s;tification and Life by the Deeds of the Law, and con&s;equently of their ab&s;olute Need of a Saviour; but al&s;o be e&s;pecial|ly careful to point out the glorious Remedy which divine Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s hath pro|vided, and <HI>te&s;tify that the Father &s;ent the Son to be the Saviour of the World.</HI> 1 Joh. 4.14.</P>

<P>Nor is it &s;ufficient to repre&s;ent him only in his general Character and Office, as our Mediator and Redeemer; but they &s;hould al&s;o treat di&s;tinct|ly of his particular Offices of a <HI>Prophet, Prie&s;t</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> with which he is inve&s;ted, and which are united in him; explain the Nature and De|&s;ign of each of them; and &s;hew his Faithfulne&s;s in the ready, diligent, and punctual Di&s;charge of them.</P>

The Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t was what the Apo&s;tles te&s;ti|fied, and much in&s;i&s;ted upon in their Preaching.

<P N="3">III. <HI>That their principal View and governing Aim herein &s;hould be,</HI> "That they may pre&s;ent every Man perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us." <HI>For in him</HI> (&s;ays St. <HI>Paul,</HI> Col. 2.9, 10.) <HI>dwelleth all the Fulne&s;s of the God-head bodily.

formed to his Image and Likene&s;s, and gradual|ly built up in a Conformity to him, in all chri&s;|tian Graces and Virtues, unto final and compleat Glory and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in Heaven.</P>
<P>But this Expre&s;&s;ion of being <HI>perfect,</HI> as appli|ed to the Saints in Scripture, has, I think, a &s;pe|cial Reference to their internal Sanctification, their moral Character, or that holy Temper and Life they are of: In which Re&s;pect, indeed, it can be &s;trictly affirmed of none, that they are <HI>perfect</HI> in this Life; yet, in a qualified and &s;crip|tural Sen&s;e, they may be &s;aid to be more or le&s;s <HI>&s;o,</HI> according to the Progre&s;s and Attainments they make in chri&s;tian Knowledge, Grace, and Holine&s;s, and tho&s;e Virtues of Mind and Life, which re&s;emble them to God and Chri&s;t, and in which the true Dignity, Happine&s;s and Perfec|tion of their Nature con&s;i&s;t. And &s;o, to pre&s;ent Men perfect in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, may imply, not on|ly, or &s;imply, winning or e&s;pou&s;ing them to him, by a cordial Faith in and Subjection to him, as their Lord and Saviour, but al&s;o training them up in the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, and a growing Conformity unto him in all chri&s;tian Graces and Virtues, that they may be <HI>meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</HI> and finally <HI>pre&s;ented, without Spot or Wrinkle, before the Pre|&s;ence of his Glory with exceeding Joy.</HI></P>
<P>This is the grand De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel-Mi|ni&s;try. Eph. 4.11, &amp;c. <HI>He gave &s;ome, Apo&s;tles: and &s;ome, Prophets: and &s;ome, Evangeli&s;ts: and &s;ome, Pa&s;tors and Teachers; for the perfecting of

the Saints, for the Work of the Mini&s;try, for the edifying of the Body of Chri&s;t: Till we all come in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the Mea&s;ure of the Stature of the Fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t: That we henceforth be no more Children, to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the Sleight of Men, and cunning Craftine&s;s, whereby they lie in Wait to deceive: But &s;peaking Truth in Love, may grow up into him in all Things, which is the Head, even Chri&s;t.</HI> And this is what the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel &s;hould aim at, and make the grand Scope and End of their Preaching.&mdash; Love to Chri&s;t, and a compa&s;&s;ionate Concern for the Welfare and Salvation of precious Souls, &s;hould be the animating Principle and Motive in the Whole of their mini&s;terial Work. Whatever other &s;ubordinate Views they may lawfully have, their principal and governing Aim &s;hould be, to win Souls to Chri&s;t, and to pre&s;ent them perfect in him. With this View and De&s;ign &s;hould they engage, and con&s;tantly proceed in their great Work; <HI>preaching Chri&s;t, not out of Envy, but of good Will;</HI> not &s;eeking for them&s;elves, as their ultimate End, &s;ecular Honors and Profits, but the Honor of Chri&s;t, the Advancement of his King|dom, and the &s;piritual Profit of the Souls com|mitted to their Care, that they may be &s;aved; <HI>travailing,</HI> as it were, <HI>in Birth,</HI> by earne&s;t Con|cern and Prayer, <HI>for them, that Chri&s;t may be for|med in them;</HI> labouring to <HI>build them up in all Things,</HI> and to <HI>perfect that which is lacking in their

<P>Not that the mo&s;t faithful Preaching is always attended with de&s;ired Succe&s;s: So far from it, that the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t Mini&s;ters often have Oc|ca&s;ion to complain and &s;ay, <HI>We have laboured in vain, and &s;pent our Strength for Nought,</HI> with Re|&s;pect to many, if not the Bulk of their Hear|ers.

<P>The Go&s;pel is, by Way of Eminence, a Di&s;|pen&s;ation of Grace, and the Divine Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s are illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played, in the Whole,
<PB N="25" REF="009394_0024_0F7345FEC860F178">
and in the &s;everal Parts and Branches of it. The Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, in particular, is a wi&s;e and gracious In&s;titution, and &s;heweth the tender and faithful Care of Chri&s;t toward his Church, in providing &s;o well for its &s;piritual In&s;truction and Support, Edification and Comfort. It was one of the great Ble&s;&s;ings which God promi&s;ed to his People of old, <HI>I will give you Pa&s;tors according to mine Heart, which &s;hall feed you with Knowledge and Under&s;tanding.</HI> Jer. 3.15. And Go&s;pel-Mi|ni&s;ters are to be acknowleged, with all Thank|fulne&s;s, as precious Gifts of our a&s;cended Savi|our; be&s;towed for mo&s;t important U&s;es and be|neficial Purpo&s;es, even for the Propagation and Defence of Religion, for teaching, explaining, and inculcating the great Truths and Duties of it, and perfecting Men in the Knowledge and Practice of them. And however the Preaching of Chri&s;t by weak and frail Men, may, by &s;ome, be accounted Fooli&s;hne&s;s, and treated with Con|tempt; yet the Wi&s;dom, Power, and Grace of God are clearly manife&s;ted, in pitching upon, and making U&s;e of &s;uch Means for effecting the Salvation of them that believe.

<P>Mean and contemptible as this may appear in the Eyes of &s;ome, it is an Office of high Dignity, and a great Honor to be employed in it. The <HI>Son of God</HI> him&s;elf, who &s;urpa&s;&s;es the <HI>Angels</HI> of Heaven in Dignity, and is far more excellent and glorious than they, was a <HI>Teacher &s;ent from God,</HI> anointed to <HI>preach the Go&s;pel to the Poor</HI>&mdash;to pro|claim <HI>the acceptable Year of the Lord:</HI> And Go&s;|pel-Mini&s;ters are his Servants by Office, his Am|ba&s;&s;adors, authorized and &s;ent by him, to offici|ate in his Name and Stead, and to manage in the Affairs of his &s;piritual Kingdom. The Emba&s;&s;y they are charged with is of the noble&s;t Kind, and greate&s;t Importance: They are &s;ent to de|liver his Me&s;&s;ages of Grace and Salvation to &s;in|ful Men, and to per&s;uade them, through him, to be reconciled unto God.

<P>And the Importance of the mini&s;terial Office beareth Proportion to the Dignity of it. They, who are called to it, have a&s;&s;igned them a Work

<P>It greatly concerneth them, in particular, to receive, and treat with a cordial Affection and Re&s;pect, tho&s;e who are &s;ent to them in Chri&s;t's Name, with the important Me&s;&s;ages of Grace and Salvation&mdash;to reverence them as the Me&s;|&s;engers of Chri&s;t&mdash;to <HI>e&s;teem them very highly in Love for their Work's Sake</HI>&mdash;and to do what in them lies to encourage and &s;trengthen them in it, by &s;hewing an affectionate Regard to them, liberally &s;upporting them, and, above all, by their friendly Coun&s;els, fervent Prayers, and di|ligent and profitable Attendance on their Mini|&s;try.
