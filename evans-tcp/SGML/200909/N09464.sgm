<P>FOR thus &s;aith the Lord, Sing with Gladne&s;s for Jacob, and &s;hout among the Chief of the Nations: Publi&s;h ye, prai&s;e ye, and &s;ay, O Lord, &s;ave thy People, and the Remnant of I&s;rael.</P></Q>

<P>IN this Chapter, as in the foregoing, the Prophet foretells the Re&s;toration of the Jews from the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> &s;eventy Years Captivity:&mdash;that they &s;hould return into their own Land, rebuild their Cities and Hou&s;es; plant their Vineyards, and eat the Fruits thereof, and be happily re&s;ettled in their former State of Freedom and Plenty; in which they &s;hould be adorned with &s;ignal Marks of the divine Favour, and all the Signs of religious and civil Joy&mdash; <HI>For thus &s;aith the Lord, Sing with Gladne&s;s for Jacob,
<PB N="6" REF="012054_0004_0F896FCD37322468">and &s;hout among the Chief of the Nations:</HI> &amp;c. when you &s;ee the Dawning of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Times, expre&s;s your Joy for the Re&s;toration of Jacob's Po&s;terity, in the mo&s;t public Manner that can be, in the Sight of the Chiefe&s;t of tho&s;e potent Nations, from whence you are to be delivered. <HI>Publi&s;h ye, Prai&s;e ye&mdash;</HI> Publi&s;h tho&s;e good Tidings with the highe&s;t Expre&s;&s;i|ons of Prai&s;e and Glory to God,&mdash;<HI>and &s;ay, O Lord, &s;ave thy People, the Remnant of I&s;rael,</HI>&mdash;likewi&s;e pray earne&s;tly that God, who hath begun &s;o glorious a Work, would go on to complete and perfect it.</P>
<P>THE Words afford us this &s;ea&s;onable In&s;truction; <HI>That the joyful Prai&s;es of a People for Mercies recei|ved, &s;hould be accompanied with fervent Prayers unto God to &s;ave them from Judgments which are &s;till felt, or feared, by them.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Jews Deliverance from the Mi&s;eries of a long Captivity in Babylon was begun, in the fir&s;t Steps of their Return from among the Nations which oppre&s;&s;ed them, they were to <HI>&s;ing for Gladne&s;s, and &s;hout</HI> for Joy, to <HI>publi&s;h</HI> with the Voice of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;givings the great Favour of God towards them: And at the &s;ame Time to pray with all Earne&s;tne&s;s that God would &s;till deliver his People from the Calamities they were yet under, or might expect to meet with in their Journey to, and after their Arrival in their own Land. And what the Lord &s;aid unto them in the Words of the Text, he &s;peaketh unto us, and all the People of this Province; teaching us to ob&s;erve this Day of public Thank&s;giving as a Day of &s;olemn Prayer al&s;o:&mdash;That while we &s;ing for Gladne&s;s, and &s;hout forth the Honour of God's Name, publi&s;hing with the Voice of Thank&s;giving the Salvation, he hath
<PB N="7" REF="012054_0005_0F896FCDF747F270">&s;hewed our Nation and the People of this Land, in the Cour&s;e of the Year pa&s;t, and prai&s;e him therefor, we likewi&s;e make this fervent Prayer unto him, <HI>O Lord, &s;ave thy People.</HI></P>
<P>GOD's Di&s;pen&s;ations towards his People, and Mankind in general, to which we &s;hould accommodate our Devotions, are mixed of Mercies, and Judgments. In the Admini&s;trations of his moral Government He di&s;pen&s;eth both, in &s;uch Mea&s;ure and Manner, as his Wi&s;dom directeth his Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s. The Condition of a People in this World is not at any Time altogether pro&s;perous, nor quite de&s;perate. Their State is u&s;ually &s;uch as is elegantly de&s;cribed by the Prophet, Zech. 14.6.7. <HI>It &s;hall come to pa&s;s in that Day, that the Light &s;hall not be clear nor dark. But it &s;hall be one Day, which &s;hall be known to the Lord, not Day nor Night: But it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that at Evening-time it &s;hall be Light.</HI> Throughout the Day of Man's Life on Earth, the Light is neither clear nor dark&mdash;it is neither Day nor Night with him:&mdash;under&s;tanding by Light and Darkne&s;s, by Day and Night, Good and Evil. This is true of a People, during their continuance as &s;uch. Their Condition here is never perfectly and purely good, nor &s;o throughly bad, as to be void of all Comfort. In Heaven the Light is clear, without any Darkne&s;s at all: In Hell there is the blackne&s;s of Darkne&s;s for ever. In Heaven it is all Day, <HI>there is no Night there;</HI> but nothing el&s;e in the Dungeon of Hell. But Light and Darkne&s;s, Good and Evil, Peace and Trouble, which are perfect and &s;eparate in the other World, are, in a le&s;&s;er Degree of them blended in this. In this World there is a Day of Pro&s;perity, and a Night of Adver&s;ity; and yet neither Day, nor Night:
<PB N="8" REF="012054_0006_0F896FCEB7692288">&mdash;Not a Day without <HI>the Evil of it,</HI> nor a Night of unallayed Affliction. Sometimes the Light may prevail above the Darkne&s;s, but does not wholly di&s;pel it; &s;ometimes the Darkne&s;s prevails above the Light, but doth not wholly exclude it. The brighte&s;t Day of Pro&s;perity is not without Clouds, nor the darke&s;t Night of Adver&s;ity without Gleams of Con|&s;olation. Good and Evil, as to the Degrees of them, &s;ucceed each other; and they are curiou&s;ly interwoven into one Web, by the Art of divine Providence. So God tempereth his Di&s;pen&s;ations, intermingles Com|forts and Cro&s;&s;es, and the Work of his Providence is chequered.</P>
<P>To convince all, that <HI>verily he is a God that judgeth in the Earth,</HI> and engage our dutiful Regards to him, as the great, the wi&s;e, the ju&s;t, and good Governor of the World, the Lord u&s;eth a Variety and Mixture of Di&s;pen&s;ations towards Men in their pre&s;ent probationary State. In no other imaginable Way of dealing with &s;uch Creatures as we are, could there have been &s;o &s;uitable a Di&s;play of his glorious Perfecti|ons, to excite our due Acknowledgment of him in this high Relation he &s;u&s;taineth to us. If there were only Afflictions to be met with in this World, Sinners would have no Knowledge of the Goodne&s;s of God from his Providence, nor Invitations therefrom to Repentance. But he is <HI>the Lord that exerci&s;eth Loving kindne&s;s in the Earth,</HI> and &s;heweth his Bounty to his offending Creatures, that they might be induced to remember and return to him He maketh his Sun to ri&s;e on the Evil and on the Good, and &s;endeth Rain on the Ju&s;t and on the Unju&s;t. He leaveth not him|&s;elf without Witne&s;s to any, in that he giveth Rain from Heaven, and fruitful Sea&s;ons, filling their Hearts
<PB N="9" REF="012054_0007_0F896FCF74E52340">with Food and Gladne&s;s. All the Gifts of God's common Bounty, which are promi&s;cuou&s;ly &s;cattered abroad on every &s;ide, are &s;o many Witne&s;&s;es &s;ent to atte&s;t the divine Care and Goodne&s;s, which leadeth Men to Repentance. And were it not for the <HI>Judg|ments God executeth in the Earth,</HI> the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his moral Government would not appear, and no ill Con&s;equence of per&s;i&s;ting impenitent in Wickedne&s;s would be dreaded by Men. P&s;. 55.19. <HI>God &s;hall both hear and afflict them, even he that abideth of old: Becau&s;e they have no Changes, therefore they fear not God.</HI> Uninterrupted Pro&s;perity would bani&s;h all fear of God out of the World. God maketh him&s;elf known, as infinitely worthy of our highe&s;t Regards, by the Mercies and Judgments he di&s;pen&s;eth, according to his own Declaration, in I&s;ai. 45.6.7. <HI>That they may know from the ri&s;ing of the Sun, and from the We&s;t, that there is none be&s;ides me, I am the Lord, and there is none el&s;e: I form the Light, and create Darkne&s;s: I make Peace, and create Evil: I the Lord do all the&s;e Things.</HI></P>
<P>To prevent the Exce&s;&s;es which People are apt to run into in both States, pro&s;perous and adver&s;e, the Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence are mixed of Mercies and Judgments: That we might not &s;urfeit on Pro&s;perity, nor de&s;pond in Adver&s;ity,&mdash;wax wanton, nor become de&s;perate. Did Men always enjoy a flouri&s;hing Pro&s;|perity, would they not be corrupted, and de&s;troyed thereby? <HI>Je&s;urun</HI> waxed fat, and kicked:&mdash;then he for&s;ook God which made him, and lightly e&s;teemed the Rock of his Salvation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. 32.15.</NOTE> Did they meet with no|thing but Di&s;appointment and Trouble, would they not be &s;wallowed up of Sorrow? <HI>I had fainted,</HI> &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>unle&s;s I had believed to &s;ee the Goodne&s;s
<PB N="10" REF="012054_0008_0F896FD0FB58D348">of the Lord in the Land of the living.</HI> A Mixture therefore of providential Di&s;pen&s;ations is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent Mens being ruin'd by uninterrupted Pro&s;peri|ty, or overwhelm'd with perpetual Adver&s;ty: And to teach them Moderation in all things; <HI>to weep, as tho' they wept not; and to rejoice, as tho' they rejoiced not; and to u&s;e this World, as not abu&s;ing it, &s;ince the Fa&s;hion of it pa&s;&s;eth away.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cor. 7.30, 31.</NOTE> God wi&s;ely di&s;pen&s;eth Good and Evil to Men, that they might not in their Pro&s;perity &s;ay, their Mountain &s;tandeth &s;trong, and they &s;hall never be moved, but rejoice with trembling: Nor in their Adver&s;ity &s;ay, they &s;hall never be deli|vered, but hope &s;till in God. The mo&s;t pro&s;perous Condition here is deficient in &s;ome Conveniences, and blended with &s;ome Troubles, that Men might not be exce&s;&s;ive in their Rejoicings: And the mo&s;t adver&s;e Condition hath &s;omewhat of Good in it, to compen|&s;ate for its Evils, and Hope lieth at the bottom of it, that they &s;hould not be immoderate in their Griefs. Some Evil there always is in our State on Earth, to &s;hew that we are not pa&s;t Danger: and &s;ome Good, to &s;hew that we are not &s;hut out from all Hope. As a wi&s;e Pilot taketh in &s;o much Burthen, as will balla&s;t the Ship, and not &s;ink it: So in the mid&s;t of the Favours with which we are encompa&s;&s;ed in this World, God layeth &s;uch a Burthen of Affliction upon us, as might &s;erve to keep us &s;teady, when the Wind of Temptation filleth the Sails. The Scales of Providence are even, and God weigheth out Good and Evil in due Proportion; puts that into one Condition, which may reduce it to &s;ome Ballance with another. He &s;o allayeth the Sweet|ne&s;s of Pro&s;perity, and the Bitterne&s;s of Adver&s;ity, that we might pre&s;erve an equal Temper of Mind in both, and not be puffed up with one, nor ca&s;t down by the other.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="012054_0009_0F896FD1F4E92698">
THE Di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence being for wi&s;e and good Rea&s;ons mixed of Mercies and Judgments, our thankful Prai&s;es &s;hould be accompained with our fer|vant Prayers. When we <HI>&s;ing for Gladne&s;s,</HI> and &s;hout for Joy, publi&s;hing God's Mercies and prai&s;ing him for them, we &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>O Lord, we be&s;eech thee, &s;ave thy People.</HI> Our devotional Addre&s;&s;es to God &s;hould be conformable to his Di&s;pen&s;ations towards us. We have this Direction given us for them in Scripture, Phil 4.6. <HI>In every Thing by Prayer and Supplication, with Thank&s;giving, let your Reque&s;ts be made known unto God.</HI>&mdash;In every Thing that occurs, in every Condition, and on every proper Occa&s;ion, let Prayer be mingled with Thank&s;giving,&mdash;offer your Petitions with your Thanks to Almighty God. So in 1. The&s;. 5.16. <HI>Rejoice evermore, pray without cea&s;ing. In every thing give Thanks: For this is the Will of God con|cerning you in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> It is his Will declared in the Go&s;pel, that Chri&s;tians &s;hould be always rejoicing, praying, and giving of Thanks, whatever their Cir|cum&s;tances may be&mdash;never to cea&s;e praying, nor in any thing to omit Thank&s;giving. The&s;e Duties may be well performed together without Interference, or ju&s;tling one another: There is always room and occa|&s;ion for both.</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE is always Room and Occa&s;ion for Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, even in Circum&s;tances of greate&s;t Affliction and Di&s;tre&s;s. We are never incompa&s;&s;ed with &s;uch Troubles and Sorrows in this Life, as not to have greater Cau&s;e of Thankfulne&s;s, than Complaint. We &s;hould con&s;ider what Proportion there is between the Mercies and Judgments di&s;pen&s;ed to us in the Admini&s;trations of Providence, and not be di&s;compo&s;|ed, and put out of tune by the latter for &s;inging with
<PB N="12" REF="012054_0010_0F896FD2757E1B68">Gladne&s;s, and prai&s;ing God for the former. We are too apt to pore only on the Afflictions we &s;uffer, and to overlook the Ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy. It is our Weakne&s;s, and Sin, that a &s;mall Inconvenience attending us, hindereth us from rejoicing in, and prai&s;ing God for many and great Comforts. <HI>One dead Fly cau&s;eth all our Ointment to &s;tink.</HI> One di&s;agreeable Circum&s;tance of our worldly State, marreth the grateful Reli&s;h of the whole. So long as there was one Man at Court, who would not cringe to him, all <HI>Haman</HI>'s Honors, Riches, royal Fea&s;ts, and the like Accommodations, <HI>availed Him nothing.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">. 5.13.</NOTE> The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Kingdom would not keep <HI>Ahab</HI> from being <HI>heavy and di&s;plea&s;ed,</HI> when he could not get a &s;mall Vineyard he coveted.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1. King's 21.4.</NOTE> The imaginary want of that pinched him in all his Affluence of Wealth, and took away his Stomach, &s;o that he might have &s;tarved in the mid&s;t of his royal Dainties. Had we a due Con&s;ideration of the innumerable and ine&s;timable Benefits God hath done unto us, we &s;hould in any Afflictions we &s;uffer be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay as <HI>Job</HI> did in his, <HI>&s;hall we receive Good at the Hand of the Lord? and &s;hall we not receive Evil al&s;o?</HI> Do we not receive more good than evil Things in this Life? The lea&s;t of the former is more; the greate&s;t of the latter is le&s;s than we de&s;erve. Are our Afflictions worthy to be compared with our Mercies? <HI>Wherefore doth a liv|ing Man complain, a Man for the Puni&s;hment of his Sins?</HI> A Man &s;till among the living, and con&s;cious that his Lot might ju&s;tly be among the dead, &s;hould prai&s;e the God of his Life. He enjoys the mo&s;t de&s;i|rable thing in this World, and for the &s;ake of which, had he every other, he would part therewith. He &s;hould therefore re&s;olve as <HI>David, While I live, will I prai&s;e the Lord: I will &s;ing Prai&s;es unto my God while I have any being.</HI> Whatever our Lo&s;&s;es, Cro&s;&s;es,
<PB N="13" REF="012054_0011_0F896FD3382DA338">and Afflictions be, we are, in Compari&s;on of what is due to us, very favourably dealt with. Should a Cre|ditor exact but a &s;mall part of our Debt to him, &s;hould we not be much plea&s;ed, and ready to thank him? And why &s;hould we not be &s;o with re&s;pect to God, dealing thus graciou&s;ly with us? He might ju&s;tly deprive us of all good Things: Strip us of all our Comforts, and &s;eparate us to all evil, and only evil: It is plainly therefore our Duty to be thankful in any Condition on this &s;ide the Grave and Hell. We mu&s;t acknowledge with the afflicted Church, <HI>It is of the Lord's Mercies that we are not con&s;umed,&mdash;they are new every Morning: Great is thy faithfulne&s;s</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lam. 3.22, 23.</NOTE> Even in Judgment inflicted on us, who might have it with|out Mercy, there may be more Mercy in it than Judgment: In which Sen&s;e that is true which the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>Mercy rejoiceth again&s;t Judgment,</HI>&mdash;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jam. 2.13.</NOTE> boa&s;ts it&s;elf&mdash;triumphs over it. God, as the Sun (&s;aith one) when he &s;eemeth mo&s;t to infe&s;t and &s;corch us, doth even then di&s;pen&s;e u&s;eful and &s;alutary Influences upon us. There is not indeed any thing in Nature &s;o venemous, but that from it by Art and Indu&s;try may be extracted &s;ome what medicinal and of &s;alutary u&s;e, when duly applied. In mo&s;t apparent Evils lieth in|clo&s;ed much Good, which if we carefully &s;eparate, we may find Benefit and ta&s;te Comfort from. There is no|thing &s;o thoroughly bad, as being well ordered and improved, will not yield us more good. <HI>It is good for me,</HI> &s;aith <HI>David, that I have been afflicted.</HI> There is nothing commonly more nece&s;&s;ary, more whole|&s;ome, and beneficial to Men than Adver&s;ity. Afflic|tion is the School of Wi&s;dom, in which we learn God's Statutes. It is the Furnace of the Soul, in which it is tried and refined. It is the Means of reclaiming them from Sin, and improving them in Grace, and pre|paring
<PB N="14" REF="012054_0012_0F896FD3F680B2A0">them unto Glory. Why then &s;hould they be dumb to God's Prai&s;es in it, bear it with &s;ullen Silence, or break forth into Words of Impatience under it? They have rea&s;on to &s;ing of the Wi&s;dom, the Good|ne&s;s, and Faithfulne&s;s of God, in his cha&s;ti&s;ing them: Not only to be contented with, but thankful for the Troubles, Di&s;a&s;ters, and Di&s;appointments they meet with in an evil World, as they prove on many Accounts advantageous to them. We &s;hould return Thanks to God, not for our Food only, but al&s;o for our Phy&s;ic, which, tho' di&s;ta&s;teful to our Palate, is profitable to our Health. Whatever proceeds from good Intention, and tendeth to a happy End,&mdash;is de&s;igned, and effec|tually conduceth to our good, is a fit Subject of Thank&s;giving. If we con&s;ult Experience, we &s;hall find, that, as many have cau&s;e to mourn that they have enjoyed &s;o much Pro&s;perity, and received their Con&s;o|lation here; &s;o many have cau&s;e to rejoice that they have &s;uffered Adver&s;ity, and ta&s;ted &s;o deep of the bitter Cup.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perii&s;&s;em, ri&s;i Perii&s;&s;em.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. THERE is likewi&s;e Room and Occa&s;ion for Prayer and Supplication even in Circum&s;tances of greate&s;t Pro&s;perity and Peace. In &s;uch the Lord's People &s;hould <HI>be&s;eech</HI> him to <HI>&s;ave</HI> them&mdash;to deliver them from the Evil &s;till incumbent, or to which they are expo&s;ed&mdash;to lengthen out their Tranquility&mdash;to complete and perfect their Salvation. With their thankful Acknowledgments of Mercies received, they are to make their humble Addre&s;&s;es to the Throne of Grace for all which they farther need. If we &s;incerely prai&s;e God for any Tokens of his Favour which he &s;heweth us, we &s;hall be &s;o affected with the Tokens of his Anger which there &s;till may be, as earne&s;tly to de&s;ire the removal of them. And if we are truly thankful for his Ble&s;&s;ings, we cannot but be de&s;irous
<PB N="15" REF="012054_0013_0F896FD4B7373D18">of their Continuance and Increa&s;e. We may &s;eem highly gratified with &s;ome In&s;tances of God's Bounty to us, greatly plea&s;ed with the Smiles of his Providence in &s;ome Re&s;pects, and yet our rejoicing in them, and prai&s;ing God for them may ari&s;e from carnal Self-love; or becau&s;e Provi&s;ion, we may vainly imagine, is made for our Lu&s;ts, and we are Heaven's Favourites, who are &s;o bountifully dealt with; if we, at the &s;ame Time, take no Notice of the Marks of God's Di&s;plea&s;ure upon us in other Re&s;pects, cau&s;ing us to rejoice with trembling, and in our prai&s;ing God to pray unto him for his Salvation.</P>
<P>THE Memory of pa&s;t Benefits, and Sen&s;e of pre|&s;ent, which there is in Thank&s;giving, confirms our Faith, and nouri&s;hes our Hope of future. The Mercies of God are to be thankfully received and entertain'd by us, as Pledges of his Love, and &s;o Encouragements to tru&s;t in him, and &s;eek unto him for all we farther need. And a truly grateful Sen&s;e of Benefits done unto us, is the be&s;t Preparation of the Heart to a&s;k for more. It is the Di&s;po&s;ition to which our divine Benefactor hath &s;pecial Regard, in the Be&s;towment of them. He is ready to give, wherever he &s;eeth a Di&s;po&s;ition worthily to entertain his Ble&s;&s;ings: So that the mo&s;t thankful Receiver of them, is the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful Petitioner for them. When therefore we are mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of our great Benefactor's Goodne&s;s in tho&s;e Effects of it which we with Hearts glowing with Gratitude acknowledge; our ardent Petitions breathed out to him with our thankful Prai&s;es will (we may hope) be accepted and granted by him. Fervent Prayer, mingled with Thank&s;giving, availeth much. If we thus make known our Reque&s;ts to God, he will be &s;o far from &s;tinting his Hand to us, that he
<PB N="16" REF="012054_0014_0F896FD575962B90">will <HI>rejoice over us to do us good,</HI> and be as ready and as highly plea&s;ed to multiply his Benefits upon us, as we can be to a&s;k and receive them.</P>
<P>IN every thing that we give Thanks, there is need of Prayer al&s;o, that it may be to us Matter of Thank&s;|giving:&mdash;that it may prove advantageous unto us, that our Ble&s;&s;ings may not be cur&s;ed, nor our Afflicti|ons be un&s;anctified to us; but that all Things of different Qualities mixed and di&s;pen&s;ed by the &s;kilful Hand of Providence, may, either in their pre&s;ent and imme|diate, or in their future and more remote Con&s;equen|ces, <HI>work together for our good.</HI></P>
<P>THERE being always Room and Occa&s;ion in all Con|ditions and Circum&s;tances for Thank&s;giving and Prayer, the&s;e are Duties which &s;hould always accompany one another.</P>
<P>MY BRETHREN,</P>
<P>WE &s;ee the Expedience and Propriety of appoin|ting this Day to be ob&s;erved as a Day of <HI>public Thank&s;|giving</HI> throughout this Province: and that the Purpo|po&s;es of a <HI>public Fa&s;t,</HI> (which &s;ome may think would have been more &s;ea&s;onable) may be an&s;wered thereby, if the People, as they are exhorted, <Q>accompany their devout Prai&s;es for the many great and unde&s;erved public Mercies, which amid&s;t the various Tokens of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, God hath be&s;towed on us, with their fervent Prayers to him, that tho&s;e Judgments which we labour under may be removed&mdash;that tho&s;e we have rea&s;on to fear may be averted&mdash;and that we may be prepared &s;uitably to receive every Token of Divine Favour which it may plea&s;e a mer|ciful God to be&s;tow upon us.</Q> The religious Ser|vice
<PB N="17" REF="012054_0015_0F896FD63724F180">of the Day being in the Magi&s;trates Order for it &s;o clearly pointed out to us, the Mini&s;ter &s;hould direct and urge the &s;incere Performance of it.&mdash;Suffer we therefore this Word of Exhortation, <HI>&s;ing for gladne&s;s,&mdash;publi&s;h ye, prai&s;e ye, and &s;ay, O Lord, &s;ave thy People.</HI> Let us offer our united Prai&s;es for the Favours con|ferred upon us in the Cour&s;e of the Year pa&s;t, which hath not indeed been withouts it's Troubles, and &s;uch as have been complained of as the greate&s;t ever met with in the Country. We have yet Cau&s;e to celebrate our annual <HI>&s;olemn Fea&s;t,</HI> and rejoice before the Lord. An Expre&s;&s;ion in the Prophets occurs to my Thoughts; <HI>Offer a Sacrifice of Thank&s;giving with Leaven.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Am. 4.5.</NOTE> Leaven was forbidden in other Sacrifices,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lev. 2.11.</NOTE> but requi|red in this of Thank&s;giving,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">C. 7. V. 13.</NOTE> to teach us (&s;aith <HI>Ain&s;|worth</HI>) to temper our Joy with Sorrow and Affliction in this Life. Our Joy on this Day of the Gladne&s;s of our Hearts, &s;hould be tempered, but not &s;tifled, with a &s;orrowful Sen&s;e of the Affliction which the Province is in. Notwith&s;tanding which, there are many and great public Mercies, which call for our thankful Acknowledgments. Particularly, the Peace which we have in the Peace of our Nation with foreign Ene|mies, by His Maje&s;ty's Care pre&s;erved to all his Do|minions. It is for a Lamentation, that we have been no more at peace among our&s;elves. Pray we for the Peace of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI>&mdash;The general Health we have been and &s;till are favoured with, demands our public Thanks; and we &s;hall heartily render the &s;ame to God, unle&s;s the Commonne&s;s and Continuance of &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing hath abated and enervated our Gratitude. We have not been vi&s;ited this Year with infectious, or any epedemical Di&s;ea&s;es, which have &s;ometimes carried People away as with a Flood: Though &s;ome (ala&s;s!) have been <HI>driven from Light
<PB N="18" REF="012054_0016_0F896FD6F9DFCFA8">into Darkne&s;s, and cha&s;ed out of the World,</HI> by the Violence of &s;tormy Winds, and of human Hands. While our Souls ble&s;s the Lord, who healeth our Di|&s;ea&s;es, and redeemeth our Lives from De&s;truction, who &s;tilleth the Noi&s;e of the Seas, the Noi&s;e of their Waves, and the Tumult of the People; let us pray, that the People may be forgiven all their Iniquity, and &s;o the Inhabitants of this Land may not &s;ay, <HI>we are &s;ick:</HI> nor have Occa&s;ion, or Colour, of Complaint, that their <HI>Blood is &s;hed like Water</HI>&mdash;poured forth with|out Pity or Remor&s;e&mdash;too often the &s;ad Con&s;equence of inte&s;tine Jars and Quarrels. Let us be&s;eech the Lord, who ruleth the raging of the Sea, to re&s;train the Wrath of Men, which is cruel when it breaketh out in mobbi&s;h Fury, or military Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>THERE is the Joy of a plentiful Harve&s;t, in which we are to &s;ing with Gladne&s;s, and &s;hout forth the Prai&s;es of Him that hath given us fruitful Sea&s;ons, and crowned the Year with his Goodne&s;s &s;o that we have all Things nece&s;&s;ary and convenient for Life and Godline&s;s &s;till given us richly to enjoy, tho' &s;o much of the worldly Sub&s;tance of many, e&s;pecially in this and other maritime Towns, hath been de&s;troyed by the raging Tempe&s;t, and &s;welling Tide. By whatever Means our E&s;tates have been dimi&s;hed, or our thriv|ing in them ob&s;tructed,&mdash;whether by impoveri&s;hing Events of divine Providence, or oppre&s;&s;ive Mea&s;ures of human Government, or our own Imprudence, yet the good Encrea&s;e of our Land (free from Parliamentary Taxation) certainly calls for the Ob&s;ervation of this an|niver&s;ary Solemnity. In which, while we with Hearts full of Food and Gladne&s;s give Thanks to the Author of our Plenty, let us take heed, and pray, that our Table may not become a Snare before us, and what is de|&s;igned
<PB N="19" REF="012054_0017_0F896FD7B4E16250">for our Welfare be a Trap&mdash;that we may not abu&s;e the good Things our great Benefactor with &s;o li|beral a Hand be&s;towed on us, to Intemperance and Sen&s;uality, Irreligion and Forgetfulne&s;s of God. Let not <HI>the Fea&s;t of In-gathering</HI> be made by any of us the Sea&s;on, nor prove to any the Occa&s;ion of riotous Exce&s;s, and &s;inful Extravagance. May the Lord &s;ave his Peo|ple in this Land from &s;uch Gluttony and Drunkenne&s;s, and voluptuous Living, as he charged his People I&s;rael with in their affluent Circum&s;tances, and, which was an Aggravation of their Sins, they mo&s;t indulg'd them&s;elves in on the &s;olemn Fea&s;t-days appointed and &s;et apart on purpo&s;e religiou&s;ly to commemorate the Ble&s;&s;ings and Benefits they had received from God, and to return him due Thanks therefor. "Wo unto them that ri&s;e up early in the Morning, that they may fol|low &s;trong Drink, that continue until Night, till Wine inflame them. And the Harp and the Viol, the Tabret and Pipe, and Wine are in their Fea&s;ts, but they regard not the Works of the Lord, nor con&s;ider the Operation of his Hands,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 5.11, 12.</NOTE>&mdash;i. e. the Works of God in Memory of which tho&s;e Fea&s;ts were kept. Their only Care and Thought was to feed and pamper their Lu&s;ts with the Produce of a fruitful Land, and not to ble&s;s God who gave it them for an Inheritance, and therefore he cut them &s;hort as he threaten'd, &mdash;<HI>Yea, ten Acres of Vineyard &s;hall yield one Bath, and the Seed of an Omer &s;hall yield an Ephah,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. 10.</NOTE>&mdash;the Harve&s;t &s;hould produce but the tenth part of the Seed.</P>
<P>OF the enumerated public Mercies which we are called upon this Day thankfully to acknowledge, there is none, perhaps, to which People find their Hearts &s;o indi&s;po&s;ed, as that of the Admini&s;tration of civil Go|vernment; which hath been loudly complained of in
<PB N="20" REF="012054_0018_0F896FD93A9C68E8">our Mother-Country, and in this. And it might only increa&s;e the Clamours of &s;ome at it, to exhort them to &s;ing with Gladne&s;s for it, and to ble&s;s God with tho&s;e Tongues that have been u&s;ed to cur&s;e Men, made after his Image. I don't &s;u&s;pect there are any &s;uch among my Hearers; and may therefore &s;afely put them in Mind of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Exhortation to Chri&s;tians, under greater Oppre&s;&s;ion from bad Rulers, than we &s;uffer at this Day; that <HI>Thank&s;givings,</HI> as well as <HI>Prayers, be made for Kings, and for all that are in Authority.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1.1, 2</NOTE> Magi&s;trates are the Mini&s;ters of God to us for good, and when they faithfully di&s;charge their Office, and an&s;wer the End of their In&s;titution, they are to be reckon'd among the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings of God to the World. With all their &s;uperior Abilities and Advantages to promote the common Wealth, they have the natural Infirmities of other Men, and far beyond other Men are &s;ubject to Temptations, which too often mi&s;lead them into pernicious Cour&s;es of Admini&s;tration, and they do the People much hurt. And when the <HI>Wicked bear Rule, the People mourn.</HI>&mdash;And if it &s;hould admit of a doubt, whether Mankind receive Good from civil Government, &s;ufficient to make amends for the Evil they &s;uffer, through the Mi&s;takes, Follies, and Tyrannies of tho&s;e who manage it; yet they mu&s;t be wor&s;e Rulers than are known in <HI>Old England,</HI> or <HI>New,</HI> from who&s;e Admini&s;tration People do not receive more Benefits, than they &s;uffer Mi&s;chiefs: And they &s;hould accept the former with Thankfulne&s;s to God, while they groan under, and in lawful Ways &s;eek Deliverance from the latter. What the Proportion between the&s;e hath been in the late difficult Times, among us, I'm not about to com|pute: Would only ob&s;erve to you, that the religious Privileges, for the Sake of which principally, our pious
<PB N="21" REF="012054_0019_0F896F0216A19FF8">Ance&s;tors came into this Land, are hitherto enjoyed by us: and 'tis not pretended to be more than the Beginning of Encroachment on our civil Rights, that hath &s;o ju&s;tly alarmed our Fears of lo&s;ing them all. By the Ble&s;&s;ing of God on the Government over us, we continue as yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t valuable Liberties and Privileges belonging to Engli&s;hmen, and Chri&s;tians, and do lead our Lives &s;o comfortably as we do. We have &s;till Rulers that will not oppre&s;s us them&s;elves, nor, if they can prevent it, &s;uffer others to oppre&s;s us.&mdash;Tho&s;e exerci&s;ing Authority over us, whom we may ju&s;tly call Benefactors; and for whom we owe our Thanks to him who&s;e Mini&s;ters they are to us for Good.</P>
<P>IF the late Di&s;turbance of the public Peace, is to be imputed wholly to oppre&s;&s;ive Acts of Government, (which are apt to make a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> People <HI>mad,</HI>) yet this with all it's bad Con&s;equences is to be regarded as a &s;ore Judgment of God upon us; and the Joy of this Day be mixed with Sorrow on account of it. By leaving us to fall into ruinous Contention among our|&s;elves&mdash;into a mo&s;t unquiet State, in which Men's Minds have been extremely di&s;compo&s;ed, and exa&s;|perated; their Mouths filled with evil Speeches, bitter Invectives, and horrid Execrations; and their Hands &s;tretched out in ba&s;e injurious Deeds of Violence&mdash;the public Coun&s;els have been divided&mdash;friendly and pro|fitable Commerce interrupted,&mdash;Tumults rai&s;ed&mdash;Out|rages commited&mdash;Blood &s;hed, a righteous God hath puni&s;hed us for our Iniquities. His holy Anger hath been te&s;tified again&s;t us in all our Troubles, whoever were the mo&s;t active, faulty In&s;truments of them. Let us therefore, in the exerci&s;e of godly Sorrow, which is con&s;i&s;tent with &s;piritual Rejoicing, be&s;eech the
<PB N="22" REF="012054_0020_0F896FDA4366D980">Lord to &s;ave his People out of &s;o &s;inful and calami|tous a State. Let us hope continually in God, pray to him without cea&s;ing, and prai&s;e him more and more. If we are truly thankful for any Tokens of the divine Favour towards us in the Admini&s;trations of Govern|ment, our fervent Prayers accompanying our devout Prai&s;es to the great Governor of the World, who hath the Hearts of all Kings and Rulers in his Hand, may avail to procure his Ble&s;&s;ing on the public Coun&s;els, &s;o as that they &s;hall be directed to &s;uch Mea&s;ures as &s;hall promote our la&s;ting Welfare and Tranquility. We mu&s;t not expect the Perfection of Happine&s;s under the be&s;t human Management of our public Affairs, and that all things will proceed according to our Minds. Nor mu&s;t we faint, and be di&s;couraged, tho' our Grie|vances be not all at once redre&s;&s;ed. For the Exerci&s;e of our Faith and Patience Things may remain &s;till in doubtful uncertainty, and we not be able to &s;ay whe|ther they tend to Ruin, or E&s;tabli&s;hment. The late Time of Trouble and Di&s;tre&s;s in the Land, hath been &s;poken of as the darke&s;t Day that ever pa&s;&s;ed over us. Be it &s;o, yet who knows but that the pre&s;ent is the <HI>Evening Time</HI> of &s;uch a Day, when God hath &s;aid <HI>it &s;hall be light?</HI> Let us rejoice in Hope, and pray in Faith, that we, and our Children to the late&s;t Po&s;te|rity, may enjoy &s;uch Peace, Freedom, and Felicity in the Land which our Fathers have left us for an Inhe|ritance, as God promi&s;ed to give his oppre&s;&s;ed People, the Remnant of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in their Re&s;toration to their former happy State, for which they were to <HI>&s;ing with Gladne&s;s, and &s;hout among the Nations, to publi&s;h, prai&s;e, and pray,</HI> as in the Text. Jer. 30.18.&mdash;<HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, I will bring again the Captivity of Jacob's Tents, and have Mercy on his Dwelling Places, and the City &s;hall be built on her own Heap, and the

And out of them &s;hall proceed Thank&s;giving, and the Voice of them that make merry: And I will multiply them, and they &s;hall not be few; I will al&s;o glorify them, and they &s;hall not be &s;mall. Their Children al&s;o &s;hall be as aforetime, and their Congregation &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed be|fore me, and I will puni&s;h all that oppre&s;s them.
