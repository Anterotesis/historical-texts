<P>I HAVE thro' bodily Indi&s;po&s;ition and many Avocations, been prevented writing the following Remarks &s;o &s;oon as I intended.</P>
<P>IT is with &s;ome Degree of Reluctance, that I enter the thorny Maze of Controver&s;y, and more e&s;pecially with my Brethren.</P>
<P>I would much rather we had been contending in a united Way, who of Us &s;hould do mo&s;t in promoting vital Godli|ne&s;s among&s;t us.</P>
<P>AND I can't but think, That, if peaceful Mea&s;ures had been concerted, the la&s;t Synod, and &s;uitably pur&s;ued, the Ferment of Oppo&s;ition would have, in &s;ome Cour&s;e of Time, langui&s;hed and expired.</P>
<P>I can &s;incerely declare, that it was with a View to promote Peace and Union, that I went to the la&s;t Synod; and I know that others of my Brethren, who are now re|jected, were of the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>BUT Affairs being brought to a &s;udden Cri&s;is, a melan|choly Nece&s;&s;ity urges our ju&s;t Vindication.</P>
<P>ALL that I de&s;ire of the Reader, is an impartial Con|&s;ideration of what is propo&s;ed in the following Sheets, after humble Supplication to GOD for Light and Direction.</P>
<P>MAY the All-powerful Sovereign of the Univer&s;e, and King of the Church, over-rule the&s;e uncomfortable Debates, to his own Glory, and his Kingdom's Good. I add no more; but remain</P>

<HEAD>I. REMARKS Upon the INTRODUCTION to the Prote&s;tation.</HEAD>
<P>_OUR Brethren ob&s;erve ju&s;tly, <Q>That there was &s;ome Di&s;&s;atisfaction in the Minds of &s;ome of the Synod,</Q> (the Occa&s;ion thereof was two Acts or Canons made by the Majority, which are afterwards mentioned) <Q>the Re|moval of which, it's &s;aid, was in|du&s;triou&s;ly try'd by the greater Part of that Body.</Q> It is true Propo&s;als were made, and that by Per&s;ons on both Sides of the Que&s;tion; which ought in Ju&s;tice to have been ob&s;erv'd. <Q>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Jonathan Dickin|&s;on</HI> did offer &s;uch an Overture, (as our Prote&s;ting Brethren mention) <HI>viz.</HI> Of getting the State of the Ca&s;e debated drawn up, by the Con&s;ent of both Parties, and &s;ent to the General A&s;&s;embly of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or to their Commi&s;&s;ion, or to the General Synod in <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> We gave in before the Synod in Writing; the Rea&s;ons why we declined a Compliance with this Propo&s;al; which our Prote&s;ting Brethren thought proper to omit entirely: We were of Opinion, that a Repre&s;entation of the State of Debate, con&s;ented
<PB N="4" REF="004820_0003_100DF7C1AB617800">to by both Parties, would be exceeding difficult, if practicable. Again, we thought, that this would keep the Matter in a long and uncomfortable Su&s;pen&s;e; not to &s;ay, that after repeated and deliberate Enquiries, we were fully fixed in our Judgment, and found the Smiles of Heaven upon our Practice, according to it. And therefore, to con&s;ent to make Application to di&s;tant Judicatories, where Matters might be mi&s;repre&s;ented, when we were Con&s;cience-bound in the controverted Affair, was, we thought, but a Tempting of GOD; and would, as we conceived, in&s;inuate what was not true, <HI>namely,</HI> That we were not fixed in our Judgment, when the Ca&s;e was otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>But altho' we couldn't con&s;i&s;tent with the Dictates of our Con&s;ciences, comply with the Mea&s;ures which the afore&s;aid Gentleman propo&s;ed; yet in the general, we cannot but approve of his taking Pains to pre&s;erve a Union in this Infant-Church. And I am of Opinion, that, if our Prote&s;ting Brethren were of the &s;ame Ca|tholick Principles with him and the re&s;t of the Brethren of that Pre&s;bytery, they would not have forced &s;uch a &s;udden Rupture as they have done.</P>
<P>Our Prote&s;ting Brethren proceed to ob&s;erve, <Q>That &s;till the Synod u&s;ed their Endeavours to accommodate this Difference, &mdash; that they prote&s;ted and a&s;&s;ured us, that they had no other De&s;ign in their late Act or Agreement, but to &s;ecure a learned Mini&s;try, &amp;c.</Q>&mdash; Well; and didn't we on the other Hand, whom they have rejected, a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame Thing, <HI>viz.</HI> That we de&s;ired and de&s;igned a well-qualified Mini&s;try as much as our Brethren? Only we thought that the Method, which the controverted Act propo&s;ed, infringed upon the Rights of Pre&s;byteries, which we could by no Means give into, either by a Compliance with the Act, or any Equivalent: We judged the afore&s;aid De&s;ign &s;uffi|ciently &s;ecur'd, without overturning the Plan of our Government.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004820_0003_100DF7C1AB617800">
As to what is &s;aid concerning <Q>the Overture brought in by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Gille&s;py</HI>&mdash;and my declaring (as is &s;aid) upon that Occa&s;ion, that the prote&s;ting Brethren would be only accountable to the Synod for their Conduct in Licen&s;ing and Ordaining Candidates &mdash; and that I in&s;i&s;ted, that they &s;hould be obliged to re|ceive all whom we &s;hould licen&s;e or ordain.</Q></P>
<P>So far as I remember, the Ca&s;e was thus; I was then as I am now, willing to come into all regular Subordi|nation of Judicatories to one another; but what I principally intended to oppo&s;e, was this, <HI>namely,</HI> A &s;uperior Judicatory's a&s;&s;uming to it&s;elf a Power, upon groundle&s;s Jealou&s;ies and Surmi&s;es, arbitrarily to exa|mine over again, Candidates who had been in an order|ly Manner licen&s;ed or ordained: I apprehended, that if this was given into, as it would encourage Unchari|tablene&s;s, &s;o it would effectually baffle all our Endea|vours to maintain the re&s;pective Rights of different Judicatories.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I was in &s;ome Su&s;pen&s;e of Mind, not having &s;tudied the Point, what Power the &s;uperior Judicatory had to invalidate the Acts of the inferior in the parti|cular Ca&s;e referr'd to. I do not well remember what I &s;aid upon that Head; but what I &s;aid, was not by Concert with my Brethren; and if there was a Mi&s;take in it, it was not theirs but mine.</P>
<P>It is like that I might urge the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Nece&s;&s;ity of the Synod's receiving as Members of their Body, &s;uch as we did licen&s;e and ordain; without cal|ling them to any farther Account. And this, in ordinary Ca&s;es, is no more than what is rational, and what has been practi&s;ed by the Synod of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> ever &s;ince it had a Being. And therefore to &s;ay that this Practice would ruin our Con&s;titution &mdash; as our Brethren &s;ugge&s;t, is in Effect to &s;ay, that to act ac|cording to the Frame of our Con&s;titution, tends to de&s;troy it; and that our Synod have been ruining their
<PB N="6" REF="004820_0004_100DF7C41A913D30">own Con&s;titution, ever before the controverted Act was fram'd. It's true when Matters of Complaint are offered again&s;t any particular Candidate, no doubt they ought to be judged of, according to their Weight and Evidence; but to &s;et up a Court of Inqui&s;ition, is, I think, of dangerous Tendency.</P>
<P>But tho' our Brethren &s;everely cen&s;ured One whom we had ordained, contrary to their Canon, without hearing him in his own Defence, and would not admit him as a Member of their Body; yet we never pre|tended to &s;eparate from them upon this Occa&s;ion. And here it may be ob&s;erved, That, in order to remove the Jealou&s;ies &s;ome of our Brethren &s;eemed to entertain re|&s;pecting our Care as to human Learning in Candidates, one of our Number offer'd a Propo&s;al of this Tendency to the Synod, That we were willing they &s;hould appoint Two of their Number to be pre&s;ent at our Examination of Candidates for the Mini&s;try; who, if they found us guilty of male Conduct, might accu&s;e us before the Synod. But &s;ome were not &s;atisfied with that Propo&s;al, urging that a Majority &s;hould &s;it with us in our Judica|tory; which we could by no Means con&s;ent to, becau&s;e it would take away the Power of our Judicatory, by &s;etting a Negative over it.</P>
<P>Our Brethren farther ob&s;erve, <Q>That while they were making fruitle&s;s Propo&s;als to accommodate the Difference, they found their prote&s;ting Brethren in|du&s;triou&s;ly laying the Foundation of a Separation, and going farther from them by their Practices than ever, for they claimed (&s;ay they) as their particular Right, by Virtue of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Orders, to preach at <HI>Society-Hill,</HI> and would not allow any but them&s;elves and Adherents this Privilege; tho' it was de&s;ired in Favour of Mr. <HI>Dicken&s;on;</HI> and thus, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, they refu&s;ed mini&s;terial Communion with the Synod, when reque&s;ted.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004820_0004_100DF7C41A913D30">
<HI>A.</HI> Here it is in&s;inuated, that what was done in the afore&s;aid Affair, was done by the joynt Con&s;ent of all the Brethren, whom they oppo&s;e; which was not Fact: If there be any Fault in the afore&s;aid Bu&s;ine&s;s, it is my own intirely; however I will relate the Rea&s;ons of my Conduct, and leave them to the Reader's Judgment.</P>
<P>When Application was made to me, as afore&s;aid, I was in &s;ome Confu&s;ion of Thoughts for a Time, and knew not well what to do. But being informed, that the People of the Town generally de&s;ired to hear tho&s;e who did preach on the Hill, more than others; I tho't it would be an Impo&s;ition upon them, to do otherwi&s;e than I did. The Stage being rais'd for the Rev. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> by his Friends, did, as I conceived, properly belong to them, and therefore was to be di&s;po&s;ed of by their Direction. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> having publickly ad|vi&s;ed his Friends, to hear &s;ome particular Mini&s;ters, whom he expre&s;&s;ed a peculiar Value for; If I had en|courag'd others, without his Con&s;ent, to come into his Pulpit, I knew not but that it might be offen&s;ive to him. And I confe&s;s I had an earne&s;t De&s;ire to preach my&s;elf at the Time reque&s;ted; it being the Sea&s;on, when in all Probability the greate&s;t Number would convene.</P>
<P>I think it &s;trange, that the Prote&s;ters &s;hould call this a Breach of Communion with the Synod: Pray, is one Member the whole Synod, or was any Reque&s;t made in the Name of the Synod? I would have been far from denying the afore&s;aid Gentleman, or any other of the Brethren, the Liberty of my own Pulpit; but the Stage was what I had not a Right to di&s;po&s;e of. I may farther add, That I had no Thoughts of what our pro|te&s;ting Brethren &s;ugge&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> Of opening a Breach with the Synod, by the afore&s;aid Tran&s;action.</P>
<P>If any of our Number have refu&s;ed to keep Chri&s;tian and mini&s;terial Communion with any of the prote&s;ting Brethren, &s;ince the Time afore&s;aid; I doubt not but
<PB N="8" REF="004820_0005_100DF7C70D504788">they will be able, at a proper Sea&s;on, to vindicate their Conduct in &s;o doing. But this by the by I may ob&s;erve, That the greater Part of tho&s;e who are now rejected, (&s;o far as I know) have not refu&s;ed Communion with their Brethren.</P>
<P>As to what is farther alledged, in re&s;pect of our en|couraging the Flocks of our Prote&s;ting Brethren to for&s;ake their Mini&s;try, I know nothing of this. I have not done it my&s;elf, neither do I know of any of our Number that has.</P>
<P>Whether our Prote&s;ting Brethren be found Divines, and of a Go&s;pel-Conver&s;ation, will probably farther appear, in the Cour&s;e of this Debate.</P>
<P><Q>And thus, they &s;ay, we have indu&s;trioufly rent their Congregations, by un&s;criptural Methods, with|out taking Notice of Chri&s;t's Rules, <HI>Matth.</HI> 16.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That there have been &s;ome Divi&s;ions con&s;equent upon our Preaching in &s;ome Places, we acknowledge; but that we indu&s;triou&s;ly or de&s;ignedly rent their Con|gregations, by un&s;criptural Methods, we deny.</P>
<P>As to the Papers of Complaint, which our Brethren now call Libels, they contained Grievances di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to us, which we thought it our Duty to make publick Mention of; and the Synod, I remember, did not think proper to cen&s;ure us for &s;o doing. We did then offer to prove the Matters of Charge again&s;t particular Mem|bers, if the Synod required it; but this was wav'd.</P>
<P>As to what is farther alledged of Mr. <HI>Blair,</HI> my Brother <HI>Charles,</HI> and My&s;elf, that we were earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed by the Pre&s;bytery of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> to table our Complaints again&s;t them, if we could convict any of them of any Thing unbecoming a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;|pel; but all to no Purpo&s;e. As to my Brethrens de|clining to offer Complaints at that Time, they are of Age, and able to &s;peak for them&s;elves. As to my own Conduct, this, I think, may be a &s;ufficient Apology, <HI>namely,</HI> That the Propo&s;al was Matter of Surprize to
<PB N="9" REF="004820_0005_100DF7C70D504788">me; I had no Thought about any &s;uch Thing, before it was mentioned in the Face of the Judicatory; my meeting with the Pre&s;bytery at that Time and Place, was meerly accidental; and my entering into a judicial Proce&s;s again&s;t any of them, was utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with my De&s;ign, and previous Appointments, of Itinerary Preaching.</P>
<P>From the Particulars afore&s;aid, our prote&s;ting Breth|ren conclude, <Q>That the Separation has been made by us, for a con&s;iderable Time pa&s;t, tho' we were united in Name:</Q> But how ju&s;tly, I leave to the impartial Reader to determine.</P>
<P>The Truth is, tho' we differed in Sentiment from our Brethren in re&s;pect of &s;ome Acts or Canons they had made; yet we de&s;igned no Separation from them upon that Account; we thought that mutual Forbear|ance would be the be&s;t Expedient in the Ca&s;e afore&s;aid. As we de&s;ired Liberty of acting according to our Con|&s;ciences, in the controverted Affair; &s;o we were far from a De&s;ire of impo&s;ing our Judgment upon our Brethren, or imagining that there was a Nece&s;&s;ity of Separation upon the Account of the afore&s;aid Diver&s;ity of Sentiment.</P>
<P>Our Prote&s;ting Brethren, in their Narrative, have quite omitted any Mention of the late extraordinary Act or Canon fram'd by the Pre&s;bytery of <HI>Donnegal,</HI> which <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> excommunicates, or deprives of Church-Privileges, all of their People that go to hear any of the Itinerary Preachers.</P>
<P>Whether this &s;hew'd a Di&s;po&s;ition to Peace and U|nion, I leave others to determine.</P>
<P>Our Prote&s;ting Brethren add, <Q>That at their meet|ing this Year, when they called to Mind, how un&s;ucce&s;sful they had been in u&s;ing all healing Mea&s;ures, that this damped their Hopes, and cut off all probable Grounds to think that we would li&s;ten to any new Propo&s;als of this Kind; and therefore they
<PB N="10" REF="004820_0006_100DF7C977E33870">cho&s;e to lay open &s;ome of their crying Grievances, and to complain of our infringing and violating the known Rights of Pre&s;bytery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;That if we had any Intention to an Accommodation, or were re&s;olved to adhere to the Pre&s;byterial Con&s;titution, this would open a Door for us to make Propo&s;als for Peace, and to te&s;tify our Di&s;like to Confu&s;ions and Di&s;orders in Chri&s;t's Church: But after much Time &s;pent (&s;ay they) without being allowed to enter into the Merits of the Cau&s;e&mdash;by a meer Circum&s;tance; &mdash;This put them out of all Hopes of obtaining Peace with their prote&s;ting Brethren upon Scriptural Terms.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Ca&s;e, &s;o far as I remember, was thus; When the Roll was call'd, the Prote&s;ting Brethren having Ex|ceptions again&s;t Mr. <HI>Craighead,</HI> and having &s;u&s;pended him, thought it proper for the Synod to enquire into that Matter fir&s;t, before they proceeded to other Bu&s;ine&s;s; which Motion was comply'd with. Hereupon the Pre&s;|bytery who had pa&s;&s;ed the Cen&s;ure, related divers Rea&s;ons for their &s;o doing, (in their Minutes) and among others this, of his preaching in Mr. <HI>Alli&s;on</HI>'s Congrega|tion without Leave.&mdash;Mr. <HI>Alli&s;on</HI> &s;everal Times de|&s;ired, that this Article might be con&s;idered, immediately and &s;eparately by it&s;elf; this we oppo&s;ed, as judging it rea&s;onable that it &s;hould be con&s;idered in the Place and Order it was brought in before us, namely together with the other Rea&s;ons of the Pre&s;bytery's Proce&s;s again&s;t Mr. <HI>Craighead;</HI> tho' in the mean time, we often declared our Willingne&s;s to rea&s;on upon, and con&s;ider that Mat|ter di&s;tinctly, in its proper Time and Place. But after we had entered upon the Con&s;ideration of Mr. <HI>Craig|head</HI>'s Affair, not being able to come to any final De|termination about it, for want of Evidence; while &s;ome of the Members were di&s;cour&s;ing about referring the Affair to a Committee, I was &s;urprized to &s;ee Mr. <HI>John Thom&s;on</HI> ri&s;ing up, and hear him prote&s;ting again&s;t &s;ome Brethren in the Synod (who he &s;aid were of a different
<PB N="11" REF="004820_0006_100DF7C977E33870">Opinion from the re&s;t) being concerned in the Com|mittee. This inclined me to think, that our Brethren were determined for a Rupture, and di&s;courag'd my propo&s;ing an Overture for Peace and Accommodation, which I was waiting for an Opportunity to communicate.</P>
<P>This Incident al&s;o &s;trengthened my Per&s;wa&s;ion (as afore&s;aid) namely, that when according to the Order of la&s;t Year's Minutes, they &s;hould have appointed a Com|mittee for the Fund, as u&s;ual, they wav'd it to an|other Time.</P>
<P>Their whole Management look'd in my Opinion, like a pre-concerted Scheme; and if our prote&s;ting Brethren would candidly tell the Truth, I'm per&s;waded they would acknowledge, That before they came to <HI>Phila|delphia</HI> this Year, they had re&s;olved on a Rupture, and &s;o prepared Matters for it.</P>
<P>However I couldn't per&s;wade my&s;elf, that Matters would be brought to &s;uch a &s;udden Cri&s;is, as they were, by Mr. <HI>Robert Cro&s;s</HI>'s bringing in of a Prote&s;t, and de|&s;iring it might be read. After the reading of this, our Brethren &s;igned it with great Precipitation; and altho' we de&s;ired to be heard, again and again, upon the Rea|&s;ons of the Prote&s;t, our Brethren were deaf to our Im|portunity, till they had fini&s;hed the tragick Scene.</P>
<P>And yet they declare a Willingne&s;s to receive us, with all Tenderne&s;s, upon our hearty Return to the Ob&s;evation of the Rules of the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Con&s;titution; (what, with all the Errors they charge us of being guilty of? O &s;trange!) But whether this Declaration be con&s;i&s;tent with the afore&s;aid Practice, let others judge.</P>

<HEAD>II. REMARKS UPON A PROTESTATION Pre&s;ented to the SYNOD, <HI>June</HI> 1. 1741.</HEAD>
<P>_IN what preceeds the Articles of Prote&s;t, the&s;e Things following may be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Prote&s;ters acknowledge, <Q>That notwith&s;tanding of the comely Order and &s;weet Harmony, which they &s;ay have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in this organized Church, for above the&s;e Thirty Years pa&s;t, in a very great Degree; that there was a great Decay of practical Godline&s;s in the Life and Power it, and many abounding Immoralities.</Q> If &s;o, then we query, Why was not this tragical Outcry rai&s;ed before, of the Expiring of this Infant-Church?&mdash;Is there not more Rea&s;on of Complaint, when there is a Decay of vital Religion, than when Church-Order is broken? upon the Suppo&s;ition the Charge be true. Is it not unrea&s;onable to take more Care about the Tything of Mint, Ani&s;e and Cumin, than the weightier Matters of the Law?</P>
<P N="2">2. The prote&s;ting Brethren inform us, <Q>That they are wounded and grieved at their very Hearts, at the dreadful Divi&s;ions, Di&s;tractions and Convul&s;ions, which, they &s;ay, have all of a &s;udden &s;eized this little
<PB N="13" REF="004820_0007_100DF7CB71B89F58">Infant-Church, to &s;uch a Degree, that &s;he is in no &s;mall Danger of expiring outright, as to the Form, and Order, and Con&s;titution of an organiz'd Church &mdash;unle&s;s he who is the King in <HI>Zion</HI> do interpo&s;e!</Q></P>
<P>Well, no doubt, Divi&s;ions are to be lamented, in re&s;pect of their Authors and Tendency; becau&s;e of the Guilt hereby contracted, and the Prejudice hereby frequently occa&s;ioned, to incon&s;iderate and unregenerate Sinners.</P>
<P>Yet we are far from imagining, with our prote&s;ting Brethren, that this Church is in &s;uch Danger as they apprehend upon the afore&s;aid Account; becau&s;e we are a&s;&s;ured by the &s;acred Oracles, that the &s;preading Power of Religion is u&s;ually attended with the afore&s;aid Con&s;e|quences, in a greater or le&s;&s;er Degree. Our Lord him|&s;elf informs us, that he <HI>came not to &s;end Peace upon Earth, but a Sword, Fire and Divi&s;ion;</HI> and <HI>to &s;et at Variance one Relation again&s;t another.</HI> Not that the Go&s;pel is the proper Cau&s;e of &s;uch Divi&s;ions; no, but the innocent Occa&s;ion only.</P>
<P>The prote&s;ting Brethren proceed to inform us, <Q>that after the mo&s;t deliberate and unprejudiced Enquiry into the Cau&s;es of the&s;e Confu&s;ions, they evidently &s;ee, that their prote&s;ting Brethren, and their Ad|herents, are the direct and proper Cau&s;e thereof, by their un&s;criptural, anti-pre&s;byterial, uncharitable and divi&s;ive Practices; which they have been pur&s;u|ing (&s;ay they) with all the Indu&s;try, they have been capable of, for above the&s;e twelve Months pa&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here, after, we hope, an impartial Examination of the Ca&s;e, we mu&s;t beg leave to differ in Sentiments from our Brethren, and to a&s;cribe the pre&s;ent Debates to a different and more early Source.</P>
<P>That which, in our Opinion, gave Rife to the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y among us, was our Brethren's Framing two Acts or Canons &s;ome Years pa&s;t; the one re&s;pecting the Admi&s;&s;ion of Candidates to the Mini&s;try, and the o|ther again&s;t itinerary Preaching.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004820_0008_100DF7CDC2E83B70">
We conceiving the afore&s;aid Laws to be (in our O|pinion) un&s;criptural and arbitrary, as well as of fatal Tendency to mar the Progre&s;s of the Work of God in this Land; did judge our&s;elves obliged, in Con&s;cience, to oppo&s;e them, both by Speech and Practice. Our Brethren, on the Contrary, thought it proper to main|tain them 'til la&s;t Year. That again&s;t itinerary Preach|ing has drop'd; but the other was &s;till pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Our Brethren expre&s;s their Prote&s;t with extraordinary Solemnity, but we hope that this Method, without &s;uf|ficient Evidence and Foundation, will not influence the Impartial and Judicious.</P>
<P>We agree to the fir&s;t Article of their Prote&s;t, <HI>namely,</HI> <Q>That it is the Duty of this Synod to maintain and &s;tand by the Principles of Doctrine, Wor&s;hip and Government, as the &s;ame are &s;ummed up in the Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Faith, Catechi&s;ms and Directory, compo&s;ed by the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> A&s;&s;embly, which this Synod have adopted.</Q></P>
<P>We al&s;o judge, that Part of the Second is rea&s;onable, <HI>namely,</HI> <Q>That the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, Catechi&s;ms, and Directory, &s;hould be adopted by the Members of the Synod: But, that no Per&s;on &s;hould be allowed to &s;it and vote in the Synod who acts or per&s;i&s;ts in any Practice contrary to any Rules contained in the Di|rectory, or Orders made by the Synod, until he pro|fe&s;&s;es of his Sorrow for &s;uch &s;inful Di&s;order, to the Satis&s;action of the Synod, or &s;uch inferior Judicatory, as the Synod &s;hall appoint for that Purpo&s;e;</Q> is, we think unrea&s;onably &s;evere.</P>
<P>According to this Plan, not only all the Rules in the Directory, are Terms of Communion, but al&s;o every Canon, form'd by the Majority, is a new Term added thereto, which may be multiplied yearly to an immen&s;e Volume.</P>
<P>And if one did adopt the Directory, in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, it is no &s;ufficient Security again&s;t Exclu&s;ion, un|le&s;s
<PB N="15" REF="004820_0008_100DF7CDC2E83B70">he can &s;wallow all the after-Canons, which &s;hall be contrived by the Majority.</P>
<P>Such a Scheme allows no Mercy for &s;crupulous Con|&s;ciences, and renders &s;ynodical Communion as preca|rious as the variable Humours and Fancies of Men.</P>
<P>In Adopting of the Directory, the Synod declared, that they were re&s;olved to conform to it in Practice as far as was &s;uitable to the Circum&s;tances of the Church in this Country. This Re&s;olution we adhere to.</P>
<P>But altho' we highly approve of the Plan of Govern|ment, a&s;&s;erted in the Directory; yet we think it hard and unrea&s;onable to make every Rule in it a Term of &s;yno|dical Communion: For at this Rate our prote&s;ting Brethren would be excluded from the Synod al&s;o.</P>
<P>And we can't but think it &s;trange, that our prote&s;ting Brethren &s;hould with &s;uch Solemnity declare to the World (in Effect) that they them&s;elves have no Right to &s;it and vote in the Synod; for they act and per&s;i&s;t in Practices contrary to the Doctrines and Rules of the Directory, as will appear by the following In&s;tances.</P>
<P>The Directory faith, that the Scripture doth hold out Deacons as di&s;tinct Officers in the Church. But have our prote&s;ting Brethren any &s;uch?</P>
<P>The Directory faith, it is convenient that ordinarily one Chapter of each Te&s;tament be read at every Meet|ing; and that the Canonical Books be read over in Order. Do our Brethren ob&s;erve this?</P>
<P>The Directory faith, concerning Marriage, that the Mini&s;ter is publickly to &s;olemnize it, in the Place appointed by Authority for publick Wor&s;hip. Do our Brethren ob&s;erve this?</P>
<P>The Directory faith, that he that is to be ordained, mu&s;t bring with him a Te&s;timonial of his taking the Covenant of the three Kingdoms, and that he be 24 Years old, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Do our Brethren ob&s;erve this, or think it &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd upon Pain of Exclu&s;ion?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004820_0009_100DF7D0339EAD08">
The Directory &s;aith, that the Power of ordering the whole Work of Ordination, is in the whole Pre&s;bytery. May our prote&s;ting Brethren be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to like this well, when they have ca&s;t us off for Con|formity to it?</P>
<P>How little Mercy &s;oever our Brethren were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew to us, yet we think they &s;hould have had &s;ome upon them&s;elves!</P>
<P>The three following Articles, being grounded on the former, fall with it.  <GAP DESC="blank"> But,</P>
<P>I mu&s;t proceed to con&s;ider the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> of the Prote&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> alledg'd is the Charge of <Q>heterodox and anarchical Principles, in denying (as is &s;aid) that Pre&s;byteries have Authority to bind their di&s;&s;enting Members,</Q> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For the Confirmation of which they refer to the 28th and 29th Pages of our Apology. Our prote&s;ting Brethren think <Q>that the Tendency of the afore&s;aid Pages, is to dive&s;t the Officers and Judicato|ries of Chri&s;t of all Authority, and that they contra|dict the 31&s;t Article of the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, which we have adopted.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We cannot di&s;cover the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the Con&s;e|quence our Brethren &s;peak of. We think that all that Authority, which is con&s;i&s;tent with the Rights of Con|&s;cience, and private Judgment, and the Peace of the Church, is a&s;&s;erted in the Pages referred to.</P>
<P>No doubt it is the Duty of Synods to have a Confe&s;|&s;ion of Faith, in which they ought to expre&s;s their Sentiments, concerning the E&s;&s;entials of Doctrine, Wor&s;hip, and Di&s;cipline; which ought to be adopted by tho&s;e they admit as Members of their Body.</P>
<P>But to &s;uppo&s;e that a Majority of that Body, who have comply'd with the afore&s;aid Terms of Commu|nion, are ve&s;ted with a Power authoritatively to make new Laws or Acts, from time to time, binding the &s;maller Number to obey them, who con&s;cienciou&s;ly &s;cruple and oppo&s;e them, and that from the very Time
<PB N="17" REF="004820_0009_100DF7D0339EAD08">of their Formation, &s;o that they &s;hall be excluded from &s;ynodical Communion, upon their con&s;cientious Di&s;&s;ent and Non-conformity, is, we think, to &s;ignify, that the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith and Directory already agreed to, is in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer its De&s;ign, without additional Articles, and Terms of Communion; as well as to open a Door for continual Oppre&s;&s;ions, Schi&s;ms, and Convul&s;ions in the Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>If a Majority of the Brethren, after adopting the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as afore&s;aid, &s;hall judge &s;ome new Rules or Acts nece&s;&s;ary for the Good of the Church, no doubt they may agree to ob&s;erve them, and may rea&s;on with their &s;crupulous Brethren concerning their &s;uppo&s;ed Lawfulne&s;s or Expediency; but if con&s;cien|tious Scruples notwith&s;tanding remain, we think it un&s;criptural and &s;evere, to exclude them from &s;ynodical Communion for &s;uch a Di&s;&s;ent in Judgment; in &s;uch Ca&s;es we judge that mutual Forbearance will better an|&s;wer the De&s;ign of Government, <HI>viz.</HI> The Edification of the Body of Chri&s;t, than any rigorous Mea&s;ures what&s;oever, in impo&s;ing new Terms of Communion.</P>
<P>As to Appeals or References, we think our Brethren don't give a full and fair Repre&s;entation of the Ca&s;e, as it is in the Apology, to which we refer the Reader for Satis&s;action.</P>
<P>We would hope, that our Brethren will not labour to defend any &s;uppo&s;ed Authority in Synods, to infringe upon the Rights of Con&s;cience and private Judgment, which we think ought to be pre&s;erved as &s;acred and in|violable. We know of no Authority on Earth, that can bind us without the Word of God, and it is our own and not another's Judgment of that Word, which we are to Follow.</P>
<P>We cannot &s;ee any Incon&s;i&s;tency, between our Senti|ments expre&s;&s;ed in the Apology, and the 31&s;t Article of our Confe&s;&s;ion. The Article &s;ays, that it belongs to Synods and Councils, <HI>mini&s;terially</HI> (not magi&s;terially) to
<PB N="18" REF="004820_0010_100DF7D1E80EFD58">determine Controver&s;ies of Faith,&mdash;and altho' the Article &s;peaks of an Authority, to determine concern|ing Complaints about male Admini&s;tration; yet it after|wards informs us, that the&s;e Decrees and Determina|tions, <HI>if con&s;onant to the Word of God,</HI> are to be received with Submi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;This plainly implies, that if we don't apprehend the Decrees afore&s;aid to be agreeable to the Word of God, we &s;hould not &s;ubmit to them; and therefore it's added, in the next Paragraph, That <Q>Synods or Councils are not to be made the Rule of Faith or Practice; &s;eeing that all of them &s;ince the Apo&s;tolick Times, may err, and many have.</Q> Our Confe&s;&s;ion urges no other Subjection, but in the Lord, and a&s;&s;erts <Q>his alone Sovereignty over Con&s;cience, and that he hath left it free from the Doctrines or Com|mandments of Men, which are in any Thing con|trary to his Word, or be&s;ide it, in Matters of Faith or Wor&s;hip; &s;o that to believe &s;uch Doctrines, or obey &s;uch Commands, out of Con&s;cience, is to betray true Liberty of Con&s;cience: And the requiring of an implicit Faith, and an ab&s;olute blind Obedience, is to de&s;troy Liberty of Con&s;cience, and Rea&s;on al&s;o.</Q> See Confe&s;&s;. chap. 20. paragr. 2.</P>
<P>We acknowledge all that Authority, which con&s;i&s;ts with the Rights of Con&s;cience, and private Judgment; but in the mean Time we cannot but abhor an impli|cite Faith, and blind Obedience, what&s;oever plau&s;ible Epithets of Order and Government they may be gar|ni&s;hed with, or what&s;oever Churchmen they may be urged by notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;econd</HI> Rea&s;on of the Prote&s;t, is <Q>our prote&s;ting a|gain&s;t the Synod's Act in relation to the Examination of Candidates, together with our Proceeding to licen&s;e and ordain Men to the Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel, in Oppo&s;ition to, and Contempt of &s;aid Act of Synod.</Q></P>
<P>In order to under&s;tand the Nature of this Act, as well as the Rea&s;ons of our Prote&s;t again&s;t it, I mu&s;t refer the
<PB N="19" REF="004820_0010_100DF7D1E80EFD58">Reader to the Apology hereto annexed: And &s;hall only as pre&s;ent add, That our prote&s;ting Brethren mi&s;repre|&s;ent the Ca&s;e, when they &s;ay we ordained Men; it was but One we ordained, contrary to the Synod's Act.</P>
<P>If our Brethren by the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, viz. <HI>And Con|tempt of &s;aid Act of Synod,</HI> de&s;ign to in&s;inuate, that in our Practice afore&s;aid, we contemned the &s;criptural Authority of the Synod, or the Judgment of the Majo|rity of our Brethren, they wrong us; we gave all that Deference to our Brethren's Authority and Judgment, which was con&s;i&s;tent with our irrefragable Right of Thinking for our&s;elves; we endeavour'd to examine, with all the Impartiality and Care we were capable of, the Rea&s;ons of our Brethren's Judgment, after &s;upplica|ting Jehovah for Light and Direction; and not finding the Arguments upon which they went, in our Opinion, relevant or &s;ufficient, we were con&s;trained by our Con|&s;ciences to act as we have done.</P>
<P>But tho' we did prote&s;t again&s;t what we apprehended (after deliberate Enquiries) to be wrong in our Breth|ren's Conduct, a Practice not unu&s;ual in Judicatories of our Denomination; yet we were far from carrying Matters to the pre&s;ent Cri&s;is, which our Brethren have done by their Prote&s;t, namely, to exclude our Di&s;&s;enting Brethren from Communion upon that Account.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> Rea&s;on of the Prote&s;t, is <Q>our making ir|regular Irruptions (as they &s;ay) upon the Congrega|tions of others, without Order or Allowance,&mdash; &s;owing the Seeds of Divi&s;ion among People, and doing what we could to alienate their Minds with unju&s;t Prejudices, again&s;t their lawfully called Pa&s;tors.</Q></P>
<P>Here the&s;e Things following may be ob&s;erved, <HI>viz.</HI> That what is proper in ordinary Ca&s;es may be prejudi|cial in Extraordinaries; when the Church is planted with a found, faithful and lively Mini&s;try, no doubt, tho&s;e Rules re&s;pecting Mini&s;ters keeping within the Bounds of their particular Charges, until they are invi|ted
<PB N="20" REF="004820_0011_100DF7D4F39110A8">in an orderly Manner to go el&s;ewhere, may be of Service: But upon the Suppo&s;ition that a Number of of the Mini&s;try are either un&s;ound in Doctrine, or un|faithful, and contentedly un&s;ucce&s;sful in their Work: Then is it not lawful to &s;u&s;pend the afore&s;aid Rules for a Sea&s;on? e&s;pecially in &s;uch a Situation of Affairs as this; <HI>namely,</HI> when there is an earne&s;t Thir&s;ting, in a Number of the People, after the clo&s;e and affectionate Preaching of the Word; and Mini&s;ters being al&s;o im|portuned by &s;ome of the People of the Places whither they travel'd, find them&s;elves &s;pirited to uncommon Labours, and perceive tho&s;e attended with uncommon Succe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But what our Synod did the la&s;t Year, at their Se&s;&s;ion, in my Apprehen&s;ion, weakens the Force of the preceed|ing Rea&s;ons: Did they not ca&s;hier and vacate an Act formerly made again&s;t itinerary Preaching, and openly in the Face of the World, acknowledge that there was a Work of God carrying on in the Land, and expre&s;s their Gratitude to God for it? Did not Mr. <HI>Robert Cro&s;s,</HI> who introduced this Prote&s;t, at that time, in a particular Manner, &s;peak honourably of the Work of God afore&s;aid, and of itinerary Preaching, and excite his Brethren to invite &s;uch into their Pulpits, mentioning what he and his Collegue had done to this Purpo&s;e in <HI>Philadelphia?</HI> What is the Occa&s;ion of this &s;udden Change, that what was then allowed of by our Synod, &s;hould now, by &s;ome of the &s;ame Per&s;ons, be loaded with bad Names of un&s;criptural, anti-pre&s;byterial, uncharitable, divi&s;ive Practices, and barefac'd Arrogance; and that a Number of Mini&s;ters (equal to tho&s;e that ca&s;t them off) &s;hould be rejected, becau&s;e that they were &s;aid to follow what was approved of la&s;t Year, and that before they were heard in their own Defence?</P>
<P>What is the Rea&s;on that our prote&s;ting Brethren were &s;o full in Favour of the Work of God la&s;t Year, in their publick Speeches and Acknowledgments; and that they
<PB N="21" REF="004820_0011_100DF7D4F39110A8">make no honourable mention of it in their Prote&s;t this Year? Has a little Space of Time alter'd the Nature of Things?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing that Mini&s;ters were both &s;ound and faithful, would it not be of Service to the Church of God for &s;uch as are &s;incere of their own Communion e&s;pecially, to preach in their Places? And if &s;o, is it not their Duty to invite them? Which if they neglect or refu&s;e, when a proper Occa&s;ion offers, are they not guilty of an uncharitable and divi&s;ive Practice? This, as I am informed, has been done by more than one of our prote&s;ting Brethren.</P>
<P>As to what is alledged, of our <Q>&s;owing the Seeds of Divi&s;ion among other Congregations, and doing what we can to alienate and fill their Minds with unju&s;t Prejudices again&s;t their lawfully called Pa&s;tors; is, I believe, without &s;ufficient Foundation;</Q> the Seed &s;own by my&s;elf and Brethren, &s;o far as I know, is the Word of God. I hope our prote&s;ting Brethren will not call that the Seed of Divi&s;ion. And our Inten|tion in itinerary Preaching was not as our Brethren un|kindly &s;ugge&s;t, to alienate and fill the Minds of the People with unju&s;t Prejudices again&s;t their Pa&s;tors; but to glorify God, and bring Sinners to him. But the Truth is, that &s;ome of tho&s;e who were awakened, without any Speech of ours in their Prejudice, have entertain'd, of their own accord, meaner Thoughts of the Mini&s;try of &s;ome of our prote&s;ting Brethren than formerly. <HI>THIS, THIS,</HI> &s;eems to have alarmed their Jealou&s;ies and Re|&s;entments about and again&s;t the Work of God, and &s;uch In&s;truments as he has been plea&s;ed graciou&s;ly to u&s;e in promoting of it.</P>
<P>Again, the afore&s;aid Rea&s;on of Prote&s;t, &s;eems to in&s;inuate, that all of us, whom they have excluded from their Judicatories, have preached in the Congregations of other Mini&s;ters without their Con&s;ent: A Charge which cannot be fairly proved. But to proceed: The
<PB N="22" REF="004820_0012_100DF7D76760EAD8"><HI>Fourth</HI> Rea&s;on of Prote&s;t, is (as they &s;ay) <Q>our Prin|ciples and Practice, of which, Judging and Condem|ning all who do not fall in with our Mea&s;ures, both Mini&s;ters and People, as carnal, gracele&s;s and Enemies to the Work of God. For the Proof of this, they re|fer to my Sermon again&s;t unconverted Mini&s;ters, and to two Papers of Complaint offer'd to the Synod la&s;t Year, by Mr. <HI>Blair,</HI> and my&s;elf.</Q> <HI>An&s;wer;</HI> We know of nothing in the afore&s;aid Sermon and Papers that gave Ground to the afore&s;aid Charge. We own that ra&s;h Judging is a Sin again&s;t God; but we know of no|thing in our Principles that leads to it. We are far from &s;uch Narrowne&s;s and Bigotry as to imagine that all God's Mini&s;ters and People are coop'd up within the Verge of any one particular Denomination; or that they are all of our Sentiments, and willing to comply with our Mea&s;ures in le&s;&s;er Things.</P>
<P>Our Brethren alledge, <Q>that ra&s;h Judging has been our con&s;tant Practice for above Twelve-Months pa&s;t, as well as of (as they call them) our di&s;orderly Pro|bationers.</Q> This Charge, our Opponents, we think, will not be able to prove. Indeed, we have been very jealous about our prote&s;ting Brethren's States towards God, becau&s;e of their incon&s;i&s;tent Conduct in re&s;pect of the Work of God, &s;ometimes Approving and &s;ome|times Di&s;approving of it; and repre&s;enting of it in a gloomy Dre&s;s, becau&s;e of &s;ome uncommon Incidents and Circum&s;tances, which might admit of a favourable Interpretation. Has not Mr. <HI>John Thomp&s;on</HI> <Q>term'd the late Revival of God's Work a new-fangled Stir about Religion; as al&s;o a &s;piritual Frenzy?</Q> And have not the Authors of the Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>The Wandering Spirit;</HI> expre&s;&s;ed great Bitterne&s;s again&s;t it? We have Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome of our prote&s;ting Bre|thren to be guilty of Forming that malignant Satyr: And are there not &s;ome &s;hrewd Strokes of this kind in the <HI>Sixth</HI> Rea&s;on of the Prote&s;t, which we are now con&s;idering?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004820_0012_100DF7D76760EAD8">
We are &s;orry that our prote&s;ting Brethren have, by their Speeches and Conduct, given us &s;uch Rea&s;on to be|lieve them to be Oppo&s;ers of God's Work.</P>
<P>As to what is &s;aid in the Conclu&s;ion of the pre&s;ent Argument, <HI>namely,</HI> <Q>that &s;ince their Congregations have been &s;hatter'd and divided, few or none of them can &s;ay that they have that Comfort or Succe&s;s among their People which they enjoyed before.</Q> As to Com|fort, we believe them; but re&s;pecting Succe&s;s, we thought it had been the &s;ame as formerly; for, truly, this is the fir&s;t time that ever we have heard of the Succe&s;s of mo&s;t of them. The</P>
<P><HI>Fifth</HI> Rea&s;on of the Prote&s;t, is, that <Q>we (as they &s;ay) indu&s;triou&s;ly per&s;uade People to believe, that the Call of God whereby he calls Men to the Mini&s;try does not con&s;i&s;t in their being regularly ordained, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but in &s;ome invi&s;ible Motions and Workings of the Spirit: And that the Go&s;pel preached in Truth by unconverted Mini&s;ters, can be of no &s;aving Benefit to Souls.</Q> In an&s;wer to the afore&s;aid Charge, we de|clare our Opinion as follows, <HI>namely,</HI> we believe that there is a Nece&s;&s;ity of previous Tryals and Ordination in order to the Mini&s;try; and that &s;uch who are regu|larly &s;et apart, being &s;ound in Doctrine, and blamele&s;s in Life. however their inward State may be, are true Mini&s;ters in the Sight of the Church, and that their Mini&s;trations are valid. But in the mean time, we think that none &s;hould undertake the mini&s;terial Work but tho&s;e that are truly gracious; tho&s;e that intend therein chiefly the Glory of God and Good of Man|kind; tho&s;e that are inclined of God thereto: For we know not how a gracele&s;s Man can be faithful in the Mini&s;try. Now, whether tho&s;e inward, pious Di&s;po|&s;itions afore&s;aid be termed the inward Call of God to the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, or only Qualifications nece&s;&s;ary or pre-requi&s;ite in the Per&s;ons whom God calls, it &s;eems to be the &s;ame in Sub&s;tance.

We challenge our Opponents to prove their invidious Charge again&s;t the greater Part of tho&s;e whom they have rejected: If any one of our Number has been guilty of Indi&s;cretion at any time in his Man|ner of Addre&s;s to the People, we will not pretend to
<PB N="25" REF="004820_0013_100DF7D90B43AEA8">ju&s;tify it; but to charge the Whole with this Fault, is unju&s;t.</P>
<P>We know not that we u&s;e any Dialect in inculcating the Terrors of the Law, but what accords with Scrip|ture and Rea&s;on; or that we endeavour to excite the lower Pa&s;&s;ions, but after the Information of the Un|der&s;tanding, and that by &s;criptural Incentives: Which is &s;o far from being &s;editious, that it is the Duty of every Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter. We are bid to cry aloud and not to &s;pare; to &s;hew to <HI>Judah</HI> her Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Jacob</HI> her Sins. <HI>Knowing the Terrors of the Lord, we</HI> mu&s;t <HI>per&s;uade Men.</HI> If we &s;peak &s;mooth Things, or plea&s;e Men, we are not the Mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>If any one among us has boa&s;ted of People's falling into Convul&s;ion-like-Fits as the Work of God, as our Opponents &s;ugge&s;t, I think it is a culpable Weakne&s;s in the Per&s;on guilty of it. It is, doubtle&s;s, the Duty of People to labour to keep their Pa&s;&s;ions within due Bounds, e&s;pecially in publick A&s;&s;emblies, le&s;t they in|terupt their own and others Edification.</P>
<P>I know of none among the rejected Brethren who look upon the afore&s;aid Convul&s;ion-like-Fits to be a &s;ufficient Evidence of the Work of God.</P>
<P>We only judge &s;uch Appearances to be probable In|dications of Concern of Mind, which when it i&s;&s;ues in a Clo&s;ure with Chri&s;t by Faith, a Communion with him by Love, and Conformity to him in humble Holine&s;s; we believe it to be a &s;pecial Work of God's Grace: But even before it has tho&s;e Effects, while Sinners are only bewailing Sin, chiefly thro' Fear of divine Wrath, we think we have Rea&s;on to hope that it is a common Work of that Holy Spirit, whom Chri&s;t has promi&s;ed, to convince of Sin, in order to Conver&s;ion and Con|&s;olation.</P>
<P>And altho' &s;ome under Conviction of Sin, &s;hould be overcome by an Exce&s;s of Sorrow or Fear, we think
<PB N="26" REF="004820_0014_100DF7DB4F7A3820">that a milder Con&s;truction might be put upon this, than to a&s;cribe it to the Devil.</P>
<P>In the mean time it may be ob&s;erved, that there are but a few that are overcome as afore&s;aid, in Compari&s;on of the Multitudes that are convinced.</P>
<P>It may be prov'd, by many Witne&s;&s;es, that &s;everal Times when the Truths of God have been preach'd in the milde&s;t Go&s;pel-Strains, that many Per&s;ons have been overcome with Love, Joy or Sorrow.</P>
<P>What wor&s;e Repre&s;entation of the Work of God, now Spreading in the World, could be expected from a profe&s;&s;ed Enemy of all Religion, than we have from our Brethren? Is it not doleful to &s;ee Religion thus wounded in the Hou&s;e of its profe&s;&s;ed Friends?</P>
<P>Do they not manife&s;tly make u&s;e of an uncommon Circum&s;tance to blacken the whole Work?</P>
<P>But while our prote&s;ting Brethren were expre&s;&s;ing warm Re&s;entments again&s;t the Work of God, under the plau&s;ible Umbrage of a &s;eemingly exceptionable In|cident; methinks they &s;hould have taken &s;ome Care to avoid horrid Reflecting again&s;t the &s;acred Scriptures, and even again&s;t God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When they &s;ay we preach the Terrors of the Law in &s;uch a Dialect as hath no Precedent in the Word of God, but rather appears to be borrow'd from a wor&s;e Dialect: Does not this, comparative <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e the po&s;itive <HI>bad?</HI> So that the Meaning of the Sentence is this; The Scripture contains a bad Dialect, but they have cho&s;en wor&s;e. And when they &s;peak of our Boa&s;ting of People's Out-cries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the Work of God; which (&s;ay they) we are per&s;uaded do proceed from an inferior or <HI>wor&s;e Cau&s;e;</HI> Does not this &s;uppo&s;e God him&s;elf to be a bad Cau&s;e, in their Apprehen&s;ion? But hoping that this was only a Slip of their Pen, I therefore pa&s;s it by without any farther Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t they not be &s;tone-blind that do not &s;ee, that there be all the Evidences of a Work of GOD now
<PB N="27" REF="004820_0014_100DF7DB4F7A3820">among us, that can rea&s;onably be de&s;ired? Are not the Ignorant enlightned, the Secure made &s;olicitous about their Salvation, the Profane reformed, many Formali&s;ts &s;haken off their fal&s;e Foundations, and brought to ex|perimental Chri&s;tianity? Have we not all needful Evidence from their Speech and Practice, that the pre|vailing Temper of many Men's Minds is turn'd into a holy, humble and heavenly Channel?</P>
<P>Divers Oppo&s;ers of God's Work in &s;everal Places of this Land, have been lately &s;truck to the Heart, and made to acknowledge their Wickedne&s;s in the mo&s;t publick Manner.</P>
<P>Some aged Per&s;ons, &s;ome middle-aged, Multitudes of young People in the Bloom of Life, as well as many little Children, have been brought to experience deep Sorrow for Sin, and the Sweets of a Saviour's Love. Of young People turn'd from Sin in its Strength, we may &s;ay, as in another Ca&s;e, <HI>Thou Sea, wherefore fled|de&s;t thou? and thou</HI> Jordan, <HI>why wa&s;t thou driven back?</HI> Shall any dare to reproach the Work of GOD, while <HI>out of the Mouths of Babes he is ordaining Strength?</HI></P>
<P>Yea, divers Negroes, and Indians, have been of late, to all Appearance, effectually wrought upon. Several Places in this Continent, are at this Time joining Hand in Hand, in &s;eeking of the LORD; they are &s;etting their Faces Zion-ward, and weeping as they go.</P>
<P>And have not Per&s;ons of almo&s;t all Denominations been wrought upon by the Word as afore&s;aid? Do they not unite to give Te&s;timony to God's Work, and celebrate his Prai&s;e? Herein <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Ephraim</HI> have harmonized. What can be de&s;ired more to prove it to be the Work of the Eternal GOD?</P>
<P>If it be objected, that many of tho&s;e who are &s;aid to be under good Impre&s;&s;ions, are guilty of ra&s;h Judging. <HI>A.</HI> I can't think it ra&s;h Judging to believe tho&s;e to be gracele&s;s, who, in the mid&s;t of Means of Conviction,
<PB N="28" REF="004820_0015_100DF7DCDD3ECD18">do habitually oppo&s;e the Work of God, under the Co|vert of &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed or real Indi&s;cretions.</P>
<P>A <HI>&s;eventh</HI> Rea&s;on of the Prote&s;t, is <Q>our preaching and maintaining (as they &s;ay) that all true Converts are as certain of their gracious State, as a Per&s;on is of what he knows by his outward Sen&s;es; and are able to give a Narrative of the Time and Manner of their Conver&s;ion, or el&s;e we conclude them to be in a gracele&s;s State; and that a gracious Per&s;on can judge of others gracious State otherwi&s;e than by his Profe&s;|&s;ion and Life, &mdash; that People are under no &s;acred Tye to Pa&s;tors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Our Judgment as to the afore&s;aid Particulars, is this, <HI>namely,</HI> That gracious Per&s;ons may attain a full A&s;&s;urance of their good State, and &s;ome of them do attain it; but we do not believe that all arrive thereto in this Life; and tho&s;e that do, may, no doubt, lo&s;e it again, and get under Clouds and Darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>But in the mean time we think, that all who are converted, ordinarily have a le&s;&s;er or greater Degree of comfortable Per&s;wa&s;ion of their gracious State, either immediately upon their Clo&s;ure with Chri&s;t, or &s;ome Time afterwards, when Faith is in Exerci&s;e, either for a &s;horter or longer Duration. Surely, tho&s;e that are rightly humbled by the Spirit of God, will not be &s;atis|fied 'til they obtain this.</P>
<P>And altho' tho&s;e that are converted in adult Age, can generally remember the Time and Means of their Conviction, and give a &s;atisfactory Account of their Experiences to tho&s;e who are proper Judges of &s;uch Things; yet the Ca&s;e, we &s;uppo&s;e, is &s;omewhat diffe|rent with tho&s;e who are converted in Infancy and Childhood; yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that even &s;ome Children pa&s;s under con&s;iderable Convictions. I know of none of our rejected Brethren, that do or ever did believe it to be ju&s;t or proper, to judge any to be in a
<PB N="29" REF="004820_0015_100DF7DCDD3ECD18">natural or gracele&s;s State, meerly becau&s;e they could not tell the Time of their Conver&s;ion; if they have Evi|dences of the Thing, it is enough.</P>
<P>We know of no Way of Judging re&s;pecting the gracious State of others, but by their Doctrines, Expe|riences, and Practice.</P>
<P>No doubt there is a Relation between a Pa&s;tor and his People; but the De&s;ign of this being to promote their Good, we think it unrea&s;onable that it &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t to the Prejudice of that, which it's de&s;igned to procure. However, in ordinary Ca&s;es, we think it to be the People's Duty, to make regular Application to their Pa&s;tors, for Liberty to go where they get the greate&s;t Benefit.</P>
<P>But when Mini&s;ters con&s;pire to oppo&s;e the Work and faithful Servants of God, in the mo&s;t open and flagrant Manner, we &s;ee no Harm in this Ca&s;e, in u&s;ing an ex|traordinary Method.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e, and many other Rea&s;ons, our Brethren do in a mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner prote&s;t, that we have no Right to &s;it with them in Judicatories: The Rea&s;ons they have mentioned we have con&s;idered, and leave it to the Reader to determine, whether they are &s;ufficient to procure our Exclu&s;ion; but as to the re&s;t, we know them not; however thro' Mercy we are not afraid of &s;eeing the Bottom of their Budget. We hope, and pray, that they would bring forth all their Strength, in their Reply to this; for we de&s;ign no more but another An&s;wer. We have got &s;omething el&s;e to do, which is more de&s;ireable than Controver&s;y. We only want the State of the Ca&s;e to be fairly open'd; and then, I hope, we &s;hall be ea&s;y about the Judgment of the World, re|&s;pecting our Conduct. But to return.</P>
<P>From the afore&s;aid Particulars our prote&s;ting Breth|ren rea&s;on for the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Rupture.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="004820_0016_100DF7E038FFF310">
But having before con&s;idered the Grounds upon which our Brethren's Rea&s;onings are built, I think it needle&s;s to &s;peak to them &s;eparately; for they can be but &s;uch as their Foundation is, and mu&s;t needs &s;tand or fall with it.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Rea&s;onings, our Brethren profe&s;s them|&s;elves to be re&s;olvedly again&s;t the Principles and Practice of Anarchy and Schi&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Whatever they profe&s;s, I think they are guilty of both, in their Prote&s;t, <HI>namely,</HI> 1. In laying down this as a Principle, that there mu&s;t be a complete Uni|formity to all the Synod's Rules, or Canons, upon Pain of Exclu&s;ion. See the 2d Rea&s;on of Prote&s;t. And 2. their ca&s;ting us out of Communion for our con&s;cientious Non-conformity to their un&s;criptural Canon. Does not the fir&s;t of the&s;e Particulars, becau&s;e of the varying Opinions of Men, according to the ordinary Cour&s;e of Things, open a dreadful Nece&s;&s;ity of continual Confu|&s;ions in the Church of God, or el&s;e of implicit Faith and blind Obedience to prevent the &s;ame? And pray, is not the Remedy wor&s;e than the Di&s;ea&s;e?</P>
<P>We are &s;orry that our prote&s;ting Brethren have given us Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect them, of being guilty of verging towards the Doctrine of implicit Faith and blind Obe|dience; this appears from their finding Fault with us (in their Prote&s;t) for not obeying the Rules, in the making of which we are in the Negative.</P>
<P>Here we mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed from Concurring in Sentiment with our Brethren: We are re&s;olved, by the Grace of God, that no gingle or cant of Order and Government &s;hall gull us out of our Rea&s;on and Con|&s;cience, or rob us of our Priviledges, as Men, as Chri&s;|tians, as Prote&s;tants, and as Pre&s;byterians: We declare our utter Abhorrence of all &s;uch Pretence to Power in Churches, as is built upon the Ruins of human Nature.</P>
<P>We cannot but join with our prote&s;ting Brethren, how|ever, in their Prayer, that God may ari&s;e, and that his
<PB N="31" REF="004820_0016_100DF7E038FFF310">Enemies may be &s;cattered, and that tho&s;e who hate him may fly before him. But, I think, their Application of it to us, &s;hews them to be guilty of that ra&s;h Judging which they would charge upon us, <HI>Turpe e&s;t Doct.&mdash; quod tibi fieri non vis,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Our prote&s;ting Brethren farther ob&s;erve, <Q>That to give Way to the pulling down of the Hedge of Di&s;cipline, is far from being the Method of cau&s;ing his tender Plants to grow.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> If &s;o, then why are they guilty of it, by their un&s;criptural Impo&s;itions upon, and ra&s;h Separation from their Brethren, in &s;uch a Manner as is, for what I know, without all Precedent?</P>
<P>Particular Rules of Churches, are only &s;o far to be valued and obeyed, as they &s;erve to an&s;wer their &s;uppo&s;ed De&s;ign, <HI>namely,</HI> the Edification of the Body of Chri&s;t. To &s;ay that we &s;hould regard and obey them when the Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e, is to &s;ay, that we ought to e&s;teem and promote the Injury of Chri&s;t's Kingdom; which is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Our prote&s;ting Brethren &s;ay, that they doubt not but that when God &s;ees us humbled for our Sins, he will return again in Mercy. No doubt we have at all. Times Rea&s;on to humble our&s;elves before God: But if they be not blinded with Prejudice, or otherwi&s;e, they may &s;ee Rea&s;on now to rejoice, that God has returned to his Church in Mercy.</P>
<P>Once more: Our prote&s;ting Brethren think that their Prote&s;t, which they call their Te&s;timony, may be of u&s;e to their Children yet unborn. It may &s;o, for what we know, in &s;hewing them their Fathers Oppo|&s;ition to the Work of God, and &s;chi&s;matical Separation from their Brethren.</P>
<P>But tho' we are called to &s;peak plainly, yet we wi&s;h our prote&s;ting Brethren all needful Mercies from the Bottom of our Hearts.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS UPON THE APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Narrative our Brethren give of what happened after the Prote&s;t was &s;igned, is a &s;trange Mi&s;re|pre&s;entation of the Affair.</P>
<P><Q>After the Prote&s;t was entered and &s;ub&s;cribed (&s;ay our Opponents) the <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> Party in&s;i&s;ted that a great Number of us, who are now the Synod, &s;hould be ca&s;t out of Member&s;hip; for (&s;ay they) there were &s;everal Brethren, who did not &s;ign this Prote&s;t, who were not of the Number we prote&s;ted again&s;t, and they concluded that all the&s;e Members would join with them, and they were exact in Counting of the Roll, and found that when they had counted all &s;uch with them&s;elves, they could not make the Majority: But &s;ome of the Members, who did not &s;ign this Pro|te&s;t, &s;oon convinced them, that they would not be of their Party; And upon this, they thought it expedient to withdraw.</Q></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI>-Party's (as they are plea&s;ed to call us) in&s;i&s;ting that they &s;hould be ca&s;t out of the Synod, it is what I know nothing of; &s;uch a Thought did not enter into my Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="004820_0017_100DF7E1EFF64E18">
But how can our Brethren a&s;&s;ert, what it was not po&s;&s;ible for them at that Time to know, without our Declaration, which they had not? <HI>namely,</HI> That we concluded that all the&s;e Members, who had not &s;igned their Prote&s;t, would join with us? What we concluded upon, was this, That tho&s;e who had not &s;igned the Prote&s;t, had not rejected us; and therefore were &s;o far upon our Side of the Que&s;tion, that they could join with us in Judicatories.</P>
<P>Our Brethren call them&s;elves a great Number; the Truth is, there was but a &s;mall Difference between them and us as to Number, which will appear thus; The Per&s;ons they prote&s;ted again&s;t, were the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

The Two fir&s;t of tho&s;e la&s;t mentioned, &s;eemed in|clinable to join with us; which put us on a Par as to Number with our Opponents: And Mr. <HI>M" Henery</HI> was al&s;o di&s;&s;atisfy'd with the Prote&s;t. But the Number of the Elders, on each Side of the Que&s;tion, I cannot tell; not having the Synod's Minutes by me.</P>
<P>It is evident from what has been &s;aid, that there was a Majority of Non-prote&s;ting Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Our prote&s;ting Brethren a&s;&s;ert, that they are the Synod; but I think it is ea&s;ier for them to a&s;&s;ert, than prove it. Does not their offering a Prote&s;t before the Synod, &s;ignify, that the Synod were a Number di&s;tinct from them, in their own Judgment? For it &s;eems unrea&s;onable for a Number of Men, to offer a Prote&s;t to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is alledg'd by our prote&s;ting Brethren, <Q>That when &s;ome who did not &s;ign the Prote&s;t, convinced us, that they would not be of our Party; that upon this, we thought it expedient to withdraw.</Q> This is a gro&s;s Mi&s;take; for &s;ome of the Non-prote&s;ting Members convinced us of no &s;uch Thing. Neither was any Thing like this, the Occa&s;ion of our Withdrawing; we &s;tay'd 'till the Moderator commanded Silence.</P>
<P>Our prote&s;ting Brethren &s;ay, <Q>That our Withdraw|ing put the Hou&s;e into a little Confu&s;ion.</Q> Here is another &s;trange Mi&s;repre&s;entation; for the Confu&s;ion the Hou&s;e was in, was neither after, nor occa&s;ioned by our Withdrawing; it was before we came away, and was occa&s;ioned by the Reading and Signing of the Pro|te&s;t; we did not come away 'til our prote&s;ting Brethren came with us; and that was after the Se&s;&s;ion was con|cluded, with Prayer, as u&s;ual.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="004820_0018_100DF7E457BBAF00">
The Roll indeed was counted, but not with the View mention'd by our Opponents, but to &s;ee whether in re&s;pect of Number, our prote&s;ting Brethren could ca&s;t us out, according to the Tenor of their Prote&s;t.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Reading and ha&s;ty Signing of the Prote&s;t, put the A&s;&s;embly into Di&s;order; we were &s;urprized with the extraordinary Method of Proceeding, and knew not well what to do; we were loath to be ca&s;t out &s;o ha&s;tily, without &s;peaking any Thing in our own Defence; but our Attempts to &s;peak were repul&s;ed, the Hou&s;e being confus'd, one &s;poke one Thing, and another another, and &s;ometimes two or more at once; &s;o that it's hard to tell what was &s;aid. Mr. <HI>Blair,</HI> I re|member, offer'd more than once, to read a Paper; but the Motion was rejected, and Silence enjoin'd by the Mo|derator; and thus the A&s;&s;embly, after Prayer, broke up.</P>
<P>No doubt Societies have a Right to judge of the Qua|lifications of their own Members, and to reject &s;uch as render them&s;elves unworthy of their Communion. But according to the Laws of Nature, of Nations, and of God, they &s;hould be fir&s;t heard in their own Defence, before they are condemned and rejected.</P>
<P>Our Brethren have their Liberty to prove all they can again&s;t us; and we have little Rea&s;on to doubt their Inclinations that Way. But if they will keep to the Rules of Truth and Ju&s;tice, we fear not their Alle|gations.</P>
<P>Their &s;aying, that it was only want of an Opportu|nity, and not of a willing Mind, that prevented us from turning of them out, is uncharitable and &s;evere; if we had had &s;uch a De&s;ire to &s;eparate, as our Brethren &s;ugge&s;t, we might have ea&s;ily done it long agone.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="004820_0019_100DF7E60C787588">
But fora&s;much as a Hi&s;torical Narrative of the whole Affair of Debate, will in a little Time be expo&s;ed to publick Light, I will add no more at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>May the gracious GOD grant that the&s;e Contentions may i&s;&s;ue in <HI>Zion</HI>'s Pro&s;perity. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>_WE hope we may, without Boa&s;ting or Offence, ob&s;erve, that, &s;o far as we know our own Hearts, we do not only, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, de|&s;ire the Pro&s;perity, but Peace of <HI>Zion;</HI> and that we are heartily willing to pur&s;ue all &s;criptural and rational Mea&s;ures to compa&s;s and pre&s;erve both: And therefore the late cloudy Appearances of Unea&s;ine&s;s and Debate among our&s;elves in this infant Church have been peculiarly afflictive to us; not &s;o much, we tru&s;t, for the Fears of any per&s;onal Prejudice that our Debates with you may po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion to us, as of the Reproach and Di&s;advantage that may probably i&s;&s;ue therefrom if increa&s;ed and brought to a fatal Period upon the Ho|nours and Intere&s;ts of Religion in general.</P>
<P>However, we cannot think, that for the Sake of Peace we &s;hould &s;acrifice the Intere&s;t of what we ap|prehend to be Truth and Ju&s;tice, and cro&s;s the Dictates of our own Con&s;ciences: No, we rather concur in Sentiments upon this Head with <HI>Luther,</HI> who ju&s;tly
<PB N="40" REF="004820_0021_100DF7EAE06DD588">ob&s;erved, <HI>That an honourable and nece&s;&s;ary War was pre|ferable to a mean and ignoble Peace. Potius coelum &amp; terra ruerent,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>We charitably hope, that a Number, at lea&s;t, of the late Synod de&s;igned the Advancement of Chri&s;t's King|dom by their Conclu&s;ion: But we are &s;orry that there is &s;o great a Difference among us in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of Ex|pedients to an&s;wer the afore&s;aid truly valuable De&s;ign.</P>
<P>We crave leave to inform and a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>Moderator, and Reverend Brethren,</HI> that it was not from any Di&s;|regard to your Per&s;ons, or ju&s;t Authority, that we &s;o warmly oppo&s;ed the late religious Acts or Laws you have been plea&s;ed to form; but from a Principle of Con&s;cience, influenced by Scripture and Arguments; which we now beg Liberty of propo&s;ing to your far|ther Con&s;ideration, in the following Order:</P>
<P>The Tenor of the fir&s;t Act we di&s;&s;ented from, is, that approv'd Mini&s;ters and Members of this Synod are thereby debarred from Preaching in any Vacancy which is in the Bounds of another Pre&s;bytery, when any Mi|ni&s;ter of that Pre&s;bytery informs them that he thinks their Preaching will cau&s;e Divi&s;ions and Di&s;orders; un|til that Matter be try'd by the Pre&s;bytery where the Vacancy is; or until he obtains Liberty from the Synod.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the afore&s;aid Law, we offer the following Objections, <HI>viz.</HI> That we cannot find any Foundation for it in the Holy Scriptures. It was judged, by a Ma|jority of the Synod, that it was a &s;uitable Expedient to pre&s;erve Peace and Order in Congregations; and this is the only Rea&s;on propo&s;ed why it is enacted, without ever once pretending any particular Order or Direction from God about it; and yet it is enacted with as great Appearance of Authority, and made as univer&s;ally Bind|ing upon all the Members of this Synod, altho' a Num|ber thereof did oppo&s;e it in its Embryo, as if it had a <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord</HI> expre&s;ly for its Foundation. If it
<PB N="41" REF="004820_0021_100DF7EAE06DD588">can be made appear from the Holy Scriptures that the the King of <HI>Zion</HI> hath appointed this Act, or the Mat|ter therein contained, in his Word; we hope that there is none in this Synod that would be more careful to ob|&s;erve it than our&s;elves; and that from a Regard to the Authority of GOD, and not of Men.</P>
<P>But on the Contrary, we humbly conceive, that the afore&s;aid Act oppo&s;es the expre&s;s Command of God, which obliges Mini&s;ters to <HI>be con&s;tant in Sea&s;on, and out of Sea&s;on,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. It bereaves both Mini&s;ters and People of the Privileges Chri&s;t has given them; and re|&s;trains them from the Performance of commanded Du|ty for the time being. The Exerci&s;e of the Mini&s;ter's Office, when he is regularly called to preach by the united Voice of Providence and of the Chri&s;tian People, is &s;u&s;pended for a Time by one Man; and that not for any real Fault already committed, or &s;o much as alledged; but upon Su&s;picion that &s;ome bad Con&s;equences will follow upon his Preaching in &s;uch a Place. And, in con&s;equence hereof, the People are debarred from do|ing a po&s;itive Duty of high Importance and Con|cern in Chri&s;tianity, <HI>viz.</HI> Hearing an approved Mini|&s;ter of Chri&s;t when they have convenient Opportunity. Here is &s;omething that is very extraordinary indeed; every Mini&s;ter in the Bounds of the Synod, that is in|clined to be uncharitable to his Brethren, is by the Act afore&s;aid ve&s;ted with a Power (in this In&s;tance &s;omething more than prelatical) to lord it over his Brethren, and inflict upon them one of the mo&s;t grie|vious Church-Cen&s;ures; and that without any Pretence of Fault committed. We cannot think that Unchari|tablene&s;s gives any ju&s;t Claims to &s;uperior Powers or Pretence; and therefore to encourage &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition which is &s;o evil in its Nature and fatal in its Effects, in an Age in which it &s;o much abounds, to the great Reproach of Chri&s;tianity, is, in our humble Opinion, as unrea|&s;onable and prejudicial as it is unequal. If it be con|trary
<PB N="42" REF="004820_0022_100DF7ECB9E48A98">to the Laws of Nature, of Nations, and of God, to condemn Men (altho' &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected to be guilty of Crimes that de&s;erve it) before they be heard in their own Defence; how much more &s;o mu&s;t it be to puni&s;h actually and grievou&s;ly without the lea&s;t Pretence of Fault committed? That an approved Mini&s;ter's &s;tated Preaching in one Pre&s;bytery &s;hould be &s;afe, and his oc|ca&s;ional in another, &s;hould be dangerous, is a Riddle to us which we profe&s;s we cannot &s;ee through. If a Mi|ni&s;ter preaches &s;ound Doctrine, why &s;hould it be deem'd dangerous in or un&s;uitable to any Place? If not, why is he approved or &s;uffered to preach in any? Are not Souls equally precious in all Places? and therefore ought not the Synod's Care be equally extended to all within their Bounds? Will not the &s;ame Go&s;pel &s;erve the whole Synod? And if any preach another, why are they received by that Judicatory, and &s;uffered to preach in any of her Territories? If not, why are they hin|dered from Preaching occa&s;ionally and tran&s;iently which are invited regularly?</P>
<P>What is offer'd, as the Rea&s;on of the afore&s;aid Su&s;|pen&s;ion, rather &s;erves to condemn than ju&s;tify the Synod's new Law, in our humble Opinion, <HI>namely,</HI> the Su&s;picion that one Mini&s;ter hath, that his Brother's Preaching in &s;uch a Vacancy will cau&s;e Divi&s;ions and Di&s;orders: For hereby the Synod &s;o far approves of the uncharitable Su&s;picions of her Members of one another's Performances, which is a great Sin in it&s;elf, as to make it a &s;ufficient Foundation or Warrant for their committing another, <HI>viz.</HI> their cen&s;uring their Breth|ren, and bereaving them of the Privileges which the King of the Church has expre&s;sly and de&s;ignedly given them, and that before they hear them. And therefore, ina&s;much as this Canon gives Licen&s;e to do Evil that Good may come; we think it plainly contradicts the expre&s;s Word of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 8:</P>
<P>We beg Leave farther to ob&s;erve, that we cannot
<PB N="43" REF="004820_0022_100DF7ECB9E48A98">well reconcile the&s;e two Things in the Synod's Conduct in relation to the afore&s;aid Law, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Synod approves of all her Members, and yet in the mean time encourages them to &s;u&s;pect each other, and puni&s;h upon Su&s;picion. Now, &s;eeing Ju&s;tice and Charity are the Springs and Principles of Peace and Order; what is contrary thereto, mu&s;t have a direct Tendency to de&s;troy both. Of this Kind we take the afore&s;aid Law to be, for the Rea&s;ons before and after-mentioned; and there|fore this Canon contradicts the profe&s;&s;ed De&s;ign thereof; in&s;tead of preventing Divi&s;ions and Di&s;orders, it pro|cures them; and &s;o oppo&s;es all tho&s;e Scriptures that e&s;tabli&s;h the contrary.</P>
<P>The afore&s;aid Law gives Liberty to cen&s;ure a Brother upon meer Conjecture. For, what other Knowledge can any of us have of future contingent Events, unle&s;s any Members of the Synod have the Spirit of Prophe&s;y, which we do not think they will pretend to? But &s;up|po&s;ing they had the afore&s;aid Branch of the Apo&s;tolick Character, we &s;ee not how they could puni&s;h their Brethren for an Event, before it came to pa&s;s, an Event which might come to pa&s;s without their being any ways culpably acce&s;&s;ory thereto.</P>
<P>This therefore leads us to ob&s;erve, that the Rea&s;on annexed to the afore&s;aid Law, is expre&s;&s;ed in ambiguous Terms, Divi&s;ions, Di&s;orders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which, as they follow upon Preaching, may be taken in a good or bad Sen&s;e: If the&s;e Words be taken in a bad Sen&s;e, for &s;inful Divi|&s;ions properly cau&s;ed by Preaching; then certainly it is &s;inful Preaching, that procures them. Sinful Divi&s;ions can never be the proper Fruits of Go&s;pel-Truths; to &s;ay otherwi&s;e, is to pour Contempt upon the glorious Go&s;pel. If &s;o, then it is unrea&s;onable to hinder the Preaching of Truth in any of our Borders, in order to prevent Divi&s;ions. And Truth, we are by the Law of Charity obliged to hope, will be preach'd by our approved Brethren, until we have good Rea&s;on to the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="004820_0023_100DF7EF5BF17CF8">
Can any Member of one Pre&s;bytery, know certainly before-hand, that a Member of another will preach fal&s;e Doctrine in any of their Vacancies, more than one of their own Pre&s;bytery? If not, then he may with equal Rea&s;on hinder the Brethren of his own Pre&s;bytery from preaching in &s;uch Vacancies; and &s;o they &s;hall never be &s;upplied; for, another may hinder him by the &s;ame Rule: If yea, then we a&s;k how this can be without a Claim to Infallibility or immediate Revelation?</P>
<P>If a Fear of our Brother's preaching fal&s;e Doctrine, meerly becau&s;e he is fallible, will ju&s;tify his being &s;u&s;|pended from preaching for a Time, before he has preach'd it; then we query, if this, followed in its ju&s;t and natural Con&s;equences, will not &s;ilence this Synod and all the World with them? This Method of pre|venting the Preaching of fal&s;e Doctrine, is, we confe&s;s, effectual to an&s;wer the End de&s;igned: But then it con|cludes or infers rather more than we &s;uppo&s;e the Synod will allow of; for it de&s;troys all Preaching entirely, except by in&s;pired Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But if there are other &s;ufficient Foundations for the afore&s;aid Fear; then why are not the &s;criptural Methods of private Reproof, and publick Charge, before his pro|per Judicatory pur&s;ued? If there are not &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons; then why is the afore&s;aid Fear followed, and made the Foundation of Cen&s;ure; &s;eeing it is un|rea&s;onable?</P>
<P>But if the afore&s;aid Terms are taken in a good Sen&s;e for the&s;e Di&s;turbances which the powerful Preaching of the Go&s;pel only occa&s;ions, in which re&s;pect our Saviour ob&s;erves, That <HI>he came not to &s;end Peace on Earth, but a Sword, to &s;et a Man at Variance with his Father,</HI> &amp;c. (See <HI>Matth.</HI> 10. 34&mdash;36.) and that <HI>while the &s;trong Man armed keeps the Hou&s;e, all the Goods are in Peace;</HI> &mdash; Then is the afore&s;aid Law very extraordinary and un|accountable indeed: For, wherever the Go&s;pel becomes the Wi&s;dom and Power of God, to the Conver&s;ion of
<PB N="45" REF="004820_0023_100DF7EF5BF17CF8">Souls, there it is generally oppos'd by the Devil and his Emi&s;&s;aries: The&s;e that are converted, do ordinarily endeavour to convince others of their &s;ecure Neighbours of their Danger and Mi&s;ery (which is but their Duty;) this is apt to provoke the Children of <HI>Belial</HI> to reproach the People of God; and in the Choice of a Mini&s;ter, the&s;e Per&s;ons who have a better Knowledge and Savour of true Religion, may be al&s;o very cautious; which is al&s;o their Duty: Hence Divi&s;ions and Di&s;orders may en&s;ue. Now, if this Oppo&s;ition of <HI>Satan</HI> and his Seed again&s;t the Power of the Go&s;pel, be the Divi&s;ions in|tended, and Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be debarr'd from preaching in particular Places, le&s;t the Devil's Kingdom &s;hould be di&s;turbed, and <HI>Satan</HI> him&s;elf vexed or drove out of Places where GOD has &s;ealed their Labours for the &s;ame Rea&s;on; Then the Law we plead again&s;t, is mo&s;t iniquous. But we charitably hope, that it did not appear to our Rev. Brethren, who pa&s;&s;ed it in this Light; and that they were inadvertently led into a Con&s;ent to the afore&s;aid Act, by the heavy Complaints and frightful undi&s;tingui&s;hed Terms of Divi&s;ions and Di&s;orders: And we are per&s;waded, that now they will join with us in oppo&s;ing this unequal Act, when the Divi&s;ions and Di&s;orders pointed at in it, come to be particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed and &s;pecified by their pro|per Cau&s;es and remote Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>But whatever favourable Sentiments Charity obliges us to entertain of the Intentions of the Formers of the afore&s;aid Act; yet we mu&s;t in the mean time ob&s;erve, that the Ambiguity of its Terms, gives Room for the afore&s;aid terrible Effects.</P>
<P>Suffer us, <HI>Reverend Gentlemen,</HI> again to ob&s;erve, that we think it hard and highly injurious, that a Mini&s;ter approved of by the Synod, when he is warned, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t forbear the Exerci&s;e of his Office in any Vacancy of another Pre&s;bytery, where he is providentially call'd; and if he would clear up his clouded Character, or
<PB N="46" REF="004820_0024_100DF7F1B0EB7FA0">an&s;wer the ju&s;t Reque&s;t of the People, he mu&s;t wait in his Travels far from Home, till a Pre&s;bytery meets, not that which he properly belongs to; and he hears their Deci&s;ions about his Brethren's Su&s;picions, or el&s;e their prophetical Determinations about what is not yet come to pa&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether his preaching in &s;uch a Place, will be attended with Divi&s;ions; yea or not. We hope you will not be offended, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> when we a&s;&s;ure you, that our feeble Powers are perfectly puzzled and non|plus'd, when we would labour to &s;ound the my&s;terious Depths of this Act in all its Parts; but thus far we think we may &s;afely &s;ay, That according to the Notions we have of it, its general Scope and Tendency &s;eems to be to di&s;courage utterly all occa&s;ional Preaching out of the Bounds of the Pre&s;bytery we live in, and to &s;ubject the Exerci&s;e of the mini&s;terial Office to the capricious Humours of uncharitable, ill-natur'd Brethren.</P>
<P>We thought indeed, that when Mini&s;ters were or|dained, they had a Right to preach Chri&s;t where they were providentially called, whether it was within their Pre&s;bytery-Line, or beyond it: But now we are learned the Contrary; for by this new Law they mu&s;t have new Commi&s;&s;ions from a Pre&s;bytery or Synod, if they happen in their Travels to cro&s;s their Pre&s;bytery-Line, or meet with a cro&s;s Brother. Be&s;ides there is &s;ome|thing in this new Law imply'd, that is, in our humble Opinion, very injurious to ruling Elders and the Chri&s;|tian People, <HI>viz.</HI> That, according to it, they have no Power to invite a regular Member of another Pre&s;bytery to preach among them one Sabbath in his Travels: If any Member of their own gives Warning to the Con|trary, thus one di&s;orderly Brother is impower'd by the afore&s;aid Act, to trample upon the Rights of Mini&s;ters, Elders, and People: We call the &s;uppo&s;ed Per&s;on <HI>di&s;|orderly,</HI> becau&s;e by unrea&s;onable Jealou&s;ies he breaks the Law of Love, which obliges to hope all Things that are good of our Brethren, as far as it is rea&s;onable,
<PB N="47" REF="004820_0024_100DF7F1B0EB7FA0">and to &s;uffer long, and be kind: If his Jealou&s;ies be without &s;ufficient Ground, he is di&s;orderly; if it has &s;ufficient Grounds, he is al&s;o di&s;orderly, in taking &s;uch an un&s;criptural, yea, anti&s;criptural Method with his Brother, as this Law directs to. We cannot &s;ee any Con&s;i&s;tency between our Saviour's Law, mentioned <HI>Matth.</HI> 18. 15&mdash;18. and this of the late Synod; nor any Kindne&s;s, but rather great Cruelty, in accu&s;ing a Bro|ther before an improper Judicatory, and that when unprepared to make his Defence.</P>
<P>Once more: The afore&s;aid Act &s;eems to us, to con|tradict the generous and noble Temper of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> who re&s;olutely rejoiced that Chri&s;t was preached, tho' by &s;ome it was done thro' Envy, In&s;incerity, Strife and Contention, &s;uppo&s;ing to add Affliction to his Bonds. <HI>Phil.</HI> 1. 16, 17.</P>
<P>Neither are we able to di&s;cern the Con&s;i&s;tency of the afore&s;aid Act with the Care that Pre&s;byteries &s;hould have that their Vacancies be &s;upplied; e&s;pecially con&s;idering the Situation of Affairs in this Country is &s;uch that &s;ome Pre&s;byteries are not able, without wrong|ing their own Congregations, to &s;upply the Vacancies in their Bounds; therefore, one would think, they &s;hould be glad of Help <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant</HI> from their approved Brethren in their occa&s;ional Travels. But the Contrary of this appears by the Law under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ide|ration, which ca&s;ts un&s;criptural Hinderances in the Way of Help, and makes it extreamly precarious, and even almo&s;t impracticable. But to proceed:</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> Religious Law made by the la&s;t Synod, which we di&s;&s;ented from, is to the following Purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Pre&s;bytery has (according to it) Liberty to examine any Candidates who offer them&s;elves to to them, in order to licen&s;e or ordain them, before they be examined and approved re&s;pecting their Literature by a Committee of the Synod.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="004820_0025_100DF7F3CFC97548">
That our Rea&s;ons again&s;t the afore&s;aid Law may be &s;et in a ju&s;t Light, we beg leave to premi&s;e the three following Po&s;itions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. That there is a Parity of Equality of Power among Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, is a Truth univer&s;ally own'd by <HI>Pre&s;byterians;</HI> a Truth very evident from the Com|mi&s;&s;ion Chri&s;t gave to his Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P N="2">II. That a Pre&s;bytery, or the &s;malle&s;t A&s;&s;ociation of Mini&s;ters, have a Power from Chri&s;t to ordain, is al&s;o a Truth which the Scriptures fully vouch, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 14. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 2. A Truth which the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> have univer&s;ally maintained in their Defences, and con|formed to in their Practice: A Truth which gave ri&s;e to the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Name. He who denies the afore|&s;aid Po&s;itions over&s;ets, con&s;equently, in his Opinion, all Pre&s;byteriani&s;m both in Name and Thing, and un|churches all the reformed Churches (&s;trictly &s;o called) He who owns them, will, in our humble Opinion, be obliged, in Rea&s;on, to own a</P>
<P N="3">III. Po&s;ition nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulting from them; which is this, that Pre&s;byteries have Authority from Chri&s;t to examine all Candidates (who regularly offer them|&s;elves) re&s;pecting all Qualifications that are nece&s;&s;ary for the Mini&s;try; for this the Power of Ordination, in the Nature of the Thing, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es. If they may &s;et them apart to the mini&s;terial Work, they mu&s;t judge of their Qualifications for it, or act by im|plicit Faith in their own proper Bu&s;ine&s;s, which is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>Having offer'd the afore&s;aid Conclu&s;ions, we would rea&s;on again&s;t the afore&s;aid religious Law, which re|&s;trains the Exerci&s;e of that Power which Chri&s;t has gi|ven to Pre&s;byteries, as to the Examination of Candidates, for a time, as to &s;ome whom they may approve of, and perpetually as to others whom, perhaps, they may not approve of; in the following Manner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="49" REF="004820_0025_100DF7F3CFC97548">
I. We think that the afore&s;aid Act is an un&s;criptural Law: We cannot find any Directions in the Scriptures that Candidates for the Mini&s;try mu&s;t be examined and approved by a Committee of any Synod, before a Pre&s;|bytery takes them under Examination in order to li|cen&s;e or ordain them.</P>
<P N="2">II. We look upon it to be an uncharitable Act: It &s;eems nece&s;&s;arily to &s;uppo&s;e a Su&s;picion of the In&s;uffici|ency or Unfaithfulne&s;s of their own Members for or in the Performance of the Ta&s;k Chri&s;t has a&s;&s;igned them as its Foundation. Now, unle&s;s this Su&s;picion be plea|ded, how can any tolerable Pretence of Nece&s;&s;ity for the afore&s;aid Law be urged? And if it be, how can the Conduct of the Members of this Synod in &s;ending &s;uch into the Mini&s;try, approving them in it, and allowing them the Privileges of an a&s;&s;ociated Body or Pre&s;bytery, be ju&s;tified?</P>
<P N="3">III. We think the afore&s;aid Law is anti-&s;criptural: If the Scripture allows and injoins Pre&s;byteries to exa|mine all Students who are of good Report (that regu|larly offer them&s;elves) as has been before proved, then it is again&s;t the Scripture to impair or hinder the Exer|ci&s;e of &s;aid Power, unle&s;s the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors thereof con&s;ent thereto, or be judicially convinced of &s;uch Faults as de&s;erve &s;uch Treatment.</P>
<P>If a godly Candidate, who is &s;ufficiently qualified for the mini&s;terial Work according to the divine Pre&s;crip|tion, &s;hould &s;cruple the Lawfulne&s;s of this &s;ynodical Law, and yet offer him&s;elf to a Pre&s;bytery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they are obliged by the Law of Chri&s;t to receive him, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 2. <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 1. 4. <HI>Rom.</HI> xv. 7. But by this Law of the Synod they are obliged to reject him.</P>
<P N="4">IV. It's unju&s;t (in our Opinion) to impair a Power given by Chri&s;t to any, or to re&s;train the Exerci&s;e of it allowed by him, again&s;t the Con&s;ent of the Wills and Dictates of the Con&s;ciences of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, unle&s;s they be proved Guilty of &s;uch Crimes as de&s;erve &s;uch
<PB N="50" REF="004820_0026_100DF7F55EC37918">Penalties. To condemn and puni&s;h before any Accu&s;a|tion is offered, is an odd Way of Judging.</P>
<P>Farther, we cannot &s;ee how it can be reconciled to the Maxims of Ju&s;tice, to oblige all Candidates to &s;pend Time and Money (which &s;ome can ill &s;pare in attend|ing upon &s;ynodical Committees) when the Matter can be otherways well managed, according to the divine Direction.</P>
<P N="5">V. The afore&s;aid Law is (in our Opinion) unnece&s;|&s;ary: Why may not or cannot Pre&s;byteries try young Men now, as they have done this Twenty or Thirty Years by pa&s;t, even ever &s;ince this Synod was formed? If this Committee be &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, what a poor State mu&s;t this Church have been in, 'til the la&s;t Year! and how defective mu&s;t the Laws of Chri&s;t be, which have not a Word of this Committee in them, &s;o far as we can gather?</P>
<P N="6">VI. It is (in our E&s;teem) anti-pre&s;byterian: This Law, by taking from Pre&s;byteries their proper Bu&s;ine&s;s, and re&s;training them in the Exerci&s;e of their original Powers un&s;cripturally, tends to render them u&s;ele&s;s, and &s;o to de&s;troy them entirely, and with them that Subordination of Judicatories dependent on them, with|out which the Pre&s;byterian Government in its pre&s;ent Model cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>According to the Pre&s;byterian Con&s;titution we con|ceive, that all the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are equal one with another in all the Parts of the Pa&s;toral Office; &s;o that none have any peculiar Powers or Privileges be|yond others: And yet particular Pre&s;byteries, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch a Number of Mini&s;ters, more or le&s;s, with the Elders of their &s;everal Congregations, as can conve|niently meet together &s;o often as Occa&s;ion may require, have full and complete Power for ordering all the Affairs of the Church within their Bounds. In a Word, they have Power to execute all the Parts of Government which Chri&s;t has appointed in his Church, (which, by
<PB N="51" REF="004820_0026_100DF7F55EC37918">the Way, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with their Liablene&s;s to be brought to Account by Synods, or larger A&s;&s;emblies con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Pre&s;byteries, either for Errors in Doctrine or wrong Conduct in Practice) and con&s;e|quently they have the whole Management of the Ad|mi&s;&s;ion of Per&s;ons to the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, who may and ought to apply to them for that End. Now, certainly, this Act we oppo&s;e, is an Abridgment of the afore&s;aid Right and Privilege; for, according to it, no Pre&s;bytery mu&s;t try or licen&s;e any Candidate, until they obtain the Liberty and Approbation of tho&s;e who are con&s;tituted their Superiors in the Bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;uch as the&s;e Examinants think fit to reject; they mu&s;t by no Means admit: Whereas we can't be a&s;&s;ured but that &s;ome may have a Sufficiency of Learning and Know|ledge, of whom the&s;e Gentlemen may think otherwi&s;e. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome of them might think very meanly of a Candidate, who has, perhaps, as much u&s;eful Know|ledge and as improving Abilities as them&s;elves, if he is not &s;o well acquainted with &s;ome Metaphy&s;ical Niceties and &s;ublime critical Di&s;qui&s;itions of the Schoolmen; tho' he might probably do as much to the Defence of Go&s;pel-Truth, and the &s;aving In&s;truction of immortal Souls, as them&s;elves, notwith&s;tanding of their other Speculations: Whence it is the more nece&s;&s;ary for Pre&s;byteries to pre|&s;erve their ju&s;t Rights and Liberties in this as well as all other Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>And to make it farther appear, that this Act is an Encroachment upon them, let it be ob&s;erved, that by the &s;ame Method of Proceeding, all the Power of Pre&s;|byteries may be taken away; and &s;o our Con&s;titution of Government, in the pre&s;ent Plan thereof, entirely unhing'd: For, if the Synod can take away, at its Plea&s;ure, one Privilege and proper Bu&s;ine&s;s of Pre&s;by|teries, what hinders but that by the &s;ame Power they may take away another, and another, 'til they take away the Whole, by the &s;ame Rule that this Act is
<PB N="52" REF="004820_0027_100DF7F8CD4241B0">made? And we think, for as weighty Rea&s;ons, they might take the Licen&s;ing and Ordaining of Candidates intirely into their own Hands (it would prevent Trou|ble) and al&s;o go through Stitch with all the other Bran|ches of the Pre&s;bytery's Work, which they have an equal Right to with the former; and then we &s;hould have an End of Pre&s;byteries altogether: And indeed if the Thing be taken away, why &s;hould not the Name go with it? We profe&s;s, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> that we cannot brook meer Shams and empty Names of Things with|out the Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, we are at a Lo&s;s to conceive how it can accord with <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Parity, to &s;et a &s;maller Number over a greater, with the Power of a Negative (again&s;t their Wills) in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their proper Province, and that before they have any Opportunity to attempt the Performance of it. It &s;eems to us to be a great Step to Prelacy: For what are the Members of the Committee, e&s;pecially as to tho&s;e who gave no Con&s;ent to their Claims, but a Combination or Convocation of Superintendants and Deputy-Prelates, to who&s;e lord|ly Authority the inferior Clergy, the poor Curates, I mean the Pre&s;byteries, are obliged to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>But to prevent being tedious, we mu&s;t not add that the afore&s;aid Act is incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and cannot well hang together. The &s;pecious Rea&s;on offer'd in the fir&s;t Part, <HI>viz.</HI> to &s;upply the Want of Colleges, cla&s;hes with the latter Part, which obliges even &s;uch as have had a College Education, to repair to the Synod's Committee.</P>
<P>Thus we have in as brief a Manner as we could, of|fered &s;ome of our Rea&s;ons again&s;t the Matter of the two late Acts of this Synod. We now proceed to offer our Sentiments about the Power from which they &s;prung, with the principal Rea&s;ons thereof, &s;eeing it is to little Purpo&s;e to takeaway bad Branches while the bitter Root remains untouch'd; for &s;o long as it continues, it will be apt, upon all Occa&s;ions, to produce as bad or wor&s;e
<PB N="53" REF="004820_0027_100DF7F8CD4241B0">again. We will therefore, by divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, ven|ture a Blow at the Root.</P>
<P>We humbly conceive that the afore&s;aid Acts in their pre&s;ent Form are founded upon a fal&s;e Hypothe&s;is or Suppo&s;ition, <HI>namely,</HI> that a Majority of Synods or other Church-Judicatories have a Power committed to them from Chri&s;t to make new Rules, Acts or Canons about Religious Matters, on this Ground or Foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> That they judge them either to be not again&s;t or agree|able to the general Directions of the Word of God, and &s;erviceable to Religion; which &s;hall be Binding up|on tho&s;e that con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;&s;ent therefrom, under certain Penalties which are to be inflicted even upon tho&s;e who judge the Acts they inforce to be contrary to the Mind of Chri&s;t, and prejudicial to the Intere&s;ts of his Kingdom. This is in brief a legi&s;lative or law-ma|king Power in religious Matters, and this we do utterly di&s;claim and renounce for the Rea&s;ons which we &s;hall anon mention, and are plea&s;ed that we have our Synod's Concurrence therein in a printed Declaration, which was &s;ent to <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;ome Years agone: That Declara|tion, which we apprehend worthy of a prote&s;tant Body, we purpo&s;e to maintain inviolably in our Practice as well as Profe&s;&s;ion. Now, we conceive that a religious Law may be &s;aid to be new in two Re&s;pects, <HI>viz.</HI> in re&s;pect of the Matter in&s;erted in it, or the Pe|nalty annexed to it, <HI>i. e.</HI> when any Thing is required or forbidden by it which is not required or forbidden by God in his Word, the Law is new. Again, a Law may be &s;aid to be new (as we conceive) when, tho' the Sub&s;tance thereof be according to or contained in the Word of God, a Penalty is inflicted for the Breach thereof, which is not pre&s;cribed by the King of the Church.</P>
<P>Now the principal Rea&s;ons that incline us to believe that there is no legi&s;lative Authority in the Church of Chri&s;t, are the&s;e following.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="54" REF="004820_0028_100DF7FB0DD0E168">
I. If Church Judicatories have a Right to &s;uch a Power as this, then they have received it from Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This, we hope, will admit of no Di&s;pute; for he is the great Head of his Church, the Govern|ment is laid upon his Shoulders. Again, if Chri&s;t has given them &s;uch a Power, he has &s;omewhere &s;ignified the Grant of it in his Word. But the Place or Places of Scripture we cannot find wherein the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t authorizes the greater Number of a Church-Ju|dicature to lord it over their fewer Brethren, and the Heritage of God under their In&s;pection, by making Laws of their own Devi&s;ing over their Heads, inforced with penal Sanctions, and particularly that of Non|communion among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Neither can we find in the Word of God, any Pa&s;&s;age wherein our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer Je&s;us Chri&s;t has enjoined his Mini&s;ters, and other Members of his Church, to &s;ub|mit or yield a blind Obedience to the Laws and Ordi|nances of a greater Number in a Church Judicatory, altho' they judge them to be &s;inful and contrary to the Good of his Kingdom. When either of the afore&s;aid Particulars is made evident from the Scriptures of Truth, then we will readily &s;ubject our Con&s;ciences to the Guidance of other Men, and yield undi&s;puted Obedience to all their Decrees: But, we hope, never before.</P>
<P N="2">II. The making of new religious Laws, &s;eems to us to be an Inva&s;ion upon the kingly Office of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to who&s;e Royalty it peculiarly belongs to give Laws to his Church. Hence the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> informs us that <HI>there is one Law-giver (i. e.</HI> one only who is exclu&s;ive of all others) <HI>who is able to &s;ave and de&s;troy:</HI> Subjoining, <HI>Who art thou then that judge&s;t another, Jam.</HI> iv. 12. <HI>Col.</HI> i. 18. Chri&s;t <HI>is the Head of the Body, the Church,</HI> he is con&s;tituted the King of <HI>Zion.</HI> Now, if the Church of Chri&s;t has but one Head, one King, one Law giver, how can any Man on Earth make
<PB N="55" REF="004820_0028_100DF7FB0DD0E168">Laws in Addition to Chri&s;t's for the Government of his Subjects in religious Matters, without making the Church a mon&s;trous Body, with many Heads, with|out commencing Kings in his Kingdom, or rather &s;et|ting up a Kingdom of their own in Oppo&s;ition to his? If making new religious Laws, as to their Matter, or adding new Penalties to old ones, be not Acts of kingly Power, we de&s;ire to know what is.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e the Members of Chri&s;t's Church are, from from this very Argument, di&s;&s;uaded from yielding Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch a Claim of Power. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vii. 23. <HI>Ye are bought with a Price; be not ye the Servants of Men. Mark</HI> vii. 5. 6.&mdash;ix. <HI>Then the</HI> Phari&s;ees <HI>and</HI> Scribes <HI>a&s;ked him, why walk not thy Di&s;ciples according to the the Tradition of the Elders, but eat Bread with unwa&s;hen Hands.</HI> (To whom Chri&s;t replied) <HI>In vain do they wor|&s;hip me, Teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</HI> Here was an Act of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Synod concer|ning a Thing very innocent in its Nature, and yet we &s;ee of what dangerous Tendency it was in the Judg|ment of our Saviour. When the fal&s;e Brethren would have brought the <HI>Galatian</HI> Church into the Bondage of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Ceremonies, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> would not give place by Subjection, no not for an Hour, that the Truth of the Go&s;pel might continue with them, <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 4, 5.</P>
<P N="3">III. The afore&s;aid Power of Legi&s;lation (or Law-making) in religious Matters, &s;eems to us to be utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Perfection of the Holy Scripture; of which the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> te&s;tifies, That <HI>it is profitable for Doctrine, Correction, In&s;truction in Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, that the Man of God may be perfect and thoroughly furni&s;hed to every good Work,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 16. 17. Whatever good Work there is in the whole Sphere of Religion, the holy Scriptures afford &s;uf|ficient Laws for the Performance of it; by the&s;e the Man of God may be thoroughly furni&s;hed and perfect; and can any Man de&s;ire more than Perfection? or can
<PB N="56" REF="004820_0029_100DF7FD2E978D20">there be any good Work in Religion, which is not pre|&s;cribed by the Author of it? If &s;o, then Super&s;tition is ju&s;tified, contrary to the many Pa&s;&s;ages of Holy Writ that condemn it. If not, then where is there any room for new religious Laws of human Invention?</P>
<P>If the King of the Church and Author of the Scrip|tures be Wi&s;dom and Love it&s;elf, then certainly his omni&s;cient Eye mu&s;t pierce the Vail of Futurity, and perfectly behold all the various Difficulties which his poor Church was to grapple with through all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Scenes of its Duration here; and his boundle&s;s Love excite his un&s;earchable Wi&s;dom to form every Law that was, is, or &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary for its Direction in every of them. Now, if the Ca&s;e be &s;o, what need can there po&s;&s;ibly be of new religious Laws made (at any time) by &s;hort-&s;ighted, fallible, corrupt Creatures; and if it be not &s;o, our Religion and Faith are vain, and we are yet in our Sins. To imagine a Nece&s;&s;ity of new Laws in religious Matters, contains in it (in our Opi|nion) an ungenerous Reflection upon the divine Word, and the Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s and Faithfulne&s;s of its Author.</P>
<P N="4">IV. A Power of Law-making in religious Affairs, is (in our Opinion) incon&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tian Liberty, which, we think, contains in it a free U&s;e or Di&s;u&s;e of Things, in their general Nature indifferent, according to the be&s;t Judgment we our&s;elves can form of their Ex|pediency or Inexpediency, from the general Directions of the divine Word applied to our Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly there are many Things which are in their general Nature lawful to be done or avoided, which are not nece&s;&s;ary by any Law of the Go&s;pel, any farther than as varying Circum&s;tances may render them expedient, as Helps for the Performance of commanded Duties, or inexpedient, as Hinderances. Now if a Ma|jority of Church Rulers may fix and determine all the&s;e Things for us by Laws of their Invention, armed with
<PB N="57" REF="004820_0029_100DF7FD2E978D20">Penalties again&s;t tho&s;e that con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;&s;ent, then we are in a poor Box indeed. If the&s;e Things that Chri&s;t has left free be not left &s;o by Church Authority, then what &s;hall become of the Liberty which our dear Redeemer has bought for us by his Blood, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vii. 23. <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. <HI>Being made free by &s;o great a Price, wherefore &s;hould we become the Servants of Men,</HI> and tamely &s;uffer our&s;elves to be en&s;nared and en&s;laved by a Yoke of their Framing &amp; Impo&s;ing. Are we not com|manded to &s;tand fa&s;t in the Liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free. It has been frequently, and, we think, ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by the mo&s;t eminent Defenders of our Per&s;ua&s;ion, again&s;t the exorbitant Claims of ano|ther Church, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is not to be imagined that our merciful Redeemer would die to free his People from a Yoke of ceremonial Laws of divine In&s;titution, and at the &s;ame time leave them expo&s;ed to the Will of their Fel|low-Creatures, to be oppre&s;&s;ed with a Multiplicity of their Inventions, which have been often as unrea&s;onable as cruel.</P>
<P>Every new religious Law cuts off a valuable Branch from our Chri&s;tian Liberty; and how &s;oon they may be &s;o multiplied as to bereave us entirely of that precious Privilege (in the Sen&s;e before mentioned) we know not: But this &s;eems evident to us, that, according to the Law-making Scheme, our Liberty lies at the Mercy of Men, who may, if we &s;tupidly couch under the Burdens they impo&s;e, &s;oon de&s;troy it.</P>
<P N="5">V. The afore&s;aid Power of Legi&s;lation in Matters of Religion, Prudence, and Con&s;cience, oppo&s;es and tends to de&s;troy (in our Opinion) the antient Church-Di&s;ci|pline that Chri&s;t has appointed, by fixing new Terms of Communion. The Sub&s;tance of that Di&s;cipline which Chri&s;t has appointed in his Word (as we con|ceive) con&s;i&s;ts principally in excluding from Commu|nion &s;uch gro&s;ly erroneous or vicious Per&s;ons in Principle or Practice, as his Word points out; and receiving them again into it, upon their &s;hewing the Signs of Pe|nitence:
<PB N="58" REF="004820_0030_100DF7FF8B6CF510">In &s;hort, the Terms of the Di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t are fixed and invariable, and &s;hould be inviolably ob&s;erved by all Churches; but the Legi&s;ative Power afore&s;aid, by coining new religious Laws, makes a new Term of Communion by every one of them, in Addi|tion to tho&s;e our Saviour had ordained, &s;o that hereby the Di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t is gradually drawn off its antient Foundation, <HI>namely,</HI> the Laws of God, to the Lu&s;ts, Fancies and Traditions of Men, thro' which the former are &s;ometimes made void; for by their Traditions they are &s;ometimes obliged to reject tho&s;e whom the Laws of Chri&s;t oblige them to receive, tho&s;e whom they them&s;elves were wont to receive; <HI>e. g.</HI> The Laws of Chri&s;t oblige them to receive to Chri&s;tian Communion all tho&s;e that are &s;ound in the main Points of Faith, and regular in Life, altho' they err in Circum&s;tantials or le&s;&s;er Points; and to Mini&s;terial all tho&s;e that have the Qualifications which the King of the Church requires in his Word. <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 1, 4. <HI>Him that is weak in Faith, receive ye; but not to doubtful Di&s;putations. Who art thou that judge&s;t another Man's Servant?</HI> whereas the new Laws of Churches have excluded and do exclude &s;uch. Every Man, how pious, peaceable, u&s;eful and eminent &s;oever he be, in all valuable Re&s;pects, if he &s;cruples and oppo|&s;es &s;uch Church-Canons as he thinks are di&s;honourable and detrimental to true Religion, tho' Chri&s;t receives him to Glory, and bids them receive him; yet by the&s;e human Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws they will reject him, &s;ome from Chri&s;tian and Mini&s;terial Communion both, and &s;ome from Mini&s;terial only. Thus a dreadful Foundation is laid for a Succe&s;&s;ion of Schi&s;ms in the Church of God, while &s;uch a Claim of Power is pre|tended to, and exerci&s;ed, by which the Seamle&s;s Coat of Chri&s;t is rent and torn into an almo&s;t infinite Num|ber of Parts. For, the Charter of Law-making (in our humble Opinion) is hard to be found in the Bible, and the Prudentials about which they exerci&s;e it, are
<PB N="59" REF="004820_0030_100DF7FF8B6CF510">oftentimes difficult to be determined. Good Men are apt to have different Minds about them, and being of different Sentiments, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly inclined to act according to the be&s;t of their Light; &s;o long as there is Con&s;cience and Courage on Earth, while the afore&s;aid Engine is mounted on the Wheel, a &s;ad Scene of Debate and Divi&s;ion is opened.</P>
<P>In &s;hort: If we may be &s;uffered to &s;peak plainly, a Legi&s;lative Authority makes the Terms of Communion as variable as any Weather-Cock; &s;o that a Man is in continual Danger of being ca&s;t out of Communion, where it is exerci&s;ed in its Rigour, unle&s;s he has a Con|&s;cience as plyable as Wax, ready to receive every Im|pre&s;&s;ion, or can alter his Sentiments out of Complai&s;ance to a Majority of Votes, as fa&s;t as the Camelion its Co|lours. Which leads us to the</P>
<P N="6">VI. Rea&s;on, which we humbly offer again&s;t a Legi&s;|lative Authority in Matters purely religious, and it is this, That we think it an unwarantable Encroachment upon the Rights of Con&s;cience and private Judgment; becau&s;e it determines for us, what properly falls within their Sphere, and obliges us to &s;ubmit thereto whether convinced or not, or &s;uffer certain Penalties, which Almighty GOD has not pre&s;cribed in his Word in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>That Matters of Prudence and Expediency under a religious Con&s;ideration, come within the Sphere of Con|&s;cience, is evident from this, That by doing what is prudent and expedient, much Service acrues to Reli|gion, and by the contrary much Damage: Now, can any Man be a true Chri&s;tian and not have a con&s;cien|tious Regard to do and avoid what promotes and hinders the Intere&s;ts of true Religion? Again, we think it e|vident from Scripture, that God has given the only Right to every Man to judge for him&s;elf in the Parti|culars afore&s;aid. 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 5.21. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.13. <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.14, 22, 23. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.12.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="004820_0031_100DEE8696725680">
The Right of private Judgment in general is equally apparent from the Principles of natural as well as re|vealed Religion; if every Man mu&s;t an&s;wer at la&s;t for his own Actions, and the Mi&s;guidance of others will not clear him from Guilt or guard him from Puni&s;h|ment in following them, it is but equal that he &s;hould judge for him&s;elf al&s;o: The holy Scriptures frequently enjoin this Duty of examining what is propo&s;ed to us in religious Matters, and commend the Performance of it in the <HI>Bereans;</HI> and to what Purpo&s;e &s;hould we exa|mine the&s;e Things, but to form a Judgment about them, and act accordingly? If we mu&s;t act contrary to our Judgment, becau&s;e of the Laws of our Fellow-Creatures, then our Examination &s;erves but to encrea&s;e our Guilt and Puni&s;hment; for <HI>he that doubts, is damned if he eat, Rom.</HI> 14.23. And if we mu&s;t believe, that to be pru|dential and &s;erviceable to Religion which any Set of Men make into Laws, meerly becau&s;e of their &s;uppo&s;ed Authority; then certainly Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion; then implicit Faith and blind Obedience are found and whole&s;ome Doctrines; then in order to qua|lify us for thorough Subjection to our &s;piritual Gover|nors, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to pluck out our own Eyes, that we may &s;ee clearly thro' their Spectacles.</P>
<P>Neither does that plau&s;ible Apology of the Patrons of a Legi&s;lative Power, <HI>viz.</HI> that their Acts or Canons about Prudentials, are grounded upon and agreeable to the Word of God, or general Directions of Scripture, make the unhappy Ca&s;e of tho&s;e that are under &s;uch a heavy Yoke, a Bit the better, &s;o long as the minor Party are deprived of the Right of Judging for them|&s;elves, whether the&s;e Things be &s;o or not, and of acting according to their Judgment without Cen&s;ure. This leads us to</P>
<P N="7">VII. Another Rea&s;on again&s;t Legi&s;lative Authority in religious Matters, which is this, <HI>namely,</HI> That &s;uch a binding Power nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es one of the&s;e two
<PB N="61" REF="004820_0031_100DEE8696725680">Things, <HI>viz.</HI> either that Church-Judicatories are infal|lible in their Determinations, and &s;o cannot injoin what is wrong; or that they have Power to legitimate an Error, and make that which was antecedently Evil, to become Good, by Enjoining it. A legi&s;lative Authority in the Church, mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be re&s;olved into one or other of the&s;e two as its fir&s;t Principle: But we are per&s;uaded that both the one and the other will be di&s;|claimed by us all, and con&s;equently &s;o ought this Power, which cannot be claimed con&s;i&s;tently without them. That there is &s;uch a Connexion in this Ca&s;e is mo&s;t ma|nife&s;t; for if Church-Judicatories are not infallible, then they may err, either requiring that to be done which ought not, or forbidding that which ought; in neither of which Ca&s;es certainly are we bound to obey, unle&s;s their Authority is al&s;o &s;uch that it can alter the Nature of Things, or &s;ecure us from the Puni&s;hment we de&s;erve for doing what is Evil, or neglecting what is Good. In a Word Legi&s;lators in Religion mu&s;t be either infal|lible or omnipotent. This not only Rea&s;on teaches, but the Word of God confirms, <HI>Jam.</HI> iv. 12. We have no Certainty but that a Church Judicatory may injoin &s;omething very prejudicial to the Church of Chri&s;t, either through the Short-&s;ightedne&s;s and Mi&s;ap|prehen&s;ions of well-de&s;igning Men; or it may po&s;&s;ibly happen that a con&s;iderable Number are influenced by wrong Principles and Motives; and if Things appear to be &s;o to others, mu&s;t their Hands be bound up from doing their Duty in Endeavouring to promote the Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;t's Kingdom; and &s;o &s;ubject their Con&s;ciences, and the valuable Intere&s;ts of Religion, to the Commandments of Men? For Per&s;ons to impo&s;e Laws of their own De|vi&s;ing upon others, without any Pretence to Infallibi|lity, is (as we conceive) a very incon&s;i&s;tent Proceeding.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tant Legi&s;lators in religious Matters, by owning the Fallibility of their Church-Judicatories, are obliged either to abandon their favourite Scheme, or a&s;|&s;ert
<PB N="62" REF="004820_0032_100DF8047331B680">the binding Power of erroneous Laws; but not be|ing willing to do the former, they cho&s;e to attempt the Defence of the latter, <HI>namely,</HI> that Submi&s;&s;ion is due to erroneous Laws and Sentences. To make this the more plau&s;ible, they acknowledge that we ought to re|fu&s;e active Obedience to unju&s;t Sentences, but not pa&s;|&s;ive, <HI>i. e.</HI> as we under&s;tand it, we mu&s;t, according to their Notion, neglect the Performance of a Duty which God and Con&s;cience enjoin, becau&s;e Church-Authority forbid it. If the Ca&s;e be &s;o, then the Church has Power to oblige to Sins of Omi&s;&s;ion, but not of Commi&s;&s;ion. Then we ought to obey negative &s;inful Commands, but not po&s;itive. But we humbly conceive that this Di&s;|tinction in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e is full nice; for if we mu&s;t obey Man rather than God in the one, why not in the other al&s;o, and &s;o make thorough Work of it.</P>
<P>To this &s;hocking Extremity does the legi&s;lative Scheme nece&s;&s;arily lead its Patrons; for if they allowed that &s;in|ful Canons were null and void in them&s;elves, altho' pa&s;s'd by a Majority of Votes, and gave Liberty to the minor Party to judge for them&s;elves, and to act accord|ing to their own Judgment without Cen&s;ure; their dar|ling Structure would crumble into de&s;erved Ruin. But while they labour to maintain the contrary exorbitant and awful Claim of Power, their Doctrine tends to de|&s;troy every Thing that is valuable in the humane Nature, as well as to &s;ap the very Foundations of the prote&s;tant Religion. And this is</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Another Argument which we beg leave a little to in&s;i&s;t upon. The Notion of a legi&s;lative Power in religious Matters, with the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmiting to its erroneous Deci&s;ions, &s;eem to us to condemn the Refor|mation from <HI>Popery,</HI> and our Di&s;&s;enting from the <HI>Church of England:</HI> For if it be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit to erring Sentences of Churches, then how could the fir&s;t Reformers oppo&s;e the Authority and Revolt from the Juri&s;diction of the Church of <HI>Rome?</HI> and how can the
<PB N="63" REF="004820_0032_100DF8047331B680">Nonconformi&s;ts, upon this Plan, vindicate their oppo&s;ing the Canons of the <HI>Church of England</HI> (which they own to be a true Church) from the Charge of Schi&s;m? If any Church have a Power of Legi&s;lation about Prudentials, they mu&s;t of Con&s;equence have Authority to judge and determine what are &s;uch, and &s;o to oblige to the Ob&s;ervance of them, and the avoiding their Contraries under the Penalty of Non-communion. If the <HI>Pre&s;|byterians</HI> have this Power, then certainly the <HI>Church of England</HI> have it al&s;o: And in pur&s;uance of this &s;uppo&s;ed Claim of Power, they have actually made a great many Canons or religious Laws e&s;tabli&s;hing, under the Penal|ty of Non-communion, their Liturgy, Hierarchy, Cro&s;s in Bapti&s;m, and many other U&s;ages, which they deemed very expedient to promote Order and Decency. Now, how can we, according to the afore&s;aid Scheme, ju&s;tify our not Submitting to the lawful Authority of that Church?</P>
<P>We think it very incon&s;i&s;tent to maintain &s;uch a Claim of Power, as would have forever prevented the very Being of all the reformed Churches in general, and &s;uch as condemns our Di&s;&s;enting-One in particular.</P>
<P>It &s;eems al&s;o to us incon&s;i&s;tent, to gra&s;p after a Power for our&s;elves which we condemn in others, or to di&s;claim it in Word, while we practi&s;e it in Deed. We can|not think that any Church can need any Thing for its Support, which would over&s;et its Foundations; or that Truth can alter its Nature in a Succe&s;&s;ion of time: We &s;uppo&s;e that what was true at the time of the Re|formation, is &s;o &s;till. Again,</P>
<P N="9">IX. We know not how to free all new religious Laws from the Charge of Super&s;tition and Uncharita|blene&s;s, whatever pious De&s;igns the Formers of them may have notwith&s;tanding: <HI>For who has required the&s;e Things at their Hands, and why are they righteous over|much. Eccle&s;s.</HI> vii. 16. Wherefore do they teach the Fear of God by the Precepts of Men, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxix, 13. and
<PB N="64" REF="004820_0033_100DF806A600E1C0">impo&s;e their human Commandments upon their Breth|ren's Con&s;ciences, which tho' they have a Shew of Wi&s;dom, are really the Contrary; becau&s;e they are Additions to the unerring Laws of the Wi&s;dom of the Father, and naturally tend to draw his People from an entire Subjection to him as the Head of his Church, <HI>Col.</HI> ii. 21, 22. Wherefore do they introduce a Sy&s;tem of human Commandments when Chri&s;t has aboli&s;hed the old ceremonial In&s;titutions, which were of a divine Original, and thereby put a &s;tumbling Block in their Brother's Way, contrary to the following Places of &s;acred Scripture, <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 15. <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 13, 14. <HI>Let us not therefore judge one another any more; but judge this rather, that no Man put a &s;tumbling Block, or an Occa&s;ion to fall, in his Brother's Way.</HI> To him that e&s;teemeth any Thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. <HI>But if thy Brother be grieved with thy Meat, now walke&s;t thou not charitably. De&s;troy thou not him with thy Meat, for whom Chri&s;t died.</HI></P>
<P>Once more we beg leave to ob&s;erve, that the legi&s;la|tive Power afore&s;aid, is introductive of very great Evils and Mi&s;chiefs into the Church of Chri&s;t, and in parti|cular, it opens a wide Door for the Introducing of an intolerable Bondage under human Yokes: Neither does it only open a Door for this, and &s;o make it po&s;&s;ible, nor yet only tend to it, and &s;o make it probable; but it is what it has done in Fact to high degree, as the deplo|rable Experience of many Ages witne&s;s.</P>
<P>We are per&s;uaded that a Claim of Power made by the Church-Rulers to frame Laws deem'd by them to be orderly, deceut, prudent, expedient, gave Ri&s;e to Prelacy and Popery it&s;elf, and to all the burden&s;om Train of un&s;criptural and ridiculous Ceremonies which the latter of the&s;e Churches does now groan under, as well as to &s;tated Liturgies, and other unhappy U&s;ages, in which &s;ome Prote&s;tant Churches have too much copy'd after the <HI>Roman</HI> Super&s;tition. The&s;e Things
<PB N="65" REF="004820_0033_100DF806A600E1C0">are Yokes which neither we nor our Fathers were able to bear. If this Power be taken once for granted, who knows where it may &s;top in its Effects? We cannot &s;ee that we have any more Security at this day upon this Plan, in the prote&s;tant Church, to prevent the like Bondage again, than the Church had when the in&s;pired Apo&s;tles left it. It's true it is probable we may not like the Yokes that others have made for us, and wreath'd about the Necks of Chri&s;t's Subjects in Ages pa&s;t. But po&s;&s;ibly we may be plea&s;ed with as bad or wor&s;e, which we either do or may make our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Again, this &s;uppo&s;ed binding Power expo&s;es Per&s;ons to be per&s;ecuted for their Con&s;ciences; when any either of our Brethren in the Mini&s;try, or of a private Station in the Church, cannot with a clear Con&s;cience ob&s;erve or &s;ubmit to Church-Canons; then they are liable to be re|proved and cen&s;ured, and who knows to what Degree? Yea, it may even cau&s;e Schi&s;m and Separation it&s;elf, which lies at the Door of the Impo&s;ers who forced it, and whereof they alone are the Authors. What di&s;mal Havock has been made in the Churches by this terrible Engine of legi&s;lative Authority, in anathematizing and excluding from Communion &s;ome of the worthie&s;t Men in our Mother-Countries and el&s;ewhere, is &s;o fla|grant in Hi&s;tory, that we need not mention In&s;tances.</P>
<P>When a Majority in a Church-Judicatory are &s;uppos'd to have Power to coin Laws according to their own Fancy, whereby they may judge of a minor Party, only pretending in the mean Time &s;ome general &s;criptural Direction as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, as al&s;o their U&s;efulne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which it's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> in any Ca&s;e, and has been ac|tually done in Favour of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Super&s;titions of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church; may they not then, according to this Scheme, wreck their angry Re&s;entments upon, cru&s;h and oppre&s;s their fewer Brethren, ju&s;t as they li&s;t, whom perhaps they could not ju&s;tly cen&s;ure, if they kept entirely to the good old Laws of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="004820_0034_100DF808D152A970">
Such being the natural Effects of a Legi&s;lative Authority in Religion, we cannot think the Cau&s;e is good that produces them, or that our wi&s;e and good Redeemer would put an Engine of &s;o much Mi&s;chief and Oppre&s;&s;ion into the Hands of Churchmen, thereby giving an Occa&s;ion to worry one another. On the contrary, does not our LORD inform us, how he re&s;ents it, when his Servants by Office begin to beat and &s;mite their Fellow-Servants, and exerci&s;e a tyrannical Dominion over them, which is the common and natural Effect of Men's adding Laws of their own unto the Laws of Chri&s;t? The LORD indeed has autho|rized the Stewards of his Hou&s;e to cen&s;ure the Violators of his own Laws; but not to bind where he has not bound, in Con&s;e|quence whereof his faithful People may be oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>If it be oppo&s;ed to the preceeding Rea&s;onings, that according to this Principle, it is impo&s;&s;ible to maintain a Decorum and good Order in the Church, but that all imaginable Confu&s;ions mu&s;t be expected to en&s;ue, without any Po&s;&s;ibility of Re&s;traint; and that, tho' Authority may be abu&s;ed in &s;ome particular In&s;tances, yet even bad Government is better than Anarchy, or no authori|tative. Government at all; and that, then there is no Occa&s;ion, much le&s;s Nece&s;&s;ity for Synods, or other Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Judicatories, to meet at all, and &s;o the whole Con&s;titution which Chri&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed for ordering the Affairs of his Church, falls to the Ground. To this we an&s;wer;</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Objection bears in its Bo&s;om gro&s;s and grievous Reflections upon the Laws of Chri&s;t contained in the Scriptures, as well as upon the Lawgiver, <HI>namely,</HI> That that Sy&s;tem of Laws he has given for the Government of his Church, is imper|fect, in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer the End de&s;igned by it, without the After-Additions of his Subjects. And indeed the Objection bears hard upon the Honour of his Wi&s;dom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, Faithfulne&s;s, and Truth, as if he either could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> not give his People &s;ufficient Laws for their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> had not done it when he &s;ays he has. In the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> charitably hope, that the&s;e Reflections are not intended by the Objectors; but they are mo&s;t certainly the natural and nece&s;&s;ary Fruits of the Objection it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. We think the afore&s;aid Objection again&s;t the preceeding Rea&s;onings, is a meer <HI>Non-&s;equitur,</HI> or fal&s;e Con&s;equence. The Lord Je&s;us has given &s;uch Power and Authority to the Guides of
<PB N="67" REF="004820_0034_100DF808D152A970">his Church, as is &s;ufficient for the Edification of his Body, without this Power of making Acts of their own Divi&s;ing, as obligatory Laws. Particular Pre&s;byteries ought undoubtedly to meet, to enquire into the Fitne&s;s and Qualifications of tho&s;e who offer them&s;elves to the &s;acred Work of the Mini&s;try, and either to admit or refu&s;e them, according as they find them qualified, and likely to do Service or Di&s;&s;ervice to the Church in that Office.</P>
<P>They have Liberty and Authority al&s;o to deny Church-Com|munion too, and ca&s;t out of Communion &s;uch as by plain &s;crip|ture Directions are di&s;qualified for it, either by &s;uch fundamental Errors in Doctrine or enormous Practices as are incon&s;i&s;tent with true Chri&s;tianity; and to inflict &s;uch Cen&s;ures upon irregular Church-Members as God in his Word makes due to &s;uch Offen|ces as they are guilty of.</P>
<P>In Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience propo&s;ed to them, or Ca&s;es of Differ|ence regularly brought before them from particular Congregations, they ought to give their deliberate Judgment, with their be&s;t Coun&s;el and Advice.</P>
<P>They have likewi&s;e Liberty to agree and conclude among them&s;elves upon &s;uch Things as appear to them to have a good Tendency to the Advancing of Religion, and are founded upon or agreeable to the Word of God; and &s;o engage them&s;elves voluntarily to the Ob&s;ervance of the&s;e Things, provided that they do not incroach upon the ju&s;t Liberties of the People under their Charge, nor pretend to bind their di&s;&s;enting Members to ob&s;erve their Agreements, who may have a different View and Appre|hen&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, it is rea&s;onable and u&s;eful that Synods, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal Pre&s;byteries, meet together, whether Matters may be brought by Way of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> or Reference from particular Pre&s;|byteries in order to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> the Judgment and Sentiment of a greater Number <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>in the Multitude of Coun&s;ellors there is Safety;</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> doubt their Duty to take &s;uch Ca&s;es under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, and give their be&s;t Advice in them: But we think that they &s;hould not proceed to any further Authority except in &s;uch Ca&s;es wherein God has given particular obvious Direction in his Word, which is to be exactly followed; and even then they do no more than &s;how from the Scriptures what is the Mind and Direction of God in &s;uch Ca&s;es, and de|clare their own Re&s;olutions to act according thereto, &s;o far as they are concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="004820_0035_100DF80A927382C0">
Now we conceive, that &s;uch a Method of Management in Church Judicatories is that which the Lord Je&s;us has only ap|pointed; and we think it is far better adapted to an&s;wer all the valuable Ends of Church Government, than that Strain of human Authority which we are oppo&s;ing: And had the Pa&s;tors of the Church always contented them&s;elves with that Power which Chri&s;t has given them, without Claiming more, it is hard to conceive how the Chri&s;tian World could have been &s;o generally corrupted and divided as it has been for many Ages, and is at this Day.</P>
<P>To conclude, we profe&s;s a hearty Charity for tho&s;e Gentle|men who are on the other Side of the Que&s;tion in this Debate. Doubtle&s;s Things appear to them in another Light. We have only, in the Cour&s;e of our Rea&s;onings, laboured to expo&s;e the Ab&s;urdity of an Opinion which we think prejudicial to the Inter|e&s;ts of the Saviour's Kingdom: And if we are herein mi&s;taken we are willing to be convinced by Scripture and Rea&s;on; but whether we get Conviction or not by our Brethren's Arguments, we believe that the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace may be pre&s;erved notwith&s;tanding a Diver&s;ity of Sentiment about le&s;&s;er Things, if moderate Coun&s;els be followed, and that mutual For|bearance be allowed, which the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t requires.</P>
