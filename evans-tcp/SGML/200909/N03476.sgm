<P>_IT was a part of the Prie&s;t's Duty, un|der the Mo&s;aick Di&s;pen&s;ation, to hearten and incite the Armies of I&s;|rael to fight the <HI>Lord's Battles,</HI> with Intrepidity and undaunted Courage. <HI>Deut.</HI> 20.2, 3, 4. <HI>It &s;hall be when ye are come nigh unto the Battle, that the Prie&s;t &s;hall approach, and &s;peak unto the People, and &s;hall &s;ay unto them, Hear, O I&s;rael, ye approach this day unto battle again&s;t your Enemies: let not your heart faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified becau&s;e of them. For the Lord your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for you again&s;t your Enemies, to &s;ave you.</HI> As the Prie&s;t was to &s;peak thus, and animate the Sol|diers to a valiant Behaviour in the Day of Battle, &s;o que&s;tionle&s;s, he was before it, to exhort them, as there was need, to be in a readine&s;s, duly prepared
<PB N="2" REF="004249_0003_100408FAA9C91908">for it. That there was &s;uch a number of well-di&s;ci|plined Men with <HI>Jehozabad,</HI> might be partly a good Effect of the Prie&s;ts and Levites faithful teaching throughout all the Cities of <HI>Judah,</HI> of which the Con|text &s;peaks. And what the Mini&s;ters of the Lord then did, may be now equally incumbent on the Preachers of the <HI>Go&s;pel of Peace.</HI> It is therefore (as I apprehend and undertake it) the Duty of my <HI>Po&s;t,</HI> to be a Monitor unto Soldiers; who, by coming at this time into the Hou&s;e of the Lord, &s;eem to demand of me, as the Soldiers did of <HI>John</HI> Bapti&s;t, Luk. 3.14. <HI>And what &s;hall we do?</HI> And though he is the lea&s;t of Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters, at who&s;e Mouth they &s;eek the Law; yet while I declare to them the <HI>Coun&s;el of God,</HI> I may expect that they will TAKE HEED.</P>
<P>With this Chapter begins the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Jeho&s;ha|phat</HI>'s glorious and happy Reign over the Kingdom of <HI>Judah.</HI> He was the Son and Succe&s;&s;or of a good King, and <HI>walked in the fir&s;t ways of his Father A&s;a,</HI> as well as of <HI>David.</HI> His Wi&s;dom in ordering his Military Affairs, to his own E&s;tabli&s;hment in the Throne, and the Peace and Welfare of his Subjects, is the only Thing in his Character and Admini&s;tra|tion, which I &s;hall now remark to you, as what may afford us &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable In&s;truction.</P>
<P>Of this we have an Account in the beginning, and from v. 12. to the End of the Chapter. Upon his Acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne, <HI>he &s;trengthned him&s;elf again&s;t I&s;rael. And he placed Forces in all the fenced Cities of Judah, and &s;et Gari&s;ons in the Land of Judah, and in the Cities of Ephraim, which A&s;a his Father had taken.</HI> In the latter Days of <HI>A&s;a,</HI> which were not &s;o pious and pro&s;perous as his fir&s;t, there was War between the Kingdom of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and of <HI>Judah:</HI> So that the fir&s;t Thing which <HI>Jeho&s;haphat,</HI> after he came to the Crown, had to do, was to fortify again&s;t &s;o near and formida|ble an Enemy. Which he did &s;o effectually, that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in&s;tead of pu&s;hing on the War
<PB N="3" REF="004249_0004_10043A0AC7939B10">again&s;t him, &s;oon courted his Alliance and A&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> &s;trengthened him&s;elf, not as his Father did, by a League with the King of <HI>Syria,</HI> but by building Gari&s;ons on his Frontiers, and well-manning of them. On which lawful Methods of Defence, he might expect God's Ble&s;&s;ing, and in the u&s;e of which proper Means he tru&s;ted in God. <HI>And Jeho&s;haphat waxed great exceedingly, and he built in Judah Ca&s;tles and Cities of Stone:</HI> in which he had plenty of Arms, Ammuni|tion, and Victuals. <HI>And he had much Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Cities of Judah,</HI> which he did not through Indolence and Luxury, neglect; but did a great deal in repair|ing and fortifying the Cities of <HI>Judah,</HI> and furni&s;hing them with nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions, as well as in purging them from the Reliques of Idolatry and Inju&s;tice. <HI>And the Men of War, mighty Men of Valour, were in Jeru&s;alem. Jeru&s;alem</HI> being the Metropolis of the Kingdom, and the Thrones of the Hou&s;e of <HI>David</HI> being &s;et there, the principal of the Military Forces were placed in it: or at lea&s;t, the Generals and Chief Captains, with &s;ome Companies of their Soldiers, at|tended the King there. <HI>And the&s;e are the Numbers of them, according to the Hou&s;e of their Fathers: Of Judah, the Captains of Thou&s;ands; Adnah, the Chief, and with him mighty Men of Valour, three hundred thou&s;and. And next to him was Jehohanan the Captain, and with him two hundred and four&s;core thou&s;and. And next to him was Ama&s;iah the Son of Zichri, who wil|lingly offered him&s;elf unto the Lord; and with him two hundred thou&s;and mighty Men of Valour. And of Ben|jamin; Eliada a mighty Man of Valour, and with him armed Men with Bow and Shield, two hundred thou&s;and. And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and four&s;core thou&s;and, ready prepared for the War: The&s;e waited on the King, be&s;ides tho&s;e whom the King put in the fenced Cities throughout all Judah.</HI> The Sum total of the Soldiers under the&s;e five Captains, was Eleven Hundred and Sixty Thou&s;and Men. It
<PB N="4" REF="004249_0005_10043A10ED29A928">may &s;eem incredible, that &s;o va&s;t an Army &s;hould be rais'd and maintain'd out of the Tribes of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Benjamin:</HI> E&s;pecially &s;ince in the preceding Reign, <HI>A&s;a</HI> could not bring into the Field <HI>Six hundred thou|&s;and</HI> Men. Chap. 14. 8. It is probable, as &s;ome con|ceive, that <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> had not all the&s;e at one time, but &s;ucce&s;&s;ively: The Train'd-Bands of <HI>Judah</HI> being fir&s;t under the Command of <HI>Adnah;</HI> and after his Death, under the Command of <HI>Jehohanan;</HI> and after|wards of <HI>Ama&s;iah.</HI> And the Train'd-Bands of <HI>Benja|min,</HI> fir&s;t under the Command of <HI>Eliada,</HI> and then of <HI>Jehozabad.</HI> Or, as others conceive, that this nume|rous Ho&s;t, almo&s;t Twelve Hundred Thou&s;and, in the Reign of <HI>Jeho&s;haphat,</HI> who was under a &s;pecial Ble&s;|&s;ing of God, and waxed great exceedingly, as in Riches and Honours, &s;o likewi&s;e in Military Strength, was di&s;per&s;ed all the Country over, each Man re&s;iding, for the mo&s;t part, on his own E&s;tate, only appeared on Days of Mu&s;ter to be trained; and were ready, whenever there was Occa&s;ion, to go forth to War; but the Commanders, with a &s;uitable <HI>Life-Guard,</HI> waited on the King at Jeru&s;alem. The&s;e, &s;aith Mr. <HI>Pool,</HI> were the Trained-Bands or Auxiliaries, who&s;e Chief Officers waited upon the King to receive his Commands, and to rai&s;e and bring in all or part of their Forces to the Service of the King and Kingdom, as Need required.&mdash;From the Connexion of the Text and the Character given in it of the Soldiers under the Command of General <HI>Jehozabad,</HI> I may ob|&s;erve to you this Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Doct. <HI>That it is the Honour of a Prince, and Safety of a People, to have a competent Number of Men, ready prepared for War.</HI></P>
<P>The Glory of <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI>'s Reign, and the Felicity of his People under it, con&s;i&s;ted partly in the good Order of the Militia; that there was a &s;ufficient
<PB N="5" REF="004249_0006_10040905ECC964A0">Number of Trained Bands in a readine&s;s for any Ex|pedition, throughly fitted for the War, that either was or might ari&s;e in his Time. And this is the Honour of any Prince, and Strength of any People.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome will de&s;ire to hear proved, what is in this Doctrine &s;uppo&s;ed, That War is lawful. If it be not &s;o in any Ca&s;e, the Doctrine is fal&s;e. It is no Credit to a King, nor advantage to his Subjects, but the rever&s;e, for them to be <HI>wi&s;e to do evil,</HI> and pre|pared for a bad Work. If War be always in it &s;elf &s;inful, then all Di&s;po&s;itions to it, and Preparations for it, are &s;o likewi&s;e. And Sin is the Reproach of any King and People: It &s;tains all their Glory, weakens their Strength, and lays them open to Dangers and Mi&s;eries. But that War in &s;ome Ca&s;es, and with &s;ome Re&s;trictions, is lawful and expedient, the Light of Rea&s;on and of Scripture plainly di&s;covers. Tho' the Cau&s;e of it is always bad, and the Effects of it woful: Tho' it comes from Men's Lu&s;ts, and &s;preads De&s;olation and Death on the Face of the Earth; yet &s;ometimes People have a Call to engage in it, and their &s;hedding the <HI>Blood of War,</HI> may not be a tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion of the Divine Law, <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill.</HI> If it be po&s;&s;ible, we &s;hould live peaceably with all Men: But &s;ometimes it is not &s;o; and then War on their Side, who u&s;ed their be&s;t Endeavours for the pre&s;er|vation of Peace, is lawful and warrantable, is nece&s;&s;ary and unavoidable. "Together with Life, and a natural Love of it, and Means to &s;upport it, God hath im|parted to every Man a Right to defend it, with its nece&s;&s;ary Supports, again&s;t unju&s;t, extreme and inevi|table Violence upon it, or them", and to repel Force with Force. The Law of Self-pre&s;ervation, which is the Law of God and Nature, obligeth Men to fight in Defence of their Lives and Liberties, when vio|lently a&s;&s;aulted and invaded; and, if other Means will not prevail, to maintain, or recover their Rights by the Sword of War. The Law of Humanity, which
<PB N="6" REF="004249_0007_10043A1325C29488">is al&s;o the Law of Chri&s;tianity, bindeth Men in this way to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Neighbours again&s;t unju&s;t Inva&s;ions and Encroachments; and to deliver them from cruel Oppre&s;&s;ions and Captivities. When <HI>Abram</HI> heard that his Brother <HI>Lot</HI> was taken Captive, he armed his trained Servants, born in his own Hou&s;e, three hun|dred and eighteen, and pur&s;ued the Enemies, and &s;mote them: and brought back the Captives, and all their Goods <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 14. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Melchizedeck,</HI> King of <HI>Salem,</HI> and Prie&s;t of the mo&s;t high God, met him, and royally enter|tained him, and ble&s;&s;ed him; thereby approving and applauding what <HI>Abram</HI> had done, in the Slaugh|ter of <HI>Chedorlaomer,</HI> and the Kings that were with him: And the New-Te&s;tament de&s;cribing the Greatne&s;s of <HI>Melchizedeck,</HI> mentions this Action of his, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.1. If War had been in all Ca&s;es unlawful, there would not have been &s;uch Permi&s;&s;ion and Encouragement given to it, as there was in the Jewi&s;h Polity, which was of Divine In&s;titution: And the Battles which God's People fought again&s;t their Enemies, would not be called the <HI>Lord's Battles.</HI> If the Employment of Soldiers had been illegal and unwarrantable, <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t would not have pre&s;crib'd moral Rules to be ob&s;erved by them in it <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luk.</HI> 3.14.</NOTE>, but advi&s;ed them to quit it, and betake them&s;elves to another Cour&s;e of Life. The <HI>Centurion</HI>'s Faith would not have been &s;o highly com|mended by our Saviour <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 8.10.</NOTE>, nor <HI>Cornelius</HI>'s Prayers and Alms accepted by God <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 8.10.</NOTE>, if their Calling (which for all that appears they continued in) had been unlawful. Though the Go&s;pel di&s;&s;allows of private Revenge <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 5.39.</NOTE>, yet it forbids not our &s;eeking for publick Ju&s;tice, in Ca&s;e of in&s;ufferable Wrong: For the Civil Magi&s;trate is <HI>the Mini&s;ter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> 13.4.</NOTE>. But his Power, which is over his own People only, extends not to the redre&s;|&s;ing
<PB N="7" REF="004249_0008_10043A1833E3E3C8">of Injuries that are done to them by another Na|tion. And in &s;uch Ca&s;es there may be a warlike Proce&s;s by an Appeal to the <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> the great Patron of Right, and Di&s;pen&s;er of Succe&s;s.&mdash;Indeed it is foretold, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 2.4. that <HI>in the la&s;t Days,</HI> the Days of Go&s;pel-Light and Peace, <HI>the Nations &s;hall beat their Swords into Plow-&s;hares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks: that Nation &s;hall not li&s;t up Sword again&s;t Na|tion, neither &s;hall they learn War any more.</HI> But this Prophecy &s;heweth, that the De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel is to introduce and e&s;tabli&s;h a univer&s;al Peace, and good Will among Men on Earth; and in tho&s;e on whom it hath its proper Effect, it mortifies tho&s;e Lu&s;ts, from whence come Wars and Fightings. But &s;ince the Go&s;pel is &s;o far from being embraced by all Nations; and they who profe&s;s it, are &s;o far from living up to the Rules and Precepts of it, the Time is not yet arrived for the full accompli&s;hment of this Prediction and Promi&s;e. And till then, we may, by rea&s;on of Men's corrupt Intere&s;ts and Lu&s;ts, which the Go&s;pel oppo&s;eth, expect to &s;ee tho&s;e Words of the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI> verified, Mat. 10.34. <HI>Think not that I am come to &s;end Peace on Earth; I came not to &s;end Peace but a Sword.</HI> And while accidentally, through the Corrup|tions of Men's Hearts, and the prevalence of their Lu&s;ts, the Con&s;equent of our Lord's coming, and &s;etting up his Kingdom is War, the pro&s;ecution of it on one &s;ide, may be what the Go&s;pel allows, yea requires, But tho' War is &s;ometimes lawful and expedient, yet it &s;hould be made with good Advice, and only in Ca&s;e of great Nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould People engage in, and pur|&s;ue it. After all amicable Means of adju&s;ting Dif|ferences between Nation and Nation, prove ineffectual, then, and not before, may they be refer'd to this Divine Arbitrement. And I can't think, but that Soldiers, who are pre&s;s'd into a War, &s;hould be convinc'd of the lawfulne&s;s of it: and &s;hould not be obliged to engage in it, on a blind pre&s;umption that there are
<PB N="8" REF="004249_0009_10040909EF436550">good Rea&s;ons for it, tho' they mu&s;t not know them. All that are killed by them in an unju&s;t War, are murdered; and the <HI>Cry of Blood</HI> is louder than the <HI>confu&s;ed Noi&s;e,</HI> which there is in <HI>every Battle of the Warriour.</HI> And will the Blood unju&s;tly &s;hed in this manner, cry only again&s;t the Prince, by who&s;e Autho|rity the War is levied? Will the whole Blame fall upon him? If &s;o, then Subjects may innocently abet the Lu&s;ts, the Ambition, the Avarice, and Blood|thi&s;tine&s;s of a King. If the Sovereign Power be the ab&s;olute and only Judge whether the Soldier's Cau&s;e and Call be good, then the Subjects of the Grand Turk may be excu&s;ed and ju&s;tified in the Slaughter of Chri&s;|tians: And the Subjects of Popi&s;h Princes in the Ma&s;&s;acre of Prote&s;tants: And the Roman Soldiers did not ami&s;s in apprehending and crucifying our Lord, when their Superiours commanded them: And that Soldier, which is &s;aid to have told <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> in his fir&s;t Expedition again&s;t <HI>Rome,</HI> that in Obedience to his Commands, he would not refu&s;e to &s;heath his Sword in the Brea&s;t of his Brother, or in the Throat of his aged Father, or in the Bowels of his pregnant Mother, was not to be deteited for his unnatural Barbarity, but commended for his loyal Affection to his General. Which Con&s;equences are very &s;hocking.</P>
<P>Tho' it is &s;it, that the great and difficult Affair of War, &s;hould be entru&s;ted with the Prince and Coun|cils of a Nation, yet Soldiers that would keep their Con&s;ciences and Hands pure from the Guilt and Stain of Blood, &s;hould mode&s;tly enquire into the Merits of the Cau&s;e in which they fight; and rea&s;onable Sati&s;|faction &s;hould be given them that the War is lawful, and the Cau&s;e better than their Lives, which they venture for it. The <HI>Manife&s;tos</HI> of Kings, &s;etting forth the Grounds and Rea&s;ons of their proclaiming War, need be clear and full, as their Commands, requiring their Subjects to engage in it, are plain and perempto|ry. Soldiers are to fight as rational and moral Agents,
<PB N="9" REF="004249_0010_10043A19D19B3B90">and not go forth to the War, <HI>as the Hor&s;e, which hath no Under&s;tanding, ru&s;heth into the Battle.</HI></P>
<P>It may &s;eem as if I had made a long Digre&s;&s;ion at the very Entrance of my Di&s;cour&s;e: But to prove that War may be lawful, was nece&s;&s;ary, and much more is not &s;o, to the evincing the Truth of this Pro|po&s;ition, <HI>viz. That it is the Honour of a Prince, and Safety of a People, to have a competent Number of Sol|diers, ready prepared for War.</HI>&mdash;In handling which Point I &s;hall endeavour,

The Spies returning, &s;pake thus to their Bre|thren, <HI>Ari&s;e, that we may go up again&s;t them.&mdash;Ye &s;hall come to a People &s;ecure&mdash;for God hath given it into your Hand.</HI> And the Children of <HI>Dan</HI> encou|raged by this Report, <HI>came unto Lai&s;h, unto a People that were at Quiet, and &s;ecure, and they &s;mote them with the Edge of the Sword, and burnt the City with Fire.</HI> Six hundred Men with Weapons of War, ob|tain'd an ea&s;y and intire Conque&s;t over that People, which dwelt in a <HI>large Land,</HI> becau&s;e they were &s;o unprepar'd to re&s;i&s;t an Enemy.&mdash;A well-in&s;tructed Militia is the Safety of a People, as &s;uch is mo&s;t likely to &s;top their invading Foes, and turn the Battle to the Gate of their Enemies. They &s;hould not indeed boa&s;t of the Strength and Bravery of their Soldiers, nor confide in the be&s;t military Provi&s;ions for their De|fence: <HI>For the Battle is not</HI> always <HI>to the Strong;</HI> and God, in whom we &s;hould tru&s;t, can &s;ave a People, and
<PB N="22" REF="004249_0023_100439FAA6FB6690">de&s;troy their Enemies, by the weake&s;t and mo&s;t im|probable Means. He can make a little <HI>Barley-Cake</HI> to &s;trike and overturn a <HI>Midianiti&s;h Tent:</HI> And three hundred Men, with no other Weapons than <HI>Trumpets, earthen Pitchers, and Lamps,</HI> to confound and &s;catter a huge Ho&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judg. 7.</NOTE> He can demoli&s;h the &s;tronge&s;t Walls, with the Bla&s;t of Rams-Horns, and the Noi&s;e of People &s;houting, as ea&s;ily as with battering Rams, or roaring Cannons, and ma&s;&s;y Bombs. But if People pretend to rely on God to &s;ave them from their Ene|mies, and fight their Battles, while they are not care|ful to provide for their own Defence, they tempt him rather than tru&s;t in him. The <HI>Sword of the Lord, and of Gideon,</HI> Judg. 7. 8. "The Sword of the <HI>Lord</HI> is all in all to the Succe&s;s of the Sword of <HI>Gideon,</HI> yet the Sword of <HI>Gideon</HI> mu&s;t be employed. Men the In&s;truments, and God the principal Agent, mu&s;t both be con&s;ider'd in their Places". When <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was going to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> he was a&s;&s;ur'd of God's Pre&s;ence with him, yet was enjoyn'd to be <HI>&s;trong, and very couragious.</HI> We &s;hould do our utmo&s;t towards our own Pre&s;ervation and Succe&s;s again&s;t our Enemies, while we tru&s;t in God therefor. It was a brave Speech which <HI>Joab</HI> made at the Head of his Army, when the Front of the Battle was again&s;t him both before and behind, 2 Sam. 10.12. <HI>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People, and for the Cities of our God: and the Lord do that which &s;eemeth him good.</HI> God can &s;ave without Means, or by Means lea&s;t fitted to the End: But 'tis his ordinary way to work by Means, and to work mo&s;t by the apte&s;t Means. A &s;uitable Number therefore of Men, ready prepared for War, are the vi&s;ible Strength and Safety of a People, as well as the Honour of their Prince.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>We may from bence infer, that if a Prince and People con&s;ult their own Honour and Safety, they will be careful to have always a &s;ufficient Number of Men, ready prepared for War.</HI> They will encourage a Mar|tial Spirit, and do what is re&s;pectively incumbent on them, to promote Military Skill and good Order; that the Commonwealth may not be de&s;titute of able and expert Soldiers, who are its Beauty and Defence. There was no War again&s;t <HI>Jebo&s;haphat,</HI> when he took &s;uch Care, and his People concur'd with him in it, to have the Militia in a good Po&s;ture,&mdash;&s;o many thou|&s;and mighty Men of Valour, well-arm'd and di&s;ci|plin'd, ready for Service, whenever there &s;hould be Occa&s;ion. And his Father <HI>A&s;a,</HI> in who&s;e Days the Land had Quiet Ten Years, call'd upon his People to join with him in making a good U&s;e of the Peace they enjoy'd, by fortifying their Cities, arming and training their Soldiers: The Number of which out of <HI>Judah, that bare Targets and Spears, were three bun|dred thou&s;and; and out of Benjamin, that bare Shields, and drew Bows, two hundred and four&s;core thou&s;and: All the&s;e were mighty Men of Valour</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Chrou. 14.</NOTE> And they found the Benefit of having a well-equip'd and power|ful Army; for by it, under God, was di&s;comfited and de&s;troy'd an Ho&s;t of a thou&s;and Thou&s;and, and three hundred Chariots, of the Ethiopians, that came again&s;t them. Prudent States, wi&s;e Kings and Nations, when they &s;heath the Sword, take up the Trowel; and in Time of Peace, prepare for War. In the Country of <HI>Lai&s;h,</HI> where the People dwelt carele&s;s and &s;ecure, till a &s;mall Regiment of <HI>Danites</HI> &s;mote them with the Edge of the Sword, <HI>there was no Magi&s;trate that might put them to Shame in any thing</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judg. 18.7.</NOTE>. The. People were

A neglect of war|like Preparations for their own Defence, is &s;hameful both in Magi&s;trates and People, and often proves the Ruin of both.</P>
<P>Tho' there hath been of late more of a Martial Spirit to be ob&s;erved among us, than was formerly; and &s;omething hath been done in many Places toward the Recovery of Martial Skill, which was almo&s;t lo&s;t; yet it might be humbly a&s;k'd, whether the <HI>Govern|ment</HI> be not wanting to their own Honour, and the People's Safety, in not providing Laws, guarded with &s;everer Penalties than tho&s;e we have at pre&s;ent, to oblige Soldiers to attend the Exerci&s;es, which are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;it them for War? And whether People are not defective in furni&s;hing their Young Men with proper Weapons of War, and encouraging them to learn the dextrous U&s;e of them? And whether that Re&s;pect is paid to tho&s;e, who by a laudable Care and Diligence, have acquir'd Martial Knowledge, do excel in it, and endeavour to propagate it, which is due to Men, who de&s;ire in this Way to honour their King, and &s;erve their Country?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We may hence infer the Duty of Soldiers, to be ready prepared for War.</HI> Since their being &s;o, is the Honour of their Prince, and Safety of their People, their Obligation thereunto is apparent, &s;trong and &s;acred. They &s;hould faithfully endeavour to be &s;o, for Con&s;cience &s;ake twards God, who requires them, and every other Order of Men, to <HI>honour the King,</HI> and &s;eek the publick Safety and Welfare, in which the Glory of God is &s;o much intere&s;ted. 'Tis &s;aid of <HI>Ama&s;iah,</HI> one of the brave Generals, in our Context, that <HI>he willingly offered him&s;elf unto the Lord.</HI> And thus &s;hould every Commander, and private Centinel,
<PB N="25" REF="004249_0026_10043AC0E95DC478">in the Militia do, &s;hould offer him&s;elf, not only to his King, to &s;erve him, and his People; but to the Lord, to glorify him, in the Calling of a Soldier. That his Strength, and Skill, and Courage, and Wea|pons of War; all his Military Accompli&s;hments and Atchievements, may be HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD OF HOSTS. This, according to the Prophecy of <HI>Zechariah,</HI> Chap. 14. Ver&s;. 20. was to be the In&s;cription upon the <HI>Bells of the Hor&s;es,</HI> in the Day of Go&s;pel-Light. It &s;hould be written on the Furniture of War-Hor&s;es, and would be the greate&s;t Ornament to them, and Honour to tho&s;e who ride upon them. Soldiers &s;hould piou&s;ly de&s;ign the Honour of God, in all that they undertake, for the Honour of the King; and aim to &s;erve God, in &s;erving their Country: GOD, THE KING, AND OUR COUNTRY, &s;hould be the Soldiers MOTTO, and animating Word. If Soldiers are endued with a true Principle of Obedience to God, of Loyalty to their Prince, and Love to the Commonwealth, they will con&s;cientiou&s;ly endeavour to be ready prepared for War. Wherefore, I be|&s;eech you, Brethren, who this Day appear in Arms, and all of your Order here pre&s;eat, &s;uffer the Word of Exhortatio;; which may be addre&s;&s;ed,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>To military Officers.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>To private Soldiers.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let military Officers, of every Rank and Deno|mination, faithfully endeavour that they them&s;elves, and all under them, may be ready prepared for War.</HI> Ac|quaint your &s;elves with the Bu&s;ine&s;s of your re&s;pective Po&s;ts, and diligently attend the &s;ame. 'Tis rea&s;onably expected that you, of whom others are to learn War, &s;hould be expert in it your &s;elves: throughly &s;kill'd in all the Exerci&s;es of the Military Art. It is a great Reproach to an In&s;tructer in any Art, when it may be ju&s;tly &s;aid unto him, <HI>Thou therefore which teache&s;t another, teaches;t thou not thy &s;elf?</HI> 'Tis a Di&s;grace to the Militia, when the LEADER of a Company, is
<PB N="26" REF="004249_0027_10043AD65E90B8E8">fit only to be a BRINGER-UP OF THE FRONT-HALF-FILES. Superiour Skill is requi&s;ite for them that are not appointed to teach others. And they &s;hould &s;tudy, and take Pains, that they may be well-accompli&s;h'd <HI>Commanders.</HI>&mdash;When you mu&s;ter and embattail your Troops, let it not be to make a <HI>Show</HI> only; or meerly to divert your &s;elves and others, and beat the Air with Trumpets, Drums and Guns: But let all tho&s;e Exerci&s;es be perform'd, which are ne|ce&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful to in&s;till and increa&s;e Military Knowledge, and make expert and brave Soldiers. The Four Days in a Year allotted for Trainings, may well be &s;pared from other Employments, by tho&s;e who are good Hu&s;bands of their time; and it would be very unrea&s;onable and ab&s;urd in them that are Prodigals of their Time, to complain of this Expence: But 'tis Pity, that tho&s;e Days &s;hould be Days of Vanity, and be wa&s;ted (as they too often are) to little or no good Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>With manly Courage and Prudence exerci&s;e that Authority which, in the &s;everal fit Degrees of Sub|ordination under the CAPTAIN-GENERAL, you are cloathed with. This is nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of good Order, and the promoting of Martial Skill and Valour among the Soldiers. And by a grave Deportment, a &s;teady Conduct, and &s;ingular Expert|ne&s;s in Warlike Exerci&s;es and Affairs, you'll better maintain your Authority, &s;upport the Dignity of your Po&s;ts, and engage the dutiful Re&s;pects of tho&s;e under your Command, than you can do by a &s;trut|ting Gate, big Looks, and domineering Words; yea, than by the greate&s;t Severity of <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> or Expence of <HI>Military Treats.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let private Soldiers get ready prepared for War.</HI> Do not through Pride, or Sloth, or Worldline&s;s, or Di&s;&s;atisfaction, neglect a Duty, which you owe unto God, to your King, and to your Country. The Con|&s;traint of Con&s;cience (without the Coertion of humane
<PB N="27" REF="004249_0028_1004094F089CD198">Laws) &s;hould be effectual, to make you appear at your Colours, on appointed Days of Mu&s;ter, and at|tend the Exerci&s;es, which may fit you for publick Service.&mdash;Guard again&s;t every Thing which may hinder your profiting by &s;uch Means of In&s;truction, and defeat the good End of Trainings. Let there be no Murmurings again&s;t Officers, nor Quarrels among Fellow-Soldiers. Keep your Hearts with Di|ligence; watch your Spirits, that you be not, by the fair Pretences of the envious Sowers of Di&s;cord, and by &s;light Provocations from any, enflam'd into Di&s;|content, Wrath and Wrangling. If you would be thought mighty Men of Valour, betray not &s;uch Weakne&s;s, as to be ea&s;ily conquer'd by your own Pa&s;&s;ions. They that are ungovernable, mutinous, and &s;oon angry, may have little of true martial Fire in them. Good Soldiers have "warm Hearts, and cool Heads.&mdash;<HI>Take heed unto your &s;elves, le&s;t at any time,</HI> (and e&s;pecially when you appear in Arms) <HI>your Hearts be over-charged with &s;urfeiting and Drunkenne&s;s.</HI> If the <HI>Grecian</HI> Combatants to prepare them&s;elves for <HI>Running</HI> or <HI>Cuffing,</HI> were <HI>temperate in all things</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 9.25.</NOTE>; ought not Chri&s;tian Soldiers much more to be &s;o, that they may be prepar'd for War? It is a great Preju|dice to Military Improvements, as well as Reproach to the Chri&s;tian Name, that <HI>Training-Days</HI> are &s;o often followed with di&s;orderly revelling Nights: with Rioting and Drunkenne&s;s, Chambering and Wanton|ne&s;s, Strife and Fighting. For Whoredom and Wine, and new Wine take away the Heart <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;. 4.11.</NOTE>. By &s;erving their Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures, Men con&s;ume their Strength of Body and Mind, and di&s;qualify them&s;elves for the Service of their King and Country. Playing the Fool unfits you to <HI>play the Men</HI> for your People, and the Cities of our God. After you have been in the Field di&s;playing your Martial Strength and Skill, and bran|di&s;hing

<P>I have exhorted tho&s;e of the Military Order to be ready prepared for War, from which the Land hath the&s;e many Years, through the Favour of God, had Re&s;t; and which we pray it always might (tho' we are far from pre&s;uming it always will) have: Let me exhort Per&s;ons of every Order, and Age, and Condition, and Sex, to be al&s;o ready for a War, that is certain and unavoidable.&mdash;A War from which no Relea&s;e can be obtain'd; no Exemption for Men, nor Women; for the Righteous, nor the Wicked; for the High, nor the Low; for the Rich, nor the Poor; nor the Strong, nor the Weak; for the Old, nor the Young; for the mo&s;t bui&s;y; the new-mar|ried; nor the faint-hearted.&mdash;The War was pro|claim'd in Paradi&s;e; it began at the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> and will continue to the End of the World.
