<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>P&s;alm <HI>L. 22.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Now con&s;ider this, ye that forget God, le&s;t I tear you in Pieces, and there be none to deliver.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_REASON, that peculiar Cha|racteri&s;tick of the humane Na|ture by which we are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from, and advanced above, the brutal Herds, was no Doubt de&s;ign'd by its great Parent to di|rect and a&s;&s;i&s;t us to act with Council and Di&s;|cretion in our Elections and pur&s;uits, that we might choo&s;e a <HI>GOOD,</HI> worthy of, and &s;atisfactory to our Nature, and pur&s;ue Mea|&s;ures proper to attain it, not &s;uffering our &s;elves to be impo&s;ed upon by the &s;pecious Appearances of pre&s;ent Objects; but that
<PB N="4" REF="003964_0004_10037B3D3090EC20">we, as intelligent Creatures, would pierce their Natures, and ponder their Events and I&s;&s;ues; accordingly forming our Determina|tion and Choice re&s;pecting them.</P>
<P>It is the Exerci&s;e of this noble Power of Rea&s;on in Meditation and Reflection which the Text before us recommends to our Practi&s;e, in which we have the&s;e two general Heads, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>An important Duty enjoyned.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>An awful Puni&s;hment threatned for the Neglect of it.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t general Head are included the&s;e four following Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Duty it &s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Subject of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Object. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Time of Performance, which is <HI>Now.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Before I proceed father, let me attempt a brief Explication and Illu&s;tration of the&s;e Particulars: And,</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>Duty</HI> enjoyned, which is <HI>Con&s;ideration;</HI> this includes the&s;e three Things following.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Under&s;tanding:</HI> When a Per&s;on in receiving a Me&s;&s;age from God, under&s;tands, both who &s;peaks, and what is
<PB N="5" REF="003964_0005_10035C3038B4CCC8">&s;poken: <HI>Con&s;ider this,</HI> is as much as to &s;ay, <HI>Under&s;tand this;</HI> &s;o <HI>P&s;al,</HI> CXIV. 8. <HI>Under&s;tand ye bruti&s;h among the People, and ye Fools, when will ye be wi&s;e?</HI> So that the Meaning of the World <HI>Con&s;ider,</HI> is that they would &s;eck to know that Being with whom they had to do that he is an infinitely holy, righteous and jealous God, who will not be mocked with fair Shews and Pretences, but will <HI>render to every one according to his Acti|ons,</HI> at lea&s;t in the final Judgment; and al|&s;o that they would labour to know the Na|ture and Importance of the Divine Me&s;&s;ages.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. This Duty of <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> imports, &s;erious and &s;olemn Deliberation, when the mind of God is not only under&s;tood and known, but &s;eriou&s;ly ponder'd and laid to Heart,; when a Per&s;on <HI>communes with his own Heart</HI> about it: What may be the Weight and Importance of the Matter and Me&s;&s;age, what the Advantages of Obedience again&s;t it; this was the P&s;almi&s;t's practice, P&s;. CXIX. 95. <HI>The Wicked have waited for me to de&s;troy me, but I will con&s;i|der thy Te&s;timonies. It is like that of</HI> Jo&s;eph, <HI>how &s;hall I do this Sin and Wickedne&s;s, a|gain&s;t God.</HI> Or of <HI>Job. What then &s;hall I do when God ri&s;eth up, and when he vi|&s;iteth, what &s;hall I an&s;wer him?</HI> Job. XXXI.
<PB N="6" REF="003964_0006_10037B4A397A91B0">14. It was the neglect of this Duty of De|liberation which was the Cau&s;e of God's Controver&s;y with, and complaint over the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> I&s;. XLIV. 19. Jer. VIII. 6. <HI>I hearkned and heard that none con&s;idered in their Hearts to &s;ay,</HI> (why will ye not rea&s;on with your own Souls, and &s;ay, poor Sinners,) <HI>how &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great a Salvation?</HI> And on the contrary, what an unconceivable Happine&s;s &s;hall we be quickly in&s;tated in, if we be willing and obedient? And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. This Duty of Con&s;ideration, imports Submi&s;&s;ion, and Obedience: The Mind of God is then rightly under&s;tood and con&s;i|dered, when it is obey'd, <HI>Ezek.</HI> XVIII. 28. <HI>Becau&s;e he con&s;idereth and turneth away from all his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions that he hath committed, he &s;hall &s;urely live, he &s;hall not die.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Subject</HI> of this Duty: Forgetters of God, it will appear by the Law of Contraries who they are that forget God, by con&s;idering what it is, to remember him. And,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To <HI>remember God</HI> is to entertain him in our Thoughts. So <HI>David</HI> remembred God <HI>upon his Bed,</HI> and <HI>meditated on him in the night Watches.</HI> P&s;. LXIII. 6. Thus God is forgotten when he is ca&s;t out of the
<PB N="7" REF="003964_0007_10037B533160EA38">Thoughts, as it's &s;aid of the wicked, that <HI>God is not in all their Thoughts.</HI> P&s;. X. 4.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To remember God is to depend upon him, and confide in him, for Council and Support in every Difficulty, <HI>P&s;.</HI> XXV. 15. <HI>Mine Eyes are ever towards the Lord, he &s;hall pluck my Feet out of the Net.</HI> Thus the&s;e who tru&s;t in other Things, be&s;ides God and make not him their Strength, forget him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To &s;erve and follow him with an hone&s;t and &s;incere Heart; this is what <HI>Da|vid</HI> gave in Charge to his Son <HI>Solomon and thou</HI> Solomon <HI>my Son, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and &s;erve him with a per|fect Heart, and with a willing Mind.</HI> I Chro. XXVIII. 9. it's in this Re&s;pect that the P&s;al|mi&s;t &s;aid, that his <HI>Heart followed hard after God, and that he was continually with him.</HI> P&s;. LXIII. 8. P&s;. LXXIII. 23. Thus the&s;e may be call'd forgetters of God, who Wor&s;hip him not &s;incerely in the Way of his In&s;titution.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To make him the la&s;t End of all our Actions, &s;o as to intend and direct every Thing towards his Glory. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> X. 31. Thus the&s;e forget God, who go no further in their Aims than them&s;elves.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Object</HI> of <HI>Con&s;ideration. This,</HI> con&s;ider, that God <HI>knows and remembers your Iniquities</HI> however you conceal and forget them; he is <HI>Panopthalmos,</HI> all Eye;
<PB N="8" REF="003964_0008_10037B61B335D918">his Under&s;tanding pierces the thicke&s;t Vail of ob&s;curity, the midnight Darkne&s;s is to him as the Noonday; con&s;ider, Sinners, that as God knows your &s;ecret Impieties, &s;o he will damn you for them, he will <HI>tear you in Pieces,</HI> except you repent, the Terrors of an enraged God, are the mo&s;t proper Ob|jects for &s;ecure Sinners to confider upon; becau&s;e, being &s;elfi&s;h, they are more apt to be influenc'd by Fear than Love.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Time when this Duty is to be performed, is <HI>Now;</HI> now, this Day, this Moment, to Morrow may be too late, and you <HI>torn in Pieces.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I proceed to con&s;ider the &s;econd Ge|neral Head, viz. <HI>the awful Penalty threat|ned again&s;t the Neglecters of the afore&s;aid Duty;</HI> in which are two Things that want Explication, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What it is to be <HI>torn to Pieces.</HI> And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In what Re&s;pects <HI>none &s;hall be able to deliver.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. Let us enquire what is the Meaning of this Phra&s;e, <HI>torn in Pieces.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. More Generally, it Notes an utter and irreparable De&s;truction: It's an awful Me|taphor, taken from a Lion, or Bear's entire|ly devouring it's impotent Prey.</P>
<P N="2">2. More particularly it imports the&s;e three Things.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="9" REF="003964_0009_10037B651A971160">
<ITEM>1. That God will utterly take his Mercy from them if they take no Warning. <HI>I&s;.</HI> XXVII. 11.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That God will deal with them in &s;trict Ju&s;tice, according to the Rigour of his Law, without le&s;&s;ening the lea&s;t Mea&s;ure of their merited puni&s;hment: This is un&s;peakably dreadful; for, <HI>if God marks Iniquity, who can &s;tand? P&s;.</HI> CXXX. 3.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. According to the Power of his Wrath, avenging Jealou&s;y, and Con&s;uming Indigna|tion, of which a Complication of all the Terribles in Nature is but a faint Shadow; for, <HI>who knows the Power of his Anger? P&s;.</HI> XC. 11. <HI>Indignation and Wrath, Tribula|tion and Angui&s;h upon every Soul that doth Evil. Rom.</HI> II. 8, 9.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Again let us enquire in what Sen&s;e it is, <HI>there &s;hall be none to deliver.</HI> The Meaning no Doubt is, That when the decree'd Ven|geance of God comes forth, it will bring a|long with it &s;udden and remedile&s;s De&s;truc|tion; and &s;o there can be <HI>none to deliver</HI> in the&s;e three Re&s;pects.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In Regard of <HI>Gods infinite Power;</HI> &s;o <HI>none</HI> can <HI>deliver out of his Hands. I&s;.</HI> XLIII. 31.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In Re&s;pect of Man's <HI>Weakne&s;s,</HI> who is <HI>cru&s;hed before the Moth;</HI> they can neither by Power or Policy e&s;cape his Cogni&s;ance
<PB N="10" REF="003964_0010_10035C4B6026A2F8">or Vengeance: <HI>He is wi&s;e in Heart and mighty in Strength who has hardned him&s;elf again&s;t him and pro&s;pered. Job</HI> IX. 4.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In Regard of God's Ju&s;tice, he will not admit of any Intreaty in the Day of his An|ger. <HI>Jer.</HI> XIV. 11.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Sum of what has been &s;poken, is briefly this; That while God is upon a Treaty of Peace with Sinners, there is yet a Door of Mercy opened; and therefore that it highly concerns tho&s;e who&s;e have hi|therto forgotten God, in Regard of Know|ledge, Dependance and Service, that they would now, without further Delay, con&s;ider and lay to Heart their pre&s;ent Danger and Mi&s;ery while they have the Offers of Mer|cy, le&s;t they be forever deprived thereof, and expo&s;ed to the Stroaks of his avenging Severity.</P>
<P>From the Words thus explained, we may ob&s;erve the following Truths.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the &s;harpe&s;t Me&s;&s;ages of God to his rebelious People are u&s;ually mixt with gracious Warnings and Entreaties.</HI> The Rea&s;ons why God deals thus with Mankind, are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To &s;hew, <HI>that he hath no Plea&s;ure in their De&s;truction.</HI> Ezek. XXXIII. 11. As al&s;o, to expre&s;s the Greatne&s;s of his Mer|cy and Long-&s;uffering.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="11" REF="003964_0011_10037B708EBF19C8">
2. To work upon the Sinners ingenuity, and keep them from utterly di&s;pairing of his Mercy Ho&s;. XI. 4. 8. <HI>I drew them with Cords of a Man with Bands of Love.</HI> There is a &s;weet Contemperation between Love and Tenderne&s;s in the Invitation and Terror and Authority in the threatning, each a&s;&s;i&s;ts the other in bringing the Sinner to Chri&s;t,; the one guards again&s;t Pre&s;ump|tion, and the other again&s;t Di&s;pair, tho&s;e fatal Ob&s;tructions in the Way to Je&s;us.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To render ob&s;tinate Sinners inexcu&s;a|ble who will take no Warning. <HI>If I had not come, and &s;poken to them, they had not had Sin: But now they have no Cloak for their Sin,</HI> Joh. XV. 22. <HI>This is the Con|demnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men loved Darkne&s;s rather than Light, becau&s;e their Deeds were evil.</HI> John. III. 19.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Then learn.</P>
<P N="1">1. To admire God's Wi&s;dom and Good|ne&s;s in his Dealings with poor Sinners in a Way be&s;t &s;uited to their rational Natures, and mo&s;t effectual either to alarm their Fear, or allure their Love; the&s;e two go|verning Pa&s;&s;ions of the humane Nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. To be overcome by it. O let <HI>the Good|ne&s;s and Patience of God lead you to Re|pentance.</HI> Rom. II. 4. If there be any
<PB N="12" REF="003964_0012_10037B7AB3432758">remains of Ingenuity in you, can you with|&s;tand an intreating God and Saviour!</P>
<P>Some make the fir&s;t Word of our Text, to be an intreating Particle: As if God had &s;aid, <HI>O con&s;ider this!</HI> My Brethren, will not the pa&s;&s;ionate Entreaties of a gracious God, freely tendering Pardon and Pity, after your numberle&s;s Rebellions and cruel Ob&s;tinacies, pierce your adamantine Hearts,! and excite you to accept at la&s;t, <HI>before it be too late,</HI> his merciful Offers and kind Warnings! Hear how the holy God mourns over and expo&s;tulates with Sinners in other Pa&s;&s;ages of &s;acred Writ. <HI>Exod.</HI> XXXIII. 11. <HI>Jer.</HI> IV. 14. <HI>Deut.</HI> V. 29. <HI>O! That there were &s;uch a Heart in them that they wou'd fear me, and keep my Com|mandments, that it might be well with them, and with their Children forever: When &s;hall they be made clean? When &s;hall it once be?</HI> Mu&s;t he not have a Heart harder than poli&s;h'd Bra&s;s that can with&s;tand the&s;e In|treaties! May not the Heavens and <HI>Earth be a&s;toni&s;h'd</HI> at the Stupidity and Ob&s;tinacy of the ungodly World.</P>
<P><HI>Doct.</HI> 2. <HI>That Forgetters of God are in a dangerous State,</HI> every Moment in Hazard of being <HI>torn in Pieces;</HI> their Condition is dangerous in two Re&s;pects.</P>

1. God calls you to it; and will you not obey your Creator? <HI>Hag. I. 5. Now there|fore, thus &s;aith the Lord, con&s;ider your Ways.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3.
