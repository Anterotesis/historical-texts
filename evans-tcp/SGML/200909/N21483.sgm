<P>A DISCOURSE upon Natural Religion in an univer&s;ity profe&s;&s;edly under chri&s;tian in&s;truc|tion, and by a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, appears to &s;ome, if not criminal, yet highly improper. They have an idea that Natural and Revealed Religion are oppo&s;ed to each other, and mutually de&s;tructive. It is a mi&s;taken idea: They are to be conceived rather as different rays of light from the Great Source of Under|&s;tanding, which conjoin to promote the &s;ame mo&s;t valuable de&s;ign&mdash;the information, virtue, and happine&s;s of mankind. The honorable Founder of this Lec|ture had this conception when he e&s;tabli&s;hed it. The Tru&s;tees, who carry into effect his will, and the Uni|ver&s;ity, who introduce the lecturer to their chapel on this occa&s;ion, mean not thereby to weaken religion, but yield her &s;upport.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028238_0004_0FD744C2983BD798">
WE have in the Chri&s;tian Apo&s;tles Paul and Barna|bas a noble in&s;tance of zeal in maintaining a belief in the being and government of God, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential principle of Natural Religion. They were now in Ly&s;tra in Lycaonia, indifferent to their ea&s;e and per|&s;onal &s;afety, could they but be the in&s;truments of en|lightening the ignorant in the nature and obligations of religion and virtue, more fully taught and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the mo&s;t eminent preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s who had ever vi&s;ited mankind. Endued with divine power, that they might the more &s;ucce&s;s|fully effectuate the important ends of their mi&s;&s;ion, they exerted it "on one impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb." They &s;aid to him with a loud voice, "&s;tand upright on thy feet: And he leaped and walked." The inhabitants &s;eeing what Paul had done, were affected with lively admiration; and conceiving the fancied beings above, whom they adored, only capable of &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing acts, "they &s;aid one to another, the gods are come down to us in the likene&s;s of men." This idea made &s;o deep an im|pre&s;&s;ion on their minds, "that they called Barnabas Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, becau&s;e he was the chief &s;peaker. Then the prie&s;t of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done &s;acrifice with the people." Vain and ambitious men would have been mo&s;t highly gratified with the honor of being e&s;teemed the &s;u|preme God, or the interpreter of his will. Yielding to the flattery, they would cheerfully have been crowned with garlands, and permitted hecatombs of bea&s;ts to have been &s;lain in &s;acrifice to their glory. But the&s;e primitive preachers of chri&s;tianity were unea&s;y and &s;ad
<PB N="7" REF="028238_0005_0FD744C3E108D150">with the propo&s;al of honors which became only the great Creator and &s;upreme Governor of the Univer&s;e. Moved with pity and indignation, when they were ac|quainted with their de&s;ign, "they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, &s;irs, why do ye the&s;e things? We al&s;o are men of like pa&s;&s;ions with you, and preach unto you, that ye &s;hould turn from the&s;e vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the &s;ea, and all things that are therein: Who in times pa&s;t &s;uffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Neverthele&s;s he left not him&s;elf without witne&s;s, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling our hearts with food and gladne&s;s."</P>
<P>To repre&s;ent what Rea&s;on, when uncultivated or highly improved, &s;ays upon the important &s;ubjects of religion and morals; and if po&s;&s;ible, brighten and con|firm our faith in its in&s;tructions, is the duty to which I am appointed on this occa&s;ion. In pur&s;uit of this de&s;ign, I a&s;k your patience and candor. I fervently entreat, above all things, the guidance and benediction of the Father of Lights!</P>
<P>UPON the ju&s;t idea of Natural Religion, and the con&s;equences which flow from its maxims, I &s;hall make &s;everal remarks, which I hope will be pertinent and in|&s;tructive. I would ob&s;erve however before I begin, that there is no probability I &s;hall advance a new con|ception upon the&s;e topics. The mo&s;t I can do is to collect within the compa&s;s of a &s;ingle di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;entiments relative to them, which have the mo&s;t powerfully affected my own mind, arranged in a diffe|rent manner, and expre&s;&s;ed in different language. The&s;e truths have been collecting ever &s;ince men began
<PB N="8" REF="028238_0006_0FD744C567430680">to think; they have enlarged as they have continued to think; they would fill volumes were they all prop|erly detailed. Moreover, they form a common fund, from which any one may take the truths he under&s;tands, and can intelligibly explain, a&s;&s;ured he makes no fur|ther u&s;e of the opinions of his predece&s;&s;ors and contem|poraries, than they have made of theirs. Indeed it may be truly &s;aid, there is &s;carcely a que&s;tion in Natural Religion, which doth not frequently ari&s;e in the minds of well educated, and thinking per&s;ons, to which they do not return &s;ome of tho&s;e different an&s;wers which are diffu&s;ed through innumerable books.</P>
<P>WHAT IS NATURAL RELIGION? To this inquiry, an&s;wers will be made, differing with the char|acters of tho&s;e who make them. The improved part of mankind, during modern periods mo&s;t famed for lite|rary excellence, hath been divided into two grand &s;ects, the friends and the oppo&s;ers of Revelation. According to this di&s;tinction, they have given oppo&s;ite explana|tions of Natural Religion. The friend of Revelation a&s;&s;erts that a complete code of this Religion contains all the truths relative to GOD, his nature, perfections, and government&mdash;to man, his nature, duty, and expec|tations, which may be illu&s;trated and confirmed by ra|tional inquiry and argumentation. Nor does he think him&s;elf chargeable with impropriety in calling this col|lection of truths Natural Religion, though many of its important principles have been made known to him by Revelation; principles, which have enabled him to think to an extent, and write with a &s;trength of con|viction upon the&s;e intere&s;ting &s;ubjects, which, if he had been left to his own una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on, would have been impo&s;&s;ible. In his opinion, the doctrines of Revela|tion,
<PB N="9" REF="028238_0007_0FD744C88F1632A8">when explained and rendered more credible by the efforts of the human mind, become parts of Natu|ral Religion.</P>
<P>IMPRESSED with the&s;e ideas, many who de&s;erve the &s;tyle of the friends of Revelation, have applied their time, and all the energy of great abilities, to confirm by rational argumentation the principles of piety, virtue, and moral obligation; as well as the propriety of ex|pecting a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence and retribution. The Lecture founded in England by Sir Robert Boyle, the ornament of his age, of religion, philo&s;ophy, and literature, brought forth a large li&s;t of eminent writers, who in their immortal performances explained and defended the truths of Natural and Revealed Religion.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent Lecture was e&s;tabli&s;hed, no doubt, by Judge Dudley, our re&s;pectable countryman, in imita|tion of the one which has been mentioned. A proof, among&s;t a multitude of others agreeable to our feelings, that Americans have beeen ready to follow, in laudable and beneficial in&s;titutions, the elder and more wealthy inhabitants of Europe!</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t celebrated Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;tianity have, in their more private di&s;cour&s;es, exerted their ingenuity and learning to promote the ends of the&s;e public in|&s;titutions. Several in civil life, and in the other learned profe&s;&s;ions, have employed fine powers of mind in the promotion of the &s;ame good cau&s;e. To this meritori|ous &s;ervice they have been animated, not only by their unfeigned regard to &s;acred truth, but by the prejudice of unbelievers again&s;t Clergymen, as the hired &s;upporters of religion. However ill-founded and ungenerous the imputation, yet it has ever de&s;erved the attention of the friends of religious truth univer&s;ally. Tho&s;e of them,
<PB N="10" REF="028238_0008_0FD744D2D7822488">who paying it the re&s;pect they ought, have laid a&s;ide their more peculiar offices, and employed &s;ome of their time, and the vigor of their abilities, in a de&s;ign &s;o truly valuable, de&s;erve the &s;incere thanks of the wi&s;e and good.</P>
<P>AMONGST tho&s;e of this cla&s;s, who have appeared within a few years pa&s;t, Mon&s;ieur Necker, the great Financier of France, is highly to be e&s;teemed and admired. He &s;aw, with deep regret, that the principles of an impious philo&s;ophy, rendered per&s;ua&s;ive with the graces of good compo&s;ition, and all the ingenuity of which the cau&s;e was capable, threatened &s;erious evils to that beautiful and powerful empire. Its latent venom had already weakened in many per&s;ons the firmne&s;s of their religious faith, and its powerful motives to u&s;eful and excellent conduct in every relation of life. Yea, it threatened that general di&s;&s;olutene&s;s in principles and manners, which, unle&s;s counteracted, threatens the body politic with terrible convul&s;ions and gradual de&s;truction. Removed from the bu&s;ine&s;s and plea&s;ures of court by one of tho&s;e revolutions not unu&s;ual in that &s;ituation, and amid&s;t the tranquillity and gloom of retirement, he does not meanly re&s;ign him&s;elf to the &s;ad feelings of mortification, but nobly re&s;olved to apply a remedy to the growing infidelity of the nation in which he had been &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed. He gave to the world his thoughts "ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RELIGIOUS OPINIONS;" a work of the fir&s;t celebrity on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting que&s;tions; which, with all the &s;trength of powerful rea&s;oning, has tho&s;e charms of language and fancy which affect the heart, and render it peculiarly adapted to per&s;uade, as well as in&s;truct. The young and gay, together with tho&s;e who move in the higher
<PB N="11" REF="028238_0009_0FD744D534081568">circum&s;tances of life, cannot be under better human guidance, than when, with teachable di&s;po&s;itions, they are attentive to his in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>THE oppo&s;ers of Revelation, though they do not agree among&s;t them&s;elves in their explanation of Natural Religion, yet agree in rejecting the repre&s;entation of it which has now been made. Some of their mo&s;t re|&s;pectable writers a&s;&s;ert Natural Religion to be an in|heritance which mankind receive equally from the God who made them; that their Creator and &s;overeign Lord has enlightened their under&s;tandings univer&s;ally with a complete &s;y&s;tem of religion and moral obligation, and therefore that they need no further divine or human in&s;truction on the &s;ubject. If this account were ju&s;t, we might rea&s;onably expect in the department of religion, that we &s;hould be neither dependent on in|&s;truction nor &s;tudy for information in any of its branches. We might, without he&s;itation, conclude we &s;hould, as we met together, without any di&s;tinction of character, conver&s;e with as much readine&s;s and preci&s;ion upon its doctrines, precepts, and motives, as well-taught natural philo&s;ophers do upon the laws which govern this divi&s;ion of creation. In our &s;tudies, we may form in our conception a con&s;i&s;tent plan of this nature, and &s;upport it with arguments, which we e&s;teem honorable to God, and flattering to man. Is not God, &s;ay we, <HI>impartially</HI> ju&s;t and good? Will not his creatures then of the &s;ame rank <HI>equally</HI> participate of his bounties? How can He, with any propriety of character, make di&s;tinctions between them, plea&s;ing on the one &s;ide, and painful on the other? Is not the knowledge of re|ligion a <HI>common</HI> concern of mankind; equally as nece&s;|&s;ary to the improvement, honor, and happine&s;s of all
<PB N="12" REF="028238_0010_0FD744D8E1F8F5E0">our race, as of any particular nations or per&s;ons? Mu&s;t it not then, under his equal and beneficent govern|ment, be communicated <HI>alike</HI> to all? But when we en|ter the world, and compare the real &s;tate of man with what this &s;cheme of thought would lead us to conclude it mu&s;t be, we &s;hall be convinced it is altogether un|&s;ub&s;tantial. For the more we ob&s;erve, the more indu|bitable it will appear to us, that our improvement in this, as in other kinds of knowledge, depends upon nat|ural abilities, &s;ituation, and the means we enjoy of in|formation; with re&s;pect to which circum&s;tances, the children of men greatly differ from each other. Do we ever find that tho&s;e who have been denied the ble&s;&s;ings of education, of in&s;tructive books and conver&s;ation, or have had no lei&s;ure from the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of life for application and &s;tudy, can conceive &s;o exten&s;ively upon the &s;ubjects of religion, and conver&s;e &s;o correctly upon them, as tho&s;e who have been favored with the&s;e advantages? No; there is, and ever will be, a remark|able difference between them. Is it not ridiculous to &s;ay, the prie&s;t of Jupiter had as enlarged &s;entiments and well-informed notions of God, and the &s;ervices due to him, who would have paid divine honors to deified men, as the chri&s;tian apo&s;tles, who taught that they &s;hould turn from idolatrous wor&s;hip unto the living God, who made heaven, and earth, the &s;ea, and all things that are therein? That Cicero, who applied his admirable powers of mind to gain the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and correct knowledge of religion and laws he was able, had no fuller and better ideas of them than the mo&s;t unin&s;tructed Roman? That Dr. Clarke, with his pene|trating mind and laborious &s;tudy applied to the &s;ubjects of religion and morals, was not better acquainted with them than a Hottentot?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="028238_0011_0FD744E376535D28">
MANY &s;en&s;ible men of this cla&s;s, convinced that this idea of Natural Religion is untenable, have adopted the following; that Natural Religion con&s;i&s;ts of all tho&s;e divine and moral di&s;coveries which man is able to make by the una&s;&s;i&s;ted efforts of his rea&s;on alone. The reply made to this &s;cheme is, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to know, amid&s;t the variety of religious and moral truths which man conceives, in the great variety of &s;ituations in which he is placed on earth, what number of them have their &s;ource from unaided rea&s;on; con&s;equently, whether in this view there is any &s;uch thing as Natural Religion. Were we to employ our&s;elves to &s;eparate tho&s;e truths of a religious nature, which derive to us from tradition, remote revelation, or the hints and di|rect conver&s;ation of others grounded ultimately upon the&s;e, from tho&s;e decidedly otherwi&s;e, we &s;hould find our&s;elves engaged in a difficult and un&s;atisfactory ta&s;k. We &s;hould by this proce&s;s be fully convinced, that we could not certainly affirm of any of them, that they were the offspring of our intellectual exertions alone, that our apprehen&s;ion of them was not owing more nearly or remotely to &s;ugge&s;tions and aids from God. Mankind begin to learn of each other from infancy. Nations learn of nations. One age is in&s;tructed by another age. There is a mo&s;t intimate connexion be|tween men, and dependence upon each other with re|&s;pect to religious and moral di&s;coveries, as there is in almo&s;t every thing el&s;e. Perhaps of any object of this kind of knowledge, after a due con&s;ideration, and with a proper &s;pirit of inquiry, we &s;hould be unwilling to &s;ay, this is a truth for which I am &s;olely indebted to my own under&s;tanding, without any obligation to revelations from God. It will have an influence upon our minds
<PB N="14" REF="028238_0012_0FD744EB8CB480A0">favorable to truth, when in this cour&s;e of thought, to in|quire, why &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated ancient philo&s;o|phers travelled to the regions where, in the opinions of Jews and Chri&s;tians, divine revelation began to di&s;play its light, if they felt not the need of in&s;truction beyond the unaided efforts of their own minds? Why, after the publi&s;hment of Chri&s;tianity, the heathen writers appear to have more con&s;i&s;tent ideas of God, and the wor&s;hip which we owe him; and of morals, together with a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence and equal retribution, than they ever publi&s;hed before? Why, &s;ince the in|troduction of the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian &s;criptures, into the world, with liberty to read them without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing pains and penalties, our religious knowledge has been &s;o much more increa&s;ed, and our motives to worthy and good conduct &s;o much more &s;trengthened and improved?</P>
<P>Is not this then the only con&s;i&s;tent and defen&s;ible definition which can be given of Natural Religion? NATURAL RELIGION con&s;i&s;ts of all tho&s;e truths, rela|tive to God, his being, perfections, and government; to man, his duty, his motives to action, and expecta|tions, let the fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion of them to our minds ari&s;e from whatever &s;ource it may, which we can in any degree apprehend, illu&s;trate, and confirm by ra|tional argumentation. I know not how the oppo&s;ers or the friends of Revelation can object to this definition completely. It meets in part with the conception of both of them. The fir&s;t &s;ay, Denying wholly the idea of any religious light from God but by the exerci&s;e of our intelligent powers, that all the truths of religion and morality with which we are acquainted, become known to us, as &s;oon as we arrive at the age of mature thought and manly action, without any incidence to
<PB N="15" REF="028238_0013_0FD744EC63192B20">mi&s;take; or, that the mo&s;t excellent in&s;tructions of re|ligion and virtue are only principles, which have been di&s;covered in one period of time by the human mind, and improved upon in another, until they have arrived to their pre&s;ent degree of perfection. Chri&s;tian writers take the principles of Revelation, enlarge upon them, illu&s;trate and confirm them by long chains of rea&s;oning in their writings, and &s;tyle them Natural Religion.</P>
<P>PERMIT me now to make &s;everal ob&s;ervations which have an intimate connexion with this &s;ubject. The fir&s;t is,</P>
<P N="1">I. WE may be fully per&s;uaded of truth in &s;ubjects, which far exceed our adequate comprehen&s;ion. We a&s;&s;ume it as a principle with re&s;pect to all effects with|in human power, that they mu&s;t have a cau&s;e equal to their production. Experience and ob&s;ervation &s;o early, &s;o con&s;tantly, and powerfully teach us this principle, that it &s;eems to us as a &s;elf-evident maxim of rea&s;on and truth. To the &s;ame principle we recur with confidence when we would rationally account for the exi&s;tence and pre&s;ervation of the univer&s;e of being. Yet when we contemplate the cau&s;e of the&s;e greater effects, we are convinced <HI>he</HI> e&s;&s;entially differs from the inferior cau&s;es with which we are more familiarly acquainted. To the inquiry, Who created, and upholds the things which are &s;een, and believed by us to exi&s;t, though not &s;een? We an&s;wer, An intelligent being, &s;elf-originated and independent, uncau&s;ed him&s;elf, and yet the cau&s;e of every thing el&s;e. But why, you a&s;k, are we obliged to embrace a conclu&s;ion &s;o incomprehen&s;ible to our minds, and which confounds our mo&s;t convincing modes of rea&s;oning? The reply is, After the fulle&s;t in|ve&s;tigation of the &s;ubject of creation and pre&s;ervation,
<PB N="16" REF="028238_0014_0FD744EF689A0718">this &s;eems the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory method of accounting for them. Till we have arrived to this grand and &s;ingular Being, we have not in our conception obtained the ultimate and &s;ufficient cau&s;e of all things; for though in our a&s;cent to Him, we pa&s;s through a long &s;eries of cau&s;es, yet each one of them requires a cau&s;e of its own origin, and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In Him alone do our minds re&s;t ea&s;y as the univer&s;al Parent, the con&s;tant Pre&s;erver of all things, "who is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting, the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to-day, and forever, without any variablene&s;s or &s;hadow of turning." Says an inquirer to an Indian philo&s;opher, upon what re&s;ts the world? He an&s;wers, upon an elephant. But upon what, a&s;ks the inquirer, &s;tands the elephant? He re|plies, upon the back of a tortoi&s;e. But upon what, continues the inquirer, &s;tands the tortoi&s;e? He made no further reply; nor was it worth while; for if he had mentioned ten thou&s;and &s;upporters, which needed &s;upport them&s;elves, &s;till the inquirer would have a&s;ked, but upon what &s;tands this? Nor would he have cea&s;ed a&s;king the &s;ame que&s;tion, until he had mentioned &s;ome|thing which had appeared to his mind a <HI>&s;ub&s;tratum,</HI> equal to the &s;upport of every thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT the ultimate and &s;upreme Cau&s;e of all things &s;hould be conceived intelligent, is mo&s;t rea&s;onable. For wherever we look, we &s;ee means connected with ends; &s;implicity and art; order, beauty, and magnifi|cence. The&s;e our ob&s;ervation and experience con|vince us are not the offspring of undirected motion, or of chance and nece&s;&s;ity, but of an intelligent and de|&s;igning Mind. From this Being we take all the im|perfections, weakne&s;&s;es, and corruptions of man, and a&s;cribe to him almighty power, perfect intelligence,
<PB N="17" REF="028238_0015_0FD744EF7A153B70">omnipre&s;ence, omni&s;cience, in&s;inite benevolence, and immutable rectitude. Our minds are too &s;mall-&s;ized to admit an adequate idea of the&s;e perfections, which form his &s;upreme excellency. Yet we are led to be|lieve them attributes of his divine nature by &s;hort and powerful rea&s;onings.</P>
<P>WHAT can re&s;train his power through the whole cour&s;e of po&s;&s;ibilities, who gave to intelligent and in|animate cau&s;es throughout the univer&s;e their whole energy, who controuls, &s;u&s;pends, and enervates them at his plea&s;ure? What addition can be made to that Mind, which is the parent of all other minds, from the feeble&s;t to the mo&s;t exalted? Is not the a&s;&s;ertion, that a being can act where he is not, mo&s;t ab&s;urd? Mu&s;t not He then be every where pre&s;ent, who ani|mates and &s;u&s;tains univer&s;al nature? Have we not de|cided evidence that the Author of our exi&s;tence is good? With but few exceptions, our race have more health than &s;ickne&s;s, and more ea&s;e than pain. The evils they &s;uffer are frequently medicinal, and in event ble&s;&s;ings. They may, by di&s;cretion and well-directed labors, render their &s;ituation much more eligible and happy than it &s;ometimes proves. Still it is imperfect, and abounds with &s;orrows. We can conceive it within the power of God to grant us worth and plea&s;ure far &s;uperior to what we po&s;&s;e&s;s here. We &s;ee no rea&s;ons in his character which &s;hould di&s;incline him to an improve|ment of our circum&s;tances, agreeable to our wi&s;hes, in coming periods of exi&s;tence: When we think mo&s;t &s;oberly, we find many probabilities, which &s;erve to con|vince us he will. A conception that a Being thus perfect can ever be mi&s;taken, ill-di&s;po&s;ed, or &s;ail doing in every &s;ituation what is ab&s;olutely be&s;t, is groundle&s;s.</P>

THESE principles have been enlarged upon by many acute writers in our own, as well as foreign languages: and have produced a firm belief of the prime truths of Natural Religion in minds not le&s;s penetrating than their own. I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">II. THE UTILITY of the principles of Natural Religion is a con&s;iderable confirmation of their truth. Utility, it is acknowledged, when partial, may be no proof of truth in principles, or propriety in actions. Principles the mo&s;t indefen&s;ible and pernicious, may aid our &s;ucce&s;s at times in the acqui&s;ition of honor and profit; and pre&s;erve us ea&s;y and cheerful within, when we ought to feel all the &s;adne&s;s of remor&s;e, and the affliction of guilt. But when principles and motives have a permanent good influence on our worth and enjoyment on the whole, they then have the utility, which we &s;hould prize as invaluable; they then have the approving &s;eal of the Author of Nature upon them, teaching us they are principles which he would have us e&s;teem his &s;acred will, and reverence and obey as his edicts. Is not this mo&s;t evidently the ca&s;e with the maxims and motives of Natural Religion? Do not legi&s;lators, who have the mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly contemplated the cau&s;es of national &s;afety and pro&s;perity, point out obedience to them as the be&s;t calculated means of public &s;ecurity, reputation, and honor? Do they not with a&s;&s;urance foretel the gradual declen&s;ion and ruin of tho&s;e &s;tates and empires, which with ob&s;tinate per|&s;everance de&s;pi&s;e and violate them? Our rea&s;on, ex|perience, and ob&s;ervation prove that we cannot as private per&s;ons too highly venerate, too carefully culti|vate and obey the&s;e principles, if we wi&s;h our rectitude and happine&s;s. They &s;olemnly warn us again&s;t di&s;|obedience
<PB N="19" REF="028238_0017_0FD744F98444BA48">to them as a fruitful &s;ource of painful remor&s;e and probable ruin. Sober-minded and &s;en&s;ible indi|viduals, together with enlightened and virtuous poli|ticians, have ever declared with the Jewi&s;h prophet, "the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s is peace; the effect of righteou&s;ne&s;s, quietne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance &s;orever." I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3">III. THE capacity of religious knowledge which belongs to human creatures. All mankind, no doubt, wherever their habitations are appointed them on earth, have &s;ome degree of this capacity. But in this re&s;pect there is a great difference between them; a difference, which will be &s;maller or greater in proportion to the combined influence of three different cau&s;es&mdash;the natural &s;trength of their minds, the indu&s;try with which they improve them, and the favorablene&s;s of their &s;ituation for &s;uch inve&s;tigations. There can be no doubt that men differ greatly from each other in the natural &s;trength and capaciou&s;ne&s;s of their minds, in con&s;e|quence of which, though they are equally indu&s;trious, they will make a different degree of progre&s;s in their acquaintance with religious truth. How oppo&s;ed in &s;trength of intellect, and their circum&s;tances of im|provement in divine and moral &s;cience, are tho&s;e in the mo&s;t unin&s;tructed and di&s;advantageous circum&s;tan|ces of human nature, when compared with tho&s;e who have high mental abilities, united with the be&s;t advan|tages of education, conver&s;ation, and books, to render them acquainted with the doctrines of piety and virtue? Between the&s;e extremes, there is, as in light, a gradual change from a &s;mall degree of illumination to the full &s;plendor of day. Moreover, there is an ob&s;ervable differ|ence of capacity between tho&s;e in the &s;ame general &s;itu|ation:
<PB N="20" REF="028238_0018_0FD744FF73331610">And, among&s;t tho&s;e who are in like circum&s;tan|ces, &s;ome improve their abilities far better than others.</P>
<P>THE only an&s;wer we can make tho&s;e who inquire, why this con&s;titution of things has taken place, is, "It is &s;o, O Father, becau&s;e &s;o it hath &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight." Exi&s;tence is his free and unde&s;erved gift, which he may grant to any number of beings at the time he plea&s;es, accompanied with more or fewer abilities of worth and enjoyment. All the claim his creatures have upon him is, that he &s;hould not appoint them an over|balance of &s;uffering, without voluntary ill behavior and guilt upon their &s;ide. Further, the future &s;tate of life, which we hope for, and which the rea&s;onings of our minds render probable, give room for the mo&s;t perfect adju&s;tment of any inequalities which have taken place in this condition of exi&s;tence. "The judge of all the Earth will do right." I ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="4">IV. THAT Natural and Revealed Religion are &s;o far from being oppo&s;ed, that they mutually &s;trengthen each other. REVELATION is &s;trictly a &s;y&s;tem of dogmatical in&s;truction in tho&s;e points which relate to our faith, duty, and future expectations. Its authority does not depend upon any rea&s;onings inter&s;per&s;ed with its decla|rations, but upon the evidence we have that God him|&s;elf has thus taught us, and commanded us. For ex|ample: When we are in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian &s;crip|tures, that we &s;hall ri&s;e from the dead hereafter, and live in a &s;tate of perfect retribution, if we believe the information upon the ground of Revelation, we do not believe it becau&s;e of any argumentations which may attend it, for we &s;hould be bound to believe the &s;ame, was it unattended with them. We believe only upon this ground, becau&s;e God has taught us our future ex|i&s;tence
<PB N="21" REF="028238_0019_0FD71F692F511538">and accountability. As mere natural religion|i&s;ts, our conduct is different. In this character we receive no a&s;&s;ertion as an object of faith, or direction as a command of duty, which we are not able by rational proce&s;s to prove &s;o, either probably or indi&s;putably. Yet in the&s;e two characters, notwith&s;tanding we are firm believers in Revelation, and enjoy its be&s;t advan|tages, we always exi&s;t in this &s;tate. Hence we may clearly perceive how Natural Religion and Revelation &s;hould be friendly in their influence upon each other. The firme&s;t believer in Chri&s;tianity &s;eeks to render his faith more firm, than the evidence of te&s;timony can alone render it, by rational illu&s;tration and argument. When by analogies, facts, and inferences from allowed premi&s;es, he can explain, and corroborate the doctrines or precepts of his religion, his doubts le&s;&s;en, and he e&s;teems it more worthy his cordial acceptation and &s;teady &s;upport. In this way there has been a mo&s;t re&s;pectable di&s;play of human abilities, by the friends of Revelation, in an&s;wer to its oppo&s;ers.</P>
<P>WHAT unbeliever, who has read their writings with the candor and attention they de&s;erve, but will acknow|ledge his prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions again&s;t the religion of Chri&s;t are much le&s;s than they were before? Where is the Chri&s;tian who will refu&s;e to own his mind has been in&s;tructed, and faith &s;trengthened by their labors? The direct in|fluence of Revelation to illu&s;trate and confirm the truths of Natural Religion none can di&s;pute; for in plain terms it teaches all its great doctrines and precepts; and e&s;tabli&s;hes them by evidence which it had not be|fore, but which is in it&s;elf powerful evidence.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations I have thought fit to make upon the &s;ubject of Natural Religion. I hope they will be
<PB N="22" REF="028238_0020_0FD74503C1414A00">e&s;teemed pertinent to the &s;ubject&mdash;and may be u&s;eful. I &s;hall &s;ay no more, but conclude with an addre&s;s to the young gentlemen, the &s;tudents, in this UNIVERSITY.</P>
<P>YE are here placed in a healthy and delightful &s;itua|tion by the care and indulgence of your parents. The Governors and In&s;tructors of this Society afford you excellent means of acquiring the habits of regularity and order, and of laying a foundation for u&s;eful and eminent progre&s;s in divine and human knowledge. Ye are indeed like trees planted by rivers of water, in a climate mo&s;t favorable to their nouri&s;hment and growth. How di&s;graced mu&s;t ye be, and de&s;erving of neglect and puni&s;hment, if ye fail to be richly laden with the invaluable fruits of u&s;eful and ornamental lit|erature, of religion and virtue; of abilities actively im|proved to increa&s;e public and private &s;ecurity and happine&s;s!</P>
<P>BUT upon this occa&s;ion, and peculiarly in our cir|cum&s;tances, I would entreat you by motives the mo&s;t &s;acred and intere&s;ting to your&s;elves, and the &s;ociety of which you will &s;oon be active and important members, mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly to &s;tudy the evidences of Natural Re|ligion, and the obligations of virtue, the influence of which, when &s;teadily believed, mu&s;t be highly beneficial.</P>
<P>WE who have pa&s;&s;ed the meridian of life, and have entered upon the evening of our days, mu&s;t &s;oon clo&s;e them. Ye will ari&s;e in our &s;tead; and take our places! The principles of Religion, when firmly be|lieved, form not only an active cau&s;e of that integrity which rewards us per&s;onally with peace of mind, and prepares us for better &s;cenes of being hereafter; but of all that promotes public tranquillity, order, and felicity, of all that adorns and improves &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="028238_0021_0FD745065FE3C5C8">
IT is particularly ob&s;erved by writers on the cau&s;es of the ri&s;e and declen&s;ion of &s;tates, their pro&s;perity and &s;ufferings, that &s;tates under &s;uch a form of government as ours, and which need &s;o great a degree of tempe|rance, order, and indu&s;try, to &s;et all the cau&s;es of na|tional pro&s;perity and &s;plendor in &s;ucce&s;sful motion, mu&s;t be indebted for them principally to the di&s;&s;emi|nation of u&s;eful knowledge, and the lively influence of a religious faith, productive of genuine fruits. When they contemplate us irreligious, intemperate, ignorant, di&s;orderly, and idle, they exclaim in tones of extreme grief, Alas, our country! Thou art lo&s;t to whatever is good, and great. Thou art degraded, and making continual progre&s;s towards overthrow and de&s;truction!</P>
<P>IN the&s;e principles, we who have lived befor you, were early educated. In&s;truction and general example tended to give them the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion with us at the period of life, when human creatures are taught with the mo&s;t ea&s;e and &s;ucce&s;s. Not have di&s;tingui&s;h|ed events happened in the world, which might render them le&s;s venerable in our view, and le&s;s efficacious on our conduct, till &s;ince we have arrived to an age not given to change.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is different with you at the mo&s;t hazardous time of your lives, when you are mo&s;t apt to learn, and receive impre&s;&s;ions. The &s;ubjects of religion are now more freely conver&s;ed upon&mdash;it has cea&s;ed to be high|ly di&s;reputable to attack them&mdash;it has become, in a degree, fa&s;hionable to treat them with le&s;s reverence, and to di&s;regard the &s;tricte&s;t commands of piety and virtue, as preci&s;e and &s;uper&s;titious. The Rulers of France, even to who&s;e errors we are indulgent, have, in an eager pur&s;uit after Civil Liberty, &s;een fit to hum|ble
<PB N="24" REF="028238_0022_0FD7450A86B08640">Religion to a very degraded &s;tate. Yield not your under&s;tandings or hearts to either of the&s;e cau&s;es, not|with&s;tanding all the charms of novelty, and the per|&s;ua&s;ions of inclination! Such loo&s;e and immoral &s;enti|ments, propagated and embraced here, would disfigure the &s;tructures of Natural and Revealed Religion, which have been hitherto &s;o highly revered by us, and &s;o ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the ornament of our country, our ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing. They would introduce habits and manners, which would be exceedingly hurtful to individual vir|tue and excellence, to the ri&s;ing &s;trength and glory of our REPUBLIC!</P>
<P>BESEECH the in&s;piration and guidance of the great Source of truth, purity, and love! Live under the con|&s;tant influence of the &s;acred principles of religion and virtue, which you enjoy in the highe&s;t &s;tate of im|provement! Recommend them by your in&s;tructions and examples, after you have entered the world, to all around you! The&s;e principles, when duly cheri&s;hed by you, will reward you with e&s;teem and honor from the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of mankind! They will ble&s;s you with approbation and peace of mind, more pre|cious than rubies, and every thing el&s;e you can de&s;ire! They will afford you the &s;weete&s;t con&s;olation in the dark hours of adver&s;ity, and lighten up the valley of the &s;hadow of death! They will introduce you to the patronage and ble&s;&s;ing of the great Creator and Lord of the Univer&s;e: To whom be glory and honor, for|ever and ever.</P>
