<HEAD>To the <HI>YOUTH</HI> of the <HI>ACADEMY,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BEING advi&s;ed that the Publication of the fol|lowing Di&s;cour&s;e might be of &s;ome U&s;e, I believe the Propriety of this Addre&s;s to you will be rea|dily acknowledged. The Reflections contained in it poured them&s;elves upon my Mind on the Death of One, who but a few Days ago bore a Part in all your Studies and Diver&s;ions, and enjoyed a Share of Health, Strength and Spirits inferior to none of you. As you all knew and loved him;&mdash;as I beheld many of you weeping over his Grave, I am inclined to think the MORAL of his <HI>Death</HI> will be acceptable to you at lea&s;t, however un|favorably grave and &s;erious Subjects are generally re|ceived by People of your Years.</P>
<P>YOUR own Experience now convinces you that you hold your Lives on a very uncertain Tenure, and that no Period of your Age is exempted from the common Lot of Mortality. Hence every wi&s;e Per&s;on, young or old, mu&s;t think it his grand Concern to be always pre|pared to meet Death. As for you, who are yet under the Direction of others, if you behave &s;o as to merit the E&s;teem of your Parents, In&s;tructors, and good Men that you are conver&s;ant with, you need not doubt of merit|ing al&s;o the Love of <HI>God in Chri&s;t.</HI> Thus, however early your Summons from Life may be, you &s;hall nei|ther <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> unprepared nor unlamented.</P>
<P>THO' perhaps there is not a more affecting Incident in this World than the Death of a hopeful Youth, libe|rally educated, and ju&s;t &s;tepping into a Life of <HI>hone&s;t Ac|tion,</HI> yet tho&s;e can never be &s;aid to have died untimely, or to have lived in vain, who leave &s;uch an amiable Cha|racter behind them, as your decea&s;ed School-fellow did.</P>
<P>THAT he truly de&s;erved the E&s;teem he enjoyed I can vouch from Experience. He grew up under me. With Plea&s;ure I marked his gradual Improvements. My high|e&s;t Hopes were fixed upon him. To me he never was
<PB REF="007318_0003_102B577A9D6DE3C8">
once wanting in Duty or Affection, and I returned him my warme&s;t Regard. By a like Conduct you may com|mand a like E&s;teem from your In&s;tructors, tho' I hope, none of us &s;hall ever be called to give a like public Te|&s;timony of it towards any of you.</P>
<P>AS &s;uch a Te&s;timony of Love to the Decea&s;ed, a Good-natur'd Reader will candidly receive the following Sermon. If there is any Merit in it, I would a&s;cribe it wholly to the Influence of the Subject; for &s;uch was my Indi&s;po&s;ition in Body as well as Spirits, during the very &s;hort Time I had to prepare it in, that if it had not been to ea&s;e a full Heart, I was incapable of writing at all. I do not, however, offer want of Time as any Apology for the Performance. It is my Opinion that much Correction, or indeed any Change that I could make, either in the Language or Method, would be for the wor&s;e. I followed the Train of Rea&s;oning which the Text pointed out, and which naturally offered it&s;elf to my Mind; and were I to &s;ee a Di&s;cour&s;e artfully ranged into <HI>Heads,</HI> divided and &s;ubdivided, I &s;hould hardly be per&s;uaded that it had been dictated or in&s;pired by real Grief.</P>
<P>I AM obliged to &s;ome among you for the affectionate Ver&s;es &s;ent me on this Occa&s;ion. I thought the greate&s;t Honor I could do, either to them or my&s;elf, was to pre|fix them, together with your Names; con&s;cious that &s;o much Tenderne&s;s and Goodne&s;s of Heart, manife&s;ted by Per&s;ons &s;o young as you are, might attone for far greater Faults than any of you can well fall into. With Regard to the <HI>Critics,</HI> if we have any &s;uch, I wi&s;h them &s;omething better worthy of their Animadver&s;ions than this pious Collection of our Tears. The Man who can refrain from publi&s;hing his Grief, till he can do it in all the Elegance of Language and Sentiment, may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected to have felt no real Grief. To lo&s;e a fair Opportunity of Action, thro' too &s;crupulous a Regard to Reputation, is mean and &s;elfi&s;h; and therefore whatever Merit we may claim as Writers, I hope we &s;hall always, as at pre&s;ent, have the &s;uperior Merit of &s;hewing our&s;elves warm for our Friends, tender in our Natures, and ready to em|brace every Opportunity of doing Good.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PSALM xlii. 6.</HI> O my God! my Soul is ca&s;t down within me, there|fore will I remember Thee&mdash;</HEAD>
<P>IT is elegantly &s;aid by the Author of the Book of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Job</HI> v. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Job,</HI> who &s;eems to have experienced all the dire Vici&s;&s;itudes of Fortune,&mdash;"That Man is born to Troubles, as the Sparks fly up|wards."&mdash;The&s;e Troubles, however, as he further ob&s;erves, &s;erve the wi&s;e&s;t Purpo&s;es, ina&s;much as they are not the Effects of what is called blind <HI>Chance,</HI> but of that unerring <HI>Providence,</HI> which gra|ciou&s;ly conducts all Events to the general Good of the Creature, and the final Completion of Virtue and Happine&s;s.&mdash;"Affliction comes not forth from the Du&s;t, neither does Trouble &s;pring out of the Ground."&mdash;Very far from it. At that great Day, when the whole Council of <HI>God</HI> &s;hall be more per|fectly di&s;play'd to us, we &s;hall be intimately con|vinced, that all His Di&s;pen&s;ations are wi&s;e, righte|ous and gracious; and that, "Tho' no Cha|&s;tening for the pre&s;ent &s;eems joyous, but grievous, neverthele&s;s it afterwards yields the peaceable Fruit of Righteou&s;ne&s;s to them that are exerci&s;ed there|by <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 11.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>OF the Truth of this we might &s;oon be con|vinced at pre&s;ent, were we but wi&s;e, and &s;uffered our&s;elves to reflect on what we daily &s;ee. It is
<PB N="2" REF="007318_0009_102B5788F220B7C8">
with the greate&s;t Inju&s;tice, as well as Perver&s;ene&s;s&punc; that Men a&s;cribe their Sins altogether to worldly Temptation, and inveigh upon all Occa&s;ions again&s;t this Life upon Account of its Vanities. The&s;e, if well attended to, would perhaps put us on our Guard again&s;t Sin; and, upon Enquiry, it will be found that the great Source and mo&s;t prevailing Cau&s;e of all Iniquity, is a &s;tupid Li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and want of Con&s;ideration. The Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures of Life are only the Means by which our great Adver&s;ary lulls us into Security or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, which, like &s;ome va&s;t Weight, oppre&s;&s;es the more generous Efforts of the Soul, and bears all &s;ilently down be|fore it, unle&s;s check'd by the powerful Hand of Affliction.</P>
<P>HENCE then, were I capable of wi&s;hing Evil to any Per&s;on, I could not wi&s;h a greater to my greate&s;t Enemies, than a long and uninterrupted Pro&s;perity. A flattering Calm portends a gathering Storm; and, when the Stream glides &s;mooth, deep and &s;ilent on, we ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pect that the Sea, or &s;ome Declivity, is near; and that it is &s;oon to be lo&s;t in the va&s;t Ocean, or tumble down &s;ome dreadful Fall or craggy Preci|pice. I &s;incerely pity tho&s;e, who were never vi&s;ited with Adver&s;ity, and who never took Time to con|&s;ider whence they came, where they are, or whither they are bound. If I loved them I could not but be apprehen&s;ive le&s;t, being drunk with Pro&s;perity, they &s;hould &s;wim &s;moothly from Joy to Joy along Life's &s;hort Current, till down they drop, thro' the Pit of Death, into the va&s;t Ocean of Eternity! In &s;uch a Ca&s;e, what more charitable Wi&s;h could be indulged toward &s;uch Per&s;ons, than that the cha&s;ten|ing Hand of Heaven might fall heavy upon them, arre&s;t them in their thoughtle&s;s Career, and teach them to pau&s;e, ponder and weigh the Moment&mdash;
<PB N="3" REF="007318_0010_102B578A77D99B80">
the eternal Moment&mdash;"of the Things that belong to their Peace, before they be hid from their Eyes."</P>
<P>THAT there &s;hould be any Per&s;ons, endowed with Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding, who never found Lei|&s;ure in this World &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect, or to en|quire for what End they were &s;ent into it, would &s;eem incredible, did not Experience a&s;&s;ure us of it. There are really &s;o many affecting Incidents in Life (perhaps graciou&s;ly intended to awaken Reflection) that their Hearts mu&s;t be petrify'd indeed, one would think, and harder than Adamant, or the nether Mill&s;tone, who can live in this World with|out being &s;ometimes affected, if not with their own, at lea&s;t with the human Lot.</P>
<P>I HOPE it is far from being my Character that I am of a gloomy Temper, or one that delights to dwell un&s;ea&s;onably on the dark Side of human Af|fairs. Our Cup here is bitter enough, and Misfor|tunes too thick &s;own, for any One who loves his Species, to &s;eek to embitter the Draught, by Evils of his own Creation. But there is a Time for all Things; and, on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, not to feel, &s;ym|pathize and mourn, would argue the mo&s;t &s;avage Nature.</P>
<P>THE Sun has lately ri&s;en dark upon me; and this Day, every Thing that comes from my Mouth will, in &s;pite of me, be tinctur'd with Melancholy. It is, however, a virtuous Melancholy, which it would be impious to check; and therefore, if it is publickly indulg'd on this Occa&s;ion, I hope it will be thought excu&s;able. You know it is natural for tho&s;e who are &s;incerely afflicted to believe that eve|ry Per&s;on is obliged to &s;ympathize with them, and attend patiently to the Story of their Woe. But
<PB N="4" REF="007318_0011_102B578CD1595860">
whether this be your pre&s;ent Di&s;po&s;ition or not, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing which you are not as much con|cern'd to receive deeply into your Hearts, as I am de&s;irous to pour it from mine.</P>
<P>I WOULD only &s;trive to per&s;uade you, that a con|&s;tant Fea&s;t was never intended for us here; and that it is the good Will of your Father, that you &s;hould be frequently rou&s;ed by what happens a|round you, to cheri&s;h &s;erious Reflection and reli|gious Mourning, which may be recompenced with eternal Joy.

lowe&s;t Pitch, and become the mo&s;t abject de&s;pondent Thing alive, for <HI>Him&s;elf.</HI> When his tran&s;ient Ho|nors are thus fled, his haughty Looks will be hum|bled. He will then begin to contemn his pa&s;t Folly, and enter deeply into his own Bo&s;om. He will no more rely on the Smiles of Fortune, or the Flatte|ries of Men; but acknowledge, from dear-bought Experience, that in this Life there is no &s;ure Refuge but God, nothing permanent but Virtue, nothing great but a humble Heart; and that the only Way to be happy <HI>Men,</HI> is to remember always that we are but <HI>Men,</HI>&mdash;poor dependent mortal Men.</P>
<P>BUT, be&s;ides per&s;onal Affliction (which is per|haps a la&s;t Re&s;ource, and &s;ometimes dangerous, as it plunges &s;ome into invincible De&s;pair) the All-gracious Governor of the World, &s;till watchful to turn every Event to the Good of his Creatures, without violating their moral Liberty, has many o|ther Ways of leading them to the Remembrance of him. Whether we look within or around us, we &s;hall find enough in the Pro&s;pect to humble our Souls, and convince us that, not tru&s;ting to any Thing in a World where all Enjoyments are fleet|ing, we &s;hall then only be &s;afe in it, "when we have put on the Brea&s;t-plate of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and arm'd our&s;elves with the Sword of the Spirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Galat,</HI> vi. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE>."</P>

God never intended this World as a la&s;t|ing Habitation for us; and Evil is &s;o blended with Good, that we cannot rea&s;onably &s;et our Affections upon it. Wailing, weak and defencele&s;s, we are u&s;hered into it. Our Childhood is trifled away in rov|ing from Toy to Toy. Our Youth is a Scene of Fol|ly and Danger; our Manhood of Care, Sollicitude,

Toil and Di&s;appointment. Our Old Age&mdash;if haply we reach Old Age&mdash;is a &s;econd Childhood. Wither|ed, wan, and bow'd beneath our Infirmities, we be|come, as it were, a living Ho&s;pital of Woes; a Bur|den to our&s;elves, and perhaps a Nu&s;ance to others.</P>
<P>IN each of the&s;e Stages, the Number of Evils is greatly encrea&s;ed, partly by our own Mi&s;con|duct, and partly by our nece&s;&s;ary Connexions with others; for the equitable Judgments of God are often general. "All Things come alike to all Men; and there is but one Event to the Righte|ous and the Wicked <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> ix. 2.</NOTE>." Moreover, many of tho&s;e Evils are of &s;uch a Nature, that no Prudence of ours can either fore&s;ee or prevent them. All the Stages of Life nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubject us to Pains and Di&s;ea&s;es of Body, and many of them to the acuter Pains of an anxious Mind. Upon the whole it appears that our <HI>Life is but a Vapor, which is &s;een a little While, and then vani&s;heth away, as a Tale that is told, and remember'd no more; or as a Wind that pa&s;&s;es over, and cometh not again.</HI></P>
<P>THE Man mu&s;t be thoughtle&s;s, indeed, who is not humbled with the&s;e Reflections. But &s;uppo&s;e his own Life &s;hould pa&s;s over as happily as po&s;|&s;ible, and he &s;hould feel but few of the&s;e Evils; yet, unle&s;s he &s;huts his Eyes and his Ears from the World, he mu&s;t &s;till find &s;omething in it, which ought to move the tender Heart to Sorrow and Remembrance of God.</P>

ca&s;t an Eye upon the World, we &s;hall drop a Tear over it on Account of the unavoidable Mis|fortunes that prevail in it.</P>
<P>DON'T we often &s;ee Tyranny &s;ucce&s;sful, ruth|le&s;s Oppre&s;&s;ion and Per&s;ecution ravaging the Globe, the be&s;t of Men made Slaves to the wor&s;t, and the lovely Image of the <HI>Deity</HI> &s;purn'd, di&s;honor'd, disfigur'd! How many Men, of genuine Worth, are ca&s;t out by Fortune to mourn in &s;olitary Places, &s;hivering with pale Di&s;tre&s;s, un&s;een, unpitied, for|lorn and helple&s;s! How many pine in the Confine|ment of Dungeons, without enjoying the com|mon Air, or the Common U&s;e of their own Limbs! How many are chain'd down, for Offences not their own, to the Gallies for Life! How many bleed beneath the Sword, and bite the Ground in all the &s;ad Variety of Angui&s;h, to &s;ate the cruel Ambition of contending Tyrants! How many are deprived of their E&s;tates, and di&s;appointed in their mo&s;t &s;anguine Expectations, by the Malice of &s;ecret and open Enemies, or, which is far more piercing, the Treachery of pretended Friends! How many boil with all the Tortures of a guilty Mind, and the bittere&s;t Remor&s;e for irreparable In|juries! How many pur&s;ue each other with the mo&s;t implacable Malice and Re&s;entment! How many bring the acute&s;t Mi&s;ery upon them&s;elves by their own Intemperance! How many condemn their Souls to a kind of Hell, even in their own Bodies, by an unhappy Temper, and the violent Commo|tions of di&s;order'd Blood! How many are com|pletely wretched in their Families, and con&s;tantly gall'd by the unavoidable Misfortunes of their deare&s;t Friends! On one Side the Di&s;tre&s;s of the <HI>Needy,</HI> the Injuries of the Oppre&s;&s;ed, the Cries of the Widow and Orphan, pierce our ears. On
<PB N="8" REF="007318_0015_102B579641930BB0">
the other Side, we hear the <HI>Voice of Lamentation and Mourning;</HI> our Friends and Neighbours weeping for dear Relations &s;uddenly &s;natch'd away, and <HI>re|fu&s;ing to be comforted becau&s;e they</HI> ARE NOT. Here one's Heart is torn a&s;under by having a beloved Wife or Child &s;natch'd from his Side! There ano|ther wails with the Lo&s;s of an affectionate Parent or Brother! Here &s;turdy Manhood drops in&s;tantly beneath the &s;udden Stroke! There <HI>blooming Youth</HI> &mdash;be &s;till now my bleeding Heart, wring me not thus with &s;treaming Angui&s;h&mdash;there <HI>blooming Youth</HI> falls a premature Victim to a Doom &s;eeming|ly too &s;evere! Beneath the cold Hand of Death, the Ro&s;es are bla&s;ted; re&s;tle&s;s Agility and Vigor are become the tame&s;t Things; and Beauty, Elegance and Strength, one putrid Lump!</P>
<P>SURELY, if we would think on the&s;e, and &s;uch Things, which ought not to be the le&s;s &s;triking for being common, and which render this Life a Scene of Suffering, a Valley of Tears, we could not &s;et our Hearts much upon it, but &s;hould be arre&s;ted even in the Mid-career of Vice, and trem|bling learn to weigh the Moment of Things, and &s;ecure <HI>the one Thing needful.</HI> All the tender Pa&s;|&s;ions would be waken'd in our Bo&s;oms. Our &s;ym|pathizing Souls would be ca&s;t down within us, and alarm'd at their own Danger, would rave round from Stay to Stay, calling ince&s;&s;antly for Help, till they could find a &s;ure and never-failing Refuge.</P>
<P>BUT where is this never-failing Refuge to be found? It becomes me now to point out &s;ome e|ver-flowing Spring of Comfort, &s;ome eternal Rock of Salvation, for the Soul, after having thus mu|&s;ter'd up &s;uch a baleful Catalogue of unavoidable Mi&s;eries, to alarm and humble her,&mdash;Now, as I
<PB N="9" REF="007318_0016_102B57995692E288">
have hinted before, this eternal Refuge is pointed out in the <HI>Text.</HI> In &s;uch Circum&s;tances, we &s;hall never find Re&s;t, but in re&s;olving with holy <HI>Da|vid</HI>&mdash;"O my God! my Soul is ca&s;t down within me, therefore will I remember thee."</P>
<P>WITHOUT remembering that there is a <HI>God,</HI> that overrules all Events, what Hope or Comfort could we have, when we reflect on all the afore&s;aid unavoidable Mi&s;eries of Life, and many more that might be named? Did we, with the <HI>Athei&s;t,</HI> be|lieve them to &s;pring up from the Du&s;t, or to be the blind Effects of unintelligible Chance, and of undirected Matter and Motion, what a poor Condi|tion &s;hould we think our&s;elves in <HI>here?</HI> Would not all appear as "a Land of Darkne&s;s, as Darkne&s;s it&s;elf, under the Shadow of Death, without any <HI>Order,</HI> where the Light is as Darkne&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Job</HI> x. 22,</NOTE>?" Surely we could not wi&s;h to live in this World upon &s;uch a precarious Footing; and yet we &s;hould not know whither to fly from it, unle&s;s into the darker State of dreary Annihilation, at the Thoughts of which the a&s;toni&s;hed Soul &s;hudders and recoils. Upon &s;uch a Scheme, all our Hopes would be thin as the Spi|der's Web, and lighter than Chaft that is di&s;per&s;ed thro' the Air. Our <HI>Adver&s;ity</HI> would hurry us into the mo&s;t invincible De&s;pair, and our <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI> would be as a Bubble bur&s;ting at every Breath. Philo&s;ophy would be a Dream, and our boa&s;ted Fortitude meer unmeaning Rant.</P>
<P>BUT on the other Hand, if, <HI>when our Souls are ca&s;t down within us, we will remember that there is</HI> a <HI>God,</HI> who&s;e great View in <HI>creating</HI> was to make us happy, who&s;e De&s;ign in <HI>afflicting</HI> is to reclaim us, and who <HI>governs</HI> the World by his Providence
<PB N="10" REF="007318_0017_102B579C819FAE10">
only to conduct all to the greate&s;t general Good&mdash; then, and then only, have we &s;ure Footing. We &s;hall neither rai&s;e our Hopes too high, nor &s;ink them too low. If Fortune is kind, we &s;hall en|joy her Smiles without forgetting the Hand that guides her. If &s;he frowns, we &s;hall feel our Woes as <HI>Men,</HI> but &s;hall robly bear them as <HI>Chri|&s;tians.</HI> For if we are really Chri&s;tians, our holy Religion teaches us that this <HI>Scene</HI> of Things is but a very &s;mall Part of the mighty <HI>Scheme</HI> of Heaven; &mdash;that our pre&s;ent Life is only the dim <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of our Exi&s;tence;&mdash;that we &s;hall &s;hortly put off this Load of Infirmities, and be tran&s;lated to a State, where no Temptations can a&s;&s;ail, no Fears di&s;tre&s;s us; but where "every Tear &s;hall be wip'd from our Eyes, and where there &s;hall be no more Death, nor Sorrow, nor Crying, nor Pain, becau&s;e the for|mer Things are pa&s;&s;ed away <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> xxi. 4.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>IF we are thus intimately convinced that unerr|ing <HI>Wi&s;dom, Power</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> hold the Reins of the Univer&s;e, and are at Peace in our own Con&s;ciences, the Storm of the World may beat a|gain&s;t us; but, tho' it may &s;hake, it can never overthrow us.</P>
<P>"ALTHOUGH the Fig-tree &s;hall not blo&s;&s;om, neither &s;hall Fruit be on the Vines; tho' the La|bor of the Olive &s;hall fail, and the Fields &s;hall yield no Meat; tho' the Flock &s;hall be cut off from the Fold, and there &s;hall be no Herd in the Stall; yet will we rejoice in the <HI>Lord,</HI> and we will Joy in the God of our Salvation<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Habbak.</HI> iii, 17, 18.</NOTE>."&mdash;Although Mi&s;|fortunes &s;hould be&s;iege us round and round; tho' Woes &s;hould clu&s;ter upon Woes, treading on the Heels of each other in black Succe&s;&s;ion, yet when we remember God, and fly to him as our Refuge,

we &s;hall &s;tand collected and un&s;haken, as the ever|la&s;ting Mountains, amid the general Storm.</P>
<P>WITH our Eye thus fixt upon Heaven, tru&s;ting in the Mercies of a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and animated by the Go&s;pel Promi&s;es, we &s;hall urge our glorious Cour&s;e along the Tract of Virtue, bravely with&s;tanding the Billows of Adver&s;ity on either Side, and triumph|ing in every Di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, Tho' Death &s;hould &s;talk around us in all his grim Ter|rors;&mdash;tho' Famine, Pe&s;tilence and &s;ell War &s;hould tear our be&s;t Friends from our Side;&mdash;tho' the la&s;t Trump &s;hould found from Pole to Pole, and the whole World &s;hould tremble to its Center;&mdash; tho' we &s;hould &s;ee the Heavens open'd, our <HI>Judge</HI> coming forth with Thou&s;ands and ten Thou&s;ands, his Eyes flaming Fire, the planetary Heavens and this our Earth wrapt up in one general Conflagra|tion;&mdash;tho' we &s;hould hear the Groans of an ex|piring World, and behold Nature tumbling into univer&s;al Ruin;&mdash;Yet then, even then, we can look up with Joy, and think our&s;elves &s;ecure. Our holy Religion tells us, that this now glorify'd <HI>Judge</HI> was once our humbled <HI>Redeemer;</HI>&mdash;that he has been our never-failing Friend, and can &s;hield us in the Hollow of his Hand. The &s;ame Religion al&s;o a&s;&s;ures us, that Virtue is the peculiar Care of that <HI>Being,</HI> at who&s;e Foot&s;tool all Nature hangs; and that, far from dying or receiving Injury amid the Flux of Things, the fair Plant, under his wi&s;e Go|vernment, &s;hall &s;urvive the la&s;t Ga&s;p of Time, and bloom on thro' eternal Ages!</P>
<P>AND now, my re&s;pected Audience, I think it is evident that if we &s;earch all Nature thro', we &s;hall find no &s;ure Refuge but in keeping a clear Con|&s;cience, and remembering God. If we con&s;tantly
<PB N="12" REF="007318_0019_102B57A08F5811F0">
exert our&s;elves to do our Duty, and remember that there is an all perfect Being at the Head of Affairs, the wor&s;t that can happen to us can never make us altogether mi&s;erable; and without this, the be&s;t Things could never make us in any Degree happy.</P>
<P>IF therefore, it is one great De&s;ign of all Afflic|ction, to bring us to &s;uch a Remembrance, and make us examine into the State of our own Souls, I thick I may be permitted to be&s;eech you, by your own Hopes of immortal Glory and Happi|ne&s;s, not to be blind and deaf to the repeated Warnings given you by your kind <HI>Parent God.</HI> Tho' the Afflictions do not happen immediately <HI>to</HI> you, they happen <HI>for</HI> you. And tho' all &s;eems well at pre&s;ent, which of you knows how &s;oon the Lord may vi&s;it you in his fierce Anger? Which of you, young or old, can &s;ay your Souls will not next, perhaps this very Night, be required of you? And think, O think, if you have never been led to <HI>re|member God,</HI> by the repeated Warnings given you in this World, how unfit a Time it will be to <HI>re|member Him,</HI> when you are ju&s;t &s;tepping into the next;&mdash;when (as you have &s;een lately in the Ca&s;e of many younger and &s;tronger than mo&s;t of you, here pre&s;ent) you &s;hall be &s;truck &s;en&s;ele&s;s on a Death-bed at once, and know not the Father that begat you, nor are con&s;cious of the Tears of her that gave you Suck?</P>
<P>IF you can but think on the&s;e Things,&mdash;the Va|nity of this World, and the Eternity or the next; &mdash;if you can but think on the Value of tho&s;e Souls, for which a <HI>God incarnate</HI> died, and &s;ealed a Covenant of Grace with his Blood, into which you have &s;olemnly &s;worn your&s;elves;&mdash;&s;urely if you weigh the&s;e Things, you will &s;top your Ears again&s;t

<P>In vain, I &s;ay, &s;hall the World tempt you thus.

He bid fair to have been the longe&s;t Liver among us, and my Eyes would have been for ever clo&s;ed before any One had dropt that Tear to his Memory, which is this Moment forced from me. But the fell Di&s;ea&s;e was of the mo&s;t invete|rate Kind. All the Power of Medicine, and all the Love we bore to him, could not gain one &s;uper|numerary Ga&s;p.
