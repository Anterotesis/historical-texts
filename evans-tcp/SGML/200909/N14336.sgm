<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF JOHN RICHARDSON, Introduced <HI>With a</HI> brief Relation <HI>concerning his Father</HI> WILLIAM RICHARDSON.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>IT has been repeatedly revived in my Mind, to leave the following Account concerning my dear Father WILLIAM RICHARDSON, hav|ing al&s;o &s;een &s;omething of his own in Manu|&s;cript, concerning his <HI>Convincement,</HI> with Re|marks on &s;ome other Things; but I being young when he died, did not then much heed it, and when I would gladly have &s;een it for my own Satisfaction, I could not, nor as yet can meet with it; therefore,</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as my Father was early convinced of the Truth, a Sufferer for it, and bore a pub|lick Te&s;timony to it, I found it my Duty, as near as I could remember the Contents thereof, to leave this &s;hort Account concerning him, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="018158_0007_0FA5622CDB5ADA78">
He was born at <HI>North Cave,</HI> in the Ea&s;t Part of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> in the Year 1624, of hone&s;t Parents, and of good Repute, and was educated in the <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Way, being &s;oberly inclined from his Childhood and upward, a Lover and Seeker after Purity and Virtue: And I have heard him &s;ay, gave his Mind much to Retirement, reading the holy Scriptures, breathing and &s;eek|ing after the Lord, e&s;pecially in the Fie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s, be|ing by Calling a <HI>Shepherd;</HI> and it pleated the Lord to open his Under&s;tanding &s;o clearly, that he &s;aw and longed for a more excellent Di&s;|pen&s;ation to come; and al&s;o &s;aw that the Prie&s;ts were wrong, and generally proud and covetous, &s;o that he was weary with following them, and much weaned from them and all Company, except two or three Men who did meet with him, and &s;poke one unto another concerning their inward Conditions, and what they had experienced of the Lord's Dealings with them. This was before they had heard of the Name <HI>Quaker,</HI> as it was in a &s;hort Time after given to a People which the Lord rai&s;ed up to give Te&s;timony of the notable and ancient, yet newly revived and ble&s;&s;ed Di&s;pen&s;ation of Chri&s;t's Coming, and Manife&s;tation by the holy Spirit, inwardly in the Hearts and Minds of the Children of Men, in order to enlighten, quicken, &s;anctify, and &s;ave them from Dark|ne&s;s, Death, Ignorance and Sin, that they might be made capable of obeying, wor&s;hiping and glorifying the great God and Sanctifier of them.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="018158_0008_0FA5622CEC3ABD18">
And as my Father was thus waiting and looking for a more general breaking forth of this glorious, powerful and Go&s;pel-day, which had in a good degree &s;prung up in his Heart, he had not, as yet, &s;een that worthy and good Man GEORGE FOX, although he pa&s;&s;ed through tho&s;e Parts about that Time; but &s;oon after came WILLIAM DEWSBERRY, and at the Sound of his Voice, I have heard my Father &s;ay, he was exceeding glad, in hearing him declare the Way to find the lo&s;t Piece of Silver, the Pearl of great Price <HI>within,</HI> a Saviour <HI>near,</HI> that had been held forth by Men to be at a di&s;tance. But having left the dark Watchmen, of whom they u&s;ed to enquire, they now met with their Beloved at home, in their own. Bo&s;oms; re|nowned be the great Name of the Lord, now and for ever.</P>
<P>Thus the hearing and, receiving the ever ble&s;&s;ed Truth, was as the Seed, or Word of the Kingdom, &s;own in the <HI>good Ground,</HI> or hone&s;t Hearts of Men, which took Root downward and &s;prang upward, and brought forth Fruit in &s;ome <HI>thirty,</HI> in &s;ome <HI>&s;ixty,</HI> and in others an <HI>hundred Fold,</HI> to the Prai&s;e of the great and good Hu&s;bandman.</P>
<P>My &s;aid Father was early rai&s;ed up to bear a publick Te&s;timony, which was living and ac|ceptable to Friends, but was &s;o much attended with Weakne&s;s of Body for many Years, that he went little abroad in the Work of the Mini|&s;try. He &s;uffered patiently the Spoiling of his Goods, and Impri&s;onment of his weakly Body,
<PB N="4" REF="018158_0009_0FA5622DB6A8F738">in the great and more general Impri&s;onment; he not only believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but &s;uffered for him; he was a good Neighbour, a loving Hu&s;band, and a tender Father over all that was good, but &s;evere to all that which was wrong, and was for Judgment, without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, and &s;pared it not even to his own Children; and e&s;pecially he was much con|cern'd for me, <HI>for,</HI> as he &s;aid, <HI>I was the wilde&s;t of them;</HI> and as he lived well, and believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I doubt not but he has fini&s;hed his Cour&s;e in the Love and Favour of God, is entered into a Man&s;ion of Glory, and is at Re&s;t with all the Faithful who <HI>loved not their Lives unto Death,</HI> but rather hated them in compari|&s;on of that endeared and unfeigned Love they bore to God the Father, and to Je&s;us Chri&s;t his dear and well-beloved Son, who died for them, and al&s;o for the whole World.</P>
<P>He departed this Life in 1679, aged about fifty-five Years, and was decently buried in Friends burying Place in <HI>Hotham,</HI> near <HI>Cave,</HI> where he was born.</P>

<HEAD>NOW having given this &s;hort Account concerning my Father, it remains with me to leave to Po&s;terity &s;ome Remarks on my <HI>Convincement,</HI> with an Account of &s;undry Tran&s;actions, Travels, Healings, and Deliver|ances I met with, in and from my Youth to this Day, with &s;ome Advice and Openings in the Spirit of Truth.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="5" REF="018158_0010_0FA5622ED1F44488">
I was young when my Father died, not above thirteen Years of Age, yet the Lord was at work by his Light, Grace and holy Spirit in my Heart, but I knew not then what it was which inwardly di&s;quieted my Mind, when any Thing which was evil did prevail over the Good in me, which it oftentimes did, for want of taking heed to that of God in my Heart; I de&s;ired Ea&s;e and Peace &s;ome other Way, without taking up the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t to my own corrupt Will, and &s;trove for &s;ome Time (as no doubt many do) to make merry over the ju&s;t Witne&s;s, until for a Sea&s;on the converting and true Witne&s;s of God &s;eem'd to be &s;lain, or di&s;appear'd, and then I took Liberty, but not in gro&s;s Evils which many ran into, being pre|&s;erved religiou&s;ly inclined, &s;eeking after Pro|fe&s;&s;ors, and enquiring of them, for my Infor|mation and Satisfaction, to find (if I could) any Thing that was &s;afe to re&s;t in, or any true and &s;olid Comfort to my poor di&s;con&s;olate and be|wilder'd Soul, but I was afraid I &s;hould be de|ceiv'd, or take up a fal&s;e Re&s;t in any Thing that was wrong or un&s;afe; which was the great Love and Mercy of God to me. But after many Searchings and Enquirings among tho&s;e who were but in the Letter without, and in the out|ward Court, where the Veil is over the Under|&s;tanding, and the Eye of the Mind is not truly opened to &s;ee into Things that are invi&s;ible, and hid from all carnal-minded Men; even &s;o was my State and Afflictions hid from them, and all the deceitful Workings of Satan, and the
<PB N="6" REF="018158_0011_0FA5622F602F74C8">&s;trong Temptations which I met with, the&s;e blind Guides could not &s;ee, nor their veiled Under&s;tandings know how to direct me to the true Shepherd of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the Lawgiver coming out of <HI>Sion,</HI> that turns away Ungodline&s;s from <HI>Jacob,</HI> and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion from <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> not having truly experienced Deliverance wrought in them out of this cloudy, bewilder'd and tempted State which I was in. Oh! that People would come to him that hath the <HI>Eye-&s;erve,</HI> with which if the Eye be truly anointed, it will &s;ee clearly Things as they are, and not darkly, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">taking Trees for Men, and Things terre&s;trial for Things coele&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ial; and that they would buy Gold, tried by the Fire of him that is called the <HI>tried Stone, elect</HI> and <HI>precious,</HI> laid in <HI>Sion</HI> for a Foundation: This is <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> whom the true Church believes in, and builds upon, and they are enriched with his Love, Power and Virtue, which is better than Gold out|wardly; this is the <HI>Anointing,</HI> and the <HI>Unction,</HI> which the true Church hath, and doth receive from Chri&s;t the holy One; and &s;uch as do truly put on his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Purity, and Holine&s;s, their Cloathing is better than that of fine Linen outwardly. Oh! that all the Inhabitants of the Earth might be thus anointed, enriched and truly cloathed, that no more inward Blindne&s;s or Poverty may be found in the Children of Men, nor the Shame of their Nakedne&s;s be any more &s;een, now or hereafter.</P>
<P>Receive and learn the&s;e Things, you that can, of him that is the Faithful and true Wit|ne&s;s,
<PB N="7" REF="018158_0012_0FA55230D134D8A0">that always witne&s;&s;eth again&s;t the Evil in Man, but always giveth Witne&s;s to the Father, for the Good in Men which they do &s;ay and think. This is the Spirit of him that <HI>was dead, and is alive, no more to be known after the Fle&s;h,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle gave Te&s;timony, and is to be known inwardly and &s;piritually by the Children of Men, to open the blind Eye, and un&s;top the deaf Ear, and pierceth into the Soul that hath been clouded and cap|tivated, impri&s;oned and mi&s;guided, and even in a Wilderne&s;s, and &s;ees not a Way for Deli|verance; like <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> when the Lord Jehovah &s;ent <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> a lively Type of Chri&s;t, and employed him in that great World of pleading with, and plaguing <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> yet for a Time their Burdens and Afflictions were encrea&s;ed, and their Exerci&s;es more imbitter'd unto them, until that great and marvellous Work was in a good degree accompli&s;hed, which was their Deliverance out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the great and mighty Work for which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was chiefly &s;ent; which Deliverance was not wrought until the Fir&s;t|born of Man, and of Bea&s;t, was &s;lain through|out all the Land of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>Now the clear Opening I had in the Light, of what is to be under&s;tood, and gathered from hence, is not the <HI>&s;taying of the outward Man,</HI> but a <HI>putting off,</HI> or <HI>&s;laying the Body of the Sins of the Fle&s;h,</HI> crucifying, or <HI>putting off the old Man with his Deeds;</HI> and as to the <HI>bea&s;t,</HI> all Cruelty, Lu&s;t, Pu&s;hing, Tearing, Devouring,

I have been led into the&s;e Openings, which have cau&s;ed a little Digre&s;&s;ion from my Wilderne&s;s State I mentioned before, which I now return to.</P>
<P>After much Searching without, among&s;t tho&s;e who proved to me <HI>Phy&s;icians of no Value,</HI> and <HI>mi&s;erable Comforters,</HI> I betook my&s;elf to a lone&s;ome and retired Life, breathing after, and &s;eeking the Lord in the Fields, and private Places, be&s;eeching him, that he would <HI>bring me to the &s;aving Knowledge of his Truth;</HI> and ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the Lord now and for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er, I had not &s;ought him long with all my
<PB N="9" REF="018158_0014_0FA56233D1724348">Heart, before I met with his inward Appear|ance to me, in and by his holy Spirit, Light and Grace; but when the true Light did begin to &s;hine more clearly, and the living Witne&s;s did ari&s;e in my inward Man, Oh then my un|done, bewildered and mi&s;erable condition began to appear, and then great and unutterable were my Conflicts, and the Di&s;tre&s;s I was in; I thought no Man's Condition upon the Face of the whole Earth was like mine; I thought I was not &s;it to die, neither did I know how to live; I thought in the Evening, <HI>Oh! that it was Morning;</HI> and in the Morning, <HI>that it was Evening.</HI> I had many &s;olitary Walks in the Fields, and other Places, in which I many Times poured out my Complaints and Cries before the Lord, with fervent Supplications to him, that he would look upon my Afflictions, and the &s;trong Temptations I was then under, and that he would rebuke the Adver&s;ary of my Soul, and deliver it, for I even thought it was as in the Jaws of a devouring Lion, and among&s;t the fiery Spirits, and, as it were, under the Weight of the Mountains. Read and under&s;tand the Afflictions of thy Brother, thou that ha&s;t come through great Tribulations, and ha&s;t wa&s;hed and made thy Garments white in the Blood of the Lamb; this is the Begin|ning of that Bapti&s;m which <HI>doth &s;ave,</HI> and of that Wa&s;hing of Regeneration, and renewing of the holy Gho&s;t, which the Lord <HI>&s;heds upon the Believers in abundance;</HI> this is the Blood which <HI>&s;prinkleth the Heart from an evil Con|&s;cience,

<P>Although I had &s;een many Things, and had divers Openings, yet great were my Trials, and many were the Temptations I met with in tho&s;e Days, for I lived at a Di&s;tance from Friends, and Meetings, which made my Exer|ci&s;e the harder, as will more fully hereafter appear, in the Cour&s;e of my Travels and Pil|grimage in this Vale of Tears and Troubles, and &s;ome of them not very common; but the Lord helped me through them all, ble&s;&s;ed be his Name for ever.</P>

This was &s;urely like the Day of <HI>Jacob's</HI> Troubles, and <HI>David's</HI> Fears; I &s;aw that the Filth of <HI>Sion</HI> was to be purged away by the Spirit of Judgment and of Burning; this is the Way of the Deliverance and Recovery of poor Men out of the Fall, and the Time of the Re&s;toration of the Kingdom to God's true <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> Read ye that can, and under&s;tand.

<P>Whereas there had been an Aver&s;ion in me to the People called in &s;corn <HI>Quakers,</HI> and al&s;o to their &s;trict living and Demeanour, Plainne&s;s of Habit, and Language, none of which I learned from them; for when the Lord changed my Heart, he al&s;o changed my Thoughts, Words and Ways, and there became an Aver|&s;ion in me to Vice, Sin and Vanity, as there had been to the Ways of Virtue, but having ta&s;ted of the Terrors and Judgments of God becau&s;e of Sin, I was warned to flee from &s;uch Things as occa&s;ioned Chri&s;t's Coming, <HI>not to bring Peace upon the Earth, but a Sword;</HI> a Sword indeed, yea, his Heart-penetrating, &s;earching Word, <HI>which is &s;harper than any two-edged Sword,</HI> that pierceth to the cutting or <HI>dividing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">nder between Fle&s;h and Spirit, Joints and Marrow.</HI> And as thus I came to &s;ee and

<P>Although the ble&s;&s;ed Truth thus prevailed in me, yet notwith&s;tanding, I was not without great Conflicts of Spirit, Temptations and Trials of divers kinds; neverthele&s;s, my Mind was re&s;igned to the Lord, and my fervent Prayers were to him, and he kept me, and opened my Under&s;tanding, for I was afraid of being mi&s;led in any Thing, e&s;pecially relating to my Salva|tion: I came to be weaned from all my Com|panions and Lovers which I had taken Delight and Plea&s;ure in, and all Things in this World were little to me, my Mind being much re|deemed out of the World, and not only the corrupt and evil Part thereof, but even from the lawful Part; &s;o that my Heart and Mind became much inclined and given up to &s;eek the Lord, waiting upon him to feel his Pre&s;ence, and Peace, and to know his Will, and receive Power to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="018158_0019_0FA56238F1619230">
As thus my Mind came to be brought into a depending and waiting Frame upon the Lord, and to be &s;tayed in the Light, and experiment|ally and feelingly to partake of his Love and Grace, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elped me again&s;t my Infirmities, (ble&s;&s;ed be his Name) I found it &s;ufficient for me, as I kept to it, in all Trials and Tempta|tions: Then I came to &s;ee, that all the outward Performances in Matters of Religion did not avail nor render Man acceptable to God, but as the Heart came to be truly given up to him, that he might not only purge it from Defile|ment, but keep it clean through the Indwelling of his holy Spirit: And, as near as I remember, I &s;aw clearly through the&s;e Things before the &s;ixteenth Year of my Age; although, between the Death of my Father and this Time, I took Liberty to go among what People I would, my Mother giving us great Liberty, although &s;he was a Woman well accounted of among all People who knew her, and not unde&s;ervedly, for her Indu&s;try and fair Dealing concerning the Things of this World.</P>
<P>After this Time I attended the Meetings of the Lord's People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> as diligently as my Circum&s;tances would well admit: My Mother being left with five Children, I had only one Si&s;ter who was elder than my&s;elf and three Brothers younger, the younge&s;t about three Years old when my Father died, he leav|ing but little of this World to bring us up with; yet my Parents always had as much as kept them above Contempt, and no body lo&s;t by

<P>We being le&s;t in a Farm of Grazing, and part Hu&s;bandry or Tillage, did well as to the Things of this World, yet I cannot well omit mentioning one Thing which became a great Exerci&s;e to me, which was thus; my Mother married one that was zealous for the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> and I being much again&s;t it, &s;hewed my Di&s;like to the Marriage, and told my Mother, <HI>I was afraid that &s;he had too much an Eye to what he had,</HI> for he was counted rich as to this World; <HI>but if &s;he thought to augment our Por|tions in &s;o marrying, the Hand of the Lord would be again&s;t her, and a Bla&s;ting or Mildew would come upon even that which we had got through Indu&s;try and hard Labour, and what the Lord had intended to have ble&s;&s;ed to us, if we kept faithful to the Truth, and contented our&s;elves with our pre&s;ent Conditions.</HI> Then my Mother con|fe&s;t, that <HI>as to the worldly Enjoyments, it had not been better with her than now.</HI> I mu&s;t write with great Caution; &s;he was my Mother, and a tender Mother over me, and was loth to offend me, and had promi&s;ed, as far as &s;he well dur&s;t, not to marry with any one with whom I was not &s;atisfied. But as to their Procedure in Court&s;hip, and Marriage, from this Time I was intirely ignorant, until it was accompli&s;hed. But when my poor Mother was married, her Cry was, <HI>My Son, how &s;hall I ever be able to look

But &s;he being married, what we had was mixed with my Father-in-Law's Goods, and my Mother died fir&s;t, and our Father married again, made his Will, and dying, left me Five Shillings for all my Part, which was of Right to de&s;cend from my own Parents upon me; I gave his Executors a Receipt in full, and there was an End of all, except &s;ome &s;mall Matter given to my younge&s;t Brother, for the re&s;t of my Brothers and Si&s;ter were dead. As near as I remember, this Marriage was in the eighteenth Year of my Age, &s;o that what I fore&s;aw about the <HI>Bla&s;t</HI> and <HI>Mildew,</HI> came to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Now to return to my further Account con|cerning the Troubles and Trials that attended me in the Time while I was in my Father-in-Law and Mother's Hou&s;e, after Marriage; we, and what we had, being removed to his Hou&s;e, except Part of the Stock which was left in the Ground. Now I fore&s;aw that I was like to come to a great Trial, and I was brought very low, what with the Trouble about the Mar|riage, and the Exerci&s;e of my Mind concerning my own Condition, having had many great Conflicts of Spirit, &s;o that I was almo&s;t in De|&s;pair, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d not the Lord, in whom I believed, ri&s;en in his Power, and rebuked the Adver|&s;ary of my Soul, I had been overthrown, and

Al&s;o, when I came to my Father's Hou&s;e, he being a Man much given to Family Duties, of &s;aying Grace, &amp;c. before and after Meat, none of which I could comply with, except I felt evidently the Spirit of Truth to attend therein, and open the Heart and Mouth into &s;uch Duties. The fir&s;t Day I came to the Hou&s;e, being called to the Table with all or mo&s;t of our Family, I thought, <HI>Is it now come to this? I mu&s;t either di&s;plea&s;e my heavenly or earthly Father:</HI> But oh! the Awfulne&s;s, or deep Exerci&s;e which was upon my Spirit, and &s;trong Cries that a&s;cended unto the Lord for my Help and Pre&s;ervation that I might not offend him. My Father-in-Law &s;at with his Hat partly on, and partly off, with his Eyes fixed on me, as likewi&s;e mine were on him in much Fear; &s;o we continued as long or longer than he u&s;ed to be in &s;aying Grace, as they call it, but &s;aid nothing that we heard; &s;o at length he put on his hat again, to the Wonder of the Family: Neither did he then, or ever after, a&s;k me why I did not put off my Hat; neither
<PB N="18" REF="018158_0023_0FA5623CF6FBE5B0">did he perform that Ceremony all the Time I &s;tayed with him, which was above one Year: Thus the Lord helped me, renowned be his great Name now and for ever.

I &s;aw clearly, that there could not be any true and acceptable Wor&s;hip per|formed to God, but what was in the Spirit, and in the Truth, neither could any pray aright, but as the Spirit helped them, which teacheth how to pray, and what to pray for, and rightly prepares the Mind, and guides it in the Perform|ance of every Service which the Lord calls for from his Children.</P>
<P>I found my Father-in-Law was much di&s;|plea&s;ed with my going to Meetings, yet I could not &s;ee what Way to appea&s;e his Di&s;plea&s;ure, except in being very diligent (which I was) in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, rather beyond my Ability, work|ing very hard; it is almo&s;t incredible what my poor little weak Body went through in tho&s;e Days, but all would not gain his Love, for the longer I &s;tay'd with him, the more his Love
<PB N="19" REF="018158_0024_0FA5623D69BA7EC0">declined from me; although I told him, <HI>he need not be unea&s;y about my Wages, for I would leave that to him&s;elf:</HI> I could not &s;ee what he could have again&s;t me, except my going to Meetings, however that was all he alledged. Now when his former Stratagems would not do, he offered me a Hor&s;e to ride on, if I would go with him to his Place of Wor&s;hip. I met with many a Snib and &s;our Countenance from him, in my return on Foot from Meetings, although as &s;ea|&s;onably as my Body was capable of performing; for my Father commonly &s;ent me on the Fir&s;t|day Mornings into the Fields a Mile or two, and as far upon a Common to look at Bea&s;ts, Hor&s;es, and Sheep (all this on Foot) I thought with a De&s;ign to weary and make me uncapable of going to Meetings; all which I bore patient|ly, neither, that I remember, ever &s;aid, <HI>this is hard U&s;age;</HI> after all this, to the great Grief of my poor Mother, I had to go two, three, four, five, and &s;ometimes &s;ix Miles, to Friends Meetings. After I had walked fa&s;t, and ran &s;ometimes with my Shoes under my Arms for want of Time, I have &s;een many Friends weep, and could not forbear when they &s;aw me come into the Meeting very hot and in a great Sweat, they being in part &s;en&s;ible of the hard Ta&s;k I had to undergo.</P>
<P>There is one Thing &s;omewhat remarkable, which was thus; one Fir&s;t-day Morning when I was about going to the Meeting, my Father &s;aid, <HI>i&s; I would ride upon &s;uch a young Mare,</HI> as he mentioned, <HI>I might;</HI> which was one of the
<PB N="20" REF="018158_0025_0FA5624085E3B4A8">greate&s;t of ten or twelve Hor&s;es which he kept, about four Years old, and not before rid at all: I thought his De&s;ign was more to hinder me of the Meeting than any Good to me, or any Ex|pectation of getting his Mare rightly broke, but I accepted his Offer, only a&s;king how I might catch her? Having got Help to an&s;wer that, &s;he being abroad, I put on the Bridle and mounted the topping Bea&s;t, and upon her fir&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance, down &s;he came; for that was my way: And if the fir&s;t or &s;econd Fall did not, the third mo&s;tly cured them from &s;triving to throw the Rider; I commonly fell upon my Feet, and endeavoured &s;o to free my Legs that &s;he might not fall upon them, and then &s;prang up on her Back while down, and made her ri&s;e with me; &s;o away we went, and came in due Time to the Meeting. This was partly the beginning of this way of managing Hor&s;es by me; &s;o I rid to the Meetings two or three Times, and then my Father a&s;ked me, <HI>if the Mare did not carry me &s;oberly?</HI> I replied, <HI>&s;he did;</HI> then I mu&s;t have her no more, he would make her his Saddle-Mare; &s;o I betook my&s;elf to my Feet again, except &s;ome other &s;uch like Turn came. The Lord's mighty Power bore me up, and he gave me as it were Hind's Feet, and enabled me to go through the&s;e Exerci&s;es, and to bear the Burden in the Heat of the Day of my Trials, inwardly and outwardly, which were many and various.</P>
<P>Now the la&s;t Stratagem my Father u&s;ed to hinder my going to Meetings was thus; he
<PB N="21" REF="018158_0026_0FA56241E8A22538">took me in his Arms in great &s;hew of Kindne&s;s, &s;aying, <HI>if I would be as a Son to him, I &s;hould &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d he would be a Father to me,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome|thing about his having no near Kindred, (and much more to the &s;ame Effect he &s;aid to my Brother <HI>Daniel,</HI> who was an innocent, wi&s;e, and clean-&s;pirited Lad) I replied to him, <HI>if in thus making me thy Son, thou intends to hinder me from going to Meetings, or to oblige me to go with thee to the</HI> Pre&s;byterian <HI>Meetings, or any Thing that is again&s;t my Con&s;cience, I cannot upon this Bottom be thy Son;</HI> and, for the &s;ame Rea|&s;ons, I refu&s;ed to be his hired Servant, although he offered to hire me, and give me Wages. Now when he &s;aw that neither Frowns, Threat|nings, Hard&s;hips, nor great Promi&s;es of Kind|ne&s;s could prevail with me, he told me bluntly and roughly, <HI>I &s;hould &s;tay no longer in his Hou&s;e:</HI> I innocently an&s;wered, <HI>I could not help it if it mu&s;t be &s;o, as all I could do would not give him Content, without hurting my Con&s;cience, and the Peace of my Mind, which I valued above all mutoble Things of this World.</HI> My poor Mother heard my pleading with him, and how I offered to do the be&s;t for him I was capable of by Night or Day, (as I always had done) if he would be ea&s;y, and let me have his Counte|nance; but this was the Sentence, <HI>No, I &s;hould not &s;tay in the Hou&s;e:</HI> And indeed that troubled my poor Mother &s;o, that I was &s;orced to leave my Father, and go to endeavour to mitigate her great Trouble by telling her, <HI>that if I was but faithful, the Lord, I believed, would take Care
<PB N="22" REF="018158_0027_0FA56243780CE850">of me that I &s;hould not want;</HI> and the more fully to di&s;charge my&s;elf, I reminded her, <HI>that as &s;he had entered into Marriage Covenants with her Husband, &s;he &s;hould endeavour to perform them, and in every Thing faithfully to di&s;charge her&s;elf as a Wife ought to do to a Husband, and leave me and all, and cleave to him, and to make her Life as ea&s;y as &s;he could:</HI> I al&s;o told her, <HI>never to &s;end me any Thing that my Father knew not of, for I was not free to receive it;</HI> although what we had was in his Hand, and all &s;unk there, as I mentioned before.</P>
<P>I write this partly, that all who do marry, may take &s;pecial heed that it be done with great Caution, and under due Con&s;ideration, and the Lord &s;ought to in it, that it may be done in his Coun&s;el, and not only nominally, but truly <HI>in his Fear,</HI> and then no doubt but it will be well with both Hu&s;band and Wife; and being equally yoked, &s;uch will not only be meet and true Helpers in all Things belonging to this Life, but more e&s;pecially in Things ap|pertaining to the World that is to come, and the Good of the immortal Soul, which to the faithful People of the Lord is of great Value. Oh, how happily and peaceably do &s;uch live together in the Lord, as they keep to that which thus joined them! There is more in it, both as to the Parents and their Po&s;terity, than it is to be feared many con&s;ider or think of, as is but too apparent in the many forward and unequal Marriages which I have made Ob&s;er|vation of.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="018158_0028_0FA562442DFE6230">
One remarkable Pa&s;&s;age occurs to my Thoughts, which happened thus; my Father having been at the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Meeting and come home, he, as his manner was, put me or my Brother upon reading the Prie&s;t's Text, which had been that Day in <HI>Daniel,</HI> concerning his being ca&s;t into the Den of Lions for his not regarding the King's Decree, but on the con|trary prayed to the God of Heaven with his Windows open toward <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> after his wonted manner. My Father made his Ob&s;er|vations as my Brother read, and very much magnified <HI>Daniel,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>the Spirit of God was in him, but that there were none &s;uch as bun in the&s;e our Days.</HI> I owned that he was indeed an <HI>extraordinary Man,</HI> but that there were <HI>none endowed with a Mea&s;ure of the &s;ame Spirit in any Degree,</HI> in that I di&s;&s;ented from him, and gave my Father a brief Account of the many Sufferings of our Friends, &s;ome of which were pa&s;t, and &s;ome then under Sufferings for the Word of God, and the Te&s;timony of Je&s;us, which they bore for him, and e&s;pecially the great Sufferings of our dear Friends in <HI>New-England,</HI> viz. hard Impri&s;onments, cruel Whip|pings, cutting off Ears, Bani&s;hment if they re|turned into <HI>New-England</HI> any more; and I &s;hewed him likewi&s;e, how they put to D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath <HI>Marmaduke Stephenjon, William Robin&s;on, Wil|liam Leddra,</HI> and <HI>Mary Dyer,</HI> for no other Cau&s;e but labouring to turn People <HI>from Dark|ne&s;s to Light,</HI> and <HI>from the Power of Satan to the living Power of God,</HI> to his Light, Grace

But if thou ha&s;t &s;aid or done wrong, ha&s;t not thou found great Di&s;quietne&s;s and Trouble of Mind?

<P>But that I was not willing to break in upon this Story, but keep it entire, there was one Thing worthy of Notice, which I now come to, wi&s;hing it may be duly con&s;idered by all who read or hear it: When I mentioned <HI>Marmaduke Stephen&s;on,</HI> that good Man and great Sufferer in the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, as before, my Mother &s;aid, <HI>it was true;</HI> for &s;he lived a Servant with <HI>Edward Wilberfo&s;s,</HI> an hone&s;t <HI>Quaker</HI> in <HI>Skipton,</HI> where <HI>Marmaduke Stephen|&s;on</HI> was a Day-labourer, about the Time he had his Call to go to <HI>New-England.</HI> See the Account of <HI>New-England</HI> judged, not by Man as Man, but by the Spirit of the living God, written by <HI>George Bi&s;hop.</HI> If I remember right, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>He was &s;uch a Man as &s;he never knew, for his very Countenance was a Terror to them, and he had a great Check upon all the Family; if at any Time any of the Servants had been wild, or any way out of the Truth, if they did but &s;ee him, or hear him coming, they were &s;truck with Fear, and were all quiet and &s;till:</HI> And if but one of the Children came into the Hou&s;e where he labour|ed, and he would not have it to come, the&s;e were his Words, <HI>Go thy way,</HI> or <HI>go Home, le&s;t I whip thee;</HI> and they were &s;ubject and quiet. This ample and excellent Account, I thought had &s;ome Reach upon my Father, however, it much af|fected my Mind. Oh! that we the Profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame holy Truth, may &s;o live in it, as

<P>Some little Time before the Marriage of my Mother, I was brought into the public Work of the Mini&s;try, concerning which I had many Rea&s;onings, being young, &s;carce eighteen Years old, and naturally of a &s;tammering Tongue, which I could not overcome, although I had u&s;ed what Endeavours lay in my Power as a Man, con&s;idering my Years and Education, all would not do until the Truth helped me: But after many Conflicts, great Troubles and Tempta|tions, the wor&s;t I ever met with, and the mo&s;t piercing Sorrow I ever had yet been in &s;ince I came to the Knowledge of the ble&s;&s;ed Truth was, when through Rea&s;onings, Di&s;obe|dience, and Unwillingne&s;s to comply with, and an&s;wer the Lord's Requirings, he in Di&s;plea&s;ure took away from me the Comfort of his holy Pre&s;ence for &s;everal Months together. Oh! the Tribulations and penetrating Troubles I met withal in this Condition, no Tongue is able to expre&s;s, no nor the Heart of any finite Creature is able to conceive the Depth of the Anxiety of the Heart-piercing and wounding Sorrows I was in; I thought my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tate was as bad as <HI>Jonoh</HI>'s, for &s;urely if there be a Hell upon Earth, I was in it: What greater Hell can be here to a quickened Soul, and an enlightned Under&s;tand|ing, who hath ta&s;ted of the Goodne&s;s of God, and of the Powers, in a degree, of the World to come, than to be deprived thereof, and think
<PB N="27" REF="018158_0032_0FA5624727238418">they are fallen away from this State? I could &s;carcely believe I &s;hould ever have Repentance granted to me, or be re&s;tor'd again into the Love and Favour of God, when I found <HI>that River of Life dried up,</HI> as to me, <HI>which did before,</HI> not only <HI>make me,</HI> but <HI>even all the whole City of God, truly glad:</HI> But being left under an Apprehen&s;ion of the Lord's Di&s;plea&s;ure, and in part a Partaker of the Terrors of his Wrath; Oh! I thought, &s;urely the very Mountains, and even the Hills, were not &s;ufficient (if they could have been put into the Scales or Balance) to have weighed again&s;t my Troubles and Afflic|tions they were &s;o great; but as the Lord had by his Judgments brought me in a good degree from the Vice and Vanity of this World, now by his Judgments he made me willing to give up to an&s;wer his Requirings in part, and in my Obedience to him I began to feel &s;ome Com|fort of Love and Fellow&s;hip of the Spirit of the Lord in my&s;elf, and in his People, who were brought to be Partakers of the like Fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>Now I return to the Matter about my b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng turned out of my Father's Hou&s;e, which I mentioned before, but was willing to keep this &s;olemn Account entire, with De&s;ires it may be a Caution to all, in whom the Lord is at work in the &s;ame manner, not to rea&s;on or gain&s;ay &s;o much as I did, but to give up freely and cheerfully to the Will of God. When I &s;aw I mu&s;t turn out, I thought it expedient to ac|quaint &s;ome worthy Friends with it, le&s;t any undue Reflections &s;hould be ca&s;t upon the Truth,

<P>Notwith&s;tanding I pleaded with my Father to let me &s;tay until I could hear of a Place, he would not, though I was &s;carce fit for Service, be|ing almo&s;t like an <HI>Anatomy</HI> (as the Saying is) &s;o that mo&s;t who knew me, &s;aid, <HI>I would pine away in a Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">mption;</HI> but turn out I mu&s;t, and did, though I was weak, poor and low in Body, Mind, Pocket and Cloaths; for I think I had but Twelve-pence in my Pocket, and very ordinary Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aths upon my Back. Thus I took my &s;olemn Leave of the Family, with my Heart full, but I kept inward to the Lord, and under Truth's Government; many Tears were &s;hed in the Family, e&s;pecially by my poor Mother, when I left them; my Father &s;aid little, but appeared like one &s;truck with Won|der, to &s;ee &s;o much Love manife&s;ted towards me by the Family, and &s;o much wi&s;hing that I might not go away: But out I came upon the great Common aforementioned, where I had had many &s;olitary Walks, but none like this, for this Rea&s;on, <HI>that I knew not where to go.</HI> I then thought of <HI>Abraham</HI> who was called out of <HI>Ur</HI> in the Land of the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> as it is briefly mentioned by <HI>Stephen;</HI> but this was the Difference betwixt us, he was <HI>called,</HI> I was <HI>forced out.</HI> But as I was walking upon the Common, the Sen&s;e of my weak Condition,

<P>I come now to the Particulars which &s;tood in my Way of an&s;wering the Lord's Commands &s;o fully as &s;ometimes I &s;hould have done; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> a <HI>violent Humour</HI> fell into one of my Legs &s;oon after I was bound Apprentice, which I with others thought was much occa&s;ioned by hard U&s;age, Heats and Colds, and many Surfeits, even from my Infancy; which Lamene&s;s held me about two Years, and I &s;uffered much by the &s;aid Leg, and it much di&s;couraged and di&s;abled me.

<P>I was likewi&s;e in the&s;e Days under the Di&s;|pen&s;ations of Openings and Vi&s;ions, and thought my&s;elf as it were upon <HI>Mount-Pi&s;gah,</HI> and &s;aw into the holy Land, and into Things relating to God and his heavenly Kingdom, and into his Work and Way of bringing Man out of the Fall and Alienation to him&s;elf again, and into a heavenly State in Chri&s;t, as Man yields true O edience unto the Leadings and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eration of his ble&s;&s;ed Grace and holy Spirit in the Heart.

<P>But although at times I had clear Sights into many heavenly Things, and al&s;o had at times comfortable Enjoyments of the living Pre&s;ence of God, yet I wanted to be more e&s;tabli&s;hed in the unchangeable Truth, which I had at times &s;ome comfortable feeling of; and in crying to the Lord, I found he inclined unto me, and, as <HI>David</HI> &s;aid, <HI>he heard my Cries, and pluckt my Feet out of the Mire and Clay, and &s;et them upon a Rock,</HI> that was higher than I, and in part <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed my Goings, and put a new Song into my Mouth, even high Prai&s;es unto the Lord for all his tender Mercies to me</HI> in the&s;e trying Times; and now being more crucified to the World, and the Spirit of it, I witne&s;&s;ed a more con&s;tant In|dwelling of the heavenly Power and living Pre|&s;ence, Light and Grace; I came to be brought into Stilne&s;s, and it became mo&s;t agreeable to my Condition to keep much in Silence, and wait upon the Lord for the Renewing of Strength, that thereby I might &s;urmount all Temptations and Trials that might fall in my way, or which I might be tried with, which were not a few.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Things, before recited, are worthy of Commemoration, and proved great Confirm|ations

After <HI>William</HI> had heard my Account, he fixed his Eyes on me and &s;aid, <HI>Thou mu&s;t go back again to</HI> Coventry. I appeared unwilling, for two Rea&s;ons; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e I thought I had cleared my&s;elf of that People. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I thought it not &s;afe to run my&s;elf into Danger of Suffering, unle&s;s I was &s;atisfied the Lord required it of me.

I was zealous for the Name of the Lord, and had a great Concern upon my Mind for the Promulgation of the Truth, and where I met with loo&s;e Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the Truth, it was a great Exerci&s;e to me.</P>
<P>When I returned home from this, and indeed from all my Journeys, I took Care what I well could, &s;o far as my weak Body was capable, to fall into Bu&s;ine&s;s, and not to loiter away my Time, neither abroad nor at home.

<P>After the Lord had opened my Heart, and I came in part to under&s;tand the holy Scriptures, and to have a Feeling of that holy Spirit in which the holy Penman wrote them, and a Sympathy with the Spirits and Exerci&s;es of the Righteous therein mentioned, I took great Delight in reading them, and having a good Memory, could thereby the better deal with Prie&s;ts, and with Profe&s;&s;ors.

<P>Thus the Lord opened to me the true Mean|ing of the Parable of the <HI>Mu&s;tard-&s;eed</HI> in this the Time of my Infancy as to the Mini&s;try, with which he &s;ent me forth into the World, that my Faith might &s;tand in the Lord alone, the Author and Fini&s;her, as well as Giver of the true and &s;aving Faith, even <HI>that Faith which works by Love,</HI> and <HI>gives Victory over the World;</HI> it was by and through the Power, Virtue and Efficacy of true Faith, <HI>which is the Gi&s;t of God,</HI> that the Elders in former Ages obtained, and now do obtain a good Report; it was in and through this Gift, that worthy <HI>Abel</HI> with his Offering was accepted of God, although he was envied of his earthly and evil Minded Brother <HI>Cain,</HI> and al&s;o by him &s;lain. The ever memo|rable <HI>Enoch,</HI> through the Virtue of this holy Gift, walked with God, as him&s;elf gave witne&s;s that <HI>Enoch</HI> plea&s;ed him; he walked &s;o in Faith and Obedience even to the End, that he died not as Men in common do, but was tran&s;lated, or changed in a peculiar manner. Come, read thou that can&s;t, and under&s;tand thou that art redeemed out of (and ha&s;t overcome) the Fle&s;h, and the Powers of the fir&s;t Nature, the World and the Devil, in a great mea&s;ure, for thou knowe&s;t that it is by the Operation of this Gift that the Dead in old <HI>Adam</HI> are rai&s;ed

Through Faith the Violence of Fire was quenched, the Mouths of Lions have been &s;topped, the Sword turned backward, the Armies put to flight, even &s;uch as were Aliens or Strangers who outwardly fought again&s;t the Lord's People; which &s;ets before us, as in a Gla&s;s, how and what we are to overcome in this Go&s;pel-day, in which we are not to fight with Men, but with our Lu&s;ts, and overcome Sin and Satan; which is as great a Victory as he ob|tained that overcame the rampant Lions, who had Dominion over the Wicked, as Sin and Satan have Power and Dominion over the Wicked and Ungodly to this Day. Con&s;ider now in Time thou that reade&s;t the&s;e Lines, whether Chri&s;t or Antichri&s;t doth mo&s;t predominate in thee? Whether Grace or Sin mo&s;t abound in thy mortal Body?

<P>Now to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion to the hi&s;torical Part. When I had travelled much of the Time between my going forth, which was from about the nineteenth Year of my Age unto

For Truth did &s;o mightily pro&s;per, and Friends grew &s;o in the Mini&s;try, that it became a Proverb, that BRIDLINGTON <HI>was become a School of Prophets.</HI> This mighty Work of the Lord in the&s;e Days, is worthy to be chronicled and remembered among his many worthy and noble Acts; we had many heavenly and good Meet|ings, prai&s;ed and renowned be the worthy Name of the Lord, now and for ever.</P>

We had but little <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> when I fir&s;t &s;et|tled in that Place, but afterwards many Friends Hearts were &s;tirred up in a holy Zeal for the Lord, not only to promote Meetings for Wor|&s;hip, but al&s;o for good Di&s;cipline in the Church, and they began to &s;ee a Nece&s;&s;ity of coming up more in the Practice of this very needful Work; although there were &s;ome that &s;aid, <HI>they could &s;ee no Need of &s;uch clo&s;e Order and Di&s;cipline:</HI> Yet I found it to be my Way in the Truth to bear with &s;uch, if they were not irregular in their Conver&s;ations; but if they were di&s;order|ly, we dealt with them as the Lord opened our Way in the Wi&s;dom of Truth; and thus bear|ing with the <HI>Ea&s;ine&s;s</HI> of &s;ome on the one hand, and encouraging the faithful and zealous on the other, until way was made, beyond my Expectation, for the &s;preading of the Truth, its Te&s;timony, and the Di&s;cipline thereof in tho&s;e Parts.</P>

<P>I was in the twenty eighth Year of my Age when I married my Wife, who was a Woman of an excellent Temper, very affectionate, &s;ober and prudent, loved Retirement much, and wait|ing upon the Lord, and the Enjoyment of his internal and living Pre&s;ence, and e&s;pecially with the Lord's People, that they might al&s;o be made Partakers with her of the like &s;pecial Favours: this was as her Crown and Kingdom while in this World, even from her Childhood; and to &s;ee Friends pro&s;per in the Truth was Matter of great Rejoicing to her.

<P>As I was walking in a plain Field in the fore Part of the Day, not far from the Sea, betwixt <HI>Bridlington</HI> and <HI>Broynton,</HI> my Soul was in a deep Concern, and at that Time exerci&s;ed in Medi|tation on the Things of God, and al&s;o in fervent Prayers to him for Pre&s;ervation from every hurt|ful Thing; and a heavenly Frame my Mind was then brought into, for then I neither &s;aw

<P>NOW the Time came on for my going into <HI>America,</HI> having had a Sight of it about ten Years before; I al&s;o acquainted my Wife therewith about a Year before &s;he died, and I found it was likely to be a very near trial to her; &s;he was a virtuous, good Woman, but was taken away, and left me three &s;mall Chil|dren, the elde&s;t not above four Years old, the younge&s;t not much above one Month old, and I having but little of this World, rea&s;oned much about going, thinking my Circum&s;tances at

<P>I parted with my Friends with much broken|ne&s;s of Heart, and &s;et forwards on my Journey towards <HI>London,</HI> in order to take &s;hipping there, the 11th of the Eighth Month 1700; and when I, with my Companions <HI>Thomas Thomp|&s;on, Jo&s;iah Langdale,</HI> and <HI>John E&s;laugh,</HI> with &s;ome other Friends, went on board a Ship in

<P>Peradventure I may mention &s;ome Things that may appear to be of but little moment, but I have &s;een a divine Providence attend terrene Affairs, although they may appear of little con|&s;equence to &s;ome; &s;uch as do not duly con&s;ider the&s;e Things, may make a wrong Application, and as the cour&s;e of my Travels hath afforded variety of Trials and Tran&s;actions which are in &s;ome Things very particular, from whence ari&s;eth variety of Accounts, &s;o there hath been a Willingne&s;s in my Mind to favour &s;ome who have been de&s;irous of having me to leave a Journal of my Life, which I have complied with, as far as I can &s;ee my way clear in the Truth.</P>
<P>Then we went on board of another Ship called the ARUNDEL, <HI>Splenden Rand</HI> Ma&s;ter, in which we embarked the 17th of the Ninth

<P>Now we left the Ship and Ma&s;ter, who was but a churli&s;h, ill-natured Man.

<P>I had great Openings in &s;everal Places in <HI>New-England,</HI> and it appeared clear to me, and &s;ometimes I &s;poke openly of it, that the Lord would gather a great People to the &s;aving Knowledge of the Truth in his Time, notwith|&s;tanding what many of our Friends had &s;uffered for the Name of the Lord, and Te&s;timony which they held in the&s;e Parts, from the Predece&s;&s;ors of the pre&s;ent Inhabitants: The View of the State of the&s;e Things, e&s;pecially the great Sufferings of many of our faithful Friends, put me in mind of that Saying, that <HI>The Blood of the Mar|tyrs is the Seed of the Church;</HI> and in this ca&s;e, I believe it will be fulfilled in its Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>One Pa&s;&s;age happened, which I think not fit to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence: There came into one Meeting, ea&s;tward in <HI>New-England,</HI> a Man, who was Brother to a <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Prie&s;t, to oppo&s;e Friends, (who, as Friends &s;aid, had been often very trouble&s;ome in that Meeting) in the Beginning of the Meeting he de&s;ired to have

Friends were &s;ilent, and the Man &s;ubmitted to what was propo&s;ed, and a good Meeting we had, the Lord's heavenly Power and living Pre&s;ence being with us, and the Sub&s;tance was felt among us, and exalted over all the Shadows and Types; and Chri&s;t the true Bread and living Water, Light and Life of the World, was exalted that Day; and the mighty God and Father, with his beloved Son, through the Help of the holy Spirit, was glorified, who is worthy for ever. Near the Conclu&s;ion of the Meeting, the Man began to &s;peak well of what he had heard, particularly touching that of <HI>Water-Baptum,</HI> which, he &s;aid, <HI>he had nothing to object again&s;t;</HI> but as to the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> as he called it, <HI>becau&s;e little or nothing had been &s;aid about it, therefore he concluded, we either denied or di&s;u&s;ed it;</HI> or Words to the &s;ame purport.

<P>I went to the Meeting under no &s;mall Con|cern of Mind, but when I was come into the great Hou&s;e, I was very much affected with the wi&s;e Conduct of the Man, to &s;ee in what excellent order he had placed every thing, &s;o that I could not find wherein any thing could be amended; and a heavenly Meeting it was, without any Oppo&s;ition; and at the breaking up of the Meeting, this tender Man, who&s;e Heart was broken and opened by the Power of

<P>I and &s;ome other Friends being in our Pa&s;&s;age by Water in a Ve&s;&s;el bound for <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and meeting with high and contrary Winds, we put into a Creek &s;ome Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Rhode|I&s;land,</HI> and de&s;ired the People to procure us &s;ome Hor&s;es to ride on, and we would pay them any thing that was rea&s;onable, but hoped they would not make a Prey of us, for we were Strangers, and they ought to do to us as they would be done by, if they were in a &s;trange Land, as we were; and there came up to us a goodly old Man, and a&s;ked us, <HI>what People we were? if we were not</HI> Quakers?

<P>I with &s;everal other Friends went from <HI>Salem</HI> Yearly-meeting (which was a large and good Meeting) towards <HI>Dover,</HI> and coming to a River, I &s;taying a little behind, a Friend took my Hor&s;e with two more into the Boat, and by that time I came to the River-&s;ide the Boat was &s;inking, and the Ferryman made a lamentable Cry, &s;aying, <HI>The Boat is &s;unk and we &s;hall be all drowned;</HI> altho' it was &s;o ordered, that there was but one Friend in the Boat with the Boat|man, and I do not remember that ever before now my Hor&s;e was in any Boat, and I not there; which I looked on as the Mercy of a kind Providence to me, and to &s;everal other Friends in Company. I hearing the Noi&s;e, as before, (and al&s;o the flowndering of the Hor&s;es when tumbling into the Water) called to the Men, to be &s;ure to take care to free them&s;elves of all the Tackling of the Hor&s;es, (as Bridles,
<PB N="79" REF="018158_0084_0FA5627E1FA58448">Stirrups, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) and catch hold on my Hor&s;e's Tail, and he would bring them both a&s;hore; but if they tru&s;ted to the other (as before men|tioned) when the Hor&s;es &s;wam they would fail them, unle&s;s very &s;trong; and to have them hold by the Bridle was the way to drown both Hor&s;e and Man: This Advice was given while they had the Hor&s;es in their Hands; the Boat|man, being a lively Youth, took my Advice, caught hold of my Hor&s;e's Tail, it being long, (which I ever approved of among Rivers) and I calling to my Hor&s;e, he came quickly with the Man a&s;hore, but left the hone&s;t old Friend <HI>Ezekiel Waring</HI> (to who&s;e Hou&s;e we intended to go that Night) in the River floating to the Neck, a hundred Yards from the Shore by Computation, yet watchful Providence did &s;o attend, that his Life was pre&s;erved to a Wonder; for it was &s;o ordered, altho' he mi&s;&s;ed taking my Advice, and caught hold of his Stirrup, and the Girth broke, as they are apt to do if they be tight when the Hor&s;e begins to &s;wim, which brought off the Saddle and Pillion, and the Oar of the Boat, and his Hat, which with the Pillion-&s;eat being in his Arms, ju&s;t bore up his Head above Water for &s;ome time; his poor Wife &s;eeing the Danger to which her Hu&s;band was expo&s;ed, fell into a fainting Fit; (there being neither Hou&s;e, Man, or Boat, to be &s;een on this Side of the River, but our&s;elves, the Boatman, and the Stem and Stern of the &s;unk Boat full of Water.) A Hou&s;e there was on the other Side of the River, which was half a
<PB N="80" REF="018158_0085_0FA5628113ABC058">Mile over. The Ferryman did his be&s;t to get a Boat or Cannoe, and altho' it began to be dark, yet he found a Cannoe, (which is made of a fine piece of Timber hollowed in the form of a Boat, and generally will carry but two or three or four Men;) he coming near, a&s;ked <HI>if</HI> Ezekiel <HI>was alive?</HI> I told him he was, but very weak, for I had often heard him blubber in the Water; I encouraged him, that he might not faint in his Mind, for I told him, <HI>I yet believed his Life would be pre&s;erved;</HI> he would very faintly &s;ay, <HI>Unle&s;s Help came, he could not hold it long.</HI> I went on by the Water&s;ide, and laid me down often on the Land, not much regarding Wet or Dirt, &s;ometimes tumbling over Logs of Wood and Limbs of Trees, for &s;o it is in the&s;e uncul|tivated Places: I directed the Man with his Cannoe where the poor Friend was, as near as I could tell by my la&s;t Ob&s;ervation, and withal de&s;ired he would turn the Stern of his Cannoe to him, as he could not lift him into the Can|noe; neither to let him lay his Hand upon the broad Side of it, but upon the Stern, le&s;t he &s;hould over&s;et it, and you be both drowned: So he did, and brought him gently a&s;hore, to the great Joy of his loving Wife and us all. The Boatman, as he owned, had found my Coun&s;el good, and therefore would have me tell him what he might do now; I bid him fetch the Boat to &s;hore by the Fowler or Rope, and then go and carry <HI>Ezekiel</HI> in the Cannoe to the Inn on the other Side of the Water, that he might dry, warm, and refre&s;h him&s;elf until
<PB N="81" REF="018158_0086_0FA5628279A9BBE8">we came; in the mean time we cleared the Boat of Water, which when done, we put two Hor&s;es into it, and I towed my Hor&s;e at the Boat's Stern to make room for &s;everal, e&s;pecially the good Women before mentioned, who were at this time in my Company, not without their Exerci&s;e any more than my&s;elf: We got well over, and then the Ferryman and Friend on the other Side brought the Hor&s;es that were left, being three, which were enough for the Boat, and proved too many the fir&s;t Time. We found the good old Friend &s;inely and well recruited, and got to his Hou&s;e about Midnight, where we were glad, and our Hearts were full of Prai&s;es to the Lord for this great and eminent Deliverance and Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>In this fir&s;t Vi&s;it while in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> I met with &s;omething worthy of thy Notice, if thou art &s;uch a Reader as I wi&s;h thou may&s;t, which was thus: Being in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> &s;everal Friends came to me in &s;ome of the Intervals of the Yearly-meeting, (for it held &s;everal Days, both for Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline) to enquire whether it was u&s;ual to let the Young, and &s;uch as had but appeared little in Te&s;timony in our Parts of the World, come into Meetings of public Friends? I &s;aid, <HI>Yes, if they were of clean Lives, and what they had to &s;ay, approved; and it was very like &s;uch might want Advice as much as tho&s;e who were come to more Experience in the Work of the Mini&s;try, if not more:</HI> This was &s;ome means of enlarging the &s;aid Meetings of Mini&s;ters now coming on. When I came into the Meeting,
<PB N="82" REF="018158_0087_0FA562848DD9D660">&s;everal of the Elders de&s;ired me to go into the Gallery, which I refu&s;ed, the Concern upon my Mind being &s;o great, I thought it was enough that I could but get into the Hou&s;e, and &s;it down among the lowe&s;t Rank.</P>
<P>This Meeting was one not to be forgotten, becau&s;e of the eminent Vi&s;itation from the Lord that was upon us in it; I have not often &s;een the like; I que&s;tion if there were any dry Cheeks for &s;ome time in it; and the manner of the working of the heavenly Power was re|markable, in order to the &s;anctifying and pre|paring Ve&s;&s;els for the Lord's U&s;e; and he broke us down by his Judgments from following flattering Fle&s;h, and the plea&s;ing Vanities of the World, and the &s;ubtil Baits of Satan, by the Tenders of his Love, and engaged us to follow his heavenly and inward Calls, Knocks, and Reproofs of his holy Spirit, and to obey the Dictates of the &s;ame. When the Lord prepares in a good degree for this Work of the Mini&s;try, many have been unwilling to give up and obey, until they have ta&s;ted of the Lord's Di&s;plea&s;ure, and in part of his Judgments, which have brought them into a Submi&s;&s;ion; after which they went out with their Lives &s;ometimes in their Hands, and became a Wonder to men, bearing their Reproach, and &s;ometimes appeared in great Congregations, &s;ometimes in Noi&s;es and Tu|mults, and &s;ometimes were in Watchings and Fa&s;tings, in Wearine&s;s, Hunger and in Cold, with much more, for the Name of the Lord and his Te&s;timony, and for the Enjoyment
<PB N="83" REF="018158_0088_0FA56286000687E0">of Peace, and the internal Pre&s;ence of him that hath &s;eparated us to this Work by the holy Gho&s;t; and it is in and by our abiding faithful to the &s;ame, that we are pre&s;erved in a Capacity of Per&s;everance through all to the End, to the mutual Help and Comfort one of another, and Renown of the Name of the Lord, who is worthy now and for ever.</P>
<P>We al&s;o had a very large Meeting on this I&s;land in an Orchard, where I had good Service for the Lord; and I remember I was much con|cerned about the two Mini&s;trations, <HI>viz. John's</HI> Bapti&s;m with <HI>Water,</HI> and CHRIST's with the <HI>holy Gho&s;t,</HI> it being clear from <HI>John's</HI> Words, that he &s;aw to the End of his own Di&s;pen&s;ation when he declared, <HI>he mu&s;t decrea&s;e, but</HI> CHRIST <HI>mu&s;t in|crea&s;e:</HI> which is generally under&s;tood to re&s;pect their differing Di&s;pen&s;ations; for the fir&s;t Bap|ti&s;m was to baptize <HI>unto Repentance,</HI> the other to <HI>the purging of the Floor,</HI> and <HI>burning up of that which was combu&s;tible,</HI> viz. the Chaff and Stubble, which the Lord's Bapti&s;m burneth up inwardly, and which no elementary thing can do; for if all the Eatings, Wa&s;hings, Ob&s;ervations, and Cere|monies under the Law, although to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> com|manded and enjoined by the Lord, could not make the Comers thereunto <HI>perfect,</HI> how &s;hould the&s;e or any of them now, when not command|ed, as they never were to us, <HI>perfect</HI> they <HI>Gentile</HI> World? So what I had upon my Mind, as I received I went through with, and &s;hewed the Beginning, U&s;e and End of the watery Di&s;pen&s;a|tion and the U&s;e and Continuance of CHRIST's.
<PB N="84" REF="018158_0089_0FA5628639F35F78">&s;piritual Bapti&s;m to the End of the World. The Meeting broke up, and Friends went into an up|per Room in an Inn; but I felt &s;uch an Exerci&s;e upon my Spirit that I could not eat, but de&s;ired Friends to be ea&s;y, and I would eat as &s;oon as I could; and while I was walking over the large Chamber alone, there came up three Men whom I knew not, or what they were, but it &s;prang livingly in my Heart to &s;et my Eyes on them in the Lord's Dread, and &s;o I did; they pa&s;&s;ed away, and I was told afterwards, that they were three <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> Preachers who had been at the Meeting, and came once more to &s;ee me, with a De&s;ign to have a Di&s;pute with me; <HI>but,</HI> they &s;aid, <HI>I looked &s;o &s;harply they dur&s;t not meddle with me:</HI> Thus the Lord in a good degree wrought for me, ble&s;&s;ed be his worthy Name for ever.</P>
<P>Now I leave the Account of my Travels in tho&s;e Parts, and enter upon my &s;econd, with my hone&s;t Companion <HI>James Bates,</HI> who was born in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and travelled much with me through many Provinces, and &s;ome I&s;lands; we had good Service together, and it was much with me, when on <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> to vi&s;it <HI>Nan|tucket,</HI> where there were but very &s;ew Friends; <HI>Peleg Slecum,</HI> an hone&s;t public Friend nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> intending to carry us in his Sloop to the &s;aid I&s;land that Night; and <HI>Peleg</HI> thought we had been clo&s;e in with our de&s;ired landing Place, but we fell &s;hort, and Night coming on, and having but one &s;mall Cannoe to help us a&s;hore, which would carry but three
<PB N="85" REF="018158_0090_0FA56286E852E040">People at once, we went a&s;hore at twice, and left the Sloop at an Anchor; and it being grown dark, we thought we were going up into the I&s;land among the Inhabitants, but &s;oon found that we were upon a Beach of Sand and Rubbi&s;h, where was neither Gra&s;s nor Tree, neither could we find the Sloop that Night, though we &s;ought it carefully, and hollowed one to another till we were weary, &s;o that we were forced to &s;ettle upon our little I&s;land, from the Centre of which, one might ca&s;t a Stone into the Sea on every Side; here we &s;taid that Night, not knowing but the Sea, when at the Height, would have &s;wept us all away, but it did not; there I walked, and &s;ometimes &s;at, until Morning, but &s;lept none; at la&s;t the Morning came, and the Mi&s;t went away, and we got on Board again, and reached the I&s;land about the ninth or tenth Hour.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter was willing, at our Reque&s;t, to land three of us, <HI>(i. e.)</HI> me, my Companion and <HI>Su&s;anna Freborn,</HI> a public Friend, who had a Concern upon her Mind for &s;ome Time, (as &s;he &s;ignified to Friends in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> where &s;he lived) to vi&s;it the few Friends in <HI>Nantucket,</HI> and Friends thought this a proper Sea&s;on to pay that Vi&s;it. She was a Woman well beloved, and in good Unity with Friends.</P>
<P>We landed &s;afe, and as we went up an A&s;cent, we &s;aw a great many People looking towards the Sea, for great Fear had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, that our Sloop was a <HI>French</HI> Sloop loaded with Men and Arms, who were coming to invade the
<PB N="86" REF="018158_0091_0FA56287A798CF70">I&s;land: I held out my Arms and told them, <HI>I knew not of any wor&s;e Arms than the&s;e on board.</HI> They &s;aid, they were glad it was no wor&s;e, for they had intended to have alarmed the I&s;land, it being a time of War: I told the good like People, for &s;o they appeared to me, that <HI>Peleg Slocum,</HI> near <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> was Ma&s;ter of the Sloop, and that we came to vi&s;it them in the Love of God, if they would be willing to let us have &s;ome Meetings among&s;t them. They behaved them&s;elves very cour|teou&s;ly towards us, and &s;aid, <HI>they thought we might.</HI></P>
<P>We then enquired for <HI>Nathaniel Starbuck,</HI> who we under&s;tood was in &s;ome degree con|vinced of the Truth, and having Directions to his Hou&s;e, we went thither, and I told him, <HI>We made bold to come to his Hou&s;e, and if he was free to receive us, we would &s;tay a little with him, but if not, we would go el&s;ewhere; for we heard he was a &s;eeking religious Man, and &s;uch chiefly we were come to vi&s;it:</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>we were very welcome.</HI> And by this time came in his Mother <HI>Mary Starbuck,</HI> who the I&s;landers e&s;teemed as a Judge among them, for little of Moment was done there without her, as I under&s;tood.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t Sight of her it &s;prang in my Heart, <HI>To this Woman is the everla&s;ting Love of God.</HI> I looked upon her as a Woman that bore &s;ome Sway in the I&s;land, and &s;o I &s;aid, and that truly, <HI>we are come in the Love of God to vi&s;it you, if you are willing to let us

The great Woman approved of the Propo&s;al, and &s;aid, <HI>indeed that was the be&s;t Way.</HI> The next Con&s;ideration was, <HI>where &s;hall the Meet|ing be?</HI> She pau&s;ed a while, and then &s;aid, <HI>I think at our Hou&s;e.</HI> I from thence gathered &s;he had an Hu&s;band, for I thought the Word <HI>our</HI> carried in it &s;ome Power be&s;ides her own, and I pre&s;ently found he was with us; I then made my Ob&s;ervation on him, and he appeared not a Man of mean Parts, but &s;he &s;o far exceeded him in &s;oundne&s;s of Judgment, clearne&s;s of Under&s;tanding, and
<PB N="88" REF="018158_0093_0FA562892A0E0590">an elegant way of expre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, and that not in an affected Strain, but very natural to her, that it tended to le&s;&s;en the Qualifications of her Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The Meeting being agreed on, and Care taken as to the Appointment of it, we parted, and I lay down to try if I could get any Sleep, for I have &s;hewed before what &s;ort of a Night the la&s;t was with us; but Sleep vani&s;hed away from me, and I got up and walked to and fro in the Woods until the Meeting was mo&s;tly ga|thered. I was under a very great Load in my Spirit, but the Occa&s;ion of it was hid from me, but I &s;aw it my place to go to Meeting, the Order of which was &s;uch, in all the Parts thereof, I had not &s;een the like before; the large and bright rubbed Room was &s;et with &s;uitable Seats or Chairs, the Gla&s;s Windows taken out of the Frames, and many Chairs placed without very conveniently, &s;o that I did not &s;ee any thing awanting, according to the Place, but &s;omething to &s;tand on, for I was not free to &s;et my Feet upon the fine Cane Chair, le&s;t I &s;hould break it.</P>
<P>I am the mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> particular in this exact and exemplary Order than in &s;ome other Things, for the Seats both within and without Doors were &s;o placed, that the Faces of the People were towards the Seats where the public Friends &s;at, and when &s;o &s;et, they did not look or gaze in our Faces, as &s;ome I think are too apt to do, which in my Thoughts be&s;peaks an unconcerned Mind: The Meeting being thus gathered and &s;et down in this orderly and ample
<PB N="89" REF="018158_0094_0FA56289F6B0B3B0">manner, (although there were but very few bearing our Name in it) it was not long before the mighty Power of the Lord began to work, and in it my Comp nion e&s;pecially did appear in Te&s;timony in the fore Part thereof; and while he was &s;peaking, a Prie&s;t (not him before touched on, but another) flung out &s;ome Re|flections upon him, and the People for his &s;ake, which I did not &s;ee the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion for; after which he went away, (but more of this in the Sequel.)</P>
<P>I &s;at a con&s;iderable Time in the Meeting be|fore I could &s;ee my Way clear to &s;ay any thing, until the Lord's heavenly Power rai&s;ed me, and &s;et me upon my Feet as if one had lifted me up, and what I had fir&s;t in commi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak, was in the Words of Chri&s;t to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> viz. <HI>Except a Man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God;</HI> with the&s;e Words, <HI>Nay, the natural and unregenerate Man cannot &s;o much as &s;ee the heavenly and &s;piritual Kingdom of Chri&s;t, which &s;tands not only in Power, but al&s;o in Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, Joy and Peace in the holy Spirit; and to be born again, was not to be done unperceivably, no more than the natural Birth could be brought forth without Trouble; and to pretend to be in Chri&s;t and not to be new Creatures, is prepo&s;terous; and to pretend to be new Creatures, and yet not able to render any Account how it was performed, was unrea&s;onable; for it could not be,</HI> as I urged before, <HI>without our Knowledge; for to be born again, &s;ignified to be quickened and rai&s;ed into a &s;piritual and new Life, by which the Body of
<PB N="90" REF="018158_0095_0FA5628AAC3FAEB8">the Sins of the Fle&s;h is mortified, and we come to live a &s;elf-denying Life: Tho&s;e who are crucified with Chri&s;t, they are crucified to their Sins, that as he died for Sin, we might die to Sin: In this State we live not after the Fle&s;h, although we live</HI> (as the Apo&s;tle &s;aid) <HI>in the Fle&s;h; but the Life which the&s;e live, is through Faith in the Son of God: And to have all this, and much more wrought in us, and we</HI> know nothing <HI>of it, is unaccountable.</HI></P>
<P>As I was thus opened, and delivering the&s;e Things, with much more than I can remember, the great Woman I felt, for mo&s;t of an Hour together, fought and &s;trove again&s;t the Te&s;ti|mony, &s;ometimes looking up in my Face with a pale, and then with a more ruddy Com|plexion; but the Strength of the Truth in|crea&s;ed, and the Lord's mighty Power began to &s;hake the People within and without Doors; but &s;he who was looked upon as a <HI>Deborah</HI> by the&s;e People, was loth to lo&s;e her out&s;ide Reli|gion, or the Appearance thereof: When &s;he could no longer contain, &s;he &s;ubmitted to the Power of Truth, and the Doctrines thereof, and lifted up her Voice and wept: Oh! then the univer&s;al Cry and Brokenne&s;s of Heart and Tears was wonderful! From this Time I do not remember one Word that I &s;poke in Te&s;ti|mony, it was enough that I could keep upon the true Bottom, and not be carried away with the Stream above my Mea&s;ure.</P>

Then he began to ca&s;t what Slurs and Odiums he could upon Friends, with &s;uch bitter Invectives as his Malice could invent. I &s;tood with an attentive Ear and a watchful Mind; for as I &s;tood leaning upon the Rails, with no &s;mall Concern upon my Mind, I felt the Lord's Power ari&s;e, and by it my Strength was renewed in the inner Man, and Faith, Wi&s;dom and Courage with it, &s;o that the Fear of Man, with all his Parts and Learning, was taken from me; and in this State <HI>George Keith</HI> appeared to me but as a <HI>little Child,</HI> or as <HI>nothing:</HI> Renowned be the mo&s;t excellent Name of the Lord, now and for ever.

<P>I have &s;ometimes thought to omit &s;ome Part of this Account concerning <HI>George Keith,</HI> but I remember it opened very clearly in my Mind then, and I &s;aid to him, <HI>That the Hand of the Lord was again&s;t him, and that he would pour forth Contempt upon him, for his Di&s;obedience and Wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to his Reflections; he &s;aid, <HI>the</HI> Quakers <HI>pretend to be again&s;t all Ceremonies, but he could prove that they u&s;ed many Ceremonies, as</HI> taking one another by the Hand, <HI>and</HI> Men &s;aluting one another, <HI>and</HI> Women doing &s;o to one another, <HI>and,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>that Women did</HI> &s;alute Men; <HI>yea, they had done it to him;</HI> as it was generally under&s;tood by tho&s;e who heard him, which I thought not worthy my Notice, (but more of this anon.)

<P>Then came out one of my Arrows which cut and wounded him deep: I &s;aid, <HI>George that is not true.</HI> Upon that the Prie&s;t drew near and
<PB N="107" REF="018158_0112_0FA5617C8DCEB2D0">appeared very bri&s;k, and &s;aid, <HI>I had as good as charged Mr.</HI> Keith (as he called him) <HI>with a Lie.</HI> I replied, <HI>Give me Time, and I will prove that which</HI> George <HI>&s;aid, was</HI> not true, <HI>and then thou and he may take your Advantage to re&s;cue him from that Epithet of a Liar if you can.</HI> The Prie&s;t &s;aid, <HI>I knew not Mr.</HI> Keith: I replied, <HI>If he knew him as well as I did, he would be a&s;hamed to be there as an Abettor of him.</HI> The Prie&s;t got away, and troubled me no more in all the En|gagements that <HI>George</HI> and I had afterwards (altho' the &s;aid Prie&s;t was with him.) Then I demanded of <HI>George, What Way our Friends proceeded again&s;t him, and what Mea&s;ures they took, as he would in&s;inuate, to bring him to the Gallows?</HI> But I perceived Fear began to &s;urprize the <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> and he thinking by my Boldne&s;s I was an Inhabitant of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o&s;e Parts, and knew his Abu&s;e to Friends in the&s;e Provinces, and their peaceable Behaviour towards him, was willing to let the matter drop, and demanded <HI>my Name,</HI> which was told him.

<P>This Meeting (as before mentioned) being generally newly convinced of the Truth, there|fore I urged to have him to come to the Particulars of Friends Proceedings again&s;t him, that even for very Shame, among tho&s;e Strangers he would &s;et forth as far as he could in Truth, the
<PB N="108" REF="018158_0113_0FA5617CA7F28C18">&s;teps Friends had taken in per&s;ecuting him, as he pretended; but he would not meddle in the lea&s;t with it. Then I &s;hewed him, and the People, the Fal&s;ity of his Charge, and the Wickedne&s;s of his Spirit, and the Peaceablene&s;s of Friends Behaviour towards him, and what great Affronts and Provocations they had put up with at his hand, as I had it from tho&s;e who were Eye and Ear Witne&s;&s;es of it: For, as I &s;hewed <HI>George Keith,</HI> I had &s;earched into the Bottom of the&s;e Matters, and heard that when he &s;tood before Governors and A&s;&s;embly Men in their Courts of Judicature, when they were met about the Affairs of the three Provinces, he has tore open his Buttons and told them, <HI>His Back tickled for a Whipping,</HI> and <HI>could they not cut him into Collops, and fry, and eat them with Salt;</HI> and that <HI>he &s;corned they &s;hould wipe his Shoes:</HI> All which, with much more, I told him <HI>I could prove again&s;t him.</HI> And when he &s;aw he could not provoke Friends to give him &s;ome condign Puni&s;hment, <HI>which I thought,</HI> as I &s;aid to him, <HI>none but Friends would have &s;pared,</HI> e&s;pecially, <HI>when his Back tickled &s;o much for a Whipping;</HI> but they like Men of Peace and Religion over|looked it all, and he like a Man full of Malice, rather than want &s;omething to &s;lur and blacken Friends with, writ a Letter I know not where, but dated it from <HI>Bridlington</HI> Pri&s;on in <HI>We&s;t-Jer&s;ey.</HI> It mu&s;t have been dated on the out&s;ide of the Pri&s;on, the Doors being locked, &s;o that he could not get into it; yet this went current far off, <HI>that</HI> George Keith <HI>was in Pri&s;on;</HI>

He then began to a&s;k of my Country, and from whence I came? With the Account of which I humoured him; yet withal put him in mind of his great Brag, and importuned him to make &s;omething appear towards that great matter he had done in <HI>Old England,</HI> even for very &s;hame; for I was a&s;hamed for him, that a Man of his Learning, Parts and Preten&s;ions, &s;hould &s;o expo&s;e him&s;elf; but he went no far|ther about it.

<P>By this Time he appeared &s;omewhat glutted with the &s;harp Sword and keen Arrow the Lord gave me, which cut and wounded deep, &s;o that from this Time I did not find in our after En|counters, he appeared at any time &s;o bold and de&s;perately hardy, but rather expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, altho' very wickedly, yet in a &s;ofter Tone.

<PB N="111" REF="018158_0116_0FA56181293F18E8">being about a Quarter of a Mile from our Lodgings.</P>
<P>The Evening coming on, the neighbouring <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Women fell hard upon our Women Friends about <HI>their &s;aluting Man,</HI> which <HI>George Keith</HI> had charged upon them, as was generally under&s;tood in the Plural, <HI>and this appeared as a Confirmation,</HI> as they alledged, <HI>becau&s;e when charged, I made no Reply to it, as I had done to all or mo&s;t other Charges, and had overthrown Mr.</HI> Keith, as they &s;aid, <HI>&s;o that he was not able to &s;tand before me.</HI> They ought to have &s;aid <HI>before the Lord</HI> in the fir&s;t place: But how the Women might clear them&s;elves of that Reflec|tion was the pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s. I &s;aid, I thought it would be the be&s;t, at a &s;uitable Time in the Morning when <HI>George Keith</HI> was come, that by hand&s;omly bringing the matter over him, they might learn what Women they were who &s;aluted him, and &s;o clear them&s;elves from the Reflection ca&s;t upon them; for, I &s;aid, perhaps he will limit it to &s;ome of his near Kindred (as Wife, Mother, Si&s;ter, Daughter) which may &s;erve for a <HI>Salvo</HI> in this pre&s;ent Ca&s;e; for I did not know of any &s;uch general Practice in any Place where I had been, and I had vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the meetings in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Wales.</HI> So in the Morning when <HI>George,</HI> with two Prie&s;ts, and many People were come, with &s;ome Friends, who filled the Hou&s;e, a Woman Friend &s;tood up and brought the Matter di&s;|creetly over <HI>George Keith.</HI> But when &s;he put the Que&s;tion in the Plural, <HI>(Women)</HI> he &s;hifted
<PB N="112" REF="018158_0117_0FA56181EBB32DF8">the Term and &s;aid, <HI>he did not &s;ay Women.</HI> I de&s;ired the Friend to call to her Neighbours who heard what <HI>George Keith</HI> had &s;aid the la&s;t Evening, and were now pre&s;ent, <HI>how they un|der&s;tood the Word?</HI> One like a wi&s;e and ju&s;t Man &s;aid, <HI>He would do Ju&s;tice to every Man; and he under&s;tood that</HI> Geoge <HI>&s;aid</HI> Women; and many &s;aid to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, but none to the contrary. The Friends a&s;ked me, <HI>How I under&s;tood the Word?

<P>The next Que&s;tion &s;he put to him was, <HI>What Woman?</HI> he an&s;wered, <HI>A good old motherly Woman that was gone to Heaven many Years ago.</HI> Then &s;he a&s;ked, <HI>What Country Woman?</HI> He replied, <HI>A</HI> Scotch <HI>Woman.</HI> The Friend &s;aid, <HI>It was very well that he had cleared all the World of that Fault</HI> (if it might be &s;o termed) <HI>but</HI> Scotland, <HI>and the Woman</HI> dead <HI>many Years ago.</HI> The Women Friends were greatly &s;atisfied, and glad they were &s;o finely di&s;charged of that which &s;ome counted a foul Reflection, and e&s;pecially before their zealous Neighbours the <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> who (as the Friends &s;aid) pro|bably might have twitted them with it, whether the Matter was true or Fal&s;e, if it had not been cleared up; <HI>but,</HI> as I &s;aid to <HI>George, it was a Reflection for Reflection's &s;ake:</HI> For I was willing
<PB N="113" REF="018158_0118_0FA56182A7C8EFC0">to &s;et every thing that was wrong (as far as I was capable) in its proper Light, that Friends and others, of all Per&s;ua&s;ions and Qualities who were pre&s;ent, might &s;ee Things as they really were, and not be deceived; and I had much Satisfaction in &s;o doing. And ina&s;much as I was engaged in the Defence of the Truth, it appeared the mo&s;t clear to me, to load him with his own Lies, Mi&s;takes and Wickedne&s;s, and to do what we did, as much as in us lay, in the Lord's mighty Power; for he appeared to me, like to the Angels who kept not their fir&s;t State.</P>
<P>Matters being thus far gone through, and the Meeting-time drawing on, I was in &s;ome Concern of Mind, le&s;t any &s;hould be hurt by either hearing or an&s;wering <HI>George Keith,</HI> he having a great Propen&s;ity to jangling; it there|fore opened in my Mind to a&s;k him a Que&s;tion, withal reminding him, <HI>that he was but to us as an heathen Man or a Publican,</HI> yet he might, if he plea&s;ed, an&s;wer me the Que&s;tion, which was, <HI>Whether he was always</HI> &s;ound <HI>in the fundamental Doctrines of</HI> Chri&s;tianity, <HI>yea or nay?</HI> Upon which he &s;at a con&s;iderable Time in Silence, of which I was truly glad, my Spirit being much bowed under the Apprehen&s;ion I had, of the weighty Exerci&s;e that was likely to attend the approaching Meeting. But before we part|ed, <HI>George</HI> &s;tood up, and taking his Staff in his Hand by the Middle, &s;aid, <HI>While he was a</HI> Quaker, <HI>he thought, as</HI> Paul <HI>thought,</HI> that he had the Spirit of God, <HI>and when he had the Spirit
<PB N="114" REF="018158_0119_0FA5618394ACE478">of God, then he wrote</HI> &s;ound Things, <HI>but when he had it not, then he wrote</HI> un&s;ound Things. I a&s;ked, <HI>Whether the&s;e un&s;ound Things he wrote were in</HI> Fundamentals, <HI>yea, or nay? If not in</HI> Funda|mentals, <HI>then my Que&s;tion remained firm and untouched.</HI> He would have gone from the matter, but I reminded him of it again, as I &s;uppo&s;ed he fore&s;aw that he could not an&s;wer it, but by bringing a Stroke upon him&s;elf, for if he had owned his being <HI>un&s;ound,</HI> I had it under his own Hand, in a Book written after he left Friends, <HI>that he was always &s;ound,</HI> &amp;c. And if he had &s;aid, <HI>he was always &s;ound in the Fundamentals,</HI> as before, then I intended to have a&s;ked, <HI>why he left us?</HI> For he advocated the &s;ame orthodox Principles which we believed and taught; but we ended quietly, and prepared to go to the great Meeting, for by this time many Friends and People were come, and coming from every Quarter, to &s;ee and hear how Matters would go between the poor <HI>Quakers,</HI> and this great Champion in his Heart <HI>George Keith,</HI> for I thought he mo&s;t re&s;embled the great <HI>Goliah</HI> of <HI>Gath,</HI> who defied the Armies of the living God, of any I had ever yet &s;een in all my Travels, in a religious re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Now to the Meeting we went; <HI>George Keith,</HI> with two Prie&s;ts, and a great many People gathered together of &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions and Qualities into one Body, and Friends and &s;ome friendly People into another Body; and as we came near to the Meeting-hou&s;e, I &s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;till, and took a View of the People, and it appcared
<PB N="115" REF="018158_0120_0FA56184284AF4E8">to me as if two Armies were going to engage in Battle: There appeared with <HI>George Keith</HI> Men of con&s;iderable E&s;tates, Parts, and Learn|ing, and we appeared like poor Shrubs; and, under a Sen&s;e of our pre&s;ent State, I had like to have been di&s;mayed, and my Faith had even like to have failed me; but I cried mightily to the God and Fountain of all our tender Mercies, that he would look down upon us, and help us in this Time of great Exerci&s;e, which was not hid from him; but his penetrating Eye &s;aw, and his watchful Providence attended us, ble&s;&s;ed be his Name for ever. I continued my fervent Prayers and Interce&s;&s;ions to the Lord of Ho&s;ts, that he would ari&s;e for his great Name's &s;ake, and work for us that Day, that the Enemies of Truth might not triumph or vaunt over us, and that none of the&s;e tender Plants, which he had brought to the &s;aving Knowledge of the Truth, might be hurt.</P>
<P>I had no &s;ooner thus heartily &s;ought to the Lord, but I felt renewed Strength come upon me, and the Fear of Man was taken away from me, and I &s;aw evidently that Truth would have the Victory that Day, and my Faith and Confidence was greatly &s;trengthened in the Lord. The&s;e breathings forth of my Spirit to the Lord were in &s;ecret, without Words to be heard by Men, but the Lord hears and knows the Di&s;tre&s;s and Language of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Being thus encouraged in my&s;elf, it aro&s;e in my Heart to &s;peak to Friends before we went into the Meeting-hou&s;e, and I advi&s;ed them <HI>to
<PB N="116" REF="018158_0121_0FA561872E0ECD50">be &s;wift to hear and &s;low to &s;peak,</HI> and that <HI>what was &s;poken might be in the Lord's Power, for that wounds</HI> George <HI>the mo&s;t, and &s;lays that wicked and ranting Spirit in him, more than all the Wi&s;dom of Words without it;</HI> and let us <HI>maintain our Te&s;timony of Denial again&s;t him, and endea|vour to get together into one Body, that we may be an Help and Strength one to another; and let every one who knows the Lord, cry mightily unto him, that his living Power and Pre&s;ence may be among&s;t us, and I believed the Lord would not &s;uffer any to be hurt.</HI> So the Meeting gathered, and immediately after, <HI>George</HI> &s;tood up to tell us (as before) <HI>that he was come in the Queen's Name to gather</HI> Quakers <HI>from</HI> Quaker|i&s;m, <HI>to the good old Mother Church, the Church of</HI> England (as he called it) <HI>and that he could prove out of our own Books, that we held</HI> Errors, Here&s;ies, damnable Doctrines <HI>and</HI> Bla&s;phemies; with a Threat <HI>to look to our&s;elves to an&s;wer, or el&s;e the Auditory would conclude, that what he exhibited again&s;t us was true.</HI> I expected &s;ome of the elder Friends would &s;ay &s;omething to him, but none did; and I having a deep Concern upon my Mind, le&s;t Truth, or the Friends of Truth, &s;hould &s;uffer thro' our Mi&s;management, and &s;uch as waited for Occa&s;ion, might have an Occa&s;ion admini&s;tred by us again&s;t our&s;elves; I &s;ay, under this Concern of Mind I &s;tood up, and &s;ignified to the People what manner of Man <HI>George Keith</HI> was; notwith&s;tanding he had walked many Years among&s;t us, yet towards the latter end of his &s;o walking with us, he grew
<PB N="117" REF="018158_0122_0FA5618895F7F660">very trouble&s;ome, by rea&s;on of a contentious Spirit which did po&s;&s;e&s;s him: and after much Labour and exerci&s;ing of Patience, and extend|ing of Love towards him; in order to recover and reclaim him, all that Labour of Love and much Forbearance would not avail, but he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in the Work of Contention and Di&s;|turbance. Then he was publicly di&s;owned, and te&s;tified again&s;t by us, as a Per&s;on with whom we had no Unity or Fellow&s;hip: And being thus ca&s;t out, <HI>he became to us</HI> (agreeable to the Sayings of Je&s;us Chri&s;t) <HI>as an Heathen Man or a Publican;</HI> and being thus disjointed, to expo&s;e us, what lay in his Power, to all &s;orts of People, he cho&s;e <HI>printing again&s;t us;</HI> wherein he hath much abu&s;ed us, in leaving out many times the explanatory Parts of Sentences, and coining Words to make the Meaning appear different from what was de&s;igned, and indeed, from what was mo&s;t fair and genuine: Therefore, &s;ome of our Friends found them&s;elves concerned to follow him in Print, for the clearing us from what he, through Envy, would have wil|lingly fa&s;tened upon us, and to return his Self|contradictions, Mi&s;interpretations, and Mi&s;ap|plications of our Writings upon him&s;elf, and to clear our own Innocency, and manife&s;t the Per|ver&s;ne&s;s and Wickedne&s;s of his Spirit: Neither do we, as a People, hold our&s;elves to be under any Obligation to follow him into foreign Parts of the World, to an&s;wer his Arraignments and Charges, not being con&s;cious to our&s;elves that we hold any thing contrary to &s;ound and
<PB N="118" REF="018158_0123_0FA56189CD1194C0">orthodox Doctrine; and al&s;o knowing that what he exhibits again&s;t us, is the Fruit of Envy and Malice, as &s;uch we reject it and trample it under our Feet; and were it not for your &s;akes, who are Strangers to the&s;e Things, we &s;hould take no further Notice of <HI>George Keith</HI> than to &s;light and reject him as a Man that cares not what he &s;ays, nor is he worthy of our Notice.</P>
<P>Then pau&s;ing a little, <HI>George</HI> being quiet, a Friend &s;tood up with a &s;hort, but living Te&s;ti|mony, and then my Companion; all this in much Weight and with good Demon&s;tration. After them it plea&s;ed the Lord to open my Mouth, I think in as much Strength, Clearne&s;s and Demon&s;tration as ever, beginning with the following Words, <HI>In that Way you call Here&s;y do we wor&s;hip the God of our Fathers, believing all Things that are written concerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t, both as to his God-head and Man|hood;</HI> giving a &s;ummary Account of his Birth, working of Miracles, &s;ome of his Doctrine, Sufferings and Death, A&s;cen&s;ion and Glorifica|tion, the Coming of the Spirit of Truth, or Comforter, to lead all tho&s;e who receive, be|lieve, and obey it, into all Truth: Having great Openings concerning the Law and Pro|phets, and the Beginning, Service and End of the Mini&s;tration of <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t. The People appeared very much down and attentive, for the Lord's heavenly baptizing Power was among&s;t us that Day: It was thought, many were there who had not been at any of our Meetings of
<PB N="119" REF="018158_0124_0FA5618A2F302F58">Wor&s;hip before, and the Pre&s;ence of the Prie&s;ts there, opened a Door for all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>I being clear, left them unto the Grace of God, and unto their free Teacher Chri&s;t, who&s;e heavenly Power in the Appearance of his Spirit, the la&s;t and la&s;ting Di&s;pen&s;ation, was exalted that Day above all the &s;hadowy and typical Things that ever had been in the World: A good Meeting it was, and Friends were mutually comforted and edified in the internal Pre&s;ence of the Lord.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;t of this Place, who&s;e Name was <HI>Sheppard,</HI> before my Mouth was opened in Te&s;timony, made Preparation to write, and when I began to &s;peak, he had his Hat upon his Knee, and his Paper upon its Crown, and Pen and Ink in his Hands, and made many Motions to write, but wrot nothing; as he be|gan &s;o he ended, without writing at all.

<P>I then &s;tood up and &s;aid, <HI>I had &s;omething to &s;ay to obviate what</HI> George Keith <HI>would in&s;inuate;</HI> for his Drift was to infu&s;e an Opinion into them, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> did not commonly preach up Faith in the <HI>Manhood</HI> of Chri&s;t, as I had done that Day; I appealed to the Auditory, whether they thought there was a Nece&s;&s;ity frequently to pre&s;s a Matter &s;o univer&s;ally re|ceived among&s;t Chri&s;tians, as <HI>Faith in the Manhood of Chri&s;t was?</HI> Yet we, as a People, had &s;o often and clearly demon&s;trated our Faith in the Manhood of Chri&s;t, both in our Te&s;timonies and Writings, as might &s;atisfy any unbia&s;&s;ed Per&s;on, or &s;uch who were not preju|diced again&s;t us; and we know not of any People who believe more &s;cripturally in the Manhood of Chri&s;t than we do: But ina&s;much as the Grace, Light and holy Spirit, is highly concerned in the Work of Man's Salvation, as
<PB N="121" REF="018158_0126_0FA5618C564683C0">well as what Chri&s;t did for us without us, and this being yet much a My&s;tery to many called Chri&s;tians, it plea&s;es God to open, in the Cour&s;e of our Mini&s;try, into the Meaning and My&s;tery thereof, and to pre&s;s the latter more than the former. To which <HI>George</HI> made no Reply, but began to exhibit his Charges again&s;t us (as men|tioned before) and &s;aid, <HI>he could prove them out of our Friends Books,</HI> naming <HI>George Fox</HI> and <HI>Ed|ward Burrough,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>He was now crowded up into the Gallery between me and the Rail, with a Paper in his Hand; and I &s;tanding over him, and being taller, could &s;ee his Quotations and his Para|phra&s;es upon them, on which I told him loudly, that all the Meeting might hear, <HI>That he offered Violence to that Sen&s;e and Under&s;tanding which God had given him, and he knew in his Con&s;cience, we were not that People, neither were our Friends Writings either damnable or bla&s;phemous, as he through Envy endeavoured to make the World believe; and that he would not have Peace in &s;o doing, but Trouble from the Lord in his Con|&s;cience.</HI> I &s;poke in the Lord's dreadful Power, and <HI>George</HI> trembled &s;o much as I &s;eldom ever &s;aw any Man do: I pitied him in my Heart, yet, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aid once concerning <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> I felt <HI>the Wrath of the Lord go forth again&s;t him:

<P>This Meeting was not only for Wor&s;hip, but al&s;o for Bu&s;ine&s;s, as I &s;aid to the People at our parting; it was Friends Monthly Meeting, in which their Poor, Fatherle&s;s, and Widows, were taken Care of, and &s;uch other Things as concern them as a People. Two Friends were de&s;ired to &s;tay, to hear what <HI>George</HI> had to &s;ay to them who remained, which &s;aid two Friends gave an Account to us afterwards, that <HI>George</HI> &s;aid to the People after we were gone, <HI>that the</HI> Quakers <HI>had left none to di&s;pute with him but an A&s;s and a Fool;</HI> when I heard it, I &s;aid, could you not have replied, <HI>An A&s;s was once made &s;ufficient to reprove the Madne&s;s of the Prophet.</HI></P>

<P><HI>George</HI> made little Di&s;turbance in the begin|ning of the Meeting, but commanded the Governor <HI>to quiet the</HI> Quakers: A Prie&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Mr.</HI> Keith, <HI>you ought not to command the Governor, but intreat him;</HI> well then, he intreated the Governor to quiet the <HI>Quakers</HI> that he might be heard; whereupon the Governor, like a Man of Ju&s;tice and Wi&s;dom, &s;tood up and &s;aid, <HI>It was not in his Power to quiet the</HI> Quakers; <HI>ina&s;much as the Hou&s;e is theirs, and they have appointed the Meeting, it is but rea&s;onable they &s;hould have their Liberty, and if they be willing, when they have done, you have your Liberty to &s;ay what you have to &s;ay to tho&s;e who will &s;tay to hear you:</HI> So the Governor being next me, leaned his Hand upon me, and went away in a &s;ober Manner. <HI>George</HI> was quiet, and we had a good Meeting, and &s;o parted.</P>
<P>After mo&s;t of the Friends were gone, a Friend and I went to the Meeting-hou&s;e Door, to hear what <HI>George</HI> &s;aid; he held his Bible in his Hand, and &s;aid it was promi&s;ed, <HI>that the Go&s;pel &s;hould be preached unto every Creature under Heaven; but if it was truly tran&s;lated, it would be</HI> in every Creature, (<HI>not in every Creature as</HI> Hor&s;e, Cow, &amp;c. <HI>but in every rational Creature of Mankind:</HI>) And then their Meeting broke up in Confu&s;ion.</P>

When I was in the Yearly-meeting upon <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> there was a Query concerning what Friends might do, in ca&s;e there &s;hould be a Lay or Tax laid upon the Inhabitants for building &s;ome Fortifications, and to provide Men and Arms for the Security of the I&s;land?

<P>When I was at <HI>William Penn</HI>'s Country Hou&s;e, called <HI>Pennsbury</HI> in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> where I &s;taid two or three Days, on one of which I was at a Meeting and a Marriage, and much of the other Part of the Time I &s;pent in &s;eeing

<P>I much de&s;ire that all <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> (whether they may be &s;uch in Reality or Profe&s;&s;ion only) may endeavour to imitate the&s;e People in tho&s;e Things which are &s;o commendable, which may be a Means to prevent Lo&s;s of Time and expedite Bu&s;ine&s;s; as much as may be endea|vouring to prevent above one &s;peaking at a time in Meetings of Conference and of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When much of the Matters were gone through, I put <HI>William Penn</HI> in mind to enquire of the Interpreter, if he could find &s;ome Terms or Words that might be intelligible to them, in a religious Sen&s;e, by which he might reach the Under&s;tandings of the Natives, and inculcate into their Minds a Sen&s;e of the Principles of Truth, &s;uch as <HI>Chri&s;t's manife&s;ting him&s;elf to the inward Sen&s;es of the Soul, by his Light, Grace or holy Spirit,</HI> with the Manner <HI>of the Operations and working thereof in the Hearts of the Children of Men, and how it did reprove for Evil, and mini&s;ter Peace and Comfort to the Soul in its Obedience and Well-doing;</HI> or, as near as he could, come to the Sub&s;tance of this in their own Language. <HI>William Penn</HI> much pre&s;&s;ed the Matter upon the Interpreter to do his be&s;t, in any Terms,
<PB N="136" REF="018158_0141_0FA5619B69B713C0">that might reach their Capacities, and an&s;wer the End intended: But the Interpreter would not, either by rea&s;on, as he alledged, of <HI>Want of Terms,</HI> or his <HI>Unwillingne&s;s</HI> to meddle in religious Matters, which I know not, but I rather think the latter was the main Rea&s;on which ob&s;tructed him; therefore we found nothing was like to be done according to our De&s;ires in this Matter, as the Interpreter was but a dark Man, and, as <HI>William Penn</HI> &s;aid, <HI>a wrong Man for our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Penn</HI> &s;aid, he under&s;tood they owned a <HI>&s;uperior Power,</HI> and a&s;ked the Interpreter, <HI>What their Notion was of God in their own Way?</HI> The Interpreter &s;hewed, by making &s;e|veral Circles on the Ground with his Staff, till he reduced the la&s;t into a &s;mall Circumference, and placed, as he &s;aid, by way of Repre&s;entation, the <HI>great Man</HI> (as they termed him) in the middle Circle, &s;o that he could &s;ee over all the other Circles, which included all the Earth. And we querying, <HI>What they owned as to</HI> Eter|nity, <HI>or a</HI> future State?

<PB N="137" REF="018158_0142_0FA5619C48487BC0">valued by the&s;e Natives. I thought, ina&s;much as the&s;e poor Creatures had not the Knowledge of God by the Scriptures, as we have who are called, <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> but what Knowledge they had of the <HI>&s;upreme Being</HI> mu&s;t be by an inward Sen&s;ation, or by contemplating upon the Works of God in the Creation, or probably from &s;ome Tradition handed down from Father to Son, by which it appears, they acknowledge a future State of <HI>Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments;</HI> the former of which they expre&s;s by <HI>Warmth, good Cloath|ing</HI> and <HI>Food,</HI> and the latter by <HI>Nakedne&s;s, pining Hunger</HI> and <HI>piercing Cold.</HI></P>
<P>I have often thought and &s;aid, when I was among&s;t them, that generally my Spirit was very ea&s;y, and I did not feel that Power of Darkne&s;s to oppre&s;s me, as I had done in many Places among the People called <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>After <HI>William Penn</HI> and they had expre&s;&s;ed their Satisfaction, both for them&s;elves and their People, in keeping all their former Articles unviolated, and agreed that if any particular Differences did happen among&s;t any of their People, they &s;hould not be an Occa&s;ion of fo|menting or creating any War between <HI>William Penn's</HI> People and the <HI>Indians,</HI> but Ju&s;tice &s;hould be done in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, that all Animo&s;ities might be prevented on all Sides for ever; they went out of the Hou&s;e into an open Place not far from it, to perform their <HI>Cantico</HI> or <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> which was done thus; Fir&s;t, the made a &s;mall Fire, and the Men without the Women &s;at down about it in a Ring, and what&s;oever Object.

<P>I leave <HI>Penn&s;bury,</HI> but intend, before I leave the <HI>Indians,</HI> to &s;ay &s;omething more concerning that People, which I met with near <HI>Caleb Pu&s;y's</HI> Hou&s;e in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> viz.

And when the Interpreter expre&s;&s;ed the&s;e Things to them in their own Language, they wept, and Tears ran down their naked Bodies, and they &s;mote their Hands upon their Brea&s;ts and I perceived &s;aid &s;omething to the Interpreter: I a&s;ked <HI>what they &s;aid?</HI> He told me they &s;aid, <HI>all that I had delivered to them was good, and ex|cept the great Man had &s;ent me, I could not have told them tho&s;e Things.</HI> I de&s;ired the Interpreter to a&s;k them, <HI>how the knew what I had &s;aid to them was good?</HI> they replied, and &s;mote their Hands on their Brea&s;ts, <HI>the good Man here</HI> (meaning in their Hearts) <HI>told them what I had &s;aid was all good.</HI> They manife&s;ted much Love to me in their Way, and I believe the Love of God is to them, and all People in the Day of their Vi&s;itation.</P>

<PB N="146" REF="018158_0151_0FA561A5918C6E80">good Condition but crazy, with only one &s;mall Sail: We &s;et out, as we thought, in good time to reach our de&s;ired Port, but when we were upon the great River (as I remember 'tis ten Miles over the &s;horte&s;t way, but the manner of our cro&s;&s;ing it made it more) the wind veered much again&s;t us, being then within about four Points of our Cour&s;e, and it rained hard, and was very dark, &s;o that we could &s;carce &s;ee one another, and the Water broke &s;o into the Boat, that it was mo&s;t of one Man's Work to heave it out, and all our Company were di&s;couraged, and mo&s;t of them very Sea-&s;ick: <HI>Henry Ho&s;ier,</HI> of whom I had the mo&s;t Hopes for Help, &s;aid, <HI>that he could not &s;teer the Boat any longer.</HI> What by the extream Darkne&s;s, the Roughne&s;s of the Waves, Boi&s;terou&s;ne&s;s of the Wind, and hard Rain, I, unwell as I was, was obliged to under|take the &s;teering of the Boat, and not without &s;ome Conflicts of Mind, not having any Cer|tainty, from any outward Rule, what Way we went; having no Fire, and the Boat being open, we could not have any Light to &s;ee our Compa&s;s, but my Faith was in the Lord; that he would bring us to &s;hore; and I kept the Boat as near the wind as &s;he would &s;ail, and told my poor &s;ick and helple&s;s Company, <HI>I believed that we &s;hould not peri&s;h, although we might mi&s;s of our Port:</HI> But the like imminent Danger, I think, I was never in before upon any Water; but renowned over all be the great Name of the Lord for ever, we put into the Mouth of our de&s;ired River <HI>Perquimus</HI> as tho'
<PB N="147" REF="018158_0152_0FA561A5F8316BF8">we had &s;een it in the Day, or &s;teered by a Compa&s;s, neither of which we had the Benefit of for &s;everal Hours.</P>
<P>Here we went a&s;hore and made a great Fire under the River's Cliff, and about Midnight the Moon ro&s;e, and it cleared up and froze, and was very cold: My Companions falling a&s;leep, I turned them over, and pulled them from the Fire as it increa&s;ed, and put them nearer as it failed, but could not keep them awake; I &s;ought Logs of Wood, and carried them to and minded the Fire, which was work enough for the remaining part of the Night; but Morning being come, we got into our cold icy Boat and &s;ailed away towards the Meeting. When we were come among Friends, Notice was given of a Stranger being there, and a heavenly and &s;weet Meeting it was, &s;o that we thought we had a good Reward for all our Trouble, ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the Lord now and for ever, for he is worthy: Although he may &s;ee good to try us, &s;ometimes one way and &s;ometimes another, how &s;hould we know that we have any Faith, if it be not tried? How &s;hall we know that we have any true Love to God, if it never be proved? The Trial of the true Believers Faith is more precious than Gold. The ex|cellent Sayings of <HI>Job</HI> came into my Mind, <HI>Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: On the left Hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: He hideth him&s;elf on the right Hand, that I cannot &s;ee him,</HI> Job xxiii. 8, 9. And then

<P>I had a Meeting when in <HI>Virginia,</HI> at a Friend's Hou&s;e who&s;e Name was <HI>Matthew Jordan,</HI> and &s;omething which I &s;aid in the Meeting, &s;omewhat offended a young Woman a <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and not having, as &s;he &s;aid, a &s;uitable Opportunity while I was there, to di&s;|cour&s;e with me, being bu&s;y in her Ma&s;ter's Af|fairs, (for &s;he was the Friend's Hou&s;e-keeper) &s;he de&s;ired Liberty of her Ma&s;ter to go to the next Meeting, that there &s;he might ea&s;e her Mind to me about the Offence I had given her in the fir&s;t Meeting; (it was &s;omething about <HI>Election,</HI> and they told me what it was, but not writing it down, it went from me) and accordingly &s;he came to the Meeting, where the Lord's mighty Power broke in upon us, to the tendring of many Hearts, to Friends mutal Satis|faction, and it proved a good Day to the afore&s;aid young Woman; her heart was as if it had melted within her, and &s;he &s;hed many Tears, and I am &s;atisfied went from the Meeting in Fear and in great Joy; in <HI>Fear,</HI> how to walk as not to offend Chri&s;t the <HI>Elect,</HI> which before &s;he could talk of, but now &s;he had met with, and he had
<PB N="149" REF="018158_0154_0FA561A76AE15350">opened her State to her: And <HI>Joy,</HI> that &s;he had met with the Me&s;&s;iah, the <HI>Elect of the Father,</HI> his choice and beloved Son; &s;o that &s;he could now &s;ay, <HI>Where are the Wi&s;e? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Di&s;puter of this World?</HI> All her bri&s;k talkative Qualities were &s;wallowed up in the feeling of the internal, enlightning Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>When &s;he returned to her Ma&s;ter's (before mentioned) he a&s;ked her, <HI>If &s;he had got Satis|faction?</HI> meaning, had &s;he had any di&s;cour&s;e with me and was &s;atisfied? She replied, <HI>She was &s;atisfied.</HI> Some Time after I met with her in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> plain and Truth-like, but knew not who &s;he was at fir&s;t. The Manner of the Working of the Truth is to humble the Creature, and bring it into Contrition, Tender|ne&s;s, and Fear, with true Self-denial.</P>
<P>I come now to mention &s;ometing that hap|pened in my going over <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>River,</HI> towards a Yearly-meeting in <HI>Virginia:</HI> Alighting at an Inn by the River-&s;ide where we refre&s;hed our|&s;elves, there was a poor little Child cried &s;o exceedingly, that I was unea&s;y to hear it, and a&s;ked the Mother what was the matter? She &s;aid, it had cried mo&s;t of the Time &s;ince it was born, and they were almo&s;t off their Feet with it, or to that effect. I told her, I believed I could give the Child &s;omething which would do good, and &s;he readily agreed to it, and I gave it a little of &s;omething then, and ordered her to give it twice more in four or five Days
<PB N="150" REF="018158_0155_0FA561A82EB6D4F0">time: But when I returned, the Child was better, and oh! how glad the poor Woman was to &s;ee me, and &s;poke more in my Commend|ations than was to my Satisfaction, and was kind to Friends afterward for my &s;ake.</P>
<P>Now we came to ferry over the River, being, as I remember, five Hor&s;es and nine People; there was <HI>Jane Plea&s;ant</HI> a publick Friend, and her Man-&s;ervant who rid before her upon a great Hor&s;e, and high in Fle&s;h, and about the Mid&s;t of the River, it being two Miles over, he ro&s;e upon his hind Feet, and flung him&s;elf upon the Edge or Gunnel of the Boat, half into the River; the Fall of the Hor&s;e, and the Motion of the other Hor&s;es thereupon, cau&s;ed the Boat to make &s;uch Sallies that it took in Water, and was very likely to &s;ink: But be|fore he could have Time to ri&s;e again, or to make any more Springs, I took &s;everal young Men by the Shoulders, and flung them upon his Neck to keep him down, and told them, as fa&s;t as I could, why I did &s;o. Now I had to deal with the Ferry-man, who was about to &s;trip for &s;wimming, and &s;aid <HI>we &s;hould all be drowned; but for his Part he could &s;wim;</HI> and was about to leap into the River, <HI>for,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>the Boat would either break or &s;ink.</HI> I told him, <HI>It was &s;oon enough for him to &s;wim, when he &s;aw the Boat either break or &s;ink, and if he would not row, then I would:</HI> With much Intreaty he took the Oar again and rowed us to the Shore. But in our imminent Danger I looked over my tender Friends, (for &s;o they
<PB N="151" REF="018158_0156_0FA561A9E832B9C8">appeared to me) and thought in my Heart what a Pity it would be, if all the&s;e were drowned! yet the Thought of my own drowning never entered my Mind, until I was got over the River, which was a Mercy to me, and a great Means to keep out Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion, which commonly attend &s;udden Surprizes and Frights, or el&s;e they make People dead-hearted and almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>As I had now an Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, as well as in &s;ome imminent Dangers I had &s;een before, where I happened to be, I find it an excellent thing to be, as much as we can, always ready, and by being frequently thinking upon Death, it is not &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing when it does come: This is a great Point of true Wi&s;dom, <HI>to number our Days &s;o, as to remember our latter End.</HI> The want of thus contemplating and truly thinking on what Preparation we are in to look Death in the Face, and to appear before the great Judge of both Quick and Dead, was the Cau&s;e of the Complaint, <HI>Oh! that my People were wi&s;e, that they under&s;tood this, that they would con&s;ider their latter End.</HI> The great Remi&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch Con|&s;iderations among People, be&s;peaks Folly and great In&s;en&s;ibility, and that the Heart is hard|ened through an Habit of &s;inning; oh! that I might prevail with the Children of Men to awake. Ari&s;e, you that &s;leep in Sin, and are at ea&s;e therein, that you may come to hear in|wardly the Call of the Son of God, that your Souls may not only live here to &s;erve God, but al&s;o may live eternally in Bli&s;s with him, is the
<PB N="152" REF="018158_0157_0FA561AAAD0BC0E8">De&s;ire of my Soul for the whole Bulk of Man|kind; for my Life has often appeared not dear to me, in Compari&s;on of the &s;aving of the Souls of the Children of Men.</P>
<P>I have often thought of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> how far he went for &s;aving of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and how far <HI>Paul</HI> went for the &s;aving of his Kinsfolk after the Fle&s;h; it was a great Demon&s;tration, that the&s;e great and good Men had great Faith and Intere&s;t in the Lord, and al&s;o a very great Love to his People; and &s;uch who&s;e Eyes are truly opened, cannot but &s;ee it is the Love of God, and Love to the Souls of Men, that con&s;trains us thus to take our Lives as in our Hands, and labour under many weary Steps, and many Perils by Sea and by Land, and in the Wilderne&s;s, Cold and &s;ometimes in Tumults and Noi&s;es, &s;ome|times in Watchings and Fa&s;tings, that we have been &s;ometimes Spectacles to Men; but the Lord hath given us Faith and Patience to bear and overcome all, as we have &s;ingly &s;tood in his heavenly Coun&s;el, and been truly devoted to his Will in all Things.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to mention a particular thing which happened to me before I left <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> viz. Knowing that my Landlady, <HI>Samuel Bowne</HI>'s Wife, had a very &s;ore Brea&s;t, by which &s;he had much Trouble, and had no le&s;s than five Tents in it, and &s;he being a &s;en&s;ible and a &s;erviceable Woman, &s;omething came with a Concern upon my Mind to admini&s;ter unto her Brea&s;t, with a Belief, <HI>it would heal her:</HI> I rea|&s;oned about it until I had got one Foot into the
<PB N="153" REF="018158_0158_0FA561AB30429D40">Stirrup for mounting my Hor&s;e, but I grew unea&s;y for being dilatory in doing that which came into my Mind; &s;o I went in again and &s;aid, <HI>Mary, I am come back to advi&s;e thee what thou &s;hould&s;t do, by which, I believe</HI> thou wilt be healed, <HI>although I cannot &s;tay to &s;ee it done. I believe,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>and intend to follow thy Advice;</HI> but a&s;ked, <HI>what would become of all tho&s;e Tents?</HI> I told her, <HI>the Poultice would draw them all out and give her Ea&s;e;</HI> and accordingly I heard it did, for &s;he &s;lept twelve Hours immediately after the Time of the Application, and when &s;he awoke the Tents were all drawn out, and &s;he had little further Trouble with it: So it is good to mind Truth and the Workings of it in all Things. I met with the great Doctor (as he was e&s;teemed) who had it under hand, and he &s;aid <HI>I was a bold Fellow:</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>it proved well.</HI> He an&s;wered, <HI>it was well for me it did.</HI></P>
<P>Something more which I have before omitted occurs to my Memory: When I was in that Part of <HI>Virginia</HI> towards <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> to vi&s;it Friends, a very great Mi&s;t aro&s;e, and we went wrong, until the Guides were &s;o far lo&s;t, that they confe&s;t, they knew not Ea&s;t from We&s;t, nor on which Hand we had left the Road, although it was in the fore Part of the Day, but neither Wind or Sun to be felt or &s;een; then I told them, <HI>I would try what I could do, if they did but know what Quarter we &s;hould go to:</HI> They &s;aid, <HI>we &s;hould go towards the South;</HI> then I brought out my little Compa&s;s which I had made before I left <HI>England,</HI> and took it in
<PB N="154" REF="018158_0159_0FA561ABE8E1D200">my Hand and &s;teered by it, till we all came into the Road; for that inward Sen&s;e I had did per|&s;uade me, that we were to the We&s;tward of the Road, &s;o leaning a little to the Ea&s;tward of the South Point, we came right as before, and when &s;o, the Guides much rejoiced, and &s;aid, <HI>I was fitter to be Guide in a Wilderne&s;s Country than they.</HI> My Compa&s;s was not &s;o big as a Tailor's Thimble, which had often been of U&s;e to me, and others with me.</P>
<P>Now the Time came on for my leaving all my near and dear Friends in tho&s;e Parts, and I embarked for the I&s;lands the Sixth of the Ninth Month, 1702, with my Companion <HI>James Bates,</HI> on board of a Sloop, <HI>Samuel Salter</HI> Ma&s;ter, for <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and we put into <HI>Bermudas</HI> in our way: Soon after we landed, being on the 21&s;t of the &s;ame Month, we were &s;ent for by Governor <HI>Bennett</HI> to come before him, and being near his Door, a Man came and clapt me on the Shoulder, as we were walking on our way, and &s;aid roughly to us, <HI>You mu&s;t go before the Governor,</HI> and &s;eemed to ha&s;ten us: I replied meekly, <HI>I am willing to go as fa&s;t as I can, but I have been very Sea-&s;ick, and can go but weakly:</HI> The Man fell from his Roughne&s;s, and bid us take Time, and carried him&s;elf very civilly to us, and put us by a Man who was keeping Centry at the Governor's Door with his Mu&s;ket on his Arm, and when we were come into a large Room the Man left us, and we &s;taying a while, I began to rea&s;on in my&s;elf, <HI>What if the Governor &s;hould be a rigid Man and
<PB N="155" REF="018158_0160_0FA561ACAFBBBA00">be &s;evere to us, and either confine or puni&s;h us?</HI> But I &s;aid in my Heart, <HI>Lord, thou that knowe&s;t all Things, knowe&s;t that I have not only offered up my Liberty, but Life al&s;o, for thy Name and Go&s;pel's &s;ake!</HI> and immediately all the Fear and Rea&s;onings about human Power was taken away from me.</P>
<P>I being not well, and weary with walk|ing from the Ship, &s;ate down to re&s;t my&s;elf unbidden, when there came a friendly well carriaged young Woman, who I &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Servant, and &s;poke kindly to us; I de&s;ired her to do as much for us as to give us &s;omething that was &s;mall to drink, for we were very thir&s;ty and had been much out of Health, and were not well recovered &s;ince we came from the Sea, having had rough Weather: She brought us Wine and Water, and a Thing to mix them in; &s;o taking mo&s;t of a Gla&s;s of Water, and a very little Wine poured into it, I drank and was very well refre&s;hed. By this Time the Go|vernor called us into an upper Room, and as I came near to the Top of the Stairs, going but faintly, for Rea&s;ons before given, the Governor put forth his Hand and reached to take hold of mine, and like a tender Father drew me up, and led me along towards a great Window, and &s;tood and looked on me and &s;aid, <HI>He believed he knew what I was, and my Bu&s;ine&s;s too.</HI> I replied, <HI>it might be &s;o,</HI> and a&s;ked, <HI>if he was the Governor of that Place?</HI> He &s;aid <HI>he was,</HI> and bowed his Head. I then &s;poke to him in the Love of God and &s;aid, <HI>Thy Countenance be&s;peaks

He wanting to know the Affairs in <HI>Europe,</HI> I told him, <HI>There was a Merchant belonging to the &s;ame Ship that we did, who was lately come from</HI> Europe, <HI>and I thought was a Man of Parts and Memory, and well ver&s;ed in the Affairs of tho&s;e Parts of the World, and when we came into this Place he was with us:</HI> The Governor then &s;ent for him, and when he came, he an&s;wered his Expectation in re&s;olving all or mo&s;t of his Que&s;tions, for the Knowledge of the News appeared to me to be the young Man's Talent. Having done with and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, he &s;aid, <HI>he mu&s;t now have &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with us:</HI> Then ro&s;e up all the great Men who were with the Governor, to make way that I might come near him.

<P><HI>Now,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I want to know the Rea&s;ons why you, as a People, where you live, do not a&s;&s;i&s;t the King and Country with Men and Arms, for their and your own Defence and Safety, again&s;t all that may attempt or endeavour your

<P>Now coming to take Hor&s;e, I looked out at the Door and &s;aw two Hor&s;es, and a Man hold|ing them beyond the Pavement, and the Centry as before in the Street, and the Hor&s;e next the Door, which I &s;uppo&s;ed I was to ride on, had a Saddle on the Back of it &s;et about with three Rows of &s;hining Silver Lace, I thought about two Inches broad each: The Governor holding me by the Hand and looking in my Face, its not unlikely but he might think, as I u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>I looked very &s;heepi&s;hly at it.</HI> He &s;aid to me, I am apt to think you are not u&s;ed to ride upon &s;uch a Saddle as this; I told him, if he could let me have one more like my&s;elf (plain) without much Trouble, I &s;hould like it the
<PB N="160" REF="018158_0165_0FA561B2B40D4D58">better, but if not, I could ride on it, I thought without much Straitne&s;s, in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity. He an&s;wered, he could not, for Hor&s;es and Saddles too were &s;carce on that I&s;land, for the one was that which he rid on, and the other was for his Man; but he &s;aid, he would tell me how to prevent all this: If, &s;aid he, you get over the Inlet of Water, though he que&s;|tioned it, becau&s;e the Wind blew very &s;trong in the Mouth or Inlet of the River; but, he &s;aid, he &s;poke not this to hinder our taking his Hor&s;es, but if we got over, he &s;aid we &s;hould come to <HI>Richard Stafford</HI>'s, an old Judge of Life and Death, and might a&s;k there for the Cover for his Saddle, which ties on with little Straps at each Corner and hides all this, and then it will be like your&s;elf; but if the Ferry|man &s;ays he cannot carry the Hor&s;es over, what Man &s;oever you meet, white or black, if capable, tell him he mu&s;t bring me my Hor&s;es, he dares do no other but bring them; and be &s;ure you take no further Thought for them: And if we met with any thing in his Liberty that might trouble us, let him but know and he would help it, if it lay in his Power, and &s;o with his Ble&s;&s;ing on us, we took leave of him and came to the Water-&s;ide, but could not get the Hor&s;es over, therefore &s;ent them back again, and intended to have &s;taid at the Ferry-hou&s;e all Night, but the Boat was about going over as we lighted; and Notice being got &s;ome way or other to the Judge's Ear, that there were two Strangers on the other Side of the Water,
<PB N="161" REF="018158_0166_0FA561B375D3E458">he had &s;ent a Boat and a couple of Men for us, who &s;aid we mu&s;t go, for the Judge &s;aid, he could not &s;leep until we came; what&s;oever the matter is, we know not, &s;aid they: So we went, after a&s;king if they at the Ferry-hou&s;e had been at any Co&s;t or Trouble on our Account in providing Supper, for as yet we had not eaten any thing &s;ince we landed; the People &s;aid no, they had not done any thing which we &s;hould pay for: It grew dark and very &s;tormy, and the Sea broke over the Boat, &s;o that &s;ome of us were forced to hold our Coat Laps one to touch another on the Weather Side, to keep out the Breakers of the Waves, that they might not fill the Boat, and we came &s;afe over to the Judge's Hou&s;e, and no &s;ooner got into the Pa&s;&s;age but his friendly Wife met us, and a&s;ked us, <HI>If we were the Strangers her Husband had &s;ent for?</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>We are Strangers.</HI> She bid us follow her to the Judge, and we did &s;o. When we came to him he ro&s;e up, and took the Candle in his Hand and &s;aid, <HI>Are you the Strangers that I have &s;ent for?</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>Who thou may&s;t expect I know not, but we are Strangers.</HI> When he had looked well in my Face, he &s;et down the Candle and &s;aid, <HI>What a Mercy is this, that the Lord &s;hould &s;end Men from I know not where, in his Love to vi&s;it me!</HI> and took me in his Arms and ki&s;&s;ed me; and I &s;aid to him, <HI>The Lord of Hea|ven and Earth ble&s;s thee;</HI> and we &s;hed many Tears and wept together.</P>
<P>As I entred the Hou&s;e, I felt the Love of God, and his Glory, I thought, &s;hone in and filled
<PB N="162" REF="018158_0167_0FA561B432C7E0C0">every Room as I pa&s;&s;ed through them, and I &s;aid, <HI>Peace be to this Place,</HI> and I felt it was &s;o. He enquired of our Travels, and from whence we came, of which we gave him a brief Ac|count; he al&s;o a&s;ked if I knew any thing of the Family of <HI>Staffords</HI> at <HI>Lahorn</HI> near <HI>Haver|fordwe&s;t</HI> in <HI>South Wales?</HI> I told him all I knew about them, both of the Dead and of the Liv|ing; with which he was plea&s;ed, and &s;aid, <HI>He had not heard of them many Years, and that Fa|mily were his near Kindred.</HI></P>
<P>Now as the Judge was &s;omewhat troubled with the Gout, I found his u&s;ual Bed-time drew near, and I made an Offer to go away le&s;t I &s;hould di&s;commode him, yet he appeared unwilling to part with us; but con&s;idering his own Ailments and our early Ri&s;ing in the Morning, he at length con&s;ented: But before we parted, his Wife a&s;ked leave of him to go with us on the Morrow to the Meeting, to which he readily a&s;&s;ented, if he was not wor&s;e of his Di&s;temper, and then ordered how we &s;hould ride, and which Negro &s;hould go, not only to help his Wife but us al&s;o, and take our Hor&s;es when there was occa&s;ion, and do any thing he could for us; and indeed &s;o he did, and appeared to me to run on his Feet without much Trouble, being a lively young Man.</P>
<P>I omitted before, that the Judge a&s;ked, <HI>If we had &s;een the Governor,</HI> and <HI>if he was kind to us?</HI> I told him he was very friendly to us, and &s;aid, <HI>If we met with any Trouble in his Liberty that he could help us in, only let him know and he
<PB N="163" REF="018158_0168_0FA561B4FB65E308">would right us.</HI> The Judge &s;aid, <HI>It was very well, and he was glad of it.</HI> I perceived the Judge was rather a Moderator of the Governor, he being an ancient wi&s;e Man, and had lived long as a Judge upon the I&s;land, and under|&s;tood (it is like) more fully the State of Things there than the Governor could be capable of, he being but a young Man, altho' he appeared to be a wi&s;e Man, and, as <HI>William Penn</HI> &s;aid, came of an ancient and honourable Family in <HI>England,</HI> which he knew very well, who&s;e Name was <HI>Bennett.</HI> Afterwards I told <HI>William Penn</HI> how it had fared with us on that I&s;land, and e&s;pecially the Kindne&s;s of the two chief Men in Power there, and <HI>William Penn</HI> wept, and &s;aid, <HI>He had not heard any Account of this Nature, that he had been &s;o much affected with, as he re|membered the&s;e many Years.</HI></P>
<P>Now we left the Judge until the Morning, and got &s;ome &s;mall Refre&s;hment, it being late, and I had been faint for &s;everal Hours for want of eating, but the Lord's heavenly Power bore me up over all, &s;o that at Times I felt no want of any thing: Oh! Renowned over all be the Name of the Mighty God, now and for ever. We went to Bed, and when Morning came, I with my Companion were &s;tirring early, having eight Miles to the Meeting, and it being in the latter End of the Ninth Month, we were will|ing to be in &s;uch Time, that we might give &s;ome Notice to the People. I was walking in our Lodging Room early, and the Judge's Wife came to the Door and a&s;ked, <HI>if &s;he might &s;peak
<PB N="164" REF="018158_0169_0FA561B5A82E6850">with us?</HI> I &s;aid <HI>&s;he might;</HI> then &s;he came in and &s;aid, <HI>She had a Me&s;&s;age from her Husband to us;</HI> I queried, <HI>what it was,</HI> She &s;aid, <HI>He de&s;ired we would come and pray for him before we went away.</HI> I de&s;ired &s;he would favour us &s;o much as to lay before her Hu&s;band &s;omething which I had to &s;ay, and &s;he promi&s;ed &s;he would: <HI>Well then, tell the Judge, that if he will &s;uffer us to come into his Room, and &s;it down and wait upon the Lord, as our Manner is in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this, if it plea&s;e the Lord to move us by his Holy Spirit to pray, we may; but if not, let not the Judge take it ami&s;s, for we are willing to be at the Lord's di&s;po&s;ing in all Things.</HI> She went, and I believe, as &s;he &s;aid, laid the Matter before him as I had delivered it to her; for &s;he was a Woman of a good Under|&s;tanding, and came back again to us in a very little Time: I a&s;ked, <HI>what the Judge &s;aid?</HI> She replied, he &s;aid, <HI>Let the Men take their own Way, and whether they pray for me or not, I believe they are Men of God:</HI> So after &s;ome little re&s;pite, we being brought to the Judge's Bed-&s;ide, &s;at down and waited upon the Lord, who was plea&s;ed in his Love and by his mighty Power to break in upon us, and al&s;o opened my Mouth in his Gift of Grace and of Supplica|tion, in which Gift, ardent and fervent Cries went up to the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that he would &s;end Health and Salvation to the Judge, and al&s;o to all his Family, and to all People far and near, that all every where might repent, and come to the Knowledge of the
<PB N="165" REF="018158_0170_0FA561B777AFFF28">Truth and be &s;aved. The Judge wept aloud; and a mighty Vi&s;itation it was to his Family, and e&s;pecially to him&s;elf and his tender Wife. We left the Judge in a fine Frame of Spirit, and no doubt near the Kingdom, having his Ble&s;&s;ing and earne&s;t Reque&s;t, that when we could reach his Hou&s;e we would not fail to come to it, for we were very welcome; and I found and felt it &s;o, and it was mo&s;tly our Lodgings: His Wife and Foot-Page went with us to all the Meetings, except one, while we were on the I&s;land, which was about two Weeks, in which Time we had many good Opportunities among a &s;ober behaved and well carriaged People, among&s;t whom we met with no Oppo&s;ition, but had large quiet Meetings.</P>
<P>When we were clear, as we thought, of the I&s;land, we went to take our &s;olid Leaves of the Governor, acknowledging his Civility and Ge|nero&s;ity to us Strangers, and I told him and the Judge, <HI>That they would not want their Reward for what they had done to us, and &s;uch who &s;hould take their Lives as in their Hands, and come in the Love of God to vi&s;it the&s;e remote Parts of the World, which we dur&s;t not have undertaken if we had not believed it required of us by the Almighty, and our Peace concerned in it, as al&s;o the Glory of God, and the Good of the Children of Men; the&s;e are the Motives to tho&s;e our great Undertakings:</HI> or Words to that Purpo&s;e. So we parted in much Love with the&s;e great Men, e&s;pecially the Judge, with Tears on his Face, as al&s;o his tender and friendly Wife, who had been very
<PB N="166" REF="018158_0171_0FA561B8DDD9E438">&s;erviceable to us in ordering Meetings and making Way for us, and none like her in all the I&s;land, that we met withal, &s;he being given up to that Service, for the encouraging Truth and Friends in what &s;he was capable of.</P>
<P>Being invited to a Friend's Hou&s;e to dine one Day, when we were &s;at down at the Table, the Woman of the Hou&s;e de&s;ired <HI>that one of us would &s;ay Grace;</HI> from which I took an Oc|ca&s;ion to &s;hew her, and &s;everal more in the Company, who appeared not much more grown in the Truth than &s;he, <HI>that &s;ince we had been a People, we had both believed</HI> (and accordingly practi&s;ed) <HI>that</HI> true Prayer <HI>was not performed without the</HI> Help of the holy Spirit of God, <HI>and no man could pray</HI> aright <HI>and</HI> acceptably <HI>without it; nor was it in Man's Power to have it</HI> when he plea&s;ed; <HI>therefore it is Man's place to wait upon the Lord for the</HI> pouring forth of this Gift <HI>upon him, and al&s;o to know whether it</HI> be required of him to pray, <HI>&s;o as to be heard by Man, or only to pray</HI> &s;ecretly, <HI>&s;o as to be heard of God, as did</HI> Hannah <HI>and many more have done; which, as they do aright, no doubt, but as Chri&s;t &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples,</HI> their Father will hear them in &s;ecret, and reward them openly; or to this Effect: With which they all appeared &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>We then went on board our Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;et &s;ail with a fair Wind for the Ea&s;t End of the I&s;land in order for <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but &s;oon after we got out to the Mouth of that Inlet where we arrived fir&s;t, the Wind came full again&s;t us, and we put in there again; and the Ma&s;ter, altho' not called one of
<PB N="167" REF="018158_0172_0FA561B9A54E8D68">us, &s;aid in a friendly manner, <HI>What is the matter now? this is along of you, Mr.</HI> Richard&s;on (as he was plea&s;ed to call me, altho' I oft &s;hewed my Di&s;like to it) <HI>you have &s;omething to do yet on the I&s;land.</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>I knew not of any thing;</HI> but he &s;eemed po&s;itive, and withal &s;aid, <HI>if the Wind came fair at Midnight he would call if I was willing; if not, he would &s;tay as long as I plea&s;ed.</HI> I &s;aid, I knew not of any thing to hinder, but he might call as &s;oon as the Wind came fair. So we parted, only giving him an Account, that we intended to go for the Judge's Hou&s;e. It was late in the Evening when we got there, and the Judge was gone to Bed; but his Wife was up, who lifted up her Hands with more than ordinary Surprize, and much Joy, and &s;aid, <HI>She was always glad to &s;ee me, but never more than now:</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>Why &s;o?</HI> She then be|gan to tell, how that &s;ince I went away, there had been a Man with the Judge, who had in|cen&s;ed him again&s;t me all that ever he could, and &s;aid, <HI>He knew me in</HI> England, <HI>and that I was broke, and came into tho&s;e Parts to preach for a Living.</HI> I a&s;ked, <HI>what her Hu&s;band &s;aid to all that?</HI> She &s;aid, his An&s;wer was to the Man, <HI>that he believed I was no &s;uch Per&s;on, but an hone&s;t Man;</HI> yet the Accu&s;er &s;eemed very po&s;itive. I &s;aid, <HI>It would be well if this Man could be brought with me to the Judge's Face, that he might he convinced, not only of the Man's Ignorance of us as a People, but of me in particular, and his Envy again&s;t me be made known;</HI> upon which I opened to her the ca&s;e of &s;uch Journeys and
<PB N="168" REF="018158_0173_0FA561BA438CBCB8">Services, how we proceeded, and how the Meet|ings were con&s;tituted in which we did &s;o pro|ceed, and from whence we had Certificates, from Monthly, Quarterly, or Meetings of Mi|ni&s;ters to which we belonged, and from Friends in the &s;everal Provinces and I&s;lands where we travelled, if we de&s;ired them, many of which I could &s;hew the Judge if Time would admit; but &s;he &s;aid, le&s;t we &s;hould be called away in ha&s;te, &s;he craved to &s;ee &s;ome of tho&s;e Certifi|cates: I &s;hewed her them, beginning at the fir&s;t, wherein Friends of <HI>Kelk,</HI> now <HI>Bridlington</HI> Monthly-meeting in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> to Friends in <HI>America,</HI> &s;hewed not only their full Unity with this my pre&s;ent Journey, but al&s;o with my Service for the Truth, and Conver&s;ation to the &s;ame, where I had lived and travelled; and that I had &s;ettled my outward Affairs to Friends Satisfaction, under many Hands vari|ou&s;ly writ.</P>
<P>When this great and wi&s;e Woman &s;aw this, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>it was enough;</HI> but I &s;hewed her other Certificates from divers Places, wherein Friends had &s;ignified &s;ufficiently their Unity and Satis|faction with me. I likewi&s;e informed her, that in ca&s;e any Man, not approved by us as a Mi|ni&s;ter, did take upon him to impo&s;e his Preach|ing upon any who were Strangers to him, &s;uch as knew him took care to acquaint the Churches therewith, if his Intentions could be known, that no Impo&s;tor might do any hurt: All which &s;he admired, and &s;aid <HI>&s;he had never heard &s;o much before, neither did &s;he think there
<PB N="169" REF="018158_0174_0FA561BB06BA4A40">had been &s;uch excellent Orders in the World among&s;t any People.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus acquainted her with our Order and Di&s;cipline, and afterwards informed her of the Cau&s;e of our unexpected Return, I renewed my Propo&s;al of having my Accu&s;er before the Judge; &s;he told me, &s;he had good place with her Hu&s;band, and would endeavour to obtain it: And accordingly, after talking with him, &s;he let me know, that the Judge expre&s;&s;ed his Readine&s;s to do me any Service which lay in his Power, and was of Opinion, my Accu&s;er dur&s;t not face either him or me in that Affair; but that if the Wind continued again&s;t us, he would try to find him out and bring him, which might be of Service; but if the Wind favoured, &s;he thought I might be ea&s;y to go; as indeed I was, and the more &s;o, con&s;idering that our Captain <HI>Salter,</HI> who lived near the Judge on the &s;ame I&s;land, had &s;hewed a great deal of Patience and good Di&s;po&s;ition to us-ward for about two Weeks, yet would gladly be gone; &s;o about Mid-night we were called to go on board the Ship, for the Wind was fair, if we were ready; I replied, <HI>we come quickly,</HI> and &s;o we did, and took leave of all we &s;aw of the Family, and remembered our dear Love, with grateful Acknowledgments to the Judge, for all his Civility and Kindne&s;&s;es he had done to us, with Rea&s;ons why we could not &s;ee him, for he had been afflicted for &s;ome time with the Gout, and was now fallen into &s;ome Re&s;t, and we going very early away, were not at our own Di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="018158_0175_0FA561BBB42B7800">
I admired the Lord's good Providence in all this, and there was &s;omething of a Reach from the &s;ame watchful Providence, to order that to be put into my Certificate which did &s;o fully remove that Slur this Enemy would have fa&s;t|ned upon me, <HI>(i. e.)</HI> that <HI>I broke in</HI> England, <HI>and could not pay my Debts,</HI> and therefore was come into the&s;e remote Parts of the World, where I was unknown, <HI>to preach for a Liveli|hood;</HI> but the contrary fully appeared, that I was known and well beloved too, and had Effects to di&s;charge any ju&s;t Demand upon me, ble&s;&s;ed be the worthy Name of the Lord now and for ever.</P>
<P>Now I may &s;ay &s;omething of our Affairs up|on the Sea in this Voyage: When Captain <HI>Salter</HI> had taken us in Pa&s;&s;engers at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> for <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> it being a time of War, and People &s;omewhat affraid of &s;hipping Goods, he &s;aid he was to have two hone&s;t <HI>Quakers</HI> Pa&s;&s;en|gers, and he did not fear being taken by Priva|teers nor Pirates. I was troubled at his Con|fidence in us, and told him &s;o, and that it was much if the Lord did not &s;uffer us to be taken, that he might &s;ee Men were not to be depended upon, but that we ought to depend upon the Lord alone for Protection and Deliverance: However, in much le&s;s time than was expected, Goods came, and we were loaded and gone. We had rough Weather before we came to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> (I have given an Account of <HI>Ber|mudas</HI>) e&s;pecially about the Tropick of <HI>Cancer</HI> we had very high Winds, and I was extreamly
<PB N="171" REF="018158_0176_0FA561BC8BA13FC8">Sea-&s;ick, and &s;o was my Companion, and I could eat little, but was treated with remarkable Civilities by the Captain; for in and about that Latitude there are Fi&s;h not unlike Herrings, which fly from Wave to Wave, and by dipping their Fins or Wings in the Water, they will fly a great Way, e&s;pecially when they are cha&s;ed by Fi&s;hes of Prey, and almo&s;t every Morning there were of tho&s;e Fi&s;hes found on the Ship's Deck; and the Captain oft &s;aid, as his manner was, Mr. <HI>Richard&s;on,</HI> the&s;e are &s;ent for you, or for your Breakfa&s;t, and &s;eeing it is &s;o, I will dre&s;s them my&s;elf, for I know, &s;aid he, my Cook is &s;o grea&s;y you can hardly eat of his Cookery, which was very true; and therefore he would wa&s;h his Hands, and lay a clean Napkin on his Arm, and tell me he would dre&s;s me my Breakfa&s;t on the be&s;t Fa&s;hion he could. I a&s;ked him, <HI>why he would put him&s;elf to &s;o much Trouble?</HI> He &s;aid, he never waited on a Man in all his Life with &s;o much Plea&s;ure, and if I were going into any Country where he was going, I &s;hould not pay any thing for my Pa&s;&s;age; &s;o much Re&s;pect he &s;hewed to me.</P>
<P>Now it happened in the Cour&s;e of this Voyage, when we were within a few Leagues of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> one Morning early as &s;oon as Day appeared, he that was aloft (upon the Watch to look out, as the manner of Mariners is, e&s;peci|ally in the Times of Wars and Danger) e&s;pied a Ship which he and the re&s;t of our mo&s;t
<PB N="172" REF="018158_0177_0FA561BD2689A190">knowing Men &s;uppo&s;ed to be a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Frigate, of con&s;iderable Strength; however, it was a great Ve&s;&s;el, and appeared to have a great many Guns: When we fir&s;t &s;aw her, &s;he ap|peared to be within Gun-&s;hot. But Oh what a Surprize and Fright our Ship's Crew were in! I had not often &s;een the like. Our Ve&s;&s;el being deep loaded, although a good Sailer, was le&s;s than that which cha&s;ed us, and to run for it appeared the only way for us to e&s;cape, hauling as clo&s;e to the Wind as we could to keep the Sails full; and the Ve&s;&s;el being &s;tiff with its great Burthen, endured Sail well, and indeed they crowded &s;o much Sail, that I told them I feared they would bring the Rigging by the board; &s;o thus we laboured until Noon, and then our Captain had lo&s;t all his Confidence in the <HI>Quakers,</HI> and &s;aid we &s;hall be taken, for the Ship has gained upon us for &s;everal Hours, and we have done what we can, and are all &s;pent: I walked upon the Main-deck under no &s;mall Concern of Mind, and Truth ro&s;e, and I found it open in the Truth, <HI>that we &s;hould not be taken:</HI> The Captain &s;aid, binding it with &s;ome A&s;&s;everations, we &s;hall certainly be taken.

<PB N="173" REF="018158_0178_0FA561C00140E858">And indeed our Captain, altho' he was a &s;tout Man, yet appeared very gha&s;tly and dead-hearted, and &s;aid (in a Tone which be&s;poke both Affliction and Trouble) to me, Go into my Cabbin, or &s;ome where under the Deck, for they will fire immediately; and that where I walked I could hardly e&s;cape either the Shot or the Rigging falling upon me.

I &s;aid, <HI>I would fetch them a Bottle or two, or more of my be&s;t Brandy, and they &s;hould take as much as might do them good; but have a Care of more, and ply away a while, and you will &s;ee they will fall back, and we &s;hall leave them.</HI> The Captain &s;aid, although there was no human Probability of e&s;caping, yet for my Sake they would try, and to work they went. I think I never &s;aw Men on board of any Ship work like them for &s;ome Hours, and we &s;oon perceived we out&s;ailed them, and by the time it began to be dark we had left them con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>Now all Fire and Light was forbidden, ex|cept what could not be avoided, and all Noi&s;e, and a Council was held, to con&s;ult what Way to &s;teer, whether the neare&s;t or mo&s;t common way for the I&s;land, or about; for it was rea&s;on|able to conclude the Adver&s;ary would way-lay us, if he could, before we came to the I&s;land; and the Captain &s;aid, what I &s;aid in the Ca&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould be done: After &s;ome Deliberation I told
<PB N="174" REF="018158_0179_0FA561C11FF7EA08">him, <HI>I was mo&s;t ea&s;y in &s;teering the neare&s;t Cour&s;e,</HI> which we did, and &s;aw our Adver&s;ary no more.</P>
<P>We came to the I&s;land next Day in much Joy, that we had e&s;caped &s;o imminent a Danger, but I was very ill in a Fever when I landed, which had been growing upon me for &s;everal Days, (this being the Sixth-day of the Week, and 18th of the Tenth Month) I was &s;o poorly, that &s;everal thought I mu&s;t die; but I &s;tood re&s;igned in the Will of God, whether to die or live. The Fir&s;t-day being come, I went to the Meet|ing, though with great Difficulty, being very weak, where I &s;at under more than u&s;ual Exer|ci&s;e, Rea&s;onings, and Conflict of Spirit for &s;ome time, about my pre&s;ent Condition, which was weak and low, and in my own Apprehen&s;ion, unlikely to be of any Service, notwith&s;tand|ing all the Troubles and Hazards of the Sea and Robbers, and other Jeopardies in coming here, I was now thus di&s;abled and laid by as u&s;ele&s;s. The&s;e Things were an Occa&s;ion to me to con&s;ider, whether I had not mi&s;t my Way in &s;omething or other? Many particulars were brought to my Mind, whether I had di&s;charged my&s;eif faithfully where I had been? and when I looked back and took a View of my pa&s;t Travels and Services in the Work of the Mini|&s;try, and Di&s;cipline of the Church, my Con|duct and whole Conver&s;ation, I &s;aw nothing but I was clear of the Blood of all Men; as al&s;o clear and well &s;atisfied both as to the Time of my coming, as well as to the Coming it&s;elf
<PB N="175" REF="018158_0180_0FA561C1A9184380">unto this I&s;land. There appeared yet two Things in my way; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> if this Place &s;hould be my Grave, &s;uch as might not watch over me with the be&s;t Eye may &s;ay, <HI>If he had gone at the Lord's Command, no doubt but he would have brought him back again;</HI> and <HI>Secondly,</HI> as I had <HI>two little Children in</HI> England, <HI>if I fini&s;h|ed my Cour&s;e here, they would be left Fatherle&s;s and Motherle&s;s,</HI> And I &s;aid before the Lord, <HI>Let not my End bring Di&s;honour to thy great Name, nor any Blemi&s;h to the Truth which I have loved, and laboured for the Promotion of from my Childhood.</HI></P>
<P>When I had thus, or to this Purpo&s;e ap|pealed to the Lord, I felt great Quietne&s;s and Re&s;ignation of Mind; and as I thus &s;at, a Friend, well thought on by &s;everal, began to &s;peak in the Meeting, and it opened in my Mind, that he was not wholly redeemed from having &s;ome Thoughts, that <HI>elementary Water</HI> had not yet ended its Service; I mean in Point of <HI>Dipping:</HI> I would have &s;hut it out, for the Man appeared a wi&s;e, zealous Man; and I be|ing altogether a Stranger, could not remember I had heard of his Name, yet the Matter con|tinued, and I thought, for my own Satisfaction I might a&s;k him the Que&s;tion: If he was a right &s;pirited Friend, he would not be hurt; if he was not, he &s;tood in Need of Help, or at lea&s;t it was high time for Friends to have a more perfect Knowledge of him. So I leave this a while, and return to the other Part of the Meeting, which was very remarkable.</P>

<P>Returning with other Friends to my Quarters from this good Meeting (not to be forgotten by me) came the before-mentioned Friend to &s;ee me; and I having, as I told him, a De&s;ire to &s;peak privately with him, he replied, there were none there but his good Friends, and I might &s;peak my Mind. I told him, what I had to &s;ay related chiefly to him&s;elf, and in &s;uch a matter as he might not be willing to have it expo&s;ed; but he would not hear, and &s;aid, I might &s;peak it there.

<PB N="177" REF="018158_0182_0FA561C3EA3F8D40">and then I &s;aid, the matter is, When thou wa&s;t &s;peaking in the Meeting, it &s;ounded in the Ear of my Soul as if one had &s;aid, <HI>This Man</HI> (meaning thee) <HI>is not wholly redeemed out of a Belief in</HI> John's <HI>Mini&s;tration of Water, as not having done its Work.</HI> Now the Matter is before thee, thou knowe&s;t whether what I re|ceived be true or fal&s;e: In the fir&s;t place I enquire for my own Satisfaction.

I was invited on board a great tran&s;port Ship, whereof one <HI>Reed</HI> was Ma&s;ter, who remembered me when I was but young, and was travelling to or near <HI>Scarborough;</HI> he was loving to me, and &s;everal Friends who were with me, and I had good Service on board.

<P>I find as we live and walk in the Truth, there is an inward Witne&s;s which God hath placed in the Hearts of Men that is reachable, except in &s;uch who are arrived to a great Degree of Hardne&s;s and In&s;en&s;ibility, and &s;o have little Sen&s;e or Perceivance of Good, either in them|&s;elves or in others, which is a deplorable State and much to be lamented.

<PB N="180" REF="018158_0185_0FA561C7ED721820">Wickedne&s;s was as great a Trouble to them who acted it, as it was to me, I have thought they would &s;oon grow weary of it.</P>
<P>Now I left the I&s;land, and embarked on board a Ship, <HI>John Gri&s;&s;ith</HI> Ma&s;ter, bound for <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> in <HI>Old England,</HI> and went to Sea with &s;ome <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships that had put in at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> having a Ship of War or two for their Convoy.

<P>In our Pa&s;&s;age we had &s;ome rough Weather near the Tropick which I mentioned before, and the Men and Captain being much di&s;|ordered with watching and hard Labour, as I remember, for eight and forty Hours Night and Day, a Calm en&s;uing, the Captain de&s;ired me to take his Place for his Watch, and mind the Helm&s;man, and &s;ee that he made &s;traight Steerage; but alas! he was &s;o &s;leepy, it was next to impo&s;&s;ible to keep him awake. I walked on the Deck, and had overmuch Work to mind the Compa&s;s, and the Helm&s;man too, for a fine Breeze of Wind came on, and all of a &s;udden a very unu&s;ual Fear fell on me, and I looked into the Sea, and beheld it appeared to turn blue, and as far as I could di&s;cern to Windward, I &s;aw white Caps or the Water-freckle; on &s;eeing which, through Fear, more than any great Skill, I &s;tampt with my Foot as though I would have broke the Deck. Out
<PB N="181" REF="018158_0186_0FA561C96568F720">came the Captain, but what with Fear and Sleep he could &s;carce hit the Door out of the Cabbin; but when he was got upon the Deck, he &s;tampt, and called out all his Hands, and bid them lower and furl the Sails with Speed, or el&s;e we were all dead Men, for here is a Hurricane ju&s;t upon us: And no &s;ooner was all made &s;nug as well could be (as the Sea|men phra&s;e it) but the Wind blew &s;o, that we thought it would have turned the Bottom of the Ship upward: The like I never &s;aw; and, as the Captain &s;aid, we had not one Minute to &s;pare of being ca&s;t away, according to all human Probability; and, as the Seamen term it, it was &s;uch <HI>Hurry durry thick Weather,</HI> that we could &s;carce &s;ee any thing a hundred Yards, which violent Weather held for about an Hour, in which time we drove by a Ve&s;&s;el, and were &s;o near her, that I thought I could have flung a Stone aboard: Our Ship's Crew were &s;ore afraid, and looked upon her to be a Robber; her Rudder was la&s;hed or tied up, and the Men were all gone off the Deck, but our Mariners were &s;o affrighted, that they thought they would &s;et &s;ome &s;ail and follow us; for no &s;ooner were we pa&s;t this Ship but the Weather grew better, and away we ran in hazard of bringing the Ma&s;ts by the board, but through the divine Providence of him that is Lord over all, both Sea and Land, we e&s;caped and came &s;afe into <HI>Cork</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where the Ma&s;ter lived, and rode there for &s;ome time, and
<PB N="182" REF="018158_0187_0FA561CA5D30E298">then weighed for <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> intending for the Yearly-meeting there.</P>
<P>We had rough Weather in cro&s;&s;ing the Chan|nel, before we came into the <HI>Severn,</HI> where our Sailors, being afraid of being pre&s;t, launched the Boat, and ran away into <HI>Cornwall,</HI> leav|ing but four on board to bring the Ship up the River. We &s;aw a Pinnace, having in it a Lieutenant with a Crew of pre&s;&s;ed Men, to pre&s;s more if they could find them, and our Ma&s;ter called on me, and de&s;ired I would put on my be&s;t Cloaths and come to him, and &s;o I did, and he &s;at me on his right Hand: By this time up comes the Lieutenant and a&s;ked for my Men, taking me to be the Ma&s;ter; I told him, they had launched the Long-boat and were gone, and we could not hinder them, they be|ing the &s;tronge&s;t Party; at which he appeared very much enraged, and &s;eemed as though he would have &s;truck at me. I told him calmly, he had more need pity than be angry with us, for if there &s;hould be a Gale of Wind, we were in great Danger of all peri&s;hing for want of Hands, for I &s;hewed him what Force we had, viz. <HI>James Bates,</HI> whom I did not then call my Companion, nor <HI>John Gri&s;&s;ith</HI> Captain, the Cabbin Boy and my&s;elf were all the Men on board. But he a&s;ked, what for a Man that was who &s;at be&s;ide me? I told him, he was a Man &s;ufficiently &s;ecured again&s;t the Pre&s;s: Then the rough Man fell, and &s;aid, I looked like an hone&s;t Man, and he would take my Word and not &s;earch for Men: So I ordered a Bottle of
<PB N="183" REF="018158_0188_0FA561CAA923DC40">the be&s;t Liquor on board to be brought, and then the Lieutenant and I parted very friendly.</P>
<P>I write not this as a Thing I approved, but di&s;liked; but being taken at unawares, had not time to &s;hun it (as before mentioned) unle&s;s I had expo&s;ed my Friend the Ma&s;ter of the Ship; although I neither &s;aid nor did, that I know of, any thing wor&s;e than what thou &s;ee&s;t here written; I told the Captain I thought he was a great Coward, and had expo&s;ed me to Danger to &s;ave him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Wind and Weather favouring us, we came in due time to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Yearly-meeting, where I met with <HI>William Edmund&s;on,</HI> and was truly glad to &s;ee him with many more at that Place; but my Companion falling &s;ick, I was made willing to leave him, and travelled to <HI>London</HI> with <HI>John Wat&s;on</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and a &s;weet &s;pi|rited Man he was; we got to <HI>London</HI> Yearly-meeting, where I di&s;charged my&s;elf of what I had upon my Mind, and came away in Peace, and in the feeling of the Love of God.</P>
<P><HI>John Haydock</HI> and I came from <HI>London</HI> to|gether, and had Meetings in our way to <HI>York</HI> Yearly-meeting, where I was glad to &s;ee my Home-Friends, and to enjoy the Love of God once more with them; for this is our principal Crown and Kingdom in this World, to enjoy the favourable Countenance of the Lord, and one another in his living and internal Pre&s;ence; and when I looked back upon all the Mercies and Deliverances I had received from the Mighty God of Heaven and Earth,
<PB N="184" REF="018158_0189_0FA561CB6E97EEC8">Seas, and Rivers of Water, who&s;e Hand made all, and who&s;e Eye and watchful Providence attends all, and is over all, my Soul was filled with Thanks and Prai&s;es to the great and mo&s;t excellent Name of him who lives for ever, and hath helped my Soul to overcome many &s;trong Temptations, and hath borne up my Head under many deep Afflictions and Tribulations, renowned for ever be his holy Name.</P>
<P>I came home the 18th of the Fourth Month 1703, and found my Children well; and now I was under a Thoughtfulne&s;s how to walk and demean my&s;elf &s;o, as that I might be pre&s;erved near the Lord, and in due Reverence and true Fear before him; that ina&s;much as I found there was &s;omething of Holine&s;s unto the Lord imprinted or ingraven upon the fle&s;hly Table of my Heart, that now in this Time, when I was not &s;o particularly and immediately concerned in the like daily Travel on Truth's Account, I might not lo&s;e the Savour, Reli&s;h and Sen&s;ation of heavenly Things. Some will read me here, in this &s;hort Survey I have been taking of my pre&s;ent State and Thoughtfulne&s;s, that if I could not make it better, I might not make it wor&s;e, either in doing, or not doing any thing that might prove a hurt to me; for a Ve&s;&s;el had better be laid by, if it can be &s;pared, than u&s;ed to its hurt. Now in this careful and watchful Frame of Mind, I have found Pre&s;ervation from time to time to this Day, by retaining the Salt of the Kingdom in the Soul of the inward Man, which is of a pre&s;erving Quality, with

<P>Whil&s;t I remained at Home, as my u&s;ual Manner was, I attended Fir&s;t-day, and Week-day, and Monthly-meetings, as al&s;o Quarterly and other Meetings for the Service of Truth, and vi&s;ited many Meetings up and down in the Country, and had good Service and much Satis|faction in being given up to the Service of Truth; but did not &s;ee it convenient (as my Children were well placed) to &s;ettle to keep a Family, until my Way appeared clear to marry, which did now draw on, and after I had been near &s;even Years a Widower I married <HI>Anne Robin&s;on,</HI> who de&s;cended of a &s;ub&s;tantial Family at <HI>Hutton</HI> in the <HI>Hole,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Le&s;ling|ham,</HI> not far from <HI>Kirby-moor&s;ide</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire.</HI></P>

<P>We journeyed from <HI>Dublin</HI> towards <HI>Cork,</HI> and had &s;everal Meetings in our Way, as at <HI>Balli|cane, Culladine, Wexford, Lamb&s;town, Water|ford, Clonmel, Ca&s;hel, Youghall, Cork,</HI> and &s;taid their Province Meeting for <HI>Mun&s;ler,</HI> which was a good and large Meeting.

<P>Some Things which have been omitted, I think proper to in&s;ert here, as worthy of Ob&s;er|vation. As I was travelling towards <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Brig,</HI> Friends gave me No|tice that there were two great Di&s;putants, a <HI>Non|conformi&s;t</HI> Mini&s;ter, and a Doctor of <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI> who were like to go all or mo&s;t of the Way with me, as the A&s;&s;izes were coming on, and would be at me with Arguments about Religion, which I &s;oon found true; for we were no &s;ooner got into a &s;uitable Way but they began with me, which I endeavoured to prevent by telling them, I did not look upon my&s;elf to be
<PB N="211" REF="018158_0216_0FA560E5F9688C68">qualified for <HI>Di&s;putes;</HI> and withal I ob&s;erved, that &s;ometimes Di&s;putants ended in a wor&s;e Under&s;tanding one of another than when they began, except they minded well to keep good Government; and now as we appeared free and friendly, how we might be when we had ended our Di&s;pute, was a Que&s;tion, therefore I had rather they would forbear: But they turned the deaf Ear to all that I &s;aid, and nothing would do with them, but a Di&s;pute we mu&s;t have. I then a&s;ked them what they would &s;ay? They queried, <HI>Whether all Men were placed in a Station capable of Salvation, yea or nay?</HI> I replied, If I &s;hould give my po&s;itive Thoughts to your Que&s;tion, we &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to go back to treat of the Nature, not only of the upright State Man was in before he fell, but al&s;o how he fell and al&s;o in the Fall, how he &s;tands as in Relation to his Re&s;toration, which brings us to the Que&s;tion. Although this be not the u&s;ual Way of Di&s;putants, yet if you will &s;ubmit to it, it will either an&s;wer your Que&s;tion, or &s;et it in a clearer Light for an An&s;wer. They a&s;ked, <HI>How could that be?</HI> I replied, if it did not, they might &s;ay &s;o. They then &s;o far conde&s;cended as to hear me, and I &s;aid, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> we all agree in this, that Man was made upright; <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that he fell from that Uprightne&s;s; the Que&s;tion then is, <HI>How? An&s;w.</HI> By the Offence or Di&s;o|bedience of the fir&s;t Man <HI>Adam</HI> Sin entered, and Condemnation came upon all who had &s;inned. I then queried of the Di&s;putants, whether they believed that <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall did affect all tho&s;e
<PB N="212" REF="018158_0217_0FA560E6C6AE28C8">who did not hear of it, as well as tho&s;e who did? For, I &s;aid, there were &s;ome of Opi|nion, that tho&s;e who had not the explicit or outward Knowledge of the promi&s;ed Seed or Coming of Chri&s;t, had not the Benefit of his Coming; and except they would fir&s;t allow, that all were affected or hurt by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, then &s;uch as were not, remained in Paradi&s;e to this Day, except they would make the Remedy le&s;s than the Di&s;ea&s;e, the Plai&s;ter le&s;s than the Sore, and Chri&s;t's Coming le&s;s exten&s;ive than <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall. I argued, that upon the foot of Rea&s;on, as well as what we had in plain Scrip|ture, Chri&s;t's Coming was as exten&s;ive as the Fall of <HI>Adam;</HI> for, <HI>by the Obedience of Chri&s;t, the Gift of God came upon all unto Ju&s;tification.</HI></P>
<P>Now I think, &s;aid I, your Que&s;tion is &s;et in a clear Light for an An&s;wer, or el&s;e an&s;wered; &s;o take it at what End you will (laying a&s;ide all Quibbling) I intend to join I&s;&s;ue with you, and prove that <HI>all Men are placed in a Station capable of Salvation;</HI> or otherwi&s;e you mu&s;t leave a great Part of the World in Para|di&s;e, or make the Coming of Chri&s;t le&s;s exten|&s;ive than the Fall of <HI>Adam.</HI> I then queried, what they &s;aid to all this? They an&s;wered, <HI>they never heard the like before, and they would not meddle with me, I was too great a Scholar for them.</HI> I &s;aid, there was little of Scholar&s;hip in it; I offer|ed, I thought, nothing but plain Scripture and &s;ound Rea&s;on; and I told them, I had now as good as an&s;wered their Que&s;tion, and had given &s;everal Rea&s;ons to back my An&s;wer, and as they
<PB N="213" REF="018158_0218_0FA560E76E3A32B0">appeared wi&s;e, well read Men, and as far as I had gathered, had been principled again&s;t <HI>uni|ver&s;al Salvation,</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al Grace,</HI> for them now to drop the Matter &s;o &s;lenderly, before me who appeared but like a Child to them, was very &s;urprizing: But they replied, <HI>they would not meddle with me.</HI></P>
<P>I then commended them for their good Temper, and the Civility they &s;hewed to me, for they were civil to me beyond what I could expect; and they invited me to the Burial of one of their decea&s;ed Friends, but I could not go, for I was in ha&s;te to get to <HI>Lincoln,</HI> having &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s there that ha&s;tened me. Now at parting with them, my Soul magnified the Lord, under a Sen&s;e of his Goodne&s;s to me, in that he had opened my Way, and helped me through this Difficulty, with many other Trials and Afflictions I had met with.</P>
<P>I had at another Time &s;ome Rea&s;onings with a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> who was my Neighbour, about the <HI>Vi&s;ibility</HI> of their Church, and <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tan|tiation,</HI> with &s;everal other Things.

And as to the other, they took too much upon them, more than they could ju&s;tify from Scripture, or clearly demon&s;trate from Chri&s;t or his Apo&s;tles; for Chri&s;t never
<PB N="214" REF="018158_0219_0FA560E85914FD70">gave any of them &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion, as to <HI>convert Bread and Wine</HI> into <HI>real Fle&s;h and Blood,</HI> and then to call it <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> You, &s;aid I, by the&s;e Notions, deceive your&s;elves and your Adherents; for Chri&s;t &s;poke unto &s;uch as you by Parables, becau&s;e they were carnal, and did not under&s;tand the Meaning of his Sayings in this Ca&s;e, no more than the <HI>Jews</HI> under&s;tood what Chri&s;t meant, when he &s;poke of de&s;troy|ing <HI>this Temple</HI> (meaning his Body) which they under&s;tood was of that Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> which they made a great Wonder at, and &s;aid, <HI>How can this be that he can de&s;troy this Temple, and rai&s;e it up again in three Days, when it was Forty eight Years in building?</HI> Thus they rea&s;oned carnally, as <HI>Nicodemus</HI> (though a Ruler of the <HI>Jews</HI>) did concerning <HI>Regeneration</HI> or the <HI>new Birth;</HI> and as the Woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> did, from whence Chri&s;t &s;hould have that living Water, which he &s;poke of, that <HI>&s;hould be in Man as a Well of living Water, &s;pringing up unto everla&s;t|ing Life;</HI> and as the <HI>Jews</HI> did, when Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Except ye eat the Fle&s;h of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you;</HI> they &s;aid, <HI>How can this be, that he can give us his Fle&s;h to eat, and his Blood to drink?</HI> But this is a &s;piritual Eating and Drinking; even as Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Out of the Belly of him that believes, &s;hall flow Rivers of living Waters; which he &s;pake of the Spirit:</HI> In like manner it is &s;aid in the <HI>Revelation, Behold I &s;tand at the Door and knock, i&s; any Man hear my Voice, and open unto me, I

<P>On the 27th of the &s;aid Month we &s;et &s;ail, and had a good Pa&s;&s;age in the main, excepting that we had one very great Storm, in which we were in Danger of being lo&s;t; our Bolt-&s;prit was broke, and the Ma&s;ts were in Danger of coming down, yet we were pre&s;erved, and in about eleven Weeks, being the 12th of the Seventh Month, I landed near <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to the great Satisfaction of Friends as well as my &s;elf, renowned be the great Name of the Lord for ever.</P>
<P>I have many Times con&s;idered, that although it was my Place to leave my very near and dear Friends, Children and Relations, who in a ten|der Frame of Spirit were much concerned for me, and I for them, yet I met with many ten|der-hearted Friends in my Travels, who were very near me in the ever ble&s;&s;ed Truth; which fails not tho&s;e who tru&s;t in the Lord, and are faithful, according to the Ability and Under|&s;tanding which the Lord, hath given to the Children of Men, and are devoted to an&s;wer the Leadings and Guidance of his Holy Spirit, and willing to bear the Cro&s;s, Burthen, or Yoke, which he &s;ees good to lay upon his Servants and Handmaids: And I intreat all &s;uch who are called unto the Lord's great Work, to give up cheerfully and not grudgingly, and not to look back at what is behind, &s;o as to ha&s;ten or hinder them&s;elves in that Work they are called to, le&s;t they fall &s;hort of that <HI>Penny,</HI> or <HI>Crown,</HI> which

<P>The Yearly-meeting at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> was nigh when we landed, which was large, and a good Meeting, many Friends from &s;everal Parts being at it.

<P>By this we may &s;ee, that Truth &s;ometimes comes over Men, and the Witne&s;s which God hath placed in Men is reached, and Truth pre|vails many Times beyond our Expectation, or what is by us fore&s;een; therefore it is good to keep to the Guidance or Leading of the Spirit of Truth, for it is a ble&s;&s;ed Remembrancer, In|&s;tructor and true Comforter to all &s;uch as truly depend upon him, who &s;ent the Spirit of Truth

He allowed it <HI>to be better to let them alone.</HI></P>
<P>We parted very friendly, and Friends were glad of the Opportunity, he having the Cha|racter of being a great Scholar and a wi&s;e Man; but from all that pa&s;&s;ed, they believed he gained no Advantage: However he behaved well; and before we parted, I told him, I thought the greate&s;t Rea&s;on why &s;ome think us refined was this, That formerly People were &s;o prejudiced, that whatever was printed or &s;aid again&s;t us, our Principles, Practice and Doctrines, was ge|nerally received and believed, though never &s;o much di&s;gui&s;ed or covered with &s;uch Dre&s;&s;es as might render us mo&s;t odious, and were by many taken for the Standard of our Belief and Prac|tice; but of late the Light hath more appeared, and many are grown better di&s;po&s;ed towards us, and like wi&s;e Men, not willing to be impo&s;ed upon any longer, have &s;earched for them&s;elves into the State of the Controver&s;y between us and our Oppo&s;ers; and our Writings upon peru&s;al, appearing &s;o clear and different from what the Books of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed us charged upon
<PB N="231" REF="018158_0236_0FA560F7F64FAFC0">us, cau&s;ed many who read them with a good De&s;ign, and were willing to be &s;et right, to &s;ay <HI>we were reformed, and not the People that we had been.</HI> The Prie&s;t &s;aid, <HI>he thought there might be much owing to that:</HI> I told him it was undeniable, that there mu&s;t be a great Dif|ference between our Principles, Doctrines and Conver&s;ations, truly &s;tated and &s;et forth in their proper Light, and when they were mi&s;repre|&s;ented, &s;ometimes with all the Art and im|placable Malice that Men were capable of: And this has been the Way our Adver&s;aries have treated us, almo&s;t in every thing we have believed, &s;aid or writ, although it was very agreeable to the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>We returned back by <HI>Salem, Lynn</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and vi&s;ited Friends in our Way, and at <HI>Rhode-I&s;land, Long-I&s;land</HI> and <HI>New-York;</HI> and we had many good Meetings and &s;ome large in the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> where I had &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with a Ju&s;tice of the Peace about <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m,</HI> but he did not hold it long before he gave up; and I had another at <HI>Allens</HI> Town with a <HI>Presby|terian,</HI> which held for &s;ome Hours, about <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m,</HI> and concerning <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation,</HI> and he al&s;o &s;oon gave up as to the fir&s;t; but when he began about <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation,</HI> I &s;aid, I thought it was the mo&s;t pernicious Doctrine that ever was broached in the World, it did &s;o oppo&s;e the very Nature of God, and his De&s;ign of creating of Man, which, with all his other Works, he pro|nounced
<PB N="232" REF="018158_0237_0FA560F8D41C50C0">good and ble&s;&s;ed; and that Man, as the Crown and Glory of all his Works which he had created, &s;hould be de&s;igned for the mo&s;t mi&s;erable End, was unaccountable; I urged many Scriptures again&s;t that Doctrine, as al&s;o the Confu&s;ion they were in about it, as that of their <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, wherein they &s;ay, <HI>That the Decree is &s;o certain and de|finite, that one cannot be added to the Number of the Elect, or dimini&s;hed from the Number of the Reprobate;</HI> and yet you tell us, <HI>that God hath ordained the Means to effect his Ends:</HI> I then &s;aid, this Suppo&s;ition of a Decree for the Means, as well as the End, &s;eems intended to make the Prie&s;ts and their Service nece&s;&s;ary; but yet if they cannot alter the Decree, what Benefit or Advantage can there be to Men by their Services or Performance? I hope none will think that a Service to Mankind, to &s;trengthen or confirm that Decree if it were in their Power to do it, which I am &s;atisfied it is not; becau&s;e no &s;uch Decree was made or is in being; the oppo&s;ite appearing by plain Scrip|ture (which he owned when I urged it) <HI>to wit,</HI> that the <HI>Fall</HI> of <HI>Adam</HI> did affect all; and upon the Parity of Rea&s;on, the <HI>Coming</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did reach as far; becau&s;e, <HI>as in</HI> Adam <HI>all die, &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive;</HI> he ta&s;ted Death <HI>for every Man,</HI> was a <HI>Propitiation for the Sins of all;</HI> and where then wilt thou find a People that is not included?

He came next Day &s;everal Miles to a Meeting which I had appointed; the Man was counted a wi&s;e and &s;ober Man, and was under &s;ome Convincement, and behaved well.</P>
<P>From thence we went to <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and had many good Meetings in that Part, and be|ing clear and willing to return, I took leave of Friends in a loving and tender Frame of Spirit, and embarked on board a Ship, whereof <HI>Samuel Flower</HI> was Ma&s;ter, the 1&s;t of the Third Month 1733 at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> the 18th of the Fourth Month follow|ing, and was glad we got &s;afe to <HI>England,</HI> having been &s;even Weeks in our Pa&s;&s;age; I got Home on the 6th of the Sixth Month, and was truly thankful to the Lord, who had pre&s;erved me in the&s;e long Travels and Labours of Love, through many Difficulties; but the Lord's Power is &s;ufficient to bear up and carry through all, Renowned be his worthy Name over all, now and for ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>A remarkable DELIVERANCE which happened to me, being omitted in its proper Place, I think fit to in&s;ert here, which was as follows:</P>
<P>In the Year 1718 and the Twelfth Month, when <HI>John Dodg&s;on</HI> was vi&s;iting Friends in our Parts, he lodged with me, and I went with
<PB N="234" REF="018158_0239_0FA560FAF01D1F98">him and his Brother in Law <HI>Peter Buck,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their Guide to <HI>Whitby,</HI> and &s;taid their Fir&s;t day's Meeting, and Second-day's Preparative Meeting; and on the Third-day I went on with Friends towards <HI>Scarborough,</HI> to have the better Road Home, there having fallen a great deal of Snow while we were at <HI>Whitby,</HI> &s;o that it was looked upon impracticable for me to return the &s;ame Way home that I came, it being a moori&s;h, bad Way: But in our Way back, within a Mile or little more from <HI>Scar|borough,</HI> we came to a Brook, which by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Rain and Snow was higher than ever I had &s;een it, &s;o that when we came to ride thro' it, <HI>Henry Levins,</HI> our Guide, fir&s;t adven|tured in, being mounted upon a very &s;trong large Hor&s;e, and got over with &s;ome Difficulty, and I followed him; but when I came about the middle of the fording Place, it took my Mare off her Feet, and &s;omething being in the way, it turned her upon her Broad&s;ide, &s;o that I was di&s;mounted and carried away by the Rapidity of the Stream; but there being a Foot-bridge a little below, about Knee deep under Water, and no Rail either to be a Guide, or to lay a Hand on, and the Water being reduced to a narrow Compa&s;s, hurried me vio|lently along, and drove me with my Brea&s;t again&s;t the Bridge with &s;uch Force, that it very near knocked the Breath out of me; but before I touched the Bridge I happened to hold up my Hand, and <HI>John Dodg&s;on</HI> &s;eeing the Danger I was in, jumped off his Hor&s;e, and ran at a
<PB N="235" REF="018158_0240_0FA560FBB0EBDD60">venture (&s;eeing the Water ripple) to hit the Bridge, and ju&s;t caught hold of my Fingers, and held my Head above Water, until <HI>Henry Levins,</HI> who was got over, came to his A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.</P>
<P>But by the Strength of the Water in my Boot-tops, they being large, and by a Nail (in the Timber under the Bridge) catching hold of my great Coat, which held me fa&s;t, it was impo&s;&s;ible for one Man to free me, and not without &s;ome Difficulty for them both to get me out, the Nail holding &s;o fa&s;t that it tore out a great Piece of my Coat, Lining and all; but upon <HI>Henry</HI>'s di&s;mounting, his Hor&s;e ran away to <HI>Scarborough,</HI> (and mine &s;wam back to the Company) and when they had got me out, <HI>Henry</HI> ran on foot to get his Hor&s;e, and found him at the Stable Door where he u&s;ed to &s;tand, and in the mean Time <HI>John Dodg&s;on</HI> kept me in Motion by dragging me along, having very little or &s;ometimes no Hopes of my Recovery. When the Hor&s;e returned, they got me back to <HI>Scarborough,</HI> but I was not &s;en&s;ible how, and they had me to <HI>Dorothy Jaques</HI>'s Hou&s;e, and when there, they could perceive my Lips move, but could not hear what I &s;aid, until one laid an Ear clo&s;e to my Mouth, and &s;o under&s;tood that I &s;aid, <HI>If they gave me any Thing that was &s;trong, it would carry me off;</HI> which made them very cautious: However, they &s;tript me and changed my Shirt, and put me into a warmed Bed, and applied warm Flannel to my
<PB N="236" REF="018158_0241_0FA560FC7616C570">Feet for three Hours together, which I knew nothing of, being then altogether &s;en&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;aac Skelton,</HI> who had been a Companion of mine, in the Service of the Truth, through &s;everal Counties, hearing of this Accident, came immediately and got into Bed to me, and kept me clo&s;e in his Bo&s;om, which many thought was a great Means to pre&s;erve my Life. <HI>John Dodg&s;on,</HI> though he intended for the Monthly-meeting, expre&s;&s;ed &s;o great a Concern for me, that he &s;aid, <HI>He would either &s;ee me in a Way of Recovery, or die, before he left me;</HI> yet it plea&s;ed the Lord, of his infinite Mercy &s;o wonderfully to rai&s;e me up again, as to enable me to be at the Meeting next Day, and al&s;o to bear &s;ome Te&s;timony, which was very acceptable and comfortable to Friends, as it was al&s;o to &s;ee me there beyond their Expectation; but yet I was much troubled with Pain, the fle&s;hy Part of my Shoulder being rent by the violent hauling me out of the Water.</P>
<P>In Gratitude, my Soul can do no le&s;s than prai&s;e and magnify the Lord for this great Deliverance, and all his other Mercies, who alone is worthy. And I cannot but take Notice of Friends Kindne&s;s and Goodwill to me, in doing what&s;oever they could for me, but more e&s;pecially my worthy Friend <HI>John Dodg&s;on,</HI> who hazarded his Life to &s;ave mine.</P>
