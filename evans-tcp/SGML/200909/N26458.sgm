<HEAD>MASONIC ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>RIGHT WORSHIPFUL MASTER, WARDENS, AND BRETHREN, OF ESSEX LODGE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PERMIT me to &s;alute you upon our, joyful anniver&s;ary. Since our la&s;t com|memoration, Ma&s;onry has been placed before the world in unu&s;ual, but impor|tant, attitudes. In an age of revolutions, when jealou&s;y has all its power, and can violate what creates its fears, we could not expect that any a&s;&s;ociation, much le&s;s a &s;ecret one, &s;hould be heard of without anxious apprehen&s;ions. Jealou&s;y, led by faction, will cut the knot it cannot untie. When it is the guardian of the public rights, it will claim to hold what may fall into the hands of a public enemy. It
<PB N="6" REF="035180_0005_100105F901FC9350">always may be prompted by envy, which always hates &s;ucce&s;s. And thus the be&s;t in&s;titutions have been &s;acrificed, in all ages, to the jealou&s;y and the folly of mankind.</P>
<P>MASONRY could not be forgotten. Al|lied to the whole &s;ocial character, it would be &s;een by every eye, which inquired for man. It would appear in every attitude in which man could be placed, ready to give him the coun&s;els of its wi&s;dom. It is not then to be wondered, that it has been the &s;ubject of angry contention, and of vile mi&s;repre&s;entation. Beauty, while it tran&s;|ports innocence into love, fills the envious with mi&s;ery and death.</P>
<P>BUT this has been remarkable in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Ma&s;onry in this country. At the time, in which it would willingly have di&s;appeared from the jealous eyes of the world, every cau&s;e has contributed to
<PB N="7" REF="035180_0006_1001282E42799F08">force it upon the public notice. Succe&s;s gave an anxious &s;olicitude to po&s;&s;e&s;s its &s;ecrets. They who have not hated it from prejudice, have therefore become friends from their curio&s;ity. Its rapid pro|gre&s;s has therefore rather a&s;ked a check from its friends, than given any ju&s;t fears from its pretended enemies. The &s;u&s;picions are, of them&s;elves, a powerful cau&s;e of the pro&s;perity. In vain then do they impute to the wor&s;t cau&s;es, what is the &s;imple and natural effect of their own apprehen&s;ions. The Brethren are tempted to view them|&s;elves in a new light, from their great ac|qui&s;ition of &s;trength. They are tempted to defy tho&s;e, whom it will always be dangerous to de&s;pi&s;e. In &s;uch a novel &s;ituation, Ma&s;ons have conde&s;cended to vindicate them&s;elves before the public, a tribunal at which they ought never to have been challenged. They have plead their innocence, and even promi&s;ed to obey the laws. Their duty, and their love,
<PB N="8" REF="035180_0007_1001282FD0EC2740">has now become their public oath. By the&s;e mea&s;ures, they make flow advances to the public favour. The world want not our promi&s;e; they wi&s;h to hold us in their power. They know not the means we po&s;&s;e&s;s to attain the wor&s;t ends, or the be&s;t. It is then upon our public character we mu&s;t at la&s;t depend; and upon this, in &s;ome circum&s;tances, the world would depend, with greater confidence, if we &s;hould &s;ay nothing in our own vindication.</P>
<P>BUT what is wi&s;e and &s;afe in &s;ome, is not in all circum&s;tances. To expre&s;s a gra|titude to our admini&s;tration, in common with our fellow citizens, was our right; and the form, in which we could mo&s;t innocently expre&s;s our allegiance to the government, was in the public addre&s;&s;es, which public favour had patroni&s;ed. The replies we have received are before the public; and how much they have contri|buted to the reputation of the Craft, mu&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="035180_0008_100105FECFF897B0">be determined by tho&s;e who read them. The addre&s;s to General WASHINGTON, as a Brother, mu&s;t have the be&s;t effect, be|cau&s;e he gives us his own te&s;timony, that he is a &s;tranger to any ill de&s;igns of our in&s;titution. But the replies of Pre&s;ident ADAMS, &s;uch as he was indeed obliged to offer, have only left us where he found us, if in &s;o happy condition. His an&s;wers are candid, but he could know nothing. His an&s;wer to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Grand Lodge in&s;i|nuates his hopes. To Maryland, he &s;eems to expre&s;s even his fears. To Vermont, he &s;ays, he believes the in&s;titution has been u&s;eful. But while he expre&s;&s;es a con|fidence in the American Lodges, he con|&s;ents to hold our Lodges capable of cor|ruption. His words are, Ma&s;ons "will be&s;t know whether any dangers are po&s;&s;ible in other countries, as well as this." The pre&s;ent &s;tate of France has afforded the plea for the&s;e in&s;inuations, e&s;pecially at a time, when that nation is held up to the
<PB N="10" REF="035180_0009_1001061163F17638">world in the darke&s;t colours. We have no concern with the true national charac|ter; but there is a very important di&s;tinc|tion to be made, in our favour, between the &s;tate of France before the revolution, and after that event. We expre&s;s the greate&s;t affection to our own government unequivocally, now we are its lawful &s;ub|jects: as Ma&s;ons and citizens we ought to do it, and we mu&s;t do it. Why then &s;hould not the French do the &s;ame to their own? If there were any errour, it mu&s;t be in com|mencing the revolution in the Lodges; and that was never proved upon the Lod|ges in France, more than upon the Lodges in America, and never will be proved. They will never take the prai&s;e, or the blame. It is from the neglect of this di&s;|tinction, that our common cau&s;e is &s;uffer|ing. This is the proof we ought to de|mand. It is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to deny the la&s;t fact, but to the highe&s;t ho|nour of Ma&s;onry to learn that the Ma&s;ons
<PB N="11" REF="035180_0010_100106036381A920">in France had early the &s;pirit of their own government, whatever it might be. It would be a &s;ad complaint from the people, as well as from the king, that they were oppo&s;ed by the Lodges. It is evident they were not enemies to the king, or to the people.</P>
<P>THIS truth makes a well informed Bro|ther to view with concern, that &s;o many are thoughtle&s;s of the de&s;ign of our ene|mies. If they can only per&s;uade the people of our guilt in any place, their great point is gained. It is a common cau&s;e, and it mu&s;t &s;uffer. It is for this rea&s;on that a late Scotch profe&s;&s;or has thrown out his charges in an artful confu&s;ion, &s;o as to prove nothing, and yet imply every thing; to engage the public &s;u&s;picions, and yet not to &s;uffer every man to &s;ee that his de|&s;ign was ungenerous, and political, and his work de&s;titute of truth. If, in any country, Ma&s;ons are detected, their com|mon
<PB N="12" REF="035180_0011_100128315770D2F0">cau&s;e is de&s;perate. And it is to this pre&s;umption the Pre&s;ident, in all his an|&s;wers, ju&s;tly directs our attention. A reply then to the Scotchman, is our &s;alvation. It was &s;o perceived in the Engli&s;h Lodges, as their numerous printed vindications will di&s;cover. And the exceptions made in favour of England and America, are only &s;o many &s;ubterfuges to make us in&s;en&s;ible of our common danger; to &s;ub|&s;tantiate a general charge in the public mind, and then to &s;tab the vitals of our in&s;titution; when we, by a carele&s;s con|&s;ent with the Scotch profe&s;&s;or, had already &s;igned our own death warrant.</P>
<P>OF another artifice, the Brethren have not been &s;ufficiently aware. The &s;imple Lodges, who are the &s;oul of Ma&s;onry, are to be involved in all the con&s;equences of the higher orders, when the&s;e are not un|der the juri&s;diction of the &s;imple Lodges, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly originate in them, or
<PB N="13" REF="035180_0012_1001060B1F0B9220">be known by them. Legi&s;lators are &s;uch, only when together. We &s;hould confine our defence to the &s;imple Lodges. The example which has given the public alarm is directly to our purpo&s;e. Where begins the errour in the French Lodges? It was imported from the interiour parts of Ger|many, from a German Lodge. What was that German Lodge? No Lodge at all. For when the founder of it was que&s;tioned, he has proved, &s;ays even his enemy, de|mon&s;tratively, that he was not a Ma&s;on when what is called his Lodge was in&s;ti|tuted. It was no more a Ma&s;on's Lodge, than our Marine Society, or the <HI>Phi Beta Kappa</HI> of the lads of Cambridge. The founder &s;ays, "I knew nothing of Ma&s;on|ry, till years afterwards." We &s;hould take the preci&s;e object, and make our defence upon the real in&s;titution, and its eternal principles.</P>
<P>PERMIT me then briefly to point out to you the important end of our in&s;titution,
<PB N="14" REF="035180_0013_1001283514D4B3E0">con&s;idered as di&s;tinct from the national religion. Let me &s;hew you the real expe|diency of &s;ecret &s;ocieties, from the nature of man; and then let me expo&s;e to you briefly the want of internal evidence in the late attempts to fa&s;ten the charge of a con&s;piracy upon our order. We may then pa&s;s to the duties of this joyful anni|ver&s;ary.</P>
<P>ON the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion we &s;hould not have troubled our&s;elves with &s;o needle&s;s a compari&s;on, as of the different ends of Ma|&s;onry and Religion, and yet of the advan|tages of both, had not a popular objection been formed from it. We might as &s;oon have thought that there was no need of an account book, becau&s;e there was a bible; or no need of laws, the Congre&s;s, or Pre&s;i|dent, becau&s;e there was a religion, a Sa|viour, and a God. But when trifles can &s;eize the public attention, they can become important things in their con&s;equences.
<PB N="15" REF="035180_0014_1001060FB02397D8">The an&s;wers mu&s;t then be adapted to tho&s;e, upon whom prejudice can have any power. And did Paul reap no benefit from Roman liberty, after he became a chri&s;tian? Can a man have no relief, but from a chri&s;tian? If a man can prove him&s;elf a profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;|tian, need he no other claim upon charity? A Chri&s;tian is of a &s;ect, and of a &s;eparate communion, every where, and from nece&s;&s;i|ty. It is one family which he choo&s;es, pre|fers, and enters. It is a union with opinions, not with the world. Paul tells the chri&s;tians, that they are not of the world; but not that therefore they ought to go out of the world. There are friend&s;hips and &s;ocial duties with all mankind. What&s;oever things are lovely, and of good reputation; wherever there is virtue and prai&s;e, chri&s;|tians are &s;o practi&s;e &s;uch things. We have our intercour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, and our mo|rality of life, as well as of religion. We engage in the commerce of the world, and are obliged to &s;ee man, when we are to
<PB N="16" REF="035180_0015_100128369953A480">forget the prejudices of his heart and of his head. There is then no better rea&s;on that the &s;ame man &s;hould not be a Ma&s;on, and a Chri&s;tian, than that he &s;hould not be clothed, becau&s;e he is fed; or that he &s;hould not have an uncle, a benefactor, or a friend, while his father was living. The object of Chri&s;tianity and Ma&s;onry never can be the &s;ame, becau&s;e chri&s;tianity has, as its immediate object, the advancement of per&s;onal virtue always above the &s;tate of &s;ociety in common life. It propo&s;es its highe&s;t rewards in a future exi&s;tence, and directs all its a&s;&s;ociations to this end. Our in&s;titution provides immediately for the friend&s;hip of life and manners through the the world, when we overlook all the opi|nions in it, and regard only &s;afety, confi|dence, and our &s;ocial intere&s;t.</P>
<P>FEW men, who think, and ob&s;erve the different ends of life, will be content to dwell upon this objection. Another more
<PB N="17" REF="035180_0016_100128381E641EF0">&s;pecious is ready. What need can there be for any &s;ecret &s;ocieties? Why may not every thing be open, common, and uni|ver&s;al? This is language adapted to the unthinking. It &s;eems &s;ocial, generous, and even great, while it is di&s;organizing. It is what is to be wi&s;hed, but cannot rea|dily be obtained. But let us con&s;ult the nature of man. What is the &s;ocial &s;pring? Is it the knowledge or love of all men? Does man begin to act from him&s;elf, or from the whole? Is not the &s;ocial &s;pring, pre&s;ervation, which he learns to employ? He then fir&s;t looks to things near to him. As he ri&s;es and &s;urveys, he looks further on. But &s;till the pro&s;pect is bounded, and di&s;tant objects are not di&s;tinct. Mu&s;t he delay till all men agree? He might as well &s;top the tide of life, call the infant into man, and convert man into an angel. What would be his fate, if he regarded not any, till he could enjoy all? What world is provided to render him happy? The
<PB N="18" REF="035180_0017_10010615F8670E70">principle of private a&s;&s;ociations is then univer&s;al, and always employed. Tradi|tion betrays it among &s;avages. It is the privilege of every profe&s;&s;ion, and of every art. The my&s;teries of Greece are in name immortal. They &s;urvived, at Rome, the glory of Greece. They were indulged in the forms of the primitive Church. They belong to the u&s;ual confidence of life. They a&s;&s;i&s;t in the nature of friend&s;hip, and form the exclu&s;ive right which makes of twain one fle&s;h. The di&s;ciples of Je&s;us dared not to blame the lovely confidence, which the character of John in&s;pired. It is then a privilege by birth right from hea|ven. It is the choice boon of friend&s;hip. It is the right of common nature through the globe, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by common law, and the con&s;ent of nations, in &s;ome degree, through the world. It can be abridged on|ly in the lo&s;s of rational liberty, and can be &s;urrendered to no government, but as the la&s;t price to be paid for a mi&s;erable
<PB N="19" REF="035180_0018_10010643CE9D2278">exi&s;tence. This ark of God has been touched, when the &s;alutary arts by which man conveys him&s;elf to man have been de|nied; when reading, writing and &s;peaking have been prohibited; when travelling abroad has been prevented; when the vi|&s;its of foreigners have been re&s;trained; when a change of condition has been refu&s;|ed to indu&s;try, to genius and to virtue. All the&s;e things have been the &s;ubjects of many laws, and have been taken from mankind, upon the plau&s;ible pretences of public over private right. But laws &s;hould have ju&s;tice; and the greate&s;t good of pub|lic and private character is that ju&s;tice. We &s;tand then in the liberty in which God has made us free.</P>
<P>BUT no right can licence any abu&s;e. To prove this abu&s;e to be real, is the la&s;t effort of political &s;tratagem. It is that by which the mo&s;t innocent orders have been puni&s;hed with the guilty. The &s;uper&s;ti|tious
<PB N="20" REF="035180_0019_1001283A691D5848">are taught, that Ma&s;onry is again&s;t Chri&s;tianity; the ignorant, that we are un&s;ocial and narrow in our foundation. But the politician affirms, that our right cannot be &s;afe to civil &s;ociety, and there|fore cannot exi&s;t as a civil privilege. The abu&s;e in fact is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the at|tempt to refu&s;e the privilege. It has been pretended. But we ought to be guarded again&s;t a &s;word, which, when drawn, is again&s;t Ma&s;onry throughout the world. We are fir&s;t to be made hateful, and then we &s;hall be abandoned to oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT let us examine the internal evi|dence of the books which contain the proofs of the mo&s;t dangerous abu&s;e; a con&s;piracy again&s;t &s;ociety, law, and even of man again&s;t him&s;elf. Where was it di&s;covered? In Germany. Where did it act? In France. France then was revolu|tionized by Germany. This is news, cer|tainly. Who began it? A man who &s;ays,
<PB N="21" REF="035180_0020_1001061A90A7C370">what he did, he did when he knew nothing of Ma&s;onry; and his enemies acknow|ledged it. Why then &s;hould Ma&s;onry &s;uf|fer for it? But how did the French get it? They found it. When? After the Ger|mans dropped it. So futile is the whole hi&s;tory. But who believes it? Not one good writer among the forty millions of Germans, who knew the whole pretence. What &s;ay men abroad? That it is a per|nicious work, without proper documents, and ju&s;t evidence. Who publi&s;hed it? Men, who have taken up an evil report, who do not agree together. But who were the principal agents in the pretended mi&s;chief? Of the chief, his many works &s;peak genius, love of order, and love of truth; and he is as quiet a man, and as u&s;eful, as &s;ocie|ty has in it. The mo&s;t active, has pub|li&s;hed works before and &s;ince this accu&s;a|tion, which prove him a zealous Chri&s;tian. Of the la&s;t, a man of the greate&s;t addre&s;s, and the greate&s;t traveller, and to whom is
<PB N="22" REF="035180_0021_1001283E3AEEAB80">charged the mo&s;t mi&s;chief, it is affirmed by him&s;elf, that he knew nothing of Illu|minati&s;m but from the public prints. What kind of con&s;piracy is this? But how do the accu&s;ers agree? They were not on the ground, and do not agree in their own documents, and mi&s;repre&s;entations have been proved upon them all. But how have the&s;e accu&s;ed men been puni&s;hed? The leading characters publi&s;h their works with applau&s;e, and have the public confi|dence. Were their de&s;igns ever made known? Yes, and patroni&s;ed by the Em|perour. Their meetings were at fir&s;t en|couraged, and the Prote&s;tants had the be|nefit; and the &s;alutary mea&s;ures were re|ported in America. Whence then aro&s;e the trouble? The government changed its mea&s;ures; till at length, from the free&s;t political inquiries, the Emperour proceed|ed to the extreme of prohibiting the print|ing of any &s;uch books, of a &s;ize that a poor man could purcha&s;e. Were there any charges
<PB N="23" REF="035180_0022_1001281D45693D18">of rebellion, or of public di&s;contents, a|gain&s;t the&s;e men? No; of &s;peculative opi|nions only. Who then were the&s;e men of &s;peculation? Men of letters, living in and maintained by the &s;tate; not di&s;affected men. What were their &s;peculations? Any thing which &s;lander and &s;u&s;picion could &s;ugge&s;t. Was there no pretended evi|dence? Yes, from writings never &s;igned, and ab&s;olutely denied. Their wor&s;t di&s;|cour&s;es were confe&s;&s;edly filled with the pure&s;t morality; and all the papers of their proceedings were offered to govern|ment, and they offered to &s;tand trial upon them. Who were the men? Chiefly cler|gymen; four fifths of them were either of this order, or profe&s;&s;ors in univer&s;ities; and they had no livings from the people, but from the government. What end had they? The accu&s;ation propo&s;es no end but wanton mi&s;chief, in which they had every thing to lo&s;e, and nothing to gain. Did the clergy of France or America de&s;ert
<PB N="24" REF="035180_0023_1001283FC4E111B8">their e&s;tabli&s;hments in this manner? It is well known that no men in public livings ever did. How did they conduct in their a&s;&s;ociations? Profe&s;&s;ed good principles, and were &s;aid to be open in their opinions, even when charged with con&s;piracy. The di&s;&s;olution of the order was from a contro|ver&s;y with particular members. The charges were brought, not again&s;t all, but a few of &s;uppo&s;ed higher grades. The accu&s;ers before the public were convicted of ignorance, and as not belonging to or|ders they accu&s;ed. And it is confe&s;&s;ed, that ejected religious orders were bu&s;y with their re&s;entments in all the tran&s;actions. The characters are &s;o grouped, that every man may &s;ee the ab&s;urdity of their pre|tended concurrence. Such is ingenuou&s;ly the &s;ub&s;tance of the whole evidence to prove the abu&s;e of Ma&s;onry, and then to degrade the whole in&s;titution. It has but one apology, and that ari&s;es from the di&s;|tre&s;s of the world. Alarm was every
<PB N="25" REF="035180_0024_1001061E9C1F2C48">where. Phantoms and &s;pectres became every where real beings. Men &s;u&s;pected every thing. And this was the opportunity to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;es of a fal&s;e zeal, of private re&s;entment, or of the mo&s;t dar|ing ambition of power. But it is too late. Free Ma&s;ons have long been in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ancient privileges. The&s;e, from long indulgence, they con&s;ider as their ju&s;t liberty; and, as they have never forfeited it, they will continue to hold and to enjoy it.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t purpo&s;es of life in civil &s;ociety have led men to &s;uch a&s;&s;ociations. The my&s;teries of Greece gave freedom to the &s;pirit even of a Philo&s;opher in the days of ancient liberty. Rome con&s;ented to accept the gift. Roman citizen&s;hip gave a rich value to a&s;&s;ociation in civil &s;ociety; and the religious orders &s;upported the cau&s;e of the church, by extending the &s;ame idea to the chri&s;tian religion. The Je&s;uits made
<PB N="26" REF="035180_0025_100128414999EA90">the bold experiment of its power, with unexampled &s;ucce&s;s, and might have conti|nued in glory, had they not been pervert|ed by private ambition. Ma&s;ons have not made a bolder, but &s;afer experiment. Without regard to forms of government, or private opinions, it embraces every where what is happy for man, upon the laws of his own con&s;titution. It puts that as a law, which is found convenient. It takes up &s;o much of the character of man, as agrees with his fir&s;t duties. It was thus the old Abbe ST. PIERRE gave the ele|ments of his project for a perpetual peace. It is thus KANT, in the &s;ame de&s;ign, pro|po&s;es to re&s;tore confidence among mankind. Our principles are the &s;ober theory of hu|man nature, which mu&s;t ble&s;s the world.</P>
<P>HAPPY then mu&s;t we be in our ancient in&s;titution. Its object is to find an home, wherever man is to be found. It bids eve|ry brother to take the le&s;&s;ons of his duty
<PB N="27" REF="035180_0026_100106232EFCCF00">from his heart. There is no obligation of gratitude, but go, and do likewife. It is man it loves, and with God it unites to ble&s;s him in every clime.</P>
<P>ON the pre&s;ent anniver&s;ary, the ESSEX LODGE is not without the mo&s;t plea&s;ing recollections. The &s;ame faithful Ma&s;ter, who fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ed our Lodge, and who&s;e name is in all the Lodges, is yet with us, and contributed largely to adorn the new building we have rai&s;ed. How indefatiga|ble, per&s;evering, and benevolent, have been his labours! Who, that ta&s;tes the joy of this day, and is grateful for its pre&s;erva|tion, does not love the name of HILLER? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">JOSEPH HILLER, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Collector of the Port of Salem.</NOTE> Let him re&s;t from his labours, in the glo|ry of the temple he has rai&s;ed. The hap|pine&s;s of the Lodge was &s;incere, when our late Ma&s;ter, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">EDWARD PULLING, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Attorney at Law.</NOTE> in whom united our ut mo&s;t confidence and affection, accepted the em|blems
<PB N="28" REF="035180_0027_100128445B892608">of his equal government, and gene|rous prudence. We have pre&s;erved the harmony, which he gave to the Brethren. Often &s;hall we lament the &s;ad indi&s;po&s;ition, which obliges his ab&s;ence, and which gives a two-fold bereavement to his &s;pirits, when he thinks of the &s;eparation. Infirmity may impair our own memory, but we may live in the memory of our friends. Time has never made the bold de&s;ign of a palace rude, like the native quarry, by effacing the grandeur from the venerable ruins. But ble&s;&s;ed be the power of good example. Our &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is happy, though &s;o often renewed. There are ready ma&s;ter builders for our noble&s;t de&s;igns. The unanimity in our election of the pre&s;ent Ma&s;ter, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Captain DENJAMIN HODOIS.</NOTE> is an honourable te&s;timony to him, and a &s;ure proof that he has the riche&s;t materials in his hands. There is harmony in the work, indu&s;try in the ta&s;k, and zeal for perfec|tion. It is no common honour to unite in our&s;elves the afrections of the faithful. And
<PB N="29" REF="035180_0028_100128475FE65608">the con&s;idence of Brethren exacts the high|e&s;t &s;en&s;e of duty. Happy are we in the be|lief, that our own obligations will increa&s;e, and that we &s;hall owe every duty to our cau&s;e, as the ju&s;t and highe&s;t reward of a generous benefactor, who is con&s;ecrated to our &s;ervice. Our pillars &s;tand &s;trong. The &s;ame eye continues to watch over our trea|&s;ure, and the &s;ame hand engraves our deeds on the tables we have prepared. We de&s;cend to the world by ea&s;y &s;teps, and the door is &s;hut in peace.</P>
<P>THE character of human life u&s;ually re|quires, while we recount the greate&s;t ble&s;|&s;ings, that we &s;hould with friendly circum|&s;pection admoni&s;h of growing evils; for, as the weeds, they will grow in the garden of God. While jealou&s;y &s;tands ready to mark the lea&s;t errours, and while &s;ad experience may prove, that errours may every where exi&s;t; while we have artful men around us to mi&s;repre&s;ent, and weak men to mi&s;con|ceive, this is the time when &s;uch admoni|tions
<PB N="30" REF="035180_0029_10010627C7E681B8">are ju&s;t. But it is a lovely reflection on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, that they were ne|ver le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary; and it is the pure&s;t am|bition of my &s;oul, for the honour of the Craft, that we may remain with the &s;ame glory which now di&s;tingui&s;hes us. Hu|manity has not higher hopes. The ex|alted charity; the undi&s;&s;embled con&s;ent of &s;oul; the ready &s;ervice in our common in|tere&s;t; the ju&s;t reputation of the members; and the real virtues of their lives, are &s;ub|jects of the pure&s;t congratulations. Their indu&s;try, &s;ucce&s;s, and hopes, in&s;pire the highe&s;t prai&s;e.</P>
<P>LET us venerate our ancient in&s;titution. Our con&s;ent in this &s;imple form, unites us with all nations. Our hearts are here pre|pared for the noble&s;t duties. We can a&s;&s;i&s;t the world in its be&s;t hopes, and certainly concur in the be&s;t ends of civil &s;ociety. A&s;&s;ociation we learn from God.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>GREAT Light of Life! whom all be|ings love, becau&s;e they enjoy thee! In every thing thou art, and in us. We live in the light of thy countenance. We exi&s;t by thy &s;trength, and are harmony in thee. Ble&s;s us, even us, O our Father! Give us one &s;oul. Influence us by the &s;ame zeal. Purify us by the &s;ame light of truth. In the joy of this day we prai&s;e thee. Joy makes our prai&s;e &s;ublime! Ble&s;s the Brethren, one in name and in heart. Ble&s;s the Elect, who &s;tand near thee to re|pre&s;ent thy power. May they proclaim al&s;o thy wildom and love. May the Ma&s;|ter be glorious and farm, like the arch of heaven, in which all the revolutions of na|ture are performed. May the Wardens be &s;ure as the poles of our globe. May the Deacons be con&s;tant as the hours. May the Trea&s;urer keep what time cannot cor|rupt; and the Secretary record what eter|nal truth &s;hall approve. May the Stew|ards be faithful, as the earth in its rich increa&s;e; and the Tyler be like the eye of a kind providence, which watches un&s;een. All in thee, and each in all. To the great Light of Life be glory.</P>
