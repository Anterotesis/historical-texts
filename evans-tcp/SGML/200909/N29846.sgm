<HEAD>An Introduction in order to an Expo&s;ition upon the 1. <HI>Chap.</HI> of the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of <HI>John.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BUt before we enter upon the Expo&s;i|tion of it, let us premi&s;e the&s;e fol|lowing particulars: In the fir&s;t place
<PB N="2" REF="039690_0002_10143ADEF54B6AD8">
let us take Notice, this Fir&s;t <HI>Chap.</HI> is an Epi&s;tle written by it &s;elf, di&s;tinct from the re&s;t of the Book; and not written Singu|larly by the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> as the re&s;t of the Book is, as appears Ver&s;e 1&s;t, <HI>That which we have &s;een,</HI> Ver&s;e 2nd, <HI>For the life was mani|fe&s;ted, and we have &s;een it:</HI> Ver&s;e 3d, <HI>That which we have &s;een,</HI> Ver&s;e 4th, <HI>And the&s;e things write we unto you,</HI> Ver&s;e 5th, <HI>This then is the me&s;&s;age which we have heard of him, and declare unto you:</HI> thus it appears to be written Plu|ralitively; that is, by more than by the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> in u&s;ing the word We.</P>
<P>But the re&s;t of the Books, is written. Singularly by the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> as appears, Chap. 2.1. <HI>The&s;e things write I unto you,</HI> ver&s;e 7th, <HI>I write no new commandment unto you,</HI> and &s;o through out the book; as appears in the la&s;t Chap. ver&s;e 13. <HI>The&s;e things have I writ|ten unto you, that believe on the name of the Son of God.</HI> Thus it appears, that the &s;econd Chapter to the end of the Book is a &s;econd Epi&s;tle, written to believers in the Light, to encourage them to continue in that State; and written by the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> in his own name Singularly, in Saying; <HI>I write unto you,</HI> not u&s;ing the word we, as he doth in the fir&s;t Chapter.</P>
<P>A Second thing to be ob&s;erved, is, That as
<PB N="3" REF="039690_0002_10143ADEF54B6AD8">
the fir&s;t Chapter contains a di&s;tinct Epi&s;tle from the re&s;t of the Book; So it is not di|rected to per&s;ons in the &s;ame State and Con|dition, as the other part of the Book is di|rected to: for the fir&s;t 4 Ver&s;es of this Chap. is written to the Sinful World, or to &s;uch as were not in fellow&s;hip with the Children of God, as appears in the 3d and 4th Ver&s;es. <HI>That which we have &s;een and heard declare we unto you, that ye al&s;o may have fellow&s;hip with us,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And the&s;e things write we unto you,</HI> &amp;c. And the other 6 Ver&s;es, contains a Me&s;&s;age &s;ent from God, and directed to &s;uch, as had lo&s;t Sight of their Calling and Election, &amp; were in a State of darkne&s;s, with the re&s;t of the world; having wandred from the Uni|ty and Fellow&s;hip which once they were in with God: and the me&s;&s;age from God was, and is, to reduce and bring them back to God again, by repentance and confe&s;&s;ion of their Sins; that thereby they might obtain forgivene&s;s of them, and &s;o come to be clean|&s;ed from all Sin, as tho&s;e were that walked in the light: as God is in the Light, as ap|pears in the 7th ver&s;e.</P>
<P>And <HI>thirdly</HI> we may ob&s;erve, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>John,</HI> in Chap. 2.1. begins his own Epi&s;tle in his own name, thus; <HI>My lit|tle Children the&s;e things write I unto you,</HI> and
<PB N="4" REF="039690_0003_10143AE09F7E60C0">
&s;o goes on in his writing, from babes in Chri&s;t, to young men and Fathers in Chri&s;t, yea, unto all Sorts and degrees of Chri&s;tians, who were in the light. But the fir&s;t Chap. contains a particular Epi&s;tle written in the Pluralitive; that is in the name of many, or in the name of all the Children of God, who were in the light, as God is in the light; who were clean&s;ed by the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t from all Sin, as appears in the 7 ver&s;e, and by them directed to the World, and to them that were in a State of Sin and dark|ne&s;s, as appears in the 5th and 6th ver&s;es.</P>

<P>Now we are come to the Second part of this Epi&s;tle, which contains a me&s;&s;age from God, which all the Children of God that are in the light hath heard of him, and are to declare unto their brethren that are in a State of darkne&s;s.</P>
