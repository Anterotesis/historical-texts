<HEAD><HI>ADVERTISEMENT</HI> to the <HI>London EDITION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Reader may depend upon the following Poem being the genuine production of a native of America: The Author is not vain enough to flatter him&s;elf, that it will throw any fre&s;h lu&s;tre on the character of General WASH|INGTON, or entitle his un&s;kilful mu&s;e to the &s;malle&s;t degree of poetical &s;ame. His &s;ole view in penning this epi&s;tle was to expre&s;s, in the be&s;t manner he was able, the warm feelings of a grateful individual towards that di&s;tingui&s;hed and be&s;t of men; to whom he, and every American, will in all likelihood be indebted for the independence and commercial pro&s;perity of his country. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;ole motive for publi&s;hing this Poem, and adding thereto a &s;ketch of the Life and Character of General Wa&s;hington (which the Editor now gives to the Reader in the plain unaltered narrative of the Author, who is connected and intimate in the family of that great man) is for the charitable purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a few guineas to relieve, in a &s;mall mea&s;ure, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of &s;ome hundreds of American pri&s;oners, now &s;uffering confinement in the gaols of England. The profits ari&s;ing from the &s;ale of this book will be faithfully appropriated to that purpo&s;e; and this the Editor re&s;ts a&s;&s;ured will be a much &s;tronger incitement for the benevolent and humane to become purcha&s;ers of it, than any intrin&s;ic value the performance may demand.</P>
<P>Very large and liberal &s;ums were given for this charitable purpo&s;e in January <HI>1778.</HI> The Committee appointed for its di&s;tribution, to prevent an overflow of public genero&s;ity, clo&s;ed the &s;ub&s;cription, thinking it was very ample; and hoped that after &s;ome &s;hort period no pri&s;oners, in this ever to be lamented war, would on either &s;ide remain. That hope having vani&s;hed, the progre&s;s of calamity not being &s;topt, and no pro&s;pect of its conclu&s;ion, the Committee again opened the &s;ub&s;cription; and with a degree of &s;ucce&s;s that places the character of the nation and of individuals in the mo&s;t honorable light, by proving that their humanity is not the capricious or fa&s;hionable ex|ertion of the moment, but a con&s;tant impul&s;e, and the deliberate re&s;ult of their rea&s;on. This additional &s;ub&s;cription, though di&s;bur&s;ed with oeconomy, is now expended, and the wants of the&s;e unhappy &s;ufferers nearly as exten&s;ive as ever. The pains of captivity cannot be much lightened by this &s;mall mite of an ob&s;cure individual; but &s;uch munificent donations as have been made by Engli&s;hmen towards their relief, mu&s;t &s;tamp a le&s;&s;ion on the minds of tho&s;e unfortunate captives, and our American brethren in general, that they &s;hould not withdraw all national affection from a country, the bulk of who&s;e in|habitants have not withdrawn all national affection from them.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="017436_0004_0FA11FCE7A348EF8">N. B. If there are any of the Generous and Humane who have not yet &s;ub&s;cribed to the relief of the Ame|rican Pri&s;oners, this publication gives them a fair op|portunity to exerci&s;e their benevolence, by &s;ending their donations for this book to the publi&s;hers; which they may be a&s;&s;ured will be faithfully applied, as it will be paid into the Committee for American Pri&s;oners by the Editor.</P>
<P>&dtristar; Fifteen Thou&s;and Copies of this POEM were Sold in the City of London, in about Three Weeks, at Two Shillings and Sixpence Sterling, each, and the Money appropriated to the Benefit of the American Pri&s;oners.</P>

If, from what I &s;hall &s;ay, the know|ledge you already have of this excellent man can be any-way improved, or any lu&s;tre can be added to that bril|liancy of character, which you give me to under&s;tand he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the eyes of Europe, I &s;hall deem the pains I have been at, in procuring the following intelligence, as highly compen&s;ated.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington is the third &s;on of Mr. Augu&s;tine Wa&s;hington, a man of large property and di&s;tingui&s;hed re|putation in the &s;tate of Virginia: an ance&s;tor of this gentle|man,

about the period of the Revolution, &s;old his property, near Cave, in the Ea&s;t Riding of York&s;hire, and came over to Virginia, where he purcha&s;ed lands in King George's County; and it was here that our hero was born on the 22d of February in the year 1733. In this county he has at this time three brothers, Samuel, John, and Charles, all gentle|men of con&s;iderable landed property, and a &s;i&s;ter who is mar|ried to colonel Fielding Lewis. His elder brother Lawrence, who went out a captain of the American troops, rai&s;ed for the Carthagena expedition, married the daughter of the honour|able William Fairfax, of Belvoir, in Virginia, by whom he left one daughter, who dying young, and his &s;econd brother al&s;o dying without i&s;&s;ue, the general &s;ucceeded to the family-&s;eat, which, in compliment to the gallant admiral of that name, is called Mount Vernon, and is delightfully &s;ituated on the Potomack River, a few miles below Alexandria. General Wa&s;hington is the elde&s;t &s;on by a &s;econd marriage; and, having never been out of America, was educated (as youths of fortune in this country generally are) under the eye of his father by private tutorage: a &s;light tincture of the Latin language, a grammatical knowledge of his mother-tongue, and the elements of mathematics, were the chief objects he was taught to pur&s;ue. For a few years after he quitted his tutor, he applied him&s;elf to the practical part of &s;urvey|ing (a knowledge of which is e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite to men of landed property in this country) and was appointed &s;urveyor to a certain di&s;trict in Virginia; an employment rather cre|ditable
<PB N="16" REF="017436_0016_0FA11FD7F241A960">
than lucrative; though it afforded him an opportu|nity of chu&s;ing &s;ome valuable tracts of land, and made him thoroughly acquainted with the frontier country.</P>
<P>On the governor and council of Virginia receiving orders from England, in October 1753, to repel by force the en|croachments of the French on the we&s;tern frontiers, along the rivers Ohio and de Boeuf, Mr. Wa&s;hington, then a major in the provincial &s;ervice, and an adjutant-general of their forces, was di&s;patched by general Dinwiddie, with a letter to the commander in chief of the French on the Ohio, complaining of the inroads they were making in direct violation of the treaties then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two crowns; he had al&s;o in&s;tructions to treat with the &s;ix nations and other we&s;tern tribes of Indians, and to engage them to continue firm in their attachment to England. He &s;et out on this perilous em|ba&s;&s;y, with about fifteen attendants, late in October 1753; and &s;o far &s;ucceeded, that on his return with mon&s;ieur de St. Pierre's an&s;wer, and his good &s;ucce&s;s in the Indian negocia|tions, he was complimented with the thanks and approba|tion of his country. His journal of the whole tran&s;action was publi&s;hed in Virginia, and does great credit to his in|du&s;try, attention, and judgment; and it has &s;ince proved of infinite &s;ervice to tho&s;e who have been doomed to traver&s;e the &s;ame inho&s;pitable tracts.</P>
<P>Soon after this, the de&s;igns of the French becoming more manife&s;t, and their movements and conduct more daring, orders were i&s;&s;ued out by admini&s;tration for the colonies to
<PB N="17" REF="017436_0017_0FA11FD8B38DD0A0">
arm and unite in one confederacy. The a&s;&s;embly of Vir|ginia took the lead by voting a &s;um of money for the public &s;ervice, and rai&s;ing a regiment of four hundred men for the protection of the frontiers of the colony. Major Wa&s;hington, then about twenty-three years of age, was appointed to the command of this regiment, and before the end of May, in the en&s;uing year, came up with a &s;trong party of the French and Indians, at a place called Red-&s;tone, which he effectually routed, after having taken and killed fifty men. Among the pri&s;oners were the celebrated woods-man mon&s;ieur De La Force and two other officers, from whom colonel Wa&s;hington had undoubted intelligence, that the French force on the Ohio con&s;i&s;ted of upwards of one thou&s;and regulars, and &s;ome hundreds of Indians. Upon this intelligence, although his little army was &s;omewhat reduced, and intirely in&s;ufficient to act offen&s;ively again&s;t the French and Indians, yet he pu&s;hed on towards his enemy to a good po&s;t; where, in order to wait the arrival of &s;ome expected &s;uccour from New York and Penn&s;ylvania, he entrenched him&s;elf, and built a &s;mall fort, called Fort Nece&s;&s;ity. At this po&s;t he remained un|mole&s;ted, and without any &s;uccour until the July following; when his &s;mall force, reduced now to le&s;s than three hun|dred men, was attacked by an army of French and Indians of eleven hundred and upwards, under the command of the Sieur de Villiers. The Virginians &s;u&s;tained the attack of the enemy's whole force for &s;everal hours, and laid near two hundred of them dead in the field, when the French com|mander, di&s;couraged by &s;uch determined re&s;olution, pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="18" REF="017436_0018_0FA11FD97359CC38">
the le&s;s dangerous method of di&s;lodging his enemy by a parley, which ended in an honourable capitulation. It was &s;tipulated that colonel Wa&s;hington &s;hould march away with all the honours of war, and be allowed to carry off all his military &s;tores, effects, and baggage. This capitulation was violated from the ungovernable di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;avages, whom the French commander could not re&s;train from plun|dering the provincials on the on&s;et of their march, and from making a con&s;iderable &s;laughter of men, cattle, and hor&s;es. This breach of the capitulation was &s;trongly remon&s;trated again&s;t by the Briti&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at the Court of Ver&s;ailles, and may be looked upon as the aera when the French court began to unma&s;k, and to avow (though in a clande&s;tine manner) the conduct of their governors and officers in America: they redoubled their activity and diligence on the Ohio, and in other places during the winter 1754 and the following &s;pring. Virginia had determined to &s;end out a larger force; the forts Cumberland and Louden were built, and a camp was formed at Wills Creek, from thence to annoy the enemy on the Ohio. In the&s;e &s;everal &s;ervices (particularly in the con&s;truction of the forts) colonel Wa&s;hington was prin|cipally employed, when he was &s;ummoned to attend general Braddock, who with his army arrived at Alexandria, in Vir|ginia, in May, 1755. The de&s;ign of &s;ending out that army, was to penetrate through the country to Fort du Que&s;ne (now Fort Pitt) by the route of Wills Creek; and as no per&s;on was better acquainted with the frontier country than colonel Wa&s;hington, and no one in the colony enjoyed &s;o well
<PB N="19" REF="017436_0019_0FA11FDA332A09A8">
e&s;tabli&s;hed a military character, he was judged highly &s;er|viceable to general Braddock, and cheerfully quitted his command to act as a volunteer and aid de camp under that unfortunate general. The particulars of the defeat, and al|mo&s;t total ruin of Braddock's army, con&s;i&s;ting of two thou|&s;and regular Briti&s;h forces, and near eight hundred provin|cials, are too well known to need a repetition: it is allowed on all &s;ides, that the haughty po&s;itive behaviour of the ge|neral, his high contempt of the provincial officers and &s;ol|diers, and his di&s;dainful ob&s;tinacy in rejecting their advice, were the genuine cau&s;es of this fatal di&s;a&s;ter. With what re|&s;olution and &s;teadine&s;s the provincials and their gallant com|mander behaved on this trying occa&s;ion, and in covering the confu&s;ed retreat of the army <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See captain Orme's letter to Governor Dinwiddie, and al&s;o the other ac|counts of that day.</NOTE>, let every Briti&s;h officer and &s;oldier confe&s;s, who were re&s;cued from &s;laughter on that calamitous day by their valour and conduct.</P>
<P>After general Braddock's di&s;a&s;ter, the colony of Virginia found it nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h her militia, rai&s;e more men, &s;trengthen her forts, undertake expeditions to check the in|roads of the enemy, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. In all which important &s;ervices colonel Wa&s;hington bore a principal &s;hare, and ac|quitted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction of his country, by di&s;playing on every occa&s;ion, the mo&s;t per&s;evering indu&s;try, per&s;onal courage, and military abilities. He was again ap|pointed to the command of the Virginia troops, and held it
<PB N="20" REF="017436_0020_0FA11FDAF1E65678">
with &s;ingular credit till his re&s;ignation in 1759, when he mar|ried the young widow of Mr. Cu&s;tis, his pre&s;ent lady; with whom he had a fortune of twenty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling in her own right, be&s;ides her dower in one of the principal e&s;tates in Virginia. From this period he became as a&s;&s;iduous to &s;erve the &s;tate as a &s;enator, as he had hitherto been active to defend it as a &s;oldier. For &s;everal years he repre&s;ented Frederick County, and had a &s;eat for Fairfax County, at the time he was appointed by the a&s;&s;embly, in conformity with the uni|ver&s;al wi&s;h of the people, to be one of their four delegates at the fir&s;t general congre&s;s. It was with no &s;mall reluctance that he engaged again in the active &s;cenes of life; and I &s;in|cerely believe that no motives but &s;uch as &s;pring from a mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m could have ever prevailed upon him to relinqui&s;h the mo&s;t refined dome&s;tic plea&s;ures, which it was ever in his power to command, and the great delight he took in farming and the improvement of his e&s;tate. You well know that general Wa&s;hington is, perhaps, the greate&s;t land|holder in America (the proprietors of Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland&punc; and the Northern Neck excepted;) for be&s;ides his lady's fortune, and ten thou&s;and pounds falling to him by the death of her only daughter, he has large tracts of land taken up by him&s;elf early in life, &s;ome con&s;iderable purcha&s;es made from officers who had lands allotted them for their &s;ervices; and has, moreover, made great additions to his e&s;tate at Mount Ver|non. It is impo&s;&s;ible in this country, as in England, to rate the value of e&s;tates by their annual rent or income, becau&s;e they are univer&s;ally tilled by negroes, and in the hands of land|holders.
<PB N="21" REF="017436_0021_0FA11FDBB26FCDE0">
There are many e&s;tates in the middle colonies, which never produced a clear income to their owners of five hundred a year, that may be ea&s;ily &s;old for forty thou&s;and pounds. General Wa&s;hington's, however, will not be over-rated, if &s;et down at a good four thou&s;and pounds Engli&s;h per annum, and his whole property could not be bought for forty years purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>When it was determined at length in Congre&s;s, after every &s;tep towards an accommodation had failed, and every petition from America had been &s;cornfully rejected, to repel by force the inva&s;ion from Great Britain, the eyes of the whole continent were immediately turned upon Mr. Wa&s;hington. With one common voice he was called forth to the defence of his country; and it is, perhaps, his peculiar glory, that there was not a &s;ingle inhabitant of the&s;e &s;tates, except him&s;elf, who did not approve the choice, and place the firme&s;t con|fidence in his integrity and abilities <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;omewhat &s;ingular, that even in England not one reflexion was ever ca&s;t, or the lea&s;t di&s;re&s;pectful word uttered again&s;t him.</NOTE>. He arrived at Cam|bridge in New England, in July 1775, and there took the &s;upreme command of the armies of America. He was receive|ed at the camp with that heart-felt exultation which &s;u|perior merit can alone in&s;pire, after having in his progre&s;s through the &s;everal &s;tates received every mark of affection and e&s;teem, which they conceived were due to the man, whom the whole continent looked up to for &s;afety and freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="017436_0022_0FA11FDC728DC9A8">As he always refu&s;ed to accept of any pecuniary appoint|ment for his public &s;ervices, no &s;alary has been annexed by Congre&s;s to his important command, and he only draws weekly for the expences of his public table and other nece&s;&s;ary demands. General Wa&s;hington having never been in Europe, could not po&s;&s;ibly have &s;een much military &s;ervice when the armies of Britain were &s;ent to &s;ubdue us; yet &s;till, for a variety of rea&s;ons, he was by much the mo&s;t proper man on this continent, and probably any where el&s;e, to be placed at the head of an American army. The very high e&s;timation he &s;tood in for integrity and honour, his engaging in the cau&s;e of his country from &s;entiment and a conviction of her wrongs, his moderation in politics, his exten&s;ive property, and his approved abilities as a commander, were motives which nece&s;&s;arily obliged the choice of America to fall upon him. That nature has given him extraordinary military talents will hardly be controverted by his mo&s;t bitter ene|mies; and having been early actuated with a warm pa&s;&s;ion to &s;erve his country in the military line, he has greatly im|proved them by unwearied indu&s;try, and a clo&s;e application to the be&s;t writers upon tactics, and by a more than common method and exactne&s;s: and, in reality, when it comes to be con&s;idered that at fir&s;t he only headed a body of men intirely unacquainted with military di&s;cipline or operations, &s;ome|what ungovernable in temper, and who at be&s;t could only be &s;tiled an alert and good militia, acting under very &s;hort en|li&s;tments, uncloathed, unaccoutred, and at all times very ill &s;upplied with ammunition and artillery; and that with &s;uch an army he with&s;tood the ravages and progre&s;s of near forty
<PB N="23" REF="017436_0023_0FA11FDE5D471A18">
thou&s;and veteran troops, plentifully provided with every ne|ce&s;&s;ary article, commanded by the brave&s;t officers in Europe, and &s;upported by a very powerful navy, which effectually prevented all movements by water; when, I &s;ay, all this comes to be impartially con&s;idered, I think I may venture to pronounce, that general Wa&s;hington will be regarded by man|kind as one of the greate&s;t military ornaments of the pre&s;ent age, and that his name will command the veneration of the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>I would not mention to you the per&s;on of this excellent man, were I not convinced that it bears great analogy to the qualifications of his mind. General Wa&s;hington is now in the forty-&s;eventh year of his age; he is a tall well-made man, rather large boned, and has a tolerably genteel addre&s;s: his features are manly and bold, his eyes of a bluei&s;h ca&s;t and very lively; his hair a deep brown, his face rather long and marked with the &s;mall pox, his complexion &s;un-burnt and without much colour, and his countenance &s;en&s;ible, com|po&s;ed, and thoughtful; there is a remarkable air of dignity about him, with a &s;triking degree of gracefulne&s;s: he has an excellent under&s;tanding without much quickne&s;s; is &s;trictly ju&s;t, vigilant, and generous; an affectionate hu&s;band, a faith|ful friend, a father to the de&s;erving &s;oldier; gentle in his manners, in temper rather re&s;erved; a total &s;tranger to reli|gious prejudices, which have &s;o often excited Chri&s;tians of one denomination to cut the throats of tho&s;e of another; in his morals irreproachable; he was never known to exceed the bounds of the mo&s;t rigid temperance: In a word, all his
<PB N="24" REF="017436_0024_0FA11FDEB4B86A08">
friends and acquaintance univer&s;ally allow, that no man ever united in his own per&s;on a more perfect alliance of the vir|tues of a philo&s;opher with the talents of a general. Candour, &s;incerity, affability and &s;implicity, &s;eem to be the &s;triking fea|tures of his character, till an occa&s;ion offers of di&s;playing the mo&s;t determined bravery and independence of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Such, my good friend, is the man, to whom America has intru&s;ted her important cau&s;e. Hitherto &s;he has had every rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with her choice; and mo&s;t ungrateful would &s;he be to the great Di&s;po&s;er of human events, were &s;he not to render him unremitting thanks for having pro|vided her with &s;uch a citizen at &s;uch a cri&s;is. Mo&s;t nations have been favoured with &s;ome patriotic deliverer: the I&s;|raelites had their Mo&s;es; Rome had her Camillus; Greece her Leonidas; Sweden her Gu&s;tavus; and England her Hambdens, her Ru&s;&s;els, and her Sydneys; but the&s;e illu&s;|trious heroes, though &s;ucce&s;sful in pre&s;erving and defending, did not, like Wa&s;hington, form or e&s;tabli&s;h empires, which will be the refuge or a&s;ylum of Liberty bani&s;hed from Europe by luxury and corruption. Mu&s;t not therefore, your heart beat with con&s;cious pride at the pro&s;pect of your friend's being ranked among (if not above) tho&s;e illu&s;trious patriots? at the enchanting thought, that He, whom you know and love, &s;hall be acknowledged by pre&s;ent and future generations as their great deliverer, and the chief in&s;trument in the hands of the Almighty for laying the foundation of that freedom and happine&s;s, which, I tru&s;t, await the future myriads of this va&s;t continent?</P>
