<HEAD>AN ANSWER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IMPARTIALITY (it &s;eems this Letter wri|ter would have his Readers believe) is the chief Ba&s;es, on which he has founded his Ar|guments; but eiher for want of Hone&s;ty, or Policy, or both, he has for&s;ook it in the mo&s;t obvious Manner: For where a Man is impartial, he deals in Truth to the be&s;t of his Judgment, not favouring either party; but this Author has en|deavoured, with all his little Politicks, to paliate the Actions of the one Side, when for want of Policy he has exclaimed again&s;t the other, in the mo&s;t malignant Manner.</P>
<P>HE begins his Letter thus, The <HI>Paxton</HI> Riot (as it is called) makes &s;o great a Noi&s;e, <Q>And is &s;o much the general Topick, that a Man mu&s;t be but little in Conver&s;ation, without having his Opinion asked concerning this Affair.</Q> What mu&s;t this Que&s;tion be! Whether the King will bring tho&s;e Men to Ju&s;tice, for that Act, and puni&s;h them according to their de&s;erts. Not whether they de&s;erve Puni&s;hment; that's a Que&s;tion, I believe, never asked: For I think it mu&s;t be the &s;ettled Opinion of every &s;olid Man, that the <HI>Paxton</HI> Men, who Murdered the <HI>Indians,</HI> de&s;erve the &s;ame Puni&s;h|ment as though they had Murdered &s;o many white

People under the &s;ame Situation.&mdash;Again.&mdash;<Q>In Truth Matters are now come to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that &s;ome People are of Opinion, that an endeavour to make them wor&s;e may probably be the way to make them better.</Q> Here he mu&s;t mean the <HI>Paxton</HI> People and their Advocates, who, if they had &s;ucceeded in their attempts on the Lives of the <HI>Indians</HI> in the Barraks, with Murdering &s;ome of the Citizens, for who&s;e Scalps they offered Two Hundred Pounds each, then they &s;hould have been able to have de&s;troyed the Con&s;titution of Government, and &s;ettled a Republick, agreeable to their own darling Principles. Again, for my Part, I am no adept <Q>in Politicks, and have but &s;eldom troubled my Head about that Science be|yond the reading of a common News-Paper.</Q>&mdash;The word Politicks is this, (that Part of Ethick, or Moral Philo&s;ophy, that relates to the well-govern|ing a State or Kingdom. Here I join him: But why did he not content him&s;elf &s;oly with reading his News-papers? And not Vindicate the <HI>Paxton</HI> peo|ple; and their bloody Act, by introducing Quo|tations from divers places in Hi&s;torys, that I am &s;ure his common News-papers never u&s;hered into his Brain: And that with fal&s;e Quotations and hor|red Mi&s;repre&s;entations, which I am &s;ure, agreeable to his own Sentiments, proves that he is no poli|tition. But did this Letter Writer imagine, that in ca&s;e the <HI>Paxton</HI> people had &s;ucceeded in their At|tempt, it would have e&s;caped the Notice of his Maje&s;ty? (Wofull &s;tupidity! Or did they propo&s;e to have thrown of the Reins of Government en|tirely, and paid no Tribute but to their Godde&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="009580_0004_0F76DDCBF59E3628">
<HI>Pre&s;bytery?</HI> If this I &s;ay be his meaning (which I rather think it is) it al&s;o proves him to be no poli|tition, for had he been one of that Cla&s;s, he would have concealed his Sentiments from the populace, and only devulged them to his dear Brethren. He &s;ayeth I have no <Q>other View in troubling you with this Letter, then to re&s;cue the mi&s;erable Frontier people, who lately ro&s;e in Arms, from the infamy and odium thrown upon them.</Q> I think the <HI>Paxton</HI> people may be tired of their Ad|vocate by this Time. They committed the wor&s;t of Crimes, and he is making bad wor&s;e; he is de|vulging the whole Scheme; he tells us it was to make better Times. If that be &s;o it mu&s;t be under the head I have already mentioned; but this Opi|nion is no policy; for if they have by that Act, u&s;hered into their corrupt Minds, &s;ome &s;mall Glimps of fain'd plea&s;ure, I think the Time is coming, when they I wi&s;h they had never &s;een the Light of that Day. He goes on and tells us, <Q>that whil&s;t they were thus bu&s;ied, and thus &s;tripped of their Birth-Rights,&mdash;<HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> two petty fellows, who ought to have no higher Claims than them&s;elves, were permitted to Lord it over the Land, and in contempt of the Go|vernment and the expre&s;s Orders of the Crown, for bidding them to hold private Treaties with the <HI>Indians.</HI></Q>&mdash;Here is the want of policy; when he intended to exclaim again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> he heaps the highe&s;t Ecomiums on them, when he &s;ayeth they ought to have (ob&s;erve) no higher Claims than them&s;elves; which plainly points out, that they &s;hould have no higher Claims than their

own Merits de&s;erve, which it &s;eems was e&s;teemed great,&mdash;(by whom?) Why by our Superiors. For he &s;ayeth, that they were (ob&s;erve) permitted. I ask this Writer, who permitted them? It could not be their Equals. For no Man hath power to per|mit another to do a Thing, but he mu&s;t al&s;o have power to forbid the doing of that Thing. Here is the meaning of the Word, <HI>(permit.)</HI> I. e. to give leave, to Authorize, Suffer or allow, a per|&s;on to do &s;omewhat&mdash;now I &s;ay, a per&s;on mu&s;t be inve&s;ted with power in him&s;elf, before he can de|ligate another to Tran&s;act any Affair; neither can a Man act in Contempt of Authority, when his Actions receive their very Being from that Autho|rity. Well I conceive the Force of his Argument carries thus much, that <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> were Men, who&s;e Viracity the Government might con|fide in; therefore allowed to act in the Manner they thought fit. A very ju&s;t permi&s;&s;ion; for it has evi|dently appeared, that tho&s;e two Men have acted their parts in the mo&s;t worthy Manner they were capable of, for the well-being of this province, with regard to <HI>Indian</HI> Affairs.&mdash;I ask how can that be? When the &s;ame Writer affirmeth, that they have acted in Contempt of the Government, and the expre&s;s orders of the Crown. Why I mu&s;t allow it to be a plain Contradiction. But will not his &s;peaking the Truth in the Front of his Letter (where he &s;ayeth he is no Adept in politicks) pali|ate for a few Untruths in the following Sheets, well but he &s;ayeth they held private &mdash; Treaties with the <HI>Indians.</HI> (Where was that) why at the publick Treaty at <HI>Lanca&s;ter:</HI> Where his
<PB N="6" REF="009580_0006_0F76DDCD4F99C258">
late Honour, the Governor, with the Commi&s;|&s;ioners, was pre&s;ent. How could that be a pri|vacy when acted publickly? And he &s;ayeth by per|mi&s;&s;ion of his Honour:&mdash;Excu&s;e him he is no Adopt in politicks.&mdash;But all this they have done, &s;ayeth this Writer, without &s;o much as including the &s;imple <HI>Menoni&s;ts,</HI> from whom they have ex|torted large Sums of Money, to &s;upport their Ex|pence. (The meaning of the Word Extort is this) to exact Illequally, or get, or take violently and by unju&s;tificable Means, to abu&s;e Authority) this mu&s;t be a fal&s;e A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Let the <HI>Menoni&s;ts</HI> An&s;wer for them&s;elves. But the Truth is, that the <HI>Menoni&s;ts,</HI> as a Society of good Religious people, by way of Simele col|lected Money and de&s;ired the Quakers to hand it to the then &s;uffering people on the Frontiers, to &s;erve their Nece&s;&s;ities. Is this extortion in the Qua|kers? I leave the Candid Reader to judge. Or doth it &s;hew the <HI>Menoni&s;t</HI> to be a &s;imple people? No; it's evident that the <HI>Menoni&s;ts,</HI> were a com|pa&s;&s;ionate people, not regardle&s;s of their fellow Creatures &s;ufferings, and willing to contribute to|wards their Support, (ob&s;erve) here is a po&s;&s;itive A&s;&s;ertion, when he &s;ayeth&mdash;<Q>Nay with the mo&s;t matchle&s;s impudence, In&s;inuated to the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they were Rulers and Governors.</Q> (Well let us hear his proop:) As plainly appeared, at the late Treaty at <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> where the principal Chief <Q>and Speaker told Mr. <HI>H &mdash; n,</HI> then Governor, that as he under&s;tood there were two Governors in the province, he would be glad to know which he was to Treat with.</Q> In Ca&s;e

<HI>this writer &s;peaks the Truth,) here is not &s;o much as a &s;ingle</HI> Indians <HI>Affirmative, to prove the A&s;&s;ertion; no not any Evidence at all.</HI> <Q>Again the <HI>Indians</HI> were induced to look upon <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as the fir&s;t Man, or Chief <HI>Cechim</HI> of the Province (why &s;o, becau&s;e they &s;ay his Haughtine&s;s and the Contempt with which he treated his fellow Subjects;</Q>&mdash;<HI>then I conclude, our Author mu&s;t be of Opinion, that this has been a &s;tand|ing Rule with our Governors,</HI> (viz.) <HI>Haughtine&s;s and Contempt&mdash; by which the</HI> Indians <HI>hath known them. (He ju&s;t now &s;aid Mr.</HI> H. &mdash; n. <HI>was a</HI> Quaker, <HI>and now calls him &s;omething el&s;e fie upon &s;uch a fellow) he mu&s;t have had a high Opinion of the</HI> Indians <HI>judg|ment, or he would not have made it the chief Ba&s;es of his Argument, and by this means of fal&s;e Rea&s;on|ing, unju&s;tly blam'd the</HI> Quakers. <HI>Here I &s;hall take &s;ome notice of his Note in Page the</HI> 7th, <HI>where he &s;ayeth, one</HI> Patrick Ignew, <HI>of the Burrough of</HI> Lanca&s;ter, <HI>who upon Oath &s;ayed, that at the late Treaty at</HI> Lanca&s;ter, <HI>he was commanded to make Proclamation by the Governor, to forbid any Per&s;on to either &s;ell, or give, Spiritious Liquors to the</HI> Indians; <HI>and when he proclaimed, and &s;aid by order of the Governour, the Infamous</HI> Tediuskung, <HI>as be is called, in Page the</HI> 4th. <HI>Cryed out, D&mdash;n your G&mdash;nr, D &mdash; n your G &mdash;r.

that any quantity might be too much, there|fore forbid the u&s;e of it intirely. Well but they were privately entertained at a Tavern in the Town: I ask with what? Here this writer is Silent. Now if he would but comply with one word, in the front of his Letter (Truth) and tell us it was no other then with the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, he would then give the Peoples Actions a genuine Connection with the Governor's Proclimation; for the &s;aid Deponent doth not Charge the</HI> Quakers <HI>or any one of them, with the lea&s;t Mi&s;|conduct; neither is there one word of Spiritious Li|quors in the whole Affadavit, nor the Name</HI> Quaker <HI>mentioned: And as to the re&s;t of the Affadavits, I think they are not worth a &s;olled Man's notice. I think they were all trumpt up, &s;ince the</HI> Indians <HI>were Murdered, to glo&s;s over that horred act. Was the like ever known before? For a &s;et of Men in Con&s;piracy together, to fall upon and Murder a number of their Neighbours, and then ran&s;ack the Earth, to find E|vidence to prove that they were dangerous Neighbours; and that they had received but their de&s;erts. This is a very odd Affair, fir&s;t to kill a Man, then to pa&s;s Sentence on him, and after all that to produce the E|vidence again&s;t him: Surely tho&s;e People, that were in danger of the</HI> Indians, <HI>mu&s;t be very careful to keep the Magi&s;trates in Ignorance of their Dangers; or the Magi&s;trates had but little regard to their Neighbours &s;afety: For it &s;eems this Writer has traced Time back towards</HI> Noah's <HI>Flood; nay quite as far as Governour</HI> Keith's <HI>Admini&s;tration to produce Evidence again&s;t dead</HI> Indians. <HI>Page the</HI> 8th. <HI>here is another Paragraft, that plainly di&s;covers their De&s;ign of overturning the</HI>

This writer Caluminates the Qua|kers, when it is &s;ome of his own Kidny, that has been the hateful Agre&s;&s;ors. Did not a Colony from <HI>New-England</HI> &s;ettle on Lands, unpurcha&s;ed of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in Contempt of Government and contrary to all Rules of Equity? And did not his Honour, the Governor I&s;&s;ue out &s;everal Proclamations, and forbid all his Maje&s;ty's Subjects to act in &s;uch a pre|fidious Manner; warning them to turn off the Lands, under the &s;evere&s;t Penalties? And did not the <HI>Indians</HI> declare to them, that the Lands were theirs, and if they did not turn of their Land, they would cer|tainly drive them off, or kill them on the &s;pot? And did they not &s;tay there in &s;pite of all this, un|till the <HI>Indians</HI> Scalp'd &s;ome of them? (Where tho&s;e Quakers, I an&s;wer no) I believe they were <HI>Pre&s;|byterians:</HI>

Was it not <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> that Murdered the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Lanca&s;ter?</HI> Was it not <HI>Pre&s;byterians,</HI> that came down with an intent, to murder the <HI>Indians</HI> in the <HI>Barraks?</HI> Was not the Author of the <HI>Quaker Unmask'd</HI> one of their e&s;teemed Mini&s;ters? And was not the Author of this prepo&s;terious Letter, the &s;ame Man, or one of his ba&s;e Brethren? In fine, I think the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> have been the Authors, and Abettors, of all the Mi&s;chief, that's happened to us, as a People. Did we ever read or hear tell of a Quaker, being guilty of any one of the above Villanous acts? I &s;ay no. But if any pretended Member of their Society had been found guilty of any one of them, they would have di&s;own'd him in ten Minutes: But the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> do all this with impunity; And who but their Mini&s;ters be|comes their Advocates?

The Inhabitants of this Province, and under this Government, are a body Corporate, which body compo&s;es a Society in civil Govern|ment;
<PB N="11" REF="009580_0011_0F76DDD0DA23D560">
and every Loyal Per&s;on, a real Member of that Society. Thus we are bound together by U|naminity and Concord, under the &s;anction of Laws, to &s;upport our civil and Religious Rights in Go|vernment: And we are not to be di&s;turbed in this happy Situation, but by a failure in one, or more of the Members; and this appears in every Per&s;on, that acts contrary to the &s;y&s;tem of Laws, by which this body Corporate is formed into a Society. The Word, factious, declares for me, that tho&s;e People, whom this Writer &s;o much extoles, are the very Men, whom he &s;o horridly exclaims a|gain&s;t. See the word (factious) ie. Quarrel&s;ome, Riotous, Rebellious, di&s;atisfied with the publick E&s;tabli&s;hment; here it wants of Policy with a Wit|ne&s;s to it: But I have &s;o much Charity for the Let|ter Writer, as to think, if he has at any Time met with &s;ome of the&s;e, &s;hola&s;tick Words, that he has made u&s;e of, in his common News-paper, the prin|ter has been &s;o ungenerous, as not to give him the Meaning of one half of them. Let the Blame lye there. Well but is this agreeable to his Title Page? Impartially repre&s;ented? I think its the neare&s;t that of any Branch of his Di&s;cour&s;e I have met with; he has been exclaiming again&s;t the Government; he has been exclaiming again&s;t the <HI>Quakers;</HI> and now he exclaims again&s;t the <HI>Pre&s;byterians.</HI></P>
<P>There is no one thing appears clearer, then that the <HI>Quakers</HI> are blam'd without a Cau&s;e. Is the Go|vernor a Quaker? Is his Council Quakers? Is the Majority of the A&s;&s;embly Quakers? I an&s;wer in the negative. Well, they are the Men, that all Acts of State are determined by; then pray what are
<PB N="12" REF="009580_0012_0F76DDD196D06888">
they blam'd for? why, becau&s;e they a&s;&s;i&s;ted their hone&s;t Neighbours to &s;ave the <HI>Indians</HI> from a horrid Ma&s;&s;acre: And this is every Thing I find again&s;t them, when I have canvas'd the whole Af|fair, in the minuete&s;t Manner, I am capable of. Did not the Governor reque&s;t all the Freeholders in the City, to meet him at the State-Hou&s;e? Was not this with the Approbation of his Council? And did not the Governor and A&s;&s;embly pa&s;s an Act again&s;t Riots and Rioters? All this was done on the Ap|proach of the <HI>Paxton Rebels:</HI> And without the aid of the Quakers. Now I conclude, this none-Poli|tition has in the fir&s;t Place to prove, that for one Man to endeavour to &s;ave the Life and Fortune of another, is an unju&s;tifiable Act; <HI>Secondly,</HI> the whole Si&s;tom, or Body of Laws, which &s;upport civil So|ciety, and bindeth the Body corporate, as with Chains of Iron, to be a mere Fandom or u&s;ele&s;s Ce|remony: Nay it &s;trikes at the very A&s;&s;ence of tho&s;e Laws; I mean the Laws of God: For why did the great and wi&s;e Legi&s;lature form tho&s;e Laws, but for the Regulation and well being of Mankind. I &s;ay he mu&s;t fir&s;t prove the above&s;aid Po&s;&s;itions, or he cannot prove the <HI>Quakers</HI> worthy of any Blame. If this is not the mo&s;t palbable E&s;&s;ay towards the intire Demolition of all good Government, I know not what is. Well my Countrymen, by this Time you &s;ee, in what a &s;ophi&s;tical Manner, this Author hath wrote: He meaneth one then, and &s;peaketh another; he &s;pitts his Spite at you our Superiors, who&s;e Title I have ju&s;t mentioned, under the Similitude of <HI>Qua|kers;</HI> but how you will put up with &s;uch glarring impudence, I don't undertake to determine.</P>

Whoever will take the trouble to read the printed Tryals of <HI>George Keith,</HI> will find, that when a <HI>Quaker Sloop</HI> belong|ing to this province, was formerly taken by &s;ome pirates; and finding it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave both the Sloop and their &s;o much cried up principles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Oppo&s;ed Force to Force, retook their Ve&s;&s;el: This parragraph contains both None&s;en&s;e and Con|tradiction <HI>i. e.</HI> A <HI>Quaker Sloop,</HI> what can he mean by that? Doth he call the Sloop a Quaker, or doth he &s;uppo&s;e the Owner was a Quaker? Well, but he doth not tell us, whether the Mariners were Qua|kers or what they were. But thats not all, for he &s;ayeth the Sloop was taken; (ob&s;erve) and after it was taken, (here is the Cunning) they found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave it (I believe &s;o), And their &s;o much cryed up principles again&s;t outward Force. Now I ask this Writer, how it was po&s;&s;ible for the Captain of that Sloop to deliver up his &s;ole Right of that to the pirate?

If</HI> George Fox <HI>made u&s;e of any of tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, which this Writer has, they are pick'd words, and a Connection given them as they now &s;tand to &s;erve the Purpo&s;e of &s;ome envious Apo&s;tate, of whom there were &s;everal that run into &s;uch Extravagances, or took &s;uch undue Li|berties, that the Rules in the Society could not di&s;pen&s;e with; then they te&s;tified again&s;t them, and tho&s;e Men being of the like Spirit with our Author, thought the wor&s;t they could &s;ay or write, was hardly enough to be|&s;patter them, and their innocent Principles.

make u&s;e of any of the above Expre&s;&s;ions to <HI>Cromwel</HI> or his Army (though I find nothing like it in any of his Writings) for I conceive the <HI>Quakers</HI> Principles took place by degrees. They fir&s;t &s;aw one thing wrong and then another: And by acting accord|ing to what they &s;aw to be their Duty, they at length became acquainted with every Part that con&s;tituted, a &s;ound religious Society of People. And among&s;t the many that joined them, there was &s;ome of the Soldiery part; and tho&s;e were Men of good Car|racters, they were zealous for what they thought right, and &s;ome were convinced inpart of the Quakers Principles: But for a Time did not &s;ee, its their Duty to lay down their Arms, but &s;tood as valiant Soldiers for their Lives and Liberties. That was the Ca&s;e with <HI>George Bi&s;hop,</HI> whome this Writer mentions, he was a Captain in the Parliament Ar|my: And in that Station manife&s;ted his Loyalty to the be&s;t of his Knowledge to detect and &s;uppre&s;s every thing that might ob&s;truct thee, then hope for peaceable Government. But this was before he became e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Quakers Principles, he afterwards laid down his Sword, enter'd into Community with them, and became as faithful a Warrior for his God as he had been a Soldier in the Parliaments Army. And was Author of a Book <HI>entituled, New-England Judged.</HI> In which he has &s;et forth the Cruelty and Barbarity of this Authors Brethren, while they had the Reins of Govern|ment in their Hands.&mdash;I would advi&s;e him to get one of tho&s;e Books, and read it through with good Attention, I believe it might be of more Ser|vice to him, then his News-Papers.

They asked me, if I would not take up Arms for the common Wealth again&s;t <HI>Charles Steuart:</HI> I told them, I knew from whence all Wars did ari&s;e, even from the Lu&s;ts according to <HI>James's</HI> his Doctrine. And that I lived in the Virtue of that Life and Power that took away the Occa&s;ion of all Wars, but they courted me to except of their offer, and thought I did but Complement with them: But I told them I was come into the Covenant of Peace, which was before Wars and Strifes were, they &s;aid they offered it in Love and Kindne&s;s to me, becau&s;e of my virtue, and &s;uch like flattering Words they u&s;ed.

The Reader may &s;ee I have run over the whole, and here and there made a Remark: But in Truth, they are but &s;lightly touch, if Life and Health Permitted: I could write a Volume upon it, &s;hewing the Authors Envy and Folly; in &s;uch a Manner that it would di&s;grace him to all Intents and Purpo&s;es: However, I am &s;pared, that Pains, for his own Work, will come nearly to the &s;ame thing; I &s;ay as I was in&s;pecting into the Charges again&s;t the Quakers, I found my&s;elf, as I thought under a Nece&s;&s;ity to mention &s;ome Facts again&s;t the Presbyterians, that the impartial Reader may judge as he finds Things &s;tand in an obvious Man|ner either for one or the other of the two Societies: And that he may be the better enabled to de|termine upon the Whole, and judge for him&s;elf, which Societies Members may be the fite&s;t for
<PB N="28" REF="009580_0028_0F76DDE0C8E2EAE8">
<HI>Repre&s;entatives of the Peoples Lives and Fortunes, the fite&s;t for Magi&s;trates to judge impartially between a Man and his Neighbour, the fite&s;t for A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to value Men's Goods and Chattles without Malice or Favour, the fite&s;t for Collectors of Taxes and A&s;&s;izes, where a Man ought to do by his Neighbour as he would have his Neighbour do by him; in &s;hort, whether an hone&s;t Man would rather have a Quaker or a Presbyterian for his Neighbour. I &s;hall conclude with a &s;hort Addre&s;s, (but with a great deal of &s;encerity) to doom Bur&mdash;on and his Ulceration Presbyterians, de&s;iring the next Day, they dedicate to Liberty and St. Patrick; and at the end of their Chorus, he will make a Proclamation, as with the &s;ound of a Ram's-Horn, begging and intreating tho&s;e that mur|dered the Indians, to &s;urrender them&s;elves up to Ju&s;tice: Pray their Neighbours to take warning by them, confe&s;&s;ing his hearty &s;orrow for his being the Author or Abetter of &s;uch a horrid Crime, promi&s;ing in the mo&s;t &s;ollid Manner that he will never protitute his Pen to &s;uch villianous Pur+po&s;es more; pray that the Quakers will forgive, and pa&s;s by, acknowledging that he wrote by no other Motion than the Spirit of Lucifer, and declare that his Will and Plea&s;ure is; that who&s;oever has this &s;purious Letter, that he will commit it to the Flames. Amen.</HI> <Q>And then we may expect to feel the happy Effects re&s;ulting from Li|berty and Law; to &s;ee the Quiet of the Province re&s;tored, and Harmony and good order of Govern|ment re-e&s;tabli&s;hed among us.</Q></P>
