<P>_THE GOSPEL is a rich and &s;acred Trea&s;ure, containing the glad Tidings of Salvation to &s;inful Men, and wi&s;ely adapted to promote their &s;piritual and eternal Intere&s;ts. St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, <HI>It is the Power of God unto Salvation, to every one that believeth, to the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o to the Greek,</HI> Rom i. 16.</P>
<P>To preach this Go&s;pel, is one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t important Tru&s;ts that ever was committed unto Men: And, to do it faithfully, &s;o as to plea&s;e, and be approved of, the Heart-&s;earching GOD, is no ea&s;y Ta&s;k. The Difficulties that attend this Work, and the many Temp|tations to Unfaithfulne&s;s in it, render the Performance of it uncommonly hard, and require &s;uperior Mea&s;ures both of Gifts, and Grace. In both the&s;e Re&s;pects, the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> of our Lord were eminently qualified for this

Office, being <HI>endued with Power from on high:</HI> And <HI>in nothing</HI> did the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> come <HI>behind the very chiefe&s;t of them:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 11.</NOTE> But the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD, <HI>which was be&s;towed on him,</HI> for this <HI>Purpo&s;e, was not in vain; but he laboured more abundantly than they all</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 10.</NOTE>, and was very &s;ucce&s;sful, <HI>cheifly</HI> among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> to whom in &s;pecial he was &s;ent: <HI>For he that wrought effectually in</HI> Peter <HI>to the Apo&s;tle&s;hip of the Circumci&s;ion, the &s;ame, &s;ays he, was mighty in me towards the Gentiles.</HI> Gal. ii. 8.</P>
<P>As to the extraordinary Efficacy and Succe&s;s of his Mini&s;try, in particular, among the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> he takes a thankful Notice hereof, in this his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle &s;o them, wherein he joins <HI>Silvanus</HI> or <HI>Silas,</HI> and <HI>Timotheus,</HI> his Com|panions and Fellow-Labourers, with him&s;elf. <HI>For our Go&s;pel,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>came not unto you in the Word only, but al&s;o in Power and in the Holy-Gho&s;t, and in much A&s;&s;urance; as ye know what manner of Men we were among you for your Sake. And ye became Followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the Word in much Affliction, with Joy of the Holy-Gho&s;t; &s;o that ye were En&s;amples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</HI> Chap. i. ver. 5, 6, 7. For the Truth hereof he appeals unto them, Cap. ii. v. 1. <HI>For your&s;elves, Brethren, know our Entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain.</HI></P>
<P>And, as a &s;ubordinate Rea&s;on of the Go&s;pel's being &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful among them, he goes on to remind them, with what Fortitude and Zeal, Purity and Sincerity, it was preached unto them, ver. 2, 3. <HI>But even after that we had &s;uffered before, and were &s;hamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to &s;peak unto you the Go&s;pel of God with much Contention.

<P>Here then I am to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>That the Go&s;pel is committed in Tru&s;t unto the Mini&s;ters of it.</HI></P>
<P>Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are a particular Order of Men, in the Chri&s;tian Church, appointed by Chri&s;t, to officiate in his Name and Stead, as <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> in it. They are mentioned as the precious Gifts of Chri&s;t, which he be|&s;towed on his Church, for their &s;piritual Benefit, when he left this World, and a&s;cended to the FATHER, Eph. iv. 8, 12, 13. <HI>When he a&s;cended up on high, he led Captivity captive, and gave Gifts unto Men.&mdash;And he gave &s;ome, Apo|&s;tles; and &s;ome, Prophets; and &s;ome, Evangeli&s;ts; and &s;ome, Pa&s;tors and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Mini&s;try, for the Edifying of the Body of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007425_0004_102D84E80CC38460">The&s;e Mini&s;ters, whether <HI>exraordinary,</HI> as <HI>Apo&s;tles, Pro|phets</HI> and <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> or <HI>ordinary,</HI> as <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> were <HI>ex Officio,</HI> intru&s;ted with the Go&s;pel. <HI>But as we were allowed of God to be put in Tru&s;t with the Go&s;pel,</HI> &s;ays St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in the Text, &s;peaking of him&s;elf and his Fellow-Labourers.

<P>In all which Re&s;pects, the Go&s;pel may be con&s;idered as a &s;acred Charge, &s;pecially <HI>committed in Tru&s;t</HI> unto the Mini&s;ters of it.</P>
<P>I proceed to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>What is implied in being allowed of God to be put in Tru&s;t with the Go&s;pel?</HI></P>
<P>This Phra&s;e, I apprehend, implies &s;omething more than barely a Permi&s;&s;ion, even an Approbation of Per&s;ons for, and Appointment of them, unto the <HI>Mini&s;terial-Office.</HI>&mdash; That St. <HI>Paul</HI> and his <HI>Fellow-Labourers,</HI> of whom the Text particularly &s;peaks, were approved of GOD, as Per&s;ons duly qualified for and authorized to the Work of the Mini&s;try, which they employed them&s;elves in. And con&s;idered in Relation to Mini&s;ters, <HI>in general,</HI> it may denote the &s;ame Thing. So then, in order to Mini&s;ters being <HI>allowed of God to be put in Tru&s;t with the Go&s;pel,</HI> they mu&s;t be &s;uitably qualified for, and authorized, or &s;olemly &s;eparated unto the Work of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They mu&s;t be &s;uitably qualified for this Work.</HI> In Order to which, it is requi&s;ite,</P>
<P N="1">1. That they be Men of <HI>&s;incere Piety: Sanctified in Chri&s;t Je&s;us&mdash;and prepared unto every good Work.</HI> This is as nece&s;|&s;ary for Mini&s;ters, as for others, in order to their being true <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and in a State of <HI>Favour</HI> and <HI>Acceptance</HI> with GOD. And if it be not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>Being</HI> of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, it is of very great Importance in the <HI>Mini&s;terial-Office,</HI> and requi&s;ite to a right and faithful Di&s;|charge of it. Surely tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;pecial Bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to mini&s;ter in holy Things <HI>in the Hou&s;e of God, which is the Church of the living God,</HI> &s;hould be holy them&s;elves.

And not only true Grace and Holine&s;s, but eminent Degrees thereof, are requi&s;ite to their being <HI>well-fini&s;hed</HI> for &s;o great and im|portant a Tru&s;t. They &s;hould not be <HI>Babes,</HI> or <HI>Novices,</HI> in Religion, but <HI>&s;trong in Faith,</HI> and in the <HI>Grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> Of &s;uch <HI>Age</HI> and Attainments in the &s;piritual Life, as <HI>by Rea&s;on of U&s;e,</HI> to <HI>have their &s;piritual Sen&s;es exer|ci&s;ed to di&s;cern both Good and Evil.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> v. 14,</NOTE></P>
<P>Not that I think the Efficacy and Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel depends upon the internal Sanctity of the Di&s;pen&s;ers of it, but upon the Power of GOD accompanying it. 1 Cor. iii. 7. <HI>So then, neither is he that planteth any Thing, nor he that watereth: But God that giveth the Increa&s;e.</HI> Or, that GOD never &s;o far approves of the Admini&s;trations of un|&s;anctified Mini&s;ters, as to make them in&s;trumental of &s;aving Good to others. For, as it cannot be denied, that the &s;aving Truths revealed in the Go&s;pel, may be preached by them; &s;o, neither can it be proved to be incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> or any of the <HI>Perfections</HI> of GOD, to ble&s;s tho&s;e Truths, for &s;aving Good, to &s;uch as &s;incerely embrace them, tho' di&s;pen&s;ed by Mini|&s;ters of un&s;anctified Hearts.

<P N="3">3. That they be <HI>&s;ound</HI> and <HI>&s;tedfa&s;t in the Faith.</HI></P>
<P>It is certainly a Matter of great Importance, that Mini&s;ters be well-grounded in the Principles of Religion, and firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Belief of tho&s;e great and weighty Truths of Divine Revelation, which they are to preach to others: How <HI>el&s;e</HI> can they be qualified for this Tru&s;t? If they preach not <HI>the Truth as it is in Je&s;us,</HI> they are likely to de&s;troy, and not to confirm, the <HI>Faith once delivered to the Saints,</HI>&mdash; to ruin, and not to &s;ave the Souls of Men. Surely then, they &s;hould be <HI>&s;ound,</HI> and <HI>&s;tedfa&s;t in the Faith;</HI> holding fa&s;t the <HI>faithful Word,</HI> even, <HI>that Form of &s;ound Doctrine,</HI> which is delivered in the <HI>Holy Scriptures;</HI> and not erroneous, or fickle: Neither <HI>giving Heed to Fables,</HI> and tho&s;e Doctrines of Men, <HI>which turn from the Truth,</HI> nor &s;uffering them&s;elves, to be <HI>wheedled about with every Wind of Doctrine.</HI></P>

<P><PB REF="007425_0006_102D84EDCD8040C8">For they are, not only, to feed the <HI>Flock</HI> with &s;ound doctrine, good and whol&s;ome In&s;tructions, but al&s;o, to be En&s;amples unto them of all that is virtuous and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">able; going before them in the &s;teady Practice of that holy Religion, which they teach and inculcate, 1 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">m. iv. 12, <HI>But be thou an Example of the Believers, in Lord, in Conver&s;ation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity.</HI> And verily, no Man is qualified for the Mini&s;try, or fit to be employed in it, that is not of a blamele&s;s and good Behaviour: For a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s to yield him&s;elf the Servant of Sin,&mdash;an immoral Mini&s;ter,&mdash; one vi&s;ibly bad, yielding him&s;elf to unrighteous Practices and fle&s;hly Defilements,&mdash; is a meer Incon&s;i&s;tency and Ab&s;urdity!

Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t: Teaching them to ob&s;erve all Things what&s;oever I have commended you; and lo, I am with you, alway, even unto the End of the World.</HI> Amen. <HI>Mat.</HI> xxviii. 18, 19, 20. And them he &s;pecially qualified for this Tru&s;t, by conferring on them the <HI>extraordinary Gifts</HI> of the HOLY GHOST; and to them, and to the World, he gave abundant Te&s;timony of the Truth of their Mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>St. Paul</HI> al&s;o, was immediately called and &s;ent by Chri&s;t, to preach the Go&s;pel: Wherefore he &s;tiles him|&s;elf, <HI>Paul an Apo&s;tle, (not of Men, neither by Man, but by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and God the Father, who rai&s;ed him from the Dead,)</HI> Gal. i. 1. Neverthele&s;s, he was, by the &s;pecial Direction of the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;eparated unto the Work of the Mini&s;try, by the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers at Antioch;</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="007425_0007_102D84EF8ADCFD98">
to whom, <HI>as they mini&s;tred to the Lord, and fa&s;ted, the Holy Gho&s;t &s;aid, &s;eparate me</HI> Barnabas <HI>and</HI> Saul, <HI>for the Work whereunto I have called them. And when they had fa&s;ted and prayed, and laid their Hands on them, they &s;ent them away.</HI> Acts xiii. 2, 3. Hence, perhaps, it is, that he &s;tiles him|&s;elf, Rom. i. 1. <HI>Paul a Servant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, called to be an Apo&s;tle, &s;eparated unto the Go&s;pel of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>But we do not read of any, &s;ince the <HI>Apo&s;tolick. Age,</HI> that were immediately called and &s;ent by Chri&s;t, to preach the Go&s;pel: Nor has Chri&s;t, any where, intimated in his Word, that he would, in this Manner, &s;end forth his Mini&s;ters in Time to come. But he left it with his Apo&s;tles, under the In&s;piration of the HOLY GHOST, to &s;ettle the Order of the Churches, which they &s;hould gather, and found, in his Name, and to order <HI>Elders,</HI> or <HI>Pa&s;tors and Teachers,</HI> in them. And it is evident, that tho&s;e whom the Apo&s;tles cho&s;e, and &s;et apart to the Work of the Mini&s;try, had Authority likewi&s;e to ordain others to it; particularly, that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> had: To the former of which, <HI>St. Paul</HI> gave this expre&s;s Charge, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 1, 2. <HI>Thou therefore, my Son, be &s;trong in the Grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. And the Things that thou ha&s;t heard of me among many Witne&s;&s;es, the &s;ame commit thou to faithful Men, who &s;hall be able to teach others al&s;o:</HI> And to the latter he writes, <HI>Tit.</HI> i. 5. <HI>For this Cau&s;e left I thee in</HI> Crete, <HI>that thou &s;hould&s;t &s;et in Order the Things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City, as I had appointed thee.</HI> And this Power of Ordination, is (as it was doubtle&s;s de&s;igned to be) conveyed down in the Chri&s;tian Church; and tho&s;e who, according to Go&s;pel-Order, are called and &s;eparated to the Work of the Mini&s;try, may be &s;aid to be <HI>allowed of God to be put in Tru&s;t with the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P>And whatever Di&s;putes there have been and are, about the Right and Power of Ordination, and in who&s;e Hands it is lodged; yet that there is &s;uch a Power, &s;omewhere in the Chri&s;tian Church, is generally allowed: And &s;ince we

find no Examples in Scripture, of any being ordained to the Work of the Mini&s;try, but only by authorized Mi|ni&s;ters, nor any particular Directions given, relating hereunto, but only to &s;uch; we may, I think, &s;afely conclude, that the Power of Ordination, if it be not ab&s;olutely limited and confined to them, does yet in &s;ome &s;pecial and peculiar Manner belong unto them; and that however particular Churches may have a natural Right to elect their own <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> yet it is requi&s;ite, that they &s;hould be &s;olemnly &s;eparated to the <HI>Pa&s;toral Office</HI> over them, by the Pa&s;tors of other Churches invited thereunto, with Fa&s;ting and Prayer, and Impo&s;ition of Hands.</P>
<P>And as for tho&s;e who thru&s;t them&s;elves, or are thru&s;t by others, into the Work of the Mini&s;try, in a di&s;orderly Way and Manner, which the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> do not direct to, or countenance, they are, in my Opinion, to be look'd upon and treated not as true Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel; but as bold Intruders, the Authority of who&s;e Mi&s;&s;ion, and the Validity of who&s;e Admini&s;trations, want Proof.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t proceed to &s;how,</P>

<P><PB N="14" REF="007425_0008_102D84F14AE0B6B8">Now this evidently intends, that the Go&s;pel be preached by the Mini&s;ters of it, with a &s;pecial View, not to &s;ooth and gratify the vain Humours and Fancies of Men, or to court their Approbation and Applau&s;e, but to honour and plea&s;e GOD, and to gain his Approbation and Accep|tance: Otherwi&s;e the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> did, and every Mini&s;ter &s;hould, &s;eek to <HI>plea&s;e Men,</HI> for their Spiritual Good, by becoming <HI>all Things to all Men,</HI> as far as is allowable and con&s;i&s;tent with the faithful Di&s;charge of his Office; and endeavouring to <HI>plea&s;e all Men in all Things, not &s;eeking his own Profit, but the Profit of many that may &s;aved,</HI> 1 Cor. x. 33.</P>
