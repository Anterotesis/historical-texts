<P><HI>Of the</HI> CANYINGOES <HI>or</HI> MOHOCKS <HI>none came.</HI></P>
<P>By the Interpreter's Advice, they were fir&s;t &s;poke to in their own Way, with three &s;mall Strings of <HI>Wampum</HI> in Hand, one of which was delivered on each of the following Articles.</P>
<P><HI>Our Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>You are come a great way, and have doubtle&s;s &s;uffered many Hard&s;hips in &s;o long a Journey; but now you are with your Brethren and true Friends, who have long been in Friend&s;hip and Alliance with your Nations; you mu&s;t therefore put a|way all Grief and Unea&s;ine&s;s, and brighten your Eyes, that we may &s;ee and be chearful with each other.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>We de&s;ire that as we are now met as Brethren and Friends, you will open your Hearts, as we &s;hall open our Hearts, that we may &s;peak with Freedom and Openne&s;s to each other.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>You are come to us as your true Friends, we receive you with Gladne&s;s, you &s;hall &s;helter your&s;elves under our Covering, and be entertained by us as our&s;elves, for you are our Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>The Indians hereupon expre&s;&s;ed their Satisfaction with Sounds peculiar to them&s;elves on &s;uch Occa&s;ions; and then their Speaker with three like Strings in his Hand, repeated all tho&s;e three &s;everal Articles more at large, returning their Thanks for each, delivering a String as each Article was &s;poke to, and giving A&s;&s;urances of their Freedom and Openne&s;s, and de&s;i|ring that we would u&s;e the &s;ame; but on the 3d they &s;aid, <HI>They could not re|ceive and treat us as we did them, they are now with us, they give them&s;elves up to us, and depend on our Protection.</HI></P>
<P>Then with five more very &s;hort Strings in his Hand, the Speaker pro|ceeded to &s;ay on the fir&s;t, <HI>That they had received on the Road a Me&s;&s;age from as delivered by</HI> Conrad Wy&s;er, <HI>welcoming them into the Country.</HI> On the 2d, <HI>That they had at the &s;ame time received from us an Account of our late Gover|nor's Death, but that this would not occa&s;ion any Alteration, becau&s;e</HI> W. PENN'S <HI>own Son is here, and al&s;o</HI> James Logan, <HI>with the Council.</HI> On the 3d They returned their Thanks, and with the other two confirm'd the whole.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, <HI>They were now come, after a full Con&s;ultation with all their Chiefs at their great Fire or Place of Coun&s;el, to return an An&s;wer to the Treaty, that &s;ome of them had held with us four Years &s;ince, at</HI> Philadelphia: <HI>That they intended to &s;tay with their Friend</HI> James Logan <HI>two Nights to re&s;t them&s;elves, and then proceed to the Fire kept for them at</HI> Philadelphia; <HI>where after two Nights more, they would at that Fire give their full An&s;wer.</HI></P>
<P>They were told, <HI>We were willing to keep them here in the Country the longer, becau&s;e many People in</HI> Philadelphia <HI>had been &s;ickly, and now the</HI> Small Pox <HI>are there, a Di&s;ea&s;e that has often proved fatal to the Indians; that it would be a</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="004146_0004_1003DC2CD3473DE0"><HI>great Trouble to us to &s;ee any of them taken with that Di&s;temper, after they had travelled &s;o far to vi&s;it us; for we are very de&s;irous they &s;hould all return &s;afe, and as healthy as they came to us: That it is proper they &s;hould give their An&s;wer at</HI> Philadelphia, <HI>in the &s;ame publick Manner we had la&s;t treated with them; but it is advi&s;eable they &s;hould &s;pend no more of their time in the Town, than will be ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, for many Inconveniences may attend it.</HI></P>
<P>They appeared concerned at this, thanked us, and &s;aid they would go to|gether by them&s;elves to advi&s;e on it.</P>

<P>The Gentlemen of the Council having gone home la&s;t night to <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI> and only the Proprietor &s;taying, Mr <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> with &s;ome others came a|gain to day; and the <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs after they had con&s;ulted this Morning a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, meeting the Proprietor, &amp;c. in Council, &s;aid,</P>
<P><HI>That they were much obliged to us for the Care we took of them; we &s;hewed by it our true Friend&s;hip for them. That as they are now with us, they put them+&s;elves wholly under our Direction, and tho'</HI> Philadelphia <HI>is the Place where their Fire is kept for them, yet it may upon Occa&s;ion be brought out hither; and they are free either to proceed to</HI> Philadelphia <HI>to treat at the Fire there, or to &s;tay here, as we &s;hall think fit to order it.</HI></P>
<P>They were told, <HI>As the la&s;t Treaty with them was held in Publick at</HI> Phila|delphia, <HI>it would be nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould there give their An&s;wer; That we were not wholly again&s;t their going to Town, but thought our&s;elves obliged to acquaint them with the Danger; yet that this is not at pre&s;ent &s;o great that it &s;hould wholly prevent their going. The Di&s;temper is as yet but young and ju&s;t begun in the Place; that it is only in the Heart or near the Middle of the Town; that they will be accommodated at the Edge or Out-Skirts of the Town, where if they take Care, they may for a few Days be in but very little or no Danger.</HI></P>
<P>They then re&s;olved to &s;et out for <HI>Philadelphia</HI> the next Day; and accord|ingly having been entertained at <HI>Stenton</HI> three Nights, they went to Town on the la&s;t of <HI>September;</HI> and having re&s;ted the fir&s;t of <HI>October,</HI> on the &s;econd Day they met as follows.</P>

Pre&s;ent al&s;o The <HI>MAYOR</HI> and <HI>Recorder</HI> of the City, With divers Gentlemen, and a very large Audience that filled the Hou&s;e and its Galleries.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs being come and &s;eated,</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident, before proceeding to hear them, thought proper to inform the Audience, that in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1732, a great Treaty having been held in this Place with &s;everal Chiefs of the Six Nations, they had made report thereof on their Return to their Great Council, where the &s;everal Propo&s;i|tions that had been made to them on the Part of this Government, had been fully con&s;idered; and that the&s;e Chiefs now pre&s;ent, of whom there never at any time before had been &s;o great a Number met in this Province, were now come to return their An&s;wer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> being made acquainted with what the Pre&s;ident had &s;aid, were told, that we were ready to hear them.</P>
<P>Whereupon <HI>Kanickhungo</HI> their Speaker, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to their Bro|ther <HI>ONAS</HI> (which &s;ignifies <HI>PENN</HI>) to their Brother <HI>JAMES LO|GAN,</HI> and the Gentlemen of the Council, &s;poke as follows by <HI>Conrad Wy|&s;er</HI> the Interpreter;</P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>WE are now come down from the Towns of our &s;everal Nations, to give our An&s;wer to the great Treaty, which we and you held together, at this Place, about four Years &s;ince: This An|&s;wer has been agreed and concluded upon by our great Council, who have carefully con&s;idered all that pa&s;&s;ed between you and us, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed their great Satisfaction in the friendly and good Di&s;po&s;itions of you our Brethren, towards all the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations;</HI> and as you received us kindly, and at that Treaty undertook to provide and keep for us a Fire in this great City, we are now come to warm our&s;elves thereat, and we de&s;ire and hope it will ever continue bright and burning to the End of the World.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Hereupon be laid down a large Belt of white</HI> Wampum <HI>of eleven Rows, with four black St.</HI> George's <HI>Cro&s;&s;es in it; and proceeding, &s;aid</HI></P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>SOON after our Brother <HI>ONAS,</HI> who is now here, came into this Country, he and we treated together; he opened and cleared the Road between this Place and our Nations, which was very much to our good Liking, and it gave us great Plea&s;ure. We now de&s;ire that this Road, for the mutual Accommodation and Conveniency of you and us who Travel therein to &s;ee each other, may be kept clear and open, free from all Stops or Incumbrances, and if, &s;ince the time that we la&s;t cleared it with you, any Tree has fallen acro&s;s it, or if it is any way &s;topt up, of which however we know nothing, we are now willing to open and clear the &s;ame from every Interruption; and it is our hearty De&s;ire that it may &s;o continue, while the Earth endureth.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Hereupon he pre&s;ented a Bundle of Skins in the Hair, and went on;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004146_0006_1003DC3D5E917080">
<HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>ONE of the chief Articles of our late Treaty together, was the brightning of the Chain of Friend&s;hip between us, and the pre&s;erving it free from all Ru&s;t and Spots; and that this Chain was not only be|tween this Government and us, but between all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Govern|ments and all the <HI>Indians.</HI> We now a&s;&s;ure you our Brethren, that it is our earne&s;t De&s;ire this Chain &s;hould continue, and be &s;trengthned be|tween all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and all our Nations, and likewi&s;e the <HI>Delawares, Canays,</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> living on <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> and all the other <HI>Indi|ans</HI> who now are in League and Friend&s;hip with the <HI>Six Nations;</HI> in Be|half of all whom, and as a la&s;ting Confirmation of this great Article, to endure until this Earth pa&s;&s;eth away and is no more &s;een, we now de|liver you this Beaver Coat.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Here he laid down a large Beaver Coat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Proprietor gave them Thanks in Behalf of this Government for what they had &s;poke touching the&s;e three important Articles of the Fire, Road and Chain of Friend&s;hip, and told them their Di&s;cour&s;e thereon was very &s;atisfactory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Speaker proceeded and &s;aid;</HI></P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>TO conclude all that we have now &s;aid, it is our De&s;ire that we and you &s;hould be as of one Heart, one Mind, and one Body, thus be|coming one People, entertaining a mutual Love and Regard for each other, to be pre&s;erved firm and entire, not only between you and us, but between your Children, and our Children, to all &s;ucceeding Ge|nerations.</P>
<P>We who are now here, are old Men, who have the Direction of Affairs in our own Nations; and as we are old, it may be thought that the Me|mory of the&s;e things may be lo&s;t with us, who have not, like you, the Art of pre&s;erving it by committing all Tran&s;actions to Writing: We ne|verthele&s;s have Methods of tran&s;mitting from Father to Son, an Ac|count of all the&s;e Things, whereby you will find the Remembrance of them is faithfully pre&s;erved, and our &s;ucceeding Generations are made acquainted with what has pa&s;&s;ed, that it may not be forgot as long as the Earth remains.</P></Q>
<P>They were told, <HI>That it was very agreeable to us to know that they took &s;uch effectual Care in this Point.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then proceeding he &s;aid;</HI></P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>;WE de&s;ire that this brightning of the Chain, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;trong and firm League of Friend&s;hip, may be under&s;tood by you, as we under&s;tand it to be, not only between the Chiefs of our Nations, and the Chiefs or Principal Men of this Government, but likewi&s;e between all our People, and all your People, and between you and all our <HI>Warriours</HI> who go abroad and &s;ometimes pa&s;s near this Government, to all of whom we have given the &s;tricte&s;t Charge to behave them&s;elves agreeable to the
<PB N="8" REF="004146_0007_1003DC48865B2AB0">Friend&s;hip which is e&s;tabli&s;hed between you and us, that &s;o we all may continue to be one People for ever.</P>
<P>At the la&s;t Treaty you advi&s;ed us to &s;trengthen our&s;elves by entring into firm Leagues of Friend&s;hip and Alliance with &s;everal other Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> around us; this Advice was truly good, and we thank our Brethren for it; we have accordingly treated with the&s;e Six following Nations, <HI>to wit,</HI> the <HI>Onichkaryagoes, Si&s;&s;aghces, Tioumitihagas, Attawanten's, Twechtwe&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Oachtamaghs,</HI> and have engaged them &s;o heartily in our Intere&s;t, that they acknowledge us for their Elder Brethren, and have promi&s;ed to join with us as one People, and to act altogether in Concert with us.</P>
<P>You likewi&s;e then advi&s;ed us to call home all tho&s;e of our Nations who are at <HI>Canada,</HI> or live among&s;t the <HI>French,</HI> le&s;t if any Occa&s;ion of Difference &s;hould ari&s;e, they might then be prevented from returning. We e&s;teem this likewi&s;e as &s;ound good Advice, and we thank our Brethren for it; the <HI>French</HI> were formerly our cruel Enemies, and we are taking &s;uch Mea&s;ures as we hope will be effectual to bring back our People, if any new Breach &s;hould happen.</P></Q>
<P><HI>The Speaker &s;aid,</HI></P>
<Q><P>To confirm all that we have now &s;aid, we would be glad if we had a large Pre&s;ent of Skins to deliver, in Return to the con&s;iderable one in Goods which we had of you; but we mu&s;t own to you that we are at pre&s;ent but very ill provided and poor, and have only a very &s;mall Quantity of Skins, which neverthele&s;s we hope our Brethren will accept.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Here he laid down two &s;mall Bundles of Skins.</HI></P>
<Q><P>We have now nothing more to &s;ay in Publick; but having other Matters to treat on with the Proprietor, we will enter upon them at another time.</P></Q>
<P>They were told, <HI>That the Proprietor, Pre&s;ident and Council thank'd them very kindly in Behalf of this Government, for all they had now &s;aid; that they had returned full and di&s;tinct An&s;wers to all the Chief Articles or Propo&s;itions made at the la&s;t great Treaty in</HI> 1732, <HI>they had &s;poke to each of them like hone&s;t Men and true Brethren; and as they had con&s;ulted together before they delivered their An&s;wer, &s;o now the Council would meet and con&s;ider together of all that had pa&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>Which being interpreted to them, they expre&s;&s;ed their Satisfaction by a Sound peculiar to them, in which they all joined, and then withdrew.</P>

<P>The Pre&s;ident informed the Board, that agreeable to the Minute of the 4th, Care had been taken to provide Goods for the Indians: But next Day, after Council, con&s;ulting with <HI>Conrad Wey&s;er,</HI> the Interpreter, he had advi&s;ed that the Delivery of the Pre&s;ent &s;hould be delayed till the <HI>Indians</HI> had fini&s;hed with the Proprietary, with whom they were then to treat about the Purcha&s;e of Lands; that mo&s;t of la&s;t Week being &s;pent there|in, the <HI>Indians</HI> had Ye&s;terday ended with the Proprietary, having &s;igned Relea&s;es to him for all the Lands lying between the Mouth of <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> and <HI>Kekachtaninius</HI> Hills, and that it now remained to conclude on the Quantity and Quality of the &s;everal Goods to be given them; and on the Sub&s;tance of what &s;hould be proper to be &s;poke to them; The Board are of Opinion, that con&s;idering the large Quantity of Goods which they have had from the Proprietor on the Purcha&s;e, it may not at this time be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give them, in Behalf of this Government, &s;o great a Pre&s;ent as the Value ordered by the afore&s;aid Minute; but that it may very well be con&s;iderably reduced; and accordingly, it is <HI>Ordered,</HI> that it be reduced to between <HI>Sixty</HI> and <HI>Seventy Pounds.</HI></P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident likewi&s;e acquainting the Board, that the <HI>Indians,</HI> at a Meeting with the Proprietor and him, had taken Notice that <HI>Conrad Wey|&s;er,</HI> and <HI>Shekallamy,</HI> were by the Treaty of 1732, appointed as fit and pro|per Per&s;ons to go between the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and this Government, and to be employed in all Tran&s;actions with one another, who&s;e Bodies the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aid were to be equally divided between them and us, we to have one half, and they the other; that they had found <HI>Conrad</HI> faithful and hone&s;t, that he is a true good Man, and had &s;poke their Words, and our Words, and not his own; and the <HI>Indians</HI> having pre&s;ented him with a dre&s;t Skin to make him Shoes, and two Deer Skins, to keep him warm, they &s;aid, as they had thus taken Care of our Friend, they mu&s;t recommend their's <HI>(Shekallamy)</HI> to our Notice; and the Board judging it nece&s;&s;ary that a parti|cular
<PB N="10" REF="004146_0009_1003DC5CF683C3C8">Notice &s;hould be taken of him, acccordingly, it is, <HI>Ordered,</HI> That <HI>Six Pounds</HI> be laid out for him in &s;uch things as he may mo&s;t want.</P>
<P>It was then recommended to the Pre&s;ident, and he undertook, to pre|pare a Draught of what might be proper to be &s;aid to the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> at giving the Pre&s;ent from this Government, and to lay the &s;ame before the Board to morrow Morning, at Ten a Clock, to which time the Council adjourned.</P>

<P>The Pre&s;ident laid before the Board a draught of a concluding Speech to the Indians, which being read and approved, they were &s;ent for, who being come and &s;eated, the &s;aid Speech was delivered to them by the Inter|preter as follows.</P>
<P><HI>OUR BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>FOUR Years &s;ince at a great Treaty held here with your Chiefs, we confirmed all our former Treaties with you, we brightned the Chain, kindled our Fire to be kept always burning here for you, opened and cleared the Path between your Country and Ours, and made our|&s;elves and you one Body and one People.</P>
<P>The Chiefs of all your Nations, being met at your great Fire or Council in the Country of the <HI>Onondagoes,</HI> having heard of and con&s;idered that Treaty, were &s;o well plea&s;ed with it, that it was agreed, as you have told us, that you, who are the principal of all your Chiefs, &s;hould come down and vi&s;it us, and more fully and ab&s;olutely confirm that Treaty, which you accordingly did a few Days &s;ince at our great Hou&s;e in Town, in the pre&s;ence and hearing of &s;ome Thou&s;ands of our People, and it was done not only in Behalf of us our&s;elves and your&s;elves, but for our Children and Children's Children, to all Generations, as long as the Sun, Moon, and Earth, endure.</P>
<P>Thus this Treaty, by which we are to become as one People, and one Body, is in the &s;tronge&s;t Terms confirmed, never to be changed, but to ;be kept in everla&s;ting Remembrance.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides what we have already concluded, we &s;hall now for the further brightning the &s;ame Chain, and that no Spot or Blemi&s;h may be fixt on it, &s;peak to &s;ome Particulars for your more full Satis|faction.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004146_0010_1003DC66CB969550">
It has been agreed between us, that we &s;hould &s;uffer no Injury to be done to one of your People more than to our own, nor without puni&s;h|ing the Offender in the &s;ame manner as if it had been done to one of our People; and you al&s;o engaged on your parts that you would give us the like Satisfaction for every Injury done by your People to any of ours, and whatever &s;hould happen of this kind, it &s;hould make no other Difference, than as if the Injury were done by one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or White Man to another, and &s;o in the Ca&s;e of an <HI>Indian.</HI> Now &s;ince you came hi|ther, we have heard that a White Man one of our People, and one of yours, being both in Liquor, quarrelled at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> that the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;truck at the White Man with a Knife, and the white Man gave the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;ome Blows on the Head, of which he died in four or five Days after; that the White Man got out of the way, and hid, and when he heard the Man was dead, he ran away to the <HI>Southward</HI> of <HI>Virginia:</HI> Who was fir&s;t in the Fault in this matter we know not, but we have now i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation for apprehending the White Man, and propo&s;ed a Reward of <HI>Ten Pounds,</HI> to any one who will &s;eize and deliver him to &s;ome Magi&s;trate or Officer, that he may be put in Pri&s;on and tried for his Life; if then it appears that he willfully kill'd the Man, he will be hanged by our Law; if it was in Defence of his own Life, he is not to die for it, but after he is tried we &s;hall acquaint you how the matter appeared. The fir&s;t Account we had of it was in a Letter, which the Interpreter &s;hall read and acquaint you with it; but that Story being told only on one &s;ide, we do not depend on it for the Truth; and thus we &s;hall act in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, as Brethren always ought whenever they unfortunately happen.</P>
<P>We are very &s;en&s;ible Rum is the principal occa&s;ion of the&s;e Di&s;orders, and we heartily wi&s;h any means could be po&s;&s;ibly found to prevent the Abu&s;e of it: You have de&s;ired us in your Di&s;cour&s;e with the Proprietor to recall all our Traders from <HI>Ohio</HI> or <HI>Allegheny</HI> and the Branches of <HI>Sa&s;que|hannah;</HI> We de&s;ired at our Treaty four Years ago that all our <HI>Indians,</HI> the <HI>Delawares, Shawane&s;e,</HI> and others, &s;hould be recalled from <HI>Ohio,</HI> for we knew not then but there might be War with the <HI>French,</HI> and you know the Strength of a People con&s;i&s;ts in their being drawn clo&s;e together as into one Body, and not to be &s;cattered; but we know not what you mean by recalling our Traders; for you are &s;en&s;ible the <HI>Indians</HI> cannot live without being &s;upplied with our Goods: They mu&s;t have Powder and Lead to hunt, and Cloaths to keep them warm; and if our People do not carry them, others will, from <HI>Maryland, Virginia, Jer&s;eys,</HI> or other Places; and we are &s;ure you do not de&s;ire that <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould trade with tho&s;e People rather than with ours. The Traders of all Nations find the <HI>Indians</HI> are &s;o univer&s;ally fond of Rum, that they will not deal with|out it: We have made many Laws again&s;t carrying it; we have ordered the <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;tave the Caggs of all that is brought among&s;t them; but the Woods have not Streets like <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the Paths in them are endle&s;s, and they cannot be &s;topt, &s;o that it will be carried either from one Country or another; and on the other hand the <HI>Indians</HI> are &s;o very fond of the Liquor, even the be&s;t of them, that in&s;tead of taking it from tho&s;e who bring it, and &s;taving it, they take and drink it, which is both unju&s;t in it &s;elf, and does more Mi&s;chief; for the Traders, if they kept
<PB N="12" REF="004146_0011_1003DE63C3FC7A30">it, would hand it out by &s;tealth in &s;mall Quantities, but the <HI>Indians</HI> when they take it, drink it off by great Quantities; &s;o that no Method we can find will prevent the <HI>Indians</HI> having it, till they are &s;o wi&s;e as to refrain it of them&s;elves; and, Why are they not &s;o wi&s;e? they &s;hew very good &s;trong Sen&s;e in other things, and why cannot they act like us? All of us here, and all you &s;ee of any Credit in the Place, can every Day have as much Rum of their own to drink as they plea&s;e, and yet &s;carce one of us will take a Dram, at lea&s;t not one Man will on any Ac|count be drunk, no not if he were hired to it with great Sums of Money.</P>
<P>And now to bind and confirm all the&s;e our Words, we have provided for you the following Goods, which will be delivered to you to morrow at the Pre&s;ident's Lodgings, <HI>to wit.</HI></P></Q>

<P>The Council ri&s;ing, and the Pre&s;ident with the Proprietor &s;taying, the <HI>In|dians</HI> entered into further Di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;aid, <HI>They had received a Me&s;&s;age with &s;ome</HI> Wampum <HI>from the Governor of</HI> Maryland, <HI>informing them, he had received a Letter from the King of</HI> England, <HI>ordering him to &s;ee that they &s;hould not be wronged of their Lands; that he had under&s;tood this Government had wronged them, and if they would &s;end &s;ome of their People to him, he would take care they &s;hould be righted, he would write to the great King, who would give &s;uch Orders as that they &s;hould have Ju&s;tice done them. Being asked how they received that Me&s;&s;age, they &s;aid, the Man who brought it was here now with them, they had the</HI> Wampum <HI>and would &s;hew it to us; and they earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed that we would write to the Governors of</HI> Maryland <HI>and</HI> Virginia <HI>to make them Satisfaction for the Lands belonging to them (the Indians) which the People of tho&s;e Governments were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, that had never been purcha&s;ed of them; that all the Lands on</HI> Sa&s;quehannah <HI>and at</HI> Chanandowa <HI>were theirs, and they mu&s;t be &s;atisfied for them; that they had agreed with us for the Lands they now re|lea&s;ed to us, but they had never received any thing from the other Governments to the Southward, for theirs.</HI></P>
<P>They were told, That on their receiving the Pre&s;ent to morrow, they &s;hould be an&s;wered on the&s;e Heads; and after being entertained by the Pro|prietor, they withdrew.</P>

<P>The Honourable the Proprietor, the Pre&s;ident, with &s;ome of the Council met this Forenoon, and the <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs being come and &s;eated.</P>
<P>Their Speaker, having &s;ome Parcels of Skins laid before him, ro&s;e; and by the Interpreter &s;aid;</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004146_0012_1003DC70F28570F0">
That they were now to &s;peak to the Proprietor and our People for the la&s;t time this Vi&s;it; that we had &s;poke to them la&s;t night, and recapitulated the Heads of all that had been agreed between them and us, as the Fire, the Path, the Chain; that we are now become one People; with every other Article that had been mentioned between us: This they will remember on their Parts through all Generations, and they de&s;ire that we may remember the &s;ame as long as the Earth endures.</P>
<P><HI>That having now brightened the Chain, and confirmed all the Articles nece&s;&s;ary for e&s;tabli&s;hing perfect Friend&s;hip between them and us, and being thus become one People, they mu&s;t de&s;ire that we would be more rea&s;onable in the Sale of our Goods, which are much dearer (they &s;ay) from our Traders than from tho&s;e of</HI> New-York; <HI>that the Powder &s;old by the Traders of</HI> New-York, <HI>is generally found to be mixed with black Du&s;t, &s;o that the Bullet falls often &s;hort of the Mark thro' the Badne&s;s of the Powder; that if we would &s;ell cheap, we might thereby draw a great Trade to this Province, far beyond that of any others, which would be to our Advantage.</HI></P>
<P>And hereupon he laid down a Bundle of Skins, and &s;aid,</P>
<P><HI>That among&s;t them there is never any Victuals &s;old, the Indians give to each o|ther freely what they can &s;pare; but if they come among&s;t our People, they can have none without paying; they admire we &s;hould take Money on this Score.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That having now fini&s;hed, and preparing to return home, as &s;everal of them are old Men, they reque&s;t that we would help them on their Journey, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting them with Hor&s;es and &s;ome Carriages for their Goods; that as we have many Hor|&s;es and Carriages, they de&s;ire we would &s;pare them &s;ome for their U&s;e, who are our Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>And hereupon he laid down two Bundles of Skins;</P>
<P>Then proceeding, he &s;aid,</P>
<P><HI>That they mu&s;t de&s;ire us to write to the Governors of</HI> Virginia <HI>and</HI> Maryland, <HI>who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their Lands, without ever con&s;idering the Indians for them, and reque&s;t that we would take the An&s;wers of tho&s;e Governors, which next Spring &s;ome of their Nations will come to receive at the Fire kept for them in this Place; That they intend to apply to the great King on the other Side of the Wa|ter, and let him know what they expect on this Head from his People.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That if</HI> Civility <HI>at</HI> Cone&s;togoe, <HI>&s;hould attempt to make a Sale of any Lands to us or any of our Neighbours, they mu&s;t let us know, that he both no Power to do &s;o; and if he does any thing of the kind, they the Indians will utterly di&s;own him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That la&s;t night we told them the Woods were very dark, and that it was impo&s;|&s;ible to prevent Rum being carried to</HI> Allegheny; <HI>that if the Ca&s;e be thus, we had better hinder any Per&s;ons from going thither at all, and confine our Traders to the River</HI> Sa&s;quehannah <HI>and its Branches; for as &s;everal Indian</HI> Warriours <HI>pa&s;s by</HI> Allegheny, <HI>where &s;o much Rum is con&s;tantly to be had, they cannot but be ve|ry apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome Mi&s;chief may happen; this Con&s;ideration often troubles them.</HI></P>
<P>In An&s;wer to all which, the <HI>Indians</HI> were thus told by the Interpreter.</P>
<Q><P>THAT as to all that had pa&s;&s;ed relating to the Chain, Road and Fire, we have now firmly and fully e&s;tabli&s;hed and confirmed all the&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="004146_0013_1003B93E2C26D370">Articles, to be kept in perpetual Remembrance by them and us, and by our Children and their Children to all Generations.</P>
<P>That as to the Deame&s;s of Goods carried among&s;t them, the Govern|ment here has no Concern in the Trade, it is entirely carried on by pri|vate People; tho&s;e that go among&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI> purcha&s;e the Goods they carry with them at the ea&s;ie&s;t Rate, and we are told, that con&s;idering the Length of Way they carry them, they are &s;old &s;o cheap, that the&s;e Tra|ders can be but &s;mall Gainers; but the Prices of Goods are not under any Regulation, they get for them what they can.</P>
<P>That all the white People, tho' they live together as Brethren, have each neverthele&s;s di&s;tinct Properties and Intere&s;ts, and none of us can demand from another Victuals or any thing of the Kind without Pay|ment. One Man rai&s;es Corn and &s;ells it, another rai&s;es Hor&s;es and he &s;ells them, and thus every Man lives by his own Labour and Indu&s;try, and no one has a Right to take away from another what he thus earns for him&s;elf; and all Victuals co&s;t Money.</P>
<P>That proper Care will be taken, as has formerly been done, to &s;upply them with Hor&s;es and Carriages to make their Journey home as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>That we would be glad to do them any Service with the Neighbour|ing Governments, but we do not clearly under&s;tand this Matter: As to what is &s;aid of a Letter from the King of <HI>England,</HI> we do not believe there is any Truth in that Report; we have indeed heard of a Letter &s;ent up to <HI>Sa&s;quehannah</HI> from the Governor of <HI>Maryland;</HI> if he mentions any thing in it of Orders from the King of <HI>England,</HI> they &s;hould &s;end &s;ome Per&s;ons to that Government to enquire into the Matter. As to the Claim they make on the Lands of <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> we know not how this is &s;upported; the Lands on <HI>Sa&s;quehannah,</HI> we believe, belong to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> by the Conque&s;t of the <HI>Indians</HI> of that River; but how their Pre|tentions are made good to the Lands to the Southward, we know not; and we ought to be better informed before we can write on this Head.</P>
<P>That we cannot prevent our Traders from going where they may be&s;t di&s;po&s;e of their Goods; we &s;hall take the mo&s;t proper Mea&s;ures in our Power to hinder their carrying Rum in &s;uch Quantities, and we hope the <HI>Indians</HI> will give &s;trict Charge to the Warriours to be cautious and prudent, that all Kind of Mi&s;chief may be prevented.</P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> appearing &s;atisfied with what had been &s;poke to them, &s;aid they had nothing further to offer. The Pre&s;ent was then delivered to them, which they received with great Thankfulne&s;s, tho&s;e of each Nation alter|nately by them&s;elves, and then all of them together, joining in their u&s;ual &s;olemn Sound, when they expre&s;s their Satisfaction. Having afterwards drank a friendly Gla&s;s, and taking Leave of the Proprietor, Pre&s;ident and Court they departed; and thus the Treaty ended.</P>
