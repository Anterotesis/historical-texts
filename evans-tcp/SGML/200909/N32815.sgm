<HEAD>THE <HI>AMERICAN</HI> CRISIS. NUMBER I. BY THE AUTHOR OF COMMON SENSE.</HEAD>
<P>THESE are the times that try men's &s;ouls: The &s;ummer &s;oldier and the &s;un&s;hine patriot will, in this cri&s;is, &s;hrink from the &s;ervice of his country; but he that &s;tands it now, de&s;erves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not ea&s;ily conquered; yet we have this con&s;olation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we e&s;teem too lightly:&mdash; It is dearne&s;s only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to &s;et a proper price upon its goods; and it would be &s;trange indeed, if &s;o cele&s;tial an article as FREEDOM &s;hould not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared, that &s;he has a right (<HI>not only to</HI> TAX) but <Q><HI>to</HI> BIND <HI>us in</HI> ALL CASES WHATSOEVER,</Q> and if being <HI>bound in that manner</HI> is not &s;lavery, then there is not &s;uch a thing as &s;lavery upon earth. Even the expre&s;&s;ion is impious, for &s;o unlimited a power can belong only to GOD.</P>
<P>Whether the Independence of the Continent was de|clared too &s;oon, or delayed too long, I will not now enter into as an argument; my own &s;imple opinion is, that had it been eight months earlier, it would have been much better. We did not make a proper u&s;e of la&s;t winter, neither could we, while we were in a de|pendent

But no great deal is lo&s;t yet; all that Howe has been doing for this month pa&s;t is rather a ravage than a con|que&s;t, which the &s;pirit of the Jer&s;ies a year ago would have quickly repul&s;ed, and which time and a little re|&s;olution will &s;oon recover.</P>
<P>I have as little &s;uper&s;tition in me as any man living, but my &s;ecret opinion has ever been, and &s;till is, that GOD almighty will not give up a people to military de|&s;truction, or leave them un&s;upportedly to peri&s;h, who had &s;o earne&s;tly and &s;o repeatedly &s;ought to avoid the calamities of war, by every decent method which wi&s;|dom could invent. Neither have I &s;o much of the infi|del in me, as to &s;uppo&s;e, that HE has relinqui&s;hed the government of the world, and given us up to the care of devils; and as I do not, I cannot &s;ee on what grounds the king of Britain can look up to heaven for help again&s;t us; A common murderer, a highwayman, or a hou&s;ebreaker, has as good a pretence as he.</P>
<P>It is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee how rapidly a panic will &s;ome|times run through a country. All nations and ages have been &s;ubject to them: Britain has trembled like an ague at the report of a French fleet of flat bottomed boats; and in the fourteenth century the whole Eng|li&s;h army, after ravaging the kingdom of France, was driven back like men petrified with fear; and this brave exploit was performed by a few broken forces collected

and headed by a woman, Joan of Arc. Would, that Heaven might in&s;pire &s;ome Jer&s;ey maid to &s;pirit up her countrymen, and &s;ave her fair fellow-&s;ufferers from ra|vage and ravi&s;hment! Yet panics, in &s;ome ca&s;es, have their u&s;es; they produce as much good as hurt. Their duration is always &s;hort; the mind &s;oon grows through them, and acquires a firmer habit than before. But their peculiar advantage is, that they are the touch|&s;tones of &s;incerity and hypocri&s;y, and bring things and men to light, which might otherwi&s;e have lain for ever undi&s;covered. In fact <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> they have the &s;ame effect on &s;ecret traitors, which an imaginary apparition would upon a private murderer. They &s;ift out the hidden thoughts of man, and hold them up in public to the world. Many a di&s;gui&s;ed Tory has lately &s;hown his head, that &s;hall penitentially &s;olemnize with cur&s;es the day on which Howe arrived upon the Delaware.</P>
<P>As I was with the troops at fort Lee, and marched with them to the edge of Penn&s;ylvania, I am well ac|quainted with many circum&s;tances, which tho&s;e, who lived at a di&s;tance, know but little or nothing of. Our &s;ituation there was exceedingly cramped, the place being on a narrow neck of land between the North river and the Hacken&s;ack. Our force was incon&s;iderable, being not one fourth &s;o great as Howe could bring again&s;t us. We had no army at hand to have relieved the garri&s;on, had we &s;hut our&s;elves up and &s;tood on the defence. Our ammunition, light artillery, and the be&s;t part of our &s;tores, had been removed upon the ap|prehen&s;ion that Howe would endeavour to penetrate the Jer&s;ies, in which ca&s;e fort Lee could be of no u&s;e to us; for it mu&s;t occur to every thinking man, whether in the army or not, that the&s;e kind of field forts are only for temporary purpo&s;es, and la&s;t in u&s;e no longer than the enemy directs his force again&s;t the particular object, which &s;uch forts are rai&s;ed to defend. Such was our &s;ituation and condition at fort Lee on the morning of the
<PB N="4" REF="043115_0004_101CCC51D6C6E6F0">
20th of November, when an officer arrived with in|formation, that the enemy with 200 boats had landed about &s;even or eight miles above: Major Gen. Green, who commanded the garri&s;on, immediately ordered them under arms, and &s;ent expre&s;s to his Excellency General Wa&s;hington at the town of Hacken&s;ack, di&s;tant by the way of the ferry &s;ix miles. Our fir&s;t object was to &s;ecure the bridge over the Hacken&s;ack, which laid up the river between the enemy and us, about &s;ix miles from us and three from them. General Wa&s;hington arrived in about three quarters of an hour, and march|ed at the head of the troops towards the bridge, which place I expected we &s;hould have a bru&s;h for; however they did not chu&s;e to di&s;pute it with us, and the great|e&s;t part of our troops went over the bridge, the re&s;t over the ferry, except &s;ome which pa&s;&s;ed at a mill on a &s;mall creek, between the bridge and the ferry, and made their way through &s;ome mar&s;hy grounds up to the town of Hocken&s;ack, and there pa&s;&s;ed the river. We brought off as much baggage as the waggons could contain, the re&s;t was lo&s;t. The &s;imple object was to bring off the garri&s;on, and to march them on till they could be &s;trengthened by the Jer&s;ey or Penn&s;ylvania militia, &s;o as to be enabled to make a &s;tand. We &s;taid four days at Newark, collected in our out po&s;ts with &s;ome of the Jer&s;ey militia, and marched out twice to meet the enemy on information of their being advanc|ing, though our numbers were greatly inferior to theirs. Howe, in my little opinion, committed a great error in general&s;hip, in not throwing a body of forces off from Staten I&s;land through Amboy, by which means he might have &s;eized all our &s;tores at Brun&s;wick, and intercepted our march into Penn&s;ylvania: But, if we believe the power of hell to be limited, we mu&s;t like|wi&s;e believe that their agents are under &s;ome providen|tial controul.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now attempt to give all the particular, of our retreat to the Delaware; &s;uffice it for the pre&s;ent to
<PB N="5" REF="043115_0005_101CABF32A29ABB0">
&s;ay, that both officers and men, though greatly hara&s;&s;ed and fatigued, frequently without re&s;t, covering, or provi&s;ion, the inevitable con&s;equences of a long re|treat bore it with a manly and a martial &s;pirit. All their wi&s;hes were one, which was, that the country would turn out and help them to drive the enemy back. Voltaire has remarked, that King William never ap|peared to full advantage but in difficulties and in action; the &s;ame remark may be made on General Wa&s;hing|ton, for the character fits him. There is a natural firmne&s;s in &s;ome minds which cannot be unlocked by trifles, but which, when unlocked, di&s;covers a cabi|net of fortitude; and I reckon it among tho&s;e kind of public ble&s;&s;ings, which we do not immediately &s;ee, that GOD hath ble&s;t him with uninterrupted health, and given him a mind that can even flouri&s;h upon care.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper with &s;ome mi&s;cellaneous remarks on the &s;tate of our affairs; and &s;hall begin with a&s;king the following que&s;tion, Why is it that the enemy hath left the New-England provinces, and made the&s;e middle ones the &s;eat of war? The an&s;wer is ea&s;y: New-England is not infe&s;ted with Tories, and we are. I have been tender in rai&s;ing the cry again&s;t the&s;e men, and u&s;ed numberle&s;s arguments to &s;hew them their danger, but it will not do to &s;acrifice a world to either their folly or their ba&s;ene&s;s. The period is now arriv|ed, in which either they or we mu&s;t change our &s;enti|ments, or one or both mu&s;t fall. And what is a Tory? GOOD GOD! what is he? I &s;hould not be afraid to go with an hundred Whigs again&s;t a thou&s;and Tories, were they to attempt to get into arms. Every Tory is a coward, for a &s;ervile, &s;lavi&s;h, &s;elf-intere&s;ted fear is the foundation of Toryi&s;m; and a man under &s;uch in|fluence, though he may be cruel, never can be brave.</P>
<P>But before the line of irrecoverable &s;eparation be drawn between us, let us rea&s;on the matter together:
<PB N="6" REF="043115_0006_101CCC5369301140">
Your conduct is an invitation to the enemy, yet not one in a thou&s;and of you has heart enough to join him. Howe is as much deceived by you as the American cau&s;e is injured by you. He expects you will all take up arms, and flock to his &s;tandard with mu&s;kets on your &s;houlders. Your opinions are of no u&s;e to him, unle&s;s you &s;upport him per&s;onally; for 'tis &s;oldiers, and not Tories, that he wants.</P>
<P>I once felt all that kind of anger, which a man ought to feel, again&s;t the mean principles that are held by the Tories: A noted one, who kept a tavern at Amboy, was &s;tanding at his door, with as pretty a child in his hand, about eight or nine years old, as mo&s;t I ever &s;aw, and after &s;peaking his mind as freely as he thought was prudent, fini&s;hed with this unfatherly expre&s;&s;ion, <Q>Well! give me peace in my day.</Q> Not a man lives on the Continent but fully believes that a &s;eparation mu&s;t &s;ome time or other finally take place, and a generous parent would have &s;aid, <HI>"If there mu&s;t be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have pence;"</HI> and this &s;ingle re|flection, well applied, is &s;ufficient to awaken every man to duty. Not a place upon earth might be &s;o happy as America. Her &s;ituation is remote from all the wrangling world, and &s;he has nothing to do but to trade with them. A man may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h in him|&s;elf between temper and principle, and I am as con|fident, as I am that GOD governs the world, that Ame|rica will never be happy till &s;he gets clear of foreign dominion. Wars, without cea&s;ing, will break out till that period arrives, and the Continent mu&s;t in the end be conqueror; for, though the flame of liberty may &s;ometimes cea&s;e to &s;hine, the coal never can expire.</P>
<P>America did not, nor does not, want force; but &s;he wanted a proper application of that force. Wi&s;dom is not the purcha&s;e of a day, and it is no wonder that we &s;hould err at fir&s;t fitting off. From an exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s, we were unwilling to rai&s;e an army, and
<PB N="7" REF="043115_0007_101CABEE63694EC0">
tru&s;ted our cau&s;e to the temporary defence of a well meaning militia. A &s;ummer's experience has now taught us better; yet with tho&s;e troops, while they were collected, we were able to &s;et bounds to the pro|gre&s;s of the enemy, and, thank GOD! they are again a&s;&s;embling. I always con&s;idered a militia as the be&s;t troops in the world for a &s;udden exertion, but they will not do for a long campaign. Howe, it is probable, will make an attempt on this city; &s;hould he fail on this &s;ide the Delaware, he is ruined; if he &s;ucceeds, our cau&s;e is not ruined. He &s;takes all on his &s;ide again&s;t a part on ours; admitting he &s;ucceeds, the con&s;equence will be, that armies from both ends of the Continent will march to a&s;&s;i&s;t their &s;uffering friends in the middle States: for he cannot go every where, it is impo&s;&s;ible. I con&s;ider Howe as the greate&s;t enemy the Tories have; he is bringing a war into their country, which, had it not been for him and partly for them&s;elves, they had been clear of. Should he now be expelled, I wi&s;h, with all the devotion of a Chri&s;tian, that the names of Whig and Tory may never more be mentioned; but &s;hould the Tories give him encouragement to come, or a&s;&s;i&s;tance if he come, I as &s;incerely wi&s;h that our next year's arms may expel them from the Continent, and the Congre&s;s appropriate their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to the relief of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered in well doing. A &s;ingle &s;ucce&s;sful battle next year will &s;ettle the whole. Ame|rica could carry on a two years war by the confi&s;cation of the property of di&s;affected per&s;ons, and be made happy by their expul&s;ion. Say not that this is revenge call it rather the &s;oft re&s;entment of a &s;uffering people, who, having no object in view but the GOOD of ALL, have &s;taked their OWN ALL upon a &s;eemingly doubtful event. Yet it is folly to argue again&s;t determined hard|ne&s;s; eloquence may &s;trike the ear, and the language of &s;orrow draw forth the tear of compa&s;&s;ion, but nothing can reach the heart that is &s;teeled with prejudice.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="043115_0008_101CCC561B42E1C0">Quitting this cla&s;s of men, I turn with the warm ar|dour of a friend to tho&s;e who have nobly &s;tood, and are yet determined to &s;tand the matter out: I call not upon a few, but upon all; not on THIS State or THAT State, but on EVERY State; up and help us; lay your &s;houlders to the wheel; better have too much force than too little, when &s;o great an object is at &s;take. Let it be told to the future world, that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could &s;urvive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet and to repul&s;e it. Say not, that thou&s;ands are gone, turn out your tens of thou|&s;ands; throw not the burthen of the day upon Provi|dence, but <HI>"&s;hew your faith by your works,"</HI> that GOD may ble&s;s you. It matters not where you live or what rank of life you hold, the evil or the ble&s;&s;ing will reach you all. The far and the near, the home counties and the back, the rich and the poor, &s;hall &s;uffer or rejoice alike. The heart that feels not now, is dead? The blood of his children &s;hall cur&s;e his cowardice, who &s;hrinks back at a time when a little might have &s;aved the whole, and made <HI>them</HI> happy. I love the man that can &s;mile in trouble, that can gather &s;trength from di|&s;tre&s;s, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the bu&s;ine&s;s of little minds to &s;hrink; but he who&s;e heart is firm, and who&s;e con&s;cience approves his conduct, will pur|&s;ue his principles unto death. My own line of rea&s;on|ing is to my&s;elf as &s;trait and clear as a ray of light. Not all the trea&s;ures of the world, &s;o far as I believe, could have induced me to &s;upport an offen&s;ive war, for I think it murder; but if a thief break into my hou&s;e, burn and de&s;troy my property, and kill or threaten to kill me, or tho&s;e that are in it, and to <HI>"bind me in all ca&s;es what&s;oever,"</HI> to his ab&s;olute will, am I to &s;uffer it? What &s;ignifies it to me, whether he who does it, is a King of a common man; my countryman or not my countryman? whether it is done by an individual villain, or an army of them? If we rea&s;on to the root
<PB N="9" REF="043115_0009_101CCC6258CD0F60">
of things we &s;hall find no difference; neither can any ju&s;t cau&s;e be a&s;&s;igned why we &s;hould puni&s;h in the one ca&s;e, and pardon in the other. Let them call me rebel, and welcome, I feel no concern from it; but I &s;hould &s;uffer the mi&s;ery of devils, were I to make a whore of my &s;oul by &s;wearing allegiance to one, who&s;e character is that of a &s;otti&s;h, &s;tupid, &s;tubborn, worthle&s;s, bruti&s;h man. I conceive likewi&s;e a horrid idea in receiving mercy from a being, who at the la&s;t day &s;hall be &s;hriek|ing to the rocks and mountains to cover him, and flee|ing with terror from the orphan, the widow and the &s;lain of America.</P>
<P>There are Ca&s;es which cannot be overdone by lan|guage, and this is one. There are per&s;ons too who &s;ee not the full extent of the evil that threatens them: they &s;olace them&s;elves with hopes that the enemy, if they &s;ucceed, will be merciful. It is the madne&s;s of folly to expect mercy from tho&s;e who have refu&s;ed to do ju&s;tice; and even mercy, where conque&s;t is the ob|ject, is only a trick of war: The cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf; and we ought to guard equally again&s;t both. Howe's fir&s;t object is partly by threats and partly by promi&s;es, to terrify or &s;educe the people to deliver up their arms, and receive mercy. The mini&s;try recommended the &s;ame plan to Gage, and this is what the Tories call making their peace; <HI>"a peace which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding", in|deed!</HI> A peace which would be the immediate fore run|ner of a wor&s;e ruin than any we have yet thought of. Ye men of Penn&s;ylvania, do rea&s;on upon the&s;e things! Were the back counties to give up their arms, they would fall an ea&s;y prey to the Indians, who are all armed: This perhaps is what &s;ome Tories would not be &s;orry for. Were the home counties to deliver up their arms, they would be expo&s;ed to the re&s;entment of the back counties, who would then have it in their power to cha&s;ti&s;e their defection at plea&s;ure. And
<PB N="10" REF="043115_0010_101CCC59F975F600">
were any one &s;tate to give up its arms, THAT State mu&s;t be garri&s;oned by all Howe's army of Britons and Ho&s;&s;ians to pre&s;erve it from the anger of the re&s;t. Mu|tual fear is a principal link in the chain of mutual love, and woe be to that State that breaks the compact. Howe is mercifully inviting you to barbarous de&s;truc|tion, and men mu&s;t be either rogues or fools that will not &s;ee it. I dwell not upon the vapours of imagina|tion; I bring rea&s;on to your ears; and in language, as plain as A, B, C, hold up truth to your eyes.</P>
<P>I thank GOD that I fear not, I &s;ee no real cau&s;e for fear. I know our &s;ituation well, and can &s;ee the way out of it. While our army was collected. Howe dare not ri&s;k a battle, and it is no credit to him that he de|camped from the White Plains, and waited a mean op|portunity to ravage the defencele&s;s Jer&s;ies; but it is great credit to us, that, with an handful of men, we &s;u&s;tained an orderly retreat for near an hundred miles, brought off our ammunition, all our field pieces, the greate&s;t part of our &s;tores, and had four rivers to pa&s;s. None can &s;ay that our retreat was precipitate, for we were near three weeks in performing it, that the coun|try might have time to come in. Twice we marched back to meet the enemy and remained out till dark. The &s;ign of fear was not &s;een in our camp, and had not &s;ome of the cowardly and di&s;affected inhabitants &s;pread fal&s;e alarms through the country, the Jer&s;ies had never been ravaged. Once more we are again collected and collecting, our new army at both ends of the Conti|nent is recruiting fa&s;t, and we &s;hall be able to open the next campaign with &s;ixty thou&s;and men, well armed and cloathed. This is our &s;ituation, and who will may know it. By per&s;everance and fortitude we have the pro&s;pect of a glorious i&s;&s;ue; by cowardice and &s;ubmi&s;|mi&s;&s;ion, the &s;ad choice of a variety of evils&mdash;a ravaged country&mdash;a depopulated city&mdash;habitations without &s;afety, and &s;lavery without hope&mdash;our homes turned
<PB N="11" REF="043115_0011_101CCC65211CDE20">
into barracks and baudy-hou&s;es for He&s;&s;ians, and a future race to provide for who&s;e fathers we &s;hall doubt of. Look on this picture and weep over it!&mdash;and if there yet remains one thoughtle&s;s wretch who believes it not, let him &s;uffer it unlamented.</P>
