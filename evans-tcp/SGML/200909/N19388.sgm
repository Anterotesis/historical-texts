<HEAD><HI>AN</HI> Authentic Account, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SOME years ago an Engli&s;h Gentleman, by a par|ticular providence, had occa&s;ion to be in North America, where, among other adventures, the follow|ing circum&s;tance occurred to him, which is related in his own words.</P>
<P>"Every day's ob&s;ervation convinces me that the children of God are made &s;o by his own e&s;pecial grace and power, and that all means, whether more or le&s;s, are equally effectual with him, whenever he is plea&s;ed to employ them for conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>"In one of my excur&s;ions, while I was in the pro|vince of <HI>New York,</HI> I was walking by my&s;elf over a con&s;iderable plantation, amu&s;ed with its hu&s;bandry, and comparing it with that of my own country, till I came within a little di&s;tance of a middle-aged negro, who was tilling the ground. I felt a &s;trong incli|nation, unu&s;ual with me, to conver&s;e with him. After a&s;king him &s;ome little que&s;tions about his work, which he an&s;wered very &s;en&s;ibly, I wi&s;hed him to tell me, whether his &s;tate of &s;lavery was not di&s;a|greeable to him, and whether he would not gladly exchange it for his liberty. "Ma&s;&s;ah, (&s;aid he, looking &s;eriou&s;ly upon me) I have wife and children; my ma&s;&s;ah takes care of them, and I have no care to provide any thing; I have a good ma&s;&s;ah, who teach me to read; and I read good book, that make me happy." I am glad, replied I, to hear you &s;ay &s;o; and pray what is the good book you read? "The Bible, ma&s;&s;ah, God's own good book." Do you un|der&s;tand friend, as well as read this book? for many
<PB N="3" REF="025244_0003_0FCCE9142DD5FE58">can read the words well; who cannot get hold of the true and good &s;en&s;e. "O ma&s;&s;ah, &s;ays he, I read the book much before I under&s;tand; but at la&s;t I felt pain in my heart; I found things in the book that cut me to pieces." Aye, &s;aid I, what things were they? "Why ma&s;&s;ah, I found that I had bad heart, ma&s;&s;ah, a very bad heart indeed: I felt pain, that God would de&s;troy me, becau&s;e I was wicked, and done nothing as I &s;hould do. God was holy, and I was very vile and naughty; &s;o I could have nothing from him but fire and brim&s;tone in hell." In &s;hort, he entered in|to a full account of his convictions of &s;in, which were indeed as deep &amp; piercing as any I had ever heard of; and what &s;criptures came to his mind, which he had read, that both probed him to the bottom of his &s;inful heart, and were made the means of light and comfort to his &s;oul. I then enquired of him, what mini&s;try or means he made u&s;e of, and found that his ma&s;ter was a Quaker, a plain &s;ort of man, who had taught his &s;laves to read, but who had not, how|ever, ever conver&s;ed with this negro upon the &s;tate of his &s;oul. I a&s;ked him how he got comfort under all this trial? "O ma&s;&s;ah, &s;ays he, it was Chri&s;t gave me comfort by his dear word. He bade me come unto him, and he would give me re&s;t, for I was very weary and heavy laden. And here he went through a line of the mo&s;t precious texts in the bible, &s;hewing me, by his artle&s;s comment upon them as he went a long, what great things God had done in the cour&s;e of &s;ome years for his &s;oul. Being rather more acquainted with doctrinal truths, and the anal|ogy of the bible, than he had been, or in his &s;itua|tion could ea&s;ily be; I had a mind to try how far a &s;imple untutored experience, greaciou&s;ly given with|out the u&s;ual means, could carry a man from &s;ome &s;peculative errors; and therefore a&s;ked him &s;everal que&s;tions about the merit of works, the ju&s;tification of a &s;inner, the power of grace, and the like. I own
<PB N="4" REF="025244_0004_0FCCE91669F52278">I was as much a&s;toni&s;hed at, as I admired, the &s;weet &s;pirit and &s;implicity of his an&s;wers, with the heaven|ly wi&s;dom that God had put into the mind of this negro. His di&s;cour&s;e, flowing merely from the richne&s;s of grace, with a tenderne&s;s and expre&s;&s;ion for "beyond the reach of art," perfectly charmed me. On the other hand, my entering into all his feelings, together with an account to him, which he had never heard before, that thus and thus the Lord in his mercy dealt with all his children, and had dealt with me, drew &s;treams of joyful tears down his black face, that we looked upon each-other, and talked with that inexpre&s;&s;ible glow of chri&s;tian affection, that made me more than ever believe, what I have often too thoughtle&s;sly profe&s;&s;ed to believe, <HI>the communion of &s;aints.</HI> I &s;hall never forget how the poor excel|lent creature &s;eemed to hang upon my lips, and to eat my very words, when I enlarged upon the love of Chri&s;t to poor &s;inners, the free bounty and ten|der mercy of God, the frequent and delightful &s;en&s;e he gives of his pre&s;ence, the faith he be&s;tows in his promi&s;es, the victories this faith is enabled to get over trials and temptations, the joy and peace in believing, the hope in life and death, and the glori|ous expectation of immortality. To have taken off his eager, delighted, animated, air and manner, would have been a ma&s;terly-piece for a <HI>Reynolds.</HI>&mdash; He had never heard &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e, nor found the opportunity of hearing it before. He &s;eemed like a man who had been thrown into a new world, and at length had found company. Though my conver&s;a|tion la&s;ted, at lea&s;t, two or three hours, I &s;carce ev|er enjoyed the happy &s;wiftne&s;s of time &s;o &s;weetly in all my life. We knew not how to part. He would accompany me as far as he might; and I felt, for my part, &s;uch a delight in the artle&s;s, &s;avory, &s;olid, unaffected experience of this dear &s;oul, that I could have been glad to &s;ee him often then, or to &s;ee his
<PB N="5" REF="025244_0005_0FCCE917E17D1AD8">like at any time now. But my &s;ituation rendered this impo&s;&s;ible. I therefore took an affectionate adieu, with an ardor equal to the warme&s;t and the mo&s;t ancient friend&s;hip, telling him, that neither the colour of his body, nor the condition of his pre&s;ent life, could prevent him from being my dear brother in out dear Saviour; and that, though we mu&s;t part now, never to &s;ee each other again any more in this world, I had no doubt of our having another joyful meeting in our Father's home, where we &s;hould live together, and love one another through out along and a happy eternity. "Amen. Amen, my dear ma&s;&s;ah; God ble&s;s you, and poor me too, for ever and ever." If I had been an angel from heaven, he could not have received me with more evident delight than he did; nor could I have con&s;idered him with a more &s;ympathetic regard, if he had been a long known chri&s;tian of the good old &s;ort, grown up into my affections in the cour&s;e of many years."<NOTE PLACE="foot">IT is written in the &s;criptures, and fulfilled in the experience of real chri&s;tians, <HI>They &s;hall be all taught of God,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">xi. vi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">5.

<HEAD><HI>A</HI> Faithful Narrative, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WITH regard to her temper of mind, her views of &s;upernatural objects, and her appre+hen&s;ions with regard to the &s;tate of her &s;oul towards God, &s;he related as follows:</P>
<P>From my youth up to my fir&s;t awakening, I lived without God in the world, in a &s;tupified forgetful|ne&s;s of the obligations I had ever been under to him and of the &s;olemn account I mu&s;t one day render unto him of the deeds done in the body, and of all my views and aims; till it plea&s;ed a &s;overeign God two years ago la&s;t July, to lend his Spirit to convince me of my &s;ins, and lay open to my view the awful danger that was impending over me. At which time my &s;ins were &s;et in order before me, in &s;uch dread|ful arra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> and the enmity of my heart, and my native oppo&s;ition to God, ari&s;ing to my view, produced &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s and agony of &s;oul, as to overpower all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of bodily pain, though I had for &s;ome time be|fore been exerci&s;ed with &s;evere di&s;tre&s;s in body, and was at this time reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of weakne&s;s, accompanied with continual wrecking pain, that my life was almo&s;t de&s;paired of from day to day.</P>
<P>It appears to me a&s;toni&s;hing upon every recollec|tion th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> the agony of my mind did not di&s;&s;olve the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of my nature, and how I could &s;ub&s;i&s;t under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and agony of &s;uch a wounded &s;pirit. It &s;eems to me now, that had it continued much longer, it mu&s;t unavoidably have overpowered the remains of life in me, and put a period to my exi&s;tence on
<PB N="7" REF="025244_0007_0FCCE91AEA4F0248">earth. But after having remained for &s;everal days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> this angui&s;h of &s;pirit, and dreadful bondage of &s;oul, I found relief in a manner mo&s;t unexpected.</P>
<P>After I had &s;aid my&s;elf down on my bed, my mind was led to a mo&s;t delightful and realizing view of the entire &s;afety of tru&s;ting in the Divine Power and Mercy; that there was &s;uch a fulne&s;s in God, of that which I needed for relief and comfort, that my heart within me was con&s;trained to rejoice, and could not but roll my burden upon the Lord. At this time the words of the P&s;almi&s;t, in which he &s;ays, Thou ha&s;t brought my feet up out of the miry clay," &amp;c. were to my &s;oul &s;weeter than honey or the honey comb; and al&s;o the 16th Hymn of the third book of Doctor WATTS" Hymns, was to my &s;oul like a fea&s;t of fat things, and of wine upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ees. For &s;ome con&s;iderable time after this, I en|joyed, almo&s;t without any intermi&s;&s;ion, a mo&s;t &s;weet and refre&s;hing &s;en&s;e of the beauty and glory of di|vine objects. But not under&s;tanding the treachery of my own heart, and the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, I was allured away by degrees, into a forgetfulne&s;s of God, and from a clo&s;e walk with him, through an appre|hen&s;ion that I might innocently indulge my&s;elf in joining with young people in what is u&s;ually term|ed civil merriment; and which I was induced to do more e&s;pecially and principally that I might not be|come an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> ridicule among them. But before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> the danger I had incurred by turning in &s;uch a manner to vanity, I found that my heart was &s;en&s;ibly alienated from God, and my whole &s;oul was overwhelmed in guilt and darkne&s;s, and during <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of my per&s;i&s;ting to join with young compa|ny in what is termed civil recreation and merriment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> felt tho&s;e la&s;hes and &s;tings of con&s;cience, which be|fore this I had ever been an utter &s;tranger to. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tate of &s;en&s;ible guilt and darkne&s;s, I continued
<PB N="8" REF="025244_0008_0FCCE91C6853AF48">like one for&s;aken of God, and &s;hut out from his pre|&s;ence, till the fir&s;t day of la&s;t July, when I was &s;eiz|ed with convul&s;ions, which came upon me with &s;uch violence that it appeared to my&s;elf and others, that my animal frame mu&s;t yield to the force of the di&s;|order, and my life &s;oon come to a period.</P>
<P>She continued in this &s;ituation till the night of the eleventh of July, when &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a mo&s;t violent cramp in her &s;tomach, which was ac|companied with &s;uch agony and di&s;tre&s;s that it ap|peared impo&s;&s;ible for her to live from one hour to another. In this &s;ituation &s;he continued till the fol|lowing night, when the cramp in her &s;tomach in|crea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that the con&s;tant wreck and agony of body con&s;trained her to a continual rolling and tumbling on her bed, during which time, &s;he re|mained &s;peechle&s;s, but appeared to have her &s;en&s;es; for when any &s;poke, &s;he would take them by the hand and intimate that &s;he under&s;tood what they &s;aid. All hopes of life were now at an end in the view of the family, and neighbors, who had come together at the hou&s;e on this occa&s;ion. But after having contin|ued in this extremity of di&s;tre&s;s, till about midnight, &s;he appeared to be more ea&s;y; upon which the neigh|bors retired to their &s;everal homes. But &s;oon after this &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized again, and &s;uppo&s;ed by the family to be dead; and accordingly the neigh|bors were called together to the hou&s;e, with the tidings that POLLY was dead.</P>
<P>Upon the arrival of the neare&s;t neighbor, he ob|&s;erved that &s;he lay &s;tretched out on her back, with her eyes about half open, and the &s;ight of her eyes turned up into her head &mdash; She appeared at fir&s;t &s;ight to be entirely lifele&s;s; but upon trial, he found for once, &s;ome motion in her pul&s;e.&mdash;After lying in this po&s;ture for an hour or more, &s;he &s;uddenly fetch|ed a long &s;igh, and opened her eyes, and related as</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="025244_0009_0FCCE91DDFDC5F40">
I have &s;een hell naked before my eyes, and fully expected to plunge into it. The &s;ight was di&s;mal beyond all di&s;cription. It was a region of mo&s;t di&s;|mal darkne&s;s and &s;moke. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e dole|ful &s;hades appeared to my view a per&s;on whom I knew; and after having had &s;ight of him, he appear|ed to &s;ink down into the darkne&s;s and &s;moke of the horrible pit. I heard the groans of the damned &s;pi|rits, which indicated that agony and di&s;tre&s;s which is beyond all utterance or conception. In the utmo&s;t extremity of danger, and when I appeared to my&s;elf to be ready to plunge into the di&s;mal gulf of dark|ne&s;s and mi&s;ery, my Saviour took me by the hand, and told me to follow him. Upon which he led me thro a place re&s;embling the mo&s;t di&s;mal miry clay; and from thence thro a hideous wilderne&s;s; after pa&s;&s;ing which, every object which opened to my view, appeared to be cloathed with an inexpre&s;&s;ible beauty. My Saviour addre&s;&s;ed me, and &s;aid, he had brought my feet out of the miry clay, and had &s;et them upon a rock; and he him&s;elf appeared to be the rock up|on which I &s;tood. I was admitted into the heavenly world, where the Lord looked upon me, and &s;mil|ed, and told me I mu&s;t return and warn a wicked world for a &s;ea&s;on: but &s;hould, in a &s;hort time, re|turn again. He told me I &s;hould be much more &s;ick than I had been, but &s;hould wholly recover, and be well for a &s;ea&s;on. I &s;aw thou&s;ands of the heavenly ho&s;t cloathed in that beauty which cannot be uttered; and heard tho&s;e &s;ongs of prai&s;e, the melody of which is beyond the power of language to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Upon her having declared to the by-&s;tanders the&s;e di&s;coveries, &s;he remained for the &s;pace of three days and three nights without food or &s;leep: during the whole of which time &s;he was almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly em|ployed in praying and prai&s;ing GOD, and warning others to prepare for death. After this &s;he gradual|ly
<PB N="10" REF="025244_0010_0FCCE91F68C56C78">recovered to &s;uch a degree of health, as to be able to walk about the hou&s;e; and, at times, to walk a|broad. In this &s;pace &s;he frequently &s;aid that &s;he &s;hould be much &s;icker than ever &s;he bad been; but &s;hould certainly recover to a better &s;tate of health than &s;he had enjoyed for four years pa&s;t. She fre|quently pointed out the week in which &s;he &s;hould be taken &s;ick, and reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of extreme weakne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s; and accordingly, on Friday of the &s;ame week &s;he had mentioned (which was the 27th of July) &s;he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a mo&s;t violent cramp convul&s;ion, which was &s;oon accompa|nied with a profu&s;e di&s;charge of blood from her &s;tomach; in which &s;ituation &s;he continued till the 18th of Augu&s;t; during which time &s;he was reduced apparently to the la&s;t extremity, and all vi&s;ible pro&s;|pect of the po&s;&s;ibility of her living was now at an end.</P>
<P>For the &s;pace of &s;ixteen days &s;he was not known to turn her&s;elf in the bed except once. From Mon|day night to the Saturday night following, &s;he re|mained intirely without food or drink, except for once &s;he took down a little water, and upon her having for once &s;wallowed a mor&s;el of food, her &s;to|mach immediately rejected it. She was &s;o weak that it was with di&s;&s;iculty, and very &s;eldom, &s;he could make any one under&s;tand her by whi&s;pering in their ear. On Saturday &s;he was tho't to be dy|ing; but as &s;he had all along intimated to tho&s;e a|bout her that &s;he &s;hould certainly recover, &s;o &s;he now continued to intimate the &s;ame by &s;igns, to the by-&s;tanders.&mdash;In this &s;ituation &s;he continued till about eight o'clock in the evening, at which time, to the &s;urprize of the by &s;tanders, &s;he &s;poke out in plain and audible words, and &s;aid, "Stand by, and let me get up." Immediately upon which &s;he &s;prang up from her bed, and walked the room with an a&s;to|ni&s;hing nimblene&s;s and alacrity, prai&s;ing GOD'S and
<PB N="11" REF="025244_0011_0FCCE920E62C3B68">calling on the by &s;tanders to join with her to prai&s;e that ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who had appeared for her in that wonderful manner. But they &s;tood like per|&s;ons over whelmed in a&s;toni&s;hment, to &s;ee the won|ders of GOD'S power di&s;played in &s;uch a manner, in re&s;toring one to health and &s;trength in a moment, who had been reduced to &s;o low a &s;tate by extreme &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon this recovery, &s;he related that &s;he faw one &s;tanding in white, who &s;aid to her, "If you will get up, you &s;hall be able to walk; and you mu&s;t go up to SCOTT'S;" (which was one mile di&s;tant from her hou&s;e) and accordingly, that evening &s;he rode to Capt. Scott's, and tarried &s;ome hours, and returned home; and having retired to bed, a little after day|light, &s;he aro&s;e early on the morning, and before &s;un-ri&s;e, was on her way to meeting at <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> to the di&s;tance of five miles, from whence &s;he returned home on the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>From the time of her recovery, &s;he has enjoyed, hitherto, a much better &s;tate of health, than for four years pa&s;t; and is now as well as is u&s;ual for a female of a delicate con&s;titution; and remains an evident monument of the Divine power and good|ne&s;s.</P>

Under a &s;en&s;e of this, &s;he a&s;ks liber|ty to call upon every reader to come and ta&s;te that the LORD is gracious; and that her fellow youth, in &s;pecial, would remember him in their early days, and regard his glory as their governing object. She does intreat them, in &s;pecial, to for&s;ake the vani|ties of the world, and pride of life. And if they
<PB N="12" REF="025244_0012_0FCCE922BB6F1298">would walk with GOD, &s;o as to enjoy the light of his countenance, and have comfort in their &s;oul, they do &s;acredly ab&s;tain from, and forever abandon, that kind of fooli&s;h talking, and je&s;ting, and that recrea|tion and merriment, which generally pa&s;&s;es, even among&s;t many profe&s;&s;ors of Religion, for <HI>civil and innocent.</HI>&mdash;She certainly knows by what &s;he has found upon trial, that the&s;e things, in their operati|on, will be like wormwood and gall to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Under a &s;en&s;e that we are called with an high and holy calling, &s;he affectionately intreats every one to con&s;ider, what manner of per&s;ons we ought to be, in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s; looking for, and ha&s;tening unto, the day of GOD, that we may be found of him in peace at his appearing, and final|ly be received into his eternal kingdom.</P>
