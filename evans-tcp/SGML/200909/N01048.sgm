<P>NEither have you [Prie&s;ts] the Word of God in your hearts, nor Chri&s;t, which is Eternal and Infallible; all which the <HI>Quakers</HI> have to Judge Per&s;ons and things. <HI>Great Mi&s;tery,</HI> by G. F. pag. 5.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers</HI> have a &s;pirit given beyond all the Fore-fathers &s;ince the days of the Apo&s;tles in the Apo&s;tacy, and they can di&s;cern who are Saints, who are Devils, and who Apo&s;tates without &s;peaking ever a word, they that be in the power and life of truth. page 89.</P>
<P><HI>G.

<P>It is the Doctrine of Devils, that preacheth, that men &s;hall have &s;in, and be in a War-fare, &s;o long as they be on earth pag. 101.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers</HI> are in the Power of God, and in the Authority of the Lamb, above all hou&s;es, and into hou&s;es creep not, but are <HI>&V;PON</HI> the Throne. p. 31.</P>

<P>The <HI>Bomb &s;earcher,</HI> pag. 9. Before he begins with the charges, he takes up the la&s;t thing in the bomb to an&s;wer fir&s;t, which is a harmle&s;s word of Mr. <HI>Talbot's,</HI> who had called <HI>F.

<PB N="6" REF="001248_0006_0FB18B5A371A8970">
I have this Book of <HI>G W.</HI> by me, to &s;hew to all that doubt of the truth of it; in which Book <HI>G. W.</HI> indeed &s;peaks highly of what they call their &s;piritual Blood of their Chri&s;t or Light within. But [as you &s;ee before] he rejects the human Blood of Chri&s;t. <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;ays, Chri&s;t in the Male and Female is the &s;eed, and the &s;eed Chri&s;t &mdash; And the Blood of the &s;eed clean&s;eth from &s;in, <HI>Gr. Mi&s;tery</HI> pag. 299, 281.

<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> As to <HI>C. A's</HI> denying the <HI>imagined God above the Sars,</HI> C. P. &s;ays, <HI>They have di&s;owned both the pa&s;&s;age and the Author.</HI> But this al&s;o is a piece of <HI>Fox-Craft;</HI> for they do not di&s;own the &s;ame Doctrine, (as you &s;ee before) <HI>W. B.</HI> a&s;&s;erts the very &s;ame Doctrine, which the <HI>Quakers</HI> own and Ju&s;tify. They did indeed di&s;own the &s;aid <HI>Atkins</HI> after he was hanged for fellony, and I never heard they di&s;owned him before; for they owned him after he had lain with <HI>Simons</HI> his Maid in <HI>Norwich</HI> Goal, becau&s;e he confe&s;t the fact; for he continued a travelling Preacher afterwards. But this <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> would make his Reader believe that they di&s;own'd <HI>Atkins</HI> becau&s;e of that doctrine; which is deceit, and &s;till confirms <HI>F. B's</HI> Charge, That the <HI>Quaker</HI>-Writers and Preachers make it their whole bu&s;ine&s;s to deceive.</P>
<P>Now, before we come to the Charges in the <HI>Bomb,</HI> I take notice, the <HI>Quakers</HI> in pag. 6. of the Preface, confe&s;s, That if we can prove tho&s;e Charges, they own them&s;elves neither fit for Religious nor Civil Societies. Tho' this be a meer vaunt, a &s;ham, and they intend it for nothing el&s;e but Mockery; yet they are hereby manife&s;tly Self-Judged and Self-Condemn'd; for they know that not only the&s;e, but many more as erronious Charges has been often proved upon them, &s;o as that they never dare venture to refer the cau&s;e between them and their Adver&s;aries to indifferent men.</P>
<P>He enters, pag. 14. upon the fir&s;t charge of their Contempt of the holy Scriptures, which is fully proved in the Quotations, page 2, 3 for though I have not now the books by me that calls them Bea&s;tly Ware, an Idol, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet to call faith in the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;ts Manife&s;tation (<HI>viz.</HI> the New-Te&s;ta|ment) a deadly Poi&s;on, as <HI>W P.</HI> does; This I take to be as great a contempt as can be put upon the Scriptures.</P>
<P>But here <HI>C P.</HI> to defend or excu&s;e their Rage again&s;t the Scriptures, &s;ays That <HI>G. F.</HI> &s;aid that a Prie&s;t &s;aid, that the Letter of the Scripture is God.

lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Lye, yet they know we cannot di&s;prove it, becau&s;e <HI>Fox</HI> quotes no mans Book for it.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome mad man or other had &s;aid the letter of the Scrip|ture is God, does this ju&s;tify <HI>Fox</HI> in calling them Serpents Meat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet call his own Writings The Word of God? Friend <HI>Caleb</HI> &s;eems here to be got into a vein of Je&s;ting or Comical di&s;&s;emulation; for he would have it, that 'tis only the Ink and Paper, the Letter that they quarrel at, as if their own Books were not made of Paper and Letter as well as the Bible. But <HI>Fox</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Feeding upon the Letter, which is Death, which feeds you Serpents, Dogs and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> Now they know that no man eats the Ink and Paper, but 'tis the Doctrine they feed on; and therefore this &s;tills &s;hews their de&s;ign is only to deceive. I have &s;hewed in this years Almanack from matter of fact, that they &s;till hold the &s;ame Opinion of the &s;criptures, even while with the next breath they will &s;ay, they believe them of divine Authority.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Their bla&s;phemous denyal of the holy Trinity is plain pag. 2, 3. whereby the <HI>Quakers</HI> excluded them&s;elves from being Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters; They can have no benefit of the Act of toleration that denys the Trinity of three Per&s;ons in the God-head, as it is declared in the 39 Articles [which every true <HI>Quaker</HI> does deny] And this the la&s;t page of that Law expre&s;ly declares.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That they deny <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to be Chri&s;t the Son of God, this is proud by almo&s;t every Quotation on that head at pag. 3. And yet this <HI>Bomb-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ercher</HI> has the impudence to &s;ay, this is an abominable, a notorious fal&s;hood and brings long quotations to prove the contrary. But here lies a Snake in the Gra&s;s, as I &s;hall di&s;cover anon, and that there is need of large railing, to hide their vile Opinion on this point.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Their neglect and contempt of the Ordinances is &s;hewed but &s;hort in pag. 3. becau&s;e their practice proves it without Quotations. But if they are not content with this, they may look in <HI>News out of the North,</HI> pag 4. where <HI>Fox</HI> calls Bapti&s;m and Chri&s;ts Ordinance, the Sacrifice of <HI>Cain.</HI> And pag. 14. what the Apo&s;tles calls the Table and Cup of the Lord, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.21. <HI>Fox</HI> calls, The Table of Devils, and Cup of Devils.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That they undervalue the Sufferings of Chri&s;t, by affirming, their own Sufferings to be greater and more unju&s;t. This is plainly &s;aid at pag. 3 and is not denyed, but excu&s;ed by this <HI>Bomb-S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earcher.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sixth</HI> Charge being proved in the fir&s;t, I'll &s;ay no more of it, &s;eeing he is &s;ilent in it.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e Charges in the <HI>Bomb</HI> are breifly, yet fully proved by the Quota|tions before, Notwith&s;tanding the great noi&s;y long Preachments and railing in the <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> to drive his Reader from the Scent o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e vile Errors. But there is need of it for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now for confirmation, enlarge a little upon their denyal of Chri&s;t, and their Arts to hide their mon&s;trous Notion of him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers</HI> having rejected the outward Chri&s;t and his Blood, as having no faith therein, but only in what they call thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Chri&s;t or Light within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="8" REF="001248_0008_0FB283C5E87A8898">place Salvation there, and in the Blood of this Light within, as is before &s;hewed; which coming to be publickly noted, lookt &s;o odious and Antichri|&s;tian, that they, (to avoid the odium) have Jumpt into tricks and arts of the antient Hereticks, to deceive by double meanings, <HI>viz.</HI> to make &s;eeming Chri&s;tian Confe&s;&s;ions, but mean not a word of it, as <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> mean. They own a Per&s;onal Chri&s;t, and a man Chri&s;t without them, but mean it only of what they call the Light within all men, which they &s;ay it without them al&s;o of <HI>T. Ellwood</HI> in pag. 97. of his an&s;wer to <HI>G. Keiths Nar.</HI> is as plain in this as any of them. Chri&s;t was truly man (&s;ays he) before he appeared in the outward Body, and that not only in his People, but out of or without them al&s;o; How long before? Even from the beginning (&s;ays he) &s;o <HI>W. P.</HI> denys that Per&s;on born of a Virgin to be the &s;eed promi&s;ed, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. But &s;ays, 'tis a principle of Light in the heart, (as you &s;ee before.) Thus the <HI>Quakers</HI> Chri&s;t was a Man not only before he was made of a Woman, but even before any woman in the world was made. This is new doctrine, and is their foundation Error, whereon they build all the re&s;t, and whoever will take the pains to read <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s <HI>Great Mi&s;tery,</HI> pag. 246, 249, 205, 211. will there &s;ee that nothing will &s;erve him but for the Light within to be whole Chri&s;t, God and Man, Fle&s;h, Body, Blood and Bones, and denys that Chri&s;t has any Body that is ab&s;ent from his People, and is now in the Pre&s;ence of his Father in Heaven without them; where he al&s;o holds, That it was God the Father that was born of the Virgin, or took human Nature.</P>
<P>I have this <HI>Great My&s;try</HI> by me, and would gladly &s;hew it to all who doubt of the truth of the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>Now to di&s;cover the Snake afore&s;aid, you mu&s;t note, the <HI>Quakers</HI> have many times been urged and provoked to let the world know whether they believe in a Chri&s;t without them, now in haven, and whether they believe Chri&s;t is now and forever to come really a Man, in true and proper humane Nature without all other men? But they would never an&s;wer, Yea, to the&s;e Queries; but go round about 'em, and on every &s;ide, and &s;eem to confe&s;s all, and much more, and yet mean nothing but to deceive. Thus this <HI>Bomb-Searcher,</HI> pag. 27. of the la&s;t part of his Book, to the fir&s;t Query [<HI>Do you believe in a Chri&s;t without you,</HI> &amp;c?] &s;ays, if we mean that Chri&s;t is in heaven without us, as to his outward per&s;onal per&s;ence, and in us by his &s;piritual appearance, it is their faith, as well as ours.</P>
<P>Now ob&s;erve, the deceit of the&s;e &s;incere <HI>Quakers.</HI> The Query is not whe|ther they believe Chri&s;t is in heaven without them (tho' even this they do not believe, but in their meaning afore&s;aid) But the Query is, Do you believe IN a Chri&s;t without you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> believe to be &s;aved by a Chri&s;t without you) This was the Query, and here it is that he deceives his unwary Reader, by hiding his head in a ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, like a Woodcock, and thinks no body &s;ees him; he might have &s;pared his long preachments of Quotations (full of &s;uch deceit as this) that he there brings from their Books to prove that they can &s;ay, Yea to tho&s;e Queries, as well as we; for only the&s;e three &s;imple Letters
<PB N="9" REF="001248_0009_0FB18B5D264706C8"><HI>YEA,</HI> hone&s;tly expre&s;t, would have done it, without all this. O but then they are &s;en&s;ible it would have given the lye to their former Doctrine before quoted, which they &s;ay, is their faith &s;till, <HI>viz.</HI> That faith in Chri&s;t without m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n is contrary to the Apo&s;tles doctrine. And that the outward Chri&s;t is not the proper Son of God. And That Chri&s;t without is the fal&s;e Chri&s;t. And that they are Reprobates that &s;ay they are &s;aved by Chri&s;t without them. And much more to the &s;ame tune, which they mu&s;t di&s;own if ever they come to own Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>But in &s;hort; their Di&s;obedience to the Commands and Ordinances of the outward Chri&s;t is &s;ufficient, without Quotations to prove that they deny him. For they cannot &s;hew wherein they obey &s;o much as one com|mand of Chri&s;t, any more then the <HI>Jews</HI> do, who al&s;o deny him.</P>
<P>Nay, I could &s;hew wherein the <HI>Jews</HI> own more of Chri&s;t then the <HI>Quakers</HI> own; for the <HI>Quakers</HI> would make nothing of Chri&s;t but moral virtues. <HI>What is Chri&s;t</HI> (&s;ays <HI>W Penn</HI>) <HI>but Meekne&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Mercy, Patience,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Addre&s;s to Prote&s;tants,</HI> pag. 119. where al&s;o he declares moral men to be Chri&s;tians; and you &s;ee before, he calls it a deadly Poi&s;on to make any di&s;tinction between Chri&s;tian and Moral. Thus the <HI>Quakers</HI> are forced upon this &s;hift to allow moral heathens, <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> to be <HI>Chai&s;tians,</HI> becau&s;e they have no other way in the world to prove them&s;elves Chri&s;tians; there is only this difference, the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> are the better, as being more free from deceit, becau&s;e they make no pretence to Chri&s;tianity, and the <HI>Quakers</HI> do.</P>
<P>But how &s;trange is their delu&s;ion, who cannot &s;ee that at this rate there was no need at all of the holy Apo&s;tles being &s;ent to the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Heathens</HI> to preach the Go&s;pel of Peace and Salvation by Chri&s;t crucifyed. Nor indeed could there be any need of Chri&s;ts coming, and being crucifyed. But the <HI>Quakers</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ainly &s;ay as much, for their Books tell us, that his coming in the fle&s;h, and being crucifyed was but a figure, and for our example, as I have formerly &s;hewed.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Why will this <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> &s;o di&s;&s;emble, as to imitate the Chri|&s;tian in owning (as before) that Chri|&s;t is per&s;onally without us, and in us by his &s;piritual influence, &s;eeing in their Books they call it non&s;en&s;e? Chri&s;t or the Spirit in his people, the beams of Chri&s;t without us, is non&s;en&s;e, &s;o <HI>G. Whitehead, Light and Life,</HI> pag. 26. I &s;ay, why will he thus make it his bu&s;ine&s;s to deceive in every thing?</P>

<HEAD><HI>An Appendix,</HI> with &s;ome Gleanings.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall in the fir&s;t place in&s;ert a large Quotation from <HI>W. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Sandy Foundation</HI> (before Quoted, for their denyal of the Trinity) being a pretious Book with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> which was wrote again&s;t the Trinity, and Chri&s;ts &s;atisfaction, which Book they now keep up in <HI>England,</HI> for fear of
<PB N="10" REF="001248_0010_0FB18B5EAAEA5018">the Law and outward Powers; But here, having the power in their own hands, they are bold with it; and as if they would bid defiance to the Law, as well as to Chri&s;tianity, they direct (pag. 76) where 'tis publickly to be &s;een at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and recommend it to be read by &s;ober per&s;ons; wherefore to &s;hew further of the arts u&s;ed by the&s;e <HI>Quakers,</HI> for the di&s;truc|tion of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> I al&s;o recommend to every con&s;iderate Reader what here followes, truly quoted out of that Book.</P>
<P><HI>Sandy Foundation,</HI> pag. 16, 20, 21, 22 He begins, pag. 16. thus; <Q>The vulgar Doctrine of Satisfaction, dependent on the &s;econd per&s;on of the imagined Trinity, Refuted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> Then he goes on &s;ome pages to refute it, and brings his rea&s;ons to prove that Je&s;us Chri&s;t did not make &s;atisfaction to God for our &s;ins. And in pag. 20. he calls this following an Ab&s;urdity, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <Q>That the Finite and Impotent Creature is more capable of extending mercy &amp; forgivene&s;s than the Infinite &amp; Omnipotent Creator &mdash; For admit|ting God to be a Creditor (&s;ays he) or he to whom the Debt &s;hould be paid, and Chri&s;t he that pays it on the behalf of man, the Debtor, the Que&s;tion will ari&s;e, Whether he paid the debt, as God, or Man, or both?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Not as God,</HI> (&s;ays he.)</P>

<P N="3">III. <Q>The Ju&s;tice offending being infinite, his &s;atisfaction ought to bear a proportion therewith, which Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as Man, could never pay, he being FINITE, and from a finite cau&s;e, could not proceed an infinite effect; for &s;o man may be &s;aid to bring forth God.</Q></P>

<P N="4">IV. <Q>For where two Mediums or Middle Propo&s;itions are &s;ingly incon&s;tent with the nature of the end for which they were at fir&s;t propounded, their Conjunction does rather augment, than le&s;&s;en the difficulty of its accom|pli&s;hment.</Q></P>
<P N="5">V. <Q>But Admitting one of the&s;e three Mediums po&s;&s;ible for the payment of an infinite debt, yet pray ob&s;erve, the mo&s;t unworthy and ridiculous con&s;equences that will attend the impo&s;&s;ibility of Gods pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">doning &s;inners without a &s;atisfaction.</Q></P>
<P N="6">VI. <Q>Since Chri&s;t could not pay what was not his own [debt] it follows, that in the payment of his own, the ca&s;e &s;till remains equally greivous, &s;ince the debt is not hereby ab&s;olved or forgiven, but transferred only, and by con&s;equence we are no better provided for &s;alvation then before, owing that now to the Son which was once owing to the Father.</Q> Thus <HI>William Penn,</HI> with much more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In pag. 62. I find this <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> puffing out a bag of wind at me (as his term is) for adding the word [<HI>Debt</HI>] to <HI>W. P</HI>'s la&s;t Paragraph between the Crotchets. But it being nine years &s;ince I wrote that Book, he mentions, I know not whether I added the word or took it &s;o from another impre&s;&s;ion, of <HI>W. P's</HI> however, now I own I have added it, and here offer to &s;tand or fall by the Judgment of all good <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> whether I have done ill therein, or not; yea, let any <HI>Quaker</HI> &s;hew, if he can, wherein it alters the &s;ence of the pa&s;&s;age.

Ps</HI> words bear the &s;ame &s;en&s;e either with or without that word [<HI>Debt</HI>] 'Tis only more plain with the wore <HI>Debt,</HI> to mean capacities. For 'tis nothing el&s;e but the <HI>Debt</HI> of our &s;ins that <HI>W. P.</HI> there treats on. And Chri&s;t did pay a <HI>Debt</HI> that was not his own, but ours, otherwi&s;e we had peri&s;hed eternally: This is <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity,</HI> contrary to <HI>W.Ps.</HI> Anti-chri&s;tian Notion, <HI>That Chri&s;t could not pay what was not his own.</HI> And I would de&s;ire the <HI>Quakers</HI> to tell in their next print, What it was that Chri&s;t was to pay, or did pay, of his own, as <HI>W. P.</HI> there words it (&s;eeing he denys that he paid any thing for us) and why they were &s;o civil as not to &s;ay a word to that other agreeable pa&s;&s;age which I quoted from <HI>R. Huberthorns</HI> works, pag. 20. where he affirms, <HI>Chri&s;t was capable of Repen|tance.</HI> This they thought was ea&s;ie&s;t an&s;wered by &s;ilence. But pray tell us, what had Chri&s;t to repent of, or what did Chri&s;t owe to God of his own? And whether the&s;e &s;ayings do not &s;mell too rank of bla&s;phemy with good <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> though by deceitful Arts you may hide it from your Followers:</P>
<P>But tho' <HI>C. P.</HI> &s;pends &s;everal pages to Banter me for adding this word [<HI>Debt</HI>] yet within 4 pages he him&s;elf is guilty of the &s;ame thing, <HI>viz.</HI> of adding words to a pa&s;&s;age of <HI>W.

<P><HI>Note,</HI> he calls on me for &s;atisfaction, becau&s;e the word [<HI>Debt</HI>] was added, as afore&s;aid, though between Crotchets, only to make the pa&s;&s;age more intelligible to mean readers.

<P>But this <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> is Jack on both &s;ides, for as here he adds words, &s;o I find (in pag. 8. of the la&s;t part of his book) he takes words out of a pa&s;&s;age of <HI>G.

<P>Well, &s;eeing <HI>C. P.</HI> has &s;o good a hand at mincing and mending bla&s;phemy, there is ju&s;t &s;uch another piece of work for him to mend of the &s;ame <HI>G.

Coal, viz.</HI> <Q>How deplorable a thing is it (&s;ays he) to &s;ee &s;uch hypocritical intruders (<HI>viz.</HI> Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ters) &s;tand in a Pulpet with &s;uch a brazen faced Book as is their unju&s;t corrupt and per|ver&s;e Bible in their hands.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> here <HI>J. C.</HI> in the fir&s;t place (and then the other <HI>Quakers</HI> who again reprinted it &s;ince <HI>J C's</HI> death) joyns with the mo&s;t prophane Papi&s;t thus to bla&s;pheme our Bible. For in page 40. <HI>Coal</HI> declares po&s;itive, That it does not concern him to an&s;wer it. No, he brings it as an Arrow from the Papi&s;ts Quiver, and &s;hoots it at the Bible, and then leaves it to the Prote&s;tants to think what they plea&s;e of it. And yet they would &s;eem now to be a&s;hamed of it, but will not blame their Prophet <HI>J. C.</HI> and the other <HI>Quakers</HI> for &s;everal times Printing it again&s;t our Mini&s;ters and the Bible, which &s;till &s;hews they only de&s;ign to deceive.</P>
<P>I Now come to the la&s;t part of his Book, being his Reply to the <HI>My&s;tery of Fox-Craft,</HI> and find in page 6. that he &s;ays, <HI>G. Fox</HI> did not a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf the compiling of that Book called, <HI>The Battledoor</HI> of the interpretation of about thirty Languages, but that it was <HI>J. Stubs</HI> and <HI>B. Furley</HI> that put <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Name to the &s;everal pages of that Book.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> this &s;till confirms &amp; di&s;covers it to be a Cheat put upon the World; for el&s;e why &s;hould another man put his Name to what he is not the Author of, nor does not under&s;tand? Thus it comes out by little and little; for it being found out that <HI>Fox</HI> had not the gift of Tongues, as the poor <HI>Quakers</HI> to my certain knowledge (I for one) were made to believe; he is therefore forced to this half confe&s;&s;ion, that tho' <HI>Fox</HI> did it not, yet that it was done however by the Quakers, <HI>i. e. Stubs</HI> and <HI>Furley.</HI> But this is al&s;o a cheat or lye, for they hired a <HI>Jew</HI> to do the greate&s;t part of it, or procure it to be done, and gave him eighty Pounds in Money for his pains, and there was al&s;o
<PB N="14" REF="001248_0014_0FB18B66336AEB08">
twelve bottles of Wine given over and above to make the <HI>Jew</HI> and his a&s;&s;ociates drink. And here the <HI>Fox</HI> is found out in his &s;illy craft in preach|ing down the Wi&s;dom and Learning of the world, and yet deceitfully made u&s;e of it to rai&s;e his own fame.</P>
<P>In page 14. he finds a real fault in my Book the date of the year of the di&s;pute of <HI>G. F</HI> is printed 1699 in&s;tead of 1659. &s;o in my this years Alma|nack <HI>John Benn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> is printed for <HI>John H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lliard,</HI> which are e&s;capes of the Pre&s;s, and <HI>C. P's.</HI> Books are incident thereto as well as mine.</P>
<P><Q>In the &s;ame page he brings on the Oath of Abjuration, by which the <HI>Quakers</HI> of the Council and A&s;&s;embly of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> engaged to Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> to defend the Queen and her Succe&s;&s;ors to the utmo&s;t of their power again&s;t all their Enemies, and that as <HI>defend</HI> is commonly under&s;tood too; and yet, at the &s;ame time declared they could neither fight nor pay towards it, <HI>i. e.</HI> neither do it in P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;on nor E&s;tate.</Q></P>
<P>Now I de&s;ired him to tell me how the <HI>Quakers</HI> could do this, and promi&s;ed him a reward if he could tell me; But I find it has driven him into a Net. He &s;ays, page 15. he is no way obliged to tell me how. No, he is not obliged; Why? becau&s;e he nor all the <HI>Quakers</HI> in the world have not art enough to do it. And thus they are confounded, being &s;elf condemned.</P>
<P>And whereas I had &s;hewed how binding and po&s;itive the Act of Abjuration was made, and the <HI>Quakers</HI> had made a Provi&s;o to make it all void, therefore he argues that they (the <HI>Quakers</HI>) do in that no more then is common for Kings and Parliments, to do [No, they have done no more] For he &s;ays, Kings, Paliaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> often in their Laws, after po&s;itive commandings, make perticular Provi&s;o's for mitigating, <HI>&amp;c. Note,</HI> Here they mu&s;t &s;et them&s;elves up tantamount with Kings and Parliaments, and becau&s;e the Queen and Parliament had made no Provi&s;o in that Law, therefore the <HI>Quakers</HI> may do it. Why? becau&s;e 'tis common for Kings, &amp;c. to do it. This &s;hews the height of the &s;phere wherein the&s;e Saints imagine them&s;elves to move, even to be Controulers of the Laws of Kings and Parliaments, at lea&s;t here they wou'd be, and this they have declared to be their Right and Heir&s;hip, as I have el&s;e where &s;hewed.</P>
<P>His in&s;inuating, That I have broke my Oath, as a Councillor, in publi&s;h|ing it, and that the Governour is concern'd to take notice of me. That is, my printing how the <HI>Quakers</HI> had taken this Abjuration Oath, which was done in the face of Country and Coffee-Hou&s;e News the &s;ame week, he would have to be a breaking my Oath as a Councillor. This only bewrayes the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit; it will &s;hew its grining Teeth &s;ometimes. I pray God keep them from having power to bite me as they did poor <HI>Banks,</HI> one of their Oppo&s;ers, who they catcht carrying his goods on hor&s;es through <HI>Pen&s;ilvania,</HI> and ca&s;t him into <HI>Philadelphia</HI> Pri&s;on, and took his Goods from him, even his whole e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Next, comes on their Reply to what I a&s;&s;erted, how &s;ome <HI>Quakers</HI> near <HI>Burlington</HI> took up arms on a report that a party of <HI>French</HI> were near. And they bring long certificates &amp; denying the matter, as if they were

mumbling of thi&s;tles. And tho' they quibble, and are in &s;ome things Comical, intimating that their Guns and other Weapons that they carried were only to &s;care folk, and to hurt no body, and that they fight only with &s;piritual Weapons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet becau&s;e they deny not the thing in &s;ub&s;tance, as charged, and having &s;poke to it in my Almanack, I therefore di&s;mi&s;s this head, with only giving a quotation from the great <HI>Fox</HI> him&s;elf, &s;hewing what they in|tended again&s;t worldly Powers, when time &s;erves, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Note,</HI> Some may &s;ay, here is bloody work, had it gone on, and <HI>Oliver</HI> turned <HI>Quaker.</HI> But let us not mi&s;take, did they not mean all this to be Spiritual, and Spiritual Weapons?</P>
<P><HI>I An&s;wer;</HI> No; for in page 19. the Interpretation is plain <Q>So you mu&s;t be cut down (&s;ays <HI>Fox</HI>) with the &s;ame Power that cut down the King (meaning <HI>K.

<P>Next, as to <HI>Magi&s;tracy,</HI> which they ever accounted a cumber&s;om Tree, and therefore hear what they intend again&s;t it, pag. 20.</P>
<P><Q>Sing all ye Saints (<HI>viz.

<P><HI>Note,</HI> This may be compared with what I have (in print) formerly &s;hewed how that their cheif Prophets have a&s;&s;erted the Right and Heir&s;hip of the <HI>Quakers</HI> to all the Kingdoms and Dominions under the whole Heavens, and that their King (the <HI>Light within</HI>) may Command them to fight for it, though, they &s;ay, they believe he will not yet make u&s;e of them in that way, not for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In pag. 21. he begins to mu&s;ter up a troop of fal&s;hoods again&s;t me, every one of which returns upon his own head. As for in&s;tance; I had &s;aid, pag. 5. of <HI>Mi&s;tery of Fox-Craft,</HI> That we &s;ee by <HI>G Fox's</HI> fir&s;t Letter, he could not write the date of the year. Now this <HI>C. P.</HI> &s;ays is fal&s;e. But I will let the Reader &s;ee 'tis true; for that which <HI>Fox</HI> writes for the date of
<PB N="16" REF="001248_0016_0FB18B691F5E5D70">
the year is thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">9. Here let all men judge whether it does not appear by this that <HI>Fox</HI> did not know how to write the date of the year. Now when this <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> has made me Satisfaction for this abu&s;e, I will &s;hew him wherein he is as fal&s;e in every one of the re&s;t; for to what edification can it be to make Replyes to &s;uch a profu&s;e Scribler, to &s;uch incon&s;iderable Lyes? But this is his method throughout, as if he were po&s;&s;e&s;t with the Spirit of <HI>Baal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> two lying Prophets.</P>
<P>I had told him how he copyed after the <HI>London Quakers,</HI> in his an&s;wers to me; Therefore that he may make a Book of &s;omething, he writes &s;everal pages to &s;hew that I have al&s;o copyed after the Author of the <HI>Snake, G. K. &amp;c.</HI> Alas for him! have I not told him, that I cannot do better than to follow the example of good men. But for a <HI>Quaker</HI> to copy after other men is <HI>Conjuration,</HI> by their own doctrine; for <HI>G. F</HI> in <HI>Saul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Errand,</HI> pag. 7. &s;ays, <HI>What is not &s;poken from the mouth of God, is Conjuration.</HI> Therefore if he had no where copyed after others (as I would &s;hew he has, if it would edify) yet he is &s;till as much a Conjurer, if all he has written be not immediately from the mouth of God; and that it is not, I have &s;ufficiently &s;hewed, unle&s;s from the mouth of the God of lyes. And thus this Conjurer imploys his time to &s;et up a man of &s;traw, that he may have &s;omething to fight again&s;t</P>
<P>In the Margent of the <HI>Mi&s;try of Fox-Craft,</HI> pag. 4 there is a touch of the uncleanne&s;s of their Preachers; therefore to be even with us, he tell me, pag. 21. that if it was their way, they could al&s;o calumniate &s;ome Clergy|men among us for Mi&s;carriages (and then in&s;tances <HI>Rode-I&s;land</HI> Mini&s;ter) But thanks his God, that has taught them otherways. Behold, the deceipt, the confu&s;ion of this; for here even with the &s;ame breath he throws a &s;ecret calumny on <HI>Rode-I&s;land</HI> Mini&s;ter, and yet &s;ays, 'tis not their way, their God has taught them otherways. This &s;hews what &s;ort of a God it is that has taught them, even the God of lyes</P>
<P>But by the way, let me tell the&s;e <HI>Quakers,</HI> That the Clergy and <HI>Quaker</HI>-Preachers are under different Circum&s;tances: The Clergy know them&s;elves (and ALL men) to be frail &s;inners, often drawn by Temptations into &s;in, and therefore find a continual need of praying to God for Pardon, upon Repentance. But this the <HI>Quaker</HI>-Preachers di&s;claim, they are two proud. <HI>W. Penn</HI> mocks at our Liturgy for having a confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in in it. And you &s;ee before that <HI>G. F.</HI> calls it the doctrine of Devils to acknowledge a being in a warfare while we be on earth; Nay, he declares, That they (the <HI>Quakers</HI>) are Perfect in Equality with God (as you &s;ee before) This is a de&s;perate and deplorable &s;tate for poor mortals to be po&s;&s;e&s;t with: 'Tis the height of Lu|cifers Pride. Therefore 'tis upon this account, that we &s;ometimes expo&s;e their failings, to &s;hew them their &s;ins; for there is no other way to humble them. But if they would come down upon the level with other mortals, to own them&s;elves &s;inners, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.8, 9. and pray for pardon; I &s;hould then think it a great evil to expo&s;e the private failings of any of them.</P>
<P>But as to his thanking God that has taught them otherways than to

<P>THe learned <HI>Robert Barclay,</HI> who&s;e Apology the <HI>Quakers</HI> have revi&s;ed, amended and re-printed in great Numbers (and given of them to the Nobility, Gentry and Clergy of <HI>England,</HI> about eight or ten Thou&s;and) as their Standard, in&s;tead of the Works of their FOX-Apo&s;tle, which I hear they have let fall, after they were upon the Stocks, as if they would (to &s;ave whole their Infallibility, &s;ilently &s;lip by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of their Bla&s;phemy and Non-&s;ence, and &s;hape it up in a more artificial Trim, as the Proverb &s;ays, <HI>Older and Wi&s;er.</HI></P>
<P>But yet, I mu&s;t here let them know, that their learned <HI>Barclay</HI>'s Writings afford us &s;ufficient Proof of the Impo&s;&s;ibility of Reconci|ling <HI>Quakeri&s;m</HI> to <HI>Christianity.</HI> The Author of the <HI>Snake, &amp;c.</HI> pag. 183, 185. of his &s;econd, <HI>Defence,</HI> gives us a notable In&s;tance about his confounding <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> and <HI>Sanctification,</HI> making them both to be one, and performed within men; whereas <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> makes them to be different things: <HI>Justification</HI> being wrought by Chri&s;t in his own Per&s;on, wholly without us, and but once performed; but <HI>Sanctification</HI> is the Work of Chri&s;t by his holy Spirit in our hearts, and daily to be renewed.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here give you another In&s;tance from the &s;aid <HI>R. B</HI>'s Works, and wou'd have the <HI>Quakers</HI> try their Wits to &s;ee if they can recon|cile the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>R. B.</HI> pag. 895. of his Works, affirms, <Q>That the Hi&s;torical Faith and Knowledge of Chri&s;t, is not commonly given to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> or to be expected by them, or any others, by the Spirit, but by the Scriptures.</Q></P>
<P>But in contradiction to this, p. 48. he affirms, <Q>That the Spirit teaches every true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> what&s;oever is needful for him to know. &mdash; By this Light of God [in the heart] all true knowledge in &s;pi|ritual things is revealed. <HI>Prop.</HI> X.</Q></P>
<P>Then back again, pag. 95, 96. he affirms, <Q>That the Hi&s;torical knowledge or outward profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t is ab&s;olutly nece&s;&s;ary to be believed, where God affords the Opportunity of knowing it; &mdash; Yea (&s;ays he) it were a damnable Unbelief not to believe it, when declared.</Q></P>

<P>This hi&s;torical belief is not given to men by the &s;pirit.</P>

<P>There is an in&s;tance in page 170 of his <HI>Apology,</HI> That &s;hews his accom|pli&s;hment in Quaker-Pride.

Thus while they Banter others for Pride in wearing Lace and Ribands, they them&s;elves are po&s;&s;e&s;t with the mo&s;t abhorrent Pride of Lucifer.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Behold a mon&s;trous cla&s;h of <HI>Quakeri&s;m</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> between <HI>R. B.</HI> and <HI>W.

As for in&s;tance, <HI>John Saltkill,</HI> a Preacher of Renown, lately come from <HI>England,</HI> who, when he was in this Country before, being at the hou&s;e of <HI>Sam.

<P>Again, <HI>T.
