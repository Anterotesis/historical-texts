<P>IN the <HI>Context</HI> we have a Record of the glo|rious Beginning of King <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> Reign.

<P>We may here remark,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Character of the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> concerned, <HI>He|zekiah</HI> and the <HI>Levites:</HI> On both &s;ides <HI>Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction,</HI> the <HI>One</HI> in Civil, the <HI>Other</HI> in Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Office. <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was no le&s;s than the <HI>King of Judah,</HI> the Supream Civil Ruler: the <HI>Levites</HI> were
<PB N="3" REF="001346_0006_0FB2C71E0C5159D0">Mini&s;ters of Religion, after the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> the Sons of <HI>Aaron;</HI> the <HI>Tribe</HI> whom God had &s;eparated and con&s;ecrated to Him&s;elf out of all <HI>I&s;real to do the Service of the Tabernacle.</HI> So that the Civil &amp; Sa|cred <HI>Orders</HI> are here together, the <HI>Prince</HI> and the <HI>Prophet,</HI> the Ruler in the <HI>State,</HI> and the Holy Teachers in the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let us attend unto the <HI>thing related</HI> as pa&s;&s;ing between them, which is the <HI>Kings</HI> &s;peaking Com|fortably unto the <HI>Levites.</HI> The like we read in the 35. <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. <HI>v.</HI> of <HI>Jo&s;iah, that he &s;et the Prie&s;ts in their charges, and Encourag'd them to the Service of the Hou&s;e of the Lord.</HI> His Dignity made this Conde|&s;cention in the &s;ight of men, yet was it but &s;trict Piety and Duty to God. He might have requir'd 'em only with the &s;tern Maje&s;ty of a King, but as became his Devotion he mildly &amp; kindly be&s;poke 'em, with a &s;weet and gracious Affability. His Countenance, his Behaviour, and all his Words did abundantly expre&s;s his Royal Favour &amp; Grace toward 'em, for their Incouragement in their Holy Mini&s;trations. Nor are we to interpret the&s;e Comfortable Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Good Words</HI> only, <HI>Be ye warmed, be ye filled;</HI> without the &s;ub&s;tantial fruits of a <HI>Princes</HI> Favour &amp; Care. Much le&s;s may we think them like the <HI>Empty Re&s;pects,</HI> flatteries &amp; promi&s;es of <HI>Modern Courtiers;</HI> but all was Cordial, unfeigned &amp; from the Heart: As we may read in the 31. <HI>Chap.</HI> 21. <HI>v.</HI> that <HI>in every work, which he began in the Ser|vice of the Hou&s;e of God, and in the Law, and in the Commandments to &s;eek his God, he did it with all his heart, and pro&s;pered.</HI> Wherefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>real Rea&s;on of this Princely Grace</HI> of the
<PB N="4" REF="001346_0007_0FB2C721A6A9B098"><HI>King</HI> is &s;ubjoyned, and that is, <HI>the Levites teaching the good Knowledge of the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> is taken partly from their <HI>Office,</HI> more e&s;pecially from their <HI>Fidelity</HI> therein: And &s;o it an&s;wers the <HI>Apo&s;tolick Precept, E&s;teeming them very highly in Love for their Works &s;ake.</HI> It was one part of the <HI>Levites</HI> Office to <HI>in&s;truct</HI> the People in the Knowledge and Fear of God: their work was to <HI>teach:</HI> which reproves and condemns the <HI>Idle Pa&s;tor,</HI> who <HI>Labours</HI> not <HI>in the Word and Doctrine,</HI> to feed their Flocks with Saving Knowledge, And <HI>King Hezekiahs</HI> regard to the <HI>Teaching Levite</HI> may well call to Mind the like <HI>Royal Examples,</HI> which have blazon'd the <HI>Briti&s;h Throne,</HI> in our late <HI>Sovereign Princes,</HI> who have re|quir'd their <HI>Highe&s;t Prelates</HI> to be frequent in Preaching the <HI>Word</HI> Them&s;elves; promoting at the &s;ame time &s;uch unto their Riche&s;t and Noble&s;t <HI>Sees,</HI> as were de&s;irous of teaching the People the Knowledge of God. In the day when <HI>Popery ab|dicated the Throne, Princes</HI> like holy <HI>Hezekiah</HI> a&s;cend|ed it, and they <HI>&s;pake Comfortably,</HI> and to this day continue the &s;ame Gracious Expre&s;&s;ions to all the <HI>Levites</HI> that teach the Good Knowledge of the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>The Good Knowledge:</HI> Knowledge is Good: <HI>Prov.</HI> 19 2. <HI>That the Soul be without Knowledge is not Good:</HI> But of all Knowledge none is like that which we have of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed GOD</HI> from his <HI>Word:</HI> Of <HI>this</HI> we may &s;ay, as our <HI>Saviour</HI> &s;aid of <HI>God, Why call</HI> we <HI>any</HI> other <HI>Good? there is none Good &s;ave</HI> that <HI>One, which is</HI> of <HI>GOD.</HI> They that teach this good Knowledge faithfully, are to be held among Men eminently Good, <HI>Worthy of double Honour,</HI> meriting to be
<PB N="5" REF="001346_0008_0FB2C72590A12808">&s;poken <HI>Comfortably</HI> unto by their <HI>Princes</HI> &amp; <HI>Rulers:</HI> Each of them &s;ingly, and all of them together, do merit this treatment and a &s;ingular Regard: And accordingly, tho' the <HI>Text denies not</HI> but that the <HI>King</HI> might <HI>frown</HI> upon the <HI>Idle and Vicious Levite,</HI> if there were any One &s;o; yet is it <HI>expre&s;s</HI> on the other hand, that he &s;pake comfortably to <HI>all</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Levites,</HI> that did <HI>faithfully</HI> teach the Good Know|ledge of the Lord.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE I wou'd offer from the <HI>Words</HI> is this.</P>
<P><HI>That it is a very Noble &amp; Pious Di&s;po&s;ition in Civil Rulers, and their Incumbent Duty, to Comfort and Encourage the faithful Mini&s;ters of</HI> CHRIST <HI>in their Holy Work.</HI></P>
<P>Before I add a Word more, I have a double <HI>Pre&s;umption to Apologize</HI> for; that I &s;hou'd pre&s;ume to <HI>Preach</HI> to, or to <HI>plead</HI> for, my <HI>Superiors</HI> of <HI>both Orders.</HI> I am very &s;en&s;ible that a <HI>Concio ad Ma|gi&s;tratum</HI> calls for Learning, Gravity &amp; Authority much beyond my Years, and that the <HI>Noble Sub|ject (Pro Clere)</HI> does equally require the &s;ame. Yet I hope it will not be unacceptable at this time to Either <HI>Order,</HI> if I e&s;&s;ay with all po&s;&s;ible Defe|rence and Humility, to a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Honours</HI> which it has plea&s;ed God to entitle his <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> unto, &amp; which it will be the Care and <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> of pious <HI>Rulers</HI> al|ways to pay unto them.</P>
<P>Wherefore I beg the leave of this <HI>Honourable Au|dience</HI> to per&s;ue a little the&s;e two <HI>Enquiries.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>How</HI> Civil Rulers are to endeavour the Com|fort
<PB N="6" REF="001346_0009_0FB2C7267291FBE0">and Encouragement of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Why</HI> they &s;hou'd do it, or what are their Ob|ligations hereunto. The <HI>Enquiries</HI> are both <HI>Co|pious,</HI> and being to get <HI>ha&s;tily</HI> thro' them I mu&s;t be brief and <HI>general.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>How, or which way, are Civil Rulers to endea|vour the Comfort of the Mini&s;try?</HI> or, What is <HI>the Comfort</HI> which the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> craves or challenges of them by the Laws of the Go&s;pel? What is it that will comfort the faithful <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ers</HI> of the Word, and what are the <HI>Regards</HI> which for this end the <HI>Civil Ruler</HI> owes unto the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Order?</P>
<P>To apprehend this aright, we mu&s;t con&s;ider our <HI>Rulers</HI> in their <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI> Power or Tru&s;t, and in their <HI>Executive,</HI> and finally in a <HI>Per&s;onal</HI> and more <HI>Private</HI> Character, as <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of a <HI>Superior Degree</HI> only.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>In their Legi&s;lative power and tru&s;t,</HI> it belongs to the Civil Ruler to &s;peak comfortably to the Mi|ni&s;try, <HI>by Enacting Good LAWS for the Honour and E&s;tabli&s;hment of Religion within their Government.</HI> This lies near the heart of every good man; and one of the greate&s;t Comforts he can have that wi&s;hes well to the Religion of a Place, aiming at the Glory of God and the Salvation of Souls, is to &s;ee a <HI>Bulwark of good Laws</HI> for the defence &amp; pro|pagation of the Truths and Laws of God. The&s;e Laws mu&s;t needs re&s;pect,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Publick <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> of God, both Natural and In&s;tituted.</ITEM>

1. The Comfort of the Mini&s;try depends very much on good and right <HI>Laws re&s;pecting the Publick Wor&s;hip of God, and that both Natural &amp; In&s;tituted:</HI> that the <HI>Holy Ordinances</HI> of God be duly admini&s;tred and attended according to His Appointment in His Word. Indeed <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> may not <HI>frame</HI> and invent at their plea&s;ure <HI>Modes</HI> and Exerci&s;es of Divine Wor&s;hip for their People: GOD by whom They rule has given Them &amp; Us a <HI>Law</HI> how He will be Wor&s;hip'd: to <HI>alter</HI> this or to <HI>add</HI> unto it were to offer <HI>Strange Fire</HI> for hallowed Incen&s;e and with the face of Homage manife&s;tly to kick at his Soverain Authority, de&s;pi&s;ing his mo&s;t per|fect Word. Nor may the Ruler <HI>invade the Prie&s;t, Office to Officiate in their Holy Mini&s;trations,</HI> unto which they are <HI>Ordain'd.</HI> It was unto <HI>Uzziahs</HI> de&s;truction that his <HI>heart was lifted up to tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t the Lord his God,</HI> when he went into the Temple of the Lord <HI>to burn Inten&s;e upon the Altar of Incen&s;e:</HI> 2 Chron. xxvi. 16,&mdash;21. Nor was it Di&s;|loyalty or Rebellion in <HI>Azariah the Prie&s;t</HI> and his valiant <HI>Brethren</HI> when they <HI>with&s;tood</HI> him, and &s;aid unto him, <HI>It pertaineth not unto thee Uzziah to burn Incen&s;e unto the Lord, but to the Prie&s;ts the Sons of Aa|ron, that are con&s;ecrated to burn Incen&s;e: Go out of the Sanctuary, for thou ha&s;t tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed, neither &s;hall it be for thine Honour from the Lord God:</HI> And when he de&s;|pis'd the faithful admonition, being <HI>Inrag'd</HI> at it, <HI>The Lord &s;mote him be&s;ide the.

Now tho' this <HI>In&s;tance</HI> alone be eno' to warn the <HI>Highe&s;t Per&s;ons</HI> unto all po&s;&s;ible caution, not to tre&s;pa&s;s upon the <HI>Inclo&s;ures of Gods Mini&s;try,</HI> con&s;ecrated to <HI>Divine Service;</HI> Neverthe|le&s;s we mu&s;t by no means think that the <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> has nothing to do, or to concern him&s;elf <HI>ex Officio,</HI> about the <HI>In&s;titutions of God.</HI> The <HI>Civil Powers</HI> may Enact the very Laws of God about his own Wor|&s;hip under temporal <HI>Penalties,</HI> pre&s;erving an <HI>Indul|gence</HI> unto tender Con&s;ciences: They may take Laws out of the Word of God and make 'em their <HI>Own,</HI> Commanding People to <HI>regard</HI> the holy <HI>Or|dinances</HI> of God, to <HI>get</HI> &amp; <HI>uphold</HI> his <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> among them, to <HI>Sanctifie the Sabbath,</HI> to <HI>reverence</HI> Gods <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> to <HI>build</HI> them&s;elves <HI>decent places</HI> for the Publick Wor&s;hip, and <HI>frequent</HI> them in the &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons thereof with Solemnity.</P>
<P>It belongs al&s;o to the Rulers Province, to pro|vide that <HI>Mini&s;ters do their Duty</HI> in the Publick Ad|mini&s;trations that pertain unto their Office; that neither by <HI>gro&s;s Neglects,</HI> Unrea&s;onable <HI>Ab&s;ence</HI> from their <HI>Charge, Non-re&s;idence,</HI> open <HI>Idlene&s;s,</HI> or any Scandalous cour&s;e of <HI>Vice,</HI> they <HI>do not defeat</HI> the glo|rious De&s;ign of their Mini&s;try: in all which <HI>Ca&s;es</HI> the Civil Cognizance is merited, and needed to rebuke and remedy the Evil; and Rulers ought to provide accordingly in &s;ubordination to the Laws of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> provided in that ca&s;e already. So that if the <HI>Sons of Eli</HI> will make them&s;elves <HI>Vile,</HI> to cau&s;e men to <HI>abhor</HI> the Offering of the Lord, it is duty of the <HI>Judge in I&s;rael,</HI> tho' he be their <HI>Father,</HI> to pro|vide them not only a <HI>light</HI> Rebuke, but a &s;evere Cen&s;ure, Degradation and Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001346_0012_0FB2C72AF3D8BC50">
In all &s;uch Ca&s;es both Mini&s;ters and People <HI>owe Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to the Civil Ruler, as in our <HI>Context</HI> the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and the <HI>Levites</HI> obeyed the Summons of the <HI>King,</HI> and did the thing which he requir'd in the cau&s;e of God and agreeable to his Will: xxix. <HI>Chap.</HI> 15. <HI>v. And they gathered their Brethren, and Sanctify'd them&s;elves, and came according to the Commandment of the King, by the Word of the Lord.</HI> Being that the Kings Commandment was according to and grounded on the Law of God, they con&s;cientiou&s;ly obey'd it, in deference both to God and the King.</P>
<P>Nor are the Holy Sons of <HI>Levi</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> duly <HI>comforted</HI> in the work of the Lord, in their Serving at the Tabernacle and Temple, unle&s;s the Civil Power do thus engage on their &s;ide.

<P>God has honour'd Rulers above others, and He expects that they do more than others to honour Him.

1. <HI>It addre&s;&s;es to our, Civil Rulers, that Religion may always have this Countenance and Comfort from them.</HI></P>
<P>We cannot but own the Piety of our Rulers in their open and avowed Re&s;pects unto the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the holy <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> of them. We give thanks to God, for the Great Comfort we have in the <HI>Devotion</HI> and bright <HI>Vertue</HI> of many of our <HI>Magi&s;trates;</HI> for the Good <HI>Laws</HI> we have in defence of the Faith and Wor&s;hip of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and again&s;t Scandalous Immoralities; and that the <HI>Seats of Judgment</HI> are fill'd with Men of known Integrity and Religious Zeal.</P>
<P>We have Great <HI>Con&s;olation</HI> in <HI>His</HI> EXCELLEN|CIES <HI>Noble Example;</HI> His Wi&s;e, Grave, and Occa|&s;ionally Religious Conver&s;ation; the vi&s;ible Order and Devotion of his Hou&s;e, and his tender Father|ly Carriage, toward the <HI>Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t;</HI> Of the Body of <HI>Whom</HI> I have this mo&s;t &s;ure and certain Knowledge, that they are greatly comforted in Him.</P>
<P>In the Times of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Super&s;tition, I am told, it was the fir&s;t Propo&s;al or Enquiry at the opening of the <HI>Parliament, What more is to be done for the Holy Mother the Church?</HI> Far be it, that in our happyer Days of <HI>Reform'd Religion,</HI> the Mini&s;try and <HI>Pure</HI> Wor&s;hip of God &s;hou'd have le&s;s of the <HI>Le|gi&s;lators</HI> Care.

More e&s;pecially, the more Honourable Support of <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> thro' the Land wou'd be one mo&s;t worthy Care of the <HI>A&s;&s;embly.</HI> I &s;peak not from Want, or for any <HI>Self-Intere&s;t,</HI> being by the good Providence of God, and the Care of my <HI>Beloved Church,</HI> equal in <HI>Salary</HI> with any of my <HI>Brethren:</HI> But I &s;peak from a tender feeling of the <HI>Slender</HI> Circum&s;tances of Many (my <HI>Betters</HI>) in other Places; and from an ea&s;y fore-&s;ight of the Detri|ment that mu&s;t come unto our Churches, if there be not an Inlargement in the Maintenance of the Mini&s;try in mo&s;t Places. For as this is in the People a too palpable Evidence of a <HI>Lean</HI> Profe&s;|&s;ion, I mean of their not profiting by the Word; So is it the ready way to make lean and <HI>Poor</HI> Preaching, by Starving mens <HI>Parts</HI> &amp; Oppre&s;&s;ing their <HI>Graces.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Poverty of the Land is no Objection</HI> again&s;t doing more than is done for the <HI>Mini&s;try.</HI> People might do much more and not feel it. Nay it were the way to grow Rich, if we did our Duty in Supporting Honourably the Wor&s;hip of God. For as it is the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of God that maketh rich, &s;o He has told his People that their defrauding Him is their own Impoveri&s;hment: <HI>Mal.</HI> iii. 8, 9, 10. <HI>Ye have robbed ME, &mdash; in Tithes and Offerings: Ye are cur&s;ed with a cur&s;e. &mdash; Bring ye all the Tithes into the Store-hou&s;e, that there may be meat in my Hou&s;e, and prove me now here-with, &s;aith the LORD of Ho&s;ts, if I will not open you the Windows of Heaven, and pour you out a Ble&s;&s;ing, that there &s;hall not be room eno' to re|ceive it.</HI></P>

Again, <HI>There is no fear of the Idlene&s;s, Pride or Luxury of the Clergy,</HI> from that decent and ju&s;t Maintenance I am pleading for. I plead for no Sumptuou&s;ne&s;s or Exce&s;s, but bare Convenience. And if Profe&s;&s;ors of the Go&s;pel are again&s;t this, their Devotion is too much like what the <HI>Fable</HI> tells of the <HI>Illiberal Bi&s;hops</HI> Ble&s;&s;ing, not amounting in real Value unto the price of a <HI>Farthing.</HI></P>
<P>We ought with Thankfulne&s;s to acknowledge the Piety of the <HI>Government,</HI> in the good Provi&s;ion made to Pay out of the <HI>Publick Trea&s;ury</HI> the <HI>Dues</HI> of Mini&s;ters wrongfully detained from them; and to Tax the re&s;pective <HI>Towns</HI> or <HI>Precincts</HI> in propor|tion: And we may lay it down for a <HI>Rule</HI> to us, that the Mini&s;try can never be Comfortable, while in the Settlement of <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> there continues a nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>driving Sordid Bargains about a Salary,</HI> or while after &s;ettlement they are forc'd either <HI>abjectly to beg</HI> and entreat, or <HI>re&s;olutely to &s;cuffle</HI> and fight for their Dues by &s;olemn Engagements.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not need to addre&s;s You again about the <HI>Colledge;</HI> to &s;peak comfortably always to <HI>the Sons of the Prophets at Bethel,</HI> which has indeed been to Us as <HI>the Hou&s;e of GOD and the Gate of Heaven,</HI> for the Heavenly <HI>I&s;&s;ues</HI> thence, which have refre&s;hed the City of our God.</P>
<P>I will rather mention with great Honour the pre&s;ent Care that the <HI>Governmen</HI> is &s;hewing, with re&s;pect unto the <HI>Mi&s;erable Places of dark|ne&s;s and Irreligion,</HI> that have hitherto <HI>Shut out</HI> the Mini&s;try and Ordinances of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> from among them, counting them&s;elves unworthy of Eternal Life, Your De&s;ires and Labours after a <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> of

<P>And now, <HI>Finally,</HI> Need I again <HI>Exhort You, Much Honoured, to be Religious Your Selves,</HI> to fear the GOD by whom You rule, and to Serve Him who honours You among His People? You mu&s;t needs think Your Selves Obliged to &s;hine before Us, in all Vertue, in Devotion, in Faith, in Zeal; in a Publick re&s;pect to the In&s;titutions of Chri&s;ti|anity, and in an Abhorrence of all Immoral Practi|ces; more e&s;pecially let me &s;ay, of <HI>Frauds</HI> and di&s;hone&s;ty, of nau&s;eous <HI>Drunkenne&s;s,</HI> of <HI>Sabbath|breaking,</HI> of <HI>Unnatural Strifes</HI> in Churches, and the <HI>Contemptuous Spites of many again&s;t their holy Pa&s;tors.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us be comforted in the Countenance of our Rulers.</HI> This is a Duty al&s;o which we owe unto GOD and <HI>Them.</HI> Let us take the Comfort which God gives us; <HI>This al&s;o is the Gift of God.</HI> We have our <HI>precious Opportunities</HI> of Service: We enjoy great <HI>Quietne&s;s;</HI> and may be <HI>as Good</HI> and <HI>do</HI> as much good as we will, and have <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Powers that are:</HI> This &s;hou'd make us the <HI>Ea&s;ier</HI> under our Difficulties, and the more <HI>Chearful</HI> in our Work.

<P>Even &s;o <HI>Comfort</HI> the Hearts of your faithful <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> and you will inherit their <HI>louder and more fervent Ble&s;&s;ing:</HI> Their <HI>Invigorated Prayers</HI> for You and your Po&s;terity will come up to the <HI>Holy dwelling-place</HI> of GOD, even unto <HI>Heaven,</HI> obtain|ing the <HI>Effu&s;ion</HI> of every <HI>Sort,</HI> and every <HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> of <HI>Spiritual Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> from on <HI>High.</HI></P>
