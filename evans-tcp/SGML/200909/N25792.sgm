<P>THE POST-OFFICE is &s;o immediately dependant on the Government, that any anonymous production i&s;&s;u|ing from thence, mu&s;t be looked on as coming from the Ad|mini&s;tration it&s;elf; in this light I have viewed the anonymous paper which has been &s;o indu&s;trou&s;ly di&s;trubuted through the Po&s;t Offices of the North, avowedly to deprive me of what|ever &s;hare of your confidence I might have gained, and in this light I have given it an an&s;wer. Had I treated it with &s;ilent contempt, I &s;hould have hoped that its coming from an Admini&s;tration which had &s;o de&s;ervedly forfeited the confi|dence of every Iri&s;hman who valued the liberties of his coun|try, would have in&s;ured me from &s;uffering, in your e&s;tima|tion, from the fal&s;hood and calumny with which it abounds; but my re&s;pect for tho&s;e invaluable Cen&s;ors, the Pre&s;s and the Public Opinion, the con&s;cious integrity of my own heart, and the mo&s;t perfect reliance on the virtue of the cau&s;e I e&s;pou&s;e, prompt me to &s;eize any occa&s;ion which affords an opportunity of vindicating it or my&s;elf from the a&s;per&s;ions of an Admini&s;tration, who&s;e heavie&s;t charge, in their wretched production, is, that at any time of my life I had been the advocate of them or their mea&s;ures. As the whole of the work is one continued i&s;&s;ue of mi&s;repre&s;en|tation and fal&s;hood, a plain recital of facts will be the be&s;t means of giving it a full refutation. After the que&s;tion of Regency, that memorable di&s;play of the infamy and principles of the factions of Ireland, &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them were forced into IRISH PARLIA|MENTARY, PATRIOTISM, by being &s;tript of the wages of their pro&s;titution, I accepted a &s;eat from my uncle Lord Longueville, in the chimerical hope that this cra&s;h be|tween
