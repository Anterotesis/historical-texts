<HEAD>LOVE to our Neighbours.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>MATTHEW XXII. 39.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And the Second is like unto it, Thou &s;halt Love thy <HI>NEIGHBOUR</HI> as thy &s;elf.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_AS Love is the ground of Happine&s;s; &s;o a Spirit of Love is nece&s;&s;ary to the Happine&s;s of the Creature. We can have no Plea&s;ure in that which we Love not; whether it be good or evil. And the better the thing Loved is, and the &s;tronger the Love, the greater is the Happine&s;s of enjoying it. So it has been GOD's un|&s;peakable kindne&s;s to us, to make us &s;uch as are capable of Loving him, who is Infinitely more Excellent than all the whole Creation. And hence our Soul is ever empty
<PB N="4" REF="006372_0003_102889991AAA37B8">of its proper and &s;ufficient Happine&s;s, while it does not enjoy GOD; and cannot be truly Happy, except it Love him &s;trongly with all its Power and Strength: which cannot be without knowing his excellent Good|ne&s;s. Joh. 17.3.</P>
<P>And Hence, as GOD is Love, and Loves to make us Happy: So he has made this the Sum and Sub&s;tance of all our Duty. To <HI>Love the Lord with all our Heart and Soul,</HI> &amp;c. Mat. 22.37. So the &s;ub&s;tance of all our Duty and Happine&s;s (which are in&s;eparably joyned in one) is Love. And if we Love dutifully and happily, we &s;hall proportion our Love to every Thing according to its worth. And hence &s;hall Love GOD for his own &s;ake, and his Creatures for his &s;ake, and modify our Love to his Creatures according to their u&s;e and worth. He that had this Love is happy: he that wants it is mi&s;e|rable; tho' at pre&s;ent he perceive it not.</P>
<P>Hence the whole Law is comprized in the&s;e two Commands, To Love the Lord our GOD with our whole <HI>Heart, Soul, Mind and Strength,</HI> and to Love our Neighbour <HI>as our &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Hence when Men and Devils had by Sin forfeited their Happine&s;s, they became Angry, Malicious, Proud, Deceitful, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is bro't in (&s;ince the everla&s;ting Law) to re&s;tore &s;ome of the Children of Men to the Spirit of Love again, that they may be happy, &s;ince Chri&s;t has &s;atisfied Ju&s;tice for them. Here our LORD <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;hews which is <HI>the fir&s;t and great Command:</HI> And then &s;ays of the other, that it is <HI>like</HI> the fir&s;t. That is, we cannot be happy without it. The Spirit of not loving our Neighbour, that evil and di&s;quieted Spirit, would render us in it &s;elf unhappy, and uncapable of Communion with GOD, who is Love.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006372_0004_10288A3D4DD5FA18">
So I Ob&s;erve, The Loving our Neighbours as we love our&s;elves, is nece&s;&s;ary unto our Duty and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here <HI>in the fir&s;t Place</HI> enquire, What it is, to love our Neighbour as our&s;elves.</P>
<P>In order unto which, I lay down this Po&s;ition, <HI>viz. An Unregenerate Per&s;on, while in that State, is uncapable of keeping this Command, according to the Inten|tion of it.</HI></P>
<P>To Explain this, I add, It is a very great <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> for an Unregenerate Per&s;on to love his Neighbour as he does love him&s;elf. It is his great Duty to love his Neighbour as he <HI>ought</HI> to love him&s;elf: But not as he <HI>does</HI> love him&s;elf. I &s;hew it in the&s;e In&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1. He loves him&s;elf <HI>for his own &s;ake.</HI> He loves him|&s;elf, not under GOD, but above GOD, and his love to GOD is only for him&s;elf and for his own &s;ake. He cares not for GOD's Glory otherwi&s;e than for his own Intere&s;t. He Spiritually feeds on the forbidden Fruit continually; in &s;etting up for him&s;elf a Happine&s;s &s;epa|rate from GOD's Glory. His Religion is only to make him&s;elf ea&s;y. He &s;erves his own Con&s;cience, and not GOD.</P>
<P>Among many In&s;tances, I name one. If he think he is not Elected to Salvation, he will not &s;eek to &s;erve GOD: It appears he cares not for Him, nor for his Glory. But if he think he is Elected, then he cares as little; for he thinks he is &s;afe enough, and de&s;ires not to Glorify GOD in his Life, but to take his own Com|fort and live to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Therefore, If an Un&s;anctifyed Per&s;on love his Neigh|bour as he loves him&s;elf, he is an Idolater in doing it: He &s;ets his Neighbour in God's Stead, to be loved for his own Sake, and not for the Sake of God's Glory by him.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="006372_0005_10288A44AFA3C918">
2. An Unregenerate Per&s;on loves him&s;elf <HI>very Trea|cherou&s;ly.</HI> Becau&s;e he loves not GOD truly, therefore he loves not him&s;elf truly; for the&s;e Intere&s;ts are joyned in one by GOD in our Creation, and therefore they can|not be &s;eparated. He that is True to GOD is True to him&s;elf: And he that is Fal&s;e to GOD is Fal&s;e to him&s;elf. So are the <HI>Wicked Snared in the Work of their own Hands,</HI> P&s;al. 9.16. He Labours after Humiliation, Faith and Repentance very <HI>Unfaithfully;</HI> and hence is never made Partaker of either in Truth, but is deceived with a fal&s;e Hope. He Labours to keep off Convictions, becau&s;e he is afraid to tru&s;t his Soul with Chri&s;t, lothe to loo&s;e his ea&s;y Mind, and his good Opinion of him&s;elf. When he examines him&s;elf, <HI>Whether he be in Chri&s;t;</HI> he does it very <HI>Partially,</HI> takes every Argument to think all well, and takes off all that Condemns him: And if he yet cannot find him&s;elf in Chri&s;t, yet he is ea&s;y with fal&s;e Purpo&s;es of what he will do hereafter. So that if an Unregenerate Per&s;on love his Neighbour as he loves him&s;elf, he mu&s;t be as Treacherous to him as the Devil is, and &s;eek to lead him to Hell. Ala&s;s how many do &s;o!</P>
<P N="3">3. An Unregenerate Per&s;on's love to him&s;elf makes him love to plea&s;e him&s;elf in his Sinful Lu&s;ts (to GOD's Di&s;honour.) Some in one thing, &s;ome in another, ac|cording to their Con&s;titution and Temptations: And it is Wickedne&s;s again&s;t GOD and his Neighbours Soul, to love his Neighbour &s;o; yet how many do it, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. <HI>la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore if an Un&s;anctifyed Per&s;on love his Neigh|bour as he <HI>does</HI> love him&s;elf, it is not an Obedience to this Command of Love, but the very Rever&s;e of it.</P>
<P><HI>Yet Ob&s;erve.</HI> Some Un&s;anctifyed Men go beyond the Command, and yet keep it never the better: For they love their Neighbours <HI>better</HI> than they love them|&s;elves;
<PB N="7" REF="006372_0006_10288A463ABA1E60">e&s;pecially &s;uch as they have lea&s;t love for. For they will be angry at their Sins, and &s;eek to cro&s;s them in their Sinful Lu&s;ts, and to have them Puni&s;hed, or Convinced of the Evil of their way. A good thing when done in Obedience to this Command.</P>
<P>Having &s;hewed what is not required but forbidden in loving our Neighbours as our&s;elves. I Proceed to &s;hew in the Affirmative, what is required.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) We are to love our Neighbour from the &s;ame <HI>Motive</HI> for which we &s;hould love our&s;elves That is be|cau&s;e of GOD's Image which we &s;ee in them, and that GOD may be Glorified by them: And the more we &s;ee of this in them, (in the way wherein it is our Duty to Glorify Him) the better we are to love them. And therefore (&s;ince the Fall) almo&s;t the only Motive to love them mu&s;t be the po&s;&s;ible Hope that Peradventure the Glory of GOD in the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t may be Magnified in their Salvation. For this rea&s;on the <HI>Angels</HI> of God love us and rejoice in our Welfare, <HI>Luk.</HI> 2.14.</P>
<P>And hence, Tho&s;e we hope are brought over to Chri&s;t, and tho&s;e we hope are of GOD made In&s;tru|ments of bringing others to Chri&s;t, are to be Proporti|onally abundantly the more beloved. If you love your &s;elf <HI>Truly,</HI> you will not love your &s;elf <HI>Idolatriou&s;ly:</HI> And therefore this will be the rea&s;on why you can have any Plea&s;ure in your &s;elf. Thus you are to <HI>Love your Neighbour as your &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) We are to love our Neighbours as <HI>Truly,</HI> as <HI>Sin|cerely,</HI> and as Hone&s;tly and Uprightly, as we love our &s;elves. We are to do by them as we de&s;ire (in the way of GOD's Glory) they &s;hould do by us. <HI>Luk.</HI> 6.31. We are to be as loath to hurt our&s;elves. We are to cover his Frailties (if it may con&s;i&s;t with the good of
<PB N="8" REF="006372_0007_10288A48A0FFB160">his Soul) as carefully as we would have our own covered. We are to be as willing to help him in any need, as we wou'd de&s;ire that he &s;hould help us in like need. We are to take no Advantage of his Ignorance or Nece&s;&s;ity in dealing with him, more than we would be willing he &s;hould take of us in like Ca&s;e. My Hearers, I demand of your Con&s;cience that it do it's Office, and tell whe|ther you do &s;o or not. If you love your own Soul, Ob|&s;erve upon all &s;uch Occa&s;ions; that you may find out, whether you perform this Part of loving your <HI>Neighbour</HI> as <HI>your&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>If we love our Neighbour as our&s;elves, we are to be as truly plea&s;ed with his Pro&s;perity as with our own. We are to &s;eek no Revenge upon him for Injuries done, more than we would de&s;ire of him upon us in like Ca&s;es: Yea no more than we would have that God &s;hould take Vengeance upon us for our Sins, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.4. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4 <HI>la&s;t.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But to &s;hew the Truth on both &s;ides, lea&s;t we give it a wrong Lu&s;ter. God had given each Man a peculiar Charge of him&s;elf, we are to Eat to pre&s;erve our own Lives, we mu&s;t Believe and Repent for our&s;elves, in this &s;en&s;e, another cannot do it for us, each one mu&s;t be Saved for him&s;elf, or Damned for him&s;elf, feel Comfort for him&s;elf, and Trouble for him&s;elf, and <HI>give an account to God of him&s;elf.</HI> So we are not to exerci&s;e love in the &s;ame degree for our Neighbour as for our&s;elves, but in the &s;ame Sincerity and Truth.</P>
<P N="3">(3) If we love our Neighbours as we ought to love our&s;elves, we mu&s;t above all, &s;eek in our Capacity, to be helpful to their Souls good: for this is the greate&s;t kindne&s;s we can (in Truth) de&s;ire from our Neighbour. To help his Body is a needful Kindne&s;s, but to help his Soul, is un&s;peakably more needful; to Save him from Hell.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006372_0008_10288A4C34E25098">
<HI>Let the &s;ame Mind be in us which was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> Phi. 2.4, 5. We are bound to <HI>Exhort one another Daily,</HI> Heb. 2.17. Each one in his Capacity, &s;ome in more Publick Teaching, &s;ome in more Private Di&s;|cour&s;es, all in Praying for GOD's Ble&s;&s;ing upon Endea|vours, and all, according to their Ability, in upholding &s;uch as make it their Work to Teach the Way of Salva|tion, and in upholding them to Teach &s;uch as know not the need of it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This la&s;t is a very manife&s;t Act of loving our Neigh|bours as our&s;elves. If we do not expend to help their Peri&s;hing Souls, when God has given us to &s;ee it; How do we love them as we love our&s;elves? Or at lea&s;t as we ought to love our&s;elves? I mu&s;t think they love not them&s;elves truly, who have &s;o little love to their Neigh|bours, as to think it enough to be Saved them&s;elves, with their own Friends, and do not with their Prayers and Endeavours, all that in them lies, to Promote the &s;aving of all they can be&s;ide.</P>
<P>In the Second place I Enquire, <HI>Why</HI> we mu&s;t love our Neighbour as our&s;elves?</P>
<P N="1">[1] Becau&s;e there is the &s;ame Rea&s;on for it. He is GOD's Creature &s;o well as we, and of the &s;ame Kind. GOD may as well be Glorified in him as in us. It is as much for GOD's Honour that my Neighbour be Sa|ved, as it is that I be: And the Mi&s;ery of Hell would be as bitter to him. And if the <HI>Glory of GOD be our</HI> Reward and Trea&s;ure, then we &s;hall as truly Rejoyce to &s;ee another Glorify Him, as to do it our&s;elves.</P>
<P>If I only &s;eek to have my &s;elf and Friends Happy, and Saved, it is a Sign I love my &s;elf Separate from GOD, which is <HI>Idolatry.</HI></P>
<P N="2">[2.] If we can be happy in GOD, we have His Im|age, and if we have His Image, then it will appear in
<PB N="10" REF="006372_0009_10288A4DC35B2D38">our Practice, in Rea&s;on and <HI>Equity;</HI> and if we have not this part of His Image, then we can never enjoy Communion with him. Now their is as much Rea&s;on that my Neighbour &s;hould de&s;ire to enjoy Health and Pro&s;perity, as that I &s;hould: And as much Rea&s;on that I &s;hould wi&s;h his Good, as that he &s;hould wi&s;h mine.</P>
<P>If we Profe&s;s to be GOD's Children, and do not &s;hew His Image, by Equity and Love, we Scandalize His Glorious Name. Mat. 5.16. <HI>Let your Light &s;o &s;hine before Men, that they may &s;ee your good Works and Glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="3">[3.] The Rejoycing in the Glorious Excellencies of GOD is the Joy of Heaven. Every redeemed Soul (even the lea&s;t of all) is an In&s;tance of GOD's Glorious Redeeming Grace, and thereby an Addition to the Joy of all the re&s;t, and even of the <HI>Angels,</HI> Luk. 15.10. Thus as our own Salvation (if we have it) will be matter of Everla&s;ting Joy in the Glory of GOD; &s;o will that of our Neighbour. And hence; if we have the Grace of GOD in our Soul, we have the &s;ame Motive to de|&s;ire our Neighbours <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Salvation,</HI> which we have to de&s;ire our own.</P>
<P>From the&s;e things we may be Informed,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Rea&s;on why <HI>Love to the Brethren is</HI> a Mark of one <HI>Pa&s;&s;ed from Death to Life,</HI> 1 Joh. 3.14. Be|cau&s;e the Foundation of the Glory, Excellence and Hap|pine&s;s of a Rational Creature con&s;i&s;ts in Love, Love to GOD, and hence, Love to his Image, and Love to all that Glorifies Him. But Ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>We are not to love tho&s;e that <HI>Glorify GOD again&s;t their will,</HI> &s;uch as the Devils and Damned. We are to Rejoyce that GOD is Glorified upon them: But we owe them no good will for it. But while we have any hope that they will yet <HI>Obey the Go&s;pel of our LORD
<PB N="11" REF="006372_0010_10288A5051EEE588">JESUS CHRIST,</HI> we are to Love them with this hope and de&s;ire as Sincerely as we Love our&s;elves.</P>
<P>But when a Per&s;on appears to <HI>have</HI> Obeyed the Go&s;|pel, we are to rejoice in him, and to love him <HI>with a pure Heart Fervently</HI> in a more peculiar manner.</P>
<P>But as every Mark of Grace may be Counterfeited, &s;o this of Love to the Brethren. For Devils and wicked Men are forced to honour the Image of GOD; it car|ries a Maje&s;ty with it and <HI>a Beauty of Holine&s;s.</HI> They are Obliged to bow before it, while they hate it. Their Con&s;cience declares the good e&s;tate of &s;uch a Man. This &s;ometimes <HI>Torments</HI> them that they are not &s;o them&s;elves. <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.10. But in&s;tead of yielding <HI>Subdued,</HI> they &s;eek Eva&s;ions, and &s;trive to make them&s;elves believe it is <HI>Hy|pocri&s;y,</HI> and are glad to find Evil to &s;peak of them. A Poor way to cure their own Wound! Thus they &s;trive and take pains to go quietly to Hell, and delude their own Con&s;cience. They love them&s;elves mo&s;t Treach|erou&s;ly. So this &s;ort of Love to the Brethren is no Evi|dence of a Child of Grace, but of the very contrary.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here appears, The per&s;on who has not this Love to GOD and his Neighbour, is a <HI>Mi&s;erable</HI> unhappy Creature. He has not the Root of Happine&s;s, but of Torment. Heaven can be no Heaven to him were he there. GOD's Glory can be no Joy to him, but a Ter|ror. He has the Seed of Hell Fire in him. If he have all Knowlege, and do all the great Works in the World, and dy a <HI>Martyr,</HI> and have not this Love; it all avails him nothing, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.1, 2, 3. Heaven and Hell are as Contrary in their Inhabitants as in their Natures.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hence.</HI> The Per&s;on who &s;eeks to make his own Gain by his Neighbours Lo&s;s, walks not according to Love. And how &s;hall we know the <HI>Tree</HI> but <HI>by it's Fruit?</HI> Mat. 7.18.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006372_0011_10288A52EAD028C8">
GOD's Infinite Wi&s;dom has made our way of Living &s;o agreeable to Love (when rightly u&s;ed) that what a Man gains hone&s;tly is &s;ome way for the <HI>Publick Good,</HI> or &s;uch as deal with him are the better for it, &s;o well as him&s;elf. What the <HI>Farmer</HI> rai&s;es on his Land makes &s;o much the more Provi&s;ion in the Country. The <HI>Trades-Man</HI> &s;erves his Cu&s;tomers &s;o well as him&s;elf, and &s;upplies what is needed in the Land. The <HI>Merchant</HI> brings into the Country what it needs, and di&s;po&s;es of their Super|fluities for them. The <HI>Teacher</HI> promotes Knowlege, for the Publick Good. Thus Men need a Communion for the good of each Party, to &s;hew by Similitude the Heavenly Communion.</P>
<P>What is ours lawfully Gained, may lawfully be Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed: But what is <HI>gained</HI> by anothers Lo&s;s, in bargaining or otherwi&s;e, brings no good to the Publick, and is con|trary to the Law of <HI>Loving our Neighbour as our&s;elves;</HI> and therefore a breach of one nece&s;&s;ary Rule unto Salvation.</P>
<P>Where there is Profit on <HI>both &s;ides,</HI> Men may divide it as they can agree; but not to that degree, that &s;hall turn all the Profit to <HI>one &s;ide.</HI> But what is gained by <HI>Wagers,</HI> is a &s;infully Lo&s;t as Gained: For Men are not <HI>Lords,</HI> but only <HI>Stewards</HI> of all which GOD has lent them, and mu&s;t as well give an account how they <HI>di&s;po&s;e</HI> of it, as how they <HI>get</HI> it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Hence</HI> Such as love to &s;peak evil of their Neigh|bours more than good, have the mark of Hell upon them. They love not their Neighbours as them&s;elves. We &s;ee that Men naturally take the part of their neare&s;t Friends when they are &s;poken again&s;t, becau&s;e they have a na|tural love for them. But we &s;ee that in many Places, an evil Report (true or fal&s;e) of any Per&s;on, will &s;pread much fa&s;ter then a good Report: Whereby it appears that the mo&s;t part love not their <HI>Neighbours</HI> as them|&s;elves,
<PB N="13" REF="006372_0012_10288A568AE2BE40">but bear them an inward Hatred, or el&s;e (which is as bad) that they have an inward hatred to Holine&s;s it &s;elf (tho' they think they have it) and are glad to tell of evil Committed. My Hearers, I beg of you, Ex|amine your&s;elves. It is a Point of Life and Death. Well might our LORD tell us, <HI>There be few that find the &s;trait and narrow Way to Life,</HI> Mat. 7.14.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence we &s;ee the Rea&s;on why the Devils are of &s;uch a Malicious Angry Evil Temper. It is becau&s;e no Happine&s;s belongs to them, for they have Sinned it a|way, and &s;o their Temper is become Mi&s;erable. For <HI>Love</HI> is the Temper of Happine&s;s, and <HI>Anger</HI> or <HI>Hatred,</HI> the Temper of Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>And here we &s;ee that an <HI>Angry Contentious Wilful</HI> Temper in Men, carries the mark of Mi&s;ery and Con|demnation. What &s;hall an Angry Creature do in Heaven? Where it is <HI>all Love.</HI></P>
<P>Some vent their Anger in Religious things; and thereby not only quiet their Con&s;cience, but al&s;o build a great hope of their Grace unto Salvation: But let them read, James 3.15, 16, 17. <HI>This Wi&s;dom de|&s;cendeth not from above, but is Earthly, Sen&s;ual, Devili&s;h. For where Envying and Stife is, there is Confu&s;ion and e|very evil Work. But the Wi&s;dom that is from above is fir&s;t Pure, then Peaceable, Gentle and ea&s;y to be Intreated,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I can excu&s;e a <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> Man, who breaks out into Raptures of Anger, and cannot help it, but upon &s;econd Thot's, is grieved for it. But I know not how to ex|cu&s;e a Wilful Contentious Per&s;on, who upon Mature Tho'ts, will rather <HI>Rend</HI> the Church or Town or Neigh|bourhood than loo&s;e his will or be tho't to have been in a wrong cau&s;e. The&s;e often think they &s;tand for the Honour of GOD, when their <HI>own</HI> will at the Bottom blinds 'em to think &s;o: And their want of love to their

That <HI>Love,</HI> without which all great things are nothing, is thus De&s;cribed, 1 Cor, 13. <HI>ver.</HI> 4, 5, 6, 7. (Tran&s;lated in our Bibles, <HI>Charity) Suffereth long, and is kind; Envieth not, Vaunteth not it &s;elf, is not Puffed up, doth not Behave it &s;elf un&s;eemly, Seeketh not her own, is not ea&s;ily Provoked, thinketh no Evil,</HI> &amp;c. We ought to &s;tand <HI>firm</HI> for the Truth of Chri&s;t: But if it break out into Anger and Hatred, it is Sinfully Managed. 2 Tim. 2.25. <HI>In meekne&s;s In&s;tructing them that oppo&s;e them&s;elves, if GOD Peradventer will give them Repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth.</HI> We ought to be di|ligent to keep the Church clean from Scandalous Per&s;ons: But if a Secret Grudge at the Per&s;on be at la&s;t found to be the cau&s;e of your Zeal; it will be found but a Ser|vice of the Devil. Men need know well by what Mo|tive they are &s;et on Work. The way is <HI>Narrow!</HI></P>
<P>Nor do I know how to excu&s;e tho&s;e who in <HI>Families</HI> or in Neighbourhoods, are ever and anon in Anger, and giving angry Language (whether to Equals or In|feriors.) They are much ea&s;ier Reformed by <HI>Convincing Loving</HI> Rea&s;ons: And if Inferiors mu&s;t have Correction, it will take much the better Convincing Impre&s;&s;ion, when few or no angry Words (which always &s;eem to &s;hew Revenge) are mixed with it; as Experience &s;hews where it is u&s;ed. But an angry murmering Temper looks &s;o little like Heaven, and &s;o much like Hell; that I mu&s;t <HI>beg</HI> of &s;uch as u&s;e it to con&s;ider on what Ground they &s;tand.</P>
<P N="6">6. Here &s;ee what we are to aim at, in all our Religion, <HI>viz.</HI> to be Transformed into Love, that Glorious Ver|tue, and a re&s;emblance of GOD! We lo&s;t it by the Fall when Man &s;et up for him&s;elf in Seperation from GOD. We became <HI>Hateful and Hating one another.</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="006372_0014_10288A5ADC872960">CHRIST came to Redeem us, and to Sanctify us and to Purify us, and turn us again into Love. Come to CHRIST to bring you to it, by his Mediation and holy Spirit. Know what Progre&s;s you have made of Faith in Him, by the Fruit of it in Love, <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.6. Know that if you make no Progre&s;s in that, then all you have done yet has bro't nothing to Effect; you are yet in your Sins and bear the Image of the Devil. I do not mean an Affectionate Pa&s;&s;ion of Love (which yet is very good in it's time and place) but I mean that Love by which Faith works in a due care for GOD's Glory and your Neighbours Good and Peace and Comfort: Which among many greater Effects makes you bear with many con&s;iderable Faults in others, without being angry at them, knowing how much you need the &s;ame from GOD.</P>
