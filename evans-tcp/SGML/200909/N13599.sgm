<P>THE numbering our days, &s;o as to apply our hearts unto wi&s;dom, is not computing the definite &s;um total of them to know how ma|ny they &s;hall be; but the ju&s;t reckoning them to be few and uncertain, and in con&s;ideration thereof, to live them religiou&s;ly. Yet, to keep an account of tho&s;e which are pa&s;t, may be a help to the better improvement of tho&s;e which may be to come, e&s;pecially in our old age, when the latter mu&s;t appear very few indeed compared with the former, and of the la&s;t importance to be &s;pent well and wi&s;ely by us. The ob&s;ervation of our birth-day is to little good pur|po&s;e, if we do not then with religious &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s con|&s;ider, how many years old we are. There is not in this a&s;&s;embly more than one per&s;on who can adopt the words of the text, and &s;ay, <HI>I am this day four&s;core and five years old.</HI> Yet, all the aged here may, with him, receive in&s;truction therefrom, to remember, as it be|cometh and concerneth us, how old we are. Forget|fulne&s;s is a common infirmity of old age. The decay of memory is the fir&s;t of their mental faculties which men feel, and are willing to own, and do complain of. In &s;ome it is to that degree, that they are not able to tell how old they are. But all that can count the num|ber of the pa&s;t years of their lives, do not apply this knowledge to the good u&s;es it might &s;erve them. That
<PB N="4" REF="017170_0003_0FA06F684E113DF8">&s;uch of us who are old may &s;o remember this, as that our minds may be deeply impre&s;&s;ed, our affections and actions duly influenced by the con&s;ideration thereof, is the de&s;ign of the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. REMEMBERING how old we are, the goodne&s;s of God in prolonging our days, &s;hould be greatly admired and thankfully acknowledged by us. The boundaries of human life have been different in the &s;everal ages of the world. There have been gradual abbreviations of it from the fir&s;t man, Adam, who lived nine hundred and thirty years, to Mo&s;es, who lived an hundred and twenty. But then, the term fixed by God was three&s;core years and ten. This hath ever &s;ince been the goal that &s;tints our race. Some run beyond it, but the mo&s;t do not reach it. Of David, who lived ju&s;t &s;eventy years, it is &s;aid, that he died in a good old age, and full of days&mdash;being as many as tho&s;e of a long life, in the &s;cripture-account, and of which there was a pro|mi&s;e. The addition of ten or fifteen years, was then, and is now, rare, and vouch&s;afed to very few individuals of mankind. The&s;e are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mo&s;t of their fellow-mortals in the length of their days, and are remarkable in&s;tances of longevity; and &s;hould take &s;pecial notice of it them&s;elves, as doth the pious I&s;rae|lite in the text, <HI>Caleb,</HI> the &s;on of Jephunneh the Kene|zite. He was one of the twelve princes, heads of the tribes, whom Mo&s;es, when he came to the borders of Canaan, &s;ent to &s;earch the land: and the only man, be|&s;ide Jo&s;hua, the &s;on of Nun, that animated the faint-heart|ed people to go in, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Which he could do with greater a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s in the at|tempt, becau&s;e God had promi&s;ed to give him <HI>Hebron,</HI> a city of the mo&s;t gigantic men, and impregnable walls, together with the adjacent country, for his inhe|ritance. To which he put in his claim unto Jo&s;hua, the captain of the Lord's people, &s;even years after he led them into Canaan, and among the &s;everal tribes.
<PB N="5" REF="017170_0004_0FA06F690D597330">Caleb was probably the olde&s;t man of the whole congre|gation that entered into Canaan&mdash;all his cotemporaries dying in the wilderne&s;s. And with admiration and gratitude he reflected on the goodne&s;s of God, in the pre&s;ervation of his life to that time. <HI>Now behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he &s;aid, the&s;e forty and five years &s;ince the Lord &s;pake the&s;e words unto Mo&s;es, even &s;ince the children of I&s;rael wandered in the wilderne&s;s: and now lo, I am this day four&s;core and five years old.</HI></P>
<P>AN in&s;tructive example, my aged brethren, is this unto us, to con&s;ider how long God hath kept us alive, and affect our hearts with an admiring and thankful &s;en&s;e of the goodne&s;s of God therein toward us. The Author is the Pre&s;erver of our lives, who hath given us all things nece&s;&s;ary to our &s;u&s;tenance, convenient for our u&s;e, and plea&s;ant for our enjoyment&mdash;<HI>all tho&s;e things by which men live.</HI> He took us out of the womb, and did make us to hope when we hung on our mothers brea&s;ts. He nur&s;ed our tender infancy, and guarded our heedle&s;s youth: and having abtained help and mercy of him, we continue unto old age. This &s;hould be marvellous in our eyes, while we &s;ee &s;o many dying around us ere they arrive at it. To God our e&s;capes from death belong, and &s;hould be thankfully a&s;cribed, when the arrows of it are con&s;tantly flying &s;o thick a|bout us. We have been a-like &s;ubject as others to mor|tal di&s;ea&s;es and fatal accidents, from which we have been pre&s;erved to this day. Our travel, as Caleb's, hath been through a wilderne&s;s, in which the carca&s;es of the mo&s;t of that generation which &s;et out with us are fallen. But God hath kept us alive amid&s;t innumerable dangers that have &s;urrounded us. On which if we look back, our &s;ouls mu&s;t be filled with wonder, and our mouths <HI>with</HI> prai&s;e, that we are not de&s;troyed from off the earth. Our frail bodies in which we dwell, are hou|&s;es of clay, who&s;e foundation is in the du&s;t: can we but marvel that in &s;o many years they are not mouldered down; or that they fell not long ago, when the rain of
<PB N="6" REF="017170_0005_0FA06F69CFD29D08">affliction de&s;cended, the floods of &s;orrow came, and tem|pe&s;ts of adver&s;ity beat upon them. How often hath God healed our di&s;ea&s;es, and brought us back from the gates of death, that we might prai&s;e him in the land of the living? David in his old age reflecting how marvellou&s;ly he had been holden up from the womb to that time, &s;aid, "I am as a wonder unto many." P&s;alm 71. He was mo&s;t &s;o to him&s;elf, that he was yet alive, when he thought of the troubles, fatigues, and dangers he had been carried through. How melting the con|&s;ideration, that the long-&s;uffering God hath &s;pared us, while we by our &s;ins have been continually provoking him to cut off the number of our months in the mid&s;t! He hath prolonged our days, which the indi&s;cretions and extravagances of our youth; the exce&s;&s;es of our appe|tites and pa&s;&s;ions would el&s;e have &s;hortned. We &s;hould remember all the way which the Lord hath led us the&s;e &s;o many years, and thank him for the conduct of his kind providence in bringing us to a great old age. O ble&s;s our God, ye people, and make the voice of his prai&s;e to be heard; who holdeth our &s;ouls in life. Ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul, who redeemeth thy life from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>BUT, is it &s;uch a favour to live to old age, the days of which are evil, and the years &s;uch as we are apt to &s;ay, we have no plea&s;ure in them? I an&s;wer, that life is the principal good, the foundation and capacity of our enjoying any: and the lengthening it to old age is an in&s;tance and di&s;play of the goodne&s;s of a faithful Creator, who hath promi&s;ed it them that follow him in the way of his commandments; as al&s;o, that goodne&s;s and mercy &s;hall follow them to the end of their days. I&s;aiah 46.3.4. Hearken unto me, O hou&s;e of Jacob, &s;aith God, and all the remnant of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, which are born by me from the belly, and carried from the womb, and even to your old age I am he, and unto hoar hairs I will carry you, I have made, and I will bear, even I will carry, and will deliver you Such ten|der
<PB N="7" REF="017170_0006_0FA06F6A8F8E3D20">care of divine providence from the beginning to the end of long life, as the&s;e words expre&s;s, certainly demands the thankful acknowledgments of the aged. Were we indeed to live only in this world, &s;o full of troubles we meet with in it from wailing infancy to querulous decrepitne&s;s, it might not be thought &s;o great a favour to live unto old age, which is attended with peculiar inconveniences. The evil of the&s;e days, added to that of the former of our lives, might &s;eem more than a balance for the good enjoyed in them all. In the judgment of wi&s;e Solomon, concerning a man who&s;e happine&s;s is limited to this world, Eccle&s;i. 6. Though he live a thou&s;and years twice told, yet hath he &s;een no good&mdash;none that makes him happier upon the whole, than if he lived not at all:&mdash;hath &s;een no more good than if he never had been born. The vanity and vexation of &s;pirit in a life more than twice as long as <HI>Methu&s;elab</HI>'s, would eat out the heart of all the good in its &s;orrows multiplying with the years of it, would render life an in&s;upportable burthen. "For my part, &s;aith Mr. How, upon the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry, I &s;ee nothing in the life of man upon earth, that &s;hould render it for it&s;elf, more the matter of a rational election (&s;uppo&s;ing the free option given him the fir&s;t moment of his being) than pre&s;ently again to cea&s;e to be the next moment." If we can &s;ee more good in the pre&s;ent life, on the &s;uppo&s;ition there is none to follow it, than that heavenly man did, yet we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that our be&s;t days, as to worldly enjoyment, are fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, and if with them an end had been put to our exi&s;tence, we &s;hould have been &s;o far happy as not to have &s;een the evil of the&s;e days of old age; and we may have cau&s;e to think it had been well for us not to have lived to them. But, &s;ince this life is in order to another, and we are here in a &s;tate of probation and preparation for an everla&s;ting life of perfect felicity; and the good and evil received at the hand of the Lord are impro|veable to our obtaining it, the prolongation of our days
<PB N="8" REF="017170_0007_0FA06F6B4D8F7F20">on earth is, on this account, an advantage infinitely exceeding all the di&s;advantage thereof. The ju&s;t value of the pre&s;ent life is to be e&s;timated by it's relation to a future&mdash;the dependance which our eternal well-being hath upon it. It is the precious &s;ea&s;on of working out our &s;alvation, and making our calling and election &s;ure: the which requireth, as diligent care and labour, &s;o like|wi&s;e competent time. No part of it which is allotted to us for that purpo&s;e, &s;hould we think to be redundant, but fear rather the whole will &s;carce be &s;ufficient: e&s;pe|cially, when we con&s;ider how much of that which is pa&s;t we have lo&s;t in &s;loth and idlene&s;s. Did we &s;et out early to follow God in a religious cour&s;e of life, and make as &s;teady and &s;peedy progre&s;s to the end, as hu|man frailty ordinarily admits, we may find the longe&s;t day of life &s;hort enough to perform our journey to hea|ven. Length of days is a real advantage to our improv|ing in virtue, perfecting of holine&s;s, and attaining to High degrees of glory at la&s;t. They therefore to whom it is granted, may have great cau&s;e to thank God there|for, whatever inconveniences attend their old age. And yet, it might be in favour to others, that they died be|fore the evil came; having lived long enough to an|&s;wer life's great end, and be ripe for heaven.&mdash;Do any of us continue wicked, that are waxed old? let not the riches of God's goodne&s;s, forbearance and long-&s;uffering, be de&s;pi&s;ed, but adored by us. Is it le&s;s wonderful mercy in him, that hath kept us &s;o long alive in our rebellion again&s;t him, than if we had faithfully &s;erved him? How admirable is his patience that hath born with us to this day in our &s;ins&mdash;that he hath &s;pared us, when multitudes of our coevals (not greater &s;inners than we) have been cut off in the mid&s;t of their days? Is it no favor to be &s;o long reprieved from death and hell, and to have &s;till opportunity to &s;eek for par|don with the lea&s;t hope of obtaining it, which the dam|ned have not? God is long-&s;uffering toward us, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that we &s;hould come
<PB N="9" REF="017170_0008_0FA06F6D93625760">to repentance; for which the evil days of old age may be a &s;pace given us, though not &s;o convenient a &s;ea&s;on as we have let &s;lip, and irrecoverably lo&s;t. So that whatever our character be, we &s;hould admire, and thankfully acknowledge the goodne&s;s of God in keep|ing us alive.</P>
<P N="2">2. To remember, as we ought, how old we are, bringeth death, and it's awful con&s;equence, in a near and affecting view to us. It conduceth to make us know our end, that it is <HI>near,</HI> it is <HI>near,</HI> and ha&s;teth greatly. This is a point of wi&s;dom, to which we &s;hould apply our hearts, to know practically, or with &s;erious re|gard to con&s;ider our latter end, that we &s;hortly mu&s;t die out of this world, and enter on eternity. Of this we mu&s;t needs be &s;en&s;ible, when we that are old recol|lect how many years we have already lived&mdash;many times more than we can expect &s;till to live. We have not the &s;kill of numbering our days, if we reckon not tho&s;e to come very few indeed compared with tho&s;e that are pa&s;t. Men judge better of the &s;hortne&s;s of time when it is pa&s;t, than when it is pa&s;&s;ing; and by &s;etting a le&s;&s;er portion of it again&s;t a larger. "Few, &s;aid Jacob to Pha|raoh, when he was an hundred and thirty years old, have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attain|ed unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers." Gen. 47.7. Do the days of the years we have lived &s;eem few? how much fewer, in a comparative view of them, mu&s;t tho&s;e we may have to live &s;eem to us? a day or a year to come, is not longer than one that is pa&s;t. If it appear &s;o to us, we mea&s;ure time fal&s;ly, and our mi&s;take, by the lea&s;t con&s;ideration might be correct|ed. How long have I to live? &s;aid Barzillai to the King&mdash;I am this day four&s;core years old. Every man that is &s;o old or older, &s;hould be as deeply &s;en&s;ible, that he hath not long to live. It is vain pre&s;umption in the young, but mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and ab&s;urd in the aged,
<PB N="10" REF="017170_0009_0FA06F6DA7949D38">to put far away the evil day of death. Such is the common dotage on life, as to occa&s;ion the remark, that there's no man &s;o old but thinks he may live a year longer. Were any of us &s;ure that we &s;hould; is death at no greater di&s;tance to be unregarded and unprepared for by us: The living know that they &s;hall die. From our age and the circum&s;tances of it, we may with as much certainty conclude that the time of our departure is at hand. The bodily frame is &s;o weakened, and &s;uch irreparable breaches are made in it, that it's di&s;&s;olution is daily to be expected. We may &s;ay as Job, Our breath is cor|rupt our vital &s;pirits are wa&s;ted, our days are extinct, the graves are ready for us. We are tottering over them, and &s;hall &s;oon tumble into them. This con&s;ider|ation of the near approach of death, (which is included in the &s;erious remembrance of our great age) would be available, in way of rational influence, to bring our hearts unto wi&s;dom, and engage us to a good improve|ment of the few uncertain days which may be added to our &s;o many pa&s;t years, and &s;o to live every day as if it were our la&s;t. Con&s;idering our&s;elves &s;o near the eter|nal world, our great concern would be to get prepared for a &s;peedy removal by death into it, and to appear at that awful bar, before which nature in a very little time will &s;et us. "As a &s;hip which hath been long at &s;ea to&s;s'd and weather-beaten, which is &s;hattered in it's tim|ber, and hath le&s;t much of it's rigging, &s;hould do no|thing in that ca&s;e but work toward the port, there to find it's &s;afety and ca&s;e; &s;o &s;hould a man, who having pa&s;t many &s;torms and agitations of this world, is grive|ou&s;ly battered and torn with age, &s;trive only to die well, and get &s;afe into the harbour of eternal re&s;t."</P>
<P N="3">3. REMEMBERING how old we are, and therefore have not long to live, we &s;hould review our actions, and repent of out &s;ins. Happy are tho&s;e aged &s;ervants of God who, re&s;lecting on their pa&s;t behaviour in life,
<PB N="11" REF="017170_0010_0FA06F6E541572F0">can &s;ay with him in the text, we have <HI>fully followed the Lord.</HI> But they cannot pretend they have done to without many &s;traying &s;teps. Their rejoicing is this, the te&s;timony of their con&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, not with fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God, they have their conver&s;ation in the world. They &s;till look back with &s;orrow and &s;hame on the &s;ins of their youth, and renew their repentance of all they committed before and &s;ince their conver&s;ion; and do not think them&s;elves &s;o righteous in the &s;ight of God, by imputation, or &s;anctification, as not to need con|tinue their repentance in old age, and to the end of their days. Good men die repenting. A repentance unto life is better compleated, than begun, on a death|bed&mdash;If any of us have lived impenitent to old age, and are now to begin the difficult work, for which we have &s;o little uncertain time; let us not delay a mo|ment longer to turn from our evil ways unto the Lord, and follow hard after him. With what confu&s;ion mu&s;t it cover us, to recount the many years we have &s;pent in &s;in, following worldly lu&s;ts and vanities, and have irreco|verably lo&s;t the mo&s;t and be&s;t of our time and &s;trength given us for the &s;ervice of God, and the work of our &s;alvation. Shall we rob God, and defraud our own &s;ouls of the &s;mall remainder? It was good advice of a Jewi&s;h Rabbi, Be &s;ure to repent one day before thy death. If we that are very old mean to do &s;o, we mu&s;t repent to-day; for we have lea&s;t rea&s;on to boa&s;t of to|morrow.&mdash;But, <HI>can a man be born again, when he is old?</HI> Can he be converted, and become a regenerate child of God, when he is grown old in &s;in? It &s;eemeth a miracle of grace that he &s;hould be &s;o; but it is not to be di&s;|paired of as impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;nothing is &s;o with God. To a repentance which is unto &s;alvation, the &s;uccour of di|vine grace is nece&s;&s;ary; and we do not know it is too late for us to &s;eek it: &s;oon will it be &s;o, if we &s;till ne|glect or refu&s;e it. To-day, after &s;o long a time of di&s;o|bedience
<PB N="12" REF="017170_0011_0FA06F6F19097450">to the go&s;pel, are we called upon, not to har|den our hearts. The goodne&s;s of God in keeping us alive to this day, leadeth us to repentance, and encou|rageth us to hope for pardon and acceptance with God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, upon it. Wherefore hath the Lord waited, but that he might be gracious; and been &s;o long-&s;uffering toward us, but that we might have this late opportunity of turning unto him? It is at our infinite peril that we defer a day longer. "Wherefore is our day of trial extended beyond the common term? Is it not indulged to the great need our pa&s;t conduct hath of it? And &s;hall our folly rever&s;e the kind inten|tion of that indulgence?" So the ble&s;&s;ing of long life which God hath given us, will be turned into a cur&s;e, as it is written, I&s;a. 65.20, The &s;inner being an hund|red years old &s;hall be accur&s;ed&mdash;the more accur&s;ed for dying &s;o old an impenitent.</P>
<P N="4">4. REMEMBERING how old we are, our hearts &s;hould be loo&s;ened from this world. Our affections to, our cares about, and pur&s;uits after, the things of it be moderated. The con&s;ideration of our having lived &s;o many years in it, and mu&s;t therefore &s;oon leave it, is proper and u&s;eful to wean our hearts from it's mo&s;t de&s;irable enjoyments. Barzillai found it &s;o, when David invited him to go and &s;pend the re&s;t of his days in a palace. "The king &s;aid unto Barzillai, come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jeru&s;alem. And Barzillai &s;aid unto the king, How long have I to live, that I &s;hould go up with the king unto Jeru&s;alem? I am this day four&s;core years old: and can thy &s;ervant di&s;eern between good and evil? Can thy &s;ervant ta&s;te what I eat, or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of &s;inging men, and &s;inging women? Wherefore then &s;hould thy &s;ervant be yet a burthen unto my Lord the king? They &s;ervant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why &s;hould the king recompence
<PB N="13" REF="017170_0012_0FA06F6FDCD66688">it me with &s;uch a reward? Let thy &s;ervant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father, and of my mother." The con&s;ideration of his great age prevailed again&s;t the love of the world, which is deeply rooted in the hearts of men, and is wont, to continue and increa&s;e until death. All it's alluring baits could not draw him from his home to Jeru&s;alem, where he might have liv|ed in greater &s;plendor, wealth and delicacy. All that is tempting in this world&mdash;the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life, came a-brea&s;t and a&s;&s;aulted him at once; but he with&s;tood them, by cal|ling to mind how old he was. The grandeur and opu|lence of a court-life, the dainties of a royal table, and charms of mu&s;ick, had no force on him to embrace the king's grateful and generous offer. It much better be|came him, he ju&s;tly thought, who was &s;o old, and he much rather cho&s;e to retire to his private hou&s;e, where he might pa&s;s his la&s;t days more free from the dangerous temptations of an in&s;naring world, and better prepare for death and the grave, to which he was &s;o near. O that we who are old might learn by this noble example, to get our hearts weaned from the world before we are removed, as very &s;oon we mu&s;t be, out of it. Surely we forget how old we are, while we mind earthly things, having all our thoughts and cares employ'd about them. If this was our way in youth, and middle age, it was then our folly: much more inexcu&s;able is it now in our old age. What is more ab&s;urd and &s;hocking than to &s;ee men who are ju&s;t going out of the world, loving it as fondly, and &s;craping for it as eagerly, as if they were never to leave it? What are all the honors, and riches, and plea&s;ures of it to us, who can &s;o little time enjoy them? Did we retain a natural reli&s;h of them as quick and &s;trong as in youth, this thought might be enough to cool our thir&s;t, and &s;lacken our endeavours after them, and abate our complacence in them. It is our
<PB N="14" REF="017170_0013_0FA06F708D891E50">&s;hame and mi&s;ery, if our long experience hath not taught us the vanity of this world. What did we ever get by following it hitherto? Not any thing which &s;atisfieth us: nor &s;hall we, if we follow it to the end of our days. Vain will all our expectations from this world be found. Is it not in a manner dead to us? And &s;hall not we in affection be dead to it?&mdash;The aged &s;ervant of the Lord, who &s;aid, <HI>I am this day four&s;core and five years old,</HI> did indeed take a prudent thought and care to &s;ecure for him&s;elf and po&s;terity that part of Canaan which was allotted to him by God, and confirmed with an oath by Mo&s;es.&mdash;It is the inordinate love of the world, &s;uch as excludeth the love of the Father, and ob&s;tructeth our following the Lord, which we are to take heed and be|ware of, as mo&s;t ill-becoming our age, who can need, or u&s;e the things of it but a little while. And as to our children, which may live in this world after us, we &s;hould warn them of the evil of covetou&s;ne&s;s, and not by our anxiety in providing for them leave them an exam|ple of it. Can we not, in the faith of the dying Pa|triarch, tru&s;t them to the care of a good God which hath fed us all our life long unto this day? Gen. 48.15.</P>
<P N="5">5. REMEMBERING how old we are, let patience under the infirmities and afflictions of the&s;e our evil days have it's perfect work in us. Few that are much younger than Caleb, when he was four&s;core and five years old, can &s;ay as he did, "as yet I am as &s;trong as I was at forty"&mdash;the time when men are in their full &s;trength. If by rea&s;on of a more than ordinary firm con&s;titution, any live to be four&s;core, yet commonly is their &s;trength then <HI>labour and &s;orrow.</HI> So decayed are they in body and mind, that they cannot do the bu&s;ine&s;s nor enjoy the comforts of life; which is &s;ometimes, tho' rarely, extended farther. But the evil days u&s;ually come much &s;ooner, the years in which men &s;ay, they have no plea|&s;ure in them. And they are u&s;ually attended with
<PB N="15" REF="017170_0014_0FA06F7156652398">&s;uch weakne&s;&s;es, pains, di&s;ea&s;es, di&s;quiets, mi&s;eries of various kinds, as make folk (&s;aith the Roman orator) complain of a load lying upon them heavier than mount <HI>Aetna.</HI> But the con&s;ideration of our great age, may help us to bear the afflictions of it patiently, as knowing it is not long we have to bear them. How full &s;oever our evil days are of troubles, they are few, and will &s;oon be fini&s;hed. They are few compared with our good days of youth, and health, and &s;trength, and rejoicing. Have we not many more years of mer|cy to remember and thank God for, than we now have of affliction to pa&s;s through in this world? Had we not enjoyed the good of the former, we had not &s;uf|fered the evil of the pre&s;ent. Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and &s;hall we not receive evil? If we would not have lived to old age, why were we un|willing to die before? If we would, why &s;hould we repine at the decays of a frail nature, and be di&s;&s;atis|fied that we were made men? There is no temptati|on or trouble that befalleth us, but what is common to man. It is the condition of humanity to be liable to &s;uch infirmities and inconveniences. We &s;uffer them by a natural unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity. "The&s;e things in a long life, are like du&s;t, and dirt, and rain in a long journey." A few weary &s;teps more will bring us to the end of our's.&mdash;In re&s;pect of the pub|lic &s;tate of things the days are evil, which make the&s;e of old age the more &s;o unto us. If it be not for want of enquiring wi&s;ely concerning this, that we &s;ay the former days were better than the&s;e, and we had more plea&s;ure in them, yet, remembering how old we are, let us in our patience po&s;&s;e&s;s our &s;ouls, &s;ubmitting to the providence of God, and believing that he hath wi&s;e and good rea&s;on for &s;uffering the times to be as they are. Soon will there be an end, if not of the&s;e trou|bles, yet of our days, and we &s;hall &s;ee no more the e|vil work that is done under the &s;un.&mdash;Should we have
<PB N="16" REF="017170_0015_0FA06F720D3F0978">the trial of out-living our &s;erviceablene&s;s in the world, and be laid by as ve&s;&s;els of no more u&s;e, the con&s;ide|ration of our being wa&s;ted and worn out with age, &s;hould make us contented, and others al&s;o, to whom we may &s;eem burthen&s;ome; but &s;hall not long be &s;o. Pa&s;&s;ive obedience is that which God calleth us to in our age and weakne&s;s, and in which we mu&s;t &s;erve and honour him in the conclu&s;ion of our labour.</P>
<P>IT is one, and not the lea&s;t, of the melancholy cir|cum&s;tances of old age, to have buried the mo&s;t, or all, of our coeval friends, early acquaintance, and dear companions in the kingdom and patience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and be deprived of the benefit and comfort of their &s;ociety. For, whatever be the rea&s;on, though we ta&s;te the wine of new friend&s;hip we have contract|ed, and it make our hearts glad, yet we are apt to think the old was better. The hope of going ere long to the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, &s;olaceth the minds of aged chri&s;tians, when they &s;it alone, and feel their want of the company of pious departed friends, with whom they u&s;ed to take &s;weet coun&s;el. Having &s;et down the names of many who were gone before him into the world of &s;pirits, Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> writes thus: <HI>"I name the&s;e for my own delight and comfort; it being plea&s;ant to me to remember what companions I &s;hall have in the heavenly joys, and prai&s;es of my Lord."</HI> Death di&s;&s;olves not the union of &s;ouls knit to one another in holy love. There is but a &s;hort ab&s;ence, and they &s;hall meet and congratulate in a better world, where the communion of &s;aints is perfected.&mdash;While in this tabernacle aged chri&s;tians do groan, being bur|thened with many afflictions; but &s;hould wait patient|ly for deliverance therefrom: which, though they have greater rea&s;on, may be more difficult for them to do, becau&s;e of the good hope and earne&s;t de&s;ire in them of pa&s;&s;ing through death to a &s;tate of re&s;t and happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="017170_0016_0FA06F72D8F7F7C0">in heaven. This trial is peculiar to a&s;&s;ured chri&s;|tians, who have the mo&s;t lively views and expectations of being with the Lord, when they &s;hall be ab&s;ent from the body. The height of their piety encrea&s;eth the trial of their patience in waiting for God's &s;alvation. The delay of their hopes and de&s;ires, is a &s;ingular ex|erci&s;e of their patience under the afflictions of this life: e&s;pecially, when they have many times thought them|&s;elves pa&s;&s;ed the &s;torms and agitations of this world, ju&s;t at harbour, and have been put back again to &s;ea. The &s;hip, however, is &s;till under &s;ail, and they are con|&s;tantly making nearer approaches to, and &s;hall &s;hortly reach their de&s;ired haven. Ye have need of patience, &s;aith the author of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews, that af|ter ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promi&s;e: for yet a little while, and he that &s;hall come will come, and will not tarry.</P>
<P N="6">6. REMEMBERING how old we are, let us wholly, and more clo&s;ely follow the Lord to the end of our lives&mdash;hold on our way of faithful obedience, and not be tired by the length of it, and be weary of well do|ing. We &s;hould take heed that we &s;uffer not decays of grace with tho&s;e of nature; but while our outward man is peri&s;hing, our inward man be renewed day by day. Our diligence &s;hould be quickned, our zeal promoted amid&s;t, and even by our bodily weakne&s;&s;es, has they intimate the time of working out our &s;alvati|on is &s;hort. We do not, as Caleb did, retain our na|tural vigour to be employed in the &s;ervice of God, nor can we expect our youth will be renewed in old age, as &s;ometimes it hath been after &s;ickne&s;s; yet waiting upon the Lord, we may (according to his promi&s;e) <HI>re|new</HI> our &s;piritual <HI>&s;trength,</HI> and <HI>mount up with wings, like eagles</HI> (when they have renewed their plumes, and fly toward heaven, in earne&s;t de&s;ires and endeavours after higher degrees of grace and holine&s;s. Are we
<PB N="18" REF="017170_0017_0FA06F73927693E8">not too apt to grow remi&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, dull and &s;luggi&s;h in the performance of the duties of it; and to think our age will excu&s;e this in us?&mdash; whereas this con&s;ideration &s;hould urge us to greater diligence in the important work, for the accompli&s;h|ment of which we have &s;o little time remaining. Have we not &s;till much to do, that we may be prepared as we wi&s;h to be for death and eternity? and O how &s;hort a time to do it in? we that are &s;o near the grave, where there is not work, &s;hould do with all our might that which we are infinitely concerned to fini&s;h well. Old age hath &s;ome peculiar advantages for the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion, which we &s;hould embrace. It di&s;|ableth us from following the world in eager and ince&s;|&s;antly laborious pur&s;uits; and &s;o we may the more ful|ly follow the Lord in the ea&s;ier ways of godline&s;s, and mind the one <HI>thing needful.</HI> It abateth the violence of &s;en&s;ual inclinations; and it exempteth from many temptations to &s;in, into which youth betrayeth men. It alloweth us not to run with the profane and di&s;&s;o|lute to the exce&s;s of riot&mdash;excu&s;eth us from conformity to the world in its vain fa&s;hions, and &s;hutteth us out of much idle time&mdash;wa&s;ting company, that we might conver&s;e with God in &s;ecret, by reading, meditation, and prayer. And we &s;hould not deprive our&s;elves of the benefit of public ordinances of wor&s;hip, &s;o long as we are any ways capable of giving our profitable at|tendance. P&s;al. 92.13.14. Tho&s;e that be planted in the hou&s;e of the Lord, &s;hall flouri&s;h in the courts of our God. They &s;hall &s;till bring forth fruit in old age: they &s;hall be fat and flouri&s;hing. We &s;hould di|ligently improve all means and advantages to our thriving in grace, and abounding in the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s, even in old age. The prophet &s;aith of the millenial &s;tate, I&s;a. 65.20. <HI>There &s;hall be no more an old man that hoth not filled up his days.</HI> Our la&s;t will be empty days, if they be pa&s;&s;ed in the &s;lothful
<PB N="19" REF="017170_0018_0FA06F744D778668">neglect of our duty. Let none &s;uch be put into the <HI>Calendar</HI>&mdash;be joined to the days of our years, or come into the number of the months. Let our days to the very la&s;t of them be filled up with religious virtue, and a long life compleated in us&mdash;So will our old be truly "honourable age:" Whereas, nothing is more &s;hame|ful, than to have no other proof of our living long, than that we have been three&s;core and ten, or four&s;core years and more, in the world.</P>
<P N="7">7. REMEMBERING how old we are, we &s;hould be willing, when our time cometh, to die. If the con&s;i|deration of our great age hath the forementioned ef|fects upon us, it may be of this comfortable u&s;e to us at the clo&s;e of our days. It is a common &s;aying, the young may, the old mu&s;t, die. The&s;e die in cour&s;e, and by nece&s;&s;ity of nature. Of which nece&s;&s;ity we &s;hould make a virtue, in being truly willing, at the call of God and nature, to leave this world, in which we have had &s;o large a &s;hare of life. To die willingly, and go away rejoicing in hope of eternal life, is the crowning virtue of a good life. It doth honour to religion, and might convince the infidel and ungodly part of mankind of its reality and excellence; and that a holy life is indeed the be&s;t, which hath &s;o peace|ful and happy an end. And &s;urely, they that have followed the Lord to a good old age, &s;hould be wil|ling and glad, and only wait for leave, to go to him; although the pa&s;&s;age be through the valley of the &s;ha|dow of death. It becometh &s;uch to be &s;atisfied with long life. And if at the end of it, they feel any re|luctance to a departure hence, to &s;ay unto the linger|ing &s;pirit, as good old Hilarion did, "Go forth, O my &s;oul, why do&s;t thou pau&s;e and &s;top? ha&s;t thou &s;erved God the&s;e three&s;core and ten years, and art thou afraid to die?" The very learned and pious <HI>Matthew
<PB N="20" REF="017170_0019_0FA06F750D24E610">Mead,</HI> when he was dying, &s;aid, "I am going home, as every hone&s;t man &s;hould, when his work is done; and I ble&s;s God I have &s;o good a home to go to." O how welcome is the day of &s;uch a man's death, and more to be rejoiced in by him, than the day of his birth.&mdash;To our &s;o great advantage in life, and comfort at death, might it be for us, my aged friends, to re|member how old we are.</P>
<P>HAD I room therefor in this Di&s;cour&s;e, calculated more e&s;pecially for the u&s;e of the aged of this flock of the Lord's people, I would addre&s;s my young hearers, and exhort them betimes to learn the holy art of num|bering their days, &s;o as to apply their hearts unto wil|dom: and recommend to their imitation al&s;o the ex|ample of faithful Caleb, who followed the Lord from his youth; as his own con&s;cience te&s;tifieth when he was &s;o old, as he telleth us in the text, and God al&s;o bare him witne&s;s. Forty years old (at which age men are reckoned young) was I, &s;aith he in the context, when Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of the Lord &s;ent me from Kade&s;h|barnea, to &s;py out the land&mdash;and I <HI>wholly followed the Lord.</HI> The &s;ame te&s;timony God him&s;elf gave of him. Commending the obedient &s;pirit which then was in him, &s;aith, Numb. 14.24. <HI>My &s;ervant Caleb follow|ed me fully.</HI> In the Book of Eccle&s;ia&s;tus, chap. 46, ver&s;e 10, it is to his honour recorded, "The Lord gave &s;trength unto Caleb, which remained with him to his old age, &s;o that he entered the high places of the land, and his &s;eed obtained it for an inheritance, that the children of I&s;rael might &s;ee, that it is good to follow the Lord." See here, my young people, an encouraging example for you to do &s;o. As you de|&s;ire life and love many days, that you may &s;ee good, walk not in the way of your hearts, but turn your feet now unto God's te&s;timonies, and wholly follow the
<PB N="21" REF="017170_0020_0FA06F75CE9D41B8">Lord your God&mdash;&s;o you may arrive to a good old age: or, if you die before, &s;hall obtain an inheritance in the better country, that is, the heavenly Canaan.&mdash; O ye beloved children, my mouth is opened, my heart is enlarged, to &s;peak much unto you, and warn you to flee youthful lu&s;ts: but to follow righteou&s;ne&s;s, faith, charity, peace, every chri&s;tian virtue, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart: that the friend of your &s;ouls may have the joy to &s;ee you walk in the truth, following the Lord as dear obedient children.</P>
<P>BUT it is time for me to put an end to this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I ASK of my hearers, young and old, a few mi|nutes attention to the conduct of divine Providence toward their aged Mini&s;ter, in the prolongation of his life.</P>
<P>LO NOW, my brethren, I am this day four&s;core and five years old&mdash;A wonder of God's &s;paring mercy! Sixty-three of the&s;e years have I &s;pent in the work of the mini&s;try among you. One hundred and forty-&s;ix years ago, your forefathers came with their pa&s;tor, and &s;ettled in this place. I am the third in the pa&s;torate of this church, which hath not been two years vacant. Scarce any pari&s;h but hath had more in that office in &s;o long a &s;pace of time. The people of this have been &s;teady to their own mini&s;ters, living to old age; have not been given to change, nor with itching ears have heaped to them&s;elves teachers. I ble&s;s God, who di&s;po&s;ed my lot among a people, with whom I have lived here in great peace, eleven years longer than ei|ther of my worthy predece&s;&s;ors.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Rev. <HI>Peter Hobart,</HI> and, The Rev. <HI>John Norton.</HI></NOTE> I have only to wi&s;h
<PB N="22" REF="017170_0021_0FA06F780D9BEAD0">that my labours had been as profitable, as they have been acceptable to them. I retain a grateful &s;en&s;e of the kindne&s;&s;es (injuries I remember none) which I have received from them. While I have reaped of their carnal things to my comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, it hath been my great concern and plea&s;ure to &s;ow unto them &s;piritual things, which might &s;pring up in a har|ve&s;t of eternal ble&s;&s;ings. That their affections to me, as their pa&s;tor, have continued from fathers to child|ren, and children's children, hath been thankfully ob|&s;erved by me; and &s;hould have been improved as an advantage and incentive to do them (in returns of love for love) all po&s;&s;ible good. It is but little I can now do in the work to which I am kept up &s;o late in the evening of my days, and my people may feel their great need of one more able in body and mind to &s;erve them in the go&s;pel-mini&s;try. In this ca&s;e, by breth|ren, I hope that no partial regard to me, or par&s;imo|nious view to your worldly intere&s;t, will hinder your timely providing your&s;elves with &s;uch an one. As much as I dread and deprecate the being cut down as a cumberer of the ground in this part of the Lord's vineyard; I would not with my u&s;ele&s;s old age fill up the place, and deprive you of the help, of a profitable labourer in it. I &s;ubmit to the wi&s;dom and will of God my own de&s;ire to fini&s;h my cour&s;e of life, and the mini&s;try I have received of him together; while I make the humble acknowledgment and prayer to him in P&s;alm 71. "O God, thou ha&s;t taught me from my youth, and hitherto I have declared thy wonderous works: Now al&s;o when I am old and gray-headed, O God, for&s;ake me not, until I have &s;hewed thy &s;trength unto this generation." Caleb, when he was as old as I am, could &s;ay, As yet I am as &s;trong this day as I was in the day that Mo&s;es &s;ent me; that is, when he was forty years old. As my &s;trength was then, even &s;o my &s;trength is now, for war, both to go out, and to

This would I do, God enabling me, as long as I am in this tabernacle of frail fle&s;h, knowing that I mu&s;t &s;hortly put it off; and exchange the <HI>Sacred De&s;k</HI> for the <HI>Silent Grave!</HI>&mdash;But, O my &s;oul, how awful the long&mdash;the very long and &s;trict account to be given to God of thy&s;elf, and of thou&s;ands more committed to thy charge, to watch al&s;o for their &s;afety and ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s! Brethren, pray for me, that I may find mercy of the Lord in that day: which if I &s;hould fail of, it had been good for me, and perhaps for you al&s;o, peri&s;hing by my neglect, that I had never been born. The con&s;ideration of which &s;hould excite my utmo&s;t care and diligence to make full proof of my mini&s;try, and engage your attendance upon it in &s;uch a manner as will &s;hew you are not grown into a weari|ne&s;s of it, which would render it unprofitable to you. I have been young, and now am old. Your fathers de&s;pi&s;ed not my youth for its weakne&s;s; nor have you my old age for the infirmities that attend it: Which giveth &s;ome encouragement to hope that my long con|tinuance with you is not &s;o much to the hinderance of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and detriment of your &s;piritual intere&s;ts, as I am often ready to fear. After &s;ome de|cay or interruption of the Philippians' liberality to Paul, he thus writeth unto them, Phil. 4.10. <HI>I re|joiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the la&s;t your care of me hath flouri&s;hed again.</HI> So hath yours of me. I may add, as he doth, <HI>not that I &s;peak in re&s;pect of want,</HI> which you have let me &s;uffer in the&s;e difficult times. You lay fre&s;h engagements upon me to exert my&s;elf in the &s;ervice of your &s;ouls; and if the God of my life and health prolong the &s;ame any farther, I
<PB N="24" REF="017170_0023_0FA06F78D62CF8B0">would go on in the &s;trength of the Lord God, to la|bour for your &s;alvation, ardently aiming at the graci|ous commendation which the mini&s;ter of the church in Thyatira received from Chri&s;t, Rev 2.19. I know thy works; and the la&s;t to be more than the fir&s;t. That mine may be more faithful, and more &s;ucce&s;sful, God of his mercy to me and you grant for Chri&s;t's &s;ake.</P>
<P>AND now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are &s;anctified.</P>
