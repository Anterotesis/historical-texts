<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN con&s;idering my intended &s;ubjects, the fa|miliar &s;tyle of letter-writing appeared the mo&s;t eligible; and particularly, when I re|flected upon the ab&s;urdity of u&s;ing terms of art, in an addre&s;s to the ladies. The three fir&s;t letters will not, I hope, be e&s;teemed fo|reign to my purpo&s;e, as they &s;eem to me alto|gether introductory to the de&s;ign. I was in|duced to add the la&s;t letter, upon old age, in order to make the &s;eries of letters complete; having now, in this collection, taken up man from the fir&s;t period of his exi&s;tence, and car|ried him through the various &s;tages of life.</P>
<P>It being much to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, and intimately connected with the following let|ters, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe a part of the introduc|tion to the eighth edition of the Family Phy|&s;ician, publi&s;hed about twelve months ago.</P>
<P>"Experience in phy&s;ic is the wi&s;e&s;t path to tread; and con&s;idering what poor crazy con|&s;titutions too many of the human race unhap|pily &s;u&s;tain, and the various di&s;orders which even the mo&s;t robu&s;t are liable to, no one can be too particular in remarking &s;uch innocent remedies as may relieve &s;light indi&s;po&s;itions, and con&s;equently prevent terrible and fatal di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="024796_0005_0FC88EDC99BE1298">"Good nur&s;ing is a point which has either been too much neglected, or mi&s;taken; ne|verthele&s;s it is of the fir&s;t con&s;equence to|wards the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, and the pre&s;erving of delicate and feeble con&s;titutions. It is e|qually &s;o to render advanced age ea&s;y and comfortable, and to pre&s;erve helple&s;s infants. To &s;peculative minds it mu&s;t be matter of a&s;|toni&s;hment to ob&s;erve the fatality among&s;t children, which the following table of births and infant-burials, collected from the bills of mortality, pre&s;ents for their &s;erious con&s;ider|ation.</P>

The average upon the la&s;t ten years.</P>
<P>"Thus we &s;ee that almo&s;t two thirds of the children born in this metropolis and its envi|rons are entirely lo&s;t to &s;ociety: 16283 are, upon the average, the annual births; 10145, the infant burials; and, what de&s;erves parti|cular attention, 7987 are cut off before they
<PB N="vii" REF="024796_0006_0FC88EE2A62BBA80">are two years old, which is more than three fourths of tho&s;e children who die under five years of age. How ardently therefore is it to be wi&s;hed that &s;uch a fatality could be pre|vented!&mdash;It may be prevented.</P>
<P>"Is it not affecting, that &s;o many beings, ju&s;t entering into life, &s;hould be &s;o untimely cut off, to the detriment of &s;ociety, and the af|fliction of their weeping mothers? It is, tru|ly, a &s;ubject of commi&s;eration, a &s;cene which draws a &s;ilent tear from the eye of humanity, and pierces the wounded bo&s;oms of afflicted parents.&mdash;Above three fourths of the&s;e little innocents fall a &s;acrifice under two years old. It is well known, that the thru&s;h and watery gripes generally terminate their exi&s;tence in the early months; and, if they &s;urvive the&s;e maladies, the time of teething too frequently brings on the fatal cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>"Could we but conquer the prejudices of the times, and aboli&s;h unnatural and ab&s;urd practices&mdash;could we but re&s;tore that natural and &s;imple method of rearing children, which the all-wi&s;e Giver of life has &s;ufficiently point|ed out&mdash;did we but confine them to that nu|triment, which HE has prepared for their fir&s;t &s;tate of exi&s;tence&mdash;and con&s;ult that rea&s;on which HE has be&s;towed upon us, to conduct them forwards&mdash;all would be well. But, alas, indolence and luxury forbid the ta&s;k! Never|thele&s;s, to the rational few the following re|marks are &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>"The thru&s;h and watery gripes are, in the
<PB N="viii" REF="024796_0007_0FC88EE4E6D709F8">author's opinion, artificial di&s;ea&s;es, and both of them totally occa&s;ioned by improper food; &s;uch as, all kinds of pap, whether made from flour, bread, or bi&s;cuit: they all cau&s;e too much fermentation in an infant's &s;tomach, and irritate its tender bowels beyond what nature can &s;upport. This appears to him to be the evident cau&s;e of the before-mentioned com|plaints.</P>
<P>"When infants are pa&s;t this period, the danger in cutting their teeth is ju&s;tly to be feared. This difficulty proceeds altogether from a weakne&s;s of con&s;titution, ari&s;ing from the &s;ame fir&s;t mi&s;management in point of diet: and here a train of dreadful &s;ymptoms pre&s;ent them&s;elves; the head, the &s;tomach, the bow|els, are all at times terribly affected; a gene|ral wa&s;ting of the body frequently en&s;ues; and unconquerable fevers prevail, which ge|nerally terminate in convul&s;ions and death.</P>
<P>"To prevent all the&s;e unhappy con&s;equen|ces, let us but for a moment reflect that every mother is de&s;igned by nature to fo&s;ter her own child. If the brea&s;t is not to be obtained, cow's milk is in general to be preferred to any kind of food that can be invented, becau&s;e it is nearly &s;imilar to that which nature intended."</P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h the hints thrown out in the following letters may be attended to; as the &s;ucce&s;s of rearing children, and the pre&s;erving infirm and aged con&s;titutions, greatly depends upon good nur&s;ing; much more indeed than it does upon the application of medicines. For
<PB N="ix" REF="024796_0008_0FC88EE66288A320">although, by the medical art, many violent and dangerous di&s;ea&s;es may oftentimes be pre|vented from proving fatal; yet, even when the doctor has taken his leave, the good nur&s;e mu&s;t &s;till be watchful, "to re&s;tore again the invalid to a healthy and vigorous con&s;titu|tion."</P>
<P>I was apprehen&s;ive, that many objections would be &s;tarted both again&s;t my opinions and maxims; which, indeed, was a leading mo|tive for concealing my name in the fir&s;t edi|tion: but as I hope I have &s;poken with can|dour, and as I mean to per&s;uade, rather than to find fault, it is to be wi&s;hed, that the young|er part of the female &s;ex at lea&s;t, whom it more nearly concerns, will not receive this little pre&s;ent with &s;uch unconquerable prejudices, as would probably have been experienced from their grand-dames. If, by addre&s;&s;ing their un|der&s;tanding, I &s;hould be happy enough to con|vince their judgment, of the propriety of the following ob&s;ervations, I tru&s;t they may prove in &s;ome mea&s;ure beneficial both to them&s;elves and their future daughters, in the exalted cha|racters of wives and mothers.</P>
<P>There is a certain re&s;pect due to our ance&s;|tors and their cu&s;toms; and, for my own part, I would never embrace new maxims or opi|nions, but upon full conviction of their claim|ing preference to old ones. Still it &s;hould be remembered, the mind was never de&s;igned for a &s;tate of &s;lavery; therefore, when once our rea&s;on is truly convinced of former errors, let
<PB N="x" REF="024796_0009_0FC88EE8B893AC50">the &s;anction for &s;uch mi&s;takes be never &s;o re|doubtable, there is a glorious freedom inhe|rent in human nature, that prompts a generous mind to revoke erroneous opinions, and adopt tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems, which, upon mature delibera|tion, &s;hall appear more rational. And when|ever the contrary di&s;po&s;ition is di&s;covered, it altogether &s;hows a want of candour, and points out an ob&s;tinacy, not only culpable with re|&s;pect to our private characters, but de&s;erving of cen&s;ure, as it regards &s;ociety; for &s;uch a temper tends to prohibit every kind of di&s;co|very, that may either improve our own know|ledge, or benefit our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>All our knowledge with re&s;pect to infants, mu&s;t be obtained from ob&s;ervation alone; as no one ever pretended to remember tho&s;e &s;en|&s;ations and wants which he him&s;elf experien|ced in the earlie&s;t part of childhood; therefore a careful attendance is required in the nur&s;e|ry. When infants are properly managed, there is but &s;eldom an occa&s;ion for the help of me|dicine: and &s;hould it be nece&s;&s;ary to call in a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this land, as they are totally inca|pable of relating their di&s;tre&s;s, it requires an accurate ob&s;ervation, together with a circum|&s;tantial account from the nur&s;es who attend upon them, to enable a medical practitioner to form a right judgment of their di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.
Of Marks&mdash;the imaginary con&s;equences of frights and longings. A candid enquiry into the merits of this doctrine.</HEAD>
<P>PREJUDICES, which have been imbibed in our early days, received from tho&s;e we e&s;teem and reverence, and &s;upported by the authority of pa&s;t ages, mu&s;t needs make im|pre&s;&s;ions upon the mo&s;t candid and ingenuous minds; particularly when almo&s;t every day produces &s;trange and wonderful &s;tories to cor|roborate the &s;uppo&s;ed fact.</P>
<P>The various blemi&s;hes frequently di&s;cover|ed upon children at the birth, have been gene|rally con&s;idered as the effect of a fright, or a di&s;appointment of the mother's longings: and indeed this opinion has &s;o far prevailed, that it has been, for a long time pa&s;t, looked upon as inconte&s;tible. Should any one, therefore, pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly dare to deny this amazing pecu|liarity in pregnant women, and the con&s;equent effect upon the embryo, he mu&s;t expect no|thing le&s;s than the general cen&s;ures of the fe|male world. Be&s;ides, the many po&s;itive a&s;&s;er|tions upon this head, from the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="12" REF="024796_0011_0FC88EF270F75AC8">per&s;ons of undoubted veracity, will naturally lead a prudent man to &s;peak with caution again&s;t the doctrine. Neverthele&s;s, it &s;urely cannot be improper to make a candid enquiry into &s;o wonderful a phenomenon.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ubject by far the mo&s;t intere&s;ting to the ladies: it comes, indeed, particularly un|der their cognizance; for the dreaded evil af|fects the fair &s;ex much more e&s;&s;entially than it does ours. With my female friends, there|fore, I beg leave to di&s;cu&s;s this important point.</P>
<P>It is by every one allowed, to the honour of this nation, (and let particular commendation be given to the daughters of Great-Britain them&s;elves), that in the education of young women, letters, and the polite improvements, are much more attended to in this age than formerly; accompli&s;hments which not only render their manners more engaging, but qua|lify them likewi&s;e for the happy dome&s;tic life; and contribute much to adorn the&s;e amiable and &s;weetly-endearing companions of the &s;o|cial hour. How e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary is &s;uch a friend, to make life comfortable and happy!</P>
<P>What a lu&s;tre does every good and accom|pli&s;hed woman add to the matrimonial &s;tate! &mdash;She mu&s;t by every rea&s;onable man be con|&s;idred not only as the partner of his bed, but of his very &s;oul.</P>
<P>I can at this readily call to mind many &s;uch exalted characters, to whom in a mo&s;t particular manner I now addre&s;s my&s;elf.&mdash;
<PB N="13" REF="024796_0012_0FC88EF4070AB048">women, who&s;e enlarged minds are capable of a much greater depth of rea&s;oning than the&s;e &s;peculations will afford; and in who&s;e compa|ny I have oftentimes enjoyed the happine&s;s of friendly conver&s;ation&mdash;with whom, upon dif|ferent occa&s;ions, I have, in part, entered into the &s;ubject of this, and the following letters. It is, indeed, at the reque&s;t of &s;everal of the&s;e my worthy female friends, that I have been induced to collect my thoughts, in order to deliver them to the public.</P>
<P>Ignorance, my fair readers, is the parent of credulity and &s;uper&s;tition. Knowledge is the conqueror that triumphs over &s;uch terrible foes. How much is the under&s;tanding enlight|ened and improved by the u&s;e of letters? When therefore we con&s;ider that the art of printing was not di&s;covered until the fifteenth century, and it was a long time after that be|fore it became univer&s;al in Europe, we &s;hall not greatly wonder at the bigotry and rude|ne&s;s of manners in our ance&s;tors; and we &s;hall cea&s;e to reflect upon tho&s;e credolous times.</P>
<P>To the &s;core of ignorance we are to place the many and hideous &s;tories which have been formerly related of apparitions, goblins, and witches, that have at times infe&s;ted different parts of Europe; and even in England have claimed the attention of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical power: in&s;tances of which are to be found in our hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>At this period I believe there are but few who give credit to &s;uch romances. The Spec|tator
<PB N="14" REF="024796_0013_0FC88EF5916D0F40">and his cotemporaries pretty well clear|ed the country of witches. As to gho&s;ts, the la&s;t that made its appearance was the notori|ous Fanny of Cock-lane; and this arch &s;pirit was effectually laid, as it is called, in a court of ju&s;tice; where the gentlemen of the law carefully collected her a&s;hes, and, like alche|mi&s;ts, turned them into gold; &s;o that there is no fear of any &s;pirits ri&s;ing from her urn.</P>
<P>We are now, my intelligent fair, fully con|vinced of the ridiculous fallacy of &s;uch bug|bears; and at this time there is &s;carcely a fe|male but can enjoy, without one dreadful ap|prehen&s;ion, a cool and &s;ilent walk by moon|light: a plea&s;ure their mothers could hardly be per&s;uaded to partake of; for, not longer than half a century ago, if a dauntle&s;s virgin had thus pre&s;umptuou&s;ly ventured, the af|frighted parents would have been apprehen|&s;ive for their daughter, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould, &s;ome time or another, be puni&s;hed for &s;uch impious audacity.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee prodigies and wonders daily vani&s;hing, in proportion as literary know|ledge, and the general improvement of the under&s;tanding, are cultivated.</P>
<P>To &s;ome future &s;ea&s;on, perhaps, we mu&s;t po&s;tpone the elucidation of marks, the &s;uppo|&s;ed con&s;equences of frights and longings: yet, if this matter &s;hould be a &s;ubject of di&s;pute with the ladies for the pre&s;ent, I doubt not that a little time and candid ob&s;ervation will commit the very idea of &s;uch romantic opi|nions,
<PB N="15" REF="024796_0014_0FC88EF998F43AB8">together with that of frights, and eve|ry other &s;uper&s;titious error, to eternal obli|vion.</P>
<P>A fright is generally believed to have the &s;ame unlucky effect upon pregnant women, as a di&s;appointment of their wi&s;hes will pro|duce. Hence they are perpetually racked be|tween hope and fear, to the torment of them|&s;elves, and every body about them; and are &s;ometimes &s;o extravagant with regard to a wi&s;h or longings, as not to be &s;atisfied but at an immen&s;e expen&s;e: for we have heard that the&s;e &s;trange cravings are not altogether con|fined to the palate; they &s;ometimes extend them&s;elves to equipage, jewels, dre&s;s, baubles, &amp;c. As a proof that &s;uch chimerical notions even at this time prevail, the reader is de&s;ired to attend to the following relation.</P>
<P>Since the fir&s;t edition of this work went to the pre&s;s, the author happened to dine, in company with a pregnant lady totally free from prejudice, at the hou&s;e of an intimate female friend, who has a heart truly good and &s;ympathetic. Her teeming vi&s;itor took notice of a toy; it was a pigeon-hou&s;e made of Staf|ford&s;hire ware, and in a baby-hou&s;e would appear a proper ornament: yet the forebo|dings of this good matron, le&s;t her friend &s;hould have entertained a longing for it, ope|rated &s;o &s;trongly, that the kindly ordered it to be put into her vi&s;itor's carriage. The preg|nant lady &s;trongly objected to it indeed, but to no purpo&s;e; in&s;omuch that &s;he was obliged to take the pigeon-hou&s;e home.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="024796_0015_0FC88EFFB53F7C28">But not to dwell upon &s;uch like particulars, which, neverthele&s;s, have been frequently in|troduced in &s;upport of whim&s;ical de&s;ires, and which are continually magnified in the rela|tion, we &s;hall confine our remarks to the ge|neral manner in which this magic operates.</P>
<P>As I have univer&s;ally been thought an infidel in matters of this kind, the ladies have treated me accordingly; nay, frequently, when I have begged quarter, it has been cruelly de|nied; which cautions me at this time to be mode&s;tly humble and diffident. I &s;hall a&s;&s;ert nothing; but by fair and impartial enquiry endeavour to &s;earch out the truth.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of my &s;uppo&s;ed want of faith in the&s;e affairs, there is &s;carcely a female I am acquainted with, who does not trea&s;ure up every &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tory of this kind that &s;he hears, to tell it me with all the advantages that a per&s;ua&s;ive tongue can give, in order to bring about my conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>I verily believe, that, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e my good friends, I could furni&s;h a large folio volume of &s;uch hi&s;tories. It is a &s;pacious field for the fancy to rove in. A variety of preternatural marks in living per&s;ons may be produced every day: nor can the exi&s;tence of the&s;e extraordinary appearances be denied; for that is inconte&s;tible, as every one can vouch. The true cau&s;e of &s;uch wonders, therefore, is the &s;ubject of our pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I &s;hall make bold to de|clare, that I never met with one of the&s;e ble|mi&s;hes
<PB N="17" REF="024796_0016_0FC88F0099C01250">which altogether &s;truck my fancy with re&s;pect even to the imaginary likene&s;s; or which, as to the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e, engaged my rational confidence.</P>
<P>I have been &s;howed a mark that was com|pared to the rhind of bacon, and told a &s;trange &s;tory of the mother's longing for a gammon. I fancied it to be like the tinge of a mulatto, and congratulated the parents that the child was not altogether &s;warthy.</P>
<P>A lady of my acquaintance has oftentimes declared that &s;he is marked with a perfect pig; but I never could obtain the &s;ight of this rarity, it not being conveniently &s;ituated for public in&s;pection. A little while ago, I was in company with her mother, an elderly woman, and quite a &s;tout champion, as I found, for marks and blemi&s;hes, in con&s;equence of frights and longings. Upon a particular enquiry, it appeared that &s;he was unacquainted with the accident, until &s;ome con&s;iderable time after the birth; and then, from the appearance of the mark, &s;he very well remembered the oc|ca&s;ion of it&mdash;which was this. When &s;he was very near her time, her hu&s;band and &s;elf were invited to the hou&s;e of a relation, living at &s;ome di&s;tance, who, &s;he knew, had &s;ome very fine &s;ucking pigs. They both thought the ride would be too much for her; but &s;he recollects her having &s;aid, that &s;he would go at all e|vents, if &s;he was &s;ure they would dre&s;s one of the pigs for dinner. However, the hu&s;band went alone, and returned in the evening with
<PB N="18" REF="024796_0017_0FC88F022DF06428">a quarter of a pig that had been dre&s;&s;ed on purpo&s;e for their dinner, her relation know|ing &s;he was fond of it. But alas! as her evil genius would have it, when &s;he &s;at down to &s;upper, &s;he could eat but very little; and at that time unluckily rubbed the part with her hand, where her daughter is marked, which, &s;he is very certain, occa&s;ioned the form of a pig. I a&s;ked her how the child could be mark|ed, &s;ince &s;he had her de&s;ire? No matter for that, an&s;wered &s;he: though I had the pig, the child to be &s;ure mu&s;t be marked; becau&s;e I longed for it nice and hot, with good plum &s;auce and gravy, but was obliged to eat it cold. We all laughed heartily at the conclu&s;ion, though, as the reader may judge, from differ|ent motives; but the old lady thought &s;he had obtained a complete victory.</P>
<P>I have given this little hi&s;tory, to &s;how the ab&s;urd manner in which the&s;e things are u&s;u|ally accounted for. It will be al&s;o proper in this place to remark the notorious di&s;&s;imilari|ty between &s;uch blemi&s;hes and their &s;uppo&s;ed originals. We are to take notice, likewi&s;e, of the ea&s;e with which the fancy is impo&s;ed up|on, or impo&s;es on it&s;elf in &s;uch ca&s;es, even to infatuation; magnifying the mo&s;t trifling con|jectures into the &s;tronge&s;t confirmations. How often do women rack their minds, to find out the origin of the&s;e marks! which evidently proceeds from their aver&s;ion to be thought capable of producing an offspring with any imperfections; and their &s;ervants and nur&s;es,
<PB N="19" REF="024796_0018_0FC88F03A5167DD8">con&s;idering it actually as their bu&s;ine&s;s, are always ready to help them out upon the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions.</P>
<P>Fruit, wine, boiled lob&s;ters, fre&s;h &s;almon, and &s;uch like things of a red colour, are the mo&s;t common marks; and there is &s;carcely a family in the kingdom, but &s;ome one or more of them can produce in&s;tances of this &s;ort.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;trange effects, we are told, not only happen to the human race, but al&s;o, how wonderful to relate!&mdash;to brutes. There is a worthy family, who&s;e veracity is not to be doubted, that are firmly per&s;uaded of the fol|lowing fact; of which they were all &s;pecta|tors. I &s;hall deliver the account, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, in the lady's words, who favoured me with the relation.</P>
<P>Her father's favourite cat happened to pro|duce a kitten, which, to the &s;urpri&s;e of all the family, was marked upon the back with a rat. As the kitten grew, the rat increa&s;ed likewi&s;e; till, at the end of &s;ome months, it dropped off the kitten, quite perfect in its form;&mdash;and the lady had it in her own hand. I was que&s;tion|ed, very particularly, whether I could any longer doubt the con&s;equences of longing and frights, &s;ince it even extended to brutes&mdash;for, continued &s;he, what could be the cau&s;e of this, but the creature being di&s;appointed of &s;ome rat &s;he was pur&s;uing?</P>
<P>Thus clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, I begged her yet to pardon my want of belief. As to the cau&s;e, I was &s;ilent about it; that there was a &s;ub&s;tance
<PB N="20" REF="024796_0019_0FC88F08D7D53240">upon the kitten, which fell off, as related, I had no doubt.&mdash;What then could I doubt?&mdash; That their own imaginations deceived them.&mdash; How was that po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;Much more &s;o than they were aware of.&mdash;Where is the rat, ma|dam?&mdash;Thrown away long ago.&mdash;That is un|lucky; for, had I &s;een it, probably it might have &s;truck me as re&s;embling an owl, or &s;ome other thing altogether as extravagant. It was downright ob&s;tinacy in me; for I would not believe any thing. I further &s;aid, had it been a rat, I thought &s;he would have wanted cou|rage to touch it&mdash;even &s;uppo&s;ing it to be dead; and had it been alive, it would certain|ly have run away, and prevented her. This plea&s;antry abated &s;omewhat of the earne&s;tne&s;s of our argument; and a laugh made us very good friends&mdash;but I was an incredulous man.</P>
<P>I have heard of a woman &s;urpri&s;ed in the &s;treet, when &s;he was very near her time, by a per&s;on with a withered arm: upon her return home, the fright threw her into labour, and &s;he was delivered of a child with a withered arm. How can we po&s;&s;ibly believe &s;uch an immediate effect as this to be produced?&mdash; Is it to be credited, that the mother's terror &s;hould in&s;tantly bla&s;t the arm of the child, thus rendering it &s;imilar to the object of horror?</P>
<P>And if this be rejected, how can we allow the total lo&s;s of a limb from a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> cau&s;e? &mdash;Could it be annihilated? This no one will a&s;&s;ert. If not, &s;uppo&s;ing the effect to take place, and the arm of the keg &s;hould be &s;epa|rated
<PB N="21" REF="024796_0020_0FC88F0C76F6DCA0">from the body, what becomes of it? Such divided part is never to be found upon the&s;e occa&s;ions. On the contrary, where there is an addition to the form, proceeding al&s;o, as we are told, from fright; &s;uch, for in|&s;tance, as a toe or finger extraordinary, an arm or a leg; in the name of wonder, from what &s;ource can tho&s;e exuberances be &s;o im|mediately produced? Is it not a&s;toni&s;hing, that &s;uch credulous infatuations &s;hould thus beguile our rea&s;on?</P>
<P>Not to trouble my fair readers with any more of the&s;e relations, which, by prejudiced per&s;ons, are accounted undeniable, I &s;hall ju&s;t mention a few facts for the con&s;ideration of the candid.</P>
<P>A lady of my particular acquaintance, du|ring the time of her pregnancy, was unfortu|nately overturned in a coach; by which acci|dent, as &s;he endeavoured to get out, the fir&s;t joint of her &s;econd finger was entirely broken off. This was an alarming circum&s;tance to all her friends, and the dreadful apprehen&s;ions of the child's being born a cripple di&s;turbed eve|ry one; but, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of her acquaintance, &s;he was delivered of a fine and perfect boy.</P>
<P>An eminent practitioner relates a &s;tory to this effect, which is equally to be credited, as happening under his own ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>A lady of quality being in convul&s;ions, the family &s;ent for the doctor in great ha&s;te. He found her upon the bed, extremely ill indeed.
<PB N="22" REF="024796_0021_0FC88F0E26E569A8">When her lady&s;hip came a little to her&s;elf, &s;he cried out, The black cat! the black cat! &mdash;her well-known particular aver&s;ion to this dome&s;tic animal &s;eemed to point out the cau&s;e of the di&s;a&s;ter, of which till now they were entirely ignorant; and the &s;ervants diligent|ly &s;earched for the object; when in a tub, placed to receive the rain-water near her lady|&s;hip's dre&s;&s;ing-room window, poor pu&s;s was di&s;covered.</P>
<P>This &s;ight &s;o terribly affected the lady, that her fears were ever uppermo&s;t, and &s;he was mi&s;erable until the time of her delivery. Nei|ther could her friends pacify her, nor the ar|guments of &s;o able a man bring her to rea&s;on. Notwith&s;tanding all they could &s;ay, &s;he was fully per&s;uaded her child's face would be like this black cat's. At length Lucina &s;miled pro|pitious on its birth; and her lady&s;hip's appre|hen&s;ions vani&s;hed, upon her being brought to bed of a lovely boy, without either mark or blemi&s;h.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t about the &s;ame time, it happened that the &s;ame gentleman delivered another per&s;on of a boy al&s;o. The child had a &s;mall darki&s;h &s;pot upon the forehead. He was curious e|nough to interrogate the mother about it, and &s;he mo&s;t ingenuou&s;ly declared, that &s;he was neither &s;en&s;ible of any fright or longing du|ring; the whole time of her breeding.</P>
<P>Had this blemi&s;h happened to the child of the noble parent, the doctor truly ob&s;erves, the black cat would undoubtedly have occa|&s;ioned a remarkable anecdote in the hi&s;tory of
<PB N="23" REF="024796_0022_0FC88F1070A24588">her lady&s;hip's hou&s;e;&mdash;for by all her family and friends it would have been looked upon as an inconte&s;tible proof of the&s;e prodigies; and, give me leave to add, with much more &s;eeming plau&s;ibility, too, than the generality of the&s;e &s;tories can boa&s;t; becau&s;e the lady had declared her apprehen&s;ions at the time of the &s;uppo&s;ed injury.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here add another in&s;tance of an ap|prehen&s;ion altogether as fruitle&s;s, as that of the noble lady. It was made known to me, in con&s;equence of reading the above to a parti|cular friend, who immediately replied, that he was under great anxiety for his wife, upon account of her being terrified at the &s;ight of a per&s;on who had a very unhappy blemi&s;h on her face. The wife of this gentleman, by chance going to St. Paul's church, was placed in a &s;tall exactly oppo&s;ite to the unfortunate object, which affected her &s;o much, that her devotion was entirely lo&s;t; and &s;he talked of this poor woman continually after &s;he left the church.</P>
<P>In a few weeks this lady went again to St. Paul's, and was unluckily placed oppo&s;ite the &s;ame per&s;on; which &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her, that &s;he dared not to venture there any more. Sure|ly this is as &s;triking an in&s;tance as we can &s;uppo&s;e. I told my friend I was glad he ac|quainted me of it before his wife was brought to bed, and that I &s;hould pay great attention to the con&s;equence; but at the &s;ame time de|&s;ired he would endeavour to make both him|&s;elf
<PB N="24" REF="024796_0023_0FC88F12A632FDE0">and wife very ea&s;y, a&s;&s;uring him, on the ob&s;ervation of my&s;elf and others, how little room there was to be under any di&s;mal appre|hen&s;ion on this account. To fini&s;h the &s;tory, his wife was &s;oon after delivered of a fine and perfect child. Since which, this lady has de|clared her apprehen&s;ions &s;o terrified her, that &s;he dared not to look at the child, till &s;he col|lected from the conver&s;ation of her attend|ants, that the boy's face was free from ble|mi&s;h. What a cruel &s;u&s;pen&s;e and painful &s;uf|ferance mu&s;t this have been to a mother!</P>
<P>Not long ago I was in the chamber of a la|dy newly delivered: her mother being pre|&s;ent, took me to the window, and in great di&s;|tre&s;s acquainted me the child had a large mark upon the right &s;ide of its face; that &s;he was terrified at the thoughts of breaking it to her daughter, and begged me to acquaint her of it. Accordingly, after congratulating the good lady in the &s;traw, upon her own health and a fine baby, in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, I joco&s;ely told her that we were at a lo&s;s to ac|count for a pretty &s;pot upon the child's face, and mu&s;t de&s;ire her to inform us of the occa|&s;ion of it. After a very minute recollection, &s;he frankly confe&s;&s;ed &s;he did not remember any one thing that &s;he longed for during her pregnancy, neither could &s;he any how account for the accident.</P>
<P>A variety of other circum&s;tances might be enumerated, to di&s;credit, though many &s;tories are related to confirm, this wonderful affair.
<PB N="25" REF="024796_0024_0FC88F14D792C658">I &s;hall not, however, introduce further parti|culars, though divers have happened within my notice; but conclude this letter with re|marking, that in every in&s;tance before rela|ted, where the misfortune of a blemi&s;h was apprehended, it did not happen; and in the other ca&s;es, where marks appeared, they were entirely unexpected, and the cau&s;e of them totally unknown to the mothers; which, I may venture to &s;ay, has always been the ca&s;e. If, therefore, women would wi&s;h to be cre|dited in the&s;e &s;tories of frights and longings, let them declare, before they are delivered, like the two ladies mentioned in this letter, that they have marked the child, and make known the cau&s;e of it. Nothing le&s;s can prove this fact; and, till then, even the po&s;&s;ibility of it may very rea&s;onably be doubted; for &s;ure|ly we may conclude that &s;o remarkable an ef|fect of &s;ympathy can never take place, with|out the immediate and mo&s;t certain know|ledge of the mother.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.
Of Marks&mdash;&s;howing that &s;uch blemi&s;hes may happen in|dependently of the mother's imagination.</HEAD>
<P>AS to longings, I doubt not but every per|&s;on mu&s;t have been &s;en&s;ible of &s;uch inclinations. I can an&s;wer for my&s;elf, that, when indi&s;po&s;ed, and my &s;tomach rather weak, I have many times &s;uffered not a little, in being di&s;appointed of a thing that &s;eemed particularly to &s;trike my fancy: &s;urely I may be allowed to &s;ay, that the prejudices of fe|male education are likely to encourage &s;uch inclinations to a much greater degree in preg|nant women, who&s;e appetites are u&s;ually weak and fanciful; and, as it is the ca&s;e in every pa&s;&s;ion when too extravagantly indulged, I take it for granted, ladies may be &s;ometimes very much hurt by &s;uch a di&s;appointment, in|dependently of &s;uper&s;titious, tormenting ap|prehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>I would wi&s;h to arm every female brea&s;t with the re&s;olution nece&s;&s;ary for her own hap|pine&s;s. Yet I do not deny but upon a thou&s;and occa&s;ions the ladies &s;uffer, unavoidably as it
<PB N="28" REF="024796_0026_0FC88F1C00301880">were, from fear; and materially &s;o in the pre|&s;ent in&s;tance.</P>
<P>Women, from the delicacy of their frame, and the particular mode of education in polite countries, are, without doubt, much more un|der the dominion of fear than men, who are continually &s;purred on by cu&s;tom and vigour to exert their courage. This renders a variety of objects, although terrible to the fair &s;ex, &s;o familiar to ours, that contempt alone is often|times a &s;ecurity again&s;t many &s;uch horrible intruders.</P>
<P>We confe&s;s, then, that women are exceed|ingly &s;ubject to fear: it is al&s;o granted, that, in things they long for, they may be painful|ly di&s;appointed. It is not denied but that there are oftentimes very extraordinary appearan|ces at the birth, which the fancy likens to a variety of things; but it does not therefore follow, that we are bound to believe &s;uch marks or blemi&s;hes to be the effect of fright, or the con&s;equences of a parent's di&s;appoint|ment.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t letter, we gave &s;everal relations on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion: I &s;hall now beg leave to propo&s;e a few queries, which, if al|lowed, in my opinion, &s;eem in part to account for the&s;e extraordinary appearances; and what cannot be illu&s;trated upon a rational en|quiry, why may we not &s;uppo&s;e to proceed from hidden, accidental cau&s;es in the opera|tions of nature? Since excre&s;cences upon trees, plants, and indeed blemi&s;hes on almo&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="024796_0027_0FC88F1DE46C0538">every kind of animals, (of which daily expe|rience will convince a common ob&s;erver), &s;eem &s;trongly to authori&s;e &s;uch a conjecture; I &s;ay, why may we not &s;uppo&s;e this to be the true rea&s;on, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a won|der-working imagination?</P>
<P>Will not an inflammation upon the eye fre|quently produce an univer&s;al redne&s;s over that part which otherwi&s;e appears beautifully white?</P>
<P>What is the cau&s;e of this &s;urpri&s;ing altera|tion?</P>
<P>Mu&s;t not there ever have been a fluid circu|lating in tho&s;e tender ve&s;&s;els?&mdash;And mu&s;t not that fluid be nece&s;&s;arily limpid?</P>
<P>Are not tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, therefore, unle&s;s in|jured, too &s;mall to admit the &s;anguinary fluid in its compact and red &s;tate?</P>
<P>And does it not evidently appear, that they mu&s;t be con&s;iderably di&s;tended, before the red blood can be admitted, which denotes this in|flammation?</P>
<P>Save where the virgin blu&s;h brings the blood into the cheek, or the ro&s;y-coloured nymph rivals our courtly beauties;&mdash;does not the whitene&s;s of the &s;kin, in almo&s;t every part of the body, plainly &s;how that its ve&s;&s;els equal|ly deny the admi&s;&s;ion of this red fluid?</P>
<P>We are told, by curious enquirers, that, for &s;everal months after conception, the embryo receives its &s;upport from a lympid fluid, and that the form it&s;elf is nearly limpid, or co|lourle&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="024796_0028_0FC88F20511F9738">If &s;o, are not the ve&s;&s;els of an unborn child, as it arrives nearer to the birth, gradually en|larged, &s;o as in the proper parts to give ad|mi&s;&s;ion to this red &s;anguinary fluid?</P>
<P>May not therefore &s;ome accidental pre&s;&s;ure upon a pregnant woman&mdash;the violence of a &s;udden jolt&mdash;or the &s;hock received by a fal&s;e &s;tep or a fall, with a variety of other ca&s;ual|ties, convey &s;uch an injury to the tender em|bryo, as upon &s;ome part of the &s;kin to occa&s;ion a &s;imilar effect to that of the eye?</P>
<P>Do we not oftentimes ob&s;erve inflamma|tions in the eye to be in a manner habitual?</P>
<P>Why may we not then &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e deli|cate ve&s;&s;els, when thus di&s;tended, to be &s;o op|pre&s;&s;ed by the particles of the fluid which ru&s;h into them, as never more to be able to reco|ver their natural &s;ize?</P>
<P>Hence the&s;e parts, and the&s;e parts only, giving admi&s;&s;ion to the red blood&mdash;is it not probable that they may a&s;&s;ume the various forms, which in various infants are imagined to re&s;emble &s;o many different things?</P>
<P>The cure of the before-mentioned inflam|mation of the eye frequently depends, not up|on bleeding, but upon con&s;tringing the ve&s;&s;els, and re&s;toring them to their original &s;tate, &s;o that they again only admit their proper limpid fluids; and perhaps, if a&s;tringent applications were u&s;ed at the birth, where a &s;trong pre&s;&s;ure could be made upon the particular part, many of the&s;e blemi&s;hes might in a great mea&s;ure, if not altogether, be removed.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="024796_0029_0FC88F219FEA9010">Such are our conjectures on the cau&s;e of tho&s;e marks which are totally of, or approach|ing to, a red colour. But there are other ble|mi&s;hes, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, my readers may take for granted cannot be accounted for by this way of rea&s;oning; &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as appear to be of a light and dark brown, of a chocolate and black colour. Neverthele&s;s, my fair friends, permit us candidly to pro|ceed.</P>
<P>A blow &s;ometimes &s;tains the &s;kin yellow; if the part be much brui&s;ed, the tinge is deeper, and frequently turns quite black. A curious ob&s;erved mu&s;t have noticed, in tho&s;e per&s;ons who from violent blows have received &s;uch contu&s;ions as are vulgarly called black eyes, that the &s;kin, before it returns to its natural colour, a&s;&s;umes a great variety of different hues; all proceeding from the &s;ame fir&s;t cau&s;e. Is it not then probable, that &s;ome &s;uch accident happening to an unborn child, may produce a &s;imilar effect? This perhaps will be allowed: but then why &s;hould &s;uch blemi&s;hes continue in children, &s;ince they u&s;ually di&s;appear in the ca&s;e before mentioned? However, to proceed in the enquiry: Such effects being admitted, their permanency then is the difficulty to be overcome. Let us con&s;ider, that, although in mature life the con&s;titution has generally &s;trength &s;ufficient to repel mo&s;t accidents, not in&s;tantly mortal, yet in childhood, and old-age, the powers of the body are overcome by very &s;light injuries. In the meridian of life,
<PB N="32" REF="024796_0030_0FC88F288C207A18">tho&s;e parts of the body, which are disfigured by accidents, mo&s;t commonly recover them|&s;elves; neverthele&s;s many in&s;tances are to be produced, even in adults, where the &s;kin con|tinues di&s;coloured. Brui&s;es and other injuries upon the &s;hins, particularly in feeble con&s;titu|tions, frequently occa&s;ion marks that never di&s;appear. The &s;ame is likewi&s;e ob&s;erved upon the legs of tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to &s;it too near fire, in which ca&s;e we &s;ay they have burnt their &s;kins; and old &s;ores ge|nerally leave &s;uch marks. I have &s;een many of the&s;e la&s;ting blemi&s;hes. My readers proba|bly recollect the fact, and al&s;o that &s;uch inju|red parts a&s;&s;ume a variety of colours; black, red, brown, motley, &amp;c. much re&s;embling tho&s;e which are &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from the force of imagination.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, we find &s;uch like appear|ances are &s;ometimes permanent in the differ|ent periods of life, what can be &s;aid to di&s;|prove their continuance in infants, when &s;up|po&s;ed to happen either before or at the time of delivery? For &s;urely we may conclude, the more delicate the form is, it will prove the more &s;u&s;ceptible of injuries, and tho&s;e in|juries will la&s;t the longer; the tender ve&s;&s;els in &s;uch ca&s;es not being &s;o able to recover them&s;elves. And as we often find it to be &s;o in the feeblene&s;s of age, and in a variety of other in&s;tances&mdash;why may we not in the tender embryo al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e blemi&s;hes &s;ome|times to remain, and be durable?</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="024796_0031_0FC88F2AE6D3B280">But if you think the above rea&s;oning not &s;ufficently plau&s;ible, let us con&s;ider the differ|ence of complexion in different per&s;ons of this country&mdash;but principally the different colours of Europeans and Africans: and &s;ince we find appearances &s;o diametrically oppo&s;ite in the &s;kins of per&s;ons, why may not the &s;ame con|tra&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure take place in the &s;kin of one and the &s;ame per&s;on, through a kind of error in nature from her intended &s;cope?</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.
OF MISCARRIAGES.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now, my delicate fair ones, en|tering upon a &s;ubject which requires &s;ome circum&s;pection, to divide the province of the phy&s;ician from the advice of a friend.</P>
<P>There are undoubtedly con&s;titutional er|rors, which oftentimes prevent women from becoming joyful mothers; and they may be hindered al&s;o by accidental circum&s;tances. Both the&s;e con&s;iderations, however, belong to the phy&s;ician. In a word, therefore, the&s;e directions do not extend to &s;uch remote cau|&s;es; my coun&s;els at pre&s;ent being de&s;igned to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in your own &s;phere.</P>
<P>The de&s;ire of children is evidently predo|minant in almo&s;t every female di&s;po&s;ition: it mu&s;t be certainly owing to the wi&s;e ordination of Providence, that their education is &s;o ad|mirably calculated to encourage this fondne&s;s. How engaging are the childi&s;h amu&s;ements of a daughter!&mdash;Let us picture an innocent little girl fondly care&s;&s;ing a waxen image, dre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="38" REF="024796_0035_0FC88F36E6E4B9E0">and undre&s;&s;ing it with all the pomp and impor|tance of a tender mother. What a delightful employment!&mdash;how amiable does the child her&s;elf appear!&mdash;and &s;o endearing is this fe|male province, that it is ju&s;tly remarked to grow up with the &s;ex into life.</P>
<P>I have, with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure, &s;een many young ladies, women grown, happily amu&s;ing them&s;elves at their younger &s;i&s;ter's baby-hou&s;e, and often di&s;covered a crim&s;on blu&s;h, that genuine mark of female mode&s;ty, ari&s;ing from their being &s;omewhat confu&s;ed in &s;uffering them&s;elves to be thus unexpectedly &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are, indeed, &s;ome per&s;ons who have declared an aver&s;ion to children. I have pain|fully &s;uffered from the enumeration of the difficulties and inconveniences which they de|&s;cribe parents to labour under, who have the care of a little family.&mdash;Selfi&s;h and un&s;ocial con&s;iderations!</P>
<P>God has univer&s;ally manife&s;ted, that the whole human race are dependent upon one another; and tho&s;e per&s;ons, who think and act thus narrowly, can neither be accounted good characters in them&s;elves, nor worthy members with re&s;pect to &s;ociety. But, alas! they are &s;trangers to the feelings of parental fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>Certain I am, ye amiable wives, that, if it be your good fortune to become happy mo|thers, your children, tho&s;e dear pledges of love, if prudently educated, prove not only
<PB N="39" REF="024796_0036_0FC88F381DB243B0">an engaging comfort to your&s;elves, but a great and la&s;ting &s;ecurity for the affections of your hu&s;bands. Tru&s;t me, there is a time when the charms of beauty mu&s;t cea&s;e, and the pa&s;&s;ions of youth bend, to the maje&s;ty of wi&s;dom:&mdash; 'tis then good-nature and good-&s;en&s;e, with that e&s;&s;ential ingredient, a cheerful di&s;po&s;i|tion, will in a great mea&s;ure &s;ecure your con|que&s;t; and a charming offspring will a&s;&s;uredly contribute to unite parents in the la&s;ting bonds of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>How de&s;irable, therefore, are children! Even poverty it&s;elf does not prevent the &s;an|guine wi&s;h for them. Let us then endeavour to promote their &s;afe and happy increa&s;e.</P>
<P>The difference of con&s;titution in women is an important affair: there are &s;ome who upon every trifling occa&s;ion are &s;ubject to mi&s;car|riages&mdash;others, again, who, in &s;pite of the mo&s;t direct and powerful means, are often compelled to bear the token of unwarrantable amours; and there are in&s;tances even of mar|ried women, who, not &s;uppo&s;ing them&s;elves to be breeding, have been treated in the mo&s;t likely manner to bring about an abortion&mdash;but all in vain. A remarkable &s;tory of this kind occurs to my memory, which I relate from my own knowledge.</P>
<P>An hone&s;t labouring man and his wife lived together many years without having children; and they were both beyond the meridian of life, when the poor woman was &s;uppo&s;ed to be afflicted with a drop&s;y. From time to time
<PB N="40" REF="024796_0037_0FC88F3A57CEF0B0">&s;he advi&s;ed with &s;everal eminent phy&s;icians, who, from her appearance and the account &s;he gave, treated her as drop&s;ical; admini&s;tering the mo&s;t powerful remedies again&s;t that di&s;|order.</P>
<P>At length &s;he grew &s;o very big, that all hopes of a cure were given over, and the operation of tapping was recommended. The hu&s;band's circum&s;tances being narrow, and the expen&s;e of this illne&s;s putting it out of his power to employ a &s;urgeon, the poor woman was advi|&s;ed to go into the ho&s;pital: this, however, &s;he refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>A week or two after this, the hu&s;band call|ed, with a mo&s;t joyful countenance, to inform me his wife was brought to bed, and that both the mother and child were likely to do well. I was at that time very young; but my re|flexions upon the oddity of the event deter|mined me to be always wary in the examina|tion of drop&s;ical female patients.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee in this woman, and in a variety of other ca&s;es, where impious efforts have been u&s;ed to promote a mi&s;carriage, that na|ture, in &s;pite of great violence, &s;ometimes will not be interrupted.</P>
<P>Let us then aim at a&s;&s;i&s;ting her in this great work, where the con&s;titution appears not able to go through with it; and point out the mo&s;t rational means to prevent abortion.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t letter, over and above the enqui|ry concerning marks, longings, and frights, greatly tends to this material end. Women of
<PB N="41" REF="024796_0038_0FC88F429D089E00">a delicate form, and too great &s;en&s;ibility, are the mo&s;t liable to mi&s;carry: &s;uch al&s;o are the mo&s;t likely to imbibe, and to be affected by, the prejudices we there wi&s;hed to caution them again&s;t. The power of fear is undoubt|edly &s;overeign over mo&s;t per&s;ons; and this, as it frequently occa&s;ions mi&s;carriages, is tru|ly to be dreaded. If, therefore, the prejudices were di&s;countenanced, the unhappy fear it&s;elf would a&s;&s;uredly cea&s;e.</P>
<P>And further, there is nothing tends more to render life happy, either to men or women, than to conquer, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the pa&s;|&s;ion of fear. This is the mon&s;ter, which in &s;ome degree &s;ubdues us all, and too frequent|ly makes mankind mi&s;erable. There is no ca|lamity but would ea&s;ily become &s;upportable, could we dive&s;t our&s;elves of fear; and daily experience proves women to be mo&s;t &s;ubject to its tortures. How many trifling in&s;ects, that a man continually &s;purns from him, ruffle the brea&s;t of females, and throw them into the greate&s;t agonies!</P>
<P>The evil, therefore, is &s;eated in the imagi|nation; for it is the dreadful apprehen&s;ion of their own mind that torments them; which, by a firm and &s;teady re&s;olution, may general|ly be overcome. Fortitude is an ine&s;timable jewel.</P>
<P>However difficult the ta&s;k appears, the ear|lie&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t prejudices may commonly be conquered. I am &s;en&s;ible, that &s;ometimes it will require great pains, and never can be
<PB N="42" REF="024796_0039_0FC88F44196EBE00">done but by the &s;trength of rea&s;on. Would you, my too &s;u&s;ceptible fair, follow my ad|vice on this &s;ubject, a thou&s;and accidents might be avoided that hourly happen to you upon this, and many other occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on was be&s;towed upon us, both for the pre&s;ervation of our health, and the promo|tion of our happine&s;s. The abu&s;e of it as ne|ce&s;&s;arily de&s;troys the one as the other.</P>
<P>How do we continually reflect upon our|&s;elves for inconveniencies, mental as well as corporeal, that ari&s;e from incon&s;ideratene&s;s and folly? Believe me, ladies, mi&s;carriages are frequently brought about by imprudence. When a wife has the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of be|coming a mother, it is no longer a time to be revelling in midnight a&s;&s;emblies. Such a con|duct not only deprives her of natural re&s;t, but al&s;o endangers her health, and thereby often|times promotes this dreaded evil.</P>
<P>In this and every other point, I beg leave to caution you again&s;t falling into wide ex|tremes. Some ladies I have &s;een madly run|ning up and down, and jumbling all the town over in the mo&s;t jolting hackney-coach that could be procured; and, although at the &s;ame time they complain of being &s;haken to pieces, yet this they &s;ay is to prevent the accident.&mdash; Others never &s;tep out of doors, nay, nor &s;o much as go up and down a pair of &s;tairs, for &s;everal months: this al&s;o is to avoid the dan|ger.</P>
<P>Again let me warn you of both extremes.
<PB N="43" REF="024796_0040_0FC88F459A7452D8">Be this your guide&mdash;whatever exerci&s;e you are capable of taking without fatigue, in|dulge&mdash;but no more. Never, in this point, regard the example of others. Becau&s;e your friend can do this and that, it is no rea&s;on you &s;hould; and if the attempt gives pain, it &s;hould certainly be avoided.</P>
<P>I need not caution the pre&s;ent age again&s;t the pernicious cu&s;tom of lacing too tightly; for a la&s;s of fifteen, in the dre&s;s of our times, would in the la&s;t age have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be ju&s;t at down-lying.</P>
<P>I do not mean to condemn, but to prai&s;e the ladies for giving them&s;elves room in the wai&s;t: neverthele&s;s extremes, you know, are not advi&s;ed. There is a certain medium in every part of life, which is the <HI>je-ne-&s;ais-quoi</HI> that con&s;titutes the agreeable.</P>
<P>It is as uncommon now to &s;ee a young girl crooked, as it formerly was to &s;ee one perfect|ly &s;traight. I believe no one denies that their &s;hapes were greatly injured by the &s;tiffne&s;s of their &s;tays, and by being laced &s;o exceedingly clo&s;e. This pernicious cu&s;tom was frequently the cau&s;e of a bad &s;tate of health, and threw many young women into con&s;umptions. We now rarely &s;ee ladies fainting in public places: but when they did not allow them&s;elves room to breathe, it happened every day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to be hoped the ladies will not again lace them&s;elves up, to di&s;play fine &s;hapes; the Author, how|ever, wi&s;hes to warn them again&s;t &s;o pernicious a fa&s;h|ion.</NOTE> This
<PB N="44" REF="024796_0041_0FC88F471A599EE8">prudent alteration, therefore, &s;o &s;erviceable to maidens, is &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary for married women.</P>
<P>There is another caution at this time to be ob&s;erved. I have frequently beheld, with pain, divers ladies too apt to be lifting and playing with heavy children: there are certain &s;ym|pathetic emotions, altogether natural and laudable, which prompt them to it; and far be it from my thoughts to deprive them of &s;o tender and generous a gratification: neverthe|le&s;s, to &s;ee a delicate little form, very near her time, &s;top a bouncing boy, and catch him in her arms, is really an alarming &s;ight: many mi&s;carriages happen from &s;uch incon&s;iderate|ne&s;s; and, if our conjectures are not wrong, many blemi&s;hes al&s;o by the&s;e means are pro|bably occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>But there is a practice indi&s;criminately u&s;ed even to this day, wor&s;e than all the re&s;t; and that is bleeding. Whether a woman be robu&s;t or weakly, if &s;he is pregnant, &s;he mu&s;t be bled. Has &s;he any pains? No matter.&mdash;Is &s;he in health? Yes.&mdash;But &s;he mu&s;t lo&s;e blood.&mdash; Why? Becau&s;e &s;he is with child. Her mother always did it, and her grandmother, aye, and her great great grandmother too, time out of mind; and therefore can the propriety of it be doubted?&mdash;The&s;e are the general argu|ments u&s;ed by women in favour of bleeding, when they are in perfect health: but if any &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition happens, be it ever &s;o fo|reign to their particular &s;ituations, and which
<PB N="45" REF="024796_0042_0FC88F49DE96B810">perhaps at another time would pa&s;s unnoticed, dreadful con&s;equences are apprehended, if they are not bled: nay, indeed, tho&s;e little temporary inconveniencies which generally and unavoidably attend advanced pregnancy, in their mi&s;taken opinions, call aloud for bleeding.</P>
<P>In our two former letters, we took notice of the difficulty that attends rooting out fixed and prevailing prejudices; and I am appre|hen&s;ive that this is as deeply &s;eated in the minds of women, as tho&s;e of which we there treated. However, let us a&s;k the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of rea&s;on al&s;o in this particular, and &s;earch a lit|tle into the merits of the cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>Is not the infant &s;upported by the mother?</P>
<P>When there are two to be &s;upported, is not more nouri&s;hment required than for one of them only?</P>
<P>Is this then a time, without a real nece&s;&s;ity, to &s;port with the blood of a weakly and deli|cate woman? No, &s;urely.</P>
<P>Let me therefore beg of you, my ingenuous friends, to con&s;ider this matter in a rational light. I have given a plain and ea&s;y clue to pur&s;ue the enquiry; and the &s;ubject will not permit me to enter more fully into it with my fair readers, without a&s;&s;uming the character of the phy&s;ician, and without advancing tho&s;e things, which may, in this collection of let|ters, be con&s;idered as an affront to delicacy.</P>
<P>To your own thoughts then I commit it; and will conclude this letter with &s;aying, that,
<PB N="46" REF="024796_0043_0FC88F5010F69B08">though I do not deny but there are ca&s;es which require bleeding, yet I caution you again&s;t doing it at random, and, indeed, with|out very good advice: at the &s;ame time, I firmly believe &s;uch in&s;tances rarely happen to tho&s;e who are not of a robu&s;t con&s;titution, and am fully per&s;uaded that many women are daily injured by this wrong practice.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.
Mothers milk&mdash;the natural and be&s;t food for infants.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE endeavoured to &s;et forth the ridi|culou&s;ne&s;s of women terrifying them|&s;elves, and every body about them, during their pregnancy, with evils that mo&s;t proba|bly are altogether imaginary. I would wi&s;h my female readers to con&s;ider this &s;ubject in a more exten&s;ive view, and to aim at greater fortitude than the &s;ex can generally boa&s;t, in the common occurrences of life; when the tenderne&s;s of men is not &s;o much engaged, and when the ladies cannot rea&s;onably expect &s;uch kind allowances as are made at this par|ticular time. Think me not &s;evere; a faith|ful monitor mu&s;t &s;peak with freedom; the man who is blind to this foible, mu&s;t be in&s;en|&s;ible to your charms, and unworthy of your confidence. Your happine&s;s is at &s;take, much more &s;o than a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver may ima|gine. Female vivacity &s;oftens the rugged paths of life; and, believe me, &s;elf-love operates powerfully even upon the mo&s;t generous
<PB N="48" REF="024796_0045_0FC88F532858D3B0">minds. The woman who indulges gloomy ideas&mdash;who is continually brooding over me|lancholy&mdash;who, in her hours of dome&s;tic re|tirement, is perpetually rendering her&s;elf mi|&s;erable, and her mo&s;t intimate acquaintance, and deare&s;t relatives, unhappy&mdash;&s;uch a mi&s;ta|ken SHE mu&s;t only expect the cold eye of pi|ty. However powerful her per&s;onal attrac|tions, &s;he will ultimately bani&s;h her hu&s;band and her friends. It will be found her greate&s;t misfortune, and at a time too when it is irre|trievable, to have once had the merit to gain, <HI>perhaps,</HI> a valuable heart, when &s;he has not di&s;cretion enough to keep it.&mdash;The impor|tance of the &s;ubject will, I hope, apologize for this digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o earne&s;tly laboured to con|quer the prejudices concerning marks, in con|&s;equence of frights and longings; and have ex|po&s;ed the fabulous hi&s;tories of tho&s;e wonders. We have likewi&s;e &s;hown how the under&s;tand|ing may be deceived by the forms of fancy; and have no le&s;s earne&s;tly endeavoured to ex|plode the mi&s;taken cu&s;tom of bleeding indi&s;|criminately, during pregnancy&mdash;pointing out, upon rational principles, the ab&s;urdity of all. A ta&s;k equally arduous in every part; a thou|&s;and prejudices being imbibed again&s;t the whole.</P>
<P>Another &s;ubject at this time pre&s;ents it&s;elf to view&mdash;I mean that of women &s;uckling their own children; again&s;t which the pre&s;ent ob|&s;tinately received opinions are &s;till more un|accountable
<PB N="49" REF="024796_0046_0FC88F5561C877D0">than the former; as nothing but a &s;trange perver&s;ion of human nature could fir&s;t deprive children of their mother's milk. Give me leave therefore to ob&s;erve, that milk is the natural &s;upport which the great Author of our being has provided for our infant &s;tate; and I am heartily &s;orry the pre&s;ent manner of bringing up children puts me, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, under the nece&s;&s;ity of proving milk to be the be&s;t food that can be given them.</P>
<P>Milk is a nouri&s;hment produced from the various kinds of food taken in by the mother. Her &s;tomach breaks and dige&s;ts the aliment, which, after various operations of nature, be|comes &s;o far animalized as to be a kind of white blood; from whence animal bodies at all times receive their con&s;tant &s;upport and recruit. This therefore being admitted&mdash;un|til an infant's powers are &s;ufficiently &s;trength|ened to perform &s;o great a bu&s;ine&s;s as that of dige&s;tion, the mother, by the all-wi&s;e appoint|ment of Providence, from her own brea&s;t &s;upplies it with the means of life. Hence no other nouri&s;hment appears &s;o proper for a new-born child.</P>
<P>For the farther information and &s;atisfaction of my female readers, and to convince them that milk is the mo&s;t proper nouri&s;hment for tender infants, I think it will not be improper to give a conci&s;e account of the manner in which grown per&s;ons receive their con&s;tant recruit and &s;upport from their daily food.</P>
<P>Whether it be animal or vegetable diet, or
<PB N="50" REF="024796_0047_0FC88F59297E44C8">a mixture of both, taken into the &s;tomach, the quality of the food is &s;o far altered by the dige&s;tive faculties that a milky nutriment is produced from it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">pa&s;&s;es through the bowels, the milk is taken up by a great number of fine ve&s;&s;els, which, from their de&s;tined office, are called the milky ve&s;|&s;els; and through them it is conveyed into the blood for our &s;upport: and, as before ob|&s;erved, nature has &s;o admirably contrived the animal fabric, that mothers are likewi&s;e ena|bled to &s;upport their young from this con&s;tant &s;upply, which at the &s;ame time al&s;o affords to them&s;elves their own proper nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>This is the grand &s;cheme of nutriment: for, when the&s;e particles of our food, which af|ford us &s;u&s;tenance, are thus taken up by the milky ve&s;&s;els, the gro&s;&s;er parts are, by the &s;ame wonderful con&s;truction of the bowels, rejected and evacuated, in a manner well known to every one.</P>
<P>Whoever, therefore, gives this argument a rational con&s;ideration, will, I tru&s;t, be led to acknowledge milk to be not only the natural, but the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;trengthening nouri&s;h|ment that infants can po&s;&s;ibly receive; becau&s;e their dige&s;tive faculties are, at this time, inca|pable of producing a good and proper milky nutriment from any kind of food which can be given to them.</P>
<P>The Author of Nature has univer&s;ally com|mitted the &s;upport of infants, and the early part of children's education, to women; if it
<PB N="51" REF="024796_0048_0FC88F5B599894F0">were not thus ordained, he would undoubt|edly have furni&s;hed men al&s;o with milk for the nouri&s;hment of their young; and experi|ence convinces us, that women are much bet|ter qualified both by nature and cu&s;tom for this important concern. This &s;y&s;tem of nur&s;|ing, therefore, is peculiarly addre&s;&s;ed to the fair &s;ex, who are mo&s;t intere&s;ted in it, and who will mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly feel the happy or mi&s;erable effects of the manner in which they di&s;charge this fir&s;t great tru&s;t which is repo&s;ed in them. &mdash; Here, indeed, a mother will a&s;&s;uredly reap the happy fruits of fortitude, and tho&s;e likewi&s;e of a lively, cheerful and obliging di&s;po&s;ition. This &s;ubject will be treated at large in the twelfth letter; neverthele&s;s, give me leave to ob&s;erve, in this place, that &s;uch as the mother is, generally &s;peaking, &s;uch will be the fir&s;t, and mo&s;t probably the mo&s;t dura|ble impre&s;&s;ions received by the child. It there|fore naturally follows, that infants, who&s;e minds are early accu&s;tomed to agreeable ob|jects, and who&s;e expanding ideas are gratified with plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, unabated by flavi&s;h fears&mdash;&s;uch, and &s;uch only, as they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> into life, will po&s;&s;e&s;s that generous gratitude, which prompts them to con&s;ider it as a fir&s;t great duty to contribute to the happine&s;s of their parents.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly offended, whenever I ob|&s;erve a child, grown to man or woman's e&s;tate, who &s;hows, upon any occa&s;ion, a want of re|&s;pect or duty to its parents; and more parti|cularly
<PB N="52" REF="024796_0049_0FC88F5D97D66AC0">&s;o, if &s;uch &s;light or contempt be exer|ci&s;ed towards a good mother. Unnatural mon&s;ter! to be wanting in re&s;pect to her who bore him in her womb&mdash;who cheri&s;hed and &s;upported him with her milk&mdash;and for many years after his birth gave up her own plea&s;ures and recreations entirely for his &s;ake&mdash;and who had no cares but for his welfare. I would have a mark &s;et upon the forehead of &s;uch a barbarous &s;avage; and he &s;hould be hunted from the &s;ociety of men.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e mothers, who by a fooli&s;h indul|gence &s;poil their children's tempers and di&s;po&s;itions, are undoubtedly culpable; but the example of a violent, pa&s;&s;ionate, yet negligent and in&s;en&s;ible father, is equally or more to be dreaded. A mother has this plea, that &s;he en|deavours at lea&s;t at the time to make her child happy; and it may be &s;aid, in excu&s;e for her conduct, that &s;he is to be pitied in not know|ing better: but there is no excu&s;e, either to God or man, that can be urged to mitigate the vice and folly of &s;uch a father: the ini|quity re&s;teth with him&s;elf alone; for the be|nevolent Author of our being is not to be ar|raigned upon this or any other occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>How provident is nature in all her works! How wonderfully indulgent to man, and o|ther helple&s;s animals, in their fir&s;t &s;tate of exi&s;tence, by thus enabling the mother to feed her young with nouri&s;hment drawn from her own body, until &s;uch time as the offspring has obtained &s;trength &s;ufficient to provide for it|&s;elf!
<PB N="53" REF="024796_0050_0FC88F600FCCFBA0">This gracious bounty is abu&s;ed only by man, the mo&s;t intelligent of earthly beings; who&s;e mi&s;u&s;e of rea&s;on leads him a&s;tray, whil&s;t humble in&s;tinct directs all other parts of the creation aright.</P>
<P>If we look around us, we &s;hall find every animal that gives &s;uck, carefully fo&s;tering her young: and other enjoyments are no more thought of, until they are capable of provi|ding for them&s;elves. An example by which mankind might profit much: but the &s;trong impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, in this and many other in|&s;tances, &s;ubdues our rea&s;on. Did we con&s;ider the benefit of our children more, and the in|dulgence of our &s;elfi&s;h inclinations le&s;s, the race of man would be more healthy, &s;trong, and vigorous, than we can at pre&s;ent boa&s;t. But, alas! &s;uch is the depravity of human na|ture, that it would be in vain to enlarge upon this topic of complaint; it is therefore our pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to prevent, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, the future growth of the&s;e evils.</P>
<P>Let us, my friends, as you are all intere&s;ted in the enquiry, compare the &s;ucce&s;s of mankind with that of the other animals in rearing their young. A little ob&s;ervation will convince us, that greater numbers of the human race are lo&s;t in their infancy, than of any other &s;pecies; for near one half the deaths, within our bills of mortality, happen to children under five years of age. And further, compare the opu|lent with the ru&s;tic, the &s;ucce&s;s is &s;till exceed|ingly different. How many children of the
<PB N="54" REF="024796_0051_0FC88F6161CB1B98">great fall victims to prevailing cu&s;toms, the effects of riches! How many of the poor are &s;aved by wanting the&s;e luxuries!</P>
<P>Again, compare the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch as &s;uc|kle their own offspring, with that of tho&s;e who commit them to the care of nur&s;es, or bring them up by hand; and we &s;hall there likewi&s;e find an amazing difference: but more of this hereafter.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations, it is evident, that Nature is always preferable to art; whence the brute creation &s;ucceed better than the human, in pre&s;erving their own &s;pecies. And the pea&s;ant, whom nece&s;&s;ity compels to follow nature, is, in this re&s;pect, happier than his lord. Tho&s;e mothers al&s;o, who, in &s;pite of cu&s;tom, pride, or indolence, will take their little babies to their brea&s;t, mu&s;t have more comfort and &s;ucce&s;s, than tho&s;e who cruelly con&s;ign them to the care of fo&s;ter nur&s;es; thereby denying them that food, which is not only the mo&s;t proper, but is ordained like|wi&s;e for their infant &s;tate.</P>
<P>Let me then intreat tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of rearing their children, not to rob them of their natural brea&s;t. Would they wi&s;h them to be healthy and beautiful, let &s;uch mothers give &s;uck: for even wet nur&s;es, we &s;hall find, are very little to be depended upon.</P>

Arguments in favour of &s;uckling&mdash;as well for the mo|ther's &s;ake, as the child's&mdash;and the evils to be appre|hended in delivering children to the care of fo&s;ter nur&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>HEALTH and beauty are de&s;irable, and the latter in particular, to women. They mu&s;t, in this ca&s;e, be united; as it is impo&s;|&s;ible for a woman to be truly beautiful who wants health. Di&s;ea&s;e blights the ro&s;y bloom upon the cheek, turns the delicate whitene&s;s of the &s;kin into a &s;allow hue, and de&s;troys the enchanting lu&s;tre of the eye. How in&s;ufficient is it for a lovely maid to make a conque&s;t, if &s;he cannot keep it, as a wife!</P>
<P>It is not at pre&s;ent my province to enlarge upon the accompli&s;hments of the mind. How nece&s;&s;ary they are to &s;ecure the affections of a hu&s;band, every prudent woman knows: and &s;he mu&s;t be equally &s;en&s;ible, that the elegance of her per&s;on is al&s;o to be regarded; an ad|vantage which tho&s;e who are in a bad &s;tate of health have &s;carcely &s;pirits to attend to: be|&s;ides, illne&s;s too often renders the &s;weete&s;t di&s;po&s;itions cro&s;s and peevi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="024796_0053_0FC88F65DB2A21D0">Tho&s;e who are happy enough to have chil|dren, run the greate&s;t ri&s;k, not only of lo&s;ing them, but of de&s;troying their own health and beauty, by repelling their milk immediately after delivery. It never can be done without producing a fever. Oftentimes tumours, and cancers in the brea&s;t, owe their origin to this pernicious cu&s;tom; a&s;thmatical complaints, and lingering di&s;ea&s;es, are frequently occa|&s;ioned by it; and too commonly, the immedi|ate death of the mother follows from &s;uch ill management.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, my fair pupils, for your own health's &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of your future happine&s;s, how nece&s;&s;ary it is to pre&s;erve &s;uch dear pledges of mutual love. By the&s;e power|ful ties, many a man, in &s;pite of impetuous pa&s;&s;ions, is compelled to continue the pru|dent, kind, indulgent, tender hu&s;band. Did you but thoroughly know the &s;ecret impul&s;es of the human heart, you would not ri&s;k the lo&s;s of your children, by unnaturally denying them the means of life.</P>
<P>Let not the mi&s;taken hu&s;band in&s;inuate, that you will be le&s;s charming in his &s;ight, by do|ing your duty to your little ones: many&mdash; many in&s;tances have I known, of weakly and delicate women, who, at my particular re|que&s;t, have &s;uckled their children, and there|by obtained a much better &s;tate of health; nay, they have been more plea&s;ing in their per&s;ons, after thus becoming happy mothers; and their hu&s;bands have, with plea&s;ure, ac|knowledged their improved charms.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="024796_0054_0FC88F6E560947F8">There may be &s;ome ca&s;es in which it is not prudent for a mother to give &s;uck; but the&s;e in&s;tances very rarely happen: and there may be &s;ome women, who, although they are ever &s;o de&s;irous, cannot &s;uckle; this, however, is but &s;eldom to be urged. I &s;incerely &s;ympa|thi&s;e with tho&s;e unfortunate ladies, who are thus deprived of a happine&s;s, only known to tho&s;e who enjoy it. What &s;hall we &s;ay under the&s;e nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances? Shall we ad|vi&s;e &s;uch mothers to employ a wet-nur&s;e; or to bring their children up under their own management, according to proper rules which &s;hall be laid down in a following letter? They are both, in my opinion, wretched nece&s;&s;ities. Yet, was an infant of my own thus unhappily &s;ituated, without he&s;itation I would prefer the latter; for much is to be apprehended from a child's &s;ucking a &s;trange woman: nothing le&s;s than ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity would make me comply with it.</P>
<P>Too often di&s;ea&s;es, and tho&s;e of the wor&s;t kind, are imbibed from the brea&s;t. It is a &s;hocking truth, but vicious incon&s;tancy is be|come &s;o univer&s;al, even among the lower rank of people, that many women offer them|&s;elves, and are daily employed as wet-nur&s;es, who are labouring under dreadful and infec|tious di&s;ea&s;es. Yet, &s;uppo&s;ing you can arrive at a &s;atisfactory a&s;&s;urance in this point, there is a certain clean&s;ing quality in the milk of a woman immediately after child-bearing, ex|ceedingly nece&s;&s;ary for the new-born babe, in
<PB N="58" REF="024796_0055_0FC88F6F99AC3C30">order to prepare its &s;tomach and bowels for future food: this you very rarely can obtain from a wet-nur&s;e.</P>
<P>There is yet a further evil to be dreaded: as it is through nece&s;&s;ity alone that a woman will de&s;ert her own infant, and take another to her brea&s;t, &s;he may be induced, by the ad|vantage &s;he gains, to conceal her being again with child, and continue to &s;uckle the infant, till it pines away and dies, for want of proper nouri&s;hment. Thou&s;ands have been &s;acrificed by the&s;e means. Should they, however, e&s;|cape, in either ca&s;e they are, too generally, mi&s;erable beings: for, in con&s;equence of the fir&s;t, di&s;ea&s;es of the glands, known by the vul|gar name of the king's evil, and other terrible complaints, &s;ucceed; and in the latter, the rickets, watery gripes, and many other mala|dies, proceeding from a weakly and relaxed habit of body, mo&s;t commonly en&s;ue.</P>
<P>On the other hand, di&s;ea&s;e and death are the u&s;ual con&s;equences of the pre&s;ent erro|neous method of bringing children up by hand. Scarcely one in four of the&s;e little in|nocents live to get over the cutting of their teeth; and the vitiated blood of tho&s;e that e&s;|cape, occa&s;ioned by improper nouri&s;hment, generally renders them infirm, or &s;hort-lived. Almo&s;t every complaint to which children are &s;ubject, appears to me to proceed originally from an improper management of them; for the young of all other animals are full of health and vigour.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="024796_0056_0FC88F712242DBD8">And moreover, independently of the&s;e mis|fortunes, the future happine&s;s of the parent her&s;elf is greatly intere&s;ted in this maternal concern; as it generally falls out, that tho&s;e children who are neglected by their mothers during their infant years, forget all duty and affection towards them, when &s;uch mothers are in the decline of life; and this contempt from a child is nothing le&s;s than plunging a dagger into the brea&s;t of its parent: and be|&s;ides the cruel pangs which &s;he mu&s;t unavoid|ably experience from this want of duty, daily ob&s;ervation convinces us, that widows fre|quently &s;uffer not a little, even in the com|mon conveniencies of life, by the means of tho&s;e very children, who, if properly educa|ted, would have probably become their &s;up|port and comfort.</P>
<P>Such are the melancholy pro&s;pects attend|ing the pre&s;ent unnatural practice of wet and dry nur&s;ing; from which a cur&s;e is oftentimes entailed upon a generation, of which parents ought to e&s;teem them&s;elves the authors. How terrible &s;oever the&s;e things appear, I e&s;teem it my duty to acquaint mothers in particular, what a ri&s;k they run in thus hazarding the health and lives of their children, together with their own pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s; and &s;incerely hope I may imprint the &s;ame ob|jections upon them, that daily experience in my profe&s;&s;ion pre&s;ents to me, again&s;t the&s;e pernicious cu&s;toms.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="024796_0057_0FC88F72979DEDD0">Oh! that I could prevail on my fair coun|try-women, to become &s;till more lovely in the &s;ight of men! Believe it not, when it is in&s;i|nuated that your bo&s;oms are le&s;s charming, for having a dear little cherub at your brea&s;t. I &s;peak from the feelings of a man, and of one too who has an univer&s;al and generous love for the virtuous part of your &s;ex. Tru&s;t me, there is no hu&s;band could with&s;tand the fond &s;olicitations of an endearing wife, would &s;he be earne&s;t in her de&s;ire of bringing up her own children. Re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, when he beholds the object of his &s;oul cheri&s;hing and &s;upporting in her arms the propitious reward of wedlock, and fondly traces his own lineaments in the darling boy, it recalls a thou&s;and delicate &s;en|&s;ations to a generous mind: perhaps he drops a &s;ympathetic tear in recollecting the painful throes of the mother, which &s;he cheeefully bore, to make him &s;uch an ine&s;timable pre|&s;ent. His love, tenderne&s;s, and gratitude, be|ing thus engaged&mdash;with what rapture, mu&s;t he behold her, &s;till carefully intent upon the pre&s;ervation of his own image!</P>
<P>How ardent &s;oever &s;uch an one's affections might be before matrimony, a &s;cene like this will more firmly rivet the plea&s;ing fetters of love:&mdash;for, though a beautiful virgin mu&s;t ever kindle emotions in a man of &s;en&s;ibility, a cha&s;te and tender wife, with a little one at her brea&s;t, is certainly to her hu&s;band the mo&s;t exqui&s;itely enchanting object upon earth:&mdash; and &s;urely, ladies, had fa&s;hion but e&s;tabli&s;hed

The management of infants from the birth&mdash;with direc|tions for putting them to the brea&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>HAPPY, thrice happy woman, now be|come a joyful mother, nurturing her young! Say, tell me, you who know the rap|turous delight, how complete is the bli&s;s of enfolding in your longing arms the dear, dear fruits of all your pains!&mdash;pains now no more remembered. Long may you pre&s;erve the dar|ling, and be doubly ble&s;t in its future beauty, health, and virtue!</P>
<P>I am not unmindful, my charming friends, of the prejudices nece&s;&s;ary to be conquered, before &s;o material a benefit to mankind, as that which I am to picture out in this letter, can be generally obtained. In my la&s;t, the misfortunes attending the neglect of this duty were fully explained; and as I have frequent|ly &s;ucceeded among the private circle of my friends, by addre&s;&s;ing their under&s;tanding, I tru&s;t to the candour of the more ingenuous &s;ex, for my &s;ucce&s;s in public. My endeavour, therefore, throughout, &s;hall be to convince
<PB N="64" REF="024796_0060_0FC88F7DD7CA4948">you that I have rea&s;on and truth on my &s;ide. Happy then &s;hall I think my&s;elf, and amply rewarded for my trouble, if I am fortunate e|nough to meet with your approbation; as your ob&s;ervance of the rules laid down in this lit|le manual mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow. Much de|pends upon your maternal care in the fir&s;t &s;tage of life; it is a plea&s;ing duty, to which you are honourably called, both by nature and the cu&s;tom of all nations.</P>
<P>I am truly &s;en&s;ible, that, according to the pre&s;ent mi&s;taken manner of &s;uckling and rear|ing children, the bu&s;ine&s;s is a fatigue, which frightens many at the fir&s;t attempt; it is a me|thod altogether culpable and unnatural. To this letter particularly belongs the fir&s;t ma|nagement of them. In my next, I &s;hall point out the &s;ub&s;equent errors, and lay down &s;ome general rules, that will not only prove benefi|cial to the child, but make the ta&s;k of &s;uckling ea&s;y and delightful to the mother: even the polite and gay may cheerfully undertake this, at pre&s;ent laborious, employment, without greatly interfering with a &s;ocial life&mdash;for the gloomy ideas of a nur&s;ery will vani&s;h. The paths of nature are ea&s;y and delightful. Come then, my fair, and let us follow her, &s;tep by &s;tep.</P>
<P>We have before ob&s;erved, that a child brings its immediate nouri&s;hment into the world with its birth. Man is born in &s;orrow. The fatigue and pain of delivery, both to the mother and the child, require re&s;t; and ge|nerally,
<PB N="65" REF="024796_0061_0FC88F823395B810">where no improper means are u&s;ed, they both directly-fall into a &s;weet refre&s;hing &s;leep; during which time the milky ve&s;&s;els of the brea&s;t are dilated. Thus with prudent management, in a &s;hort time a &s;mall flow of milk will be obtained. The child, replete with nouri&s;hment at its birth, awakes equally refre&s;hed with the mother, and by eagerly &s;ucking the nipple encourages its more plen|tiful &s;upply.</P>
<P>Sometimes there may be a little inconveni|ence with the fir&s;t child; but this is rendered &s;till greater by keeping it away, perhaps two or three days, from the mother, and &s;uffering her attendants to draw her brea&s;ts, which ge|nerally occa&s;ions &s;ore nipples. The gentle, ea&s;y, and frequent &s;uction of an infant, will not only prevent this inconvenience, but gra|dually invite the milk, thereby relieving the mother from a trouble&s;ome burthen: the nip|ple al&s;o, by this means, will be drawn out, &s;o that the child may &s;uck without further diffi|culty. This is the le&s;&s;on nature teaches; and wi&s;e are they who ob&s;erve her precepts.</P>
<P>As to an infant's clothing, the lighter it is, and the more unconfined, the better; very little covering is nece&s;&s;ary: and the future deformities of &s;hape, &amp;c. not to mention the deplorable lo&s;s of health, &s;ometimes proceed from the dre&s;s being too heavy and confin|ed, at its fir&s;t entrance into life.</P>
<P>I am entirely again&s;t an infant's receiving any nouri&s;hment until it can be put to the
<PB N="66" REF="024796_0062_0FC88F8423E41088">brea&s;t; and much more &s;o again&s;t cramming it with what nur&s;es call pap. The &s;tomach is not yet &s;it for any other food than what Nature has prepared. Art cannot produce a diet with &s;uch an affinity to animal blood, as to render it proper for the tender bowels of a new-born child.</P>
<P>The cries of an infant are generally occa|&s;ioned by the unea&s;ine&s;s it &s;uffers, either from its dre&s;s, or in con&s;equence of thus cramming it. The complaints of children in the&s;e early days, as I before ob&s;erved, and likewi&s;e the difficulty in cutting of teeth, which I &s;hall hereafter &s;peak of, proceed almo&s;t entirely from this wrong practice. Watery gripes, of|fen&s;ive &s;tools, and mo&s;t di&s;orders in their bowels, are altogether occa&s;ioned by impro|per food.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom has rendered this ridiculous prac|tice &s;o univer&s;al, that the good women conti|nually complain it is impo&s;&s;ible for a child to remain without food till the milk comes. Let any mother make a fair and unprejudiced tri|al, and experience will convince her of the truth of our maxim.</P>
<P>How are other animals &s;upported? Nature, in no one part of the creation, is &s;o imperfect, as to be indebted to the wi&s;dom of man to rec|tify her works. And &s;uppo&s;e a ca&s;e, in which the milk does not flow &s;o &s;oon as in general it is expected, let the child, under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, be put to the brea&s;t again and again; a very little nouri&s;hment will at pre&s;ent &s;uf|fice,
<PB N="67" REF="024796_0063_0FC88F86A3AD1268">and that will mo&s;t commonly be obtain|ed from the nipple; if it is not, a little warm milk and water, with a &s;mall quantity of Li&s;|bon &s;ugar, is the only nouri&s;hment, in my opi|nion, that is proper to be given: this advice I have cau&s;ed to be &s;trictly followed, and have happily experienced the good effects of it in an infant of my own, who &s;carcely received any &s;upport from the brea&s;t till after the third day from the birth. Follow, my dear ladies, the&s;e rules; and where there an hundred ac|cidents that now happen to mothers, in con|&s;equence of milk fevers, and to children, in con&s;equence of being denied the brea&s;t, you will rarely find one. I am convinced of the truth of my a&s;&s;ertion by experience, and there|fore am the more bold in recommending it to you, and to the public.</P>

A natural and ea&s;y method of &s;uckling children.&mdash;This duty proved to be a plea&s;ure rather than a fatigue.</HEAD>
<P>NOW then, my nearly intere&s;ted friends, let us ob&s;erve tho&s;e parts of the creation where in&s;tinct only can direct, and for once learn a le&s;&s;on from the tender brute. Behold tho&s;e animals which are familiar to us, how &s;ucce&s;sful they are in bringing up their young: animals that give milk to three, four, five, &s;ix, and &s;ometimes more of their offspring at a birth. How well and happy are their dams! What unremitting care do they take of their nur&s;lings! They never de&s;ert them, until time has given to their bodies &s;trength &s;ufficient to provide for them&s;elves. Provident nature!&mdash; and &s;hall mankind alone di&s;tru&s;t thy good|ne&s;s?

Never more &s;uffer it to pa&s;s for an argument, that a wo|man, who is capable of bearing a child, has not &s;trength to &s;uckle it, when the little crea|tures that &s;urround us can rear a whole fami|ly at once.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="024796_0065_0FC88F8DA8432CB8">O that I could convince you of the brea&s;t alone being a &s;ufficient &s;upport for the mo&s;t robu&s;t of children! Con&s;ider nature well in all her works! Let ignorance and prejudice no longer prevail! Believe this &s;olemn truth, almo&s;t every woman is capable of &s;upporting her babe; and great will prove the advanta|ges, both to her&s;elf and her infant. When it is confined altogether to the brea&s;t, it gains &s;trength every day, and defies di&s;ea&s;e. The mother, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, would not again conceive &s;o quickly; and mi&s;carriages would thereby be, in a great mea&s;ure, pre|vented; unle&s;s hurried on by frequent bleed|ings, and other mi&s;taken practices.</P>
<P>If, for the &s;ake of your families, you value your own lives, attend to this indi&s;putable fact. You your&s;elves know how many women are ruined in their health by not &s;uckling their children; and what numbers are continually &s;acrificed by un&s;kilful methods of treatment, at the time of their delivery. You may&mdash;you &s;hould &s;upport your young; the ta&s;k is ea&s;y and delightful, and the thriving child rewards your pains. It is not laborious. I would not wi&s;h to &s;ee you &s;laves: the tender delicacy of your frame forbids the very thought. The method is plain and ea&s;y&mdash;only follow nature.</P>
<P>Sleep is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to life; and that the &s;tomach &s;hould &s;ometimes be at re&s;t, is as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to health; both the&s;e things the mother and child equally require. Thus the &s;lavi&s;h part of the bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;et
<PB N="71" REF="024796_0066_0FC88F8F32BEF398">a&s;ide; for it is an ab&s;urd and erroneous cu&s;|tom, after &s;tuffing it continually in the day, to keep a child at the brea&s;t all night. This counteracts the operations of nature, not only by depriving it of its re&s;t, but al&s;o, from a con&s;tant fullne&s;s, the powers of the infant-body are prevented from exerting them&s;elves in a proper manner upon the aliment receiv|ed. Hence the &s;tomach and bowels are enfee|bled, and thereby rendered incapable of pro|ducing &s;uch whole&s;ome nouri&s;hment as a child would otherwi&s;e obtain from its food; to which grand purpo&s;e, &s;ound &s;leep and ab&s;ti|nence are equally conductive.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the mother, being con|tinually di&s;turbed during the night, is al&s;o prevented from a&s;&s;imilating that good and perfect milk, which would otherwi&s;e be pro|duced from the food of the day. Hence &s;he becomes ill, grows tired of her ta&s;k, and the crude milk proves noxious to the weakened bowels of the infant. Thus di&s;appointment and death frequently &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>I know it will be urged by &s;ome, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep children quiet and at re&s;t, during the night, and that they cry for food. Let them be managed from the birth agreea|bly to the directions here given, and then I believe few per&s;ons will complain of their be|ing trouble&s;ome. One rea&s;on why children do not &s;leep well by night is, that they are indul|ged too much in the cradle by day, when they &s;hould have exerci&s;e. Another &s;till greater
<PB N="72" REF="024796_0067_0FC88F90A7B851D8">rea&s;on, I am inclined to think, proceeds from pain, occa&s;ioned by improper food, in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages; for I will venture to affirm, that al|mo&s;t every child's bowels, from the pre&s;ent wrong management, are in a &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e, which too frequently grows up with it into life; and thus in infancy the lurking cau&s;e of a bad con&s;titution is oftentimes e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>When their little &s;tomachs, irritated by too large a quantity, and the bad quality of food, become &s;omewhat empty; a pain, probably like what we call the heart-burn, and acidi|ties at the &s;tomach, awakens them from their di&s;turbed &s;lumbers; and the&s;e little creatures can then only di&s;cover their unea&s;ine&s;s by cry|ing. Hence nur&s;es, partly for their own qui|et, and partly through a mi&s;taken notion that children cry only for nouri&s;hment, cram them until they are quite gorged. Such infants ea|gerly devour whatever is given them, becau&s;e the reception of food takes off that too great &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;tomach which cau&s;ed the pain. A &s;imilar effect to this, grown per&s;ons, troubled with the complaints I have now men|tioned, mu&s;t every day experience upon tak|ing nouri&s;hment; for it always affords a pre|&s;ent relief.</P>
<P>Four or five times in the twenty-four hours are &s;ufficient for a child to receive the brea&s;t; and let the following rules be nearly ob&s;erv|ed. About &s;ix or &s;even in the morning, after which the child may be allowed an hour or two's &s;leep;&mdash;again, an hour after the mother
<PB N="73" REF="024796_0068_0FC88F97308EF050">has breakfa&s;ted&mdash;and a third time, if &s;he plea|&s;es, before dinner&mdash;a fourth time, at five or &s;ix o'clock in the evening, being two or three hours after dinner&mdash;and la&s;tly, between ten and eleven, ju&s;t before &s;he goes to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Now, by tho&s;e mothers who have &s;ervants to take off the laborious part of the manage|ment of children, this &s;urely cannot be deem|ed a fatigue: that the ta&s;k it&s;elf is a plea&s;ure, the fondne&s;s of nur&s;es towards children at the brea&s;t fully proves; and that it is an indi&s;pen|&s;able duty, the feelings of human nature evi|dently proclaim.</P>
<P>In the early months, &s;leep may be indulged during the day; but exerci&s;e &s;hould al&s;o at proper intervals be given to children. As they grow &s;tronger, &s;leep &s;hould be le&s;s encou|raged, and exerci&s;e increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal points of management that I have no fault to find with; and, among others, think it needle&s;s to dwell upon the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of keeping children dry and clean: it is &s;o evident, that few nur&s;es are culpable in the&s;e particulars. But as to rocking children, the cu&s;tom is altogether ab&s;urd. He was an ingenious man who invented a mou&s;e-trap, though none but a fool fir&s;t thought of a cra|dle; it was certainly invented to &s;ave the at|tendants trouble, for which, by the bye, they &s;uffer more in return. I never permitted a cra|dle to di&s;grace my nur&s;ery. Infants, if well, &s;leep without this lullaby-labour; and &s;uch forced dozings generally render them peevi&s;h
<PB N="74" REF="024796_0069_0FC88F998AE250E0">and watchful in the night; which is the mo&s;t proper time both for them and their nur&s;es to enjoy their re&s;t.</P>
<P>At the end of &s;ix or &s;even months, when the four fir&s;t teeth ought to appear, children &s;hould be kept awake, and exerci&s;ed as much as po&s;&s;ible; by which time, if managed pro|perly, they will generally gain &s;trength e|nough to &s;hoot the&s;e teeth, and the others will in due cour&s;e be cut with ea&s;e,</P>
<P>Thus you will avoid an evil that &s;weeps away great numbers; of which, however, I &s;hall &s;peak more fully in another letter; for It is entirely owing to the weakne&s;s of their bodies, that children cut their teeth with &s;o much difficulty, and that it is attended with fever, convul&s;ions, and death.</P>
<P>This weakne&s;s of body is but little under|&s;tood; for if a child be bloated with fat, which too generally happens when it is impro|perly fed, the parents and their friends call it a fine child, and admire how it thrives&mdash;when, alas! that very fat is the di&s;ea&s;e which ren|ders its con&s;titution thus feeble: for if the butcher did not kill lambs and calves when they become immoderately fat, they likewi&s;e would die as frequently as children. Which death may be ju&s;tly attributed to the prepo&s;|terous method, &s;o generally in u&s;e, of giving them too much crude un&s;alutary nouri&s;hment; and not managing them in other re&s;pects as nature requires, to &s;trengthen the body from the food received.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="024796_0070_0FC88F9A8F1121C8">After what has been advanced concerning the early part of infant-management, give me leave to ob&s;erve, that the arguments enforc|ed upon this important &s;ubject are &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e mothers who are de&s;irous of preferring a rational &s;y&s;tem to bi|goted maxims and opinions, I would wi&s;h them to be attended to, and I tru&s;t that they will merit their approbation. I do not expect the foregoing rules to be invariably adopted from the birth. I know very well, and it is obvious to tho&s;e who have been attentive to children, that infants require &s;ome more, and others le&s;s attendance, e&s;pecially during the fir&s;t month or two; and a certain time is nece&s;&s;ary, even under the mo&s;t prudent manage|ment, to accu&s;tom them to our wi&s;hed-for habits. There is a wide difference between knowing what is right, and doing it; and <HI>oftentimes,</HI> although we may be de&s;irous of &s;trictly following the mo&s;t prudent maxims, difficulties will unexpectedly ari&s;e in the fir&s;t attempts. Let me therefore de&s;ire you to aim at the above regulations, which by per&s;eve|rance will &s;oon become practicable; and then, determine for your&s;elves, how greatly they will contribute to your own ea&s;e and com|fort, as well as to the advantage of your chil|dren.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.
The proper method of weaning children.</HEAD>
<P>IN my la&s;t letter I condemned the pre&s;ent erroneous method of &s;uckling and feeding children, and recommended a plain and ea&s;y way of rearing them to &s;ix or &s;even months old, upon a rational plan, pointed out by na|ture in many different parts of the creation; and which mo&s;t probably was &s;trictly follow|ed by mankind in the early ages of the world, before luxury, pride, and indolence, crept in|to &s;ociety. Ancient hi&s;tory never could have boa&s;ted of &s;o many &s;trong and valiant men, had not mothers, in their infancy, given &s;trength and vigour to their con&s;titutions; and the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent pu&s;illanimous, feeble, weakly, and di&s;ea&s;ed race of mortals, may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be a&s;cribed to the want of this earlie&s;t maternal care.</P>
<P>Let us talk with the plain and &s;imple hu&s;|bandman, who has a nur&s;ery of trees under his direction: he will tell us it is not &s;ufficient for the &s;tocks to be good of their kind; for,
<PB N="78" REF="024796_0072_0FC88FA30D9226D0">unle&s;s they be &s;ecured from rude winds, and properly cultivated, &s;o that they may receive nouri&s;hment, they will never thrive.</P>
<P>It is literally the &s;ame in animal life; there are unfortunate mothers who daily and wo|fully experience the truth of this argument. How many women are ble&s;t with fine chil|dren, not a blemi&s;h, nor the mark of a di&s;ea&s;e, about them at their birth; and yet before ma|ny months are pa&s;t, for want of prudent care and proper nouri&s;hment, do they not wa&s;te away and die? I need not &s;ay more; the tears of many of my gentle readers, at the unhappy recollection, will &s;ufficiently te&s;tify the fact. May &s;uch tears prove a warning for their fu|ture conduct, and, tru&s;t me, my honoured matrons, your &s;orrow will be turned into Joy&mdash;a joy of the tendere&s;t nature, generous and truly laudable!</P>
<P>Let not man, in the vanity of his heart, tri|umph in a &s;uperiority over the fair &s;ex! for to them alone it belongs to lay the foundation, not of what he is, but what he &s;hould be&mdash; healthy, &s;trong, and vigorous. You, ladies, form an hero in the cradle; and courage is received from the brea&s;t. Gratitude in return demands a protection to you from man. With your&s;elves, therefore, it remains to render him capable of that protection. Thus nature, my fair-ones, ordained your importance in the creation.</P>
<P>But to return to the hu&s;bandman: he will again tell us, that when his trees have receiv|ed
<PB N="79" REF="024796_0073_0FC88FA5356AF128">their infant &s;trength, and their roots begin to &s;hoot, it is nece&s;&s;ary to tran&s;plant them from the nur&s;ery to a more exten&s;ive &s;oil, in order that they may arrive at their natural perfection. So you, my friends, having brought the child through its infant &s;tate, by the tender nouri&s;hment of the brea&s;t, mu&s;t, at the time of weaning, (which, in my opinion, is be&s;t po&s;tponed until it be near a twelve|month old) tran&s;plant your little nur&s;ery like|wi&s;e to a more exten&s;ive &s;oil that is, you mu&s;t afford it more copious nouri&s;hment, in order to bring it to maturer life.</P>
<P>Yet, as great &s;kill and caution are requi|red on the part of the hu&s;bandman, in this bu&s;ine&s;s of tran&s;planting, &s;o great judgment and care mu&s;t be &s;hown by you, in this your province of weaning children; for cu&s;tom has &s;o far deviated from nature, as to render the greate&s;t circum&s;pection nece&s;&s;ary to point out the happy medium.</P>
<P>A further care, therefore, at this time de|mands our attention. Man, according to the pre&s;ent mode, particularly in England, is greatly &s;upported by animal food. A &s;udden tran&s;ition, from one extreme to another, is al|ways dangerous; and every material altera|tion, to avoid inconveniencies, &s;hould be brought about &s;tep by &s;tep. If nature ever in|tended us to de&s;troy the animals around us for prey, &s;urely we may conclude this food never could be de&s;igned for our u&s;e, until &s;uch time as we had teeth to eat it.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="024796_0074_0FC88FA66B1F1FA0">Many ill con&s;equences ari&s;e from per&s;ons devouring their meals too eagerly; and if the &s;tomachs of men are oppre&s;&s;ed, by not &s;uffi|ciently chewing their meat, certainly the weak and tender &s;tomachs of children, who have not as yet teeth &s;ufficient to break it, mu&s;t be &s;till le&s;s fit to receive it altogether whole.</P>
<P>Animal food, then, at this time of life, is ab&s;olutely forbidden, from rea&s;on and reflex|ion; but as it is in &s;ome mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;ary to prepare them for their future method of liv|ing, broths and jellies may be now given &s;pa|ringly, and, as they increa&s;e in &s;trength and age, more plentifully. Hereby the animal jui|ces are received, which contain the only nou|ri&s;hment in fle&s;h, without any labour to the &s;tomach; and let it be remembered, that the juices of full-grown animals are to be prefer|red to the younger and fattened kind; but more of this in its proper place.</P>
<P>Let children at this time be fed once or twice a day with about a quarter of a pint of broth, and a little bread mixed in it. When you give a &s;tiff jelly, a large tea-cup full is &s;ufficient; but I would recommend as much warm water, or milk, with it, and likewi&s;e a little bread. The brea&s;t &s;hould not be allowed them now &s;o often as when they were wholly confined to that nouri&s;hment; in &s;hort, every meal that you thus introduce, &s;hould &s;upply one of the &s;tated times of &s;uckling. Thus are they gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly weaned from
<PB N="81" REF="024796_0075_0FC88FA8097CB218">the brea&s;t, and accu&s;tomed to animal food, without any pining on their parts, or much trouble to the mother.</P>
<P>Having &s;hown the proper manner of putting a child to the brea&s;t, and likewi&s;e the mo&s;t prudent method of taking it away; we &s;hall, in the next letter, point out the &s;afe&s;t rules for bringing children up by hand: but another ob&s;ervation or two will not be improper in this place.</P>
<P>The gravy, which runs out of meat, upon cutting it when brought to table, is exceeding|ly whole&s;ome, being nothing more than the pure juices of fle&s;h. A few &s;poonfuls of this beef or mutton gravy, mixed with an equal quantity of warm water, and a little &s;alt, make very good broth. I mention this, becau&s;e parents generally imagine it to be unwhole|&s;ome for children; and oftentimes, when I have recommended it, &s;ome good old lady has &s;toutly oppo&s;ed me, alleging that it fills a child with humours; whereas, on the contra|ry, this is the only part of fle&s;h that produces good nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Here let me prote&s;t again&s;t the cu&s;tom of not &s;uffering children to eat &s;alt, for fear of the &s;curvy; not making a di&s;tinction between &s;alted meats, and &s;alt eaten with meat. In this point al&s;o, &s;trong prejudices are frequent|ly to be combated with; for many a time have I been told by per&s;ons of reverent years, that children were not &s;uffered to eat &s;alt in former days; adding, perhaps with, a &s;ignifi|cant
<PB N="82" REF="024796_0076_0FC88FABA4410D38">&s;hrug, that the pre&s;ent age think them|&s;elves much wi&s;er than their forefathers.</P>
<P>"Animal food, which has been any con&s;i|derable time in &s;alt, becomes hard, and re|quires more force to break and dige&s;t it, pro|per for nouri&s;hment, than weak &s;tomachs are capable of exerting; con&s;equently, &s;alted beef, pork, and &s;uch like things, are impro|per for children."</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, &s;alt in it&s;elf is &s;o far from producing; the &s;curvy, that it is now general|ly &s;uppo&s;ed to be its greate&s;t antidote; other|wi&s;e, why do &s;o many thou&s;ands yearly flock to bathe, and drink &s;ea-water? There is, fur|ther, a certain &s;timulating quality in &s;alt, that greatly promotes dige&s;tion; and what&s;oever a&s;&s;i&s;ts that office, mu&s;t of cour&s;e rather contri|bute to purify the blood, than to render it foul; which is the &s;uppo&s;ed cau&s;e of the pre|&s;ent frequently imagined, but oftentimes only a, fa&s;hionable di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;called the &s;curvy.</P>
<P>I have been repeatedly thanked for the fol|lowing information. A table &s;poonful or two of &s;alt, put into a quart of &s;pring water, is a mo&s;t excellent wa&s;h to clean&s;e the &s;kin, e&s;pecially if the face be well rubbed with a coar&s;e cloth &s;ome little time after it has been wa&s;hed with the &s;alt and water. By this means the pores of the &s;kin will be kept open, and no ob&s;truct|ed per&s;piration will remain, which is the cau&s;e of carbuncles and tho&s;e red pimples which are generally mi&s;taken for the &s;curvy. It is this &s;timulating and clean&s;ing quality of &s;alt that
<PB N="83" REF="024796_0077_0FC88FB1E2F7CC28">makes the &s;ea-water &s;o u&s;eful to tho&s;e who are troubled with eruptions; therefore, by the above proportion, the water is rendered &s;till more efficacious, and will clear the face and neck of heats and pimples which frequent|ly di&s;turb the ladies.</P>
<P>I cannot bear the modern pro&s;titution of the words female delicacy: the duties of a mother are by &s;ome thought to be indelicate; and the appellation is now given only to di&s;|ea&s;e and &s;ickne&s;s; for a woman mu&s;t become a walking gho&s;t, to be &s;tyled truly delicate. I frequently lament, that the idea is not more &s;trictly confined to mental accompli&s;hments; neverthele&s;s, I wi&s;h my fair friends to be&s;tow every rational and laudable attention to ren|der their per&s;ons neat, elegant, and engaging. I cannot conclude this letter better than by ob&s;erving, that, although beauty &s;tands like a cypher when alone, every additional qualifi|cation increa&s;es its merits ten-fold; and the le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of it the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or her&s;elf appears to be, the more it will always be regarded by the admiring world.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The &s;afe&s;t method of bringing children up by hand.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto, my fair philo&s;ophers, been carefully ob&s;ervant of, and obedi|ent to, the laws of nature. Her paths are in|finitely various. Every &s;tep we take, affords new and engaging pro&s;pects. We have traced man from the fir&s;t period of his exi&s;tence, and have followed rea&s;on and in&s;tinct, to give him &s;trength and vigour in the earlie&s;t part of life. So fair a dawning promi&s;es a robu&s;t and healthy con&s;titution; neverthele&s;s, nece&s;&s;ity obliges us to proceed to a further &s;peculation.</P>
<P>Let it, therefore, be the bu&s;ine&s;s of this let|ter to enquire how nearly art can &s;upply the place of nature. Let us endeavour to point out a method to tho&s;e unfortunate mothers, who are, through nece&s;&s;ity, deprived of the happy enjoyment of &s;uckling their own chil|dren. It may not prove unworthy the atten|tion of tho&s;e, who, by choice, commit them to the care of others. I propo&s;e to carry my ob&s;ervations in this letter, as far as my in|&s;tructions
<PB N="86" REF="024796_0079_0FC88FB5585CB990">have been given to the valuable and truly prai&s;e-worthy matrons, who&s;e duty to their family over-balances every other con&s;i|deration. By and by, when the &s;uckling is about to be weaned, and the dry-nur&s;ed child brought equally forward, the rules of diet will be the &s;ame for both; on which account I went no farther in my la&s;t, than the proper period for introducing broths, jellies, &amp;c. All other con&s;iderations will be brought under general directions.</P>
<P>Mother's milk we have &s;hown to be the na|tural and mo&s;t proper &s;upport for tender in|fants; it is a dige&s;ted fluid, already animali|zed, and therefore fitte&s;t for the nouri&s;hment of children. This remark al&s;o &s;hows that the infant body is, by nature, de&s;igned to receive only a liquid nouri&s;hment; a hint particular|ly nece&s;&s;ary to be attended to at this time, as it altogether obviates the general objections again&s;t confining children to milk, in prefer|ence to thicker victuals, of which I &s;hall &s;peak more fully before I conclude this letter.</P>
<P>We have taken notice how tender the &s;to|mach and bowels of infants are, and have thence inferred, that almo&s;t every complaint they are afflicted with, proceeds from the im|proper quality of their food: and the too large quantity given them, al&s;o increa&s;es the di&s;|ea&s;e. We took notice, that the dige&s;tive pow|ers of a new-born child are incapable of pro|ducing a kind nutriment even from bread, and therefore exclaimed again&s;t feeding them with
<PB N="87" REF="024796_0080_0FC88FBC319753E8">what is called pap. But &s;uppo&s;e it to be other|wi&s;e: what a poor pittance of &s;upport does &s;uch a mother allow to her child, who gives it only bread and water!</P>
<P>I have &s;een many fatal in&s;tances of &s;uch &s;trange management. We our&s;elves &s;hould think it hard, indeed, and nothing but dire ne|ce&s;&s;ity could compel us to live thus &s;paringly; be&s;ides, how would our fle&s;h wa&s;te, and our &s;trength decay! If &s;o, &s;urely it cannot be pro|per for an infant, who&s;e bones have not as yet &s;trength &s;ufficient to &s;upport its frame. How is it po&s;&s;ible for a child to thrive under &s;uch treatment?&mdash;Perhaps &s;ome will allow a little milk to be mixed with its food, but very &s;pa|ringly; becau&s;e they imagine it &s;tuffs the &s;to|mach, and fills a child full of phlegm. Idle and ridiculous are the&s;e, and all other argu|ments that can be urged again&s;t this natural and &s;alubrious diet.</P>
<P>Milk is here &s;poken of in general terms; becau&s;e I intend, in a &s;ub&s;equent letter, to ex|amine the &s;everal properties of different milks, and to remark the purpo&s;e to which each kind &s;eems be&s;t adapted. Cow's milk being mo&s;tly u&s;ed, and in my opinion the propere&s;t, in ge|neral, to an&s;wer our pre&s;ent de&s;ign, I would therefore be under&s;tood to recommend that, if no other kind is particularly mentioned.</P>
<P>I know very well that many per&s;ons, and perhaps &s;ome gentlemen in the practice of phy&s;ic, will differ from me in opinion, when I prefer cow's milk to every other kind of
<PB N="88" REF="024796_0081_0FC88FBF0A368C38">nouri&s;hment, in the early months, where it is nece&s;&s;ary to bring a child up by hand. Let me beg of them only to make the experiment, as I &s;peak from experience; and if they have rea|&s;on to cen&s;ure me afterwards, we &s;hall meet upon equal terms; till then, at lea&s;t, I &s;hall hope for candour from every one.</P>
<P>It has frequently been &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that cow's milk is too rich, abounding al&s;o with too much cream, and that being of a fat oily nature, it will relax more than &s;trength|en. But, however, this fault is not much to be apprehended from the milk u&s;ed in and about London. Suppo&s;ing it to be the ca&s;e in the country, which I am far from allowing, you may let it &s;tand till the cream ri&s;es to the top, and u&s;e the &s;kimmed milk; or by boiling deprive it of the greate&s;t part of this oily qua|lity, which collects it&s;elf upon the &s;urface, and may then be readily taken off; or it may be diluted with water.</P>
<P>The&s;e doubts being removed, the milk of cows appears, I think, to be the propere&s;t &s;ub|&s;titute we can make, for that of the brea&s;t; and will an&s;wer be&s;t, after the fir&s;t month or two, without boiling, unle&s;s it purges the child; in which ca&s;e, boiling it will generally prevent the inconvenience, proceeding in all likelihood from its oily particles. I have no objection to a &s;mall quantity of Li&s;bon &s;ugar being mixed with it, particularly if the child be co&s;tive; and indeed this may frequently be of u&s;e, to prevent its too great tendency to
<PB N="89" REF="024796_0082_0FC88FBFDC1ED270">become acid, from whence di&s;orders of the bowels &s;ometimes ari&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let it be remembered, that, through this &s;y&s;tem of nur&s;ing, children are &s;uppo&s;ed to be free from di&s;ea&s;e, and that I am to be con&s;idered not as the phy&s;ician, but as the friend: when they are ill, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e per&s;ons who have the care of them, to direct a proper food; and upon many occa&s;ions, milk may be &s;o managed as to prove greatly in&s;trumental, even as a well-adapted nouri&s;hment, to their recovery. In too laxative a habit of body, for in&s;tance, rice and cinna|mon may be added; but then care &s;hould be taken, that the rice be well boiled in water, before it is mixed with the milk. In the watery gripes, I frequently di|rect the following diet, for infants: Boil a table &s;poon|ful of ground rice, with a little cinnamon, in half a pint of water, till the water is nearly con&s;umed; then add a pint of milk, and let the whole gently &s;immer for five minutes; &s;train it through a lawn &s;ieve, and make it palatable with a little &s;ugar. This food corre&s;ponds well, in &s;uch complaints, with the curative intention.</NOTE></P>
<P>One remark I &s;hall beg leave to make, which comes in here with propriety. We have ta|ken notice in a former letter of the clean&s;ing quality of mother's milk, upon its fir&s;t com|ing into the brea&s;t. Now, where children are debarred from receiving it, a &s;ub&s;titute of &s;ome gentle purgative is highly proper, to give &s;uch a &s;timulus to the bowels, as nature has provided by the mother's means. What I have experienced to be the be&s;t calculated for an&s;wering this purpo&s;e, is &s;omething of the following kind.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e we &s;ay, <HI>&s;yrup of violets and oil of al|monds, of each one ounce, with four or five grains of rhubarb.</HI> This compo&s;ition being &s;haken
<PB N="90" REF="024796_0083_0FC88FC19D0369F8">will pretty well unite. A tea-&s;poonful may be given as often as you find it nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e the milk be thrown up in a curdled &s;tate, a &s;mall quantity of &s;alt will generally prevent it; a circum&s;tance I would wi&s;h to have attended to; as many children are &s;ub|ject to this complaint; and it is a method I have &s;eldom known to fail, unle&s;s they are greatly over-fed. Whenever a child throws up the milk, it is to be con&s;idered as a com|plaint, and particularly &s;o if it appears cur|dled; becau&s;e it has then pa&s;&s;ed through the fir&s;t change it undergoes in the &s;tomach, and con&s;equently di&s;covers that the &s;tomach it&s;elf is too feeble to execute its further office. In this ca&s;e, &s;ometimes the &s;tomach abounds with too great an acidity, but more frequently it is loaded and oppre&s;&s;ed by the quantity which has been given to the infant. Milk always cur|dles in the &s;tomach; and it is only a vulgar error to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary; for by this means it becomes a &s;ub&s;tantial aliment, and affords a proper nouri&s;hment to children and other animals; whereas, if it continued in a fluid &s;tate, it would contribute but little to their &s;upport.</P>
<P>What we have next to ob&s;erve, is the quan|tity of milk proper to be given to a new-born child, in the twenty-four hours. What think you, my dear ladies, of a Winche&s;ter pint be|ing a &s;ufficient quantity for the day and night! Methinks I hear an exclamation&mdash;O barbarous man! Under a pretence of correcting us, he
<PB N="91" REF="024796_0084_0FC88FC6E1249A98">intends to &s;tarve the little helple&s;s creatures. Was there ever &s;uch a cruelty heard of be|fore? Allow a child only a pint of milk in a day! Why, it would eat two quarts of pap, and &s;till cry for more.&mdash;Yet, after all &s;urpri&s;e, an infant in the month will receive, from one pint of milk, more real and good nouri&s;hment, than from ten quarts of pap, as it is called; indeed I might &s;ay more nouri&s;hment than from any other kind of &s;upport: for, not|with&s;tanding the juices which afford &s;u&s;ten|ance are all liquid, it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould, contain the e&s;&s;ence of &s;ub&s;tantial food: and although a man who is accu&s;tomed to daily labour, would &s;oon be emaciated by living continually upon broths, yet milk alone would &s;upport his &s;trength and &s;pirits, becau&s;e it cur|dles in the &s;tomach, and thereby becomes a more &s;olid and nutritious aliment. And fur|ther, let me again remind you, that not only the human &s;pecies, but likewi&s;e all other ani|mals, receive their continual nouri&s;hment from a milky juice which is prepared in their own bodies from the aliment received, as was before explained in the fourth letter.</P>
<P>There are, as we have mentioned, very great errors in the quantities as well as the qualities of infants' food. It was before ob|&s;erved, that children's &s;tomachs &s;hould not be always crammed. To this it is in a great mea|&s;ure owing that they are &s;o continually puk|ing: a circum&s;tance looked upon by &s;ome to be natural and whole&s;ome, who prepo&s;terou&s;|ly
<PB N="92" REF="024796_0085_0FC88FCB4017D590">encourage this di&s;po&s;ition by frequent vo|mits. But, &s;urely, nature never intended more nouri&s;hment to be received than is nece&s;&s;ary for our &s;upport. Does any per&s;on in a good &s;tate of health, after a moderate and proper meal, ever find an inclination to throw it up again? Are the young offspring of other ani|mals con&s;tantly puking? How therefore can it be &s;uppo&s;ed natural for children to do &s;o? A little reflexion would &s;oon convince &s;uch &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers of their error; for you will rarely find a child throw up its food, when properly nur&s;ed.</P>
<P>If one pint of milk, therefore, in the fir&s;t week or two, be too little, it is an error on the right &s;ide; for it appears to be enough to &s;upport the child; and much wor&s;e con&s;e|quences are to be apprehended from giving it too much. We mu&s;t, every one of us, have often experienced how nece&s;&s;ary it is to be hungry, in order to reli&s;h our food; and that to be continually indulging, palls the appe|tite. Certainly then, it mu&s;t be equally nece&s;|&s;ary, that the infant &s;tomach &s;hould &s;ome|times know the &s;en&s;e of hunger.</P>
<P>Would not three or four pints of milk, in the twenty-four hours, &s;upport a grown per|&s;on? If &s;o, undoubtedly one third part is am|ply &s;ufficient to nouri&s;h a new-born child. But I would not be under&s;tood to cavil &s;crupu|lou&s;ly for a &s;poonful or two; I only mean to a&s;&s;i&s;t the candid enquirer in this mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of the management of children, who are denied the brea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="024796_0086_0FC88FCCA1D90618">We come next to a&s;certain the proper quan|tity to be given for a meal. A quarter of a pint is fully &s;ufficient to be taken at a time; and let the hours of feeding, as well as every other particular, be regulated according to the rules laid down in the &s;eventh letter. In ten days, or a fortnight, you may increa&s;e the daily allowance a quarter of a pint: and at the end of a month you may allow a pint and a half in the twenty-four hours: another half-pint may be gradually permitted by the time it is three months old; and this quantity, if the child is voracious, may be &s;till increa&s;ed to three pints in the day; which, I am per&s;uad|ed, if the milk be good, will prove &s;ufficient: and this allowance will, I hope, cancel the &s;e|verity of every matron's cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>Having now given you my thoughts upon this part of infant management, there is but one rational objection that &s;trikes me, again&s;t the propriety of &s;o plain and &s;imple a method of bringing children up by hand. Their natu|ral food is allowed to be milk&mdash;but it may be urged, that the human milk, in con&s;equence of the mother's diet, is more &s;trengthening than that of cows, a&s;&s;es, or any other &s;pecies of brutes. Granted&mdash;but then again this ar|gument equally proves, that cow's milk par|takes more of a vegetable nature than the milk of women; and, during the early months, all that the advocates for the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom would contend for, is&mdash;what? pap, panado, &amp;c. which are of the vegetable kind; and
<PB N="94" REF="024796_0087_0FC88FCE5707F730">therefore their arguments require no farther an&s;wer. Were it propo&s;ed to add &s;ome pro|per broths to cow's milk, after the fir&s;t four or five weeks, where there is no circum&s;tance particularly to forbid it, the de&s;ign would ap|pear rea&s;onable, in &s;upplying the &s;uppo&s;ed deficiency of the animal property; and it is a point I would readily join in, nay, it is what I mean to recommend towards the end of the third month. I frequently order milk and broth to be mixed together, and think it pro|per food. But let every &s;uch meal, however, as before advi&s;ed, &s;upply the place of the u&s;u|al milk. In whatever way you manage chil|dren, be careful not to feed them over-much.</P>
<P>There is yet a circum&s;tance of great mo|ment to be attended to, and, if rightly com|prehended by my fair pupils, will convince them, that the allowance for the earlier months is amply &s;ufficient: it is the manner in which infants ought to be fed.</P>
<P>Surely it is wrong to put a large boat full of pap into their little mouths, &s;uffering them to &s;wallow the whole of it in the &s;pace of a minute; and then perhaps, from their cries, to ply them with a &s;econd, which is no &s;ooner down than thrown up again.</P>
<P>We have mentioned the ill con&s;equences of grown per&s;ons devouring their victuals too eagerly; and experience mu&s;t often have con|vinced every one, that a much le&s;s quantity than we generally take, if eaten lei&s;urely, and well chewed, will &s;uffice for a meal; and al&s;o
<PB N="95" REF="024796_0088_0FC88FD0160373C8">that, after &s;uch meals, we &s;eem more com|fortable, and are inclined to pur&s;ue either bu|&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure with far greater ea&s;e to our|&s;elves. On the contrary, from a too ha&s;ty and hearty meal the &s;tomach will be di&s;tended over-much, which is always productive of in|dolence, and a tendency to &s;leep. The &s;ame mu&s;t certainly hold good with re&s;pect to in|fants.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, to obtain milk from the brea&s;t, nature wi&s;ely obliges them to earn their nou|ri&s;hment by the labour of drawing it. The &s;tream being exceedingly &s;mall upon the milk's fir&s;t coming into the brea&s;t, it requires a long time to procure a quarter of a pint; and the very exerci&s;e fatigues them, before they have received too much. This, in my opinion, fully proves that quantity to be &s;uf|ficient for a meal.</P>
<P>There is nothing, therefore, wanting, I hope, to complete our &s;y&s;tem, but a contriv|ance to &s;upply the place of a nipple, that the child may &s;till labour to obtain its &s;upport; which alone will greatly prevent the error in quantity. I have &s;een &s;ome inventions of this kind, by means of parchment or leather &s;ew|ed to the pointed end of a horn, which is no bad thought, and capable of great improve|ment. The Hollanders, when they travel, have a &s;mall pewter ve&s;&s;el, &s;omewhat in the form of a cone, which is filled with milk, and a piece of &s;ponge covered with a linen cloth is tied over the &s;maller end. This &s;erves the
<PB N="96" REF="024796_0089_0FC88FD504C59A78">children very well as an artificial nipple: for it is ob&s;erved, that a Dutch woman &s;eldom or never gives &s;uck to her child before &s;trangers.</P>
<P>We have plainly demon&s;trated, that infant nouri&s;hment, particularly in the early months, is de&s;igned by nature to be altogether liquid: again&s;t &s;uch contrivances, therefore, I cannot &s;ee an objection.</P>
<P>Would you, my fair friends, undertake this pur&s;uit, from the happy fertility of female imagination, I am certain a little experience would point out to you a ready and conveni|ent method to an&s;wer every purpo&s;e; and I am thoroughly &s;atisfied, the happy con&s;equen|ces would amply reward your pains&mdash;by pre|&s;erving many dear little innocents, that daily fall a &s;acrifice to repletion or over-feeding.</P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S.&mdash;Since this book made its fir&s;t appear|ance, I have contrived a milk-pot for my own nur&s;ery upon the above principles; it appears to my family, and to many of my patients, preferable to tho&s;e now in u&s;e, and may pro|bably be &s;till further improved. For the &s;atis|faction of my readers, I &s;hall give a de&s;crip|tion of it. This pot is &s;omewhat in form like an urn; it contains a little more than a quar|ter of a pint; its handle, and neck or &s;pout, are not unlike tho&s;e of a coffee-pot, except that the neck of this ari&s;es from the very bot|tom of the pot, and is very &s;mall; in &s;hort, it is upon the &s;ame principle as tho&s;e gravy-pots which &s;eparate the gravy from the oily fat.
<PB N="97" REF="024796_0090_0FC88FD717391568">The end of the &s;pout is a little rai&s;ed, and forms a roundi&s;h knob, &s;omewhat in appear|ance like a &s;mall heart; this is perforated by three or four &s;mall holes: a piece of fine rag is tied loo&s;ely over it, which &s;erves the child to play with in&s;tead of the nipple, and through which, by the infant's &s;ucking, the milk is con&s;tantly &s;trained. The child is equally &s;a|tisfied as it would be with the brea&s;t; it never wets him in the lea&s;t; he is obliged to labour for every drop he receives, in the &s;ame man|ner as when at the brea&s;t; and, greatly in re|commendation of this contrivance, the nur&s;es confe&s;s it is more convenient than a boat, and that it &s;aves a great deal of trouble in the feeding of an infant; which is the greate&s;t &s;e|curity to parents, that their &s;ervants will u&s;e it, when they them&s;elves are not pre&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.
A general management of children, from the time of weaning, till they are about two years old&mdash;with ob|&s;ervations upon the cutting of teeth.</HEAD>
<P>I AM ju&s;t now returned from a nur&s;ery, where, with &s;incere plea&s;ure, I beheld a happy mother with a pretty little puppet at her brea&s;t, which &s;he had the &s;atisfaction of &s;aving in its earlie&s;t days, by her amiable af|fection and tenderne&s;s; an infant born under melancholy circum&s;tances, when the mother her&s;elf was afflicted with a terrible quincy in her throat, and had been confined to a &s;ick chamber five or &s;ix weeks before her delive|ry. No one expected the life of the child, and the mother's was equally doubtful. No|thing but the greate&s;t care on her part could have &s;aved the infant; and, had it been com|mitted to any other per&s;on, the di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of its bowels at the birth would, probably, very &s;oon have put a period to its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Judge, ye con&s;iderate fair, indulge with me the plea&s;ing reflexions of this good woman! Behold her, fondling at the brea&s;t a &s;miling bey, to whom &s;he not only gave a being, but
<PB N="100" REF="024796_0092_0FC88E03E9323BF0">generou&s;ly preferred his welfare, and dared, even contrary to the advice of her friends, to &s;uckle him, thereby endangering her own, to pre&s;erve the life of her child. May gratitude and duty expand within his brea&s;t, and prompt him virtuou&s;ly to reward this truly maternal affection! May he, in future years, become the plea&s;ure and &s;upport of her declining life!</P>
<P>This amiable mother has three other little ones, that for health and beauty &s;tand almo&s;t unrivalled; all nurtured under her own wing&mdash;&s;upported by her brea&s;t. What an en|couragement is this to follow nature! Her heart was never torn by the bitter reflexion of not having done her duty to her family. Ex|ample glorious! worthy of prai&s;e&mdash;worthy of imitation!</P>
<P>But to return to our pre&s;ent point: the &s;uckling being weaned, and the dry-nur&s;ed child brought equally forward; we &s;hall now join our different nur&s;eries together, and en|deavour to make them thrive under one ge|neral direction.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, however, beg leave to mention, that as I before advi&s;ed to have the child kept to the brea&s;t till it is near twelve months old, and have al&s;o pointed out the prudent man|ner of introducing broths and jellies, prepa|rative to weaning it entirely; &s;o this letter is de&s;igned to recommend a proper manage|ment of infants from the period of one to two years of age.</P>
<P>The be&s;t method likewi&s;e having been laid
<PB N="101" REF="024796_0093_0FC88E0AA42F07F0">down for bringing children up by hand, upon tho&s;e principles that approach neare&s;t to na|ture, which &s;urely renders them unexception|able; and having indulged them with broths and jellies earlier than the &s;ucking child; I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e al&s;o gradually brought on to the twelfth month, and thence proceed with both together.</P>
<P>I mo&s;t earne&s;tly recommend that they be &s;trictly confined to the following diet, and not fed oftener than three, or four times at mo&s;t, in the twenty-four hours. The quantity for each meal may now with propriety be con&s;i|derably increa&s;ed; it will be longer, there|fore, of con&s;equence, before the &s;tomach be|comes empty.</P>
<P>Thus, for in&s;tance, let their breakfa&s;t, at &s;ix or &s;even in the morning, be half a pint of new milk with about two ounces of bread in it. The &s;econd meal &s;hould be half a pint of good broth, with the &s;ame quantity of bread; let this be given about ten or eleven in the morning. The third meal, about two or three in the afternoon, &s;hould be broth in like man|ner: and their &s;upper, about &s;ix in the even|ing, new milk and bread, the &s;ame as for breakfa&s;t. When you &s;ub&s;titute jellies, or gravies, for broth, let them be always plain and &s;imple; and a le&s;s quantity will prove &s;uf|ficient.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under the article <HI>&s;alop</HI> in the Family Phy&s;ician, p. 26, you will find proper directions to prepare an excel|lent &s;trengthening food, by mixing &s;alop with milk, which makes it of the con&s;i&s;tence of a cu&s;tard. This preparation of milk is highly proper for children, inva|lids, and aged per&s;ons; and it is withal a very agreea|ble and palatable nouri&s;hment.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="024796_0094_0FC88E0D71938F10">If children are thir&s;ty between their meals, a little barley-water and milk may be given them; but I would not too frequently encou|rage this cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>From hence, the general intention appears throughout, to decrea&s;e the quantity of milk, as you introduce other &s;ub&s;tantial and proper nouri&s;hment&mdash;though I would always allow children a pint of milk each day.</P>
<P>Bi&s;cuits, &s;weet-meats, &s;ugar plums, &amp;c. all which tend to &s;poil the appetite, are highly improper, and ought to be looked upon as one of the pernicious effects of luxury. Where is there a child, unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch indul|gence, that would not be equally plea&s;ed with a cru&s;t of bread? It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s here to enter &s;o philo&s;ophically into the doctrine of nouri&s;hment, as to contend with tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;e it altogether to proceed from the &s;ac|charine qualities of food: but allowing them the utmo&s;t force of their arguments, I an&s;wer, that nature will always prove the be&s;t chy|mi&s;t, to &s;eparate the&s;e &s;ugar-like particles from the aliment we take in. So much for the pre&s;ent, with regard to the regulation of their diet.</P>
<P>As to other particulars: Little or no &s;leep &s;hould now be permitted in the day. Air and exerci&s;e are greatly to be recommended. Let
<PB N="103" REF="024796_0095_0FC88E0E596B2BF0">them ri&s;e as early as you plea&s;e; and the &s;oon|er they are put to bed, when the evening be|gins to &s;hut in, the better. Their clothing &s;hould now, and indeed always, be light and ea&s;y. By no means &s;uffer children to be confi|ned in very warm rooms, but accu&s;tom them by degrees to tho&s;e variations of the &s;ea&s;ons, which they will be compelled to &s;truggle with in future life.</P>
<P>It is a great misfortune for children to be brought up too tenderly. Should Providence hereafter de&s;ign them to contend with difficul|ties, how little capable will they be of con|quering them? The child thus nurtured mo&s;t commonly grows up too delicate and feeble to encounter hard&s;hips. Should nece&s;&s;ity, or chance, hereafter lead him to &s;eek his fortune on the raging &s;eas, or to bear his part in the hardy &s;ervice of his country by land; how pitiful will &s;uch a man appear! How unequal to the nece&s;&s;ary toils of &s;ieges, &s;torms, and tempe&s;ts!&mdash;But, however, this great error, to the credit of good mothers be it confe&s;&s;ed, is of late years much corrected.</P>
<P>I beg leave, my fair friends, to &s;ay &s;omething concerning their being put upon their feet. With re&s;pect to the time, the &s;trength of the child mu&s;t determine that period. Of this be a&s;&s;ured, that all children will &s;how an inclination to walk, as &s;oon as their bones have acquired a firmne&s;s &s;ufficient to &s;upport the body. I am fearful many heavy children are injured by exciting their feeble efforts to
<PB N="104" REF="024796_0096_0FC88E0FDA938EF0">walk too &s;oon. Doubtle&s;s it is a convenience and ea&s;e to nur&s;es to &s;et them upon their feet, as they do not then require exerci&s;e in the arms; and con&s;equently are not &s;o great a trouble and fatigue to tho&s;e who have the care of them. But it is a fault entirely to be condemned, and what I particularly caution you again&s;t; becau&s;e, whoever you may have to attend upon your children, they will cer|tainly encourage them to walk, for rea&s;ons above mentioned.</P>
<P>Therefore throw a&s;ide your leading-&s;trings, and your back-&s;trings, and every other crafty invention which tends to put children for|warder than nature de&s;igned. Our young plants are to be cultivated without art. The indu&s;trious gardener, it is true, can boa&s;t of his exotics, and early fruits, by forcing their growth. Yet &s;ay, ye &s;ons of Epicurus, are your grapes or pines thus rai&s;ed, equal to the produce of their natural climate? And not|with&s;tanding the merit of your gardener, who is thus capable of gratifying this high ze&s;t of luxurious extravagance; even in this your boa&s;ted pride, a &s;imple clown would be wi&s;e enough to expo&s;e your folly, by the hone&s;t preference which he would give to nature. Such as the fruits are, watery and in&s;ipid; &s;uch al&s;o are the plants thus forced, weakly and tender; &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;lighte&s;t inju|ries, and expo&s;ed to continual dangers: &s;uch likewi&s;e are the poor feeble infants, forced upon their legs before nature has de&s;igned
<PB N="105" REF="024796_0097_0FC88E1780E00790">them; while others, managed without art, like fruitful vines, defy the inclement &s;ea&s;ons, and triumph in their natural &s;trength and vi|gour.</P>
<P>I do not mean, from what has been &s;aid up|on this &s;ubject, to prevent them, when they really &s;how an inclination to walk, but to ad|moni&s;h you again&s;t being too precipitate. It is, in my opinion, a good method to &s;uffer the little creatures fir&s;t to crawl upon a carpet, or any other convenient place; permitting them to tumble about as much as they plea&s;e. By this means an exerci&s;e will be given to the body and limbs, without their continuing in one po&s;ition long enough to hazard a di&s;tortion, from too great a weight of body. Thus let them, by degrees, learn to walk upright, which their own inclinations, in imitation of tho&s;e about them, will prompt them to, full as &s;oon as nature de&s;igned.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now beg leave to offer a few hints with re&s;pect to the teeth: a circum&s;tance this, materially to be attended to, as woful experi|ence daily convinces us.</P>
<P>Children are teazed with cutting of teeth from four or five months, till they are two years old, and upwards; nay, &s;ome are &s;o backward as not to have their complete num|ber till they are turned of three years old. I &s;hall not enter into the di&s;tinction of teeth, but &s;peak of them in general, &s;o as to give a com|petent idea of the precautions I mean to re|commend.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="024796_0098_0FC88E18E8F85B88">It is al&s;o very uncertain with re&s;pect to the exact time of their &s;hooting any of their teeth; but this al&s;o, I believe, chiefly depends upon the &s;trength of the con&s;titution; and if the rules laid down in the preceding letters be properly ob&s;erved, you will generally find children cut all their teeth by the time they are about two years old. You will, likewi&s;e, rarely meet with an in&s;tance of their being cut with difficulty. It has been already taken no|tice of, that the rea&s;on of their being back|ward in their teeth, and &s;o many children lo&s;t on this account, is entirely owing to a weak|ne&s;s of body, which is a fact that &s;carcely any one will deny.</P>
<P>Yet, where the con&s;titution is not &s;trong e|nough of it&s;elf, as a great a&s;&s;i&s;tance may be ob|tained by lancing of the gums, let not a fal&s;e tenderne&s;s prevent fond mothers from allow|ing &s;uch relief to their little babes, in the ex|cruciating tortures they &s;uffer by the cutting of teeth. The operation is not to be deemed pain; for if you put any thing with a &s;harp edge into their mouths, they will &s;ave you the trouble of doing it, by pre&s;&s;ing hard again&s;t the in|&s;trument, and cutting the gum them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When the teeth are di&s;cernible to the &s;ight or touch, there is very little &s;en&s;e of feeling in the gum; their tortures proceed from the &s;en&s;ibility of a fine membrane which envelopes the tooth. If that membrane is &s;ufficiently divided, although the gum &s;hould again unite, there will be no more trouble; for teeth thus
<PB N="107" REF="024796_0099_0FC88E1A5BBF39C8">lanced will gradually advance without future pain. Never, therefore, I &s;ay, let a prejudice like this hinder you from relieving &s;uch poor little helple&s;s creatures.</P>
<P>There are many per&s;ons, who, about the age of twenty, have two, and &s;ometimes four, additional teeth, at the furthermo&s;t part of the jaws; and, from the time of life in which they appear, they are called the teeth of wi&s;|dom. Let me de&s;ire &s;uch wi&s;e ones, &s;en&s;ible of the pain upon this occa&s;ion, to reflect how in&s;upportable it mu&s;t be to many infants, who perhaps are cutting the whole of their teeth al|mo&s;t at once; at a time too, when their tender frames are but little capable of bearing pain. Many grown per&s;ons are obliged to have &s;uch teeth lanced; let them declare how much re|lief they found from this &s;imple, but u&s;eful operation.</P>
<P>Candid rea&s;oning, from experience, is the &s;ure&s;t way to conquer prejudices; and tho&s;e who give them&s;elves leave to think upon the point with candour, will, I doubt not, allow the force of this argument.</P>
<P>It may not be un&s;ea&s;onable, in this place, to give a caution, which tho&s;e who lance teeth would do well to ob&s;erve; as carele&s;&s;ne&s;s or ignorance in the operation frequently fru&s;|trates the intended benefit. Let me advi&s;e you not to depend upon old women, or nur&s;es, who undertake to do it with crooked &s;ixpen|ces, and &s;uch like ineffectual means.</P>
<P>We took notice a little above, that the pain
<PB N="108" REF="024796_0100_0FC88E1CA8B31CF8">ari&s;es, not from the gum, but from the &s;en&s;i|bility of a fine membrane which envelopes the teeth. It is not, therefore, &s;ufficient to make a longitudinal inci&s;ion into the gum, that be|ing too commonly done without dividing this membrane; in which ca&s;e, in&s;tead of good, it does hurt. After cutting through the gum, the in&s;trument &s;hould be drawn round the tooth; and the per&s;on &s;hould be &s;atisfied, that it grates in every part again&s;t the tooth, which will effectually divide this too &s;en&s;ible mem|brane. Where the gum is exceedingly tough, a tran&s;ver&s;e inci&s;ion ought likewi&s;e to be made, and with the&s;e precautions the operati|on will a&s;&s;uredly &s;ucceed. Parents cannot be too careful in this particular; for I have often ob&s;erved ill con&s;equences from the carele&s;&s;|ne&s;s before mentioned.</P>
<P>In my ob&s;ervations upon children that are lo&s;t between the age of five months and three years, I have found they are generally carri|ed off either by &s;udden convul&s;ions, or what is called a tooth-fever, or a wa&s;ting of the bo|dy: in the two la&s;t ca&s;es, the &s;cene likewi&s;e is commonly clo&s;ed with convul&s;ive fits.</P>
<P>The original cau&s;e of the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters having been frequently taken notice of to proceed from the wrong management of children, it appears equally evident to me, that the imme|diate cau&s;e of the&s;e fits almo&s;t always ari&s;es from want of &s;trength in the con&s;titution to cut the teeth. It is true, the bowels &s;ome|times are greatly affected, which indeed ge|nerally
<PB N="109" REF="024796_0101_0FC88E1EDE9204F0">attends a wa&s;ting of the body; but then the immediate cau&s;e of &s;uch complaints at this time is mo&s;t commonly the teeth: for if children are capable of enduring the impro|per aliments before mentioned in their mo&s;t tender &s;tate, during the fir&s;t four or five months; &s;urely, without &s;ome more active principle, the vital powers would not after|wards be by them alone &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>This makes me particularly &s;olicitous to recommend lancing of the gums before it is too late to a&s;&s;i&s;t children; being firmly per|&s;uaded that many might be &s;aved, who daily fall a &s;acrifice to tho&s;e complaints for want of it.</P>
<P>Among many other in&s;tances that I could relate, to &s;how the nece&s;&s;ity of admitting this operation before the &s;trength of the child be decayed, and its body wa&s;ted, I &s;hall conclude this letter with a remarkable ca&s;e of this &s;ort.</P>
<P>A poor woman in the neighbourhood, &s;ome time &s;ince, brought her child to me: he was apparently a &s;tout fine boy, and then about nine months old. She de&s;ired my advice for an eruption the child had all over his body, which &s;he called &s;curvy; but I found it no|thing more than &s;ome pimples proceeding from the improper quality of its food; and in fact, notwith&s;tanding the chubby appearance of the boy (which in reality was nothing more than bloated fat), he was actually of a very weakly frame, as appears by the &s;equel&mdash;and
<PB N="110" REF="024796_0102_0FC88E24B820D1F8">I think it nece&s;&s;ary, as a farther confirmation of my a&s;&s;ertion, to inform you, that his father was at this time between &s;ixty and &s;eventy, his mother not le&s;s than four or five and thir|ty years of age.</P>
<P>Near or quite &s;ix months afterwards, the &s;ame woman came to beg the favour of me to look at her child again, who, &s;he &s;aid, was dying. I &s;aw an infant worn away to a mere &s;keleton; and, upon enquiry, found it to be the &s;ame chubby fat boy I had &s;een before. He lay panting for breath, and had taken little or no nouri&s;hment for twenty-four hours. Upon examining the little patient, there was not a tooth appeared. The cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, therefore, was immediately evident to me; but I told her it was too late to be of &s;ervice, for I found the child could not recover.</P>
<P>However, to &s;atisfy the mother, I advi&s;ed lancing the gums. To the a&s;toni&s;hment of every one about the child, &s;ixteen large teeth were cut out; but the gums being very much hardened, for want of this operation, it was with no &s;mall difficulty now performed. The immediate relief which the child received, &s;urpri&s;ed them all &s;till more. From a convul|&s;ive &s;tate that he before lay in, he in&s;tantly recovered, took notice of every body in the room, and, during the time I &s;taid, eagerly devoured a con&s;iderable quantity of nouri&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>The grateful parent thanked me a thou&s;and times, and reflected upon her&s;elf for delaying
<PB N="111" REF="024796_0103_0FC88E259AA61CF0">to apply to me before. But, alas! I fore&s;aw it was only a temporary relief, his &s;trength being utterly exhau&s;ted. I left her, without giving the lea&s;t hopes of his recovery; and the next morning the child died. A reflexion upon this ca&s;e, I take for granted, is entirely needle&s;s. It is evident, had the teeth been cut in due time, this fatal accident would not have happened.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, a topic of &s;erious concern; but as it comes under the cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es to which infants are &s;ubject, it cannot be enlarg|ed upon in this little volume. Some opinions, and medical ob&s;ervations, are thrown out in the introduction to the&s;e letters, which, if carefully attended to, may a&s;&s;i&s;t the intelli|gent parent in her endeavours to pre&s;erve the lives of &s;uch little innocents. A table of births and infant burials is al&s;o in&s;erted, which proves the melancholy truths I am aiming to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.
A general management of children, from two years old, till they leave the nur&s;ery.</HEAD>
<P>THE cultivation of the mind I have inten|tionally re&s;erved for the &s;ubject of my next letter; for which rea&s;on I &s;hall now fi|ni&s;h my ob&s;ervations upon nur&s;ing, and en|deavour to point out the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t pru|dent method of introducing children into the family way of living.</P>
<P>At length, after &s;urmounting the difficulties and inconveniencies attending the cutting of their teeth, we have now &s;et them upon their legs; to the no &s;mall joy of the mother, and the relief of tho&s;e &s;ervants who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to wait upon them.</P>
<P>We have hitherto permitted breed, milk, and the juices only of fle&s;h; and before we ad|vance any farther, I beg leave to make the following remarks, by which my intelligent readers may profit.</P>
<P>The food of man, in all its various &s;hapes, however tortured and di&s;gui&s;ed, is &s;till confi|ned to animal and vegetable productions.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="024796_0105_0FC88E2F1BD6EC30">Of vegetables, bread is the mo&s;t valuable preparation, as the experience of ages proves. That made from wheat flour is &s;till the mo&s;t &s;trengthening, and ever to be preferred by tho&s;e who have the means of obtaining it.</P>
<P>The milk of cows, although it may be &s;up|po&s;ed not to partake &s;o much of a &s;trengthen|ing nature as the human milk, tho&s;e creatures feeding altogether upon vegetables, is, never|thele&s;s, to be con&s;idered as a food partly ani|mal, and partly vegetable, prepared al&s;o un|der an all-wi&s;e direction.</P>
<P>Gravies, jellies, and broths, we know, are animal juices; either &s;pontaneou&s;ly flowing from fle&s;h, upon cutting it, after it is dre&s;&s;|ed; or obtained by a maceration of it in wa|ter.</P>
<P>From the&s;e reflexions, therefore, it ap|pears, that in the regimen already permitted, the mo&s;t valuable &s;upplies of life are granted, and in a manner the be&s;t adapted to infant con&s;titutions; requiring but little exertion of the dige&s;tive faculties, and gradually introdu|cing that nutriment, which, as the body be|comes &s;tronger, it mu&s;t prepare for it&s;elf from the gro&s;&s;er aliments.</P>
<P>The intention of what has been &s;aid is to encourage, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the continua|tion of this diet a little longer; and, indeed, &s;ome of the fine&s;t children I ever &s;aw, have been chiefly confined to a food like this, for the fir&s;t five or &s;ix years. But although I &s;trongly recommend it, and am con&s;cious that chil|dren,
<PB N="115" REF="024796_0106_0FC88E305A92D370">unacquainted with the indulgence of variety, would be perfectly &s;atisfied without animal food; yet I am per&s;uaded that the culpable fondne&s;s of mo&s;t parents will initiate them, too early, into the luxuries of a plen|tiful table.</P>
<P>It is true, we made an ob&s;ervation, that na|ture never intended fle&s;h for our food, until we had teeth to eat it; but it by no means follows, as &s;oon as we have our teeth, that with an unbounded freedom we are to de|vour animal food. Remember, likewi&s;e, ye too indulgent parents, it has been before ob|&s;erved, that every alteration in our manner of living &s;hould be brought about &s;tep by &s;tep, ha&s;ty tran&s;itions being always dangerous: and let this teach us to be cautious in our manner of admitting fle&s;h into the meals of children.</P>
<P>After what has been advanced, and after having given you my opinion that it is yet time enough to &s;uffer children to eat fle&s;h, I now leave this very important point to the di&s;cretion of parents: however, permit me to recommend, that when fle&s;h is fir&s;t intro|duced into their food, at whatever time it may be, this part of their diet &s;hould be al|lowed them but &s;paringly; and a regard al&s;o &s;hould be paid to its quality.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of barn-door fowls, beef, mutton, and full-grown animals in general, is the be&s;t. Crammed poultry, calves, and hou&s;e-fed lambs, kept up to fatten, are improper, be|cau&s;e their juices yield by far le&s;s nouri&s;h|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="024796_0107_0FC88E319CEEB918">Hence, beef tea, and mutton broth, are preferable to tho&s;e made from lamb or veal. The fle&s;h al&s;o of &s;uch young fattened animals does not pa&s;s off weak &s;tomachs &s;o ea&s;ily as the other.</P>
<P>High-&s;ea&s;oned gravies, and &s;oups, made di&s;hes, and &s;alted meats, are ever to be avoid|ed; though &s;alt with their meats may be al|lowed, for the rea&s;ons before given.</P>
<P>Although it is not meant to confine them at this age &s;o &s;trictly to bread, I am by no means for permitting too free a u&s;e of vegetables; being convinced, that &s;ome complaints of the bowels, in children more advanced in life, proceed from this error, and particularly worms: &s;ince, if the eggs of the&s;e in&s;ects are not taken in, together with the&s;e productions of the garden, on which they harbour and feed, yet this food at lea&s;t affords a con&s;ider|able quantity of &s;lime, which, &s;tagnating in the bowels, &s;erves as an habitation for the&s;e pernicious little animals. This is my rea&s;on for allowing a little wine, now and then, to be given to children, and I am per&s;uaded that I have &s;een its good effect. Care &s;hould be taken in the choice of vegetables; tho&s;e of the mealy kind, that approach the neare&s;t to bread, are to be preferred, &s;uch as potatoes, rice, &amp;c. Turnips are al&s;o good. Lettuces, and &s;ome few others, may, in moderation, be given to them, which your own prudence mu&s;t point out.</P>
<P>The kitchen preparations of milk, &s;uch as
<PB N="117" REF="024796_0108_0FC88E3318EAEFD0">cu&s;tards, blamange, white-pots, &amp;c. are ex|ceedingly proper; and in this kind of food a greater variation may be indulged with le&s;s harm, being, for the mo&s;t part, equally good and innocent. Salop mixed with milk, as mentioned in the la&s;t letter, may be granted as often as you plea&s;e; and let it be remem|bered, that it is the be&s;t way of giving that nutritious vegetable to children and inva|lids.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Family Phy&s;ician, p. 26.</NOTE> Eggs are good; and if the yelks be beaten up with warm milk, without boiling, they afford the be&s;t nouri&s;hment; yet, howe|ver they are dre&s;&s;ed, never &s;uffer children to eat them, if the yelks be hard. Puddings in general are likewi&s;e good; but the mo&s;t &s;im|ple are be&s;t. Tarts and fruit-pies may be al|lowed in moderation.</P>
<P>Shell-fi&s;h, and indeed mo&s;t other kinds, may, now and then, be given; but the firme&s;t are to be preferred. The&s;e are the mo&s;t prudent directions that occur to my memory; but, after all, tho&s;e are wi&s;e&s;t who do not pamper young children with too great a variety.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble you with the curative part of di&s;ea&s;es incident to children, that be|ing altogether the concern of the phy&s;ician; though it would give me a real plea&s;ure to &s;ee &s;uch complaints treated of, in a ma&s;terly man|ner, by &s;ome accurate ob&s;erver of nature.

<P>As to rhubarb, Ga&s;coign's powder, magne|&s;ia, &amp;c. every mother's ob&s;ervations in &s;ome mea&s;ure direct a proper u&s;e of them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e parents who are at a lo&s;s upon the&s;e points may con&s;ult the Family Phy&s;ician.&mdash;For Rhubarb, &s;ee p. 26,&mdash;Ga&s;coign's Powder, p. 15&mdash;Magne&s;ia, p. 19.</NOTE>; but when di&s;orders do not give way to &s;uch &s;im|ple methods, there is no time to be lo&s;t.

The nece&s;&s;ity of cultivating the di&s;po&s;itions of children, to render them amiable and virtuous.</HEAD>
<P>CONFESS, ye worthy parents who know the height of earthly bli&s;s, what temp|tations in life could prevail upon you, after two or three years of age, to part from the dear dear offsprings of your mutual loves? Ye tender mothers, &s;peak!

How exqui&s;ite is the delight to view their expanding minds&mdash;now catching &s;ound, that quickly ri&s;es into &s;en&s;e, beaming a hap|py pro&s;pect of future under&s;tanding!

<P>O powerful Nature, how un&s;peakably &s;trong are thy ties! What heart, unle&s;s &s;trangely perverted, can re&s;i&s;t thy impul&s;e?

<P>It therefore behoves every mother to be watchful of her own conduct, and perfectly &s;atisfied of the di&s;po&s;itions of &s;uch &s;ervants as &s;he entru&s;ts with the care of her children, at this &s;u&s;ceptible time of life; when even the more affectionately the&s;e per&s;ons treat them, the wor&s;e con&s;equences are to be ap|prehended, if their own tempers are not good: for as children are gratefully fond of tho&s;e who u&s;e them kindly, they are by far the more likely to imbibe the bad qualities of an indulgent attendant; and, on the contrary, to profit by good examples.</P>
<P>Objects that attract the eyes are the fir&s;t de|lighting: the plea&s;ures from hearing are the next. From &s;ight and &s;ound ideas take their gradual ri&s;e. Hence, a partial fondne&s;s is formed by children towards tho&s;e who&s;e pro|vince it is to attend upon them: and for this rea&s;on they are more fond of their nur&s;es, who are con&s;tantly prattling to them, than of parents neglectful of their infancy.</P>
<P>The want of duty and affection in children towards their parents, &s;o much to be cen&s;ur|ed, and &s;o generally complained of, often pro|ceeds from this early mi&s;management. The
<PB N="123" REF="024796_0114_0FC88E482EEC9E78">indifference al&s;o of too many parents towards their children, frequently owes its origin to depriving them&s;elves of the enjoyments of their little ones at this engaging &s;ea&s;on of life. Even to an unintere&s;ted per&s;on, the expand|ing of an infant mind is a delightful entertain|ment; but to good parents, the plea&s;ure and attachment mu&s;t certainly prove exceedingly more agreeable and la&s;ting. We mu&s;t indeed pity tho&s;e whom nece&s;&s;ity deprives of this happy &s;olace, but utterly condemn &s;uch who&s;e inclinations drive their little nur&s;lings from them. Unnatural and mi&s;taken per&s;ons, who, if they are puni&s;hed with undutiful children, &s;uffer only in con&s;equence of their own ne|glect!</P>
<P>Would you, my tender and con&s;iderate ma|trons, wi&s;h to &s;ee your children truly amia|ble? Be then ever careful of your&s;elves. En|deavour al&s;o as much as po&s;&s;ible to prevent violent exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion in your hu&s;bands. This is a laudable ta&s;k, and much more in the power of women than they generally ima|gine. Tru&s;t: me, my fair-ones, truly prudent and good wives, by bending a little to the rug|ged, head&s;trong, and boi&s;terous di&s;po&s;itions of &s;ome hu&s;bands, may for the mo&s;t part ci|vilize them; and by their endearing and &s;oothing manners, in &s;pite of early vicious ha|bits, compel them to a behaviour of tender|ne&s;s and love. Thus, by the example of an engaging deportment on your part, you will &s;often their tempers, &s;o as to render them
<PB N="124" REF="024796_0115_0FC88E499CAC35C0">good hu&s;bands, good fathers, good ma&s;ters, and valuable members of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>While, on the other hand, vindictive and peevi&s;h women not only forfeit this female importance, but too frequently e&s;trange their hu&s;bands' affections from them: and need I &s;ay that this want of harmony and &s;incere friend&s;hip, between man and wife, is a dan|gerous pattern for their children?</P>
<P>From the &s;trong force of example, it be|comes in a manner natural to the children of &s;uch per&s;ons to give an unbridled loo&s;e to eve|ry impul&s;e; nay, their emulation is &s;oon enga|ged to become equally tyrannical with their parents. On the contrary, where no &s;uch pre|cedents are before their eyes&mdash;where impa&s;|&s;ioned and youthful love keeps pace with &s;en|timental friend&s;hip&mdash;where the polite and well-bred man &s;hows a virtuous inclination towards his wife; and they both join in a proper regard for their children&mdash;how much rea&s;on have we to expect that their young and tender minds will be impre&s;&s;ed with virtue! Nay, I dare aver, that, from this rectitude of behaviour, &s;uch parents will generally be re|warded with good and dutiful children.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the management of chil|dren, how &s;hall we draw the line between in|dulgence and &s;everity? Although they are di|ametrically oppo&s;ite to each other, it is &s;carce|ly po&s;&s;ible to be done; nay, it cannot be de|termined, &s;o as to admit of ab&s;olute deci&s;ion. Children nece&s;&s;arily require a different treat|ment,
<PB N="125" REF="024796_0116_0FC88E4B64AA5658">even from their natural di&s;po&s;ition, as it is u&s;ually called; and a conduct indulgent to &s;ome, will prove the greate&s;t &s;everity to others. Let it therefore be remembered, that our plan is to &s;ubdue the fir&s;t irregular emo|tions in the bud, &s;o as to prevent them from ri&s;ing into pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I would, then, at all events, earne&s;tly re|commend temper and forbearance to tho&s;e who have the government of their infant years. Kind treatment, good words, and a generous encouragement, to mo&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, will prove equal to every thing that you require of them; and if they can be conquer|ed by &s;uch laudable and gentle means, you not only carry the fir&s;t points in the mo&s;t eli|gible manner, but accu&s;tom them al&s;o to an obliging behaviour, and excite their emula|tion to endeavour to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Carefully therefore ob&s;erve every emotion that is prai&s;e-worthy, and let a reward accom|pany it; for the encouragement of one virtu|ous impul&s;e will have a much happier effect than the correction of a hundred faults.</P>
<P>Such are the impre&s;&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary to form a virtuous mind, and they will certainly grow up into their habits. On the contrary, where children's di&s;po&s;itions are untoward; if they be &s;ubdued by har&s;h words, threats, and cha&s;|ti&s;ement, how are their tempers ruffled by &s;uch treatment!&mdash;and what is to be expected, but that they con&s;ider &s;everity and violence as the only means for them to obtain any
<PB N="126" REF="024796_0117_0FC88E537399AFB0">point over others, whom they may have a future occa&s;ion to contend with? What a wretched foundation of perpetual di&s;quietude!</P>
<P>Where reproof is nece&s;&s;ary, mortification is undoubtedly the be&s;t means of correction; and let an acknowledgment of the fault prove the means of reconciliation.</P>
<LG>
<L>"And, next to <HI>right,</HI> pray conde&s;cend</L>
<L>"T' acknowledge doing <HI>wrong,</HI> my friend."</L>
</LG>
<P>This humbles them in their own opinions; it nece&s;&s;arily begets &s;hame; and before a di&s;po|&s;ition is hardened into vice, &s;hame will always produce amendment,</P>
<P>Moreover, in this ca&s;e there is no object for re&s;entment, that great &s;upport of pride; con&s;equently it initiates them to con&s;ider tho|roughly their own conduct, and of cour&s;e to dwell upon the cau&s;e for which they are thus humbled. What, therefore, can more tho|roughly conduce to render children amiable as they grow up, than the accu&s;toming of them to a retro&s;pection of their own behaviour, and to an inward condemnation of their faults, of which their making a conce&s;&s;ion is &s;ufficient proof?</P>
<P>Even in the mo&s;t trifling promi&s;e a parent can make to children, I mo&s;t earne&s;tly recom|mend that it be religiou&s;ly adhered to; other|wi&s;e you teach them a &s;hocking le&s;&s;on of de|ceit.</P>
<P>For equivocation and fal&s;ity, their mortifi|cations ought to be exceedingly &s;evere; but
<PB N="127" REF="024796_0118_0FC88E54DEEA5E20">in every point where you find it nece&s;&s;ary to correct be &s;ure you make them truly &s;en|&s;ible of their error: at the &s;ame time, in every mi&s;demeanor, be thoroughly &s;atisfied that it proceeds from a culpable emotion, be|fore you reprove it; for it &s;ometimes falls out, that wrong actions may proceed from laudable intentions.</P>
<P>How often in life does it happen, that ex|ceptions are taken again&s;t a friend, who is at that very time actually meditating the angry per&s;on's advantage; and yet, perhaps, appear|ances &s;o blind him that he thinks of nothing but revenge, until an eclairci&s;&s;ement takes place, when he as pa&s;&s;ionately reproaches him&s;elf for his ingratitude! The ca&s;e is &s;till harder with children; for, when they are pu|ni&s;hed wrongfully, it is &s;eldom that they have it in their power to clear them&s;elves; and further, they may probably &s;uppo&s;e their own good emotions to be the guilty cau&s;e, and thereby endeavour to &s;uppre&s;s a ri&s;ing virtue.</P>
<P>Indulgence over much is liable to produce effects equally bad, as extreme &s;everity; for as the latter inures them to every act of vio|lence, &s;o the former encourages the breach of every civil duty that thwarts their &s;elfi&s;h in|clinations.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t mi&s;conduct of all ari&s;es from the&s;e two oppo&s;ite ways of management being united together, in the wide&s;t extreme; when one moment the little creature's bones are almo&s;t broken for a fault of which it is
<PB N="128" REF="024796_0119_0FC88E5668C3D250">&s;carcely &s;en&s;ible, and the next moment it is fondly cheri&s;hed to reconcile it to the mi&s;ta|ken parent; and in return, not improbably, indulged in exerci&s;ing its rage upon toys, in torturing birds, dogs, cats, and &s;uch-like do|me&s;tic animals, as infant tyranny can lord it over; and permitted al&s;o at the window to &s;port with the lives of little buzzing in&s;ects, that fall a &s;acifice to wanton cruelty.</P>
<P>The child who is fondly and fooli&s;hly in|dulged, promi&s;es only a melancholy pro&s;pect; but where, on the other hand, as is too gene|rally &s;een, an occa&s;ional &s;everity inures it to cruelty, the di&s;po&s;ition is inevitably ruined. The con&s;equences of &s;uch &s;everity and &s;uch indulgence fill the mind with every di&s;agree|able apprehen&s;ion: and indeed, what can they produce but inordinate de&s;ires, bruti&s;h rage, and violence?</P>
<P>Tho&s;e parents who are happy enough to &s;ubdue their own choler, and thereby &s;et their children proper examples, will have very lit|tle cau&s;e for complaint again&s;t them: on the contrary, &s;uch as are perpetually quarrelling with each other, with their children, &s;ervants, and every body around them, cannot expect much peace and comfort from their ri&s;ing fa|milies. But if they will take this friendly ad|vice, to correct their own errors only once, for every hundredth time they cha&s;ti&s;e others, it will probably bring about &s;ome amendment in them&s;elves; and the force of their example mu&s;t &s;urely produce the be&s;t effect upon their hou&s;ehold.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="024796_0120_0FC88E580C5CD350">We have now conducted children through the different &s;tages of helple&s;s infancy, and gradually introduced them, though as yet but junior characters, upon the grand theatre of life; where the happy effects of &s;uch careful regulations are generally to be di&s;tingui&s;hed. As to literary improvements, they properly come under another juri&s;diction, and there|fore claim your future con&s;ideration.

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.
Of milk&mdash;Its properties examined&mdash;the different kinds of milk compared with each other&mdash;and their parti|cular virtues explained.</HEAD>
<P>MILK has been recommended, in &s;everal letters, as the proper food for infants; and in the fourteenth and fifteenth, it is again &s;poken of, as being equally nece&s;&s;ary for inva|lids and aged per&s;ons. It &s;hall, therefore, be the bu&s;ine&s;s of this letter to examine &s;o far into the qualities of milk, and into the milk of different animals, as may enable us to de|termine what kind of milk is, upon different occa&s;ions, to be preferred; which will take in every thing, not el&s;ewhere ob&s;erved upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Milk was before remarked to be a kind of white blood, prepared by the mother for the &s;upport of her young; &s;o far we may &s;peak of it in general terms.</P>
<P>In different animals, therefore, it is rea&s;on|able to &s;uppo&s;e, and fact confirms our &s;uppo|&s;ition, that the qualities of milk are al&s;o dif|ferent: hence, by fir&s;t examining into its ge|neral properties, and, from tho&s;e principles,
<PB N="132" REF="024796_0123_0FC88E649A53D288">&s;etting forth the peculiar variations in the milk of different animals, we &s;hall arrive at the de&s;ired conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>In milk, by &s;tepping into the dairy, we may di&s;cern three principal component parts. Af|ter it has remained &s;ome time in an undi&s;turb|ed &s;tate, the cream floats upon the &s;urface. It is the lea&s;t in quantity, though mo&s;t nouri&s;h|ing, of an oily bal&s;amic &s;ub&s;tance, and inflam|mable in its nature, as the butter, which is made from it, plainly demon&s;trates.</P>
<P>A lady, before whom I once made &s;ome ex|periments, a&s;ked me why the cream floated upon the &s;urface; for being, continued &s;he, the thicke&s;t part, ought it not rather to &s;ink to the bottom? I told her, it was the thicke&s;t part, to be &s;ure, but at the &s;ame time it was al&s;o the lighte&s;t; &s;pecifically &s;o, as oil is light|er than water, and therefore ri&s;es to the top.</P>
<P>The cream being taken off, the remaining milk appears blui&s;h, and thinner than before; and when thus robbed of its thick, creamy part, it con&s;equently is not &s;o &s;mooth to the palate.</P>
<P>On the addition of runnet, or indeed any acid, a &s;eparation of the two remaining parts &s;oon takes place, and we di&s;cover the curd. This, being the heavie&s;t, when &s;eparated from the whey, falls to the bottom. It is the lea&s;t valuable part of the milk, glutinous in its na|ture, and compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t earthy parti|cles, being al&s;o of an a&s;tringent quality.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="024796_0124_0FC88E6B7017C098">The third and only remaining part, being the whey of the milk, is the large&s;t in quanti|ty, of a diluting and clean&s;ing property.</P>
<P>Let us now by this &s;tandard compare the different kinds of milk, mo&s;tly in u&s;e with us, and apply them to the purpo&s;es for which they &s;eem be&s;t calculated.</P>
<P>The human milk, when drawn from the brea&s;t, has exactly the &s;ame blui&s;h appearance as cow's milk when the cream is taken off. It affords very little cream, and but a &s;mall quan|tity of curd; therefore the whey con&s;titutes the chief part: but the more healthy the wo|man is, and particularly if between the age of twenty and thirty, the more her milk abounds with rich creamy bal&s;am, and the more it al&s;o contains of the curd or earthy particles; pro|bably from her con&s;titution being, at this time, in full vigour, and the dige&s;tive powers therefore more perfect.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations will point out the be&s;t &s;ub&s;titute, where the brea&s;t is denied, and will likewi&s;e direct tho&s;e, who prefer wet-nur&s;ing, in the choice of the propere&s;t per&s;on; for there is, in my opinion, an equal objection again&s;t the milk of a very young girl, as again&s;t that of a woman almo&s;t pa&s;t child|bearing. The clean&s;ing quality, before taken notice of, in a brea&s;t of new milk, will al&s;o, together with rea&s;on and experience, &s;how the propriety of recommending tho&s;e women who have not been long delivered.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="024796_0125_0FC88E6CDF741408">A&s;s's milk is generally allowed to be the neare&s;t to the human, and, according to the above experiments, we find it &s;o, abounding mo&s;tly with whey, and having little of the cream or curd in it. Hence, after a &s;evere fit of illne&s;s, where the body is much emaciated, and the &s;tomach weak, or where the blood is loaded with &s;harp, acrid humours, the clean&s;|ing quality of a&s;s's milk de&s;erves a preference to that of any other animal which is u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e. In con&s;umptive ca&s;es, or where there is a &s;low, habitual fever, it is ju&s;tly to be preferred, until &s;uch time as the con&s;titution may have gained a little &s;trength, when the more nouri&s;hing ought to &s;upply its place.</P>
<P>Mare's milk is e&s;teemed to be much the &s;ame as a&s;s's; but this, indeed, is in very lit|tle u&s;e.</P>
<P>Cow's milk comes next under con&s;idera|tion. This appears to be the riche&s;t and mo&s;t nouri&s;hing of any of the brutes' milk here mentioned. It abounds with a great deal of cream; for, after &s;tanding twelve hours, and being &s;kimmed, it appears equal to any other milk. It contains al&s;o a large quantity of curd; and, after all, even the whey is by far more nutritious than any other.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved that a&s;s's milk, in the experi|ments, mo&s;tly re&s;embles the human. Why then not prefer that to cow's milk, for the food of children? I do not totally deny the u&s;e of this milk for that purpo&s;e; but in our part of the country, it is very expen&s;ive, and
<PB N="135" REF="024796_0126_0FC88E6E9D9BB258">cannot be obtained in any large quantity; for which rea&s;on it would be impracticable to bring it into general u&s;e.</P>
<P>There is, likewi&s;e, another rea&s;on which inclines me to give a preference to cow's milk; for, notwith&s;tanding the &s;imilarity of human milk to that of a&s;&s;es, the fir&s;t may well be &s;uppo&s;ed mo&s;t &s;trengthening, &s;ince women u&s;ually feed on animal as well as vegetable diet, while the brutes we &s;peak of are confi|ned entirely to vegetables. Whence, if we &s;ub&s;titute a&s;s's milk, we &s;hall fall &s;hort of the nouri&s;hment nature de&s;igned for us; and therefore for a young child, who requires a heartening diet, the milk of cows, in my opi|nion, is preferable, as the richne&s;s of it is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, adequate to the &s;uppo&s;ed dif|ference in the qualities of human milk, and that of other animals.</P>
<P>The milk of &s;heep and goats con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of the curd, or earthy particles: hence, where the blood ve&s;&s;els are injured by acrid hu|mours, and frequent bleedings happen from this cau&s;e, or where children are &s;ubject to the rickets, from a weakne&s;s of the bones, that milk, which abounds mo&s;tly with the curd, or chee&s;y part, &s;eems be&s;t calculated to an&s;wer the intention; its earthy, mucilagin|ous, and a&s;tringent property having the great|e&s;t tendency to heal &s;uch ruptured ve&s;&s;els, and to give a firmne&s;s to the bones: but as the&s;e milks po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s of the clean&s;ing power, it will, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, particularly in bleed|ings,
<PB N="136" REF="024796_0127_0FC88E709845EDA0">be proper to u&s;e the more attenuating kind fir&s;t.</P>
<P>We have now examined the different milks familiar to us, and, from their different pro|perties, pointed out the end each &s;ort &s;eems be&s;t calculated to an&s;wer; whence every per|&s;on will quickly be determined which to give the preference to in particular complaints.</P>
<P>When any one fir&s;t begins to eat milk, e&s;|pecially if a free liver, it may probably purge a little; but &s;uch inconveniencies will mo&s;t commonly be removed, by accu&s;toming the con&s;titution to the u&s;e of it; and boiling the milk will in a great mea&s;ure prevent this ef|fect. I have always remarked, that tho&s;e, who, by rea&s;on of a pampered appetite, com|plain of milk and vegetables being windy, and not agreeing with them, are the very per|&s;ons who mo&s;t require &s;uch a diet; for it is the debauched &s;tate of the &s;tomach and bow|els, that occa&s;ions their unea&s;ine&s;s, which this regimen &s;eems the mo&s;t likely to correct.</P>
<P>I have recommended a little &s;alt to be mix|ed with milk, before it is given to children, if they are apt to throw it up curdled, and &s;hall mention the experiment which induced me to give that advice; &s;ince it is equally worthy the attention of grown per&s;ons, &s;ome of whom make this an objection to their eat|ing milk; as I am inclined to believe &s;uch precaution will render it agreeable to mo&s;t con&s;titutions.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="024796_0128_0FC88E76E25A5F60">I put two ounces of milk, warm as it came from the cow, into a tea-cup, with a little common &s;alt; I put the &s;ame quantity, of the like warmth, into another tea-cup, without &s;alt; then dropping a very little di&s;tilled vi|negar into each, a hard curd pre&s;ently appear|ed in that milk which had no &s;alt in it, while the other with the &s;alt was &s;carcely altered.</P>
<P>I tried the &s;ame experiment again, with a large tea-&s;poonful of runnet, and ob&s;erved the milk, which had the &s;alt in it, to continue in its fluid &s;tate, while the other grew thick and turbid, and almo&s;t in&s;tantly &s;eparated in|to curds and whey. This la&s;t experiment an|&s;wered the be&s;t, and is much more to our purpo&s;e than the former. From the&s;e hints, it &s;eems rea&s;onable to conclude, that &s;alt, ta|ken with milk, might equally prevent the too ha&s;ty curdling of it, where there is a great acidity in the &s;tomach; in which ca&s;e, the curdled milk, having too quickly a&s;&s;umed a &s;olidity, becomes trouble&s;ome; and becau&s;e it is not as yet de&s;igned to pa&s;s into the bow|els for the office of nouri&s;hment, a part of this intolerable load is generally di&s;charged by vomiting. Moreover, the &s;timulating qua|lity of &s;alt will greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t a weak dige&s;tion, and thereby facilitate the pa&s;&s;age of the milk from the &s;tomach into the bowels; and from experience, in recommending it to children who u&s;ed to throw up their milk in a curdled &s;tate, I am convinced of its utility.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV.
The &s;ick chamber&mdash;with directions al&s;o for invalids.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now, my dear ladies, entering into the &s;ick chamber, in which, as well as in the nur&s;ery, many amiable characters may be drawn. Here, the conjugal affection of a wife is laudably di&s;played&mdash;the tender love of a mother fondly exerts it&s;elf&mdash;the gratitude and duty of a daughter are con&s;pi|cuous&mdash;the good &s;i&s;ter al&s;o endears her&s;elf to a worthy brother&mdash;and female friend&s;hip wears a thou&s;and additional charms!</P>
<P>Let us picture a truly tender and good wife, in this exalted character! Let us &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;he has de&s;erved recompen&s;e, by re&s;toring to her cha&s;te and longing arms the di&s;tingui&s;hed choice of her youthful love, ennobled by a generous &s;ympathy of virtuous inclinations!</P>
<P>Let us imagine this happy man perfectly re|covered from a dangerous and painful illne&s;s; to which recovery her unwearied attendance proved greatly in&s;trumental: his mind, like|wi&s;e, impre&s;&s;ed with every thought a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="140" REF="024796_0131_0FC88E7B39376278">of &s;uch an obligation can in&s;pire! Behold the hu&s;band admiring her tran&s;cendant excellency; while the hone&s;t tear, perchance, trickling down his check, betrays the big e|motion of a grateful heart. "She, on her part, with looks of cordial love, awhile in &s;i|lent rapture glows&mdash;then on bended knees adores her Maker"&mdash;returns mo&s;t fervid thanks, for that her prayer of &s;orrow has been heard, that He has graciou&s;ly re&s;tored the hu&s;band and the father! How great mu&s;t be their reciprocal felicity!</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to tho&s;e in&s;tructions which are nece&s;&s;ary for the proper execution of this friendly office. There is a certain im|pertinence frequently proceeding from lauda|ble motives, which, neverthele&s;s is totally culpable: I mean, the de&s;ire of our acquaint|ance to vi&s;it a &s;ick chamber. It is oftentimes, I acknowledge, the effect of tenderne&s;s, ill-placed, and a real concern, imprudently ex|pre&s;&s;ed. In general, tho&s;e vi&s;its &s;hould not be permitted. I every day experience the ill ef|fects of chem. When, indeed, a patient is up|on the recovery, and capable of &s;itting up three or four hours at a time, the company of a friend, who knows how far to engage with propriety in conver&s;ation, is a &s;weetly re|fre&s;hing &s;olace: but locks, bolts, or bars can|not be too &s;trong to keep prating go&s;&s;ips, at all times, out of a &s;ick chamber.</P>
<P>During a fever, it is a load &s;ufficient for any patient to bear the di&s;ea&s;e. Quietude on
<PB N="141" REF="024796_0132_0FC88E82A0B38D30">his part, and &s;ilence on the part of tho&s;e about him, ought univer&s;ally to be impo&s;ed. It is not a time for the mind to be engaged either in the pur&s;uit of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This leads me to a con&s;ideration of the ut|mo&s;t importance; and as I am not &s;peaking as a phy&s;ician, but as a friend, it comes pro|perly within that province, and I hope it will be &s;eriou&s;ly attended to by every reader. If it is now prejudicial for any one to think, even of the common concerns of life, how much more injurious mu&s;t it prove, to have the mind engaged in that great work of &s;et|tling, forever, our worldly affairs!</P>
<P>Would you, my rational friends, wi&s;h to be freed from an intolerable burden, never po&s;tpone this important bu&s;ine&s;s until you are upon a bed of &s;ickne&s;s. Not to &s;ay how inca|pable the judgment at &s;uch a time will often prove, perhaps to the detriment of &s;ome de|&s;erving friend, or not unlikely to the confu|&s;ion of a whole family, the very mention of it from any one about us, or the con&s;cious nece&s;&s;ity in our&s;elves, mu&s;t exceedingly hur|ry and depre&s;s the &s;pirits, when tranquillity and &s;upport are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary: for what can &s;uch an idea convey, but death?&mdash; A la&s;t will and te&s;tament is one of the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn acts of life, and ought never to be po&s;t|poned till the agonizing moments of death.</P>
<P>The chamber, proper for a patient, is of no &s;mall moment. There ought to be a free cir|culation of air, whether it be in the &s;ummer
<PB N="142" REF="024796_0133_0FC88E841D4F9210">or winter. I never would have any per&s;on confined to a room without a chimney; it is equally nece&s;&s;ary in the warmer &s;ea&s;on for the purpo&s;e of di&s;charging the offen&s;ive va|pours of di&s;ea&s;e, as it is in cold weather, by means of a little fire, to bring the air to a due temperament, which al&s;o contributes to re|move the like offence.</P>
<P>To you, my female friends, this concern of nur&s;ing belongs. It is an important, and oftentimes a fatiguing ta&s;k. I would willingly engage you in it upon principle, and there|fore &s;hall endeavour to &s;how that man and woman were born for each other's &s;upport and comfort. Their re&s;pective dependence upon each other is, undoubtedly, the wi&s;e or|dination of Omni&s;cience.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;peak of this mutual obligation, without being mindful of the beautiful pa&s;|&s;age in our immortal Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, book the fourth, where Eve gives Adam an account of her&s;elf; and I &s;hall introduce the de&s;cription at length, as a quotation from this author can never be deemed impertinent. Let us attend to the mother of mankind!&mdash;</P>
<LG>
<L>To whom thus Eve reply'd. O thou! for whom</L>
<L>And from whom I was form'd; fle&s;h of thy fle&s;h;</L>
<L>And without whom am to no end; my guide</L>
<L>And head! what thou ha&s;t &s;aid, is ju&s;t and right.</L>
<L>For we to him indeed all prai&s;es owe,</L>
<L>And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy</L>
<L>So far the happier lot, enjoying thee</L>
<L>Pre-eminent by &s;o much odds; while thou</L>
<L>Like con&s;ort to thy&s;elf can&s;t no where find.</L>
<L><PB N="143" REF="024796_0134_0FC88E8617FF6AD8">That day I oft remember, when from &s;leep</L>
<L>I fir&s;t awak'd, and found my&s;elf repos'd</L>

<L>As I bent down to look, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite</L>
<L>A &s;hape within the wat'ry gleam appear'd,</L>

<L>Till I e&s;py'd thee? fair indeed, and tall,</L>
<L>Under a plantan; yet, methought, le&s;s fair,</L>

<L>Thou following cry'd&s;t aloud, Return, fair Eve;</L>
<L>Whom fly'&s;t thou? whom thou fly'&s;t, of him thou art,</L>
<L>His fle&s;h, his bone; to give thee being, I lent</L>
<L>Out of my &s;ide to thee, neare&s;t my heart,</L>
<L>Sub&s;tantial life, to have thee by my &s;ide</L>
<L>Henceforth an individual &s;olace dear:</L>
<L>Part of my &s;oul, I &s;eek thee; and thee claim,</L>
<L>My other half!&mdash;With that, thy gentle hand</L>
<L>Seiz'd mine; I yielded; and from that time &s;ee</L>
<L>How beauty is excell'd by manly grace</L>
<L>And wi&s;dom, which alone is truly fair.</L>

<P><PB N="144" REF="024796_0135_0FC88E874F120458">To illu&s;trate my argument of our mutual dependence, I mu&s;t beg leave to indulge my|&s;elf, and hope likewi&s;e to entertain my read|er, with another quotation from the &s;ame au|thor.

<P>What can more fully &s;how our mutual de|pendence!&mdash;So amiably engaging to each other, our fir&s;t parents, in this poem, are de|&s;cribed, that the labour of either, whereby the other was benefited, mu&s;t prove a real plea&s;ure. What an example for the encou|ragement of matrimony!&mdash;O that we could more generally di&s;play the character of Adam! Then you, my fair-ones, would &s;trive more ardently, in gentlene&s;s and love, to imitate this fir&s;t of women.</P>
<P>If man would endeavour to curb unlaw|ful inclinations, cheri&s;hing and comforting the wife of his bo&s;om; if he would fondly

Let men but begin the refor|mation, and I will be accountable for the right behaviour of the generality of your &s;ex.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, the culpablene&s;s of man will not excu&s;e the folly of woman; and this piece of advice, from a real friend, the la|dies will do well to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>I know my fair pupils will tell me, that al|though a hu&s;band may have follies and vices, yet, if he is but a &s;en&s;ible man, they can over|look them, and cheerfully &s;ubmit to their lord and ma&s;ter&mdash;but who, &s;ay they, can be governed by a fool?</P>
<P>When once a woman has drawn her lot, it is not only her duty, but the height of po|licy, to make the be&s;t of it. Let her choice prove ever &s;o di&s;agreeable, or &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;he was led into &s;uch a marriage by the cruel compul&s;ion of her friends, &s;till honour and obedience are required on her part. By giv|ing importance to an hu&s;band, (even tho&s;e hu&s;bands we are now &s;peaking of, for others will command it) a wife merits, and gener|ally obtains, prai&s;e and adoration, not only from him, but from the whole world.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the mi&s;taken &s;he, who in company degrades, and upon every occa&s;ion tauntingly reproaches her hu&s;band, thus making him, poor man, the contemptible

<P>But to return from our pre&s;ent wander|ing, which I intentionally followed as an en|couragement to virtue, a con&s;i&s;tency of cha|racter, and mutual love; being convinced that the&s;e qualifications will make even a con&s;tant attendance in a &s;ick chamber not al|together unplea&s;ing. Now then let us pur&s;ue our further care, where female tenderne&s;s can a&s;&s;uage the &s;evere&s;t bodily pains, and render the greate&s;t misfortunes of life at lea&s;t &s;upportable.</P>
<P>In every di&s;order, phy&s;ic and good nur&s;ing ought to go hand in hand; and I am the more de&s;irous of giving my opinion with re&s;pect to good nur&s;ing, as I mean to op|po&s;e it to poor and bad nur&s;ing, which has been too much the unlucky and mi&s;taken practice of the &s;ick chamber: for under the vague idea of inflammation, and inflamma|tory di&s;ea&s;es, even bread and water have been &s;ometimes accounted too great a &s;up|port for the patient. But with plea&s;ure, we now &s;ee phy&s;icians act upon more rational principles; and I would wi&s;h to convince
<PB N="149" REF="024796_0140_0FC88E93DAD3E798">you, ladies, who&s;e province it is, of the propriety of &s;upporting patients under every di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;ick chamber is our &s;ubject; but it is al&s;o to be under&s;tood, that the precau|tions here laid down will prove equally ne|ce&s;&s;ary, where invalids are permitted to at|tend to the common affairs of life; for, with|out a prudent regulation in our method of living, few con&s;titutional or long-exi&s;ting ails can be removed, or even rendered in any degree light, and ea&s;ily to be borne; but I am clearly convinced, that it is very po&s;&s;i|ble for many infirm per&s;ons to pa&s;s comfor|tably through a tolerable length of life, and, at la&s;t, to pay an ea&s;y debt to nature.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It would be &s;welling this letter to a very great bulk, were I to enter into a particular account of the diet proper for invalids. The reader who is under the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving &s;uch a prudent re&s;traint, is there|fore referred to my ob&s;ervations upon diet, in the Fa|mily Phy&s;ician: &s;ome hints of this kind are there thrown out, which he may probably con&s;ider as not al|together unworthy of his attention.</NOTE></P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations, therefore, upon chil|dren and aged per&s;ons, are equally applica|ble to tho&s;e who, by ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions and intemperance, have ruined their health; for in either of the&s;e ca&s;es, where the bodily powers are enervated, and the dige&s;tion weakened, a proper, light, and nouri&s;hing diet is as nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore health, as it is to &s;upport the young, and pre&s;erve the aged.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="024796_0141_0FC88E967400B2C8">Every di&s;ea&s;e is to be con&s;idered as a de|viation from health; and a fever is the means made u&s;e of by Nature to free the body from &s;omething that is noxious. Ought, we, therefore, to counteract her in this her own great work? Ought we not rather cau|tiou&s;ly and prudently, like a valuable hand|maid, to tend upon her movements, and generou&s;ly &s;upport her in the de&s;ign &s;he aims at? Surely this appears to every one rea|&s;onable.</P>
<P>However, where there is a fever, or great weakne&s;s of the body, or where the body it&s;elf is emaciated, an alteration from the common manner of living is certainly nece&s;|&s;ary. To the&s;e points, therefore, I &s;hall con|fine my advice, as other con&s;iderations come under a medical direction.</P>
<P>Few per&s;ons are con&s;trained to keep their chambers, who are not troubled with great lo&s;s of &s;trength, or feveri&s;h complaints; either as the fir&s;t cau&s;e, or as &s;ymptoms ac|companying other di&s;ea&s;es. Suppo&s;ing then the&s;e circum&s;tances, the con&s;titution being thus reduced, or Nature labouring to throw off a di&s;ea&s;e, the body certainly requires a nouri&s;hment of the mo&s;t &s;imple kind; by &s;imple, I mean ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, but let it at the &s;ame time be comfortable. The &s;tomach and bowels mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, be equally af|fected with the other parts of the body, and con&s;equently unable to perform their offices upon the common &s;upports of life.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="024796_0142_0FC88E979AF5C390">Animal food, therefore, is particularly to be forbidden: and I am &s;orry to be obliged to blame the fondne&s;s of parents, and tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;ick chambers, for too frequent|ly indulging patients thus unwarrantably. Give me leave to ob&s;erve, if fle&s;h be permit|ted during the exi&s;tence of a fever, or when the body, by illne&s;s, is exceedingly weaken|ed and emaciated, from the incapacity of the dige&s;tive faculties, the nouri&s;hment produced mu&s;t be imperfect, crude, offen&s;ive; and con|&s;equently, in&s;tead of a &s;upport, mu&s;t add an additional weight to the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>But, at the &s;ame time, let it be remember|ed, that, as a &s;upport is nece&s;&s;ary, good broths, wine whey, jellies, panado, a beverage of wine and water, &amp;c. are to be di&s;cretionally permitted; and indeed the inclination of the &s;ick per&s;on will generally determine the pro|priety of the&s;e things; for where they are hurtful, an univer&s;al loathing of them com|monly takes place.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;uch like &s;ippings, being ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, are not only the propere&s;t for a di&s;|ea&s;ed &s;tate of the &s;tomach and bowels, but they al&s;o &s;upply the body with a nece&s;&s;ary nouri&s;hment to uphold its &s;trength under the di&s;order. It is a point at pre&s;ent acknowledg|ed by all good phy&s;icians. It is, in my opinion, a circum&s;tance minutely to be dwelt upon; for woful experience has often convinced me, that the ra&s;hne&s;s of an ob&s;tinate nur&s;e, in one unlucky hour, has counteracted the opera|tions
<PB N="152" REF="024796_0143_0FC88E99D849BE30">of a well-regulated, and otherwi&s;e &s;uc|ce&s;sful, regimen.</P>
<P>Although I would debar patients from ani|mal food, where there is a feveri&s;h complaint, neverthele&s;s I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly recommend a generous, but di&s;cretionary, &s;upport of ea&s;ily dige&s;ted and comfortable liquid nouri&s;hment, in every fever. I mean, that barley-water, mint and balm tea, with &s;uch like drinks, will not &s;ufficiently &s;upport the &s;trength of a pa|tient under any kind of fever, even for a few days, and much le&s;s for as many weeks. As to the di&s;tinctions of inflammatory, nervous, and putrid, it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to enter upon them here; but &s;uppo&s;ing the fever to be in|flammatory, the patient is, or ought to be, con|fined to bed, and a breathing &s;weat encoura|ged. Will not then an already almo&s;t dige&s;ted and innocent liquid nouri&s;hment an&s;wer the phy&s;ician's aim, at the &s;ame time that it &s;up|ports the patient? Experience has convinced me of its utility. I cannot help, therefore, &s;trongly recommending it; for I am too ap|prehen&s;ive that many lives are daily lo&s;t for want of this nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport.</P>
<P>I am labouring to prevent that mi&s;taken care, which is commonly called &s;tarving a di&s;ea&s;e, and to &s;et a&s;ide the dreadful appre|hen&s;ion that a little innocent nouri&s;hment gi|ven to a per&s;on in a fever, is &s;till adding fuel to the fire. By the&s;e errors the able&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance is oftentimes baffled, to the co&s;t of the patient; and, not unlikely, to the di&s;grace of
<PB N="153" REF="024796_0144_0FC88EA057219D98">a worthy practitioner. Be a&s;&s;ured, that it is more eligible to endeavour to &s;upport, and build up again, a &s;haken, di&s;ea&s;ed, and totter|ing frame, than to attempt to pull it down. Never let this be done but by the expre&s;s com|mand of wi&s;dom and experience; for it is a &s;erious affair at all times to deprive a tene|ment of its foundation and &s;trength. It is much to be wi&s;hed, as it &s;urely mu&s;t prove a general advantage, that phy&s;icians would more particularly direct the regimen of diet in &s;ick chambers.</P>
<P>The punctuality of nur&s;es, and tho&s;e who attend upon the &s;ick, in the admini&s;tering of medicines, is of no &s;mall import. It is a cruel reflexion upon the hone&s;t part of the profe&s;|&s;ion, that practitioners con&s;ult the number of their fees, or the length of their bills, more than the health of their patients. Such ini|quity is but very &s;eldom, I hope, if ever, prac|ti&s;ed; and as few per&s;ons employ any but tho&s;e of whom they entertain a good opinion, let me warn you, as a friend, not to indulge a &s;u&s;picion which betrays a mean &s;oul, and mo&s;t probably will, at &s;ome time or other, pro|duce fatal con&s;equences to your&s;elves. Great relief, nay, oftentimes, perfect health, is a&s;|&s;uredly to be obtained by the help of medi|cine. Great evil, nay, too frequently, certain death, en&s;ues from a jealous contempt, or wanton neglect of this &s;alutary aid.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t &s;peak of another mi&s;take, with re|gard to the management of linen. A patient
<PB N="154" REF="024796_0145_0FC88EA2C7FE7A70">cannot be hurt by changing wet, filthy, and offen&s;ive linen, for that which is dry, clean, and comfortable; provided this be done with proper care, not to give cold during the time of &s;hifting the clothes. Linen which is per|fectly dry and clean is, at all times, to be preferred to that which has been u&s;ed; for the latter may have ab&s;orbed offen&s;ive va|pours, of which the former mu&s;t be entirely free. Again&s;t this ob&s;ervation, I am convinc|ed, there are great prejudices; neverthele&s;s tho&s;e who employ their rea&s;on but for a mo|ment, will &s;ee the propriety of the pre&s;ent caution.</P>
<P>A free &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of air is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;a|ry not only to carry off the offen&s;ive vapours of di&s;ea&s;e, but al&s;o to the recovery of the pa|tient; nay, even to the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e who attend upon the &s;ick. It is true that a fire is proper in cold weather, for rea&s;ons be|fore given; but at the &s;ame time the cham|ber ought to be no more than comfortably warm; for where this degree of heat is ex|ceeded, faint &s;weats are likely to exhau&s;t the patient's &s;trength, whereby he &s;inks, perhaps, under a di&s;ea&s;e, through which, probably, he might otherwi&s;e have been &s;upported.</P>
<P>Having now cautioned you again&s;t the mo&s;t material errors, which, at pre&s;ent, occur to my memory, I will beg leave to ob&s;erve what poor creatures men in general are, when ne|ce&s;&s;ity confines them to a &s;ick chamber! If we reflect upon this &s;cene, ought we to complain
<PB N="155" REF="024796_0146_0FC88EA3A4487F78">of the &s;pirits of women? I &s;carcely ever find a man, in &s;ickne&s;s, &s;upport him&s;elf &s;o well as a woman does. Men are, for the mo&s;t part, depre&s;&s;ed in their &s;pirits, to the greate&s;t de|gree, when they are ill. Be it then with gra|titude remembered, that in a &s;ick chamber, the plea&s;ing vivacity, and, let me add, the true philo&s;ophy, of a kind female friend, prove e&s;|&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary. A good nur&s;e will, in a great mea&s;ure, alleviate our bodily infirmi|ties, by &s;upporting our &s;pirits in time of &s;ick|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>A man, by &s;triking and &s;uperior abilities, indu&s;try, and good fortune, is &s;ometimes luc|ky enough to rai&s;e him&s;elf, aggrandi&s;e his fa|mily, and bring to his wife conveniencies far beyond her expectations. But what are all the&s;e things, compared to the comfort, and tender &s;upport, which &s;he in return can largely be|&s;tow upon him; at a time too when the in|firmities of nature will not &s;uffer &s;uch an ex|alted favourite of fortune to reli&s;h any one enjoyment of life? A&s;k this very darling, when he is &s;tretched on the bed of &s;ickne&s;s, and rendered helple&s;s by di&s;ea&s;e;&mdash;let us fan|cy him too almo&s;t expiring under excruciating agonies&mdash;and now put the que&s;tion to him, Which is more eligible, fortune or health? He will a&s;&s;uredly an&s;wer, that one moment's ea&s;e is more de&s;irable than all the &s;plendid ad|vantages he may have obtained.</P>
<P>In like manner, the truly affectionate and &s;ympathi&s;ing concern, the delicate deport|ment,
<PB N="156" REF="024796_0147_0FC88EA51FF47350">and careful attendance of a good wife, in the&s;e &s;cenes of painful &s;ufferance, more than over-balance every thing that is in the power of the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful hu&s;band to be|&s;tow upon her; and it is a truth which truly generous minds will ever gratefully acknow|ledge.</P>
<P>A man under the&s;e circum&s;tances, with &s;ome regard to his accu&s;tomed manner of liv|ing, and the particular di&s;ea&s;e, is to be con&s;i|dered as a child; and con&s;equently ought to be &s;ubmitted to female management. Your care, therefore, will of cour&s;e direct you to &s;eek the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of able and experienced phy&s;icians. May their &s;kill conquer the di&s;|ea&s;e, while you generou&s;ly &s;upport his &s;trength and &s;pirits; and thereby greatly contribute to re&s;tore again the invalid to a healthy and vi|gorous con&s;titution!</P>

Old age&mdash;by virtue rendered truly honourable. The &s;teps by which we mounted into life, &s;hown to be the ea&s;ie&s;t and be&s;t paths to de&s;cend into the grave.</HEAD>
<P>SPRING, &s;ummer, and autumn, have their various engaging charms; and there is &s;omething peculiarly plea&s;ing in each tran&s;i|tion; but &s;tern winter can boa&s;t of nothing be&s;ides the fruits of the preceding &s;ea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The life of man is often, with propriety, compared to the progre&s;&s;ive year; and the only happine&s;s that can be expected in old age, mu&s;t ari&s;e from the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of a well-&s;pent life; at which time, being likewi&s;e the winter of our days, every per&s;on may gen|erally reap the fruits of a pa&s;t virtuous con|duct:&mdash;for although the benumbed limbs de|ny the body their u&s;ual &s;upport, and the hoary head trembles on its withered &s;houlders, there are valuable comforts yet in &s;tore for tho&s;e, who, like the indu&s;trious ant, have been wi&s;e enough to trea&s;ure them at the proper &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Such a good man or woman, one would hope, has wherewithal to procure the in|dulgencies
<PB N="158" REF="024796_0149_0FC88EAE408243A8">their years require, and a &s;ufficien|cy to requite the attendance of a faithful &s;er|vant. Join to the&s;e a further ble&s;&s;ing, that, perchance, kind Heaven has be&s;towed, a dutiful and good daughter to &s;upport their infirmities, and, by her affectionate tender|ne&s;s fully to repay them for the pains of her education, and that parental anxiety, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been &s;u&s;tained during her youth. Here, I &s;ay, the wi&s;dom and ten|der indulgence of a kind parent is amply re|warded, by the fo&s;tering care of a truly vir|tuous and affectionate child. The&s;e are ine&s;|timable comforts; and &s;uch is the ea&s;y de|cline that Providence intended to old age&mdash; thus to clo&s;e life with a not unhappy pe|riod.</P>
<P>Let us, my amiable friends, picture a worthy and aged man in his &s;econd infant &s;tate. Let us with compo&s;ure attend him to the gates of death, there to deliver him up into the bo&s;om of his Creator! Let us in|dulge a rational &s;orrow, but at the &s;ame time &s;upport that calmne&s;s and &s;erenity which denote a religiou&s;ly-informed mind. Let us con&s;ider this as a debt we mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly pay, and that it puts an everla&s;ting period to the calamities of this life! Whence may be drawn this comfortable conclu&s;ion; that, if to the uttermo&s;t of our power we have contributed to the great end for which we were created, our future &s;tate of exi&s;tence mu&s;t be happier than the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="024796_0150_0FC88EB2943EA9B8">Come then, ye tender and &s;ympathi&s;ing fair, let us approach the chamber of death! Let us advance to the bed of this good pa|rent, and behold his calm and re&s;igned coun|tenance! Although we &s;hall find it a &s;olemn &s;cene, yet there is nothing &s;o terrible in this &s;ight as the world generally imagine. But draw the contrary character, that of a wicked man in his la&s;t moments; and it mu&s;t be &s;hocking indeed.</P>
<P>As ripened and mellow fruit drops, un|touched, from the tree to its mother earth; &s;o the good old man falls peaceably into the grave, and mingles again with the common du&s;t from which he originally &s;prang.</P>
<P>It is the vicious alone that have rea&s;on to be terrified at the thoughts of death; but we are de&s;cribing the upright man, not un|likely taking a la&s;t and affectionate farewell of his lovely and dutiful daughters; ex|horting them to the practice of virtue, and recounting the rewards attendant upon it. The elde&s;t, perhaps, in her willing arms &s;upports the expiring fire, while the younge&s;t admini&s;ters &s;ome refre&s;hing cordial to de|tain, for a moment, the fleeting &s;pirit. Mean while the tranquil parent, peradventure, gently rebukes the falling tear, prophetically foretelling that their la&s;t moments &s;hall be peaceable like his&mdash;and ble&s;&s;es them with his dying lips.</P>
<P>For &s;uch characters, delineated more at large, and which are worthy of our admi|ration
<PB N="160" REF="024796_0151_0FC88EB35FCA1790">and reverence, I mu&s;t refer my gentle readers, for the female one, to that great ma&s;ter of human feelings, mr. Richard&s;on, in his hi&s;tory of &s;ir Charles Grandi&s;on. How beautifully is honourable age exemplified in the character of mrs. Shirley! The account there given of the latter part of her life will a&s;&s;uredly delight and in&s;truct every one. The death of lady Grandi&s;on, how inexpre&s;&s;ibly intere&s;ting! Although her temples were co|vered with untimely &s;now, yet, in the char|acter of wife, parent, and chri&s;tian, her ex|alted virtue had &s;hone unrivalled; and when the awful period approached, behold her de|parture, like the &s;etting &s;un,&mdash;leaving hu&s;|band, children, and a world of friends, to mourn the eternal ab&s;ence of her cheering rays!</P>
<P>The whole work contains a noble &s;y&s;tem of morality, and is highly to be recommend|ed to all young per&s;ons. The&s;e u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons will be &s;till more in&s;tructive, when read in the company of tho&s;e who are capable of making proper remarks. This being premi&s;|ed, virtuous emulation will ever be mo&s;t excited in young minds from characters which appear real, becau&s;e example always proves &s;tronger than precept. Thus enter|tainment and improvement will go hand in hand.</P>
<P>For the other character, I mean that of the good old man, no one has excelled the ingenious and learned dr. Arm&s;trong, in his
<PB N="161" REF="024796_0152_0FC88EB51DE6D0D0">E&s;&s;ay upon health. The whole poem, indeed, is written in a ma&s;terly &s;tyle, and conveys many u&s;eful in&s;tructions, truly worthy of pe|ru&s;al; but his de&s;cription of honourable age is inimitable; and although very conci&s;e, ne|verthele&s;s it contains a volume of panegyric. I &s;hall beg that gentleman's leave to tran&s;cribe it.&mdash;</P>
<LG>
<L>How to live happie&s;t; how avoid the pains,</L>
<L>The di&s;appointments, and di&s;gu&s;ts of tho&s;e</L>
<L>Who would in plea&s;ure all their hours employ,</L>
<L>The precepts here of a divine old man</L>
<L>I could recite. Though old, he &s;till retain'd</L>
<L>His manly &s;en&s;e, and energy of mind.</L>
<L>Virtuous and wi&s;e he was, but not &s;evere;</L>
<L>He &s;till remember'd that he once was young;</L>
<L>His ea&s;y pre&s;ence check'd no decent joy.</L>
<L>Him ev'n the di&s;&s;olute admir'd; for he</L>
<L>A graceful loo&s;ene&s;s when he pleas'd put on,</L>
<L>And laughing could in&s;truct. Much had he read,</L>
<L>Much more had &s;een; he &s;tudied from the life,</L>
<L>And in th' original perus'd mankind.</L>
</LG>
<P>Such characters render old age de&s;irable, lovely, and truly honourable. The odium of peevi&s;h and moro&s;e vani&s;hes, while our reve|rence and admiration &s;tand alone engaged. Who would not wi&s;h to be that old man, who&s;e calm tranquillity far &s;urpa&s;&s;es the tran|&s;ient and pa&s;&s;ionate enjoyments of youth? Happy children ble&s;t with &s;uch happy parents!</P>
<P>From this de&s;cription I hope to intere&s;t the tender pa&s;&s;ions of my fair readers, &s;o as to make them cheerfully contribute to the com|forts of their aged parents, while they yet live. A dutiful daughter mu&s;t ever make a
<PB N="162" REF="024796_0153_0FC88EB8E287A920">good wife and tender mother; and to a pru|dent di&s;cerning man, it is certainly one of the greate&s;t recommendations in the choice of a companion for life.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a cruel and undutiful child is the mo&s;t odious and unnatural mon|&s;ter upon earth; in&s;omuch that the Chine&s;e are &s;aid to puni&s;h &s;uch crimes with the great|e&s;t &s;everity. It is recorded in their hi&s;tory, that if a &s;on &s;hould be known to kill, or &s;o much as to &s;trike his father, not only the cri|minal, but his whole family, would be rooted out, their dwelling razed to the ground, and its foundation &s;own with &s;alt; nay, Le Compte adds, that the inhabitants of the place where he lived would be put to the &s;word; as they conclude there mu&s;t have been a total depra|vation of manners in that clan, or &s;ociety of people, who could have bred up among them &s;o horrid an offender.</P>
<P>How beautifully has our inimitable Shake|&s;peare drawn the two contra&s;ted characters, in his de&s;cription of Lear and his three daugh|ters; where the two elder appear like Satan's evil angels, while Cordelia, the poor Corde|lia, is an exalted example of filial tenderne&s;s and affection!</P>
<P>To your peculiar province, ye amiable fair, is this la&s;t great duty con&s;igned: to in&s;truct you, therefore, in the proper execution of it, a few u&s;eful ob&s;ervations may not be un&s;ea|&s;onably introduced.</P>
<P>In a former letter we likened infancy to a lender plant; where we taught the be&s;t me|thod
<PB N="163" REF="024796_0154_0FC88EBECDB892C0">of rearing it, &s;o as to make it flouri&s;h in the garden of the world. The &s;ummer having produced you, the fair fruit of this goodly tree; and the autumn of your parent-&s;tock having ripened your under&s;tanding; it is but meet that &s;uch knowledge &s;hould direct you, at this frozen &s;ea&s;on, to cheri&s;h the decaying root from whence you &s;prang.</P>
<P>We have taken notice of the helple&s;s &s;tate of childhood, before the body has acquired &s;trength &s;ufficient to prepare its own nouri&s;h|ment: we have &s;hown the time when in&s;tinct and rea&s;on direct us to provide for our&s;elves; and particularly ob&s;erved, that animal food was never de&s;igned for our u&s;e until we had teeth given us to eat it.</P>
<P>Let us continue the&s;e &s;peculations, and re|gard the natural growth of our bodies, toge|ther with the increa&s;ing &s;trength of our con|&s;titutions. Behold the child, whom you late|ly fondled in your arms, now contending with his play-fellows in boyi&s;h &s;ports: again, ob|&s;erve him who lately returned from &s;chool with his &s;atchel in his hand, now panting fore|mo&s;t in the chace: and now &s;ee manhood &s;tamped upon the downy cheek. Let us like|wi&s;e remember the equally gradual declen&s;ion. At length the &s;turdy &s;on &s;upports his feeble &s;ire; for he who, in his youth, was &s;wifte&s;t in the race, is now &s;carcely able to uphold his tottering limbs. The man of war, who&s;e &s;tur|dy arm wielded the blood-thir&s;ting &s;word of battle, is now bending under the weight of
<PB N="164" REF="024796_0155_0FC88EC01F9F3ED0">his own body. Behold, his &s;inews are dried up, and the purple current that bounded in his veins, now heavily and &s;carcely creeps along. In every part alike the powers of this wonderful machine decay. The teeth, de|&s;igned both for u&s;e and ornament, robbed of their beautiful enamel, become un&s;ightly, and drop out of their &s;ockets: the penetrating eye, that &s;earched into the very aby&s;s of thought, is altogether u&s;ele&s;s, or but dimly di&s;cerns the rays of light. Manly fortitude is now no mere; and wi&s;dom it&s;elf retires from the decayed man&s;ion. Such is the almo&s;t uni|ver&s;al condition of old age, properly called our &s;econd childhood; and plain are the in|ferences to be drawn from hence.</P>
<P>If a light and ea&s;ily dige&s;ted nouri&s;hment was nece&s;&s;ary before our bodies had obtained their proper &s;trength, &s;urely a &s;imilar method of living is the mo&s;t proper when they have lo&s;t it; and therefore&mdash;the &s;teps by which we mounted into life, are the ea&s;ie&s;t and be&s;t paths to de&s;cend into the grave.</P>
<P>The dige&s;tive powers of age are equally en|feebled with the members of the body; and, undoubtedly, the &s;ame rea&s;on that forbad the u&s;e of fle&s;h, before we had teeth, points out the nece&s;&s;ity of gradually declining it as they decay. There are, indeed, &s;ome few per&s;ons toothle&s;s who are not far advanced in life; but &s;uch con&s;titutions are generally feeble, and therefore the precautions are not unap|plicable to them,</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="024796_0156_0FC88EC1D1976EE8">The&s;e arguments being rightly under&s;tood, there will be little occa&s;ion to enlarge upon this &s;ubject; as the directions for the ma|nagement of children, from the time of wean|ing them, until they may be entru&s;ted to the care of them&s;elves, comprehend every nece&s;|&s;ary in&s;truction for the regimen of old age; and tho&s;e per&s;ons act wi&s;ely who con&s;ider it as a &s;econd childhood.</P>
<P>I need not be more particular on this head, as few, I am per&s;uaded, will &s;uppo&s;e this pe|riod to commence with them&s;elves, before it is nece&s;&s;ary for them to conform to the&s;e rules.</P>
<P>Age, undoubtedly, requires indulgence; but at the &s;ame time indolence creeps on it imperceptibly. Tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;uffer lea&s;t from pain, who rou&s;e them&s;elves to a &s;tate of acti|vity; and there are exerci&s;es well adapted even to advanced life: an additional warmth of covering is at this time nece&s;&s;ary; yet tho&s;e act mo&s;t prudently who do not accu&s;tom them&s;elves to very warm clothes, and very warm rooms, while they are capable of endu|ring the variations of their natural climate.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, one remark mu&s;t not e&s;|cape our ob&s;ervation; I mean, the happy ef|fect of temperance through life: it not only prevents di&s;ea&s;e as we are upon our journey, but enables us to receive the intended be|nefit, and cordial &s;upport, of wine, and other comfortable &s;ippings, in this time of need. Nature, in a temperate per&s;on, obtains fre&s;h
<PB N="166" REF="024796_0157_0FC88EC5C5560B08">vigour and &s;pirits from &s;uch exhilarating jui|ces; but where the con&s;titution has been ac|cu&s;tomed to exce&s;s, no advantage, in the de|cline of life, can be derived from their u&s;e.</P>
<P>I have now fulfilled my pre&s;ent de&s;ign; and through every letter have aimed at convey|ing my ob&s;ervations in a rational and amu|&s;ing manner; calculated, I hope, to plea&s;e, at the &s;ame time that I wi&s;h to in&s;truct. It is a topic, which, in different parts of it, has been handled by very able men; and yet has generally, I believe, been e&s;teemed a dry &s;ubject, particularly by the ladies, to whom it e&s;&s;entially belongs. This di&s;like &s;eems, probably, to have ari&s;en from the &s;tyle not &s;eeing &s;ufficiently void of terms of art; for the ta&s;te, as well as the judgment, mu&s;t be plea&s;ed, when we mean to encounter preju|dices, and to correct long e&s;tabli&s;hed er|rors.</P>
<P>It will give me a particular &s;atisfaction, if I have &s;o far &s;ucceeded in my undertaking, as that the pre&s;ent collection of letters may de&s;erve a place in the ladies library; and per|haps this little volume may &s;ometimes prove the companion of the nur&s;ery and &s;ick cham|ber, or even afford an hour's amu&s;ement in a carriage.</P>
<P>It is intended, my fair, to render your characters truly amiable; and I tru&s;t will be received as a pre&s;ent from a &s;incere friend to the &s;ex. Where tenderne&s;s, good-nature, &s;en&s;e, and virtue, are beautifully blended in
<PB N="167" REF="024796_0158_0FC88ECBAAAB8DB0">a female form, our admiration and love are equally engaged; and where this proves to be the ca&s;e, every man is, &s;urely, de&s;i|rous of contributing to the &s;ervice of per|fections &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly engaging&mdash;&s;uch, at lea&s;t, is the re&s;olution of,</P>
