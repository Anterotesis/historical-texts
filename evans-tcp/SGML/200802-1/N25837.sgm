<HEAD>Directions for preventing the further progre&s;s of the Malignant, contagious Fever.</HEAD>
<P>The College of Phy&s;icians having taken into con|&s;ideration the malignant and contagious fever which now prevails in this city, have agreed to recom|mend to their fellow citizens the following means of preventing its progre&s;s.</P>
<P>FIRST.&mdash;That all unnece&s;&s;ary intercour&s;e &s;hould be avoided with &s;uch per&s;ons as are infected by it.</P>
<P>SECOND.&mdash;To place a mark upon the door or window of &s;uch hou&s;es as have any infected per&s;ons in them.</P>
<P>THIRD.&mdash;To place the per&s;ons infected in the center of large and airy rooms, in beds without curtains, and to pay the &s;tricte&s;t regard to cleanli|ne&s;s, by frequently changing their body and bed|linen; al&s;o by removing, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, all offen&s;ive matters from their rooms.</P>
<P>FOURTH.&mdash;To provide a large and airy ho&s;pital in the neighbourhood of the city, for the reception of &s;uch poor per&s;ons as cannot be accommodated with the above advantages in private hou&s;es.</P>
<P>FIFTH.&mdash;To put a &s;top to the tolling of the bells.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="034356_0005_0FFC2ABC767905C8">
SIXTH.&mdash;To bury &s;uch per&s;ons as die of the fever, in carriages, and in as private a manner as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>SEVENTH.&mdash;To keep the &s;treets and wharves of the city as clean as po&s;&s;ible. As the contagion of the di&s;ea&s;e may be taken into the body and pa&s;s out of it without producing the fever, unle&s;s it be rendered active by &s;ome occa&s;ional cau&s;e, the fol|lowing means &s;hould be attended to, to prevent the contagion from being excited into action in the body.</P>
<P>EIGHTH.&mdash;To avoid all fatigue of body and mind.</P>
<P>NINTH.&mdash;To avoid &s;tanding or &s;itting in the &s;un, al&s;o in a current of air, or in the evening air.</P>
<P>TENTH.&mdash;To accommodate the dre&s;s to the weather, and to exceed rather in warm than in cold cloathing.</P>
<P>ELEVENTH.&mdash;To avoid intemperance, but to u&s;e fermented liquors, &s;uch as wine, beer and cyder with moderation.</P>
<P>The college conceive fires to be very ineffectual, if not dangerous means, of checking the progre&s;s of the fever. They have rea&s;on to place more depen|dence upon the burning of gun-powder. The benefits of vinegar and camphire are confined chief|ly to infected rooms, and they cannot be u&s;ed too frequently upon handkerchiefs or in &s;melling-bottles, by per&s;ons who&s;e duty calls them to vi&s;it or attend the &s;ick.</P>

<P>Was the di&s;order imported or not? If imported, when, by what means, and from what place? If not imported, what were the probable cau&s;es that pro|duced it? What mea&s;ures ought to be pur&s;ued to purify the city from any latent infection; and what precautions are be&s;t calculated to guard again&s;t the future occurrence of a &s;imilar calamity?</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that the public &s;pirit and benevo|lence of the College of Phy&s;icians will induce them chearfully to excu&s;e and to comply with this reque&s;t, which is intended to e&s;tabli&s;h a foundation for regu|lations, that may co-operate with their profe&s;&s;ional labours, in pre&s;erving to their fellow citizens the in|valuable ble&s;&s;ing of health.</P>

<HEAD>An&s;wer to the Governor's Letter.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It has not been from a want of re&s;pect to your&s;elf nor from an inattention to the &s;ubject that your letter of the 30th ult. was not &s;ooner an&s;wered&mdash;but the importance of the que&s;tion propo&s;ed has made it nece&s;&s;ary for us to devote a con&s;iderable portion of time and diligence to this bu&s;ine&s;s, in order to arrive at a &s;afe and ju&s;t conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>No in&s;tance has ever occurred, of the di&s;ea&s;e cal|led the Yellow Fever, being generated in this city, or in any other part of this &s;tate, as far as we know; but there have been frequent in&s;tances of its having been imported, not only into this, but into other parts of North-America, and prevailing there for a cer|tain period of time&mdash;and from the ri&s;e, progre&s;s and nature of the malignant Fever, which began to prevail here about the beginning of la&s;t Augu&s;t, and extended it&s;elf gradually over a great part of the city, we are of opinion, that this di&s;ea&s;e was import|ed into Philadelphia by &s;ome of the ve&s;&s;els which arrived in the port after the middle of July. This opinion we are further confirmed in by the various accounts we have received from the be&s;t authorities we could procure on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>To purify the city from latent infection, we would recommend, that every hou&s;e, particularly tho&s;e in which there have been any &s;ick, &s;hould be thoroughly clean&s;ed and kept open, &s;o as to admit fre&s;h air through every aperture&mdash;the walls &s;hould be white|wa&s;hed and gunpowder burned in all the apartments&mdash;the beds and woollen apparel of the &s;ick &s;hould either be de&s;troyed or &s;moaked with gunpowder in a

clo&s;e room, and expo&s;ed to the air and rain&mdash;un|&s;laked Lime, &s;hould be thrown down the Nece&s;&s;a|ries, and the &s;treets &s;hould be kept clean, e&s;pecially in the confined parts of the city.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to your la&s;t que&s;tion, permit us to ob|&s;erve, that we tru&s;t the early attention of the Le|gi&s;lature will be directed to the &s;afety of the port, with re&s;pect to the officers and other arrangements which may be found nece&s;&s;ary; and on &s;uch an occa&s;ion the College will ever cheerfully co-ope|rate with them in their endeavours to prevent, avert, or, remove the&s;e dangerous calamities.</P>

<P>The Committee on the Health Laws, appointed at the la&s;t &s;tated Meeting, made the following Re|port, viz.</P>
<P>The Committee, appointed by the College of Phy&s;icians, to con&s;ider the Health Laws, having attended to the &s;ubject, report, that the &s;aid law appears to them to be inadequate to the purpo&s;es intended to be embraced by the Legi&s;lature, par|ticularly as it re&s;pects the exten&s;ion of Malignant, Contagious Di&s;ea&s;es, when they appear in the city.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e which appears to require mo&s;t at|tention in this re&s;pect is the Yellow Fever; for it is probable, that whenever this complaint is very pre|valent in the We&s;t-Indies (which is generally the ca&s;e in time of war) it will find its way to this city, notwith&s;tanding the care of the Health Officers.&mdash;Being highly contagious in cities, when it is intro|duced, the lives of our fellow-citizens will be expo&s;ed to extreme danger.&mdash;But notwith&s;tanding its con|tagious nature, the hi&s;tory of the plague and of other Contagious di&s;ea&s;es, authorizes the Committee to &s;ay,
<PB N="8" REF="034356_0010_0FFC2AA4209775C8">
that by proper exertions, it may be prevented from &s;preading when introduced.</P>
<P>Exertions of this kind can only be made or di|rected by per&s;ons who have &s;ome knowledge of the nature and effects of contagion and can judge right|ly of &s;u&s;picious ca&s;es when they occur.&mdash;The Com|mittee therefore con&s;ider the law as defective in this point, becau&s;e it neither lays down a preci&s;e rule of conduct for the con&s;ulting phy&s;ician employed in this bu&s;ine&s;s, nor commits the object to his &s;ole di&s;cretion; but it a&s;&s;ociates with him any two members of the Committee of Health, without pro|viding that the&s;e Gentlemen &s;hould have &s;ufficient information on the general &s;ubject; and therefore, the whole object of the law may be lo&s;t, by the mi&s;|takes which will ari&s;e from their want of Medical knowledge.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary, if a di&s;cretionary power be com|mitted to any body of men, that a majority of them &s;hould under&s;tand the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s entru&s;ted to them; and from this view of the &s;ubject, the Committee are induced to propo&s;e to the College, to recommend to the Legi&s;lature, to commit the powers nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the ex|ten&s;ion of Malignant Contagious Di&s;orders, to the con&s;ulting Phy&s;ician, and a &s;mall number of a&s;&s;ociates of the Medical Profe&s;&s;ion, a majority of whom &s;hall determine what mea&s;ures are to be pur&s;ued, when occa&s;ions of alarm may occur. Of the many advanta|ges which will be derived from this a&s;&s;ociation of profe&s;&s;ional gentlemen, the Committee will content them&s;elves with enumerating two:</P>
<P>1&s;t. The con&s;ulting Phy&s;ician will derive firm|ne&s;s and re&s;olution in the performance of his duty, from the &s;upport of his profe&s;&s;ional Brethren, and,
<PB N="9" REF="034356_0011_0FFC2A9FF060B848">
2dly. The great object, (the &s;afety of the City,) will be more completely obtained. The mo&s;t &s;kil|ful Phy&s;icians have been deceived re&s;pecting Con|tagion; but when &s;everal are concerned they will mo&s;t probably judge rightly.</P>

<P>That the act for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Health Office &amp;c. appears to them inadequate to &s;ome of the purpo&s;es for which it was formed, particularly as it re&s;pects
<PB N="10" REF="034356_0012_0FFC2A9C50307C48">
the communication of malignant contagious Di&s;|orders, when they appear in the city.</P>
<P>Among&s;t tho&s;e which require mo&s;t of your Legi|&s;lative attention, is that fatal di&s;ea&s;e commonly called the Yellow Fever.&mdash;For as that complaint is frequently prevalent in the We&s;t-Indies, it may &s;ometimes be brought to this city, notwith&s;tanding the care of the Health Officers.</P>
<P>To prevent its being communicated, when in|troduced, is therefore an important object; and al|though, it has been found to be highly contagious in Cities, yet, from the Hi&s;tory of the Plague and other Contagious Di&s;orders, there is rea&s;on to be|lieve, that, by proper exertions, it may be prevented from &s;preading when among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Exertions of this kind can only be directed, or made by per&s;ons, who, having &s;ome knowledge of the nature and effects of Contagion, are the be&s;t judges in doubtful ca&s;es; and therefore, in this re&s;|pect, the law appears to the College to be defective, as it has committed the bu&s;ine&s;s of deciding upon the removal of per&s;ons, &s;uppo&s;ed to be infected, to the con&s;ulting Phy&s;ician and two a&s;&s;ociates, who are not of the Medical Profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;whereas, in the opinion of the College, it would be mo&s;t properly entru&s;ted to that Phy&s;ician and a council of Medical Gentlemen, a majority of whom ought to determine what mea&s;ures &s;hould be pur&s;ued, when any cau&s;e of alarm may occur.</P>
<P>They believe that the great object, the &s;afety of the city, would be more completely obtained, if the con&s;ulting Phy&s;ician, and this Council, were au|thorized to direct the removal, not only of &s;uch per&s;ons as are already di&s;ea&s;ed, but of &s;uch, as from their expo&s;ure to the operation of Contagion,

are likely to become &s;o; and al&s;o if they were con&s;ulted re&s;pecting the quarantine and purification of ve&s;&s;els, and the con&s;truction and regulation of the City Ho&s;pital, which is about to be erected.</P>
<P>The College tru&s;t that the importance of the &s;ubject will be &s;ufficient apology for their addre&s;s to the Legi&s;lature; as from the ab&s;tru&s;e nature of Contagion, its effects can only be under&s;tood by tho&s;e who have &s;tudied them with attention, and the difficult bu&s;ine&s;s of preventing its propaga|tion will be mo&s;t properly committed to per&s;ons of this de&s;cription.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We have duly con&s;idered your letter of the 24th ult. and &s;hall chearfully comply with the requi&s;itions contained therein.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ures to be pur&s;ued for purifying the city from any latent infection, are &s;uch as we have here|tofore recommended, viz.&mdash;A &s;trict attention to cleanline&s;s, wa&s;hing, white-wa&s;hing, and ventila|ting the infected hou&s;es, bedding and cloathing; and fumigating them with charcoal and &s;ulphur, or

a mixture of oil of vitriol and &s;alt-petre. The&s;e, with the fro&s;t, we believe, will be found &s;ufficient entirely to de&s;troy any latent contagion.</P>
<P>But the latter part of your enquiry, viz. What precautions are be&s;t calculated to guard again&s;t the future occurrence of a &s;imilar calamity, is an object of &s;uch magnitude, as to demand a more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> reply.</P>
<P>We have, on former occa&s;ions, communicated our &s;entiments on this head; but as you now inform us, that it is intended to e&s;tabli&s;h a foundation for future regulations, we willingly enter into the detail; and though this will principally con&s;i&s;t of repetition, yet it may be u&s;eful to have our ideas pre&s;ented in one view for your con&s;ideration. And as the&s;e &s;en|timents have been more fully confirmed by recent events, we are again induced earne&s;tly to recommend a &s;trict adoption of the mea&s;ures we advi&s;ed in our communication of Augu&s;t 18th, 1797, as being the be&s;t calculated to guard again&s;t the future introduc|tion of contagious di&s;ea&s;es. We now recapitulate tho&s;e advices with &s;ome additions.</P>
<P>Let an entire new health-law, be made, con&s;ti|tuting a Board of Health, to con&s;i&s;t of five per&s;ons, two of whom to be practitioners of phy&s;ic. The &s;mallne&s;s of the number will en&s;ure re&s;pon&s;ibility, and a con&s;tant re&s;idence in the city; and the pro|fe&s;&s;ional knowledge of the medical characters will be nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t in directing the mea&s;ures of the Board. Let no per&s;on who&s;e private interest may be affected by quarantine laws, be a member of this Board.</P>
<P>Let a &s;ufficient &s;um of money, per annum, be &s;ub|ject to the draughts of the Board, who &s;hall render to

<P>Let the puni&s;hment of a ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el, who evades the law, by landing cargo, crew or pa&s;&s;en|gers, contrary to the intent and meaning of it, be the &s;ame as for murder of the &s;econd degree. Let no ve&s;&s;el of war ever to be allowed to come above the Fort.</P>

<HEAD>To the Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the Commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvania, the Memorial of the College of Phy&s;icians of Philadelphia re&s;pectfully repre|&s;ents:</HEAD>
<P>That your Memoriali&s;ts, deeply affected with the calamities produced by the di&s;ea&s;e which has recently occurred among&s;t us, are impelled by a &s;en&s;e of duty to their fellow-citizens and them&s;elves, to inform you, that they con&s;ider the laws which were enacted for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving this city
<PB N="28" REF="034356_0030_0FFC2A59AE6A1C50">
from Malignant, Contagious, Di&s;orders, as very imperfect.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject being of immen&s;e importance, they hope to be excu&s;ed for &s;tating their &s;entiments with re&s;pect to it, at large.</P>
<P>They are of opinion, that the di&s;ea&s;e which pro|duced &s;o much mortality and di&s;tre&s;s in the year 1793, was imported into this city from the We&s;t-Indies; and they are confirmed in this &s;entiment, by the circum&s;tances attending the di&s;ea&s;e of this year, which they con&s;ider as of the &s;ame nature, and derived from the &s;ame &s;ource.</P>
<P>Some of their mo&s;t important rea&s;ons for this opinion, are as follow:&mdash;The di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion is e&s;&s;entially different from the fevers that occur in this climate, and which originate from dome&s;tic cau&s;es. This difference particularly regards the general pro|gre&s;s of the &s;ymptoms, and the mortality, as is evi|dent upon a compari&s;on of its hi&s;tory with that of the ordinary di&s;ea&s;es of this city.</P>
<P>A di&s;ea&s;e which re&s;embles the fever of 1793 and of this year, in many important points, has long been known in the We&s;t-Indies, and tho&s;e parts of America &s;ituated between the tropics; and in &s;even or eight different in&s;tances in which a &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;e has occurred in the United States, in the cour&s;e of this century, there is good rea&s;on to be|lieve that it was derived from tho&s;e countries. In mo&s;t of the in&s;tances, the original hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e contains the information that it was im|ported. In &s;ome ca&s;es, the infection can be traced to the imported clothing of per&s;ons who died in the We&s;t-Indies. In mo&s;t of the ca&s;es where the importation cannot be a&s;certained, the fir&s;t appear|ance of the di&s;ea&s;e has been, as in the other in|&s;tances,
<PB N="29" REF="034356_0031_0FFC2A54B2D45440">
in the neighbourhood of the &s;hipping, or among per&s;ons connected with ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tances attending the fever of this year are extremely in point; and the narrative which accompanies this, will, we tru&s;t, &s;atisfy you that it was imported.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, commences invariably in our &s;ea-ports, while inland towns, equally expo&s;ed to the ordinary cau&s;es of fever, e&s;cape; and in the two la&s;t in&s;tances of its occurrence in Philadelphia, the &s;uburbs and the country adjacent, were more healthy than u&s;ual at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on; and at the commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e, all the parts of the city, excepting the &s;mall &s;paces to which it was confined, were remarkably healthy.</P>
<P>It exi&s;ts in the We&s;t-Indies, particularly in time of war, when great numbers of &s;trangers are to be found there; and reference to dates will &s;hew, that in mo&s;t of the in&s;tances of the occurrence of the di&s;ea&s;e in the United States, there has been war in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Your Memoriali&s;ts are aware, that ca&s;es may be adduced where the di&s;ea&s;e has occurred in per&s;ons, who were not known to have been expo&s;ed to imported contagion: but &s;uch is the &s;ubtile nature of this power, that it often exi&s;ts un&s;u&s;pected and &s;imilar difficulties occur re&s;pecting the &s;mall-pox, and other contagion, allowed by all to be of foreign origin. There al&s;o occur, although very rarely, &s;olitary ca&s;es of malignant remitting fevers, the &s;ymptoms of which re&s;emble &s;o much the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, that they are often &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame; but there is this e&s;&s;ential difference, that a malignant remittent fever has never been to our knowledge contagious in this climate.</P>
<P>The difference of &s;entiments among phy&s;icians, now &s;o much regretted, re&s;embles that which almo&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="034356_0032_0FFC2A49EBE77C98">
always takes place, when the plague is introduced into any of the civilized parts of Europe, where it is not well known. The identity of the di&s;ea&s;e, its origin and its contagious nature have been of|ten the &s;ubject of controver&s;y. Some phy&s;icians have con&s;idered it as of dome&s;tic origin; but proper health laws, &s;trictly enforced, have latterly protected the commercial parts of Europe from its ravages.</P>
<P>With the&s;e &s;entiments of the nature of the di&s;|ea&s;e, your memoriali&s;ts cannot but regard a proper law re&s;pecting the &s;ubject, as a matter of the great|e&s;t importance, and although they are perfectly &s;en&s;ible of the imperfection of the &s;cience of me|dicine, yet from a conviction that phy&s;icians are the be&s;t informed, as well as the mo&s;t intere&s;ted in the &s;ubject, they approach you with that re&s;pect which is due to your legi&s;lative authority, and declare their belief, that the exi&s;ting health laws of this commonwealth are not &s;uch as are be&s;t calculated to obtain the de&s;ired end, and that they ought to be improved.</P>
<P>Having lately communicated in writing to the governor their ideas re&s;pecting the be&s;t methods of preventing the introduction of contagious di&s;ea&s;es, they beg leave to refer you to that communication. At the &s;ame time they tender you their profe&s;&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;tance in framing an efficient law for this pur|po&s;e; and thus having performed their duty, they hold them&s;elves di&s;charged from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll re&s;pon&s;ibility, on account of the evils which may ari&s;e from the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of the legi&s;lative arrange|ments re&s;pecting this important &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>Narrative of Facts relative to the probable Origin, and Progre&s;s, of the Malignant Contagious Fever which lately appeared at the junction of Penn and Pine Streets.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;hip Arethu&s;a, Captain Keith, &s;ailed about June 1, 1797, from Port Royal in Jamaica for the Havannah, with &s;laves; during the pa&s;&s;age two men died with a fever, which Mr. Stephen King&s;ton, a gentleman of this city, who was a pa&s;&s;enger on board, and has frequently &s;een the di&s;ea&s;e, believes to have been the Yellow Fever, one having the black vomit. After remaining &s;ome days at the Havannah, the ve&s;&s;el proceeded for Philadelphia, and arrived in the &s;tream oppo&s;ite to Pine Street, July 23, 1797. At the capes of Delaware &s;he took on board a Pilot, and performed a quarantine of five days at State I&s;land. The Pilot was attacked with a fever the day of their arrival at the city, and went on &s;hore the &s;ame day, when he was vi&s;ited by Dr. Currie, who has been much conver&s;ant with the Yellow Fever, and was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the re&s;em|blance of his &s;ymptoms to tho&s;e of that di&s;ea&s;e, that he mentioned the ca&s;e as &s;u&s;picious to one of his friends.</P>
<P>The Arethu&s;a was moored at Mr. Jo&s;eph Ru&s;&s;ell's wharf, out&s;ide of two ve&s;&s;els which lay there when &s;he arrived, her crew left her immediately after &s;he was moored, and the next day, returned for their cloathing, &amp;c. when they cro&s;&s;ed and recro&s;&s;ed the above mentioned &s;hips. Two boys only and the captain (who was on board occa&s;ionally) compo&s;ed the crew of the outermo&s;t &s;hip, or that immediately
<PB N="32" REF="034356_0034_0FFC2A44425B16A0">
contiguous to the Arethu&s;a; but the innermo&s;t ve&s;&s;el, the Brig Iris from Oporto, had a crew of the u&s;ual number. On the twenty ninth day of July, five men of this crew were taken ill with fever, and at|tended by Dr. J. Stuart, who &s;tates, in his report to the College of Phy&s;icians, that the &s;ymptoms were &s;imilar in all, tho' varying in the degree of vio|lence; four of the&s;e recovered, but one died with unequivocal marks of the malignant yellow fever. A &s;ervant of George Latimer, E&s;q. who lived about 100 yards to the north of this ve&s;&s;el, and was fre|quently on the wharves, was attacked, July 30, with a fever which was highly contagious and ma|lignant, of which he died in five days.</P>
<P>Mr. N. Lewis, who kept a compting room about the &s;ame di&s;tance from the Arethu&s;a, was attacked about the &s;ame time, and died al&s;o in five days, of a fever which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>Mr. Dominick Joyce, who was much engaged on board a &s;hip near the Arethu&s;a, was attacked, Augu&s;t 3d, with a fever of the &s;ame kind, but re|covered. A man who lived in a &s;tore on the South &s;ide of Pine Street, about 150 yards from the river, was attacked with a malignant fever about this time, and died in a few days.</P>
<P>About the &s;ixth of Augu&s;t, Mr. Fergu&s;on, who&s;e yard adjoined the wharf where the Arethu&s;a and Iris lay, was attacked with a malignant fever, and the &s;ame day Mr. John Plankinhorn's girl, who lived nearly oppo&s;ite to Mr. Fergu&s;on's acro&s;s Penn Street, and worked in a yard which was &s;ituated very near to the above mentioned &s;tore in Pine &s;treet, was al&s;o attacked with fever, they both died on the fifth or &s;ixth day after the attack, Mrs. Fergu&s;on with very &s;u&s;picious, and Mr. Plankinhorn's girl, with
<PB N="33" REF="034356_0035_0FFC2A40294425E0" MS="y">
compleat and unequivocal &s;ymptoms of the yellow fever. In this manner the di&s;ea&s;e continued to &s;pread, &s;o that by the middle of Augu&s;t, or within three weeks from the arrival of the Arethu&s;a, above ten per&s;ons had died, who either lived or were en|gaged in bu&s;ine&s;s within 300 yards of the Arethu&s;a, and this at a time when the other parts of the city were &s;o healthy, that it is probable all the other deaths which occurred in it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> equal in number to tho&s;e which occurred in this &s;mall di&s;trict. After this the di&s;ea&s;e gradually extended it&s;elf to Southwark, and at the &s;ame time became thinly &s;cattered through the city, where its de&s;truc|tive effects are but too well known.</P>

<HEAD>Facts relative to the &s;ickly &s;tate of the Ship Hind.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears from the depo&s;itions of Francis Tow, Nicholas Ben&s;on, and William Cooper, &s;eamen on board the armed Ship Hind, taken before Chief Ju&s;tice M'Kean, that about the beginning of July 1797, the Hind &s;ailed from Port an Prince, bound to Philadelphia, with a cargo of &s;ugar and coffee, and with 43 pa&s;&s;engers; of which number 23 were whites and twenty coloured per&s;ons, that they touched at Cape Nichola Mole, where they remain|ed eight days and di&s;charged a part of their cargo, in lieu thereof taking in a quantity of &s;tone balla&s;t: during the time they lay at the Mole, the pa&s;&s;en|gers were occa&s;ionally on &s;hore. It would appear that they le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the Mole between the 12th, and 15th, of July, and arrived at this port, after a pa&s;&s;age of twenty or twenty one days. About three or four
<PB N="34" REF="034356_0036_0FFC2A3E75BD5AD0">
days after their departure from the Mole, five or &s;ix white per&s;ons and one negro of the pa&s;&s;engers were attacked with fever, the white per&s;ons &s;o at|tacked were ob&s;erved to become very yellow. During the pa&s;&s;age four other coloured per&s;ons and five of the crew fell ill of fever: one or two of the latter number, after the ve&s;&s;el entered the capes of Delaware, but only a coloured boy and child died during the pa&s;&s;age, and were thrown overboard after the ve&s;&s;el entered the river. Upon the arrival of the ve&s;&s;el oppo&s;ite the Marine Ho&s;pital, in con&s;e|quence of orders from the captain, four &s;ick per&s;ons were &s;ecreted and did not come under the in&s;pection of the Phy&s;ician of the Port; exclu&s;ive of the&s;e, two women were &s;ick in the cabin. After pa&s;&s;ing the Fort one of the &s;eamen was taken ill, went on &s;hore, and was afterwards carried to the marine Ho&s;pital; and two other per&s;ons were taken on &s;hore &s;ick. So far go the depo&s;itions.</P>
<P>From information obtained from the Health Of|fice, it appears, that the Hind was examined at the Fort on the &s;econd, and arrived at Philadelphia on the fourth of Augu&s;t; and that Mr. Doughty, one of the In&s;pectors of the Health Office, &s;ent to the marine Ho&s;pital on the 13th of Augu&s;t, Peter Ma|lo&s;io, one of the crew of the Hind then re&s;iding in Love Lane, and on the 14th, a Portugue&s;e from near the junction of Penn and South Streets, who had been landed there; and that another per&s;on was &s;ick of a &s;u&s;picious fever at Mrs. O'Connors in Al|mond near Front Street. Both the&s;e were from on board the Hind, and the Portugue&s;e abovemention|ed had been vi&s;ited by Dr. Currie, who declares his di&s;ea&s;e to have been Yellow Fever.</P>

<HEAD>Letter from Dr. James Stuart, to the College of Phy&s;icians of Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<P>When you con&s;ider the welfare of the citizens of this city, and the danger attendant on the con|cealment of the appearance of contagious di&s;ea&s;es, I tru&s;t any apology for the following communica|tion will be con&s;idered &s;uperfluous and unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>On the 29th of July la&s;t, I was called upon to vi&s;it James Hood mariner, belonging to the Brig Iris, Captain Rhodes, lately from Oporto, then lying at Nixon's Wharf (occupied by Me&s;&s;rs. Whar|ton and Palmer.) He was taken in the forenoon of the &s;ame day, on board with drow&s;ine&s;s, &s;ome &s;tupor, &s;ighing, light but frequent chills, and pain in his loins and head. The pain in his loins he repre&s;ented as though he felt &s;omething tearing from his back; to the&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;ucceeded a violent attack of Fever, in which &s;tate I found him about four o'clock in the afternoon of the &s;ame day; &s;till complaining of the mo&s;t excruciating pain in the head and back, with a burning &s;en&s;ation in the &s;tomach; inflamed eyes, flu&s;hed face, his tongue white on the fore part, but more dark towards the pharynx, and very dry, a little incoherent at times in conver&s;ation, his pul&s;e very &s;trong and ten&s;e&mdash;he lo&s;t by my direction &s;ixteen ounces of blood from the arm with evident relief. I pre|&s;cribed a &s;cruple of jalap with ten grains of calo|mel. On the 30th I found the powder had pro|duced &s;everal &s;tools exhibiting a very dark colour, but in no way particularly foetid&mdash;his pains had
<PB N="36" REF="034356_0038_0FFC2A39D07E6598">
much abated, but the fever continued, with &s;trength and ten&s;ion of the arteries; he lo&s;t twelve ounces of blood, and the purge was repeated. 31&s;t, He had a very re&s;tle&s;s night, had not taken the powder; &s;ymptoms much the &s;ame as the day before; di|rected the &s;ame purge to be given in my pre|&s;ence. Augu&s;t 1&s;t, the powder, as I was informed, was ejected by vomiting&mdash;the pupils were con&s;i|derably dilated; he had a &s;light delirium with great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, oppre&s;&s;ion, and pain in the brea&s;t, with &s;till a ten&s;e pul&s;e. A bli&s;ter was applied to his brea&s;t and &s;tomach&mdash;I ordered an injection to be thrown up, and after a &s;tool &s;hould have been procured, to give five grains of calomel every third hour; he took two do&s;es without effect, and re|fu&s;ed to repeat them. On the morning of the 2d, I found the difficulty of breathing much relieved, and the other violent &s;ymptoms in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated; but a &s;mall diarrhoea attended, with dark &s;tools, in&s;omuch that he and the attendants &s;up|po&s;ed it to be blood, but upon examination it was di&s;covered to be of a very dark green colour, ex|hibiting the appearance of vi&s;cid bile&mdash;I directed a continuation of the powders&mdash;about &s;ix o'clock in the evening he had not taken any of the pow|ders, had been attacked with a chill, was very yellow, (which was taken notice of by his attendants) his fever had become more violent, accompanied with an increa&s;e of delirium, his pul&s;e &s;till ten&s;e. Whil&s;t &s;itting by his bed he vomited up a &s;mall quantity of black bile&mdash;took ten ounces more of blood from the arm, which appeared different from what had been taken at the fir&s;t bleedings, in being bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y, whereas that taken before had appeared dark with|out a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eparate, &s;treaked with red&mdash;

I ordered bli&s;ters to his wri&s;ts, legs, and brea&s;t, and to take five grains of volatile alkali every hour&mdash;Cold clammy &s;weats now came on with &s;ingul|tus, and he expired at twelve o'clock this day, being the fifth from that on which he was taken.</P>
<P>It is a circum&s;tance worthy of remark, that four of the &s;ame crew were taken on the &s;ame day with &s;imilar &s;ymptoms, (except in degree and one nearly in the &s;ame degree at the fir&s;t aggre&s;s) all of whom, being more conformable in taking medicines as di|rected, recovered on the third and fourth day; and another who was taken on the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, re|covered on the &s;eventh&mdash;a particular detail of each ca&s;e, with the particular remedies employed, if re|quired, will be given, when time and opportunity will permit, by Gentlemen,</P>
