<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE general de&s;ign of the&s;e pages is to offer &s;ome cur&s;ory remarks on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of religion among a great part of the polite and the fa&s;hionable; not only among that de&s;cription of per|&s;ons who, whether from di&s;belief, or whatever other cau&s;e, avowedly neglect the duties of Chri&s;tianity; but among
<PB N="2" REF="025845_0008_0FCF414657ED1770">
that more decent cla&s;s al&s;o, who, while they acknowledge their belief of its truth by a public profe&s;&s;ion, and are not inat|tentive to any of its forms, yet exhibit little of its &s;pirit in their general temper and conduct: to &s;hew that Chri&s;tianity, like its divine Author, is not only <HI>denied</HI> by tho&s;e who in words di&s;own their &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to its authority; but <HI>betrayed</HI> by &s;till more treacherous di&s;ciples, even while they &s;ay, <HI>Hail, Ma&s;ter!</HI></P>
<P>For this vi&s;ible declen&s;ion of piety va|rious rea&s;ons have been a&s;&s;igned, &s;ome of which however do not &s;eem fully adequate to the effects a&s;cribed to them. The author of a late popular pamphlet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hints to an A&s;&s;ociation, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> has accounted for the increa&s;ed profliga|cy of the <HI>common people,</HI> by a&s;cribing it, very ju&s;tly, to the increa&s;ed di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of their &s;uperiors: and who will deny that the general conduct of high and
<PB N="3" REF="025845_0009_0FCF414E2D86A1F0">
low, receives a deep tincture of depra|vity from the growing neglect of public wor&s;hip? I mu&s;t however take the liber|ty to di&s;&s;ent from his opinion as to the cau&s;e of that neglect; and to &s;u&s;pect that the too common de&s;ertion of per|&s;ons of rank from the &s;ervice of the E&s;ta|bli&s;hment is not occa&s;ioned, in general by their di&s;approbation of the Liturgy; but that the far greater part of them are deterred from going to church, by mo|tives far removed from &s;peculative ob|jections and con&s;cientious &s;cruples.</P>
<P>Far be it from me to enter the un|plea&s;ant and boundle&s;s fields of contro|ver&s;y; an enterpri&s;e for which it would be hard to &s;ay whether I have le&s;s ability or inclination. Far be it from me to &s;tand forth the fierce champion of a Li|turgy, or the prejudiced advocate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> forms and &s;y&s;tems. A &s;incere member of the E&s;tabli&s;hment my&s;elf, I re&s;pect
<PB N="4" REF="025845_0010_0FCF414FAA693D20">
its in&s;titutions without idolatry, and acknowledge its imperfections without palliation.</P>
<P>But the difference of opinion here in|timated is not &s;o much about the Liturgy it&s;elf, as its imagined effects in thinning the pews of our people of fa&s;hion. The &s;lighte&s;t degree of ob&s;ervation &s;eems to contradict this a&s;&s;ertion: tho&s;e however who maintain the other opinion may &s;a|tisfy their doubts, by enquiring whether the regular and &s;y&s;tematic ab&s;enters from the church are chiefly to be found among the thinking, the reading, the &s;peculative, and the &s;crupulous part of mankind.</P>
<P>Even the mo&s;t negligent attendant on public wor&s;hip mu&s;t know, that the ob|noxious creed, to who&s;e malignant po|tency this general de&s;ertion is a&s;cribed, is never read above three or four Sun|days in the year; and that does not &s;eem
<PB N="5" REF="025845_0011_0FCF4151E1F2A4B0">
a very adequate rea&s;on for bani&s;hing the mo&s;t &s;crupulous and tender con&s;ciences from church on the other eight-and-for|ty Sundays.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is one te&s;t which is ab|&s;olutely unequivocal&mdash;it is never read at all in the <HI>afternoon,</HI> any more than the Litany (another great &s;ource of offence); and yet, with all the&s;e multiplied rea&s;ons for their attendance, that is a &s;ea&s;on when the pews of the fa&s;hionable world are not <HI>remarkable</HI> for being crowded.</P>
<P>On the contrary, is it not pretty evi|dent that the general quarrel (with &s;ome few exceptions) of tho&s;e who habitually ab&s;ent them&s;elves from public wor&s;hip, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not with the Creed, but the Command|ments? With &s;uch, to reform the Prayer Book would go but a little way, unle&s;s the New Te&s;tament could be al&s;o abridg|ed. Cut, and pare, and prune the &s;er|vice of the Church ever &s;o much, &s;till
<PB N="6" REF="025845_0012_0FCF4153272B6B88">
Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf will be found full of formidable objections. With &s;uch ob|jectors, it would avail but little that the Church &s;hould give up her ab&s;tru&s;e creeds, unle&s;s the Bible would expunge tho&s;e rigorous laws, which not only pro|hibit &s;inful actions, but corrupt inclina|tions. And, to &s;peak hone&s;tly, I do not &s;ee how &s;uch per&s;ons as habitually in|fringe the laws of virtue and &s;obriety, and who yet are men of acute &s;agacity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cu&s;tomed on other &s;ubjects to a con&s;i|&s;tent train of rea&s;oning; who &s;ee con|&s;equences in their cau&s;es; who behold practical &s;elf-denial nece&s;&s;arily involved in the &s;incere habit of religious ob&s;er|vances&mdash;I do not &s;ee how, to &s;uch men, any doctrines reformed, any redundan|cies lopped, any ob&s;curities brightened, could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ffect this author's very benevolent and chri&s;tian wi&s;h.</P>
<P>For religious duties are often neglected, upon more con&s;i&s;tent grounds than the
<PB N="7" REF="025845_0013_0FCF41549BA750B0">
friends of religion are willing to allow. They are often di&s;continued, not as re|pugnant to the under&s;tanding, not as re|pul&s;ive to the judgment, but as ho&s;tile to a licentious life. And when a pru|dent man, after entering into a &s;olemn convention, finds that he is living in a con&s;tant breach of every article of the treaty he has engaged to ob&s;erve; one cannot much wonder at his getting out of the hearing of the heavy artillery which he knows is planted again&s;t him, and again&s;t every one who lives in an al|lowed infraction of the covenant.</P>
<P>A man of &s;en&s;e, who &s;hould acknow|ledge the truth of the doctrine, would find him&s;elf obliged to &s;ubmit to the force of the precept. It is not ea&s;y to be a comfortable &s;inner; without trying, at lea&s;t, to be a confirmed unbeliever. The &s;malle&s;t remains of faith would embitter a life of libertini&s;m; and to him who
<PB N="8" REF="025845_0014_0FCF41561697B8D0">
retains any impre&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, the wilde&s;t fe&s;tivals of intemperance will be converted into the terrifying fea&s;t of Damocles: the &s;u&s;pended &s;word may every moment fall.</P>
<P>That many a worthy nonconformi&s;t is kept out of the pale of the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment by &s;ome of the cau&s;es noticed in the pamphlet in que&s;tion, cannot be doubted; and that many candid mem|bers of that E&s;tabli&s;hment regret the cau&s;es which exclude the others, cannot be denied. But the&s;e are often &s;ober thinkers, &s;erious enquirers, con&s;cienti|ous rea&s;oners; who&s;e object is truth, and who &s;pare no pains in &s;earch of what they take to <HI>be</HI> truth. But that the &s;ame objections bani&s;h the great and the gay, is not equally evident. Thanks to the indolence and di&s;&s;ipation of the times, it is not dogmas or doctrines, it is not ab|&s;tract rea&s;oning or puzzling propo&s;itions,
<PB N="9" REF="025845_0015_0FCF415D8F999378">
it is not perplexed argument or intricate metaphy&s;ics, which can now di&s;incline from Chri&s;tianity; &s;o far from it, they cannot even allure to unbelief. Infidel|ity it&s;elf, with all that &s;trong and natu|ral bias which pa&s;&s;ion and appetite have in its favour, if it appear in the grave and &s;chola&s;tic form of &s;peculation, ar|gument, or philo&s;ophical deduction, may lie almo&s;t as quietly on the &s;helf as its mo&s;t able antagoni&s;t; and the cobwebs are almo&s;t as &s;eldom bru&s;hed from Hob|bes as from Hooker. No: prudent &s;ceptici&s;m has wi&s;ely &s;tudied the temper of the times, and &s;kilfully felt the pul&s;e of this relaxed and indolent age. It pru|dently accommodated it&s;elf to the reign|ing character, when it adopted &s;arca&s;m in&s;tead of rea&s;oning, and preferred a &s;neer to an argument. It di&s;creetly judged, that, if it would now gain pro|&s;elytes, it mu&s;t &s;hew it&s;elf under the be|witching
<PB N="10" REF="025845_0016_0FCF415FC38B64F8">
form of a profane bon mot; mu&s;t be interwoven in the texture of &s;ome amu&s;ing hi&s;tory, written with the levity of a romance, and the point and glitter of an epigram: it mu&s;t embelli&s;h the ample margin with &s;ome offen&s;ive anec|dote or impure allu&s;ion, and decorate impiety with every loo&s;e and meretrici|ous ornament of a corrupt imagination: it mu&s;t break up the old flim&s;y &s;y&s;tem in|to little mi&s;chievous aphori&s;ms, ready for practical purpo&s;es: it mu&s;t divide the rope of &s;and into little portable parcels, which the &s;hallowe&s;t wit can compre|hend, and the &s;horte&s;t memory carry a|way.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy therefore (as Unbelief, by a patent of its own creation, has lately been plea&s;ed to call it&s;elf) will not do nearly &s;o much mi&s;chief to the pre&s;ent age, as its great apo&s;tles intended: &s;ince it requires time, application, and patience

to peru&s;e the rea&s;oning veterans of the &s;ceptic &s;chool; and the&s;e are talents not now very &s;everely devoted to &s;tudy of any &s;ort, by tho&s;e who give the law to fa&s;hion; e&s;pecially &s;ince, as it was hint|ed above, the &s;ame principles may be ac|quired on cheaper terms, and the repu|tation of being philo&s;ophers obtained without the &s;acrifices of plea&s;ure for the &s;everities of &s;tudy; &s;ince the indu|&s;try of our literary chemi&s;ts has extract|ed the &s;pirit from the gro&s;s &s;ub&s;tance of the old unvendible poi&s;on, and exhibited it in the volatile e&s;&s;ence of a few &s;prightly &s;ayings.</P>
<P>If therefore, in this voluptuous age, when a frivolous and relaxing di&s;&s;ipation has infected our very &s;tudies, infidelity will not be at the pains of deep re&s;earch and elaborate inve&s;tigation, even on &s;uch &s;ubjects as are congenial to its affecti|ons, it is vain to expect that chri&s;tianity
<PB N="12" REF="025845_0018_0FCF4162E24E3230">
will be more engaging, either as an ob|ject of &s;peculation, or a rule of practice, when its evidences require attention to be comprehended, its doctrines humili|ty to be received, and its precepts &s;elf-denial to be embraced.</P>
<P>Will it then be uncharitable to pro|nounce, that the leading evil, not which thins our churches (for that is not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vil I propo&s;e to con&s;ider) but which per|vades our whole character, and gives the colour to our general conduct, is <HI>practical irreligion?</HI> an irreligion not &s;o much op|po&s;ed to a &s;peculative faith, as to that &s;pirit, temper, and behaviour which chri&s;|tianity inculcates.</P>
<P>On this practical irreligion it is pro|po&s;ed to offer a few hints. After at|tempting to &s;hew, by a compari&s;on with the religion of the great in preceding ages, that there is a vi&s;ible decline of piety
<PB N="13" REF="025845_0019_0FCF416477E60B18">
among the higher ranks&mdash;that even tho&s;e more liberal &s;pirits who neglect not many of the great duties of benevolence, yet hold the &s;everal obligations of piety in no e&s;teem&mdash;I &s;hall proceed, to remark on the notorious <HI>effects</HI> of the decay of this religious principle, as it corrupts our mode of education, infects our do|me&s;tic conduct, &s;preads the contagion downwards among &s;ervants and inferi|ors, and influences our manners, habits&punc; and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>But what it is here propo&s;ed princi|pally to in&s;i&s;t on is, that this defect of religious principles is almo&s;t equally fa|tal, whether it appear in the open con|tempt of all &s;acred in&s;titutions, or under the more decent veil of external ob&s;er|vances, un&s;upported by &s;uch a conduct as is analogous to the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="025845_0020_0FCF4165DAE9B5A0">
I &s;hall proceed with a few remarks on a third cla&s;s of fa&s;hionable characters, who profe&s;s to acknowledge chri&s;tianity as a perfect &s;y&s;tem of morals, while they deny its divine authority: and conclude with &s;ome &s;light animadver&s;ions on the opinion which the&s;e maintain, that mo|rality is the whole of religion.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, that manners and principles act reciprocally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> each other; and are, by turns, cau&s;e and effect.

<HEAD>Decline of chri&s;tianity &s;hewn by a compara|tive view of the religion of the great in preceding ages.</HEAD>
<P>IF the general po&s;ition of this little tract be allowed, namely, that religion is at pre&s;ent in no very flouri&s;hing &s;tate among tho&s;e, who&s;e example, from the high ground on which they &s;tand, guides and governs the re&s;t of mankind: it will not be denied by tho&s;e, who are ever &s;o &s;uperfi|cially acquainted with the hi&s;tory of our country, that this has not always been the ca&s;e.

&mdash;that there has been a <HI>moral revo|lution</HI> in the national manners and prin|ciples, very little analogous to that great <HI>political</HI> one of which we hear &s;o much; that our public virtue bears little propor|tion to our public ble&s;&s;ings, and that our religion had decrea&s;ed in a pretty ex|act proportion to our having &s;ecured the means of enjoying it.</P>
<P>That the antipodes to wrong are hard|ly ever right, was very &s;trikingly illu&s;|trated about the middle of the la&s;t cen|tury, when the fiery and indi&s;creet, zeal of one party was made a pretext for the profligate impiety of the other; who, to the bad principle which dictated a de|praved conduct, added the bad ta&s;te of being proud of it:&mdash;when even the lea&s;t abandoned were ab&s;urdly apprehen&s;ive that an appearance of decency might &s;ubject them to the charge of fanatici&s;m, a charge in which they took care to in|volve

<HEAD>CHAPTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Benevolence allowed to be the reigning virtue, but not exclu&s;ively the virtue of the pre&s;ent age. Benevolence not the whole of religi|on, though one of its mo&s;t characteri&s;tic features. Whether benevolence proceed from a religious principle, will be more infallibly known by the general di&s;po&s;ition of time, fortune, and the common habits of life, than from a few occa&s;ional acts of bounty.</HEAD>
<P>TO all the remon&s;trances and in|vectives of the preceding chapter, there will not fail to be oppo&s;ed that which we hear every day &s;o loudly in&s;i&s;ted on&mdash;the decided &s;uperiority of the pre&s;ent age, in other and better re&s;pects. It will be &s;aid, that even tho&s;e who neg|lect the outward forms of religion, ex|hibit however the be&s;t proofs of the be&s;t
<PB N="27" REF="025845_0033_0FCF41849D0DAAF8">
principles; that the unparalleled in|&s;tances of charity, of which we are continual witne&s;&s;es; that the many &s;trik|ing acts of public bounty, and the vari|ous new and noble improvements in this &s;hining virtue, ju&s;tly entitle the pre&s;ent age to be called, by way of eminence, <HI>the age of benevolence.</HI></P>
<P>It is with the livelie&s;t joy I acknow|ledge the delightful truth. Liberality flows with a full tide through a thou|&s;and channels. There is &s;carcely a new&s;|paper but records &s;ome meeting of men of fortune for the mo&s;t &s;alutary purpo&s;es. The noble and numberle&s;s &s;tructures for the relief of di&s;tre&s;s, which are the ornament and the glory of our metropo|lis, proclaim a &s;pecies of munificence unknown to former ages. Sub&s;criptions, not only to ho&s;pitals, but to various other valuable in&s;titutions, are obtained almo&s;t as &s;oon as &s;olicited. And who
<PB N="28" REF="025845_0034_0FCF418785B84B60">
but mu&s;t wi&s;h that the&s;e beautiful mo|numents of benevolence may become every day more numerous, and more extended.</P>
<P>Yet with all the&s;e allowed and ob|vious excellencies, it is not quite clear whether &s;omething too much has not been &s;aid of the liberality of the pre&s;ent age, in a comparative view with that of tho&s;e ages which preceded it. A gene|ral alteration of habits and manners has at the &s;ame time multiplied public boun|ties and private di&s;tre&s;s; and it is &s;carce|ly a paradox to &s;ay, that there was probably le&s;s mi&s;ery when there was le&s;s munificence.</P>
<P>If an increa&s;ed benevolence now ranges through, and relieves a wider compa&s;s of di&s;tre&s;s; yet &s;till, if tho&s;e examples of luxury and di&s;&s;ipation which promote that di&s;tre&s;s, are &s;till <HI>more</HI> in|crea&s;ed,
<PB N="29" REF="025845_0035_0FCF4189160056E8">
this makes the good done bear little proportion to the evil promoted. If the mi&s;eries removed by the growth of charity fall, both in number and weight, far below tho&s;e which are cau&s;|ed by the growth of vice and di&s;order; if we find, that though bounty is extend|ed, yet, that tho&s;e corruptions which make bounty &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, are extended al&s;o, almo&s;t beyond calculation; if it appear that, though more objects are relieved by our money, yet incompara|bly more are debauched by our licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;the balance perhaps will not turn out &s;o decidedly in favour of the times as we are willing to imagine.</P>
<P>If then the mo&s;t valuable &s;pecies of charity is that which prevents di&s;tre&s;s by preventing or le&s;&s;ening vice, the great|e&s;t and mo&s;t inevitable cau&s;e of want; we ought not &s;o highly to exalt the bounty of the great in the pre&s;ent day,

in preference to that broad &s;hade of pro|tection, patronage, and maintenance, which the wide-&s;pread bounty of their forefathers &s;tretched out over whole villages, I had almo&s;t &s;aid whole pro|vinces.

prevented that di&s;tre&s;s, which it mu&s;t however be thankfully confe&s;&s;ed it is the laudable object of modern bounty to re|lieve. A man of fortune might not then, it is true, &s;o often dine in public, for the benefit of the poor; but the poor were more regularly and comfortably fed with the abundant crumbs which then fell from the rich man's table. Whereas it cannot be denied that the prevailing mode of living has pared real ho&s;pitality to the very quick: and, though the re|mark may be thought ridiculous, it is a material di&s;advantage to the poor, that the introduction of the modern &s;tyle of luxury has rendered the remains of the mo&s;t co&s;tly table but of &s;mall value.</P>
<P>But even allowing the boa&s;ted &s;uperi|ority of modern benevolence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it will not be incon&s;i&s;tent with the object of the pre&s;ent de&s;ign, to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">re whether the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;ion of this branch of charity,

though the mo&s;t lovely offspring of reli|gion, be yet any po&s;itive proof of the prevalence of religious principles: and whether it is not the fa&s;hion rather to con&s;ider benevolence as a &s;ub&s;titute for chri&s;tianity, than as an evidence of it.</P>
<P>For it &s;eems to be one of the reigning errors among the better &s;ort, to reduce all religion into benevolence, and all benevolence into alms-giving. The wide and comprehen&s;ive idea of chri&s;tian cha|rity is compre&s;&s;ed into the &s;lender com|pa&s;s of a little pecuniary relief. This &s;pecies of benevolence is indeed a bright gem among the ornaments of a chri&s;tian; but by no means furni&s;hes all the jewels of his crown, which derives its lu&s;tre from the a&s;&s;ociated radiance of every chri&s;tian grace. Be&s;ides, the genuine virtues are all of the &s;ame family; and it is only by being &s;een in company with each other, and with Piety their com|mon
<PB N="33" REF="025845_0039_0FCF419235E001E8">
parent, that they are certainly known to be legitimate, for there are &s;uch things as even &s;purious virtues.</P>
<P>But is this the property of the <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> virtues, that, like all other amiable mem|bers of the &s;ame family, while each is doing its own particular duty, it is con|tributing to the pro&s;perity of the re&s;t; and the larger the family the better they live together, as no one can advance it|&s;elf without labouring for the advance|ment of the whole: thus, no man can be benevolent on chri&s;tian principles, without &s;elf-denial; and &s;o of the other virtues: each is connected with &s;ome other, and all with religion.</P>
<P>I already anticipate the obvious and hackneyed reply, that "whoever be the in&s;trument, and whatever be the motive of bounty, &s;till the poor are equally re|lieved, and therefore the end is the &s;ame." And it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that tho&s;e
<PB N="34" REF="025845_0040_0FCF419641DBA1B8">
compa&s;&s;ionate hearts, who cannot but be earne&s;tly anxious that the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;hould be relieved at any rate, &s;hould not too &s;crupulou&s;ly enquire into any cau&s;e of which the effect is &s;o benefici|al. Nor indeed will candour &s;crutinize too curiou&s;ly into the errors of any life, of which benevolence will always be al|lowed to be a &s;hining ornament, while it does not pretend to be an atoning vir|tue.</P>
<P>Let me not be mi&s;repre&s;ented, as if I were &s;eeking to detract from the value of this amiable feeling; one does not &s;urely lower the practice by &s;eeking to ennoble the principle; the action will not be impaired by mending the motive: and no one will be likely to give the poor le&s;s, becau&s;e he &s;eeks to plea&s;e God more.</P>
<P>One cannot then help wi&s;hing that pecuniary bounty were not only practi&s;|ed,
<PB N="35" REF="025845_0041_0FCF419938F09960">
but &s;ometimes enjoined too, as a redeeming virtue. In many conver&s;a|tions, I had almo&s;t &s;aid in many chari|ty &s;ermons, it is in&s;inuated as if a little alms-giving could pay off old &s;cores con|tracted by favourite indulgences. This, though often done by well-meaning men to advance the intere&s;ts of &s;ome pre&s;ent pious purpo&s;e, yet has the mi&s;chievous effect of tho&s;e medicines which, while they may relieve a local complaint, are yet undermining the general habit.</P>
<P>That great numbers who are not in|fluenced by &s;o high a principle as chri&s;|tianity holds out, are yet truly com|pa&s;&s;ionate, without hypocri&s;y, and with|out o&s;tentation, who can doubt? &s;ince there are by nature many tender hearts; for did not God make them? and is he not the Author of all that is good in nature, as well as in grace.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="025845_0042_0FCF419C81830620">
But who that feels the beauty of be|nevolence, can avoid being &s;olicitous, not only that its offerings &s;hould com|fort the receiver, but return in ble&s;&s;ings to the bo&s;om of the giver, by &s;pringing from &s;uch motives, and being accompa|nied by &s;uch a temper as &s;hall redound to his eternal good? For that the bene|fit is the &s;ame to the object, whatever be the character of the benefactor, is but an uncomfortable view of things to a real chri&s;tian, who&s;e compa&s;&s;ion reach|es to the &s;ouls of men.

<P>For as religion is not, on the one hand, merely an opinion or a &s;entiment; &s;o neither is it, on the other, merely an
<PB N="37" REF="025845_0043_0FCF419D6157B888">
act or a performance, but it is a di&s;po|&s;ition, a habit, a temper: it is not a name, but a nature: it is a turning the whole mind to God; a concentration of all the powers and affections of the &s;oul in|to one &s;teady point, an uniform de&s;ire to plea&s;e <HI>Him.</HI> This de&s;ire will naturally and nece&s;&s;arily manife&s;t it&s;elf, in our doing all the good we can to our fellow-creatures in every po&s;&s;ible way; for it will be found that neither of the two parts into which practical religion is di|vided, can be performed with any degree of perfection but by tho&s;e who unite both: as it may be que&s;tioned if any man really <HI>does</HI> <Q>love his neighbour as him&s;elf,</Q> who does not fir&s;t endeavour to "love God with all his heart." As genius has been defined to be &s;trong general powers of mind accidentally de|termined to &s;ome particular pur&s;uit; &s;o piety may be denominated a &s;trong ge|neral di&s;po&s;ition of the heart to every
<PB N="38" REF="025845_0044_0FCF41A27B6AB180">
thing that is right, breaking forth into every excellent action, as the occa&s;ion pre&s;ents it&s;elf. The temper mu&s;t be ready in the mind, and the whole heart mu&s;t be prepared and trained to every act of virtue to which it may be called out. For religious principles are like the military exerci&s;e; they keep up an habitual &s;tate of preparation for actual &s;ervice; and by never relaxing the di&s;|cipline, the real chri&s;tian is ready for every duty to which he may be com|manded. Right actions be&s;t prove the exi&s;tence of religion in the heart; but they are evidences, not cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Whether therefore a man's charitable actions proceed from religious principle, he will be be&s;t able to a&s;certain by &s;cru|tinizing into what is the general di&s;po|&s;ition of his time and fortune; and by attending to &s;uch an habitual regulation of his plea&s;ures and expences as will en|able
<PB N="39" REF="025845_0045_0FCF41A36DC03FF0">
him to be more or le&s;s u&s;eful to others.</P>
<P>For it is in vain that he may po&s;&s;e&s;s, what is called by the courte&s;y of fa&s;hion <HI>the be&s;t heart in the world</HI> (a character we every day here applied to the liber|tine and the prodigal), if he &s;quander his time and e&s;tate in &s;uch a round of ex|travagant indulgencies, and thoughtle&s;s di&s;&s;ipation, as leaves him little money and le&s;s lei&s;ure for nobler purpo&s;es. It makes but little difference whether a man is prevented from doing good by hard|hearted par&s;imony, or an unprincipled extravagance; the &s;tream is equally cut off.</P>
<P>The mere <HI>ca&s;ual</HI> benevolence of any man can have little claim to &s;olid e&s;teem; nor does any charity de&s;erve the name which does not grow out of a &s;teady conviction that it is his bounden duty, which does not &s;pring from a &s;ettled pro|pen&s;ity
<PB N="40" REF="025845_0046_0FCF41A4E37531B8">
to obey the whole will of God; which is not therefore made a part of the general plan of his conduct; and which does not lead him to order the whole &s;cheme of his affairs with an eye to it.</P>
<P>He therefore who does not habituate him&s;elf to certain interior re&s;traints, who does not live in a regular cour&s;e of &s;elf-renunciation, will not be likely often to perform acts of beneficence, when it be|comes nece&s;&s;ary to convert to &s;uch pur|po&s;es any of that time or money which appetite, temptation or vanity &s;olicit him to divert to other purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>And &s;urely he who &s;eldom &s;acrifices one darling indulgence, who does not &s;ubtract one gratification from the ince&s;|&s;ant round of his enjoyments, when the indulgence would ob&s;truct his capacity of doing good, or when the &s;acrifice would enlarge his power, does not de|&s;erve
<PB N="41" REF="025845_0047_0FCF41A683A3BF58">
the name of benevolent. And for &s;uch an unequivocal criterion of charity to whom are we to look, but to the con|&s;cientious chri&s;tian?

<P>Now if we look around and remark the exce&s;&s;es of luxury, the co&s;tly diver|&s;ions, and the intemperate di&s;&s;ipation in which numbers of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians indulge them&s;elves, can any &s;tretch of candour, can even that tender &s;entiment by which we are enjoined "to hope" and to "believe all things," enable us to hope and believe that &s;uch are actuated by a &s;pirit of chri&s;tian benevolence, mere|ly becau&s;e we &s;ee them perform &s;ome ca&s;ual acts of charity, which the &s;pirit of the world can contrive to make ex|tremely compatible with a voluptuous

<P>Men will not believe that there is hardly any one human good quality which will know and keep its proper bounds, without the re&s;training influence of religi|ous principle. There is, for in&s;tance, great danger le&s;t a con&s;tant attention to &s;o right a practice as an invariable oecono|my &s;hould incline the heart to the love of money. Nothing can effectually counteract this natural propen&s;ity, but the chri&s;tian habit of devoting tho&s;e re|trenched expences to &s;ome good pur|po&s;e; and then oeconomy, in&s;tead of narrowing the heart, will enlarge it, by inducing a con&s;tant a&s;&s;ociation of benevo|lence with frugality. An habitual atten|tion to the wants of others, is the only whole&s;ome regulator of our own expen|ces, and carries with it a whole train of
<PB N="43" REF="025845_0049_0FCF41A95A7306D0">
virtues, di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, &s;obriety, and temperance. And tho&s;e who live in the cu&s;tom of levying con&s;tant taxes on their vanities for &s;uch purpo&s;es, &s;erve the poor &s;till le&s;s than they &s;erve them&s;elves, by cultivating &s;uch habits as make the be&s;t qualification for their final happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus when a vein of chri&s;tianity runs through the whole ma&s;s of a man's life, it gives a new value to all his actions, and a new character to all his views. It tran&s;mutes prudence and oeconomy into chri&s;tian virtues; and every offering that is pre&s;ented on the altar of charity, be|comes truly con&s;ecrated, when it is the gift of obedience, and the price of &s;elf-denial. Piety is the fire from heaven, which can alone kindle the &s;acrifice, and make it acceptable.</P>
<P>On the other hand, when any act of bounty is performed by way of compo&s;i|tion with one's Maker, either as a pur|cha&s;e,
<PB N="44" REF="025845_0050_0FCF41ABEF40E4B0">
or an expiation of unallowed in|dulgencies; though even in this ca&s;e, God (who makes all the pa&s;&s;ions of men &s;ub|&s;ervient to his good purpo&s;es) can make the gift equally beneficial to the receiv|er: yet it is &s;urely not too &s;evere to &s;ay, that to the giver &s;uch acts are an un|founded dependance, a deceitful refuge, a broken &s;taff.</P>

<P>LET not the truly &s;erious be offend|ed, as if, in the pre&s;ent chapter, which
<PB N="45" REF="025845_0051_0FCF41AF9B712198">
is intended to treat of the notorious ne|glect of religious education, I meant to confine the &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity to mere|ly mechanical effects, and to &s;uppo&s;e that piety mu&s;t be the natural and inevitable con&s;equence of early in&s;titution. To imply this, would be indeed to betray a lamentable ignorance of human nature, of the di&s;order &s;in has introduced, of the inefficacy of human means, and entirely to mi&s;take the genius of our religion. It would be to &s;uppo&s;e that God was to de|pend upon <HI>our</HI> goodne&s;s, and not upon <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be allowed that the Su|preme Being works chiefly by means; and though it is confe&s;&s;ed that no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of education, no corruption of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> can place any one out of the reach of the divine influences (for it is under &s;uch circum&s;tances, perhaps, that the mo&s;t extraordinary in&s;tances of divine grace have been manife&s;ted); yet it mu&s;t be
<PB N="46" REF="025845_0052_0FCF41B258C5D7B8">
owned, that early &s;obriety, early know|ledge of religion, and early habits of pie|ty, are the mo&s;t probable means of &s;e|curing the favour of God. To acquire the&s;e, is putting our&s;elves in the way in which he him&s;elf has told us his ble&s;&s;ing is to be found.</P>
<P>But religion is the only thing in which we &s;eem to look for the end, without making u&s;e of the means: and yet, it would not be more &s;upri&s;ing if we were to expect that our children &s;hould be|come arti&s;ts and &s;cholars, without being bred to arts and languages, than it is to look for a chri&s;tian world, without a chri&s;tian education.</P>
<P>The noble&s;t objects can yield no de|light, if there be not in the mind a di&s;po|&s;ition to enjoy them, ari&s;ing from an in|telligence of their nature, and a rever|ence for their value, which can only
<PB N="47" REF="025845_0053_0FCF41B671645D08">
&s;pring from long habit and early acquaint|ance. For to produce any capacity of enjoyment, there mu&s;t be a congruity between the mind and the object. To the mathematician demon&s;tration is plea|&s;ures; to the philo&s;opher the &s;tudy of nature; to the voluptuous the gratifica|tion of his appetite; to the poet the plea|&s;ure of his imagination. The&s;e objects they all re&s;pectively pur&s;ue as their prop|er bu&s;ine&s;s, as plea&s;ures adapted to that part of their nature which they have been accu&s;tomed to indulge and cultivate.</P>
<P>Now, as men will be apt to act con&s;i&s;t|ently with their general views and ha|bitual tendencies, would it not be ab&s;urd to expect that the philo&s;opher &s;hould look for his &s;overeign good at a ball, or the &s;en&s;uali&s;t in the plea&s;ures of intellect or piety? None of the&s;e ends are an|&s;werable to the general views of the re|&s;pective pur&s;uer; they are not corre&s;pond|ent
<PB N="48" REF="025845_0054_0FCF41B795593D90">
to his ideas; they are not commen|&s;urate to his aims. The &s;ublime&s;t plea|&s;ures can afford little gratification where a previous ta&s;te has not been cultivated. A clown, who &s;hould hear a &s;cholar or an arti&s;t talk of the delights of a library, a picture gallery, or a concert, could not gue&s;s at the nature of the plea&s;ures they afford; nor would his being introduced to them give him much clearer ideas, becau&s;e he would bring to them an eye blind to proportion, an under&s;tanding new to &s;cience, and an ear deaf to har|mony.</P>
<P>Shall we expect then, &s;ince men can only be &s;cholars by &s;edulous labour, that they &s;hall be chri&s;tians by mere chance? Shall we be &s;urpri&s;ed if tho&s;e do not ful|fil the offices of religion, who are not trained to an acquaintance with them? And will it not be obvious, that it mu&s;t be &s;ome other thing be&s;ides the ab&s;tru&s;e|ne&s;s

of creeds and opinions, which makes chri&s;tianity unfa&s;hionable?</P>
<P>For it will not probably be di&s;puted, that in no age have the pa&s;&s;ions of youth been &s;o early freed from the <HI>muzzle of re|&s;traint;</HI> in no age has the paternal au|thority been &s;o contemptuou&s;ly treated, or every &s;pecies of &s;ubordination &s;o di&s;|dainfully trampled on.

In no age has im|prudent fondne&s;s been &s;o injuriou&s;ly la|vi&s;h, or the &s;upernumerary expences of the coiledge and the &s;chool (that prolific &s;eed of corruption) been &s;o prodigally augmented. In no age have the appetites been excited by &s;uch early &s;timulants, and anticipated by &s;uch premature indul|gencies.

<P>A ta&s;te for co&s;tly, or artificial, or tu|multuous plea&s;ures cannot be gratified, by their mo&s;t &s;edulous pur&s;uers, at eve|ry moment; and what wretched manage|ment is it in the oeconomy of human hap|pine&s;s &s;o to contrive, as that the enjoy|ment &s;hall be rare and difficult, and the intervals long and languid! Whereas real and unadulterate plea&s;ures occur perpetually to him who cultivates a ta&s;te for truth and nature, and &s;cience and vir|tue. But the&s;e &s;imple and tranquil en|joyments cannot but be in&s;ipid to him, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have been prematurely excited by agitating plea&s;ures, or who&s;e ta&s;te has been depraved by &s;uch as are deba&s;ing and frivolous; for it is of more con&s;equence to virtue than &s;ome good

Why &s;hould not he too be confined, in different &s;tages of life, to certain re&s;tricted limitations? &s;ince nothing but experience &s;eems to teach him, that if he be allowed to anti|cipate his future po&s;e&s;&s;ions, and trample all the flowery fields of real, as well as imaginary and artificial enjoyment, he not only induces pre&s;ent di&s;gu&s;t, but de|faces and de&s;troys all the rich materials of his future happine&s;s; and leaves him|&s;elf, for the re&s;t of his life, nothing but ravaged fields and barren &s;tubble.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="025845_0058_0FCF41C30A37CC88">
But the great and radical defect, and that which comes more immediately within the pre&s;ent de&s;ign, &s;eems to be, that in general the characteri&s;tical prin|ciples of chri&s;tianity are not early and &s;trongly infu&s;ed into the mind: that re|ligion is rather taught incidentally, as a thing of &s;ubordinate value, than as the leading principle of human actions, and the great animating &s;pring of human con|duct. Were the high influential princi|ples of the chri&s;tian religion anxiou&s;ly and early inculcated, we &s;hould find that tho&s;e lap&s;es from virtue, to which pa&s;&s;i|on and temptation afterwards too fre|quently &s;olicit, would be more ea&s;ily re|coverable.</P>
<P>For though the evil propen&s;ities of fal|len nature, and the bewitching allure|ments of plea&s;ure, will too often &s;educe even tho&s;e of the be&s;t education into de|vious paths, yet we &s;hall find that men

will &s;eldom be <HI>incurably</HI> wicked, without that internal corruption of principle, which knows how to ju&s;tify iniquity, and confirm evil conduct, by the &s;anction of corrupt rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>The errors occa&s;ioned by the violence of pa&s;&s;ion may be reformed, but &s;y&s;tema|tic wickedne&s;s will be only fortified by time; and no decrea&s;e of &s;trength, no decay of appetite, can weaken the power of a pernicious principle.

<P>Surely it will &s;ubject no one to the imputation of bigotry or enthu&s;ia&s;m, if he venture to enquire whether the ge|nuine

<P>In this, as in various other in&s;tances, we may blu&s;h at the &s;uperiority of Pagan in&s;titution. Were the Roman youth taught to imagine them&s;elves always in the awful pre&s;ence of Cato, in order to

habituate them betimes to &s;upre&s;s ba&s;e &s;entiments, and to excite &s;uch as were generous and noble? And &s;hould not the chri&s;tian youth be continually reminded, that a greater than Cato is here? Should they not be trained to the habit of acting under the con&s;tant impre&s;&s;ion, that <HI>He</HI> to whom they mu&s;t one day be account|able for intentions, as well as words and actions, is witne&s;s to the one as well as the other; that he not only is "about their paths," but "under&s;tands their very thoughts?"</P>
<P>Were the di&s;ciples of a Pagan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pythagoras.</NOTE> lead|er taught that it was a motive &s;ufficient to compel their obedience to any rule, whether they liked it or not, that it had the authority of their teacher's name? were the bare words, <HI>the ma&s;ter hath &s;aid it,</HI> &s;ufficient to &s;ettle all di&s;putes, and
<PB N="58" REF="025845_0064_0FCF41D29FCF14E8">
to &s;ubdue all reluctance? And &s;hall the &s;chollars of a more divine teacher, who have a code of laws written by God him|&s;elf, be contented with a lower rule, or abide by a meaner authority? And is any argument drawn from human con&s;ider|ations likely to operate more forcibly on a dependant being, than that &s;imple but grand a&s;&s;ertion, with which &s;o many of the precepts of our religion are introduc|ed&mdash;Becau&s;e, THUS SAITH THE LORD?</P>
<P>For it is doing but little, in the infu|&s;ion of fir&s;t principles, to obtain the bare a&s;&s;ent of the under&s;tanding to the exi&s;t|ence of one Supreme Power, unle&s;s the heart and affections go along with the conviction, by our conceiving of that power as intimately connected with our|&s;elves. A feeling temper will be but little affected with the cold idea of a <HI>geo|metrical</HI> God, as the excellent Pa&s;cal ex|pre&s;&s;es it, who merely adju&s;ts all the
<PB N="59" REF="025845_0065_0FCF41DA5C2CEFB8">
parts of the matter, and keeps the ele|ments in order. Such a mind will be but little moved, unle&s;s he be taught to con&s;ider his Maker under the intere&s;ting and endearing repre&s;entation which re|vealed religion gives of him. That "God is," will be to him rather an a|larming than a con&s;olatory idea; till he be per&s;uaded of the &s;ub&s;equent propo&s;i|tion, that "he is the rewarder of all &s;uch as diligently &s;eek him." Nay, if natural religion does even acknowledge one awful attribute, that "God is ju&s;t;" it will only increa&s;e the terror of a ten|der con&s;cience, till he learn, from the fountain of truth, that he is, "the ju&s;ti|fier of all who believe on him."</P>
<P>But if the great &s;anctions of our reli|gion are not deeply engraven on the heart, where &s;hall we look for a more adequate curb to the fiery &s;pirit of youth? For, let the elements be ever &s;o kindly
<PB N="60" REF="025845_0066_0FCF41DBB5C7BB10">
mixed in a human compo&s;ition, let the natural temper be ever &s;o amiable, &s;till whenever a man cea&s;es to think him&s;elf an accountable, being what motive can he have for re&s;i&s;ting a &s;trong temptation to a pre&s;ent good, when he has no dread that he &s;hall thereby forfeit a greater future good?</P>
<P>But it will be objected, that this deep &s;en&s;e of religion would interfere with the general purpo&s;es of education, which is de&s;igned to qualify men for the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of human life, and not to train up a race of monks and a&s;cetics.</P>
<P>There is however &s;o little real &s;olidity in this &s;pecious objection, that I am firmly per&s;uaded, that if religious prin|ciples were more deeply impre&s;&s;ed on the heart, even the things of this world would be much better carried on. For where are we to look for &s;o much punc|tuality, diligence, application, doing eve|ry

Oeconomy of time, truth in ob&s;erving his word, never daring to deceive or to di&s;appoint&mdash;the&s;e are the very e&s;&s;ence of a man of bu&s;ine&s;s; and for the&s;e to whom &s;hall we mo&s;t natural|ly look?

In the mean time, they affect to &s;eize on benevolence with exclu&s;ive appropriation as their own cardinal virtue, and to accu&s;e of a big|otted cruelty, that narrow &s;pirit which points out the perils of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and the terrors of a future account.

It does not however &s;eem a very probable means of adding to the &s;tock of human happine&s;s, by plundering mankind of that principle, by the de&s;truction of which friend&s;hip is robbed of its bond, &s;ociety of its &s;ecu|rity, patience of its motive, morality of its foundation, integrity of its reward, &s;orrow of its con&s;olation, life of its balm, and death of its &s;upport.</P>

<P>But as the <HI>principles</HI> of chri&s;tianity are in no great repute, &s;o their concomitant

<P>While the contempt of religion was confined to wits and philo&s;ophers, the effect was not &s;o &s;en&s;ibly felt.

<P>IT is an objection frequently brought again&s;t chri&s;tianity, that if it exhibited &s;o perfect a &s;cheme, if its influences
<PB N="100" REF="025845_0106_0FCF2D76CBCB8800">
were as &s;trong, if its effects were as powerful, as its friends pretend, it mu&s;t have produced more vi&s;ible con&s;equences in the reformation of mankind. This is not the place fully to an&s;wer this objection, which, (like all the other cavils again&s;t our religion) continues to be urged ju&s;t as if it never <HI>had</HI> been an|&s;wered</P>
<P>That vice and immorality prevail in no &s;mall degree, in countries profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianity, we need not go out of our own to be convinced. But that this is the ca&s;e only becau&s;e this benign prin|ciple is not &s;uffered to operate in its full power, will be no le&s;s obvious to all who are &s;incere in their enquiries. For, if we allow (and who that examines impar|tially can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elp allowing?) that it is the natural tendency of chri&s;tianity to make men better, then it mu&s;t be the aver&s;ion to receiving it, and not the faults of the
<PB N="101" REF="025845_0107_0FCF2D7848CF3FC0">
principle, which prevents them from be|coming &s;o.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are acquainted with the effects it actually produced in the fir&s;t ages of the church, when it <HI>was</HI> receiv|ed in its genuine purity, and when it <HI>did</HI> operate without ob&s;truction, from its <HI>followers</HI> at lea&s;t, will want no other proof of its inherent power and efficacy. At that period, its mo&s;t decided and in|du&s;trious enemy, the emperor Julian, could recommend the <HI>manners</HI> of the Galileans to the imitation of his pagan high prie&s;t; though he him&s;elf, at the &s;ame time, was doing every thing which the mo&s;t inveterate malice, &s;harpened by the acute&s;t wit, and backed by the mo&s;t ab&s;olute power, could devi&s;e, to di&s;credit their doctrines.</P>
<P>Nor would the efficacy of chri&s;tianity be le&s;s vi&s;ible now, in influencing the conduct of its profe&s;&s;ors, if its princi|ples

were heartily and &s;incerely received They would operate on the conduct &s;o effectually, that we &s;hould &s;ee morals and manners growing out of principles, as &s;pontaneou&s;ly and nece&s;&s;arily as we &s;ee other con&s;equences grow out of their proper and natural cau&s;es.

If the &s;ame &s;kill and care which are employed in curing &s;ymptoms, were vigorou&s;ly levelled at the internal princi|ple of the di&s;ea&s;e, the moral health would feel the benefit.

For though even in the highe&s;t po&s;&s;i|ble exertion of religious principle, and the mo&s;t diligent practice of all its con|&s;equential train of virtues, man would &s;till find evil propen&s;ities enough, in his fallen nature, to make it nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould counteract them, by keeping alive his diligence after higher attain|ments, and to quicken his a&s;pirations af|ter a better &s;tate; yet the prevailing temper would be in general right, the will would be in a great mea&s;ure rectifi|ed; and the heart, feeling and acknow|ledging the di&s;ea&s;e, would apply it&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ligently to the only remedy.

<P>All the heavy charges which have been brought again&s;t religion, have been taken from the abu&s;es of it. In every other in&s;tance the inju&s;tice of this pro|ceeding would be notorious: but there is a general want of candour in the judgment of men on this &s;ubject, which we do not find them exerci&s;e on other occa&s;ions; that of throwing the fault of the erring or ignorant profe&s;&s;or on the profe&s;&s;ion it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It does not derogate from the honour|able profe&s;&s;ion of arms, that there are cowards and braggarts. If any man lo&s;e his e&s;tate by the chicanery of an attorney,
<PB N="105" REF="025845_0111_0FCF2D7FC4A53968">
or his health by the blunder of a phy|&s;ician, it is commonly &s;aid, that the one was a di&s;grace to his bu&s;ine&s;s, and the other was ignorant of it; but no one therefore concludes that law and phy&s;ic are contemptible profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity alone is obliged to bear all the obloquy incurred by the mi&s;con|duct of its followers; to &s;u&s;tain all the reproach excited by ignorant, by fana|tical, by &s;uper&s;titious, or hypocritical profe&s;&s;ors. But whoever accu&s;es it of a tendency to produce the errors of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, mu&s;t have picked up his opi|nion any where rather than in the New Te&s;tament, which being the only au|thentic hi&s;tory of chri&s;tianity, is that which candour would naturally con&s;ult for information.</P>
<P>But as worldly and irreligious men do not draw their notions from that pure fountain, but from the polluted &s;tream
<PB N="106" REF="025845_0112_0FCF2D846DA0F050">

difference; that the one, by making no profe&s;&s;ion, deceives neither the world, nor his own heart; while the other, by intrenching him&s;elf in forms, fancies that he does &s;omething, and thanks God that "he is not like the publican." The one only &s;huts his eyes upon the danger which the other de&s;pi&s;es.</P>
<P>But the&s;e unfruitful profe&s;&s;ors would do well to recollect, that, by a conduct &s;o little worthy of their high calling, they not only violate the law to which they have vowed obedience, but occa&s;i|on many to di&s;believe or to de&s;pi&s;e it; that they are thus in a great mea&s;ure accountable for the infidelity of others, and of cour&s;e will have to an&s;wer for more than their own per&s;onal offences.

they exhibit any thing of the <Q>beauty of holine&s;s</Q> in their daily conver&s;ation; they would then give &s;uch a demon&s;tra|tive proof, not only of the &s;incerity of their own obedience, but of the bright|ne&s;s of that divine light by which they profe&s;s to walk, that the mo&s;t deter|mined unbeliever would at la&s;t begin to think there mu&s;t be <HI>&s;omething</HI> in a religion of which the effects were &s;o vi|&s;ible, and the fruits &s;o amiable; and might in time be led to "glorify," not <HI>them,</HI> not the imperfect doers of the&s;e works, but "their Father which is in heaven." Whereas, as things are at pre&s;ent carried on, the obvious conclu|&s;ion mu&s;t be, either that chri&s;tians do not believe in the religion they profe&s;s, or that there is not truth in the religion it&s;elf.</P>

<P>This &s;wells the amount of the actual mi&s;chief beyond calculation.

<P>Few indeed of the more orderly and decent have any objection to that degree of religion which is compatible with their general acceptance with others, or the full enjoyment of their own plea&s;ures. For a formal and ceremonious exerci&s;e of the outward duties of chri&s;tianity may not only be kept up without exciting cen&s;ure, but will even procure a certain re&s;pect and confidence; and is not quite irreconcileable with a voluptuous and di&s;&s;ipated life. So far many go; and &s;o far "as godline&s;s is profitable to the life that <HI>is,"</HI> it pa&s;&s;es without reproach.</P>
<P>But as &s;oon as men begin to con&s;ider religious exerci&s;es not as a decency, but a duty; not as a commutation for a &s;elf-denying life, but as a means to promote a holy temper, and a virtuous conduct:
<PB N="118" REF="025845_0124_0FCF2D9A463E7320">
as &s;oon as they feel di&s;po&s;ed to carry the effect of their devotion into their daily life: as &s;oon as their principles di&s;cover them&s;elves, by leading them to withdraw from tho&s;e &s;cenes, and ab&s;tain from tho&s;e actions, in which the gay place their &s;u|preme happine&s;s: as &s;oon as &s;omething is to be <HI>done,</HI> and &s;omething is to be <HI>part|ed with;</HI> then the world begins to take offence, and to &s;tigmatize the <HI>activity</HI> of that piety, which had been commended as long as it remained <HI>inoperative,</HI> and had only evaporated in <HI>words.</HI></P>
<P>But when religion, like the vital prin|ciple, takes its &s;eat in the heart, and &s;ends out &s;upplies of life and heat to every part; diffu&s;es motion, &s;oul, and vigour, through the whole circulation; and informs and animates the whole man: when it operates on the practice, influences the conver&s;ation, breaks out into a lively zeal for the honour of God,

and the be&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind; then the &s;incerity, or the under&s;tanding, of that per&s;on will become que&s;tionable: and it mu&s;t be owing to a very fortunate combination of circum&s;tances indeed, if he can at once pre&s;erve the character of parts and piety.</P>
<P>But it is a folly to talk of being too holy, too &s;trict, or too good. Where there happens to appear &s;ome foundation for the charge of enthu&s;ia&s;m (as there are indeed too often in good people ec|centricities which ju&s;tify the cen&s;ure), we may depend upon it, that it proceeds from &s;ome defect in the judgment, and not from any exce&s;s in the piety; for in goodne&s;s there is no exce&s;s: and it is as prepo&s;terous to &s;ay that any one is too good, or too pious, as that he is too wi&s;e, too &s;trong, or too healthy; &s;ince the highe&s;t point in all the&s;e is only the per|fection of that quality which we admired

<P>And even well-meaning men, as well as hypocrites, may think too much is done when their "mint" and "ani&s;e" are rigorou&s;ly tithed.</P>
<P>But in ob&s;erving the "weightier mat|ters of the law," in the practice of univer|&s;al holine&s;s, in the love of God, there can be no po&s;&s;ibility of exceeding, while there is no limitation in the command.</P>

<P>The foundation of this &s;illy cen&s;ure is commonly laid in the fir&s;t principles of education, where an early &s;eparation is &s;y&s;tematically made between duty and plea&s;ure. One of the fir&s;t baits held out for the encouragement of children, is,

that when they have done their <HI>duty,</HI> they will be entitled to &s;ome <HI>plea&s;ure;</HI> thus for|cibly disjoining what &s;hould be con&s;ider|ed as in&s;eparable.

<P>But while chri&s;tian ob&s;ervances are con&s;idered as ta&s;ks, which are to be got over to entitle us to &s;omething more plea|&s;ant; as a burthen which we mu&s;t en|dure in order to propitiate an inexorable Judge, who makes a hard bargain with his creatures, and allows them ju&s;t &s;o much amu&s;ement in pay for &s;o much drudgery; we mu&s;t not wonder that &s;uch low views are entertained of chri&s;tianity, and that a religious life is reprobated as &s;trict and rigid.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="025845_0129_0FCF2DA589A55C40">
But to him who acts from the nobler motive of love, and the animating power of the chri&s;tian hope, the exerci&s;e is the reward, the permi&s;&s;ion is the privilege, the work is the wages. <HI>He</HI> does not carve out &s;ome mi&s;erable plea&s;ure, and &s;tipulate for &s;ome meagre diver&s;ion, to pay him&s;elf for the hard performance of his duty, who in that very performance, experiences the highe&s;t plea&s;ure, and feels the true&s;t gratification of which his nature is capable.</P>
<P>This reprobated &s;trictne&s;s therefore, &s;o far from being the &s;ource of di&s;com|fort and mi&s;ery, as is pretended, is in re|ality the true cau&s;e of actual enjoyment, by laying the axe to the root of all tho&s;e turbulent and unea&s;y pa&s;&s;ions, the unre|&s;erved and yet imperfect gratification of which does &s;o much more tend to di&s;turb

<P>But all precepts &s;eem rigorous, all ob|&s;ervances are really hard, where there is not an entire conviction of God's right to our obedience, and an internal princi|ple of faith and love to make that obedi|ence plea&s;ant. A religious life is indeed a hard bondage to one immer&s;ed in the practices of the world, the fle&s;h, and the fa&s;hion. To a perfect chri&s;tian, it is "perfect freedom." He does not now ab&s;tain from &s;uch and &s;uch things, mere|ly becau&s;e they are forbidden (as he did in the fir&s;t &s;tages of his progre&s;s), but becau&s;e his &s;oul has no longer any plea|&s;ure in them. And it would be the &s;eve|re&s;t of all puni&s;hments to oblige him to return to tho&s;e practices, from which he once ab&s;tained with difficulty, and through the le&s;s noble principle of fear.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="025845_0131_0FCF4230548A8B80">
There is not therefore perhaps a greater mi&s;take than that common noti|on entertained by the more orderly part of the fa&s;hionable world, that a little religion will make people happy, but that an high degree of it is incompati|ble with all enjoyment. For &s;urely <HI>that</HI> religion can add little to a man's happi|ne&s;s which re&s;trains him from the com|mi&s;&s;ion of a wrong action, but which does not pretend to extingui&s;h the bad principle from which the act proceeded. A religion which ties the hands, without changing the heart; which, like the hell of Tantalus, &s;ubdues not the de&s;ire, yet forbids the gratification, is indeed an uncomfortable &s;tate. Such a religion, though it may gain a man &s;omething on the &s;ide of reputation, will give him but little inward comfort, if his heart be &s;till left a prey to that temper which produc|ed the evil, even though terror or &s;hame may have prevented the outward act.</P>

That people devoted to the pur&s;uits of a di&s;&s;ipated life &s;hould conceive of religion as a difficult and even unattain|able &s;tate, it is ea&s;y to believe.

<P>THE chri&s;tian religion is not intended as &s;ome of its fa&s;hionable profe&s;&s;ors &s;eem to fancy, to operate as a charm, a tali&s;|man, or incantation; and to produce its effect by our pronouncing certain my|&s;tical words, attending at certain con&s;e|crated places, and performing certain hallowed ceremonies: but it is an active, vital, influential principle, operating on

<P>That the effects of &s;uch a principle are &s;trikingly vi&s;ible in the lives and manners of the generality of tho&s;e who give the law to fa&s;hion, will not perhaps be in&s;i&s;ted on.

Now would it be much more ab&s;urd (for any other rea&s;on but becau&s;e it is not the cu&s;tom) if our legi&s;lators were to meet one day in every week, gravely to read over all the ob&s;olete &s;tatutes, and re&s;cinded acts of parliament; than it is for the order of per&s;ons of the above de&s;cription to a&s;&s;emble every Sunday, to profe&s;s their belief in, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, a &s;y&s;tem of principles, which they do not &s;o much as <HI>intend</HI> &s;hall be binding on their practice?</P>
<P>But to continue our enquiry.&mdash;There is not a more common or more intelli|gible definition of human duty, than that of "Fear God, and keep his command|ments." Now, as to the fir&s;t of the&s;e in|&s;eparable precepts, can we, with the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of charity, be very for|ward to conclude that God is really "very greatly feared," in &s;ecret, by tho&s;e who give too manife&s;t indications that

And as to the latter precept, which na|turally grows out of the other&mdash;without noticing any of the flagrant breaches of the moral law, let us only confine our|&s;elves to the allowed, general, and no|torious violation of the fourth com|mandment, and then enquire what apo|logy can be offered for this, by believers at lea&s;t, who &s;cruple not to allow the authority of that book, which declares, among many other alarming denuncia|tions, that the wilful and habitual offend|er in any one point is guilty of the breach of the whole law.</P>
<P>Shall we have rea&s;on to change our opinion, if we take another divine re|pre&s;entation of the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of religion, and apply it as a touch&s;tone in the pre&s;ent trial&mdash;"Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, &amp;c. and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf?"

<HEAD>CHAPTER VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD>View of tho&s;e who acknowledge chri&s;tianity as a perfect &s;y&s;tem of morals, but deny its divine authority&mdash;Morality not the whole of religion.</HEAD>
<P>AS in the preceding chapter notice was taken of that de&s;cription of per&s;ons who profe&s;s to receive chri&s;tianity with great reverence as a matter of faith, who yet do not pretend to adopt it as a rule of conduct; I &s;hall conclude the&s;e &s;light re|marks with &s;ome &s;hort animadver&s;ions on another &s;et of men, and that not a &s;mallone, among the decent and the fa&s;hionable, who profe&s;s to think it exhibits an admi|rable &s;y&s;tem of morals, while they deny
<PB N="155" REF="025845_0161_0FCF2CFFD81B5B30">
its divine authority; though that alone can make the nece&s;&s;ity of obeying its pre|cepts binding on the con&s;ciences of men.</P>
<P>This is a very di&s;creet &s;cheme: for &s;uch per&s;ons at once &s;ave them&s;elves from the di&s;credit of having their under|&s;tanding impo&s;ed upon by a &s;uppo&s;ed blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to evidences and autho|rities; and yet, prudently enough, &s;ecure to them&s;elves, in no &s;mall degree, the re|putation of good men. By &s;teering this middle kind of cour&s;e, they contrive to be reckoned liberal by the <HI>philo&s;ophers,</HI> and decent by the believers.</P>
<P>But we are not commonly to expect to &s;ee the pure morality of the Go&s;pel very carefully transfu&s;ed into the lives of &s;uch objectors. And indeed it would be unju&s;t to imagine that the precepts <HI>&s;hould</HI> be mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved by tho&s;e who reject the authority. The
<PB N="156" REF="025845_0162_0FCF6402A7147888">
influence of divine truth, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;ari|ly be&s;t prepare the heart for an unre&s;erv|ed obedience to its laws. If we do not depend on that pardon and acceptance which chri&s;tianity offers, we &s;hall want the be&s;t motive to the actions and per|formances which it enjoins. A lively belief <HI>mu&s;t</HI> therefore precede a very hearty and complete obedience. We are told, on the very be&s;t authority, that truth &s;anctifies the heart: and the &s;ame autho|rity adds, that, the "word of God is truth." That command therefore, for in&s;tance, to &s;et "our affections on things above," will operate but faintly, till that &s;pirit from which the command pro|ceeds, touches the heart, and convinces it that no human good is worthy of the entire affection of an immortal creature. An unre&s;erved faith in the promi&s;er mu&s;t precede our worthy performance of any duty to which the promi&s;e is annexed.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="025845_0163_0FCF6403B3ACBAB0">
But as to a &s;et of duties enforced by no other motive than a bare acquie&s;cence in their beauty, and a cold conviction of their propriety, but impelled by no obe|dience to his authority who impo&s;es them; though we know not how well they might be performed by pure and impeccable beings, yet we know how they commonly <HI>are</HI> performed by frail and di&s;|orderly creatures, fallen from their in|nocence, and corrupt in their very na|tures.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, nothing but a conviction of the truth of chri&s;tianity can reconcile thinking beings to the extraordinary ap|pearances of things in the Creator's moral government of the world. The works of God are an enigma, of which his word alone is the &s;olution. The dark veil which is thrown over the divine di&s;pen|&s;ations in this lower world, mu&s;t natu|rally &s;hock tho&s;e who con&s;ider only the

&s;ingle &s;cene which is acting on the pre|&s;ent &s;tage; but is reconcileable to him who, having learnt from revelation the nature of the laws by which the great Author acts, tru&s;ts confidently that the cata&s;trophe will &s;et all to rights. The confu&s;ion which &s;in and the pa&s;&s;ions have introduced; the triumph of wickedne&s;s, the &s;eemingly arbitrary di&s;proportion of human conditions, accountable on no &s;cheme but that which the Go&s;pel has opened to us&mdash;have all a natural tenden|cy to withdraw from the love of God the hearts of tho&s;e who erect them&s;elves into critics on the divine conduct, and yet will not &s;tudy the plan, and get ac|quainted with the rules, &s;o far as it has plea&s;ed the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er to reveal them.</P>
<P>Till therefore the word of God is u&s;ed as "a lamp to their paths," men can neither truly di&s;cern the crookedne&s;s of
<PB N="159" REF="025845_0165_0FCF640778535790">
their own ways, nor the perfection of that light by which they are directed to walk. And this light can only be &s;een by its own proper brightne&s;s; it has no other medium. Till therefore "the &s;e|cret of the Lord" is with men, they will not truly "fear him;" till he has "en|larged their hearts" with the knowledge and belief of his word, they will not very vigorou&s;ly "run the way of his com|mandments." Till they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that "faith without which it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to plea&s;e God," they will not attain that holine&s;s without which no man can &s;ee him.</P>
<P>And indeed if God has thought &s;it to make the go&s;pel an in&s;trument of &s;alvati|on, we mu&s;t own the nece&s;&s;ity of receiv|ing it as a divine in&s;titution, before it is likely to operate very effectually on the conduct.

If there|fore chri&s;tianity had been intended for nothing more than a mere &s;y&s;tem of ethics &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem &s;urely might have been produced at an infinitely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s expence.

Le&s;&s;ons of mere human virtue might have been delivered by &s;ome &s;uitable in&s;trument of human wi&s;dom, &s;trengthened by the vi&s;i|ble authority of human power. A bare &s;y&s;tem of morals might have been com|municated to mankind with a more rea|&s;onable pro&s;pect of advantage, by means not &s;o repugnant to human pride. A mere &s;cheme of conduct might have been

delivered, with far greater probability of &s;ucce&s;s, by Antoninus the emperor, or Plato the philo&s;opher, than by Paul the tent-maker, or Peter the fi&s;herman.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity, then, mu&s;t be embraced entirely, if it be received at all. It mu&s;t be taken, without mutilation, as a per|fect &s;cheme, in the way in which God has been plea&s;ed to reveal it. It mu&s;t be accepted, not as exhibiting beautiful parts, but as pre&s;enting one con&s;ummate whole, of which the perfection ari&s;es from coherence and dependence, from relation and con&s;i&s;tency. Its power will be weakened, and its energy de&s;troyed, if every caviller pulls out a pin, or ob|&s;tructs a &s;pring, with the pre&s;umptuous view of new modelling the divine work, and making it go to his own mind. There is no breaking this &s;y&s;tem into portions of which we are at liberty to choo&s;e one, and reject another. There is no &s;epa|rating
<PB N="162" REF="025845_0168_0FCF640CB7CD4358">
the evidences from the doctrines, the doctrines from the precepts, belief from obedience, morality from piety, the love of our neighbour from the love of God. If we profe&s;s chri&s;tianity at all, if we allow the Divine Author to be in|deed unto us "wi&s;dom and righteou&s;|ne&s;s," he mu&s;t be al&s;o "&s;anctification and redemption."</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity, then, is a&s;&s;uredly &s;ome|thing more than a mere &s;et of rules; and piety, though it never pretended to be the &s;ub&s;titute for a good life, is indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to its acceptance with God. The Go&s;pel never offers to make religion &s;uper&s;ede morality, but every where clearly proves that morality is not the whole of religion. Piety is not only nece&s;&s;ary as a <HI>means,</HI> but is it&s;elf a mo&s;t important <HI>end.</HI> It is not only the be&s;t principle of moral conduct, but is an in|di&s;pen&s;able and ab&s;olute duty in it&s;elf.

It is not only the highe&s;t motive to the practice of virtue, but is a prior obliga|tion; and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, even when detached from its immediate influence on practical goodne&s;s. Religion will &s;urvive all the virtues of which it is the &s;ource; for we &s;hall be living in the no|ble&s;t exerci&s;es of piety, when we &s;hall have no objects on which to exerci&s;e many human virtues. When there will be no di&s;tre&s;s to be relieved, no injuries to be forgiven, no evil habits to be &s;ub|dued; there will be a Creator to be ble&s;|&s;ed and adored, a Redeemer to be loved and prai&s;ed.</P>
