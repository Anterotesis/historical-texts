<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS induced to undertake the trouble&s;ome and diffi|cult ta&s;k of collecting and publi&s;hing a conci&s;e and faithful account of the Climates and Di&s;ea&s;es of the United States of America, by a de&s;ire of removing the trouble and inconvenience which re&s;ult from accommodating the rules of practice and forms of pre&s;cription made in other coun|tries to the di&s;ea&s;es which occur in this, where the climate, &s;oil, and modes of living of the inhabitants, and of cour&s;e their con&s;titutions, and the &s;emieology of di&s;ea&s;es, even of the &s;ame genus, are in many re&s;pects different; and by a pre&s;umption, that &s;uch an account might contribute in &s;ome mea&s;ure to improve the treatment of epidemics, e&s;pe|cially in this country.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e objects in view, I opened a corre&s;pondence with &s;everal phy&s;icians of talents and experience re&s;iding in the &s;everal &s;tates, and with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, joined to my own per&s;onal ob&s;ervations, and &s;uch information as I could collect from the few books which contain any thing rela|tive to the &s;ubject, have compo&s;ed the following pages; in
<PB N="2" REF="024239_0004_0FC57208F3F45AA0">
which I have endeavoured to exhibit, a &s;ynop&s;is or general view of the &s;ituation and climate of each &s;tate; and of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es in particular which depend upon climate and &s;itu|ation, (with occa&s;ional remarks on others); and an account of the remedies and methods of treatment which have been found mo&s;t uniformly &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>AS health is a ble&s;&s;ing which enhances the value of every enjoyment, and long life the natural de&s;ire of all man|kind, I have endeavoured to point out the circum&s;tances mo&s;t favourable thereto, as well as tho&s;e productive of di&s;ea&s;e and death. For this purpo&s;e I have in&s;erted a number of meteorological tables and bills of mortality.</P>
<P>AS climate and &s;ituation have a remarkable influence upon the con&s;titution and health, as well as upon the complexion and figure of mankind, and as the temperature of climate depends upon various circum&s;tances be&s;ides latitude, or proximity to the equator; I have been at &s;ome pains in endeavouring to &s;hew what tho&s;e circum&s;tances are, the cau&s;es on which they depend, and the means by which they may be altered.</P>
<P>IN the inve&s;tigation of the nature and cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es, and in determining the effects of remedies, I have been uniformly governed by actual experience, never by hypo|the&s;is or plau&s;ible conjectures, being convinced that for want of this precaution, the &s;chools of phy&s;ic have &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
<PB N="3" REF="024239_0005_0FC5720A458F81F8">
fallen into the mo&s;t incongruous and palpable errors, and the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of rea&s;oning have proved the mo&s;t un&s;ucce&s;sful interpreters of nature's laws.</P>
<P>BUT I am by no means an advocate for the exclu&s;ion of rea&s;oning or theory (founded on cautious and judicious in|duction) from medical pur&s;uits, as has unfortunately of late become too much the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>FOR without rea&s;oning, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to acquire a knowledge of the proximate cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es, or the particular conditions of the &s;y&s;tem on which the &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;es depend.</P>
<P>AND as there are &s;everal di&s;ea&s;es of a different nature, and produced by cau&s;es entirely different in their operation, which have many &s;ymptoms in common; the practitioner who is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this knowledge, mu&s;t inevitably commit many fatal mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>BUT this knowledge &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to enable a phy&s;ician to di&s;tingui&s;h one &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;e from ano|ther, as well as to di&s;cover the indications he ought to pur|&s;ue in the cure, can only be acquired, (after a previous ac|quaintance with the &s;tructure, connection of parts, and oeconomy of the human body in a &s;ound and healthy &s;tate) by much &s;tudy and reflection, and by the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry into the condition of the &s;everal functions of the body in di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="024239_0006_0FC5720BAC29F820">
WHOEVER therefore undertakes the cure of di&s;ea&s;es with|out this knowledge is an empiric, and merits the contempt and dete&s;tation of every one who values the lives and &s;afety of his fellow-creatures; for "though he may kill by licence, he can only cure by chance."</P>
<P>THE annals of every age, and the bills of mortality of every country, would, if unveiled, produce proofs as &s;trong as tho&s;e of Holy Writ, that more lives have been de&s;troyed by the villainy of quacks, and the ignorance and officiou&s;|ne&s;s of no&s;trum-mongers, than by di&s;ea&s;e, owing to the credulity of the ignorant, and the remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of go|vernment: I am, therefore, much &s;urpri&s;ed that our en|lightened legi&s;latures (who&s;e duty it is to protect the lives as well as the privileges and property of tho&s;e whom igno|rance or want of information renders liable to impo&s;ition) have never yet made provi&s;ion to prevent the like deplora|ble effects in this country.</P>
<P>THE difficulty of obtaining authentic and &s;atisfactory information on a &s;ubject never before attempted in America, has obliged me to leave many parts mutilated and imperfect: and want of &s;ufficient lei&s;ure has prevented me from pay|ing requi&s;ite attention to &s;y&s;tematic arrangement; but as the work has &s;ome claim to originality, abounds with a number of intere&s;ting facts, and is intended as an intro|duction to a complete &s;y&s;tem of practice, (now ready for the pre&s;s,) exhibiting all the late&s;t and mo&s;t important di&s;|coveries which have been made in medicine, I tru&s;t it will meet with that candour and indulgence to which the be&s;t intentions are entitled.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="account">
<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of the DISEASES which occur in the &s;everal States of NEW-ENGLAND, viz. NEW-HAMPSHIRE, MASSACHU|SETTS, RHODE-ISLAND and CONNEC|TICUT.</HEAD>
<P>"THE Di&s;ea&s;es which occur in different parts of the&s;e &s;tates in the Winter and Spring Sea&s;ons among the farmers and mechanics who re&s;ide at a di&s;tance from the larger trading cities and towns, are principal|ly the Catarrh&mdash;Quin&s;y&mdash;Pleuri&s;y&mdash;Rheu|mati&s;m&mdash;Tooth-Ach&mdash;Inflammation of the

<P>"THE greate&s;t number of the di&s;orders which have been enumerated are found to be le&s;s frequent in Winter than in the Spring."</P>
<P>THE winds which prevail during the great|e&s;t part of Winter, from the north and north we&s;t, though they are &s;evere and piercing cold, occa&s;ioned by the great body of &s;now which covers the immen&s;e mountains over which they pa&s;s, in&s;tead of producing di&s;|ea&s;es, (by whatever mode of operation cold air acts upon animal bodies,) give vigor to the con&s;titutions, and a fre&s;hne&s;s and bloom to the complexion of the inhabitants, unknown in &s;outhern climates.</P>
<P>"IN the early part of the Spring, 'while the &s;ea&s;on as yet is unconfirmed, and oft at
<PB N="3" REF="024239_0009_0FC5721440DB2D60">
eve re&s;umes the chilly bla&s;t,' tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are more frequent, but even then they are commonly the effect of imprudent expo&s;ure to cold and rainy weather, getting the feet wet, &s;itting on the damp ground, &s;leeping in damp &s;heets, neglecting to change wet clothes after expo&s;ure to the rain, &amp;c. &amp;c. or from frequent exce&s;&s;es or debauches in &s;trong liquor, e&s;pecially of fre&s;h di&s;tilled rum."</P>
<P>"THE Small-Pox, which is an exotic di&s;|ea&s;e, depending on &s;pecific infection, though once permitted, is not allowed at pre&s;ent to be communicated by inoculation in the&s;e &s;tates<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nor in any of the &s;tates, except New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware and South-Carolina.</NOTE>. Whenever it happens to appear in the natural way, all intercour&s;e is avoided with the infected, except by tho&s;e who have had the di&s;ea&s;e; and the&s;e la&s;t are excluded from all &s;ociety after their attendance on the &s;ick, till they have performed quarentine, af|ter the manner of tho&s;e in other countries who have been infected with the Plague."</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="024239_0010_0FC57219D20C2DA0">
"THE di&s;ea&s;es which occur in the &s;um|mer and autumnal &s;ea&s;ons are very few and rare. Tho&s;e mo&s;t commonly met with on high and dry &s;ituations, are, Phrenitis from In&s;olation, Diarrhoeas, Choleras, a &s;pecies of fever attended with &s;ymptoms of great debi|lity, without being infectious or accompani|ed with any &s;ymptom indicative of inflam|matory Diathe&s;is.&mdash;This fever is confined to per&s;ons who have been over-fatigued by hard labour during the hot weather."</P>
<P>"IN low mar&s;hy &s;ituations, where there is much &s;tagnant water, and which are &s;ub|ject to great inundations from the Spring fre&s;hes, intermittents &s;ometimes occur; and when the Summers have been remarkably hot and dry, Remittents, accompanied with bilious &s;ymptoms, have frequently been ob|&s;erved to prevail&mdash;In the &s;ame &s;ituations and under apparently &s;imilar circum&s;tances, the Dy&s;entery al&s;o &s;ometimes occurs, but more particularly among tho&s;e who live on vegeta|ble diet and watery drinks."</P>
<P>"IN the populous city of Bo&s;ton, where
<PB N="5" REF="024239_0011_0FC5721B7B358C08">
people of different occupations and profe&s;|&s;ions are collected together, the catalogue of di&s;ea&s;es is greater, and they are more com|plex and difficult to cure."&mdash;This is the ca&s;e in all large cities where the hou&s;es are built clo&s;e together, and the occupations of the inhabitants are unfavourable to exerci&s;e; and the more &s;o, as they recede from habits of temperance; e&s;pecially where luxury and fa|&s;hion take the lead of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>THE farmer while he tames the &s;tubborn &s;oil and forces it to reward his labours, in&s;en|&s;ibly acquires vigour of body and re&s;olution of mind, and at the &s;ame time re&s;pires a &s;a|lubrious air; but manufacturers and mecha|nics, confined to &s;edentary occupations, or condemned to vegetate in cellars and clo&s;e apartments, breathe infection, and their minds become contracted as well as their lives a|bridged.</P>
<P>IN addition to the di&s;ea&s;es already menti|oned, the following may be numbered as oc|curring occa&s;ionally, though they can not be
<PB N="6" REF="024239_0012_0FC5721D033EB040">
a&s;cribed to any peculiarity of climate, &s;oil, or local &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"CYNANCHE Maligna, or Putrid Quin&s;y, Scarlatina Angino&s;a&mdash;Hepatitis&mdash;Nephritis&mdash;Podagra, or Gout&mdash;Phthi&s;is Pulmonalis, (ve|ry frequent)&mdash;Epilep&s;y&mdash;Apoplexy&mdash;Pal&s;y&mdash;A&s;thma&mdash;Hooping Cough&mdash;Colic&mdash;In&s;ani|ty&mdash;Melancholy&mdash;all the varieties of Drop&s;y&mdash;Hypochondria&mdash;Hy&s;teria&mdash;Scrophula, &amp;c."</P>
<P>AS the cau&s;es of the&s;e will be explained hereafter, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve in this place, that though a cour&s;e of intemperance never fails of being de&s;tructive to health in a longer or &s;horter time, it is much &s;lower in produ|cing its effects in the&s;e northern &s;tates than in tho&s;e to the &s;outhward&mdash;Many have been known to live in a high and dry &s;ituation in the daily habit of intoxication to old age; and tho&s;e called &s;oakers or tiplers, who drink a pint or two of rum, or half a gallon or a gal|lon of cyder per day, and make u&s;e of mode|rate exerci&s;e, are &s;eldom known to be troubled with any complaint, but that of hard times and &s;carcity of money. But the vice of drunk|enne&s;s
<PB N="7" REF="024239_0013_0FC572238CEE0730">
does not predominate in this country, as Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erves it does through others, in proportion to the coldne&s;s of the climate. <HI>Vide</HI> Spirit of Laws, Book 14th.</P>
<P>"IN the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton are much &s;ubject to catarrhal affecti|ons or coughs, owing to the coldne&s;s and moi&s;ture of the winds which prevail there at this &s;ea&s;on. The&s;e begin to ri&s;e about ten o'clock, A. M. and continue to blow till near &s;un&s;et."</P>
<P>DOCTOR <HI>I&s;aac Senter,</HI> in a letter to the au|thor, dated Newport<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Newport and Providence are the two principal towns in this &s;tate: The former lies in latitude 41&deg;, 35&prime;; contains 1000 hou&s;es, chiefly of wood, and 5530 inhabitants. This i&s;land is 68 miles in length and 40 in breadth. Providence about 30 miles N. W. of Newport&mdash;contains 700 hou&s;es.</NOTE>, (Rhode-I&s;land) Feb. 19th, 1791, informs him that <Q>The epide|mics, as well as mo&s;t of the infectious di&s;ea&s;es which vi&s;it this i&s;land, differ in &s;ome re&s;pects very con&s;iderably from the &s;ame complaints in the other &s;ea ports of New-England&mdash;The Dy&s;entery is not only le&s;s frequent here, but is generally much le&s;s mortal. The remit|ting
<PB N="8" REF="024239_0014_0FC572252C570B30">
fevers of the &s;ummer and autumn are &s;eldom fatal, and the Putrid Fever, though rarely a native of this i&s;land, generally occurs in cold weather.</Q></P>
<Q><P>THE infectious di&s;ea&s;es which I have &s;een here, all except the &s;mall-pox, are more mild than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>SINCE my remembrance the genuine Intermitting Fever, was very common in dif|ferent parts of the inland country of New-England; but for twenty years pa&s;t has &s;el|dom been met with any where ea&s;t of New|York.</P>
<P>DR. Senter farther remarks, That the reigning epidemics of the different &s;ea&s;ons in New-England, are very &s;imilar, and the Intermitting Fever is not the only di&s;ea&s;e that has become very rare within the&s;e la&s;t twenty years.</P>
<P>PEOPLE in this &s;tate are frequently af|fected with the Diarrhoea or Cholera, after having u&s;ed violent exertions in the harve&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="024239_0015_0FC57226F17F0158">
field, expo&s;ed to the in&s;ufferable blaze of the &s;un, after they have eaten too freely of ve|getable &s;ub&s;tances and fre&s;h meats, and have drank &s;uch drinks as have not been &s;ufficient|ly fermented.</P>
<P>THE moderate u&s;e of rum at &s;uch a time has been found &s;erviceable, as it re&s;trains fer|mentation and prevents debility or relaxation. It al&s;o prevents the ill effects which are fre|quently occa&s;ioned by drinking cold water when the body is heated by exerci&s;e, and de|bilitated by the action of exce&s;&s;ive heat.</P></Q>
<P>IN this la&s;t circum&s;tance, laudanum in &s;mall do&s;es mixed with hot toddy or &s;trong tea, and frequently re&s;umed, is a &s;overeign remedy.</P>
<P>THOUGH Connecticut appears to be &s;ub|ject to nearly equal degrees of the extremes of cold and heat with Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and New|Hamp&s;hire, and to more frequent and &s;ud|den changes of weather, it appears from its almo&s;t incredibly rapid increa&s;e of population to be more healthy than either of them&mdash;but if the reports of travellers are to be credited,
<PB N="10" REF="024239_0016_0FC5722E28841200">
it is le&s;s &s;o than Rhode-I&s;land, which is em|phatically called the <HI>Garden of Eden.</HI></P>
<P>THE heats in &s;ummer, which are extreme in other parts of New-England, are allayed in Rhode-I&s;land, by the cool and refre&s;hing breezes from the &s;ea. This is to be under|&s;tood of tho&s;e parts which approach the &s;ea coa&s;t&mdash;farther back in the country the &s;ea breezes have le&s;s effect, and the weather is con&s;equently le&s;s variable. In winter, howe|ver, they pay dearly for the&s;e advantages from expo&s;ure to the N. W. wind, the tyrant of this country, which renders this i&s;land bleak and uncomfortable.</P>
<P>DR. Foulke, in a di&s;cour&s;e which he read lately before the American Philo&s;ophical So|ciety ob&s;erves, that, "in other countries, men are divided, according to their wealth or in|digence, into three cla&s;&s;es. The opulent, the middling, and the poor; the idlene&s;s, luxu|ries, and debaucheries of the fir&s;t, and the mi&s;ery, and too frequent intemperance of the la&s;t, de&s;troy a greater proportion of the&s;e two; the intermediate cla&s;s is below tho&s;e indul|gences
<PB N="11" REF="024239_0017_0FC5722EED3CD750">
which prove fatal to the rich, and above tho&s;e &s;ufferings to which the unfortu|nate poor fall victims&mdash;this is therefore the happie&s;t divi&s;ion of the three: Of the rich and poor, North-America furni&s;hes a much &s;maller proportion than any other di&s;trict of the known world. In Connecticut particu|larly the di&s;tribution of wealth and its con|comitants is more equal than el&s;ewhere; and therefore, as far as exce&s;s or want of wealth may prove de&s;tructive or &s;alutary to life, the inhabitants of this &s;tate may plead exemp|tion from di&s;ea&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Connecticut is the mo&s;t populous in proportion to its extent, of any of the thirteen &s;tates. It is laid out in &s;mall farms, from 50 to 3 or 400 acres each, which are held by the farmers in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ee &s;imple; and are generally cultivated as well as the nature of the &s;oil will admit, and the whole &s;tate re&s;embles a well cul|tivated garden. With that degree of indu&s;try which contri|butes to happine&s;s, it produces the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life in great plenty. In 1756 the number of inhabitants in this &s;tate was 130, 611&mdash;in 1774 there were 197, 856&mdash;The increa&s;e in 18 years was 67, 245. From 1774 to 1782, the in|crea&s;e was only 11, 294. This comparatively &s;mall increa&s;e was owing to the de&s;tructive effects of the war, and to the nu|merous emigrations to Vermont and other &s;tates. The inha|bitants of all the &s;tates of New-England are almo&s;t all of Eng|li&s;h de&s;cent. There are no Dutch, French or Germans, and very few Scotch or Iri&s;h among them.</NOTE>."</P>

do happen, and of &s;uch as were frequent formerly, but &s;eldom or never make their ap|pearance here at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is the Rickets. This di&s;ea&s;e was formerly (about thirty-five or forty years ago) pretty common here, and more e&s;pecially among negro children, as I very well remember: but is now become &s;o rare that I have not &s;een it more than three or four times, the&s;e eight or ten years, accord|ing to the be&s;t of my remembrance.</P>
<P>DR. Gli&s;&s;on and others, the fir&s;t writers on Rickets, inform us, that it fir&s;t made its ap|pearance about thirty years before they wrote, i. e. about the year 1620, in the counties of Dor&s;et and Somer&s;et, in Great-Britain; which, if true, &s;hows it to be of a very mo|dern date; and from a chart of the fatal di&s;|ea&s;es, &amp;c. in London, collected and publi&s;h|ed by Dr. William Black, it appears, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> has been gradually declining in that city the&s;e &s;eventy or eighty years pa&s;t; particu|larly from 1702 to 1717, (a period of fif|teen years) there died of the Rickets 3916;
<PB N="24" REF="024239_0030_0FC572552DACFE40">
and that from 1762 to 1777, (another period of the &s;ame length) there died only 104. All the&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;eem to indicate an ut|ter extinction of this &s;courge of infants.</P>
<P>ANOTHER is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Colica Pictonum, or Dry Belly-Ach, as it was commonly called&punc; This painful and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing complain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, till about twenty-four or twenty-&s;ix years ago, was &s;o frequent, that it was no uncommon thing to have &s;ix or eight patients, or more ill of it in a winter, the &s;ea&s;on in which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;tly prevailed, though it was not confined to cold weather: But now, for the&s;e twelve or fifteen years back, I imagine there have not been five per&s;ons ill of it in this town, if we except a very few who dealt in lead, and who it was evident derived their di&s;ea&s;e from that &s;ource, &s;uch as painters, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS &s;pecies of Colic was formerly attri|buted to hard drinking; and it is certain that per&s;ons addicted to &s;pirituous liquors were generally the &s;ubjects of it; but its rare ap|pearance now cannot be owing to an increa&s;e of temperance, for I fear it is a melancholy
<PB N="25" REF="024239_0031_0FC5725A902C6950">
that intemperance is as prevalent at this peri|od as it has been the&s;e forty years.</P>
<P>QUERY? Can this difference be account|ed for from the very general di&s;u&s;e of pewter? Formerly the mo&s;t u&s;ual drinking ve&s;&s;el in the hou&s;es of the poorer cla&s;&s;es of people, was a pewter quart-pot, and tho&s;e made u&s;e of in eating, &s;uch as plates, porringers, &amp;c. were of the &s;ame material; which, when not fre|quently &s;cowered are apt to be converted into ceru&s;s. But the u&s;e of pewter is now in gene|ral di&s;u&s;e, and by the revolution of fa&s;hion&punc; its place is &s;upplied by more modi&s;h &s;tone ware, called <HI>Queen's-Ware.</HI></P>
<P>BOTH the la&s;t mentioned di&s;ea&s;es, I am informed, are more rare in &s;ome of the neigh|bouring towns than they are in this: as to others I have no information; nor how the ca&s;e is in the more di&s;tant parts of the coun|try.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it would be intere&s;ting to en|qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, what di&s;ea&s;es have become extinct, or
<PB N="26" REF="024239_0032_0FC5725BF53598E8">
very rare among us, and what new ones have &s;ucceeded in their room.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee no Intermitting Fevers generated here, though 35 or 40 years ago they &s;ome|times occurred.</P>
<P>TYPHUS, both mitior and gravior of Dr. Cullen, were frequent with us from 25 to 35 years ago, e&s;pecially in Autumn, and proved fatal to many in the vigour and prime of life; it is now comparatively very rare.</P>
<P>SCURVY is a di&s;ea&s;e we very &s;eldom meet with: Sailors &s;ometimes return from &s;ea with it, and for the mo&s;t part recover very &s;oon; but I have never met with more than a very few in&s;tances of it generated here at home, in the cour&s;e of my practice.</P>
<P>PUERPERAL Fever very &s;eldom occurs here.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude with ob&s;erving, what I &s;uppo&s;e mu&s;t have been ob&s;erved by all the el|der Practitioners among us, that acute di&s;|ea&s;es

The highe&s;t part of a ridge of mountains in it, which extend N. E. and S. W. are called the <HI>White Mountains.</HI> The&s;e mountains are e&s;timated to be 9000 feet above the level of the &s;ea, and are covered with &s;now and ice nine or ten months in the year, during which time they exhibit that white appearance, from whence they have derived their name. From their &s;ummit is exhibited an amazing view, ex|tending 60 or 70 miles in every direction&mdash;And though more than 70 miles within land

they may be di&s;cerned many leagues off at &s;ea, from whence they appear like an exceed|ing bright cloud in the horizon. Three of the large&s;t rivers in New-England receive a great part of their waters from the&s;e moun|tains.</P>
<P>THE ground is generally covered with &s;now the greate&s;t part of the winter: Rain falls but &s;eldom during that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tate embo&s;oming a number of very high mountains, and lying in the neighbour|hood of others, who&s;e towering &s;ummits are covered with &s;now and ice three-quarters of the year, is inten&s;ely cold in the Winter &s;ea|&s;on.</P>

<P>THE Small-Pox, by the vigilant execu|tion of the laws &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the &s;everal New-England &s;tates, has never prevailed ge|nerally among the inhabitants, except in Bo&s;ton, where it was epidemical, A.

<P>A.D. 1752, there was an exact account taken, by order of the magi&s;trates of the town of Bo&s;ton, and rendered upon oath, (in order to remove the prejudices and objections made again&s;t inoculation) of all who had the &s;mall pox, either in the natural way, or by inocula|tion, and of the preci&s;e number of tho&s;e who died of it in either way: By this account it appears that the number of tho&s;e who had the di&s;ea&s;e in the natural way, including blacks, amounted to 5544; of which num|ber there died, including blacks, 574&mdash;The whole number inoculated, including blacks, was 2113, of which 30 died. At this time all pre&s;ent had the Small-Pox, except about 174; the total of re&s;identers at that time (including 1544 negroes) was 9710.

<P>THREE ho&s;pitals were afterwards erected in different parts of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, for the purpo&s;e of receiving patients de&s;irous of be|ing inoculated, and regulated in &s;uch man|ner, as to prevent the infection from &s;pread|ing, or being communicated to any of the re&s;t of the inhabitants, as was expected; but through &s;ome tre&s;pa&s;s of the rules, and the refractory di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome of the patients, the whole utility of the in&s;titution was fru&s;|trated: Whereupon the law permitting ino|culation was repealed, and another pa&s;&s;ed prohibiting it under &s;evere penalties. Since that time, any per&s;on who has the mis|fortune to enter that &s;tate with the di&s;|ea&s;e, or any of the infection adhering to his apparel or goods, and any one is thereby in|fected with the di&s;ea&s;e, he is liable to pay to the party &s;o infected treble damages and co&s;ts of &s;uit.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE CLIMATE AND DISEASES OF NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<P>THE di&s;ea&s;es which occur in the &s;eve|ral parts of this &s;tate, differ &s;o little in number, nature, and cau&s;es, from tho&s;e of the New-England &s;tates, that I think it un|nece&s;&s;ary to enumerate any except tho&s;e pe|culiar to the fa&s;hionable and luxurious.</P>
<P>"THIS &s;tate extends from the 40 to the 45th degree north latitude, is bounded &s;outh ea&s;twardly by the Atlantic ocean; ea&s;t by Connecticut, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and Vermont; north by the 45th degree of latitude, which divides it from Canada; &s;outhwe&s;t and &s;outh by Penn&s;ylvania and New-Jer&s;ey. It is in|ter&s;ected in different parts by ridges of moun|tains,
<PB N="42" REF="024239_0048_0FC57288F27AB6D8">
running in a north ea&s;t and &s;outh we&s;t direction." The&s;e mountains occa&s;ion the winds in winter to be very cold and piercing, (for the air on mountains is always cold in proportion to their height.)</P>
<P>THE difference between the con&s;titutions of the inhabitants of the city and country parts of New-York is almo&s;t incredible. Inflam|matory di&s;ea&s;es are much le&s;s frequent in the city than in the country, and in general are much le&s;s rapid and violent in their progre&s;s than formerly: Nor do they admit of the &s;ame antiphlogi&s;tic method of cure which is found nece&s;&s;ary with people who&s;e occupati|ons require exerci&s;e in the open air.</P>
<P>AN active farmer, with an acute rheuma|ti&s;m, often requires the lo&s;s of 60 or 70 ounces of blood in the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e; but the citizen, confined to a &s;edentary occupation, can &s;eldom bear half that quantity.</P>
<P>THE citizens are affected with a numer|ous train of Nervous complaints, of which the inhabitants of the country have no idea.
<PB N="43" REF="024239_0049_0FC5728A6BEEDF38">
The&s;e appear to influence all their other com|plaints. Great numbers of them are enfeebled and enervated; and it is not uncommon to ob&s;erve high degrees of irritability under the external appearance of firmne&s;s and vigor.</P>
<P>THE Hypochondria, Pal&s;ies, Cachexies, Drop&s;ies, and all tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which ari&s;e from laxity and debility are at this period endemic not only in New-York, but al&s;o in Bo&s;ton, Philadelphia, and Baltimore; and the Hy&s;terics, which u&s;ed to be peculiar to fe|males, as the name indicates, now attacks many of both &s;exes indi&s;criminately. It is evident that &s;o great a revolution in the con|&s;titutions of people could not be effected without the concurrence of many cau&s;es. Among the principal of the&s;e may be ranked, &s;edentary occupations, the intemperate u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, and the daily u&s;e of &s;trong tea.</P>
<P>THAT a &s;trong infu&s;ion of hy&s;on tea is an exceedingly powerful &s;timulant to the Nerv|ous &s;y&s;tem, and intoxicates like &s;piritous li|quors, mu&s;t be manife&s;t to every one who has

ever ob&s;erved a number of ladies a&s;&s;embled at a <HI>tea table.</HI> It is on its narcotic or intoxi|cating quality, that its pernicious effects depend.</P>
<P>BUT the greate&s;t evils which contract the duration, and embitter the enjoyments of life, are derived from the &s;ources of &s;loth, intem|perance and irregular de&s;ires.</P>
<P>THE narrowne&s;s, irregularity, and con|fined &s;ituation of many of the &s;treets and buildings in the city of New-York, ren|der it much more liable to di&s;ea&s;es than Bo&s;|ton, and notwith&s;tanding its &s;uperior &s;ituati|on, it is more &s;ubject to &s;ickne&s;s, during the Summer and Autumnal &s;ea&s;ons, than Phila|delphia. Whether its water, which is bra|ki&s;h and unpalatable, contributes to this cir|cum&s;tance or not, has never been &s;atisfacto|rily a&s;certained.</P>
<P>THE narrowne&s;s and irregular form of its &s;treets, the height of the hou&s;es, and the
<PB N="45" REF="024239_0051_0FC57290ED2A4568">
crowded manner in which they are built, oc|ca&s;ion it to be in&s;ufferably hot in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>THE number of inhabitants in the whole &s;tate, in January, 1791, was computed to be 324,127, of which 18,000 were negroes. The number in the city was 27,000, be&s;ides &s;trangers and &s;ailors.</P>
<P>A COMPARATIVE view of the &s;tate of this city at pre&s;ent, with that which it exhibited 30 years ago, is flattering to the pre&s;ent age, par|ticularly in the improvements in literature, architecture, elegance and politene&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Of the CLIMATE of NEW-YORK</HEAD>
<HEAD>The following is an Ab&s;tract of Dr. Mitchell's Remarks re&s;pecting the Climate of New|York.</HEAD>
<Q><P>IT has been long known that the tem|peratures of countries are to be e&s;tima|ted, not merely by the di&s;tance from the equa|tor, but al&s;o by their remotene&s;s from the margin and level of the ocean.</P>
<P>THE following facts will, perhaps, enable you to form &s;ome idea of the difference be|tween this climate and &s;ome others under the &s;ame parallel.</P>
<P>IN July, 1788, the mercury in Farenheit's thermometer ro&s;e in my chamber in the city of New-York, as high as the 103d degree above 0. And in Februry, 1789 at Albany, it &s;unk to the 24th degree below 0, by the na|tural changes of the weather.</P>
<P>LIGHTNING, during Summer and Au|tumn, is very frequent, particularly near the
<PB N="49" REF="024239_0055_0FC5729AF5FE8668">
i&s;lands and &s;ea coa&s;ts: And (for what rea|&s;on I do not well under&s;tand) the thunder &s;howers almo&s;t invariably come from the north we&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable that the fla&s;h will kill vegetables no le&s;s &s;uddenly than animals, by depriving them of their excitability, or &s;u&s;cep|bility of being excited by the &s;timuli nece&s;|&s;ary to life, rather than by de&s;troying their organization; for animated matter becomes defunct in three ways: 1&s;t. By a de&s;truction of organization, as by mortal wounds. 2d. When the organization is intire, but its capa|city to receive the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;timuli is taken away, as by long expo&s;ure to fixed, or phlogi&s;ticated air, or by exce&s;&s;ive electrical &s;hocks; and 3d. Where the organ and ca|pacity are complete, but where, however, no &s;timuli are applied, as in &s;eeds and in eggs before impregnation, and in animals, not irrecoverably drowned, before re&s;u&s;citation.</P>
<P>ON Long-I&s;land, Indian corn is planted after the beginning or about the middle of May; and the new crop is fit for grinding in 150 days; but the &s;ame kind of grain brought
<PB N="50" REF="024239_0056_0FC5729F06B5F4E0">
from Nova-Scotia, grows here to maturity in 96 days, while that brought from Carolina, does not ripen in le&s;s than 190. Buck-wheat grows from the &s;eed to perfection in 84 days.</P>
<P>FROST commonly occurs in every month of the year, excepting June, July, and Au|gu&s;t; and has now and then even happened in June and Augu&s;t. It comes frequently about the fir&s;t of September; and I remember on the 4th of May, 1774, a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;now fell.</P>
<P>IN the Spring the blo&s;&s;oms of peach, apple, and other fruit-trees, and the &s;prouting foli|age of plants, are often hurt by it; but from cau&s;es which I do not fully comprehend, it prevails mo&s;t in low lands, valleys and plains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this explained under the account of the Climate of Virginia.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DROUGHT of &s;ix or eight weeks continu|ance &s;ometimes parch us, and again rain falls to the depth of five or &s;ix inches on a level, in four hours. Winds are very variable; the &s;ea breezes, which blow from the &s;outh, are our warme&s;t in Winter, and from the north
<PB N="51" REF="024239_0057_0FC572A2464EAB78">
we&s;t, our coole&s;t in Summer. In the Win|ter the north we&s;t winds are the mo&s;t boi&s;ter|ous and piercing: though the north ea&s;t are generally attended with &s;torms of &s;now and &s;leet.</P>
<P>THE abundance of melting &s;now and ice, which frequently over&s;preads the country, far and near, &s;ubjects tho&s;e who&s;e feet are expo|&s;ed to the &s;loppy colliquation, to Colds, Ca|tarrhs, Coughs, and their con&s;equences.</P></Q>
<P>MR. Kalm remarks, that at "Albany the wind blows commonly from the &s;outh in Summer, and brings a great drought along with it. Sometimes it rains a little, after which the wind veers to N. W. blowing for &s;everal days from that point, and then re|turning to the &s;outh." <HI>See</HI> Kalm's Travels, Vol. II. page 243.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame gentleman informs us, that the cold is generally very &s;evere on the river Hud|&s;on; at Albany, in the middle of winter, the ice is &s;ometimes three or four feet thick. "On the 3d of April, 1749, &s;ome of the inha|bitants
<PB N="52" REF="024239_0058_0FC572A32C2FA540">
cro&s;&s;ed the river with &s;ix pair of hor&s;es. The ice commonly di&s;&s;olves here about the latter end of March or beginning of April. The water at this time, &s;ome years, ri&s;es three fathom higher than it commonly is in &s;um|mer. The inhabitants make no u&s;e of &s;toves, and their chimneys are &s;o wide as to admit a cart and hor&s;es to be driven through them.</P>
<P>"THE water of the wells (continues Mr. Kalm) in this town was very cool, when I was there in June 1749, but had a kind of acid ta&s;te, which was not very agreeable. It al&s;o contained a number of little in&s;ects which were probably <HI>Monoculi:</HI> The&s;e in|&s;ects were from one and an half geometrical line to four in length."</P>
<P>MR. Kalm thinks this water not whole|&s;ome, but the inhabitants who drink it every day, do not feel the lea&s;t inconvenience from it. Albany is about 146 miles from New|York.</P>
<Q><P>THE Rheumati&s;m and Pleuri&s;y are the mo&s;t common di&s;ea&s;es in this part of Ame|rica.
<PB N="53" REF="024239_0059_0FC572A79DBC3A78">
Intermittents and Dy&s;enteries are &s;el|dom heard of. The Phlogi&s;tic Diathe&s;is is &s;o prevalent, that the phy&s;icians u&s;e venae&s;ec|tion for almo&s;t every complaint, and at every &s;ea&s;on of the year.</P>
<P>THE exce&s;&s;ive heat, however, which prevails here from the middle of July to the latter end of Augu&s;t, &s;ometimes gives ri&s;e to fevers attended with very anomalous &s;ymp|toms, which often baffle the &s;agacity of the mo&s;t experienced practitioners.</P></Q>

<HEAD>The following Information re&s;pecting the Di&s;|ea&s;es, depending on Climate and &s;ituation was communicated to the Author by Dr. John Jones of Philadelphia, formerly Profe&s;&s;or of Surge|ry, &amp;c. at King's College, New-York&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DR.

<P>IN Autumn there &s;eldom or ever occurs any epidemic which can be a&s;cribed to the influence of the climate or &s;ituation, except Diarrhoeas, accompanied with Griping; but the&s;e are rather &s;poradic than epidemic, ex|cept when a rainy Autumn &s;ucceeds a hot and dry Summer."

<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of the Quality of the WATER at PHILADELPHIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE greate&s;t part of the pump-water of Philadelphia, which is the only kind that is drank or made u&s;e of for tea-water, or culinary purpo&s;es by the inhabitants, is im|pregnated with &s;elenite, or a combination of mineral acid with calcareous earth.</P>
<P>WHEN this water boils, a whiti&s;h powder is &s;eparated from it, which forms a cru&s;t on all the ve&s;&s;els in which it is frequently boil|ed.</P>
<P>THIS water is called hard, becau&s;e it does not mix uniformly with &s;oap, but curdles or runs into flakes.</P>
<P>A SMALL quantity of the &s;al. tartari, or clean dry pot-a&s;h, added to this water pre|cipitates the &s;elenite contained in it. Ten or fifteen grains are commonly &s;ufficient to pre|cipitate what is contained in a pint. The exact proportion may always be found by ad|ding
<PB N="68" REF="024239_0074_0FC572D02FD66620">
a few grains from time to time till it cea&s;es to occa&s;ion white clouds.</P>
<P>THIS water is very di&s;agreeable to the pa|lates of mo&s;t people who re&s;ide at a di&s;tance from the city, and is &s;ometimes offen&s;ive to their &s;tomachs and bowels. But cu&s;tom has rendered it both agreeable and whole&s;ome to the inhabitants; &s;o that they have not a wi&s;h for any other.</P>
<P>IT is a common opinion that water im|pregnated with calcareous earth, or any &s;to|ny matter, &s;ubjects tho&s;e who make con&s;tant u&s;e of it to the Stone or Gravel. But what|ever other mi&s;chief the&s;e waters may have to an&s;wer for, they are innocent of this. For very few, comparatively, of the inhabitants of this city are troubled with that di&s;ea&s;e.

<P>THE river Delaware was frozen over near three months during the Winter of 1780: The thickne&s;s of the ice in the river, near the city of Philadelphia, was from 16 to 19 inches, and the depth of the fro&s;t in the ground was from four to five feet, according to the expo&s;ure of the ground and the qua|lity of the &s;oil.</P>

year, which rendered the Delaware naviga|ble for a few days.</P>
<P>THE Summer which &s;ucceeded the Win|ter of 1780, was uniformly warm. The mercury in the thermometer, during this Summer, &s;tood on one day, the 15th of Au|gu&s;t, at 95&deg;, and fluctuated between 93 and 80&deg; for many weeks. The thermometer &s;tood in the &s;hade in the open air.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;eldom more than 20 or 30 days in Summer or Winter, in Penn&s;ylva|nia, in which the mercury ri&s;es above 80&deg; in the former, or falls below 30&deg; in the lat|ter &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE warme&s;t part of the day, in Summer, is at 2 o'clock in ordinary, and at 3 in the afternoon in extremely warm weather.&mdash;From the&s;e hours the heat gradually dimi|ni&s;hes till the en&s;uing morning.&mdash;The cool|e&s;t part of the 24 hours is at the break of day.</P>

When the Mercury is at 80&deg; it generally falls to 68&deg; while it de&s;cends when at 60&deg; only to 56&deg;. This di&s;proportion between the temperature of the day and night in Summer, is always greate&s;t in the month of Augu&s;t. The dews at this time are heavy in proportion to the coolne&s;s of the evening: They are &s;ome|times &s;o con&s;iderable as to wet the clothes; and there are in&s;tances, in which mar&s;h-mea|dows, and even creeks, which have been dry during the Summer, have been &s;upplied with their u&s;ual waters, from no other &s;ource than the dews which have fallen in this month, or in the fir&s;t weeks of September. There is another circum&s;tance connected with the one ju&s;t mentioned, which contributes very much to mitigate the heat of Summer; and that is, it &s;eldom continues more than two or three days very great without being &s;ucceeded by &s;howers of

<Q><P>THOUGH the Sun (&s;ays Doctor Hugh William&s;on) is doubtle&s;s the general &s;ource of heat, yet we ob&s;erve that countries are not heated in proportion to their di&s;tance from the Sun, nor in proportion to their di&s;tance from the Equator. When the rays of the Sun &s;trike the earth in a perpendicular direc|tion, they will be reflected in the &s;ame direc|tion on the particles of the air through which they have pa&s;&s;ed, and thus increa&s;e their heat.</P>

<P>AIR is ob&s;erved to be heated to very different degrees in different countries, which are in the &s;ame latitude, according as they abound in rough mountains, fertile plains, or &s;andy de&s;ert, as they are &s;urrounded by land or by &s;ea, or according to the different winds which prevail in tho&s;e countries. The temperature of Penn&s;ylvania is very different from that of Portugal; and that of England is different from that of Saxony, on the neigh|bouring continent, though they are under the &s;ame parallels. In order then, to form a judgment of the climate of any country, we mu&s;t not only con&s;ider the latitude of the place, but al&s;o the face and condition of the country, and the winds mo&s;t prevalent there at the different &s;ea&s;ons of the year; if any of the&s;e &s;hould change, the climate mu&s;t al&s;o be changed more or le&s;s, for it is in a great mea|&s;ure governed by the&s;e.</P>

<P>A TRANSIENT view of the cau&s;e of winds will convince us that their cour&s;e may al&s;o be changed.</P>
<P>IT is well known that mo&s;t winds are occa&s;ioned by the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P>WERE the Sun to &s;tand &s;till over any part of the &s;urface of the earth, the wind would con&s;tantly blow to that place from all directions: For the air in that part being ra|rified by the heat of the Sun, would be ex|panded, and thus become &s;pecifically lighter, whence it would a&s;cend, and the heavier air in the neighbouring parts, would ru&s;h into its place; this too being heated by the Sun's rays, and by the warm &s;urface of the earth,

<P>BUT as the Sun moves, or &s;eems to move between the tropics, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, there would be a con&s;tant current of air &s;eting towards the Sun from the N. S. and E. while the current, which would al&s;o come from the we&s;t, is prevented or turned back by the Sun, which moves with great rapidity in an op|po&s;ite direction.

all &s;mooth dry land, the ea&s;terly winds would always prevail quite round the globe to &s;ome di&s;tance beyond the tropics. But the waters along the equator are divided by two or three con&s;iderable portions of land, which retain the heat in a different manner from the wa|ter, and reflect the Sun's rays in very differ|ent proportions, &s;o that they not only &s;top the ea&s;terly current of air, but often change it to the oppo&s;ite direction. For along the we&s;terly coa&s;t of Africa and South America, the winds commonly blow from the we&s;t; that is, they blow from a cold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urface to that which is warmer, from the &s;ea upon the land. In warm countries, or in the warm &s;ea&s;ons of any country, the &s;urface of the land is warmer than the &s;urface of the wa|ter. [But the rever&s;e is the ca&s;e in cold countries, and in cold &s;ea&s;ons of any country, without the tropics.]</P>
<P>The &s;urface of the earth being immove|ably expo&s;ed to the &s;un, receives and retains the heat, and grows warmer by every addi|tional ray. The &s;urface of the &s;ea is not &s;oon heated., becau&s;e the particles which are

uppermo&s;t this hour, will pre&s;ently be over|whelmed by tho&s;e that are colder, and the&s;e by others in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e trite and general ob&s;erva|tions re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of winds, the rea|&s;on is obvious, why north we&s;t winds prevail during the winter &s;ea&s;on, in a country lying, as this does, in a direction nearly from the N. E. to the S. W.&mdash;The &s;urface of the earth at this &s;ea&s;on being always colder than that of the &s;ea. To this may be added, that our coa&s;t is con&s;tantly wa&s;hed by a current of warm water, which being driven to the we&s;t by the ea&s;terly trade-winds near the equator, is checked in the gulf of Mexico, and forced to e&s;cape to the north ea&s;tward to give place to the &s;ucceeding current.</P>
<P>LET us now enquire, whether any change of circum&s;tances would reduce the violence of the&s;e north we&s;t winds, which prevail in Winter.</P>
<P>IT has been proved by experiments, that hard and &s;mooth &s;urfaces, receive, re|tain,
<PB N="86" REF="024239_0092_0FC56FBD9495D238">
and reflect heat, better than tho&s;e which are &s;oft, rough, or unequal; and a clear, &s;mooth, plain field, e&s;pecially if &s;andy and dry, is ob&s;erved to reflect more heat than one that is covered with trees, bu&s;hes, or gra&s;s, and more particularly if the &s;oil is moi&s;t."&mdash;It has al&s;o been di&s;covered that a &s;imple &s;olution of water in air always pro|duces a &s;en&s;ible increa&s;e of cold.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e premi&s;es e&s;tabli&s;hed on ex|periments and ob&s;ervation, it may be ration|ally concluded, that when in the cour&s;e of time, this continent becomes populated, cleared, cultivated, improved, and the moi&s;|ture of the &s;oil exhau&s;ted far into the frozen regions of the north, that the bleak winds will become more mild, and the Winters le&s;s cold in the middle &s;tates, but more e&s;pecially in tho&s;e to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>WHAT Philo&s;ophy teaches us to expect in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, appears to be confirm|ed by what has happened in the climate of Italy. The temperature of which, we are
<PB N="87" REF="024239_0093_0FC56FBEF0734A30">
a&s;&s;ured from unexceptionable authority, is at pre&s;ent much more mild than it was when Virgil wrote his Georgics. This change of climate Dr. William&s;on a&s;cribes to the po|pulation and con&s;equent culture which has gradually taken place in the more northern countries of Europe.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be apprehended, that if the cultivation, and levelling a country, would mitigate the &s;everity of the Winters, it would increa&s;e the <HI>heat</HI> of the Summers in a proportionate degree. But common ob&s;er|vation, as well as the principles of Philo&s;o|phy, &s;hew that there is no foundation for &s;uch apprehen&s;ion. For during the greate&s;t Summer heats it it found, that the extraor|dinary heat of the atmo&s;phere does not ri&s;e to any con&s;iderable height, and in the upper re|ons it is perpetually cold, both becau&s;e the air in tho&s;e regions is too remote from the earth to be warmed by the heat reflected from its &s;urface, and becau&s;e the air in tho&s;e higher regions, not being pre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch a weight of incumbent atmo&s;phere, is too rare to be &s;u&s;ceptible of a great degree of heat.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="024239_0094_0FC56FC0735192C0">
HENCE it is evident, that nothing is wanting, in the mid&s;t of Summer, to render the country agreeably cool, but a proper mix|ture of the cold air which is above, with the warm air below. This may be effected by any cau&s;e which increa&s;es the winds, &s;uch as &s;howers of rain, thunder gu&s;ts, and the cool|er air of mountains pre&s;&s;ing towards more heated parts, to re&s;tore the equilibrium, a|greeable to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of matter and motion.</P>
<P>FROM all the circum&s;tances which have been mentioned, there is no unrea&s;onable pro&s;pect (and I am &s;ure it is a very plea&s;ing one), that when this country comes to be di|ver&s;ified by va&s;t tracts of clear land, inter|&s;ected by ridges of rude mountains, the land winds in Summer, to &s;ay nothing of tho&s;e which come from the &s;ea, or from the lakes, charged with moi&s;ture, mu&s;t certainly be much purer and &s;alutary, as well as tempe|rate and uniform, than they are at pre&s;ent.</P>

&s;ea&s;on of the year.&mdash;<HI>See</HI> Linds' E&s;&s;ay on Hot Climates.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the ob&s;ervations of Mr. Reinhold Fo&s;ter, it is not only the clearing of woods, but cultivation and population, that alter the climate of a country, and make it mild and temperate. "The Romans look|ed upon the winters of Germany and Eng|land as very &s;evere; but happily both coun|tries have at pre&s;ent a much more mild cli|mate than formerly, owing to the three cir|cum&s;tances above-mentioned.</P>
<P>"NEAR Peter&s;burgh, under 60&deg; N. L. the river Neva, was covered with ice in 1765, in the beginning of December, and cleared of it April 11th, 1766. At T&s;arit&s;in, which is under 48&deg; 40. N. L. the river Volga was covered with ice the 26th of November, 1765, and the ice broke in the river, April 27th, 1766 (all old &s;tile). Is it not almo&s;t incredible, that in a place almo&s;t 12 de|grees nearer to the &s;outh, the effects of cold &s;hould be felt longer and more &s;everely than
<PB N="92" REF="024239_0098_0FC56FCD42036568">
in the more northern climate? And though the neighbourhood of Peter&s;burgh has a great many woods, the cold was, however, le&s;s &s;evere and la&s;ting: T&s;arit&s;in, on the con|trary, has no woods for many hundred miles in its neighbourhood, if we except &s;ome few trees and bu&s;hes along the Volga and its i&s;les, and the low land along it; wherever the eye looks to the ea&s;t, there are va&s;t plains without woods, for many hundred miles.</P>
<P>THE clearing a country of woods cannot, therefore, alone contribute &s;o much to make the climate milder, but cultivation does more. In an hundred &s;quare miles near T&s;arit&s;in, there is not &s;o much cultivated land as there is within ten miles of Peter&s;burgh; it is in proportion to the number of the inhabitants of both places, and this makes the chief dif|ference of the climate. There is &s;till another con&s;ideration; Peter&s;burgh lies near the &s;ea, and T&s;arit&s;in in an inland country, and, ge|nerally &s;peaking, countries near the &s;ea have been ob&s;erved to enjoy a milder climate. The&s;e few remarks will be, I believe, &s;uf|ficient
<PB N="93" REF="024239_0099_0FC56FCEB2025A58">
to enable every body to judge of the changes of the climate in various countries, which, no doubt, grow warmer and more temperate as cultivation and population in|crea&s;e.</P>
<P>MR. Kalm (in Vol. II. p. 249) &s;ays, the corn near Quebec, in Canada, formerly was never ripe till the 15th or 16th of Septem|ber; but that for &s;ome years previous to the year 1749, the harve&s;t began in the la&s;t week of Augu&s;t (old &s;tile).&mdash;The inhabitants al&s;o informed him, that formerly the corn never ripened; but &s;ince the woods have been &s;uf|ficiently cleared, the beams of the &s;un have had more room to operate, and it ripens perfectly.</P>

<P>THE Influenza, or contagious Catarrh, has been epidemic in America three differ|ent times. The fir&s;t time of its appearance that I can find recorded, was in the Autumn of 1733; previous to which it had &s;pread over every country in Europe, beginning in the North of Germany. From Europe it ap|pears to have been imported into America. It was again ob&s;erved, and recorded particu|larly by Dr. Thomas Bond, in 1761. At that time its progre&s;s was traced from the We&s;t India i&s;lands to Halifax in Nova-Sco|tia, where it appeared in the Spring; from thence it reached Bo&s;ton, and the neighbour|ing &s;tates, and afterwards &s;pread in a mo&s;t

rapid manner over the whole continent of North America, without being retarded in its progre&s;s by any alteration in the &s;en&s;ible qualities of the atmo&s;phere or the cour&s;e of the winds, till the month of July, after which it was no more heard of.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e made its appearance a third time in America, in 1789. It was fir&s;t ob&s;er|ved at New-York, in September, from whence it &s;pread, in the cour&s;e of &s;ix or eight weeks, over every part of the union, and pa&s;|&s;ed to &s;everal of the We&s;t-India I&s;lands; but whether it proceeded to the Spani&s;h &s;ettle|ments in South America, or whether the Aborigines of North America were affected by it, I have not been able to learn. Per|&s;ons of all ages and de&s;criptions were affected by it in Philadelphia; and its contagious ef|fects were &s;o uncommonly rapid, that many &s;uppo&s;ed its cau&s;e was blended with, or &s;u&s;|pended in the atmo&s;phere, and conveyed by the winds; but the analogy of every other &s;pecies of contagion contradicts this &s;uppo|&s;ition. Its continuance in Philadelphia was

about &s;ix weeks: how it was generated, or from whence it was derived, I have not been able to inform my&s;elf. The origin of this di&s;ea&s;e appears to be as ob&s;cure as that of the Small Pox or Mea&s;les. The fir&s;t account of its appearance in Europe, upon record, was in the year 1557, at which time its progre&s;s was traced from A&s;ia to Con&s;tantinople, &amp;c. The &s;ymptoms in general re&s;embled the com|mon Catarrh from taking cold; but it differed from it materially in being attended, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, with a con&s;iderable pro&s;tration of &s;trength, and impaired vigour in all the func|tions of the body.</P>
<P>I WAS always guided in my practice by the &s;ymptoms pre&s;ent, and do not recollect a ca&s;e that did not do well: The &s;ymptoms were &s;o mild with multitudes, that they re|quired no medicinal aid.

<P>"FROM the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful enquiries I have been able to make, I have found that the Influenza prevailed in this coun|try in the year 1733. It was again epidemic in the year 1749. This la&s;t information I received <HI>indirectly</HI> from the late Dr. Barnet of Elizabeth Town; who added, that the univer&s;al re|medy for it among the common people, was a drink compo&s;ed of a jill of vinegar, a pint of water, and two table &s;poonfulls of mela&s;&s;es. It appeared again in the &s;pring of the year 1761, and was both violent and univer&s;al. I recollect all its &s;ymp|toms perfectly, it being the fir&s;t year I began the &s;tudy of medicine. It was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of "this Cold," and "the great Cold." Dr. Gilchri&s;t, takes notice of it in the Phy&s;ical and Literary E&s;&s;ays of Edinburgh. Notwith&s;tand|ing this epidemic was &s;o univer&s;al as to check bu&s;ine&s;s in ma|ny places, and to exclude all other &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation, yet I was lately &s;urprized to find only three of the citizens of Philadelphia, who had retained a di&s;tinct recollection of it. Dr. Shoe&s;t, in his travels through North America, mentions it upon the authority of the late Dr. Thomas Bond.</P>
<P>"THE Influenza made its next appearance in the Winter, 1770-1; an account of which I have pre&s;erved in my note|book, and have found it to agree exactly with the hi&s;tories of the Influenza in this and other countries. I need not mention to you its appearance in the Autumn of 1789. My inquiries and ob&s;ervations &s;atisfy me, that it appeared again in the Spring of 1790, and in the Winter of 1790-1. I &s;hall not trouble you with a detail of the facts upon which I ground this a&s;&s;ertion, as I have prepared a full account of them to be laid before the public in a 2d vol. of Medical Enquiries, which I am now preparing for the pre&s;s."</P></NOTE>.</P>

THE Hydrophobia is &s;o rare an occurence here that I have never &s;een a ca&s;e of it. Dr. Ru&s;h and Dr. Percival have, in my opinion, thrown more light on the nature of this di&s;|ea&s;e than any other writers.</P>
<P>THE accounts which have been publi&s;hed re&s;pecting the fa&s;cinating power of Snakes in this country, have originated in ignorance and credulity, and are entirely groundle&s;s; as well as tho&s;e tales which are often told of their breeding in the livers of Dogs which have been bitten by them.</P>

fatal to men, or the larger cla&s;s of ani|mals, though it in&s;tantly kills &s;mall ones: hence a pre&s;umption ari&s;es, that the remedies employed by the Indians owe their credit to ignorance of this circum&s;tance. According to the la&s;t quoted writer, the immediate ap|plication of Lunar Cau&s;tic, to a part bitten by a Snake, prevents it from having any ill effect: This produces an e&s;char, and a con|&s;iderable wound, which is afterwards to be dre&s;&s;ed with common Cerate.</P>
<P>FEWER di&s;ea&s;es prevail in Autumn, when the ground is frequently refre&s;hed by &s;how|ers, and the ponds are repleni&s;hed with wa|ter, than in dry ones. This circum&s;tance is thus explained by Dr. Ru&s;h<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is remarked by Dr. Percival, "that wet &s;ea&s;ons are generally more free from epidemic di&s;ea&s;es, than dry ones.

<P>DAILY ob&s;ervation teaches us, that the generality of the di&s;ea&s;es ju&s;t mentioned, to which men of fa&s;hion and opulence are mo&s;t &s;ubject, proceed from exce&s;&s;ive indulgence in the plea&s;ures of the table, and in drinking wine and other liquors to exce&s;s, joined to the want of proper exerci&s;e&mdash;do&s;ing away the &s;alutary hours of the morning in bed; re|&s;piring

<P>By the joint effects of intemperance and indolence, the dige&s;tion &s;ooner or later never fails of being impaired. And as on the due performance of dige&s;tion, much of our health, ea&s;e, and pro&s;pect of longevity de|pends, we ought mo&s;t &s;tudiou&s;ly to avoid every thing that has a probable chance of in|terrupting it.</P>
<P>THE quality of Aliment mo&s;t whole&s;ome, may generally be determined by the experi|ence of each individual: The principal in|convenience ari&s;es from quantity.</P>
<P>THE judicious Dr. Fothergill ob&s;erves, that "the Author of Nature, has &s;o form|ed and con&s;tructed the organs of dige&s;tion, that we can gradually accommodate our|&s;elves to every &s;pecies of Aliment.

<P>No kind of food hurts us, if gradually ac|cu&s;tomed to it; but this is not the ca&s;e in re|gard to quantity. From errors in this, in a great mea&s;ure, proceed the formidable proge|ny which have already been enumerated.</P>
<P>"IN a weak &s;tomach, a large proportion of bread is indige&s;tible; it turns four, produces Heart-burn, Flatulencies, Spa&s;modic pains, &amp;c. Valetudinarians &s;hould therefore always u&s;e it with moderation."</P>
<P>IN Philadelphia animal food, of one kind or other, con&s;titutes the chief part of our nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>THAT there are &s;ome kinds of more ea&s;y, &s;ome of harder dige&s;tion than others, is well known to every body. The mo&s;t difficult of the&s;e, will be dige&s;ted without occa&s;ioning much di&s;turbance, if taken in &s;mall quanti|ties;

<P>AFTER a plentiful dinner of animal food, it is now the cu&s;tom here, to introduce de&s;erts of rich Sweet-Meats, Cu&s;tards, Jellies, and Fruits, and of various kinds; all of which at &s;uch time is unnatural and improper, becau&s;e of the extraordinary &s;timulus &s;uch a load of heterogeneous &s;ub&s;tances mu&s;t give to the fi|bres of the &s;tomach, both in a mechanical and chemical &s;en&s;e. "By the&s;e means fre&s;h labour is added to a tired dige&s;tion." The rule where fa&s;hion cannot altogether be di&s;|pen&s;ed with, is carefully to ob&s;erve, that the &s;um of all together, does not exceed due bounds, or encroach upon the fir&s;t feelings of &s;atiety.</P>

<P>THE following is a copy of a letter from Dr. B. Ru&s;h, dated January 19th, 1791.</P>
<Q><P>THE &s;low Nervous Fever, as de&s;cribed by Dr. Huxham, was a very common di&s;ea&s;e in Philadelphia, during my apprentice&s;hip, (from the year 1760 to 1766) al&s;o for many years after, I &s;ettled in the city, which was in the year 1769.</P>
<P>THE late Dr. Thomas Cadwallader, who died in the year 1779, in the 71&s;t year of his age, informed me, that he remembered the time when that &s;pecies of Fever made its fir&s;t appearance among our citizens, and that it had gradually travelled here from Connec|ticut, where it was known by the name of the <HI>Long Fever.</HI> It was very common during
<PB N="121" REF="024239_0127_0FC57022CF8E1DE0">
the late war, and appeared to be kept up by the intercour&s;e of our city with the American Ho&s;pitals and Briti&s;h Pri&s;on Ships. During the la&s;t &s;even years it has gradually di&s;ap|peared. In the cour&s;e of the three la&s;t years. I have &s;een but few ca&s;es of it. It was very remarkable, that it never made its appearance in our city until the weather became cool. I have &s;u&s;pected from this circum&s;tance, that it always had a portion of inflammatory, or what Dr. Cullen calls Synochoid Diathe&s;is, mixed with it.</P>
<P>IN July, the exciting cau&s;es of Fever &s;eem to produce Cholera Morbus; in Augu&s;t and September, Remitting Fevers, with bili|ous di&s;charges; and in October and Novem|ber, the &s;low Nervous Fever, of Dr. Hux|ham.</P>
<P>THE di&s;appearance of this Fever is proba|bly owing to the greater attention which has been paid latterly to cleanline&s;s and fre&s;h air, by all cla&s;&s;es of people, both in &s;ickne&s;s and

The remote cau&s;e of this Fever, I have &s;upo&s;ed to be <HI>Contagion,</HI> either from a di&s;ea&s;ed body, or from a morbid matter ge|nerated in the extremities of the arteries from low diet, the want of cleanline&s;s, and above all from that languor which is induced upon the circulation, by grief, or any other &s;edative pa&s;&s;ion of the mind. I think too I have &s;een this Fever where it evidently aro&s;e from a neglected or ill-treated inflammatory Fever, in which neither of the above cau&s;es has operated. In this ca&s;e it has occured in the Winter and Spring. In the latter &s;ea&s;on, I have &s;een it &s;ucceed Pleuri&s;y, and accom|panied through all its duration by the &s;ame kind of trouble&s;ome Cough, which occurs in the la&s;t &s;tage of that di&s;ea&s;e, when it ari&s;es from other cau&s;es.</P></Q>
<P>MANY ca&s;es have come under the author's notice of per&s;ons of an infirm habit falling into the &s;low Nervous Fever, or Typhus Mi|tior,
<PB N="123" REF="024239_0129_0FC57025F2EDC3F8">
after having been debilitated more than common by fatigue and grief, without being expo&s;ed to contagion, but only in con&s;e|quence of a &s;udden check of per&s;piration. Hence it appears that the &s;ame remote cau&s;e produces a different form of di&s;ea&s;e, according to the difference of con&s;titution on which it operates.</P>
<P>THE combined debilitating effects of fa|tigue and grief are very common cau&s;es of this Fever, in per&s;ons of relaxed and infirm Con&s;titutions, and it appears to depend intire|ly upon a diminution of nervous energy, but is mo&s;t commonly the effect of infectious efflu|via. <HI>See</HI> Dr. Hunter's opinion re&s;pecting the effects of vitiated air in producing Nervous Fever, in the London Medical Tran&s;ac|tions.</P>
<P>THE Pulmonary Con&s;umption appears to be the mo&s;t frequent, as well as the mo&s;t fatal of the Chronic Di&s;ea&s;es which occur in Phila|delphia. The greate&s;t proportion of tho&s;e who die of this malady, from the mo&s;t ac|curate
<PB N="124" REF="024239_0130_0FC57028AD826018">
ob&s;ervations which I have been able to make, belong to the &s;ociety of the Friends; and of the&s;e, the number is nearly in the proportion of three females to one male.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the want of vivacity in the peo|ple of this &s;ociety, and the &s;edentary lives of their females, are the principal cau&s;es of this difference; the&s;e certainly in &s;ome mea&s;ure counter-balance the advantages which they enjoy from their &s;uperior cleanline&s;s, neat|ne&s;s, and &s;obriety.</P>
<P>THE late judicious and experienced Dr. Fothergill, in my opinion, has given the be&s;t directions for the &s;ucce&s;sful treatment of the Pulmonary Con&s;umption of any author that has written on the &s;ubject. <HI>See</HI> his Works in Quarto, publi&s;hed by J. Cokely Lett&s;om, M. D.</P>
<P>THE method of treating this complaint by the daily exhibition of Pukes, as recom|mended by Dr. Reid, is in general a very injudicious and pernicious one. The one
<PB N="125" REF="024239_0131_0FC57029709ECAE8">
recommended by the late Dr. Brown, is &s;till more exceptionable.</P>
<P>THE improvements propo&s;ed by Dr. Ru&s;h, I have never had an opportunity of &s;eeing put in practice; but have had con|&s;iderable experience of the good effects pro|duced by ob&s;erving the method recommend|ed by Dr. Fothergill, particularly in the in|cipient &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e. When the di&s;|ea&s;e is contracted in a northern climate, the patient &s;hould always pa&s;s his Winters, if po&s;&s;ible, in a climate within the tropics.</P>

<P>THE Cholera generally came on in the

night time, or after a change from very hot to con&s;iderably cooler weather, whereby a &s;udden check was given to the per&s;piration, and the nervous &s;y&s;tem amazingly debili|tated.</P>
<P>A FEW drops of Laudanum, in a Pepper|mint or Cinnamon Julep, frequently repeat|ed; &s;pirituous fomentations to the abdomen, applied very warm, and the application of heated Flannels to the extremities, &s;carce ever failed of curing the Cholera; having fir&s;t favored the evacuation of the bilious matter from the &s;tomach, by frequent draughts of Camomile Tea, or Coffee made of toa&s;ted Oatmeal.</P>
<P>THE Diarrhaea (if indubitable &s;igns of laxity and debility are pre&s;ent) can only be cured by tonics, &s;pirituous drinks, warm cloathing, cleanline&s;s, pure air, and moder|ate exerci&s;e, with the occa&s;ional u&s;e of Lau|danum, in very &s;mall but frequent do&s;es, and a regimen of very ea&s;y dige&s;tion, and of an Alkaline quality.</P>

A STRONG decoction of Peruvian Bark, with the addition of a little powder of Galls and Cinnamon, given in &s;mall draughts re|peatedly in the day time, and a &s;mall do&s;e of Paregoric Elixir at night, has &s;ucceeded in numerous ca&s;es after &s;tronger a&s;tringents, Aromatics and Ab&s;orbents, had failed.</P>
<P>A decoction of Rice, Cinnamon, and a lit|tle Chalk makes a very &s;uitable drink.</P>
<P>WHEN a child has a Fever or a Diarrhaea, the complaint is generally a&s;cribed to worms, even by tho&s;e who ought to know better. The &s;ufferer is therefore compelled to take &s;omething to de&s;troy Worms, when nine times in ten none exi&s;t; or if they do, they are by no means the cau&s;e of Fever, at lea&s;t they are never the direct or exciting cau&s;e.

of the bowels and &s;canty mucous &s;tools continued, and afterwards occa&s;ionally if the morbid &s;ymptoms returned.</P>

<P>WHEN the patient's &s;trength was not greatly impaired, he was confined to mild cooling drinks, acidulated with Lemon Juice, or &s;yrup of Tamarinds; and his diet was Spoon Meats without Wine or Spices, and all the ripe and juicy Fruits of the &s;ea&s;on.

<P>WHEN the griping was very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and the rectum appeared excoriated, Gli&s;ters of Barley Water and Gum Arabic were oc|ca&s;ionally injected, to which were frequently added a few drops of Laudanum.

<P>As &s;oon as the griping was removed, a decoction of Cortex Peruv. with eight or ten drops of Elixir Vitrioli, was admini&s;tered four or five times a day, a more liberal u&s;e of Wine directed, and an Anodyne continued at night. To prevent a relap&s;e, exerci&s;e, and

a Flannel Ve&s;t, &amp;c. with other warm cloath|ing, were recommended.</P>
<P>THIS, and this alone, is the only certain and &s;ucce&s;sful method of treating the Dy&s;en|tery, when it is an Idiopathic di&s;ea&s;e. I never &s;aw a ca&s;e where Bli&s;ters were of any real &s;ervice, except when the di&s;ea&s;e was on|ly &s;ymptomatic, or combined with the Inter|mitting or Remitting Fever, which is &s;eldom or never the ca&s;e in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>THE method of treating this di&s;ea&s;e by diffu&s;ible &s;timulants and a cordial diet, re|commended by the late Dr. Brown, and by the &s;weating proce&s;s, recommended by Dr. Mo&s;ely, in his Treati&s;e on Tropical Di&s;ea&s;es, I have &s;een prove injurious in &s;everal in|&s;tances, and believe they can &s;eldom or ever &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Two ca&s;es of Peripneumony came under my ob&s;ervation this month. The one was a man 56 years of age; he was attacked with the di&s;ea&s;e, a &s;hort time after leaving off a
<PB N="140" REF="024239_0146_0FC570510B108500">
Flannel Shirt, which he had worn all the pre|ceding &s;ea&s;on. The other was a delicate woman, the mother of &s;everal children, who appeared much di&s;po&s;ed to Phthi&s;is Pulmo|nalis. The di&s;ea&s;e was occa&s;ioned with her, by &s;itting a con&s;iderable time in a cool Spring-Hou&s;e, when much heated and fa|tigued.</P>
<P>THE man died, owing, I believe, to the delay of his friends in making application for his relief. His Thorax was opened, and an ab&s;ce&s;s di&s;covered in the right Lobe of the Lungs, and marks of Gangrene in the Pleura, in con&s;equence of the high inflam|mation with which it had been affected early in the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THE woman was blooded four times, by which &s;he lo&s;t 36 ounces of blood-was put upon the Antiphlogi&s;tic Regimen, purged moderately for two or three days with Salts and Tartar Emetic; and after the &s;econd bleeding, had a large Bli&s;ter Pla&s;ter applied over the affected part.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="024239_0147_0FC5705701C896B8">
IN every ca&s;e of Pleuri&s;y, the patient &s;hould be blooded every day, more or le&s;s, according to the violence of the Pain, Fever and &s;trength of the Pul&s;e, and where tho&s;e &s;ymptoms are very violent, twice a-day (without regard to the &s;tate of the expecto|ration), as well as freely purged, till the Fever, Pain and fulne&s;s of the Pul&s;e be all con&s;iderably reduced. The patient &s;hould at the &s;ame time &s;trictly ob&s;erve the Anti|phlogi&s;tic Regimen&mdash;Have his chamber con|&s;tantly refre&s;hed with cooler air than would be agreeable in time of health, if the &s;ea&s;on will admit, and not be oppre&s;&s;ed with bed|cloaths&mdash;His bed and body linen daily &s;hift|ed&mdash;All his drinks &s;hould be taken about the temperature of Spring Water, or at mo&s;t not warmer than a Toa&s;t will make it.</P>

"THIS month was dry and cool; the mornings generally foggy. The dews which fell in the evenings and during the night, were very copious, and in a great mea&s;ure made up for the deficiency of rain."</P>
<P>THE frequent changes in the temperature of the air, particularly from extreme heat to extraordinary cold, gave ri&s;e to a great va|riety of di&s;ea&s;es of a very different nature; but the u&s;ual epidemic of the &s;ea&s;on, the Bilious Remitting Fever, as it is called, was by far the mo&s;t common.</P>
<P>I SHALL here take the opportunity of giving a de&s;cription of the &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e, and of making public the remedies and method of treatment which I have found mo&s;t certain and &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>THE Bilious Remitting Fever, which is more or le&s;s epidemic at Philadelphia every year in Autumn, begins with a &s;en&s;e of general debility; wearine&s;s, and pain in the back and loins; giddine&s;s of the head, lo&s;s
<PB N="144" REF="024239_0150_0FC5705D351923C0">
of appetite; inclination to Puke; chilline&s;s, &s;ucceeded by flu&s;hes of heat; di&s;tention of Stomach; &s;ome perceptible unea&s;ine&s;s in re&s;piration; quick &s;mall irregular Pul&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE &s;ymptoms generally continue three or four days, and &s;ometimes longer, before the patient is confined to bed. After that, the Feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms become con&s;iderable in the afternoon, but always remit more or le&s;s before morning. With the remi&s;&s;ion, the &s;kin, which during the Paroxi&s;m was dry and hot, becomes moi&s;t and cooler; but &s;till &s;ome quickne&s;s and irregularity continue in the Pul&s;e, &s;ome Thir&s;t, and other &s;light &s;ymptoms of Fever.</P>
<P>THE Paroxi&s;m returns commonly about noon or &s;oon after, without any chill or &s;haking, but is often preceded with a di&s;a|greeable and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;e of cold and anxiety about the Precordia, which gradually &s;ub&s;ide when the Paroxi&s;m is completely formed. While the Paroxi&s;m is forming, a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and violent puking often comes
<PB N="145" REF="024239_0151_0FC5705EAED15618">
on, and &s;ometimes a very weakening Diar|rhaea. The matter evacuated is commonly mixed with bile, and is &s;ometimes very green and corro&s;ive.</P>
<P>THE Tongue is covered from the begin|ing with a whiti&s;h mucus, which in the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, if the &s;ymptoms of general debility continue to increa&s;e, and the remi&s;&s;ions become more indi&s;tinct, as is of|ten the ca&s;e, becomes dry and hard, and of a dark brown colour&mdash;a dark coloured &s;ordes al&s;o gathers about the teeth and gums.</P>
<P>IN this manner the Fever generally conti|nues, with an increa&s;e of the &s;ymptoms in the afternoon and great part of the night, with a remi&s;&s;ion or abatement of the &s;ame in the morning, till in a longer or &s;horter period, it ends either in complete and di&s;|tinct intermi&s;&s;ions, or degenerates into a continued form.</P>
<P>WHEN it degenerates into the continued form, it re&s;embles the Typhus or Putrid Fe|ver
<PB N="146" REF="024239_0152_0FC57060595AEBC8">
in all its &s;ymptoms, but differs from it e&s;&s;entially in not being contagious.</P>
<P>MANY Phy&s;icians from having ob&s;erved the extraordinary quantity of bile di&s;charg|ed by patients with this Fever, have been led into a notion that a depraved &s;tate of this fluid is the cau&s;e of the Fever&mdash;But by whatever means vomiting is excited, if of|ten repeated with violent &s;trainings, it has a powerful effect in emulging and emptying the biliary ducts, and commonly forces out a great deal of bile. This will nece&s;&s;arily be the ca&s;e in Remitting and Intermitting Fe|vers; for in con&s;equence of the debility in|duced by the remote cau&s;es (which are &s;up|po&s;ed to be Mar&s;h Mia&s;mata, and a long continued cour&s;e of great heat), e&s;pecially during the cold or forming &s;tage of the&s;e Fe|vers, the blood is thrown in greater quanti|ty and velocity into the ve&s;&s;els of the inter|nal Vi&s;cera, becau&s;e it there meets with le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance than at the &s;urface of the body, and among the re&s;t into the Vena Portae, in con&s;equence of which a greater quantity than

<HEAD>REMOTE CAUSES.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the Situation and Sea&s;on in which this Fever prevails; from the manner in which it begins; from the &s;ubjects mo&s;t liable to it; from its terminating &s;o general|ly in an Intermittent, &amp;c. I am convinced that it is produced by the very &s;ame oc|ca&s;ional or exciting cau&s;e as the Intermitting Fever, and that this exciting cau&s;e is Mar&s;h Mia&s;mata. The principal difference between Intermittents and Remittents, appears to con&s;i&s;t in the Con&s;titution or Diathe&s;is pre|&s;ent, upon which the occa&s;ional cau&s;e ope|rates; in other words, the difference in the &s;ymptoms of the Intermitting and the Remitting Fever, is owing to the difference of Diathe&s;is, tone, and vigour of the Solids, particularly of the Mu&s;cular Fibres of the &s;y&s;tem. This is analogous to what happens in other circum&s;tances&mdash;Expo&s;ure to cold in Winter, when the con&s;titution is mo&s;t

<P>THE circum&s;tances preceding and accom|panying Cholera, furni&s;h &s;ufficient proof that it does not depend upon the &s;ame cau|&s;es as Fever.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubjects of this Fever have for the mo&s;t part been greatly relaxed by the long protracted heat of the preceding Summer. Every thing el&s;e that debilitates the Nervous Sy&s;tem, may be con&s;idered as a predi&s;po|&s;ing cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE ob&s;ervations of Phy&s;icians well qua|lified for the enquiry, made in different regi|ons of the earth, have proved beyond con|trover&s;y, that exhalations i&s;&s;uing from moi&s;t and mar&s;hy grounds, which are now called Mia&s;mata, are the principal cau&s;e in the production of Intermittents and Remit|tents.</P>

<P>FROM 20 to 30 drops of Laudanum, or from one to two grains of &s;olid Opium, is the proper quantity to be given at a do&s;e.</P>
<P>WEAK warm Punch, Wine-whey, or Sangree, will be proper after the Anodyne; and, if the Feveri&s;h Symptoms are not high, will be proper through the whole cour&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e. Snake-root Tea, has al&s;o been found a very u&s;eful drink, particularly du|ring the Paroxi&s;m&mdash;In the remi&s;&s;ion, it an|&s;wers be&s;t when joined with a Decoction of the Bark, with the addition of more
<PB N="152" REF="024239_0158_0FC57073B27E9320">
or le&s;s Wine, according as the debility manife&s;t in the &s;everal functions may in|dicate.</P>
<P>IF the Emetic does not al&s;o operate by &s;tool, or if &s;ymptoms of debility render the exhibition hazardous, a free evacuation &s;hould be procured, by giving the fourth part of an ounce of Glauber's Salts, di&s;&s;olved in beverage or Tamarind-water, every three hours, till it has had the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as this is accompli&s;hed, imme|diate recour&s;e &s;hould be had to the Pe|ruvian Bark, which &s;hould be given without re&s;erve, and in as large quantities as the Sto|mach will bear, without regard to the pre|&s;ence or ab&s;ence of Fever&mdash;except that, du|ring the Paroxi&s;m or Exacerbation, it ought to be given without Wine, provided the Fe|ver does not appear to be a&s;&s;uming a conti|nued form, or is not &s;trongly marked with general debility.</P>
<P>DURING the remi&s;&s;ion therefore, let Wine
<PB N="153" REF="024239_0159_0FC57075849D2ED0">
be joined with it, and given liberally&punc; but during the Paroxi&s;m, let it be given, if in &s;ub&s;tance, with Snake-root Tea, or any mild Aromatic infu&s;ion: if it can not be taken in &s;ub&s;tance, let two ounces of it, with half an ounce of Serpentar. Virgin. be boiled in two pints of water, to one pint. A wine-gla&s;s full of the &s;trained liquor, more or le&s;s, accord|ing to circum&s;tances, with an equal quanti|ty of &s;ound old Port, or half as much Madei|ra Wine, to be given every hour during the remi&s;&s;ion, and the &s;ame quantity every two hours during the Paroxi&s;m without the Wine, or with a con&s;iderably le&s;s quantity.</P>
<P>IF it occa&s;ions either Puking or Diar|rhaea, two or three drops of Laudanum, and a little Cinnamon, or &s;pirituous Peppermint Water, &s;hould be added to every &s;econd or third do&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN Griping and Sickne&s;s are very fre|quent and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, they indicate an accu|mulation of bilious or mucous matter in the Primae Viae, and have often been relieved by
<PB N="154" REF="024239_0160_0FC5707C526939F0">
a common Gli&s;ter, or the exhibition of a mild laxative. Rhubarb and Cream of Tar|tar an&s;wers very well, or a &s;mall pill of Ca|lomel or Aloes, taken at bed-time, or early in the morning, without interrupting the exhibition of the Cortex, Vinous Drinks, and Cordial Regimen.</P>
<P>BUT a Diarrhaea &s;hould always be attended to, and dimini&s;hed, otherwi&s;e the Patient's &s;trength will be inevitably reduced by it.</P>
<P>IF, as &s;ome times happens, an ince&s;&s;ant vomiting &s;hould come on, heated &s;ub&s;tan|ces &s;hould be applied to the extremi|ties and &s;urface of the body; hot &s;pirituous drinks given almo&s;t continually, with a few drops of Laudanum and Lavender Compound; and Bli&s;ters applied to the Wri&s;ts and Stomach, and Sinapi&s;ms or Ru|befacients to the Feet.</P>
<P>IF the Stomach rejects the Laudanum as &s;oon as &s;wallowed, it &s;hould be admini&s;ter|ed
<PB N="155" REF="024239_0161_0FC57080892629C0">
in a Gli&s;ter of Camomile Tea or Barley water.</P>
<P>DR. BLANE informs us, that he has put a &s;top to the ince&s;&s;ant Puking which accompa|nies the yellow Fever of the We&s;t Indies, by the application of Bli&s;ters when Opium failed.</P>
<P>TEN grains of Sal. Tart. mixed with 30 grs. of Cream of Tartar, with a few drops of Laudanum, and a little E&s;&s;ence of Pep|permint or Cinnamon, taken in a draught of warm water in the act of efferve&s;cence, has often put a &s;top to &s;evere vomiting; but unle&s;s it be &s;wallowed while in an efferve&s;|cing &s;tate, it has no effect. Its good effect therefore &s;eems to depend upon the fixed air extricated by this proce&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is a greater probability of put|ting a &s;peedy termination to this Fever, when the Remi&s;&s;ion is very di&s;tinct, though the Paroxi&s;m may be very violent, than when the Remi&s;&s;ions are more ob&s;cure, and
<PB N="156" REF="024239_0162_0FC57082006983B8">
the Feveri&s;h Symptoms, during the Paroxi&s;m, are le&s;s violent; becau&s;e the le&s;s di&s;tinct and perfect the Remi&s;&s;ion, the greater is the debility pre&s;ent in the whole &s;y&s;tem, in the Va&s;cular, as well as in the Ner|vous.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN has a&s;certained in a very &s;atisfactory manner, that the hot &s;tage of Fevers, almo&s;t always corre&s;ponds with the preceding cold &s;tage; and that when a Fe|ver commences with a &s;udden and violent cold &s;tage, and is &s;oon after &s;ucceeded by a hot &s;tage, it is a certain proof that the Sy&s;tem, and e&s;pecially the Heart and Ar|teries are but little, if any, impaired in re|&s;pect to vigour and activity. He has al&s;o a&s;certained, that when the Paroxi&s;m of any Fever is preceded by little, or no cold &s;tage, and the more it re&s;embles the continued form, the greater the debility.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e of the Remitting Fever, cer|tainly
<PB N="157" REF="024239_0163_0FC5708389BB1E90">
operates more powerfully on the Ner|vous Sy&s;tem than on the Va&s;cular, other|wi&s;e the great activity which is often ob&s;er|vable in the Pul&s;e, during the hot &s;tage, could not take place.</P>
<P>THE advantage of cleanline&s;s and pure air in Fevers, is now too generally acknow|ledged to require in&s;i&s;ting on here.</P>
<P>WHEN the debility is very great, and the circulation very languid, the patient's limbs &s;hould be wrapped up in heated woollen cloths, occa&s;ionally repeated.</P>
<P>BUT when the &s;kin feels preternaturally hot, and the patient much exhau&s;ted, wa&s;h|ing his body with cold Spirits of Wine or Brandy, always affords grateful refre&s;hment, and renders it cooler.</P>
<P>WHEN this Fever degenerates into a con|tinued form, with great pro&s;tration of &s;trength, foul and parched Tongue, and
<PB N="158" REF="024239_0164_0FC5708783646498">
a collection of filthy, dark-coloured mucus about the Teeth and Gums, and re&s;embles the Typhus, or Putrid and Contagious Fever (which ari&s;es from a vitiated &s;tate of human effluvia,) in all its &s;ymptoms&mdash;The &s;ame plan of treatment &s;hould &s;till be pur&s;ued; with only this difference, that the Bark and Wine mu&s;t now be given in larger quantity, and continued day and night.</P>
<P>A BOLUS containing five or &s;ix grains of Volatile Salts, may al&s;o be given every two or three hours, and Rubefacients may be fre|quently applied to the limbs; but Bli&s;ters &s;eldom produce any good effect in the low &s;tate of either this Fever or the Ty|phus.</P>
<P>DURING the Convale&s;cent State, the pa|tient &s;hould guard again&s;t expo&s;ure to cold damp air, and &s;hould make u&s;e of Hux|ham's Tincture of the Bark, &s;everal times a-day, either mixed with Wine or Water,

<P>THE forming &s;tage of mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;es re|&s;emble each other &s;o much in the greate&s;t number of Symptoms, that it is difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h one from another at their com|mencement.</P>
<P>I RECOLLECT a ca&s;e of Hepatitis that occurred this month, which began with &s;ym|toms re&s;embling tho&s;e of the Remitting Fe|ver.</P>
<P>THE Di&s;ea&s;e commenced with a di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing &s;en&s;ation of cold, accompanied with fre|quent puking and great pro&s;tration of &s;trength; the&s;e were in a few hours &s;ucceeded by high Fever and pain in the region of the Liver. After opening a Vein, all the &s;ymptoms of debility accompanied with puking again returned.</P>
<P>DETERRED by this circum&s;tance, and
<PB N="160" REF="024239_0166_0FC5708A5BCAFD80">
by the frequent return of puking from repeating the Venae&s;ection, the pain increa&s;|ed, and in a few days terminated in an Ab|&s;ce&s;s. This at length di&s;charged it&s;elf gradual|ly by the Inte&s;tines; and though the patient was reduced to the lowe&s;t extremity of life, he afterwards recovered, and at pre&s;ent enjoys a good &s;tate of health. The quan|tity of Laudanum which this patient took after the Ab&s;ce&s;s began to di&s;charge, in order to re&s;train puking, and the quan|tity of &s;trong Brandy Toddy which he took to pre&s;erve his &s;trength would be &s;carcely credited if I was to &s;pe|cify it.</P>
<P>DR. WISTER, who was con&s;ulted on the ca&s;e, can bear witne&s;s that he took ten drops of the be&s;t Thebaic Tincture four times a-day, and from 60 to 80 drops in the cour&s;e of the night, for &s;ix weeks; great part of which time we expected, at our morning vi&s;its, to find him
<PB N="161" REF="024239_0167_0FC57094CF888448">
dead, to &s;uch a low ebb and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation was he reduced: But, contrary to our expectations, his appetite gradually returned: the evacuation was no more per|ceived; his Hectic cea&s;ed; and health re|turned, after five months confinement to bed.</P>
<P>THE rea&s;on he was allowed di&s;tilled Spi|rits was, becau&s;e his Stomach would not retain Wine: Even di&s;tilled Spirits was rejected, except when taken in water al|mo&s;t &s;calding hot.</P>
<P>IN the Autumn of 1781 and 1782, I be|lieve, to &s;peak within bounds, more than one-half of the children, between the age of &s;ix and eighteen months, in Southwark, died of the Cholera Morbus, Diarrhoea, and Remitting Fever.</P>
<P>OF late years, the mortality has not been &s;o great, owing, I pre&s;ume, to their being
<PB N="162" REF="024239_0168_0FC5709633BB1290">
better &s;upplied with cloathing and whole|&s;ome food, and to the greater regard which has been by all ranks paid to Cleanline&s;s, in con&s;equence of the greater pro&s;perity which they have experienced, &s;ince the re|&s;toration and increa&s;e of Trade; and, in a great mea&s;ure, to the Phy&s;icians of the Di&s;|pen&s;ary, who have the charge of all the poor|er cla&s;&s;es, many hundreds of which would peri&s;h annually for want of adequate a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, if it was not for that charitable and very u&s;eful In&s;titution. Before that In&s;ti|tution was e&s;tabli&s;hed, multitudes fell a &s;acrifice to the ignorance and villainy of Quacks and No&s;trum-mongers.</P>
<P>THE arching of the Dock, and the cul|tivation of the Lots around the City, which were formerly wa&s;te Commons, and many of them covered with &s;tagnant water, has al&s;o removed a con&s;iderable &s;ource of Di&s;|ca&s;e from the City and its vicinity.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="024239_0169_0FC57097B3D21530">
NOR is it unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the improved &s;tate of Phy&s;ic, has had &s;ome &s;hare in retarding the progre&s;s of Mor|tality.</P>
<P>IT is to the labours and &s;agacity of the immortal Cullen, that the world is in|debted for the principal improvements which have been made in the treatment of Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<P>THE Weather was dry and cool the great|e&s;t part of this Month, as there were only eight days on which any Rain fell; and that was in &s;mall quantities, and at con&s;iderable intervals.</P>
<P>THE changes in the temperature of the air, were often very con&s;iderable and &s;ud|den.</P>
<P>FROST, which was fir&s;t ob&s;erved in the City and Suburbs on the 24th of September, became very &s;evere, and rendered Fires con|&s;tantly agreeable.</P>
<P>DISEASES this Month were &s;imilar to
<PB N="165" REF="024239_0171_0FC5709D0C2C3218">
tho&s;e in September, with the addition of He|patic Affections.</P>
<P>THESE la&s;t generally required and were re|lieved by bleeding and purging with Calomel; when ob&s;tinate, a repetition of bleeding was often found nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;ometimes the ap|plication of a Bli&s;ter.</P>
<P>GREAT numbers of children were inocu|lated this month, but in general the di&s;ea&s;e was not &s;o favourable as it had been the pre|ceding Spring, owing perhaps to the relaxed &s;tate of the Solids, in con&s;equence of the pre|ceding heat of the Summer&mdash;With &s;ome it became Confluent.</P>
<P>WHEN called to a patient previous to, or at the commencement of the eruption in the natural way, I always advi&s;ed him to be kept out of bed in the day time, and to be covered very lightly in the night, expo&s;ing him to a greater degree of cold than would be &s;afe in a &s;tate
<PB N="166" REF="024239_0172_0FC570A456D104C8">
a &s;tate of health, and in&s;i&s;ted upon keeping his Bowels very free with Saline Laxatives, till the end of the &s;ixth day from the fir&s;t commencement of the &s;ymptoms; after which I directed a mild Anodyne every night with a Laxative occa&s;ionally, if Co&s;tive&mdash;By this method many were apparently pre&s;erved from having the di&s;ea&s;e in a &s;evere manner.</P>
<P>IN ca&s;es of Convul&s;ion, I permitted the feet to be bathed in warm-water, avoided expo&s;ure to cold, and gave Laudanum in Gli|&s;ters when the patient could not &s;wallow, till the Convul&s;ions cea&s;ed, and the Fever began to ri&s;e; after which I gradually admitted ex|po&s;ure to cooler Air, allowed cool Drinks and mild Laxatives, and if the Fever became very violent, directed the patient to be carried a|broad into the open air, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHEN the Symptoms of debility were great, the Pu&s;tles flat and pale, I always gave a little Calomel, joined with an Anodyne, at
<PB N="167" REF="024239_0173_0FC570A5F44FFBA8">
bed-time and a &s;trong decoction of the Bark and Serpentaria, with Wine, in the day-time.</P>
<P>IN mo&s;t ca&s;es I found the Bark and Wine &s;erviceable from the 11th to the 17th day.</P>
<P>FOR about the 11th day, even in the Di&s;|tinct &s;ort, if the Pu&s;tles are numerous, the &s;welling of the face begins to &s;ub&s;ide and the &s;trength to decline.</P>
<P>WHEN the hands and feet were much &s;welled, I endeavoured to promote Urine by Diuretics, at the &s;ame time that I endea|voured to &s;upport the &s;trength by Wine and Bark and a Cordial Regimen.</P>
<P>WITHOUT attention is paid to this cir|cum&s;tance, the &s;everi&s;h Symptoms generally become very violent and often fatal.</P>
<P>I have found Nitre di&s;&s;olved in Beverage, when given in &s;mall Do&s;es, an&s;wer very well&mdash;When a Diarrhoea &s;upervened about this
<PB N="168" REF="024239_0174_0FC570A773F0A568">
this period, and manife&s;tly weakened the Pa|tient, I always endeavoured to check it, by giving three or four drops of Thebaic Tinc|ture, frequently in a &s;pirituous Julep&mdash;but not otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN the Pock is dry, and formed into a cru&s;t, a Hectic Fever is often the con&s;e|quence, owing to debility, and the ob&s;tructi|on of per&s;piration: Here &s;mall do&s;es of Vo|latiles, with the Bark and Serpentaria, the Warm-Bath and Flannel Cloathings, by re|&s;toring &s;trength and per&s;piration, generally effect a cure.</P>
<P>WHEN a Pregnant Woman takes the Small Pox in the natural way, Abortion is gene|rally the con&s;equence. The late Dr. Bond u&s;ed to &s;ay, that this was always the ca&s;e; but I have, however, &s;een in&s;tances to the contrary. But the frequency of its occurrence, ought to make us decline inoculating women in that condition. Does the mother's hav|ing
<PB N="169" REF="024239_0175_0FC570A8F0FB94D0">
the Small-Pox when pregnant, prevent her child from receiving the infection after its birth?</P>

<P>"MANY days in this month were very plea&s;ant and agreeable; but the greate&s;t part of the Weather was cold, changeable and wet, with very variable winds&mdash;On the 26th, there
<PB N="170" REF="024239_0176_0FC570AB91577400">
was a fall of &s;now for the fir&s;t time this month."</P>
<P>DISEASES.</P>
<P>MOST of the Di&s;ea&s;es which occurred this month, were of an Inflammatory na|ture, owing to the coldne&s;s and variablene&s;s of the Weather.</P>
<P>RHEUMATIC and Catarrhal affections were the mo&s;t common; and the generality of tho&s;e who had been &s;ubject to the Gout, were again vi&s;ited by that foe to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>AS Rheumati&s;m is a very common and a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing compliant in this country, particularly in Philadelphia, I hope the fol|lowing de&s;cription, and method of treatment, founded on ob&s;ervation and experience, will not be unacceptable or u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;ea&s;e is particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="171" REF="024239_0177_0FC570B86BF41340">
by Pains affecting the larger Joints. It be|gins with the common Symptoms of Fever; and as &s;oon as the Hot Stage is formed, is generally attended with a &s;trong, full, and hard Pul&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Pain &s;eldom continues long in the &s;ame Joint; but &s;hifts in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner from one to another&mdash;The Pain and Fever is always wor&s;t in the evening and night, owing in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the heat of the bed and covering.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;ea&s;e differs from the generality of Inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es in this, that it is not apt to terminate in Suppuration, but ef|fu&s;ions &s;ometimes are occa&s;ioned by it, of a tran&s;parent gelatinous Fluid, into the ten|dinous Sheaths.</P>
<P>WHILEVER the Di&s;ea&s;e depends upon an Inflammatory Diathe&s;is, the pained joints are relieved by expo&s;ure to a colder tempera|ture
<PB N="172" REF="024239_0178_0FC570BCB4BA4A80">
than u&s;ual&mdash;When the Inflammatory Diathe&s;is is removed or exhau&s;ted, the pain is always aggravated by cold, and re|lieved by heat. By due attention to the&s;e circum&s;tances and the &s;tate of the Fever, we may always a&s;certain when the Di&s;ea&s;e is in an Acute, and when in a Chronic State.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;ea&s;e is generally occa&s;ioned by expo&s;ure to cold and damp Air, after the body has been heated by fatiguing exerci&s;e, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE Proximate cau&s;e of this Di&s;ea&s;e, appears to be an Atony in the extreme Ve&s;|&s;els, particularly of the Joints, while at the &s;ame time the re&s;t of the Sy&s;tem is in a &s;tate of increa&s;ed tone and excitement.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, with Dr. Cullen, that the ap|plication of cold, e&s;pecially when combined with moi&s;ture is the mo&s;t common occa&s;i|onal or exciting cau&s;e of Rheumati&s;m; and that it produces its &s;edative and debilitating

effects, more particularly upon the ve&s;&s;els of the Joints, from their being more loo&s;ely and imperfectly covered by a cellular texture, than the intermediate parts of the Limbs.</P>
<P>THE indications of cure are, to re&s;tore a due balance and adju&s;tment between the af|fected Ve&s;&s;els and the re&s;t of the Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>CURE.</P>
<P>BLOOD &s;hould be drawn every day, in a larger or &s;maller quantity, proportioned to the &s;trength and fulne&s;s of the Pul&s;e, and the acutene&s;s of the Pain; and the Bowels kept very Laxative with Saline Purges, till the Pain and Fever are reduced.</P>

when only weakne&s;s remains, they may be rubbed with the Oil of Amber or Tincture of Cantharides.</P>
<P>THE Cortex and Serpentaria, with the moderate u&s;e of Wine, and a Cordial Regi|men, will all be proper to rein&s;tate the Pati|ent's health.</P>
<P>THE application of Bli&s;ters to the Joints, have often beneficial effects in the Acute Rheumati&s;m; but in chronic ca&s;es, I have &s;een better and more expeditious effects, when the pains were fixed, by rubbing Mer|curial Oinment very liberally upon the af|fected parts, and giving the &s;imple Mercurial Pill, agreeable to the advice of Dr. Clark, till the mouth began to be affected. The application of Vitriolic AEther to &s;welled Joints, e&s;pecially when Oedematous, has al&s;o been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound &s;erviceable.</P>

<P>ALMOST every kind of Inflammatory Complaint occurred in Philadelphia: But affections of the Lungs, whether in the &s;lighter form of Catarrh, or more dangerous one of Peripneumony, were mo&s;t prevalent.</P>

<P>THE diagno&s;tic Symptoms of this Di&s;|ea&s;e are; a hoar&s;ene&s;s, with &s;ome &s;hrillne&s;s and ringing &s;ound, both in &s;peaking and coughing. At the &s;ame time, there is a &s;en&s;e of Pain about the Larynx; &s;ome dif|ficulty of re&s;piration, with a whizzing &s;ound in in&s;piration, as if the pa&s;&s;age of the

Air was &s;traitened&mdash;The cough, without exception, in all that I have &s;een, was dry, har&s;h and &s;onorous&mdash;Together with the&s;e Symptoms, there is a frequency of Pul&s;e, a Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and generally an increa&s;e of Heat&mdash;Neither redne&s;s nor tumour are perceptible within the Fauces, nor any alteration in the &s;ize of the Ton&s;ils externally.</P>
<P>WITH the de&s;cribed Symptoms, and par|ticularly with great difficulty of breathing, and a &s;en&s;e of &s;trangling in the Fauces, the Patient &s;ome times &s;uddenly expires.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;ea&s;e attacks infants at the brea&s;t le&s;s frequently than after they are weaned. After this period, the younger they are the more they are liable to it: The frequency of it becomes le&s;s as children advance in age and vigour; and there are no ca&s;es recorded of children above twelve years of age being af|fected with it. It very frequently occurs in Philadelphia, both in Autumn and Spring, and even in Winter, among the infants of the
<PB N="180" REF="024239_0186_0FC570D1DBAF0558">
Germans who generally &s;it in rooms heated by clo&s;e &s;toves.</P>
<P>IT often manife&s;tly comes on from ex|po&s;ure to cold and damp Air, after having been previou&s;ly heated or thrown into pro|fu&s;e per&s;piration.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the &s;lavering of Saliva, by wetting and chilling the neck, may favour the operation of colder Air.</P>
<P>THE frequency of its commencing with the ordinary Symptoms of a Catarrh, fa|vours this conjecture.</P>
<P>THERE have been many di&s;&s;ections made of infants who have died of this Di&s;ea&s;e; and there has almo&s;t con&s;tantly appeared a preternatural Membrane lining the whole internal &s;urface of the upper part of the Tra|chea, and extending in the &s;ame manner downwards into &s;ome of its Ramifications. This preternatural Membrane may be ea&s;ily
<PB N="181" REF="024239_0187_0FC570D53719D1D8">
&s;eparated, and &s;ometimes has been found &s;e|parated in part from the &s;ubjacent proper Membrane of the Trachea. This la&s;t is commonly found without any appearance of Corro&s;ion or Ulceration; but it frequently &s;hews the ve&s;tiges of Inflammation, and is covered by a matter re&s;embling Pus.</P>
<P>FROM the remote cau&s;es of this Di&s;ea&s;e; from the Catarrhal Symptoms commonly attending it; from the Fever con&s;tantly pre|&s;ent with it; from the &s;ame kind of preter|natural Membrane being found in the Tra|chea when the Cynanche Maligna is com|municated to it: and from the ve&s;tiges of In|flammation on the Trachea di&s;covered upon Di&s;&s;ection, we mu&s;t conclude, that the Di&s;|ea&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in an Inflammatory affection of the Mucous Membrane of the Larynx and Trachea, producing an Exudation analogous to that found on the &s;urface of inflamed Vi&s;cera, the thinner parts of which evaporat|ing, and being carried off by the Air in Re&s;|piration,
<PB N="182" REF="024239_0188_0FC56DE7337FEDF0">
leaves the remainder thick, dry, and &s;olid.</P>
<P>THOUGH this Di&s;ea&s;e manife&s;tly con&s;i&s;ts in an Inflammatory Affection, it does not commonly end either in Suppuration or Gangrene.</P>
<P>THE peculiar and trouble&s;ome circum|&s;tance of the Di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in a Spa&s;m of the Mu&s;cles of the Glottis, which by inducing a Suffocation, prevents the com|mon con&s;equences of Inflammation.</P>
<P>WHEN this Di&s;ea&s;e terminates in Health, it appears to be by a re&s;olution of the Inflam|mation; by a cea&s;ing of the Spa&s;m of the Glottis; by an expectoration of the Matter exuding from the Trachea, and of the cru&s;ts formed there; and frequently it ends only with an Expectoration, re&s;embling that which attends a &s;imple Catarrh.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="024239_0189_0FC56DEBF678CB30">
WHEN it ends fatally, it is by a Suffocati|on, in con&s;equence of a Spa&s;m affecting the Glottis; but &s;ometimes probably owing to a quantity of Matter filling the Bronchiae.</P>
<P>As the Di&s;ea&s;e has been incontrovertibly proved to be an Inflammatory Affection, the cure at pre&s;ent is generally attempted by the &s;ame means as have been found mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful in other Inflammatory Affections.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>BLEEDING,</HEAD>
<P>BOTH general and topical, has often gi|ven immediate relief, when employed ear|ly in the Di&s;ea&s;e; and by being repeated to a &s;econd, and even to a third time, when the difficulty of breathing and heat of the Body were con&s;iderable, has entirely cured the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>VOMITING immediately after bleeding has generally a very good effect&mdash;For this
<PB N="184" REF="024239_0190_0FC56DED3A489FB0">
purpo&s;e I prefer a &s;olution of Tartar Emetic, in Honey and Water, of tepid warmth, in the proportion of three grains to &s;ix tea-&s;poon|fuls of the Honey and Water; of which one tea-&s;poonful may be given every quarter of an hour, till it operates, and the operation promoted with Bran, Lin&s;eed, Mallows, Balm or Hy&s;op Tea &s;weetened with Honey.</P>
<P>IF the principal Symptoms are not mani|fe&s;tly mitigated after a &s;econd bleeding, the operation of an Emetic, and the ex|hibition of a Laxative Gli&s;ter, (if the Emetic has not al&s;o proved purgative) a Bli&s;|ter Pla&s;ter, guarded with fine Gauze, &s;hould be applied without delay on each &s;ide of the Neck, &s;o as to reach from the root of each Ear to the Trachea, and as &s;oon as they have produced Ve&s;&s;ications, they are to be remov|ed, and the bli&s;tered parts dre&s;&s;ed with Ba&s;ili|cum, or perhaps &s;omething more &s;timulating.</P>

debilitated by previous Di&s;ea&s;e, blood letting mu&s;t be employed more &s;paringly, or per|haps omitted altogether; and our depen|dence mu&s;t be placed on Emetics, Lax|ative Gli&s;ters, or purges of Calomel, and the application of Bli&s;ters; ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time to keep the Patient's body cooler than would be agreeable if in health, and to enjoin the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the Antiphlo|gi&s;tic Regimen; which con&s;i&s;ts in avoiding every &s;timulating impre&s;&s;ion; &s;uch as Heat, Exerci&s;e, Impatience, Animal Food, Spices, Salt, Butter, Sweet Meats, dried and hard Fruits, di&s;tilled or fermented Liquors, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A Decoction of Barley and Rai&s;ins, or Oatmeal Gruel, with ripe juicy Fruits, ei|ther raw or baked are the only articles of Diet allowable; and the Liquids already &s;pe|cified, or tho&s;e of a &s;imilar quality, acidulat|ed with Lime Juice, are the mo&s;t &s;uitable drinks.</P>
<P>DR. George Glentworth has done me
<PB N="186" REF="024239_0192_0FC56DF65C7B3E98">
the honour to inform me, that he lately cured two children of the Cynanche Tra|chealis, by putting them into the Warm Bath, when in danger of &s;uffocating, imme|diately after one blood-letting, and the exhi|bition of a Puke, in the early Stage of the Di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;The whole of the Bodies of the&s;e Patients was immer&s;ed in the Bath, and when taken out, they were put to bed be|tween blankets, and a copious per&s;piration promoted by warm Beverage or Balm Tea.</P>
<P>I HAVE often advi&s;ed that a ve&s;&s;el of hot Water &s;hould be held under the Patient's chin, for the purpo&s;e of breathing the vapour i&s;&s;u|ing from it, but never perceived any bene|ficial effect from it.</P>
<P>PERHAPS when the Di&s;ea&s;e has been of &s;everal days continuance, it may a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;oftening and loo&s;ening the preternatural Membrane; but I apprehend that the heat it occa&s;ions mu&s;t be injurious in the early

Stage of the Di&s;ea&s;e, while the Inflamma|tory Symptoms are con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>WHEN every other remedy fails, and the Patient is in immediate danger of &s;uffocati|on, I think Bronchotomy might be tried with propriety. Perhaps life might be re&s;tored, even after &s;uffocation, if the operation was immediately performed, and the Lungs in|flated with bellows. If Bronchotomy &s;uc|ceeds, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to keep a &s;uitable Canula in the Orifice for the Patient to breath through till the Di&s;ea&s;e is removed.</P>
<P>IN order to in&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of the Puke, it ought to be exhibited every fourth or &s;ixth hour if the &s;trength will permit.</P>
<P>I HAVE al&s;o &s;een good effects produced by the exhibition of Calomel in large and re|peated Do&s;es; but not &s;o uniformly as from the Emetic Solution.</P>

<P><PB N="192" REF="024239_0198_0FC56E05F3F70250">
FROM the three preceding Bills of Mor|tality, it appears that the number of Births in Philadelphia at pre&s;ent, annually, is only a little more than double the number of Deaths.</P>
<P>THE numerous Deaths which occur here, appear to be more owing to the &s;udden vici&s;|&s;itudes of Weather than to any other cau&s;e; for according to the ob&s;ervations of Profe&s;&s;or Kalm, (page 104.) "There is hardly a country on earth in which the Weather changes &s;o often in a Day as it does here."</P>
<P>IT frequently changes from exce&s;&s;ive heat to piercing cold in le&s;s than twenty four hours&mdash;Sometimes it changes five or &s;ix times in the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>THE following calculations, the re&s;ult of ob&s;ervations for ten years on the Lon|don Bills of Mortality, by Mr. Simp&s;on,
<PB N="193" REF="024239_0199_0FC56E09DAB43A38">
with additional remarks by Dr. Foulke: ex|tracted from his Oration on Longevity, de|livered before the Philo&s;ophical Society at Philadelphia, are in&s;erted to &s;hew, that the probabilities or chances of enjoying health, and prolonging life, is much greater in the City of Philadelphia, and &s;ome other parts of the United States, than in any other di&s;|tricts of the World, containing a proportion|able number of inhabitants.</P>
<P>BY Mr. Symp&s;on's ob&s;ervations, it ap|pears that not one-half of the Per&s;ons born in London live to be three years old; not one|third to be 25; not one-fourth to be 38; not one-&s;ixth part to be 49; not one-eighth to be 59; and not more than one in 500 of them to be 78.</P>
<P>IT appears from the ob&s;ervations of Dr. Price, that in&s;tances of Longevity are not al|ways in proportion to the rarene&s;s of deaths in the early periods of life.</P>
<P>"IN Pais de Vaud in Switzerland, he
<PB N="194" REF="024239_0200_0FC56E0B346C5578">
&s;ays only one in 45 dies annually." In Lon|don nearly one in 20 and three-fourths dies annually; in Vienna, one in 19&frac12; in Holy Cro&s;s near Shrew&s;bury in England, one in 33.</P>
<P>IN Pais de Vaud one half of the inhabitants live to the age of 41. In a Country Pari&s;h in Brandenburgh, where the annual Deaths are in the &s;ame proportion as in Pais de Vaud, one-half the Per&s;ons born do not reach their 26th year&mdash;In Holy Cro&s;s one half reach their 27th year&mdash;In London and Berlin, &s;uch is the melancholy condition of the Inhabi|tants, that one-half of the children are buried before they are two years and three-fourths old.</P>
<P><Q>THE ravage of Mortality is &s;till more exce&s;&s;ive at Vienna, where the &s;econd is the la&s;t year of life to half the Per&s;ons born in that City.</Q></P>
<P>DR. PRICE proceeds to give us the pro|portion of tho&s;e who reach 80 years of age in different places.</P>
<Q><PB N="195" REF="024239_0201_0FC56E0E4BCBD620">
<P>WE &s;hall here find apparent contradicti|ons, if we are not prepared to expect in&s;tances of Longevity in the &s;ame places, which pro|duce even the large&s;t proportion of annual Deaths.</P>
<P>FOR in&s;tance&mdash;Holy Cro&s;s near Shrew&s;|bury, furni&s;hes a larger proportion of annual Deaths than Pais de Vaud or Brandenburg; but at the la&s;t place, one per&s;on in 22&frac12; only reaches 80 years of age; and in Pais de Vaud, 1 only in 21 and a half; whil&s;t in Holy Cro&s;s, one in 11 is found to reach this venerable pe|riod of exi&s;tence.</P></Q>
<P>THE difficulty and con&s;equent uncertainty of all political Arithmetic weakens our con|fidence in calculations of this nature; but if the mo&s;t ingenious in Europe, who have every means of information in their power, are heard with diffidence, what confidence, can we expect to in&s;pire who&s;e &s;ources of information are as yet &s;o &s;canty and imper|fect?
<PB N="196" REF="024239_0202_0FC56E1225AD33E0">
"We &s;hall, however, venture to draw &s;ome inferences from &s;uch documents and data as we do po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>THE expectation of life to an Infant ju&s;t born is 18 years even in London, where early Deaths are more numerous, perhaps, than any where el&s;e except in Vienna.</P>
<P>ON Dr. Price's principles, the number of annual Births, being multiplied into the ex|pectation of life, &s;hould give the number of native Inhabitants; for in&s;tance, it is &s;aid the Births in this City (Philadelphia) la&s;t year, were 2192, and this number multiplied by 18, the lowe&s;t expectation of life for an infant in Europe, amounts to 39456. But as it has &s;ince been found, that the number of inhabi|tants re&s;iding in the City and &s;uburbs of Phi|ladelphia is 42,400, the inference follows (upon a pre&s;umption, that the regi&s;try of Births is accurate) that the expectation for the life of every Infant is more than 18 to 1 here.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="024239_0203_0FC56E1382B636C0">
IN all European Cities a calculation on the&s;e principles gives a re&s;ult confe&s;&s;edly &s;hort of the real number of inhabitants, and the calculator is obliged to have recour&s;e to the exce&s;s of Burials more than Births to ac|count for the difference. But in this coun|try, favourable as it is equally to Population and Longevity, we have even in its large&s;t City an exce&s;s of Births more than of Burials, in the extraordinary proportion of 11 to 5, notwith&s;tanding &s;trangers who die in Phi|ladelphia are included in the li&s;t of burials.</P>
<P>BY comparing the number of annual Deaths in Philadelphia with the number of In|habitants, we &s;hall find that there is not more than one in 40 dies annually; and if we do not include &s;trangers in the account of the funerals, it will be found that there is not more than one in 50 that dies here.</P>
<Q><P>FROM a paragraph in the News-paper, under the New-Haven Head, we find the
<PB N="198" REF="024239_0204_0FC56E14F0DA4578">
annual Deaths only in the proportion of 1 in 70 of the whole number of the Inhabitants; a proportion more flattering than any table we have met with, though the limited &s;cale of this in&s;tance, and the corroborating circum|&s;tances cited, leave no room to doubt of its ac|curacy.</P>
<P>THE learned and ingenious Dr. Samuel Smith of Princetown, (Author of the In|fluence of Climate, &amp;c. upon the human body) has favoured me with an account of a number of Families in the Jer&s;ey State, by which it appears that of the living four-fifths of them were above 10 years old; more than one-half upwards of 20; two-&s;evenths above 30; one-fifth above 40; one-ninth above 50; and one-fourteenth had pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;ome very con&s;iderably, the period of 60 years.</P></Q>
<P><Q>MR. WM. BARTON's ingenious Letter, pre&s;ented at the la&s;t meeting of the Society,
<PB N="199" REF="024239_0205_0FC56E1914144A10">
contains many curious particulars, and &s;eems calculated to &s;upply American data, the De|&s;ideratum of tho&s;e tables with which other Countries have been furni&s;hed.</Q></P>
<P>IT appears from Mr. Barton's reference to Profe&s;&s;or Wiggle&s;worth, that one Per&s;on in eight of tho&s;e buried in Ip&s;wich Hamlet, in the State of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, arrived to the very uncommon Age (in other Countries) of 80 years. "A proportion which mu&s;t remain a monument of Longevity in all probability, only to be paralleled in the future Hi&s;tory of our own Country."</P>
<P>D. PERCIVAL &s;ays, "in the Pais de Vaud, a di&s;trict of the Province of Bern in Switzerland, and in a country Pari&s;h in Bran|denburgh 1 in 45 of the Inhabitants die an|nually; and at Stoke Damarell in Devon&s;hire, 1 in 54; whereas in Edinburgh and Vienna, the yearly Mortality appears to be 1 in 20; in London 1 in 21; in Rome and Am&s;terdam, 1
<PB N="200" REF="024239_0206_0FC56E1A31095840">
in 22; in Northampton, 1 in 26; and in Holy Cro&s;s, 1 in 33.</P>
<P>IN the Pais de Vaud, the proportion of Inhabitants, who attain the Age of 80, is 1 in 21&frac12; Brandenburgh, 1 in 22&frac12; in Norwich, 1 in 27; in Manche&s;ter, 1 in 30; in London, 1 in 40; and in Edinburgh, 1 in 42. The&s;e facts afford a &s;triking, but me|lancholy, proof of the unfavourable influence of large towns on the duration of life.</P>
<P>FROM the mo&s;t accurate computation, London is found to contain 601,750 inhabi|tants; and from 1759 to 1768, the burials have exceeded the chri&s;tenings every year upwards of 7000; which is the recruit the Metropolis requires annually from the Coun|try to &s;upport the pre&s;ent number of its People.</P>
<P>IN 1757, a &s;urvey was made of Manche&s;|ter
<PB N="201" REF="024239_0207_0FC56E204C7A61B8">
and Salford. The number of Inhabitants then amounted to 19839; and the burials, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e among the Di&s;&s;enters, were 778 per annum; but &s;ince that time the popu|lou&s;ne&s;s of Manche&s;ter has con&s;iderably in|crea&s;ed. Half of all that are born in that town die under five years of age.</P>
<P>THE I&s;land of Madeira, which is &s;ituated between. 32 and 33 degrees N. L. is &s;o re|markably healthy, that two-thirds of all that are born in it, live to be married. Autumn is the mo&s;t healthy; Summer the mo&s;t &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on there.</P>
<P>IN Manche&s;ter Di&s;ea&s;es are mo&s;t frequent and fatal in the Months of January, February, and March; and lea&s;t &s;o in July, Augu&s;t, and September.</P>
<P>"AT Paris, and in Sweden, it has been ob&s;erved, that Women not only live longer than Men; but that married Women live longer than &s;ingle Women."</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="024239_0208_0FC56E21B6170FA8">
"AND in Switzerland it appears, particu|larly from the calculations of M. Muret, that of equal numbers of &s;ingle and married Wo|men between the age of 15 and 25, more of the former died than of the latter, in the pro|portion of two to one."</P>
<P>IN the Pari&s;h of Holy Cro&s;s, Salop, and account was taken by the Vicar, A. D. 1760, of the number of Males and Females, of the Age of 70 and upwards; the latter amounted to 35, the former only to eight.&mdash;See <HI>Price on rever&s;ionary payments, and Percival's E&s;&s;ays,</HI> Vol. 2d.</P>
<P>FROM a compari&s;on of the Bills of Mor|tality with the number of Inhabitants in the Pari&s;h of Manche&s;ter it appears, that whil&s;t in the town the yearly Mortality is one to 28, in the Pari&s;h only one in 56 dies annu|ally.</P>
<P>SUCH a &s;triking di&s;parity between the
<PB N="203" REF="024239_0209_0FC56E232FFF3B40">
healthine&s;s of a large town and the Country which &s;urrounds it, will &s;carcely be credited by tho&s;e who have paid no attention to &s;uch enquiries.</P>

<P>WILMINGTON, the large&s;t Town in the State, is but 28 Miles from Philadelphia, &s;i|tuate upon a gentle a&s;cent of an eminence along Chri&s;tina Creek, about one and a half Miles from the River Delaware. This

<P>THE difference ob&s;erved in the vigour, ac|tivity, complexions, and a&s;pect of the People who inhabit the low flat country and tho&s;e of the high and dry parts, affords a very &s;trong argument in favour of the opinion of naturali&s;ts; who a&s;&s;ert, that the healthine&s;s or unhealthine&s;s of any &s;ituation and climate may be a&s;certained from an accurate ob&s;er|ance of the&s;e circum&s;tances, together with the knowledge of the diet, drinks, and occupati|ons of the Inhabitants, with as much cer|tainty as the nature and quality of any Soil may be determined from a knowledge of the &s;pecies of timber and other vegetables which grow upon it &s;pontaneou&s;ly.</P>

<P>DR. JAMES TILTON, a Phy&s;ician of ta|lents and experience, re&s;iding in the Town of Dover, in a Letter to Dr. Redman, Pre&s;i|dent of the College of Phy&s;icians, dated April 1790, remarks that "However there may be &s;omething e&s;&s;ential and immutable in the nature of all Fevers, yet different con|&s;titutions of the Atmo&s;phere may occa&s;ion, of nece&s;&s;ity, a variety of practice even in Di&s;|ea&s;es of the &s;ame name.</P>

war, during the winter, or inflammatory &s;ea|&s;on of the year, they treated the Fevers which occured at that place, by repeated bleeding, and the general antiphlogi&s;tic methods with remarkable &s;ucce&s;s; but the &s;ame method now would be attended with very different effects; the exceptions at lea&s;t are &s;o few as hardly to de&s;erve mentioning."</P>
<P>"OPIUM, Wine, Bark, Volatile Salts are the Articles of Materia Medica, we are obliged chiefly to have recour&s;e to."</P>
<Q><P>So contrary to the Phlogi&s;tic, and &s;o fa|vourable to the Typhous Diathe&s;is is the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the Atmo&s;phere, that blood-letting is very &s;eldom u&s;ed in the cure of Fever.</P>
<P>DR. TILTON al&s;o remarks, that the Small-pox, Mea&s;les and Influenza, though from contagion and a cau&s;e permanent and
<PB N="208" REF="024239_0214_0FC56E30B4B6B870">
immutably the &s;ame, yet they have not lately borne bleeding as they u&s;ed to do; and very often in the latter Stages of the&s;e Fevers, the Bark, other Tonics and Cordials, become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P></Q>
<P>"THE Fever mo&s;t prevalent with us this Winter and Spring, has u&s;ually attacked with conge&s;tion in the Lungs, re&s;embling a Pe|ripneumony; and yet the whole train of Symptoms indicative of Typhous weak|ne&s;s, &s;uch as Pain of the Head, dry Tongue, foul Mouth, &s;ick Stomach, attended &s;ometimes with Vomiting and Purging, &s;o regularly en&s;ued, that this Fever may be denominated <HI>Peripneumonia Typhoides.</HI> Although at the beginning of this Fever a fullne&s;s of the Pul&s;e, Pain of the Head, and aching Pains over the whole Body, might induce an incautious Phy&s;ician to employ blood-let|ling; we have learned from repeated ob&s;erva|tion to withhold the Lancet, or to u&s;e it in the mo&s;t guarded manner."</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Dover</HI> <DATE>20, <HI>April</HI> 1791.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after writing my for|mer Letter to you, I was &s;eized with an in|di&s;po&s;ition that totally di&s;qualified me for writing again &s;o &s;oon as I intended; and even at this time I cannot attempt more than a very general account of our Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>THE medical Hi&s;tory of Delaware, I appre|hend, is peculiar in this circum&s;tance, that a greater variety of Soil and Climate is compre|hended within a &s;maller extent of Territory than can be found any where el&s;e. Within the narrow limits of a hundred Miles in length, upon the Delaware River, and the mean di&s;tance of about twenty-four Miles
<PB N="210" REF="024239_0216_0FC56E37B8DCF9F0">
back into the country, we have all the varie|ties of Soil and Climate to be found in the middle States of America. That di&s;trict of Delaware, which lies above Chri&s;tiana creek, is perfectly Mountainous both in Soil and Climate; and the&s;e Mountains extend their influence throughout New-Ca&s;tle county, &s;o as to give a di&s;tinction of climate for every ten miles you de&s;cend down the De|laware. From Apoquinimink creek to the lower end of the &s;tate, we have a level country, inter&s;ected at regular di&s;tances from five to ten miles, with creeks of tide|water, bordered with exten&s;ive mar&s;hes; and the&s;e creeks head in immen&s;e &s;wamps, on the we&s;tern border of the &s;tate, from whence the water falls, equivocally, either into the Delaware or the Che&s;apeake. Throughout this low and flat di&s;trict, Mar&s;h Mia&s;mata and other noxious exhalations, mu&s;t be a plentiful &s;ource of Di&s;ea&s;es. Cape Henlopen, neverthele&s;s, enjoys all the ad|vantages of a perfectly in&s;ular &s;ituation; and
<PB N="211" REF="024239_0217_0FC56E38F8D3FD28">
all the river &s;hore, as well as the &s;ea coa&s;t, find great relief from the &s;ea-breeze; &s;o that it is only the inland part of the country, where heat and &s;tagnation concur to exalt the nox|ious exhalations of our low grounds, that our &s;tate can truly be &s;aid to be &s;ickly.</P>
<P>FROM this general de&s;cription of our &s;tate, the following account of the health and di&s;|ea&s;es of the inhabitants will be readily cre|dited. The hills of Brandy wine and Chri&s;|tiana, furni&s;h as healthful a di&s;trict of coun|try as any in America. The Borrough of Wilmington for health, beauty, and accom|modation, is &s;uperior to any town I have &s;een, between the borders of New-England and the &s;outhern boundary of Virginia; and I have examined all the principal towns with|in tho&s;e limits, in a comparative point of view. George-Town, on the Potowmac, the intended Federal Re&s;idence, is more ana|logous to Wilmington than any other, but manife&s;tly the inferior of the two.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="024239_0218_0FC56E3A89DFC178">
THE town of New-Ca&s;tle, though &s;ur|rounded by mar&s;hy &s;prouts from the Dela|ware, is neverthele&s;s rendered a healthful re|&s;idence, by the refre&s;hing breezes from the river that flow in upon the town as regu|larly as the tide. All the county of New-Ca&s;tle, and e&s;pecially above Apoquinimink, is a delightful di&s;trict of country, though the nearer the river the more healthful.</P>
<P>KENT, though ble&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t fer|tile &s;oil, is the mo&s;t &s;ickly of the three coun|ties of Delaware. Dover, the county town, and Metropolis of the State, is truly un|healthful. Situated eight miles within land, and &s;hut out from all water communication by high timbered woods, the air of this di&s;trict, in the hot &s;ea&s;on of the year, &s;uffers exceedingly from &s;tagnation.</P>
<P>SUSSEX county, though as flat and mar&s;hy as Kent, is fanned on one &s;ide from the De|laware, and on another from the Atlantic,
<PB N="213" REF="024239_0219_0FC56E3BF7DFDD10">
and the woods being cut down in le&s;s pro|portion, than in the other counties, the a|bundance of fore&s;t trees, pour forth a re|fre&s;hment to the air that contributes, with the &s;ea breezes, to the health of the inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>LEWES, the county town of Su&s;&s;ex, &s;tands upon the promontory of Cape-Henlopen, that &s;tretches in between the Delaware and the Atlantic. This town is con&s;tantly fanned from the Ocean, and is as healthful as Ber|mudas. This place has furni&s;hed the longe&s;t lived inhabitants of our &s;tate. Here are the greate&s;t proportion of old people, and the mo&s;t numerous &s;warms of children. Lewes is much re&s;orted to by convale&s;cents from the inland country and neighbouring &s;tates, and de&s;erves to be &s;till more frequented. Sickly boys, and others with &s;welled Spleens and ob|&s;tructed Vi&s;cera, from repeated and ob&s;tinate Fevers, are quickly re&s;tored to health, barely by a re&s;idence at Lewes. All manner of
<PB N="214" REF="024239_0220_0FC56E402AEFE1E0">
nervous weakne&s;s is relieved by the &s;alutary Air of our Cape; but A&s;thmatic and Hectic Patients &s;hould be cautious how they tru&s;t them&s;elves there.</P>
<P>FREQUENT and &s;udden changes in the &s;en&s;ible qualities of our Atmo&s;phere furni&s;h another fertile &s;ource of Di&s;ea&s;es. The&s;e changes depend &s;olely on the cour&s;e of the winds, and happen as often as the winds change. The wind blowing from between North and Ea&s;t, is generally cold and moi&s;t, except from June until September, when it is generally dry. From Ea&s;t to South comes our &s;ea breeze, and is more &s;alutary than any other. From South to We&s;t, the winds are hot, all the year round, and con&s;titute our mo&s;t noxious bla&s;ts. From We&s;t to North, the wind is at all &s;ea&s;ons cold, dry in winter, and accompanied with gu&s;ts in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t healthful &s;ea&s;on of our year is from the beginning of May, until the begin|ing
<PB N="215" REF="024239_0221_0FC56E41317F2480">
of Augu&s;t. During this period, the wea|ther is le&s;s variable than at other &s;ea&s;ons; and I have conceived, that the rapid progre&s;s of vegetation, during the Spring contributes not a little to render the Air &s;alubrious.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after Harve&s;t, our ende|mical &s;ickne&s;s begins. It generally increa&s;es throughout the month of Augu&s;t, and rages at its height during September.</P>
<P>BILIOUS, Intermitting and Remitting Fe|vers, differing only in degree and modificati|on, con&s;titute the principal group of our an|nual Fall Di&s;ea&s;es. Dy&s;enteries &s;ometimes appear, but not oftener than in other coun|tries; and it is remarkable, that Di&s;ea&s;es of this kind oftener afflict the higher di&s;tricts of New-Ca&s;tle, than the flat counties of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex. The Cholera Morbus is a fre|quent Di&s;ea&s;e in the hot months; and the Cholera Infantum, as de&s;cribed by Dr. Ru&s;h, has of late years made great deva&s;tation a|mong
<PB N="216" REF="024239_0222_0FC56E452407EC38">
our children, more e&s;pecially in the town of Dover. A &s;welled Spleen and vi&s;|ceral ob&s;tructions, are no uncommon con&s;e|quence of Fevers. Scorbutic and other pu|trid affections often make their appearance in unhealthful &s;ituations: And if our Remit|ting Fevers of the Fall are neglected or ill treated, they will often degenerate into the mo&s;t perfect Typhus.</P>
<P>WITH the commencement of fro&s;t in Oc|tober, the Fall Sickne&s;s abates in quantity, but wears very much the &s;ame type for a month or &s;ix weeks longer. The Bilious and Remitting Fevers of the Fall &s;eem to lay the foundation of our Winter Fevers: for it is very remarkable, that tho&s;e who have been the mo&s;t harra&s;&s;ed by the Endemical Fall Sickne&s;s, are the mo&s;t liable to the Synochous and Typhous Fever of the Winter. As to a &s;imply Inflammatory Fever, in which local Inflammation is &s;olely to be regarded, it is with us a rare occurrence indeed.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="024239_0223_0FC56E485E4B7288">
THE proportion of &s;ickne&s;s among our inhabitants is as various as the Soil and Cli|mate. In the highlands of New-Ca&s;tle, a man thinks him&s;elf quite unfortunate to be overtaken by an Epidemic Sickne&s;s, even in the fall of the year; whereas an inhabitant of the inland di&s;tricts of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex thinks him&s;elf lucky to e&s;cape a year or two together.</P>
<P>IN Wilmington and Lewes, the counte|nances of the inhabitants never flag, but at all &s;ea&s;ons witne&s;s the mo&s;t vigorous health.</P>
<P>IN Dover every inhabitant &s;uffers a demi|nution of health, during the fall &s;ea&s;on, and exhibits a more pale and languid face than at other times.</P>
<P>A PREVALENCY of South-We&s;t Winds above all things increa&s;es and exalts our Fall Sickne&s;s; but when the Ea&s;terly Winds pre|vail, during the &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on, or frequent
<PB N="218" REF="024239_0224_0FC56E49732AB970">
&s;howers happen from the North-We&s;t, they afford us great relief. Tho&s;e habitations that border on the water, and are openly ex-expo&s;ed to the &s;ea breeze, are every where healthy.</P>
<P>BOMBAYHOOK, though &s;urrounded by immen&s;e Mar&s;hes, is neverthele&s;s, next to Lewes, di&s;tingui&s;hed for the health of its In|habitants. The&s;e &s;everal facts taken toge|ther, lead us to conjecture, that Mar&s;h Mi|a&s;mata will not altogether account for our Fall Sickne&s;s, nor the peculiar noxious influ|ence of our South-We&s;t Winds, which in|jure us as manife&s;tly by the &s;udden thaws they occa&s;ion in Winter, as by their parching heat in Summer.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, a great change has taken place in the Di&s;ea&s;es of this part of the Country, as well of the hot as cold &s;ea|&s;on of the year. I can remember when re|gular Intermittents chiefly abounded in the Summer and Fall, and &s;imply Inflammatory
<PB N="219" REF="024239_0225_0FC56E4AF10C88A8">
Fevers in the Winter. The&s;e now give place to &s;evere Bilious Vomitings, and continued or Remitting Fevers in the Fall, and Synochous and Typhous Fevers in the Winter. For|merly we u&s;ed Tartar Emetic more freely and to greater advantage than we can at pre|&s;ent. Then, too, the Antiphlogi&s;tic method of treating Fevers &s;erved us well enough; now we have very little u&s;e for the Lancet.</P>
<P>OUR Bilious Vomitings are be&s;t treated by wa&s;hing out the Stomach with warm demul|cent Liquors, then quieting all di&s;turbance with Anodynes, and fini&s;hing the cure with Aromatics, Bark, and other Tonic Medicines.</P>
<P>OUR Bilious and Remitting Fevers re|quire evacuations more or le&s;s, have their exacerbations much relieved by Anodynes, and finally yield to the Bark.</P>
<P>IN the Cholera Infantum every irritat|ing Medicine taken into the Stomach
<PB N="220" REF="024239_0226_0FC56E4EE1C91BE0">
is injurious. To wa&s;h out the Stomach with Chamomile Tea and Chicken Water, is all the evacuation that can be attempted with advantage. Small do&s;es of Laudanum in the day and full do&s;es at night, become then the &s;overeign remedy. Bark and Camphor are mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly applied to the &s;kin: But nothing more than a palliative cure can be expected, without removing the Patient, from the noxious Air that fir&s;t gave the Bi|lious impre&s;&s;ion. For otherwi&s;e, if not killed outright, the Patient mu&s;t langui&s;h under the repeated recurrence of the di&s;order, with &s;uch re&s;pites now and then as may be barely termed remi&s;&s;ions, until the cold weather has made an entire change in the Atmo&s;phere. In this ca&s;e, therefore, we have recour&s;e to the Bay Shore; and it is &s;urpri&s;ing the effects of &s;nuffing the &s;ea breeze for a &s;ingle day. At Lewes I never heard of the Cholera Infan|tum; while at Dover it has for years pa&s;t, &s;wept off our children in a manner that is &s;carcely credible el&s;ewhere. This puts the efficacy of the &s;ea air in a &s;trong point of
<PB N="221" REF="024239_0227_0FC56E5036C6E748">
view; and I mention it that others may pro|fit by our experience and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>THE Fever mo&s;t prevalent with us in Win|ter, is preci&s;ely that de&s;cribed by D. Cullen, under the name of Synochus. Its fir&s;t attack is generally attended with aching pains all over, and very often with con&s;iderable Pul|monic affections. Another local affection that often attends it is the Enteritis. The Symptoms that give us the earlie&s;t and &s;ure&s;t warning of its true Type, are Headach and &s;ickne&s;s at the Stomach. Gentle evacuations of the Stomach and Bowels are proper in the beginning; but Antimonials are to be u&s;ed with caution. For the removal of local af|fections, we rely chiefly upon Bli&s;ters. The Lancet is never u&s;ed but upon extraordinary and pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ions. Languor and weak|ne&s;s &s;oon come on, and we watch the fir&s;t opportunity of giving the Bark. The mo&s;t free and liberal u&s;e of this important remedy is, at any time or Stage of the Di&s;order,
<PB N="222" REF="024239_0228_0FC56E54360D18E0">
warranted by a dry Tongue. Opium, Wine, Camphor, Volatiles, and all manner of &s;ti|mulants are often employed in the cour&s;e of the di&s;order, as nece&s;&s;ary auxiliaries of the Bark. As &s;oon as the Typhous form is cor|rectly marked, the mo&s;t cordial and nouri&s;h|ing diet is always u&s;ed.</P>
<P>NUMEROUS ob&s;ervations per&s;uade us, that our Typhous Fevers are more contagious than is generally apprehended. It is re|markable that more or le&s;s of a family will be affected in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, when a Fever of this &s;ort is introduced among them, accor|ding to the care ob&s;erved in cleanline&s;s and a free ventilation. The Typhus, therefore, is peculiarly noxious to negro families. It is &s;o common to trace infection from one per&s;on to another, that the requi&s;ite care to guard the family and vi&s;iting friends from contagi|on, is among the earlie&s;t and mo&s;t importu|nate in&s;tructions of our Phy&s;icians to their Patients.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="024239_0229_0FC56E55A98476B8">
THE &s;welling of the Spleen and other vi&s;|ceral ob&s;tructions, are be&s;t relieved by aperi|ent Gumous Medicines taken at the &s;ame time with Bitters, Aromatics and Tonics, and continued for a length of time. But a Pa|tient once impre&s;&s;ed with this kind of habit, is only to be &s;ecured from repeated relap&s;es, by a change of Climate.</P>

the latter of which is the boundary between it and Virginia.</P>
<P>EAST of the Blue Ridge of Mountains, which &s;tretches acro&s;s the We&s;tern part of this State, the Land, like that in all the Southern States, is generally level and free from Stones; of cour&s;e the Soil mu&s;t be &s;i|milar, as well as the generality of its natural productions.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;es of the Inhabitants, who re|&s;ide on Plantations, are often &s;everal Miles di&s;tant from each other, hence they appear to live very retired and un&s;ocial lives; and if we may be allowed to judge of the di&s;po&s;iti|on and manners of Men from the expre&s;&s;ion of their countenances, the generality of them live di&s;&s;atisfied and di&s;con&s;olate.</P>

the Digitalis in decoction, which he prefers to the powder.&mdash;For particulars he refers to a paper on the Drop&s;y by Era&s;mus Darwin, publi&s;hed in the Medical Tran&s;actions of the London College of Phy&s;icians; of which the following is a copy.</P>
<Q><P>BOIL of the fre&s;h green leaves of the Di|gitalis Purpurea, or Fox-glove, 40z. in com|mon water from two pints to one, and add to the &s;trained liquid of vinous &s;pirit, 20z.</P>
<P>OF this Decoction one large table &s;poon|ful is to be given early in the morning, in every variety of Idiopathic Drop&s;y, whether in the form of Hydrocephalus, Hydrothorax, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cites, or Ana&s;arca; and &s;hould be repeated every hour till the Patient has taken from three to eight or nine &s;poonfuls, or till &s;ick|ne&s;s or &s;ome other di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation is induced.</P></Q>
<P>THE Hydropic fluid generally di&s;appears

on the next day, or on the third day, with|out any repetition of the medicine, and fre|quently without any apparently increa&s;ed evacuation; at other times, with Vomiting and a large flow of Urine, and &s;ometimes with purging &s;tools.</P>
<P>To &s;ome who&s;e con&s;titutions appeared to be robu&s;ter, the do&s;e was increa&s;ed to half or a whole &s;poonful more, if the fir&s;t two or three &s;ingle &s;poonfuls occa&s;ioned no nau&s;ea.

ON the day after the exhibition of the Digitalis, or on the third day, or as &s;oon as the &s;ickne&s;s occa&s;ioned by it cea&s;ed, an infu|&s;ion of the &s;tem leaves of Artichoke, or a &s;trong Decoction of the Bark, with a &s;mall quantity of &s;ome Chalybeate Medicine, (of which I give the preference to the Flores Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tiales, from two to &s;ix grains, or in lieu of this, the Vitriol Martis, or common Cop|peras, as it is improperly called, from one quarter of a grain to two grains, di&s;&s;olved in &s;ome Aromatic Water, or mixed with Syrup of Ginger) was generally given twice a-day. and one grain of Opium every night, with as much Rhubarb or Aloes as occa&s;ioned a &s;tool next day. This quantity of Opium was per&s;i&s;ted in for &s;ome weeks, without increa&s;e or diminution, as it &s;eemed to be particularly &s;erviceable.</P>

<Q><P>IT is ob&s;ervable, that when a &s;ufficient do&s;e of the Foxglove Decoction is given at fir&s;t to produce the effect de&s;ired, a much le&s;s quantity will have the &s;ame effect after|wards.

<P>&rindx; THUS if ten grains of Aloes be at fir&s;t exhibited as a Cathartic, the do&s;e may be gra|dually decrea&s;ed to one grain, and it will &s;till produce the &s;ame effect, the con&s;titution having acquired a habit of obeying its &s;ti|mulus.
<PB N="245" REF="024239_0251_0FC56E90AF160038">
On the contrary, if one grain of Aloes be at fir&s;t exhibited, and does not Purge the Patient, it may be increa&s;ed by &s;low degrees to twenty grains without prov|ing Cathartic.</P>

cannot prevail on my&s;elf to conclude, with|out a &s;hort animadver&s;ion on the new and incon&s;i&s;tent Doctrine taught and publi&s;hed by the late Dr. Brown of Edinburgh. This man (who&s;e talents I admire, and if he had employed them in the &s;ervice of truth, I &s;hould have venerated) has had the pre&s;umption to a&s;&s;ert, that there is not a direct Sedative in nature. What then are the contagions which produce different &s;pe|cies of Idiopathic Fever, Dy&s;entery, and Pe&s;tilence? If the primary operation of the&s;e is to produce weakne&s;s, are they not direct Sedatives in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the term. Does their operation con&s;i&s;t in the privation or ab&s;traction of Stimuli? (which they ought to do con&s;i&s;tent with one of the funda|mental principles of this Doctrine). By no means.&mdash;Do they produce their effects by their exciting power, wa&s;ting the exci|tability, and producing weakne&s;s of the indirect kind by that means?&mdash;Surely no, for they are a&s;&s;i&s;ted in their effects by
<PB N="253" REF="024239_0259_0FC56EA806F62E48">
Hunger, Cold, Grief, which are privations or ab&s;tractions of &s;timulant powers. On the contrary, their effects are retarded or counter|acted by Stimulant Powers. The&s;e Con|tagions operate &s;lowly, and the Patient feels indi&s;po&s;ition for &s;everal days before he is &s;eized with Fever.</P>
<P>WINE induces indirect weakne&s;s, but the Sy&s;tem is fir&s;t exce&s;&s;ively &s;timulated.</P>
<P>BY &s;imply drawing into the Lungs a con|&s;iderable portion of fixed Air, i&s;&s;uing from any fermenting liquor, a heathy man is in&s;tantly killed, whereas if the atmo&s;phere, or the de|phlogi&s;ticated Air, which forms the greate&s;t portion of it be excluded for &s;everal minutes, he is not deprived of life; but if animation or motion, the effects of animation, be &s;u&s;|pended thereby, he may generally be re&s;tored by inflating his Lungs with pure atmo&s;pheric Air again.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="024239_0260_0FC56EAD360E8040">
THIS has been fully proved by the experiments of the late ingenious Dr. Ed|mond Goodwin, in his E&s;&s;ay on the Connection of Life with Re&s;piration; from whence it appears, that the generality of drowned per&s;ons may be re&s;tored to life by the application of external heat to the body, gradually applied, till it equals that of an inflammatory Fever, or 112 degrees of Fahrenheit's Thermometer; after which, and not before, the Lungs are to be inflated by a pair of bellows, pa&s;&s;ed into one of the no&s;|trils, giving five or &s;ix bla&s;ts &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and then intermitting half a minute or more, to ob&s;erve the effect, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN order to produce the requi&s;ite heat, the Hot-bath is the be&s;t means; but when that cannot be procured, the Patient &s;hould be laid on hot &s;alt, or a&s;hes, which &s;hould be convered with a woollen blanket, and him&s;elf covered with three or four others, well-heated. Heated Salt, A&s;hes, or Sand in Woollen Bags, or Jugs of boiling Water, e&s;|pecially

the latter, being applied to or near his feet at the &s;ame time." Excu&s;e me for tran&s;|cribing what I am &s;ure you have often peru&s;ed in the work at large.</P>
<P>TO conclude, the fair deduction from the Doctrine of Mr. Brown, is, that, as no Di&s;ea&s;e can &s;urvive its Cau&s;e, it mu&s;t cea&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity in all Ca&s;es where the excitement is to exce&s;s, as &s;oon as that exce&s;&s;ive excite|ment is reduced by the ab&s;traction of Stimu|lant Powers to a certain point at which Health is &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;t; and that in all ca&s;es of Debility, where the excitement is below the healthy point of the imaginary Scale, it mu&s;t al&s;o nece&s;&s;arily cea&s;e &s;o &s;oon as a &s;ufficient number of Stimuli have been applied, as the Sy&s;tem mu&s;t be thereby rai&s;ed to that point; or if too violent Stimuli be applied, &s;o as to rai&s;e the excitement beyond that point, it will be changed into a Di&s;ea&s;e of the oppo&s;ite nature and form.</P>

<P>It is remarkable, that proceeding in the &s;ame parallel of latitude we&s;twardly, the Climate becomes colder in like manner, as well as when you proceed northwardly.</P>
<P>THIS continues to be the ca&s;e till you attain the &s;ummit of the Alleghany, which is the highe&s;t land between the ocean and the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. From thence de&s;cending in the &s;ame latitude to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, the change

<Q><P>The difference of temperature in the Air at the Sea Coa&s;t, or the Che&s;apeake-Bay, and at the Alleghany has not been a&s;certained; but cotemporary ob&s;ervations made at Wil|liam&s;burgh, or in its neighbourhood, and at Monticello, the latter of which is &s;ituated nearly central between the Bay and Allegha|ny, or between the Southern and Northern Boundaries of the State, may be con&s;idered as furni&s;hing the be&s;t average of the tempe|rature of its Climate. The&s;e Ob&s;ervations

<P>WILLIAMSBURGH is much too near the South-Ea&s;t Corner to give a fair idea of the general temperature.</P>
<P>BUT a more remarkable difference is in the Winds which prevail in the different parts of the Country.</P></Q>
<P>FROM Mr. Jeffer&s;on's Meteorological Tables it appears, that the South-We&s;t Wind prevails equally at William&s;burg and Monti|cello; that the North-Ea&s;t is next to this the principal Wind towards the Sea-Coa&s;t, and the North-We&s;t is the predominant Wind at the Mountains. The difference between the&s;e two Winds to &s;en&s;ation, and in fact, is very great; the North-Ea&s;t is loaded with vapour, in&s;o|much that the Salt Manufacturers have found that their chry&s;tals would not &s;hoot
<PB N="265" REF="024239_0271_0FC56ECB42A7BFA0">
while that blows, it occa&s;ions a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing chill, and a heavine&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;pirits. The North-We&s;t is dry, cooling, ela&s;tic, and animating. The Ea&s;tern and South-Ea&s;tern breezes come on generally in the afternoon. They have advanced into the country very &s;en&s;ibly within the memory of people now living. As the lands become more cleared, it is probable that they will ex|tend &s;till farther We&s;tward. The farther they extend into the Country, the le&s;s moi&s;t they become, as they depo&s;it it in their pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<Q><P>The variation in the weight of the At|mo&s;phere, as indicated by the Barometer, is not equal to two inches of Mercury. Dur|ing twelve months ob&s;ervation at William&s;|burg, the extremes were 29 and 30.86 in|ches, the difference being 1.86 of an inch; and in nine months, during which the height of the Mercury was noted at Mon|ticello, the extremes were 28.48 and 29.69
<PB N="266" REF="024239_0272_0FC56ECE9D52AEF0">
inches, the variation being 1.21 of an inch. A Gentleman, &s;ays Mr. Jeffer&s;on, who has ob&s;erved his Barometer many years a&s;&s;ures me it has never varied two inches.</P>
<P>Cotemporary Ob&s;ervations, made at Monticello and William&s;burgh, proved the variation in the weight of the Air, to be &s;imultaneous and corre&s;ponding in the&s;e two places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the&s;e Ob&s;ervations are accurate, Monticello mu&s;t be at an equal height from the level of the Ocean with William&s;|burgh, for the Mercury in the Barometer falls one-tenth of an inch for every 90 feet perpendicular, that we a&s;cend above that level.</NOTE></P>

<P>AT William&s;burgh, in Augu&s;t 1777, the Mercury in Farenheit's Thermometer was at 98&deg;, core&s;ponding with 29&frac12; of Reaumur. At the &s;ame place, in January 1780, it was 6&deg;. corre&s;ponding to 11&frac12; below o of Reau|mur. I believe the&s;e may be con&s;idered as the extremes of Heat and Cold in that part of the country. The latter may mo&s;t cer|tainly, as at that time York River at York|town was frozen over, &s;o that people walked acro&s;s it; a circum&s;tance which proves it to
<PB N="268" REF="024239_0274_0FC56ED4AC7E03C0">
have been colder than the Winter of 1740-1, u&s;ually called the <HI>hard</HI> Winter, when York River did not freeze over at that place. In the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of 1780, Che&s;apeake-Bay was &s;olid from its head to the mouth of Pa|towmac.</P>
<P>AT Annapolis where it is 5&frac14; miles over be|tween the neare&s;t points of land, the ice was from five to &s;even inches thick quite acro&s;s, &s;o that loaded carriages went over on it.</P>
<P>THOSE extremes of Heat and Cold, at 6&deg; and 98&deg;, Mr. Jeffer&s;on ob&s;erves, were in|deed very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and were thought to put the human con&s;titution to the extent of trial. Yet, continues the &s;ame re&s;pectable Author, a Siberian would have con&s;idered them as &s;carcely a &s;en&s;ible variation.</P>
<P>AT Jenne&s;eitz, in that country, in latitude 58&deg; 27&prime;, we are told, that the cold in 1735 &s;unk the Mercury by Farenheit's Scale to
<PB N="269" REF="024239_0275_0FC56ED5CBDE7F78">
126&deg; below nought; and the inhabitants of the &s;ame country u&s;e &s;tove rooms two or three times a week, in which they &s;tay two hours at a time, the Atmo&s;phere of which rai&s;es the Mercury to 135&deg; above nothing.</P>
<P>LATE experiments &s;hew, that the human body will live in rooms heated to 347 de|grees, that is 135&deg;. above boiling water.</P>
<P>THE hotte&s;t point of the twenty-four hours is about four o'clock, P. M.; and the dawn of day the colde&s;t.</P>
<P>ON comparing the extremes of Heat and Cold at William&s;burg, with the &s;ame at Paris, it appears they are in greater at Paris.</P>
<P>THE acce&s;s of Fro&s;t in Autumn, and its rece&s;s in the Spring, do not &s;eem to depend merely on the degree of Cold; much le&s;s on the Air's being at the freezing point. That other circum&s;tances mu&s;t be combined with the Cold to produce Fro&s;t, is evident
<PB N="270" REF="024239_0276_0FC56ED7347638B8">
from this al&s;o, that on the higher parts of Mountains, where it is ab&s;olutely colder than in the plains on which they &s;tand, Fro&s;ts do appear &s;o early by a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time in Autumn, and go off &s;ooner in the Spring than on the plains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the Summer Sea&s;on, the Vapours by the time they at|tain to to the height of the Mountains become &s;o attenuated, that they have not &s;ufficient gravity to &s;ub&s;ide, and form a dew when the Sun retires.</P>
<P><HI>Vid. Jeffer&s;on's Notes on Virginia, page 87.</HI></P></NOTE>. This greater privilege a|gain&s;t the Fro&s;t on Mountains, is undoubt|edly combined with the want of dew there. That the dew is very rare in their higher parts, I may &s;ay with certainty, (&s;ays Mr. Jeffer&s;on) from twelve years ob&s;ervations, having &s;carcely ever &s;een during that time, an unequivocal proof of its exi&s;tence at all on them during Summer.</P>
<P>That unfortunate fluctuation between Heat and Cold, &s;o de&s;tructive to Fruit, prevails le&s;s in Virginia than in Penn&s;ylvania in the Spring Sea&s;on; nor is the overflowing of the

<P>IN Virginia below the Mountains, the Snow &s;eldom lies more than a day or two, and &s;eldom a week; and the large rivers very &s;eldom freeze over.

The Remedies which the Phy&s;icians of this place have found mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful in this Di&s;ea&s;e, have been a repetition of mild Emetics, and the application of Bli&s;ters to the Wri&s;ts, as well as to the parts affected, and a few Drops of Laudanum, and Antimonial Wine, every three or four hours, in a Draught of Barley Gruel, or Tea made of Lin&s;eed and Sage, for the fir&s;t two or three days after its attack; but if the debi|lity increa&s;es, we find nothing equal to Vola|tile Alkaline Salts and Wine Whey. Good effects have al&s;o been &s;ometimes produced by a Decoction of the Seneca Root, given in &s;uch Draughts as to create a &s;light nau&s;ea. Bleeding has been ob&s;erved to aggravate the Di&s;ea&s;e &s;o frequently, that the lancet has al|mo&s;t fallen into di&s;credit. I however, always venture to open a vein when the pain is acute, and the re&s;piration difficult, and &s;ometimes

a repetition, but am very cautious in the quan|tity drawn at once. The lowne&s;s of our &s;i|tuation, and the long continued and exce&s;&s;ive heats to which we are &s;ubject, render us a|mazingly infirm, and occa&s;ion a Diathe&s;is of &s;o lax a texture, that an inflammatory affec|tion cannot exi&s;t many days without termi|nating in a gangrene. I have &s;ometimes had thoughts of trying the effects of Mercurial Frictions in this Di&s;ea&s;e, becau&s;e of the analogy it bears to the Hepatitis which occurs in hot Climates; but have hitherto been deterred from the attempt, owing to cer|tain con&s;cientious &s;cruples.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;ometimes followed the method recommended by Dr. Hamilton, in the ma|nagement of Inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es, and have given from one to three grains of Calomel, and from one-fourth to a grain of Opium, and as much Tartar Emetic, to which I have &s;ometimes added a few grains of Camphor, made into a Bolu&s;s with con&s;erve of Ro&s;es,

every &s;ix or eight hours, for &s;everal days, accompanied with a Decoction of Seneca, Sar&s;aparilla, and Liquorice Root, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es with immediate and evident advan|tage; but I mu&s;t ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s, that the major part of the Ca&s;es in which I have employed it, as well as every other Remedy, has hitherto failed with me.</P>
<P>THE extreme weakne&s;s and dejection, hinder large and repeated Bleedings, which are the only things capable of removing genuine Inflammations.</P>
<P>FROM the Summer Sol&s;tice till after the middle of September, Choleras and Diarr|hoeas are epidemic here, and are &s;o mor|tal among Children that it has given ri&s;e to a common, but very erroneous notion, that none born here ever arrive to Manhood, whereas I am very certain, that more than two-thirds of the number born here annually, do not die the &s;ame year; what proportion

arrive to Manhood, I have not been able to a&s;certain as yet, but &s;hall &s;et about the en|quiry as &s;oon as I have lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE Flux commonly occurs about the middle of Augu&s;t, and continues more or le&s;s epidemic till the Fro&s;t &s;ets in, which is &s;eldom before the middle of October.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;ea&s;e does not occur every year; is more common in cool and wet Summers than in warm and dry ones. I am &s;orry, that it is not in my power to re&s;olve your que&s;tion about its being infectious; but from the pre|prevalency of that opinion, and from the ac|count given by Lind, in his papers on infec|tion, I am inclined to think it is.</P>
<P>OUR Plan of Cure in this Di&s;ea&s;e differs con&s;iderably from that recommended by Dr. Cullen:&mdash;We tru&s;t principally to Decoctions of Bark, Snake-root, and Rhubarb, with the liberal u&s;e of Opium, and Vinous, or other
<PB N="276" REF="024239_0282_0FC56EE6F2853E28">
Spirituous Drinks; and when the debility is great, we employ the Hot-bath, and ap|ply Rubefacients to the Abdomen and Limbs. This treatment perhaps, in a different &s;itua|tion, would be improper and injurious; but I declare upon my honour, it &s;eldom fails curing the Di&s;ea&s;e in this place, where it is punctually adhered to.</P>
<P>OUR Intermitting and Remitting Fevers begin very early in Autumn, and continue to be more or le&s;s epidemic till the middle of Win|ter, e&s;pecially the former.</P>
<P>In the Cure of the Remitting Fever, we find the bark by no means effectual, without the liberal u&s;e of Wine; and in very relaxed habits, we find it nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to Brandy; this la&s;t, taken in &s;mall quantities, and repeated every hour, without any addition, has &s;ucceeded with us in many Ca&s;es of Remittent, accompanied with great Dejection of Strength and Depre&s;&s;ion of Spi|rits,
<PB N="277" REF="024239_0283_0FC56EEBF2A6C048">
when the Bark alone has had every ap|perance of aggravating the Di&s;ea&s;e. Hux|ham's Tincture is con&s;idered as a Catholicon.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e circum&s;tances you will be led to think us all Drunkards; this, however, is by no means the ca&s;e. We live full, and drink freely, but &s;eldom &s;o much as to in|duce intoxication. But the Heat of our Cli|mate, and our confined &s;ituation, (being &s;hut out from the acce&s;s of the Winds, by high hills on every &s;ide) has &s;uch an effect on our Con&s;titutions that they very nearly re&s;emble tho&s;e of hard Drinkers;&mdash;hence, we require a con&s;iderable quantity of Stimulating Ali|ment, and Vinous Drinks, to keep up a ba|lance between the &s;everal functions of the body.</P>
<P>I HAVE never met with any Ca&s;e of Te|tanus, but what aro&s;e in con&s;equence of a le&s;ion of a nervous part;&mdash;and though I have the highe&s;t Veneration and e&s;teem for Dr.

Ru&s;h, who&s;e experience and ingenuity &s;tand unrivalled in our Country, I have never yet had the courage to omit the employment of Opium in large Do&s;es, repeated every 4th, 6th, or 8th hour, while any Spa&s;modic Symp|toms remained, along with the liberal u&s;e of hot Brandy-Tody, and high &s;ea&s;oned Soup, in which Cayenne Pepper, was a principal Ingredient.</P>
<P>I HAVE read both Sydenham and Brown, and though I think them both eccentric and erroneous in many things, I am convinced a man of judgment may derive in&s;truction from them both.</P></Q>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD the honour of receiving your favour of March the 6th, which mentions your having undertaken a Work, the utility
<PB N="279" REF="024239_0285_0FC56EF1B26F77F0">
of which has been long impre&s;&s;ed on my mind; and the execution of which I once had in contemplation, though on a &s;cale le&s;s exten|&s;ive than the one you propo&s;e. It occurred to me &s;oon after my return from Europe, that an account of the Climate, modes of Living, and the Di&s;ea&s;es of the lower parts of Vir|ginia, after the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er of Cleghorne's Mi|norca, might be of &s;ome &s;ervice in inve&s;ti|gating the Cau&s;es and improving the treat|ment of the Epidemics, and perhaps might induce the Medical Gentlemen di&s;per&s;ed over other parts of the State, to record and publi&s;h their ob&s;ervations, &s;o as to form altogether, a book of u&s;eful practice. The interruption which would have been given to my bu&s;ine&s;s, however, and finding that more experience and time would be requi&s;ite than I could conveniently &s;pare, prevented my pur&s;uing the idea. From your advantageous &s;ituation, and your endeavours to collect information, there can be no doubt, but the performance will receive all the advantage which the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of able and experienced Practition|ers,
<PB N="280" REF="024239_0286_0FC56EF5CEEE4400">
united with your own ob&s;ervations, can afford; and I am &s;orry that profe&s;&s;ional engagements, mo&s;tly in the country, and the &s;hort notice, will not allow me to an&s;wer your queries to my &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>I AM at pre&s;ent re&s;iding in Hanover|town, which is &s;ituated nearly at the head of navigation, on the South &s;ide of Pamunkey, the principal Branch of York River. It con|tains about one hundred and &s;eventy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The County of Hanover, by the late Cen&s;us, contains 14,300 Inhabitants.</NOTE> inhabi|tants, and is &s;upported chiefly by Merchants, who have placed them&s;elves here for the convenience of purcha&s;ing the be&s;t Tobacco in the State, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be brought to the public warehou&s;es at this place.</P>
<P>IT was thriving fa&s;t before the &s;eat of government was removed to Richmond;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Richmond, the pre&s;ent Seat of Government in this State, is built upon a commanding eminence on the North &s;ide of James's River, a little way below the Falls, and ninety miles from its mouth, contains about 360 hou&s;es, and 2000 inhabi|tants. This Town is about &s;ixty miles We&s;tward of William&s;|burgh, which contains about nine hundred inhabitants, and is about twenty-five miles Northward of Peter&s;burgh. This la&s;t is built on the South &s;ide of Appomatox River, in a low &s;ituation.</NOTE>
<PB N="281" REF="024239_0287_0FC56EF6CF3E82F8">
but that city being only twenty miles di&s;tant, has con&s;iderably altered the channel of trade and retarded its increa&s;e. The town is built on an exten&s;ive plain, and the lands for many miles above and below it, are remarkably level and fertile, and the country in tho&s;e di|rections is generally thought the mo&s;t beau|tiful in Virginia;&mdash;but if its inhabitants po&s;|&s;e&s;s &s;uperior advantages in the kindne&s;s of their &s;oil, they &s;uffer almo&s;t a proportional de|duction from their profits and other enjoy|ments, by being expo&s;ed to attacks from the Intermittent and Remittent Fevers, for two or three months in every year.</P>
<P>THE Country may be divided into low grounds, &s;econd low grounds or more ele|vated, and the hills, which commence where the latter terminate. The former which
<PB N="282" REF="024239_0288_0FC56B795B977A00">
con&s;titute the banks of the river, are &s;ubject to frequent inundations in the Spring and Fall; and many of them retain &s;o much moi&s;ture throughout the year, as only to be fit for pa&s;tures, and are never cultivated. You will readily, therefore, conceive their &s;ituation towards the end of Summer, when the putrid exhalations go on rapidly, and you will al&s;o anticipate a de&s;cription of tho&s;e Intermittent and Remittent Fevers which Mar&s;h Mia&s;ma &s;o con&s;tantly produces. They are mo&s;tly Quotidians or Tertians; Quartans are &s;een but &s;eldom, but if not &s;peedily cured, are apt to continue twelve, eighteen months, or two years, e&s;pecially with poor people; and I have &s;een fat and hearty Children have it for years, without any apparent injury to their health, excepting for a few hours on the fit-day. Our Winters are commonly mild, ex|cepting a few weeks about Chri&s;tmas, and though we may at other times have &s;evere weather, it &s;eldom continues long. The hard Fro&s;ts commence the la&s;t of December, and continue without much interruption all
<PB N="283" REF="024239_0289_0FC56B7A674EAEE0">
January and part of February, when there are frequent changes, and often much warm moi&s;t weather, from which time I date the beginning of the Spring Complaints. They are commonly Pneumonic or Pleuritic at|tacks, accompanied with chills, nau&s;ea, and bilious vomiting. The pain begins in the &s;ide, brea&s;t, or &s;houlder blade, and not un|frequently changes from one &s;ide to the other, or darts through from the brea&s;t to the &s;houl|der. The chill is of &s;hort duration, and &s;uc|ceeded by the Fever, with a pain in the head, back, and large joints. A frequent dry Cough teazes the Patient, and renders the pain more acute, increa&s;es with the approach of night, and cau&s;es that to be very di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing. The pul&s;e varies from 90 to 120, and at fir&s;t is generally hard and full. Towards morning the Fever &s;uffers &s;ome remi&s;&s;ion, but by the middle of the day is higher than before. The fir&s;t attack is attended with bilious vomitings, which exceedingly alarm the &s;ick; but if properly encouraged, relieve
<PB N="284" REF="024239_0290_0FC56B7F205EF108">
the &s;tomach, and are &s;eldom dangerous unle&s;s when injudiciou&s;ly treated.</P>
<P>OUR mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful Remedies in the Cure of this Compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">int, are Bleeding, Bli&s;|ters, Laxatives, mild Diluents, and gentle Su|dorifics. Early in the Di&s;ea&s;e we take away ten or twelve ounces of Blood, and if the pain is not removed, Cough continues dry, and pul&s;e hard, the &s;ame quantity is drawn before the Bli&s;ter is applied, which is probably the &s;ame night or the next morning.</P>
<P>THE violence of the Inflammation, age and vigour of the Patient, and the nature of the Epidemic, govern the Lancet, for we fre|quently have a &s;pecies of Synochus in the Spring e&s;pecially after a warm Winter, which re|quires great caution in Bleeding. I have &s;een many this year, with acute pains in the Head and &s;hort Ribs, when the Pul&s;e was uncom|monly low and &s;oft at the commencement of the Di&s;ea&s;e. In &s;uch ca&s;es, Bli&s;ters to the part
<PB N="285" REF="024239_0291_0FC56B8039781CC8">
were the only Remedies to be relied on, with Wine and Water for con&s;tant drink, and the Bark in quantity, as &s;oon as the pain was re|moved. An Anodyne at night, after the In|flammation is abated, quiets the Cough, oc|ca&s;ions the Patient to re&s;t well, and with an Antimonial, di&s;po&s;es to a free per&s;piration. Since the Influenza prevailed here, I have learnt to u&s;e Opiates more freely in all Com|plaints attended with a Cough, after the In|flammation is removed, than I had before ventured to do. The conte&s;t, which has been &s;o warmly &s;upported by the partizans of Cul|len and Brown, mu&s;t be left to the deci&s;ion of others; but I am fully per&s;uaded, that the Doctrines of the latter have tended mate|rially to remove prejudices, and to introduce more liberally into practice, one of the mo&s;t valuable a&s;&s;i&s;tants to the healing Art, though I have more than once witne&s;&s;ed the impro|per u&s;e of it by his pupils; &s;uch has been the ca&s;e with many valuable Medicines, and it was from Goulard's extravagant recommen|dations

of the Solutions of Lead that we be|came acquainted with their real virtues.</P>
<P>THE Blacks are remarkably &s;ubject to in|flammatory Complaints from their expo&s;ure and deficiency of Cloathing; and I have ob|&s;erved that they require the u&s;e of the Lan|cet with con&s;iderably more freedom than the Whites. They are accu&s;tomed to bleed for the mo&s;t trifling Di&s;ea&s;es, and it is often dif|ficult to per&s;uade them of their recovery from any di&s;order without opening a vein. There are but few even of them, however, that would bear the lo&s;s of forty-eight, or fifty-&s;even ounces, as mentioned by Cleghorn, though our di&s;ea&s;es corre&s;pond very much with tho&s;e de&s;cribed by him; and I conceive, that half the quantity he took away during the fir&s;t twenty-four hours, with the timely applica|tion of Bli&s;ters, will conquer mo&s;t Pneumo|nic attacks with us, except in very particular con&s;titutions.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="024239_0293_0FC56B893B405D90">
SOME Ca&s;es of Phthi&s;is Pulmonalis oc|cur generally in the Spring, for which I have endeavoured equally to avoid the weakening antiphlogi&s;tic, and the highly &s;timulating mode of treatment. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to give a detail of practice in this Di&s;ea&s;e; and I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that in a few in&s;tances, con&s;iderable benefit is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been received from the u&s;e of a Swing, as recom|mended by Dr. Smyth, where the Patients were weak and much reduced, it was &s;u&s;pended in the hou&s;e, and convenient for u&s;e in all weather.</P>
<P>As the Spring advances, various erup|tive complaints appear, and among the Blacks Scrophulous Swellings inflame and &s;uppurate every year. To palliate the Di&s;ea&s;e from &s;ea|&s;on to &s;ea&s;on, and let the Con&s;titution acquire vigour enough to conquer it, and the danger|ous period of life has pa&s;t, which &s;eldom ex|tends beyond twenty-five, is all I ever could accompli&s;h, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, I have been much perplexed to do that. Of late, the
<PB N="288" REF="024239_0294_0FC56B8AD1538C00">
internal u&s;e of Blue Vitriol has been &s;trongly recommended by a famous empirick, and as I have at pre&s;ent &s;ome opportunities of trying it, I &s;hall attend particularly to its admini|&s;tration and effects.</P>
<P>THE Cynanche Ton&s;ilaris frequently oc|curs; for which &s;trong mercurial purges, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by Bli&s;ters, have &s;ucceeded better with me than any other Remedies. The Cy|nanche Maligna has al&s;o prevailed in &s;ome parts of the State, but I think it fortunate that it has not been my lot to engage it.</P>
<P>THE Mea&s;les, la&s;t year, added to the li&s;t of Epidemics, revived the old di&s;pute re&s;pecting the propriety of Bleeding for it; &s;ome ca&s;es having terminated fatally after profu&s;e Bleeding, it was con&s;idered by many as a fatal practice, though I do not recollect my having had cau&s;e to repent moderate Bleeding in any in&s;tance, while the advantage in many was very apparent; and in &s;ome, they left &s;o
<PB N="289" REF="024239_0295_0FC56B92841E8508">
great inflammation on the Lungs, that re|peated Venae&s;ection was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THE Months of June and July are the mo&s;t healthy in the year, though they are often as hot, and &s;ometimes more &s;o, than the &s;ucceeding. The Weather is then dry, and le&s;s liable to change than in Augu&s;t and Sep|tember, when the rain commences, and &s;ud|den variations take place. Intermittents &s;el|dom appear till after the tenth of Augu&s;t, and from that period to the &s;ame day in Oc|tober, all Families on the Rivers and Creeks, have it con&s;tantly among them. The noc|turnal Air at this time is to be cautiou&s;ly avoided, and the &s;lighte&s;t expo&s;ure or irregu|larity, will endanger an attack by a Quoti|dian or Tertian. We con&s;ider Madeira, Port Wine, and Porter, as the be&s;t pre&s;erva|tives; and it is certain, that tho&s;e who make daily u&s;e of them in moderation, are not &s;o often &s;ick, and with &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, recover &s;oone&s;t. The Fit, on the fir&s;t evening of the
<PB N="290" REF="024239_0296_0FC56B93B27FE6F8">
attack, is commonly &s;light, and &s;ometimes with a Chill and Fever hardly perceptible, and an aching of the Bones, which is taken for Rheumatic. The next Fit comes on earlier in the day with more violent pains in the Joints, &s;ucceeded by a Chilline&s;s, as if &s;treams of cold Water were running down the Back; nor can any Warmth be excited until the reaction of the Sy&s;tem takes place. It is a general ob&s;ervation, that the Ague has changed within a few years from violent Shaking to a &s;mart Chill, and though I can remember to have &s;een the Teeth chatter, it is &s;eldom theca&s;e now. As the Fever ri&s;es a Glow on the Surface is vi&s;ible, the Face be|gins to flu&s;h, and with that a Head-ach com|mences, which increa&s;es with the Fever, and continues as long as that la&s;ts. The Pul&s;e, which during the cold Fit is weak and &s;mall, ri&s;es gradually to fulne&s;s and quick|ne&s;s; the Drought is con&s;iderable, and the Tongue and Mouth dry and parched. After a few hours a Sweat begins to break out, which gives much relief, and by the Morn|ing
<PB N="291" REF="024239_0297_0FC56B958856FAB0">
carries off the Fever, leaving the Body weak and feeble, the Tongue furred, with lo&s;s of Appetite, and a bitter Ta&s;te in the Mouth. As the cold Fit goes off, a Vomit|ing of Bile often takes place, and if properly encouraged, di&s;charges the Morbid Contents of the Stomach, and removes the Sickne&s;s; for Dr. Moore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical Sketches</NOTE> has well ob&s;erved, that Vomit|ing is mo&s;t effectually cured by Vomiting.</P>
<P>THE Paroxy&s;ms are nearly the &s;ame, whether they are Tertians, Quartans, or Quo|tidians, and the &s;ame treatment will generally effect the Cure of each.</P>
<P>IF the Head-ach is violent, with a full and &s;trong Pul&s;e, eight or ten ounces of Blood are taken away at the Height of the Fever, and an Emetic, compo&s;ed of Ipecacuanha and Tartar, is directed to be taken early in the Morning &s;ucceeding the Fit, and if it both vomits and purges well, the Bark is admini|&s;tered without delay, &s;o as to get &s;ix or eight
<PB N="292" REF="024239_0298_0FC56B9DAA228F60">
drams down before the next period of acce&s;|&s;ion. If it does not &s;top the next Fit, it &s;o weakens it, that another ounce an&s;wers the purpo&s;e, and the u&s;e of it in &s;maller quantity for a few days re&s;tores health. If the Bark does not prove laxative, a purge &s;hould be interpo&s;ed, to prevent the accumulation of Bile in the Primae Viae, which will either occa&s;ion the Bark to be rejected, or occa&s;ion violent pain in the Stomach. In the Cure of Remittents, which are at pre&s;ent more com|mon than formerly, we &s;eldom wait for the Fever to go entirely off; but if the Bowels have been properly evacuated, and a general moi&s;ture can be accompli&s;hed, I have given the Bark when the Pul&s;e was at 90&deg; or 100&deg;, and have found it to increa&s;e the Sweating, and thus have prevented the return of the Fever, which could not &s;o ea&s;ily have been done, if that Medicine had been delayed: I am, however, fully &s;en&s;ible that there are errors committed, in giving it ha&s;tily before the Primae Viae have been &s;ufficiently clean&s;ed; and I have often &s;een this done effectually by
<PB N="293" REF="024239_0299_0FC56B9F052F3D70">
an Emetic, when repeated Purgatives have failed. I have known Vomiting objected to by Phy&s;icians of reputation, as being an un|natural operation; but this only applies to Health, for a &s;ick Stomach voluntarily re|lieves it&s;elf. Among the lower cla&s;s of people, with whom the Intermittent often continues twelve or eighteen months, and &s;ometimes for years, Abdominal Conge&s;tions, Ulcerated Legs, and Drop&s;ical Swellings, are not unfrequently the con&s;equence. As the following ca&s;e, which I attended la&s;t year, was from this cau&s;e, I &s;hall take the liberty of concluding this letter with it, though it may be thought already too long. Having been often di&s;appointed in my expectations from Diuretics, the &s;ucce&s;s which attended the admini&s;tration of Squills in this in&s;tance induced me to recored it.</P>

Mill Ponds. They both appeared to be in the la&s;t &s;tage of the Drop&s;y, and one of them died a few days afterwards. The death of the olde&s;t, (perhaps &s;he might be about twelve or thirteen years of age), appeared to be al|mo&s;t as certain, though it might not be &s;o &s;oon: She had been troubled with an Inter|mittent for nearly two years, which had left her about a month before in a &s;tate of great debility. A &s;hort time after the Fever cea&s;ed, the Swelling of her Abdomen was di&s;covered, and was &s;oon followed by an Ana&s;arca of all the lower parts of her Body, even as high as her Brea&s;ts. When I was called in, her Legs were hard, ten&s;e, and cracked and ulcerated in &s;everal places, &s;o as to make painful &s;ores. Her Breathing was laborious and difficult, and her Coughing almo&s;t con&s;tant. Her Face was al&s;o con&s;iderably &s;welled, and for &s;everal nights &s;he had been obliged to &s;leep in an erect po&s;ture. Her Abdomen was greatly di&s;ten|ded, and an evident fluctuation of the water within, was to be felt. If &s;he laid down on her &s;ide for any time, it left the &s;uperior

<P>HER appearance altogether was &s;o un|favourable, that nothing but her youth af|forded any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; and I under|took to admini&s;ter Medicines more for the &s;atisfaction of the Patient, than from any hopes of my own.</P>
<P>AFTER trying &s;everal Remedies with little benefit, I was almo&s;t per&s;uaded it would be nece&s;&s;ary to evacuate the water from her Abdomen by the Trocar; but was afraid, that at &s;uch an advanced &s;tage of the Di&s;ea&s;e, the operation might ha&s;ten her exit, in&s;tead of preventing it. In this &s;ituation I determined make the la&s;t effort, with Squills combined with Nitre, and gave it in the following manner:

SHE began the u&s;e of them on Friday morning, and I did not &s;ee her again until Monday, when the good effect from them was &s;urpri&s;ingly great. She informed me that &s;he felt her&s;elf much better on Saturday, and re&s;ted more comfortably that night than &s;he had for many nights before. On Sun|day a con&s;iderable increa&s;e of urine was evi|dent, and the Swelling of her Belly began to &s;ub&s;ide. On Monday, I found the water almo&s;t entirely removed, and her Legs and Thighs &s;o reduced, that &s;he could walk with ea&s;e, which before had been very painful. Her appetite was much increa&s;ed, and &s;he expre&s;&s;ed by the joy in her countenance, the relief &s;he had obtained, and the change from mi&s;ery and de&s;pair to ea&s;e, and the plea&s;ing, though unexpected pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy re|covery of Health. The Squill Pills were continued for a few days, which entirely carried off the water, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Bark, and daily exerci&s;e, it was prevented from collecting again, and I heard no more of her complaint.</P>

I HAD forgot to mention, that her Pa|rents were very poor, and in addition to the poverty of her Diet, &s;he had been much ex|po&s;ed in all Weather, during the time of her having the Intermittent. It has been ob|&s;erved by &s;ome eminent Phy&s;icians, that the Diuretic effects of Squills are not &s;en&s;ible, unle&s;s there is &s;ome operation in the Stomach from them.

<P>THIS perhaps may be founded; but I under&s;tand it no otherwi&s;e than that &s;ome operation on the Stomach is a te&s;t, and a ne|ce&s;&s;ary te&s;t, of the Squills being in an active &s;tate, in the &s;ame manner, as we are only certain of the activity of Mercurial Pre|parations when they have &s;hewn &s;ome effect on the Mouth. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance I at|tended particularly to their operation on the Stomach, but it was &s;o &s;light, as not to give any unea&s;ine&s;s. There was a little Nau&s;ea

<P>IN the inve&s;tigation of Endemic Di&s;ea&s;es, of their Cau&s;e, Progre&s;s, and Termination, it would appear, that an enquiry into the &s;tate of the Atmo&s;phere at various Periods; the Situation of Places; the &s;urrounding Produc|tions of the Earth; the Rivers, Mar&s;hes, Lakes, and even Infects, ought to be added to the account. If the Limits of the Publication, for which the&s;e Pages are intended, would permit &s;uch an Enquiry, we might ea&s;ily de|&s;cribe every thing but the Climate, which has been always &s;o irregular, both with re&s;pect to Hot and Cold, Wet and Dry Sea&s;ons, that were we to recount the Changes which have come immediately under our Ob&s;ervation,

the Reader would &s;uppo&s;e we were &s;peaking of &s;everal Countries &s;ituated under different parallels of Latitude. As we cannot enter fully into the &s;ubject, we &s;hall only occa|&s;ionally mention the Sea&s;ons and Changes of Weather, when they &s;eem to relate to the &s;ubject we are treating of. If we were to attempt to account for the Di&s;ea&s;es, and their Varieties, from the Weather we might per|haps mi&s;lead the Reader, as well as deceive our&s;elves;&mdash;for the Science of Medicine is &s;o young in this Country, that we have not the light of former Practitioners to guide us through the dark Labyrinth; too dark indeed, even where the &s;tronge&s;t rays of Human Wi&s;dom are thrown upon it. The Country we &s;peak of is low Land, mo&s;tly within twelve feet of the level of the Sea, inter&s;ected in all directions with Salt-Creeks and Rivers, the Heads of which form Swamps and Mar&s;hes, and Fenny Grounds covered with Water in wet Sea&s;ons. Wherever it is not cultivated, the Land is covered with large

Timber and thick Underwood. The vici|nity of the Sea, and the Salt-Creeks and Ri|vers, occa&s;ion a con&s;tant moi&s;ture and warmth of the Atmo&s;phere, in&s;omuch, that although under the &s;ame Latitude a hundred miles up the Country, deep Snows and frozen Rivers are very common during the Winter, yet here we con&s;ider &s;uch occurrences as Pheno|mena; for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, the Spring is very early u&s;hered in, &s;ometimes &s;o early, that many Trees are in Bloom about the latter end of February; from this time, however, till the end of April we are &s;ubject to cold Rains, piercing Winds, and &s;harp Fro&s;ts; it is at this Period only (if we except the Influenza) that any Inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es ever appear among us; and the&s;e are confined to People who live expo&s;ed to bleak Winds on the Banks of large Rivers, on the Che&s;apeake, or on the Sea, or who&s;e Occupations expo&s;e them to &s;imilar Inconveniences of Situation. We may compri&s;e the whole of the Inflam|matory Di&s;ea&s;es known here under the Terms Pleuri&s;y and Peripneumony;&mdash;when the&s;e

But when Per&s;ons who have long been Re&s;idents in this part of the Country are the &s;ubjects of Pleuri&s;y or Pe|ripneumony, we have always found the Lancet a very dangerous Remedy, and never u&s;e it but with extreme caution;&mdash;after the Emetics or Cathartics, we find it much &s;afer to alleviate the painful Symptoms by the u&s;e of Opium, joined to powerful Diaphoretics, &s;uch as Vin. Antimon. Tart. Emetic, Spt. Minder. Camphor, &amp;c. with Expectorants, occa&s;ionally Bli&s;ters, partial application of Warm-baths, and if an irritated Stomach (a circum&s;tance we have frequently to contend with in many Di&s;ea&s;es) refu&s;es the Opium with Antimonial Preparations or Camphor, we never &s;cruple to u&s;e it alone; and however

extraordinary it may appear to &s;ome Practi|tioners, we never had any cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect it of doing an injury to full and &s;trong habits; though we confe&s;s, with tho&s;e of the latter de&s;cription, it does not &s;eem to produce the de&s;ired effect &s;o uniformly as we could wi&s;h. The&s;e Fevers, like almo&s;t all others in this Climate, uniformly put on the appearance of an Intermittent after the fifth day, or as &s;oon as the Expectoration is complete; in many therefore the Bark becomes nece&s;&s;ary at the clo&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e. Inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es are &s;eldom fatal if thus managed, and &s;carce ever terminate in Phthi&s;is Pulmonalis; this latter indeed &s;eldom originates here.</P>
<Q><P>WE have a Root for which we do not remember any Botanical name, di&s;tingui&s;hed under the title of Pleuri&s;y Root; this many of our Country Practitioners a&s;&s;ert&mdash;to be of great efficacy in Inflammatory Di&s;ea&s;es; and we think it de&s;erves &s;ome attention, and frequently u&s;e it joined to Seneka in decoction.
<PB N="305" REF="024239_0311_0FC56BC77945CDE0">
Seneka, either with or without the other, produces a gentle Diarrhoea, which manife&s;t|ly relieves the Patient without checking the Expectoration.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of May, the Wea|ther becomes &s;ultry, with &s;ome cool days, occa&s;ioned by the change of Winds to the North and North-Ea&s;t: At this period all the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Winter begin to decline, and the whole Country is univer&s;ally healthy (except here and there a trifling Vernal In|termittent which &s;carce requires the appli|cation of Medicine) till the middle or latter end of June, when Diarrhoeas and Dy&s;ente|ries appear among the Children, mo&s;tly with tho&s;e under two years old, though not ab&s;olutely confined to &s;uch.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome years the Diarrhoea is almo&s;t univer&s;al, attended for the mo&s;t part with an irritation of the Stomach, and an irregular Fever of the Intermittent kind: After the proper Evacuations, we apply Bark in large

quantities, joined to the mo&s;t approved a|&s;tringents and Anodynes; Gum Kino, Opi|um, Spec. e Scord. &amp;c. and when the Sto|mach will not bear a &s;ufficient quantity of Bark, we throw it up in Gly&s;ters repeatedly, for many days together, and this we have learnt, by experience, to be the only mode which can be depended on.</P>
<P>THE Diarrhoea of many of the&s;e Chil|dren re&s;i&s;t every medical effort to cure them; and the&s;e Children gradually decline in Fle&s;h, and contract a Chronic Apthae, which vi&s;ibly extends throughout the whole Alimentary Canal.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een the Di&s;ea&s;e in this State in almo&s;t every large town we are acquainted with;&mdash;nor do we know of any certain Cure; many have recom|mended the u&s;e of Alum, Spec. e. Scord. with the Gum Kino, and have a&s;&s;erted, that great relief has been found therefrom: Others have ventured the u&s;e of a Solution of Vitriol.

Caerul. but we have never attempted this. It would appear that a Change of Air to a more Northern and cold Climate, or to Places where the u&s;e of Chalybeate Waters can be had, would be advi&s;eable; many have reco|vered by &s;uch means, but we have al&s;o &s;een many recover, who were reduced perfectly to Skeletons, without removing at all, or mak|ing u&s;e of Medicines of any kind.</P>
<P>DYSENTERIES in Children are not &s;o difficult to cure; the common means, &s;uch as lpecacuan. Vitr. Cerat. Antimon. Ol. Ricin. Rhubarb. Simaroub. &amp;c. &s;eldom fail to re|move the Di&s;ea&s;e if judiciou&s;ly admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>AT &s;ome Periods we have a Dy&s;entery among the Adults, which may be called Epidemic; but as this differs in no degree from tho&s;e which are common to warm Cli|mates, it is entirely unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more about it, except that in the cure it does not require tho&s;e large Evacuations previous

to admini&s;tering A&s;tringents and Anodynes, which we have &s;een u&s;ed by &s;ome Practi|tioners in other Countries, and it will never admit of the Lancet.</P>
<P>IN July, the Heat of the Weather in|crea&s;es; but during the whole of this Month and the greate&s;t part of Augu&s;t, there are no Di&s;ea&s;es at all, at lea&s;t none which can be called Epidemic. On the approach of the Autumnal Months, Intermittents begin to appear throughout the Country.</P>
<P>IT is not our Province here to recapitulate the &s;everal Opinions concerning the Cau&s;e and Nature of tho&s;e Fevers, nor yet to divide them into numberle&s;s Species and Genera. We have never been able to di&s;tingui&s;h any other difference in the Nature of Intermit|tents, than that which Con&s;titution, Cli|mate, and Manner of Living give ri&s;e to; tho&s;e Cau&s;es will divide them into Perfect, Imperfect, or Remittent: The &s;everal Ter|minations
<PB N="309" REF="024239_0315_0FC56BD60404D6D0">
of them which we frequently ob|&s;erve into Continued, Putrid, or Nervous Fevers, will be found to ari&s;e from the &s;ame Cau&s;es, and under tho&s;e &s;imple terms we &s;hall proceed to treat of Intermittents in all their Stages.</P>
<P>THOSE which occur earlie&s;t in the Sea|&s;on are uniformly of the milde&s;t kind, and yield &s;oone&s;t to the proper Medicines. A|mong the Labouring and Temperate Cla&s;s of our Citizens, who&s;e Diet is &s;imple, who&s;e Hours are regular, and who&s;e u&s;e of Spiritu|ous Liquors is &s;paring, tho&s;e Fevers are per|fect Intermittents, generally of the Tertian kind, and though not confined particularly to any age or &s;ex, yet are mo&s;t frequent among the younger cla&s;s, the Females and the Chil|dren; they are in wet Sea&s;ons almo&s;t general among tho&s;e of the latter de&s;cription in coun|try places, and in low fenny ground. They yield immediately to proper Evacuations, and the u&s;e of the Peruvian Bark, and &s;eldom
<PB N="310" REF="024239_0316_0FC56BDB963C90E0">
outla&s;t the Autumnal Months, even without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any Art: Sometimes, how|ever, in relaxed Habits, they terminate in Jaundice, enlarged Spleen, Ana&s;arca, and Death. We &s;hall not be particular upon this &s;ort of Intermittents, becau&s;e they are in no|thing different from tho&s;e which prevail in all countries &s;imilarly &s;ituated.</P>
<P>AMONG that Cla&s;s of Citizens, who&s;e hours are more irregular, and who&s;e u&s;e of Wine and luxurious Food is more frequent, tho&s;e Fevers, though &s;till retaining the Inter|mittent, Quotidian, and Tertian Form, are neverthele&s;s imperfectly &s;o; a great degree of Heat, quickne&s;s of Pul&s;e, and Debility remain during the whole time, which may be called Intermi&s;&s;ion, with partial or total Lo&s;s of Appetite. Here Intermittents begin to put on an appearance, which we think very dif|ferent from tho&s;e of any other Country; they are preceded by a Chilline&s;s, which com|monly &s;eizes the Patient when he thinks
<PB N="311" REF="024239_0317_0FC56BDF9326E888">
him&s;elf in perfect Health. Head-ach, great Thir&s;t and Heat &s;oon follow, in many in|&s;tances Delirium, Vomiting, Diarrhoea, and large Di&s;charges of Bile;&mdash;about the fifth, &s;eventh, or twelfth hour the Patient is reliev|ed by pro&s;u&s;e Sweat, which continues with the aforementioned Heat, Quickne&s;s of Pul&s;e, and Debility, till the next Paroxy&s;m. The&s;e are generally of the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tian kind, and return regularly if no Medicine is u&s;ed, from nine to fourteen days, when they will commonly terminate altogether, or degenerate into a &s;light Quotidian, which allows the Patient to walk about, and when the cold Weather ap|proaches for the mo&s;t part leave him alto|gether.</P>
<P>PEOPLE of the latter de&s;cription are more rarely the &s;ubjects of Intermittent Fe|vers than tho&s;e who live in a plain manner; and if proper Evacuations are made, and the Bark admini&s;tered with per&s;everance, and at|tention to the Stomach and fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages, the
<PB N="312" REF="024239_0318_0FC56BE3652B2AD0">
Di&s;ea&s;e may almo&s;t certainly be cured after the third Paroxi&s;m, and very often even a &s;e|cond is prevented.</P>
<P>WE have always experienced Cathartics to be the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t effectual Evacuations in tho&s;e kinds of Fevers; and if the Patient has an irritated Stomach with Co&s;tivene&s;s, Emetics are not only inadequate and unne|ce&s;&s;ary but dangerous. We frequently find great difficulty in making the Stomach bear a &s;ufficient quantity of Cathartic Medicines to procure the de&s;ired Evacuations: when this is the ca&s;e, Laudanum and Aqua Menthae, or Extract. Thebaic, are admini&s;tered an hour or two before the Purge, which generally cau&s;es the latter to remain, and though the Opiate retards the operation, it does not ulti|mately prevent it, or render it le&s;s powerful. After this we proceed to the u&s;e of the Bark during the Intermi&s;&s;ions, and without regard to mea&s;ure, give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t as profu&s;ely as the Sto|mach will permit, and in the mo&s;t powerful
<PB N="313" REF="024239_0319_0FC56BE4CD74E2A0">
form, beginning with the Powder, and oc|ca&s;ionally u&s;ing the Decoction, the Extract, and cold Infu&s;ion. It too often happens, that the Stomach will not bear the Medicine at all, in which ca&s;e we give large quantities of the Decoction or Infu&s;ion by Cly&s;ters; and we can venture to a&s;&s;ert, when tho&s;e Cly&s;ters are retained in &s;ufficient Quantity, the effect is equal to that produced by any other mode of admini&s;tering it. During the Paroxy&s;m, we find great Relief procured, by making the Patient drink plentifully of a &s;trong Infu|&s;ion of Serpent. Virgin, to which, when the Symptoms are very painful, we add Lauda|num in &s;ufficient quantity to procure the Pa|tient perfect ea&s;e. The&s;e la&s;t Medicines, particularly the Serpent, have a vi&s;ible power of &s;hortening the Paroxy&s;m, and will rarely di&s;agree with the Stomach. The u&s;e of Opium, its &s;afety and advantage in tho&s;e ca&s;es, we pre&s;ume to be well known; there|fore we &s;hall decline making any Ob&s;ervations upon it, except that we have not found it (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s been a&s;&s;erted) capable <HI>per &s;e,</HI> of curing
<PB N="314" REF="024239_0320_0FC56BE87923FDA0">
Intermittents. It has been advi&s;ed to give it in conjunction with the &s;everal Preparations of Bark, where the irritable &s;tate of the Sto|mach will not bear the Cort. alone. This ex|pedient will &s;ucceed, if the quantity from time to time be increa&s;ed, and is often u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, though it invariably occa&s;ions great di&s;tre&s;s to the Patient when the Fever leaves him, by inducing an Hy&s;terical or Hy|pochondriacal &s;en&s;ation, which if it does not amount to pain, the Patient will tell you his feelings are far wor&s;e than if it did.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e of this Medicine to prevent the pa&s;&s;age of the Bark by &s;tool is known to every one; but we think the Gum. Kino for ge|neral u&s;e much better, and more permanent in its effects.</P>
<P>AT the acce&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Fevers there is frequently a full hard Pul&s;e, inflamed Eyes, a &s;en&s;e of fullne&s;s in the Brea&s;t, and &s;ome|times a &s;harp Pain in the Side, re&s;embling
<PB N="315" REF="024239_0321_0FC56BF09986A330">
that which attends inflammatory Fevers. The&s;e circum&s;tances have often led Practition|ers, and others who are unacquainted with the Climate, to bleed the Patient; an ex|pedient, which if it does not produce a ten|dency to Putrefaction, invariably fixes the Fever &s;o firmly, that the Cure becomes after|wards exceedingly difficult.</P>
<P>WHEN no Medicines are given at all, we have ob&s;erved before, that the Fever for the mo&s;t part will decline of it&s;elf on the ninth or fourteenth day, or degenerate into a &s;light Quotidian, and &s;ometimes a Quartan; this is, however, not always the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IF no Medicine has been given, or if the Di&s;ea&s;e has been improperly treated by Bleeding, or by too great Evacuations, other|wi&s;e by forbidding the u&s;e of Wine, &amp;c. the Fever &s;ometimes becomes Remittent.</P>
<P>IN the town we have al&s;o many of the&s;e
<PB N="316" REF="024239_0322_0FC56BF238FB3820">
Fevers, which though clearly belonging to the Cla&s;s of Intermittents, are Aborigine Remittents; becau&s;e, there is an evident ten|dency to decline of the Fever at a particular time, once in twenty-four hours, every other day, or every fourth day, and all the Diagno|&s;tic Symptoms are preci&s;ely the &s;ame as they are in a di&s;tinct Intermittent, making allow|ance for Age, Sex, and Con&s;titution; nor do the means of Cure differ, though variou&s;ly ap|plied.</P>

IN the Autumn of Eighty-nine, the Influenza made its appearance here, as it did throughout the Continent a little before and after that time, We &s;hould not have taken notice of this Di&s;ea&s;e, which has been at times common to various parts of the World, if we had not ob&s;erved &s;omething &s;ingular in its progre&s;s through this Part of the Country.</P>
<P>DURING the whole month of Augu&s;t in that year, the Weather was remarkably cool and plea&s;ant, with the Wind from the North-We&s;t to the North-Ea&s;t, and continued &s;o with &s;ome little intervals of South Winds and moderate Heat till the la&s;t of September, when the Influenza began to appear, and from the time the&s;e Winds &s;prung up we had no Intermittents as in former and &s;ucceeding years.</P>
<P>THE Influenza though univer&s;al, &s;carce one in a thou&s;and e&s;caping it, was mild, and attended with a &s;light Fever, only &s;ome few in&s;tances excepted where Pleuri&s;y and Perip|neumony

took place: two or three only of tho&s;e Died, more, we believe, from improper management than from the Malignity of the Di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, mo&s;t of tho&s;e to whom it had proved fatal being profu&s;ely bled and evacu|ated. We only recollect one in&s;tance of any per&s;on, who, in con&s;equence of this Di&s;ea&s;e, afterwards died with Phthi&s;is Pulmonalis&punc; a circum&s;tance which has frequently happened in other parts of Virginia and to the North. Notwith&s;tanding this Epidemic was vi&s;ibly of an inflammatory kind, it would not, with us, admit of what is called the antiphlogi&s;tic plan; and we are authorized to &s;ay this, be|cau&s;e in pur&s;uing a middle way, that is, by moderate evacuations and Diaphoretics with|out bleeding, and afterwards a free u&s;e of the Bark, we have lo&s;t none of tho&s;e Patients whom we had the management of from the beginning. An inflammatory Di&s;order &s;imi|lar to this, and by &s;ome called by the &s;ame name, again appeared, beginning in the Win|ter 1790. This was generally attended with Symptoms of Inflammation con&s;iderably wor&s;e than what we have been accu&s;tomed

to call the original Influenza, neverthele&s;s, we could not find upon trial that any ad|vantage was derived from the Lancet. This complaint was much more fatal than the for|mer, and often re&s;i&s;ted every application for relief. In the latter end of the Winter 1784, we had a &s;pecies of Malignant Angina which was Epidemic and contagious; and although we have never experienced any thing &s;imilar to it &s;ince, or any tradition of its having hap|pened in this Country, yet we think we have both &s;een and read of the &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e el&s;e|where. If the manner in which we have in &s;everal places recommended the u&s;e of the Bark &s;hould appear extraordinary, we have only to beg the Reader to rely upon our words for the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch Practice, which we a&s;&s;ure him a very long cour&s;e of Experi|ence taught us not only to be beneficial, but ab&s;olutely free from danger in our Climate at lea&s;t. We have had rea&s;on to think (tho' we will not venture to give it as a po&s;itive fact), that the Peruvian Bark is con&s;iderably lo&s;t active in the Cure of Intermittents, in Con&s;titutions which have been long accu&s;|tomed

to the free u&s;e of Wine, ardent Spi|rits, and luxurious food; even where &s;uch Con&s;titutions have not been vi&s;ibly Impaired, or Debilitated by &s;uch habits. If this be true, Wine and ardent Spirits, as has been ob&s;erved by many Practitioners, po&s;&s;e&s;s a con&s;iderable &s;hare of the Specific virtues of Bark. This la&s;t, we have pretty well a&s;certained, will not prevent what it will Cure; that is, the con|&s;tant u&s;e of it will not pre&s;erve a Per&s;on from the attack of an Intermittent, though it will afterwards remove it, but mu&s;t be taken in much larger Quantities than would have been nece&s;&s;ary if the Habit had not been before accu&s;tomed to it; and if Wine and ardent Spirits po&s;&s;e&s;s any of its Specific Virtues, the habitual application of tho&s;e to the Con&s;titu|tion may le&s;&s;en the power of the Bark, in the &s;ame manner as if it&s;elf had been con&s;tantly taken. We offer this as a mere matter of opi|nion, which cannot be thought extraordina|ry, if we may rea&s;on from Analogy and com|pare the action of Opium, and many other Medicines, which gradually lo&s;e their pow|er by repeated application.</P></Q>

<HEAD>A SKETCH of the SITUATION, CLIMATE, and DISEASES of NORTH-CAROLINA.</HEAD>
<Q><P>THIS State, (bounded North by Vir|ginia, Ea&s;t by the Atlantic Ocean; South by South-Carolina and Georgia; and We&s;t by the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi,) is &s;ituated between the 34&deg; and 36&deg; 30&prime; North Latitude. It is 758 Miles in length, and about 110 in breadth</P>
<P>IT is plentifully &s;upplied with Rivers, Bays, Inlets, Mora&s;&s;es and Swamps; it is but thinly &s;ettled, and indifferently cultivated in proportion to its extent. There is one Swamp in this State, called the Di&s;mal Swamp, which extends over a large tract of Country, between Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds; and another North of Edentown,
<PB N="327" REF="024239_0333_0FC56C1639FF36B8">
which lies partly in this State and partly in Virginia. This la&s;t tract of Swamp or Mar&s;h Ground contains upwards of 140,000 Acres.</P>
<P>NEWBERN, the large&s;t Town in this State, contains only about 400 hou&s;es, all built of Wood; and &s;tands on a flat Sandy point of Land formed by the Confluence of the Rivers Neus and Trent.</P>
<P>NORTH-CAROLINA, in its whole breadth for the extent of 60 Miles from the Sea, is a dead level. A great proportion of this tract is a barren Fore&s;t. On the Banks of &s;ome of the Rivers, the land is fertile and good. In|ter&s;per&s;ed through the other parts, are glades of rich Swamp, and ridges of Oakland of a black fertile Soil. The Sea Coa&s;t, the Sounds, Inlets, and lower parts of the Rivers, have uniformly a muddy &s;oft bottom.</P>
<P>About 80 or 90 Miles to the We&s;tward of the Atlantic, this State begins to &s;well in|to
<PB N="328" REF="024239_0334_0FC56C18A980B9B0">
Hills which increa&s;e in &s;ize, and are more mixed with &s;tones, al&s;o of increa&s;ed magni|tude the farther we proceed in that direction. The Soil in the&s;e parts is of reddi&s;h Clay and Loam, &s;trong and fertile; the Woods le&s;s in|termingled with Pines and more with Oak and Hickory; and the Water is every where excellent, running in a profu&s;ion of clear and refre&s;hing &s;treams.</P>
<P>THE Country and Climate to the We&s;t|ward is in general healthy, the low Grounds along the Rivers alone being otherwi&s;e, par|ticularly tho&s;e of the Roanoak, occa&s;ioned by exhalations ari&s;ing from the damp Soil, &s;tag|nated Waters, and by the putre&s;cent particles with which the Atmo&s;phere is replete, who&s;e free circulation and purification is prevented in &s;uch &s;ituations, by lofty thick Woods, impervious to the Suns rays, under which a di&s;mal Gloom for ever dwells.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch &s;ituations we find Intermittents and Remittents, the principal Endemial Di&s;|ea&s;es

of this State, in&s;omuch that even in the Winter Sea&s;on we find that mo&s;t of the Com|plaints which begin with Inflammatory Symptoms, are changed in the cour&s;e of a few days into one or other of the&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Winters of this State, are more plea&s;ant and agreeable than can well be con|ceived; they are neither &s;o Hot as to incom|mode, nor &s;o Cold as to be di&s;agreeable. And for the mo&s;t part, the Weather is Clear, Bright, and Serene; and the Ground (where fertile) is covered with delightful verdure. For here all the Inclemency of the Weather is in the Summer. At this Sea&s;on, the in|ten&s;e Heat and the &s;corching rays of the Sun are almo&s;t intolerable; and multitudes of trouble&s;ome Flies, Mu&s;kittoes, and other In|&s;ects and Reptiles, continually infe&s;t and prey upon every Living Creature in the Fields and Woods, &s;ucking their Blood, and giving con|tinual torment both Day and Night; &s;o that every kind of Bea&s;t becomes mi&s;erably Lean and Weak, while this Sea&s;on la&s;ts. Even to

Man, with all his re&s;ources and advantages, the Heat then becomes intolerable, nor can he find any &s;helter or defence again&s;t the a&s;|&s;aults of the&s;e tormenting In&s;ects, and vene|mous Reptiles, which infe&s;t the Air and Earth.</P>
<P>BOTH Rice and Indigo are cultivated on the low wet Grounds; the&s;e increa&s;e the unwhole&s;omene&s;s of the Air, becau&s;e the Quantity of Water which they require for their &s;upport becomes &s;tagnant in many pla|ces. The Indigo requires a great deal of Water in its Manufacture, and &s;oon becomes putrid in this &s;ultry Climate; in this condi|tion it becomes extremely offen&s;ive and in|&s;alubrious; the rotten Indigo plant is often hawled out, and &s;pread over the Fields to manure the Grounds, and becomes abomi|nably noi&s;ome, rendering the Atmo&s;phere for &s;ome di&s;tance ab&s;olutely deleterious, and frequently almo&s;t pe&s;tilential.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="024239_0337_0FC56C2187435060">
DURING the latter part of Summer and the beginning of Autumn, putrid and noxious effluvia ri&s;e in very gro&s;s and thick vapours from the valleys, from &s;tagnant and &s;hallow pools, or fens, e&s;pecially after heavy &s;howers, and the la&s;ting and exce&s;&s;ive heats which &s;ucceeds &s;uch rains.</P>
<P>THE dews are likewi&s;e near the &s;ea-coa&s;t very copious in the beginning of Autumn, in a &s;till evening and in the night, and the whole country is covered with a thick fog till after &s;even o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P>ALONG the Sea coa&s;t, the Ea&s;t Winds are the coole&s;t in Summer, and the warme&s;t in Winter." (Winds have a demon&s;trable influence on the temperature of the Atmo&s;|phere; and &s;ince the&s;e mu&s;t, like all the other phenomena of nature, be governed by fixed and determinate laws, they de&s;erve inve&s;ti|gation.) Unu&s;ual cold happens either in the Summer or in the Winter &s;ea&s;on; the cir|cum&s;tances

which render Summers le&s;s warm than u&s;ual are pretty obvious; for the diminution of heat may ari&s;e either from a long continuance of Ea&s;terly or Northerly Winds, or from frequent and heavy Rains, which are followed by great evaporation; or from a long continuance of cloudy weather which intercepts the Sun's rays, and prevents the Earth from ab&s;orbing them.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es of unu&s;ual cold in Winter, in this Climate, are of more difficult inve&s;tiga|tion. Tho&s;e be&s;t a&s;certained, are, 1&s;t.

<HEAD>DISEASES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Climate of this State &s;o nearly re|&s;embles that of South-Carolina, that I &s;hall omit giving any farther de&s;cription of it here, and &s;hall only enumerate &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;es as are mo&s;t prevalent. Dr. Smith informs me, that, <Q>Ea&s;t of the Mountains, a &s;purious kind of Pleuri&s;y, accompanied with profu&s;e expectoration of a thin gleety Mucus, is the mo&s;t prevalent complaint in the Winter and Spring &s;ea&s;ons; the Pul&s;e, in this Di&s;ea&s;e, is more frequent, but never &s;o hard, full, or &s;trong as in the true Pleuri&s;y; the inflamma|tory &s;ymptoms are ob&s;erved to &s;ub&s;ide much earlier, and are very apt to be &s;ucceeded by &s;ymptoms re&s;embling tho&s;e of the Typhus, or rather of the Remitting Fever.</Q></P>
<P>"MODERATE bleeding, at the commence|ment of the Fever, is generally of &s;ervice, but a repetition is &s;eldom found &s;alutary;
<PB N="334" REF="024239_0340_0FC56C2843E79A70">
and copious bleeding has invariably occa&s;i|oned &s;uch a &s;tate of debility in a number of ca&s;es in which I have employed it, mi&s;led by &s;ervilely copying the practice of Syden|ham, and the Lectures of a celebrated fo|reign Profe&s;&s;or, that I am now always mo|derate in the quantity I direct to be taken away." But mild Emetics, and e&s;pecially nau&s;eating do&s;es of Antimonials with mode|rate purging, and the early application of Bli&s;ters to the Thorax, or back, are the re|medies which I have found mo&s;t generally beneficial.</P>
<Q><P>I HAVE al&s;o given Opium, combined with a little Tartar Emetic, or Antimonial Wine, with great apparent good effect at bed|time, as &s;oon as the Phlogi&s;tic Diathe&s;is had con&s;iderably abated.</P>
<P>THESE kind of Pleuri&s;ies are commonly brought on by intemperance and imprudent expo&s;ure to the Weather, which is very fluc|tuating

Our principal remedies for the&s;e are Bark, Snake|root, and ardent Spirits diluted with water; and notwith&s;tanding the many Satires which have of late been written again&s;t Rum, I

but from the be&s;t accounts which have been recorded, I am convinced that multi|tudes of tho&s;e who are thought to die of Worm Fevers, die of the Hydrocephalus. I am &s;o fully per&s;uaded of this, that I make it a rule always to compare the Diagno&s;tic Symptoms of the one with tho&s;e of the other before I attempt to pre&s;cribe; but as there are &s;ome Symptoms common to both, I am often at a lo&s;s&mdash;When the Patient has a dilatation of the pupil and convul&s;ive mo|tion of the Eye-lids, and &s;quinting without an affection of the limbs, or frothing at the mouth, there can be little doubt that the Di&s;|ea&s;e depends upon effu&s;ion or collection of Water within the Ventricles of the Brain; and more e&s;pecially when the Patient often puts his hand to the head and &s;hrieks out, or complains of pain there. But as the Pa|tient grinds his teeth, &s;hrieks out, and has a very irregular Fever in con&s;equence of the irritation occa&s;ioned by Worms, e&s;pecially when previou&s;ly reduced by debilitating cau&s;es, I think it is a very difficult point to di&s;tingui&s;h one Di&s;ea&s;e from the other.</P>

<P>AS I have been unlucky in my pre&s;crip|tions and treatment of the Hydrocephalus, I will not trouble you with a detail of particu|lars; but whenever I have been able to a&s;certain the pre&s;ence of Worms, I have &s;eldom failed removing them, by exhibiting a draught of a &s;trong infu&s;ion of the Anthelmia, or Caryo|phyllum Indicum, night and morning for three or four days, and afterwards a do&s;e of Mercurius Dulcis and Rubarb, proportion|ate to the Patients age. If any &s;igns of Worms &s;till remain, the &s;ame remedy ought to be re|peated

after an interval of three or four days. The &s;ucce&s;s of this method is almo&s;t incredi|ble&mdash;I have never yet &s;een an in&s;tance where it was not effectual, whether the Patient had a Fever or not, when the principal Symp|toms were manife&s;tly occa&s;ioned by Worms. I generally direct One Drachm of the Roots, Stalks and Leaves to be infu&s;ed four hours in half a pint of Boiling Water, and as much of it to be given with the addition of a little Milk and Sugar, as the Patient has been ac|cu&s;tomed to take of Tea or Coffee for Break|fa&s;t and Supper. The day the Mercurial purge is taken, the Patient is Prohibited cold drinks and &s;olid Food. To confirm the cure, Huxham's Tincture is directed to be taken before Dinner, and a little Wine and Water made u&s;e of for common drink.</P>
<P>I HAVE tried Bli&s;ters frequently to the Occiput, Neck, and behind the Ears, in &s;everal ca&s;es of Hydrocephalus, and in every &s;tage, and have rai&s;ed a moderate Ptyali&s;m, by the application of Mercurial Ointment to the

This opinion I ground on the &s;ucce&s;s of others, as well as on the Pathology.</P></Q>

<HEAD>A SKETCH of the SITUATION, CLIMATE, and DISEASES of SOUTH-CAROLINA.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="excerpt">
<HEAD>[Extract of a Letter from the Honorable DAVID RAM|SAY, E&s;q. dated Charle&s;ton, March 17, 1791.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>I HAVE not lei&s;ure &s;ufficient to do ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject you reque&s;t, but this will be no di&s;appointment as more has been written towards elucidating the Medical Hi&s;tory of South-Ca|rolina, than of almo&s;t any other State. I refer particularly to Dr. Lining's and Dr. Chalmer's Publications. I think the latter has exaggerated the heat of our Climate, and given a Gloomy repre&s;entation of its Di&s;ea&s;es, but that his Writings afford and Materials for your Work.</HI>]</Q>
<P>THIS State is in length about 200 miles, and in breadth 125, &s;ituate between 32 and 35 degrees of North Latitude.</P>
<Q><P>BOUNDED Ea&s;t by the Atlantic Ocean, North, by North-Carolina, Southwe&s;t and
<PB N="343" REF="024239_0349_0FC56C4055C5DE28">
South, by Savannah River, which divides it from Georgia.</P>
<P>THE coa&s;t of this Country is &s;o low and flat, that it cannot be &s;een at the di&s;tance of more than Seven Leagues, but about 60 miles from the Shore, the land becomes more unequal, and con&s;i&s;ts of Spacious levels, inter|ter&s;per&s;ed with ea&s;y ri&s;ings, which gradually, advancing in height towards the We&s;t, ter|minate in a range of Lofty Mountains, that form, as it were, a chain which runs through|out the Continent of North-America, at the di&s;tance of about 300 Miles from the Sea-Coa&s;t.</P></Q>
<P>FROM the Ea&s;t &s;ides of the&s;e Mountains, many Rivers ari&s;e; and as all the Waters of the adjacent Lands fall into them, the&s;e Ri|vers are liable to exce&s;&s;ive inundations; &s;wel|ling &s;ometimes more than 20 feet in height in the &s;pace of 12 hours, particularly in tho&s;e places where the Channels are narrow, and the Banks &s;ufficiently high to confine the
<PB N="344" REF="024239_0350_0FC56C44E8160DF0">
Waters. But where the Land is lower, the Waters overflow and &s;pread them&s;elves ma|ny miles beyond their ordinary limits; and thus the low lands often continue deluged for many weeks.</P>
<P>THESE land-floods are owing either to the melting of Snow on the Mountains, or the falling of heavy Rains in the interior parts of the Country, and they &s;ometimes happen both in the Spring and Autumn, but mo&s;t frequently in the latter Sea&s;on. Some years, however, (though the&s;e are rare) the Rivers do not &s;well at all, or in &s;o &s;mall a degree as not to occa&s;ion any damage.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;uch inundations happen in the Spring, the Planters can not &s;ow their grain; and in Autumn the produce of their lands is either &s;wept away by the Stream, or &s;o rotted, that little or nothing can be reaped for that year: However &s;o prolific are tho&s;e lands, that if one Crop is lo&s;t out of three, the Plan|ters are &s;ufficiently recompen&s;ed.</P>
<Q><PB N="345" REF="024239_0351_0FC56C4637A7D168">
<P>A GREAT part of the Rice Plantations are ocea&s;ionally overflowed by art, for the purpo&s;e of promoting the growth of the Rice, which is properly a Water-plant, at lea&s;t when of a proper age it thrives be&s;t in Water. This has a &s;alutary effect, as it pre|vents the generation of putrid exhalations, the effect of &s;tagnant, confined, and motion|le&s;s waters when operated on by heat. In order to prepare &s;uch Lands, Dams, Banks and Drains are nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>THREE days before, and as many after every change and full of the Moon, the Sea flowing in with a &s;tronger Current, and ri|&s;ing &s;ome feet higher in the Rivers, &s;o far as the tide flows, checks the cour&s;e of the Wa|ter in them, and cau&s;es them to &s;well and overflow the Low Lands above.</P>
<P>ALONG the Banks of every River lies much Low Land, which is mo&s;tly covered at High-Water &s;o far as the Tide flows. As far as the Sea Water flows the&s;e Banks are
<PB N="346" REF="024239_0352_0FC56C4873358EE0">
covered with an high and &s;trong &s;edgy &s;ort of Gra&s;s, like Wild Oats&mdash;and at a greater di&s;|tance from the Sea, where the Waters are al|ways Fre&s;h, &s;uch Swampy Grounds abound with Coar&s;e Gra&s;s, Reeds, and a va&s;t variety of other productions, from the lofty Cypre&s;s to the humble&s;t and mo&s;t diminutive Plant. Be&s;ides the&s;e wet Lands, there are &s;everal Fre&s;h Water Lakes in the interior parts of the Country, and great quantities of low le|vel Ground, which after Heavy Rains, conti|nue long overflowed for want of declivities by which the Waters might run off. When the&s;e Stagnant Waters are nearly or quite ex|pended, noxious exhalations will abound; for then the Sun's Rays penetrating the Mi|ry Soil, the corrupt, putrid and mephitic Matter which had lien quie&s;cent is thereby &s;et at liberty, and mixes with the Air we breathe. The Soil of this State is very va|rious, being generally light and &s;andy with|in 20 miles of the Sea. This refers only to the more elevated parts, for in many other places the Mould is rich and deep.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="024239_0353_0FC56C4A075EAC48">
THE quantity of Water which con&s;tantly Stagnates in various parts, occa&s;ions innu|merable multitudes of Reptiles and In&s;ects that are intollerably trouble&s;ome to the In|habitants, more e&s;pecially at night, unle&s;s they are guarded again&s;t by Gauze Curtains, or &s;ome other contrivance.</P>
<P>EXCEPT in one River, a &s;tone larger than a pebble is not to be found any where within 20 miles of the Sea, exclu&s;ive of what has been brought in as Balla&s;t for Ships.</P>
<P>WHEN the Engli&s;h fir&s;t took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Country, excepting Savannahs, (which are Plains naturally without Trees) and &s;ome &s;mall openings made by the Savages, the whole was one continued Fore&s;t; and per|haps one 20th part of it is not yet cleared and cultivated. (Since the above account was publi&s;hed by Dr. Chalmers, which was about the year 1772, a much greater portion of this State has been cleared, and a con&s;ider|able
<PB N="348" REF="024239_0354_0FC56C4F1CA5FFE8">
part of it is now (in 1791) in the high|e&s;t cultivation.)</P>
<P>FROM the &s;urfaces, therefore, of &s;o many large Rivers, and numerous collections of &s;tanding Waters, &s;uch quantities of &s;unk, fenny, and mar&s;hy Lands, and the va&s;t At|lantic Ocean that borders on our Coa&s;t, it may readily be inferred, that exce&s;&s;ive exha|lations mu&s;t be made in this Sultry Climate; to which may be added, the exuberant tran&s;|piration from the Soil, and of per&s;piration from Vegetable productions which every where cover the Ground.</P>
<P>THE extraordinary Moi&s;ture of this Cli|mate is manife&s;t from the quantity of Rain which falls at Charle&s;town, in the cour&s;e of the year&mdash;This, at a medium for ten years, viz. from 1750 to 1760, was 42 inches an|nually, exclu&s;ive of the Moi&s;ture that de|&s;cended in Fogs and Dews.</P>
<P>DEWS that are heavy &s;hew an Atmo&s;|phere
<PB N="349" REF="024239_0355_0FC56C522472B428">
replete with Moi&s;ture: The&s;e are &s;o great here in common Sea&s;ons, that tho&s;e who are abroad at night, are pre&s;ently wet and chilled by them&mdash;The Fogs are &s;ome|times &s;o great in Winter as to ob&s;cure the Sun for &s;everal days together.</P>
<P>DURING this damp Weather, Water may be &s;een pouring down Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, and whatever is painted: Candles burn dimly, the flames appearing as if &s;urrounded with <HI>Halos;</HI> Mar&s;hy Grounds, Ditches, Sinks, and Shallow Standing Waters, emit an offen&s;ive Smell; and all things are render|ed &s;o Damp within doors where no Fires are kept, that on entering a Hou&s;e a mu&s;ty di&s;|agreeable &s;mell is perceived, like that of the Chambers of tho&s;e who are &s;weating in Fe|vers.</P>
<P>AS we have no Hills nor Mountains near us to collect or to conduct the Currents of Air, the Wind &s;eldom blows with much force, except in time of a Hurricane, which
<PB N="350" REF="024239_0356_0FC56C52F1DDF5F0">
happens but &s;eldom, and at no &s;tated periods; nor does &s;uch an outrageous Storm ari&s;e at all, unle&s;s the Winds have been &s;mall and the Weather very Hot and Dry for a con&s;i|derable time before: Hence it &s;hould &s;eem, that the Air at la&s;t becomes &s;o rarified as to permit the contiguous Den&s;er Atmo&s;phere to ru&s;h towards ours with great velocity as into an exhau&s;ted Receiver, in order to re|&s;tore the Equilibrium.</P>
<P>ON the&s;e occa&s;ions the Storm always proceeds from the Northea&s;t; this being the oppo&s;ite point to that from whence the Wind had blown &s;o long before.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the damages &s;u&s;|tained by Individuals on &s;uch occa&s;ions, the want of &s;uch tempe&s;ts for many years toge|ther is probably a great misfortune to us; becau&s;e the Air does not receive &s;ufficient Ventilation to be conducive to Health by any other means in this Climate: But till the Land is more cleared our Atmo&s;phere can|not
<PB N="351" REF="024239_0357_0FC56C5AA1C69F28">
be wholly renewed even by a Hurricane; becau&s;e the Wind cannot penetrate &s;uch an extent of clo&s;e Woods, which are even im|pervious to the Sun's Rays, and where the Air contracts a mephitic quality by clo&s;e confinement, and the impregnation of the fixed Air, after it has been &s;et at liberty by the putrefaction of decaying Vegetables, &amp;c. It is therefore probable that the generality of the Land Winds rather tend to vitiate than to purify the Air with which they come in contact, and that the Winds which come from the Sea are the only ones that purify it at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>OUR Air is liable to as &s;udden and great changes in its temperature as can po&s;&s;ibly happen in any Country; but fortunately the greate&s;t variations are from Warm and Moi&s;t, to Cold and Clear Weather. The&s;e extraordinary vici&s;&s;itudes are mo&s;t frequent in <HI>Winter</HI> and <HI>Spring;</HI> though in <HI>Autumn</HI> the difference between the Heat of the Day and Night often exceeds 20 Degrees.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="024239_0358_0FC56C5BC6C40A58">
FROM the comparatively greater cool|ne&s;s and Moi&s;ture of the Air at Night it probably is, that when the Weather is Calm, during the Autumn, and even later, the whole Country will be covered with a thick Fog. For as the Earth retains the Heat it received from the Sun in the Day longer than the Atmo&s;phere does, it &s;till emits Vapours, which cannot a&s;cend to any con&s;iderable height, becau&s;e of the Colder Air above; and as the humidity that was before diffu&s;ed aloft, is then made to coale&s;ce and fall lower, by its gravity being thus augmented, they together form tho&s;e Den&s;e Clouds which hang, as it were, balanced between the Cool|er Medium above and the Warmer one be|low. But as the Heat of the Soil abates more the longer the Sun has been ab&s;ent, the&s;e Clouds de&s;cend &s;till lower, till they co|ver the face of the Earth in &s;uch a manner, that in the Morning the large&s;t objects are intercepted from our view &s;ometimes at the di&s;tance of 20 yards: But even then, &s;hould we look out of a Window up two pair of
<PB N="353" REF="024239_0359_0FC56C5CC03DFB30">
Stairs, though the Gound below us can not be &s;een, the Air is perfectly &s;erene at that height. The &s;urrounding higher pro&s;pects then appear Roma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ic, and the whole looks like Enchantment. For as only the tops of the Trees and Hou&s;es can be &s;een&punc; they &s;eem to grow and &s;tand, as it were, in the middle of a Great Ocean, which the Fog re&s;embles.</P>
<P>THIS &s;cene will continue till the Va|pours are exhaled by the Sun, or di&s;&s;ipated by the Wind, which commonly happens by 10 o'Clock, A. M. or earlier, and the whole will be di&s;per&s;ed before noon, unle&s;s the Wea|ther continues quite calm.</P>
<P>LIGHTNING and Thunder happen at all Sea&s;ons when it Rains immediately after a &s;hift of Wind; but from April to Septem|ber we &s;eldom have a Shower without both, though they are generally mo&s;t dreadful in June, July, and Augu&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="024239_0360_0FC56C5E35D22708">
I CAN not convey a better idea of the Heat we perceive in pa&s;&s;ing along the Streets at Noon in the Summer than by com|paring it to that glow which &s;trikes one who looks into a pretty warm oven; for it is &s;o increa&s;ed by reflection from the hou&s;es and Sandy Streets as &s;ometimes to rai&s;e the Mer|cury to the 130th degree on Farenheit's Thermometer, when the temperature of the &s;haded Air may not exceed the 94th.</P>

THE manner of living in Charle&s;town is much after the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion; but either weak and acid Punch, or Rum and Water, is u&s;ed by many for con&s;tant Drink, and Peo|ple in ea&s;y circum&s;tances make too liberal u&s;e of Wine, particularly at and after Din|ner, to the great injury of their Con&s;titu|tions.</P>
<P>TEA and Coffee are al&s;o &s;o cheap, that one or other is u&s;ed twice a-day by people of all de&s;criptions; for want of Markets in the Country, more Salted and Smoaked Meats are con&s;umed by the People there than in the Town; they, however, abound with Poultry, Milk, whole&s;ome bread, made of Maize or Rice, and the mo&s;t delicious Fruits.</P>

<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowledged that we are more healthy than formerly, &s;ince the Hur|ricanes of 1752. Children in particular have e&s;caped better &s;ince; for before that time, almo&s;t half the deaths happened a|mong&s;t

<P>THE Gargari&s;ms I u&s;ed in &s;uch ca&s;es were decoctions of Peruvian and Oak Bark, with a &s;mall proportion of Serpentaria, to which Red Wine, Tincture of Myrrh, or Bran|dy, were added; and they were likewi&s;e acidulated with Spirits of Vitriol or Alum, always in a greater or le&s;s proportion as the condition of the Ulcers appeared to require.

<P>WHEN the Inflammatory Symptoms ap|peared con&s;iderable, the Lancet was always employed, and apparently with real benefit.</P>
<P>VERY few who were affected with this &s;pecies of Quin&s;y e&s;caped without having both Scarlet and Miliary eruptions, which generally appeared on the 2d or 3d day of the Fever. And it is remarkable, that they who had the two latter complaints in a co|pious manner, for the mo&s;t part, &s;uffered le&s;s from the Angina. In tho&s;e who had fre|quent Vomitings, and large Watery &s;tools, the danger was very great.&mdash;The&s;e were therefore endeavoured to be re&s;trained by Opiates, Warm Spirituous fomentations, and hot applications to the Body and Limbs.</P></Q>

<HEAD>DISEASES of OCTOBER and NOVEMBER.</HEAD>
<P>DISEASES of a mixed kind, or between the Inflammatory (or rather mild Inflamma|tory Di&s;ea&s;es which appear in the&s;e months &s;oon terminate in Remittents or Intermit|tents) and Intermitting are &s;een in October and November, and al&s;o (as &s;hould have been ob&s;erved before) in March and April; at which time our Con&s;titutions are as it were in a middling &s;tate with regard to ten|&s;ity and laxity.</P>
<P>IN Winter again, when the weather is

clear and cold, the Solids being then &s;pringy and ten&s;e, and the con&s;tituent particles of the blood more intimately united, Intermit|ting Fevers are &s;eldom &s;een, having given place to other Di&s;ea&s;es of an oppo&s;ite nature; unle&s;s the weather be un&s;ea&s;onably warm.</P>
<P>HENCE it appears, that the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of our bodies keeps pace with the weather; and that they do not pa&s;s to either extreme all at once, but rather by degrees, or according as the Air changes in its tempera|ture at different &s;ea&s;ons of the year; &s;o that the&s;e do not &s;ucceed each other &s;uddenly, but with a gradual progre&s;s, our Con&s;titutions conforming thereto, whether the tran&s;ition be from cold to hot, or the contrary.

<P>THE celebrated Dr. Lind of Ha&s;lar Ho&s;|pital, appears to have fallen into a &s;imilar error, owing to the mi&s;repre&s;entation of facts by Dr. Warren and others.</P>
<P>HE has al&s;o recorded an account of the Yellow Fever becoming epidemic in Phila|delphia, in the year 1740, owing to &s;ome in|fected apparel of a gentleman who had died

<HEAD>of the SITUATION, CLIMATE, and DISEASES of GEORGIA.</HEAD>
<HEAD>THE following is the &s;ub&s;tance of accounts received from different corre&s;pondents re&s;pect|ing the Situation, Climate, and Di&s;ea&s;es of Georgia.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tate of Georgia lies between the 31&s;t and 35th degree of north latitude; com|puted to be about 600 miles in length, and 250 in breadth. Bounded ea&s;t by the Atlantic, we&s;t by the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, north by South-Carolina, and &s;outh by Florida.</P>
<P>IT is &s;eparated from South-Carolina by the river Savannah, and from Florida by the river St. Mary.</P>
<P>AUGUSTA, the pre&s;ent &s;eat of government, is &s;ituated on the Savannah river, about 135
<PB N="394" REF="024239_0400_0FC57C9C2BAC8AC0">
miles from its entrance into the ocean. The town of Savannah, on the &s;ame river, which is only 17 miles from its mouth, &s;tands upon an elevated &s;teep bank, and back of it lies an exten&s;ive gravelly plain.</P>
<P>THE north &s;ide of the river on the Carolina &s;hore is a mere bog, from whence numerous exhalations con&s;tantly ri&s;e in warm weather, and by which the inhabitants of the town often &s;uffer when the wind is north or north-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>THE town la&s;t mentioned contains about 250 families. The number of inhabitants in the whole &s;tate, according to the return pre|&s;ented to Congre&s;s, October 28th, 1791, a|mounted to 82548.</P>
<P>AUGUSTA at pre&s;ent is a very incon&s;iderable village; but from its favourable &s;ituation at the head of navigation, and the productive quality of the &s;oil of the adjacent country, it cannot fail
<PB N="395" REF="024239_0401_0FC57C9DC4747508">
of ri&s;ing into con&s;equence in the cour&s;e of a few years.</P>
<P>THE Savannah is fanned every day in Sum|mer by refre&s;hing breezes from the &s;ea; Au|gu&s;ta is deprived of this advantage by its in|land &s;ituation.</P>
<P>FROM June to September the mercury com|monly fluctuates between 76&deg; and 85&deg; in the &s;haded air, but is often as high as 90, and &s;ometimes 100, e&s;pecially forty or fifty miles from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>IN winter it &s;ometimes de&s;cends below 17&deg;, but is very &s;eldom below 32&deg;. It commonly ranges at this &s;ea&s;on from 40 to 60&deg;.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t prevailing winds here in Sum|mer are &s;outh-we&s;t or ea&s;t, and in Winter the north-we&s;t.</P>
<P>THE ea&s;t wind is the warme&s;t in Winter, and the coole&s;t in Summer.</P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="024239_0402_0FC57CA224A71650">
THE &s;outh, which prevails too frequently for the health of the inhabitants, is damp, &s;ultry, inela&s;tic and oppre&s;&s;ive, at all &s;ea&s;ons, but amazingly &s;o in the Summer and Autumn.</P>
<P>ABOUT a fifth part of this &s;tate is as level as a floor, particularly all that tract which lies between the rivers Savannah and St. Mary, extending 40 miles we&s;t. This tract being inter&s;ected with numerous rivers, along the banks of which is one continued mar&s;h, the cleared ground is converted into Rice and Indigo plantations. It other re&s;pects the country exhibits preci&s;ely the &s;ame appearance as South-Carolina.</P>
<P>ABOUT 70 or 80 miles to the we&s;tward, the land begins to be more or le&s;s uneven, ri|&s;ing from &s;mall ridges into hills, and the hills &s;ucce&s;&s;ively increa&s;ing in height till they fi|nally terminate in lofty mountains.</P>

Alleghany and Apalachian mountains, em|phatically &s;tiled the Spine of North-America, terminates in this &s;tate about 60 miles from its &s;outhern boundary.</P>
<P>AS this &s;tate &s;o nearly re&s;embles South-Ca|rolina in &s;ituation, &s;oil, temperature of cli|mate, and almo&s;t every other circum&s;tance, I &s;hall not trouble the reader with parti|culars.</P>
<P>DR. Ram&s;ay advi&s;es &s;trangers who pro|po&s;e to &s;ettle in the &s;outhern &s;tates, to manage &s;o as to arrive there about the beginning of November, that their con&s;titutions may have time to become accommodated to the climate before the commencement of the &s;ickly &s;ea|&s;on. The &s;ame learned and judicious writer remarks, that the &s;udden deaths of per&s;ons unaccu&s;tomed to the climate of South-Caro|lina, are to be referred to an injudicious choice of time in coming to it, and &s;till more to their own imprudence and irregularities, in con|junction with the ho&s;pitality of the inhabi|tants.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>BY comparing the preceding account of the &s;everal climates of the United States with tho&s;e of the countries in Europe in the &s;ame parallels of latitude, we learn that there is a very material difference between them.</P>
<P>THIS circum&s;tance is pre&s;umed to be ow|ing to the following cau&s;es.</P>
<P>1&s;t. To the height of the lands in North-America, which are &s;ituated between the 40th and 50th degrees of latitude, and extend be|tween &s;ix and &s;even hundred miles from north to &s;outh. From the&s;e the greate&s;t ri|vers have their &s;ource. To the ea&s;t of them lie the lakes Superior, Michegan, Huron, Ot&s;wego, Erie, &amp;c. and the intermediate country is covered with impenetrable fore&s;ts, inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;wamps and mora&s;&s;es;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To M. de Mairan we owe the di&s;covery that the rigour of the Winter's cold is tempered by the heat imparted to the atmo&s;phere by the earth, and that this heat is always propor|tioned to the heat ab&s;orbed by the earth in the ab&s;ence of fro&s;t, and that the Winter is more or le&s;s &s;evere according as the heat and dryne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere has been more or le&s;s inten&s;e during the preceding Summer.</P>
<P><HI>Kirwan's E&s;timate of Climates.</HI></P></NOTE>
<PB N="399" REF="024239_0405_0FC57CA82C6203C8">
hence this va&s;t &s;pace is incapable of receiving or retaining much heat in Summer, and con|&s;equently one great &s;ource of that warmth by which the Winters in the old continent are moderated, is here con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>HENCE al&s;o the we&s;terly winds, at lea&s;t &s;uch of them as originate behind the&s;e high lands, depo&s;ite their vapours in pa&s;&s;ing over them, and re-ab&s;orb fre&s;h ones from the&s;e numerous lakes and immen&s;e fore&s;ts over which they pa&s;s, and are thereby &s;till more cooled; for air always participates of the temperature of the &s;ub&s;tance with which it comes in contact.</P>
<P>FARTHER north, viz. between latitude 52 and 63, lie Hud&s;on's Bay and Straits; about
<PB N="400" REF="024239_0406_0FC57CA9A6A75ED8">
50 miles on the &s;outh of this bay, from lat. 50&deg; to 58&deg;, there runs a ridge of mountains, which prevents its receiving any heat from that quarter; and hence the intermediate country is &s;o cold that &s;carce any animal can live in it.</P>
<P>To the ea&s;t, this bay is bounded by the barren, mountainous country of Labrador, and a number of i&s;lands that lie at its en|trance. The portion of the Atlantic oppo&s;ite to the entrance of the&s;e &s;treights is &s;urround|ed partly by the continent of America, and partly by Greenland as far down as lat. 59. Both are mountainous and inter&s;ected by a multitude of creeks and inlets, which are fro|zen over in Winter, and the en&s;uing Sum|mer the floating ice is protected by numerous high i&s;lands, and partly carried down the ea&s;tern coa&s;t as far as lat. 42, whereby the coolne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere is encrea&s;ed. Hence the N. W. winds are the colde&s;t in all the&s;e parts of America during the Winter &s;ea&s;on, and for rea&s;ons which have been ex|plained
<PB N="401" REF="024239_0407_0FC57CAE6BBF7A68">
from page 80 to 96 the north-ea&s;t as the colde&s;t in Summer.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t part of the heat of the atmo&s;|phere is certainly derived from its communi|cation with the land or water over which it pa&s;&s;es, and in this way it receives either heat or cold more readily than any other body of equal bulk, e&s;pecially when confined, as in vallies.</P>
<P>AIR incumbent on &s;eas or on large tracts of water, is generally many degrees warmer in Winter, and cooler in Summer, than air incumbent on land; becau&s;e land is more &s;u&s;ceptible both of heat and cold than water.</P>
<P>EXPERIMENTS made by Mr. Hales in 1724, prove that the &s;urface of the earth is much heated during the Summer, but that this heat de&s;cends very &s;lowly, a great part of it being communicated to the air.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="024239_0408_0FC57CAFB99B48B0">
THAT during the Winter the earth gives out to the air the heat it had accumulated during the Summer, and that on this circum|&s;tance in a great mea&s;ure the temperature of the Winter depends.</P>
<P>Now as the earth mu&s;t receive more or le&s;s heat during the Summer &s;ea&s;on, according to the greater or le&s;&s;er freedom of acce&s;s which the &s;un's rays have to it, and to the longer or &s;horter duration of their acce&s;s, it follows that whatever circum&s;tances have the effect of ob&s;tructing or preventing this acce&s;s mu&s;t dimini&s;h the grand &s;ource which moderates the rigour of the land winds, which prevail during the Winter &s;ea&s;on. The principal cir|cum&s;tances which ob&s;truct the action of the rays of the &s;un upon the earth, are cloudy and wet weather, the effects of extraordinary evaporation.</P>
<P>THE evaporation from the lakes, &s;wamps and fore&s;ts in America is a&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
<P><PB N="403" REF="024239_0409_0FC57CB2561A8608">
THE evaporation from land covered with living vegetables is much greater than from that which is bare. The rays of the &s;un are not only ob&s;tructed by the evaporations from the&s;e immen&s;e fore&s;ts, but where the trees are tall and clo&s;e together, they are entirely excluded from acting upon the ground at all.</P>
<P>HENCE it may be pre&s;umed that the woods, thickets, and height of the lands in North-America are the circum&s;tances which render the climates of the &s;everal &s;tates different from, and le&s;s agreeable than the countries in the &s;ame latitude in Europe, where the lands are lower, and the country more cleared and bet|ter cultivated.</P>
<P>WE al&s;o learn from the account of the di&s;|ea&s;es contained in the preceding pages, that the cold of the northern &s;tates properly guard|ed again&s;t, produces but few di&s;ea&s;es of a dangerous nature, and that Intermitting, Re|mitting or Bilious Fevers, and Fluxes, are &s;carcely ever known there; but in proceeding
<PB N="404" REF="024239_0410_0FC57CB36E446FC8">
to the &s;outhward in Maryland and Virginia, where the heat is more inten&s;e and of longer continuance, and the &s;oil more moi&s;t, e&s;peci|ally upon lands in an imperfect &s;tate of culti|vation, the di&s;ea&s;es la&s;t mentioned are very prevalent, and often fatal, e&s;pecially to fo|reigners; though the natives who fix their habitations in dry and elevated &s;ituations, and ob&s;erve a medium between exce&s;s and ab&s;ti|nence, enjoy a tolerable &s;hare of health.</P>
<P>IN South-Carolina and Georgia, Fevers and Fluxes are &s;till more epidemic, violent, and ob&s;tinate, e&s;pecially after the Rice harve&s;t in Augu&s;t and September, when the waters are dimini&s;hed and permitted to &s;tagnate and corrupt. The fevers which occur at this &s;ea|&s;on are very anomalous, neither intermitting nor remitting perfectly, but participating much of the nature of that commonly called the Yellow Fever, which is often &s;o fatal with|in the Tropics.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the United States of America
<PB N="405" REF="024239_0411_0FC57CB511C898D8">
cannot boa&s;t of the &s;uperiority of their cli|mates over other countries in parallel lati|tudes, they are exceeded by few in fertility of &s;oil, and equalled by none in political advan|tages.</P>
<P>AND, from whatever cau&s;es it may proceed, the inhabitants, in the middle and particularly in the northern &s;tates enjoy a greater proportion of health, and live to a greater age than the in|habitants of Europe. The di&s;ea&s;es which do occur are more &s;imple and uniform; and this country is intirely exempt from &s;ome of the mo&s;t formidable and de&s;tructive which infe&s;t the other quarters of the globe.</P>
<P>THE Spotted Pe&s;tilence, the fatal offspring of famine, uncleanline&s;s, and vitiated air, has never yet reached our favoured &s;hores.</P>
<P>THE Small-pox, the Mea&s;les, the Malig|nant Quin&s;y, the Influenza, and almo&s;t every other contagious di&s;ea&s;e were foreigners to this continent, till they were introduced
<PB N="406" REF="024239_0412_0FC57CBA468382D0">
through the medium of commerce from Eu|rope, into which they were fir&s;t conveyed from A&s;ia, or the dominions of the de&s;potic Turk, bordering on that immen&s;e continent.</P>
<P>THE Lepro&s;y, the Yaws, the Eliphantia&s;is, and other loath&s;ome di&s;orders are endemic to Africa.</P>
<P>WHETHER Africa or South-America gave origin to the Syphilis remains uncertain, though that di&s;honour is generally a&s;cribed to the latter.</P>
<P>NOR is North-America, like many other countries, &s;ubject to earthquakes, the erup|tion of volcanoes, hurricanes, periodical de|luges, impetuous whirlwinds, noxious and con&s;uming bla&s;ts of wind, or withering and protracted drought.</P>
<P>WHAT does it avail the inhabitants of A|&s;ia that many of their provinces are ble&s;t with the mo&s;t delightful climate and fertile &s;oil
<PB N="407" REF="024239_0413_0FC57CBBA8AFAE10">
that imagination can conceive, &s;ince they them&s;elves are in &s;ubjection to the arbitrary will of a capricious and de&s;potic tyrant.</P>
<P>ONE half of Africa lies beneath the burn|ing line, and its &s;able inhabitants are all im|mer&s;ed in rude and di&s;mal barbari&s;m, entirely unacquainted with the u&s;e of the Plough and the Loom.</P>
<P>EVEN in Europe (the &s;eat of Science and the nur&s;e of Arts) Liberty, "the mo&s;t preci|ous gift of heaven to man," is &s;carcely known, or only enjoyed by the lucky and the favoured few. The re&s;t are greater drudges than the bea&s;ts they own; for there, &s;ociety is divided into two di&s;tinct cla&s;&s;es, nobles and commons, lords and tenants: the former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and enjoying every thing; the latter indigent, op|pre&s;&s;ed, and almo&s;t de&s;titute of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>NORTH-AMERICA is the only portion of this &s;pacious globe where man can
<PB N="408" REF="024239_0414_0FC57CBE5D5AA600">
live &s;ecurely, and enjoy all the privileges to which he has a native right.</P>
<P>IN this enviable and favoured region there is no proud&mdash;u&s;urping ari&s;tocracy&mdash;no ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical orders with exclu&s;ive privileges&mdash;no kings with arbitrary power or corrupting influence&mdash;no venal parliaments compo&s;ed of different ranks and oppo&s;ing intere&s;ts&mdash;no monopolizing confederacies of opulent and intere&s;ted traders and manufacturers, to the exclu&s;ion of tho&s;e to whom chance or fortune has been le&s;s liberal.</P>
<P>NOR are the taxes or expences of govern|ment &s;o con&s;iderable as to con&s;ume the pro|fits of hone&s;t indu&s;try, or ever employed to gratify the &s;plendid projects of mad ambi|tion.</P>
<P>IT is true none of the enervating re|finements of luxury or di&s;&s;ipation are to be found here; but here all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life abound, and a plea&s;ing
<PB N="409" REF="024239_0415_0FC57CBFACFB59B0">
equality and decent competence are every where di&s;played&mdash;here the dignity of the human &s;pecies is re&s;tored, and man enjoys all the freedom to which he is entitled; for here he is a member of the government he obeys, and a framer of the laws by which he is governed, either in per&s;on or by the repre|&s;entatives of his own choice.</P>
