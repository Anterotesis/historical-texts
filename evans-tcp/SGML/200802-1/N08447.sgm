<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS your Excellency, together with the members of his Maje&s;ty's honourable council, and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, were plea&s;ed at my late vi&s;it to the Orphan-hou&s;e, not only highly to approve of, but al&s;o deeply to intere&s;t your&s;elves in, the de&s;ign of converting the pre&s;ent Georgia Orphan-hou&s;e into a college; &s;o I am per&s;uaded, you make no doubt, but that ever &s;ince my arrival in England, in July 1765, I have exerted my utmo&s;t efforts in endeavouring to bring this important affair to a de&s;irable i&s;&s;ue. To
<PB N="4" REF="010803_0003_0F81D635746ECE48">
mention all the various circum&s;tances which have occur|red during that interval, to impede and retard its more &s;peedy pro&s;ecution, would be tedious and unnece&s;&s;ary: I would therefore only inform your Excellency, that about fifteen months ago, a memorial was delivered into the hands of the late clerk of his Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t honour|able privy council. That this memorial was by him tran&s;mitted to the Lord Pre&s;ident, and by his Lord&s;hip referred to the con&s;ideration of his Grace the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; that by his Grace's permi&s;&s;ion a literary corre&s;pondence en&s;ued; but as that corre&s;pondence, and with that, the negotiation it&s;elf &s;eems at an end, I think it my duty, not only to lay an account of the whole before your Excellency in particular; but, through your Excellency's hands; before his Maje&s;ty's council and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives of the colony of Georgia, toge|ther with all the other American Coloni&s;ts, and the pub|lick in general, on both &s;ides the water, who have &s;o liberally contributed to the promoting this de&s;ign.</P>

<HEAD>TO The KING's mo&s;t Excellent MAJESTY, THE MEMORIAL of George Whitefield, Clerk,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sheweth,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT about twenty-&s;ix years ago, your memoria|li&s;t, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the voluntary contributions of charitable and well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, at a very great ex|pence, and under many di&s;advantages, did erect a very commodious hou&s;e with nece&s;&s;ary out-buildings, &s;uita|ble for the reception of orphans and other poor and de|&s;erted children; and that with the repair of the build|ings, purcha&s;e of negroes, and &s;upporting a large orphan family &s;o many years, he hath expended upwards of twelve thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, as appears by the ac|counts, which from time to time have been audited by the magi&s;trates of Savannah, and which are humbly pre&s;ented with this memorial.</P>
<P>That your Memoriali&s;t, &s;ince the commencement of this in&s;titution, hath had the &s;atisfaction of finding, that by the money expended thereon, not only many poor families were a&s;&s;i&s;ted and thereby kept from leaving the colony in its infant &s;tate; but al&s;o that a con&s;iderable number of poor helple&s;s children have been trained up, who have been, and are now u&s;eful &s;ettlers in that and the other neighbouring provinces; that in order to ren|der the in&s;titution afore&s;aid more exten&s;ively u&s;eful, your Memoriali&s;t, as he perceived the colony gradually ri&s;ing,
<PB N="6" REF="010803_0004_0F81D6362E65C308">
hath for &s;ome years pa&s;t de&s;igned, within him&s;elf, to improve the original plan, by making further provi&s;ion for the education of per&s;ons of &s;uperiour rank, who thereby may be qualified to &s;erve their king, their coun|try, and their God, either in church or &s;tate.</P>
<P>That in his late vi&s;it to Georgia, he did with inex|pre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure &s;ee the province in a very flouri&s;hing &s;tate; but with concern perceived that &s;everal gentle|men had been obliged to &s;end their &s;ons to the Northern Provinces, who would much rather have had them edu|cated nearer home; and thereby prevent their affections being alienated from their native country, and al&s;o con|&s;iderable &s;ums of money from being carried out of Georgia into other provinces.</P>
<P>Your Memoriali&s;t begs leave further to ob&s;erve, that there is no Seminary for Academical Studies as yet founded &s;outhward of Virginia; and con&s;equently if a college could be e&s;tabli&s;hed (e&s;pecially as the addition of the two Floridas renders Georgia more centrical for the &s;outhern di&s;trict) it would not only be highly &s;erviceable to the ri&s;ing generation of the colony of Georgia, but would probably occa&s;ion many youths to be &s;ent from the neighbouring &s;outhern provinces for education. The many advantages accruing to Georgia thereby mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>That in con&s;ideration of the foregoing premi&s;es, your Memoriali&s;t in December 1764, pre&s;ented a memorial to his excellency the Governour and the honourable the council of the province of Georgia, praying that two thou&s;and acres of land might be granted in tru&s;t towards carrying on the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rable end of founding a college; which motion was not only immediately complied with, but the general a&s;&s;embly being then &s;itting, an addre&s;s, a copy of which is herewith al&s;o &s;ent, was pre&s;ented from them to his Excellency, expre&s;&s;ing their unanimous and

highe&s;t approbation, with a de&s;ire that his Excellency would u&s;e his endeavours to have this affair forwarded at home with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. That upon the arri|val of your Memoriali&s;t, he was informed that this ad|dre&s;s was remitted to, and laid before the Lords Com|mi&s;&s;ioners for trade and plantations; having received re|peated advices that numbers both in Georgia and South-Carolina are waiting with impatience to have their &s;ons initiated in academical exerci&s;es, Your Memoriali&s;t there|fore prays that a charter upon the plan of New-Jer&s;ey College may be granted, upon which your Memoriali&s;t is ready to give up his pre&s;ent tru&s;t and make a free gift of all lands, negroes, goods and chattels, which he now &s;tands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in the province of Georgia, for the pre&s;ent founding, and towards the future &s;upport, of a college, to be called by the name of Bethe&s;da College in the province of Georgia.</P>

<P>I THINK my&s;elf highly honoured in the Lord Pre&s;i|dent's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Earl of Northington.</NOTE> referring a late memorial to your Grace's con|&s;ideration; and as highly obliged to your Grace, for the deep attention your Grace hath given to the copy of an intended charter pre&s;ented to your Grace by the Earl of Dartmouth.&mdash;The inclo&s;ed will &s;hew what an almo&s;t im|plicite regard hath been paid to your Grace's wi&s;e re|marks and judicious corrections.&mdash;I wi&s;h it could have been altogether implicite&mdash;But circum&s;tances are &s;uch (as hath been hinted to your Grace by Lord Dartmouth) that I cannot in honour and con&s;cience <HI>oblige</HI> the ma&s;ter
<PB N="8" REF="010803_0005_0F81D63667120F58">
of the Georgia College to be a member or mini&s;ter of the church of England. Such an obligation, I am per&s;uad|ed, hath greatly retarded the progre&s;s of the college of New-York; as on the contrary, the letter &s;igned by your Grace, Proprietor Penn, and the late Dr. Chandler, en|gaging, that that in&s;titution &s;hall be continued on a BROAD BOTTOM, hath as much promoted the growth of the college of Philadelphia.&mdash;The tru&s;tees of that &s;emi|nary (as your Grace is plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve) have agreed, "That their provo&s;t &s;hall always be a mini&s;ter of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church."&mdash;But then I would beg leave to reply, that they are not thereto <HI>enjoined</HI> by their charter. That is entirely &s;ilent concerning this matter&mdash;Their agree|ment is purely voluntary.&mdash;The wardens of the college of Georgia will not be prohibited by charter from fol|lowing the example of the tru&s;tees of the college of Phi|ladelphia&mdash;It is more than probable they will never need it. The fir&s;t ma&s;ter will a&s;&s;uredly be a clergyman of the church of England.&mdash;By far the majority of the intend|ed wardens are, and always will be, members of that communion; and con&s;equently the choice of a ma&s;ter will always continue to run in that channel&mdash;My heart's de&s;ire is, that &s;ome worthy duly qualified mini&s;ter of the church of England may be always and readily found for that grand purpo&s;e. But le&s;t this &s;hould not always be the ca&s;e, I dare not, as per&s;ons of all denominations have been contributors, confine or fetter the future electors. The monies gained by the New-York lotteries, for the erecting a college in New-York; were thrown in by per|&s;ons of all religious per&s;wa&s;ions, in confidence, that the college would hereafter be founded on an enlarged ba&s;is. And therefore, very great numbers, may it plea&s;e your Grace, think, and forever will think, them&s;elves injured by its being confined within its pre&s;ent contracted bound|ary. Hence it is, that many fine promi&s;ing youths are
<PB N="9" REF="010803_0005_0F81D63667120F58">
almo&s;t daily &s;ent from the college in their native city to that of New-Jer&s;ey&mdash;I dread giving the &s;ame occa&s;ion of re&s;entment and offence&mdash;And therefore am determined to avoid it in the wording of the Georgia College charter&mdash;For the &s;ame rea&s;ons I dare not enjoin the daily u&s;e of our church liturgy. I love to u&s;e it, I have fallen a martyr, in re&s;pect to bodily health, to the frequent read|ing it in Tottenham-Court chapel; and it has been con|&s;tantly read twice every &s;unday in the Orphan-hou&s;e, from its fir&s;t in&s;titution to this very day&mdash;The wardens, when the power is devolved on them, may determine this point as they plea&s;e&mdash;But I cannot enjoin it by charter&mdash;And have therefore, in this pre&s;ent draught, not only omitted the paragraph concerning publick prayer, but al&s;o that concerning doctrinal articles. Perhaps your Grace may judge, that all things con&s;idered, &s;aying no|thing about either, may be a proper medium&mdash;Your Grace further wi&s;ely ob&s;erves, That his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be very well advi&s;ed whom he names for the fir&s;t ma|&s;ter.&mdash;I tru&s;t he will. I believe the Right Honour|able the Earl of Dartmouth will vouch&s;afe to intere&s;t him&s;elf in the choice, and likewi&s;e be &s;o good as to pre|&s;ent the fir&s;t ma&s;ter to your Grace's approbation&mdash;The terms of the charter being not as yet &s;ettled, the choice of a ma&s;ter cannot as yet be fixed upon. When the for|mer are a&s;certained, the latter may more ea&s;ily be ap|plied for&mdash;In the mean while your Grace may be a&s;&s;ured that the lot will not fall upon me. Alas! my &s;houlders are too weak for the &s;upport of &s;uch an academical bur|den: my capacity, may it plea&s;e your Grace, is by no means exten&s;ive enough for &s;uch a &s;chola&s;tick tru&s;t&mdash;To be a pre&s;byter at large, is the &s;tation which, I think, di|vine providence hath called me to for near the&s;e thirty years la&s;t pa&s;t&mdash;During that &s;pace, I tru&s;t my eye hath been in &s;ome degree &s;ingle, and my views di&s;intere&s;ted:

<P>MY obligations are much increa&s;ed by your Grace's putting the la&s;t draught of the Georgia College &s;o &s;peedily into the hands of the Lord Pre&s;ident.&mdash;As by this, (I pre&s;ume) it hath been honoured by your Grace's, &s;o I make no manner of doubt, but it will al&s;o meet with his Lord&s;hip's approbation. In obedience to your Grace's de&s;ire, I herewith &s;end your Grace an account of what pre&s;ent endowment, "and to what value, I propo&s;e for the intended College."&mdash;Upon a moderate computation, may it plea&s;e your Grace, I believe its pre&s;ent annual in|come is between four and five hundred pounds &s;terling. The hou&s;e is &s;urrounded with eighteen hundred acres of land; a plan of which, and likewi&s;e of the hou&s;e it&s;elf, I herein inclo&s;e, and humbly pre&s;ent for your Grace's pe|ru&s;al. The number of negroes, young and old, employed on various parts of the&s;e lands, in &s;awing timber, rai&s;ing rice for exportation, and corn, with all other kinds of pro|vi&s;ion for the family, is about thirty.&mdash;Be&s;ides the&s;e, the College will be immediately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two thou&s;and acres of land near Alatamaha, which were granted me by the Governour and Council when I was la&s;t at Georgia, and a thou&s;and acres more, left, as I am informed, by the late Reverend and worthy Mr. Zouber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uhler.&mdash;So that, by laying out only a thou&s;and pounds in purcha&s;ing an additional number of negroes, and allowing another thou&s;and fot repairing the hou&s;e, and building the two intended wings, the pre&s;ent annual income may very ea&s;ily and &s;peedily be augmented to a thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum.</HI> Out of this &s;tanding fund may be paid the &s;alaries of the ma&s;ter, profe&s;&s;ors, tutors, &amp;c. and al&s;o &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l ex|hibitions

be allowed for &s;ome orphan or other poor &s;tudents, who may have their tutorage and room-rent gratis, and act as &s;ervitors to tho&s;e who enter commoners. What the&s;e &s;alaries and exhibitions ought to be, may at a proper &s;ea&s;on be &s;ubmitted to your Grace's future con|&s;ideration.&mdash;At pre&s;ent I would only further propo&s;e, that the negro children belonging to the College &s;hall be in&s;tructed, in their intervals of labour, by one of the poorer &s;tudents, as is done now by one of the &s;cholars in the pre&s;ent Orphan-hou&s;e. And I do not &s;ee why an ad|ditional provi&s;ion may not likewi&s;e be made for educating and maintaining a number of Indian children, which, I imagine, may ea&s;ily be procured from the Creeks, Choc|taws, Cherokees, and the other neighbouring nations. Hence the whole will be a free gift to the colony of Georgia&mdash;a complex exten&s;ive charity be e&s;tabli&s;hed; and, at the &s;ame time, not a &s;ingle per&s;on obliged, by any publick act of a&s;&s;embly, to pay an involuntary forced tax towards the &s;upport of a &s;eminary from which many of the more di&s;tant and poorer Coloni&s;ts children cannot po&s;&s;ibly receive any immediate advantage, and yet the whole colony, by the chri&s;tian and liberal education of a great number of its individuals, be univer&s;ally benefited. Thus have I mo&s;t readily, and I humbly hope, gratefully complied with your Grace's de&s;ire, which to me is as a command. I am con&s;trained to tre&s;pa&s;s on your Grace's patience, whil&s;t I congratulate your Grace on the good|ne&s;s of God, who, among&s;t many other &s;ignal marks of his peculiar providence, hath honoured your Grace, in making you an happy in&s;trument of e&s;tabli&s;hing two Northern American Colleges, the one at New-York, and the other at Philadelphia: And if (as I pray may be the ca&s;e) your Grace &s;hould yet be made further in&s;trumen|tal in e&s;tabli&s;hing a third College in the yet more Southern di&s;tant, but now flouri&s;hing, Colony of Georgia, I tru&s;t

<OPENER><SALUTE>SHEWETH,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT about twenty-five years ago, your Memori|ali&s;t, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the voluntary contributions of charitable and well-di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, at a very great ex|pence, and under many di&s;advantages, did erect a com|modious hou&s;e, with nece&s;&s;ary out-buildings, &s;uitable for the reception of orphans, and other poor and de&s;erted children; and that with the repair of the buildings, pur|cha&s;e of negroes, and &s;upporting a large ophan family for &s;o many years, he hath expended upwards of twelve thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, as appears by the accounts,
<PB N="23" REF="010803_0012_0F81D63EA59834E0">
which from time to time have been audited by the ma|gi&s;trates of Savannah.</P>
<P>That your Memoriali&s;t, &s;ince the commencement of this in&s;titution, hath had the &s;atisfaction of finding that by the money expended thereon, not only many poor families were a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and thereby kept from leaving the colony in its infant &s;tate, but al&s;o that a con&s;iderable number of poor helple&s;s children have been trained up; who have been, and now are u&s;eful &s;ettlers in this and the other neighbouring provinces.</P>
<P>That in order to render the in&s;titution afore&s;aid more exten&s;ively u&s;eful, your Memoriali&s;t, as he perceived the colony gradually increa&s;ing, hath for &s;ome years pa&s;t de&s;igned within him&s;elf, to improve the original plan, by making further provi&s;ion for the education of per|&s;ons of &s;uperiour rank; who thereby might be qualifi|ed to &s;erve their king, their country, or their God, ei|ther in church or &s;tate.&mdash;That he doth with inexpre&s;&s;i|ble plea&s;ure &s;ee the pre&s;ent very flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the province; but with concern perceives that &s;everal gen|tlemen have been obliged to &s;end their &s;ons to the nor|thern provinces; who would much rather have had them educated nearer home, and thereby prevent their affect|ions being alienated from their native country, and al&s;o con&s;iderable &s;ums of money from being carried out of this into other provinces.</P>
<P>Your Memoriali&s;t further ob&s;erves, that there is no Seminary for Academical Studies as yet founded &s;outh|ward of Virginia; and con&s;equently if a college could be e&s;tabli&s;hed here (e&s;pecially as the late addition of the two Floridas renders Georgia more centrical for the
<PB N="24" REF="010803_0013_0F81D6406B348430">
&s;outhern di&s;trict) it would not only be highly &s;erviceable to the ri&s;ing generation of this colony, but would pro|bably occa&s;ion many youths to be &s;ent from the Briti&s;h We&s;t-India I&s;lands and other parts&mdash;The many advan|tages accruing thereby to this province mu&s;t be very con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations, your Memoriali&s;t is induced to believe, that the time is now approaching, when his long projected de&s;ign for further &s;erving this his beloved colony &s;hall be carried into execution.</P>
<P>That a con&s;iderable sum of money is intended &s;peedi|ly to be laid out in purcha&s;ing a large number of negroes for the further cultivation of the pre&s;ent Orphan hou&s;e and other additional lands, and for the future &s;upport of a worthy able pre&s;ident, profe&s;&s;ors, and tutors, and other good purpo&s;es intended.</P>
<P>Your Memoriali&s;t therefore prays your Excellency and Honours to great to him in tru&s;t, for the purpo&s;es afore|&s;aid, two thou&s;and acres of land, on the north fork of Turtle River, called the Le&s;&s;er Swamp, if vacant, or where lands may be found vacant, &s;outh of the river Alatamaha.</P>
