<P>But not to be too <HI>general,</HI> I &s;hall contract and con|fine my Thoughts to one particular Branch of Divine <HI>Providence,</HI> plainly directed to in the Words of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, GOD &s;tandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty.</HI></P>
<P>The heavenly <HI>Intelligencies</HI> have the Stile <HI>Mighty</HI> given them in the &s;acred Oracles.

<P><PB N="8" REF="005737_0007_1026D44D065ED818">
It is evident then, That by the <HI>Mighty,</HI> in the Con|gregation of whom GOD is &s;aid to &s;tand, we are to under&s;tand <HI>Men</HI> that are concerned in the Government of a People, tho&s;e that &s;u&s;tain high Po&s;ts, who have the <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI> Power in their Hands, who a&s;&s;emble and &s;it to con&s;ider, determine and re&s;olve upon what will be for the Relief and Good of particular Per&s;ons, and Bodies and Societies of Men under their Juri&s;diction; and the Defence, Peace and Happine&s;s of the People in general, committed to their Charge: The&s;e are the Per|&s;ons, I conceive, whom the P&s;almi&s;t means, when he &s;ays, <HI>GOD &s;tandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty.</HI></P>
<P>In this great Congregation GOD &s;tandeth: I &s;uppo&s;e every one will ea&s;ily conceive, that bodily Parts and Po&s;tures are by no means &s;trictly and properly to be a&s;cribed unto Him, who is an immen&s;e <HI>Spirit;</HI> but with|out any Difficulty will &s;ee a <HI>Figure</HI> in the Word.

<P>I &s;hall endeavour to di&s;cour&s;e upon the Words under the two following PROPOSITIONS.</P>

<P>The <HI>Congregation of the Mighty,</HI> &s;ays the Text, im|plying there was a <HI>Number</HI> inve&s;ted with Power and Authority convened for the Exerci&s;e thereof. Now that it is mo&s;t fit and &s;uitable it &s;hould be, will appear from the three following Things.</P>
<P N="1">1^s^t, Such is the <HI>Infirmity</HI> and <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> of the human Under&s;tanding in Man's pre&s;ent Condition, as to render Government managed by a <HI>Number</HI> of Men mo&s;t eligible.</P>
<P>In this State of Imperfection, the intellectual Powers of Mankind labour under great Di&s;advantages; tho' they may be greatly improv'd, &s;trengthned and brightned by U&s;e, Study, Education and Conver&s;ation: The wi&s;e&s;t Man is not always wi&s;e; his Mind is &s;ubject to <HI>Inadvertency,</HI> and his Memory needs a <HI>Monitor:</HI> Tho' his Capacity be large and exten&s;ive, yet there may be &s;ome Things re|lating to the publick Good, that have e&s;caped his Ob&s;er|vation, that others may take Notice of; and for this Rea&s;on 'tis be&s;t there &s;hould be an A&s;&s;embly of Rulers: The Welfare of a People may be more promoted by having <HI>many</HI> Heads employ'd for it, than One only.</P>
<P>When there is a <HI>Number</HI> concern'd in <HI>Government,</HI> &s;etting to deliberate and re&s;olve upon Mea&s;ures proper to be taken for the Safety, Peace and Advantage of a People, or the Relief and Happine&s;s of particular Men; the Debates, in &s;uch an A&s;&s;embly, are productive of <HI>Light,</HI> which tends to prepare and ripen the Thoughts of <HI>Rulers</HI> for coming to a Determination upon the weighty Mat|ters that call for their Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="2">2^d^l^y, The <HI>Burden</HI> of Government, if faithfully attend|ed, is too great for a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> Per&s;on to bear.</P>

<P>There is a Multiplicity of arduous Concerns that he upon the Hands, and fill the Head of a <HI>Civil Ruler;</HI> and it is &s;o e&s;pecially at &s;ome particular <HI>Junctures.</HI> The Safety and Defence of his People is to be inten&s;ely re|garded, when Enemies make <HI>War</HI> again&s;t them: Their Trade is to be protected; it may be, they are fallen into perplext and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Circum&s;tances, and, if it can be, are to be extricated and delivered out of them: Good Laws mu&s;t be &s;upported, and new ones occa&s;ionally made; meet Per&s;ons to <HI>execute</HI> them are to be cho&s;en, and put into Commi&s;&s;ion: <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI> are to be upheld, and Mea&s;ures taken to promote the flouri&s;hing of the&s;e great Intere&s;ts: The <HI>Grievances</HI> of particular Per&s;ons and Societies mu&s;t, if it be practicable, be redre&s;s'd. It is not enough, that a Ruler take Care, that the People don't &s;uffer in their Per&s;ons and Intere&s;ts; but he mu&s;t lay him&s;elf out to advance their <HI>Pro&s;perity:</HI> And it may be further ob&s;erved, that &s;ometimes a People are grievou&s;|ly out of <HI>Frame;</HI> and this renders the Difficulties of Government &s;o much the greater.

<P N="3">3^d^l^y, For one Per&s;on alone to have the Government of a People in his Hands, would be too great a Temp|tation.</P>
<P>It tends to excite and draw forth the Pride of Man, to make him un&s;ufferably haughty; it gives him too much Liberty to exert his <HI>Corruptions;</HI> and it encourages him to become a <HI>Tyrant</HI> and an <HI>Oppre&s;&s;or,</HI> to <HI>di&s;pen&s;e</HI> with Laws, and break the mo&s;t &s;olemn Oaths; to pro|ceed &s;o far in his unrighteous Practices, that his Subjects, weary of the Doctrine of <HI>pa&s;&s;ive Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non-re&s;i&s;|tance,</HI> are nece&s;&s;itated to plead their own Cau&s;e, and vin|dicate

<P>From the Whole then, it appears, that it is mo&s;t fit and &s;uitable that a <HI>Number</HI> &s;hould be concern'd in <HI>Civil Government,</HI> that it is be&s;t for a People to be under &s;uch a Con&s;titution and E&s;tabli&s;hment, whether it be a mixt <HI>Monarchy,</HI> that excellent Form which <HI>our Nations,</HI> and the <HI>Briti&s;h Plantations</HI> are happily in the Enjoyment of, who are governed by a KING, Hou&s;e of <HI>Peers,</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> the latter of which are cho&s;en by the People; or an <HI>Ari&s;tocracy,</HI> which is the Government of a <HI>Com|monwealth,</HI> by <HI>Nobles;</HI> or a <HI>Democracy,</HI> wherein <HI>Magi|&s;trates</HI> are elected from among and by the People.</P>
