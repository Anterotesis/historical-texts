<P><HI>PIETY</HI> is big with Ble&s;&s;ings to the Publick, and al&s;o to every Per&s;on. But e&s;pecially are <HI>pious Rulers</HI> a &s;ingular Benefit and Glory to any Peo|ple.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THESE are &s;ome of the la&s;t Words of <HI>David,</HI> the King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the LORD's Prophet, and the Father of his People. He &s;pake them to <HI>an a&s;&s;embly of the Princes of the Tribes of I&s;rael,</HI> their <HI>Captains &amp; Officers,</HI> whom he had &s;ummon'd together to receive his la&s;t Will and <HI>Charge.</HI> The Subject whereon he now di&s;cours'd them, was as became
<PB N="2" REF="002419_0011_0FDBD15A982F8B28">
a <HI>dying</HI> King &amp; Saint, <HI>the Wor&s;hip &amp; Hou&s;e of GOD</HI> among them; that <HI>this</HI> might be their Care after his decea&s;e, and that with Religion the Favour and Ble&s;&s;ing of God might be entail'd upon them, and on their Children after them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Aged King</HI> had been very <HI>weak</HI> and like to die before this, but &s;eems to have &s;ome little <HI>revival,</HI> &s;ome return of vital warmth and heat, and thus he improv'd it; he would once more &s;ee his <HI>Nobles</HI> and Officers about him, and give them his la&s;t <HI>Char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> and Ble&s;&s;ing, and take his la&s;t <HI>leave</HI> of them. <HI>So</HI> it became the King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to die.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>this illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly</HI> pre&s;ented them|&s;elves before him, <HI>the King &s;tood up upon his feet,</HI> ver. 2. God &s;trengthen'd him for this la&s;t and noble Act of his life He had a Me&s;&s;age from God to deliver to them, and it became him to &s;hew this reverence. He al&s;o honour'd as well as lov'd the noble Per&s;ons whom he &s;pake to; and they were worthy of this re&s;pect from their King: <HI>the Princes of the people of the God of Abraham; his Brethren and the People of his God.</HI></P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY he be&s;peaks them with af|fection and re&s;pect, <HI>Hear me my Brethren and my people.</HI> Humility becomes and adorns even Kings them&s;elves. It is a truly royal Robe wherewith they &s;hould be cloth'd. Nor &s;hould it be put on only as a grave-cloth when they come to die, and mu&s;t be laid in the du&s;t.</P>

God had forbid him and had re&s;erv'd that great and good Work for his Son after him.

<P>THESE Words are a very grave and &s;olemn Charge, whereof we may con&s;ider, 1.

<P>How much more was it for them to con&s;ider, 3. That it was <HI>in the audience of God Him&s;elf</HI> that they were now &s;poken to.

<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> THAT we &s;hould every one of us &s;eri|ou&s;ly con&s;ider, that it is in the &s;ight of all the Lord's people, the Congregation of the Lord, and in the Audience of our GOD, that we are under this Charge.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> THAT the Church, Kingdom and Wor|&s;hip of CHRIST among us, the Hou&s;e of our GOD, depends on our religious &s;eeking &amp; keeping of GOD's Commandments.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> THAT this is the way to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this good Land which the Lord our God has given us, and to leave it for an Inheritance unto our Children after us.</P>
<P>I. <HI>THAT the People of God in general, the Rulers of a people in particular, and every &s;ingle per&s;on among them, are under the &s;trict Charge of GOD to &s;eek for &amp; keep all His Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>SO they are charged, and this is the Charge in our text. And here I &s;hall &s;ay, 1 This is the Charge of the Lord our God. 2 We are all under it. 3. The Rulers of a People are &s;o in an e&s;pe|cial manner.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS is <HI>the Charge</HI> of the Lord our God, that we keep and &s;eek for all His Commandments&punc;
<PB N="7" REF="002419_0016_0FDBD164F9F2A7E0">
We have his Commandments in his <HI>Word.</HI> They are the Laws, Statutes, Te&s;timonies, and Judgments of the Lord our God; and in &s;hort <HI>His Covenant</HI> with his people. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Prophets have han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed them down to us; and CHRIST (the Eternal Son of GOD, and Lord of all the Holy Prophets) has confirm'd &amp; ratify'd them. Mo&s;es be&s;peaks the Church for ever in the 4. <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Deut. Behold, I have taught you &s;tatutes &amp; judgments, as the Lord my God commanded me: ye &s;hall not add unto the Word which I command you, neither &s;hall ye dimini&s;h ought from it: And what Nation is there &s;o great, that hath &s;tatutes &amp; judgments &s;o righteous, as all this Law which I &s;et before you?</HI> Now, &s;ays the text.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE mu&s;t religiou&s;ly <HI>keep</HI> the Command|ments of the Lord our God. Laws are made, and Gods laws are written to us, to be ob&s;erved &amp; kept. A Commandment implies Obedience. We mu&s;t needs be <HI>&s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ect</HI> to the <HI>Power</HI> that is over us, to give laws and to judge us by the laws, both for <HI>wrath</HI> &amp; for <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> &s;ake. The law is to rule &amp; govern us&punc; To <HI>keep</HI> the Commandment is to do it; to ob&s;erve &amp; obey it with our hearts and in our lives. We mu&s;t keep it in our minds and hide it in our hearts, that we may not &s;in again&s;t it, tran&s;gre&s;s and break it, in tho't word or deed. We mu&s;t therefore keep our Souls diligently that we may keep God's word. The keeping it implies care, diligence, con&s;tancy &amp; plea&s;ure. Faith, fear, love, reverence, e&s;teem of the word, and de&s;ire to ple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e and glorify God, do all meet in every act of accep|table Obedience to God. Deut. 10 12. <HI>What doth

the Lord thy God require of thee? but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to love him, and to &s;erve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy &s;oul; to keep the Commandments of the Lord, and his &s;tatutes, which I command thee this day.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. WE mu&s;t keep <HI>all</HI> the Commandments. So the text requires. Our Obedience mu&s;t be uni|ver&s;al. What body of Laws is there but Obedi|ence is equally required to them all. What &s;ingle Law was ever given, but to be obeyed? The &s;ame Authority enacts one &amp; another of them. <HI>Every word of God is pure</HI>; all his Commands are holy, ju&s;t &amp; good. He that breaks one law is a tran&s;|gre&s;&s;or, and liable to the Judgment. <HI>He that of|fends in one point is guilty of all,</HI> Jam. 2.18. He might as well offend in another point: He offers indignity to the Power that made the whole law. Obedience in &s;ome things will not excu&s;e di&s;obedi|ence in others. Exod. 24.7. <HI>All that the Lord our God &s;hall &s;ay to us, we will do and be obedient.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IN order to this we mu&s;t <HI>&s;eek for them all.</HI> Keep and <HI>&s;eek</HI> for all the Commandments of the Lord your God. We mu&s;t be careful &amp; inqui|&s;itive to <HI>know</HI> the Commands, if ever we would keep them. We mu&s;t &s;eek the knowledge of them with de&s;ire and care and pains. We need not &s;eek <HI>jar</HI> for the Commands; which we have in our hands and before our eyes: Deut. 30.11, 12. <HI>This Commandment which I command thee this day is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off: but the word is very nigh to thee, in thy Mouth and in thy heart; that thou may&s;t do it.</HI> Yet neither mu&s;t we grudge

any <HI>pains</HI> or labour that is nece&s;&s;ary unto our get|ting the knowledge of God's will. It is highly worth the mo&s;t diligent &amp; laborious &s;eeking.

<P N="4">4.

<P>BUT this for the 1&s;t thing; that this is the <HI>Charge of the Lord our God</HI> that we keep his laws.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>ALL the people</HI> of God together, and every <HI>&s;ingle per&s;on</HI> by him&s;elf, are under this charge of God. So is the text directed, and &s;o are all the Commandments of the Holy Word.</P>

<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Rulers</HI> of a people are in a particular and peculiar manner, under this Charge of God to keep and &s;eek for all his Commandments. To them <HI>David</HI> &s;peaks in the text, and by them to all <HI>I&s;rael</HI>: And unto them <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> deliver'd the Charge and Covenant of God, that they &s;hould &s;ee it kept by all under them.

<P>HOW much more then are all <HI>Mini&s;ters of State, Governours, Judges &amp; Officers</HI> commi&s;&s;ioned by the King, under the Law and Charge of God; to ob&s;erve his Word them&s;elves, and &s;ee it reverenc'd and ob&s;erv'd by tho&s;e that are under them.

<P>BUT as a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Subjection and Obedience to all the Commandments of God is the duty of <HI>Rulers,</HI> &s;o are they obliged al&s;o, both in their <HI>Le|gi&s;lative,</HI> and al&s;o in their <HI>Executive</HI> capacity and tru&s;t <HI>to &s;eek for</HI> all the Commandments of the Lord; That they be all of them made <HI>known</HI> to the people under their care, and <HI>enjoyned</HI> on them, and that none be &s;uffer'd in the Violation of any of them This is the Duty of their place, and they &s;hould voluntarily but with Solemnity come under <HI>this Bond</HI> upon their Souls; as the Rulers of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did, Neh. 9. <HI>ult.

<P>SO <HI>David died,</HI> and the&s;e were his <HI>lu&s;t Words,</HI> who was <HI>the Anointed of the God of Jacob,</HI> and the <HI>&s;weet P&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mi&s;t of I&s;rael!</HI> The <HI>Spirit of God</HI> &s;pake by Him, and the <HI>Word of the LORD</HI> was in his tongue; and He expir'd &s;peaking the Words which <HI>I&s;raels Rock</HI> and GOD had &s;poke to him.

<P>I go on to the third <HI>Doctrinal Ob&s;ervation.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>THAT we ought every one of us &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider; that it is in the &s;ight of all the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s people, and in the Audience of our God that we are &s;o charged, taught and warned, to keep &amp; &s;eek for all his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are <HI>two</HI> weighty Motives and power|ful Arguments to quicken and excite us unto the di&s;charge of the duty incumbent on us.

<P N="1">1. <HI>IN the &s;ight of all the Lord's people</HI> we are &s;o bound, are &s;o charged and have &s;o promi&s;ed. All the people of God are witne&s;&s;es for and again&s;t one another, that <HI>this charge of the Lord</HI> is laid and lying upon every <HI>Order,</HI> and upon every <HI>Per&s;on</HI> among us. So <HI>Magi&s;trates are Sworn,</HI> in the &s;ight of all the Lords people, even as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> gave <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> a charge before <HI>all I&s;rael,</HI> when he was plac'd at the head of the Congregation of the Lord: <HI>Numb.</HI>

Be&s;ides the pre&s;ent <HI>Injury</HI> to the world from us, the <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> will be to our &s;elves &amp; ours in the <HI>Day of Judgment.</HI> We &s;hall be found as guilty in that day, as if we had literally built <HI>the High places of Tophet, in the vally of the &s;on of Hinnon, to burn our &s;ons and daughters in the fire,</HI> Jer. 7.31. We &s;hall ly open to that dreadful <HI>Charge,</HI> Ezek. 16.20, 21. <HI>Thou ha&s;t taken thy &s;ons and thy daughters which thou ha&s;t born unto me, and the&s;e ha&s;t thou &s;acrificed to be devoured: Is this of thy Whoredoms a &s;mall mat|ter? that thou ha&s;t &s;lain my Children</HI> &mdash; I leave it to your <HI>Bowels</HI> to make an&s;wer unto &s;uch a Challenge.</P>
<P>MIND how <HI>Ezra</HI>'s love to God wro't? and the love of the <HI>pious Jews</HI> with him to their Po&s;|terity; Ezra 8.21. <HI>Then I proclaimed a Fa&s;t to afflict our &s;elves before our God, and to &s;eek of him a right Way for us &amp; for our little ones: So we fa&s;ted &amp; be&s;ought our God for this, and he was entreated of us.</HI> This was as tho&s;e that lov'd God and their Country, de&s;irous that their Children &s;hould be happy in the knowledge of God and of his wayes. God <HI>&s;eeks this godly &s;eed</HI> too and their <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI>: Deut. 5.29. <HI>O that there were &s;uch an heart in them, that they would fear me and keep my Commandments always; that it might be well with them and with their Children for ever.</HI></P>
