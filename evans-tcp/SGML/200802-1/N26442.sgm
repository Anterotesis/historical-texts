<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the latter part of April la&s;t, I called on the Mayor of this city, and communicated to him a circum&s;tance which I believed to be a very intere&s;ting one to the future health of the inhabitants of White-Hall and its environs, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That in filling up the wharf at the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;lip, they had already buried two dead hor&s;es, and at that period they were covering a third. Be&s;ides this, there were &s;everal hundred loads of &s;treet-dung, &s;pread on the unfini&s;hed wharf: and that the place was in &s;uch a &s;tate of nui&s;|ance, that it eminently threatened the &s;afety of the inhabitants. The Mayor replied, That he would have the nece&s;&s;ary enquiries made. On the &s;ame day, I made a &s;imilar communication to Alderman Fur|man, and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, that the Act for prevent|ing nui&s;ances &s;hould be attended to.</P>
<P>THE fact is, Sir, that part of White-Hall to the ea&s;t of the &s;lip, is in a mo&s;t offen&s;ive condition.</P>
<P>THE crew of the &s;hip Antoniette, from Copenha|gen, which lies adjoining the nui&s;ance above alluded to, and who cannot come on &s;hore, or return on board, without cro&s;&s;ing over the above ground, has &s;ickened &s;ucce&s;&s;ively almo&s;t to a man. They have been &s;ent to Bellevue, recovered, and on their re|turn, have &s;ickened again. The day before ye&s;terday a man was &s;ent to the Ho&s;pital&mdash;ye&s;terday another&mdash;and this day two more have &s;ickened; and I have no doubt
<PB N="6" REF="035161_0004_1000B015DE2698F0">
but their complaints are in con&s;equence of exhala|tions, ari&s;ing from the wharf.</P>
<P>THERE are a number of people &s;ickening in the neighbourhood of White-Hall, and the alarm it has created, is too well founded. Nothing &s;hort of the removal of a quantity of &s;treet manure, and other offen&s;ive matter, which now lies on the wharf, and the wharf being covered over with clean graver, earth or &s;and, intermixed with a quantity of lime, can po&s;&s;ibly prevent the calamity which has already taken place, from extending its influence.</P>

<P>A REPORT prevails in the country, that the &s;ame Fever which proved fatal to &s;o many of the inhabitants of New-York the la&s;t fall, has again made its appearance, and that the city, in con&s;equence of it, has become very &s;ickly. The di&s;agreeable im|pre&s;&s;ion excited in the minds of the people by &s;uch a rumour, is, perhaps, increa&s;ed by &s;everal para|graphs to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which I am informed have appeared in the Philadelphia papers. In order, therefore, that I may be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, enabled to &s;ilence the fears of my friends, and to afford them the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory information upon a &s;ubject &s;o important, I &s;hall e&s;teem it a favor if you will com|municate

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is true that a Fever re&s;embling the one which proved &s;o great a &s;courge to our city la&s;t year, made its appearance again about White-Hall, and in the vicinity of the Exchange, about the mid|dle of July; but I have &s;olid rea&s;ons for believing that this complaint will not be extended beyond cer|tain limits. You may recollect, that in the frequent conver&s;ations we have had together, on the &s;ubject of the la&s;t year's Fever, I have been uniform in my opi|nion as to the cau&s;e of its production, namely<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;entiment <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the notice of the ingenious Dr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> who put the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;truct<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in New-York, was attributed, by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Phy&s;ician<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>, <HI>the accumulation of every &s;pecies of filth and peri&s;hable mat|ter, on the low <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ade grounds, on the &s;outh &s;ide of the city, and the abominable cu&s;tom of filling up &s;lips and docks with &s;imilar materials.</HI> I have &s;aid that thes;e cau&s;es, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by a moi&s;t atmo&s;phere and hot &s;un, could not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of producing the mo&s;t baneful exhala|tions,

and that their effects mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be felt by tho&s;e who were more immediately expo&s;ed to their influence.</P>
<P>THE proprietors of the lots on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of White Hall &s;lip, carried out a bulk head the la&s;t &s;pring, with a view to extend the dock further into the river. The dimen&s;ions of the dock are very con&s;i|derable, and a maxim invariably adopted by the pro|prietors of docks, is, that <HI>the cheape&s;t mode of filling is the be&s;t.</HI> Accordingly, carts were employed to collect &s;uch dirt and filth as all large, populous cities furni&s;h in abundance, and with tho&s;e materials was the dock filled up; and to add to the <HI>&s;alubrity</HI> of the ma&s;s, there was occa&s;ionally added, dead hor&s;es, dogs, cats, hogs, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE expo&s;ure of White Hall, and indeed the whole of the We&s;t end of the city of New-York, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as extremely healthy. The winds during the warm &s;ea&s;on, are generally from the Sea, and ar|rive to this part of the town uncontaminated, by pa&s;&s;ing over unwhole&s;ome grounds. Yet &s;uch is the fact, that the poi&s;onous exhalations which have abounded in that quarter during the warm weather, have &s;o changed the air, that the inhabitants on the South &s;ide of Pearl-&s;treet, between Old-&s;lip and White-Hall, almo&s;t all concur in their te&s;timony, that the di&s;agree|able effluvia has frequently compelled them to clo&s;e their windows, e&s;pecially in the evening, on the South &s;ide of their hou&s;es; and, in &s;everal in&s;tances, have a&s;&s;ured me, that the offen&s;ive &s;mells have been &s;uch, as to occa&s;ion vomiting.</P>
<P>THE dock on which Mr. Delafield's &s;tores are erected, is in a &s;tate truly execrable, and the &s;lip on the right and on the left is little better. The&s;e, and &s;uch places, are vi&s;ited by the Dock-Fever&mdash;the Yel|low-Fever, if you plea&s;e, that murderer of our own creating.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="035161_0007_1000B05555F2D1F8">
WERE the proprietors of the&s;e and &s;uch like docks, compelled to live on them, the evil would &s;oon be re|medied; but people of this de&s;cription are generally &s;ecure from the ravages of di&s;ea&s;e, enjoying the bene|fit of their rents in the cooler retirements of the country.</P>
<P>BUT, fortunately for us, from a concurrence of happy events, the dock-fever has entirely di&s;appeared. It has continued for a &s;hort time only, when a gra|cious Providence &s;ent us hard winds, repeated thunder and lightning, inundations of rain, and cool weather. To cau&s;es of this kind are we to a&s;cribe the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of a formidable di&s;ea&s;e, which had begun to &s;hew it|&s;elf among us.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent exertions of our Common Council, in giving a new &s;urface of whole&s;ome earth to the dock of White Hall, will, without doubt, contribute to the &s;ame &s;alutary effects; and, if the &s;ame mea&s;ures were extended to other parts of the town, there would be much le&s;s rea&s;on to apprehend a return of the Dock-Fever.</P>
<P>THUS, Sir, your que&s;tions are an&s;wered. You might have come to town with &s;afety.&mdash;You <HI>may</HI> come to town with &s;afety; but I would advi&s;e you and all your country brethren, not to re&s;ide or &s;leep in the neighbourhood of filthy docks. New-York, as I have &s;aid before, may be rendered as healthy a city as any under the &s;un; and when its baneful police is chang|ed, and the nui&s;ances with which the city abounds are corrected, you will hear no more of the ravages of par|ticular di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED a letter from you, da|ted November 26, expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h that I would fur|ni&s;h the Commi&s;&s;ioners of health, with &s;uch ob&s;erva|tions as had occurred to me during the la&s;t &s;ummer and autumn, relative to the cau&s;es or origin of the di&s;ea&s;e, which occa&s;ioned &s;o much alarm in this city, and which proved fatal to &s;o many of its inhabitants; and that the&s;e ob&s;ervations might be accompanied with &s;uch reflections as I might deem proper relative to
<PB N="11" REF="035161_0009_1000B0B6D331E120">
nui&s;ances, for the removal of which a law was pa&s;&s;|ed by the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate, on the fir&s;t of April, 1796.</P>
<P>As it regards the fir&s;t reque&s;t, I had fortunately made &s;ome progre&s;s in &s;tating the principal facts, at the period of receiving your letter, which I have &s;ince completed, and which marked No. 1, is &s;ub|mitted to the peru&s;al of the Commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>I SHALL endeavour to perform the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned me, by making &s;uch reflections on the &s;ubject of nui&s;ances, as circum&s;tances may have given ri&s;e to.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ummer and autumn of 1795, a di&s;ea&s;e pre|vailed in this city, denominated from its nature and violence, the Yellow-Fever. The terror and di&s;may which it produced in all cla&s;&s;es of Citizens, may be ea&s;ily remembered; and the influence it had on the commerce of the city, and the number of lives it de&s;troyed, are circum&s;tances of too recent a date to be forgotten.</P>
<P>IN this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation, application was made to the Medical Society of the &s;tate of New-York, to favour the Public with its opinion of the nature of that di&s;ea&s;e. The Society accordingly addre&s;&s;ed a let|ter to the Magi&s;tracy upon the &s;ubject, (a copy of which is enclo&s;ed) containing remarks, among others, upon &s;uch nui&s;ances, as appeared at lea&s;t, to aggra|vate the then prevailing fever, and to render it more malignant and fatal; and to the influence of this letter, I pre&s;ume we are to a&s;cribe, principally, the act of the Legi&s;lature above alluded to, for the removal of the&s;e nui&s;ances. Why a law of &s;uch magnitude has not been carried into complete effect, is a matter of &s;urprize and regret among the citizens in general. A law was conceived to be nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;every hand was rai&s;ed for its enaction&mdash;and if, by the general expre&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="12" REF="035161_0010_1000B0BA97D3F5D8">
it was thought proper, it is much to be lament|ed that we have not experienced its &s;alutary operation. How far otherwi&s;e, indeed, has it been? The va&s;t ac|cumulation of peri&s;hable matter at White-Hall, after the pa&s;&s;ing of the law, affording effluvia of the mo&s;t noxious kind, and which from the cleare&s;t evi|dence, was the principal cau&s;e of the late &s;ickne&s;s in that quarter, is a lamentable in&s;tance of inattention to what was &s;o much the general wi&s;h!</P>
<P>THE law for the removal of nui&s;ances, pa&s;&s;ed the 1&s;t of April la&s;t, among many other things, re&s;pects, particularly, the manufactories of &s;oap, candles, vel|lum and &s;tarch. But, unfortunately, the&s;e very of|fen&s;ive repo&s;itories remain exactly where they were; and the annoyance which the neigbouring inhabitants have experienced from them, has been a &s;ubject of re|peated complaint. They have not only rendered the &s;ituations of many, extremely uncomfortable, but there is rea&s;on for apprehending wor&s;e con&s;equences, which the letter of Mr. Coles, accompanying the&s;e remarks, pretty clearly evinces.</P>
<P>IT has been urged that the removal of the above nui&s;ances, would be expen&s;ive to the citizens; but a con&s;ideration of this kind, is &s;urely not to be put in competition with our lives. I tru&s;t there are few in|deed who would not cheerfully contribute to the exe|cution of the law, both in letter and &s;pirit; and thus free a populous city of tho&s;e cau&s;es of mortality, which are of a nature extremely active, and certain in their effect; and which, if &s;uffered to remain, may bring thou&s;ands to their grave.</P>
<P>PERMIT me further to add, that the calamitous &s;itu|ation to which we have lately been twice reduced, ought to &s;timulate our endeavours, and excite us to vi|gilance and care. Timely precaution may prevent a return of Yellow Fever in this city, or perhaps one of
<PB N="13" REF="035161_0011_1000B03179F4A3B0">
a more pe&s;tilential kind: or, failing in that, it may alleviate their violence, and re&s;train their deva&s;ta|tions.</P>
<P>IT is true that di&s;ea&s;es &s;eldom become <HI>Epidemic,</HI> in|dependent of a certain &s;tate of the air. We have ex|perienced that &s;tate of the air and its effects, and we have no &s;ecurity again&s;t its returning even the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on&mdash;And I cannot but believe that every good citizen will con&s;ider the inconveniencies to which he may be expo&s;ed, by the operation of the law upon the &s;ubject, as in&s;eparable from the obligation and duty he owes to &s;ociety; and he who willingly &s;ubmits, may have this con&s;olatory reflexion, that his acquie&s;|cence may have been the means of &s;aving the lives of thou&s;ands, in guarding a populous city from the ex|treme mi&s;eries and fatality attending pe&s;tilential di&s;|ea&s;es.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude with ob&s;erving, that if my re|marks have extended beyond what was intended to be under&s;tood by your reque&s;t; or, if I have ventured further than I ought to have done, I hope that my anxiety to pre&s;erve the reputation of the city, and to promote the welfare and comfort of my fellow-citizens, will plead my apology.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<P>BEFORE I undertake to account for the origin of the Fever, which made its appearance in this city in June la&s;t, I mu&s;t be permitted to revert to certain facts and opinions contained in a work which I fur|ni&s;hed to the public on the &s;ubject of a &s;imilar Fever, which prevailed more generally in this city, during part of the Summer and Autumn of 1795.</P>
<P>IN that publication it was &s;tated, that the Fever was fir&s;t ob&s;erved in the neighbourhood of Fitch's wharf, in Water-&s;treet, and that it gradually extended from thence, in different ways, but more particularly in the direction of the prevailing winds.</P>
<P>NEAR where the Fever fir&s;t began, there were &s;e|veral unfini&s;hed docks, which had been receptacles, for &s;everal years, of every kind of filth and dirt.&mdash;There was al&s;o, a con&s;iderable &s;urface of new made ground in the neighbourhood, in a very unfini&s;hed &s;tate, upon which, dirt collected from the &s;treets, was frequently thrown: likewi&s;e, &s;everal &s;torehou&s;es, erected on piles: and, added to the&s;e, a neglected and filthy &s;tate of the wharves. This repre&s;entation, as it regards the then condition of the docks in that part of the town, is confirmed by the letter of Mr. Fitch, an extract of which is given in the publication above alluded to, and which, as it is much to our purpo&s;e, I &s;hall again introduce. His words are, "Although the docks in the vicinity of the &s;tore which I occupy, may be le&s;s offen&s;ive than in many other parts of the city, yet, many of them are in a very exceptionable &s;ituation. The ponding of water, by running a bulk head acro&s;s an unfini&s;hed dock, and
<PB N="15" REF="035161_0013_1000B0BEB87C3868">
leaving the vacancy for &s;everal years to be filled up with every &s;pecies of filth and peri&s;hable matter, is an object worthy the attention of the Police. The &s;itu|ation of the grounds between Water-&s;treet and Cherry &s;treet, is rendered very noxious, by Water-&s;treet be|ing rai&s;ed above a certain level, and thus preventing tho&s;e grounds from being drained. The effect of &s;uch nui&s;ances on the health of the inhabitants, in a crouded part of the city, cannot be imaginary."</P>
<P>THOSE who have peru&s;ed that publication, will find a number of rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned, why the inhabi|tants of the &s;outh ea&s;t part of the city, would be par|ticularly liable to Fever during the hot months. This opinion was warranted, in the fir&s;t place, from mat|ter of fact, as the Bilious Fever had appeared in that quarter for &s;everal years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and, in the &s;e|cond place, as a matter of rea&s;oning, from the rela|tive &s;ituation and expo&s;ure of that part of the city.&mdash;But fortunately the &s;outh ea&s;t part of the city has been more healthy this year, than for &s;everal years pa&s;t; and the cau&s;es of Fever &s;eem to have been transferred to a part of the town, hitherto reputed little liable to any particular &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN inve&s;tigating the cau&s;es of this change, a recour&s;e to facts only, will afford a &s;ufficient explanation.&mdash;</P>
<P>FIRST. THE docks &s;poken of, in the &s;outh-ea&s;tern part of the city, which were in &s;o loath&s;ome a &s;tate, have been completed and generally covered with a &s;ufficient quantity of good earth, gravel or &s;and. The grounds have been drained, or, where that was not practicable, the &s;urface has been rendered uniform with clean earth. The vacancies under the &s;tores which were built on piles, have been filled up in a proper manner, and the wharves have been kept free from rubbi&s;h and filth. In &s;hort, &s;o much care and indu&s;try have been be&s;towed here, to remove the nui&s;ances that &s;o generally abounded, that, where a per&s;on was
<PB N="16" REF="035161_0014_1000B0360BCB0EE8">
before almo&s;t &s;uffocated with intolerable &s;tenches, one may now pa&s;s without experiencing the lea&s;t offen&s;ive &s;mell.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. LET us &s;ee what has happened at the &s;outh-we&s;t part of the town. Between the Whitehall and Exchange-&s;lip, a new dock has been made, run|ning on an average 60 feet into the river, extending 458 feet in front, and 9 feet in depth. If 9 &s;quare feet are calculated to be equal to a cart load, it will be found that 24,000 cart loads were nece&s;&s;ary to fill up the dock, which were accumulating from July 1795 to July 1796. And what has been the nature of the materials em|ployed for this purpo&s;e? It is difficult to an&s;wer the que&s;tion, except in very general terms, namely, every thing &s;ubject to decay and corruption. One third of the &s;ub&s;tance of this dock may be computed to be lodged above the ordinary height of the tides&mdash;there|fore 8000 loads of the&s;e peri&s;hable materials were ex|po&s;ed to the action of the hot &s;ummer &s;un. In the month of April of this year, I had frequent occa&s;ion to vi&s;it White-hall:&mdash;The &s;tench which already i&s;&s;ued from the dock, was highly offen&s;ive; and on enquir|ing, I found that the matter which had been employ|ed to make the new ground, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of the dirt which had been accumulating in the &s;treets during the winter &s;ea&s;on; and that, be&s;ides dogs, cats, hogs, &amp;c. there had been actually two hor&s;es buried in the rubbi&s;h, which had died in the &s;pring, in a &s;mall hovel, erected on the margin of this nui&s;ance.</P>
<P>REFLECTING on this &s;tate of things at White-hall, and recollecting what had happened in another part of the city under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, I found my mind &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the probable con&s;equences;&mdash;and was led from thence to conver&s;e with &s;everal in|dividuals of the corporation on the &s;ubject. But no|thing material could be done to guard again&s;t the &s;up|po&s;ed

probable mi&s;chiefs. There was a contract<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The above declaration will be found explanatory of mo&s;t of the evils which this city <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> experienced from that period to the pre&s;ent, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>&mdash;the interference of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> protracting from year to year, tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> which the welfare of this city <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> be|tween the proprietors of the ground and other indi|viduals, for filling in that dock, with which the magi&s;|tracy did not think them&s;elves authorized to interfere, unle&s;s it was declared to be a nui&s;ance on oath, or by pre&s;entment of the Grand Jury. About the middle of June, the offen&s;ive &s;mells ari&s;ing from the new dock and other nui&s;ances in the neigbourhood, were very generally ob&s;erved in that quarter of the city, and their effects were manife&s;t in many who complained of head-achs, &s;ick &s;tomachs, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of the Exchange &s;lip, as a &s;ource of noxious exhalations I feel my&s;elf obliged to notice al&s;o particularly. This &s;lip from its length and narrow|ne&s;s&mdash;from its being the receptacle of an exten&s;ive common &s;ewer;&mdash;and, e&s;pecially from having a great proportion of its muddy bottom expo&s;ed at low water, &s;ends forth effluvia, which, in a very &s;en&s;ible manner, contaminates the air to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance around.</P>
<P>IN a letter publi&s;hed in July la&s;t, I had occa&s;ion to mention the frequent di&s;agreeable &s;tate of the air in the &s;outh-we&s;t part of the city. It was there &s;tated, "that the poi&s;onous exhalations which had abounded in that quarter during the warm weather, had rendered the air &s;o noxious, that the inhabitants on the &s;outh-&s;ide of Pearl-&s;treet, between the Old-&s;lip and White-hall, almo&s;t all concur in their te&s;timony that the di&s;agreea|ble effluvia have frequently obliged them, e&s;pecially in the evening, to clo&s;e their windows on the &s;outh-&s;ide of their hou&s;es; and in &s;everal in&s;tances gentlemen have a&s;&s;ured us, that the offen&s;ive &s;mell has been &s;uch, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to occa&s;ion vomiting." The&s;e are circum&s;tances of great moment and are entitled to &s;erious con&s;iderati|on,
<PB N="18" REF="035161_0016_1000C2C4193D0F40">
if they are regarded only as cau&s;es which increa&s;e the malignity of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>IN the latter part of June, the fever began to &s;hew it&s;elf about White-hall, and in the vicinity of the Ex|change; but it continued for a &s;hort time only, when the concurrence of high winds, heavy rains, much thunder and lightening, and cool weather, which hap|pened about the middle of July, were probably the cau&s;es to which we may attribute the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e. This, at lea&s;t, was rendered probable, be|cau&s;e as &s;oon as the weather became warm and dry again, it was accompanied by tho&s;e noxious exhalati|ons which again produce the fever. Thus the di&s;ea&s;e appeared, went off, and came on again, according as the weather favored or impeded the generation of tho&s;e vapors, which, in their operation on the human body, are the exciting cau&s;e of fever.</P>
<P>I MUST take notice of &s;ome other circum&s;tances re|lative to many of the hou&s;es about White-hall, which, if they were not of them&s;elves, in any in&s;tance a cau&s;e of Fever, mu&s;t certainly be con&s;idered of a nature to aggravate the di&s;ea&s;e, when brought on by other cau&s;es&mdash;namely, the &s;tate of the ground in the rear of the hou&s;es, which, in con&s;equence of the &s;treets being rai&s;|ed, is, in many places con&s;iderably below the ordina|ry level, and therefore liable to accumulate matters which render the air impure, and which, in confined &s;ituations, are often the cau&s;e of Fevers.&mdash;Al&s;o, the old and decayed &s;tate of many of the hou&s;es, and the inattention to cleanline&s;s, which is always neglected, where people of the poorer &s;ort are much crouded toge|ther. The bedding and clothes of the &s;ick under the&s;e circum&s;tances, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to become more and more impregnated with the exhalations ari&s;ing from their bodies; and hence the dreadful havock made by infectious di&s;ea&s;es in the &s;mall hou&s;es of the poor, and on &s;uch as are de&s;titute of the means of cleanline&s;s,
<PB N="19" REF="035161_0017_1000B03AE40B2088">
and who, of nece&s;&s;ity, are obliged to remain a length of time without changing their clothes.</P>
<P>THE further we enquire into the &s;ources of the Fever, the greater is the analogy di&s;covered to be, between the &s;tate of things at White Hall, and in that part of the city where the Fever fir&s;t appeared la&s;t year. Accumulations of decaying animal and vegetable matters&mdash;a part of the ground below the general level&mdash;poor people crouded together in &s;mall uncleanly apartments, were circum&s;tances &s;o per|fectly coincident, that were particular effects to take place in one &s;ituation, we &s;hould naturally expect &s;imi|lar effects to take place in the other. If the Fever of la&s;t year, and that of the pre&s;ent year, were brought on by the &s;ame cau&s;es, it may po&s;&s;ibly be a&s;ked, how it happened, that in the one in&s;tance, it was &s;o widely extended, and in the other confined to &s;uch narrow limits? This que&s;tion admits of an ea&s;y &s;olution. It is generally acknowledged, that Epidemic di&s;ea&s;es are either produced or widely diffu&s;ed, by &s;ome par|ticular qualities of the atmo&s;phere; and the extraor|dinary prevalence of heat and moi&s;ture in the air, du|ring the Summer and Autumn of la&s;t year, mu&s;t &s;till be recent in the memory of the inhabitants of this ci|ty, while the &s;tate of the air, during the warm &s;ea&s;on of the pre&s;ent year, has been much cooler and drier than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>THUS, the Fever of the la&s;t year was more gene|rally felt, becau&s;e a peculiarity of the weather predi&s;|po&s;ed the body, or rendered it more &s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e cau&s;es which produced the di&s;ea&s;e: whereas, the weather of this year, occa&s;ioning no predi&s;po&s;ition, the Fever was generally confined to a &s;ituation, where it required the exciting cau&s;e to be it&s;elf &s;ufficiently concentrated to produce its effects.</P>
<P>MANY of the men who belonged to the market ve&s;&s;els which came to the white-Hall dock, &s;ickened
<PB N="20" REF="035161_0018_1000C2C6D71B3110">
from being expo&s;ed to the exhalations ari&s;ing in this &s;ituation. The boatmen of the Staten-I&s;land and Elizabeth-town Ferry-boats, &s;uffered very generally, although many of them were &s;o cautious as not to &s;leep on &s;hore, and to avoid all communication with the &s;ick. Several of them died of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>MANY tran&s;ient per&s;ons from Staten-I&s;land, who frequently vi&s;ited at Mr. Cortelyou's, re&s;iding at White-Hall, during their &s;tay in New-York, &s;icken|ed, and &s;ome died. It was &s;aid that Mr. Cortelyou's family were &s;ick with the Yellow-Fever, but this re|port was not well founded. The family were not well during any part of the warm weather, but none of them had the Bilious Fever. Their complaints were &s;uch as are commonly the con&s;equence of living in foul air, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>&mdash;&s;ick &s;tomachs and head-ach<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, attended with con&s;iderable la&s;&s;itude.</P>
<P>THE above facts re&s;pecting tran&s;ient per&s;ons taking the Fever, are confirmed by Dr. Clarke, of Elizabeth-town, New-Jer&s;ey, who, in a letter with which he has favoured me, ob&s;erves, "There were many in|&s;tances of this di&s;ea&s;e among the ferrymen, who re&s;id|ed chi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> of their time at White-Hall; and other per|&s;ons who &s;lept there, &s;ickened, and all had taken their pa&s;&s;age from White Hall dock within twelve days of the attack."</P>
<P>IT is worthy of remark al&s;o, that the di&s;ea&s;e, ac|cording to Dr. Clarke, occurred in tho&s;e only, who had been in New-York.</P>
<P>HE writes that, "Among&s;t the ca&s;es which came within my practice, and from the be&s;t information of others, there was no in&s;tance of the di&s;ea&s;e taking place in any except <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> who had been at New-York, and particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> White-Hall."</P>
<P>DR. CLARKE &s;tates further, "That there was no
<PB N="21" REF="035161_0019_1000B04291685C20">
in&s;tance of the Fever among&s;t the nur&s;es, or attend|ants upon the &s;ick." This fact is confirmative of the opinion which we have always endeavoured to &s;upport that the Fever in que&s;tion, is not a contagious di&s;ea&s;e. The operation of local cau&s;es in producing di&s;ea&s;es, is well exemplified in the account of the Remitting and Intermitting Fevers of the We&s;t-Indies, given us by Dr. Hume:&mdash;"And while," &s;ays he, "The Ho&s;pital remained there (at Port Royal) the &s;ick were &s;eldom &s;eized with complaints of this kind."</P>
<P>"WHEN another Ho&s;pital was built on the oppo|&s;ite &s;ide, though only at the di&s;tance of four miles, not one man in a hundred, e&s;caped the&s;e Fevers, who were &s;ent to the Ho&s;pital and remained in it three or four weeks;&mdash;and even the marine guard, who were relieved once a fortnight or three weeks, fared no better."</P>
<P>Dr. HUME de&s;cribes the &s;ituation of this Ho&s;pital, to be in the neighbourhood of &s;tagnant water mar&s;hes. He then adds, "It was the damp winds filled with the putrid exhalations, which occa&s;ioned the frequen|cy of remitting or Yellow-Fever, and intermitting di&s;|orders of this place. At my reque&s;t this ho&s;pital was de&s;erted, although in all other re&s;pects it was good, and had co&s;t near fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.&mdash;Several plantations near this ho&s;pital, were unhealthy from the &s;ame cau&s;es."</P>
<P>IT would be endle&s;s to quote authorities upon this &s;ubject, nor is it nece&s;&s;ary to look to a di&s;tance for them. What has happened within our own &s;tate, abundantly confirms the fact, as may be &s;een from Dr. William's letter, in&s;erted in my publication upon the Fever of la&s;t year. I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to be more particular in reciting facts, or in detailing tho&s;e circum&s;tances which, in my mind, are fully compe|tent to explain the origin of the Fever which has ex|cited &s;o much alarm, and proved &s;o great a &s;courge
<PB N="22" REF="035161_0020_1000C2C951947D00">
to the citizens of New-York. It is the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e I mean to &s;hew, by the following documents, that the di&s;ea&s;e was not, as many have in&s;inuated, nay po&s;itively declared, brought here from abroad: and if we can advance &s;ufficient te&s;timony to invalidate that opinion, the conclu&s;ion nece&s;&s;arily follows, that the Fever was occa&s;ioned by cau&s;es of a dome&s;tic na|ture; and therefore, the fact we are &s;olicitous to e&s;|tabli&s;h, receives that degree of probability, which, in matters of this kind, give an a&s;&s;urance, equal to de|mon&s;tration.</P>
<P>I SHALL, then, in the next plaae, bring forward what appertains to the ve&s;&s;els &s;uppo&s;ed to have intro|duced the Yellow-Fever into New-York.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected ve&s;&s;el was the &s;hip Antoniette.</P>
<P>ON the 25th of May, the &s;hip Antoniette arrived in this harbor from Bre&s;t, in balla&s;t, and anchored in the North-River. Two days after her arrival, I was reque&s;ted to vi&s;it &s;ick on board. The Command|er of the ve&s;&s;el a&s;&s;ured me that the men had not been confined, nor did he think their indi&s;po&s;ition &s;uch as to render it nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be &s;ent to the Ho&s;pi|tal. One of the men was then at work on deck, and the other came from below immediately on being call|ed. As, however, the &s;hip was to be brought to a dock, it was thought expedient that the&s;e men &s;hould be &s;ent to the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>THAT they had not complaints of an infectious nature, &s;hall not re&s;t on my a&s;&s;ertion alone. The opinion and declaration of Dr. M'Farlin, under who&s;e care they were placed, will carry with them much &s;tronger evidence.</P>

<P>On the 29th of May, the Antoniette hauled to the dock at White Hall. In this &s;ituation, the crew could not come on &s;hore, nor return on board, without pa&s;&s;ing over the new made grounds; and thus were the men expo&s;ed to the exhalations which aro&s;e from it whil&s;t in the &s;hip, and occa&s;ionally, in a greater de|gree, by their vi&s;its on &s;hore. During the month of June, mo&s;t of the men of the Antoniette, complained of an unu&s;ual weakne&s;s, and in the beginning of July, &s;everal of them were attacked with the Fever.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e ca&s;es terminated in black vomit and death. The cau&s;es of the &s;ickne&s;s on board the Antoi|nette,
<PB N="24" REF="035161_0022_1000C2CEC7588DE0">
being no longer a &s;ubject of conjecture, the remedy became obvious&mdash;namely, the removal of the ve&s;&s;el to a more healthy &s;ituation; and as the &s;hip had lain more than a month at White Hall dock, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that the air beneath her decks had become completely &s;aturated with the noxious vapours ari&s;ing from that ma&s;s of decaying materials, of which the dock was compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT was deemed nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to have recour&s;e to the mea&s;ures commonly employed to purify ve&s;&s;els. For this purpo&s;e, the Antoinette was hauled out into the &s;tream; and after the proce&s;s of purification was over, &s;he was directed into the North river to take in her cargo. After this period, the men on board her remained in good health, except Captain Hendricks, who had the ague and fever.</P>
<P>Now, as the men who were complaining at the time of the arrival of the Antoniette, were not &s;ick with fever (of which Dr. M'Farlin's letter is &s;uffici|ent evidene) and as the Fever did not appear among the crew, until five weeks after &s;he had been at the White Hall dock, and more than ten days after it had appeared on &s;hore, it mu&s;t require a more than ordi|nary &s;hare of pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in any one, to believe that the Antoinette had any agency in the origin of the Fever at White Hall.</P>
<P>ON the 29th of July, the brig Patty arrived in this port. After her departure, a report was circulated, and by many credited, that &s;he had introduced a Ma|lignant Fever into this city. Although on this &s;ubject I had no doubt, as I had taken a manife&s;t of the healthful &s;ituation of the brig Patty, and the crew had undergone my per&s;onal examination, yet I was anxious that every &s;u&s;picion &s;hould, as far as po&s;&s;ible, be removed from the minds of the citizens. I was therefore induced to write to the commander of the brig, who was then at Bo&s;ton, to reque&s;t he would
<PB N="25" REF="035161_0023_1000B047266F9598">

To the&s;e enquiries I &s;hortly after received the following atte&s;ted certificate:&mdash;</P>

<P>THIS is to certify, that during my voyage in the Brig Patty, from Bo&s;ton to the We&s;t-Indies, and back to New-York, none of my crew were &s;ick of a malignant Fever; and that at my arival in New-York, all my crew were in good health, except my Mate, who was &s;ick with the Ague and Fever, and who was taken out of my ve&s;&s;el and put on board a Packet to be &s;ent home to Trenton; and &s;ince my arrival in Bo&s;ton, my crew has remained in perfect health as before;&mdash;nor has any per&s;on who has been on board the brig Patty, re|ceived, or been apprehen&s;ive of any di&s;order whatever.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>THE above &s;tatement of Captain Snow, is &s;o clear and conclu&s;ive, that &s;till to entertain any doubt, would imply a mind di&s;po&s;ed to contemn truth, even under the &s;erious garb of a &s;acred oath!</P>
<P>THUS, then, I have taken a cur&s;ory view of the circum&s;tances relative to the origin of the Yellow-Fe|ver. In reviewing the &s;ituation of that part of the city, we have found abundant rea&s;on for believing the Fever was produced by cau&s;es of a local nature, and originating there. The importance of this fact ren|ders me extremely &s;olicitous that the truth of it &s;hould be generally e&s;tabli&s;hed, and &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on every mind: for, if mea&s;ures are to be pur&s;ued, cal|culated
<PB N="26" REF="035161_0024_1000B0252E25DBA8">
to prevent the calamity in future, the extent and adequacy of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, mu&s;t depend on this conviction.</P>
<P>IT is to be hoped, that we may not deceive our|&s;elves, by a mode of rea&s;oning adopted by &s;ome, which, however plau&s;ible it may appear at fir&s;t view, mu&s;t cer|tainly prove fallacious on examination.</P>
<P>IT is urged, that the city of New-York has re|mained, for many years, exempt from any particular|ly fatal di&s;ea&s;es; and we have no greater rea&s;on <HI>now,</HI> to &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves more liable to &s;ickne&s;s, than for|merly; and, that if di&s;ea&s;es of a malignant kind, &s;hould, at any time, prevail among us, we ought to look to &s;ome foreign &s;ource for their origin. The an&s;wer to this argument is, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of things is every day changing. This city is extending its dimen&s;ions&mdash;the hou&s;es are becoming more compact and crouded together&mdash;the inhabitants are encrea&s;ing in number&mdash;and, more e&s;pecially, the mode of making <HI>new ground,</HI> which renders a con&s;iderable part of the city a <HI>low level</HI>&mdash;are changes which place us in a &s;ituation different from that of any former period.</P>
<P>THIS kind of calculation, it is to be feared, is not by many entered into; but it is one which is entitled to &s;erious con&s;ideration, ina&s;much as it takes in tho&s;e circum&s;tances which have a particular influence upon the health of the inhabitants of the city of New-York.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, I mu&s;t take the liberty of men|tioning to your Excellency, what has hitherto been the condition of the Ho&s;pital lately erected on Bed|low's I&s;land. I am induced to do this, in order that the inconveniencies under which it has labored, may be rendered apparent; and from a hope that mea&s;ures will, in con&s;equence, be taken to provide for the
<PB N="27" REF="035161_0025_1000C2D3CE7435E8">
Ho&s;pital in &s;uch a manner as may be nece&s;&s;ary to com|plete the e&s;tabli&s;hment, and give it exten&s;ive utility.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ary alterations and repairs which the buildings on Bedlow's I&s;land required to render them &s;it to receive the &s;ick, were not completed till the middle of Augu&s;t. As &s;oon as the&s;e were done, ap|plication was made to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Health, for a &s;upply of nece&s;&s;aries to accommodate the &s;ick&mdash;who, at this period, were &s;ent to the Ho&s;pital from White-hall, and from &s;everal ve&s;&s;els ju&s;t arrived from &s;ea. The Commi&s;&s;ioners directed the beds and bedding which had been u&s;ed the year before at Bellevue, to be &s;ent to the new Ho&s;pital on Bedlow's I&s;land. Un|fortunately, the&s;e articles were in a very filthy &s;tate; but as the &s;ick were already at the Ho&s;pital, we had no alternative, but to &s;elect the cleane&s;t of tho&s;e arti|cles and u&s;e them in that &s;tate. The Ho&s;pital was al&s;o unprovided with wearing apparel, than which, nothing is more nece&s;&s;ary, as well for the comfort of the &s;ick, as to prevent the introduction of infection into the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e circum&s;tances, the con&s;equences were &s;uch as might naturally be expected; for, within eight days of the time in which the&s;e articles were brought to the Ho&s;pital, tho&s;e people who had been employed in tran&s;porting the bedding from Bellevue, the nur&s;es who attended the &s;ick, and the &s;teward of the hou&s;e, were attacked with fever. The attending Phy&s;ician, Mon&s;ieur Bouvier, was al&s;o indi&s;po&s;ed for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>FROM this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation, however, the Ho&s;|pital was &s;oon happily relieved, by a &s;upply of beds, bedding, and &s;uch clothes as were nece&s;&s;ary for fre|quent changes, and placing the &s;ick in a &s;tate of the greate&s;t cleanline&s;s. From this period, neither nur&s;e,

<HEAD>The following is a copy of the Letter alluded to in the Letter addre&s;&s;ed to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of Health.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>To the MAGISTRACY of NEW-YORK.
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would be improper, at lea&s;t foreign to the de&s;ign of this addre&s;s, to enter on the enquiry whether the late Epidemic which raged in this city, was imported, or generated among us. Our motive for addre&s;&s;ing you at this time, ari&s;es from a de&s;ire to engage, and at the &s;ame time to a&s;&s;i&s;t, as far as we are able, your re&s;pectable Board, in applying a cor|rective to &s;ome of tho&s;e cau&s;es, which, we conceive, &s;erved at once to extend its influence, and increa&s;e its malignity.</P>
<P>ON this head then, we venture to point out the following objects, as particularly demanding the notice of the Magi&s;trates, and the interpo&s;ition of their au|thority.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>the accumulation of filth in the &s;treets.</HI></P>
<P>THIS, being compo&s;ed chiefly of dead animal and vegetable matter, is, when expo&s;ed to a hot &s;un, a &s;ource of noxious effluvia, which have a tendency to
<PB N="29" REF="035161_0027_1000C2D6A731A548">
produce the mo&s;t fatal effects; and, that &s;uch efflu|via have been the cau&s;e of Fever, has been confirm|ed by repeated ob&s;ervation and experience in all parts of the world.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>Ob&s;tructed water-drains.</HI></P>
<P>THESE, by occa&s;ioning &s;tagnant waters, and col|lecting matter of various kinds, which, undergoing de-compo&s;ition, emit air of qualities extremely pre|judicial to health.</P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>The ground of certain parts of the city, where the lots of hou&s;es are con&s;iderably below the ordi|nary level of the &s;treets.</HI></P>
<P>IN &s;uch places, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences mu&s;t be an accumulation of various &s;ub&s;tances, which, under the influence of heat and moi&s;ture, putrify, and thus contaminate the atmo&s;phere, and commu|nicate properries to it, of a nature extremely delete|rious.</P>
<P>Fourthly. <HI>The &s;ituation of many of the Docks and Stores along the Ea&s;t-River.</HI></P>
<P>IT is to be ob&s;erved that in many places, large &s;urfaces of mud are expo&s;ed at low water, which throw up during the heat of the &s;ummer, an intoler|able &s;tench; and this evil is greatly increa&s;ed by a practice of filling in docks with every &s;pecies of filth collected from the &s;treets, which proves an unfailing &s;ource of unwhole&s;ome air. We remark, further, that a practice has been permitted in this city, which we conceive very reprehen&s;ible, and what, we have no doubt, has produced many in&s;tances of individual di&s;ea&s;e, if it has done nothing wor&s;e;&mdash;that is, the pernicious cu&s;tom of collecting and throwing into one heap, great quantities of manure (gathered from the &s;treet) on vacant lots. This was the ca&s;e (during the
<PB N="30" REF="035161_0028_1000C2D82FD96B90">
prevalence of the Fever) at the head of George-&s;treet.</P>
<P>To the cau&s;es above enumerated, &s;ome others might, with propriety, be added, as endangering, by their permi&s;&s;ion, the health of the citizens.&mdash;Among the&s;e la&s;t, are, Slaughter-Hou&s;es, Manufactories of Scap and Candles, Vellum, heather, Starch, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN laying this detail before you, we cannot con|clude without declaring, that in our opinions, the malignity and fatality of the late Epidemic Fever, were greatly influenced by the before mention cau|&s;es; and were it nece&s;&s;ary, we could &s;uperadd the authorities of the fir&s;t Phy&s;icians and Philo&s;ophers, as corroborative of our own.</P>
<P>WE, therefore, with confidence and re&s;pect, &s;ub|mit the above to your &s;erious con&s;ideration; and hope that their importance, as affecting the health and re|putation of the city, will receive, as undoubtedly they claim, your early and due attention.</P>

<SALUTE>May it plea&s;e the Governor,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Health-Office, having hitherto, as far as circum&s;tances would admit, fulfilled the de&s;ign of their appointment, conceive it proper, in the further di&s;charge of their duty, now at the clo&s;e of the year, to lay before the governor, an account of the manner in which they have executed their tru&s;t, of their expenditures therein, and, in ge|neral, of the &s;ituation of the public e&s;tabli&s;hment under their care; together with &s;uch ob&s;ervations as have occurred to them on the &s;ubject of pre&s;erving and promoting the health of the city, and rendering
<PB N="31" REF="035161_0029_1000C2DBDF488B80">
more efficacious the public provi&s;ion for that purpo&s;e, and for the reception and accommodation of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>THE Ho&s;pital at Bellevue, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Cor|poration of the city, had remained, &s;ince the pre|ceding year, furni&s;hed for the reception of the &s;ick, and offered, in the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on, a com|fortable a&s;ylum to tho&s;e who might arrive from &s;ea, until the e&s;tabli&s;hment under the authority of the &s;tate could be got ready. It was accordingly begun to be occupied for this purpo&s;e, in the month of June, from which time, to the 18th of Augu&s;t, the num|ber of &s;ick &s;ent thither, was chiefly from ve&s;&s;els arrived from &s;ea. In the mean time, the buildings on Bedlow's I&s;land, purcha&s;ed of the French, being given up by them, were clean&s;ed and made <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ea|day to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of a Lazaretto, and were furni&s;hed with beds, bedding, clothing, medicines, &amp;c. and provided with a Phy&s;ician, nur&s;es, and other ne|ce&s;&s;ary attendants, and to which the &s;ick at Bellevue, were removed about the 18th of Augu&s;t: And altho' from unfore&s;een or unavoidable circum&s;tances, the accommodations there, were not &s;o perfect as could have been de&s;ired, they were, by care and attention, rendered as comfortable and commodious as po&s;&s;ible, and the place was vi&s;ited by &s;ome of the Commi&s;&s;ion|ers as often as occa&s;ion required. The number of &s;ick thus received at the Lazaretto, from the 18th of Augu&s;t to the 1&s;t of September, (the late&s;t period at which any have been &s;ent there) including tho&s;e from Bellevue, was eighty-&s;even, of which &s;eventeen have died: The greater part of this number had arrived from &s;ea, and the remainder were inhabitants of the city, who could not find &s;uitable accommodations at home.</P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners, at the recommendation of the Health-Officer, appointed to attend the &s;ick as Phy|&s;ician, Doctor Bouvier, a gentleman who had acquired
<PB N="32" REF="035161_0030_1000B051B0BBFF78">
much reputation in a long re&s;idence and practice of Phy&s;ic, in the French We&s;t-Indies, and who hath ful|filled his duty with &s;ingular ability and attention, and with great &s;ucce&s;s; and although the allowance made him of four dollars a day, during his attendance, is per|haps more than their &s;canty funds would afford, it was, in their opinion, not adequate to his time and va|luable &s;ervices; and they therefore think it ju&s;t that he &s;hould receive &s;uch additional pay, as may be judg|ed to amount to a rea&s;onable compen&s;ation, and accord|ingly recommend him for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Malignant Fever of the la&s;t &s;ummer and au|tumn, though for a time very alarming, yet was hap|pily, in a great mea&s;ure, confined to a di&s;trict of &s;mall extent, and greatly limited in its effects, compared with that of the preceding year. It prevailed in the White-Hall and Moore &s;treets, and in Water and Front-&s;treets and the South &s;ide of Pearl-&s;treet, from the Exchange downwards, and in the lower part of Broad-&s;treet.&mdash;The re&s;t of the city was principally free from it, and in a healthy &s;tate; and the few per&s;ons who, in the other parts, were attacked with the Fever, could ge|nerally trace the origin of it to that infected quarter, or to <HI>local circum&s;tances,</HI> in their particular neighbour|hood. It appeared in two or three in&s;tances in the month of June, but did not cau&s;e alarm till about the middle of July, from which time to 1&s;t of November, the number attacked with it was about 247, of which there died 67; of this la&s;t number 7 or 8 died at Belle|vue, or Bedlow's I&s;land, and are included in the return of deaths from thence.</P>
<P>ON this occa&s;ion, attention was paid to the timely removal of &s;uch patients who&s;e circum&s;tances render|ed it nece&s;&s;ary for their better accommodation, and to every other point in which, in the opinion of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, they could contribute to the comfort and &s;afety of individuals; and as far as their powers ex|tended,
<PB N="33" REF="035161_0031_1000C2DE6CC2E0A8">
to the re&s;toring and pre&s;erving the health of the city.</P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners have found, that the facts &s;tat|ed in the repre&s;entation of the <HI>Health-Officer,</HI> on the &s;ubject of this &s;ickne&s;s, are ju&s;t; and it appears to them with &s;atisfactory clearne&s;s, that the filthy and corrupt &s;tate of &s;ome of the <HI>Docks and Slips</HI> in the neighbour|hood of the Exchange and White-hall, was the cau&s;e of the &s;ickne&s;s; and there is little rea&s;on to doubt, but that, if the &s;tate of the air in general, throughout the &s;ummer, had been favourable to the propagation of <HI>infection,</HI> it would have found, in various parts of the city, from <HI>filthy and noi&s;ome manufactories,</HI> neglected vacant lots covered with offen&s;ive matter, and dirty &s;treets and lanes, an abundant &s;upply of <HI>noxious efflu|via</HI> to increa&s;e and &s;pread its baneful influence; and that the city would, in all probability, have &s;uffered perhaps a more general and de&s;tructive calamity, than in the preceding year.</P>
<P>THIS impure &s;tate of things was obvious to all; and it was hoped that our late &s;evere experience would have &s;timulated to a complete reformation; and that aided by the law "to prevent the bringing in and &s;preading of infectious di&s;ea&s;es," an effectual exertion would have been made to <HI>remove all nui&s;ances,</HI> and place the city, in all re&s;pects, in a re&s;pectable and whole|&s;ome &s;tate. But the warm &s;ea&s;on arrived, and no mea&s;ures of this kind were taken. The Commi&s;&s;ion|ers pre&s;ented to the Corporation, a repre&s;entation of the &s;tate of the city, recommending a mode of clean|&s;ing and keeping the &s;treets, &amp;c. in good order, a copy of which was delivered to the Governor.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time, &s;everal of the mo&s;t offen&s;ive &s;lips and docks were clean&s;ed and filled up in a proper manner, and &s;ome new mode was adopted for clean|&s;ing the &s;treets, which, however, proved but <HI>partially</HI> efficacious, being, in the opinion of the Commi&s;&s;ioners,
<PB N="34" REF="035161_0032_1000C2E001D5BA00">
far &s;hort of that recommended by them. But none of the <HI>offen&s;ive manufactories</HI> were removed&mdash;they all &s;till remain&mdash;&s;everal of them in the mo&s;t populous parts of the city, and are mo&s;t <HI>dangerous and di&s;graceful</HI> nui|&s;ances; one of which appears from an affidavit of <HI>John Collis,</HI> referred to in a letter from the Health Officer to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, to have occa&s;ioned the <HI>&s;ickne&s;s</HI> of a whole <HI>family,</HI> and the death of one of its members. The continuance of this unhappy &s;tate of things, not|with&s;tanding the aid of the law, and the repre&s;entations on the &s;ubject, afford a <HI>gloomy pro&s;pect</HI> with regard to the future welfare of the city, e&s;pecially as there is no hope of engaging the Corporation in vigorous and ef|ficient mea&s;ures for a complete reformation. The Commi&s;&s;ioners are convinced that the principal mem|bers of that body, think ju&s;tly and independently on this &s;ubject, and have been zealous in their endeavours to effect a change, and that &s;everal others are di&s;po&s;ed to co-operate with them in the &s;alutary work; but a majority have not been found willing to engage in tho&s;e mea&s;ures, at the ri&s;k of offending many of their con&s;tituents, and the con&s;equent lo&s;s of their places; for, however obvious to all intelligent and liberal minds, is the nece&s;&s;ity of placing and pre&s;erving the city in the mo&s;t cleanly and whole&s;ome &s;tate, yet a con|&s;iderable number of the inhabitants are oppo&s;ed to any new and extraordinary mea&s;ures being taken for that purpo&s;e, from the contracted and erroneous con&s;ide|rations of encrea&s;ed expence, partial inconvenience, or innovation.</P>
<P>THE mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to place and pre&s;erve this city in a cleanly and whole&s;ome &s;tate, are not difficult to a&s;certain. They are&mdash;to fill up all the docks and &s;lips with clean earth, gravel, or &s;and, in &s;uch a man|ner as that the <HI>muddy bottoms &s;hall not be left bare at low water;</HI> and al&s;o to complete the filling up with the &s;ame materials, all the remaining vacancies under the &s;tores and about the wharves, and to prohibit the com|mon dirt of the &s;treet, or any filthy or corruptive mat|ter
<PB N="35" REF="035161_0033_1000B0538D0E0E68">
from being u&s;ed for this purpo&s;e, or thrown into them; to remove all &s;uch matters from the vacant lots or yards, in and about the town; and where &s;uch are &s;o &s;ituated as to receive the wa&s;h of the &s;treets, or ad|jacent grounds, or retain <HI>&s;tagnant water,</HI> that they be filled up with good earth, &amp;c. that the water may run from them into the &s;treets; to provide effectually for clean&s;ing all the &s;treets, lanes, wharves, &amp;c. at lea&s;t twice a week, and carrying the dirt and rubbi&s;h imme|diately to a &s;pot from whence it will be taken away in boats, without any delay, and to prohibit its being thrown el&s;ewhere, and al&s;o to prohibit any filthy or corruptive matter or rubbi&s;h, from being brought out of hou&s;es, cellars, or yards, into the &s;treets &amp;c. except at the time the per&s;ons appear who are employed to take them away; to complete the paving of all the &s;treets, lanes, &amp;c. and the entrances of the docks, wharves, and &s;lips; to provide that all the <HI>water drains</HI> be kept clean and free from ob&s;tructions, that no wa|ter may remain and <HI>&s;tagnate</HI> in them; and, to remove out of <HI>town,</HI> all manufactories which have a tendency to <HI>infect the air with noxious effluvia.</HI> The&s;e mea&s;ures, carried into full effect, with the nece&s;&s;ary regulations to prevent the introduction of di&s;ea&s;e from abroad, would, undoubtedly, pre&s;erve the city in as great a degree of healthine&s;s, as it enjoyed in former years.</P>
<P>AND for the attainment of this mo&s;t de&s;irable end, the Corporation appear to be ve&s;ted with &s;ufficient powers; but, unhappily, the capacity for accompli&s;h|ing &s;uch important good, is rendered abortive by the prevalence of an improper influence over the majority, as &s;tated above.</P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners are aware that this repre&s;enta|tion is made in <HI>plain and &s;trong terms;</HI> but as they are not only convinced of the truth of it, from their own ob&s;ervations, but al&s;o find them&s;elves ju&s;tified in it, from re&s;pectable authority, which cannot be doubted, they conceive that the importance of the &s;ubject re|quires,
<PB N="36" REF="035161_0034_1000C2E379979B48">
that the evil &s;hould be fully under&s;tood, in or|der that the remedy, if any can be found, &s;hould be applied with the greater readine&s;s and effect.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>By order of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, JOHN MURRAY, <HI>Chairman of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Health-Office, for the year</HI> 1796. (A true copy.) RICHARD BAYLEY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>AS correct an account as could be obtain|ed of the number of people who &s;ickened and died in the neighbourhood of White-Hall, in 1796, is annex|ed for two particular rea&s;ons:&mdash;1&s;t. To &s;hew that the deva&s;tations committed by that formidable di&s;ea&s;e, were limited to a few acres of ground:&mdash;2dly. and what is of equal importance, is, to &s;hew that its fatality was in a ratio to the vicinity of the nui&s;ance. From the&s;e facts, I would &s;ugge&s;t the following que&s;tion, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR>&mdash;If the Yellow Fever is to be con&s;idered as a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, is it not remarkable that it &s;hould have raged with a violence almo&s;t unequalled in &s;o healthy an ex|po&s;ure as the &s;outh-we&s;t part of our city, and that the other parts of the city enjoyed, at lea&s;t, a u&s;ual degree of health? This que&s;tion cannot po&s;&s;ibly, in my apprehen&s;ion, admit of but one &s;olution, and I would alledge that the temperature and di&s;po&s;ition of the air during the warm &s;ea&s;on of 1796, was not fa|vourable to the propagation of the di&s;ea&s;e generally.&mdash;As far as the poi&s;onous exhalations ari&s;ing from 24000 cart loads &s;treet manure, expo&s;ed to the influence of a hot &s;un, were di&s;tingui&s;hed by their offen&s;ive &s;mell, &s;o far their effects were manife&s;ted by the appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e and no farther.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE deputation of the Common Council, con&s;i&s;ting of Gabriel Furman, Jacob de la Montagnie, and Thomas Storm, E&s;qrs. have, with the Health-Officer, and Commi&s;&s;ioners, in&s;pected the &s;ituation of the &s;treets, docks, wharves and &s;lips, from White|hall to New-market, on the ea&s;t river. The various objects which, in their opinion, require the interpo&s;i|tion and authority of the Common Council, will be the &s;ubject of a &s;ub&s;equent repre&s;entation. At pre&s;ent the Commi&s;&s;ioners (who&s;e immediate duty it appears to be) beg leave to &s;olicit your attention to &s;uch mea&s;ures as may be be&s;t calculated to remedy the following exi&s;t|ing evils, <ABBR>viz:</ABBR>&mdash;</P>
<P>NUISANCES of con&s;iderable magnitude are found on &s;everal vacant and open lots&mdash;particularly one next to the Circus in Broad-Way, and another at the corner of Broad-Way and Beaver-&s;treet. The&s;e we think ought to be inclo&s;ed to prevent a greater collecton of filth and dirt.</P>
<P>THE &s;urface of the &s;treets at the head of the Old-&s;lip
<PB N="42" REF="035161_0040_1000C2EA4B636F90">
and Beckman-&s;lip, want con&s;iderable rai&s;ing with whole&s;ome earth or gravel.</P>
<P>EXCHANGE-SLIP ought to be filled up &s;o far as the Common Council have already determined:&mdash;Al&s;o Burling-&s;lip on a range with the &s;outh &s;ide of Front-&s;treet, and the lot granted Me&s;&s;rs. Van Zandt and Car|ter, on the we&s;t &s;ide of it. This, in its pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion, is likewi&s;e a receptacle for all kinds of offen&s;ive filth.</P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners ob&s;erve with regret, that ade|quate exertions are wanted to dig out White-hall, Co|enties, Coffee-hou&s;e, Fly-market, and Peck &s;lips.&mdash;They beg leave, therefore, to name Mr. Thomas Ha|zard, as a &s;uitable per&s;on to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;uperintend|ance, and to pre&s;s the execution of the&s;e important objects.</P>
<P>THE &s;olicitude of the Commi&s;&s;ioners to obviate the effects apprehended from delaying this bu&s;ine&s;s, will, they tru&s;t, be a &s;ufficient apology for the pre&s;ent ad|dre&s;s.</P>

<P>I AM reque&s;ted to inclo&s;e you the remaining ob&s;ervations on the &s;ituation of the &s;treets, &amp;c, alluded to in our letter of the 10th in&s;t. The
<PB N="43" REF="035161_0041_1000B05E897766A0">
Commi&s;&s;ioners, tho' de&s;irous of brevity in their com|munications, do not find them&s;elves at liberty to a|bridge the pre&s;ent lengthy details; as, in their opinion, every object is of more or le&s;s importance to the ge|neral health of the city.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, &amp;c. JOHN OOTHOUT, Chairman.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="observations">
<HEAD>RESIDUE of the ob&s;ervations on the &s;ituation of the Streets, Slips, Docks, &amp;c. made by Gabriel Furman, Jacob de la Montagnie, and Thomas Storm, E&s;qrs. the Health Officer and Commi&s;&s;ioners, on the 10th of April, 1797.</HEAD>
<P>WHITE-HALL is very much incumbered with tim|ber, brick and other lumber, and generally very filthy. The dock, ea&s;t-&s;ide of the &s;lip, wants paving, the new-made part of which to Exchange-&s;lip, is, at lea&s;t, one foot lower than the outer end and &s;ides. The yards back of the new-built hou&s;es on it, are &s;till lower, exceedingly filthy, and mu&s;t become very offen&s;ive in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> hot weather, unle&s;s filled up with whole&s;ome earth or gravel, which the Commi&s;&s;ioners beg leave to re|commend to the attention of the Common Council.</P>
<P>THE lower end of Moore-&s;treet wants paving, as al&s;o the dock on both &s;ides of Exchange &s;lip, being almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, particularly on Mr. Delafield's &s;ide.</P>
<P>THE pavement ea&s;t-&s;ide of Coenties &s;lip, is in great di&s;order, and much broken up, which makes it ex|ceedingly dangerous for foot pa&s;&s;engers, particularly women and children pa&s;&s;ing by the loaded wood-carts.
<PB N="44" REF="035161_0042_1000C2ECA14F6B88">
The Commi&s;&s;ioners, therefore, &s;ugge&s;t the propriety of widening that dock four or five feet from the up|per end to the &s;outh range of Front-&s;treet, by build|ing a new tier of wood again&s;t the old dock, well an|chored together, which will be a very moderate ex|pence to the proprietor. Unle&s;s this be done, it can|not be made &s;afe, nor &s;uitably commodious for accom|modating the bu&s;ine&s;s con&s;tantly tran&s;acted there.</P>
<P>MR. ASTOR's, and the adjoining vacant water jots, ea&s;t-&s;ide of Peter Schenk's &s;tore, Cruger's wharf, re|quire filling up, or digging out, as, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate they are receptacles of filth, and of cour&s;e, great nui&s;ances. The walks of Front-&s;treet, between Coen|ties and the Old-&s;lip, are generally out of repair, and &s;ome lots totally unpaved. Ca&s;es of this nature are &s;o numerous in Front as well as Water &s;treet, from the Old to the New &s;lip, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to mention each in detail. On this head, therefore, the Commi&s;&s;ioners beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t the propriety of an ordinance, embracing the walks and &s;treets of the whole city, unle&s;s &s;uch does already exi&s;t; for, with|out they are repaired, it will be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to keep them decent.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame general remark mu&s;t &s;uffice with regard to filling up all the lanes and alleys leading to the wharves on the ea&s;t river, from Coenties &s;lip to Kip and Laurence's alley, above the foot of Dover &s;treet.</P>
<P>THE we&s;t &s;ide of the dock, at the Old &s;lip, requires paving, nd the ea&s;t &s;ide both filling <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and paving. At pre&s;ent, <HI>that</HI> al&s;o is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible. The yards, rear of Blaze Moore's and Nevin Wil&s;on's &s;tores, Front &s;treet, are &s;unken, filthy nui&s;ances, and the buildings on them fronting the river, tho' &s;mall, are con&s;idera|bly on the &s;treet.</P>
<P>HERE, the Commi&s;&s;ioners beg leave to particular|ize a few more of the mo&s;t important nui&s;ances of that
<PB N="45" REF="035161_0043_1000B061D6C81B88">
de&s;cription, on the ea&s;t river, which ought, at lea&s;t, to be covered with whole&s;ome earth or gravel.</P>
<P>UNDER the new wooden buildings of William By|ron, at the Fly-market &s;lip&mdash;the &s;tores of John Jack|&s;on, and tho&s;e on the e&s;tate of Leffert Lefferts, at the lower end of Fletcher &s;treet (which &s;treet requires rai&s;|ing and paving, being at pre&s;ent a perfect mud-hole). Al&s;o under the &s;tore lately occupied by Knox and Briggs, corner of Burling-&s;lip, Front &s;treet, in which the yellow fever originated la&s;t &s;prnig. Under the &s;tore, we&s;t &s;ide of Peck &s;lip, corporation property.&mdash;Al&s;o under the corner &s;tore, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and the rear of Thomas Burling's and John Thurman's lots.&mdash;Likewi&s;e, Saml. Ackerly's lot, and under John Dic|ken&s;on's hou&s;e. The two la&s;t mentioned are already very offen&s;ive, and will &s;oon become dangerous.</P>
<P>THE remaining &s;unken lots and yards throughout the town, particularly on the ea&s;t &s;ide from White|hall to Catharine &s;lip, are &s;o numerous, and thought &s;uch great &s;ources of unhealthine&s;s in the hot &s;ea&s;on, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners are much at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay on the &s;ubject of filling them up, as &s;uch an under|taking mu&s;t prove very inconvenient to numbers of hou&s;es, and be attended with immen&s;e expence, which many of the occupants are at pre&s;ent but illy prepared to bear.</P>
<P>THE docks on both &s;ides of the Coffee-hou&s;e and Fly market &s;lips, want paving. Front-&s;treet, from the ea&s;t &s;ide of Burling &s;lip to Peck &s;lip, requires re|gulating, filling up and paving: Almo&s;t the whole, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, being a perfect nui&s;ance. If this great object be effected, it will compel a number of proprie|tors of lots and buildings in that quarter, to fill up; by which means many filthy and &s;unken places, will be &s;o far covered, as not to produce evils in hot wea|ther, which otherwi&s;e, in the opinion of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, may re&s;ult.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="035161_0044_1000C2EEEB7D58B8">
THE dock on the we&s;t and ea&s;t &s;ide of Peck &s;lip, re|quires paving; and the wharves in front, on the ea&s;t &s;ide regulating and filling up. Both &s;ides of James' &s;lip, want paving; al&s;o the lower end of Oliver &s;treet from Cherry &s;treet. Catharine &s;lip wants &s;ome dig|ging out; and the dock on the we&s;t &s;ide of it, as well as Catharine market, require paving.</P>
<P>MAGAZINE, Augu&s;tus, Little Ann and Barley &s;treets require a regulation and great improvements. In the di&s;trict of the&s;e &s;treets, there are two large ponds of &s;tagnant water, which, with the noxious factories may render them a &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;e in hot weather, and are therefore, objects that require timely attention.</P>
<P>THE lower ends of Rector and Carli&s;le &s;treets lead|ing from Greenwich &s;treet to the North river, want con&s;iderable rai&s;ing, being at pre&s;ent &s;unken miry places, and impa&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE large &s;quare in front of the new Albany ba&s;on, and the dock on each &s;ide, require paving. Some pavement al&s;o is wanted at the foot of Cortland &s;treet; and the &s;lip at the foot of Dey &s;treet, &s;hould be filled up.</P>

5th in&s;t. reque&s;ted, that as &s;oon as Mr. Hazard had completed the objects he was then engaged in, of clean&s;ing &s;lips with the machine, he might be employed in the &s;uperintendance and care of clean&s;ing and re|moving the dirt and filth from the piers, docks, &amp;c. of the city, from White Hall to New-&s;lip, on the Ea&s;t river. This is meant to be done agreeably to &s;ome ar|rangement in contemplation, whereby the proprietors &s;hall bear a proportion of the expence, with the pub|lic, if po&s;&s;ible. The Commi&s;&s;ioners think it mo&s;t advi&s;e|able to di&s;continue taking any more dirt out of the docks for the pre&s;ent. If their opinion concurs with that of the Common Council, they beg that Mr. Hazard may be directed to take charge of the other object un|der the immediate direction of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, during the time this &s;ervice may be judged nece&s;&s;ary, and to receive his daily pay from them, which is un|der&s;tood to be twelve &s;hillings.</P>
<P>IN addition to the places already repre&s;ented in di&s;|order, the following require the interpo&s;ition of the board.</P>
<P>Peter Goelett's and John Delafield's &s;ide walks, each &s;ide of Exchange Slip, ought to be made without delay.</P>
<P>THE L. from the Old to the new Albany pier, at Coenties Slip, wants filling up with gravel or other &s;olid materials.</P>
<P>THE front of Robert Watts's lots facing the River, Ea&s;t &s;ide of Fly-market Stairs, where the Ferry Hou&s;e &s;tands, is in a &s;tate highly exceptionable, and re|quires con&s;iderable rai&s;ing to ca&s;t off the water.</P>
<P>THE Alley leading from Peck Slip, between Water and Pearl Streets, is in a &s;tate of great nui&s;ance, and requires filling up, &s;o as to ca&s;t the water into Peck Slip. The proprietors are Thomas Elli&s;on, Samuel
<PB N="50" REF="035161_0048_1000B06C836DAB98">
Farmer, Benjamin Mott, William Minturn, and others.</P>
<P>James and Catherine &s;lips are al&s;o in a &s;tate of great nui&s;ance. The Commi&s;&s;ioners, though aver&s;e to fil|ling up &s;lips: if even it were optional with them) from a knowledge of their public utility, are at a lo&s;s what el&s;e to advi&s;e in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to remedy the evils that may ari&s;e from the condition of the&s;e two. They conceive, however, that James's &s;lip, as far as it runs bare, and Catherine-&s;lip, as far as the North &s;ide of Wa|ter-&s;treet, ought to be filled up.</P>
<P>THE lower ends of Chamber and Murray-&s;treets, on the North river, are in great di&s;order, and require re|gulating and filling. The rear of Mr. Strachan's lot, and Mr. Rhinelander's adjoining it, on Wa&s;hington-&s;treet; and the lower end of Robin&s;on-&s;treet, from Greenwich-&s;treet to Wa&s;hington-&s;treet, want filling.</P>
<P>THE pavement in Front-&s;treet, and the &s;ide walks from the Old &s;lip to Gouverneur's alley, particularly, are in &s;uch di&s;order, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to get them kept decent and whole&s;ome without repairs. This leads the Commi&s;&s;ioners to expre&s;s their regret that &s;o little attention has been paid to the &s;treets and walks generally, where &s;o much is wanted.</P>

<P>THE &s;hip Shepherde&s;s, commanded by I&s;aac Hand, arrived in this harbour ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>MR. PARKER the per&s;on appointed by the Commi&s;|&s;ioners to in&s;pect all ve&s;&s;els arriving in this port from the &s;outhward of Cape May, in pur&s;uane of his duty, hailed the Sheperde&s;s on her way into port, and en|quired the &s;tate of health of the crew. They re|turned

for an&s;wer, that all was well. Determined, however, for certain rea&s;ons, to obtain more particu|lar information, he boarded her, and made enquiries of the pilot, William Berwick, and of the mate, with re&s;pect to the health of the people, and was told there was no &s;ick on board.</P>
<P>AT eleven o'clock this morning, I received a writ|ten notification, that a man, &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ick of the yellow fever, was lodged back of No. 30, Pope's alley, Rutgers' &s;treet. I repaired to the place, and found a Mr. William Mo&s;es, who had, the preced|ing evening, been landed from the &s;hip Shepher|de&s;s from Savannah. On examination I found him in the la&s;t &s;tage of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uance of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me, I went im|mediately, and lodged the nece&s;&s;ary information with the Alderman of the ward, Mr. Jotham Po&s;t, after which I proceeded to the &s;hip, and reque&s;ted the ma&s;|ter, Mr. I&s;aac Hand, to place colors in her &s;hrouds, remove her from the dock immediately, and bring her to anchor on the ground a&s;&s;igned for quarantine.</P>
<P>ON enquiry, it appeared that William Berwick, a pilot, conducted the Shepherde&s;s into port, and to the wharf. On being de&s;ired by the Captain to remove her into the &s;tream, and to the quarantine ground, he equivocated, he&s;itated, and behaved otherwi&s;e impro|perly.</P>
<P>AFTER having given directions as &s;tated above, I le&s;t the ve&s;&s;el with colors in her &s;hrouds. Some time af|ter, William Berwick, the pilot, damned the colors, took a knife from his pocket, and ordered them from the &s;hrouds&mdash;a boy accordingly took them down.</P>
<P>Two hours after my fir&s;t vi&s;it, finding the &s;hip had not dropped down to the quarantine ground, I return|ed

<P>WHEN the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Health Office entered on the di&s;charge of the important tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, they felt &s;olicitous that nothing &s;hould be wanted on their part, to accompli&s;h the objects of their appointment.</P>
<P>WITH this view, they have frequently been led to addre&s;s you, on the &s;ubject of the numerous nui&s;ances,
<PB N="60" REF="035161_0058_1000C306AF529BD8">
which exi&s;ted in various parts of the city; and they acknowledge the readine&s;s with which the Common Council have interpo&s;ed their authority for the remo|val of them. But, tho' much has been done, much more remains to be done. The object of the pre&s;ent addre&s;s is, to call the attention of the board, to a &s;ub|ject which, in the opinion of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, is of great moment to the future welfare of the citizens.</P>
<P>THE experience of the part &s;ummer and pre&s;ent au|tumn as it regards the operation and effect of the <HI>&s;y&s;|tem of cleanline&s;s</HI> introduced la&s;t &s;pring, has convinced the Commi&s;&s;ioners that it is practicable to a &s;till greater extent. That it meets the general approbation of their fellow-citizens, is a plea&s;ing fact: and, that our exemp|tion from di&s;ea&s;es incident to the &s;ea&s;on, ought, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to be attributed to it, is acknowledged. The few ca&s;es of yellow fever which have occured dur|ing the pa&s;t &s;ummer, were mo&s;tly on the borders of the ea&s;t river, and originated in &s;ituations where <HI>nui&s;ances continue to exi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>WITH the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, the Commi&s;&s;ioners beg leave to repre&s;ent to the Common Council, the nece&s;|&s;ity of directing by an ordinance, all the proprietors of water-lots, e&s;pecially on the Ea&s;t river, to fill them up with &s;olid materials, &s;o that the whole extent of ground already granted, may be completely fini&s;hed by the fir&s;t of May next, at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>OF whatever magnitude this propo&s;al may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear, in its effects on the convenience or in|tere&s;ts of individuals, the benefits contemplated are incalculably great to the city in general: that is, the removal of tho&s;e cau&s;es which may contribute to aid the return of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es in the city.</P>
<P>DESIROUS as the Commi&s;&s;ioners are, that the ex|periment thus far &s;ucce&s;sfully attempted, of obviating di&s;ea&s;e by cleanline&s;s, may be more fully tried, and

take place at this &s;ea&s;on of the year&mdash;inconvenien|cies with which they are at this moment contending.</P>
<P>ONE building only was intended for the reception of the &s;ick, which in the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on, was found incapable of lodging the whole: and altho' another was fitted for the purpo&s;e, the want of &s;epa|rate apartments, made it nece&s;&s;ary to mix together, per&s;ons of all cla&s;&s;es and de&s;criptions, of different &s;ex, and laboring under different di&s;ea&s;es, and in all the various &s;tages of their di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more nece&s;&s;ary in the treatment of the &s;ick, than that the orders of the Phy&s;ician &s;hould be faithfully performed, the better to enable him to ren|der practicable the execution of his object. Yet &s;uch has been the &s;tate of things, from the mixed and various employments of the nur&s;es, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible in &s;ome in&s;tances, to carry into effect tho&s;e mea&s;ures which &s;ugge&s;ted them&s;elves to me as nece&s;&s;a|ry to promote the recovery of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>As a counterbalance of the foregoing &s;hort unplea|&s;ant narrative, I &s;hall proceed to make a few remarks of a more &s;atisfactory nature.</P>
<P>THE liberal &s;upply of linen, bedding, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. which has been furni&s;hed for the u&s;e of this in&s;titution, has enabled the attendants to keep the &s;ick in a &s;tate of compleat cleanline&s;s. The re&s;ult has been, that notwith&s;tanding the many in&s;tances of Yellow-Fever, which have come under my care &s;ince my re&s;idence on this i&s;land, &s;ome of which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a degree of malignancy &s;carcely to be exceeded, there is no in|&s;tance in which the di&s;ea&s;e has been communicated to nur&s;es, attendants or vi&s;itors, nor to the boatmen who have conducted the &s;ick to the i&s;land.</P>
<P>IF from the want of opportunity hitherto, I had not made up my mind on the real character of the

Yellow-Fever, I &s;hould now have no more he&s;itation in attending the &s;ick laboring under this di&s;ea&s;e, than in other entrances of Fever, without fear of receiving infection, provided due cleanline&s;s and ventilation were ob&s;erved.</P>

<HEAD>From the Health Officer to the Governor</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Health Office, <DATE>Dec. 1, 1797.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE corre&s;pondence which I had the honor of holding with your Excellency, has been on a &s;ubject which yields to none on the &s;core of public utility.</P>
<P>THE patient attention and ready a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which you have always be&s;towed upon it, emboldens me to trouble you on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and inclines me to believe, that the vouchers which have been lately &s;ubmitted to your in&s;pection, have, as well as others, extremely intere&s;ting to the citizens, received a &s;hare of your attention. Feeling my&s;elf in a &s;ituation of great re&s;pon&s;ibility as it relates to the health of the city, it appears to me that I cannot be too particular in de|tails which fix the PUBLIC ATTENTION, by adducing facts calculated, at once, to detect error and e&s;tabli&s;h truth.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t repre&s;entation that was made by the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Health Office, to the Common Council of this city on the &s;ubject of nui&s;ances, was in the latter part of March, 1797. It is to be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e nui&s;ances were found too numerous to be all removed in one &s;ea&s;on. The Common Council,
<PB N="64" REF="035161_0062_1000C30E30FE3C80">
therefore, i&s;&s;ued their ordinances for the removal of tho&s;e only which were conceived to be of the greate&s;t magnitude. And while individuals were employed in fulfilling the orders of the Magi&s;trates, the Commi&s;&s;i|oners divided the city into di&s;tricts, to each of which a &s;uperintendant, and a &s;uitable number of &s;cavengers were appointed, who engaged to &s;ee that their re&s;pec|tive di&s;tricts were &s;wept and properly clean&s;ed twice in each week. By means of the&s;e arrangements, the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects were produced, in&s;omuch that it has &s;ince been a common remark, that the city, during the la&s;t &s;ummer, has generally been free from tho&s;e di&s;agreeable effluvia, which before, e&s;pecially in particular &s;ituations, rendered the air almo&s;t unfit for re&s;piration. To the&s;e regulations may fairly be a&s;|cribed in a great degree the univer&s;al health of the in|habitants during the &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t communication that was made to the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners on the appearance of malignant fever in this city, was by letter from Dr. Ander&s;on, dated Sep|tember the 6th. This letter was followed by others of a &s;imilar nature from different gentlemen of the facul|ty. The mea&s;ures which were in con&s;equence pur&s;u|ed, were &s;uch as were judged be&s;t calculated for the recovery of the &s;ick, and the &s;afety of their attendants.</P>
<P>IF, on examination, the &s;ick were found accom|modated in &s;uch a manner, as to allow of due clean|line&s;s and good air, they were &s;uffered to remain with their friends;&mdash;on the contrary, if they were in croud|ed and confined habitations, where ventilation was impracticable, it was thought expedient to remove them from the city. Here it is worthy of remark, that the in&s;tances of malignant fever which occurred in different parts of the city, had their origin in the neighbourhood of a nui&s;ance, which had been report|ed to the Corporation early in the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>ON the 23d of September, a letter was addre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="65" REF="035161_0063_1000B0848FCD7C88">
to the Commi&s;&s;ioners from Dr. Faugeres, repre&s;enting that the people in George &s;treet were &s;ickening. The Commi&s;&s;ioners, in con&s;equence, were led to inquire what were the probable cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e in that quar|ter. On examination it was found that the hou&s;es in that part of the &s;treet where the fever prevailed, were compo&s;ed of &s;mall apartments, with cellars eight and ten feet under ground. In the&s;e were crouded toge|ther people of a de&s;cription truly unfortunate, who&s;e circum&s;tances and manners expo&s;ed them to all the di&s;ea&s;es incident to poverty and intemperance. To this unfailing &s;ource of the cau&s;e of malignant fever, was added the manufactory of a Skinner in the &s;ame &s;treet, the emptying of who&s;e vats threw &s;uch a quantity of noxious vapours into the atmo&s;phere, as proved a great annoyance to the whole neighbourhood. On the 20th of September there were eleven per&s;ons &s;ick within &s;ixty yards of each other, in George &s;treet, five of whom died in twenty-four hours after I had made my fir&s;t vi&s;it, at the reque&s;t of the Commi&s;&s;ioners.&mdash;The mea&s;ures which were adopted in this in&s;tance, were to bury the dead without any unnece&s;&s;ary delay&mdash;to cau&s;e the rooms of the &s;ick to be thoroughly clean&s;|ed, ventilated and white-wa&s;hed, and the attention of clean&s;ing and ventilating was al&s;o paid to the bedding and clothes of the decea&s;ed. Lime was al&s;o furni&s;hed for the u&s;e of the indigent in the neighbourhood, who&s;e families had not &s;uffered from di&s;ea&s;e. By the&s;e means your Excellency may be a&s;&s;ured, that the re&s;ult was gratifying to the fine&s;t feelings of humanity. In the cour&s;e of a few days, the people of George &s;treet were delivered from a calamity which threatened &s;oon to be|come exten&s;ive, and were re&s;tored to as healthy a &s;tate as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on it happened that &s;everal per&s;ons were &s;eized with fever, who had but a &s;hort time previous, arrived from Philadelphia. The con|duct of the Commi&s;&s;ioners was on the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;i|milar to that which they ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to our
<PB N="66" REF="035161_0064_1000C3111B64E0E0">
own citizens. If they found the &s;ick &s;o &s;ituated as to enjoy all the advantages of cleanline&s;s and good air, they were left under the management of their re&s;pec|tive friends and Phy&s;icians: if otherwi&s;e, they were removed from the city. Hence, in all human proba|bility, it happened, that there was no in&s;tance of com|municated infection. This was particularly remark|able in the ca&s;es of Me&s;&s;rs. Suydam, Havens, Burch|ill and others, with whom the intercour&s;e of friends was never re&s;trained; and though their di&s;ea&s;es were di&s;tinctly marked, and of the mo&s;t violent type, yet they were not communicated.</P>
<P>AFTER engaging your Excellency's attention to the occurrences which took place in the city, it will not, I hope, be deemed a tre&s;pa&s;s on your time, to reque&s;t it for a moment to tho&s;e which occurred on Bedlow's I&s;land.</P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners having u&s;ed every means with|in their power, to guard the city again&s;t the &s;preading of malignant fever, turned their attention to the La|zaretto, in order to a&s;certain to what degree of hazard tho&s;e were expo&s;ed, who were employed in removing the &s;ick from the city, and from the different ve&s;&s;els, to the I&s;land. To this end, the number of men em|ployed (during the &s;ea&s;on) was limited to 8. The&s;e men, though often obliged nece&s;&s;arily to and lift carry the &s;ick, &s;uffered not, in the &s;malle&s;t degree, from their occupation.</P>
<P>IN the Ho&s;pital, there were eleven per&s;ons employ|ed as nur&s;es, attendants, &amp;c. among all the&s;e, there was not one in&s;tance <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Fever. Mr. O&s;borne, Sur|geon to the garri&s;on on Governor's I&s;land, was pre|vailed upon to attend the &s;ick on Bedlow's i&s;land, for a certain period; and in a letter which he addre&s;&s;ed to the Commi&s;&s;ioners on his re&s;igning his employment there, (which is tran&s;mitted for your Excellency's peru&s;al) he gives a particular account of the &s;tate of
<PB N="67" REF="035161_0065_1000C31440352190">
the Ho&s;pital, and expre&s;&s;es much &s;atisfaction at &s;ee|ing the good effects which cleanline&s;s and ventilation had afforded it.</P>
<P>IF there needed any other confirmation than what has occurred through the &s;ea&s;on, and happened with|in the knowledge of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, it may be found in the following facts:</P>
<P>MR. CASE, of Newburgh in this &s;tate, and his comrade, were &s;ent to the Ho&s;pital from the &s;hip Margaret, captain Bebee, both &s;ick of the Yellow-Fever. As &s;oon as the &s;ituation of Mr. Ca&s;e was made known to his friends, his mother and brother ha&s;tened to &s;ee him. Mrs. Ca&s;e and her &s;on were un|limited in their intercour&s;e with their &s;ick relation; and Mrs. Ca&s;e remained with him, and performed all the duties of an affectionate mother and tender nur&s;e, to the moment of his death, which happened on the &s;ixth day of his illne&s;s. His comrade recovered.&mdash;Mr. Ca&s;e, before his death, was as yellow as an orange; but neither the mother nor brother experi|enced the lea&s;t indi&s;po&s;ition in con&s;equence of their vi&s;it to the Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Two men were, from certain circum&s;tances, re|ceived into the Ho&s;pital, with fractured legs&mdash;they re|mained in the &s;ame apartment with tho&s;e ill of Yel|low-Fever, and neither of them took the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE facts are from my own knowledge; and impre&s;&s;ed as I truly am with their importance, and particularly with the inferences which may be drawn from them, I cannot be too earne&s;t in my attempts to impre&s;s them upon your Excellency.</P>
<P>IT is at all times an arduous undertaking to con|quer prejudices; and it is commonly an unthankful office to rectify abu&s;es which compel men to draw money from their pockets. The city of New-York,
<PB N="68" REF="035161_0066_1000C315E8799280">
which offers to its merchants the fine&s;t pro&s;pects of wealth, and to all its inhabitants the more plea&s;ing one of health, if properly attended to, &s;hould be put in a &s;ituation which would render it capable of real|izing both. The expence of doing this, is unworthy of notice, compared to the end when attained;&mdash;nay, the very expence is but another means of en|hancing the value of property, as well as of &s;ecuring the comforts of life. The legi&s;lature then, in ninety &s;even, have been commendably employed in &s;anction|ing a &s;y&s;tem, <HI>which if completed,</HI> mu&s;t be attended with effects incalculably beneficial.</P>
<P>PERMIT me to repeat, that as I have per&s;onally known all the facts previou&s;ly &s;tated, as well with re|gard to the city as Lazaretto, and as I have per&s;onally conducted the operations of the Health-Office, I can vouch for their truth, and con&s;ider my&s;elf accountable for them.</P>
<P>BEING extremely de&s;irous, as far as it is in my pow|er, to render the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Health-Office, a real good to the people, I mo&s;t heartily join the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners in entreating your Excellency to make &s;uch a repre&s;entation to the Legi&s;lature, as you may judge proper on this important &s;ubject.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> have been from time to time informed by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the la&s;t and of the pre&s;ent year, of the very unfit condition of the buildings on Bedlow's I&s;land, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of a Lazaretto. I &s;hall, therefore, only add, that there is the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity for fixing the &s;pot on which &s;uitable and permanent buildings may be erected, &s;o that the in&s;titution may be rendered as complete and u&s;eful as po&s;&s;ible, before the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I WILL take my leave, by remarking to your Ex|cellency, that the ready a&s;&s;i&s;tance which the Health Commi&s;&s;ioners received from the Common Council,

<P>A REPRESENTATION has been made to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Jail yard is exceptionable&mdash;in con&s;equence of which, they, together with the Health Officer, vi&s;ited it this morn|ing, and are of opinion, that removing the rubbi&s;h daily, and keeping it as clean as po&s;&s;ible hereafter, will not only conduce very greatly to the health and convenience of the family as well as the pri&s;oners, but tend to prevent any bad effects upon the inhabitants in its vicinity, from an accumulation of offen&s;ive objects in the approaching warm &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THEY are al&s;o of opinion, that if the walls of the different apartments, were repeatedly white wa&s;hed, it would purify the air of the pri&s;on, and render it more whole&s;ome.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been rumoured that the Yellow-Fever had made its appearance in town. It therefore &s;eems proper that the Commi&s;&s;ioners give your Excel|lency the earlie&s;t information of the facts which, in their opinion, have led to it.</P>
<P>IN the &s;pring of la&s;t year, the Commi&s;&s;ioners, in one of their reports to the Common Council, remark|ed that the whole ea&s;t &s;ide of Front-&s;treet, from Coen|ties to the Old &s;lip, was in an unfini&s;hed and otherwi&s;e exceptionable &s;tate; and that their interpo&s;ition was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to prevent the evils which, in hot weather, might re&s;ult from it. Some difficulty aro&s;e at the time, which &s;u&s;pended the reforms contemplated. A few &s;olitary ca&s;es of violent fever and death occurred in the vicini|ty of that ground, in the cour&s;e of la&s;t &s;ummer, which the Health-Officer and Commi&s;&s;ioners have no doubt originated from the cau&s;es repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>THEY expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame apprehen&s;ions in &s;ome of their &s;ub&s;equent reports to the Common Council; but fortunately nothing like a fever of a particular kind, has manife&s;ted it&s;elf in the whole city till within a few

days. Several inhabitants in the neighbourhood of the&s;e docks and open lots (which are yet receptacles of filth, dirt and carrion) have been attacked, all with &s;imilar complaints, and, we have no doubt, from the cau&s;es before enumerated. The greater part, howe|ver, are recovered or convale&s;cent. The re&s;t of the city is healthy. The Common Council have now tak|en &s;uch mea&s;ures as, we hope, will remedy the evils ap|prehended from tho&s;e &s;ources, for the pre&s;ent.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners, in di&s;charge of their duty, inform the Common Council, that the great ma&s;s of filth at the head of Cuyler's and A&s;tor's lots, between Coenties and the Old &s;lip, in Front &s;treet, is covered&mdash;that the operation is progre&s;&s;ing&mdash;and that the &s;ickne&s;s in that neighbourhood, has nearly &s;ub&s;id|ed.</P>
<P>THEY are &s;orry to inform the board, that the di&s;|ea&s;e, which occurred at the New &s;lip and in its vicinity, has not &s;o fortunately terminated. Nine per&s;ons are reported to have died there&mdash;five to be &s;till &s;ick&mdash;and nine or ten recovered, or removed into the country. Every thing which prudence &s;ugge&s;ted, or exertion could perform for the indigent, has been done in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t week, and at as moderate an expence as po&s;&s;ible to the public.</P>
<P>THE uncommon large body of water on Li&s;penard's meadow, north of his hou&s;e, has &s;ub&s;ided only about ten inches &s;ince the rains on Tue&s;day la&s;t, by the or|dinary drain. It is the opinion of the Health Officer, that as &s;oon as the &s;urface of the meadow gets expo&s;ed to the influence of the &s;un, the exhalations ari&s;ing from it, will generate di&s;ea&s;e in that neighbourhood. He therefore recommends a more &s;udden draining of it. The Commi&s;&s;ioners have no doubt but the board will take &s;uch order on this &s;ubject, as the exigency may require.</P>
<P>A NUMBER of the inhabitants have frequently ex|pre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, that carts might be employed to take up the garbage and other offals, which, by &s;tanding in
<PB N="80" REF="035161_0078_1000B096E4FAD7B8">
confined places, from one &s;weeping day to another, become exceedingly offen&s;ive. The Commi&s;&s;ioners have reflected more &s;eriou&s;ly on this &s;ubject, &s;ince the great heats &s;et in, and believe it would be advi&s;eable to remove them every Monday, Thur&s;day and Satur|day. They find that &s;ome of the Scavengers will per|form this &s;ervice by the day. If the board approve of an experiment, the Commi&s;&s;ioners will agree with five men for the days above-mentioned till the la&s;t of Sep|tember, as cheap as po&s;&s;ible. They do not expect to exceed 12s. per day for each.</P>

<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners will thank you to inform them, whether any in&s;tances of infection oc|curred among the attendants at Bellevue Ho&s;pital, during your re&s;idence at that place:&mdash;and if there did, be &s;o good as to mention the ca&s;es; the circum|&s;tances which, in your opinion gave ri&s;e to them; and in particular, the cau&s;e to which your attack is to be attributed.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it is the reque&s;t of the Commi&s;&s;i|oners of the Health Office, that I &s;hould inform them of the &s;tate of Bellevue Ho&s;pital during my re&s;idence there; as al&s;o, point out particularly the &s;ource from whence I &s;uppo&s;ed the fever with which I was &s;o vio|lently attacked, aro&s;e, I think it my duty to &s;tate to them a few circum&s;tances, and explain the manner in which I conceive my di&s;ea&s;e to have originated.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="035161_0088_1000C33A48B09048">
MY attendance commenced on the 12th of June la&s;t. From that period, to the 14th of November, there were admitted into the Ho&s;pital, 389 patients, of which number perhaps three fourths were &s;ick with pe&s;tilential fevers. The nur&s;es employed during the &s;ame period, were 16 in number. The Health Office boatmen, who were in the habit of bringing the &s;ick to the Ho&s;pital, as well from the city as &s;hip|ping, were accu&s;tomed to enter the Ho&s;pital at all times, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in placing as well as removing the &s;ick from room to room. The number of Wa&s;her|women during the &s;ea&s;on, was 7. Several per&s;ons were al&s;o con&s;tantly employed in cooking, pre&s;erving cleanline&s;s, and burying the dead. There were, be|&s;ides, tran&s;ient people, near relations of the &s;ick, who were permitted by the Commi&s;&s;ioners to vi&s;it occa&s;ion|ally. Several per&s;ons accompanied their friends to Bellevue, &s;taid with them, and nur&s;ed them during their illne&s;s. Under all the&s;e circum&s;tances, to my knowledge, there happened no in&s;tance of infection, altho' an opinion has been adopted by many, that my &s;ickne&s;s, whil&s;t re&s;iding at Bellevue Ho&s;pital, aro&s;e from infection, imbibed at that place.</P>
<P>To what cau&s;e, then, is to be attributed the Fever with which I was &s;eized at Bellevue on the 5th of October?</P>
<P>HAVING occa&s;ion to vi&s;it my friends in New-York, three days previous to my illne&s;s, and having unfor|tunately &s;lept in an highly infected part of the city, no doubt can exi&s;t with me, but it aro&s;e from that cau&s;e. In making this declaration, I mu&s;t remark to you, that the &s;ituation of the medical attendants at Bellevue, was by no means a propitious one. Before the new buildings were erected for the acommodation of the &s;ick, the Phy&s;ician's room, (the only one they had) was literally &s;urrounded by them. The room adjoin|ing,&mdash;the front and back piazas&mdash;the hall&mdash;the rooms and hall in the &s;econd &s;tory&mdash;a room in the cellar
<PB N="91" REF="035161_0089_1000C33C1A7C9BF0">
that had been u&s;ed for a kitchen, all contained &s;ick,&mdash;THEY were, likewi&s;e, placed in &s;everal Chine&s;e &s;ummer hou&s;es, in the &s;mall &s;pace between the main-hou&s;e and the ea&s;t river; and in the building erected for the purpo&s;e of a bathing-hou&s;e. A large canva&s;s was al&s;o erected (for want of a more convenient place) under the windows of the &s;outh-we&s;t part of the hou&s;e, for the reception of the dying and the dead. I add, Sir, that under all the di&s;advantages enumerated, I know of no in&s;tance where infection re&s;ulted.</P>
<P>PERMIT me to conclude, by expre&s;&s;ing the thanks due to the polite and humane attention of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners to my&s;elf, and to the &s;ick in general; and I feel a pride in acknowledging, that to them&mdash;the ge|nerous and per&s;evering exertions of my preceptor, Dr. RICHARD BAYLEY, and the interpo&s;ition of a kind Providence, I am indebted for my <HI>life.</HI></P>

<P>IN addition to the facts which are con|tained in the corre&s;pondence between the Health Com|mi&s;&s;ioners and the Common Council for the year 1798, I &s;hall offer to your con&s;ideration a few remarks upon the origin and progre&s;s of the pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;e which has lately prevailed in this city; and in order to cor|roborate
<PB N="92" REF="035161_0090_1000B0A7F7FDA610">
what I may advance, I &s;hall, in the fir&s;t place take a retro&s;pect of events which have annually taken place in this city during the warm months &s;ince the year 1795.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the records of the Health Office, the Yellow Fever appeared in 1796 at White-hall, at the foot of Pine-&s;treet, at Burling-&s;lip, and in the neighbourhood of Ro&s;evelt-&s;treet, &s;ewer.</P>
<P>IN 1797 between Coenties and the Old-&s;lip, in Front-&s;treet, at the Fly-market in &s;everal in&s;tances, in Flet|cher-&s;treet, at Burling-&s;lip, in Water-&s;tret, adjoining Roo&s;evelt-&s;treet, &s;ewer, in George-&s;treet, and at the foot of Pine-&s;treet.</P>
<P>IN 1798 the di&s;ea&s;e fir&s;t appeared about midway be|tween Coenties and the Old-&s;lip, in Front-&s;treet, be|tween the 1&s;t and 7th of Augu&s;t. On the 7th Augu&s;t about twenty-three were reported &s;ick to the Health-Office. From that period &s;everal others &s;ickened, and of the whole number one died. By the 26th of Augu&s;t, the complaint had di&s;appeared in that quarter in con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures taken to remove the cau&s;e, by covering the offen&s;ive lots with clean, whole|&s;ome earth.</P>
<P>ON the 12th of Augu&s;t, it appeared at No. 283, Water-&s;treet, in the ca&s;e of Mr. Taylor, in an old broken building, on an unfini&s;hed lot at the foot of Dover-&s;treet, in which 11 per&s;ons died early in 1795, and which has &s;ince been repeatedly repre&s;ented as a nui&s;ance.</P>
<P>AUGUST 12, al&s;o, the di&s;ea&s;e appeared in the ca&s;e of John Hender&s;on, corner of James-&s;treet and Ba|tavia lane. On all &s;ides of his re&s;idence, which was a &s;mall crouded building, there were &s;unken lots in an unfini&s;hed &s;tate.</P>
<P>AGAIN, on Augu&s;t 12, the di&s;ea&s;e appeared in
<PB N="93" REF="035161_0091_1000C33E9ECCB848">
William Whitlock, Cardmaker, No. 51, Cherry-&s;treet. In the rear and to the &s;outh of his re&s;idence, the lots are very generally below the level of the &s;treets, and without drains.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 13. Murdock M'Lean, Bruce's wharf, was &s;eized, where the di&s;ea&s;e has regularly made its appearance every warm &s;ea&s;on &s;ince the year 1795.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t arrival of &s;ick in this harbour (to the knowledge of the Health-Office) from Philadelphia, was on the 13th of Augu&s;t, in the New-York and Phi|ladelphia Packet. The Captain died on the pa&s;&s;age&mdash;the Mate was &s;ick and was &s;ent to Bellevue.</P>

ON the morning of the 14th, the heavie&s;t rain fell of any time during the year. It began at 5 A. M. and continued without intermi&s;&s;ion till nine. Numerous cellars, particularly tho&s;e in the low parts of the city, were filled with water. Li&s;penard's meadow, which may be con&s;idered as within the limits of the city, was entirely overflowed. In &s;ix days it had not &s;ub&s;ided above ten inches; and the water did not pa&s;s off, till a large drain was opened for that purpo&s;e, by order of the Common Council.</P>

<P>THE &s;udden and great increa&s;e of heat immediately after the violent rain, appeared to have a proportio|nate influence in producing fever. Between that pe|riod and the 22d Augu&s;t, upwards of twenty per&s;ons in Cliff-&s;treet, were &s;eized with &s;light indi&s;po&s;itions, which they attributed to &s;leeping with open windows during the preceding hot and moi&s;t weather, but which appeared rather as the forerunner of yellow fever, for, not only the per&s;ons thus indi&s;po&s;ed, but a number of others <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ame &s;treet, had that di&s;ea&s;e in the cour&s;e of a few days.</P>
<P>FROM this period the di&s;ea&s;e became more general; but its fatality was principally felt in Cliff-&s;treet and its neighbourhood, at Catharine &s;lip, in Water-&s;treet, and on the unfini&s;hed grounds in the &s;outhern part of the city.</P>
<P>NOW, having &s;een that the yellow fever has made its appearance in New-York every year, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, but has prevailed in very different degrees, it becomes a matter of great importance to determine,
<PB N="95" REF="035161_0093_1000C34140EE3478">
why the di&s;ea&s;e was &s;o generally prevalent on the low new-made grounds in this city in 1795, whil&s;t it was &s;carcely felt in the more elevated &s;ituations; why, in 1796 and 1797, its appearance was limited to particu|lar &s;pots; and why, in 1798 it not only prevailed on all the new-made grounds, but al&s;o in parts of the city which had before been exempted from the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions in &s;uch manner, as to prove &s;atisfactory to every one, might be a very diffi|cult ta&s;k. I &s;hall, however, offer &s;ome rea&s;ons which may tend to &s;hew why the fever was more prevalent this year, than in the preceding years.</P>
<P>IT is well a&s;certained that in the year 1795, there was an unu&s;ual degree of heat and moi&s;ture in the at|mo&s;phere during the warmer months&mdash;that the Ther|mometer was con&s;iderably higher than in 1796 and 1797, but that in 1798, the heat greatly exceeded that of 1795.</P>
<P>Now, as heat and moi&s;ture are powerful agents in <HI>producing</HI> pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o mu&s;t the &s;ame cau&s;es nece&s;&s;arily promote the <HI>exten&s;ion</HI> of tho&s;e di&s;|ea&s;es.</P>
<P>IN the year '98, there were be&s;ides, local cau&s;es of fever in this city, which did not exi&s;t in the other &s;ea&s;ons, and which, co-operating with the weather, &s;erved to extend the di&s;ea&s;e beyond the limits, to which it would probably have been otherwi&s;e con|fined. I have reference to the immen&s;e quantities of &s;poiled beef, fi&s;h, and other articles of a peri&s;hable nature which were &s;tored in different parts of this city. The noxious exhalations ari&s;ing from the&s;e &s;ources, in my apprehen&s;ion was a great cau&s;e why, the di&s;ea&s;e aro&s;e and raged with great violence in par|ticular &s;ituations: And when we con&s;ider the &s;udden appearance of the fever on Golden-Hill and in Cliff-&s;treet, and the great number which &s;ickened
<PB N="96" REF="035161_0094_1000C343937DCEA0">
nearly at the &s;ame time, there is great rea&s;on to believe this opinion well founded.</P>
<P>ABOUT the 20th of Augu&s;t, a report was made to the Health Office, that great quantities of &s;poiled beef were &s;tored in Pearl-&s;teet, between Burling and Beekman-&s;lips. The &s;tench which i&s;&s;ued from &s;ome of the cellars in this &s;ituation, was &s;o con&s;iderable, as to prove very offen&s;ive to tho&s;e who pa&s;&s;ed by, and became a &s;ubject of general ob&s;ervation. Letters, in con&s;equence, from the Health Office, were addre&s;&s;|ed to the owners of provi&s;ions in that quarter, en|joining them to have the beef examined, and to have &s;uch as was &s;poiled, &s;ent out of the city. In&s;tead, however, of adopting this plan, the beef was brought from the cellars into the &s;treet, the barrels opened, and the putrid pickle thrown into the gutters. In &s;ome in&s;tances the examination was made in the cel|lars, and the pickle di&s;po&s;ed of in the &s;ame manner. The gutters which conveyed away this putrid pickle, led to Burling-&s;lip &s;ewer.</P>
<P>THE relative &s;ituation of this &s;ewer, and Cliff-&s;treet is &s;uch that the &s;outherly and &s;outh-ea&s;terly winds, force a current of air through the &s;ewer, car|rying with it the exhalations ari&s;ing from the noxious matters collected together in that place, and having a direction to pa&s;s more immediately up Golden-Hill, and into Cliff-&s;treet; and every per&s;on in that neigh|bourhood with whom I have conver&s;ed, agrees as to the offen&s;ive &s;mell of the air, previous to the ap|pearance of the fever.</P>
<P>ON the 20th of Augu&s;t, the wind, which had been blowing from the north and we&s;t &s;ome days previous, &s;hifted to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and continued to blow from that quarter &s;ome time. In 48 hours after this, there was &s;carcely a hou&s;e in Pearl-&s;treet, near where the &s;poiled provi&s;ions were &s;tored, in the lower end of
<PB N="97" REF="035161_0095_1000C345C30EBAE8">
John-&s;treet, and in Cliff-&s;treet, which did not contain &s;ick.</P>
<P>THE &s;udden appearance of fever in this part of the city, and the great number which were affected in &s;o &s;hort a time, proves the local nature of the cau&s;e; and to the one which I have ju&s;t mentioned, I have no he&s;itation, in a&s;cribing all the effects which were experienced.</P>
<P>IF what we have alledged, be admitted &s;ufficient to explain the appearance of Fever which took place in Cliff-&s;treet, &amp;c. we have made &s;ome advances to|wards accounting for the general prevalence of the di&s;ea&s;e in 1798.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide the H. Office corre&s;pondence on the &s;ubject of &s;poiled provi&s;ions.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT, Gentlemen, we have further to remark, a particular difference in the warm &s;ea&s;ons, of 1798 and 1795.</P>
<P>IN 1795 the weather was warm and moi&s;t, but there was but very little rain.</P>
<P>IN 1798, the weather was not only much warmer, but was accompanied with &s;udden and heavy rains.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after the rains, the Public papers teemed with addre&s;&s;es to the citizens, entreating them to empty their cellars of the water which had collect|ed in them, or the mo&s;t fatal effects would be felt from neglect, or inattention to this circum&s;tance.&mdash;It is not my intention to di&s;pute the opinion advanced by the&s;e writers. But, if the production of di&s;ea&s;e, was to be apprehended from the lodgment of water in places where the &s;un's rays never enter, what ef|fects were to be expected from the ponding of water in tho&s;e numerous lots and yards within this city,
<PB N="98" REF="035161_0096_1000B0B230C3DF18">
which are &s;everal feet below the level of the &s;treets, containing dead animal and vegetable matters, and to which the rays of the &s;un have full acce&s;s? I wi&s;h, you, Gentlemen, to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly upon this compari&s;on, and believe, that whil&s;t tho&s;e &s;unken, undrained lots are &s;uffered to remain in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, unle&s;s cau&s;es cea&s;e to produce their effects, di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t inevitably re&s;ult.</P>
<P>ON examining the records of the Legi&s;lature of this &s;tate, it will be found, that petitions have been preferr|ed to that body, for permi&s;&s;ion to erect mill-dams on certain &s;treams of water in &s;ome of the northern coun|ties, and the prayer of the petitioners has been grant|ed. The con&s;equence was, that con&s;iderable tracts of low grounds in the neighbourhood of the mill-dams, were overflowed in the &s;pring, and after the water had pa&s;&s;ed off, and the &s;urface of tho&s;e grounds were ex|po&s;ed to the influence of the &s;un, exhalations of &s;o baneful a nature aro&s;e, as to produce a fever of the bilious type, which attacked almo&s;t every body within a certain di&s;tance from their &s;ource, and proved very mortal in its effects. The cau&s;e of this &s;ickne&s;s being &s;o obvious, petitions were pre&s;ented to the Legi&s;lature, praying for a redre&s;s of the grievances. To correct the evil, it of cour&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy the mill|dams, and as &s;oon as the waters were unob&s;tructed and allowed to flow in their u&s;ual channel, the conutry be|came as healthy as before.</P>
<P>PERMIT me, Gentlemen, to a&s;k the following que&s;tions:&mdash;If the re&s;ult of exhalations ari&s;ing from grounds which have been covered with water in an open country, has been the production of bilious remitting fevers, attended with con&s;iderable mortality, what re&s;ult ought we to expect from tho&s;e exhalations which ari&s;e from the ponding of water on 150 acres of low grounds and &s;unken yards and lots in a crouded city, and of a &s;outhern a&s;pect?</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="035161_0097_1000C34851221FA8">
BEFORE I conclude, I &s;hall take the liberty of noticing &s;ome of the public mea&s;ures that have been adopted for the removal of cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e in this city. I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to two principal objects:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> THE want of a &s;ufficient de&s;cent on the low grounds along the ea&s;t river, to carry off the waters from the &s;treets, is generally admitted. A con&s;ide|rable quantity of water mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;tagnate in the gutters of the&s;e &s;treets, and al&s;o in the &s;unken pave|ment. In dry weather, this lodgement con&s;i&s;ts princi|pally of water which has been u&s;ed for culinary and other family purpo&s;es, and mu&s;t therefore, be &s;uppo&s;|ed to abound with matters to afford noxious exhala|tions.</P>
<P>BY an ordinance of the Corporation for cleaning the &s;treets, the inhabitants are directed to &s;crape out the dirt and filth collected in the gutters and heap them up in the &s;treets, to be removed by the &s;cavengers <HI>in the cour&s;e of the day.</HI></P>
<P>Now, does this regulation in any degree &s;ub&s;erve the purpo&s;es for which it was ordained? Does not the &s;preading of this dirt and filth, and expo&s;ing new and greater &s;urfaces, increa&s;e the mi&s;chief which the mea|&s;ure was intended to correct? I believe, gentlemen, there will be found no other means to rid the low grounds of this city, from the baneful effects of &s;tag|nant waters, and an accumulation of noxious matters, than their being freely wa&s;hed by currents of water flowing over them.</P>
<P>2d. IN the &s;ame ordinance, the citizens are prohibited from throwing into the &s;treets, from their re&s;pective hou&s;es, cellars, or yards any dirt, filth, or offals whatever, except on certain days. How will this be found, to operate in <HI>removing</HI> the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e? Should we not rather a&s;k, how this will be found to operate in <HI>increa&s;ing</HI> the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e? One mo|ment's
<PB N="100" REF="035161_0098_1000C34B113C6A20">
reflection, I pre&s;ume, will convince us that &s;ome means ought to be adopted to remedy a &s;y&s;tem &s;o fraught with mi&s;chief, and for the&s;e means I take the liberty of referring you to letter 70, addre&s;&s;ed by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Health-Office to the Com|mon Council.</P>
