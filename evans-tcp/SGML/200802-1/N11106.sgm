<P>I HAVE no other apology to offer, for my venturing to appear here upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, nor do I de&s;ire a better, than what ari&s;es from the concern which the late ho|nourable Provincial Congre&s;s had in promoting it. I am con&s;cious they could not chu&s;e me to this &s;ervice, in preference to my reverend fathers and brethren in the mini&s;try, from an apprehen&s;ion of &s;uperior abilities; but that it was owing to a &s;pe|cial connexion with them, and their per&s;ua&s;ion that I had a zeal, for the cau&s;e of liberty, the Con|tinent in general, and the welfare of this Colony in particular, an&s;werable to their own mo&s;t ardent wi&s;hes. I &s;hall endeavour to &s;upport the ju&s;tne&s;s of that per&s;ua&s;ion, by exerci&s;ing a faithfulne&s;s that would have &s;uited the earlie&s;t days of the Coun|try's &s;ettlement; and &s;hall flatter my&s;elf with the mo&s;t candid allowances from &s;o re&s;pectable an au|dience, as oft as my knowledge is &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by zeal, con&s;idering that the la&s;t &s;hould predominate, now that the times call for vigorous unabating exertions.</P>

The text, upon which I &s;hall ground what I have Further to &s;ay, you have in the&s;e words of the prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> recorded in the 30th chap. 20, 21. ver. <HI>Their children al&s;o &s;hall be as aforetime, and their congregation &s;hall be e|&s;tabli&s;hed before me, and I will puni&s;h all that oppre&s;s them; and their nobles &s;hall be of them|&s;elves</HI>&mdash;the &s;entence is not perfected without the addition of&mdash;<HI>and their governor &s;hall proceed from the mid&s;t of them</HI>&mdash;but the wi&s;dom of the Conti|nental Congre&s;s, in which we cheerfully confide, hath re&s;trained me from making it a part of the text. In an abler hand, and &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itter time, it may of it&s;elf, &s;ingle and alone, &s;uffice for a com|plete text, Amen. So let it be.</P>
<P>SIN having entred the world, depraved mankind, and given a pernicious bias to every human heart, the be&s;t con&s;titutions, whether civil or &s;a|cred, do after a while degenerate, the &s;pirit of them departs, they retain only their outward forms, and by degrees lo&s;e even tho&s;e. That millenian &s;tate, in which many believe, could not continue vigor|ous and flouri&s;hing, through the period of a thou&s;|and years, without the con&s;tant miraculous inter|po&s;ition of divine power, in re&s;training and keeping down the corrupt di&s;po&s;ition of mortal men.</P>
<P>The Jewi&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment, both in church and &s;tate, was the ordinance of heaven given in an un|common manner, and, at the time, the be&s;t in the whole world; but it was &s;oon corrupted, and at length &s;o enormou&s;ly, that the patience of God would not &s;pare the people. The Jews were exerci&s;ed with heavy divine judgments for their
<PB N="7" REF="014073_0006_0F92DB785BD11800">
various tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions in civil and &s;acred matters, and at la&s;t carried away captive to a di&s;tant coun|try. However, it was not their de&s;truction, but reformation that the Lord Jehovah intended; and therefore, to encourage their repentance, by let|ting them &s;ee that their ca&s;e was not de&s;perate, and keep them from fainting under their &s;ore trials, the prophet Jeremiah is commi&s;&s;ioned to deliver to them the following gracious &s;oul-reviving me&s;|&s;age, viz. "Thus &s;aith the Lord, behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places: and the city &s;hall be builded upon her own heap&mdash;her former foundation&mdash;and the palace &s;hall remain after the manner thereof. And out of them &s;hall proceed thank&s;giving, and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they &s;hall not be few: I will al&s;o glorify them, and they &s;hall not be &s;mall. Their children al&s;o &s;hall be as aforetime, and their congregation or a&s;&s;em|bly (for they are &s;ynonimous terms) &s;hall be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed before me, and I will puni&s;h all that op|pre&s;s them: and their nobles&mdash;leading men of rank, the intermediate per&s;ons between the a&s;|&s;embly and fir&s;t magi&s;trate in the land&mdash;&s;hall be of them&s;elves; and their governor &s;hall proceed from the mid&s;t of them, and I will cau&s;e him to draw near, and he &s;hall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach un|to me, &s;aith the Lord? And ye &s;hall be my peo|ple, and I will be your God." Here it's pro|mi&s;ed the Jews, by Him, who&s;e veracity might be relied on and who&s;e power could accompli&s;h the even<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their affairs &s;hould be brou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ht back to their original &s;tate, that they &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s

their old form of goverment, and that they &s;hould have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing tho&s;e puni&s;hed, who had in&s;trumentally occa&s;ioned their calamities, for that the Lord him&s;elf would puni&s;h them.</P>
<P>A people, when under national judgments or the iron rod of oppre&s;&s;ion, cannot help looking back to tho&s;e times, when the con&s;titution was in a pro&s;perous and healthy condition&mdash;nor having an attachment to tho&s;e modes of government, to which they had been long habituated, and which they had experienced to be peculiarly favourable to the common rights of human nature, and to have &s;ecured them a greater &s;hare of the &s;ame, than is enjoyed by mankind in general. And when they are encouraged by a divine promi&s;e, to look back to them as what they &s;hall be re-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, they mu&s;t feel the mo&s;t plea&s;ing emotions, next to tho&s;e ari&s;ing from actual enjoyment.</P>
<P>The Jews are told in our text, that <HI>their chil|dren &s;hould be as aforetime.</HI> The word <HI>children</HI> doth not nece&s;&s;arily refer to minors, being fre|quently u&s;ed in a much larger &s;en&s;e: Thus the children of Benjamin means the tribe of Benjamin&mdash;the children of I&s;rael and the children of Judah, the people of I&s;rael and the people of Judah. <HI>Their children</HI> may therefore intend the body of the Jewi&s;h nation; and <HI>their being as aforetime.</HI> their enjoying that former freedom and pro&s;perity with which they were acquainted in the be&s;t days of their political exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The be&s;t times that the Jewi&s;h people ever knew were, I apprehend, tho&s;e of the judges; be|fore
<PB N="9" REF="014073_0008_0F92DB7A10E74540">
their ta&s;te for grandeur, and fooli&s;h fondne&s;s for being like neighbouring &s;tates, made them weary of their plain, &s;imple modes and manners, and put them upon chu&s;ing a <HI>royal</HI> government. During the period of the judges, they were once and again, for their iniquities, given into the hand of oppre&s;&s;ors: but when their vices did not bring them under the divine judgments, they were in the full enjoyment of liberty. Every man's hou&s;e was his ca&s;tle&mdash;every man's property was his own&mdash;he exerci&s;ed a &s;upreme authority under, and over his <HI>own</HI> vine, and his <HI>own</HI> fig-tree; and, wherein he tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed not upon the rights of his fellow creatures, nor interfered with the Mo&s;aic e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, did that which was right in his own eyes, without being &s;ubject to the controul even of a crowned head, much le&s;s of crown officers; for in tho&s;e days there was no king in I&s;rael. He could plant or pluck up; could build or de&s;troy; could go here and there; could exerci&s;e domi|nion over the fi&s;hes of the &s;ea, no le&s;s than over the bea&s;ts of the field; and could trade where and in what he would.</P>
<P>The period of the Judges was not only a time of freedom, but a time of pro&s;perity, viewed both in a civil and &s;acred light. Where fancy, the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h and of the eye, together with the pride of life, captivate the judgment, the Jews may be thought to have been in the greate&s;t pro&s;perity un|der the reign of <HI>Solomon;</HI> when the king made &s;ilver to be in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> as &s;tones, and cedars as &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">comore trees that are in the vale for abundance; when the Jewi&s;h court &s;hone with a &s;uperior and

But had it been really the ca&s;e, would the people of I&s;rael have united as one, in the commencement of the next reign, and have complained, to his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or Re|hoboam, of his grievous &s;ervice and heavy yoke? Would they have been &s;o enraged with Rehobo|am's an&s;wering them roughly, as to forget their fondne&s;s for his grandfather, and to revolt from him, crying out, "What portion have we in Da|vid? neither have we inheritance in the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e: to your tents, O I&s;rael; now &s;ee to thine hou&s;e, David"? Would all the tribes have revolted except Judah and Benjamin, where the &s;eat of go|vernment was e&s;tabli&s;hed, court influence was the greate&s;t, and the inhabitants monopolized the ad|vantage of tho&s;e taxes and impo&s;ts that were col|lected through the kingdom? There is a national pro&s;perity con&s;i&s;ting in &s;uperfluities that catches the imagination of the vulgar, whether in high or low life, but that weakens the internal &s;trength of a people, and breeds many public di&s;orders. And there is a national pro&s;perity form'd out of the temperance, valour, firmne&s;s and virtue of a peo|ple, in ea&s;y though not affluent circum&s;tances&punc; ha|ving enough to make them&s;elves &s;afe and happy, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot to entice others into the attempt of making them a prey. Of this la&s;t kind was the civil pro&s;perity of the Jews in the days of the judges. The nearer a &s;tate approaches to, and the more its confirmed in, this kind of civil pro&s;|perity, the &s;afer and longer, in all probability,
<PB N="11" REF="014073_0010_0F92DB7CE23631A8">
will be the enjoyment of its liberties. But be|&s;ides a civil, the Jews were acquainted with a &s;a|cred pro&s;perity in the days of the judges. Al|lowing for numbers, 'tis probable that religion in the powers of it, never flouri&s;hed more among them, than in the beginning of that period. It is certain that Mo&s;es was not only a lawgiver to, but a judge in I&s;rael. Jo&s;hua &s;ucceeded him in the exerci&s;e of all his power, &s;ubject to the ob&s;er|vance of that law which Mo&s;es had given, by which even Mo&s;es him&s;elf was bound, having re|ceived it from God. The people &s;aid to Jo&s;hua, <HI>all that thou commande&s;t us we will do, and whi|ther&s;oever thou &s;ende&s;t us we will go. According as we hearkned unto Mo&s;es in all things, &s;o will we hearken unto the&punc;</HI> And we further read, that <HI>they &s;erved the Lord all the days of Jo&s;hua, and all the days of the elders that out lived Jo&s;hua, who had &s;een all the great works of the Lord that he did for I&s;rael.</HI> But we are told, that <HI>after all that generation was gathered unto their fathers, there aro&s;e another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for I&s;rael, &s;o that the children of I&s;rael did evil in the &s;ight of the Lord, and &s;erved Baalim, and for|&s;ook the Lord God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods.</HI> The earlie&s;t days of a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate are generally the mo&s;t pure and religious. The prevailing principles of individuals at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, the pro|videncial interpo&s;itions that they are eye witne&s;&s;es to, and are &s;trongly affected with from the pecu|liarity of their &s;ituation, and the modes they are under a nece&s;&s;ity of adopting, lead to it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="014073_0011_0F92DB7DA6A599B8">
Having con&s;ider'd the fir&s;t &s;entence in our text, let us attend to the next, in which the Lord &s;ays, <HI>and their congregation (or a&s;&s;embly) &s;hall be e&s;tab|li&s;hed before me.</HI> The Jews having a fixt code of laws, and a provi&s;ion for con&s;ulting and knowing the mind of the Lord upon &s;pecial occa&s;ions, they needed not as other free governments, an hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives or a&s;&s;embly. But they had three grand fe&s;tivals annually, when all the males, who&s;e age and health admitted, repaired to Jeru|&s;alem. The enjoyment of the&s;e &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, calculated, to keep up the remembrance of what great things God had done for them, at the com|mencement of their national exi&s;tence, to promote mutual affection by bringing individuals from the mo&s;t di&s;tant part of the land into an acquaintance with each other, and to afford them an opportunity for promoting any &s;chemes for public utility, was con&s;idered as a ble&s;&s;ing and not as a burden by the wi&s;e and prudent. The re&s;toration and con|firmation of the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons, after they had been in|terrupted by the captivity, is therefore enumera|ted in the catalogue of mercies with which the Jews were to be favoured. The congregation or a&s;&s;embly of the people, before the Lord in the ca|pital of the country &s;hould be fixt and confirmed; be made certain and perpetual. The Jewi&s;h fe&s;|tivals &s;hould be again ob&s;erved with the voice of joy and the voice of gladne&s;s, without the hazard of a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; and &s;hould be even heightned by the exemplary puni&s;hment, that the Lord would inflict upon tho&s;e that oppre&s;&s;ed the Jews.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014073_0012_0F92DB7E578C6588">
Thus &s;aith the Lord, <HI>I will puni&s;h all that op|pre&s;s them</HI> Was it ab&s;olutely unlawful for a peo|ple to wi&s;h for the puni&s;hment of tho&s;e, who have been the in&s;trumental occa&s;ion of their calamities, or to have a plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction in finding that they are puni&s;hed, we cannot imagine that the &s;ame would be promi&s;ed&punc; in order to &s;ooth the &s;ufferings of the oppre&s;&s;ed. Some may indulge a private revengeful malicious &s;pirit again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors, which neither &s;cripture nor rea&s;on will ju&s;tify: but an attachment to one's country, the cau&s;e of truth and equity, and the rights of man|kind&mdash;the love of ju&s;tice&mdash;a de&s;ire of benefiting the earth by public examples&mdash;and the expectation that the providential government of God will be thereby glorified, may lead us to hope that pu|ni&s;hment will be inflicted, though not upon all, yet upon the chief promoters of our oppre&s;&s;ion, and that they will not be &s;uffered to e&s;cape God's righteous judgments in this world; while in the &s;pirit of true chri&s;tianity we pray, that they may be brought to that un&s;eigned repentance and ge|nuine faith, which by intere&s;ting them in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, &s;hall procure them an e&s;cape from the puni&s;hments of hell, and rai&s;e them to the joys of heaven. While the Lord promi&s;es the Jews to puni&s;h all that op|pre&s;&s;ed them, He gives them no intimation of the manner in which he would do it. They might be apt to wi&s;h that he would puni&s;h in &s;ome certain particular way, preferable to all others: but in this they might be di&s;appointed Infinite wi&s;dom often varies the mode of puni&s;hment.

and to accommodate them&s;elves to it, to &s;tudy the intere&s;ts, and to promote the happine&s;s, of the people among whom they re&s;ide.

<P>Suffer me, ye worthy Repre&s;entatives of the People, and this re&s;pectable audience, to &s;pend a few minutes in conjecturing how it was with the colony in the earlie&s;t days of its exi&s;tence. The love of liberty, but chiefly of religion, induced the fir&s;t &s;ettlers to venture acro&s;s the atlantic, and to take up their abode in this then inho&s;pitable wilderne&s;s.
