<P>THE following chri&s;tian experiences falling into my hands, I thought well to collect and put them into &s;ome order for the peru&s;al of others.</P>
<P>She led an exemplary life, being watch|ful over her&s;elf, and zealous for the pro&s;|perity of Truth; her mind was &s;o much to its centre, and her attention &s;o inward, that &s;he often drew others, by her awful &s;itting, into &s;ilence in friends' families; and, as her cup overflowed, &s;he mini&s;tered to them as one having authority; &s;o that it may be truly &s;aid, &s;he was fervent in &s;pirit, &s;erving the Lord.</P>
<P>Ample accounts have been received of her &s;ervice both in England and America, in which the Lord was plea&s;ed to ble&s;s her labour and &s;anctify it to many.</P>
<P>She mourned for the obvious declen&s;ion of our &s;ociety from its primitive &s;implicity
<PB N="iv" REF="030834_0003_0FE99F73D83E19B8">in manners and conduct; often declaring, that ere it &s;hone again in its ancient beauty, the rubbi&s;h mu&s;t be removed, that there mu&s;t be a divi&s;ion between the precious and the vile, tho&s;e who &s;erved the Lord and tho&s;e who &s;erved him not; but before this day come, greater degrees of darkne&s;s would prevail among&s;t us as a people, and more of the night come upon us before the day of beauty and reformation would again revive in &s;plendour. And, therefore, &s;he was fervently engaged that the faithful eve|ry where might &s;tand upon their watch, and di&s;charge them&s;elves as watchmen and watchwomen upon the walls of Zion, hav|ing their armour on and their lights burn|ing, to be able to di&s;cover, as well as oppo&s;e, the approach of the enemy.</P>
<P>The latter part of her time &s;he was at|tended with much bodily weakne&s;s and in|di&s;po&s;ition, which often rendered her unfit for travelling; the&s;e &s;he called vi&s;itations of the mercy of God to her &s;oul, in order to pre&s;erve her to Him&s;elf, and &s;tain the beauty and glory of this world in her view, that her affections might be weaned from

<HEAD>SOME ACCOUNT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MARY NEALE, otherwi&s;e Pei&s;ley, daughter of Peter and Rachel Pei&s;ley, was born in the year 1717, at Ballymore in the county of Kildare, in Ireland, and educated in the &s;ociety of the people called Quakers; but a di&s;po&s;ition to keep company unre|&s;trained by the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, let her from truth's &s;implicity in manners and be|haviour, whereof &s;he thus expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf:</P>
<Q><P>I count it an infinite mercy and high favour, that the omnipotent God &s;uffered not the thread of my life to be cut, dur|ing the many years that I lived in di&s;obe|dience to his holy will; and tho' often, by the operation of his grace, inwardly touched and convicted of my errors, and the veil &s;o far rent from off my under|&s;tanding, as to let me &s;ee that I &s;tood on the brink of ruin, yet did I as often &s;uffer the enemy and adver&s;ary of my &s;oul again to darken my under&s;tanding, and benumb my &s;piritual feeling; and the
<PB N="8" REF="030834_0006_0FE99F8062AABD98">tumultuous noi&s;es, plea&s;ures and allure|ments of this world &s;tifled the intelligence of the &s;till &s;mall voice, which would have directed me, &s;aying, this is the way, walk in it. Our meeting al&s;o was favoured with a living and powerful mini&s;try, which I often &s;lighted; thus have I, with my hard and impenitent heart, &s;toned his prophets, and by my unbelief and uncir|cumci&s;ed &s;pirit, per&s;ecuted them that were &s;ent to declare and proclaim the glad tidings of the go&s;pel; to invite and call to tho&s;e who were in captivity, held by the chains of &s;in, to come away to the glorious liberty of the Truth. I have to remember, as an inexpre&s;&s;ible favour and mercy to my &s;oul, that in the height of all my vanity and &s;tupidity, I was not &s;uffered to run into the gro&s;s enormities of the world: I was kept from tho&s;e loud, crying, hardening, black crimes, which, had I run into, might &s;o highly provoke my Creator, as to have cau&s;ed him to &s;ay in his wrath, "Thou &s;halt not enter into my re&s;t."</P>
<P>A &s;hort time before my conver&s;ion I had a fall from my hor&s;e, by which I was apparently in danger of having my neck disjointed, and a &s;udden end put to my life; as &s;oon as I aro&s;e on my feet and recovered my &s;en&s;es, the Lord by his
<PB N="9" REF="030834_0007_0FE99F825FCE74C0">grace and good Spirit, &s;howed me clearly that I was not in a fit condition to meet him, the ju&s;t and holy Judge of heaven and earth, and cau&s;ed me &s;olidly to con|&s;ider the di&s;mal con&s;equence of being hurried off the &s;tage of mortality in an unprepared &s;tate, the impre&s;&s;ion of which never left my mind till God, by his grace, had made me more fit for his king|dom, the glory of which be given to his everla&s;ting name.</P></Q>
<P>About this time two friends in the &s;er|vice of truth, appointed a meeting, with|in the compa&s;s of that in which &s;he re&s;ided. Their awful, reverent &s;itting before the Lord, waiting upon him for his pre&s;ence and aid, &s;truck her in an unu&s;ual manner, rai&s;|ing in her mind a fervent enquiry after the revelation of the Father, through his Son. She had often heard tell of the comforts of the holy Spirit, the in&s;truction of the light that comes by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the way of &s;piritual wor&s;hip: but &s;till remained a &s;tran|ger to the true manner of &s;eeking and breath|ing after it, in her own experience. She has expre&s;&s;ed how deeply her mind was af|fected, by the &s;ilent and humble waiting of the before-mentioned friends, and by the o|peration of the univer&s;al principle of grace &s;hed in her heart, that &s;he was arou&s;ed to
<PB N="10" REF="030834_0008_0FE99F8406999340">enquire for her&s;elf; and as &s;he pre&s;&s;ed to wi&s;dom's gate her &s;eeking mind was &s;atisfi|ed.</P>
<P>During this di&s;pen&s;ation of inward en|quiry, &s;he was helped forward to diligence by the mini&s;try of &s;ome of the Lord's me&s;|&s;engers, who &s;poke comfortably to her &s;tate, and encouraged her in per&s;everance and well-doing, &s;peaking prophetically, that the Lord would rai&s;e up in that meeting &s;ome that &s;hould bear his name among the Gen|tiles, and be the me&s;&s;enger of peace and glad tidings to the people, if obedience and faithfulne&s;s to the heavenly manife&s;tations were kept to.</P>
<P>By an humble re&s;ignation to the divine will to form the ve&s;&s;el in what manner the heavenly potter plea&s;ed, the work went for|ward pro&s;perou&s;ly, and &s;he appears to have been an in&s;tance of great fervency and de|votedne&s;s to whatever the divine influence dictated, watchful to hear the voice, and obedient to fulfil the command, tho' it was in giving up that which might be as a right hand or a right eye.</P>
<P>Her entrance into the work of the mini|&s;try was about the beginning of the year 1744, near which time &s;he had unexpected dome&s;tic trials, which brought her very
<PB N="11" REF="030834_0009_0FE99F859C9B8068">low in mind, from a &s;en&s;e of the &s;ingularity of her &s;ituation, but her tru&s;t being in the Lord, &s;he was eminently &s;upported, and writes thus to a friend.</P>
<Q>I doubt not but thou art touched in &s;ome degree with a &s;en&s;e of my deep and heavy afflictions, which are of various kinds; many are the probations which I have pa&s;&s;ed through and &s;till am under. I can by no means &s;et forth the wi&s;e, pru|dent, and merciful manner that my ten|der and heavenly Father has dealt with me, by fortifying my mind beforehand, and likewi&s;e &s;upporting and upholding me under my trials; was it not in the infi|nitene&s;s of his wi&s;dom, and boundle&s;s mercy that he &s;tained the beauty of this world in my eyes, wiped off the varni&s;h and gilding, and let me &s;ee before they were &s;natched from me, that they were but momentary, fading enjoyments, and the greate&s;t and be&s;t of them were but &s;hort-lived ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;hadows that would vani&s;h away? neither did his kind|ne&s;s end there, for he likewi&s;e &s;howed me what was &s;ub&s;tance, a pearl of ine&s;ti|mable value, at the &s;ight of which my &s;oul was &s;o tran&s;ported that I cried out in an extacy of joy, "Cau&s;e me, Lord, to po&s;&s;e&s;s this trea&s;ure, and in lieu of it dive&s;t me of whatever &s;eems good in thy
<PB N="12" REF="030834_0010_0FE99F8D56396C30">&s;ight;" this was my covenant with the King of Kings.&mdash;So great was the goodne&s;s of my God, di&s;pen&s;ed and pro|portioned in wi&s;dom, that he did not at that time reveal him&s;elf to me in &s;o full a manner as he has &s;ince done; at a time when I mo&s;t of all wanted it; in my deep|e&s;t plungings, he has cau&s;ed my &s;oul to ta&s;te of joys and con&s;olations which I was before a &s;tranger to; nor would I have pre&s;umed to a&s;k for the favours of pati|ence, and re&s;ignation, and fortitude of mind, which he has unde&s;ervedly be&s;tow|ed on me, an unworthy creature.</Q>
<P>An opportunity pre&s;ented for her to re|&s;ide in the family of a friend, within the compa&s;s of Mountmelick meeting, of who&s;e daughter &s;he had the care; in this &s;tation &s;he continued for &s;ome time, until &s;he ap|prehended her&s;elf thereby deprived, in &s;ome degree, of a full liberty to exerci&s;e the gift received, and to live to him alone that had quickened her anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; at which time &s;he writes thus to a relati|on: <Q>I am re&s;olved, by the ble&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of I&s;rael's God, not to bury that ta|lent, which he has given me, in the earth, nor to quit the occupying of it for any out|ward occupation; better would it be for me to wander as the prophets formerly did&mdash;de&s;titute, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and naked,
<PB N="13" REF="030834_0011_0FE99F8F8F493158">than to &s;ell an unfading inheritance, for any pro&s;pect of advantage here; for I am &s;ure to drudge for the &s;u&s;tenance of the body, as do the bea&s;ts, and to live for no nobler ends, than to eat, drink and &s;leep: &s;uch a life is not worth living for; not that I am again&s;t moderate, hone&s;t indu&s;|try, for I am convinced it is good for both body and mind.</Q></P>
<P>About this time a concern attended her mind, to vi&s;it friends of the three provinces, which &s;he pretty generally performed in company with Elizabeth Tomey of Lime|rick, in &s;weet unity and concord. They met with low times and &s;ea&s;ons, deep bap|ti&s;m of &s;pirit, and travailed for and with the &s;eed, and at times were &s;et at liberty, in the authority and power of truth, to mi|ni&s;ter unto the various cla&s;&s;es of the people. Of the quarterly meeting of Ul&s;ter province held in Lurgan, &s;he gives the following ac|count: <Q>We attended the meeting of mi|ni&s;ters and elders, where we had clo&s;e work, but the power of the Lord upheld us above the fear of man. Next day had &s;ome encouragement to the faithful and well minded, but could not that day reach the libertine &s;pirit, but waited for renewed &s;trength from the Lord, to en|gage again&s;t the Goliaths, who defy the armies of the living God, The day af|ter,
<PB N="14" REF="030834_0012_0FE99F914D88C090">being Fir&s;t-day, we &s;at in a low, hum|ble, depending &s;tate, until the Lord gave the &s;pirit of &s;upplication, after which his power was &s;et over all, and te&s;timony borne to his name, and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors were &s;howed their errors in the demon&s;tration of the Lord's &s;pirit and power.</Q></P>
<P>After this journey &s;he went to re&s;ide with a relation in Borris, from whence &s;he writes as follows: <Q>I am at times concerned for the whole bulk of mankind, but in a more particular manner for my kindred according to the fle&s;h, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e who were my companions in my former vanities, as well knowing what the life I then led would have ended in, had not my God, in his infinite mercy, opened my eyes, and &s;topped my race to ruin; and though I was in the broad way that leads to de&s;truction, yet was I innocent of, and free from, the gro&s;s enormities that are in the world, and be|cau&s;e thereof the enemy per&s;uaded me, that I was &s;afe enough; but alas! I found I was living as without God in the world, in forgetfulne&s;s of him; a &s;tranger and unregenerate; in &s;hort, that I was an enemy to God, and under his ju&s;t wrath and di&s;plea&s;ure; and now I may &s;ay, that I am jealous with a godly jealou&s;y, that thou art yet in that unregenerate &s;tate and
<PB N="15" REF="030834_0013_0FE99F9645BFB9B8">condition: thou wilt &s;ay, perhaps, thou art not called to the &s;ame work that I have been called to, <HI>viz.</HI> the work of the mini&s;try, and have no need to know what I have experienced. If this &s;hould be &s;ugge&s;ted to thy mind, it is of the ene|my, for if thou ha&s;t not been called to bear a public te&s;timony, thou ha&s;t, I doubt not, been called to holine&s;s, with|out which we are told, "no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." Thou ha&s;t the &s;ame pure, holy God to fear, the &s;ame &s;ubtil, un|wearied enemy to war again&s;t, a &s;oul as precious, and that mu&s;t abide as long as mine, either in happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, there|fore, it behoves thee to be as &s;trict in thy life, and as holy in thy conver&s;ation, as any other, that &s;o thou maye&s;t be a ter|ror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e and encou|rager of them that do well. For I am &s;ure if we be lovers and true followers of Je&s;us, we cannot take plea&s;ure in hearing his great name profaned, and taken in vain: and the company that are guilty of &s;uch things we &s;hould carefully avoid, as we would an infectious per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is, I think, impo&s;&s;ible to be frequent in ill company, without being &s;omewhat leavened into the &s;ame &s;pirit, except we keep a &s;trict watch, and have our minds armed with the pure armour of light and
<PB N="16" REF="030834_0014_0FE99F9C85C99528">righteou&s;ne&s;s. This alone can make us proof again&s;t the fiery darts of the wick|ed; which in&s;en&s;ibly pierce and wound the unwary &s;oul. It is our intere&s;t and duty, all in our power, carefully to avoid temptations, for tho&s;e that we mu&s;t ine|vitably meet with are enough for us poor, weak creatures, to grapple with. Take care of poi&s;oning thy mind with vain and idle books, for I know them, by experi|ence, to be very pernicious; let thy lei|&s;ure hours be &s;pent in retirement, and reading the holy &s;criptures, with other good books. Remember thou art the head of a family, and it behoves thee to have a &s;uperadded care, for if thy exam|ple be not good, thou wilt have much to an&s;wer for. Watch over thy &s;i&s;ters in love, and be not an in&s;trument of bring|ing evil company in their way: there is an evil thou art guilty of that is vi&s;ible to more than me, and that is thy &s;lighting and neglecting week-day meetings: If thou had appointed a day to meet any of tho&s;e &s;tyled noblemen of the earth, and thou &s;lighted and neglected the appoint|ments for weeks, yea, months together, would it not be a great affront and indig|nity to them? yea, and I am per&s;uaded thou would not do it, for fear of offend|ing them; and is the King of Kings and Lord of heaven and earth, le&s;s noble,
<PB N="17" REF="030834_0015_0FE99F9E45F373E8">le&s;s di&s;cerning, when he is &s;lighted and neglected? I ob&s;erve thou ha&s;t time and lei&s;ure to ride many miles to &s;ports and diver&s;ions, &s;uch as hunting, hor&s;e-racing, and other &s;ights; does not this &s;how thou art a lover of plea&s;ure more than a lover of God, &s;uch as the apo&s;tle declares are dead while they live? Dear cou&s;in, bear with my dealing thus plainly; I have no view in it, but the good of thy immor|tal &s;oul, and the ea&s;e of my own mind, and I &s;incerely wi&s;h that thou and I may be prepared for our great and final change.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We have daily in&s;tances of young and &s;trong being &s;natched away in their bloom as with their bones full of marrow: and why may it not be our ca&s;e? we cannot promi&s;e our&s;elves one hour to come, the pre&s;ent time is only ours, and Oh! it is a di&s;mal con&s;equence to launch into eter|nity unprepared, where the worm never dieth, nor is the fire quenched: If we are &s;o fond of a few tran&s;itory plea&s;ures in this world, how can we bear to be &s;hut out from eternal felicity, and doomed to everla&s;ting mi&s;ery? I be&s;eech thee &s;olidly to con&s;ider the&s;e things, and I pray the God of love and mercy to give thee a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding heart.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="030834_0016_0FE99F9FD6D67B38">About the 8th month 1747, &s;he return|ed to Mountmelick, to the hou&s;e of her friend where &s;he before re&s;ided. Her con|tinuance here was for a few months, dur|ing which time &s;he was attacked with a di&s;|order in her &s;tomach, which occa&s;ioned great weakne&s;s, and brought her very low. In a letter to a friend &s;he thus expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf: <Q>I gratefully acknowledge thy unmerited kindne&s;s in the concern thou &s;howe&s;t for my health; I am &s;en&s;ible it is our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to endeavour to pre&s;erve life and health, by all lawful means that Providence is plea&s;ed to af|ford; were it not &s;o, I often think, that mine is not worth caring for; in&s;tead of being u&s;eful to any, I fear I &s;hall be a burden to the creation, and mi&s;s the end of my being; &s;urely none whom he hath &s;ent into life, and vi&s;ited with his match|le&s;s love and kindne&s;s, is more weak and unworthy than I am; and were it &s;o that he, by his divine power, was plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of me, in any good work, it was all his own, of and from him alone; I could have no part in it, but as pa&s;&s;ive clay in his hand; and ble&s;&s;ed be his name, he is not limited, nor his power confined to any in&s;truments; he that found me in a polluted &s;tate, can rai&s;e up and &s;anctify many more for his work and &s;ervice, and that he may in the&s;e dark and perilous
<PB N="19" REF="030834_0017_0FE99FA362AEB150">days, is the travail of my afflicted &s;oul.</Q> During this di&s;pen&s;ation &s;he wrote as fol|lows to her brother, who had frequenty occa&s;ioned much anxiety and di&s;quietude to her mind:
<LETTER>
<P>Dear brother, for &s;o thou art by nature to me, would to God thou wert &s;o in a two-fold &s;en&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> by adop|tion or new creation in Chri&s;t, which far exceeds all the ties of affinity or con&s;an|guinity, and will la&s;t beyond the grave, never, never to be di&s;&s;olved; may thou happily experience this, before time to thee here be no more, for which end Providence has, in matchle&s;s love and conde&s;cen&s;ion, wonderfully prolonged thy days, amid&s;t imminent dangers and diffi|culties: may this be deeply pondered and wi&s;ely laid to heart by thee; otherwi&s;e it will add weight in the balance again&s;t thee, in the great and notable day of account, that ha&s;tens on us both. Thou knowe&s;t, dear brother, it has often been my con|cern thus to remind and call thee to the important bu&s;ine&s;s of life, and thy ne|glect of it has almo&s;t di&s;couraged me from further attempts; this may perhaps be the la&s;t; and I do, with all the ar|dency my &s;oul is capable of, joined with natural affection, earne&s;tly de&s;ire it may have the wi&s;hed-for effect. I am in a very poor &s;tate of health, and little hu|man probability of my being re&s;tored.

<P>About this time &s;he felt a weighty con|cern to vi&s;it the churches in England; and having obtained the concurrence of her friends, accompanied by Elizabeth Hutch|in&s;on, &s;he &s;et forward from Mountmelick in the 7th month, 1748. They attended the province meeting held at Carlow, and went from thence to Baltibois, where they had a ble&s;&s;ed helping meeting. The te&s;ti|mony went forth to tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties. They had a meeting at Timahoe, and went thence to Dublin, where they had refre&s;h|ing and comfortable meetings, the Lord's eternal truth being over all: "We were," &s;he expre&s;&s;es in a journal kept of this jour|ney, <Q>comforted one in another, and ena|bled renewedly to ble&s;s the name of the Lord. The 27th of 7mo. we took &s;hip
<PB N="23" REF="030834_0021_0FE99FAF9F685050">for Whitehaven, and landed there the 28th; the 30th went to Pard&s;haw, where was held the quarterly meeting for Cum|berland; the public meeting proved a glorious one, and was a time of &s;olid wor&s;hip: the te&s;timony of truth was ex|alted over all, and the everla&s;ting go&s;pel freely preached. After this meeting I had great con&s;olation of &s;oul, and we &s;pent the evening in company with &s;eve|ral friends, in agreeable, edifying conver|&s;ation, and in much freedom and open|ne&s;s of &s;pirit. Next day, being the fir&s;t of the week, we went to their general meeting at Cockermouth, the 3d to Whitehaven, low and depre&s;&s;ed in &s;pirit. Next day had a meeting there, in which I cleared my&s;elf; was led therein to &s;et forth the call and qualification of a true go&s;pel mini&s;ter; left it in peace of mind, but much &s;pent in body with the &s;ervice thereof. The 5th had a meeting in Bronghton, where we were led to &s;peak clo&s;ely to &s;ome who had been vi&s;ited in their young years, and were now grown lukewarm and indifferent. The 6th had a good meeting at I&s;ell, though &s;mall. Next day were at Ke&s;wick, the &s;ervice chiefly to tho&s;e not of our &s;ociety; had &s;ome clo&s;e things to deliver to tho&s;e that were. The 9th at Allonby, whither came many friends from other meetings, to
<PB N="24" REF="030834_0022_0FE99FB31BBE3028">whom truth was fully declared. From hence to Holme, where we had a &s;ilent meeting, and under&s;tood they &s;eldom &s;at free from di&s;turbers. The 10th had a low &s;ea&s;on at Kirkbride, the 11th at Bol|ton, the 12th at Wigton, which was large, but low as to the dominion of life; next day had a meeting at Moore|hou&s;e, things clo&s;e and hard to deliver; at Carli&s;le, we had a good open meeting, my mind being much enlarged among&s;t them, yet felt a concern re&s;t with me to have another meeting in that city, which friends readily agreed to. The 15th had a meeting at Kirklington, which was large and &s;atisfactory, and another at Car|li&s;le in the evening: in con&s;equence of the concern already mentioned, there came a great number of the town's folk; when I got there I found my&s;elf &s;o weak in body and poor in &s;pirit, and the peo|ple &s;o un&s;ettled in their minds, that I al|mo&s;t feared I &s;hould not be able to an&s;wer the &s;ervice of the meeting. I earne&s;tly de&s;ired that the cau&s;e and te&s;timony of truth might not &s;uffer, let me &s;uffer what I might; I had not &s;at long, till I found a flow of doctrine open in my mind; I &s;tood up in the fear of the Lord, and the people &s;oon became quiet and &s;olid; I was &s;trengthened beyond my ex|pectation, and the meeting ended well;
<PB N="25" REF="030834_0023_0FE99FB9C8BE1538">and ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord, I had great peace and &s;atisfaction after it was over. Went hence to Scotby, and had a meeting; &s;o to Ann Greenup's, and was at the monthly meeting in that quarter, where my mind was under much &s;uffering; but as I waited, the power of truth aro&s;e, and I found ea&s;e and liberty of mind; was led in a very clo&s;e man|ner; the &s;eed had dominion, and the au|thority of truth was over all. Went next day to Mo&s;edale, and had a travailing &s;ea&s;on in that meeting: thence to Terrill, and had a poor meeting there; thence to I&s;aac Thomp&s;on's, being very poor in &s;pi|rit and low in mind. Next day, we re&s;t|ed, &s;pending the day much in retirement, which proved very helpful to me; and as I waited on the Lord to have my &s;piritual &s;trength renewed, felt a concern to have a meeting with the inhabitants, and one in the afternoon at Penrith on Fir&s;t-day. After I had well con&s;idered and weighed the&s;e things, the friend, with whom we lodged, &s;aid; they were a people of no religion, which did not di&s;courage me, for it immediately aro&s;e in my mind, that, they had the more need of help, and that, perhaps, they might more readily receive the truth, than tho&s;e who were more bigotted to ceremonies. We went to Penrith next morning; the friends
<PB N="26" REF="030834_0024_0FE99FBB79493CC8">a&s;ked me if I would have an afternoon meeting, I replied that, I could better tell at the conclu&s;ion of the fir&s;t meeting. We went to meeting and it proved a good one, for truth had dominion and was over all; then I felt &s;trength to have an afternoon meeting appointed, which was large and to great &s;atisfaction, &s;ome of the town's folks being at the forenoon meeting, and the town pretty large, the report &s;pread and the people came till the hou&s;e could hold no more, with conve|nience; after this I &s;poke of the meeting which my mind was drawn to propo&s;e at Amenbridge, where a friend &s;aid there had been none before; friends &s;eemed willing, but knew of no place to hold it in, except the hou&s;e where we lodged, which was large enough, and would have done well for the purpo&s;e, but the friend &s;aid he could not admit of it, for fear of his landlord, who was a prie&s;t; I &s;aid, I could not force their hearts nor hou&s;es, but hoped, as I had laid it before them, I &s;hould be made ea&s;y; and if not, I did not doubt that if I went to &s;ome of tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed not with us, I &s;hould be accommodated; he &s;aid, there was a town a mile off, that he thought would an&s;wer better for a meeting, and that their town's people would go thither; I told him I dare not go in my own will to have meet|ings
<PB N="27" REF="030834_0025_0FE99FBF221A9F10">where I plea&s;ed, but where truth led me; he replied, if the folks of Penrith heard of the meeting, the &s;treets, much le&s;s the hou&s;e, would not hold them; then, &s;aid I, we may go to the fields. This, I believe, &s;tirred him up&mdash;he went away, and in a &s;hort time returned, and told me not to be unea&s;y, I &s;hould have a meeting; and accordingly it was ap|pointed to begin at 6 o'clock next even|ing at another friend's hou&s;e in the town, which proved quite too &s;mall. They made all the room they could in two apartments and a hall, but many were at the windows who could not get in. We had a meeting at Strickland in the fore|noon, which had before been appointed. When I came to &s;ee and &s;it among&s;t the people at Amenbridge, they &s;eemed &s;o ignorant of our manner of wor&s;hip and principles, that my faith almo&s;t failed to doing any &s;ervice, or admini&s;tering help to them. After &s;ome time of waiting for divine aid, I &s;tood up, and they appeared to me as &s;till and attentive while I was &s;peaking, as ever I ob&s;erved any a&s;&s;embly. I laboured among&s;t them till my natural &s;trength failed, and after meeting was over, I had great inward peace and com|fort. Next day we waited for their monthly meeting at Ald&s;tone, and paid a vi&s;it to a friend's family, where we had a
<PB N="28" REF="030834_0026_0FE99FC409DFF058">&s;weet con&s;olatory opportunity; and &s;ame evening went towards Northumberland. The 25th we continued our journey, a very difficult and dangerous road; much of it mountainous, and though reckoned but 14 miles, it took from 9 in the morn|ing till 6 in the evening, &s;aye that we &s;topped a little to refre&s;h our&s;elves: my mind was pre&s;erved tranquil and ea&s;y. Next day we had a hard, laborious meet|ing, but I was mercifully helped through, to the ea&s;e of my own mind, The fol|lowing day went to Cornwood, where had a meeting. The 27th rode to Allen|dale, and the way being rough and moun|tainous, it was dangerous. My compa|nion was thrown from her hor&s;e, and I &s;eemed in imminent danger, the way be|ing narrow, and a con&s;iderable precipice ju&s;t by where my hor&s;e &s;tood, which be|ing interrupted by my companion's fall|ing, was very unea&s;y; but at length, through the merciful interpo&s;ition of Pro|vidence, &s;he was taken up, very little hurt, and they got me &s;afe off my hor&s;e. We arrived wearied with fright and fa|tigue. In a &s;hort time friends got toge|ther, and we had a comfortable, good meeting, which amply made amends for all we went through. The 28th had a large meeting. My Spirit was under deep &s;uffering before I went to it, and for &s;ome
<PB N="29" REF="030834_0027_0FE99FC76E259170">time after but, through divine aid, I fully cleared my&s;elf. When I came to my lodging, I was under a bapti&s;m of &s;pirit, and could not tell the cau&s;e. I examined my&s;elf, and brought things to the clo&s;e&s;t &s;crutiny, to know whether I had done or committed any thing con|trary to truth, but could find no con|demnation. At dinner, I felt the &s;pirit of &s;upplication, which I gave way to, and found my mind free and ea&s;y. Next morning the 29th &s;et out for Benfield; it was &s;uch hard weather, friends would have had us &s;tay, but as the meeting was appointed I could not be ea&s;y &s;o to do. It blew &s;uch a violent &s;torm, that it was with difficulty we could &s;it our hor&s;es, or they keep their feet, being &s;everal times blown out of the path. It was 14 miles over a black moor, where there was no &s;helter; our guides mi&s;&s;ed the way twice, once on the open moor. My companion, who was a young traveller, was di&s;cou|raged, &s;topped &s;everal times, wept and &s;aid, &s;he thought &s;he could hold it no longer. I encouraged her to hold out to the end, and told her, there was no abiding there. By the Lord's mercy, my mind was kept quiet and &s;till, and about 7 at night we got &s;afe to our quar|ters, where we had an hearty welcome. The meeting was appointed to begin at 9
<PB N="30" REF="030834_0028_0FE99FC9935D4A68">next morning; it was &s;mall, but greatly to my &s;atisfaction. I was led in particu|lar to &s;ome per&s;on who was under a temp|tation to join in marriage with one of another &s;ociety, and likewi&s;e to declare that I had no outward information. Af|ter meeting, an elderly friend told me, that I had hit the mark to an hair's breadth, for there was a young man, whom he knew was under &s;uch a tempta|tion, and had been advi&s;ed again&s;t it. Went that night to Newca&s;tle, upon Tyne, 11 miles, &s;taid there &s;everal days, had a good meeting on 5th day, being 3d of 9th mo. though &s;ome &s;tates hard to &s;peak to, there being &s;ome dei&s;tical prin|ciples, I believe, cheri&s;hed among&s;t them; and &s;o clo&s;e was the te&s;timony, that they could &s;carcely bear to &s;it. After this meeting, a friend told me I had &s;poken by revelation, but was &s;o prudent as to &s;ay no more, as we were to &s;tay until after the next Fir&s;t-day, to equip our&s;elves for continuing our journey. In the interim vi&s;ited the aged, who were confined with weakne&s;s. Fir&s;t day truth eminently helped with its ancient beauty and bright|ne&s;s, di&s;pelling all mi&s;ts and clouds; a glorious time it was to the comfort and edification of the church; the afternoon meeting was very full of friends, and tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties. It proved to me
<PB N="31" REF="030834_0029_0FE99FCE93A68098">a &s;weet con&s;olating time; the &s;pring of life being opened for my own help and furtherance in be&s;t things; but had not any thing to communicate to the people. The 6th went to Shields, and had a &s;mall meeting. In the evening went to Sunder|land. The 7th had a meeting in the fore|noon, to an increa&s;e of comfort, and prai&s;e to him that exalts his own te&s;timony in the hearts of his children, and gives tongue and utterance to magnify his name and power: Had a refre&s;hing &s;ea&s;on in the family where we lodged, the Lord breaking to us the bread of life for the nouri&s;hment of our &s;ouls, and after had an evening meeting appointed which was large and to good &s;atisfaction. The 8th had a meeting at Shotton. The 9th at Durham, the 10th at Auckland, which was a good meeting, and I felt a concern to have another there in the afternoon, of which I acquainted the friend with whom we lodged; he pleaded many ex|cu&s;es; I told him, I apprehended it was not the bu&s;ine&s;s of a mini&s;ter to proceed contrary to the minds of friends, e&s;peci|ally one &s;o young as I; and that, as I had told my concern, I hoped I &s;hould be ea&s;y; and, if not, I could but come back again. My mind was &s;oon relieved of its burden; as the Lord my God knew my willingne&s;s to obey him, he required no
<PB N="32" REF="030834_0030_0FE99FD1ED640690">impo&s;&s;ibility of me. Next day went &s;ix miles to Raby, and had a large meeting there, &s;everal friends coming from divers places to meet us; but that &s;pirit that ob&s;tructs the &s;pring of the mini&s;try, was among&s;t them, and made it hard to &s;peak; though, by Divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I was enabled to clear my&s;elf, and came a|way with peace of mind. My compani|on was &s;o ill that &s;he was detained from meeting two days. The 13th went to Lartington to meeting, and returned in the afternoon. Next day to Darlington, and had a meeting there the 15th; it ended well though hard in the begin|ning. The day following went to Stock|ton; had a full meeting, and came away in peace. The 17th had a meeting at Yarme; it was &s;mall, &s;everal young peo|ple came from Stockton, and it proved upon the whole to good &s;atisfaction. Next day was at a &s;mall meeting, where &s;at a pretty while in &s;ilence and a &s;tate of mourning for the cau&s;e of truth. I ea&s;ed my mind among&s;t them, and came away in peace. The 21&s;t had a meeting at Gi&s;borough, and 23d at Moore&s;ome. The 24th was at the month|ly meeting held at Ca&s;tletown, where were many plain, hone&s;t, &s;incere friends, and we were comforted in the Lord and in one another. Next evening at Hin|derweil
<PB N="33" REF="030834_0031_0FE99FD4F36902C0">and Roxby. The 26th went to Whitby, and that evening had meeting with &s;everal friends who came to &s;ee us. Next day attended a large meeting; my &s;pirit was under great &s;uffering, and con|tinued &s;o until the afternoon, though I had delivered in the forenoon meeting, what appeared to be given me; but in the afternoon the power of truth was in dominion, and every oppo&s;ite &s;pirit made &s;ubject; things were &s;poken to clo&s;ely and clearly, and Babylon thre&s;hed as with a &s;harp in&s;trument, that &s;he could not get from under. Then was my &s;pi|rit made ea&s;y, and my &s;oul rejoiced in the Lord, who is worthy, and prayer, prai&s;es, and thank&s;giving, a&s;cended unto him that lives for ever. Had the compa|ny of &s;everal friends this evening, which was &s;pent in, I hope, profitable conver|&s;ation. The 28th had a meeting at Sten|tondale. The friends in this quarter are but few, I think eight families compo&s;|ed the meeting; it was with the&s;e few a memorable &s;ea&s;on of humbling glad|ne&s;s. Came to Scarborough in the even|ing, and next day had a large and &s;atis|factory meeting. In a friend's family where we &s;pent the evening, had a reach|ing, affecting &s;ea&s;on, manife&s;ted by much brokenne&s;s of &s;pirit. The 1&s;t of 10th month had a meeting at Pickerington,
<PB N="34" REF="030834_0032_0FE99FD6FB435360">and the 2d at Kirkbymoor&s;ide, which was large, and attended with the going forth of &s;ome &s;ea&s;oning in&s;truction. Went after meeting to John Richard&s;on's, a man near 84 years of age, very remark|able for &s;weetne&s;s and liveline&s;s of &s;pirit; full of love, clear in his under&s;tanding, and his memory &s;trong. He &s;at up till late with us, relating the wonderful deal|ings of the Lord with him, which was truly edifying, and &s;uch as I had never heard before. He was quite open with us, which I looked upon as a favour from the Lord; I wept much at parting with him, and when we took leave, he de&s;ir|ed the Lord might ble&s;s us. Next day went to Malton. The day following had a large meeting, and pa&s;&s;ed through a la|borious exerci&s;e among&s;t them. The e|vening was &s;pent to &s;piritual profit, in waiting for a renewal of &s;trength, and imparting &s;ome of the bread handed to my &s;oul to others, whom I vi&s;ited in their families: left this place with peace of mind. The 6th was at a monthly meet|ing at Bridlington: it was a &s;ea&s;on of &s;uffering, my mind very low after it; which cau&s;ed an examination; but find|ing nothing to accu&s;e my&s;elf of, was made ea&s;y. The 7th we were at Horn&s;ea meet|ing; the Lord's eternal power broke in upon us, to the comfort and refreshment
<PB N="35" REF="030834_0033_0FE99FDA4BF67C18">of our &s;ouls, and it was a time of &s;olemn wor&s;hip. Next day we were at a meeting at Ou&s;twick, to our great comfort, and &s;olid refre&s;hment. The 9th at Ea&s;t-end. The 10th had an evening meeting at Hull, to profit and edification, through the aboundings of that life which enlightens and &s;anctifies. The 11th went to Bever|ly, a town where no friend lives, having felt a particular draft to have a meeting there; &s;everal friends from Hull attended, and the people flocked in until the hou&s;e was near filled. I &s;tood up and began to &s;peak; but people ru&s;hed in &s;o, that I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;topping, until they were &s;ettled; I then proceeded, and a glorious meeting it was, the divine pow|er and authority of truth commanding &s;i|lence throughout the multitude. Next day we went to vi&s;it a few at Skitby that were lately convinced, with whom we had a good meeting, and &s;ome open, profita|ble conver&s;ation. The 13th we went to Northcave, friends from &s;everal parts ad|jacent came thither: which made the meeting large, but not open and lively; we had hard labour, yet ended pretty well. The 14th had a meeting at How|don, there were but few friends, and &s;ome of the town's people, who being in the I&s;hmaeliti&s;h, mocking &s;pirit, the true &s;eed did not reign among&s;t them. The 15th
<PB N="36" REF="030834_0034_0FE99FE00F867108">were at Ratcliff. The 16th at Thorn. The 17th at Braithwaite, and the 18th again at Thorn. The&s;e meetings were generally &s;mall, and low as to the life of religion, which cau&s;ed laborious work to get down to the &s;eed, &s;o as to mini&s;ter to the &s;tates of the people. The 20th had a meeting at Beltoft, which proved &s;atisfac|tory; &s;ome who were not of our &s;ociety at|tended, that were very &s;olid and attentive; &s;ome were tendered, and &s;everal came in the evening, with a de&s;ire of having a meeting with us; but feeling no concern for it, I could not encourage it. 22d vi&s;it|ed the meeting of Blyth, in Notingham|&s;hire, which began at two o'clock, I was led very clo&s;ely in it, had to remind them of the practice of our elders; and told them, if they would &s;earch from whence that cu&s;tom of deferring meetings until af|ternoon, had its origin, they would find it was not in the truth. It ended well, in the &s;weet con&s;olating love of the Lord my God. The friend we lodged with, not be|ing at meeting, but engaged in his &s;hop, I had &s;ome clo&s;e di&s;cour&s;e with him, con|cerning his duty to God; at fir&s;t he &s;eem|ed to put it off, but was brought to ac|quie&s;ce with what I &s;aid. Next day had a &s;mall, but good meeting at Wam&s;worth; had a loo&s;e, libertine &s;pirit to &s;peak to; which the authority of truth helped me
<PB N="37" REF="030834_0035_0FE99FE2473127F0">through with, to the enlargement of peace in my own bo&s;om, and the exalta|tion of that power, which, when it rules, cau&s;es the righteous to rejoice. The 25th being Fir&s;t-day, was at Pontefract meet|ing, which &s;eemed very weak and dwarf|i&s;h, as to the life of religion; their un|due liberty in externals, manife&s;ting that their dwellings were not with the humble &s;eed, that crucifies to the world, and tar|ni&s;hes its beauty. Had little to commu|nicate, yet felt a revival of light and &s;trength to my own &s;tate. I had a con|cern to have a meeting with tho&s;e not of our &s;ociety, a great number attended, many of whom were light and vain, but while I was exerci&s;ed in &s;peaking, they were mo&s;tly quiet and attentive, and I hope the opportunity was to edification. The 26th had a meeting at Selby, which was but &s;mall. That evening went to York, and attended the quarterly meet|ing, which began at 5 o'clock, it was a &s;ea&s;on of travail and exerci&s;e to a living remnant. Next morning, at 9, the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders began, when the baptizing power of the Lord was witne&s;&s;ed by the faithful, and, through the &s;ucceeding meetings, help was graciou&s;ly afforded, and the church was edified.</Q></P>

<P>The following letter was written to a friend from Bradford, in York&s;hire, 2d of the 11th month, 1748.</P>
<Q><P>A few days ago thy acceptable letter reached me at the city of York, which I read with a mixture of &s;atisfaction and &s;orrow: &s;atisfaction to find, that thou &s;till retaine&s;t thy love to the eternal excellency; and &s;orrow, that the powers of darkne&s;s &s;hould &s;till &s;o far prevail, as to cau&s;e &s;uch &s;truggles of &s;oul, and &s;ore conflicts of &s;pirit, as thou &s;peake&s;t of: but I have not the lea&s;t doubt of thy deliverance, and firmly believe thy God will magnify and exalt his own divine power in thy &s;oul; and make bare his holy arm for thy &s;al|vation, by revealing it in thee, an un|failing pre&s;erver in every needful time. This I write not altogether from my&s;elf, nor the impul&s;e of friend&s;hip and grati|tude; it is from a degree of that a&s;&s;urance and confidence, which truth has at this juncture communicated. It is rea&s;onable
<PB N="39" REF="030834_0037_0FE99FE6B6A768C8">to think by thy complaint, the time of thy relea&s;e is at hand; it was &s;o with I&s;rael when they were to be brought out of that dark land; their ta&s;k-ma&s;ters were harder, and their burdens made heavier; for, I believe, there has no temptation befallen thee, but what has been witne&s;&s;|ed by thy brethren who have trodden the &s;ame &s;teps, even through the region and &s;hadow of death; by the gates of hell, yea, out of the belly of hell have &s;ome called as Jonah did, and He heard them. His righteous ear is not grown heavy that he cannot hear, but for the &s;ighing of the poor, and groaning of the needy &s;oul, he will yet ari&s;e; and then it is that all our enemies are &s;cattered; one enabled to cha&s;e a thou&s;and, and two to put ten thou&s;and to flight. Though, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, it is a day of darkne&s;s, famine and di&s;tre&s;s, yea, thick darkne&s;s, that may be felt; yet ble&s;&s;ed be the name of our God, he is as a Go&s;hen to his chil|dren, giving them light in their habita|tions, and &s;etting a mark upon them that &s;igh and mourn for the abominations of the people. Thou &s;eeme&s;t willing to give me an idea of thy &s;piritual &s;tate and con|dition, by an outward repre&s;entation; but I think I may &s;ay, I have both &s;een and felt it, by &s;inking down below all that is of the creature, to the pure humble &s;eed of

<P>I take kind thy &s;ea&s;onable warning to watchfulne&s;s, which I &s;urely &s;tand in need of, in this time that drow&s;ine&s;s and &s;piri|tual lethargy have generally infected man|kind. Thou wilt, perhaps, like to hear an account of my &s;piritual progre&s;s, and travel Zion-wards, and of the &s;tates of the churches here, &s;o far as my &s;ight can reach; and I may &s;ay, it has been a real grief and affliction to my mind, to &s;ee the de&s;olation, darkne&s;s, and in&s;en&s;ibility that generally prevail; having been made to go mourning on my way, with this lan|guage in my &s;oul, Lord, to whom ha&s;t thou &s;ent me? where &s;hall I find thy flock and family upon earth? for I &s;ee very few who like even to hear or &s;peak of thee; and, &s;urely, if thy love had the pre-eminence, out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth would &s;peak, or, at lea&s;t, the &s;oul love to wait in &s;ilence for thy divine appearance. But alas!

Yet although it be thus, there is a living remnant in this part of the world, but under great &s;uffering and op|pre&s;&s;ion, with which I have been made deeply to &s;ympathize, and have greatly admired the Lord's goodne&s;s and conde|&s;cending love; his forbearance and &s;uffer|ing to a di&s;obedient and gain&s;aying peo|ple, not willing that they &s;hould peri&s;h.</P>
<P>As to my own particular, I find the truth of that &s;aying, that "they who preach the go&s;pel, live by it," in a &s;piri|tual &s;en&s;e; and though the Lord has been plea&s;ed at times to cau&s;e his candle to &s;hine upon my head, and clothe me with his royal robes, yet I often witne&s;s a be|ing entirely emptied, &s;tripped, and de&s;ti|tute almo&s;t of daily bread, and have had, as Mordecai, to go down and &s;it at the king's gate; all which I &s;ee is for my good; for when a ci&s;tern is let dry, the earthy &s;ediment is di&s;covered; a fit time for clean&s;ing it, that &s;o the water may flow from it with greater purity; there|fore

Ble&s;&s;ed for ever be his holy name, he has afforded me &s;trength to di&s;charge my&s;elf faithfully, wherever my lot has been ca&s;t, both publicly and privately; &s;o that I have no condemnation on that account, nor have I repented leaving all to an&s;wer his holy requirings, but humbly thank him, that he enabled me &s;o to do; and were crowns and diadems laid at my feet, I would not give his approbation for them.</P>
<P>Before I conclude I would &s;ay, beware of E&s;au's crime; it was when his &s;oul was ready to faint, he de&s;pi&s;ed his birth|right; when he had been eagerly pur&s;u|ing &s;omething he delighted in, he came to this unwi&s;e conclu&s;ion, "Behold I am at the point to die, and what profit &s;hall this birthright do me?" He wanted pati|ence and &s;olid reflection, and afterwards had bitterly to repent when too late. Had he not re&s;igned it, none could have taken it from him; neither can all the powers

<P>As I quietly rode along, the Lord was plea&s;ed in mercy, to break in upon my mind, by his living pre&s;ence and power, and it became the language of my &s;oul, "Speak, Lord, and thy &s;ervant will hear." After which many things were divinely opened to me, wherein I greatly rejoiced, and was thankful to the Lord my God: I then found a &s;udden, but gentle rebuke, and heard as it were a voice, that &s;aid in the &s;ecret of my &s;oul, "the di&s;pen&s;ations thou mo&s;t delighte&s;t in, are lea&s;t plea&s;ing to me, and not &s;o beneficial to thy &s;oul, as that pure poverty of &s;pirit, brokenne&s;s and contrition of heart, which brings into humility of mind, and the rea&s;on why this is &s;o little de&s;ired, and &s;o un|plea&s;ant to the creature, is, that it can have no part therein, but is wholly ex|cluded and &s;et at naught; can di&s;cover no beauty or excellency in it; and for this cau&s;e it is, that I will in no wi&s;e de&s;pi&s;e the offering of a broken and con|trite &s;pirit, as it is mo&s;t pure and without mixture of the creature. For, whether
<PB N="44" REF="030834_0042_0FE99FF5B55342A8">there be prophecies, divine openings or revelation, con&s;olations, joying or rejoic|ing in the Holy Gho&s;t, gifts of healing or tongue of utterance, in all the&s;e &s;elf can rejoice, and have a &s;hare, being obvious to it, and bringing it honour." Then &s;aid I, "Lord di&s;pen&s;e to me what is mo&s;t plea&s;ing to thee, and be&s;t for my &s;oul, &s;o long as my weak faith and patience can endure, and when I am ready to faint, give me a little of the wine, well refined on the lees, that my &s;oul may rejoice in thee, the God of my &s;alvation."</P></Q>

<Q>I received your acceptable letter at Lon|don, and would have an&s;wered it ere now, but for want of lei&s;ure, and &s;ometimes a fit frame of mind, being many times deeply bowed, and dipped into &s;uffering with, and for, my fellow members, and the &s;eed of God, which lies loaded and oppre&s;&s;ed in the minds of very many, even the profe&s;&s;ors of the ble&s;&s;ed truth, as a cart under &s;heaves; this makes the true mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t go heavily mourn|ing on their way, often &s;trewing their tears in &s;olitary places, for the &s;lain of the daughter of this people; yea, for his &s;ake we are killed all the day long, and accounted as &s;heep to the &s;laughter; and &s;urely, of all perils we meet with by &s;ea and land, there are none &s;o dangerous or hard to bear, as by fal&s;e brethern: &s;uch are they who have lo&s;t the &s;pirit and power of godline&s;s, but retain the form, being cloathed with a phari&s;aical righteou&s;ne&s;s, they, as our Saviour &s;aid, &s;it in Mo&s;es's &s;eat; what they bid, we may do, but their
<PB N="55" REF="030834_0053_0FE9A1E1A32A9BF8">example is to be &s;hunned: in&s;tead of coming up in their foot&s;teps, we may ju&s;tly cry, my &s;oul come not into their &s;ecret; unto their a&s;&s;embly mine honour, be not thou united, for their &s;teps tend to the chambers of death, and their ways to the gates of de&s;truction. Oh! the great lo&s;s we that are young have, for want of &s;teady elders, to go before us, who might take us by the hand with this amiable language, "follow us, as we follow Chri&s;t." As this is the lot of our day, we mu&s;t &s;trive to keep to our great Pilot, who is the alone &s;afe conductor of his followers, through all the &s;torms, dif|ficulties, and dangers that attend this pil|grimage and vale of tears. Though he may &s;ometimes &s;uffer us to walk by faith and not by &s;ight, yet, as our eye is &s;tea|dily looking unto him, he will be found near at hand to help and direct, who&s;e holy life (while in that prepared body) remains to be, an unerring pattern, he, in whom there was no &s;in, neither was guile found in his mouth, who was a man of &s;orrows and acquainted with grief. Alas! how hard a le&s;&s;on is this to our corrupt nature, poor, frail, wealk crea|tures! ah! what need we have of bound|le&s;s mercy, and the mediation of a ten|der, compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour, an holy high prie&s;t, that was tempted in all points, as
<PB N="56" REF="030834_0054_0FE9A1E395B217A8">we are, and well knows how to &s;uccour all the tempted; who&s;e care is ca&s;t upon him, the government of who&s;e hearts is upon his &s;houlders, who have &s;urrendered their wills to his. The&s;e, and only the&s;e, are made truly free from the thraldom of &s;in and death: know an overcoming them|&s;elves, the world and the devil, the only conque&s;t worth our labour and con&s;tant pur&s;uit. May we ever keep &s;o near that holy, animating &s;eraph, love, as that we may witne&s;s it, to fill us with a generous indifferency to earthly and tran&s;itory ob|jects; that &s;o we may in reality, count all things here, as lo&s;s and dro&s;s, in compa|ri&s;on of that excellent trea&s;ure, which we have in our earthen ve&s;&s;els to the efficacy of which has at times given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;reli&s;h to every thing that would impede its pure ari&s;ing in the &s;oul.

<P>She mentions, <Q>At the city of Cam|bridge had a meeting with a few profe&s;|&s;ors, the number about 5, in which place was greatly favoured in my mind with the living pre&s;ence of God, in who&s;e light I &s;aw, and was made to believe, that there would be a people rai&s;ed up in that place
<PB N="57" REF="030834_0055_0FE9A1E545FC5940">who &s;hould &s;tand for the honour of his name, and to be valiant for truth on earth. This I was led to declare to the few pre&s;ent, though at this time, a place noted for contrary fruits. At Burford had a large and precious evening meet|ing, though in the early part it was a ve|ry &s;uffering time, there being divers prie&s;ts, ju&s;tices of the peace, &s;o called, and rude people in whom the prince of the air had dominion; but the Lord, who&s;e power is above every power, ma|nife&s;ted his own arm and made it bare, for the help of his depending children, who have none in heaven but him, nor in the whole earth in compari&s;on of him. His te&s;timony was &s;et over the heads of tran&s;gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">rs, and evil &s;pirits were made &s;ubject to his power, everla&s;ting prai&s;es be given to his excellent name! At ano|ther place where I had a meeting, the profe&s;&s;ors of Truth had heard of my be|ing &s;ilent at &s;everal meetings, and were afraid of the cro&s;s and reproach of men &s;o took me a back way to the meeting for fear (as I apprehended) their neighbours that were not of our &s;ociety &s;hould &s;ee us, and come there, yet Providence &s;o order|ed it, that a large number came to the afternoon meeting, to whom Truth was declared in the wi&s;dom and demon&s;tration

<P><Q>In the latter part of this journey, I was &s;eized with a violent intermitting fever, which illne&s;s detained me &s;everal weeks, and cau&s;ed me to travel in great bodily weakne&s;s, yet the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed at times to &s;trengthen me for the &s;ervice he had called me to, beyond my own and others expectation. I waited near a month for a pa&s;&s;age, which &s;eemed tedious to me, &s;ome of the time at a public hou&s;e at Parkgate, de&s;titute of friends or acquaintance, but dared not repine at the will of Providence. In this journey I rode about five thou&s;and miles, and attended five hundred and twenty-five meetings. I landed at Dublin the 9th month, 1750, being about two years and nine months ab&s;ent; had the company of My e&s;teemed friend, Samuel Fothergill. We had a rough, but &s;wift pa&s;&s;age, and were in danger of driving upon the Welch coa&s;t, but the Lord was our pre&s;erver. my friends rejoiced to &s;ee me, as I did them, &s;ome were concerned at the &s;tate of my vi&s;ibly impaired health. In this city I felt great weakne&s;s of body and mind, being &s;tripped, emptied and tried as be|fore the great Judge, by whom I was willing to be examined, and to bring my
<PB N="59" REF="030834_0057_0FE9A1EC380998A8">deeds to his divine light, where my own weakne&s;s and manifold infirmities, might be more fully manife&s;ted; it was &s;everal days before I was able to go out to meet|ings. Though my life was de&s;paired of by &s;everal, when I repaired to my father's cottage, where all the wants of nature were fully &s;upplied, that which would gratify the lu&s;t of the eye, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h and pride of life, much excluded, I mended in my health fa&s;ter than I expect|ed, and contrary to the opinion of divers, who were again&s;t my coming, fearing the journey would be too much for me, and the accommodation not &s;uitable to my weak condition; but I ble&s;s the name of my God, who never &s;uffered me to want any good thing, &s;ince my fir&s;t knowledge of him. I had great peace in coming to my aged father, who much de&s;ired my company: invitations I had to &s;tations of great affluence; but denied them, and found the Lord my God de&s;erts not the poor and mean of this world, but vi&s;its them in their lonely &s;ituations and hum|ble retirements before him. This I am a witne&s;s of, for he was often with my &s;pirit in this time of weakne&s;s; &s;peaking peace and comfort to my &s;oul, that could not live without him. One day in parti|cular, as I rode to meeting, being much better in health, his living word ran
<PB N="60" REF="030834_0058_0FE9A1EE48890F00">&s;weetly through my mind, thus, "For this purpo&s;e have I rai&s;ed thee up, to &s;how forth in thee my power of pre&s;erva|tion and mercy;" which greatly rejoiced my &s;oul, and cau&s;ed me to prai&s;e his ex|cellent name (who is everla&s;tingly worthy) for all his mercies.</Q></P>
<P>She kept pretty much at home during her weak &s;tate of health, and about this time, wrote to a friend:</P>
<Q>By the mercy of Providence, I am now much recovered, ah! &s;aith my &s;oul, may I an&s;wer the end for which I am continued longer among dreams and &s;hadows, min|gled with deceit, ah! what &s;oul that rightly knew its true centre, would de&s;ire to continue here longer than till it had performed the will of Him that &s;ent it into life. This is a &s;tate of infirmity and dependency, environed by the mo&s;t &s;ub|tle, potent, unwearied enemies, which loudly calls for the greate&s;t vigilance, fear, humility and watchfulne&s;s, that our nature is capable of; let us, therefore, &s;ink down in our minds, to the lowly, humble &s;eed of everla&s;ting renown, where the vi&s;ions of life and light are &s;een, and the voice of the great Oracle heard, di&s;tinct from every other &s;ound, in the &s;ilence of all fle&s;h, freed from the

<P>In another letter &s;he &s;ays:</P>
<Q>I often wonder why the Lord and his people, &s;hould &s;how &s;o much regard to a poor and unworthy creature, who am the lea&s;t and la&s;t of his family, if meet to be e&s;teemed of that happy number. My &s;oul &s;inks low under the weight of obli|gations to him, to whom I can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake no returns, but of his own begetting; who mea&s;ures not his mercies by our merit, for then would they be a &s;canty portion; but they are proportioned to his matchle&s;s love and kindne&s;s.</Q>
<P>The &s;ummer following &s;he accompanied Catherine Payton, who came to this nation on a religious vi&s;it, finding a draft to join her to Mun&s;ter and Ul&s;ter. She &s;et for|ward on this journey in the 5th month, 1751, and they joined as companions at Waterford. They had many meetings among&s;t tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties. They vi&s;ited the town's people of Sligo, in Con|naught, and felt much &s;atisfaction; &s;he thought they were well worth vi&s;iting, and &s;aid there &s;eemed much more openne&s;s to declare the truth among&s;t tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties, than among&s;t them that go under

<P>To a friend &s;he wrote as follows:</P>
<Q>I &s;alute thee in that love, which nearly united our &s;pirits at our fir&s;t &s;eeing each other; yea, before I beheld thee with my natural eyes, a prayer was begotten in my &s;oul, that thou might be made an in&s;trument of good to me, which peti|tion, I have cau&s;e to believe, was heard and excepted by the great I am. For thou wa&s;t dipped into a &s;en&s;e of my &s;tate, and &s;ympathy with me, by which thou wa&s;t made the me&s;&s;enger of glad tidings and con&s;olation to my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;pirit, and re&s;olutions have been formed (which I tru&s;t, by the favour of heaven, will be &s;upported) to practice greater degrees of mortification and &s;elf denial than I have yet done; for I &s;ee great occa&s;ion for it. I write not this to exalt the creature or flatter my friend, but to magnify that grace, by which thou art, what thou art; and to contribute my mite to the &s;trength|ening of thy hands in the way of well doing, as I believe the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ome|times have need of it; but, perhaps, I only judge by my&s;elf, who am at times ready to faint in my mind, from a fear that I &s;hall never be made a conqueror
<PB N="63" REF="030834_0061_0FE9A1FCB6494338">over tho&s;e potent enemies which oppo&s;e my happine&s;s. I have compared my mor|tal &s;pirit to a kind of immaterial fire, that is continually catching at, or fa&s;ten|ing on, &s;omething cele&s;tial or terre&s;trial, and whichever it centres in, it may ju&s;tly be called an inhabitant of; as natural a tendency it has to fix on earthly objects, that are continually a&s;&s;ailing it, conveyed thereto by the organs of my &s;en&s;es, as iron ca&s;t into the water, has to &s;ink; which my &s;oul is ready to do, when I wait not carefully for the renewing of that power, by which we are tran&s;lated from the kingdom of darkne&s;s, to that of light. But &s;o frequent and painful are the operations of the &s;word of the &s;pirit, when it comes to &s;ever my &s;oul from the &s;pirit of the world, and to divide a&s;under between the joints and the marrow, that it makes we weary of this embodied &s;tate of imperfection, wherein I am torn as between two, heaven and earth, &s;o that I often long to be di&s;&s;olved and to be with Chri&s;t. Though this de&s;ire &s;eems to car|ry in it &s;omething laudable, ina&s;much as it &s;hows my union with the eternal excel|lency, to be &s;tronger than all the ties of nature, yet I am ready to fear, that in part, this longing takes its ri&s;e from &s;elf-love, which would lead me to &s;eek an ex|emption from pain and trials before I had
<PB N="64" REF="030834_0062_0FE9A1FE6C03AB70">filled up in my body, that which is be|hind of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t: I hope it is excu&s;eable, as our holy pattern has &s;et us the example; when about to par|take of &s;ufferings, he prayed earne&s;tly, that, if it were po&s;&s;ible, the cup might pa&s;s from him; but came to this noble re&s;ult, which all his followers, that are &s;o in reality, mu&s;t be brought to, <HI>viz.</HI> "Not my will, but thine be done." What could be grievous, that he did not &s;uffer?

<P>The following advice was communicated by letter, to a young man, then under the baptizing power of truth.</P>
<Q>There is one caution that has dwelt for &s;ometime on my &s;pirit to give thee, in pure love and good will, that is, that thou may be particularly nice in the choice of thy friends, now in thy &s;etting out in a new and &s;piritual life, which is a point of great wi&s;dom; take &s;pecial care of being too readily taken with &s;trangers, and of giving thy &s;entiments in word or writing of per&s;ons or things, not well known. This thou wilt find, when duly con&s;idered, to be a hint of &s;ingular &s;er|vice.
<PB N="65" REF="030834_0063_0FE9A200310099F8">Wait for the freedom and direc|tion of truth, before thou entere&s;t into conver&s;e or familiarity with any, though it may be on religious &s;ubjects, for there are many more talkers of the truth, than walkers in it. This thou wilt find (as I have done) to tend greatly to the health and well-being of thy precious &s;oul; for there is a &s;et of mortals, who&s;e very breath diffu&s;es poi&s;on and infection to the mind; their throats are as an open &s;epul|chre, the poi&s;on of a&s;ps is under their tongues, they flatter with their lips; I might enlarge on this &s;ubject, but a watch-word is enough.</Q>
<P>She wrote to another of her friends thus:</P>
<Q>It is not forgetfulne&s;s of my near and dear friends, that makes me &s;low in my an&s;wers to them, nor yet, becau&s;e I have not a &s;ingular plea&s;ure in hearing from them; their conver&s;e by letter or other|wi&s;e, is, next to the divine good in my|&s;elf, the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction in this life; but thou knowe&s;t, that even all of this kind mu&s;t be through him, who is the &s;ource of all good, and can command the clouds, that they &s;hall or &s;hall not rain; he can &s;top both the upper and the nether &s;prings, and cau&s;e a famine in the land, and who &s;hall &s;ay, what doe&s;t thou?
<PB N="66" REF="030834_0064_0FE9A201F9B3B2B0">It is the Lord that worketh in and for his people, and who &s;hall let or hinder him, from doing it his own way, and after the manner that he &s;ees be&s;t? He is about to try his people every way, even as he did I&s;rael of old, by famine, captivity, and &s;ore di&s;tre&s;&s;es, becau&s;e of the hard|ne&s;s of their hearts and &s;tiffne&s;s of their necks, refu&s;ing to return to him, who had done &s;uch great things for them and their fathers. This is the ca&s;e, my friend, of people in this our day, who are gone into captivity, and refu&s;e to return at the command of the Lord, who has long waited, and loudly called, immediately and in&s;trumentally, to them to return. And for this rea&s;on a little remnant, who, like David, prefer Jeru|&s;alem above the chiefe&s;t joy, have hung their harps as upon the willows, and dare not &s;ing the &s;ongs of Sion, neither can they in a &s;trange land, for &s;uch as de&s;ire it from them; who are of the number of tho&s;e that &s;poil them, and yet require of them a &s;ong or mirth. May all do as Daniel did, in their private chambers, &s;et their faces towards Jeru&s;a|lem, oftener than the morning, and not be afraid to &s;uffer for the law of their God.

<P>She writes thus to a per&s;on under religi|ous impre&s;&s;ions, whom &s;he was made in&s;tru|mental to help:</P>
<Q>Does it not behove me to &s;tudy thy pre&s;ervation, as I am unavoidably led in the wi&s;dom of truth to do? It was for

And now it is in my heart to give thee a &s;hort account of my own experience in the work of reli|gion. When my &s;oul was fir&s;t thereby awakened to a life of righteou&s;ne&s;s; I &s;aw &s;uch beauty and excellency in the truth and the followers of it, that I thought no temptation would ever pre|vail upon me to turn a&s;ide in the lea&s;t degree from what I knew to be my duty and intere&s;t in the truth (not in the world, which I &s;aw clearly lay in wickedne&s;s) and all my pa&s;&s;ions &s;eemed &s;o &s;ubjected and engro&s;&s;ed in admiration and contem|plation of the one great and good object, and his wonderful works in me and the whole creation, that I &s;eemed to have no life in, nor reli&s;h for, any other employ. Nor could I hear with plea&s;ure any con|ver&s;e that did not &s;avour more or le&s;s of the &s;pirit of truth, and even &s;uch as did, I delighted more in the feeling &s;en&s;e of it in my own heart, than the hearing of it from any mortal. And to hear any &s;peak
<PB N="69" REF="030834_0067_0FE9A20EA10F0728">of it, that were not in the life and power of it, was the greate&s;t pain to my &s;pirit that it could be tried with.

Alas! this &s;tate la&s;ted not long till my trials came on apace, and all my fortitude was proved; nor will I, or dare I, a&s;cribe my pre&s;ervation to my own watchfulne&s;s, &s;tability, prudence, or wi&s;dom; no, it mu&s;t be for ever attributed to the watch|ful eye of the Shepherd of I&s;rael, who &s;leeps not by day nor &s;lumbers by night. The enemy of my happine&s;s &s;trove to draw me from the true light, and &s;et me upon acting by imitation, rather than the &s;en&s;e and judgment of the truth in my&s;elf; and here &s;elf began to plead what need is there for me to be more mortified in this, or that particular, than others of my fellow labourers, that are greater mini&s;ters, and have &s;een farther into the liberty which truth allows of, they being per&s;ons of far greater abilities than I, and &s;ome other weak per&s;ons who make &s;cruples of &s;mall matters? and what is there in this, that, or the other trifle of dre&s;s or behaviour? Thus did the enemy work as in a my&s;tery, to de|ceive my poor, proud heart, that liked well this doctrine of his, and would

Nor is there any mortal, that rightly and truly &s;avours the things of God, longer than they are under the immediate influence of his own divine grace, and that in a greater or &s;maller degree as they partake of it; let us therefore ca&s;t this part in all the di&s;ciples, behind our backs, and look to him with a &s;ingle eye, that was never overcome in battle.

<P>A concern, which at times for years, had re&s;ted on her mind, to pay a religious vi&s;it to the churches in America, appears about this time to have impre&s;&s;ed her with ad|ditional weight, the bapti&s;ms &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through to fit her for this work, &s;he thus de&s;cribes:</P>
<Q><P>The Lord was plea&s;ed to bring me ex|ceedingly low, both in mind and body, the latter &s;o much &s;o, that my life was de&s;paired of by my&s;elf and others; and &s;uch was my exerci&s;e of mind and pain of body, that life &s;eemed a burden, yea, I was ready often to wi&s;h my body di&s;|&s;olved that I might be with Chri&s;t. Yet, when death looked me in the face, unac|companied by that which alone can ren|der it &s;upportable to human nature, <HI>viz.</HI> an inconte&s;tible evidence of eternal re&s;t to my immortal &s;pirit, it appeared to me a gloomy pro&s;pect, and the cau&s;e of its being &s;o I believe was, that my time was not yet come.</P>
<P>For I knew not that I had wilfully offended the divine Being, that &s;hould cau&s;e him to withdraw his life-giving pre|&s;ence,
<PB N="76" REF="030834_0074_0FE9A229D9ED0A08">and &s;uffer my mind to be clothed with a thick cloud of darkne&s;s. During this time of trial and deep exerci&s;e of body and mind, the Lord my God was plea&s;ed to extend his mighty arm of power, and reduce my &s;pirit to a calm, &s;o as to make his holy voice intelligible to my weary, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;oul, and to inform me that he would rai&s;e me from that low and dark &s;tate, and cau&s;e me, in his love, to vi&s;it the churches in America the next year. And although this &s;eemed to cla&s;h with my temporal intere&s;t, as well as na|tural inclination, there was at the &s;ame time when I heard the call, an entire re|&s;ignation wrought in my mind, &s;o that I could &s;ay indeed and in truth, "Thy will be done in all things," which was to me a confirmation that the thing was of the Lord, verifying that &s;aying of David, when addre&s;&s;ing the Almighty, "In the day of thy power, thy people &s;hall be willing," and &s;uch was the prevalency of it, that it removed tho&s;e things which had been like mountains in my way, and cau&s;ed them to be ca&s;t into the &s;ea of an|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ilation.</P>
<P>This journey had been before me, by di&s;tant views, from a &s;hort time after my receiving a gift in the mini&s;try. There were many difficulties &s;eemingly in&s;ur|mountable

<P>She corre&s;ponded with her friend Cathe|rine Payton, who felt a like concern to vi&s;it the churches in America, and great was the &s;ympathy they had with each other. She left home the 22d of the 3d month 1753, attended the quarterly meeting at Edender|ry, and went thence to Dublin, where &s;he met with con&s;iderable trials by oppo&s;ing &s;pi|rits, of which &s;he &s;ays, &s;he had a precious &s;ight, and thus writes:</P>
<Q><P>I felt the power of darkne&s;s at work &s;o as grievou&s;ly to oppre&s;s my &s;pirit, but by degrees it was ca&s;t down, and the pure light prevailed. The de&s;ign of the enemy was to prevent my intended jour|ney by rai&s;ing contention, which, ble&s;&s;ed be the name of God, he was not able to do. I left Dublin in the 5th month, in love and unity with my friends, and good de&s;ires for my enemies, if any &s;uch I had, and landed at Liverpool, got &s;afe to London. After attending the yearly meeting at London, I went to the yearly meetings of Colche&s;ter, Bury, Wood|bridge, and Norwich: all which were
<PB N="78" REF="030834_0076_0FE9A22F4C095838">attended with a good degree of the life and power of truth, and an hone&s;t labour for the good of the people. Before my leaving Ireland, I had a &s;ight of Charle&s;|ton, in South Carolina, being the port for me to land at, which continued until I returned to London, when I lo&s;t &s;ight of it; which made me willingly conclude I might go with &s;ome friends I was nearly united to, for Philadelphia, and went on board &s;ome ve&s;&s;els bound for that port, but could not &s;ee my way in any of them. On more deeply centring to the root of life, in humble re&s;ignation to the divine will, I found it my duty to continue &s;ome weeks at London, and not being clear of that city, was, I believe, the cau&s;e of my not &s;eeing my way clear to Charle&s;ton, I therefore concluded to &s;tay the Lord's time, and when I found my &s;pirit clear, took my pa&s;&s;age with my dear companion, Catherine Payton, for that port. Before my leaving London, I had a large and comfortable farewell-meeting at the Peel, for which my &s;oul, with many more, had renewed cau&s;e to ble&s;s and prai&s;e the name of the Lord; &s;everal friends ac|companied us from London to Port&s;|mouth, where we took &s;hipping and landed at Charle&s;ton. We had a favour|able pa&s;&s;age, &s;ave hard weather towards the latter part of the voyage; but by the
<PB N="79" REF="030834_0077_0FE9A23148D9FDC0">infinite mercy of Almighty God, were pre&s;erved from any terror or amazement, and our health continued beyond expec|tation, &s;ave the &s;ickne&s;s occa&s;ioned by the &s;ea and heat. We had meetings on board every Fir&s;t-day, when ability of body and the weather would permit, which the pa&s;&s;engers and &s;hip's crew attended, to whom the way of life and &s;alvation was declared; but many of their hearts be|ing hardened through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, the word had not that entrance, which could have been de&s;ired.</P>
<P>In Charle&s;ton the di&s;cipline was quite let fall, and I found it my duty to endea|vour to revive it. Herein I met with open oppo&s;ition and evil treatment, e&s;pe|cially from one of my own countrymen, who was of a libertine &s;pirit, and had been under the cen&s;ure of friends in his native land. But the Lord was plea&s;ed to manife&s;t his &s;pirit, &s;o that he could not fru&s;trate our endeavours. In this province we met with many difficulties both of body and mind, the former by long journeys, in a very thinly inhabited country, through unbeaten paths in the woods, dangerous creeks and &s;wamps, with wild and venemous creatures around us, and with &s;uch food and lodging as we had never been accu&s;tomed to; yet

<P>The following is a part of a letter writ|ten to her uncle:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>It has dwelt on my heart for &s;ome days, to give thee a &s;hort hi&s;tory of a long tra|vel; and fir&s;t may acquaint thee that through the matchle&s;s mercy of a never failing God, to his poor depending chil|dren, we have been pre&s;erved in a good degree of health, at a time when mo&s;t faces gathered palene&s;s through indi&s;po&s;i|tion of body. I do not remember that we have been in a hou&s;e or family &s;ince we left Charle&s;ton, but one or more were ill of a fever or ague, &s;o that it &s;eems like an univer&s;al contagion which has over&s;pread the inhabitants of this quarter. We came hither from Charle&s;|ton, taking no meetings in the way, ex|cept in the families where we lodged, the di&s;tance being 150 miles, through woods
<PB N="81" REF="030834_0079_0FE9A23B97D3DA80">and &s;wamps, where our lives &s;eemed in jeopardy every hour, yet through mercy our minds were &s;o &s;upported above fear, as to go on with a good degree of cheer|fulne&s;s of &s;pirit, tru&s;ting in that holy arm of power, which has hitherto wrought deliverance for us. I have &s;at down by a brook in the woods, eat my Indian-corn bread, and drank water out of a calaba&s;h, with more content and peace of mind than many who were &s;erved in plate, &amp;c. and at night have &s;lept contentedly in my riding clothes, on a bed hard enough to make my bones ach, and the hou&s;e &s;o open on every &s;ide as to admit plenty of light and air. I have compared my pa&s;&s;|age through the&s;e woods, to my pilgrim|age through the world, and indeed in &s;ome things it bears a ju&s;t re&s;emblance; the path we rode through was exceeding narrow, and &s;ometimes &s;o clo&s;ed as not to &s;ee a foot&s;tep before me, caught by boughs on one hand and bu&s;hes on the other, obliged to &s;toop very low, le&s;t my head &s;hould be hurt or eyes pulled out: this I compare to the entangling things of the pre&s;ent world, which are ready to catch the affections on every &s;ide and blind the eyes of the &s;oul; my clothes are a little ragged by the&s;e pulls, but through care not quite torn off. Oh! &s;aith my &s;oul, may it not be wholly &s;tripped of the
<PB N="82" REF="030834_0080_0FE9A243180133E0">white robe which is the righteou&s;ne&s;s of &s;aints; for &s;urely I have never been in more danger than now; the &s;en&s;e of which leads me earne&s;tly to de&s;ire, that I may have a place in the remembrance of tho&s;e, who&s;e prayers a&s;cend with accep|tance to the throne of grace. I have not given the foregoing account of my bodily hard&s;hip, by way of complaint or mur|muring, no, when I con&s;ider how much more, very many much better than I have &s;uffered for the cau&s;e of religion, and e&s;pecially the good Shepherd who laid down his life for his &s;heep, every cau&s;e of complaint is removed, remem|bering that the di&s;ciple is not above his Ma&s;ter, nor the &s;ervant above his Lord. Yea, it is cau&s;e of rejoicing to my &s;oul, when I can find my feet in the foot&s;teps of the tribulated flocks, who trod this narrow path, and tried way to eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. In this way of life I am ex|empt from many dangerous temptations, which ea&s;e and &s;upinene&s;s are inlets to. On my hard bed, I am free from the fault of wa&s;ting too much of my time in a &s;tate of death and inactivity. At my plain meals, I am freed from many of the temptations and evils, which attend high and voluptuous living; and am often made to remember that excellent advice of a great apo&s;tle to his &s;on in the faith,
<PB N="83" REF="030834_0081_0FE9A244A64B3900">"Endure hardne&s;s, as a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." And &s;urely &s;uch as are &s;ent out to war before the face of their enemies, may expect it in an e&s;pecial manner. But what, above all other con|&s;iderations reconciles me to every di&s;pen|&s;ation of Providence, is, the &s;ight and &s;en&s;e which truth gives me of my own unworthine&s;s, of the lea&s;t of all the mer|cies I receive, either &s;piritual or tempo|ral; for indeed I &s;ee my&s;elf to be &s;o ex|ceedingly weak, and capable of &s;o little &s;ervice, as not to merit the meane&s;t food that is &s;et before me, yet have never been &s;uffered to doubt, but that I am in my place, in coming here.&mdash;I think very long to hear from my friends and family, having been of late a little to&s;&s;ed, e&s;pe|cially in the night by dreams about my father's family and &s;ome others; whether it be the work of the enemy to perplex my mind, or a fore&s;ight of the wor&s;t of trials (except the lo&s;s of the favour of heaven) I cannot tell: but when I am a&s;&s;i&s;ted to look beyond this tran&s;itory &s;cene of uncertainty, I can welcome tri|bulations, and rejoice in &s;uch adver&s;ities, as have the lea&s;t tendency to draw my mind nearer unto God; which I know mu&s;t be by being weaned and redeemed from earth and earthly &s;atisfactions. Alas! while I carry about with me this frail ta|bernacle,

<P>I have hitherto pa&s;&s;ed over our exer|ci&s;es in Charle&s;ton.

We lodged at the hou&s;e of one who had married out of the &s;ociety, which we went to with fear and reluctance, having fir&s;t tried all means to avoid it. Here we were greatly &s;trait|ened, but I think we were providentially ca&s;t there for his wife's &s;ake, who is un|der convincement, a tender hearted, good natured woman, and exceedingly kind to us, and he well e&s;teemed for a fair repu|table trader. He received us with much civility and ho&s;pitality, which yet did not

We were often vi&s;ited by tho&s;e of other &s;ocieties, and had much kindne&s;s &s;howed by them. We had freedom to make a few vi&s;its among&s;t them, and had &s;ervice for our ma&s;ter in &s;ome of their families. We likewi&s;e paid a religious vi&s;it to every fa|mily profe&s;&s;ing with us, in that place, and had very clo&s;e work, but with the mo&s;t authority of any &s;ervice we have entered on; and by this and &s;uch like labour, I under&s;tand we have driven &s;everal from the meeting, who could not bear &s;ound doctrine, though ever &s;o private.

<P>Her account thus continues:</P>
<Q><P>At Nuce in North Carolina, we had a large and comfortable meeting, in which I thought it might be truly &s;aid the Lord's power was over all, and that even devili&s;h &s;pirits were made &s;ubject to that power, by which we were a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;peak. In this province likewi&s;e, we met with abundant hard&s;hips and &s;ufferings of body, as we were drawn in the love of God, to vi&s;it many of the back inhabi|tants, where I &s;uppo&s;e, no European had ever been on the like errand: by lodging in the woods in cold fro&s;ty weather, on damp grounds with bad firing, I got a rheumatic pain in my jaws and head, by which I &s;uffered much, and often lo&s;t my
<PB N="87" REF="030834_0085_0FE9A253F153EA18">re&s;t after had travelling; yet through it all, the Lord was plea&s;ed to &s;upport my &s;pirit in a good degree of cheerfulne&s;s, without murmuring or repining, though my weak con&s;titution often deeply felt the effects of tho&s;e bodily hard&s;hips; yet by the goodne&s;s and healing virtue of the Lord, I was often made to forget my bo|dily infirmities, and to &s;ee and feel that His &s;trength was made perfect in weak|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Between Pedee and New-garden, where is a large tract of country, we rode two days and an half, and lay two nights in the woods, without being under the roof of a hou&s;e. In the&s;e parts I &s;eemed to have a hope that truth might yet &s;pread, becau&s;e many of the people &s;howed a love and e&s;teem for friends, and a di&s;like to the prie&s;ts. We were often kindly enter|tained, according to their ability, at the hou&s;es of the&s;e not of our &s;ociety, though &s;ometimes at our fir&s;t entrance they would look &s;trangely at us, becau&s;e they under|&s;tood not the lawfulne&s;s of women's preaching, having never heard any: thus did we pa&s;s for a &s;ign and wonder; &s;ome would &s;ay, when invited to meeting, that we were women who ran from our own country for &s;ome ill act, not being ac|quainted with the &s;upernatural power of
<PB N="88" REF="030834_0086_0FE9A255B41BA150">love, which had influenced our hearts, nor the rules and di&s;cipline of friends. Through divine favour I have not heard of any of them who went away di&s;&s;atis|fied from meeting; may the prai&s;e of all the Lord's works be rendered to him&s;elf, who alone is worthy. In the upper part of this province (North Carolina) there is a large body of prefe&s;&s;ors, and I hope &s;ome valuable friends, but too many I fear (yea, I think I &s;en&s;ibly felt) are tru&s;ting in a profe&s;&s;ion, without a po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, of the living virtue of truth. We were at their quarterly meeting, which was large; but the power of truth &s;ome|what low, at lea&s;t in me, who &s;uffered much under a loo&s;e un&s;anctified &s;pirit. My companion had the chief &s;ervice in the public meetings, and was led, I be|lieve, to &s;peak pretty much to the &s;tate of the &s;ociety: my chief labour was in the meeting of mini&s;ters and elders, in which we endeavoured to &s;trive for &s;ome regula|tion in the di&s;cipline, particularly that they might have their meetings for bu&s;i|ne&s;s &s;elect, and not &s;et open for the peo|ple, which they were then in the practice of. The weighty part of friends joined us, and &s;eemed to conclude they would &s;trive for an amendment. I al&s;o propo&s;ed their holding a meeting for the elders to confer in, before the mini&s;ters joined
<PB N="89" REF="030834_0087_0FE9A257D3F7CD18">them, in order to their hearing a more full and perfect account of the &s;tate of the mini&s;try in each meeting, and to have them both held before the quarterly meet|ing. This was agreed to, and the meet|ing ended in a feeling &s;en&s;e of divine love, which makes true unity and concord among&s;t brethren, for which my &s;oul was thankful. I laboured with con&s;iderable openne&s;s at &s;everal of the particular meet|ings, before the quarterly meeting; my companion being gone on a vi&s;it, &s;outh|ward of the&s;e parts as far as Bath-town. In this journey &s;he had the trial of hav|ing a woman friend, who accompanied her from Perquimans, removed by death; her remains were brought to her hu&s;band and children in eleven days from the time &s;he left home, being then well to all ap|pearance. We attended at her funeral, which was on the whole &s;olid and &s;atis|factory, though &s;omewhat interrupted by one who, as he thought, would preach the burial &s;ermon. From thence we pa&s;&s;ed to Virginia, and found things in the &s;outh &s;ide exceedingly weak and low, the meet|ings very &s;mall, and in many places the di&s;cipline &s;adly let fall; friends were very kind and ho&s;pitable, but from the poor &s;ea&s;ons we had in &s;pirit, their ho&s;pitality &s;ometimes lo&s;t its true reli&s;h; yet there is a &s;eed in the&s;e parts, with whom my &s;pi|rit
<PB N="90" REF="030834_0088_0FE9A25B23A1C3E0">had true unity. We &s;pent near two months in this colony, in much inward &s;uffering, and under &s;ome bodily hard|&s;hips, their way of living differing from what we had been accu&s;tomed to. One thing which friends here, as well as in North Carolina, Maryland and &s;ome other parts of America, were in the prac|tice of, gave us con&s;iderable pain, and we apprehended was in part the cau&s;e of truth's not pro&s;pering among&s;t them, as otherwi&s;e it would, that is, buying and keeping of &s;laves, which we could not reconcile with the golden rule of do|ing unto all men as we would they &s;hould do unto us.</P>
<P>At We&s;t-river, Maryland, I was con|cerned to write an epi&s;tle to the yearly meeting to be held at Curles in Virginia, which had been on my mind for &s;ome time; my companion united therewith, and &s;ub&s;cribed here name to &s;aid epi&s;tle, which was as follows:
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the living, &s;olid remnant of friends, at the yearly meeting to be held at Curles, for the colony of Virginia, in the 6th mo. 1754, and e&s;pecially &s;uch as con&s;titute the &s;elect meeting.</HEAD>

<SALUTE>DEAR FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>In a good degree of that univer&s;al, un|changeable, enlarging love which drew us from our native land and near enjoy|ments, to make you a religious vi&s;it, do we at this time tenderly &s;alute you, and hereby inform you (as we have done &s;ome of you heretofore verbally) that our hearts have been pained, on account of the &s;tate of the church in your colony. And though we cannot accu&s;e our&s;elves of withholding any thing from you, either in public or private, which was given us to deliver, we apprehend it our duty to &s;tir up in your remembrance, &s;ome truths already known, and we hope weightily felt by &s;ome of you.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, we recommend to your &s;olid con&s;ideration, when &s;olemnly a&s;&s;embled, the exceeding low &s;tate of the mini&s;try and dicipline, in mo&s;t, if not all the monthly meetings in your colony. Sink down to the pure gift of God in your|&s;elves. A&s;k of Him with a &s;incere de&s;ire to be informed, Lord, what is the cau&s;e that we flee before our enemies, and are taken captive by them? for thus we be|lieve it is with &s;ome, whether they are &s;en&s;ible of it or not, and as this is the ca&s;e, we hope and believe, the Lord will let
<PB N="92" REF="030834_0090_0FE9A26402DDA868">&s;ome of you &s;ee and feel, that the &s;hort|ne&s;s has not been on his &s;ide, and that he has not for&s;aken his people, but they him; and will al&s;o give power to amend your ways and your doings. For we can|not, we dare not &s;uppo&s;e (let our &s;pirits be cloathed with ever &s;o much Chri&s;tian charity) that all who have been called, and even initiated into the true church, have &s;tood faithful, and kept a &s;ingle eye to the glory of God; no, no, if that had been the ca&s;e, what a bright, &s;hining people would you have been ere this day; yea, as a city &s;et upon a hill, who&s;e light would have diffu&s;ed it&s;elf to tho&s;e who were without, and have cau&s;ed many to flock to our Zion for re&s;t and &s;afety, as doves to the windows; and not as birds of prey, to tear and devour, as is now too much the ca&s;e, many we fear coming in among you with un&s;anctified &s;pirits; <HI>i. e.</HI> to make a profe&s;&s;ion of the truth, which is now ea&s;y, without a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or &s;ure inheritance in it, in which increa&s;e of number, &s;ome have &s;eemed to glory, when in truth they have but increa&s;ed un|godline&s;s in the church, by adding chaff in&s;tead of the &s;olid, weighty wheat, which alone will be gathered into the Lord's garner; but the chaff of all kinds, will be burnt with unquenchable fire. Where then will the&s;e light, chaffy, un|&s;anctified
<PB N="93" REF="030834_0091_0FE9A26591ABCDC0">profe&s;&s;ors appear, or what will they add to you, except it be an incum|berance and clog to the &s;mall handful of &s;olid friends among&s;t you, who, we be|lieve, are too much oppre&s;&s;ed and borne down; yea, lie as hid and buried, under this light, windy &s;pirit. Ari&s;e, we be|&s;eech you, in the name and power of your God, and exert your&s;elves in his pure wi&s;dom and &s;trength, for his cau&s;e and truth on earth. Victory is on the Lord's &s;ide, and will be your's, if you faithfully follow him in the way of his requirings, not fearing the faces of men, but &s;trictly regarding the &s;till, &s;mall voice and gentle motions of the ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit of truth. As this is the ca&s;e, one &s;hall cha&s;e a thou&s;and of the&s;e light, frothy &s;pirits, and two put ten thou&s;and to flight, though ye may, yea, mu&s;t be little and low in your own eyes. And we earne&s;tly de&s;ire, that &s;uch as have been called to, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure qualified for, the work of the Lord, and through a de&s;ire of &s;ome kind or other, of filthy lucre, of which there are many, are become formal, blind, and unfaithful, may repent, and do their fir&s;t works, &s;eeing from whence they are fall|en, le&s;t the Lord come to them quickly, and remove &s;uch candle&s;tick out of its place, who&s;e candles are already put out by the baneful breath of the &s;pirit of this
<PB N="94" REF="030834_0092_0FE9A2689BB58D38">world; with which they have univer&s;ally mingled, and in which they are held cap|tive. Ari&s;e from this &s;tate, if po&s;&s;ible, and &s;hake your&s;elves from the du&s;t of the earth, with which &s;ome of you are laden as with thick clay; but if you are &s;o benumbed, hardened, and &s;tupified, through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, that this cannot be, yet cea&s;e at lea&s;t, to pervert the right way of the Lord, by meddling in things with which you have no bu&s;i|ne&s;s, that is, putting your&s;elves forth in the mini&s;try or di&s;cipline, when Chri&s;t the true &s;hepherd, has not put you forth therein. Remember what befel him who &s;tretched forth a hand to the ark, even when it tottered and &s;eemed in danger of falling; the &s;ame event will happen to the &s;piritual lives of all tho&s;e, who continue for a &s;eries of time, to mock and deceive them&s;elves and people with a &s;ound of words without life or power, which however found in them|&s;elves and well connected, are but as a dead letter, which kills in&s;tead of quick|ening the &s;oul. Let this certain, &s;elf-evident truth be weightily con&s;idered by you, <HI>viz.</HI> that nothing but life and light, &s;hould move to act in the church of Chri&s;t; not pity for the people, nor inclination to gratify their longing de&s;ire after words, nor any other human pa&s;&s;ion or con&s;idera|tion,
<PB N="95" REF="030834_0093_0FE9A26E82E3AB78">&s;hould move us thus to tempt the Lord, and take his holy name in vain, in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion, for which as do &s;o, he has declared he will not hold them guiltle&s;s. And dear friends, we apprehend that a great part of the weakne&s;s and unfruitfulne&s;s, which appears in the mini&s;try among&s;t you, pro|ceeds from want of a right, &s;ound di&s;ci|pline, e&s;tabli&s;hed and conducted in the wi&s;dom of truth, which di&s;cipline is cer|tainly not only as a wall of defence again&s;t the encroachments of many dangerous enemies, but as a hedge to &s;helter from the various baneful bla&s;ts, de&s;tructive to young and tender plants, which &s;hould be &s;heltered as well as watered, pruned and dug about, by wi&s;e, judicious elders and fathers and mothers in the church. But alas! how do the few of tho&s;e who are on the right foundation, &s;tand as alone, expo&s;ed to the darts of their enemies, and piercing bla&s;ts from every &s;ide, un|pruned, unadvi&s;ed in a great degree; can &s;uch be expected to bring forth plentiful crops of full, ripe, well flavoured fruit? nay, rather the &s;avour of the wild grape is to be feared, becau&s;e the trees are left in a great mea&s;ure without cultivation. Now as the hedge is thus &s;adly taken away, and the wall greatly broken down, we are &s;en&s;ible the reparation mu&s;t be by
<PB N="96" REF="030834_0094_0FE9A2B1436B6978">gradual &s;teps; yea, by laying a &s;ingle &s;tone at a time, and planting a tender twig. And tho&s;e who are engaged in this nece&s;&s;ary work, will find as Nehe|miah did, before he went to repair the walls of Jeru&s;alem, &s;adne&s;s of counte|nance, ere they can entreat the Almighty for liberty to engage in the work. No|thing &s;hort of a heart truly touched with love and zeal for the good of the church of Chri&s;t, can adopt this language, "Here am I, &s;end me," or "qualify me and let me go." May it be yours, Oh! ye beloved, tender plants of the Lord's right hand planting, and when it is, &s;tifle it not, but go on in the &s;trength of the Lord, not &s;aying, "Here am I, and I will go in the &s;trength of my own &s;pirit, will, or wi&s;dom." No, we give our te&s;ti|mony for our Lord and ma&s;ter, that the&s;e forward, un&s;avory &s;pirits, will never pro|fit the people, nor bring glory to God. But you who are of the former rank, though you may meet with many di&s;cou|ragements, as Nehemiah did, yet if ye tru&s;t in the Lord with all your hearts, and &s;ingly eye his light in your&s;elves, not conferring with fle&s;h and blood, nor &s;eeking your own honour, but the honour of him that &s;ent you into life, it is our te&s;timony to you for encouragement, that the Lord will ble&s;s his work in your hands,
<PB N="97" REF="030834_0095_0FE9A2702C3C8DF0">and richly reward you for it, though you may have a long and painful travail, and &s;ometimes as in the night &s;ea&s;on, before you come at the right place for building; and when you come there, you will find much rubbi&s;h to be removed.</P>
<P>This we apprehend mu&s;t be the fir&s;t work before our &s;tone can be properly laid on the right foundation, <HI>i. e.</HI> to have all un&s;anctified &s;pirits, both of your own and other &s;ocieties, excluded the privilege of &s;itting in your meetings for bu&s;ine&s;s; otherwi&s;e we believe it will be building with the rubbi&s;h, which will never &s;tand to the honour of God and the good of his people.</P>
<P>Our minds are &s;o &s;en&s;ibly affected with the pernicious tendency of that evil cu&s;|tom, of &s;uffering your meetings for the di&s;cipline of the church to be thus mix|ed, that we cannot help advi&s;ing (believ|ing it to be the mind of truth) that you u&s;e your chri&s;tian endeavours for an alter|ation, by making a minute again&s;t this di&s;orderly practice, and &s;trongly recom|mending the putting of it in force in the &s;everal monthly meetings throughout the colony, for which you have authority from the univer&s;al practice of friends where the di&s;cipline is rightly conducted,
<PB N="98" REF="030834_0096_0FE9A271C03E12A0">as well as from the original in&s;titution of &s;uch meetings.</P>
<P>And now having in a good degree ea&s;ed our &s;pirits of what &s;eemed to re&s;t upon them, on your account, we con|clude in that love which &s;eeks the pre&s;er|vation and good of the heritage of God, with &s;aying, be &s;ober, be vigilant and of one mind, and de&s;iring the God of peace may be with you, in this your annual a&s;&s;embly, we remain your friends in the truth.</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>At this meeting of friends at We&s;t-river, we were fal&s;ely accu&s;ed of &s;peak|ing from outward information, when in truth it was from the opening of the word of life; this we were frequently &s;u&s;pected of, and charged with, by unbe|lievers, who knew not the intelligence of the &s;pirit, though they made profe&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through the we&s;tern &s;ide of Maryland called Sa&s;&s;ifrax bay, and took meetings in our way; but after we entered Penn&s;ylvania, had no openne&s;s to
<PB N="99" REF="030834_0097_0FE9A274B00BE188">appoint meetings in that province, the Jer&s;eys or Long I&s;land, except one, but pa&s;&s;ed on in a pretty direct line, falling in with &s;ome meetings as they came in cour&s;e till we got to Rhode I&s;land, the day before the yearly meeting which was held at Newport, it was large and attend|ed with a good degree of divine power, peace and concord. At this meeting we found our minds engaged to labour for &s;ome regulation in the di&s;cipline, which was &s;adly out of order, in particular that unwi&s;e practice of having meetings for that purpo&s;e, mixed with the world's people, and &s;uch as were proper &s;ubjects to have it exerci&s;ed upon, which &s;eemed to be the fir&s;t &s;tep nece&s;&s;ary to be taken. We prevailed &s;o far as to have a minute made again&s;t it, and &s;ent to the &s;everal quarterly and monthly meetings, as the re&s;ult of the yearly meeting, which gave us an opportunity as we fell in with them, to &s;trengthen friends in having their meet|ings &s;elect. It was remarkable that we fell in with &s;o many of them in the cour&s;e of our labour and &s;ervice: I write this for my own in&s;truction and that of others, as an incitement to follow the leading of truth and the way it points out to us, though the cau&s;e may not im|mediately appear, and indeed on all ac|counts I have &s;een it be&s;t &s;o to do. One
<PB N="100" REF="030834_0098_0FE9A27B154A5910">mark of providential care, which oc|curred in this journey, is, I think, wor|thy of remembrance; when at New York &s;ome friends of that city, and others, &s;eemed inclined that we &s;hould go by wa|ter to Newport, in a &s;loop that was to &s;ail next day; accordingly we went to view the ve&s;&s;el, and found her very &s;mall and inconvenient, having no cabin that we could well &s;it, &s;tand or lie in; they &s;eemed to think we might make our pa&s;&s;|age in 24 or at mo&s;t 48 hours; we &s;at down quietly in her, to feel if there was freedom in the truth for us to go, a prac|tice I like to be found in on &s;uch occa|&s;ions, in which time, and before I went it appeared to me, that if we &s;ailed in her, we &s;hould meet with greater difficul|ties than if we went by land to South-hold, and thence to Newport by water. I told friends that I had more freedom to go by land, and they readily agreed to it. The ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed from New York as in|tended, we went as propo&s;ed, and had &s;ome meetings to good &s;atisfaction, among&s;t the Pre&s;byterians at and near South-hold, and fell in with a &s;mall meet|ing of friends in the way, having al&s;o &s;ome &s;ea&s;oning opportunities among our|&s;elves, wherein the divine pre&s;ence was manife&s;ted to our mutual comfort. We waited &s;ome days at South-hold for a fair
<PB N="101" REF="030834_0099_0FE9A27CABEA08F0">wind, went on board and landed the &s;ame evening: the &s;loop which it was intended we &s;hould go in, arrived only the &s;ame day, being 8 days on her pa&s;&s;|age.</P>
<P>At Philadelphia the 23d of the 5th mo. I received the &s;orrowful tidings of the death of my dear and tender father, who departed this life in much peace and quietude of &s;pirit, on the 23d of the 2d month la&s;t, according to the account I received from tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent; he having been favoured with his under&s;tand|ing and a &s;en&s;e of his change. This was of a truth &s;ore and hard to bear. I have great cau&s;e to ble&s;s and prai&s;e his great name, who &s;upported me beyond my ex|pectation or de&s;ert under this trial, as well as prepared my mind for it, by a fore&s;ight of it, both &s;leeping and waking. I &s;aw, in a dream, my father in the agonies of death, and in the time of his illne&s;s, day after day, felt &s;uch a &s;ympathy of &s;oul as is not ea&s;ily expre&s;&s;ed, and after that &s;uch a &s;top in my mind, from thinking of or writing to him, as convinced me that he was gone, the account of which I fully expected.</P>
<P>We attended a quarterly meeting at Hampton in New England, where we
<PB N="102" REF="030834_0100_0FE9A27E437C3258">had to te&s;tify again&s;t an unruly &s;eparate &s;pirit, though we had not &s;een or heard of it outwardly, as I declared to them; nothing to convince us of it but the &s;pirit of truth, they would not believe, though high pretenders to revelation. They abundantly convinced us before the quar|terly meeting was over of our being right, for &s;uch was their outrage, that they u&s;ed the utmo&s;t of their power to prevent us from &s;peaking in the meeting, to ea&s;e our minds, by noi&s;es both within and without the hou&s;e; but truth gave us the victory and &s;et our &s;pirits over them.</P>
<P>After we had &s;pent &s;ome time in this quarter, and vi&s;ited friends generally, ea&s;tward of Bo&s;ton, as far as North Yarmouth, on my return I found my mind &s;ecretly drawn towards a &s;eparate people, at Hampton in New England, but as it was a &s;ervice likely to be at|tended with more than common diffi|culties, I waited to have a more clear &s;ign and &s;tronger evidence of my du|ty, which the Lord was plea&s;ed to give me in his own time; he knew the &s;ince|rity of my heart and that I had no will to di&s;obey him. We pa&s;&s;ed the place 14 miles, before I received &s;uch a &s;atisfactory evidence, as I had wi&s;hed for, in which I believe there was wi&s;dom, as &s;ome friends
<PB N="103" REF="030834_0101_0FE9A27FCEB6E438">might perhaps have judged me, as being too forward on entering on a &s;ervice of &s;uch weight and difficulty. At Newberry, where were friends from &s;everal meetings, I found my mind &s;o &s;trongly drawn, and with &s;uch weight towards this people, as rendered me quite unfit for any other &s;er|vice, it &s;eeming impo&s;&s;ible for me to think of any thing el&s;e in that meeting, except laying my concern before friends there; which I was fully per&s;uaded, was what truth pointed out to me. Accordingly at the clo&s;e of the meeting, I reque&s;ted the mo&s;t &s;olid, concerned friends to &s;tay, when I told them how it had been with me; they readily agreed to my going, and divers gave up to accompany us. My companion at fir&s;t &s;eemed affrighted about going, and wept con&s;iderably, I left her quite at liberty to &s;tay or go, and in the morning &s;he found her way open and had good &s;ervice. They received us with much &s;eeming kindne&s;s, particularly one who appeared to be like the head of them, and was the per&s;on whom I chiefly want|ed to &s;ee: He &s;poke many fair words to us before the meeting, and told us that he looked upon it as a favour from the Lord, that we were &s;ent to them; but af|ter meeting, when I came to tell him my mind freely, and deliver the me&s;&s;age which I had to him, he &s;oon changed and
<PB N="104" REF="030834_0102_0FE9A2878BDDFE90">treated me roughly: declaring that I would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd mercy with the Lord, un|til I repented of my proceedings again&s;t him and them, at the quarterly meeting at Hampton. We had a &s;ea&s;onable op|portunity to ea&s;e our minds, in which our ma&s;ter was with us, by his &s;pirit and power, and I was made &s;en&s;ible that there was in that place, a people &s;incere in their &s;earches and endeavours after religion, which the Lord regarded, though under many delu&s;ions and mi&s;takes. In this quarter (New England) clo&s;e and hard work fell to our lots, among&s;t tho&s;e who called them&s;elves of our &s;ociety, which was difficult to be accompli&s;hed, becau&s;e many thought them&s;elves whole, while in reality they needed a phy&s;ician, mani|fe&s;ting an unlawful familiarity with the world. Unbounded curio&s;ity in the peo|ple, cau&s;ed meetings to be thronged, that in hot weather it was exceeding hard to &s;it them, and much more trying to &s;peak in them; but he who &s;earches the hearts of all, and knows their intentions, di&s;ap|pointed the&s;e wrong &s;pirits, by clo&s;ing our mouths in &s;ilence one meeting after another; which greatly di&s;plea&s;ed the peo|ple, and drew upon us great reproach, lies and &s;lander, all which we were ena|bled to bear patiently, and rejoice in, for our Ma&s;ter's &s;ake. We were led to en|deavour
<PB N="105" REF="030834_0103_0FE9A289539F3950">to &s;eparate tho&s;e under our name from others, and at times &s;ome of the ruling members from the re&s;t, to whom we had very clo&s;e things to offer, feeling that the declen&s;ion which &s;o glaringly ap|peared in the &s;ociety, had reached many of their borders. This &s;eemed a very hard ta&s;k to get accompli&s;hed becau&s;e of their being &s;o connected in marriage, &amp;c. and the di&s;cipline being &s;o &s;adly let fall, they knew not who were, or who were not proper members.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places we had to vi&s;it particu|lar families, before we could ca&s;t off our burdens, as in Bo&s;ton; where I was led to find out &s;ome hidden works of dark|ne&s;s, the workers whereof ought to be cut off from the name and &s;ociety of friends, in order to clear it and them from the &s;candal they brought on it; one young man in particular, with whom we had to treat on his being likely to marry with one of another &s;ociety. It aro&s;e in my heart while we talked with him, that he was deeply tinctured with dei&s;m, a di&s;be|lief of the &s;criptures, the coming of Chri&s;t in the fle&s;h, and his &s;econd appear|ance by his &s;pirit; I told him my opinion of him which he acknowledged to be true, and &s;poke in defence of it; I told him the ground whence his unbelief
<PB N="106" REF="030834_0104_0FE9A28AE22539E8">&s;prung, <HI>viz.</HI> leaning to his own under|&s;tanding, and departing from the light, which alone can convince of God and godline&s;s. I left &s;ome parts of this coun|try not quite clear in my &s;pirit, but un|der a weight, and particularly Newport, I was given up in my mind to return to it, but could not then find my way open. I was advi&s;ed by a friend to leave it for the pre&s;ent; I did &s;o, and travelled under great exerci&s;e of &s;pirit through Connec|ticut, but without condemnation. At Oblong I had a &s;ight that my dear com|panion C. P. and I were to &s;eparate, for the work's &s;ake, I had been at times much &s;traitened in my &s;ervice by preferring her and her gift, for I was greatly afraid and jealous over my own heart, le&s;t &s;elf &s;hould have any part in our &s;eparation, from a de&s;ire of appearing greater than with a companion; another thing which appear|ed to me with con&s;iderable weight, was her youth, and the many dangers that might attend if not rightly &s;uited with a companion. The&s;e and many other con|&s;iderations, would I believe have pre|vailed, had not the Lord laid his hand upon me, in a remarkable manner, on this wi&s;e. My mind was &s;tripped of abi|lity for &s;ervice, and deeply bowed to the centre of all &s;trength for in&s;truction, in which &s;tate I had a de&s;ire given me to be
<PB N="107" REF="030834_0105_0FE9A2B4644DF200">at Philadelphia, and to go thither pretty direct without appointing many meetings: accordingly I de&s;ired that not more than two meetings, which lay in the way, might be appointed, but my companion and &s;ome other friends, encouraged the appointing more. I became pa&s;&s;ive, though I found my exerci&s;e for meetings in tho&s;e parts, was at that time taken away; which aftewards more clearly ap|peared, having been &s;ilent in all, except one I found freedom to have appointed, neither was my companion capacitated for the &s;ervice, in the la&s;t meeting which was at Longreach on the Main.</P></Q>

<P>Thy acceptable letter, perhaps, might have been acknowledged &s;ooner, had I not a hope or expectation of &s;eeing thee ere now; hope did I &s;ay? alas! I &s;hould have none, but doing and &s;uffering the
<PB N="108" REF="030834_0106_0FE9A28E0D18C0B0">will of God; all others &s;eem forbidden, and are through divine favour, pretty much re&s;trained. My &s;tay being pro|longed in this country, has been altoge|ther unexpected to my&s;elf, and I have been held in &s;uch uncertainty for &s;ome months pa&s;t, as not to be able to give my friends any information re&s;pecting future move|ments. I have &s;tood as a &s;oldier waiting for the word of command, to march wi|ther&s;oever my holy leader may be plea&s;ed to direct; and may &s;ay to the prai&s;e of his great name, that he is not an hard ma&s;|ter, but good and bountiful every way; for though I have (as recited) been kept as a day-&s;ervant in a kind of undeter|mined &s;tate in regard to our &s;tay, yet may &s;ay of a truth, that I do not remem|ber ever to have had &s;uch a degree of &s;teady peace, and holy, unmixed qui|etude of mind, &s;o long together, amid&s;t many clo&s;e, deep trials and exerci&s;es in religious duties, &s;ome of &s;uch a nature as I had not been tried with before, and which required the utmo&s;t fortitude, wi&s;|dom, and patience. There is here the old phari&s;aical &s;pirit, which I have here|tofore had to war with, and it &s;eems to love me no better than u&s;ual. I &s;hall now proceed to give thee a narrative of the manner of my &s;tay, which to do, I mu&s;t begin with an unlooked-for pro&s;pect
<PB N="109" REF="030834_0107_0FE9A294884E9258">&s;et before me the &s;ummer after our land|ing, and hath rarely, if ever, wholly di&s;|appeared. How it may be, I cannot at pre&s;ent fore&s;ee: but this I know, that it has proved as balla&s;t to my mind, with re&s;pect to going homewards this fall, as al&s;o a means to &s;eparate me and my dear companion, which I believe was in the wi&s;dom of truth. It was pre&s;ented before la&s;t fall, with a draft to this city, &s;o that I was ready to conclude I mu&s;t have gone before my vi&s;it to this continent was end|ed, I mean to one or more of the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, but after waiting &s;ome weeks in this city, wrapped as in a thick cloud, as to any light which way I &s;hould turn, whether home or el&s;ewhere; (for to ap|point meetings any where on this conti|nent I dared not till the light went before me, having attended &s;ome that were for|wardly appointed without my directions, till I was become as a &s;ign and wonder to my&s;elf and others) my way opened to fini&s;h my journey on this continent &s;epa|rate from my former companion, which I was a&s;&s;i&s;ted to perform with &s;ome de|gree of &s;atisfaction to my&s;elf, and, I hope &s;ome little edification to the churches. In the latter part of this journey, it plea&s;ed my good ma&s;ter, to bring me un|der the mo&s;t &s;evere bapti&s;m and crucifixi|on, that I ever knew in the cour&s;e of
<PB N="110" REF="030834_0108_0FE9A29622360A98">my religious experience, partly on my own account, and on the account of &s;ome, to whom I had been made a mini|&s;ter, and in&s;trumental to help into the way of life and &s;alvation, who, looking at the creature more than the Creator, who is worthy for ever, became entan|gled, as a lamb caught in a thicket; it was then that I felt the depth, and true meaning of that emphatical &s;aying of the holy apo&s;tle, "my little children, for whom I travail in birth till Chri&s;t be formed in you." And Oh! the pangs and throes, the &s;ighs and groans, which a mother in I&s;rael has to pa&s;s through and put up, it is &s;omething like the &s;uffering which the captain of our &s;alvation pa&s;&s;ed through, in bringing many &s;ons and daughters to glory; it is with the utmo&s;t reverence and fear that I make the com|pari&s;on, between him and his mini&s;ters, who are to fill up in their bodies that which is behind of his &s;ufferings. But I &s;eemed to my&s;elf, and was as one nailed to the cro&s;s, day and night, for weeks together, with this de&s;ire or prayer fixed in my heart: "Let me not come down from the cro&s;s, till the glorious de&s;ign be fully accompli&s;hed, that &s;o thy will may be done by me, in me, and upon me, in time and in eternity:" and truly the bap|ti&s;m was not removed until this became
<PB N="111" REF="030834_0109_0FE9A297C0946830">the happy &s;ituation of my mind, that to live or die, to be in health or &s;ickne&s;s, in pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity, in Europe or America, in France or Spain, to pa&s;s through good or evil report, in the will of God, &s;eemed ju&s;t the &s;ame to me. I write not the&s;e things boa&s;tingly, but to the glory of God. Thou and others know what I am by nature, that in me (that is, in my fle&s;h) dwells no good thing. This was the nece&s;&s;ary preparative for the fore-named &s;tate of peaceful &s;ere|nity of con&s;cience, in a &s;ituation to which nature is above all things mo&s;t aver&s;e, to wit, daily dependence and un|certainty, being indebted or obligated to others for &s;upport, having nothing that it can call its own, &s;ave weakne&s;s and in|firmity, and this is that glorious my&s;tery, and &s;eeming contradiction, which the holy apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, in having nothing, and yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all things. In this &s;itu|ation of mind I entered this city, having looked round me every way, with re|&s;ignation to turn as I might be drawn by the power of matchle&s;s love, and hoped from the loo&s;ene&s;s which I then felt from all parts of this continent, that I might be permitted to return home with my brother (who I had heard was in town, and likely to &s;ail &s;oon) even if my companion could not go with me: but it was with this pro|&s;pect,
<PB N="112" REF="030834_0110_0FE9A2995076CC48">that I might probably return to this country if life was &s;pared, and I knew not how &s;oon. On coming hither, found that my brother was gone, and my com|panion not clear of this continent, &s;o con|cluded to wait for her a few weeks, or if it might be, months, &s;he expre&s;&s;ing un|common concern at the thoughts of being left behind. During the time I waited for her, &s;ome friends propo&s;ed to accom|pany me in vi&s;iting part of the families of friends in this city, a &s;ervice which had divers times been pre&s;ented to my mind in the cour&s;e of my journey, yea, before I left London, and when the propo&s;al was made, I found a perfect freedom to to join with it, it being with the concur|rence of the monthly meeting, little &s;up|po&s;ing I &s;hould be held to it in the man|ner I have been; but it is a &s;ervice which the Lord hath been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s in a remarkable manner. I have been in 160 families, and attended &s;ix meetings every week whil&s;t in town, as health permits, be&s;ides vi&s;iting the &s;ick and afflicted, and taking &s;ome excur&s;ions to the country. My companion when &s;he came to town, being &s;ometimes poorly in health, pro|ceeded but &s;lowly; we now go together, having tired mo&s;t of our companions, be&s;ides a couple of men friends, who go to &s;how us the doors, and be witne&s;s to
<PB N="113" REF="030834_0111_0FE9A2A0EF3E48B8">our labours; there are nearly as many yet to vi&s;it, as I have been with. Whether I &s;hall go this winter, or ever, to any of the i&s;lands mentioned, is at pre&s;ent hid|den from me; but had not the pro&s;pect afre&s;h opened after I had been here &s;ome time, I think I dare not have admitted the thoughts of &s;taying this winter; but have been ble&s;&s;ed with &s;eeing, yea, have been made in&s;trumental to help back &s;ome of the before mentioned lambs to the fold, one in particular, in this city, who I hope may be made a &s;erviceable in&s;trument.</P>
<P>I have now given up expectation of &s;ee|ing my native land before the &s;pring; at which time I hope to have the company of our beloved friend Samuel Fothergill, on &s;hip board. He is now in this city, al&s;o John Churchman and divers other friends, on the affairs of the &s;ociety. It is a difficult time to friends in tho&s;e parts, who are concerned to keep up their Chri&s;tian te&s;timony again&s;t wars and blood&s;hed: and e&s;pecially to &s;uch as are concerned in &s;tate affairs. I have had my health better than common in this city, for which ble&s;&s;ing, with all others, that I am an unworthy partaker of, I de&s;ire to be humbly thankful.</P>

<P>Without the lea&s;t de&s;ign to le&s;&s;en pa|rental authority, or filial obedience, &s;o far as they are either lawful or expedient, I would remark to thee, that divers pa|rents of this age have bent their thoughts and de&s;ires too much to earth, to have a clear, di&s;tinct di&s;cerning of the times and &s;ea&s;ons in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, and the &s;acred purpo&s;es of him who&s;e wi&s;dom is un&s;earchable, and his ways pa&s;t finding out, by all the penetration of finite un|der&s;tanding, uninfluenced by his own eternal light, and even then we &s;ee and know but in part whil&s;t here, but &s;ome of us have believed and &s;een in the vi&s;i|ons of light, that the day of go&s;pel light which has dawned, will ri&s;e higher and higher; notwith&s;tanding that &s;ome clouds may at times intercept its beauty and brightne&s;s, as hath been &s;orrowfully the ca&s;e among&s;t us as a people who have been highly favoured. And though I have not the lea&s;t de&s;ign to derogate from the real worth of tho&s;e honourable &s;ons of the morning, who were made in&s;tru|mental in a great degree to break down the partition wall, which carnal, &s;elfi&s;h man had erected between the people and
<PB N="115" REF="030834_0113_0FE9A2A49DD730D0">the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, I am not afraid to &s;ay, and give it under my hand, that it was and is the de&s;ign of God that his people in future ages &s;hould carry on the reformation even further than they did; and notwith&s;tanding that a night of apo&s;|tacy has come over us, as a people (as day and night &s;ucceed each other in their &s;ea&s;on and God keeps his covenant with both) I am of the judgment that that day has begun to dawn, in which the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s will ri&s;e higher and with greater lu&s;tre than heretofore, and if tho&s;e who are called of God to be the &s;ons of this morning, look back to the night, and to them who have &s;lept and been drunken in the night, by &s;ipping of the golden cup of abomination, as even to the latter day, they will fru&s;trate the de&s;igns of Providence re&s;pecting them|&s;elves, though not re&s;pecting his own work, for it is his &s;acred determination to be glorious in heaven and glorified on earth, though tho&s;e who would be called his I&s;rael be not gathered. And I am of the faith that when the go&s;pel has been fir&s;t preached to them, as it is meet it &s;hould, that &s;uch as neglect to embrace it, will be left, and the feet of the me&s;|&s;engers turned another way, even to the highways and hedges with a power of compul&s;ive love which will prevail on the halt, the maimed and the blind, to come
<PB N="116" REF="030834_0114_0FE9A2A7CB82CAE8">to the marriage of the King's Son, and by coming they &s;hall be made &s;trong, beautiful, and lively, and not look back to tho&s;e things that are behind, but pre&s;s forward towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t, following no men's example further than they follow him, and what if I &s;ay in the faith which is given me, that God has de|&s;igned to carry &s;ome of this generation in the&s;e parts of the world, higher and further in righteou&s;ne&s;s than their forefa|thers were carried, even &s;uch as were ho|nourable in their day, and therefore let them take heed that they limit not the Holy One of I&s;rael, nor circum&s;cribe the leadings of his ble&s;&s;ed unerring Spirit, by looking too much at the example of others; for this has been a means of &s;top|ping the gradual progre&s;&s;ion of many glo|rious well-begun reformations; in&s;tead of going forward, they have looked back, and even &s;unk below the &s;tandard of the fir&s;t reformers, and &s;uch as will be the fir&s;t happy in&s;truments to labour for re|formation in this degenerate age, mu&s;t differ in their trials from the &s;ons of the former morning, and will find them to be of a more &s;evere and piercing kind; theirs were from the world, and &s;uch as they might ju&s;tly expect from them (though not exempt from fal&s;e brethren) our will chiefly ari&s;e from tho&s;e under the &s;ame

<P>And now in regard to the matter pro|po&s;ed by thee, I &s;hall an&s;wer briefly, that I am of the judgment that if thou &s;tand|e&s;t &s;ingle and upright in thy mind from all the fal&s;e bia&s;&s;es of nature and intere&s;t of things, &s;topping thine ear to fallacious rea&s;onings, thou wilt find it more &s;afe to &s;uffer with the people of God, than to enter on or undertake doubtful things.</P>

<P>After her return from America &s;he at|tended the national meeting in the 11 mo. 1756, and returned a lively account of her journey. In the 2d mo. following &s;he laid her intentions of marriage, with Samuel Neale, before the monthly meeting of Mountmelick, to which &s;he belonged, after which &s;he found a concern to join in a vi&s;it to the familes of friends throughout that monthly meeting. When &s;he had perform|ed this &s;ervice &s;he returned home, and on the 17th of 3d mo. 1757, was married to our afore&s;aid friend in the meeting of Mount|rath.
