<P>The Wicked plotteth again&s;t the Ju&s;t, and gna&s;h|eth upon him with his teeth: The Lord &s;hall laugh at him; for he &s;eeth his day is coming.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY HEARERS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"_TO day is the &s;cripture fulfilled in our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">" we have both heard of the deep laid plots, the dark and cunning de|vices of tho&s;e who once ruled over us, to bring ruin and de&s;truction upon this whole land; and have &s;een them endeavouring to effect it; by tying our hands fir&s;t with the cords of oppre&s;&s;ion, that then, with the greater facility, they might fa&s;ten our feet in the fetters of &s;lavery. This is the plot|ting of the wicked again&s;t the ju&s;t: For although we have been a wicked people, and have de&s;erved more than this from the hands of a righteous God; yet from them we have de&s;erved better treatment: We never did them any wrong, as a people, but ju&s;t and upright have been our dealings.</P>
<P>WE have al&s;o &s;een them gna&s;hing upon us with their teeth; as it were, wheting their teeth, by pre|paring every in&s;trument of cruelty and death po&s;&s;ible to be invented by them, to &s;trike dread and terror in|to our hearts, to frighten, and thereby bring us ba&s;e|ly to &s;ubmit to their unju&s;t requi&s;itions, which gna&s;h|ing of their teeth was accompanied with big threats, to &s;pread de&s;truction and de&s;olation over this whole land, if we refu&s;ed to bow our necks, and would not &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively take upon them the tyrant's yoke.</P>
<P>AND we have likewi&s;e &s;een them brought into de|ri&s;ion; the Lord hath laughed at them, i. e. hath hi|therto
<PB N="4" REF="014755_0003_0F94DD7679F1E0A8">
tied their hands and greatly di&s;appointed their expectations; for, in&s;tead of driving all before them, and &s;preading de&s;olation and de&s;truction far and wide, they have been confined within narrow bounds, the &s;mall compa&s;s of a few miles hath contained them for almo&s;t a year, &s;heltered behind mo&s;t &s;trong forti|fications and many large &s;hips of war: But although they were within fortre&s;&s;es, by nature and art render|ed almo&s;t impregnable, yet &s;urprize hath &s;eized upon them in &s;uch a remarkable manner and to &s;uch a de|gree as to cau&s;e them to leave their &s;trong hold in the greate&s;t hurry and precipitation; and to flee for their lives, committing them&s;elves to the &s;ea for &s;afety. "This is the Lord's doing and is marvellous in our eyes." And it becomes us now to con&s;ider of the hand of providence in this happy event, and to make a &s;uitable improvement of it; which is to re&s;t and con|fide more in God, thankfully acknowledging his kind interpo&s;ition, and tru&s;t our&s;elves and our all with him; who hath hitherto dealt &s;o favourably with us, by re|membering mercy in the mid&s;t of judgment.</P>
<P>THIS whole P&s;alm is a di&s;cour&s;e upon providence; and the main de&s;ign is to bring the people of God to an intire and hearty acquie&s;cence in it: Various in&s;tances are mentioned, wherein the people of God &s;eem for a while to be ca&s;t down, and the wicked in &s;ome mea&s;ure triumphing over them: But he &s;hews that the triumphing of the wicked is &s;hort, Ver. 2. and 10. "For they &s;hall &s;oon be cut down like the gra&s;s, and wither as the green herb: For yet a little while and the wicked &s;hall not be: yea, thou &s;hall di|ligently con&s;ider his place, and it &s;hall not be." This is &s;aid to keep the righteous in a calm, &s;edate and tranquil frame of mind, to prevent any unea&s;y di&s;|quietude from taking place in their brea&s;ts, at the pre|valency and &s;ucce&s;s of the wicked, and to make them commit their way unto the Lord, confide in, and wait patiently for him; nothing doubting, but that he will make all things work together for their good, and
<PB N="5" REF="014755_0004_0F94DD7739C206A8">
for the de&s;truction of tho&s;e that ri&s;e up again&s;t them. Ver. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. of the context.</P>
<P>THE righteous and the wicked are here &s;et in con|tra&s;t; by which it appears that the righteous have the advantage of the wicked much every way, both in this world and the next: For if the righteous have but little of this world, it is better, it is more than all the abundance of the wicked; for they po&s;&s;e&s;s more by enjoying it better, with more &s;atisfaction and greater comfort: "A little that a righteous man hath is bet|ter than great revenues without right!" And if they have but little here, yet they are heirs to an inheri|tance, that is infinitely better than the whole world, and will la&s;t them for ever, Ver. 18. An inheritance incorruptible, undefiled and which fadeth not away. Or, if the wicked have more honour, renown and glo|ry in the world, the righteous have no cau&s;e to envy them; for it is but &s;hort, fading and dying, and will &s;oon turn into &s;hame, infamy and di&s;grace. Or, if they lay dark &s;chemes, devi&s;e wicked devices, and plot mi&s;chief again&s;t them; yet, referring all to God, in the u&s;e of the means afforded them, they have no rea&s;on to be afraid: For he that &s;itteth in the hea|vens, who regards, who loves the righteous, and who&s;e ears are open to their cry, will undertake for their pro|tection, defence and &s;alvation; will laugh at the wick|ed, blow upon their devices and confound them, Ver. 38 and 9. But the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors &s;hall be de&s;troyed to|gether; the end of the wicked &s;hall be cut off. But the &s;alvation of the righteous is of the Lord, he is their &s;trength in the time of trouble. And this is &s;poken to the righteous in order to keep up their &s;pirits and make them hold on, and hold out, and not give up when engaged in a good cau&s;e, though their enemies be many and potent, crafty and &s;ubtle, and have &s;uc|ce&s;s in &s;ome mea&s;ure attending them; being permit|ted to carry into execution &s;ome of their malicious purpo&s;es and wicked devices. And as we are now en|gaged in a conte&s;t with &s;uch as we ju&s;tly e&s;teem u&s;urpers
<PB N="6" REF="014755_0005_0F94DD77FA0D82E0">
and encroachers; who have in a mo&s;t unju&s;t manner levied war upon us: And we, being &s;atisfied of the ju&s;t|ne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s of our cau&s;e, have appealed to heaven to decide the controver&s;y; we &s;hould there|fore be often looking up to God, as the Lord of Ho&s;ts and God of armies, and depend on him, more than on our own &s;trength or wi&s;dom: "For the race is not to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong." And we &s;hould take notice of every of his providences, ac|knowledging his hand in them.&mdash;With a view to this, I &s;hall further di&s;cour&s;e from the&s;e words: Which naturally lead us,</P>
<P>IN the Fir&s;t place, to take notice of the malicious, crafty and evil machinations, plots and devices of the wicked again&s;t the ju&s;t.</P>
<P>AND then, Secondly, To &s;hew in what manner their unju&s;t, proud and in&s;olent proceedings will turn to their own &s;hame, di&s;grace or infamy.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, WE are to take notice of the malici|ous, crafty and evil machinations, plots and devices of the wicked again&s;t the ju&s;t. It is here a&s;&s;erted that the wicked plotteth again&s;t the ju&s;t: For wi&s;e rea&s;ons and holy ends they are permitted to do &s;o, by the wi&s;e and righteous Governor of the world; he permits them to take their cour&s;e in contriving wick|edne&s;s, that their de&s;truction may be of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall begin at the foundation of the plotting of the wicked again&s;t the ju&s;t, and follow them from the beginning down to the pre&s;ent day, in as conci&s;e a manner as po&s;&s;ible; from which we &s;hall be able, in the application, to a&s;certain the true character of each, and make it appear, to which the one and the other belong, in the pre&s;ent &s;truggle betwen Great-Britain, and the UNITED COLONIES of AMERICA.</P>
<P>WE would ob&s;erve then, that there is a rooted ha|tred &amp; enmity in the hearts of the ungodly again&s;t both God and his people: There is that in them, which is contrary to holine&s;s, righteou&s;ne&s;s and purity; for this rea&s;on they are &s;aid to be of their father the devil,
<PB N="7" REF="014755_0006_0F94DB3BBAB6F9B0">
who&s;e works they do. They imitate him in contriv|ing every wile and &s;tratagem po&s;&s;ible to be invented by them, to bring ruin and de&s;truction upon the right|eous people of God, who never meant them any harm, nor ever did them any wrong: This hath been the ca&s;e, ever &s;ince Lucifer, once Son of the morning, but now prince of darkne&s;s, with helli&s;h malice &s;o artful|ly and &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed his devices upon the fir&s;t Parent of the human race: By which one plot he got the world, in a &s;en&s;e, under his dominion; led man|kind captive at his will, and gained them upon his &s;ide again&s;t a righteous and holy God. Hence he is called the God of this world, and the prince of the power of the air; and is &s;aid to be that &s;pirit, which now worketh in the hearts of the children of di&s;obe|dience: And Chri&s;t hath undertaken to relea&s;e the&s;e captives, "to open the pri&s;on doors to them that are bound, to take them from the dominion and deliver them from the power of Satan, and to bring them into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God." And the great Captain of our &s;alvation will not cea&s;e to ride forth conquering and to conquer, till he hath wholly &s;poiled the principalities and powers of dark|ne&s;s; led captivity captive, and de&s;troyed him that hath the power of death, that is the devil. This is the foundation of the quarrel which Satan hath rai&s;ed and continues in the world: And he carries on his de|&s;igns by deceit, low-cunning and craft; he works in the dark, under handed, under ground; and &s;o do his imps; hence he is called the prince of darkne&s;s, and his chil|dren the children of darkne&s;s; and both an&s;wer the character. In oppo&s;ition to the&s;e the ju&s;t are called the children of light; who always act above ground, and are open and fair in their proceedings, and do the thing that is lawful and right: But the wicked never &s;tick at the ba&s;ene&s;s of an action, no matter how vile, nor how cruel, if it hath but the appearance of &s;ub&s;erv|ing their malicious de&s;igns, in gratifying their rage, pride, or lu&s;ts. It is enough to put them upon the
<PB N="8" REF="014755_0007_0F94DD78BA0F4BE8">
mo&s;t inhuman and bloody actions, to &s;ee but the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of accompli&s;hing their wicked de&s;igns: Thus Cain, that fir&s;t child of the evil one, in a &s;ly under hand|ed manner ro&s;e up again&s;t, and &s;lew his righteous bro|ther. And this hath been the manner of the wicked from the beginning to the pre&s;ent day; whatever they do or devi&s;e again&s;t the righteous, it is unju&s;t, and they endeavour as much as po&s;&s;ible to devi&s;e and practi&s;e it in the dark. And, &s;hould we look through their pro|ceedings as far as we are able, we &s;hould find, that this hath been their manner; we &s;hould &s;ee a great deal of cunning policy and artful contrivance, dark &s;chemes, and deep plots of the mo&s;t black and helli&s;h nature a|gain&s;t the people of God. But &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that this is the very nature of the kingdom of darkne&s;s; it is upheld, promoted, and carried on by darkne&s;s and iniquity, as well in large bodies and communities, as in the hearts of particular per&s;ons: And this is always the ca&s;e, except when they have got &s;uch power in their hands as to think there is no danger of mi&s;carrying in their wicked de&s;igns; and then they will be open, bold and bare-faced, being &s;ure to drive all before them: And this power for a while is &s;ometimes given them. Thus, &s;aith Chri&s;t to his malicious per&s;ecutors, "this is your hour, and the power of darkne&s;s." And they delight to work in the dark&mdash;&s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light&mdash;chu&s;e not to &s;ee it, and even court decep|tion, when pur&s;uing their malicious de&s;igns: Thus did that proud and haughty Monarch Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and Saul, king of I&s;rael, and the chief rulers among the Jews in Chri&s;t's time, &amp;c. And the king|dom of Antichri&s;t hath been upheld to this day, by keeping the people in ignorance and practi&s;ing de|ceit upon them; "by many dark &s;igns and lying won|ders the nations have been deceived;" and in no o|ther way could they uphold their kingdom, and pro|ceed in their evil devices; for, &s;hould the light of the truth be admitted, and di&s;per&s;e the dark clouds of igno|rance and error, in which it is involved; that king|dom
<PB N="9" REF="014755_0008_0F94DD7981A49FB0">
would &s;hake to its very foundations, and totter to the ground. And the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping out of &s;ight, in order to carry into execution their diabolical plans, hath introduced this maxim, that deception is a nece&s;|&s;ary qualification to con&s;titute a man an able poli|tician: And it is &s;o&mdash;where wickedne&s;s is at the bot|tom, in laying plots and concerting &s;chemes of a hell|i&s;h nature, which will not endure the light of the &s;un; the&s;e mu&s;t be carried into execution, in darkne&s;s, by deception. Upon this principle it is that the papal hierarchy have always been devi&s;ing mi&s;chief and practi&s;ing deceit, to de&s;troy the prote&s;tants (whom they call hereticks) from off the face of the earth. And &s;o wicked and abandoned are they, &s;o full of deceit, that they have often made oaths, promi&s;es and &s;olemn prote&s;tations, for no other purpo&s;e than to deceive; and, whenever it appears for their intere&s;t, make no &s;cruple to break over them all. And nothing is too bad for them to do; no matter what, if it hath but the appearance of affording them the lea&s;t help and a&s;&s;i&s;|tance in de&s;troying or extirpating the people of the Lord: Witne&s;s their endeavours once and again to place the Pretender on the throne of England; their powder plot, &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND at this day Britons have joined hands with them in this, to violate oaths, break promi&s;es and &s;o|lemn engagements: The faith of kings is regarded as nothing; &s;olemn charters, the agreement between a king and his &s;ubjects (which &s;hould ever be held as &s;acred) are &s;et at nought, broken over, troden under foot, &amp;c. and no &s;tone hath been left unturned, no &s;cheme unattempted, nor plot undevi&s;ed, how villainous &s;oever, if attended with any con&s;iderable pro&s;pect of annoying, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and reducing us to a &s;tate of vile &s;ubjection, and ba&s;e &s;ervitude. Ob&s;erve their &s;everal &s;teps, attempting, fir&s;t, by &s;ubtil devices and deep laid plots; then by big words, threatning our de&s;tructi|on; then by endeavours to rob, impoveri&s;h and &s;tarve us into a ba&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and then by open violence,
<PB N="10" REF="014755_0009_0F94DD7A4A9939F0">
with every in&s;trument of death pointed at our brea&s;ts, to de&s;troy, or force us to bow our necks, and take upon them the yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion, tyranny and &s;er|vitude. All this is couched under Acts of the Bri|ti&s;h Senate: The revenue Acts, the Quebec Bill, the Bo&s;ton Port Bill, the fi&s;hery Bill, and the bloody Act, which dooms the American Colonies in a &s;tate of ac|tual rebellion, for nothing but a&s;&s;erting, and main|taining our ju&s;t rights, liberties and privileges. Ne|ver was there a more bare-faced plotting of the wicked again&s;t the ju&s;t from the beginning till now; for there never was a people more loyal to their King, never any that &s;hewed greater fidelity and all due &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, till our rights and liberties were encroached up|on, without the lea&s;t provocation given. They then plotted our ruin, when we gloried in being the obe|dient &s;ubjects of England's King; long did they try to keep behind the curtain, and in darkne&s;s hide their ba&s;e and evil intentions; but this being impracticable, through the vigilance of tho&s;e who&s;e brea&s;ts were fil|led with patriotic virtue, and who&s;e di&s;cernment was too great not to &s;ee through their dark and malici|ous de&s;igns, who giving notice thereof to the people, with united voices, they proclaim aloud, <HI>liberty and property; down with oppre&s;&s;ion:</HI> Which voice reach|ed the ears of King, Lords and Commons, who were &s;o enraged at our di&s;covery of the &s;nare &s;et for us, and our re&s;olutions not to be tamely &s;hackled with the fetters of &s;lavery, that they gna&s;hed upon us with their teeth: The <HI>Lion</HI> rou&s;ed, with grim and horrible looks, and with open mouth ru&s;hed, to &s;eize his prey; flu&s;h|ed with the hopes of certain and &s;peedy conque&s;t, they di&s;dained our remon&s;trances, nor would they li&s;ten to our humble petitions: Nothing would &s;atisfy their ra|pacious appetites, &s;hort of an ab&s;olute &s;urrender of our liberty and property into their hands; we mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and acknowledge that they have a right to bind us by acts of their own in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, or &s;uffer the utmo&s;t that their power and policy, rage
<PB N="11" REF="014755_0010_0F94DD7B06E7D668">
and malice could inflict upon us; there was no alter|native: Therefore, upon our non-&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they &s;oon began their horrid and bloody de&s;ign; when God and nature, ju&s;tice to our&s;elves, and po&s;terity, love to our country, to our wives and children, and the blood of our fellow country-men, wantonly &s;pilled upon the ground, called loud upon us to ru&s;h to arms; we obeyed; and, thro' the interpo&s;ition of heaven, &s;ucce&s;s hath hitherto remarkably crowned our endeavours, to fru&s;trate their evil de&s;igns, to bring to nought their deep laid plots, and make their &s;chemes abortive. Di&s;appointment, &s;hame and confu&s;ion hath hitherto fallen upon them; and thus it is with the wicked, in their malicious plotting again&s;t the ju&s;t, and gna&s;hing upon them with their teeth.</P>
<P>THE manner of its being effected, was the next thing to be &s;hewn. We proceed then to &s;hew,</P>
<P>Secondly, IN what manner their unju&s;t, proud, &s;ub|til and in&s;olent proceedings will turn to their own &s;hame, di&s;grace, or infamy.</P>
<P>HERE it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that God often &s;uffers the wicked to proceed to great lengths, before he laughs at them; permits them to proceed with &s;uch an high hand, as to make the righteous fear, that they will drive all before them; but however &s;ucce&s;sful they may be in any of their enterprizes, tho&s;e that tru&s;t in God, and believe his word, have no rea&s;on to be di&s;|couraged, or to give up a righteous cau&s;e on that ac|count: If this &s;hould now be the ca&s;e; &s;hould our e|nemies appear mo&s;t formidable in their preparations, and like a flood threaten to &s;wallow us up, and be in any mea&s;ure &s;ucce&s;sful again&s;t us; it &s;hould &s;erve, not to di&s;courage, but make us cleave fa&s;ter and de|pend more upon the Lord of Ho&s;ts and the God of armies; believing that he will in due time di&s;appoint and confound them: This word is enough to keep up our &s;pirits, &s;o long as we make God our tru&s;t and refuge, the Lord &s;hall laugh at him, for he &s;eeth that his day is coming: For there is nothing, that they can devi&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="014755_0011_0F94DD7BC4EBA0D8">
or plot, but what God permits, nor can they proceed an inch farther, in carrying their &s;chemes into execu|tion, than he &s;uffers them; and, when they have pro|ceeded &s;o far as that their &s;hame and di&s;grace &s;hall be mo&s;t con&s;picuous, or fall with the greate&s;t weight up|on them, then will be the time for the Lord to laugh at them and pour contempt upon them. And this is brought about by various means; as God in his infinite wi&s;dom &s;ees fit and be&s;t, &s;ometimes in one way and manner, and &s;ometimes in another; but by what&s;oever method, or means it is effected, we &s;hould always remember, that God's hand is principal: When the wicked are put to confu&s;ion and &s;hame, and infamy comes upon them, it is the Lord's doing; and God's people &s;hould attribute it, not to them&s;elves, as if by their &s;uperior wi&s;dom, &s;trength or courage, they had put their enemies to confu&s;ion, flight or &s;hame. For if we have wi&s;dom, re&s;olution and bravery to make a bold and manly &s;tand, this &s;hould be attributed to God, and all the &s;ucce&s;s of it to him, who "giveth power to the faint, and encrea&s;eth &s;trength to them that have no might."</P>
<P>BUT the way and manner in which he mo&s;t com|monly effects their &s;hame and di&s;grace, is, by permit|ting them to concert their &s;chemes and lay their plots in &s;ecret, and to proceed in &s;uch a manner as to rai&s;e their expectations high, pre&s;uming their plans to be &s;o well concerted, as that nothing can di&s;appoint them; and, when they have got ripe for execution, to bla&s;t all their hopes, fru&s;trate their evil de&s;igns, and many times turn the mi&s;chief they intended to others upon their own heads; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ver. 14 and 15. of the context.</NOTE> and this by means that they lea&s;t tho't of, and which were looked upon by them, as in&s;ig|nificant and not worthy their notice. And the more de&s;picable the means are, by which it is effected, &s;o much the more con&s;picuous is the hand of God; and nothing can be more apparent; unle&s;s, where means are made u&s;e of, that are above the reach of men; as
<PB N="13" REF="014755_0012_0F94DD7C85C101D8">
when the &s;tars in their cour&s;es, the winds, waves, &amp;c, are employed (as is often the ca&s;e) to put a &s;top to the evil proceedings of the wicked. And being unable to execute their malicious purpo&s;es, and having lift|ed up them&s;elves upon high rai&s;ed hopes and expec|tations; priding, vaunting and boa&s;ting of &s;ure &s;uc|ce&s;s in their enterprizes; di&s;appointment under the&s;e circum&s;tances falls with a double weight upon their heads, bringing an in&s;upportable load of &s;hame and di&s;grace. Thus oftentimes God pours contempt upon Princes, and makes proud in&s;olent oppre&s;&s;ors gna&s;h their teeth for rage at their di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES God opens their eyes and gives them to &s;ee their folly in their unju&s;t and evil proceedings; and &s;hame and confu&s;ion cover their faces.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES by putting fear, dread and terror into their hearts, by which they are rendered unfit and un|able to proceed in their evil de&s;igns. This, He, who hath all hearts in his hand, can, and often doth effect, by the &s;malle&s;t means. A rumour is &s;ufficient to di&s;|hearten and affrighten the A&s;&s;yrian ho&s;t. 2 Kings xix.7. Yea the &s;ound of a &s;haken leaf is enough to cha&s;e and make them flee, as if flying from the &s;word; and in their flight to de&s;troy each other, Lev. xxvi.36. This was remarkably the ca&s;e, when the Midianites, Amalekites, and all the children of the Ea&s;t, an innumerable multitude, were routed and put to confu&s;ion by Gideon, with his three hundred men, Judges vii.21, 22.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES by bringing to light their dark de&s;igns and &s;etting them in open view, &s;hame and di&s;grace is bro't upon the contrivers; and when malicious, deep laid plots are di&s;covered and laid open; the wicked machinators will gnaw their tongues with rage, at their overthrow: And God often makes the means, which they u&s;e to bring about their wicked purpo&s;es, to effect their own &s;hame, and &s;o "taketh the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="014755_0013_0F94DD7D43C9C5B8">GOD knows how to deal with all the wicked, how far to let them proceed in their evil de&s;igns, and when is the be&s;t time to put a &s;top to their evil proceedings; and, when that time comes, he will then do it in his own way and manner, which is always the be&s;t: God's own people may &s;ometimes think it is time for God to a|ri&s;e and work for their &s;alvation and for the de&s;tructi|on of their enemies, long before it is accompli&s;hed; no doubt, but I&s;rael of old when they &s;hook off the yoke of Egyptian bondage, and were pur&s;ued by Pharaoh and his mighty ho&s;t, thought it was time for God to ap|pear for them, before they were &s;o hemed in as to &s;ee no po&s;&s;ible way of e&s;cape: But the event proved that God's time was the be&s;t time, and mo&s;t for his glo|ry and their &s;afety.</P>
<P>THE wicked may be permitted to accompli&s;h &s;ome of their evil purpo&s;es again&s;t the ju&s;t; but in the end they will be fru&s;trated and put to &s;hame; thus Saul could never wholly effect his malicious purpo&s;es a|gain&s;t David; tho' he long pur&s;ued him and hunted him as a Partridge upon the mountains, he was always di&s;appointed, confounded and often a&s;hamed: Many a time Saul thought it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for David to avoid his fury, yet always a way was found out for his e&s;cape; and thus the Lord laughs at the wicked, by &s;uffering them to build high, on the foundation which they think is laid deep and &s;trong, and, when their day is come, to di&s;concert their plans and fru&s;|trate all their evil de&s;igns: And this is what is in|tended by the expre&s;&s;ion, the Lord &s;hall laugh at him, for he &s;eeth his day is coming; a day, a &s;et day there is for them to be ca&s;t down and brought into deri&s;i|on, a day for their high looks to be brought low, and for the proud to be aba&s;ed; thus was it with proud Pharaoh, he was lifted up on high, with &s;ure expec|tations of de&s;troying the I&s;raelites and dividing the &s;poil, flu&s;hed with the hopes of certain &s;ucce&s;s, he ru&s;hes forward, till his glory, his pomp and his multi|tude are altogether buried in the &s;ea.</P>

<P>And, fir&s;t, WHAT hath been &s;aid &s;hould &s;erve to pre|vent the people of God, from complaining of, fretting again&s;t or finding fault with Him or his providence, for &s;uffering the wicked to become great, to plot again&s;t the ju&s;t and to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ucce&s;sful in their evil de&s;igns; but, on the contrary, the more &s;piteful and malicious they are, the greater they be and the more they &s;ucceed in their wicked purpo&s;es, &s;o much the more &s;hould God's people, with humble depen|dance look up to and wait upon him, who is higher than the highe&s;t, greater than the greate&s;t, and wi&s;er than the wi&s;e&s;t of them: Nothing doubting but that he, who knows how to re&s;erve the prince of dark|ne&s;s and all his legions, under chains of darkne&s;s, to the judgment of the great day; knows how far to &s;uffer tho&s;e, who belong to his family to proceed, and no further can they go: Let us then, who pro|fe&s;s to have the <HI>Lord</HI> for our God, believe and re&s;t &s;atisfied in this, that the Lord &s;eeth his day is com|ing. Let us confide in him, who knoweth both how, and when is the be&s;t time to re&s;train and di&s;appoint them. And this is the be&s;t policy, that the children of God can make u&s;e of, even, to leave all with God, in confident hope and firm tru&s;t, that he will find means to extricate his faithful people out of all their difficulties; that he will take care of them, prevent what they fear, and bring about all events in the i&s;&s;ue to their full &s;atisfaction: Their enemies in due time &s;hall be impotent, a&s;hamed or de&s;troyed; and the

righteous at la&s;t be made to triumph over them all. Only tru&s;t in the Lord and do good, and u&s;e the means, that are put into our hands, and then we need not fear what man can do unto us: If we are care|ful to mind our duty, fear God and keep his com|mandments, and are truly conformed to the character of the righteous, we may then be certain, that the tri|umphing of the wicked will be &s;hort, that the Lord will laugh at them, bring deri&s;ion and contempt upon them, and never &s;uffer them to devi&s;e evil devices or plot mi&s;chief and execute it any further than He in his infinite wi&s;dom &s;ees fit and be&s;t, even be&s;t for us. Ver. 32.3. of the context.</P>
<P>NOT but that God's people may for a time &s;uffer greatly by them: The righteous may be brought low by rebukes of providence for their &s;ins, as &s;ome &s;in cleaves to the mo&s;t upright among men, and will do &s;o, till they put off their robes of mortality: But the cha&s;ti&s;ements they endure are &s;o far from being hurt|ful, that they are really &s;ub&s;ervient to their good; they reap profit and benefit from them: The wicked indeed plot their mi&s;chief, their ruin; but God means it for good. This it becomes us &s;o firmly to believe, as to refer all to God and leave it with him, by his wi&s;e and good providence to di&s;po&s;e of all our concerns as he plea&s;es: To tru&s;t wholly in him, to bring all to a good i&s;&s;ue, with full &s;atisfaction that all is well, is be&s;t, that God doth. Our part is to mind and do our duty, and then leave the event with God: Leave it with him to take care of and deal with tho&s;e, "who are the &s;candals and burthens, the blemi&s;hes and common nu&s;ances of the earth." We &s;hould not therefore fret at God or be any ways unea&s;y, as tho' God was unkind to his church and people, in &s;uffer|ing &s;uch malicious, &s;ly, crafty and &s;ubtil men to live, pro&s;per and prevail as they do; for he never would, if he had not wi&s;e de&s;igns to an&s;wer by them: This we &s;hould al&s;o believe, and therefore not fret our|&s;elves

<P>LOOK upon wicked Pharaoh; &s;ee how he was per|mitted to afflict and di&s;tre&s;s the people, who&s;e God was the <HI>Lord</HI>; and they then thought, that all the&s;e things were again&s;t them; that their God was unkind to them, when in truth it was only to make way for their freedom from bondage and &s;lavery, to let the op|pre&s;&s;ed go free: Which could not be effected &s;o ea&s;ily by any other means. Had not their burthens been in&s;upportable, beyond what they were able to bear; perhaps it might have been impo&s;&s;ible for Mo&s;es to have per&s;uaded them to leave the tyrant's &s;ervice; but their grievous impo&s;itions, which Pharaoh intend|ed as a means to keep them all under his iron yoke, had directly the contrary effect; it united them toge|ther, and made them all with one heart and mind re|&s;olve to be free. Such in&s;tances we &s;hould now re|member, to keep us from anxious di&s;quietude, and to encourage our hope and tru&s;t in that God, who brings good out of evil. Perhaps in this view, we may &s;ee much of the goodne&s;s, mercy and loving-kindne&s;s of our God towards us, and our children, even in tho&s;e things which in them&s;elves, and for the pre&s;ent, are not joyous, but grievous; and this &s;hould al&s;o &s;erve to keep us from fretting or complaining, and make us acquie&s;ce, and with patience wait for the event, till the end be: Only let us be careful to improve pre&s;ent troubles a|right; this we mu&s;t do, in order for a well ground|ed hope, that good to us, to our po&s;terity and land, will come out of all this evil.</P>
<P>PERHAPS our God, by the&s;e commotions, contenti|ons, di&s;turbances and overtures, is about to lay a firm foundation for the la&s;ting future peace, tranquility and liberty of the&s;e <HI>American Colonies</HI> for ages and ge|nerations yet to come: Hitherto, every thing bears this favourable a&s;pect!

enemies have made u&s;e of, to bring and keep us under their power and controul, are much the &s;ame which Pharaoh, Egypt's haughty Monarch u&s;ed, and they have as yet had the &s;ame effect: Their &s;chemes to oppre&s;s, divide, and then &s;ubjugate the&s;e Colonies, have &s;erved to unite our hearts, as one man, to ca&s;t off the burthens they have been impo&s;ing upon us: And there is no way, which could be thought of, that would &s;o &s;peedily and &s;o firmly have united us together, as the ways by them taken to divide and oppre&s;s us. Our God hath &s;o ordered and di&s;po&s;ed of the means, which they wickedly devi&s;ed and u&s;ed, as to make them have directly the contrary effect to what they intended by them: "This is the Lord's doing and is marvellous in our eyes." The&s;e things con&s;idered &s;hould prevent all hard thoughts of our God, who in the mid&s;t of judgment remembers mercy, and gives us &s;o much rea&s;on to think, that he de&s;igns good un|to us, if we will but cleave fa&s;t unto him. See the &s;ix fir&s;t ver&s;es of this P&s;alm.</P>
<P>Secondly, WE may learn from what hath been &s;aid, how to di&s;tingui&s;h between the plots of the wicked, and the proceedings of the ju&s;t. Wicked men de|vi&s;e evil devices; they <HI>plot,</HI> they work in the dark, &s;aying, no eye &s;eeth us, they hate the light, le&s;t their evil deeds &s;hould be reproved; but the righteous, who are ever oppo&s;ed to the wicked, are of upright conver&s;ation, are open and fair in their proceedings, are de&s;irous of, and endeavour to &s;et things in a true light; their works are not works of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>AND here it may not be ami&s;s at this time, when we are engaged in &s;o great a conte&s;t and weighty af|fair, as oppo&s;ing by force of arms tho&s;e whom we once revered, in who&s;e welfare and pro&s;perity we re|joiced, and in who&s;e glory we gloried, as our own; who have unnaturally become our foes. premeditately ri&s;en up again&s;t us, plotted and threatened our ruin; to

run &s;omething of a parallel between the conduct of the Briti&s;h nation and that of the&s;e Colonies, by which we &s;hall &s;ee clearly, who are tho&s;e wicked, that are now plotting again&s;t the ju&s;t.</P>
<P>WE would ob&s;erve then, that it is an infallible mark of the wicked's plotting, when by &s;ubtilty and craft, or open violence, they endeavour the hurt of tho&s;e, that have done them no wrong, nor given them any ju&s;t provocation. The fir&s;t wicked plot, that was ever concerted in this our world, was by a mo&s;t wick|ed apo&s;tate, again&s;t tho&s;e that never did him wrong, nor afforded him the lea&s;t ju&s;t provocation. His envy and malice was enough to urge him on to the de&s;truc|tion of millions; and ever &s;ince envy and ill will are continually &s;triking at the felicity, tranquillity and growing opulency of the brave and good. How e|vidently doth this character belong to tho&s;e that have ri&s;en up again&s;t us? They then began to plot our ruin, when we were at ea&s;e and quiet, and had done them no wrong; yea then, when we were doing them all the good in our power; had been a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, at the expence of our blood and trea&s;ure to acquire va&s;t ter|ritories to the Briti&s;h crown; and were carrying into their bo&s;om all our riches; they then framed an act,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE STAMP ACT</NOTE> which, if it had been put into execution, we had now been wearing out our lives in more than Egyptian bondage; and ever &s;ince, all the craft and &s;ub|tilty they were ma&s;ters of hath been employed, to bring us effectually under the yoke of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Which leads to another ob&s;ervation,</P>
<P>THAT it is a &s;ure mark of the wicked's plotting, when they endeavour to hide the truth; and, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to keep their evil de&s;igns out of &s;ight. How exactly hath this been the ca&s;e with ad|mini&s;tration? They would fain make us believe, that they meant us no harm, that they had no de&s;ign of
<PB N="20" REF="014755_0019_0F94DD81C8C78730">
depriving us of our rights, liberty or property, even then, when they were endeavouring by deep laid plots to effect it. They worked as it were in the dark, out of &s;ight; and tried every method, that their cunning and &s;ubtilty could invent, to make us implicitly ac|knowledge, that they had a right to put their hands into our pockets, and take a little from thence, with|out our con&s;ent, that &s;o they might in proce&s;s of time come at the whole. But, when by all their art and policy they could not bring us to &s;ubmit to this; when they perceived, that we &s;aw thro' their dark de&s;igns, and would not believe them, though they a&s;&s;erted never &s;o &s;trongly that they meant us no hurt, while they were endeavouring to rob us of our rights and properties; they then &s;hewed them&s;elves; and plainly declared what they were after, to make us &s;ervants, tributary to them. And, thinking that they had power &s;ufficient to do with us as they plea&s;ed; they then became open and bare-faced in their proceedings; their language then was, own us for your ma&s;ters, or receive the point of the bayonet in your brea&s;ts.&mdash;And wicked plots and devices require wicked and ba&s;e means to execute and accompli&s;h them, as one lie requires another to &s;up|port it. Therefore, we may ob&s;erve further,</P>
<P>THAT it is an undoubted &s;ign of the wicked's plot|ting again&s;t the ju&s;t, when they pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures to bring about their malicious de&s;igns, as are evil in them&s;elves. For as truth needs no lie to &s;upport it; &s;o a ju&s;t cau&s;e doth not require unju&s;t mea&s;ures to defend it. But with regard to Britain, may we not &s;ay, that truth is fallen in the &s;treets, and equity can|not enter? For what means have they not u&s;ed to blind, deceive and hide the truth, and to promote fal&s;hood and lies? They have even courted decep|tion and would never li&s;ten to the true &s;tate of facts, tho' &s;et before them as clear as the &s;un. And tho&s;e on this &s;ide the water, who have joined with them,

And &s;ince they have drawn the &s;word, what have they left undone, which they thought would have the lea&s;t tendency to di&s;|tre&s;s and de&s;troy us? It appears plain, that they look|ed upon nothing too bad to do unto us; no mea&s;ures, however ba&s;e, vile and inhuman, have been omitted either before or &s;ince the commencement of ho&s;tili|ties: What could be more cruel, unmerciful and un|ju&s;t, than their &s;everal acts again&s;t us? One was made with a manife&s;t de&s;ign to encourage murder, by making provi&s;ion to protect the murderers: Another vacates the Charter of a province (ever loyal to it's King) upon the ground of a fal&s;e report: Another to &s;tarve and impoveri&s;h one of the mo&s;t populous towns on the continent: What could be more cruel, unmerciful and unju&s;t? But, this not an&s;wering their malicious de&s;igns, they extended their cruelty to the four New-England Colonies, &s;toping the avenues of our riches, by depriving us of the fi&s;hery, which God and nature had put into our hands; and when this proved ineffectual, behold them enlarging their un|merciful cruelty to every province, that would dare to &s;tand up for us: And then, to crown all, drew the &s;word and prepared every in&s;trument of cruelty and death, to &s;end de&s;olation and de&s;truction through our whole land. And what unwearied pains have they taken, and what cruel and barbarous &s;chemes and helli&s;h plots have they laid? Negroes and Indians, Barbarians, Infidels and Papi&s;ts, have all been appli|ed to by our malicious foes. Surely had their cau&s;e been righteous; were they not wickedly plotting a|gain&s;t the ju&s;t, they would not have wanted &s;uch ba&s;e props as the&s;e to &s;upport it; nor accept them if offer|ed.

Add to all this, their u&s;ing every &s;tratagem po&s;|&s;ible, in the mo&s;t &s;ecret manner, to &s;tir up the Ne|groes in the mid&s;t of us, to cut our throats at una|wares, and to &s;et the Savages and Roman Catholicks, like blood-hounds on our backs, while they like lions (as they term them&s;elves) were rou&s;ed, and came to meet us with open mouths, gaping for their prey; mo&s;t furiou&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly gna&s;hing upon us with their teeth; filled with rage and indignation, threat|ening to eat us up; yea, &s;o big as to devour us at a mouthful, and &s;pread de&s;olation far and wide, by fire and &s;word.

<P>THEN the whole United Provinces by their Con|gre&s;s, &s;tated matters mo&s;t fairly; held up truth to light, and humbly petitioned for redre&s;s of grievan|ces, they a&s;ked for no more; but were an&s;wered with the bayonet pointed at our brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>OUR Congre&s;s, cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e of effecting a happy reconciliation between Great-Britain and the&s;e Colonies, were in&s;ulted, treated with the utmo&s;t &s;corn and contempt, and looked upon as nothing, and le&s;s than nothing.</P>
<P>AND the mea&s;ures we have taken to &s;ave our land from the threatened ruin, have ever been ju&s;t, hone&s;t and upright; whatever hath been done, that may be fairly attributed to the people of the&s;e Co|lonies, in their conduct towards England's King and his mini&s;try, well de&s;erves the above epithets The doings of particular per&s;ons, &s;mall communities, or a number ri&s;ing and doing unju&s;tly, is not to be attri|buted to whole towns, much le&s;s to whole provinces.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus we are free from being chargeable with the de&s;truc|tion of the India TEA, &s;ent hither by Act of Parliament. It was not the act of a colony or even of a town, but only of a &s;mall number of per&s;ons in di&s;gui&s;e.</NOTE></P>
<P>ALL that we have done (as a people) be&s;ides pray|ing them to de&s;i&s;t from their evil de&s;igns and rea&s;on|ing with them, hath been only to defend our&s;elves from their unju&s;t encroachments. And they com|pelled us to arms, by fir&s;t un&s;heathing the &s;word and
<PB N="26" REF="014755_0025_0F94DD8648DB2A88">
laying a number of our fellow countrymen dead on the ground:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">At Lexington a company of Militia were fired upon in cool blood, by troops of George the 3d. only for appearing un|der arms in their training field; &s;ix were killed on the &s;pot. This commenced the war between Great-Britain and America; which was on the 19th of April, 1775.</NOTE> Who&s;e innocent blood would have cried to God again&s;t us, had we not pur&s;ued the murderers and endeavoured to bring them to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>WE may now a&s;k what evil have we done to Great-Britain? Was it an evil for us to endeavour to open their blind eyes? Was it an evil for us to try, by humble prayers, to &s;often their hard hearts? Was it an evil for us to remon&s;trate again&s;t mo&s;t iniquitous pro|ceedings? Or was it an evil for us to defend our|&s;elves, our wives and our little ones from the jaws of that <HI>roaring Lion</HI> who had rou&s;ed him&s;elf, and with open mouth ru&s;hed to &s;eize his prey gna&s;hed up|on us with his teeth; yea, who&s;e cruel jaws were reaking in the gore of human fle&s;h? We may not forget to ob&s;erve another part of our conduct, which hath been derided by them. As a people we have once and again been called upon, by tho&s;e whom we have &s;et to rule over us, to humble our&s;elves in the &s;ight of God, and to implore his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and direc|tion in all our concerns; and tho' many there be, that are for&s;aking the Lord, and &s;till live in &s;in, notwith|&s;tanding all his judgments upon us, yet it is to be hoped, that many of God's people among us, have learnt righteou&s;ne&s;s by the judgments that have been abroad in our land; which have cau&s;ed them to live nearer to him, and to walk more humbly and prayer|fully before him.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, If a ble&s;&s;ing attending the means, and &s;ucce&s;s the endeavours of a people, be any mark of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the cau&s;e; never was it more
<PB N="27" REF="014755_0026_0F94DD8702FA15C0">
con&s;picuou&s;s than at this day; never had a people more rea&s;on to take notice of the interpo&s;ition of heaven in their favour than we; who by the help of the Lord have been enabled to ri&s;e as it were from nothing, to a force &s;ufficient to with&s;tand our enemies, and get the better of them every way: From <HI>North</HI> to <HI>South</HI> &s;ucce&s;s hath in a mo&s;t remarkable manner crowned our endeavours. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;peed, with which the reduction of ST. JOHN's and MONTREAL was accompli&s;hed, and the few lives that were lo&s;t, were very remarkable: And to the Southward, di&s;covering and di&s;|concerting an horrid plan to rai&s;e an army of Tories and Ne|groes, routing and driving Lord Dunmore and his forces from the land: And now the &s;trong hold of BOSTON is given up into our hands, &amp;c. &amp;c. and but four or five lives lo&s;t.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND it is not to us that the &s;ucce&s;s is to be attributed; for the &s;tars in their cour&s;es have fought for us, the winds and the waves have de&s;troy|ed thou&s;ands:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This refers to the de&s;truction brought upon them by the immediate hand of God, and it may be proper to mention &s;ome few in&s;tances of this kind of the many which might be men|tioned; the de&s;truction of their fi&s;hing fleet by a violent &s;torm, in October la&s;t. whereby mo&s;t of their ve&s;&s;els were lo&s;t, and up|wards of a thou&s;and &s;ouls peri&s;hed. What renders this the more remarkable is, that the&s;e men were to join the army under General Howe at Bo&s;ton, and the arms that were &s;ent over for them, fell into our hands. Al&s;o the &s;hipwreck, which the fleet met with la&s;t fall, that was de&s;igned for a reinforcement to Ge|neral Howe. by which &s;ome of them were lo&s;t, and the mo&s;t of them rendered unable to proceed on their voyage. The Hano|verians likewi&s;e, in their voyage to England, were &s;hipwrecked and greatly damaged: And al&s;o, late in the fall, one of their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> was &s;truck by lightening and entirely con&s;umed, &amp;c.</NOTE> And God Almighty hath wonderfully pre&s;erved our lives and given us courage, to which mu&s;t be attributed that &s;ucce&s;s which hath attended our enterprizes, and brought confu&s;ion on our foes: that tho&s;e who, but a few months ago, vaunted them|&s;elves again&s;t us, being &s;ure of overcoming us, laugh|ed
<PB N="28" REF="014755_0027_0F94DD87C7514E68">
us to &s;corn, and gna&s;hed their teeth in rage again&s;t us; the Lord having laughed at them and brought forward the day of their confu&s;ion, now gnaw their tongues for di&s;appointment. It is not for what we have done, but for his great name's &s;ake, that he hath dealt thus favourably with us. From all the&s;e things it appears, that the character of the ju&s;t and righte|ous belongs to us, as that of the wicked to them: For the wicked fear where no fear is, and flee when none pur&s;ueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion. Tho&s;e, who called them&s;elves brave and invincible; and us cowardly da&s;tards, have been &s;eized with &s;uch a panic, as none but He, who hath all hearts in his hands, could &s;trike into them: And the re&s;olution and courage, which hath been given to our &s;oldiers, hath been as remarkable.</P>
<P>Thirdly, WE &s;hould now be led to pay our grate|ful acknowledgments to that God. who rules on high and below; who hath taken &s;uch wonderful care of us, &s;aved us from that ruin and de&s;truction, with which we have been threatened, we have lately &s;een the &s;al|vation of the Lord; and to be thankful for what our God hath done for us, and improve pa&s;t favours to his glory, is the way to engage his kindne&s;s, and to be favoured with the continuation of his &s;miles.</P>
<P>AND what rea&s;on have we to be thankful to that God, who hath hitherto re&s;trained the rage, tied the hands, and put fear into the hearts of our enemies, and cau&s;ed them to flee before us. For had they been &s;uffered to &s;ucceed in their malicious de&s;igns: who can conceive of the dreadful havock and de&s;truc|tion, that would have been made? Our land filled with the blood of the &s;lain; we driven from our dwell|ings; our hou&s;es pillaged and burnt; our towns laid in a&s;hes; our fields and vineyards laid wa&s;te; our coun|try &s;poiled, and we either fallen by the &s;word, or be|come tributary &s;ervants to tho&s;e, who&s;e tender mer|cies
<PB N="29" REF="014755_0028_0F94DD88864A1798">
are cruel.&mdash;Let us never forget the goodne&s;s of our God and his kindne&s;s to us: Let it lead us to re|pentance and new obedience, and engage us to faith|fulne&s;s in his &s;ervice. The acqui&s;ition lately made affords abundant matter for thank&s;giving and rejoic|ing; not only to tho&s;e who have long been driven from their beautiful &s;eats and commodious habitati|ons, and may now return to them in &s;afety; but to us all, having obtained (at a very little expence of blood) one of the &s;tronge&s;t holds, the be&s;t fortified towns, and mo&s;t commodious harbour, that our ene|mies have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Fourthly, WE will now conclude with a few words of direction and encouragement to God's people. As we know where our great &s;trength lieth, even in God; let us then tru&s;t all in his hands; let us wait upon him; let us &s;eek to him in every time of need, and, having referred all our important concerns to him, let us not de&s;pair, or be di&s;couraged, though our ene|mies are many, potent, &s;ubtil, crafty and malicious; let both the favours and frowns of God upon us &s;erve to make us fly to him, and to be more earne&s;t with him to interpo&s;e by his grace and providence to re|form us from our wickedne&s;s; to extricate us out of our difficulties; di&s;per&s;e the dark clouds, which hang over our heads; return and vi&s;it us with his loving-kindne&s;s and tender mercies; and make us yet a people beloved of the Lord and favoured by our God: thus let us apply always to him, who can bring to light the darke&s;t, deepe&s;t plots; who can fru&s;trate the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t concerted plan of human politi|cians; who can &s;top the mouths of lions, deliver out of the paw of the bear, chain the tyger and re&s;train the wrath of man: Let us tru&s;t in the Lord, wait al|&s;o on him, and he will bring it to pa&s;s: For he that is higher than the highe&s;t regardeth it: And the Lord &s;hall laugh at them, and bring them into deri&s;ion and contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="014755_0029_0F94DD894472DAE0">TO leave all with God, in the u&s;e of the means af|forded us, is our wi&s;dom, our &s;trength, our &s;afety and our deliverance; for through God we &s;hall do vali|antly, for he it is, that &s;hall tread down our enemies; and the Lord on high is mightier than the noi&s;e of many waters; yea than the many waves of the &s;ea. What then, though the waters roar and be troubled; though the mountains &s;hake and tremble; and the earth be removed; the Lord of Ho&s;ts being with us; the God of Jacob being our refuge; we may even then triumph and rejoice in him; &s;aying, God is in the mid&s;t of us; we &s;hall not be moved; our God &s;hall help us and that right early.</P>
