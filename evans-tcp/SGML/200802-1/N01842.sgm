<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AFTER the Great and Extra|ordinary</HI> Acceptance <HI>which the following</HI> SERMON <HI>met with, from &s;o Numerous and Judicious an</HI> Audience <HI>in the Delivery of it from the</HI> Pulpit, <HI>I cannot but think it will be very acceptable to every one from the</HI> Pre&s;s. <HI>I can by no means therefore comply with the de&s;ire of the Reverend</HI> Author <HI>to me, that I would</HI> Excu&s;e <HI>his yielding to

the Printing of it. I think none that heard it will allow me to &s;ay a word on</HI> that <HI>head: And after &s;uch an uncommon</HI> Attention <HI>as the</HI> Di&s;cour&s;e <HI>com|manded when it was utter'd, there is no room neither left for me to</HI> commend <HI>it to them that heard it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> Author <HI>in a kind and obliging Letter to me a&s;cribes</HI> the unexpected <HI>and</HI> unde&s;erved <HI>Favour of GOD to him,</HI> unto the Prayers of a very religious People, which Heaven hath committed to his Care; <HI>upon whom he had called</HI> to &s;trive together with Him in Prayer to, GOD for him, that his Service might be accepted of the Saints. <HI>And now that it has plea&s;ed GOD to give a remarkable</HI> An&s;wer <HI>unto their Prayers, I be&s;eech Him al&s;o to give 'em</HI> Humblene&s;s of Mind, <HI>whereby they may accept aright and improve His Grace &s;hown them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>IT is a peculiar</HI> Honour <HI>to any Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, (and thro' Grace we have not a few among us who &s;hare in it) when in</HI> retir'd <HI>Places of Service; out of the way of Fame or any worldly reward, they are dili|gent in their Studies and</HI> labouring in the Word and Doctrine, to feed the Flock of
<PB REF="002182_0004_10030C232C7C8108">
GOD among them; Studying to &s;hew them&s;elves approved unto GOD, Work|men that need not to be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth; <HI>that by the help of GOD they may be</HI> wi&s;e to win Souls, <HI>be Ma&s;ters of</HI> acceptable Words, <HI>and meet to</HI> &s;tand <HI>and teach (if called of GOD thereto) before the Greate&s;t of Men. The</HI> Author <HI>is among us a &s;hining</HI> Example <HI>of this Dili|gence and Proficiency, and GOD is plea&s;ed to own and crown his Labours with an un|common Succe&s;s: There being within the&s;e</HI> Three <HI>la&s;t Months added to the Church in</HI> Bradford <HI>no le&s;s than</HI> Forty <HI>and</HI> Six <HI>Per&s;ons: May they indeed be &s;o many</HI> Seals <HI>of his Mini&s;try, and his Joy in the Day of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and the</HI> LORD <HI>add many more to 'em</HI> daily, &s;uch as &s;hall be &s;aved.</P>
<P><HI>MAY their worthy</HI> Pa&s;tor <HI>be long continued, a more abundant Ble&s;&s;ing to them, and a diffu&s;ive one to others: And particularly I pray GOD that this</HI> Martial Lecture Sermon <HI>may be as</HI> profitable <HI>to the Gentlemen of the ARTILLERY COMPANY, and others of us, in the Reading of it, as it was</HI> Plea|&s;ant <HI>in the hearing: That as the</HI> Preacher <HI>was unto</HI> us as a very lovely Song of one

<P>AGREEABLY in the Sacred Oracles we find <HI>Good Soldiers,</HI> &s;till mentioned with Ho|nour: And particularly in our Text, the
<PB N="5" REF="002182_0010_10030C33C058FD40">
Soldiers belonging to the Tribe of <HI>Zebulun</HI> are commended, as being Men that Excel'd in <HI>Martial Qualifications.</HI></P>
<P>IN this <HI>Chapter before us</HI> we've an Ac|count of <HI>Two Mu&s;ters</HI> of the Militia of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> which was partly at <HI>Ziklag,</HI> and more fully at <HI>Hebron,</HI> was <HI>very</HI> con&s;i|derable: for we're told, <HI>ver.</HI> 22. that <HI>there came to David to help him, until it was a Great Ho&s;t, like the Ho&s;t of God:</HI> i. e. <Q>innumera|ble, like the Stars or Angels, which are emirently GOD's Ho&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Second</HI> was a General Mu&s;ter at <HI>Hebron.</HI> Agreeably we read, <HI>Chap.</HI> II. 1. <HI>All I&s;rael gathered them&s;elves to David unto Hebron&mdash;.</HI></P>
<P>Now, Here let usob&s;erve the Great and Noble De&s;ign, the Glorious Occa&s;ion, and Joyful I&s;&s;ue of the&s;e Mu&s;ters.</P>
<P>THE <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of the <HI>Former</HI> Mu&s;ter was to make <HI>David,</HI> King over <HI>Judah;</HI> which they effected to very good Purpo&s;e, and great Satisfaction, and Advantage: and <HI>David</HI> reigned over that Tribe only Seven Years; during which, <HI>there was a long War between the hou&s;e of Saul and the hou&s;e of David:
<PB N="6" REF="002182_0011_10030C387054B228">
But David waxed &s;tronger and &s;tronger, and the hou&s;e of Saul waxed weaker and weaker,</HI> 2 Sam. 3. 1. <HI>David</HI> ro&s;e <HI>gradually;</HI> being fir&s;t Anointed King in <HI>Rever&s;ion;</HI> then in <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>One</HI> Tribe only, and at la&s;t of <HI>All</HI> the Tribes. And thus (&s;ays the Pious and Excellent HENRY) "The Kingdom of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> the Son of <HI>David,</HI> is &s;et up by De|grees: He is Lord of all by Divine De|&s;ignation, but <HI>we &s;ee not yet all things put under Him,</HI> Heb. 2. 8. But, <HI>Lord, How Long!</HI></P>
<P>THE Occa&s;ion of the <HI>Latter</HI> Mu&s;ter was, to <HI>perfect</HI> the Tran&s;lation of the Kingdom of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Saul,</HI> after, the Death of <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth,</HI> to the <HI>Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e</HI> of <HI>David;</HI> or to make <HI>David</HI> King over <HI>All I&s;rael,</HI> ver. 38.</P>
<P>Now the Service, thus done by the <HI>I&s;rae|liti&s;h Regiments</HI> for their Prince and Country: occa&s;ioned <HI>Joy in I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>many Thank&s;|givings to God:</HI> which, with their Military Skill, Ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, Courage, Loyalty and Faithfulne&s;s, is recorded to their Everla&s;t|ing Prai&s;e, and for the Perpetual In&s;truction, Imitation, and Encouragement of that Order of Men: And al&s;o to teach the People of GOD, what Regards are to be paid to Men of their Character.</P>

IN our Text we are informed, 1. Of the <HI>Quota</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Zebulun,</HI> in this Gene|ral Mu&s;ter; They were <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and.</HI> 2. We have their <HI>Character,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of Divers Ar|ticles; which we may particularly Con&s;ider and Explain, in &s;peaking to this <HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI> from the Words, as related to the Context: Scil,</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Good Soldiers are an U&s;eful, and Honourable Order of Men, and a Great Ble&s;&s;ing to their Prince, and Country.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH Soldiers, as are de&s;cribed in our Text, are <HI>no little</HI> part of the <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> of God's I&s;rael. They're an <HI>Honour</HI> to their Prince and Country, and de&s;erve well of both.</P>
<P>IN Di&s;cour&s;ing this Point, I &s;hall, Fir&s;t, con&s;ider the <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> of Soldiers, &s;o far as it is laid before us in our <HI>Text.</HI> Secondly, Endeavour to <HI>confirm the Truth</HI> of our Doctrine.

the Text: or What &s;ort of Soldiers the&s;e <HI>Zebulinites</HI> were.</P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P>1. <HI>THEY were</HI> (what it is proper all, that profe&s;s them&s;elves Soldiers, &s;hould be) <HI>Expert in War. In&s;tructi ad Bellum.</HI> They were not <HI>Raw</HI> and Unacquainted with the very <HI>Rudiments</HI> of Soldiery: but were <HI>well Di&s;ciplin'd,</HI> and like <HI>Abraham's</HI> Servants, <HI>Trained up</HI> in the Art of War.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Field-Officers,</HI> and all under <HI>Autho|rity</HI> among&s;t them, were Men of <HI>Good Con|duct;</HI> knew the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their re&s;pective Po&s;ts, how to behave them&s;elves, and how to govern in an Army, both in the <HI>Camp</HI> and in the <HI>Field of Battel,</HI> according to the U&s;age of tho&s;e Ancient Times. To allude to what is &s;aid of the Men of <HI>I&s;&s;achar, They had Under&s;tanding,</HI> in Military Affairs, <HI>to know what I&s;rael ought to do.</HI> They were no Stran|gers to <HI>Martial Law,</HI> and knew well <HI>When,</HI> and <HI>How</HI> to put it in Execution.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Private Soldiers</HI> were Skilful, and Dextrous in <HI>Handling their Arms,</HI> and Obey|ing the Directions of their Commanders; &s;o as to Defend them&s;elves, and De&s;troy their

Enemies. It was the Commendation of tho&s;e, that came to <HI>David</HI> at <HI>Z<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">klag,</HI> Ver. 2. that <HI>they could u&s;e both the Right Hand and the Left, in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ing Stones, and shooting Arrows cut of a Bow:</HI> And of the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">dites,</HI> ver. 8. that <HI>they could handle Shield and Buckler:</HI> And of the Cho&s;en Men of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> Jud. 20. 16, that <HI>they could every one &s;ling Stones at an hair|breadth, and not mi&s;s:</HI> i. e. with great Exact|ne&s;s.

Men of <HI>Strong Bodies,</HI> able to endure Hard|ne&s;s, and perform great Exploits; <HI>Effective</HI> Men.
