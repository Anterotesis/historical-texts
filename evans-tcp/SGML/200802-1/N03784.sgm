<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE it has plea&s;ed God to give me a true Knowledge of the Doc|trines of Grace, I have frequently thought, that next to the Falling away of the Clergy from the Princi|ples of the Reformation, the Books which are in our Church, founded on the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme, have been the chief Cau&s;e that &s;o many of our own Communion in particu|lar, have built their Hopes of Salvation on a fal&s;e Bottom. The Authors not only led the People Captive in their own Life-time, but al&s;o after their Death, like <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> for a long Sea&s;on have bewitched the People with their Sorceries, I mean their &s;eemingly devout, but at the Bottom, Anti-Chri&s;tian Compo&s;itions. &mdash; The only Way there|fore, to open People's Eyes, I think is this, to &s;hew them, that the Writings, which for &s;ome Years pa&s;t have been &s;o much admired, are directly con|trary to the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; for this Rea&s;on
<PB N="3" REF="004643_0003_100ECA0F2B9B96E8">
I thought it my Duty to bear a publick Te&s;timony again&s;t the Writings of Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on: &mdash; And upon the &s;ame Account, think it my Duty, to point out the fundamental Error of an Author, as much admired and read by the more common, as the Archbi&s;hop by the more learned and polite Sort of People.</P>
<P>I know you are impatient to hear who this can be: If you will promi&s;e me not to be angry, I'll tell you. &mdash; It is that much admired Book called <HI>The whole Duty of Man.</HI> &mdash; Methinks I &s;ee you &s;urpri|zed at the very mentioning of it; but remember, I de&s;ired you not to be angry. &mdash; And if you will throw a&s;ide Prejudice, and are &s;incerely de&s;irous to know and do the divine Will, I am per&s;waded we &s;hall both be of one Mind concerning this Book, e'er you lay this Letter down out of your Hand.</P>
<P>But, before I &s;hew you its Error, to convince you of my Impartiality, I confe&s;s that the Devoti|ons of that Book were once of Service to me. &mdash; And I believe have been u&s;eful to many others. &mdash; The Book in general is calculated to civilize, but I am per&s;waded, it never was a Means of Converting a &s;ingle Soul. &mdash; I have ju&s;t been looking over the Index and General Titles at the End of it, and cannot find the Word Regeneration &s;o much as once mentioned. &mdash; And indeed, the whole Trea|ti&s;e is built on &s;uch a fal&s;e Foundation, as not only proves the Author to be no real Chri&s;tian at Heart, but al&s;o, that he had not &s;o much as a Head Know|ledge of the true Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. To prove this, I need only refer you to Part of the Preface.&mdash; <HI>Of the Nece&s;&s;ity of Caring for the Soul</HI> (Paragraph 17) wherein the Author, talking of the &s;econd Covenant, &s;peaks thus. &mdash;
<Q>This &s;econd Covenant, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> was made with <HI>Adam,</HI> and us in him, pre&s;ently after his Fall, and is briefly contain'd
<PB N="4" REF="004643_0004_100ECA0335F76E00">
in the&s;e Words, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 15. where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman &s;hall break the Ser|pent's Head; And this was made up, as the fir&s;t was, of &s;ome Mercies to be afforded by God, and &s;ome Duties to be performed by us.</Q>
Who, that is any way enlightened, cannot but &s;ee the fal&s;e Divinity and fundamental Errors of this Pa&s;&s;age? For, how can it be proved, that the &s;econd Cove|nant was made with <HI>Adam,</HI> or that God ever en|tered into any Covenant at all with Man, after he had broken the Fir&s;t? It is true, God the Father, did enter into a Covenant (and that from all Eter|nity) with the Second <HI>Adam,</HI> the God-Man, Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in our &s;tead. &mdash; But it cannot be proved, that he made any Second Covenant at all with <HI>Adam</HI> him&s;elf or any of his Po&s;terity.&mdash; But &s;ays our Au|thor,
<Q>He did make a &s;econd Covenant with <HI>A|dam,</HI> and us in him, pre&s;ently after his Fall, and it is briefly contained in the&s;e Words, where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman &s;hall brui&s;e the Serpent's Head.</Q>
&mdash; But I would a&s;k where any Covenant is contained in the&s;e Words, and how it is
<Q>made up, as the fir&s;t was, of &s;ome Mercies to be afforded by God, and &s;ome Duties to be perform'd by us?</Q>
Here is a free Gift and Promi&s;e of Salvation made to <HI>Adam,</HI> but no Cove|nant. Here is not a Word of any Condition men|tioned. &mdash; No, it was the Free Gift of God in Chri&s;t.&mdash; <HI>Adam</HI> was now in a State of Condemna|tion: He was &s;o far from being de&s;irous of enter|ing into Covenant with, that he fled from God, and was not &s;o much as truly convicted of his Sin, as will evidently appear from the Context.&mdash; For both he and his Wife laid the Fault, not upon them&s;elves, but on one another, and on the Serpent. <HI>The Wo|man which thou gave&s;t me</HI> (therein tacitly reflecting upon God for giving him that Woman) <HI>&s;he gave
<PB N="5" REF="004643_0005_100ECA128EA4D338">
me,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Adam, and I did eat. The Serpent beguiled me,</HI> &s;ays the Woman, <HI>and I did eat.</HI> &mdash; Here appears no true Sen&s;e of Sin at all. &mdash; And to &s;hew they had no Notion of a Saviour, we are told, <HI>they &s;ewed Fig Leaves together,</HI> in&s;tead of applying to God, <HI>to cover their Nakedne&s;s,</HI>and afterwards <HI>fled from God, when they heard the Voice of the Lord God walking among the Trees of the Garden.</HI> &mdash; Here then opens that My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, God manife&s;ted in the Fle&s;h. Notwith&s;tanding our fir&s;t Parents had broken the Covenant and had their Hearts hardened, yet out of the Riches of his Free Grace, God had pro|vided a Remedy from all Eternity, and now reveals it in Time. &mdash; <HI>The Seed of the Woman, i. e.</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t (who in all probability was &s;piritually con|ceived that In&s;tant in the Heart of <HI>Eve</HI>) <HI>&s;hall brui&s;e the Serpent's Head, i.e.</HI> by his Obedience and Death, &s;hall &s;atisfy divine Ju&s;tice, fulfil the moral Law in Man's Stead, and thereby deliver him from the Power of the Devil.&mdash; Here are no Terms menti|oned on Man's Part at all: And &s;uppo&s;ing there had been a Covenant made with Man,
<Q>and it had been made up, as the Fir&s;t was, of &s;ome Mercies to be afforded by God, and &s;ome Duties to be performed by us,</Q>
Alas, we are of all Crea|tures the mo&s;t mi&s;erable; for then we are not under Grace but under the Law. &mdash; And if <HI>Adam</HI> could not keep the fir&s;t Covenant, tho' in perfect Inno|cence, how can we, who hate God by Nature, and who&s;e Thoughts are only Evil continually, keep a Second, like unto it? Is not this putting Man into a mo&s;t unhappy Condition, and making his poor imperfect Obedience the Cau&s;e, why Je&s;us Chri&s;t is merciful unto him? And if &s;o, how is Boa&s;ting excluded in the great Work of our Redemption, as the Scriptures every where affirm? And how can Eternal Life be the Free Gift of God thro' Je&s;us
<PB N="6" REF="004643_0006_100ECA1507E98728">
Chri&s;t our Lord? But this is agreeable enough to the Divinity of this Author, who in the 21&s;t Para|graph of this Preface, &s;ays, &mdash;
<Q>The third Thing Chri&s;t was to do for us, was to enable us, or give us Strength, to do what he requires of us. This he doth, Fir&s;t, by taking off from the Hard|ne&s;s of the Law given to <HI>Adam,</HI> which was ne|ver to commit the lea&s;t Sin, upon Pain of Dam|nation, and requiring of us only an holy and hearty Endeavour to do what we are able, and where we fail, accepting of &s;incere Repentance.</Q>
Now I would fain know, where God has taken off from the Hardne&s;s of the Law given unto <HI>Adam,</HI> and required of us only an holy and hearty Endea|vour to do what we are able, and where we fail, accepting of a &s;incere Repentance? This is all as fal&s;e, as God is true. The whole Law is as much in force again&s;t us, as it was again&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> before we believed in Chri&s;t. God has been &s;o far from taking off from the Hardne&s;s of the Law, given to <HI>Adam,</HI> That Je&s;us Chri&s;t declares, <HI>That he came not to de&s;troy, but to fulfil it.</HI> And until convinced of the Obligation we lie under, to obey the whole mo|ral Law, in Thought, Word, and Deed, how can we &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;God's Law was honourable. Je&s;us Chri&s;t fulfilled it in our Stead; and upon Account of that Righteou&s;ne&s;s, imputed to us, and received by Faith, and not on our hearty Endeavour or Repen|tance, are we accepted by him. What is there, in our hearty Endeavour or Repentance, to recom|mend us to the Favour of God, or to render them worthy of being joined with the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t? as tho' that was not &s;ufficient of it&s;elf. &mdash; Our be&s;t Actions are but <HI>&s;plendida peccata,</HI> Glittering Sins. &mdash;
<Q>I cannot pray, <HI>&s;ays the pious Bi&s;hop</HI> Be|veridge, but I &s;in; I cannot hear, or preach a
<PB N="7" REF="004643_0007_100ECA16E0D6F798">
Sermon, but I &s;in; I cannot give an Alms, or receive the Sacrament, but I &s;in; nay, I cannot confe&s;s my Sins, but my very Confe&s;&s;ions are &s;till Aggravations of them; my Repentings need to be repented of, my Tears want wa&s;hing, and the very Wa&s;hing of my Tears needs &s;till to be wa&s;hed over again, with the Blood of my Redeemer.</Q></P>
<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Lord, is our whole Righteou&s;|ne&s;s. We are to go to him as poor Sinners;&mdash;beg Salvation of him, as his Free Gift, and intreat him to give us a Living Faith, whereby that Righteou&s;|ne&s;s may be applyed to our Hearts; and then that Faith, if true, will work by Love. But before this Faith, we cannot be &s;aid to have an actual Intere&s;t in the Benefits of Chri&s;t's Purcha&s;e. This the Author of the <HI>Whole Duty of Man,</HI> was wholly ignorant of, otherwi&s;e he would not have laid &s;uch a Foundati|on. And if the Foundation be &s;o bad, judge you then, how wretchedly weak the Super&s;tructure mu&s;t be. It would take up more Time than I can at pre&s;ent &s;pare, to point out all the Mi&s;takes of the whole Book. &mdash; I will only refer you to what this Author &s;ays about Recreations, <HI>Sunday 9th. Sect.</HI> 7. wherein he &s;eems not only to allow of Gaming, by &s;aying, <HI>If we play at any Game,</HI> but directs us when we do, <HI>to let the End of our Doing it, be meerly to recreate our &s;elves.</HI> &mdash; I thought the Glory of God, and not &s;elf-plea&s;ing, had been the Scope to which all Chri&s;tians ought to be directed. I &s;uppo&s;e, from this Pa&s;&s;age, a Man, whom I reproved lately on the Road, for Gaming in the Chri&s;tmas Holy Days, grounded his Authority for &s;o doing.&mdash;He told me, <HI>The whole Duty of Man</HI> &s;aid he might do &s;o.&mdash;And, indeed, I believe he is not the Fir&s;t, by Thou&s;ands, who has been mi&s;erably deceived by this much ap|plauded Book: And therefore, I thought my&s;elf
<PB N="8" REF="004643_0008_100ECA18650D32F0">
obliged to write this Letter; you may make what U&s;e you will of it. I care not if the Contents are publi&s;hed upon the Hou&s;e Top: Nay, I think it your Duty, if convinced your&s;elf, to endeavour to convince others: For there's no Hopes of bringing People to a right Knowledge of the Go&s;pel, till their favourite, tho' erroneous, Authors, are di&s;counte|nanced and laid a&s;ide. &mdash; Before I &s;ee <HI>England,</HI> I hope I &s;hall hear, that my Dear Friends in the Mi|ni&s;try, both in Preaching and Printing, have &s;e|conded my Te&s;timony.&mdash;Future Ages, as well as the pre&s;ent, will be much beholden to them for it. &mdash;Their Declarations will &s;tand as Records, that God did not leave him&s;elf without Witne&s;s, even in the wor&s;t of Times: Other Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters will be encouraged thereby, and Thou&s;ands, nay, Ten Thou&s;ands pre&s;erved from Infection, which otherwi&s;e perhaps, they may not be able to avoid: &mdash;However, whether they &s;econd me or not, by the Help of my God, both abroad and at home (if it be the divine Will I &s;hould &s;ee <HI>England</HI> again) I will per&s;evere in bearing a more explicite and par|ticular Te&s;timony, again&s;t the fal&s;e Writings of our admired Rabbies. Do you and my other Friends watch over me. Reprove me &s;harply, whenever you perceive my Spirit any way imbitter|ed.&mdash;Pray that I may be as meek as a Lamb, but as bold as a Lion; and then, whatever befalls me, for &s;peaking as I ought to &s;peak, thro' divine Grace, will be cheerfully &s;ubmitted to, by</P>
