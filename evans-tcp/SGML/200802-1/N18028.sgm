<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The author's account of his country, and their manners and cu&s;toms&mdash;Admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice&mdash;Embrenche&mdash;Mar|riage ceremony, and public entertain|ments&mdash;Mode of living&mdash;Dre&s;s&mdash;Ma|nufactures&mdash;Buildings&mdash;Commerce&mdash;Agriculture&mdash;War and religion&mdash;Su|per&s;tition of the natives&mdash;Funeral Sere|monies of the prie&s;ts or magicians&mdash;Cu|rious mode of di&s;covering poi&s;on&mdash;Some hints concerning the origin of the au|thor's countrymen, with the opinions of different writers on that &s;ubject.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Believe it is difficult for tho&s;e who publi&s;h their own memoirs to e&s;cape the imputation of vanity; nor is this the only di&s;advantage under which they labour: it is al&s;o their misfortune, that what is uncommon is rarely, if ever, believed, and what is obvious we are apt to turn from with di&s;gu&s;t, and to charge the writer with impertinence. People generally think tho&s;e memoirs only worthy to be read or remembered which abound in great or &s;triking e|vents;
<PB N="2" REF="023353_0009_0FBF2DF713CE34A8">
tho&s;e, in &s;hort, which in a high degree excite either admiration or pity: all others they con&s;ign to contempt and oblivion. It is therefore, I confe&s;s, not a little hazardous in a private and ob&s;cure individual, and a &s;tranger too, thus to &s;olicit the indulgent attention of the public; e&s;pecially when I own I offer here the hi&s;tory of neither a &s;aint, a hero, nor a tyrant. I believe there are a few events in my life, which have not happened to many: it is true the incidents of it are numerous; and, did I con&s;ider my&s;elf an European, I might &s;ay my &s;ufferings were great: but when I compare my lot with that of mo&s;t of my countrymen, I regard my&s;elf as a <HI>particular favourite of Heaven,</HI> and ac|knowledge the mercies of Providence in every occurrence of my life. If then the following narrative does not appear &s;ufficiently intere&s;ting to engage gene|ral attention, let my motive be &s;ome excu&s;e for its publication. I am not &s;o fooli&s;hly vain as to expect from it either immortality or literary reputati|on. If it affords any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">atisfaction to my numerous friends, at who&s;e reque&s;t it has been written, or in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree promotes the intere&s;ts of humani|ty, the ends for which it was under|taken
<PB N="3" REF="023353_0010_0FBF2DF84EBBBE68">
will be fully attained, and every wi&s;h of my heart gratified. Let it there|fore be remembered, that, in wi&s;hing to avoid cen&s;ure, I do not a&s;pire to prai&s;e.</P>
<P>That part of Africa, known by the name of Guinea, to which the trade for &s;laves is carried on, extends along the coa&s;t above 3400 miles, from Sene|gal to Angola, and includes a variety of kingdoms. Of the&s;e the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable is the kingdom of Benin, both as to extent and wealth, the richne&s;s and cultivation of the &s;oil, the power of its king, and the number and warlike di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants. It is &s;i|tuated nearly under the line, and ex|tends along the coa&s;t about 170 miles, but runs back into the interior part of Africa to a di&s;tance hitherto I believe unexplored by any traveller; and &s;eems only terminated at length by the empire of Aby&s;&s;ina, near 1500 miles from its beginning. This kingdom is divided into many provinces or di&s;tricts: in one of the mo&s;t remote and fertile of which, I was born, in the year 1745, &s;ituated in a charming fruitful vale, named E&s;&s;a|ka. The di&s;tance of this province from the capital of Benin and the &s;ea coa&s;t mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable: for I had
<PB N="4" REF="023353_0011_0FBF2DFF7890D9A8">
never heard of white men or Europe|ans, nor of the &s;ea; and our &s;ubjecti|on to the king of Benin was little more than nominal; for every tran&s;action of the government, as far as my &s;lender ob&s;ervation extended, was conducted by the chiefs or elders of the place. The manners and government of a peo|ple who have little commerce with o|ther countries are generally very &s;im|ple; and the hi&s;tory of what pa&s;&s;es in one family or village, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the whole nation. My father was one of tho&s;e elders or chiefs I have &s;poken of, and was &s;tyled Em|brenche; a term, as I remember, im|porting the highe&s;t di&s;tinction, and &s;ig|nifying in our language a <HI>mark</HI> of grandeur. This mark is conferred on the per&s;on entitled to it, by cutting the &s;kin acro&s;s at the top of the forehead, and drawing it down to the eye-brows: and while it is in this &s;ituation applying a warm hand, and rubbing it until it &s;hrinks up into a thick <HI>weal</HI> acro&s;s the lower part of the forehead. Mo&s;t of the judges and &s;enators were thus mark|ed; my father had long borne it: I had &s;een it conferred on one of my brothers, and I al&s;o was <HI>de&s;tined</HI> to receive it by my parents. Tho&s;e Embrenche or chief
<PB N="5" REF="023353_0012_0FBF2E00816E68C8">
men, decided di&s;putes and puni&s;hed crimes; for which purpo&s;e they always a&s;&s;embled together. The proceedings were generally &s;hort: and in mo&s;t ca&s;es the law of retalliation prevailed. I re|member a man was brought before my father, and the other judges, for kid|napping a boy; and, although he was the &s;on of a chief or &s;enator, he was condemned to make recompen&s;e by a man or woman &s;lave. Adultery, how|ever, was &s;ometimes puni&s;hed with &s;lavery or death; a puni&s;hment which I believe is inflicted on it throughout mo&s;t of the nations of Africa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Benezet's "Account of Guinea," througout!</NOTE>: &s;o &s;acred among them is the honour of the mar|riage bed, and &s;o jealous are they of the fidelity of their wives. Of this I recollect an in&s;tance&mdash;a woman was convicted before the judges of adultery, and delivered over, as the cu&s;tom was, to her hu&s;band to be puni&s;hed. Ac|cordingly he determined to put her to death: but it being found, ju&s;t before her execution, that &s;he had an infant at her brea&s;t; and no woman being pre|vailed on to perform the part of a nur&s;e, &s;he was &s;pared on account of the child.
<PB N="6" REF="023353_0013_0FBF2E04E0F44B68">
The men, however, do not pre&s;erve the &s;ame con&s;tancy to their wives, which they expect from them; for they indulge in a plurality, though &s;eldom in more than two. Their mode of marriage is thus:&mdash;both parties are u&s;ually betrothed when young by their parents, (though I have known the males to betroth them&s;elves). On this occa&s;ion a fea&s;t is prepared, and the bride and bridegroom &s;tand up in the mid&s;t of all their friends, who are a&s;|&s;embled for the purpo&s;e, while he de|clares &s;he is thenceforth to be looked upon as his wife, and that no other per|&s;on is pay any addre&s;&s;es to her. This is al&s;o immediately proclaimed in the vicinity, on which the bride retires from the a&s;&s;embly. Some time after &s;he is brought home to her hu&s;band, and then another fea&s;t is made, to which the relations of both parties are invited: her parents then deliver her to the bridegroom, accompanied with a num|ber of ble&s;&s;ings, and at the &s;ame time they tie round her wai&s;te a cotton &s;tring of the thickne&s;s of a goo&s;e-quill, which none but married women are permitted to wear: &s;he is now con&s;idered as com|pletely his wife; and at this time the dowry is given to the new married pair,
<PB N="7" REF="023353_0014_0FBF2E0684715C10">
which generally con&s;i&s;ts of portions of land, &s;laves, and cattle, hou&s;ehold goods, and implements of hu&s;bandry. The&s;e are offered by the friends of both parties; be&s;ides which the parents of the bridegroom pre&s;ent gifts to tho&s;e of the bride, who&s;e property &s;he is looked upon before marriage; but af|ter it &s;he is e&s;teemed the &s;ole property of her hu&s;band. The ceremony being now ended the fe&s;tival begins, which is celebrated with bone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ires, and loud ac|clamations of joy, accompanied with mu&s;ic and dancing.</P>
<P>WE are almo&s;t a nation of dancers, mu&s;icians and poets. Thus every great event, &s;uch as a triumphant return from battle, or other cau&s;e of public rejoicing is celebrated in public dances which are accompanied with &s;ongs and mu&s;ic &s;uited to the occa&s;ion. The a&s;|&s;embly is &s;eparated into four divi&s;ions, which dance either apart or in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, and each with a character pe|culiar to it&s;elf. The fir&s;t divi&s;ion contains the married men, who in their dances frequently exhibit feats of arms, and the repre&s;entation of a battle. To the&s;e &s;ucceed the married women, who dance in the &s;econd di|vi&s;ion. The young men occupy the
<PB N="8" REF="023353_0015_0FBF2E0A146C3DB0">
third: and the maidens the fourth. Each repre&s;ents &s;ome intere&s;ting &s;cene of real life, &s;uch as a great achieve|ment, dome&s;tic employment, a pathetic &s;tory, or &s;ome rural &s;port; and as the &s;ubject is generally founded on &s;ome recent event, it is therefore ever new. This gives our dances a &s;pirit and va|riety which I have &s;carcely &s;een el&s;e|where<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I was in Smyrna I have frequently &s;een the Greeks dance after this manner.</NOTE>. We have many mu&s;ical in|&s;truments, particularly drums of dif|ferent kinds, a piece of mu&s;ic which re&s;embles a guitar, and another much like a &s;tickado. The&s;e la&s;t are chiefly u&s;ed by betrothed virgins, who play on them on all grand fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>As our manners are &s;imple, our lux|uries are few. The dre&s;s of both &s;exes is nearly the &s;ame. It generally con&s;i&s;ts of a long piece of calico, or mu&s;lin, wrapped loo&s;ely round the body, &s;omewhat in the form of a highland plaid. This is u&s;ually dyed blue, which is our favorite colour. It is extracted from a berry, and is brighter and richer than any I have &s;een in Eu|rope. Be&s;ides this, our women of di&s;|tinction wear golden ornaments, which
<PB N="9" REF="023353_0016_0FBF2E0BCA6D1CF8">
they di&s;po&s;e with &s;ome profu&s;ion on their arms and legs. When our wo|men are not employed with the men in tillage, their u&s;ual occupation is &s;pinning and weaving cotton, which they afterwards dye, and make into garments. They al&s;o manufacture earthen ve&s;&s;els, of which we have many kinds. Among the re&s;t tobacco pipes, made after the &s;ame fa&s;hion, and u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, as tho&s;e in Turkey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The bowl is earthen, curiou&s;ly figured, to which a long reed is fixed as a tube. This tube is &s;ometimes &s;o long as to be borne by one, and fre|quently out of grandeur, two boys.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OUR manner of living is entirely plain; for as yet the natives are unac|quainted with tho&s;e refinements in cookery which debauch the ta&s;te: bul|locks, goats, and poultry, &s;upply the greate&s;t part of their food. The&s;e con&s;titute likewi&s;e the principal wealth of the country, and the chief articles of its commerce.

<P>As we live in a country where na|ture is prodigal of her favours, our wants are few and ea&s;ily &s;upplied; of cour&s;e we have few manufactures. They con&s;i&s;t for the mo&s;t part of calli|coes, earthen ware, ornaments, and in|&s;truments of war and hu&s;bandry. But the&s;e make no part of our commerce, the principle articles of which, as I have ob&s;erved, are provi&s;ions. In &s;uch a &s;tate, money is of little u&s;e; however we have &s;ome &s;mall pieces of coin, if I may call them &s;uch. They are made &s;omething like an anchor; but I do not remember either their value or deno|mination. We have al&s;o markets, at which I have been frequently with my mother.

They generally bring us fire-arms, gun powder, hats, beads, and dried fi&s;h. The lu&s;t we e&s;teemed a great rarity, as our waters were only brooks and &s;prings. The&s;e articles they barter with us for odiferous woods and earth, and our &s;alt of wood a&s;hes. They

always carry &s;laves through our land, but the &s;tricte&s;t account is exacted of their manner of procuring them before they are &s;uffered to pa&s;s. Sometimes indeed we &s;old &s;laves to them, but they were only pri&s;oners of war, or &s;uch a|mong us as had been convicted of kid|napping, or adultery, and &s;ome other crimes, which we e&s;teemed heinous. This practice of kidnapping induces me to think, that, notwith&s;tanding all our &s;trictne&s;s, their principal bu&s;ine&s;s a|mong us was to trepan our people. I remember too they carried great &s;acks along with them, which not long after I had an opportunity of fatally &s;eeing applied to that infamous purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>OUR land is uncommonly rich and fruitful, and produces all kinds of vege|tables in great abundance. We have plenty of Indian corn, and va&s;t quanti|ties of cotton and tobacco. Our pine|apples grow without culture; they are about the &s;ize of the large&s;t &s;ugar-loaf, and finely flavoured. We have al&s;o &s;pices of different kinds, particularly pepper; and a variety of delicious fruits which I have never &s;een in Europe; together with gums of various kinds, and honey in abundance. All our indu&s;try is exert|ed to improve the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings of nature.

Agriculture is our chief employment; and every one, even the children and women, are engaged in it. Thus we are all habituated to labour from our earli|e&s;t years. Every one contributes &s;ome|thing to the common &s;tock; and as we are unacquainted with idlene&s;s, we have no beggars. The benefits of &s;uch a mode of living are obvious. The We&s;t India planters prefer the &s;laves of Benin or Eboe, to tho&s;e of any other part of Gui|nea, for their hardine&s;s, intelligence, integrity, and zeal. Tho&s;e benefits are felt by us in the general healthine&s;s of the people, and in their vigour and ac|tivity; I might have added too in their comeline&s;s. Deformity is indeed un|known among&s;t us, I mean that of &s;hape. Numbers of the natives of Eboe now in London, might be brought in &s;upport of this a&s;&s;ertion: for, in regard to com|plexion, ideas of beauty are wholly re|lative. I remember while in Africa to have &s;een three negro children who were tawny, and another quite white, who were univer&s;ally regarded by my|&s;elf, and the natives in general, as far as related to their complexions, as deform|ed Our women too were in my eye, at lea&s;t uncommonly graceful, alert, and mode&s;t to a degree of ba&s;hfulne&s;s; not do

<P>OUR tillage is exerci&s;ed in a large plain or common, &s;ome hours walk from our dwellings, and all the neigh|bours re&s;ort thither in a body. They u&s;e no bea&s;ts of hu&s;bandry; and their only in&s;truments are hoes, axes, &s;hovels, and beaks, or pointed iron to dig with. Sometimes we are vi&s;ited by locu&s;ts, which come in large clouds, &s;o as to darken the air, and de&s;troy our harve&s;t. This however happens rarely, but when it does, a famine is produced, by it. I remember an in&s;tance or two wherein this happened. This common is often the theatre of war; and therefore when our people go out to till their land, they not only go in a body, but generally take their arms with them for fear of a &s;urpri&s;e; and when they apprehend an inva&s;ion, they guard the avenues to their dwellings, by driving &s;ticks into the ground, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;harp at one end as to pierce the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and are generally dipt in poi&s;on.

they appear to have been irruptions of one little &s;tate or di&s;trict on the other, to obtain pri&s;oners or booty. Perhaps they were incited to this by tho&s;e traders who brought the Euro|pean goods I mentioned among&s;t us. Soch a mode of obtaining &s;laves in Africa is common; and I belive more are procured this way, and by kid|napping, than any other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Benezet's Account of Africa throughout</NOTE>. When a trader wants &s;laves, he applies to a chief for them, and tempts him with his wares. It is not extraordinary, if on this occa&s;ion he yields to the tempt|ation with as little firmne&s;s, and accepts the price of his fellow creatures liberty with as little reluctance as the enlight|ened merchant. Accordingly he falls on his neighbours, and a de&s;perate battle en&s;ues. If he prevails and takes pri&s;oners, he gratifies his avarice by &s;elling them; but, if his party be vanqui&s;hed, and he falls into the hands of the enemy, he is put to death; for, as he has been known to foment their quarrels, it is thought dangerous to let him &s;urvive, and no ran&s;om can &s;ave him, though all other pri&s;oners may be redeemed We have fire|arms,
<PB N="18" REF="023353_0025_0FBF2E26CB59F1E0">
bows and arrows, broad two|edged &s;words and javelins: we have &s;hields al&s;o which cover a man from head to foot. All are taught the u&s;e of the&s;e weapons; even our women are warriors, and march boldly out to fight along with the men. Our whole di&s;|trict is a kind of militia: on a certain &s;ignal given, &s;uch as the firing of a gun at night, they all ri&s;e in arms and ru&s;h upon their enemy. It is perhaps &s;ome|thing remarkable, that when our people march to the field a red flag or banner is borne before them. I was once a witne&s;s to a battle in our common. We had been all at work in it one day as u&s;ual, when our people were &s;ud|denly attacked.

There were many women as well as men on both &s;ides; among o|thers my mother was there, and arm|ed with a broad &s;word. After fight|ing for a con&s;iderable time with great fury, and many had been killed, our people obtained the victory, and took their enemy's Chief pri&s;oner. He was carried off in great triumph, and, though he offered a large ran&s;om for his life, he was put to death. A virgin of note a|mong our enemies had been &s;lain in the
<PB N="19" REF="023353_0026_0FBF2E2A53D9C980">
battle, and her arm was expo&s;ed in our market-place, where our trophies were always exhibited. The &s;poils were divided according to the merit of the warriors. Tho&s;e pri&s;oners which were not &s;old or redeeemed we kept as &s;laves: but how different was their condition from that of the &s;laves in the We&s;t In|dies! With us they do no more work than other members of the communi|ty, even their ma&s;ter; their food, clo|thing and lodging were nearly the &s;ame as theirs, (except that they were not permitted to eat with tho&s;e who were free-born;) and there was &s;carce any other difference between them, than a &s;uperior degree of importance which the head of a family po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in our &s;tate, and that authority which, as &s;uch, he exerci&s;es over every part of his hou&s;ehold.

or captivity; but, as for the doctrine of eternity I do not remember to have ever heard of it: &s;ome however be|lieve in the tran&s;migration of &s;ouls in a certain degree. Tho&s;e &s;pirits, which are not tran&s;migrated, &s;uch as their dear friends or relations, they belive al|ways attend them, and guard them from the bad &s;pirits or their foes. For this rea&s;on they always before eating, as I have ob&s;erved, put &s;ome &s;mall portion of the meat, and pour &s;ome of their drink, on the ground for them; and they often make oblations of the blood of bea&s;ts or fowls at their graves. I was very fond of my mother, and al|mo&s;t con&s;tantly with her. When &s;he went to make the&s;e oblations at her mother's tomb, which was a kind of &s;mall &s;olitary thatched hou&s;e, I &s;ome|times attended her.

<P>WE compute the year from the day on which the &s;un cro&s;&s;es the line, and on its &s;etting that evening, there is a general &s;hout throughout the land; at lea&s;t I can &s;peak from my own know|ledge, throughout our vicinity. The people at the &s;ame time make a great noi&s;e with rattles, not unlike the ba&s;ket rattles u&s;ed by children here, though much larger, and hold up their hands to heaven for a ble&s;&s;ing. It is then the greate&s;t offerings are made; and tho&s;e children whom our wi&s;e men foretel will be fortunate are then pre&s;ented to different people. I remember many u&s;ed to come to &s;ee me, and I was car|ried about to others for that purpo&s;e. They have many offerings, particular|ly at full moons; generally two at harve&s;t before the fruits are taken out of the ground: and when any young ani|mals are killed, &s;ometimes they offer up part of them as a &s;acrifice. The&s;e offerings, when made by one of the heads of a family, &s;erve for the whole. I remember we often had them at my father's and my uncle's, and their fa|milies have been pre&s;ent. Some of our offerings are eaten with bitter

herbs. We had a &s;aying among us to any one of a cro&s;s temper, <Q>That if they were to be eaten, they &s;hould be eaten with bitter herbs.</Q></P>
<P>WE practi&s;ed circumci&s;ion like the Jews, and made offerings, and fea&s;ts on that occa&s;ion in the &s;ame manner as they did. Like them al&s;o, our children were named from &s;ome event, &s;ome circum&s;tance, or fancied forebod|ing at the time of their birth. I was named <HI>Olaudah,</HI> which in our language &s;ignifies vici&s;&s;itude, or fortunate al&s;o; one favoured, and having a loud voice and well &s;poken. I remember we never polluted the name of the object of our adoration; on the contrary, it was always mentioned with the greate&s;t re|verence; and we were totally unac|quainted with &s;wearing, and all tho&s;e terms of abu&s;e and reproach which find their way &s;o readily and copiou&s;ly into the language of more civilized people. The only expre&s;&s;ions of that kind I remember were, <Q>May you rot, or may you &s;well, or may a bea&s;t take you.</Q></P>
<P>I have before remarked that the natives of this part of Africa are ex|tremely cleanly. This nece&s;&s;ary habit of decency was with us a part of reli|gion,
<PB N="23" REF="023353_0030_0FBF2E3369592CB0">
and therefore we had many puri|fications and wa&s;hings; indeed almo&s;t as many, and u&s;ed on the &s;ame occa|&s;ions, if my recollection does not fail me, as the Jews.

<P>THOUGH we had no places of public wor&s;hip, we had prie&s;ts and magicians, or wi&s;e men. I do not remember whether they had different offices, or whether they were united in the &s;ame per&s;ons, but they were held in great re|verence by the people. They calcula|ted our time, and foretold events, as their name imported, for we called them Ah-affoe-way-cah, which &s;ignifies cal|culators or yearly men, our year being called Ah-affoe. They wore their their beards, and when they died they

<P>THESE magicians were al&s;o our doc|tors or phy&s;icians. They practi&s;ed bleed|ing by cupping; and were very &s;ucce&s;s|ful in healing wounds and expelling poi&s;ons.

I HAVE already acquainted the read|er with the time and place of my birth. My father, be&s;ides many &s;laves, had a numerous family; of which &s;even lived to grow up, including my&s;elf and a &s;i&s;ter, who was the only daughter. As I was the younge&s;t of the &s;ons, I be|came, of cour&s;e, the greate&s;t favourite with my mother, and was always with her; and &s;he u&s;ed to take particular pains to form my mind. I was trained up from my earlie&s;t years in the art of war: my daily exerci&s;e was &s;hooting and throwing javelins; and my mother adorned me with emblems, after the manner of our greate&s;t warriors. In this way I grew up till I was turned the age of eleven, when an end was put to my happine&s;s in the following manner:&mdash;Generally when the grown people in the neighbourhood were gone far in the fields to labour, the children a&s;&s;embled together in &s;ome of the neighbour's premi&s;es to play; and commonly &s;ome of us u&s;ed to get up a tree to look out for any a&s;&s;ailant, or kidnapper, that might come upon us; for they &s;ome|times took tho&s;e opportunities of our parents ab&s;ence to attack and carry off as many as they could &s;eize. One day as I was watching at the top of a tree
<PB N="34" REF="023353_0041_0FBF2E4D5A02E3C8">
in our yard, I &s;aw one of tho&s;e people come into the yard of our next neigh|bour but one, to kidnap, there being many &s;tout young people in it. Imme|diately on this I gave the alarm of the rogue, and he was &s;urrounded by the &s;toute&s;t of them, who entangled him with cords, &s;o that he could not e&s;cape till &s;ome of the grown people came and &s;ecured him. But, alas! ere long it was my fate to be thus attacked, and to be carried off, when none of the grown people were nigh. One day, when all our people were gone out to their works as u&s;ual, and only I and my dear &s;i&s;ter were left to mind the hou&s;e, two men and a woman got over our walls, and in a moment &s;eized us both, and, without giving us time to cry out, or make re&s;i&s;tance, they &s;top|ped our mouths, and ran off with us, into the neare&s;t wood. Here they tied our hands, and continued to carry us as far as they could, till night came on, when we reached a &s;mall hou&s;e, where the robbers halted for refre&s;hment and &s;pent the night. We were then unbound, but were unable to take any food; and, being quite overpowed by fatigue and grief, our only relief was &s;ome &s;leep, which allayed our
<PB N="35" REF="023353_0042_0FBF2E51B2BC8E50">
misfortune for a &s;hort time. The next morning we left the hou&s;e, and con|tinued travelling all the day. For a long time we had kept the woods, but at la&s;t we came into a road which I believed I knew. I had now &s;ome hopes of being delivered; for we had advanced but a little way before I di&s;|covered &s;ome people at a di&s;tance, on which I began to cry out for their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; but my cries had no other effect than to make them tie me fa&s;ter and &s;top my mouth, and then they put me into a large &s;ack. They al&s;o &s;topped my &s;i&s;ter's mouth, and tied her hands; and in this manner we proceeded till we were out of the &s;ight of the&s;e people. When we went to re&s;t the following night they offered us &s;ome victuals; but we refu&s;ed it; and the only comfort we had was in being in one another's arms all that night, and bathing each other with our tears. But alas! we were &s;oon de|prived of even the &s;mall comfort of weeping together. The next day proved a day of greater &s;orrow than I had yet experienced; for my &s;i&s;ter and I were then &s;eparated, while we lay cla&s;ped in each others arms. It was in vain that we be&s;ought them not to

part us; &s;he was torn from me, and immediately carried away, while I was left in a &s;tate of di&s;traction not to be de&s;cribed. I cried and grieved con|tinually; and for &s;everal days did not eat any thing but what they forced into my mouth. At length, after many days travelling, during which I had often changed ma&s;ters, I got into the hands of a chieftain, in a very plea&s;ant country. This man had two wives and &s;ome chil|dren, and they all u&s;ed me extremely well, and did all they could to com|fort me; particularly the fir&s;t wife, who was &s;omething like my mother. Although I was a great many days journey from my father's hou&s;e, yet the&s;e people &s;poke exactly the &s;ame language with us. This fir&s;t ma&s;ter of mine, as I may call him, was a &s;mith, and my principle employment was working his bellows, which were the &s;ame kind as I had &s;een in my vicinity. They were in &s;ome re&s;pects not unlike the &s;toves here in gentlemen's kitchens and were covered over with leather; and in the middle of that leather a &s;tick was fixed, and a per&s;on &s;tood up, and worked it, in the &s;ame manner as is done to pump water out of a ca&s;k with a hand pump. I believe it was gold he

worked, for it was of a lovely bright yellow colour, and was worn by the women on their wri&s;ts and ancles. I was there I &s;uppo&s;e about a month, and they at la&s;t u&s;ed to tru&s;t me &s;ome little di&s;tance from the hou&s;e. This liberty I u&s;ed in embracing every op|portunity to inquire the way to my own home: and I al&s;o &s;ometimes, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, went with the maidens, in the cool of the evenings, to bring pitchers of water from the &s;prings for the u&s;e of the hou&s;e. I had al&s;o re|marked where the &s;unro&s;e in the morn|ing, and &s;et in the evening, as I had travelled along; and I had ob&s;erved that my father's hou&s;e was towards the ri&s;ing of the &s;un. I therefore deter|mined to &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of making my e&s;cape, and to &s;hape my cour&s;e for that quarter; for I was quite oppre&s;&s;ed and weighed down by grief after my mother and friends; and my love of liberty, ever great, was &s;trengthened by the mortifying cir|cum&s;tance of not daring to eat with the free-born children, although I was mo&s;tly their companion. While I was projecting my e&s;cape, one day an un|lucky event happened, which quite di&s;concerted my plan, and put an end
<PB N="38" REF="023353_0045_0FBF2E5EA605DB30">
to my hopes. I u&s;ed to be &s;ometimes employed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting an elderly woman &s;lave, to cook and take care of the poultry: and one morning, while I was feeding &s;ome chickens, I happened to to&s;s a &s;mall pebble at one of them, which hit it on the middle, and direct|ly killed it. The old &s;lave, having &s;oon after mi&s;&s;ed the chicken, inquired after it; and on my relating the acci|dent (for I told her the truth, becau&s;e my mother would never &s;uffer me to tell a lie) &s;he flew into a violent pa&s;|&s;ion, threatened that I &s;hould &s;uffer for it; and, my ma&s;ter being out, &s;he im|mediately went and told her mi&s;tre&s;s what I had done. This alarmed me very much, and I expected an in&s;tant flogging, which to me was uncom|monly dreadful; for I had &s;eldom been beaten at home. I therefore re&s;olved to fly; and accordingly I ran into a thicket that was hard by, and hid my|&s;elf in the bu&s;hes. Soon afterwards my mi&s;tre&s;s and the &s;lave returned, and, not &s;eeing me, they &s;earched all the hou&s;e, but not finding me, and I not making an&s;wer when they called to me, they thought I had run away, and the whole neighbourhood was rai&s;ed in the pur&s;uit of me. In that part of the coun|try
<PB N="39" REF="023353_0046_0FBF2E600ECEBDB0">
(as in ours) the hou&s;es and villages were &s;kirted with woods, or &s;hrubbe|ries, and the bu&s;hes were &s;o thick that a man could readily conceal him&s;elf in them, &s;o as to elude the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch. The neighbours continued the whole day looking for me, and &s;everal times many of them came within a few yards of the place where I lay hid. I ex|pected every moment, when I heard a ru&s;tling among the trees, to be found out, and puni&s;hed by my ma&s;ter: but they never di&s;covered me, though they were often &s;o near that I even heard their conjectures as they were looking about for me; and I now learned from them, that any attempt to return home would be hopele&s;s. Mo&s;t of them &s;uppo&s;ed I had fled towards home: but the di&s;tance was &s;o great, and the way &s;o intricate, that they thought I could never reach it, and that I &s;hould be lo&s;t in the woods. When I heard this I was &s;eized with a violent panic, and abandoned my&s;elf to de&s;pair. Night too began to approach, and ag|gravated all my fears. I bad before entertained hopes of getting home, and had determined when it &s;hould be dark to make the attempt; but I was now convinced it was fruitle&s;s,
<PB N="40" REF="023353_0047_0FBF2E620FDE39B0">
and began to con&s;ider that, if po&s;&s;ibly I could e&s;cape all other animals, I could not tho&s;e of the human kind; and that, not knowing the way, I mu&s;t peri&s;h in the woods. Thus was I like the hunted deer:
<Q><L>&mdash;Ev'ry leaf and ev'ry whi&s;p'ring breath</L>
<L>Convey'd a foe, and ev'ry foe a death.</L></Q></P>
<P>I heard frequent ru&s;tlings among the leaves; and being pretty &s;ure they were &s;nakes, I expected every in&s;tant to be &s;tung by them. This increa&s;ed my angui&s;h, and the horror of my &s;ituation became now quite in&s;upportable I at length quitted the thicker, very faint and hungry, for I had not eaten or drank any thing all the day, and crept to my ma&s;ter's kitchen, from whence I &s;et out at fir&s;t, which was an open &s;hed, and laid my&s;elf down in the a&s;hes with an anxious wi&s;h for death to relieve me from all my pains. I was &s;carcely awake in the morning, when the old woman &s;lave, who was the fir&s;t up, came to light the fire, and &s;aw me in the fire place. She was very much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me, and could &s;carcely believe her own eyes. She now promi&s;ed to intercede for me, and went for her ma&s;ter, who &s;oon after
<PB N="41" REF="023353_0048_0FBF2E68EB308C90">
came, and, having &s;lightly reprimanded me, ordered me to be taken cure of, and not ill treated.</P>
<P>SOON after this my ma&s;ter's only daughter, and child by his fir&s;t wife, &s;ickened and died, which affected him &s;o much that for &s;ome time he was almo&s;t frantic, and really would have killed him&s;elf, had he not been watch|ed and prevented. However, in a &s;mall time afterwards he recovered, and I was again fold. I was now carried to the left of the &s;un's ri&s;ing, through many dreary wa&s;tes and di&s;mal woods, amid&s;t the hideous roarings of wild bea&s;ts. The people I was &s;old to u&s;ed to carry me very often, when I was tired, either on their &s;houlders or on their backs. I &s;aw many convenient well built &s;heds along the road, at proper di&s;tances, to accom|modate the merchants and travellers, who lay in tho&s;e buildings along with their wives, who often accompany them; and they always go well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rmed.</P>
<P>FROM the time I left my own nation I always found &s;omebody that under|&s;tood me till I came to the &s;ea coa&s;t. The languages of different nations did not totally differ, nor where they &s;o co|pious as tho&s;e of the Europeans, par|ticularly

In this manner I had been travelling for a con&s;iderable time, when one evening to my great &s;ur|pri&s;e, whom &s;hould I &s;ee brought to the hou&s;e where I was but my dear &s;i&s;ter!</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me &s;he gave a loud &s;hriek, and ran into my arms&mdash;I was quite over powered: neither of us could &s;peak; but, for a con&s;iderable time, clung to each other in mutual embraces, unable to do any thing but weep.

When the&s;e people knew we were brother and &s;i&s;ter, they indulged us to be together; and the man, to whom I &s;uppo&s;ed we belonged, lay with us, he in the middle, while &s;he and I held one another by the hands acro&s;s his brea&s;t all night; and thus for a while we forgot our misfortunes in the joy of being together: but even this &s;mall

This filled me with a&s;toni&s;hment; and I could &s;carce help expre&s;&s;ing my &s;ur|pri&s;e that the young gentleman &s;hould &s;uffer me, who was bound, to eat with him who was free, and not only &s;o, but that he would not at any time either eat or drink till I had taken fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e I was the elde&s;t, which was a|greeable to our cu&s;tom. Indeed every thing here, and all their treatment of me, made me forget that I was a &s;lave. The language of the&s;e people re&s;embled ours &s;o nearly, that we under&s;tood each other perfectly. They had al&s;o the
<PB N="46" REF="023353_0053_0FBF4A9DC68B8D68">
very &s;ame cu&s;toms as we. There were likewi&s;e &s;laves daily to attend us, while my young ma&s;ter and I with other boys &s;ported with our darts and bows and arrows, as I had been u&s;ed to do at home. In this re&s;emblance to my for|mer happy &s;tate, I pa&s;&s;ed about two months; and I now began to think I was to be adopted into the family, and was beginning to be reconciled to my &s;ituation, and to forget by degrees my misfortunes, when all at once the de|lu&s;ion vani&s;hed; for, without the lea&s;t previous knowledge, one morning ear|ly, while my dear ma&s;ter and compa|nion was &s;till a&s;leep, I was awakened out of my reverie to fre&s;h &s;orrow, and hurried away even among&s;t the uncir|cumci&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus, at the very moment I dreamed of the greate&s;t happine&s;s, I found my|&s;elf mo&s;t mi&s;erable; and it &s;eemed as if fortune wi&s;hed to give me this ta&s;te of joy only to render the rever&s;e more poignant. The change I now expe|rienced was as painful as it was &s;udden and unexpected. It was a change in|deed from a &s;tate of bli&s;s to a &s;cene which is inexpre&s;&s;ible by me, as it di&s;|covered to me an element I had never before beheld, and till then had no idea
<PB N="47" REF="023353_0054_0FBF4AA45E435C38">
of, and wherein &s;uch in&s;tances of hard|&s;hip and cruelty continually occurred as I can never reflect on but with hor|ror.</P>
<P>All the nations and people I had hi|therto pa&s;&s;ed through re&s;embled our own in their manners, cu&s;toms, and language: but I came at length to a country, the inhabitants of which dif|fered from us in all tho&s;e particulars. I was very much &s;truck with this differ|ence, e&s;pecially when I came among a people who did not circumci&s;e, and eat without wa&s;hing their hands. They cooked al&s;o in iron pots, and had Eu|ropean cutla&s;&s;es and cro&s;s bows, which were unknown to us, and fought with their fi&s;ts among them&s;elves. Their women were not &s;o mode&s;t as ours, for they eat, and drank, and &s;tept, with their men. But above all, I was amaz|ed to &s;ee no &s;acrifices or offerings a|mong them. In &s;ome of tho&s;e places the people ornamented them&s;elves with &s;cars, and likewi&s;e filed their teeth ve|ry &s;harp. They wanted &s;ometimes to ornament me in the &s;ame manner, but I would not &s;uffer them; hoping that I might &s;ome time be among a people who did not thus disfigure them&s;elves, as I thought they did. At la&s;t I came
<PB N="48" REF="023353_0055_0FBF4AA5452D8408">
to the banks of a large river which was covered with canoes, in which the people appeared to live with their hou&s;ehold uten&s;ils and provi&s;ions of all kinds, I was beyond mea&s;ure a&s;toni&s;h|ed at this, as I had never before &s;een any water larger than a pond or a rivu|let: and my &s;urpri&s;e was mingled with no &s;mall fear when I was put into one of the&s;e canoes, and we began to pad|dle and move along the river. We continued going on thus till night; and when we came to land, and made fires on the banks, each family by them&s;elves &s;ome dragged their canoes on &s;hore, o|thers &s;tayed and cooked in theirs, and laid in them all night. Tho&s;e on the land had mats, of which they made tents, &s;ome in the &s;hape of little hou|&s;es: in the&s;e we &s;lept: and after the morning meal, we embarked again and proceeded as before. I was often very much a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee &s;ome of the wo|men, as well as the men, jump into the water, dive to the bottom, come up a|gain, and &s;wim about Thus I con|tinued to travel, &s;ometimes by land, &s;ometimes by water, through different countries and various nations, till, at the end of &s;ix or &s;even months after I had been kidnapped, I arrived at the
<PB N="49" REF="023353_0056_0FBF4AA6C1652D80">
&s;ea coa&s;t. It would be tedious and unintere&s;ting to relate all the incidents which befell me during this journey, and which I have not yet forgotten; of the various hands I pa&s;&s;ed through, and the manners and cu&s;toms of all the dif|ferent people among whom I lived: I &s;hall therefore only ob&s;erve, that in all the places where I was, the &s;oil was exceedingly rich; the pompkins eadas, plantains, yams, &amp;c. &amp;c. were in great abundance, and of incredible &s;ize. There were al&s;o va&s;t quantities of dif|ferent gums, though not u&s;ed for any purpo&s;e; and every where a great deal of tobacco. The cotton even grew quite wild; and there was plenty of red-wood. I &s;aw no mechanics what|ever in all the way, except &s;uch as I have mentioned. The chief employ|ment in all the&s;e countries was agri|culture, and both the males and females as with us, were brought up to it, and trained in the arts of war.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t object which &s;aluted my eyes when I arrived on the coa&s;t was the &s;ea, and a &s;lave &s;hip, which was then riding at anchor, and waiting for its cargo. The&s;e filled me with a&s;to|ni&s;hment, which was &s;oon converted into terror when I was carried on
<PB N="50" REF="023353_0057_0FBF4AA839A5B0C0">
board. I was immediately handled, and to&s;&s;ed up to &s;ee if I were found, by &s;ome of the crew; and I was now per|&s;uaded that I had gotten into a world of bad &s;pirits, and that they were going to kill me. Their complexions too differing &s;o much from ours, their long hair, and the language they &s;poke (which was very different from any I had ever heard) united to confirm me in this belief. Indeed &s;uch were the horrors of my views and fears at the moment, that, if ten thou&s;and worlds had been my own, I would have freely parted with them all to have exchanged my condition with that of the meane&s;t &s;lave in my own country. When I look|ed round the &s;hip too and &s;aw a large furnace or copper-boiling, and a mul|titude of black people of every de&s;crip|tion chained together, every one of their countenances expre&s;&s;ing dejection and &s;orrow, I no longer doubted of my fate; and, quite overpowered with horror and angui&s;h, I fell motionle&s;s on the deck and fainted. When I recovered a little I found &s;ome black people about me, who I believed were &s;ome of tho&s;e who had brought me on board, and had been receiving their pay; they talked to me in order to
<PB N="51" REF="023353_0058_0FBF4AAE277C5E30">
cheer me, but all in vain. I a&s;ked them if we were not to be eaten by tho&s;e white men with horrible looks, red faces, and long hair. They told me I was not: and one of the crew brought me a &s;mall portion of &s;pirituous liquor in a wine gla&s;s; but being afraid of him, I would not take it out of his hand. One of the blacks therefore took it from him and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ve it to me, and I took a lit|tle down my palate, which, in&s;tead of reviving me, as they thought it would, threw me into the greate&s;t con&s;ternati|on at the &s;trange feeling it produced, having never ta&s;ted any &s;uch liquor before. Soon after this the blacks who brought me on board went off, and left me abandoned to de&s;pair I now &s;aw my&s;elf deprived of all chance of return|ing to my native country, or even the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of hope of gaining the &s;hore, which I now con&s;idered as friendly; and I even wi&s;hed for my former &s;lavery in preference to my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, which was filled with horrors of every kind, &s;till heightened by my ignorance of what I was to un|dergo. I was not long &s;uffered to in|dulge my grief; I was &s;oon put down under the decks, and there I received &s;uch a &s;alutation in my no&s;trils as I had
<PB N="52" REF="023353_0059_0FBF4AB074339DF0">
never experienced in my life: &s;o that with the loath&s;omne&s;s of the &s;tench, and crying together, I became &s;o &s;ick and low that I was not able to eat, nor had I the lea&s;t de&s;ire to ta&s;te any thing. I now wi&s;hed for the la&s;t friend, death, to relieve me; but &s;oon, to my grief, two of the white men offered me eat|ables; and, on my refu&s;ing to eat, one of them held me fa&s;t by the hands, and laid me acro&s;s, I think the windla&s;s, and tied my feet, while the other flog|ged me &s;everely. I had never experi|enced any thing of this kind before: and although not being u&s;ed to the wa|ter, I naturally feared that element the fir&s;t time I &s;aw it, yet neverthele&s;s, could I have got over the nettings, I would have jumped over the &s;ide, but I could not; and, be&s;ides, the crew u&s;ed to watch us very clo&s;ely who were not chained down to the decks, le&s;t we &s;hould leap into the water: and I have &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e poor African pri|&s;oners mo&s;t &s;everely cut for attempting to do &s;o, and hourly whipped for not eating. This indeed was often the ca&s;e with my&s;elf. In a little time after, among&s;t the poor chained men, I found &s;ome of my own nation, which in a &s;mall degree gave ea&s;e to my mind. I
<PB N="53" REF="023353_0060_0FBF4AB740C62A78">
inquired of the&s;e what was to be done with us? they gave me to under&s;tand we were to be carried to the&s;e white people's country to work for them. I then was a little revived, and thought, if it were no wor&s;e than working, my &s;ituation was not &s;o de&s;perate: but &s;till I feared I &s;hould be put to death, the white people looked and acted, as I thought, in &s;o &s;avage a manner; for I had never &s;een among any people &s;uch in&s;tances of brutal cruelty; and this not only &s;hewn towards us blacks, but al&s;o to &s;ome of the whites them|&s;elves. One white man in particular I &s;aw, when we were permitted to be on deck, flogged &s;o unmercifully with a large rope near the forema&s;t, that he died in con&s;equence of it; and they to&s;&s;ed him over the &s;ide as they would have done a brute. This made me fear the&s;e people the more; and I ex|pected nothing le&s;s than to be treated in the &s;ame manner. I could not help expre&s;&s;ing my fears and apprehen&s;ions to &s;ome of my countrymen: I a&s;ked them if the&s;e people had no country, but lived in this hollow place (the &s;hip)? they told me they did not, but came from a di&s;tant one, "Then,' &s;aid I, <Q>how comes it in all our country was
<PB N="54" REF="023353_0061_0FBF4AB9EE4BB710">
never heard of them!</Q> They told me becau&s;e they lived &s;o very far off. I then a&s;ked where were their women? had they any like them&s;elves? I was told they had: "And why," &s;aid I, <Q>do we not &s;ee them?</Q> they an&s;wered, be|cau&s;e they were left behind. I a&s;ked how the ve&s;&s;el could go? they told me they could not tell; but that there were cloth put upon the ma&s;ts by the help of the ropes I &s;aw, and then the ve&s;&s;el went on; and the white men had &s;ome &s;pell or magic they put in the water when they liked in order to &s;top the ve&s;&s;el, I was exceedingly amazed at this account, and really thought they were &s;pirits. I therefore wi&s;hed much to be from among&s;t them, for I ex|pected they would &s;acrifice me: but my wi&s;hes were vain; for we were &s;o quartered that it was impo&s;&s;ible for any of us to make our e&s;cape. While we &s;tayed on the coa&s;t I was mo&s;tly on deck; and one day, to my great a&s;to|ni&s;hment, I &s;aw one of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els coming in with the &s;ails up. As &s;oon as the whites &s;aw it, they gave a great &s;hout, at which we were amazed; and the more &s;o as the ve&s;&s;el appeared larger by approaching nearer. At la&s;t &s;he came to an anchor in my &s;ight,
<PB N="55" REF="023353_0062_0FBF4ABAF728DD68">
and when the anchor was let go I and my countrymen who &s;aw it were lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment to ob&s;erve the ve&s;&s;el &s;top; and were now convinced it was done by magic. Soon after this the other &s;hip got her boats out, and they came on board of us, and the people of both &s;hips &s;eemed very glad to &s;ee each other. Several of the &s;trangers al&s;o &s;hook hands with us black people, and made motions with their hands, &s;ignifying I &s;uppo&s;e, we were to go to their country; but we did not under&s;tand them. At la&s;t, when the &s;hip we were in, had got in all her cargo, they made ready with many fearful noi&s;es, and we were all put under deck, &s;o that we could not &s;ee how they managed the ve&s;&s;el. But this di&s;appointment was the lea&s;t of my &s;orrow. The &s;tench of the hold while we were on the coa&s;t was &s;o in|tolerably loath&s;ome, that it was dan|gerous to remain there for any time, and &s;ome of us had been permitted to &s;tay on the deck for the fre&s;h air; but now that the whole &s;hip's cargo were confined together, it became ab&s;olutely pe&s;tilential. The clo&s;ene&s;s of the place, and the heat of the climate, added to the number in the &s;hip, which was &s;o
<PB N="56" REF="023353_0063_0FBF4ABC75D05A18">
crowded that each had &s;carcely roo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to turn him&s;elf, almo&s;t &s;uffocated us. This produced copious per&s;pirations, &s;o that the air &s;oon became unfit for re&s;piration, from a variety of loath|&s;ome &s;mells, and brought on a &s;ickne&s;s among the &s;laves, of which many died, thus falling victims to the improvident avarice, as I may call it, of their pur|cha&s;ers. This wretched &s;ituation was again aggravated by the galling of the chains, now become in&s;upportable; and the filth of the nece&s;&s;ary tubs, into which the children often fell, and were almo&s;t &s;uffocated. The &s;hrieks of the women, and the groans of the dying, rendered the whole a &s;cene of horror almo&s;t inconceivable. Happily perhaps for my&s;elf I was &s;oon reduced &s;o low here that it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to keep me almo&s;t always on deck; and from my extreme youth I was not put in fetters. In this &s;ituation I expected every hour to &s;hare the fate of my companions, &s;ome of whom were al|mo&s;t daily brought upon deck at the point of death, which I began to hope would &s;oon put an end to my mi&s;eries. Often did I think many of the inhabi|tants of the deep much more happy than my&s;elf, I envied them the freedom
<PB N="57" REF="023353_0064_0FBF4ABEC2FCC158">
they enjoyed, and as often wi&s;hed I could change my condition for theirs. Every circum&s;tance I met with &s;erved only to render my &s;tate more painful, and heigtened my apprehen&s;ions, and my opinion of the cruelty of the whites. One day they had taken a number of fi&s;hes; and when they had killed and &s;atisfied them&s;elves with as many as they thought fit, to our a&s;toni&s;hment who were on the deck, rather than give any of them to us to eat, as we expected, they to&s;&s;ed the remaining fi&s;h into the &s;ea again, although we begged and prayed for &s;ome as well as we could, but in vain; and &s;ome of my countrymen, being pre&s;&s;ed by hun|ger, took an opportunity, when they thought no one &s;aw them, of trying to get a little privately; but they were di&s;|covered, and the attempt procured them &s;ome very &s;evere floggings. One day, when we had a &s;mooth &s;ea and mode|rate wind, two of my wearied country|men who were chained together (I was near them at the time), preferring death to &s;uch a life of mi&s;ery, &s;omehow made through the nettings and jumped into the &s;ea: immediately another quite de|jected fellow, who on account of his illne&s;s, was &s;uffered to be out of irons,
<PB N="58" REF="023353_0065_0FBF4AC298E16280">
al&s;o followed their example; and I be|lieve many more would very &s;oon have done the &s;ame if they had not been prevented by the &s;hip's crew who were in&s;tantly alarmed. Tho&s;e of us that were the mo&s;t active were in a moment put down under the deck, and there was &s;uch a noi&s;e and confu&s;ion among&s;t the people of the &s;hip as I never heard before, to &s;top her, and get the boat out to go after the &s;laves. However two of the wretches were drowned, but they got the other, and afterwards flogged him unmercifully for thus at|tempting to prefer death to &s;lavery. In this manner we continued to undergo more hard&s;hips than I can now relate, hard&s;hips which are in&s;eperable from this accur&s;ed trade. Many a time we were near &s;uffocation from the want of fre&s;h air, which we were often without for whole days together. This and the &s;tench of the nece&s;&s;ary tubs, carried off many. During our pa&s;&s;age I fir&s;t &s;aw flying fi&s;hes, which &s;urpri&s;ed me very much: they u&s;ed frequently to fly acro&s;s the &s;hip, and many of them fell on the deck. I al&s;o now fir&s;t &s;aw the u&s;e of the quadrant; I had of|ten with a&s;toni&s;hment &s;een the mariners, make ob&s;ervations with it, and I could
<PB N="59" REF="023353_0066_0FBF4AC4B9D7B570">
not think what it meant. They at la&s;t took notice of my &s;urpri&s;e: and one of them, willing to increa&s;e it, as well as to gratify my curio&s;ity, made me one day look through it. The clouds appeared to me to be land, which di&s;|appeared as they pa&s;&s;ed along. This heightened my wonder; and I was now more per&s;uaded than ever that I was in another world, and that every thing about me was magic. At la&s;t we came in &s;ight of the i&s;land of Barba|does, at which the whites on board gave a great &s;hout, and made many &s;igns of joy to us. We did not know what to think of this; but as the ve&s;|&s;el drew nearer we plainly &s;aw the har|bour, and other &s;hips of different kinds and &s;izes; and we &s;oon anchored among&s;t them off Bridge-Town. Ma|ny merchants and planters now came on board, though it was in the even|ing. They put us in &s;eparate parcels, and examined us attentively. They al|&s;o made us jump, and pointed to the land, &s;ignifying we were to go there. We thought by this we &s;hould be eaten by the&s;e ugly men, as they appeared to us; and, when &s;oon after we were all put down under the deck again, there was much dread and trembling
<PB N="60" REF="023353_0067_0FBF4AC645681C08">
among us, and nothing but bitter cries to be heard all the night from the&s;e ap|prehen&s;ions, in&s;omuch that at la&s;t the white people got &s;ome old &s;laves from the land to pacify us. They told us we were not to be eaten, but to work, and were &s;oon to go on land, where we &s;hould &s;ee many of our country people. This report ea&s;ed us much, and &s;ure enough, &s;oon after we were landed, there came to us Africans of all languages. We were conducted immediately to the merchant's yard, where we were all pent up together like &s;o many &s;heep in a fold, without regard to &s;ex or age. As every object was new to me, every thing I &s;aw fil|led me with &s;urpri&s;e. What &s;truck me fir&s;t was that the hou&s;es were built with bricks and &s;tories, and in every other re&s;pect different from tho&s;e I had &s;een in Africa: but I was &s;till more a&s;toni&s;h|ed on &s;eeing people on hor&s;eback. I did not know what this could mean; and indeed I thought the&s;e people were full of nothing but magical arts. While I was in this a&s;toni&s;hment one of my fellow pri&s;oners &s;poke to a countryman of his about the hor&s;es, who &s;aid they were the &s;ame kind they had in their country. I under&s;tood them, though
<PB N="61" REF="023353_0068_0FBF4ACE37B79C60">
they were from a di&s;tant part of Africa, and I thought it odd I had not &s;een any hor&s;es there; but afterwards when I came to conver&s;e with different Afri|cans, I found they had many hor&s;es among&s;t them, and much larger than tho&s;e I then &s;aw. We were not many days in the merchant's cu&s;tody before we were &s;old after their u&s;ual manner, which is this:&mdash;On a &s;ignal given, (as the beat of a drum) the buyers ru&s;h at once into the yard where the &s;laves are confined, and make choice of that parcel they like be&s;t, The noi&s;e and clamour with which this is attended, and the eagerne&s;s vi&s;ible in the coun|tenances of the buyers, &s;erve not a little to increa&s;e the apprehen&s;ion of terri|fied Africans, who may well be &s;up|po&s;ed to con&s;ider them as the mini&s;ters of that de&s;truction to which they think them&s;elves devoted. In this manner, without &s;cruple, are relations and friends &s;eparated, mo&s;t of them never to &s;ee each other again. I remember in the ve&s;&s;el in which I was brought o|ver, in the men's apartment, there were &s;everal brothers, who, in the &s;ale were &s;old in different lots; and it was very moving on this occa&s;ion to &s;ee and hear their cries at parting. O, ye no|minal
<PB N="62" REF="023353_0069_0FBF4ACFF692E2E0">
Chri&s;tians! might not an African a&s;k you, learned you this from your God, who &s;ays unto you, Do unto all men as you would men &s;hould do unto you? Is it not enough that we are torn from our country and friends, to toil for your luxury and lu&s;t of gain? Mu&s;t every tender feeling be likewi&s;e &s;acrificed to your avarice? Are the deare&s;t friends and relations, now ren|dered more dear by their &s;eparation from their kindred, &s;till to be parted from each other, and thus prevented from cheering the gloom of &s;lavery with the &s;mall comfort of being toge|ther and mingling their &s;ufferings and &s;orrows? Why are parents to lo&s;e their children, brothers their &s;i&s;ters, or hu&s;|bands their wives?

<PB N="64" REF="023353_0071_0FBF4AD4F236ACE0">
from Africa, and we had plenty of rice and fat pork. We were landed up a river a good way from the &s;ea, about Virginia county, where we &s;aw few or none of our native Africans, and not one &s;oul who could talk to me. I was a few weeks weeding gra&s;s, and gather|ing &s;tones in a plantaion; and at la&s;t all my companions were di&s;tributed dif|ferent ways, and only my&s;elf was left. I was now exceedingly mi&s;erable, and thought my&s;elf wor&s;e off than any of the re&s;t of my companions; for they could talk to each other, but I had no per&s;on to &s;peak to that I could under|&s;tand. In this &s;tate I was con&s;tantly grieving and pining, and wi&s;hing for death rather than any thing el&s;e. While I was in this plantation the gentleman, to whom I &s;uppo&s;e the e&s;tate belonged, being unwell, I was one day &s;ent for to his dwelling hou&s;e to fan him; when I came into the room where he was I was very much affrighted at &s;ome things I &s;aw, and the more &s;o as I had &s;een a black woman &s;lave as I came through the hou&s;e, who was cooking the dinner, and the poor creature was cruelly loaded with various kinds of iron machines; &s;he had one particu|larly on her head, which locked her
<PB N="65" REF="023353_0072_0FBF4ADC785FCB10">
mouth &s;o fa&s;t that &s;he could &s;carcely &s;peak; and could not eat nor drink. I was much a&s;toni&s;hed and &s;hocked at this contrivance, which I afterwards learned was called the iron muzzle. Soon after I had a fan put into my hand, to fan the gentleman while he &s;lept; and &s;o I did indeed with great fear. While he was fa&s;t a&s;leep I indulged my|&s;elf a great deal in looking about the room, which to me appeared very fine and curious. The fir&s;t object that en|gaged my attention was a watch which hung on the chimney, and was going. I was quite &s;urpri&s;ed at the noi&s;e it made, and was afraid it would tell the gentleman any thing I might do ami&s;s: and when I immediately after ob&s;erved a picture hanging in the room, which appeared con&s;tantly to look at me, I was &s;till more affrighted, having never &s;een &s;uch things as the&s;e before. At one time I thought it was &s;omething relative to magic; and not &s;eeing it move I thought it might be &s;ome way the whites had to keep their great men when they died, and offer them liba|tions as we u&s;ed to do our friendly &s;pi|rits. In this &s;tate of anxiety I remained till my ma&s;ter awoke, when I was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed out of the room, to my no &s;mall
<PB N="66" REF="023353_0073_0FBF4ADD8C83ACA0">
&s;atisfaction and relief; for I thought that the&s;e people were all made up of wonders. In this place I was called Jacob; but on board the African &s;now I was called Michael. I had been &s;ome time in this mi&s;erable, forlorn, and much dejected &s;tate, without hav|ing any one to talk to, which made my life a burden, when the kind and un|known hand of the Creator (who in e|very deed leads the blind in a way they know not) now began to appear, to my comfort; for one day the captain of a merchant &s;hip, called the Indu&s;trious Bee came on &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e. This gentleman, who&s;e name was Michael Henry Pa&s;cal, was a lieutenant in the royal navy, but now commanded this trading &s;hip, which was &s;ome|where in the confines of the county many miles off. While he was at my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e it happened that he &s;aw me, and liked me &s;o well that he made a purcha&s;e of me. I think I have often heard him &s;ay he give thirty or forty pounds &s;terling for me; but I do not remember which. However, he meant me for a pre&s;ent to &s;ome of his friends in England: and as I was &s;ent accordingly from the hou&s;e of my then ma&s;ter, (one Mr. Campbell) to the
<PB N="67" REF="023353_0074_0FBF4ADF4E485770">
place where the &s;hip lay: I was con|ducted on hor&s;eback by an elderly black man, (a mode of travelling which appeared very odd to me). When I arrived I was carried on board a fine large &s;hip, loaded with tobacco, &amp;c. and ju&s;t ready to &s;ail for England. I now thought my condition much mended; I had &s;ails to lie on, and plenty of good victuals to eat; and every body on board u&s;ed my very kindly, quite contrary to what I had &s;een of any white people before; I therefore began to think that they were not all of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition. A few days after I was on board we &s;ailed for England. I was &s;till at a lo&s;s to conjecture my de&s;tiny. By this time, however, I could &s;matter a little imper|fect Engli&s;h; and I wanted to know as well as I could where we were going. Some of the people of the &s;hip u&s;ed to tell me they were going to carry me back to my own country, and this made me very happy. I was quite rejoiced at the idea of going back; and thought if I could get home what wonders I &s;hould have to tell. But I was re&s;erved for another fate, and was &s;oon unde|ceived when we came within &s;ight of the Engli&s;h coa&s;t. While I was on
<PB N="68" REF="023353_0075_0FBF4AE459708AF0">
board this &s;hip, my captain and ma&s;ter named me <HI>Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a.</HI> I at that time began to under&s;tand him a little, and refu&s;ed to be called &s;o, and told him as well as I could that I would be called Jacob; but he &s;aid I &s;hould not, and &s;till called me Gu&s;tavus: and when I refu&s;ed to an&s;wer to my new name, which at fir&s;t I did, it gained me many a cuff; &s;o at length I &s;ubmitted, and by which I have been known ever &s;ince. The &s;hip had a very long pa&s;|&s;age; and on that account we had ve|ry &s;hort allowance of provi&s;ions. To|wards the la&s;t we had only one pound and a half of bread per week, and about the &s;ame quantity of meat, and one quart of water a-day. We &s;poke with only one ve&s;&s;el the whole time we were at &s;ea, and but once we caught a few fi&s;hes. In our extremities the captain and people told me in je&s;t they would kill and eat me; but I thought them in earne&s;t, and was depre&s;&s;ed beyond mea&s;ure, expecting every moment to be my la&s;t. While I was in this &s;itu|ation one evening they caught, with a good deal of trouble, a large &s;hark, and got it on board. This glad|dened my poor heart exceedingly, as I thought it would &s;erve the people to
<PB N="69" REF="023353_0076_0FBF4AE68CD14000">
eat in&s;tead of their eating me; but very &s;oon, to my a&s;toni&s;hment, they cut off a &s;mall part of the tail, and to&s;&s;ed the re&s;t over the &s;ide. This re|newed my con&s;ternation; and I did not know what to think of the&s;e white peo|ple, though I very much feared they would kill and eat me. There was on board the &s;hip a young lad who had never been at &s;ea before, about four or five years older than my&s;elf: his name was Richard Baker. He was a native of America, had received an ex|cellent education, and was of a mo&s;t amiable temper. Soon after I went on board he &s;hewed me a great deal of par|tiality and attention, and in return I grew extremely fond of him. We at length became in&s;eparable; and, for the &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce of two years, he was of very great u&s;e to me, and was my con&s;tant companion and in&s;tructor. Although this dear youth had many &s;laves of his own, yet he and I have gone through many &s;ufferings together on &s;hipboard; and we have many nights lain in each other's bo&s;oms when we were in great di&s;tre&s;s. Thus &s;uch a friend&s;hip was cemented between us as we cheri&s;hed till his death, which, to my very great &s;orrow, happened in the year 1759,
<PB N="70" REF="023353_0077_0FBF4AE9AC7D7B08">
when he was up the Archipelago, on board his maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Pre&s;ton: an event which I have never cea&s;ed to re|gret, as I lo&s;t at once a kind interpreter, an agreeable companion, and a faithful friend; who, at the age of fifteen, di&s;|covered a mind &s;uperior to prejudice; and who was not a&s;hamed to notice, to a&s;&s;ociate with, and to be the friend and in&s;tructor of one who was ignorant, a &s;tranger, of a different complexion, and a &s;lave! My ma&s;ter had lodged in his mother's hou&s;e in America: he re&s;pect|ed him very much, and made him al|ways eat with him in the cabin. He u&s;ed often to tell him jocularly that he would kill and eat me. Sometimes he would &s;ay to me&mdash;the black people were not good to eat, and would a&s;k me if we did not eat people in my coun|try. I &s;aid, no: then he &s;aid he would kill Dick (as he always called him) fir&s;t, and afterwards me. Though this hearing relieved my mind a little as to my&s;elf, I was alarmed for Dick, and whenever he was called I u&s;ed to be very much afraid he was to be killed; and I would peep and watch to &s;ee if they were going to kill him: nor was I free from this con&s;ternation till we made the land. One night we lo&s;t a
<PB N="71" REF="023353_0078_0FBF4AEB03C462D0">
man overboard; and the cries and noi&s;e were &s;o great and confu&s;ed, in &s;topping the &s;hip, that I, who did not know what was the matter, began, as u&s;ual, to be very much afraid, and to think they were going to make an of|fering with me, and perform &s;ome magic; which I &s;till believed they dealt in. As the waves were very high I thought the Ruler of the &s;eas was an|gry, and I expected to be offered up to appea&s;e him. This filled my mind with agony, and I could not any more that night clo&s;e my eyes again to re&s;t. However, when daylight appeared I was a little ea&s;ed in my mind: but &s;till every time I was called I u&s;ed to think it was to be killed. Some time after this we &s;aw &s;ome very large fi&s;h, which I afterwards found were called grampu&s;&s;es. They looked to me ex|tremely terrible, and made their ap|pearance ju&s;t at du&s;k; and were &s;o near as to blow the water on the &s;hip's deck. I believed them to be the rulers of the &s;ea; and as the white people did not make any offerings at any time, I thought they were angry with them: and, at la&s;t, what confirm|ed my belief was, the wind ju&s;t then died away, and a calm en&s;ued, and in
<PB N="72" REF="023353_0079_0FBF4AED7829D2A8">
con&s;equence of it the &s;hip &s;topped go|ing. I &s;uppo&s;ed that the fi&s;h had per|formed this, and I hid my&s;elf in the fore part of the &s;hip, through fear of being offered up to appea&s;e them, eve|ry minute peeping and quaking: but my good friend Dick came &s;hortly tow|ards me, and I took an opportunity to a&s;k him, as well as I could, what the&s;e fi&s;h were. Not being able to talk much Engli&s;h, I could but ju&s;t make him under&s;tand my que&s;tion; and not at all, when I a&s;ked him if any offer|ings were to be made to them, how|ever, he told me the&s;e fi&s;h would &s;wallow any body; which &s;ufficiently alarmed me. Here he was called away by the captain, who was leaning over the quarter-deck railing and looking at the fi&s;h; and mo&s;t of the people were bu&s;ied in getting a barrel of pitch to light for them to play with. The captain now called me to him, having learned &s;ome of my apprehen&s;ions from D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ck; and having diverted him&s;elf and others for &s;ome time with my fears, which appeared ludicrous enough in my crying and trembling, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me. The barrel of pitch was now lighted and put over the &s;ide into the water: by this time it was ju&s;t dark,
<PB N="73" REF="023353_0080_0FBF4AF26184A488">
and the fi&s;h went after it; and, to my great joy, I &s;aw them no more.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, all my alarms began to &s;ub&s;ide when we got &s;ight of land; and at la&s;t the &s;hip arrived at Falmouth, af|ter a pa&s;&s;age of thirteen weeks. Every heart on board &s;eemed gladdened on our reaching the &s;hore, and none more than mine. The captain immediately went on &s;hore, and &s;ent on board &s;ome fre&s;h provisions, which we wanted very much: we made good u&s;e of them, and our famine was &s;oon turned into fea&s;t|ing, almo&s;t without ending. It was about the beginning of the &s;pring 1757, when I arrived in England, and I was near twelve years of age at that time. I was very much &s;truck with the buildings and the pavement of the &s;treets in Falmouth; and, indeed, every object I &s;aw filled me with new &s;ur|pri&s;e. One morning, when I got upon deck, I &s;aw it covered all over with the &s;now that fell over-night: as I had never &s;een any thing of the kind before, I thought it was &s;alt; &s;o I immediately ran down to the mate and de&s;ired him, as well as I could, to come and &s;ee how &s;omebody in the night had thrown &s;alt all over the deck. He, knowing what it was, de&s;ired me to bring &s;ome
<PB N="74" REF="023353_0081_0FBF4AF4B2D6D8C8">
of it down to him: accordingly I took up a handful of it, which I found very cold indeed; and when I brought it to him he de&s;ired me to ta&s;te it. I did &s;o, and I was &s;urpri&s;ed beyond mea|&s;ure. I then a&s;ked him what it was; he told me it was &s;now: but I could not in anywi&s;e under&s;tand him. He a&s;ked me if we had no &s;uch thing in my country; and I told him, No. I then a&s;ked him the u&s;e of it, and who made it; he told me a great man in the heavens, called God: but here again I was to all intents and purpo&s;es at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand him; and the more &s;o, when a little after I &s;aw the air filled with it, in a heavy &s;hower, which fell down on the &s;ame day. After this I went to church; and having never been at &s;uch a place before, I was again amazed at &s;eeing and hearing the &s;ervice. I a&s;ked all I could about it; and they gave me to under&s;tand it was wor&s;hipping God, who made us and all things. I was &s;till at a great lo&s;s, and &s;oon got into an endle&s;s field of inquiries, as well as I was able to &s;peak and a&s;k about things. However, my little friend Dick u&s;ed to be my be&s;t interpreter; for I could make free with him, and he always in|&s;tructed
<PB N="75" REF="023353_0082_0FBF4AF6FA4CB2A8">
me with plea&s;ure: and from what I could under&s;tand by him of this God, and in &s;eeing the&s;e white people did not &s;ell one another as we did, I was much plea&s;ed; and in this I thought they were much happier than we Afri|cans. I was a&s;toni&s;hed at the wi&s;dom of the white people in all things I &s;aw; but was amazed at their not &s;acrificing, or making any offerings, and eating with unwa&s;hed hands, and touching the dead. I likewi&s;e could not help re|marking the particular &s;lenderne&s;s of their women, which I did not at fir&s;t like; and I thought they were not &s;o mode&s;t and &s;hame-faced as the African women.</P>
<P>I had often &s;een my ma&s;ter and Dick employed in reading; and I had a great curio&s;ity to talk to the books, as I thought they did; and &s;o to learn how all things had a beginning: for that purpo&s;e I have often taken up a book, and have talked to it, and then put my ears to it, when alone, in hopes it would an&s;wer me; and I have been very much concerned when I found it remained &s;ilent.</P>
<P>MY ma&s;ter lodged at the hou&s;e of a gentleman in Falmouth, who had a fine little daughter about &s;ix or &s;even years
<PB N="76" REF="023353_0083_0FBF4AF944935B30">
of age, and &s;he grew prodigiou&s;ly fond of me; in&s;omuch that we u&s;ed to eat together, and had &s;ervants to wait on us. I was &s;o much care&s;&s;ed by this family that it often reminded me of the treatment I had received from my little noble African ma&s;ter. After I had been here a few days, I was &s;ent on board of the &s;hip; but the child cried &s;o much after me that nothing could pacify her till I was &s;ent for again. It is ludicrous enough, that I began to fear I &s;hould be betrothed to this young lady; and when my ma&s;ter a&s;ked me if I would &s;tay there with her behind him, as he was going away with the &s;hip, which had taken in the tobacco again, I cried immediately, and &s;aid I would not leave him. At la&s;t, by &s;tealth, one night I was &s;ent on board the &s;hip again; and in a little time we &s;ailed for Guern&s;ey, where &s;he was in part owned by a merchant, one Nicholas Doberry. As I was now among&s;t a people who had not their faces &s;carred, like &s;ome of the African nations where I had been, I was very glad I did not let them ornament me in that manner when I was with them. When we arrived at Guern&s;ey, my ma&s;ter placed me to board and lodge
<PB N="77" REF="023353_0084_0FBF4AFBAAFF4748">
with one of his mates, who had a wife and family there; and &s;ome months after|wards he went to England, and left me in care of this mate, together with my friend Dick: This mate had a little daughter, aged about five or &s;ix years, with whom I u&s;ed to be much de|lighted. I had often ob&s;erved that when her mother wa&s;hed her face it looked very ro&s;y; but when &s;he wa&s;hed mine it did not look &s;o: I therefore tried oftentimes my&s;elf if I could not by wa&s;hing make my face of the &s;ame co|lour as my little play-mate (Mary,) but it was all in vain; and I now began to be mortified at the difference in our com|plexions. This woman behaved to me with great kindne&s;s and attention; and taught me every thing in the &s;ame manner as &s;he did her own child, and indeed in every re&s;pect treated me as &s;uch. I remained here till the &s;um|mer of the year 1757; when my ma&s;ter, being appointed fir&s;t lieu|tenant of his maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Roe|buck, &s;ent for Dick and me, and his old mate: on this we all left Guern&s;ey, and &s;et out for England in a &s;loop bound for London. As we were coming up towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, where the Roebuck lay, a man of war's
<PB N="78" REF="023353_0085_0FBF4AFFC80F27F8">
boat came along&s;ide to pre&s;s our peo|ple; on which each man ran to hide him&s;elf. I was very much frightened at this, though I did not know what it meant, or what to think or do. How|ever I went and hid my&s;elf al&s;o under a hencoop. Immediately afterwards the pre&s;s-gang came on board with their &s;words drawn, and &s;earched all about, pulled the people out by force, and put them into the boat. At la&s;t I was found out al&s;o; the man that found me held me up by the heels while they all made their &s;port of me, I roaring and crying out all the time mo&s;t lu&s;tily; but at la&s;t the mate, who was my conductor, &s;eeing this, came to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and did all he could to pacify me; but all to very little purpo&s;e, till I had &s;een the boat go off. Soon afterwards we came to the Nore, where the Roebuck lay; and, to our great joy, my ma&s;ter came on board to us, and brought us to the &s;hip. When I went on board this large &s;hip, I was amazed indeed to &s;ee the quantity of men and the guns However my &s;urpri&s;e began to dimini&s;h as my knowledge increa&s;ed; and I cea&s;ed to feel tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions and alarms which had taken &s;uch &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of me when I fir&s;t came
<PB N="79" REF="023353_0086_0FBF4B05D19FE6E0">
among the Europeans, and for &s;ome time after. I began now to pa&s;s to an op|po&s;ite extreme; I was &s;o far from being afraid of any thing new which I &s;aw, that after I had been &s;ome time in this &s;hip, I even began to long for an engagement My griefs too, which in young minds are not perpetual, were now wearing away; and I &s;oon enjoyed my&s;elf pretty well, and felt tolerably ea&s;y in any pre|&s;ent &s;ituation. There was a number of boys on board, which &s;till made it more agreeable; for we were always together, and a great part of our time was &s;pent in play. I remained in this &s;hip a con&s;iderable time, during which we made &s;everal crui&s;es, and vi&s;ited a variety of places: among others we were twice in Holland, and brought over &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction from it, who&s;e names I do not now remem|ber. On the pa&s;&s;age, one day, for the diver&s;ion of tho&s;e gentlemen, all the boys were called on the quarter deck, and were paired proportionably, and then made to fight; after which the gentlemen gave the combatants from five to nine &s;hillings each. This was the fir&s;t time I ever fought with a white boy; and I never knew what it was to have a bloody no&s;e before. This made
<PB N="80" REF="023353_0087_0FBF4B06F677D900">
me fight mo&s;t de&s;parately; I &s;uppo&s;e con&s;iderably more than an hour: and at la&s;t, both of us being weary, we were parted. I had a great deal of this kind of &s;port afterwards, in which the captain and the &s;hip's company u&s;ed very much to encourage me. Some|time afterwards the &s;hip went to Leith in Scotland, and from thence to the Orkneyes, where I was &s;urpri&s;ed in &s;ee|ing &s;carcely any night: and from thence we &s;ailed with a great fleet, full of &s;oldiers, for England. All this time we had never come to an engagement, though we were frequently crui&s;ing off the coa&s;t of France: during which we cha&s;ed many ve&s;&s;els, and took in all &s;eventeen prizes. I had been learning many of the manoeuvres of the &s;hip during our crui&s;e; and I was &s;everal times made to fire the guns. One even|ing, off Havre de Grace, ju&s;t as it was growing dark, we were &s;tanding off &s;hore, and met with a fine large French built frigate. We got all things im|mediately ready for fighting; and I now expected I &s;hould be gratified in &s;eeing an engagement, which I had &s;o long wi&s;hed for in vain. But the very moment the word of command was given to fire, we heard tho&s;e on board
<PB N="81" REF="023353_0088_0FBF4B0889857060">
the other &s;hip cry, "Haul down the jib;" and in that in&s;tant &s;he hoi&s;ted Engli&s;h colours. There was in&s;tantly with us an amazing cry of&mdash;"Ava&s;t!" or &s;top firing; and I think one or two guns had been let off, but happily they did no mi&s;chief. We had hailed them &s;everal times; but they not hearing, we received no an&s;wer, which was the cau&s;e of our firing. The boat was then &s;ent on board of her, and &s;he proved to be the Ambu&s;cade man of war, to my no &s;mall di&s;appointment. We returned to Port&s;mouth, without having been in any action, ju&s;t at the trial of Admiral Byng (whom I &s;aw &s;everal times during it): and my ma&s;ter having left the &s;hip, and gone to Lon|don for promotion, Dick and I were put on board the &s;avage &s;loop of war, and we went in her to a&s;&s;i&s;t in bringing off the St. George man of war, that had run a-&s;hore &s;omewhere on the coa&s;t. After &s;taying a few weeks on board the Savage, Dick and I were &s;ent on &s;hore at Deal, where we remained &s;ome &s;hort time, till my ma&s;ter &s;ent for us to London, the place I had long de&s;ired exceedingly to &s;ee. We there|fore both with great plea&s;ure got into a waggon, and came to London, where
<PB N="82" REF="023353_0089_0FBF4B0AA247CD78">
we were received by a Mr. Guerin, a relation of my ma&s;ter. This gentle|man had two &s;i&s;ters, very amiable la|dies, who took much notice and great care of me. Though I had de&s;ired &s;o much to &s;ee London, when I arrived in it I was unfortunately unable to gratify my curio&s;ity; for I had at this time the chilblains to &s;uch a degree that I could not &s;tand for &s;everal months, and I was obliged to be &s;ent to St. George's Ho&s;pital. There I grew &s;o ill that the doctors wanted to cut my left leg off at different times, apprehend|ing a mortification; but I always &s;aid I would rather die than &s;uffer it; and happily (I thank God) I recoverd without the operation. After being there &s;everal weeks, and ju&s;t as I had recovered, the &s;mall pox broke out on me, &s;o that I was again confined; and I thought my&s;elf now particularly unfortunate. However I &s;oon reco|vered again; and by this time my ma&s;ter having been promoted to be fir&s;t lieutenant of the Pre&s;ton man of war of fifty guns, then new at Deptford, Dick and I were &s;ent on board her, and &s;oon after we went to Holland to bring over the late Duke of&mdash;to England. While I was in the &s;hip
<PB N="83" REF="023353_0090_0FBF4B0CCE24F4D8">
an incident happened, which, though trifling, I beg leave to relate, as I could not help taking particular notice of it, and con&s;idered it then as a judgment of God. One morning a young man was looking up to the fore-top, and in a wicked tone, common on &s;hipboard, d&mdash;d his eyes about &s;omething. Ju&s;t at the moment &s;ome &s;mall particles of dirt fell into his left eye, and by the evening it was very much enflamed. The next day it grew wor&s;e; and within &s;ix or &s;even days he lo&s;t it. From this &s;hip my ma&s;ter was appointed a lieutenant on board the Royal George. When he was going he wi&s;hed me to &s;tay on board the Pre&s;ton, to learn the French horn; but the &s;hip being or|dered for Turkey I could not think of leaving my ma&s;ter, to whom I was very warmly attached; and I told him if he left me behind it would break my heart. This prevailed on him to take me with him; but he left Dick on board the Pre&s;ton, whom I embraced at parting for the la&s;t time. The Royal George was the large&s;t &s;hip I had ever &s;een; &s;o that when I came on board of her I was &s;urpri&s;ed at the number of people, men, women, and children, of every denomination; and the largene&s;s
<PB N="84" REF="023353_0091_0FBF4B1318B516A8">
of the guns, many of them al&s;o of bra&s;s which I had never &s;een before. Here were al&s;o &s;hops or &s;talls of every kind of goods, and people-crying their dif|ferent commodities about the &s;hip as in a town. To me it appeared a little world, into which I was again ca&s;t with out a friend, for I had no longer my dear companion Dick. We did not &s;tay long here. My ma&s;ter was not many weeks on board before he got an appointment to the &s;ixth lieutenant of the Namur, which was then at Spit-heat, fitting up for Vice-admiral Bo&s;ca|wen, who was going with a large fleet on an expedition again&s;t Loui&s;burgh. The crew of the Royal George were turned over to her, and the flag of that gallant admiral was hoi&s;ted on board, the blue at the maintop gallant ma&s;t head. There was a very great fleet of men of war of every de&s;crip|tion a&s;&s;embled together for this expe|dition, and I was in hopes &s;oon to have an opportunity of being gratified with a &s;ea-fight. All things being now in readine&s;s, this mighty fleet (for there was al&s;o Admiral Corni&s;h's fleet in com|pany, de&s;tined for the Ea&s;t Indies) at la&s;t weighed anchor, and &s;ailed. The two fleets continued in company for
<PB N="85" REF="023353_0092_0FBF4B1503DC01B0">
&s;everal days, and then parted; Admiral Corni&s;h, in the Lenox, having fir&s;t &s;a|luted our Admiral in the Namur, which he returned. We then &s;teered for America; but, by contrary winds, we were driven to Teneriffe, where I was &s;truck with its noted peak. Its prodi|gious height, and its form, re&s;embling a &s;ugar loaf, filled we with wonder. We remained in &s;ight of this i&s;land &s;ome days, and then proceeded for America, which me &s;oon made, and got into a very commodious harbour called St. George, in Halifax, where we had fi&s;h in great plenty, and all other fre&s;h provi&s;ions. We were here joined by different men of war and tran&s;port &s;hips with &s;oldiers; after which, our fleet being increa&s;ed to a prodigious number of &s;hips of all kinds, we &s;ailed for Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. We had the good and gallant General Wolfe on board our &s;hip, who&s;e affability made him highly e&s;teemed and beloved by all the men. He often honoured me, as well as other boys, with marks of his notice; and &s;aved me once a flogging for fighting with a young gentleman. We arrived at Cape Breton in the &s;ummer of 1758: and here the &s;oldiers were to be landed,
<PB N="86" REF="023353_0093_0FBF4B1688C6FE78">
in order to make an attact upon Loui&s;|bourgh. My ma&s;ter had &s;ome part in &s;uperintending the Landing; and here I was in a &s;mall mea&s;ure gratified in &s;ee|ing an encounter between our men and the enemy. The French were po&s;ted on the &s;hore to receive us, and di&s;puted our landing for a long time: but at la&s;t they were driven from their trenches, and a complete landing was effected. Our troops pur&s;ued them as far as the town of Loui&s;hburgh. In this action many were killed on both &s;ides. One thing remarkable I &s;aw this day.&mdash;A lieute|nant of the Prince&s;s Amelia, who as well as my ma&s;ter &s;uperintended the landing, was giving the word of command, and while his mouth was open a mu&s;quet ball went through it, and pa&s;&s;ed out at his cheek. I had that day in my hand the &s;calp of an indian king, who was killed in the engagement. the &s;calp had been taken off by an Highlander. I &s;aw the king's ornaments too, which were very curious, and made of fea|thers.</P>
<P>OUR land forces laid &s;iege to the town of Loui&s;burgh, while the French men of war were blocked up in the harbonr by the fleet, the batteries at the &s;ame time playing upon them from the land.
<PB N="87" REF="023353_0094_0FBF4B196D0014A0">
This they did with &s;uch effect, that one day I &s;aw &s;ome of the &s;hips &s;et on fire by the &s;hells from the batteries, and I believe two or three of them were quite burnt. At another time, about fifty boats belonging to the Engli&s;h men of war, commanded by Captain George Belfour of the Aetna fire &s;hip, and Mr. Laforey another junior captain, attack|ed and boarded the only two remaining French men of war in the harbour. They al&s;o &s;et fire to a &s;eventy-gun &s;hip, but a &s;ixty four, called the Bienfai&s;ant, they brought off. During my &s;tay here I had often an opportunity of being near cap|tain Belfour, who was plea&s;ed to notice me, and liked me &s;o much that he often a&s;ked my ma&s;ter to let him have me, but he would not part with me; and no con&s;ideration could have induced me to leave him. At la&s;t Loi&s;burgh was taken, and the Eng|li&s;h men of war came into the harbour before it, to my very great joy; for I had now more liberty of indulging my|&s;elf, and I went often on &s;hore. When the &s;hips were in the harbour we had the mo&s;t beautiful proce&s;&s;ion on the water I ever &s;aw. All the admirals and captains of the men of war, full dre&s;&s;ed, and in their barges, well ornamented
<PB N="88" REF="023353_0095_0FBF4B20E471F0D8">
with pendants, came along&s;ide of the Namur. The vice-admiral then went on &s;hore in his barge, followed by the other officers in order of &s;eniority, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as I &s;uppo&s;e, of the town and fort. Some time after this the French governor and his lady, and other per&s;ons of note, came on board our &s;hip to dine. On this occa&s;ion our &s;hips were dre&s;&s;ed with colours of all kinds, from the topgallant-ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> head to the deck; and this, with the firing of guns, formed a mo&s;t grand and magnificent &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as every thing here was &s;et|tled, Admiral Bo&s;cawen &s;ailed with part of the fleet for England, leaving &s;ome &s;hips behind with Rear-Admirals Sir Charles Hardy and Durell. It was now winter; and one evening, during our pa&s;&s;age home, about du&s;k, when we were in the channel, or near &s;ound|ings, and were beginning to look for land, we de&s;cried &s;even &s;ail of large men of war, which &s;tood off &s;hore. Several people on board of our &s;hip &s;aid, as the two fleets were (in forty minutes from the fir&s;t &s;ight) within hail of each other, that they were Engli&s;h men of war; and &s;ome of our people even began to name &s;ome of the &s;hips.
<PB N="89" REF="023353_0096_0FBF4B21BA289490">
By this time both fleets began to min|gle, and our Admiral ordered his flag to be hoi&s;ted. At that in&s;tant the other fleet, which were French, hoi&s;ted their en&s;igns, and gave us a broad&s;ide as they pa&s;&s;ed by. Nothing could create great|er &s;urpri&s;e and confu&s;ion among us than this: the wind was high, the &s;ea rough, and we had our lower and mid|dle deck guns hou&s;ed in, &s;o that not a &s;ingle gun on board was ready to be fired at any of the French &s;hips. How|ever, the Royal William and the So|mer&s;et, being our &s;ternmo&s;t &s;hips, be|came a little prepared, and each gave the French &s;hips a broad&s;ide as they pa&s;&s;ed by. I afterwards heard this was a French &s;quadron, comanded by Mon&s;. Conflans; and certainly had the Frenchmen known our condition, and had a mind to fight us, they might have done us great mi&s;chief. But we were not long before we were prepar|ed for an engagement. Immediately many things were to&s;&s;ed overboard; the &s;hips were made ready for fighting as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and about ten at night we had bent a new main-&s;ail, the old one being &s;plit. Being now in readine&s;s for fighting, we wore &s;hip, and &s;tood after the French fleet, who
<PB N="90" REF="023353_0097_0FBF4B2337F58BD8">
were one or two &s;hips in number more than we. However we gave them cha&s;e and continued pur&s;uing them all night; and at day-light we &s;aw &s;ix of them, all large &s;hips of the line, and an En|gli&s;h Ea&s;t Indiaman, a prize they had taken. We cha&s;ed them all day till between three and four o'clock in the evening, when we came up with, and pa&s;&s;ed within a mu&s;ket &s;hot of one &s;e|venty-four gun &s;hip, and the Indiaman al&s;o, who now hoi&s;ted her colours, but immediately hauled them down again. On this we made a &s;ignal for the other &s;hips to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her; and, &s;uppo&s;ing the man of war would like|wi&s;e &s;trike, we cheered, but &s;he did not; though if we had fired into her, from being &s;o near we mu&s;t have taken her. To my utter &s;urpri&s;e, the So|mer&s;et, who was the next &s;hip a-&s;tern of the Namur, made way likewi&s;e; and, thinking they were &s;ure of this French &s;hip, they cheered in the &s;ame manner, but &s;till continued to follow us. The French Commodore was a|bout a gun-&s;hot a-head of all, running from us with all &s;peed; and about four o'clock he carried his foretopma&s;t o|verboard. This cau&s;ed another loud cheer with us; and a little after the
<PB N="91" REF="023353_0098_0FBF4B2612412438">
topma&s;t came clo&s;e by us; but, to our great &s;urpri&s;e, in&s;tead of coming up with her, we found &s;he went as fa&s;t as ever, if not fa&s;ter. The &s;ea grew now much &s;moother; and the wind lulling, the &s;eventy-four gun &s;hip we had pa&s;|&s;ed came again by us in the very &s;ame direction, and &s;o near, that we heard her people talk as &s;he went by; yet not a &s;hot was fired on either &s;ide; and a|bout five or &s;ix o'clock, ju&s;t as it grew dark, &s;he joined her commodore. We cha&s;ed all night; but the next day we were out of &s;ight, &s;o that we &s;aw no more of them; and we only had the old Indiaman (called Carnarvon I think) for our trouble. After this we &s;tood in for the channel, and &s;oon made the land; and, about the clo&s;e of the year 1758&mdash;9, we got <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">afe to St. He|len's. Here the Namur ran aground; and al&s;o another large &s;hip a&s;tern of us; but, by &s;tarting our water, and to&s;&s;ing many things overboard to lighten her, we got the &s;hips off without any da|mage. We &s;tayed for a &s;hort time at Spithead, and then went into Port&s;|mouth harbour to refit: from whence the Admiral went to London; any my ma&s;ter and I &s;oon followed, with a pre&s;&s;|gang, as we wanted &s;ome hands to complete our complement.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was now between two and three years &s;ince I fir&s;t came to England, a great part of which I had &s;pent at &s;ea; &s;o that I became inured to that &s;ervice, and began to con&s;ider my&s;elf as happily &s;ituated; for my ma&s;ter treated me al|ways extremely well; and my attach|ment and gratitude to him were very great. From the various &s;cenes I had beheld on &s;hip-board, I &s;oon grew a &s;tranger to terror of every kind, and was, in that re&s;pect at lea&s;t, almo&s;t an Engli&s;hman. I have often reflected with &s;urpri&s;e that I never felt half the alarm at any of the numerous dangers I have been in, that I was filled with at the fir&s;t &s;ight of the Europeans, and at every act of theirs, even the mo&s;t trifling, when I fir&s;t came among them, and for &s;ome time afterwards. That fear, however, which was the effect of my ignorance, wore away as I began to know them. I could now &s;peak Engli&s;h tolerably well, and I perfectly under&s;tood every thing that was &s;aid. I not only felt my&s;elf quite ea&s;y with
<PB N="94" REF="023353_0101_0FBF4B30308BCF88">
the&s;e new countrymen, but reli&s;hed their &s;ociety and manners. I no longer looked upon them as &s;pirits, but as men &s;uperior to us; and there|fore I had the &s;tronger de&s;ire to re|&s;emble them; to imbibe their &s;pirit, and imitate their manners; I therefore embraced every occa&s;ion of improve|ment; and every new thing that I ob|&s;erved I trea&s;ured up in my memory. I had long wi&s;hed to be able to read and write; and for this purpo&s;e I took every opportunity to gain in&s;truction, but had made as yet very little pro|gre&s;s. However, when I went to London with my ma&s;ter, I had &s;oon an opportunity of improving my&s;elf, which I gladly embraced. Shortly after my arrival, he &s;ent me to wait upon the Mi&s;s Guerins, who had treated me with much kindne&s;s when I was there before; and they &s;ent me to &s;chool.</P>
<P>WHILE I was attending the&s;e ladies, their &s;ervants told me I could not go to Heaven, unle&s;s I was baptized. This made me very unea&s;y; for I had now &s;ome faint idea of a future &s;tate: accordingly I communicated my anxie|ty to the elde&s;t Mi&s;s Guerin, with whom I was become a favourite, and pre&s;&s;ed her to have me baptized; when to my
<PB N="95" REF="023353_0102_0FBF4B3240D65718">
great joy, &s;he told me I &s;hould. She had formerly a&s;ked my ma&s;ter to let me be baptized, but he had refu&s;ed; however &s;he now in&s;i&s;ted on it; and he being under &s;ome obligation to her brother complied with her reque&s;t; &s;o I was baptized in St. Margaret's church, We&s;tmin&s;ter, in February 1759, by my pre&s;ent name. The clergyman at the &s;ame time, gave me a book, called a Guide to the Indians, written by the Bi&s;hop of Sodor and Man. On this occa&s;ion, Mi&s;s Guerin did me the ho|nour to &s;tand as god mother, and after|wards gave me a treat. I u&s;ed to at|tend the&s;e ladies about the town, in which &s;ervice I was extremely happy; as I had thus many opportunities of &s;eeing London, which I de&s;ired of all things. I was &s;ometimes, however, with my ma&s;ter at his rendezvous-hou&s;e, which was at the foot of We&s;t|min&s;ter-bridge. Here I u&s;ed to enjoy my&s;elf in playing about the bridge &s;tairs, and often in the waterman's wherries, with other boys. On one of the&s;e occa&s;ions there was another boy with me in a wherry, and we went out into the current of the river; while we were there, two more &s;tout boys came to us in another wherry, and abu&s;ing us
<PB N="96" REF="023353_0103_0FBF4B35F71C3720">
for taking the boat, de&s;ired me to get into the other wherry-boat. Accord|ingly I went to get out of the wherry I was in; but ju&s;t as I had got one of my feet into the other boat, the boys &s;hoved it off, &s;o that I fell into the Thames; and, not being able to &s;wim, I &s;hould unavoidably have been drowned, but for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome watermen who providentially came to my relief</P>
<P>THE Namur being again got ready for &s;ea, my ma&s;ter, with his gang, was ordered on board; and, to my no &s;mall grief, I was obliged to leave my &s;chool|ma&s;ter, whom I liked very much, and always attended while I &s;tayed in Lon|don, to repair on board with my ma&s;ter. Nor did I leave my kind pa|trone&s;&s;es, the Mi&s;s Guerins, without unea&s;ine&s;s and regret. They often u&s;ed to reach me to read, and took great pains to in&s;truct me in the prin|ciples of religion and the knowledge of God. I therefore parted from tho&s;e amiable ladies with reluctance: after receiving from them many friendly cautions how to conduct my&s;elf, and &s;ome valuable pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>WHEN I came to Spithead, I found we were de&s;tined for the Mediterra|nean,
<PB N="97" REF="023353_0104_0FBF4B3966F29C90">
with a large fleet, which was how ready to put to &s;ea. We only waited for the arrival of the admiral, who &s;oon came on board; and about the begin|ning of the &s;pring 1759, having weigh|ed anchor, and got under way, &s;ailed for the Mediterranean; and in eleven days, from the Land's End, we got to Gibraltar. While we were here I u&s;ed to be often on &s;hore, and got various fruits in great plenty, and ve|ry cheap.</P>
<P>I had frequently told &s;everal people, in my excur&s;ions on &s;hore, the &s;tory of my being kidnapped with my &s;i&s;ter, and of our being &s;eparated, as I have rela|ted before; and I had as often expre&s;&s;ed my anxiety for her fate, and my &s;orrow at having never met her again. One day, when I was on &s;hore, and men|tioning the&s;e circum&s;tances to &s;ome per&s;ons, one of them told me he knew where my &s;i&s;ter was, and, if I would accompany him, he would bring me to her. Improbable as this &s;tory was, I believed it immediately, and agreed to go with him, while my heart leaped for joy; and, indeed, he conducted me to a black young woman, who was &s;o like my &s;i&s;ter, that at fir&s;t &s;ight, I really thought it was her: but I was quickly
<PB N="98" REF="023353_0105_0FBF4B3C1CB6CCB0">
undeceived; and, on talking to her, I found her to be of another nation.</P>
<P>WHILE we lay here the Pre&s;ton came in from the Levant. As &s;oon as &s;he arrived, my ma&s;ter told me I &s;hould now &s;ee my old companion, Dick, who was gone in her when &s;he &s;ailed for Turkey. I was much rejoiced at this news, and expected every minute to embrace him; and when the cap|tain came on board of our &s;hip, which he did immediately after; I ran to in|quire after my friend; but, with inex|pre&s;&s;ible &s;orrow, I learned from the boat's crew that the dear youth was dead! and that they had brought his che&s;t, and all his other things, to my ma&s;ter: th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e he afterwards gave to me, and I regarded them as a memorial of my friend, whom I loved, and griev|ed for, as a brother.</P>
<P>WHILE we were at Gibralter, I &s;aw a &s;oldier hanging by the heels, at one of the moles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He had drowned him&s;elf in endeavouring to de&s;ert.</NOTE>: I thought this a &s;trange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, as I had &s;een a man hanged in London by his neck. At another time I &s;aw the ma&s;ter of a frigate towed to more on a grating, by &s;everal of the men of war's boats, and di&s;charged the fleet, which I under&s;tood was a mark of di&s;|grace
<PB N="99" REF="023353_0106_0FBF4B3FD084B2E0">
for cowardice. On board the &s;ame &s;hip there was al&s;o a &s;ailor hung up at the yard-arm.</P>
<P>AFTER laying at Gibralter for &s;ome time, we &s;ailed up the Mediterranean a con&s;iderable way above the Gulf of Lyons; where we were one night overtaken with a terrible gale of wind, much greater than any I had ever yet experienced. The &s;ea ran &s;o high that, though all the guns were well hou&s;ed, there was great rea&s;on to fear their getting loo&s;e, the &s;hip rolled &s;o much; and if they had it mu&s;t have proved our de&s;truction. After we had crui&s;ed here for a &s;hort time, we came to Bar|celona, a Spani&s;h &s;ea-port, remarkable for its &s;ilk manufactures. Here the &s;hips were all to be watered; and my ma&s;ter, who &s;poke different languages, and u&s;ed often to interpret for the an|miral, &s;uperintended the watering of ours. For that purpo&s;e he and the officers of the other &s;hips, who were on the &s;ame &s;ervice, had tents pitched in the bay; and the Spani&s;h &s;oldiers we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;tationed along the &s;hore, I &s;up|po&s;e to &s;ee that no depredations were committed by our men.</P>
<P>I u&s;ed con&s;tantly to attend my ma&s;|ter; and I was charmed with this
<PB N="100" REF="023353_0107_0FBF4B422F292E60">
place. All the time we &s;tayed it was like a fair with the natives, who brought us fruits of all kinds, and &s;old them to us much cheaper than I got them in England. They u&s;ed al&s;o to bring wine down to us in hog and &s;heep &s;kins, which diverted me very much. The Spani&s;h officers here treated our officers with great politene&s;s and atten|tion; and &s;ome of them, in particular, u&s;ed to come often to my ma&s;ter's tent to vi&s;it him; where they would &s;ome|times divert them&s;elves by mounting me on the hor&s;es or mules, &s;o that I could not fall, and &s;etting them off at full gal|lop; my imperfect &s;kill in hor&s;eman&s;hip all the while affording them no &s;mall entertainment. After the &s;hips were watered, we returned to our old &s;ta|tion of cruizing off Toulon, for the purpo&s;e of intercepting a fleet of French men of war that lay there. One Sun|day, in our crui&s;e, we came off a place where there were two &s;mall French fri|gates laying in &s;hore; and our admiral, thinking to take or de&s;troy them, &s;ent two &s;hips in after them&mdash;the Culloden and the Conqueror. They &s;oon came up to the Frenchmen; and I &s;aw a &s;mart fight here, both by &s;ea and land; for the frigates were covered by bat|teries,
<PB N="101" REF="023353_0108_0FBF4B43D128CE98">
and they played upon our &s;hips mo&s;t furiou&s;ly, which they as furiou&s;ly returned, and for a long time a con|&s;tant firing was kept up on all &s;ides at an amazing rate. At la&s;t one frigate &s;unk; but the people e&s;caped, though not without much difficulty: and a little after &s;ome of the people left the other frigate al&s;o, which was a mere wreck. However, our &s;hips did not venture to bring her away, they were &s;o much annoyed from the batteries, which raked them both in going and coming: their topma&s;ts were &s;hot a|way, and they were otherwi&s;e &s;o much &s;hattered, that the admiral was obliged to &s;end in many boats to tow them back to the fleet. I afterwards &s;ailed with a man who fought in one of the French batteries during the engage|ment, and he told me our &s;hips had done con&s;iderable mi&s;chief that day on &s;hore and in the batteries.</P>
<P>AFTER this we &s;ailed for Gibraltar, and arrived there about Augu&s;t 1759. Here we remained with all our &s;ails un|bent, while the fleet was watering and doing other nece&s;&s;ary things. While we were in this &s;ituation, one day the admiral, with mo&s;t of the principal of|ficers, and many people of all &s;tations,
<PB N="102" REF="023353_0109_0FBF4B45B5180A80">
being on &s;hore, about &s;even o'clock in the evening we were alarmed by &s;ignals from the frigates &s;tationed for that purpo&s;e; and in an in&s;tant there was a general cry that the French fleet was out, and ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;treights. The admiral immediately came on board with &s;ome other of|ficers; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the noi&s;e, hurry and confu&s;ion through|out the whole fleet, in bending their fails and &s;lipping their cables; many people and &s;hip's boats were left on &s;hore in the bu&s;tle. We had two captains on board of our &s;hip who came away in the hurry and left their &s;hips to follow. We &s;hewed lights from the gun-wales to the main top ma&s;t-head; and all our lieutenants were employed among&s;t the fleet to tell the &s;hips not to wait for their captains but to put the &s;ails to the yards, &s;lip their cables and follow us; and in this confu&s;ion of making ready for fighting, we &s;et out for &s;ea in the dark after the French fleet. Here I could have exclaimed with Ajax,
<Q><L>Oh Jove! O father! if it be thy will</L>
<L>That we mu&s;t peri&s;h, we thy will obey,</L>
<L>But let us peri&s;h by the light of day.</L></Q>
They had got the &s;tart of us &s;o far that
<PB N="103" REF="023353_0110_0FBF4B4C71CD2D10">
we were not able to come up with them during the night; but at day-light we &s;aw &s;even &s;ail of the line of battle &s;ome miles ahead. We immediately cha&s;ed them till about four o'clock in the evening, when our &s;hips came up with them; and, though we were about fifteen large &s;hips, our gallant admiral only fought them with his own divi&s;ion, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;even; &s;o that we were ju&s;t &s;hip for &s;hip. We pa&s;&s;ed by the whole of the enemy's fleet in order to come at their com|mander, Mon&s;. La Clue, who was in the Ocean, an eighty-four gun &s;hip: as we pa&s;&s;ed they all fired on us; and at one time three of them fired together, continuing to do &s;o for &s;ome time. Notwith&s;tanding which our ad|miral would not &s;uffer a gun to be fired at any of them, to my a&s;toni&s;hment; but made us lie on our bellies on the deck till we came quite clo&s;e to the Ocean, who was ahead of them all; when we had orders to pour the whole three tiers into her at once.</P>
<P>THE engagement now commenced with great fury on both &s;ides: the O|cean immediately returned our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, and we continued engaged with each other for &s;ome time; during which I was fre|quently
<PB N="104" REF="023353_0111_0FBF4B4DF948D350">
&s;tunned with the thundering of the great g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s, who&s;e dreadful con|tents hurried many of my companions into awful eternity. At la&s;t the French line was entirely broken, and we obtain|ed the victory, which was immediately proclaimed with loud huzzas and ac|clamations. We took three prizes, La Mode&s;te, of &s;ixty-four guns, and Le Temeraire and Centaur, of &s;eventy-four guns each. The re&s;t of the French &s;hips took to flight with all the &s;ail they could crowd. Our &s;hip being very much damaged, and quite di&s;abled from pur|&s;uing the enemy, the admiral imme|diately quitted her, and went in the broken and only boat we had left on board the Newark, with which, and &s;ome other &s;hips, he went after the French. The Ocean, and another large French &s;hip, called the Redoubt|able, endeavouring<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to e&s;cape, ran a&s;hore at Cape Logas, on the coa&s;t of Portugal; and the French admiral and &s;ome of the crew got a&s;hore; but we, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to get the &s;hips off, &s;et fire to them both. About mid|night I &s;aw the Ocean blow up, with a mo&s;t dreadful explo&s;ion. I never be|held a more awful &s;cene. In le&s;s than a minute, the midnight for a certain
<PB N="105" REF="023353_0112_0FBF4B4F8A27C310">
&s;pace &s;eemed turned into day by the blaze, which was attended with a noi&s;e louder and more terrible than thunder, that &s;eemed to rend every element a|round us.</P>
<P>MY &s;tation during the engagement was on the middle-deck, where I was quartered with another boy, to bring powder to the aftermo&s;t gun; and here I was a witne&s;s of the dreadful fate of many of my companions, who, in the twinkling of an eye, were da&s;hed in pieces, and launched into eternity. Happily I e&s;caped unhurt, though the &s;hot and &s;plinters flew thick about me during the whole fight. Towards the latter part of it my ma&s;ter was wound|ed and I &s;aw him carried down to the &s;urgeon; but though I was much alarmed for him and wi&s;hed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him I dared not leave my po&s;t. At this &s;tation my gun-mate (a partner in bringing powder for the &s;ame gun) and I ran a very great ri&s;k for more than half an hour of blowing up the &s;hip. For, when we had taken the car|tridges out of the boxes, the bottoms of many of them proving rotten, the powder ran all about the deck, near the match tub: we &s;carcely had water enough at the la&s;t to throw on it. We
<PB N="106" REF="023353_0113_0FBF4B51CED9FC98">
were al&s;o, from our employment, very much expo&s;ed to the enemy's &s;hots; for we had to go through nearly the whole length of the &s;hip to bring the powder. I expected therefore every minute to be my la&s;t; e&s;pecially when I &s;aw our men fall &s;o thick about me; but, wi&s;hing to guard as much again&s;t the dangers as po&s;&s;ible, at fir&s;t I thought it would be &s;afe&s;t not to go for the powder till the Frenchmen had fired their broad&s;ide; and then, while they were charging, I could go and come with my powder: but immediately af|terwards I thought this caution was fruitle&s;s; and, cheering my&s;elf with the reflection that there was a time al|lotted for me to die as well as to be born, I in&s;tantly ca&s;t off all fear or thought whatever of death, and went through the whole of my duty with alacrity; plea&s;ing my&s;elf with the hope, if I &s;urvived the battle, of re|lating it and the dangers I had e&s;caped to the Mi&s;s Guerins, and others, when I &s;hould return to London.</P>
<P>OUR &s;hip &s;uffered very much in this engagement; for, be&s;ides the number of our killed and wounded, &s;he was al|mo&s;t torn to pieces, and our rigging &s;o much &s;hattered, that our mizen-ma&s;t,
<PB N="107" REF="023353_0114_0FBF4B54159BEBE0">
main-yard, &amp;c. hung over the &s;ide of the &s;hip; &s;o that we were obliged to get many carpenters, and others from &s;ome of the &s;hips of the fleet, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;etting us in &s;ome tolerable order; and, notwith&s;tanding which, it took us &s;ome time before we were complete|ly refitted; after which we left Admi|ral Broderick to command, and we, with the prizes &s;teered for England, On the pa&s;&s;age, and as &s;oon as my ma&s;|ter was &s;omething recovered of his wounds, the Admiral appointed him captain of the Etna fire-&s;hip, on which he and I left the Namur; and went on board of her at &s;ea. I liked this little &s;hip very much. I now became the captain's &s;teward, in which &s;ituation I was very happy: for I was extremely well treated by all on board; and I had lei&s;ure to improve my&s;elf in reading and writing. The latter I had learned a little of before I left the Namur, as there was a &s;chool on board. When we arrived at Spithead, the Etna went in|to Port&s;mouth harbour to refit, which being done, we returned to Spithead and joined a large fleet that was thought to be intended again&s;t the Ha|vannah; but about that time the king died; whether that prevented the ex|pedition
<PB N="108" REF="023353_0115_0FBF4B5A14B8CF40">
I know not; but it cau&s;ed our &s;hip to be &s;tationed at Cowes, in the i&s;le of Wight, till the beginning of the year &s;ixty one. Here I &s;pent my time very plea&s;antly; I was much on &s;hore all about this delightful i&s;land, and found the inhabitants very civil.</P>
<P>WHILE I was here, I met with a trifling incident, which &s;urpri&s;ed me agreeably. I was one day in a field belonging to a gentleman who had a black boy about my own &s;ize; this boy having ob&s;erved me from his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, was tran&s;ported at the &s;ight of one of his own countrymen, and ran to meet me with the utmo&s;t ha&s;te. I not knowing what he was about, turned a little out of his way at fir&s;t, but to no purpo&s;e: he &s;oon came clo&s;e to me and caught hold of me in his arms as if I had been his brother, though we had never &s;een each other before. After we had talked together for &s;ome time he took me to his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, where I was treated very kindly. This bene|volent boy and I were very happy in frequently &s;eeing each other till about the month of March, 1761, when our &s;hip had orders to fit out again for an|other expedition. When we got ready we joined a very large fleet at Spithead,
<PB N="109" REF="023353_0116_0FBF4B5B83C08A70">
commanded by Commodore Keppel, which was de&s;tined again&s;t Belle-I&s;le, and with a number of tran&s;port &s;hips with troops on board to make a de&s;cent on the place, we &s;ailed once more in que&s;t of fame. I longed to engage in new adventures and &s;ee fre&s;h wonders.</P>
<P>I had a mind on which every thing uncommon made its full impre&s;&s;ion, and every event which I con&s;idered as marvellous. Every extraordinary e&s;cape, or &s;ignal deliverance, either of my&s;elf or others, I looked upon to be effected by the interpo&s;ition of Provi|dence. We had not been above ten days at &s;ea before an incident of this kind happened; which, whatever cre|dit it may obtain from the reader, made no &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion on my mind.</P>
<P>WE had on board a gunner, who&s;e name was John Mondle; a man of very indifferent morals. This man's cabin was between the decks, exactly over where I lay, abrea&s;t of the quarter-deck ladder. One night, the 5th of April, being terrified with a dream, he awoke in &s;o great a fright that he could not re&s;t in his bed any longer, nor even remain in his cabin; and he went upon deck a|bout four o'clock in the morning ex|tremely agitated. He immediately told
<PB N="110" REF="023353_0117_0FBF4B5D0A0FB6D0">
tho&s;e on the deck of the agonies of his mind, and the dream which occa&s;ioned it; in which he &s;aid he had &s;een many things very awful, and had been warned by St. Peter to repent, who told him time was &s;hort. This he &s;aid had greatly alarmed him, and he was determined to alter his life. People generally mock the fears of others when they are them&s;elves in &s;afety; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of his &s;hipmates who heard him only laughed at him. However, he made a vow that he never would drink &s;trong liquors again; and he immediately got a light, and gave away his &s;ea-&s;tores of liquor. After which, his agitation &s;till continuing, he began to read the Scriptures, hoping to find &s;ome relief; and &s;oon afterwards he laid him&s;elf down again on his bed, and endeavoured to compo&s;e him&s;elf to &s;leep, but to no purpo&s;e; his mind &s;till continuing in a &s;tate of agony. By this time it was exactly half after &s;even in the morn|ing: I was then under the half-deck at the great cabin door; and all at once I heard the people in the wai&s;t cry out, mo&s;t fearfully&mdash;<Q>The Lord have mercy upon us! We are all lo&s;t! The Lord have mercy upon us!</Q> Mr. Mondle hearing the cries, immediately
<PB N="111" REF="023353_0118_0FBF4B6038D25748">
ran out of his cabin; and we were in|&s;tantly &s;truck by the Lynne, a forty gun &s;hip, Captain Clark, which nearly run us down. This &s;hip had ju&s;t put about, and was by the wind, but had not got full head way, or we mu&s;t all have peri&s;hed; for the wind was bri&s;k. However, before Mr. Mondle had got four &s;teps from his cabin door, &s;he &s;truck our &s;hip with her cutwater right in the middle of his bed and cabin, and ran it up to the combings of the quarter deck hatchway, and above three feet below water, and in a minute there was not a bit of wood to be &s;een where Mr. Mondle's cabin &s;tood; and he was &s;o near being killed that &s;ome of the &s;plinters tore his face. As Mr. Mon|dle mu&s;t inevitably have peri&s;hed from this accident had he not been alarmed in the very extraordinary way I have related, I could not help regarding this as an awful interpo&s;ition of Providence for his pre&s;ervation. The two &s;hips for &s;ome time &s;winged along&s;ide of each other; for ours being a fire&s;hip, our grappling-irons caught the Lynne every way, and the yards and rigging went at an a&s;toni&s;hing rate. Our &s;hip was in &s;uch a &s;hocking condition that we all thought &s;he would in&s;tantly go
<PB N="112" REF="023353_0119_0FBF4B67CB1A29C0">
down, and every one ran for their lives, and got as well as they could on board the Lynne; but our lieutenant being the aggre&s;&s;or, he never quitted the &s;hip. However, when we found &s;he did not &s;ink immediately, the captain came on board again, and encouraged our peo|ple to return and try to &s;ave her. Many on this came back, but &s;ome would not venture. Some of the &s;hips in the fleet &s;eeing our &s;ituation, immediately &s;ent their boats to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but it took us the whole day to &s;ave the &s;hip with all their help. And by u&s;ing every po&s;&s;ible means, particularly frapping her together with many haw&s;ers, and putting a great quantity of tallow be|low water where &s;he was damaged, &s;he was kept together: but it was well we did not meet with any gales of wind, or we mu&s;t have gone to pieces; for we were in &s;uch a crazy condition that we had &s;hips to attend us till we arrived at Belle-I&s;le, the place of our de&s;tina|tion; and then we had all things taken out of the &s;hip, and &s;he was properly repaired. This e&s;cape of Mr. Mondle, which he, as well as my&s;elf, always con&s;idered as a &s;ingular act of Provi|dence, I believe had a great influence on his life and conduct ever afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="023353_0120_0FBF4B68F3C403A0">
Now that I am on this &s;ubject I beg leave to relate another in&s;tance or two which &s;trongly rai&s;ed my belief of the particular interpo&s;ition of Heaven, and which might not otherwi&s;e have found a place here, from their in&s;ignificance. I belonged for a few days in the year 1758, to the Ja&s;on, of fifty-four guns, at Plymouth; and one night, when I was on board, a woman, with a child at her brea&s;t, fell from the upper-deck down into the hold, near the keel. Every one thought that the mother and child mu&s;t be both da&s;hed to pieces; but, to our great &s;urpri&s;e, neither of them was hurt. I my&s;elf one day fell headlong from the upper deck of the Etna down the after-hold, when the balla&s;t was out; and all who &s;aw me fall cried out I was killed: but I re|ceived not the lea&s;t injury. And in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame &s;hip a man fell from the ma&s;t-head on the deck without being hurt. In the&s;e, and in many more in&s;tances, I thought I could plainly trace the hand of God, without who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion a &s;parrow cannot fall. I began to rai&s;e my fear from man to him alone, and to call daily on his holy name with fear and reverence: and I tru&s;t he heard my &s;upplications, and graciou&s;ly
<PB N="114" REF="023353_0121_0FBF4B6A755D3588">
conde&s;cended to an&s;wer me according to his holy word, and to implant the &s;eeds of piety in me, even one of the meane&s;t of his creatures.</P>
<P>WHEN we had refitted our &s;hip, and all things were in readine&s;s for attack|ing the place, the troops on board the tran&s;ports were ordered to di&s;embark; and my ma&s;ter as a junior captain, had a &s;hare in the command of the lan|ding. This was on the 12th of April. The French were drawn up on the &s;hore and had made every di&s;po&s;ition to op|po&s;e the landing of our men, only a &s;mall part of them this day being able to effect it; mo&s;t of them, after fighting with great bravery, were cut off; and General Crawford, with a number of others, were taken pri&s;oners. In this day's engagement we had al&s;o our lieutenant killed.</P>
<P>ON the 21&s;t of April we renewed our efforts to land the men, while all the men of war were &s;tationed along the &s;hore to cover it, and fired at the French batteries and brea&s;t works from early in the morning till about four o'clok in the evening, when our &s;oldiers affect|ed a &s;afe landing. They immediately attacked the French; and, after a &s;harp encounter, forced them from the bat|teries.
<PB N="115" REF="023353_0122_0FBF4B72A7324958">
Before the enemy retreated they blew up &s;everal of them, le&s;t they &s;hould fall into our hands. Our men now proceeded to be&s;iege the citadel, and my ma&s;ter was ordered on board to &s;uperintend the landing of all the ma|terials nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the &s;iege; in which &s;ervice I mo&s;tly at|tended him. While I was there I went about to different parts of the i&s;land; and one day, particularly, my curio&s;ity almo&s;t co&s;t me my life. I wanted very much to &s;ee the mode of charging the mortars and letting off the &s;hells, and for that purpo&s;e I went to an Engli&s;h battery that was but a very few yards from the walls of the citadel. There, indeed, I had an opportunity of com|pletely gratifying my&s;elf in &s;eeing the whole operation, and that not without running a very great ri&s;k, both from the Engli&s;h &s;hells that bur&s;t while I was there, but likewi&s;e from tho&s;e of the French. One of the large&s;t of their &s;hells bur&s;ted within nine or ten yards of me: there was a &s;ingle rock clo&s;e by, about the &s;ize of a butt; and I got in&s;tant &s;helter under it in time to avoid the fury of the &s;hell. Where it bur&s;t the earth was torn in &s;uch a manner that two or three butts might ea&s;ily

have gone into the hole it made, and it threw great quantities of &s;tones and dirt to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. Three &s;hot were al&s;o fired at me and another boy who was along with me, one of them in particular &s;eemed
<Q><L>Wing'd with red lightning and impetuous rage;</L></Q>
for with a mo&s;t dreadful &s;ound it hi&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by me, and &s;truck a rock at a lit|tle di&s;tance, which it &s;hattered to pie|ces. When I &s;aw what perilous cir|cum&s;tances I was in, I attempted to return the neare&s;t way I could find, and thereby I got between the Engli&s;h and the French centinels. An Engli&s;h &s;ergeant, who commanded the out|po&s;ts, &s;eeing me, and &s;urpri&s;ed how I came there, (which was by &s;tealth a|long the &s;ea&s;hore), reprimanded me very &s;everely for it, and in&s;tantly took the centinel off his po&s;t into cu&s;tody, for his negligence in &s;uffering me to pa&s;s the lines. While I was in this &s;i|tuation I ob&s;erved at a little di&s;tance a French hor&s;e, belonging to &s;ome i&s;l|anders, which I thought I would now mount, for the greater expedition of getting off. Accordingly I took &s;ome cord which I had about me, and making a kind of bridle of it, I put it round
<PB N="117" REF="023353_0124_0FBF4B750DCF4B28">
the hor&s;e's head, and the tame bea&s;t very quietly &s;uffered me to tie him thus and mount him. As &s;oon as I was on the hor&s;e's back I began to kick and beat him, and try every means to make him go quick, but all to very little purpo&s;e: I could not drive him out of a &s;low pace. While I was creeping a|long, &s;till within reach of the enemy's &s;hot, I met with a &s;ervant well mount|ed on an Engli&s;h hor&s;e, I immediately &s;topped; and, crying, told him my ca&s;e; and begged of him to help me, and this he effectually did; for, having a fine large whip, he began to la&s;h my hor&s;e with it &s;o &s;everely, that he &s;et off full &s;peed with me towards the &s;ea, while I was quite unable to hold or manage him. In this manner I went along till I came to a craggy precipice. I now could not &s;top my hor&s;e; and my mind was filled with apprehen&s;ions of my deplorable fate &s;hould he go down the precipice, which he appear|ed fully di&s;po&s;ed to do: I therefore thought I had better throw my&s;elf off him at once, which I did immediately with a great deal of dexterity, and fortunately e&s;caped unhurt. As &s;oon as I found my&s;elf at liberty I made the be&s;t of my way for the &s;hip, determined
<PB N="118" REF="023353_0125_0FBF4B767909C2C8">
I would not be &s;o fool-hardy again in a hurry.</P>
<P>WE continued to be&s;iege the citadel till June, when it &s;urrendered. During the &s;iege I have counted above &s;ixty &s;hells and carca&s;es in the air at once. When this place was taken I went through the citadel, and in the bomb-proofs under it, which were cut in the &s;olid rock; and I thought it a &s;urpri&s;ing place, both for &s;trength and building: notwith&s;tanding which our &s;hots and &s;hells had made amazing deva&s;tation, and ruinous heaps all around it.</P>
<P>AFTER the taking of this i&s;land, our &s;hips with &s;ome others commanded by commodore Stanhope in the Swift-&s;ure, went to Ba&s;&s;e road, where we blocked up a French fleet.

to Belle-I&s;le, and there &s;tayed till the &s;ummer, when we left it, and returned to Port&s;mouth.</P>
<P>AFTER our &s;hip was fitted out again for &s;ervice, in September &s;he went to Guern&s;ey, where I was very glad to &s;ee my old ho&s;te&s;s, who was now a widow, and my former little charming com|panion, her daughter. I &s;pent &s;ome time here very happily with them, till October, when we had orders to re|pair to Port&s;mouth. We parted from each other with a great deal of affec|tion; and I promi&s;ed to return &s;oon, and &s;ee them again; not knowing what all-powerful fate had determined for me. Our &s;hip having arrived at Port&s;|mouth, we went into the harbour, and remained there till the latter end of November, when we heard great talk about a peace; and, to our very great joy, in the beginning of December we
<PB N="121" REF="023353_0128_0FBF4B827AED6F18">
had orders to go up to London with our &s;hip to be paid off. We received this news with loud huzzas, and every other demon&s;tration of gladne&s;s; and nothing but mirth was to be &s;een throughout every part of the &s;hip. I too was not without my &s;hare of the general joy on this occa&s;ion. I thought now of nothing but being freed, and working for my&s;elf, and thereby get|ting money to enable me to get a good education; for I always had a great de&s;ire to be able at lea&s;t to read and write; and while I was on &s;hip-board I had endeavoured to improve my&s;elf in both. While I was in the Etna par|ticularly, the captain's clerk taught me to write, and gave me a &s;mattering of arithmetic as far as the rule of three. There was al&s;o one Daniel Queen, a|bout forty years of age, a man very well educated, who me&s;&s;ed with me on board this &s;hip, and he likewi&s;e dre&s;&s;ed and attended the captain. Fortunately this man &s;oon became very much attached to me, and took very great pains to in|&s;truct me in many things. He taught me to &s;have and dre&s;s hair a little, and al&s;o to read in the Bible, explaining many pa&s;&s;ages to me, which I did not comprehend. I was wonderfully &s;ur|pri&s;ed
<PB N="122" REF="023353_0129_0FBF4B8408AA5A70">
to &s;ee the laws and rules of my own country written almo&s;t exactly here; a circum&s;tance which I believe tended to impre&s;s our manners and cu|&s;toms more deeply on my memory. I u&s;ed to tell him of this re&s;emblance; and many a time we have &s;at up the whole night together at this employ|ment. In &s;hort, he was like a father to me; and &s;ome even u&s;ed to call me after his name; they al&s;o &s;tyled me the black Chri&s;tian. Indeed I almo&s;t lov|ed him with the affection of a &s;on. Many things I have denied my&s;elf that he might have them; and when I u&s;ed to play at marbles or any other game, and won a few halfpence, or got any little money, which I &s;ome|times did, for &s;having any one, I u&s;ed to buy him a little &s;ugar or tobacco, as far as my &s;tock of money would go. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he and I never &s;hould part; and that when our &s;hip was paid off, as I was as free as him&s;elf or any other man on board, he would in&s;truct me in his bu&s;ine&s;s, by which I might gain a good livelihood. This gave me new life and &s;pirits; and my heart burned within me, while I thought the time long till I obtained my free|dom. For though my ma&s;ter had not
<PB N="123" REF="023353_0130_0FBF4B879BA95450">
promi&s;ed it to me, yet, be&s;ides the a&s;&s;u|rances I had received that he had no right to detain me, he always treated me with the greate&s;t kindne&s;s, and re|po&s;ed in me an unbounded confidence; he even paid attention to my morals; and would never &s;uffer me to deceive him, or tell lies, of which he u&s;ed to tell me the con&s;equences; and that if I did &s;o God would not love me; &s;o that from all this tenderne&s;s, I had never once &s;uppo&s;ed, in all my dreams of freedom, that he would think of detaining me any longer than I wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uance of our orders we &s;ailed from Port&s;month for the Thames, and arrived at Deptford the 10th of De|cember, where we ca&s;t anchor ju&s;t as it was high water. The &s;hip was up about half an hour, when my ma&s;ter ordered the barge to be manned; and all in an in&s;tant, without having before given me the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect any thing of the matter, he forced me into the barge; &s;aying, I was going to leave him, but he would take care I &s;hould not I was &s;o &s;truck with the unex|pectedne&s;s of this proceeding, that for &s;ome time I did not make a reply, only I made an offer to go for my

books and che&s;t of clothes, but he &s;wore I &s;hould not move out of his &s;ight; and if I did he would cut my throat, at the &s;ame time taking his hanger. I began, however, to collect my&s;elf; and, plucking up courage, I told him I was free, and he could not by law &s;erve me &s;o. But this only enraged him the more; and he con|tinued to &s;wear, and &s;aid he would &s;oon let me know whether he would or not, and at that in&s;tant &s;prung him|&s;elf into the barge from the &s;hip, to the a&s;toni&s;hment and &s;orrow of all on board. The tide, rather unluckily for me, had ju&s;t turned downward, &s;o that we quickly fell down the river along with it, till we came among &s;ome out|ward-bound We&s;t Indiamen; for he was re&s;olved to put me on board the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el he could get to receive me. The boat's crew, who pulled again&s;t their will, became quite faint, different times, and would have gone a&s;hore; but he would not let them. Some of them &s;trove then to cheer me, and told me he could not fell me, and that they would &s;tand by me, which revived me a little; and I &s;till entertained hopes; for as they pulled along he a&s;ked &s;ome ve&s;&s;els to receive me, but they would
<PB N="125" REF="023353_0132_0FBF4B8E75F73368">
not. But, ju&s;t as we had got a little below Grave&s;end, we came along &s;ide of a &s;hip which was going away the next tide for the We&s;t Indies; her name was the charming Sally, Captain James Doran; and my ma&s;ter went on board and agreed with him for me; and in a little time I was &s;ent for into the cabin. When I came there Cap|tain Doran a&s;ked me if I knew him: I an&s;wered that I did not; "Then," &s;aid he, "you are now my &s;lave." I told him my ma&s;ter could not &s;ell me to him, nor to any one el&s;e. "Why," &s;aid he, "did not your ma&s;ter buy you?" I confe&s;&s;ed he did. <Q>But I have &s;erved him,</Q> &s;aid I, <Q>many years, and he has taken all my wages and prize-money, for I had only got one &s;ixpence during the war; be&s;ides this I have been baptized; and by the laws of the land no man has a right to &s;ell me:</Q> And I added that I had heard a lawyer and others at dif|ferent times tell my ma&s;ter &s;o.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THUS, at the moment I expected all my toils to end, was I plunged, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, in a new &s;lavery; in compa|ri&s;on of which all my &s;ervice hitherto had been perfect freedom; and who&s;e horrors, always pre&s;ent to my mind, now ru&s;hed on it with tenfold aggra|vation. I wept very bitterly for &s;ome time: and began to think that I mu&s;t have done &s;omething to di&s;plea&s;e the Lord, that he thus puni&s;hed me &s;o &s;e|verely. This filled me with painful reflections on my pa&s;t conduct; I re|collected that on the morning of our arrival at Deptford I had ra&s;hly &s;worn
<PB N="129" REF="023353_0136_0FBF4B99F70EF0B0">
that as &s;oon as we reached London I would &s;pend the day in rambling and &s;port. My con&s;cience &s;mote me for this unguarded expre&s;&s;ion: I felt that the Lord was able to di&s;appoint me in all things, and immediately con&s;ider|ed my pre&s;ent &s;ituation as a judgment of Heaven on account of my pre&s;ump|tion in &s;wearing: I therefore, with con|trition of heart, acknowledged my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion to God, and poured out my &s;oul before him with unfeigned re|pentance, and with earne&s;t &s;upplica|tions I be&s;ought him not to abandon me in my di&s;tre&s;s, nor ca&s;t me from his mercy for ever. In a little time my grief, &s;pent with its own violence, began to &s;ub&s;ide; and after the fir&s;t confu&s;ion of my thoughts was over I reflected with more calmne&s;s on my pre&s;ent condition: I con&s;idered that trials and di&s;appointments are &s;ome|times for our good, and I thought God might perhaps have permitted this, in order to teach me wi&s;dom and re&s;igna|tion; for he had hitherto &s;hadowed me with the wings of his mercy, and by his invi&s;ible but powerful hand brought me the way I knew not. The&s;e re|flections gave me a little comfort, and I ro&s;e at la&s;t from the deck with de|jection
<PB N="130" REF="023353_0137_0FBF4BA115253158">
and &s;orrow in my countenance, yet mixed with &s;ome faint hope that the <HI>Lord would appear</HI> for my deli|verance.</P>
<P>SOON afterwards, as my new ma&s;ter was going on &s;hore, he called me to him, and told me to behave my&s;elf well, and do the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;hip the &s;ame as any of the re&s;t of the boys, and that I &s;hould fare the better for it; but I made him no an&s;wer. I was then a&s;ked if I could &s;wim, and I &s;aid, No. How|ever I was made to go under the deck, and was well watched. The next tide the &s;hip got under way, and &s;oon after arrived at the Mother Bank, Port&s;mouth; where &s;he waited a few days for &s;ome of the We&s;t India convoy. While I was here I tried every means I could devi&s;e among&s;t the people of the &s;hip to get me a boat from the &s;hore, as there was none &s;uf|fered to come along&s;ide of the &s;hip; and their own, whenever it was u&s;ed, was hoi&s;ted in again immediately. A &s;ailor on board took a guinea from me on pretence of getting me a boat; and promi&s;ed me, time after time, that it was hourly to come off. When he had the watch upon deck I watched al&s;o; and looked long enough, but all

in vain; I could never &s;ee either the boat or my g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inea again. And what I thought was &s;till the wor&s;t of all, the fellow gave information, as I after|wards found, all the while to the mates, of my intention to go off, if I could in any way do it; but, rogue like, he never told them he had got a guinea from me to procure my e&s;cape. However, after we had &s;ailed, and his trick was made known to the &s;hip's crew, I had &s;ome &s;atisfaction in &s;eeing him dete&s;ted and de&s;pi&s;ed by them all for his behaviour to me, I was &s;till in hopes that my old &s;hipmates would not forget their promi&s;e to come for me to Port&s;mouth: and, indeed, at la&s;t, but not till the day before we &s;ail|ed, &s;ome of them did come there, and &s;ent me off &s;ome oranges, and other tokens of their regard. They al&s;o &s;ent me word they would come off to me them&s;elves the next day or the day af|ter; and a lady al&s;o, who lived in Go&s;port, wrote to me that &s;he would come and take me out of the &s;hip at the &s;ame time. This lady had been once very intimate with my former ma&s;ter: I u&s;ed to &s;ell and take care of a great deal of property for her, in dif|ferent &s;hips; and in return &s;he always

&s;hewed great friend&s;hip for me, and u&s;ed to tell my ma&s;ter that &s;he would take me away to live with her: but, unfortunately for me, a di&s;agreement &s;oon afterwards took place between them; and &s;he was &s;ucceeded in my ma&s;ter's good graces by another lady, who appeared &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of the Etna, and mo&s;tly lodged on board. I was not &s;o great a favourite with this lady as with the former; &s;he had conceived a pique again&s;t me on &s;ome occa&s;ion when &s;he was on board, and &s;he did not fail to in&s;tigate my ma&s;ter to treat me in the manner he did<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thus was I &s;acrificed to the envy and re&s;ent|ment of this woman for knowing that the lady whom &s;he had &s;ucceeded in my ma&s;ter's good graces de&s;igned to take me into her &s;ervice; which, had I once got on &s;hore, &s;he would not have been able to prevent. She felt her pride alarmed at the &s;uperiority of her rival in being attended by a black &s;ervant: it was not le&s;s to prevent this than to be revenged on me, that &s;he cau&s;ed the captain to treat me thus cruelly.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the next morning, the 30th of December, the wind being bri&s;k and ea&s;terly, the Aeolus frigate, which was to e&s;cort the convoy, made a &s;ignal for &s;ailing. All the &s;hips then got up their anchors; and, before any of my friends had an opportunity to

<P>ABOUT the middle of May, when the &s;hip was got ready to &s;ail for England, I all the time believing that Fate's blacke&s;t clouds were gathering over my head, and expecting their bur&s;ting would mix me with the dead, Captain Doran &s;ent for me a&s;hore one morning, and I was told by the me&s;&s;enger that my fate was then determined. With trem|bling &s;teps and fluttering heart I came to the captain, and found with him one Mr. Robert King, a quaker, and the fir&s;t merchant in the place. The cap|tain then told me my former ma&s;ter had &s;ent me there to be &s;old; but that he had de&s;ired him to get me the be&s;t ma&s;|ter he could, as he told him I was a ve|ry de&s;erving boy, which Captain Doran &s;aid he found to be true; and if he were to &s;tay in the We&s;t Indies he would be glad to keep me him&s;elf; but he could not venture to take me to Lon|don&punc; for he was very &s;ure that when I came there I would leave him.

that in&s;tant bur&s;t out a crying, and beg|ged much of him to take me to En|gland with him, but all to no purpo&s;e. He told me he had got me the very be&s;t ma&s;ter in the whole i&s;land, with whom I &s;hould be as happy as if I were in En|gland, and for that rea&s;on he cho&s;e to let him have me, though he could &s;ell me to his own brother-in-law for a great deal more money than what he got from this gentleman. Mr. King, my new ma&s;ter, then made a reply, and &s;aid the rea&s;on he had bought me was on account of my good character; and as he had not the lea&s;t doubt of my good behaviour, I &s;hould be very well off with him. He al&s;o told me he did not live in the We&s;t Indies, but at Phila|delphia, where he was going &s;oon; and, as I under&s;tood &s;omething of the rules of arithmetic, when we got there he would put me to &s;chool, and fit me for a clerk. This conver&s;ation reliev|ed my mind a little, and I left tho&s;e gentlemen con&s;iderably more at ea&s;e in my&s;elf than when I came to them; and I was very thankful to Captain Do|ran, and even to my old ma&s;ter, for the character they had given me; a cha|racter which I afterwards found of in|finite &s;ervice to me.

again, and took leave of all my &s;hip|mates; and the next day the &s;hip &s;ailed. When &s;he weighed anchor I went to the water&s;ide and looked at her with a very wi&s;hful and aching heart, and fol|lowed her with my eyes until &s;he was totally out of &s;ight. I was &s;o bowed down with grief that I could not hold up my head for many months; and if my new ma&s;ter had not been kind to me I believe I &s;hould have died under it at la&s;t. And indeed I &s;oon &s;ound that he fully de&s;erved the good character which Captain Doran had given me of him; for he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t amiable di&s;po&s;ition and temper, and was very charitable and humane. If any of his &s;laves behaved ami&s;s he did not beat or u&s;e them ill, but parted with them. This made them afraid of di&s;obliging him; and as he treated his &s;laves bet|ter than any other man on the i&s;land, &s;o he was better and more faithfully &s;er|ved by them in return. By this kind treatment I did at la&s;t endeavour to compo&s;e my&s;elf; and with fortitude, though moneyle&s;s, determined to face whatever fate had decreed for me. Mr. King &s;oon a&s;ked me what I could do; and at the &s;ame time &s;aid he did not mean to treat me as a common &s;lave.

He loaded many ve&s;&s;els in a year; particularly to Philadelphia, where he was born, and was connected with a great mercantile hou&s;e in that city. He had be&s;ides many ve&s;&s;els and droggers, of different &s;izes, which u&s;ed to go about the i&s;land; and others, to collect rum, &s;ugar, and other goods.

I have rowed the boat, and &s;laved at the oars, from one hour to &s;ixteen in the twenty-four; during which I had fifteen pence &s;ter|ling per day to live on, though &s;ome|times only ten pence.

was con&s;iderably more than was allow|ed to other &s;laves that u&s;ed to work often with me, and belonged to other gentlemen on the i&s;land: tho&s;e poor &s;ouls had never more than nine-pence per day, and &s;eldom more than &s;ix|pence, from their ma&s;ters or owners, though they earned them three or four pi&s;terines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e pi&s;terines are of the valus of a &s;hilling.</NOTE>: for it is a common prac|tice in the We&s;t Indies for men to pur|cha&s;e &s;laves though they have not plan|tations them&s;elves, in order to let them out to planters and merchants at &s;o much a peice by the day, and they give what allowance they chu&s;e out of this produce of their daily work to their &s;laves for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; this allowance is often very &s;canty. My ma&s;ter often gave the owners of the&s;e &s;laves two and a half of the&s;e pieces per day, and found the poor fellows in victuals him&s;elf, be|cau&s;e he thought their owners did not feed them well enough according to the work they did. The &s;laves u&s;ed to like this very well; and, as they knew my ma&s;ter to be a man of feeling, they were always glad to work for him in preference to any other gentleman; &s;ome of whom after they had been paid for the&s;e poor people's labours,
<PB N="141" REF="023353_0148_0FBF4BBCF96F9530">
would not give them their allowance out of it. Many times have I even &s;een the&s;e unfortunate wretches beaten for a&s;king for their pay; and often &s;everely flogged by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wners if they did not bring them their daily or weekly money exactly to the time; though the poor creatures were obliged to wait on the gentlemen they had worked for &s;ometimes for more than half the day before they could get their pay; and this generally on Sun|days, when they wanted the time for them&s;elves. In particular, I knew a countryman of mine who once did not bring the weekly money directly that it was earned; and though he brought it the &s;ame day to his ma&s;ter, yet he was &s;taked to the ground for his pre|tended negligence, and was ju&s;t going to receive a hundred la&s;hes, but for a gentleman who begged him off fifty. This poor man was very indu&s;trious; and by his frugality, had &s;aved &s;o much money by working on &s;hip-board, that he had got a white man to buy him a boat, unknown to his ma&s;ter. Some time after he had this little e&s;tate, the governor wanted a boat to bring his &s;ugar from different parts of the i&s;land; and, knowing this to be a negro-man's
<PB N="142" REF="023353_0149_0FBF474F10CD25C0">
boat, he &s;eized upon it for him&s;elf, and would not pay the owner a far|thing. The man on this went to his ma&s;ter, and complained to him of this act of the governor; but the only &s;atis|faction he received was to be damned very heartily by his ma&s;ter, who a&s;ked him how dared any of his negroes to have a boat. If the ju&s;tly-merited ruin of the governor's fortune could be a|ny gratification to the poor man he had thus robbed, he was not without con|&s;olation. Extortion and rapine are poor providers; and &s;ome time after this the governor died in the King's Bench in England, as I was told, in great poverty. The la&s;t war favoured this poor negro-man, and he found &s;ome means to e&s;cape from his Chri&s;ti|an ma&s;ter: he came to England; where I &s;aw him afterwards &s;everal times. Such treatment as this often drives the&s;e mi&s;erable wretches to de&s;pair, and they run away from their ma&s;ters at the hazard of their lives. Many of them, in this place, unable to get their pay when they have earned it, and fearing to be flogged, as u&s;ual, if they return home without it, run away where they can for &s;helter, and a reward is often offered to bring them in dead or alive.
<PB N="143" REF="023353_0150_0FBF475137B71790">
My ma&s;ter u&s;ed &s;ometimes, in the&s;e ca|&s;es, to agree with their owners, and to &s;ettle with them him&s;elf; and thereby he &s;aved many of them a flogging.</P>
<P>ONCE, for a few days, I was let out to fit a ve&s;&s;el, and I had no victuals allowed me by either party; at la&s;t I told my ma&s;ter of this treatment, and he took me away from it. In many of the e&s;tates, on the different i&s;lands where I u&s;ed to be &s;ent for rum or &s;ugar, they would not deliver it to me, or any o|ther negro; he was therefore obliged to &s;end a white man along with me to tho&s;e places; and then he u&s;ed to pay him from &s;ix to ten pi&s;terines a day. From being thus employed, during the time I &s;erved Mr. King, in going a|bout the different e&s;tates on the i&s;land, I had all the opportunity I could wi&s;h for to &s;ee the dreadful u&s;age of the poor men; u&s;age that reconciled me to my &s;ituation, and made me ble&s;s God for the hands into which I had fallen,</P>
<P>I HAD the good fortune to plea&s;e my ma&s;ter in every department in which he employed me; and there was &s;carcely any part of his bu&s;ine&s;s, or hou&s;hold affairs, in which I was not occa&s;ionally engaged. I often &s;upplied the place of a clerk, in receiving and
<PB N="144" REF="023353_0151_0FBF475686FD71A8">
delivering cargoes to the &s;hips, in tending &s;tores, and delivering goods: and, be&s;ides this, I u&s;ed to &s;have and dre&s;s my ma&s;ter when convenient, and take care of his hor&s;e; and when it was nece&s;&s;ary, which was very often, I worked likewi&s;e on board of different ve&s;&s;els of his. By the&s;e means I became very u&s;eful to my ma&s;ter; and &s;aved him, as he u&s;ed to acknowledge, above a hundred pounds a year. Nor did he &s;cruple to &s;ay I was of more advantage to him than any of his clerks; though their u&s;ual wages in the We&s;t-Indies are from &s;ixty to a hundred pounds current a year.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;ometimes heard it a&s;&s;erted that a negro cannot earn his ma&s;ter the fir&s;t co&s;t; but nothing can be further from the truth. I &s;uppo&s;e nine tenths of the mechanics throughout the We&s;t-Indies are negro &s;laves; and I well know the coopers among them earn two dol|lars a day; the carpenters the &s;ame, and oftentimes more; as al&s;o the ma|&s;ons, &s;miths, and fi&s;hermen, &amp;c. and I have known many &s;laves who&s;e ma&s;ters would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ot take a thou&s;and pounds cur|rent for them. But &s;urely this a&s;&s;erti|tion refutes it&s;elf; for, if it be true, why do the planters and merchants pay
<PB N="145" REF="023353_0152_0FBF47580B8061B8">
&s;uch a price for &s;laves? And, above all, why do tho&s;e who make this a&s;&s;er|tion exclaim the mo&s;t loudly again&s;t the abolition of the &s;lave trade? So much are men blinded, and to &s;uch in|con&s;i&s;tent arguments are they driven by mi&s;taken intere&s;t! I grant, indeed, that &s;laves are &s;ometimes, by half-feeding, half-clothing, over-working &amp; &s;tripes, reduced &s;o low, that they are turned out as unfit for &s;ervice, and left to peri&s;h in the woods, or expire on a dung|hill.</P>
<P>MY Ma&s;ter was &s;everal times offered by different gentlemen one hundred guineas for me; but he always told them he would not &s;ell me, to my great joy: and I u&s;ed to double my diligence and care for fear of getting into the hands of tho&s;e men who did not allow a valuable &s;lave the common &s;upport of life. Many of them even u&s;ed to find fault with my ma&s;ter for feeding his &s;laves &s;o well as he did, although I often went hungry, and an Engli&s;hman might think my fare very indifferent; but he u&s;ed to tell them he always would do it, becau&s;e the &s;laves thereby looked better and did more work.</P>
<P>WHILE I was thus employed by my ma&s;ter I was often a witne&s;s to cruelties
<PB N="146" REF="023353_0153_0FBF475983584ED8">
of every kind, which were exerci&s;ed on my unhappy fellow &s;laves. I u&s;ed frequently to have different cargoes of new negroes in my care for &s;ale; and it was almo&s;t a con&s;tant practice with our clerks, and other whites, to commit violent depredations on the cha&s;tity of the female &s;laves; and the&s;e I was, though with reluctance, obliged to &s;ubmit to at all times, being unable to help them. When we have had &s;ome of the&s;e &s;laves on board my ma&s;ter's ve&s;&s;els to carry them to other i&s;lands, or to America, I have known our mates to commit the&s;e acts mo&s;t &s;hamefully, to the di&s;grace, not of Chri&s;tians only, but of men. I have even known them gratify their brutal pa&s;&s;ion with females not ten years old; and the&s;e abomi|nations &s;ome of them practi&s;ed to &s;uch &s;candalous exce&s;s, that one of our cap|tains di&s;charged the mate and others on that account. And yet in Mont|&s;errat I have &s;een a negro man &s;taked to the ground, and cut mo&s;t &s;hocking|ly, and then his ears cut off bit by bit, becau&s;e he had been connected with a white woman who was a common pro&s;titute: as if it were no crime in the whites to rob an innocent African girl of her virtue; but mo&s;t henious in a

<P>ONE Mr. D&mdash;told me that he had &s;old 41000 negroes, and that he once cut off a negro-man's leg for run|ning away&mdash;I a&s;ked him if the man&punc; had died in the operation, how he as a chri&s;tian could an&s;wer for the horrid act before God? and he told me, an|&s;wering was a thing of another world; what he thought and did were policy. I told him that the chri&s;tian doctrine taught us to do unto others as we would that others &s;hould do unto us. He then &s;aid that his &s;cheme had the de&s;ired ef|fect&mdash;it cured that man and &s;ome others of running away.</P>
<P>ANOTHER negro-man was half hang|ed, and then burnt, for attempting to poi&s;on a cruel over&s;eer. Thus by re|peated cruelties are the wretched fir&s;t urged to de&s;pair, and then murdered, becau&s;e they &s;till retain &s;o much of hu|man nature about them as to wi&s;h to put an end to their mi&s;ery, and retali|ate on their tyrants! The&s;e over&s;eers are indeed for the mo&s;t part per&s;ons of the wor&s;t character of any denomina|tion

of men in the We&s;t Indies. Un|fortunately, many humane gentleman, by not re&s;iding on their e&s;tates, are obliged to leave the management of them in the hands of the&s;e human butchers, who cut and mangle the &s;laves in a &s;hocking manner on the mo&s;t trifling occa&s;ions, and altogether treat them in every re&s;pect like brutes. They pay no regard to the &s;ituation of pregnant women, nor the lea&s;t atten|tion to the lodging of the field negroes. Their huts, which ought to be well co|vered, and the place dry where they take their little repo&s;e, are often open &s;heds, built in damp places; &s;o that, when the poor creatures return tired from the toils of the field, they con|tract many di&s;orders, from being ex|po&s;ed to the damp air in this uncom|fortable &s;tate, while they are heated, and their pores are open. This neglect certainly con&s;pires with many others to cau&s;e a decrea&s;e in the births as well as in the lives of the grown negroes. I can quote many in&s;tances of gentle|men who re&s;ide on their e&s;tates in the We&s;t-Indies, and then the &s;cene is quite changed; the negroes are treated with lenity and proper care, by which their lives are prolonged, and their ma&s;ters

profited. To the honour of humanity, I knew &s;everal gentlemen who managed their e&s;tates in this manner; and they found that benevolence was their true intere&s;t. And, among many I could mention in &s;everal of the i&s;lands, I knew one in Mont&s;errat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dubury, and many others, Mont&s;errat,</NOTE> who&s;e &s;laves looked remarkably well, and never needed any fre&s;h &s;upplies of negroes; and there are many other e&s;tates, e&s;pe|cially in Barbadoes, which, from &s;uch judicious treatment, need no fre&s;h &s;tock of negroes at any time. I have the honour of knowing a mo&s;t worthy and humane gentleman, who is a native of Barbadoes, and has e&s;tates there<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir Philip Gibbes, Baronet, Barbadoes.</NOTE> This gentleman has written a treati&s;e on the u&s;age of his own &s;laves.

For want, therefore, of &s;uch care and atten|tion to the poor negroes, and otherwi&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed as they are, it is no wonder that the decrea&s;e &s;hould require 20,000 new negroes annually to fill up the vacant places of the dead.</P>

a negro man, named Emanuel Sankey, who endeavoured to e&s;cape from his mi&s;erable bondage, by concealing him|&s;elf on board of a London &s;hip: but fate did not favour the poor oppre&s;&s;ed man; for, being di&s;covered when the ve&s;&s;el was under &s;ail, he was delivered up again to his ma&s;ter. This <HI>Chri&s;tian ma&s;ter</HI> immediately pinned the wretch down to the ground at each wri&s;t and ancle, and then took &s;ome &s;ticks of &s;ealing wax, and lighted them, and dropped it all over his back.

<P>IT was very common in &s;everal of the i&s;lands, particularly in St. Kitt's, for the &s;laves to be branded with the initial letters of their ma&s;ter's name; and a load of heavy iron hooks hung<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> about their necks. Indeed on the mo&s;t

<P>NOR is there any greater regard &s;hewn to the little property than there is to the per&s;ons and lives of the negroes. I have already related an in&s;tance or two of particular oppre&s;&s;ion out of many which I have witne&s;&s;ed; but the following is frequent in all the i&s;lands. The wretched field-&s;laves, after toil|ing all the day for an unfeeling owner, who gives them but little victuals, &s;teal &s;ometimes a few moments from re&s;t or refre&s;hment to gather &s;ome &s;mall portion of gra&s;s, according as their time will admit. This they com|monly tie up in a parcel; either a bit's worth (&s;ixpence) or half a bit's worth; and bring it to town, or to the market, to &s;ell. Nothing is more common than for the white people on this oc|ca&s;ion to take the gra&s;s from them without paying for it; and not only &s;o, but too often al&s;o, to my know|ledge, our clerks, and many others, at the &s;ame time have committed acts of violence on the poor, wretched, and helple&s;s females; whom I have &s;een for hours &s;tand crying to no purpo&s;e, and get no redre&s;s or pay of any kind.

One of the&s;e depredators once, in St. Eu|&s;tatia, came on board of our ve&s;&s;el, and bought &s;ome fowls and pigs of me; and a whole day after his departure with the things, he returned again and wanted his money back: I refu&s;ed to give it; and, not &s;eeing my captain on board, he began the common pranks with me; and &s;wore he would even break open my che&s;t and take my mo|ney. I therefore expected, as my cap|tain was ab&s;ent, that he would be as good as his word and he was ju&s;t pro|ceeding to &s;trike me, when fortunately a Briti&s;h &s;eaman on board, who&s;e heart had not been debauched by a We&s;t India climate, interpo&s;ed and prevent|ed him. But had the cruel man &s;truck me I certainly &s;hould have defended my&s;elf at the hazard of my life; for what is life to a man thus oppre&s;&s;ed? He went away, however &s;wearing and threatened that whenever he caught me

<P>THE &s;mall account in which the life of a negro is held in the We&s;t Indies, is &s;o univer&s;ally known, that it might &s;eem impertinent to quote the follow|ing extract, if &s;ome people had not been hardy enough of late to a&s;&s;ert that negroes are on the &s;ame footing in that re&s;pect as Europeans. By the 329th Act, page 125, of the A&s;&s;embly of Barbadoes, it is enacted <Q>That if any negro, or other &s;lave, under puni&s;hment by his ma&s;ter, or his order, for running away, or any o|ther crime or mi&s;demeanor towards his &s;aid ma&s;ter, unfortunately &s;hall &s;uffer in life or member, no per&s;on what&s;oever &s;hall be liable to a fine; but if any man &s;hall out of <HI>wanton|ne&s;s, or only of bloody-mindedne&s;s, or cruel intention, wilfully kill a negro, or other &s;lave, of his own, he &s;hall pay in|to the public trea&s;ury fifteen pounds &s;terling,</HI></Q> And it is the &s;ame in mo&s;t, if not all, of the We&s;t India i&s;l|ands. Is not this one of the many acts of the i&s;lands which call loudly for redre&s;s? And do not the a&s;&s;embly which enacted it de&s;erve the appel|lation of &s;avages and brutes rather
<PB N="156" REF="023353_0163_0FBF4779C1B8A0C8">
than of chri&s;tians and men? It is an act at once unmerciful, unju&s;t, and unwi&s;e; which for cruelty would di&s;grace an a&s;&s;embly of tho&s;e who are called barbarians; and for its inju&s;tice and <HI>in&s;anity</HI> would &s;hock the morality and common &s;en&s;e of a Sa|maide of Hottentot.</P>
<P>SHOCKING as this and many more acts of the bloody We&s;t India code at fir&s;t view appear, how is the iniquity of it heightened when we con&s;ider to whom it may be extended! Mr. James Tobin, a zealous labourer in the vineyard of &s;lavery, gives an account of a French planter of his acquaintance, in the i&s;land of Martinico, who &s;hewed him many mulattoes working in the fields like bea&s;ts of burden; and he told Mr. Tobin the&s;e were all the produce of his own loins! And I my&s;elf have known &s;imilar in&s;tances. Pray, reader, are the&s;e &s;ons and daughters of the French planter le&s;s his children by being be|gotten on black women? And what mu&s;t be the virtue of tho&s;e legi&s;lators, and the feelings of tho&s;e fathers, who e&s;timate the lives of their &s;ons, how|ever begotten, at no more than fifteen pounds; though they &s;hould be mur|dered, as the act &s;ays, <HI>out of wantonne&s;s

and bloody-mindedne&s;s!</HI> But is not the &s;lave trade entirely a war with the heart of man? And &s;urely that which is be-begun by breaking down the barriers of virtue involves in its continuance de&s;truction to every principle, and bu|ries all &s;entiments in ruin!</P>
<P>I have often &s;een &s;laves, particularly tho&s;e who were meagre, in different i&s;lands, put into &s;cales and weighed; and then &s;old from three pence to &s;ix pence or nine pence a pound. My ma&s;ter, however, who&s;e humanity was &s;hocked at this mode, u&s;ed to &s;ell &s;uch by the lump. And at or after a &s;ale it was not uncommon to &s;ee negroes taken from their wives, wives taken from their hu&s;bands, and children from their parents, and &s;ent off to other i&s;lands, and wherever el&s;e their mer|cile&s;s lords choo&s;e; and probably never more during life &s;ee each other! Often|times my heart has bled at the&s;e part|ings; when the friends of the depart|ed have been at the water &s;ide, and with &s;ighs and tears, have kept their eyes fixed on the ve&s;&s;el, till it went out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>A poor Creole negro I knew well who, after having been often thus tran&s;|ported from i&s;land to i&s;land, at la&s;t re&s;i|ded

in Mont&s;errat. This man u&s;ed to tell me many melancholy tales of him|&s;elf. Generally, after he had done working for his ma&s;ter, he u&s;ed to em|ploy his few lei&s;ure moments to go a fi&s;hing. When he had caught any fi&s;h, his ma&s;ter would frequently take them from him without paying him; and at other times &s;ome other white people would &s;erve him in the &s;ame manner. One day he &s;aid to me, very movingly, <Q>Sometimes when a white man take away my fi&s;h I go to my ma&s;er, and he get me my right; and when my ma&s;er by &s;trength take away my fi&s;h|es, what me mu&s;t do?

I exhorted the man to look up &s;till to the God on the top, &s;ince there was no redre&s;s below.

<P>NOR was &s;uch u&s;age as this confined to particular places or individuals; for, in all the different i&s;lands in which I have been (and I have vi&s;ited no le&s;s than fifteen) the treatment of the &s;laves was nearly the &s;ame; &s;o nearly indeed, that the hi&s;tory of an i&s;land, or even a plantation, with a few &s;uch exceptions as I have mentioned, might &s;erve for a hi&s;tory of the whole. Such a ten|dency has the &s;lave-trade to debauch men's minds, and harden them to every feeling of humanity! For I will not &s;uppo&s;e that the dealers in &s;laves are born wor&s;e than other men&mdash;No; it is the fatality of this mi&s;taken avarice, that it corrupts the milk of human kindne&s;s and turns it into gall. And, had the pur&s;uits of tho&s;e men been different, they might have been as generous, as tender-hearted and ju&s;t, as they are unfeeling, rapacious and cruel. Surely this traffic cannot be good, which &s;preads like a pe&s;tilence, and taints what it touches! which violates that fir&s;t natural right of man|kind, equality and independency, and gives one man a dominion over his

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the preceeding chapter I have &s;et before the reader a few of tho&s;e many in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion, extortion, and cruelty, which I have been a witne&s;s to in the We&s;t indies: but, were I to enumerate them all, the catalogue would be tedious and di&s;gu&s;ting. The puni&s;hments of the &s;laves on every tri|fling occa&s;ion are &s;o frequent, and &s;o well known together with the different in&s;truments with which they are tor|tured, that it cannot any longer afford
<PB N="163" REF="023353_0170_0FBF478AF5CB4D20">
novelty to recite them; and they are too &s;hocking to yield delight either to the writer or the reader. I &s;hall there|fore hereafter only mention &s;uch as in|cidentally befell my&s;elf in the cour&s;e of my adventures,</P>
<P>IN the variety of departments in which I was employed by my ma&s;ter, I had an opportunity of &s;eeing many cu|rious &s;cenes in different i&s;lands; but, above all, I was &s;truck with a celebrated curio&s;ity called Brim&s;tone-Hill, which is a high and &s;teep mountain, &s;ome few miles from the town of Plymouth in Mont&s;erat. I had often heard of &s;ome wonders that were to be &s;een on this hill, and I went once with &s;ome white and black people to vi&s;it it. When we arrived at the top, I &s;aw under different cliffs great flakes of brim&s;tone, occa|&s;ioned by the &s;treams of various little ponds, which were then boiling natu|rally in the earth. Some of the&s;e ponds were as white as milk, &s;ome quite blue, and many other's of different co|lours. I had taken &s;ome potatoes with me, and I put them into different ponds, and in a few minutes they were well boiled. I ta&s;ted &s;ome of them, but they were very &s;ulphurous; and the &s;ilver &s;hoe buckles, and all the other things
<PB N="164" REF="023353_0171_0FBF478ECE35C970">
of that metal we had among us, were, in a little time turned as black as lead.</P>
<P>SOME time in the year 1763, kind Pro|vidence &s;eemed to appear rather more favourable to me. One of my ma&s;ter's ve&s;&s;els, a Bermudas &s;loop, about &s;ixty tons burthen was commanded by one Captain Thomas Farmer, an Engli&s;h|man, a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lert and active man, who gained my ma&s;ter a great deal of mo|ney by his good management in carry|ing pa&s;&s;engers from one i&s;land to ano|ther; but very often his &s;ailors u&s;ed to get drunk and run away from the ve&s;&s;el, which hindered him in his bu&s;ine&s;s very much. This man had taken a liking to me; and many different times begged of my ma&s;ter to let me go a trip with him as a &s;ailor; but he would tell him he could not &s;pare me, though the ve&s;|&s;el &s;ometimes could not go for want of hands, for &s;ailors were generally very &s;carce in the i&s;land. However, at la&s;t, from nece&s;&s;ity or force, my ma&s;ter was prevailed on, though very reluctantly, to let me go with this captain; but he gave him great charge to take care that I did not run away, for if I did he would make him pay for me. This being the ca&s;e, the captain had for &s;ome time a &s;harp eye upon me when|ever
<PB N="165" REF="023353_0172_0FBF479102CFDD28">
the ve&s;&s;el anchored; and as &s;oon as &s;he returned I was &s;ent for on &s;hore again. Thus was I &s;laving as it were for life, &s;ometimes at one thing, and &s;ometimes at another: &s;o that the cap|tain and I were nearly the mo&s;t u&s;eful men in my ma&s;ter's employment. I al&s;o became &s;o u&s;eful to the captain on &s;hip-board, that many times, when he u&s;ed to a&s;k for me to go with him, though it &s;hould be but for twenty-four hours, to &s;ome of the i&s;lands near us, my ma&s;ter would an&s;wer he could not &s;pare me, at which the captain would &s;wear, and would not go the trip: and tell my ma&s;ter I was better to him on board than any three white men he had; for they u&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o behave ill in many re&s;pects, particularly in getting drunk; and then they frequently got the boat &s;tove, &s;o as to hinder the ve&s;|&s;el from coming back as &s;oon as &s;he might have done. This my ma&s;ter knew very well; and at la&s;t, by the captain's con&s;tant entreaties, after I had been &s;everal times with him, one day to my great joy, told me the cap|tain would not let him re&s;t, and a&s;ked whether I would go aboard as a &s;ailor, or &s;tay on &s;hore and mind the &s;tores, for he could not bear any longer to be
<PB N="166" REF="023353_0173_0FBF47928CFA4BD0">
plagued in this manner. I was very happy at this propo&s;al, for I immedi|ately thought I might in time &s;tand &s;ome chance by being on board to get a little money, or po&s;&s;ibly make my e&s;cape if I &s;hould be u&s;ed ill: I al&s;o expected to get better food, and in greater abun|dance; for I had oftentimes felt much hunger, though my ma&s;ter treated his &s;laves, as I have ob&s;erved, uncommon|ly well. I therefore, without he&s;ita|tion, an&s;wered him, that I would go and be a &s;ailor if he plea&s;ed. Accor|dingly I was ordered on board directly. Neverthele&s;s, between the ve&s;&s;el and the &s;hore, when &s;he was in port, I had little or no re&s;t, as my ma&s;ter always wi&s;hed to have me along with him. In|deed he was a very plea&s;ant gentle|man, and but for my expectations on &s;hipboard I &s;hould not have thought of leaving him. But the captain liked me al&s;o very much, aud I was entirely his right-hand man. I did all I could to de&s;erve his favour, and in return I received better treatment from him than any other I believe ever met with in the We&s;t Indies in my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>AFTER I had been &s;ailing for &s;ome time with this captain, at length I endea|voured to try my luck and commence
<PB N="167" REF="023353_0174_0FBF479A67C84BB0">
merchant. I had but a very &s;mall ca|pital to begin with; for one &s;ingle half bit, which is equal to three-pence in England, made up my whole &s;tock. However I tru&s;ted to the Lord to be with me; and at one of our trips to <HI>St. Eu&s;tatia,</HI> a Dutch i&s;land I bought a gla&s;s tumbler with my half bit, and when I came to Mont&s;errat I &s;old it for a bit, or &s;ix-pence. Luckily we made &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive trips to St. Eu&s;tatia (which was a general mart for the We&s;t-Indies, about twenty leagues from Mont&s;errat) and in our next, finding my tumbler &s;o profitable, with this one bit I bought two tumblers more; and when I came back I &s;old them for two bits equal to a &s;hilling &s;terling. When we went again I bought with the&s;e two bits four more of the&s;e gla&s;&s;es, which I &s;old for four bits on our return to Mont&s;errat: and in our next voyage to St. Eu&s;tatia, I bought two gla&s;&s;es with one bit, and with the other three I bought a jug of Geneva, nearly about three pints in mea&s;ure. When we came to Mont&s;errat, I &s;old the gin for eight bits, and the tumblers for two, &s;o that my capital now a|mounted in all to a dollar, well hu&s;|banded and acquired in the &s;pace of a
<PB N="168" REF="023353_0175_0FBF479C40036718">
month or &s;ix weeks, when I ble&s;&s;ed the Lord that I was &s;o rich. As we &s;ailed to different i&s;lands, I laid this money out in various things occa&s;ion|ally, and it u&s;ed to turn to very good account, e&s;pecially when we went to Guadalope, Grenada, and the re&s;t of the French i&s;lands. Thus was I going all about the i&s;lands upwards of four years, and ever trading as I went, dur|ing which I experienced many in&s;tances of ill u&s;age, and have &s;een many in|juries done to other negroes in our dealings with whites: and, amid&s;t our recreations, when we have been dan|cing and merry-making, they, with|out cau&s;e have mole&s;ted and in&s;ulted us. Indeed I was more than once o|bliged to look up to God on high, as I had advi&s;ed the poor fi&s;herman &s;ome time before. And I had not been long trading for my&s;elf in the manner I have related above, when I experienced the like trial in company with him as fol|lows: This ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> being u&s;ed to the wa|ter, was upon an emergency put on board of us by his ma&s;ter to work as another hand, on a voyage to Santa Cruz; and at our &s;ailing he had brought his little all for a venture which con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix bits' worth of limes and
<PB N="169" REF="023353_0176_0FBF479DDBD2F878">
oranges in a bag; I had al&s;o my whole &s;tock, which was about twelve-bits' worth of the &s;ame kind of goods, &s;e|parate in two bags; for we had heard the&s;e fruits &s;old well in that i&s;land. When we came there, in &s;ome little convenient time he and I went a&s;hore with our fruits to &s;ell them; but we had &s;carcely landed when we were met by two white men, who pre&s;ently took our three bags from us. We could not at fir&s;t gue&s;s what they meant to do; and for &s;ome time we thought they were je&s;ting with us; but they too &s;oon let us know otherwi&s;e; for they took our ventures immediately to a hou&s;e hard by, and adjoining the fort, while we followed all the way begging of them to give us our fruits, but in vain. They not only refu&s;ed to return them but &s;wore at us, and threatened if we did not immediately depart they would flog us well We told them the&s;e three bags were all we were worth in the world, and that we brought them with us to &s;ell when we came from Mont&s;errat, and &s;hewed them the ve&s;&s;el. But this was rather again&s;t us, as they now &s;aw we were &s;trangers, as well as &s;laves. They &s;till therefore &s;wore, and de&s;ired us to be gone, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="170" REF="023353_0177_0FBF479FF7BFD1F0">
took &s;ticks to beat us; while we, &s;eeing they meant what they &s;aid, went off in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion and de&s;pair. Thus, in the very minute of gaining more by three times than I ever did by any venture in my life before, was I deprived of every farthing I was worth. An un&s;upportable misfortune! but how to help our&s;elves we knew not. In our con&s;ternation we went to the commanding officer of the fort, and told him how we had been &s;erved by &s;ome of his people; but we obtained not the lea&s;t redre&s;s: he an&s;wered our complaints only by a volley of impre|cations again&s;t us, and immediately took a hor&s;e-whip, in order to cha&s;ti&s;e us &s;o that we were obliged to turn out much fa&s;ter than we came in. I now, in the agony of di&s;tre&s;s and indig|nation, wi&s;hed that the ire of God in his forked lightning might transfix the&s;e cruel oppre&s;&s;ors among the dead. Still however we per&s;evered; went back again to the hou&s;e, and begged and be|&s;ought them again and again for our fruits, till at la&s;t &s;ome other people that were in the hou&s;e a&s;ked if we would be contented if they kept one bag and gave us the other two. We, &s;eeing no remedy whatever, con&s;ented to this;
<PB N="171" REF="023353_0178_0FBF47A63AB52CC0">
and they, ob&s;erving one bag to have both kinds of fruit in it, which be|longed to my companion, kept that; and the other two, which were mine they gave us back. As &s;oon as I got them, I ran as fa&s;t as I could, and got the fir&s;t negro man I could to help me off; my companion, however, &s;tay|ed a little longer to plead; he told them the bag they had was his, and likewi&s;e all that he was worth in the world; but this was of no avail, and he was obliged to return without it. The poor old man wringing his hands, cri|ed bitterly for his lo&s;s; and, indeed, he then did look up to God on high, which &s;o moved me with pity for him, that I gave him nearly one third of my fruits. We then proceeded to the markets to &s;ell them; and Providence was more favourable to us than we could have expected, for we &s;old our fruits uncommonly well; I got for mine about thirty-&s;even bits. Such a &s;urpri&s;ing rever&s;e of fortune in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time &s;eemed like a dream, and proved no &s;mall encouragement for me to tru&s;t the Lord in any &s;ituation.

<P>AT one of our trips to St. Kitt's, I had eleven bits of my own; and my friendly captain lent me five more, with which I bought a Bible. I was very glad to get this book, which I &s;carcely could meet with any where. I think there was none &s;old in Mont|&s;errat; aud, much to my grief, from being forced out of the Etna in the manner I have related, my Bible, and the Guide to the Indians, the two books I loved above all others, were left behind.</P>
<P>WH<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">LE I was in this place, St. Kitt's, a very curious impo&s;ition on human nature took place:&mdash;A white man wanted to marry in the church a free black woman that had land and &s;laves in Mont&s;errat: but the clergyman told him it was again&s;t the law of the place to marry a white and a black in the church. The man then a&s;ked to be married on the water, to which the

par&s;on con&s;ented, and the two lovers went in one boat, and the par&s;on and clerk in another, and thus the cere|mony was performed. After this the loving pair came on board our ve&s;&s;el, and my captain treated them extreme|ly well, and brought them &s;afe to Mont&s;errat.</P>
<P>The reader cannot but judge of the irk&s;omene&s;s of this &s;ituation to a mind like mine, in being daily expo&s;ed to new hard&s;hips and impo&s;itions, after having &s;een many better days, and been as it were, in a &s;tate of freedom and plenty; added to which, every part of the world I had hitherto been in, &s;eemed to me a paradi&s;e in campari&s;on of the We&s;t-Indies. My mind was therefore hourly replete with inven|tions and thoughts of being freed, and, if po&s;&s;ible, by hone&s;t and honourable means; for I always remembered the old adage; and I tru&s;t it has ever been my ruling principle, that <Q>Hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy;</Q> and likewi&s;e that other golden precept&mdash;<Q>To do unto all men as I would they &s;hould do unto me.</Q> However, as I was from early years a prede&s;tinarian, I thought whatever fate had determined mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver come to pa&s;s; and therefore,
<PB N="174" REF="023353_0181_0FBF47B04D464CD8">
if ever it were my lot to be freed nothing could prevent me, although I &s;hould at pre&s;ent &s;ee no means or hope to ob|tain my freedom; on the other hand if it were my fate not to be freed I never &s;hould be &s;o, and all my endea|vours for that purpo&s;e would be fruit|le&s;s. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e thoughts I therefore looked up with prayers anxi|ou&s;ly to God for my liberty; and at the &s;ame time u&s;ed every hone&s;t means, and did all that was po&s;&s;ible on my part to obtain it. In proce&s;s of time I became ma&s;ter of a few pounds, and in a fair way of making more, which my friendly captain knew very well; this occa&s;ioned him &s;ometimes to take liberties with me; but whenever he treated me wa&s;pi&s;hly I u&s;ed plainly to tell him my mind, and that I would die before I would be impo&s;ed upon as other negroes were, and that to me life had lo&s;t its reli&s;h when liberty was gone. This I &s;aid although I fore&s;aw my then well-being or future hopes of freedom (humanly &s;peaking) depended on this man. However, as, he could not bear the thoughts of my not &s;ailing with him, he always became mild on my threats. I therefore continued with him; and, from my great attention to
<PB N="175" REF="023353_0182_0FBF47B188C5F4D8">
his orders and his bu&s;ine&s;s, I gained him credit, and through his kindne&s;s to me I at la&s;t procured my liberty. While I thus went on, filled with the thoughts of freedom, and re&s;i&s;ting oppre&s;&s;ion as well as I was able my life hung daily in &s;u&s;pence, particularly in the &s;urfs I have formerly mentioned, as I could not &s;wim. The&s;e are extremely violent throughout the We&s;t Indies, and I was ever expo&s;ed to their howling rage and devouring fury in all the I&s;lands. I have &s;een them &s;trike and to&s;s a boat right up an end, and maim &s;everal on board. Once in the Grenada i&s;lands, when I and about eight others were pulling a large boat with two punche|ons of water in it, a &s;urf &s;truck us, and drove the boat and all in it about half a &s;tone's throw, among &s;ome trees, and above the high water mark. We were obliged to get all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance we could from the neare&s;t e&s;tate to mend the boat, and launch it into the water again. At Mont&s;errat one night in pre&s;&s;ing hard to get off the &s;hore on board, the punt was over&s;et with us four times; the fir&s;t time I was very near being drowned; however the jacket I had on kept me up above water a little &s;pace of time, while I called on a man near me who
<PB N="176" REF="023353_0183_0FBF47B2C96A7238">
was a good &s;wimmer, and told him I could not &s;wim; he then made ha&s;te to me, and, ju&s;t as I was &s;inking, he caught hold of me, and brought me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounding, and then he went and brought the punt al&s;o. As &s;oon as we had turned the water out of her le&s;t we &s;hould be u&s;ed ill for being ab&s;ent, we attempted again three times more, and as often the horrid &s;urfs &s;erved us as at fir&s;t; but at la&s;t, the fifth time we attempted, we gained our point, at the eminent hazard of our lives. One day al&s;o, at Old Road in Mont&s;errat, our captain, and three men be&s;ides my&s;elf, were go|ing in a large canoe in que&s;t of rum and &s;ugar, when a &s;ingle &s;urf to&s;&s;ed the ca|noe an amazing di&s;tance from the water, and &s;ome of us, near a &s;tone's throw from each other: mo&s;t of us were very much brui&s;ed; &s;o that I and many more often &s;aid, and really thought, that there was not &s;uch another place under the heavens as this. I longed therefore much to leave it, and daily wi&s;hed to &s;ee my ma&s;ter's promi&s;e per|formed of going to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>WHILE we lay in this place a very cruel thing happened on board our &s;loop which filled me with horror; though I found afterwards &s;uch prac|tices
<PB N="177" REF="023353_0184_0FBF47B4391C8B60">
were frequent. There was a very clever and decent free young mulatto-to-man who &s;ailed a long time with us: he had a free woman for his wife, by whom he had a child; and &s;he was then living on &s;hore, and all very hap|py. Our captain and mate, and other people on board, and &s;everal el&s;ewhere, even the natives of Bermudas, all knew this young man from a child that he was always free, and no one had ever claimed him as their property: how|ever, as might too often overcomes right in the&s;e parts, it happened that a Bermudas captain, who&s;e ve&s;&s;el lay there for a few days in the road, came on board of us, and &s;eeing the mulatto-man, who&s;e name was Jo&s;eph Clip&s;on, he told him he was not free, and that he had orders from his ma&s;ter to bring him to Bermudas. The poor man could not believe the captain to be in earne&s;t; but he was very &s;oon unde|ceived, his men laying violent hands on him; and although he &s;hewed a certi|ficate of his being born free in St. Kitt's, and mo&s;t people on board knew that he &s;erved his time to boat-build|ing, and always pa&s;&s;ed for a free man, yet he was forcibly taken out of our ve&s;&s;el. He then a&s;ked to be carried
<PB N="178" REF="023353_0185_0FBF47BC5CD48DE0">
a&s;hore before the &s;ecretary or magi&s;|trates, and the&s;e infernal invaders of human rights promi&s;ed him he &s;hould: but, in&s;tead of that, they carried him on board of the other ve&s;&s;el: and the next day, without giving the poor man any hearing on &s;hore, or &s;uffering him even to &s;ee his wife or child, he was carried away, and probably doomed never more in this world to &s;ee them again. Nor was this the only in&s;tance of this kind of barbarity I was a wit|ne&s;s to. I have &s;ince often &s;een in Jamaica and other i&s;lands, free men, whom I have known in America, thus villainou&s;ly trepanned and held in bon|dage. I have heard of two &s;imilar prac|tices even in Philadelphia: and were it not for the benevolence of the quak|ers in that city, many of the &s;able race, who now breathe the air of liberty, would, I believe, be groaning indeed under &s;ome planter's chains. The&s;e things opened my mind to a new &s;cene of horror to which I had been before a &s;tranger. Hitherto I had thought only &s;lavery dreadful; but the &s;tate of a free negro appeared to me now equally &s;o at lea&s;t, and in &s;ome re&s;pects even wor&s;e, for they live in con&s;tant alarm for their liberty; which is but nomi|nal,
<PB N="179" REF="023353_0186_0FBF47BDC0FFDC00">
for they are univer&s;ally in&s;ult|ed and plundered without the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of redre&s;s; for &s;uch is the equity of the We&s;t Indian laws, that no free negro's evidence will be admitted in their courts of ju&s;tice. In this &s;ituation is it &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;laves, when mildly treated, &s;hould prefer even the mi&s;ery of &s;lavery to &s;uch a mockery of free|dom? I was now completely di&s;gu&s;ted with the We&s;t Indies, and thought I never &s;hould be entirely free until I had left them.</P>

<P>I determined to make every exertion to obtain my freedom, and to return to Old England. For this purpo&s;e I thought a knowledge of navigation might be of u&s;e to me; for, though I did not intend to run away unle&s;s I &s;hould be ill u&s;ed; yet, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, if I under&s;tood navigation, I might attempt my e&s;cape in our &s;loop, which was one of the &s;wifte&s;t &s;ailing ve&s;&s;els in the We&s;t Indies, and I could be at no lo&s;s for hands to join me: and if I
<PB N="180" REF="023353_0187_0FBF47BEC0663BE0">
&s;hould make this attempt, I had in|tended to have gone for England; but this, as I &s;aid, was only to be in the event of my meeting with any ill u&s;age. I therefore employed the mate of our ve&s;|&s;el to teach me navigation, for which I agreed to give him twenty-four dollars, and actually paid him part of the money down; though when the captain, &s;ome time after, came to know that the mate was to have &s;uch a &s;um for teaching me, he rebuked him, and &s;aid it was a &s;hame for him to take any money from me. However, my progre&s;s in this u&s;eful art was much retarded by the con&s;tancy of our work. Had I wi&s;hed to run away I did not want op|portunities, which frequently pre&s;ented them&s;elves; and particularly at one time, &s;oon after this. When we were at the i&s;land of Gaurdeloupe there was a large fleet of merchantmen bound for Old France; and, &s;eamen then be|ing very &s;carce, they gave from fifteen to twenty pounds a man for the run. Our mate, and all the white &s;ailors, left our ve&s;&s;el on this account, and went on board of the French &s;hips. They would have had me al&s;o to go with them, for they regarded me; and &s;wore to protect me, if I would
<PB N="181" REF="023353_0188_0FBF47C037E9BC68">
go: and, as the fleet was to &s;ail the next day, I really believe I could have got &s;afe to Europe at that time. How|ever, as my ma&s;ter was kind, I would not attempt to leave him; &s;till re|membering the old maxim, that "ho|ne&s;ty is the be&s;t policy," I &s;uffered them to go without me. Indeed my captain was much afraid of my leaving him and the ve&s;&s;el at that time, as I had &s;o fair an opportunity: but, I thank God, this fidelity of mine turned out much to my advantage hereafter, when I did not in the lea&s;t think of it; and made me &s;o much in favour with the captain, that he u&s;ed now and then to teach me &s;ome parts of navigation him&s;elf; but &s;ome of our pa&s;&s;engers, and others, &s;eeing this, found much fault with him for it, &s;aying it was a very dangerous thing to let a negro know navigation; thus I was hindred again in my pur&s;uits. About the lat|ter end of the year 1764, my ma&s;ter bought a larger &s;loop, called the Pru|dence, about &s;eventy or eighty tons, of which my captain had the command. I went with him into this ve&s;&s;el, and we took a load of new &s;laves for Georgia and Charles Town. My ma&s;ter now left me entirely to the captain, though
<PB N="182" REF="023353_0189_0FBF47C7B5B11E00">
he &s;till wi&s;hed for me to be with him; but I, who always much wi&s;hed to lo&s;e &s;ight of the We&s;t Indies, was not a lit|tle rejoiced at the thoughts of &s;eeing any other country. Therefore, rely|ing on the goodne&s;s of my captain, I got ready all the little venture I could; and, when the ve&s;&s;el was ready, we &s;ailed to my great joy. When we got to our de&s;tined places Georgia and Charles Town, I expected I &s;hould have an op|portunity of &s;elling my little property to advantage: but here, particularly in Charles Town, I met with buyers, white men, who impo&s;ed on me as in other places. Notwith&s;tanding, I was re&s;olved to have fortitude; thinking no lot or trial too hard when kind Hea|ven is the rewarder.</P>
<P>WE &s;oon got loaded again, and returned to Mont&s;errat; and there, among&s;t the re&s;t of the i&s;lands, I &s;old my goods well; and in this manner I continued trading during the year 1764&mdash;meeting with various &s;cenes of im|po&s;ition, as u&s;ual After this, my ma&s;ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itted out his ve&s;&s;el for Philadelphia, in the year 1765; and during the time we were loading her, and getting ready for the voyage, I worked with redoubled alacrity, from the hope of
<PB N="183" REF="023353_0190_0FBF47C947F097C0">
getting money enough by the&s;e voya|ges to buy my freedom, in time, if it &s;hould plea&s;e God; and al&s;o to &s;ee the town of Philadelphia, which I had heard a great deal about for &s;ome years pa&s;t; be&s;ides which, I had always longed to prove my ma&s;ter's promi&s;e the fir&s;t day I came to him. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e elevated ideas, and while I was about getting my little merchandize in readine&s;s, one Sunday my ma&s;ter &s;ent for me to his hou&s;e. When I came there I found him and the cap|tain together; and, on my going in, I was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at his telling me he heard that I meant to run away from him when I got to Phila|delphia: <Q>And therefore, &s;aid he, 'I mu&s;t &s;ell you again: you co&s;t me a great deal of money, no le&s;s than forty pounds &s;terling: and it will not do to lo&s;e &s;o much. You are a valuable fellow, continued he; &amp;c I can get any day for you one hun|dred guineas, from many gentlemen in this i&s;land.</Q> And then he told me of Captain Doran's brother-in law a &s;evere ma&s;ter, who ever wanted to buy me to make me his over&s;eer. My captain al&s;o &s;aid he could get much more than a hundred guineas for me
<PB N="184" REF="023353_0191_0FBF47CAC4778630">
in Carolina. This I knew to be a fact; for the gentleman that wanted to buy me came off &s;everal times on board of us, and &s;poke to me to live with him, and &s;aid he would u&s;e me well. When I a&s;ked what work he would put me to, he &s;aid, as I was a &s;ailor, he would make me a captain of one of his rice ve&s;&s;els. But I refu&s;ed: and fearing at the &s;ame time, by a &s;udden turn I &s;aw in the captain's temper, he might mean to &s;ell me, I told the gentleman I would not live with him on any con|dition, and that I certainly would run away with his ve&s;&s;el: but he &s;aid he did not fear that, as he would catch him again: and then he told me how cruelly he would &s;erve me if I &s;hould do &s;o. My captain, however, gave him to under&s;tand that I knew &s;ome|thing of navigation; &s;o he thought better of it; and, to my great joy, he went away. I now told my ma&s;ter I did not &s;ay I would run away in Phi|ladelphia; neither did I mean it, as he did not u&s;e me ill, nor yet the captain: for if they did I certainly would have made &s;ome attempts before now; but as I thought that if it were God's will I ever &s;hould be freed it would be &s;o, and, on the contrary, if it was not his

w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll it would not happen; &s;o I hoped if ever I were freed, whil&s;t I was u&s;ed well, it &s;hould be by hone&s;t means; but as I could not help my&s;elf, he mu&s;t do as he plea&s;ed; I could only hope and tru&s;t to the God of Heaven: and at that in&s;tant my mind was big with inventions and full of &s;chemes to e&s;cape. I then appealed to the cap|tain whether he ever &s;aw any &s;ign of my making the lea&s;t attempt to run away; and a&s;ked him if I did not al|ways come on board according to the time for which he gave me liberty; and, more particularly, when all our men left us at Gaurdeloupe and went on board of the French fleet, and ad|vi&s;ed me to go with them, whether I might not, and that he could not have got me again: To my no &s;mall &s;ur|pri&s;e, and very great joy, the captain confirmed every &s;yllable that I had &s;aid; and even more: for he &s;aid he had tried different times to &s;ee if I would make any attempt of this kind, both at St. Eu&s;tatia and in America, and he never found that I made the &s;malle&s;t: but on the contrary, I al|ways came on board according to his orders; and he did really believe, if I ever meant to run away, that, as I

could never have had a better oppor|tunity, I would have done it the night the mate and all the people left our ve&s;&s;el at Guardeloupe The captain then informed my ma&s;ter, who had been thus impo&s;ed on by our mate, (though I did not know who was my enemy,) the rea&s;on the mate had for impo&s;ing this lie upon him; which was, becau&s;e I had acquainted the cap|tain of the provi&s;ions the mate had given away or taken out of the ve&s;&s;el. This &s;peech of the captain was like life to the dead to me, and in&s;tantly my &s;oul glorified God; and &s;till more &s;o on hearing my ma&s;ter immediately &s;ay that I was a &s;en&s;ible fellow, and he ne|ver did intend to u&s;e me as a common &s;lave; and that but for the entreaties of the captain, and his character of me, he would not have let me go from the &s;tores about as I had done: that al&s;o, in &s;o doing, he thought by carrying one little thing or other to different places to &s;ell I might make money. That he al&s;o intended to encourage me in this, by crediting me with half a puncheon of rum and half a hog&s;head of &s;ugar at a time; &s;o that, from being careful, I might have money enough, in &s;ome time, to purcha&s;e my freedom;
<PB N="187" REF="023353_0194_0FBF47D4859E27F8">
and, when that was the ca&s;e, I might depend upon it he would let me have it for forty pounds &s;terling money, which was only the &s;ame price he gave for me. This &s;ound gladdened my poor heart beyond mea&s;ure; though indeed it was no more than the very idea I had formed in my mind of my ma&s;ter long before, and I immediately made him this reply: <Q>Sir, I always had that very thought of you, indeed I had, and that made me &s;o diligent in &s;erving you.</Q> He then gave me a large piece of &s;ilver coin, &s;uch as I never had &s;een or had before, and told me to get ready for the voyage, and he would credit me with a tierce of &s;ugar, and another of rum; he al&s;o &s;aid that he had two amiable &s;i&s;ters in Philadelphia, from whom I might get &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary things. Upon this my noble captain de&s;ired me to go a board; and, knowing the African metal, he charged me not to &s;ay any thing of this matter to any body; and he pro|mi&s;ed that the lying mate &s;hould not go with him any more. This was a change indeed; in the &s;ame hour to feel the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite pain, and in the turn of a moment the fulle&s;t joy. It cau&s;ed in me &s;uch &s;en&s;ations as I was on|ly

<P>WHILE I was in this place a very extraordinary occurrence befel me. I had been told one evening of a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> woman, a Mrs. Davis, who revealed &s;ecrets, foretold events, &amp;c. I put little faith in this &s;tory at fir&s;t, as I could not conceive that any mortal could fore&s;ee the future di&s;po&s;als of Provi|dence, nor did I believe in any other revelation than that of the Holy Scriptures; however, I was greatly a&s;to|ni&s;hed at &s;eeing this woman in a dream that night, though a per&s;on I never before beheld in my life; this made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on me, that I could not get the idea the next day out of my mind, and I then became as anxious to &s;ee her as I was before indifferent; ac|cordingly
<PB N="199" REF="023353_0196_0FBF47DAFA584F50">
in the evening, after we left off working, I enquired where &s;he lived, and being directed to her, to my inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e, beheld the very woman in the very &s;ame dre&s;s &s;he ap|peared to me to wear in the vi&s;ion. She immediately told me I had dream|ed of her the preceding night; related to me many things that had happened with a correctne&s;s that a&s;toni&s;hed me; and finally told me I &s;hould not be long a &s;lave: this was the more agree|able news, as I believed it the more readily from her having &s;o faithfully related the pa&s;t incidents of my life.

I was very ill for eleven days and near dying; eternity was now exceedingly impre&s;&s;ed on my mind, and I feared very much that awful e|vent. I prayed the Lord therefore to &s;pare me; and I made a promi&s;e in my mind to God, that I would be good if ever I &s;hould recover. At length from having an eminent doctor to attend me, I was re&s;tored again to health; and &s;oon after we got the ve&s;&s;el loaded, and &s;et off for Mont&s;errat. During the pa&s;&s;age, as I was perfectly re&s;tored, and had much bu&s;ine&s;s of the ve&s;&s;el to mind, all my endeavours to keep up my integrity, and perform my promi&s;e to God, began to fail; and, in &s;pite of all I could do, as we drew nearer and nearer to the i&s;lands, my re&s;olu|tions more and more declined, as if the very air of that country or climate &s;eemed fatal to piety. When we were &s;afe arrived at Mont&s;errat, and I had got a&s;hore, I forgot my former re&s;o|lutions.&mdash;Alas! how prone is the heart to leave that God it wi&s;hes to love! and how &s;trongly do the things of this world &s;trike the &s;en&s;es and cap|tivate

the &s;oul!&mdash;After our ve&s;&s;el was di&s;charged, we &s;oon got her ready, and took in, as u&s;ual, &s;ome of the poor oppre&s;&s;ed natives of Africa, and other negroes; we then &s;et off again for Georgia and Charl&s;town. We arrived at Georgia, and, having landed part of our cargo, proceeded to Charle&s;|town with the remainder. While we were there I &s;aw the town illuminated; the guns were fired, and bonfires and other demon&s;trations of joy &s;hewn, on account of the repeal of the &s;tamp act. Here I di&s;po&s;ed of &s;ome goods on my own account; the white men buying them with &s;mooth promi&s;es and fair words, giving me, however, but very indifferent payment. There was one gentleman particularly who bought a puncheon of rum of me, which gave me a great deal of trouble; and, al|though I u&s;ed the intere&s;t of my friend|ly captain, I could not obtain any thing for it; for, being a negro man, I could not oblige him to pay me. This vexed me much, not knowing how to act; and I lo&s;t &s;ome time in &s;eeking after this Chri&s;tian; and though, when the &s;abbath came (which the negroes u&s;ually make their holiday) I was much inclined to go to public wor&s;hip, I
<PB N="202" REF="023353_0199_0FBF47E170E60160">
was obliged to hire &s;ome black men to help to pull a boat acro&s;s the water to go in que&s;t of this gentleman. When I found him, after much entreaty, both from my&s;elf and my worthy captain, he at la&s;t paid me in dollars; &s;ome of them, however, were copper, and of con&s;equence of no value; but he took advantage of my being a negro man, and obliged me to put up with tho&s;e or none, although I objected to them. Immediately after, as I was trying to pa&s;s them in the market, among&s;t other white men, I was abu&s;ed for offering to pa&s;s bad coin; and, though I &s;hew|ed them the man I got them from, I was within one minute of being tied up and flogged without either judge or jury; however, by the help of a good pair of heels, I ran off, and &s;o e&s;caped the ba&s;tinadoes I &s;hould have received. I got on board as fa&s;t as I could, but &s;till continued in fear of them until we &s;ailed, which I thanked God we did not long after; and I have never been among&s;t them &s;ince.</P>
<P>WE &s;oon came to Georgia, where we were to complete our lading; and here wor&s;e fate than ever attended me: for one Sunday night, as I was with &s;ome negroes in their ma&s;ter's yard in the
<PB N="193" REF="023353_0200_0FBF47E6A7F6D5C0">
town of Savannah, it happened that their ma&s;ter, one Doctor Perkins, who was a very &s;evere and cruel man, came in drunk; and not liking to &s;ee any &s;trange negroes in his yard, he and a ruffian of a white man, he had in his &s;ervice, be&s;et me in an in&s;tant, and both of them &s;truck me with the fir&s;t wea|pons they could get hold of. I cried out as long as I could for help and mercy; but, though I gave a good account of my&s;elf, and he knew my captain, who lodged hard by him, it was to no purpo&s;e. They beat and mangled me in a &s;hameful manner, leaving me near dead. I lo&s;t &s;o much blood from the wounds I received, that I lay quite motionle&s;s, and was &s;o benumbed that I could not feel any thing for many hours. Early in the morning they took me away to the jail. As I did not return to the &s;hip all night, my captain, not knowing where I was, and being unea&s;y that I did not then make my appearance, he made enquiry after me; and having found where I was, immediately came to me. As &s;oon as the good man &s;aw me &s;o cut and mangled, he could not forbear weeping; he &s;oon got me out of jail to his lodgings, and immedi|ately
<PB N="194" REF="023353_0201_0FBF47E7F427DE20">
&s;ent for the be&s;t doctors in the place, who at fir&s;t declared it as their opinion that I could not recover. My captain on this went to all the lawyers in the town for their advice, but they told him they could do nothing for me as I was a negro. He then went to Doctor Perkin's the hero who had van|qui&s;hed me, and menanced him, &s;wearing he would be revenged of him, and challenged him to fight.&mdash;But cowardice is ever the companion of cruelty&mdash;and the Doctor refu&s;ed. However, by the &s;kil|fulne&s;s of one Doctor Brady of that place, I began at la&s;t to amend: but, although I was &s;o &s;ore and bad with the wounds I had all over me that I could not re&s;t in any po&s;ture, yet I was in more pain on account of the captain's unea&s;ine&s;s about me than I otherwi&s;e &s;hould have been. The worthy man nur&s;ed and watched me all the hours of the night: and I was, through his attention and that of the doctor, able to get out of bed in about &s;ixteen or eighteen days. All this time I was very much wanted on board, as I u&s;ed frequently to go up and down the river for rafts, and other parts of our cargo, and &s;tow them, when the mate was &s;ick or ab&s;ent. In about four weeks I was able to go on duty; and in a fortnight after, having got in all our lading, our ve&s;&s;el &s;et &s;ail for Mont&s;errat; and in le&s;s than three weeks we arrived there &s;afe tow|ards the end of the year. This ended my adven|tures in 1764; for I did not leave Mont&s;errat a|gain till the beginning of the following year.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>EVERY day now brought me nearer my freedom, and I was impatient till we proceeded again to &s;ea that I might have an opportunity of getting
<PB N="2" REF="023353_0206_0FBF47F4E3ACDBB8">
a &s;um large enough to purcha&s;e it. I was not long ungratified; for, in the beginning of the year 1766, my ma&s;ter bought another &s;loop, named the Nan|cy, the large&s;t I had ever &s;een. She was partly laden, and was to proceed to Philadelphia; our Captain had his choice of three, and I was well plea&s;ed he cho&s;e this, which was the large&s;t; for, from his having a large ve&s;&s;el, I had more room, and could carry a larger quantity of goods with me. Accordingly, when we had delivered our old ve&s;&s;el, the Prudence, and com|pleted the lading of the Nancy, having made near three hundred per cent, by four barrels of pork I brought from Charl&s;town, I laid in as large a cargo as I could, tru&s;ting to God's providence to pro&s;per my undertaking. With the&s;e views I &s;ailed for Philadelphia. On our pa&s;&s;age, when we drew near the land, I was for the fir&s;t time &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the &s;ight of &s;ome whales, having never &s;een any &s;uch large &s;ea mon&s;ters before; and as we &s;ailed by the land, one morning I &s;aw a puppy whale clo&s;e by the ve&s;&s;el; it was a|bout the length of a wherry boat, and it followed us all the day till we got within the Capes. We arrived &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e
<PB N="3" REF="023353_0207_0FBF47F8E8E252E8">
and in good time at Philadelphia, and I &s;old my goods there chiefly to the Quakers. They always appeared to be a very hone&s;t di&s;creet &s;ort of people, and never attempted to impo&s;e on me; I therefore liked them, and ever after cho&s;e to deal with them in preference to any others.</P>
<P>ONE Sunday morning while I was here, as I was going to church, I chanced to pa&s;s a meeting-hou&s;e. The doors being open, and the hou&s;e full of people, it excited my curio&s;ity to go in. When I entered the hou&s;e, to my great &s;urpri&s;e, I &s;aw a very tall woman &s;tanding in the mid&s;t of them, &s;peaking in an audible voice &s;omething which I could not under&s;tand. Having never &s;een any thing of this kind be|fore, I &s;tood and &s;tared about me for &s;ome time, wondering at this odd &s;cene. As &s;oon as it was over, I took an op|portunity to make inquiry about the place and people, when I was informed they were called Quakers. I particu|larly a&s;ked what that woman I &s;aw in the mid&s;t of them had &s;aid, but none of them were plea&s;ed to &s;atisfy me; &s;o I quitted them, and &s;oon after, as I was returning, I came to a church crowded with people; the church|yard
<PB N="4" REF="023353_0208_0FBF47FC7A296F50">
was full likewi&s;e, and a number of people were even mounted on lad|ders looking in at the windows. I thought this a &s;trange &s;ight, as I had never &s;een churches, either in England or the We&s;t-Indies, crowded in this manner before. I therefore made bold to a&s;k &s;ome people the meaning of all this, and they told me the Rev. Mr. George Whitfield was preaching. I had often heard of this gentleman, and had wi&s;hed to &s;ee and hear him; but I had never before had an oppor|tunity. I now therefore re&s;olved to gratify my&s;elf with the &s;ight, and pre&s;&s;ed in amid&s;t the multitude. When I got into the church I &s;aw this pious man exhorting the people with the greate&s;t fervour and earne&s;tne&s;s, and &s;weating as much as I ever did while in &s;lavery on Mont&s;errat beach. I was very much &s;truck and impre&s;&s;ed with this; I thought it &s;trange I had never &s;een divines exert them&s;elves in this manner before, and was no longer at a lo&s;s to account for the thin congrega|tions they preached to.</P>
<P>WHEN we had di&s;charged our cargo here and were loaded again, we left this fruitful land once more, and &s;et &s;ail for Mont&s;errat. My traffic had
<PB N="5" REF="023353_0209_0FBF47FDD5633C28">
hitherto &s;ucceeded &s;o well with me, that I thought, by &s;elling my goods when we arrived at Mont&s;errat, I &s;hould have enough to purcha&s;e my freedom. But as &s;oon as our ve&s;&s;el arrived there, my ma&s;ter came on board, and gave orders for us to go to St. Eu&s;tatia, and di&s;charge our cargo there, and from thence proceed for Georgia. I was much di&s;appointed at this; but thinking, as u&s;ual, it was of no u&s;e to encounter with the decrees of fate, I &s;ubmitted without repining, and we went to St. Eu&s;tatia. After we had di&s;charged our cargo there we took in a live cargo, (as we call a cargo of &s;laves.) Here I &s;old my goods tolerably well; but, not being able to lay out all my money in this &s;mall i&s;land to as much advantage as in many other places, I laid out only part, and the re|mainder, I brought away with me near. We &s;ailed from hence for Georgia, and I was glad when we got there, though I had not much rea&s;on to like the place from my la&s;t adventure in Savannah; but I longed to get back to Mont&s;errat and procure my freedom, which I ex|pected to be able to purcha&s;e when I returned. As &s;oon as we arrived here I waited on my careful doctor, Mr. Brady,
<PB N="6" REF="023353_0210_0FBF47FF5B661960">
to whom I made the mo&s;t grate|ful acknowledgments in my power for his former kindne&s;s and attention during my illne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHILE we were here, an odd cir|cum&s;tance happened to the Captain and me, which di&s;appointed us both a good deal. A &s;ilver&s;mith, whom we had brought to this place &s;ome voyage, be|fore, agreed with the Captain to return with us to the We&s;t Indies, and pro|mi&s;ed at the &s;ame time to give the Captain a great deal of money, having pretended to take a liking to him, and being, as we thought, very rich. But while we &s;tayed to load our ve&s;&s;el this man was taken ill in a hou&s;e where he worked, and in a week's time became very bad. The wor&s;e he grew the more he u&s;ed to &s;peak of giving the Captain what he had promi&s;ed him, &s;o that he expected &s;omething con&s;iderable from the death of this man, who had no wife or child, and he attended him day and night. I u&s;ed al&s;o to go with the Cap|tain, at his own de&s;ire, to attend him; e&s;pecially when we &s;aw there was no appearance of his recovery: and, in or|der to recompen&s;e me for my trouble, the Captain promi&s;ed me ten pounds, when he &s;hould get the man's property.
<PB N="7" REF="023353_0211_0FBF4800C2D26D68">
I thought this would be of great &s;er|vice to me, although I had nearly mo|ney enough to purcha&s;e my freedom, if I &s;hould get &s;afe this voyage to Mont&s;errat. In this expectation I laid out above eight pounds of my money for a &s;uit of &s;uperfine clothes to dance in at my freedom, which I hoped was then at hand. We &s;till continued to attend this man, and were with him even on the la&s;t day he lived, till very late at night, when we went on board. After we were got to bed, about one or two o'clock in the morning, the Captain was &s;ent for, and informed the man was dead. On this he came to my bed, and, waking me, informed me of it, and de&s;ired me to get up and procure a light, and immediately go with him. I told him I was very &s;leepy, and wi&s;hed he would take &s;omebody el&s;e with him; or el&s;e, as the man was dead, and could want no further at|tendance, to let all things remain as they were till the next morning. <Q>No, no, &s;aid he, we will have the money to-night, I cannot wait till to morrow; &s;o let us go.</Q> Accor|dingly I got up and &s;truck a light, and away we both went and &s;aw the man as dead as we could wi&s;h. The Captain
<PB N="8" REF="023353_0212_0FBF4807A5B48EB0">
&s;aid he would give him a grand burial, in gratitude for the promi&s;ed trea&s;ure; and de&s;ired that all the things belonging to the decea&s;ed might be brought forth. Among others, there was a ne&s;t of trunks of which he had kept the keys whil&s;t the man was ill, and when they were produced we opened them with no &s;mall eagerne&s;s and expectation; and as there were a great number with|in one another, with much impatience we took them one out of the other. At la&s;t, when we came to the &s;malle&s;t, and had opened it, we &s;aw it was full of papers, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be notes; at the &s;ight of which our hearts leapt for joy; and that in&s;tant the Captain, clapping his hands, cried out, <Q>Thank God, here it is.</Q> But when we took up the trunk, and began to examine the &s;uppo&s;ed trea&s;ure and long-looked for bounty, (alas! alas! how uncer|tain and deceitful are all human af|fairs!) what had we found? while we thought we were embracing a &s;ub&s;tance we gra&s;ped an empty nothing. The whole amount that was in the ne&s;t of trunks, was only one dollar and a half; and all that the man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed would not pay for his coffin. Our &s;udden and exqui&s;ite joy was now &s;ucceeded by as
<PB N="9" REF="023353_0213_0FBF4809C5B019B8">
&s;udden and exqui&s;ite pain; and my Captain and I exhibited, for &s;ome time mo&s;t ridiculous figures&mdash;pictures of chagrin and di&s;appointment! We went away greatly mortified, and left the decea&s;ed to do as well as he could for him&s;elf, as we had taken &s;o good care of him when alive for nothing. We &s;et &s;ail once more for Mont&s;errat, and arrived there &s;afe; but much out of humour with our friend the &s;ilver&s;mith. When we had unladen the ve&s;&s;el, and I had &s;old my venture, finding my&s;elf ma&s;ter of about forty-&s;even pounds&mdash;I con&s;ulted my true friend, the Captain, how I &s;hould proceed in offering my ma&s;ter the money for my freedom. He told me to come on a certain morning, when he and my ma&s;ter would be at breakfa&s;t together. Accordingly, on that morning I went, and met the Captain there, as he had appointed. When I went in I made my obei&s;ance to my ma&s;ter, and with my money in my hand, and many fears in my heart, I prayed him to be as good as his offer to me, when he was plea&s;ed to promi&s;e me my freedom as &s;oon as I could pur|cha&s;e it. This &s;peech &s;eemed to con|found him; he began to recoil; and my heart that in&s;tant &s;unk within me.
<PB N="10" REF="023353_0214_0FBF480C5E6FA810">
<Q>What, &s;aid he, give you your freedom? Why, where did you get the money? Have you got forty pounds &s;terling? Yes, &s;ir, I an|&s;wered. How did you get it?</Q> re|plied he. I told him, very hone&s;tly. The Captain then &s;aid he knew I got the money very hone&s;tly and with much indu&s;try, and that I was particularly careful. On which my ma&s;ter repli|ed, I got money much fa&s;ter than he did; and &s;aid he would not have made me the promi&s;e he did if he had thought I &s;hould have got money &s;o &s;oon. "Come, come," &s;aid my worthy cap|tain, clapping my ma&s;ter on the back, <Q>Come, Robert, (which was his name) I think you mu&s;t let him have his freedom;&mdash;you have laid your mo|ney out very well; you have receiv|ved good intere&s;t for it all this time, and here is now the principal at la&s;t. I know Gu&s;tavas has earned you more than an hundred a-year, and he will &s;till &s;ave you money, as he will not leave you:&mdash;Come, Robert, take the money.</Q> My ma&s;ter then &s;aid he would not be wor&s;e than his promi&s;e; and, taking the money, told me to go to the Secretary at the Regi&s;ter Office, and get my manumi&s;&s;ion drawn up. The&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="023353_0215_0FBF480D81CFA368">
words of my ma&s;ter were like a voice from heaven to me: in an in&s;tant all my trepidation was turned into unut|terable bli&s;s; and I mo&s;t reverently bowed my&s;elf with gratitude, unable to expre&s;s my feelings, but by the over|flowing of my eyes, and a heart replete with thanks to God; while my true and worthy friend the Captain, congratu|lated us both with a peculiar degree of heart-felt plea&s;ure. As &s;oon as the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of my joy were over, and that I had expre&s;&s;ed my thanks to the&s;e my worthy friends in the be&s;t manner I was able, I ro&s;e with a heart full of affec|tion and reverence, and left the room, in order to obey my ma&s;ter's joyful mandate of going to the Regi&s;ter Of|fice. As I was leaving the hou&s;e I called to mind the words of the P&s;almi&s;t, in the 126th P&s;alm, and like him, <Q>I glorified God in my heart, in whom I tru&s;ted.</Q> The&s;e words had been im|pre&s;&s;ed on my mind from the very day I was forced from Deptford to the pre|&s;ent hour, and I now &s;aw them, as I thought, fulfilled and verified. My imagination was all rapture as I flew to the Regi&s;ter Office; and, in this re&s;pect, like the apo&s;tle Peter,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xii. 9.</NOTE> (who&s;e deliver|ance

<P>WHEN I got to the office and acquaint|ed the Regi&s;ter with my errand, he congratulated me on the occa&s;ion, and told me he would draw up my manu|mi&s;&s;ion for half price, which was a guinea.

appearance as I thought. Some of the &s;able females, who formerly &s;tood aloof, now began to relax and appear le&s;s coy; but my heart was &s;till fixed on London, where I hoped to be ere long. So that my worthy captain and his owner my late ma&s;ter, finding that the bent of my mind was towards London, &s;aid to me, <Q>We hope you won't leave us, but that you will &s;till be with the ve&s;&s;els.</Q> Here gratitude bowed me down; and none but the generous mind can judge of my feelings, &s;truggling between in|clination and duty.

what the Lord had done for me in &s;o &s;hort a time, in&s;tead of being, as he might perhaps &s;uppo&s;e, under the cruel yoke of &s;ome planter. With the&s;e kind of reveries I u&s;ed often to entertain my|&s;elf, and &s;horten the time till my return; and now, being as in my original free African &s;tate, I embarked on board the Nancy, after having got all things ready for our voyage. In this &s;tate of &s;erenity we &s;ailed for St. Eu&s;tatia; and having &s;mooth &s;eas and calm weather, we &s;oon arrived there: after taking our cargo on board, we proceeded to Sa|vannah in Georgia, in Augu&s;t, 1766. While we were there, as u&s;ual, I u&s;ed to go for the cargo up the rivers in boats; and on this bu&s;ine&s;s have been fre|quently be&s;et by Alligators, which were very numerous on that coa&s;t; and &s;hot many of them when they have been near getting into our boats; which we have with great difficulty &s;ometimes prevented, and have been very much frightened at them.

<P>DURING our &s;tay at this place, one evening a &s;lave beloning to Mr. Read, a merchant of Savannah, came near our ve&s;&s;el, and began to u&s;e me very ill. I

entreated him, with all the patience&punc; It was ma&s;ter of, to de&s;i&s;t, as I knew there was little or no law for a free negro here; but the fellow, in&s;tead of taking my advice, per&s;evered in his in&s;ults, and even &s;truck me. At this I lo&s;t all temper, and fell on him and beat him &s;oundly. The next morning his ma&s;ter came to our ve&s;&s;el as we lay along&s;ide the wharf, and de&s;ired me to come a|&s;hore that he might have me flogged all round the town, for beating his ne|gro &s;lave. I told him he had in&s;ulted me, and had given the provocation, by fir&s;t &s;triking me. I had told my cap|tain al&s;o the whole affair that morning, and wi&s;hed him to have gone along with me to Mr. Read, to prevent bad con&s;equences; but he &s;aid that it did not &s;ignify, and if Mr. Read &s;aid any thing he would make matters up, and de&s;ired me to go to work, which I accordingly did The Captain be|ing on board when Mr. Read came and applied to him to deliver me up, he &s;aid he knew nothing of the matter, I was a free man. I was a&s;toni&s;hed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rightened at this, and thought I had better keep were I was than go a&s;hore and be flogged round the town, with|out judge or jury. I therefore refu&s;ed

to &s;tir; and Mr. Read went away, &s;wearing he would bring all the con|&s;tables in the town, for he would have me out of the ve&s;&s;el. When he was gone, I thought his threat might prove too true to my &s;orrow; and I was con|firmed in this belief, as well by the many in&s;tances I had &s;een of the treat|ment of free negroes, as from a fact that had happened within my own knowledge here a &s;hort time before.</P>
<P>THERE was a free black man, a car|penter, that I knew, who for a&s;king a gentleman that he worked for, for the money he had earned, was put into goal; and afterwards this oppre&s;&s;ed man was &s;ent from Georgia, with fal&s;e accu&s;ations, of an intention to &s;et the gentleman's hou&s;e on fire, and run away with his &s;laves. I was therefore much embarra&s;&s;ed, and very apprehen&s;ive of a flogging at lea&s;t. I dreaded, of all things, the thoughts of being &s;triped, as I never in my life had the marks of any violence of that kind. At that in|&s;tant a rage &s;eized my &s;oul, and for a little I determined to re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t man that &s;hould offer to lay violent hands on me, or ba&s;ely u&s;e me without a trial; for I would &s;ooner die like a free man, than &s;uffer my&s;elf to be &s;courged by the
<PB N="19" REF="023353_0223_0FBF482646D97E88">
hands of ruffians, and my blood drawn like a &s;lave. The captain and others, more cautious, advi&s;ed me to make ha&s;te and conceal my&s;elf; for the &s;aid Mr. Read was a very &s;piteful man, and he would &s;oon come on board with con|&s;tables and take me. At fir&s;t I refu&s;ed this coun&s;el, being determined to &s;tand my ground; but at length, by the prevailing entreaties of the Captain and Mr. Dixon, with whom he lodged, I went to Mr. Dixon's hou&s;e, which was a little out of town, at a place called <HI>Yea-ma-chra.</HI> I was but ju&s;t gone when Mr. Read, with the con&s;tables, came for me, and &s;earched the ve&s;&s;el; but, not finding me there, he &s;wore he would have me dead or alive. I was &s;ecreted about five days; however, the good character which my captain al|ways gave me as well as &s;ome other gentlemen who al&s;o knew me, procur|ed me &s;ome friends. At la&s;t &s;ome of them told my Captain that he did not u&s;e me well, in &s;uffering me thus to be impo&s;ed upon, and &s;aid they would &s;ee me redre&s;&s;ed, and get me on board &s;ome other ve&s;&s;el. My Captain, on this, immediately went to Mr. Read, and told him, that ever &s;ince I eloped from the ve&s;&s;el his work had been neg|lected,
<PB N="20" REF="023353_0224_0FBF4827B709D800">
and he could not go on with her loading, him&s;elf and mate not be|ing well; and, as I had managed things on board for them, my ab&s;ence mu&s;t retard his voyage, and con&s;equently hurt the owner; he therefore begged of him to forgive me, as he &s;aid he never heard any complaint of me be|fore, during the &s;everal years I had been with him. After repeated entrea|ties, Mr. Read &s;aid I might go to hell, and that he would not meddle with me; on which my Captain came im|mediately to me at his lodging, and telling me how plea&s;antly matters had gone on, de&s;ired me to go on board.</P>
<P>SOME of my other friends then a&s;ked him if he had got the con&s;table's war|rant from them; the Captain &s;aid, No. On this I was de&s;ired by them to &s;tay in the hou&s;e; and they &s;aid they would get me on board of &s;ome other ve&s;&s;el before the evening. When the Cap|tain heard this he became almo&s;t di&s;tracted. He went immediately for the warrant, and, after u&s;ing every exertion in his power, he at la&s;t got it from my hunters; but I had all the expences to pay.</P>
<P>AFTER I had thanked all my friends for their kindne&s;s, I went on board a|gain
<PB N="21" REF="023353_0225_0FBF482F69C35090">
to my work, of which I had al|ways plenty. We were in ha&s;te to complete our lading, and were to car|ry twenty head of cattle with us to the We&s;t-Indies, where they are a very profitable article. In order to encou|rage me in working, and to make up for the time I had lo&s;t, my Captain promi&s;ed me the privilege of carrying two bullocks of my own with me; and this made me work with redoubled ar|dour. As &s;oon as I had got the ve&s;&s;el loaded, in doing which I was obliged to perform the duty of the mate as well as my own work, and that the bullocks were near coming on board, I a&s;ked the Captain leave to bring my two, according to his promi&s;e; but to my great &s;urpri&s;e, he told me there was no room for them. I then a&s;ked him to permit me to take one; but he &s;aid he could not. I was a good deal mortified at this u&s;age, and told him I had no notion that he intended thus to impo&s;e on me; nor could I think well of any man that was &s;o much wor&s;e than his word. On this we had &s;ome di&s;agreement, and I gave him to un|der&s;tand, that I intended to leave the ve&s;&s;el. At this he appeared to be very much dejected; and our mate who
<PB N="22" REF="023353_0226_0FBF48324F340B48">
had been very &s;ickly, and who&s;e duty had long devolved upon me, advi&s;ed him to per&s;uade me to &s;tay: in con&s;e|quence of which he &s;poke very kindly to me, making many fair promi&s;es, telling me, that, as the mate was &s;o &s;ickly, he could not do without me; and that, as the &s;afety of the ve&s;&s;el and cargo depended greatly upon me, he therefore hoped that I would not be offended at what had pa&s;&s;ed between us, and &s;wore he would make up all matters when we arrived in the We&s;t-Indies; &s;o I con&s;ented to &s;lave on as before. Soon after this, as the bullocks were coming on board, one of them ran at the Captain, and butted him &s;o furiou&s;ly in the brea&s;t, that he never recovered of the blow. In order to make me &s;ome amends for his treatment about the bullocks, the Captain now pre&s;&s;ed me very much to take &s;ome turkeys, and other fowls with me, and gave me liberty to take as many as I could find room for: but I told him he knew very well I had never carried any turkeys before, as I always thought they were &s;uch tender birds that they were not fit to cro&s;s the &s;eas. However, he continued to pre&s;s me to buy them for once; and what
<PB N="23" REF="023353_0227_0FBF4833C28C6B88">
&s;eemed very &s;urpri&s;ing to me, the more I was agai&s;t it, the more he urged my taking them, in&s;omuch that he en&s;ured me from all lo&s;&s;es that might happen by them, and I was prevailed on to take them; but I thought this very &s;trange, as he had never acted &s;o with me be|fore. This, and not being able to di&s;|po&s;e of my paper-money any other way, induced me at length to take four dozen. The turkeys, however, I was &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied about that I determined to make no more voyages to this quar|ter, nor with this captain; and was very apprehen&s;ive that my free voyage would be the wor&s;t I had ever made.</P>
<P>WE &s;et &s;ail for Mont&s;errat. The cap|tain and mate had been both complain|ing of &s;ickne&s;s when we &s;ailed, and as we proceeded on our voyage they grew wor&s;e. This was about November, and we had not been long at &s;ea before we began to meet with &s;trong notherly gales and rough &s;eas; and in about &s;even or eight days all the bullocks were near being drowned, and four or five of them died. Our ve&s;&s;el, which had not been tight at fir&s;t, was much le&s;s &s;o now: and, though we were but nine in the whole, including five &s;ailors and my&s;elf, yet we were obliged to at|tend
<PB N="24" REF="023353_0228_0FBF4835389E1078">
to the pumps every half or three quarters of an hour. The captain and mate came on deck as often as they were able, which was now but &s;eldom; for they declined &s;o fa&s;t, that they were not well enough to make ob&s;ervations above four or five times the whole voyage. The whole care of the ve&s;&s;el re&s;ted, therefore upon me, and I was obliged to direct her by mere dint of rea&s;on, not being able to work a traver&s;e. The captain was now very &s;orry he had not taught me navigation, and prote&s;ted, if ever he &s;hould get well again, he would not fail to do &s;o; but in about &s;even|teen days his illne&s;s increa&s;ed &s;o much, that he was obliged to keep his bed, continuing &s;en&s;ible, however, till the la&s;t, con&s;tantly having the owner's in|tere&s;t at heart; for this ju&s;t and bene|volent man ever appeared much con|cerned about the welfare of what he was intru&s;ted with. When this dear friend found the &s;ymtoms of death ap|proaching, he called me by my name; and, when I came to him, he a&s;ked (with almo&s;t his la&s;t breath) if he had ever done me any harm? <Q>God forbid I &s;hould think &s;o, replied I, I &s;hould then be the mo&s;t ungrateful of wretch|es to the be&s;t of benefactors.</Q> While I
<PB N="25" REF="023353_0229_0FBF483D42211310">
was thus expre&s;&s;ing my affection and &s;or|row by his bed&s;ide, he expired without &s;aying another word; and the day fol|lowing we committed his body to the deep. Every man on board loved him, and regretted his death; but I was ex|ceedingly affected at it, and found that I did not know, till he was gone, the &s;trength of my regard for him. Indeed I had every rea&s;on in the world to be attached to him; for, be&s;ides that he was in general mild, affable, generous, faithful, benevolent, and ju&s;t, he was to me a friend and father; and had it plea&s;ed Providence, that he had died about five months before, I verily be|lieve I &s;hould not have obtained my freedom when I did; and it is not im|probable that I might not have been a|ble to get it at any rate afterwards.</P>
<P>THE captain being dead, the mate came on the deck, and made &s;uch ob|&s;ervations as he was able, but to no purpo&s;e. In the cour&s;e of a few days more, the few bullocks that remained were found dead; but the turkies I had, though on the deck, and expo&s;ed to &s;o much wet and bad weather, did well, and I afterwards gained near three hun|dred per cent, on the &s;ale of them; &s;o that in the event it proved a happy
<PB N="26" REF="023353_0230_0FBF483E6115BA00">
circum&s;tance for me that I had not bought the bullocks I intended, for they mu&s;t have peri&s;hed with the re&s;t; and I could not help looking on this, otherwi&s;e trifling circum&s;tance, as a particular providence of God, and was thankful accordingly. The care of the ve&s;&s;el took up all my time, and en|gaged my attention entirely. As we were now out of the variable winds, I thought I &s;hould not be much puzzled to hit upon the i&s;lands. I was per&s;uaded I &s;teered right for Antigua, which I wi&s;h|ed to reach, as the neare&s;t to us; and in the cour&s;e of nine or ten days we made this i&s;land, to our great joy; and the day after we came &s;afe to Mont&s;errat.</P>
<P>MANY were &s;urpri&s;ed when they heard of my conducting the &s;loop into the port, and I now obtained a new ap|pelation, and was called Captain. This elated me not a little, and it was quite flattering to my vanity to be thus &s;tyled by as high a title as any freeman in this place po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. When the death of the captain became known, he was much regretted by all who knew him; for he was a man univer&s;ally re&s;pected. At the &s;ame time the &s;able Captain lo&s;t no fame; for the &s;ucce&s;s I had met with increa&s;ed the affection of my friends in no &s;mall mea&s;ure.</P>

<P>AS I had now, by the death of my captain, lo&s;t my great benefactor
<PB N="28" REF="023353_0232_0FBF484152669A10">
and friend, I had little inducement to remain longer in the We&s;t Indies, ex|cept my gratitude to Mr. King, which I thought I had pretty well di&s;charged in bringing back his ve&s;&s;el &s;afe, and delivering his cargo to his &s;atisfaction. I began to think of leaving this part of the world, of which I had been long tired, and returning to England, where my heart had always been; but Mr. King &s;till pre&s;&s;ed me very much to &s;tay with his ve&s;&s;el; and he had done &s;o much for me that I found my&s;elf unable to refu&s;e his reque&s;ts, and con|&s;ented to go another voyage to Georgia, as the mate, from his ill &s;tate of health, was quite u&s;ele&s;s in the ve&s;&s;el. Accord|ingly a new captain was appointed, who&s;e name was William Phillips, an old acquaintance of mine; and, having refitted our ve&s;&s;el, and taken &s;everal &s;laves on board, we &s;et &s;ail for St. Eu&s;tatia, where we &s;tayed but a few days: and on the 30th of January 1767, we &s;teered for Georgia. Our new cap|tain boa&s;ted &s;trangely of his &s;kill in navigation and conducting a ve&s;&s;el; and in con&s;equence of this he &s;teered a new cour&s;e, &s;everal points more to the we&s;tward than we ever did before; this appeared to me very extraordinary.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="023353_0233_0FBF4844F68F7010">
ON the fourth of February, which was &s;oon after we had got into our new cour&s;e, I dreamt the &s;hip was wrecked amid&s;t the &s;urfs and rocks, and that I was the means of &s;aving every one on board; and on the night following I dreamed the very &s;ame dream. The&s;e dreams however made no impre&s;&s;ion on my mind; and the next evening, it be|ing my watch below, I was pumping the ve&s;&s;el a little after eight o'clock, ju&s;t before I went off the deck, as is the cu&s;tom; and being weary with the duty of the day, and tired at the pump, (for we made a good deal of water) I began to expre&s;s my impatience, and uttered with an oath, <Q>Damn the ve&s;&s;el's bottom out.</Q> But my con|&s;cience in&s;tantly &s;mote me for the ex|pre&s;&s;ion. When I left the deck I went to bed, and had &s;carcely fallen a&s;leep when I dreamed the &s;ame dream again about the &s;hip as I had dreamt the two preceeding nights. At twelve o'clock the watch was changed; and, as I had always the charge of the captain's watch, I then went upon deck. At half after one in the morning the man at the helm &s;aw &s;omething under the lee-beam that the &s;ea wa&s;hed again&s;t, and he immediately called to me that
<PB N="30" REF="023353_0234_0FBF4849CDC42B80">
there was a grampus, and de&s;ired me to look at it. Accordingly I &s;tood up and ob&s;erved it for &s;ome time; but, when I &s;aw the &s;ea wa&s;h up again&s;t it again and again, I &s;aid it was not a fi&s;h but a rock. Being &s;oon certain of this, I went down to the Captain, and, with &s;ome confu&s;ion, told him the danger we were in, and de&s;ired him to come upon deck immediately. He &s;aid it was very well, and I went up again. As &s;oon as I was upon deck, the wind, which had been pretty high, having abated a little, the ve&s;&s;el began to be carried &s;ide ways towards the rock, by means of the current. Still the captain did not appear. I therefore went to him again, and told him the ve&s;&s;el was then near a large rock, and de&s;ired he would come up with all &s;peed. He &s;aid he would, and I returned to the deck. When I was upon the deck again I &s;aw we were not above a pi&s;tol &s;hot from the rock, and I heard the noi&s;e of the breakers all around us. I was exceedingly alarmed at this; and the captain having not yet come on the deck I lo&s;t all patience; and, growing quite enraged, I ran down to him again, and a&s;ked him why he did not come up, and what he could mean by all this?
<PB N="31" REF="023353_0235_0FBF484CC00E7338">
<Q>The breakers, &s;aid I are round us, and the ve&s;&s;el is almo&s;t on the rock.</Q> With that he came on the deck with me, and we tried to put the ve&s;&s;el about, and get her out of the current, but all to no purpo&s;e, the wind being very &s;mall. We then called all hands up immediately; and after a little we got up one end of a cable, and fa&s;t|ened it to the anchor. By this time the &s;urf was foamed round us, and made a dreadful noi&s;e on the breakers, and the very moment we let the an|chor go the ve&s;&s;el &s;truck again&s;t the rocks. One &s;well now &s;ucceeded an|other, as it were one wave calling on its fellow; the roaring of the billows increa&s;ed, and, with one &s;ingle heave of the &s;wells, the &s;loop was pierced and transfixed among the rocks! in a mo|ment a &s;cene of horror pre&s;ented it&s;elf to my mind, &s;uch as I never had con|ceived or experienced before. All my &s;ins &s;tared me in the face; and e&s;pe|cially, I thought that God had hurled his direful vengeance on my guilty head for cur&s;ing the ve&s;&s;el on which my life depended. My &s;pirits at this for&s;ook me, and I expected every mo|ment to go to the bottom: I deter|mined if I &s;hould &s;till be &s;aved that I
<PB N="32" REF="023353_0236_0FBF484E07F54AE0">
would never &s;wear again. And in the mid&s;t of my di&s;tre&s;s, while the dreadful &s;urfs were da&s;hing with unremitting fu|ry among the rocks, I remembered the Lord, though fearful that I was unde|&s;erving of forgivne&s;s, and I thought that as he had often delivered he might yet deliver; and, calling to mind the many mercies he had &s;hewn me in times pa&s;t, they gave me &s;ome &s;mall hope that he might &s;till help me. I then began to think how we might be &s;aved; and I believe no mind was ever like mine &s;o replete with inventions and confu&s;ed with &s;chemes, though how to e&s;cape death I knew not. The captain immediately ordered the hatch|es to be nailed down on the &s;laves in the hold, where there were about twenty, all of whom mu&s;t unadvoidably have pe|ri&s;hed if he had been obeyed. When he de&s;ired the man to nail down the hatches I thought that my &s;in was the cau&s;e of this, and that God would charge me with the&s;e people's blood. This thought ru&s;hed upon my mind that in&s;tant with &s;uch violence, that it quite overpowered me, and I fainted. I recovered ju&s;t as the people were about to nail down the hatches; per|ceiving which, I de&s;ired them to &s;top.
<PB N="33" REF="023353_0237_0FBF484F80C622A8">
The captain then &s;aid it mu&s;t be done: I a&s;ked him why? He &s;aid that every one would endeavour to get into the boat, which was but &s;mall, and thereby we &s;hould be drowned; for it would not have carried above ten at the mo&s;t. I could no longer re&s;train my emotion and I told him he de&s;erved drowning for not knowing how to navigate the ve&s;&s;el; and I believe the people would have to&s;&s;ed him overboard if I had given them the lea&s;t hint of it. How|ever the hatches were not nailed down; and, as none of us could leave the ve&s;&s;el then on account of the darkne&s;s, and as we knew not where to go, and were convinced be&s;ides that the boat could not &s;urvive the &s;urfs, we all &s;aid we would remain on the dry part of the ve&s;&s;el, and tru&s;t to God till day|light appeared, when we &s;hould know better what to do.</P>
<P>I then advi&s;ed to get the boat pre|pared again&s;t morning, and &s;ome of us began to &s;et about it; but others aban|doned all care of the &s;hip and them|&s;elves, and fell to drinking. Our boat had a piece out of her bottom near two feet long, and we had no mate|rials to mend her; however, nece&s;&s;ity being the mother of invention, I took
<PB N="34" REF="023353_0238_0FBF48564A2179B0">
&s;ome pump leather and nailed it to the broken part, and pla&s;tered it over with tallow-grea&s;e. And, thus prepar|ed, with the utmo&s;t anxiety of mind we watched for day-light, and thought every minute an hour till it appeared. At la&s;t it &s;aluted our longing eyes, and kind Providence accompanied its ap|proach with what was no &s;mall com|fort to us; for the dreadful &s;wells be|gan to &s;ub&s;ide; and the next thing that we di&s;covered to rai&s;e our droop|ing &s;pirits, was a &s;mall key or de&s;olate i&s;land, about five or &s;ix miles off; but a barrier &s;oon pre&s;ented it&s;elf; for there was not water enough for our boat to go over the reefs, and this threw us again into a &s;ad con&s;ternation; but there was no alternative, we were therefore obliged to put but few in the boat at once; and, what was &s;till wor&s;e, all of us were frequently under the nece&s;&s;ity of getting out to drag and lift it over the reefs. This co&s;t us much labour and fatigue; and, what was yet more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, we could not a|void having our legs cut and torn very much with the rocks. There were only four people that would work with me at the oars; and they con&s;i&s;ted of three black men and a Dutch creole
<PB N="35" REF="023353_0239_0FBF4859393A2D50">
&s;ailor; and, though we went with the boat five times that day, we had no o|thers to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. But, had we not worked in this manner, I really believe the people could not have been &s;aved; for not one of the white men did any thing to pre&s;erve their lives; indeed they &s;oon got &s;o drunk that they were not able, but lay about the deck like &s;wine, &s;o that we were at la&s;t o|bliged to lift them into the boat, and carry them on &s;hore by force This want of a&s;&s;i&s;tance made our labour in|tolerably &s;evere; in&s;omuch, that, by going on &s;hore &s;o often that day, the &s;kin was partly &s;tript off my hands.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, we continued all the day to toil and &s;train our exertions, till we had brought all on board &s;afe to the &s;hore, &s;o that out of thirty-two people we lo&s;t not one.</P>
<P>MY dream now returned upon my mind with all its force; it was fulfil|led in every part; for our danger was the &s;ame I had dreamt of; and I could not help looking on my&s;elf as the prin|cipal in&s;trument in effecting our deli|verance; for, owing to &s;ome of our people getting drunk, the re&s;t of us were obliged to double our exertions; and it was fortunate we did, for in a
<PB N="36" REF="023353_0240_0FBF485B2756D4D0">
very little time longer the patch of lea|ther on the boat would have been worn out, and &s;he would have been no lon|ger fit for &s;ervice. Situated as we were, who could think that men &s;hould be &s;o carele&s;s of the danger they were in? for, if the wind had but rai&s;ed the &s;well as it was when the ve&s;&s;el &s;truck, we mu&s;t have bid a final fare|wel to all hopes of deliverances, and though, I warned the people who were drinking, and entreated them to embrace the moment of deliverance, neverthele&s;s they per&s;i&s;ted, as if not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the lea&s;t &s;park of rea&s;on. I could not help thinking, that, if a|ny of the&s;e people had been lo&s;t, God would charge me with their lives, which, perhaps, was one cau&s;e of my labouring &s;o hard for their pre&s;erva|tion, and indeed every one of them af|terwards &s;eemed &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the &s;er|vice I had rendered them, that while we were on the key I was a kind of chief|tian among&s;t them. I brought &s;ome limes, oranges, and lemons a&s;hore; and, finding it to be a good &s;oil where we were, I planted &s;everal of them as a token to any one that might be ca&s;t away hereafter. This key, as we afterwards found, was one of the Ba|hama

i&s;lands, which con&s;i&s;t of a clu&s;ter of large i&s;lands with &s;maller ones or keys, as they are called, inter&s;per&s;ed among them. It was about a mile in circumference, with a white &s;andy beach running in a regular order along it. On that part of it where we fir&s;t attempted to land there &s;tood &s;ome very large birds, called flamingoes: the&s;e, from the reflection of the &s;un, appeared to us at a little di&s;tance as large as men; and, when they walked backwards and forwards, we could not conceive what they were: our captain &s;wore they were cannibals. This created a great panic among us; and we held a con&s;ul|tation how to act. The captain wan|ted to go to a key that was within &s;ight, but a great way off; but I was again&s;t it, as in &s;o doing we &s;hould not be able to &s;ave all the people; 'And therefore,' &s;aid I, <Q>let us go on &s;hore here, and perhaps the&s;e cannibals may take to the water.</Q> Accordingly we &s;teer|ed towards them; and when we ap|proached them, to our very great joy and no le&s;s wonder, they walked off one after the other very deliberately; and at la&s;t they took flight and relieved us entirely from our fears. About the key there were turtles and &s;everel &s;orts

of fi&s;h in &s;uch abundance that we caught them without bait, which was a great relief to us after the &s;alt provi&s;ions on board. There was al&s;o a large rock on the beach, about ten feet high, which was in the form of a punch-bowl at the top; this we could not help thinking Providence had ordained to &s;upply us with rain water; and it was &s;omething &s;ingular that, if we did not take the wa|ter when it rained, in &s;ome little time after it would turn as &s;alt as &s;ea-water.</P>
<P>OUR fir&s;t care after refre&s;hment, was to make our&s;elves tents to lodge in&punc; which we did as well as we could with &s;ome &s;ails we had brought from the &s;hip. We then began to think how we might get from this place, which was quite uninhabited; and we deter|mined to repair our boat, which was very much &s;hattered, and to put to &s;ea in que&s;t of a &s;hip or &s;ome inhabited i&s;land. It took us up however eleven days before we could get the boat ready for &s;ea in the manner we wanted it, with a &s;ail and other nece&s;&s;aries. When we had got all things prepared, the captain wanted me to &s;tay on &s;hore while he went to &s;ea in que&s;t of a ve&s;|&s;el to take all the people off the key; but this I refu&s;ed; and the captain and

my&s;elf, with five more, &s;et off in the boat towards New Providence. We had no more than two mu&s;ket load of gun-powder with us if any thing &s;hould happen; and our &s;tock of provi&s;ions con&s;i&s;ted of three gallons of rum, four of water, &s;ome &s;alt beef &s;ome bi&s;cuit; and in this manner we proceeded to &s;ea.</P>
<P>ON the &s;econd day of our voyage, we came to an i&s;land called Abbico, the large&s;t of the Bahama i&s;lands. We were much in want of water; for by this time our water was expended, and we were exceedingly fatigued in pulling two days in the heat of the &s;un; and it being late in the evening, we hauled the boat a&s;hore to try for water and remain during the night; when we came a&s;hore we &s;earched for water, but could find none. When it was dark, we made a fire around us for fear of the wild bea&s;ts, as the place was an entire thick wood, and we took it by turns to watch. In this &s;ituation we found very little re&s;t, and waited with impatience for the morning. As &s;oon as the light appeared we &s;et off again with our boat, in hopes of find|ing a&s;&s;i&s;tance during the day. We were now much dejected and weakened
<PB N="40" REF="023353_0244_0FBF48668CF87AF8">
by pulling the boat; for our &s;ail was of no u&s;e, and we were almo&s;t fami&s;hed for want of fre&s;h water to drink. We had nothing left to eat but &s;alt beef, and that we could not u&s;e without water. In this &s;ituation we toiled all day in &s;ight of the i&s;land, which was very long; in the evening, &s;eeing no relief, we made &s;hore again, and fa&s;tened our boat. We then went to look for fre&s;h water, being quite faint for the want of it; and we dug and &s;earched about for &s;ome all the remainder of the even|ing, but could not find one drop, &s;o that our dejection at this period became exce&s;&s;ive, and our terror &s;o great, that we expected nothing but death, to de|liver us. We could not touch our beef, which was &s;alt as brine, with|out fre&s;h water; and we were in the greate&s;t terror from the apprehen&s;ion of wild bea&s;ts. When unwelcome night came we acted as on the night before; and the next morning we &s;et off again from the i&s;land in hopes of &s;eeing &s;ome ve&s;&s;el. In this manner we toiled as well as we were able till four o'clock, during which we pa&s;&s;ed &s;eve|ral keys, but could not meet with a &s;hip; and, &s;till fami&s;hing with thir&s;t, went a&s;hore on one of tho&s;e keys again
<PB N="41" REF="023353_0245_0FBF48677B1409E8">
in hopes of finding &s;ome water. Here we found &s;ome leaves with a few drops of water in them, which we lapped with much eagerne&s;s; we then dug in &s;everal places, but without &s;ucce&s;s. As we were digging holes in &s;earch of water there can forth &s;ome very thick and black &s;tuff, but none of us could, touch it, except the poor Dutch Cre|ole, who drank above a quart of it as eagerly as if it had been wine. We tried to catch fi&s;h, but could not: and we now began to repine at our fate, and abandon our&s;elves to de&s;pair; when in the mid&s;t of our murmuring, the captain all at once cried out <Q>A &s;ail! a &s;ail! a &s;ail!</Q> This gladdening &s;ound was like a reprieve to a convict, and we all in&s;tantly returned to look at it; but in a little time &s;ome of us began to be afraid it was not a &s;ail. However, at a venture, we embarked and &s;teered after it; and, in half an hour to our un&s;peakable joy, we plainly &s;aw that it was a ve&s;&s;el. At this our drooping &s;pirits revived, and we made towards her with all the &s;peed imaginable. When we came near to her, we found &s;he was a little &s;loop, about the &s;ize of a Grave&s;end hoy, and quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ull of peo|ple; a circum&s;tance which we could;
<PB N="42" REF="023353_0246_0FBF43FBCECD3710">
not make out the meaning of. Our captain, who was a Wel&s;hman, &s;wore that they were pirates, and would kill us. I &s;aid, be that as it might, we mu&s;t board her if we were to die by it; and if they &s;hould not receive us kindly, we mu&s;t oppo&s;e them as well as we could; for there was no alternative between their peri&s;hing and ours. This coun|&s;el was immediately taken; and I real|ly believe that the Captain, my&s;elf, and the Dutchman, would then have faced twenty men. We had two cut|la&s;&s;es and a mu&s;ket, that I brought in the boat; and in this &s;ituation, we rowed along&s;ide, and immediately boarded her. I believe there were a|bout forty hands on board; but how great was our &s;urpri&s;e, as &s;oon as we got on board, to find that the major part of them were in the &s;ame predica|ment as our&s;elves.</P>
<P>THEY belonged to a whaling &s;choo|ner that was wrecked two days before us about nine miles to the north of our ve&s;&s;el. When &s;he was wrecked &s;ome of them had taken to their boats and had left &s;ome of their people and pro|perty on a key, in the &s;ame manner as we had done; and were going like us to New-Providence in que&s;t of a &s;hip,
<PB N="43" REF="023353_0247_0FBF43FD45736A90">
when they met with this little &s;loop, called a wrecker; their employment in tho&s;e &s;eas being to look after wrecks. They were then going to take the re|mainder of the people belonging to the &s;chooner; for which the wrecker was to have all things belonging to the ve&s;&s;el, and likewi&s;e their people's help to get what they could out of her, and were then to carry the crew to New-Providence.</P>
<P>WE told the people of the wrecker the condition of our ve&s;&s;el, and we made the &s;ame agreement with them as the &s;chooner's people; and, on their complying, we begged of them to go to our key directly, becau&s;e our peo|ple were in want of water. They a|greed, therefore, to go along with us fir&s;t; and in two days we arrived at the key, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of the people that we had left behind, as they had been reduced to great extremities for want of water in our ab&s;ence. Luckily for us, the wrecker had now more people on board than &s;he could carry or victual for any moderate length of time; they therefore hired the &s;chooner's people to work on the wreck, and we left them our boat, and embarked for New-Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="023353_0248_0FBF43FF86658AF0">
NOTHING could have been more for|tunate than our meeting with this wrecker, for New-Providence was at &s;uch a di&s;tance that we never could have reached it in our boat. The i&s;l|and of Abbico was much longer than we expected; and it was not till after &s;ailing for three or four days that we got &s;afe to the farther end of it, to|wards New-Providence. When we arrived there we watered, and got a good many lob&s;ters and other &s;hell-fi&s;h; which proved a great relief to us, as our provi&s;ions and water were almo&s;t exhau&s;ted. We then proceeded on our voyage; but the day after we left the I&s;land, late in the evening, and whil&s;t we were yet among&s;t the Bahama keys, we were overtaken by a violent gale of wind, &s;o that we were obliged to cut away the ma&s;t. The ve&s;&s;el was very near foundering; for &s;he parted from her anchors, and &s;truck &s;everal times on the &s;hoals. Here we expected every minute that &s;he would have gone to pieces, and each moment to be our la&s;t; &s;o much &s;o, that my old captain and &s;ickly u&s;ele&s;s mate, and &s;everal o|thers, fainted; and death &s;tared us in the face on every &s;ide. All the &s;wearers on board now began to call on the
<PB N="45" REF="023353_0249_0FBF44010F69E088">
God of Heaven to a&s;&s;i&s;t them: and, &s;ure enough, beyond our comprehen|&s;ion he did a&s;&s;i&s;t us, and in a miracu|lous manner delivered us! In the very height of our extremity the wind lul|led for a few minutes; and, although the &s;well was high beyond expre&s;&s;ion, two men, who were expert &s;wimmers, attempted to go to the buoy of the an|chor, which we &s;till &s;aw on the water, at &s;ome di&s;tance, in a little punt that belonged to the wrecker, which was not large enough to carry more than two. She filled at different times in their endeavours to get into her along&s;ide of our ve&s;&s;el; and they &s;aw nothing but death before them, as well as we; but they &s;aid they might as well die that way as any other. A coil of very &s;mall rope, with a little buoy, was put in along with them; and, at la&s;t, with great hazard, they got the punt clear from the ve&s;&s;el; and the&s;e two intre|pid water heroes paddled away for life towards the buoy of the anchor. Our eyes were fixed on them all the time, expecting every minute to be their la&s;t: and the prayers of all tho&s;e that remained in their &s;en&s;es were of|fered up to God, on their behalf, for a &s;peedy deliverance, and for our own,
<PB N="46" REF="023353_0250_0FBF440746064C20">
which depended on them; and he heard and an&s;wered us! The&s;e two men at la&s;t reached the buoy; and, having fa&s;tened the punt to it, they tied one end of their rope to the &s;mall buoy that they had in the punt, and &s;ent it adrift towards the ve&s;&s;el. We on board ob&s;erving this threw out boat-hooks an leads fa&s;tened to lines, in order to catch the buoy: at la&s;t we caught it, and fa&s;tened a haw&s;er to the end of the &s;mall rope; we then gave them a &s;ign to pull, and they pulled the haw&s;er to them, and fa&s;tened it to the buoy: which being done we hauled for our lives; and, through the mercy of God, we got again from the &s;hoals into deep water, and the punt got &s;afe to the ve&s;&s;el. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any to conceive our heart-felt joy at this &s;econd deliverance from ruin, but tho&s;e who have &s;uffered the &s;ame hard&s;hips. Tho&s;e who&s;e &s;trength and &s;en&s;es were gone, came to them&s;elves, and were now as elated as they were before depre&s;&s;ed. Two days after this the wind cea&s;ed, and the water became &s;mooth. The punt then went on &s;hore, and we cut down &s;ome trees; and having found our ma&s;t and mended it we brought it on board, and fixed it up. As &s;oon as we had
<PB N="47" REF="023353_0251_0FBF440974FC6848">
done this we got up the anchor, and away we went once more for New Providence, which in three days more we reached &s;afe, after having been above three weeks in a &s;ituation in which we did not expect to e&s;cape with life. The inhabitants here were very kind to us; and, when they learned our &s;ituation, &s;hewed us a great deal of ho&s;pitality and friend&s;hip. Soon after this every one of my old fellow-&s;uf|ferers that were free parted from us, and &s;haped their cour&s;e where their inclination led them. One merchant, who had a large &s;loop, &s;eeing our con|dition, and knowing we wanted to go to Georgia, told four of us that his ve&s;&s;el was going there; and&punc; if we would work on board and load her, he would give us our pa&s;&s;age free. As we could not get any wages whatever, and found it very hard to get off the place, we were obliged to con&s;ent to his propo&s;al; and we went on board and helped to load the &s;loop, though we had only our victuals allowed us. When &s;he was entirely loaded, he told us &s;he was going to Jamaica fir&s;t, where we mu&s;t go if we went in her. This, however, I refu&s;ed; but my fellow-&s;uffers not having any money

to help them&s;elves with, nece&s;&s;ity obli|ged them to accept of the offer, and to &s;teer that cour&s;e, though they did not like it.</P>
<P>WE &s;tayed in New Providence about &s;eventeen or eighteen days; during which time I met with many friends, who gave me encouragement to &s;tay there with them, but I declined it; though, had not my heart been fixed on England, I &s;hould have &s;tayed, as I liked the place extremely, and there were &s;ome free black people here who were very happy, and we pa&s;ted our time plea&s;antly together, with the me|lodious &s;ound of the catguts, under the lime and lemon trees. At length Captain Phillips hired a &s;loop to carry him and &s;ome of the &s;laves that he could not &s;ell to Georgia; and I agreed to go with him in this ve&s;&s;el, meaning now to take my farewel of that place. When the ve&s;&s;el was ready we all em|barked; and I took my leave of New Providence, not without regret. We &s;ailed about four o'clock the morn|ing with a fair wind, for Georgia; and about eleven o'clock the &s;ame morn|ing, a &s;udden and &s;hort gale &s;prung up and blew away mo&s;t of our &s;ails; and, as we were &s;till among the keys, in
<PB N="49" REF="023353_0253_0FBF440C4035D540">
a very few minutes it da&s;hed the &s;loop again&s;t the rocks. Luckily for us the water was deep; and the &s;ea was not &s;o angry, but that, after having for &s;ome time laboured hard, and being many in number, we were &s;aved, through God's mercy; and, by u&s;ing our greate&s;t exertions, we got the ve&s;|&s;el off. The next day we returned to Providence, where we &s;oon got her again refitted. Some of the people &s;wore that we had &s;pells &s;et upon us by &s;omebody in Mont&s;errat; and others that we had witches and wizzards among&s;t the poor helple&s;s &s;laves; and that we never &s;hould arrive &s;afe at Georgia. But the&s;e things did not de|ter me; I &s;aid, <Q>Let us again face the winds and &s;eas, and &s;wear not, but tru&s;t to God, and he will deliver us.</Q> We therefore once more &s;et &s;ail; and with hard labour in &s;even days time, arrived &s;afe at Georgia.</P>
<P>AFTER our arrival we went up to the town of Savannah; and the &s;ame even|ing I went to a friend's hou&s;e to lodge, who&s;e name was Mo&s;a, a black man. We were very happy at meeting each other; and after &s;upper we had a light till it was between nine and ten o'clock at night. About that time the watch
<PB N="50" REF="023353_0254_0FBF4413C11E29D0">
or patrol came by; and, di&s;cerning a light in the hou&s;e, they knocked at the door: we opened it; and they came in and &s;at down and drank &s;ome punch with us; they al&s;o begged &s;ome limes of me, as they under&s;tood I had &s;ome, which I readily gave them. A little after this they told me I mu&s;t go to the watch-hou&s;e with them: this &s;urpri&s;ed me a good deal, after our kindne&s;s to them; and I a&s;ked them, Why &s;o? They &s;aid that all negroes who had a light in their hou&s;es after nine o'clock were to be taken into cu&s;tody, and either pay &s;ome dollars or be flogged. Some of tho&s;e people knew that I was a free man; but, as the man of the hou&s;e was not free, and had his ma&s;ter to protect him, they did not take the &s;ame liberty with him they did with me. I told them that I was a free man, and ju&s;t arrived from Providence; that we were not making any noi&s;e, and that I was not a &s;tranger in that place, but was very well known there: <Q>Be&s;ides, &s;aid I, what will you do with me?&mdash;'That you &s;hall &s;ee,</Q> re|plied they, <Q>but you mu&s;t go to the watch-hou&s;e with us.</Q> Now whether they meant to get money from me or not I was at a lo&s;s to know; but I
<PB N="51" REF="023353_0255_0FBF441545A121B0">
thought immediately of the oranges and limes at Santa Cruz: and &s;eeing that nothing would pacify them I went with them to the watch-hou&s;e, where I remained during the night. Early the next morning the&s;e impo&s;ing ruffians flogged a negro-man and woman that they had in the watch-hou&s;e, and then they told me that I mu&s;t be flogged too. I a&s;ked why? and if there was no law for free men? and told them if there was I would have it put in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orce again&s;t them. But this only exa&s;pera|ted them the more, and in&s;tantly &s;wore they would &s;erve me as Doctor Perkins had done; and were going to lay vio|lent hands on me; when one of them, more humane than the re&s;t, &s;aid that as I was a free man they could not ju&s;tify &s;tripping me by law. I then immedi|ately &s;ent for Doctor Brady, who was known to be an hone&s;t and worthy man; and on his coming to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance they let me go.</P>
<P>THIS was not the only di&s;agreeable incident I met with while I was in this place; for one day, while I was a little way out of the town of Savannah, I was be&s;et by two white men, who meant to play their u&s;ual tricks with me in the way of kidnapping. As &s;oon as
<PB N="52" REF="023353_0256_0FBF4416C2837690">
the&s;e men acco&s;ted me, one of them &s;aid to the other, <Q>This is the very fel|low we are looking for, that you lo&s;t:</Q> and the other &s;wore immediately that I was the identical per&s;on. On this they made up to me, and were about to handle me; but I told them to be &s;till and keep off; for I had &s;een tho&s;e kind of tricks played upon other free blacks, and they mu&s;t not think to &s;erve me &s;o. At this they pau&s;ed a little, and one &s;aid to the other&mdash;it will not do; and the other an&s;wered that I talked two good Engli&s;h. I replied, I be|lieved I did; and I had al&s;o with me a revengeful &s;tick equal to the occa&s;ion; and my mind was likewi&s;e good. Hap|pily however it was not u&s;ed; and, after we had talked together a little in this manner, the rogues left me.</P>
<P>I &s;tayed in Savannah &s;ome time, anxi|ou&s;ly trying to get to Mont&s;errat once more to &s;ee Mr. King, my old ma&s;ter, and then to take a final farewell of the American quarter of the globe. At la&s;t I met with a &s;loop called the Speed|well, Captain John Bunton, which be|longed to Grenada, and was bound to Martinico, a French i&s;land, with a cargo of rice, and I &s;hipped my&s;elf on board of her.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="023353_0257_0FBF44184C423EA0">
BEFORE I left Georgia, a black wo|man who had a child lying dead, being very tenacious of the church burial &s;er|vice, and not able to get any white per|&s;on to perform it, applied to me for that purpo&s;e. I told her I was no par&s;on; and be&s;ides, that the &s;ervice over the dead did not affect the &s;oul. This however did not &s;atisfy her; &s;he &s;till urged me very hard: I therefore com|plied with her earne&s;t entreaties, and at la&s;t con&s;ented to act the par&s;on for the fir&s;t time in my life. As &s;he was much re&s;pected, there was a great com|pany both of white and black people at the grave. I then accordingly a&s;|&s;umed my new vocation, and perform|ed the funeral ceremony to the &s;atis|faction of all pre&s;ent; after which I bade idieu to Georgia, and &s;ailed for Martinico.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I THUS took a final leave of Georgia; for the treatment I had received in it di&s;gu&s;ted me very much again&s;t the place; and when I left it and &s;ailed for Martinico I determined never more to revi&s;it it. My new captain conducted
<PB N="55" REF="023353_0259_0FBF441FF4AB1010">
his ve&s;&s;el &s;afer than my former one; and, after an agreeable voyage, we got &s;afe to our intended port. While I was on this i&s;land I went about a good deal, and found it very plea&s;ant: in parti|cular I admired the town of St. Pierre, which is the principal one in the i&s;land, and built more like an European town than any I had &s;een in the We&s;t Indies. In general al&s;o, &s;laves were better treated, had more holidays, and looked better than tho&s;e in the Engli&s;h i&s;lands. After we had done our bu|&s;ine&s;s here, I wanted my di&s;charge, which was nece&s;&s;ary; for it was then the month of May, and I wi&s;hed much to be at Mont&s;errat to bid farewel to Mr. King, and all my other friends there, in time to &s;ail for Old England in the July fleet. But, alas! I had put a great &s;tumbling block in my own way, by which I was near lo&s;ing my pa&s;&s;age that &s;ea&s;on to En|gland. I had lent my captain &s;ome money, which I now wanted to enable me to pro&s;ecute my intentions. This I told him; but when I applied for it, though I urged the nece&s;&s;ity of my occa&s;ion, I met with &s;o much &s;huffl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ng from him, that I began at la&s;t to be afraid of lo&s;ing my money, as I could
<PB N="56" REF="023353_0260_0FBF44228AAE3120">
not recover it by law; for I have already mentioned, that throughout the We&s;t Indies no black man's te&s;timony is admitted, on any occa&s;ion, again&s;t any white per&s;on whatever, and there|fore my own oath would have been of no u&s;e. I was obliged, therefore, to remain with him till he might be di&s;|po&s;ed to return it to me. Thus we &s;ailed from Martinico for the Grenades. I frequently pre&s;&s;ing the captain for my money to no purpo&s;e; and, to render my condition wor&s;e, when we got there, the captain and his owners quar|relled; &s;o that my &s;ituation became daily more irk&s;ome: for be&s;ides that we on board had little or no victuals allowed us, and I could not get my money nor wages, as I could then have gotten my pa&s;&s;age free to Mont&s;errat had I been able to accept it. The wor&s;t of all was, that it was growing late in July, and the &s;hips in the i&s;lands mu&s;t &s;ail by the 26th of that month. At la&s;t, however, with a great many en|treaties, I got my, money from the captain, and took the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el I could meet with for St, Eu&s;tatia. From thence I went in another to Ba&s;&s;eterre in St. Kitts, where I arrived on the 19th of July. On the 22d, having met with a
<PB N="57" REF="023353_0261_0FBF4423E36927B0">
ve&s;&s;el bound to Mont&s;errat, I wanted to go in her; but the captain and others would not take me on board until I &s;hould adverti&s;e my&s;elf, and give notice of my going off the i&s;land. I told them of my ha&s;te to be in Mont&s;errat, and that the time then would not admit of adverti&s;ing, it being late in the even|ing, and the ve&s;&s;el about to &s;ail; but he in&s;i&s;ted it was nece&s;&s;ary, and other|wi&s;e he &s;aid he would not take me. This reduced me to great perplexity; for if I &s;hould be compelled to &s;ubmit to this degrading nece&s;&s;ity, which e|very black freeman is under, of adver|ti&s;ing him&s;elf like a &s;lave, when he leaves an i&s;land, and which I thought a gro&s;s impo&s;ition upon any freeman, I feared I &s;hould mi&s;s that opportunity of going to Mont&s;errat, and then I could not get to England that year. The ve&s;&s;el was ju&s;t going off, and no time could be lo&s;t; I immediately therefore &s;et about with a heavy heart, to try who I could get to befriend me in complying with the demands of the captain. Luckily I found in a few mi|nutes, &s;ome gentlemen of Mont&s;errat whom I knew; and having told them my &s;ituation, I reque&s;ted their friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance in helping me off the i&s;land,
<PB N="58" REF="023353_0262_0FBF442A1410D740">
Some of them, on this, went with me to the captain, and &s;atisfied him of my freedom; and, to my very great joy, he de&s;ired me to go on board. We then &s;et &s;ail, and the next day, 23d, I arriv|ed at the wi&s;hed-for place, after an ab&s;ence of &s;ix months, in which I had more than once experienced the deliv|ering hand of Providence, when all human means of e&s;caping de&s;truction &s;eemed hopele&s;s. I &s;aw my friends with a gladne&s;s of heart which was in|crea&s;ed by my ab&s;ence and the dangers I had e&s;caped, and I was received with great friend&s;hip by them all, but par|ticularly by Mr. King, to whom I re|lated the fate of his &s;loop, the Nancy, and the cau&s;es of her being wrecked. I now learned with extreme &s;orrow, that his hou&s;e was wa&s;hed away during my ab&s;ence, by the bur&s;ting of a pond at the top of a mountain that was op|po&s;ite the town of Plymouth. It &s;wept great part of the town away, and Mr. King lo&s;t a great deal of property from the inundation, and nearly his life. When I told him I intended to go to London that &s;ea&s;on, and that I had come to vi&s;it him before my departure, the good man expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of affection for me, and &s;orrow that I
<PB N="59" REF="023353_0263_0FBF442B06DA12F8">
&s;hould leave him, and warmly advi&s;ed me to &s;tay there; in&s;i&s;ting, as I was much re&s;pected by all the gentlemen in the place, that I might do very well, and in a &s;hort time have land and &s;laves of my own. I thanked him for this in&s;tance of his friend&s;hip; but, as I wi&s;hed very much to be in London, I declined remaining any longer there, and begged he would excu&s;e me. I then reque&s;ted he would be kind enough to give me a certificate of my behavi|our while in his &s;ervice, which he very readily complied with, and gave me the following:</P>

<P>Having obtained this, I parted from my kind ma&s;ter, after many &s;incere profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude and regard, and prepared for my departure for Lon|don. I immediately agreed to go with one Capt. John Hamer, for &s;even gui|neas

(the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ge to London) on board a &s;hip called, the Andromache; and on the 24th and 25th, I had free dances, as they are called, with &s;ome of my countrymen, previous to my &s;etting off; after which I took leave of all my friends, and on the 26th I embarked for London, exceedingly glad to &s;ee my|&s;elf once more on board of a &s;hip; and &s;till more &s;o, in &s;teering the cour&s;e I had long wi&s;hed for. With a light heart I bade Mont&s;errat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rewell, and never had my feet on it &s;ince; and with it I bade adieu to the &s;ound of the cruel whip, and all other dreadful in|&s;truments of torture; adieu to the of|fen&s;ive &s;ight of the violated cha&s;tity of the &s;able females, which has too often acco&s;ted my eyes; adieu to oppre&s;&s;ions (although to me le&s;s &s;evere than mo&s;t of my countrymen); and adieu to the angry, howling, da&s;hing &s;urfs. I wi&s;h|ed for a grateful and thankful heart to prai&s;e the Lord God on high for all his mercies! in this exta&s;y I &s;teered the &s;hip all night.</P>
<P>WE had a mo&s;t pro&s;perous voyage, and, at the end of &s;even weeks, arrived at Cherry-Garden &s;tairs. Thus were my longing eyes once more gratified with a &s;ight of London, after having
<PB N="61" REF="023353_0265_0FBF4434A3FEFF10">
been ab&s;ent from it above four years. I immediately received my wages, and I never had earned &s;even guineas &s;o quick in my life before; I had thirty-&s;even guineas in all, when I got cleared of the &s;hip. I now entered upon a &s;cene quite new to me, but full of hope. In this &s;ituation my fir&s;t thoughts were to look out for &s;ome of my former friends, and among&s;t the fir&s;t of tho&s;e were the Mi&s;s Guerins. As &s;oon there|fore, as I had regaled my&s;elf I went in que&s;t of tho&s;e kind ladies, whom I was very impatient to &s;ee; and with &s;ome difficulty and pre&s;everance, I found them at May's-hill Greenwhich. They were mo&s;t agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me, and I quite overjoyed at meeting with them. I told them my hi&s;tory, at which they expre&s;&s;ed great wonder, and freely acknowledged it did their cou&s;in, Captain Pa&s;cal, no honour. He then vi&s;ited there frequently; and I met him four or five days after in Greenwich park. When he &s;aw me he appeared a good deal &s;urpri&s;ed, and a&s;ked me how I came back? I an&s;wered, <Q>In a &s;hip.</Q> To which he replied dryly, <Q>I &s;uppo&s;e you did not walk back to London on the water.</Q> As I &s;aw, by his manner, that he did not &s;eem to be

&s;orry for his behaviour to me, and that I had not much rea&s;on to expect any favour from him, I told him that he had u&s;ed me very ill, after I had been &s;uch a faithful &s;ervant to him for &s;o many years; on which, without &s;aying any more, he turned about and went away. A few days after this I met Capt. Pa&s;cal at Mi&s;s Guerin's hou&s;e, and a&s;ked him for my prize-money. He &s;aid there was none due to me; for, if my prize-money had been 10,000l. he had a right to it all. I told him I was informed otherwi&s;e: on which he bade me definance; and in a bantering tone, de&s;ired me to commence a law|&s;uit again&s;t him for it: <Q>There are law|yers enough, &s;aid he, that will take the cau&s;e in hand, and you had better try it.</Q> I told him then that I would try it, which enraged him very much; however, out of regard to the ladies, I remained &s;till, and never made any farther demand of my right. Some time afterwards the&s;e friendly ladies a&s;ked me what I meant to do with my|&s;elf, and how they could a&s;&s;i&s;t me. I thanked them, and &s;aid, if they plea&s;ed, I would be their &s;ervant; but if not, I had thirty-&s;even guineas, which would &s;upport me for &s;ome time, I would be
<PB N="63" REF="023353_0267_0FBF4437127B3768">
much obliged to them to recommend me to &s;ome per&s;on who would teach me a bu&s;ine&s;s whereby I might earn my living. They an&s;wered me very po|litely, that they were &s;orry it did not &s;uit them to take me as their &s;ervant, and a&s;ked me what bu&s;ine&s;s I &s;hould like to learn? I &s;aid, hair-dre&s;&s;ing, They then promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in this; and &s;oon after they recommended me to a gentleman whom I had known before, one Capt. O'Hara, who treated me with much kindne&s;s, and procured me a ma&s;ter, a hair-dre&s;&s;er, in Coventry-court. Haymarket, with whom he placed me. I was with this man from Septem|ber till the February following. In that time we had a neighbour in the &s;ame court who taught the French-horn. He u&s;ed to blow it &s;o well that I was charmed with it, and agreed with him to teach me to blow it. Accordingly he took me in hand, and began to in|&s;truct me, and I &s;oon learned all the three parts. I took great delight in blowing on this in&s;trument, the evenings being long; and be&s;ides that I was fond of it, I did not like to be idle, and it filled up my vacant hours innocently. At this time, al&s;o I agreed with the Rev. Mr. Gregory, who lived in the
<PB N="64" REF="023353_0268_0FBF4438D31208C8">
&s;ame court, where he kept an academy and an evening-&s;chool, to improve me in arithmetic. This he did as far as barter and alligation; &s;o that all the time I was there I was entirely em|ployed. In February 1768, I hired my&s;elf to Dr. Charles Irving, in Pall|mall, &s;o celebrated for his &s;ucce&s;sful experiments in making &s;ea water fre&s;h; and here I had plenty of hair dre&s;&s;ing to improve my hand. This gentleman was an excellent ma&s;ter; he was exceed|ingly kind and good tempered; and allowed me in the evenings to attend my &s;chools, which I e&s;teemed a great ble&s;&s;ing; therefore I thanked God and him for it, and u&s;ed all my diligence to improve the opportunity. This dili|gence and attention recommended me to the notice and care of my three pre|ceptors, who on their parts be&s;towed a great deal of pains in my in&s;truction, and be&s;ides were all very kind to me. My wages, however, which were by two thirds le&s;s than ever I had in my life (for I had only 12l. per annum) I &s;oon found would not be &s;ufficient to defray this extraordinary expence of ma&s;ters, and my own nece&s;&s;ary ex|pences; my old thirty-&s;even guineas had by this time worn all away to one.
<PB N="65" REF="023353_0269_0FBF443AE00EC980">
I thought it be&s;t, therefore, to try the &s;ea again in que&s;t of more money, as I had been bred to it, and had hitherto found the profe&s;&s;ion of it &s;ucce&s;sful. I had al&s;o a very great de&s;ire to &s;ee Turkey, and I now determined to gra|tify it, Accordingly, in the month of May, 1768, I told the doctor my wi&s;h to go to &s;ea again, to which he made no oppo&s;ition; and we parted on friendly terms. The &s;ame day I went into the city in que&s;t of a ma&s;ter. I was ex|tremely fortunate in my inquiry; for I &s;oon heard of a gentleman who had a &s;hip going to Italy and Turkey, and he wanted a man who could dre&s;s hair well, I was overjoyed at this, and went imme|diately on board of his &s;hip, as I had been directed, which I found to be fitted up with great ta&s;te, and I already foreboded no &s;mall plea&s;ure in &s;ailing in her. Not finding the gentleman on board, I was directed to his lodgings, where I met with him the next day, and gave him a &s;pecimen of my d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;&s;ing. He liked it &s;o well that he hired me immediately, &s;o that I was perfectly happy; for the &s;hip, ma&s;ter, and voy|age, were entirely to my mind. The &s;hip was called the Delawar, and my ma&s;ter's name was John Jolly, a neat

&s;mart good humoured man, ju&s;t &s;uch an one as I wi&s;hed to &s;erve. We &s;ailed from England in July following, and our voyage was extremely plea&s;ant. We went to Villa Franca, Nice, and Leghorn; and in all the&s;e places I was charmed with the richne&s;s and beauty of the countries, and &s;truck with the elegant buildings with which they a|bound. We had always in them plenty of extraordinary good wines and rich fruits which I was very fond of; and I had frequent occa&s;ions of gratifying both my ta&s;te and curio&s;ity; for my captain always lodged on &s;hore in tho&s;e places, which afforded me opportuni|ties to &s;ee the country around. I al&s;o learned navigation of the mate, which I was very fond of. When we left Italy we had delightful &s;ailing among the Archipelago i&s;lands, and from thence to Smyrna in Turkey. This is a very ancient city; the hou&s;es are built of &s;tone, and mo&s;t of them have graves adjoining to them; &s;o that they &s;ome|times pre&s;ent the appearance of church|yards. Provi&s;ions are very plentiful in this city, and good wine le&s;s than a penny a pint. The grapes, pomegra|nates, and many other fruits, were al&s;o the riche&s;t and large&s;t I ever ta&s;ted.

The natives are well looking and &s;trong made, and treated me always with great civility. In general I believe they are fond of black people; and &s;everal of them gave me pre&s;&s;ing invi|tations to &s;tay among&s;t them, although they keep the franks, or Chri&s;tians, &s;e|parate, and do not &s;uffer them to dwell immediately among&s;t them. I was a&s;toni&s;hed in not &s;eeing women in any of their &s;hops, and very rarely any in the &s;treets; and whenever I did they were covered with a veil from head to foot, &s;o that I could not &s;ee their faces, except when any of them out of cu|rio&s;ity uncovered them to look at me, which they &s;ometimes did. I was &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee how the Greeks are, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, kept under by the Turks, as the negroes are in the We&s;t-Indies by the white people. The le&s;s refined Greeks, as I have already hinted, dance here in the &s;ame manner as we do in our nation.</P>
<P>On the whole, during our &s;tay here, which was about five months, I liked the place and the Turks extremely well. I could not help ob&s;erving one very remarkable circum&s;tance there: the tails of the &s;heep are flat, and &s;o very large, that I have known the tail even
<PB N="68" REF="023353_0272_0FBF444543646C68">
of a lamb to weigh from eleven to thirteen pounds. The fat of them is very white and rich, and is excellent in puddings, for which it is much u&s;ed. Our &s;hip being at length richly loaded with &s;ilk, and other articles, we &s;ailed for England.</P>
<P>In May 1769, &s;oon after our return from Turkey, our &s;hip made a delight|ful voyage to Oporto in Portugal, where we arrived at the time of the carnival On our arrival, there were &s;ent on board of us thirty-&s;ix articles to ob&s;erve with very heavy penalties if we &s;hould break any of them; and none of us even dared to go on board any other ve&s;&s;el or on &s;hore, till the Inqui&s;ition had &s;ent on board and &s;earched for every thing illegal, e&s;pe|cially bibles. Such as were produced, and certain other things were &s;ent on &s;hore till the &s;hips were going away; and any per&s;on in who&s;e cu&s;tody a bible was found concealed, was to be im|pri&s;oned and flogged, and &s;ent into &s;lavery for ten years. I &s;aw here ma|ny very magnificent &s;ights, particu|larly the garden of Eden, where many of the clergy and laity went in pro|ce&s;&s;ion in their &s;everal orders with the ho&s;t, and &s;ung Te Deum. I had a great
<PB N="69" REF="023353_0273_0FBF4446C160DFF0">
curio&s;ity to go into &s;ome of their churches, but could not gain admit|tance without u&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ary &s;prinkling of holy water at my en|trance. From curio&s;ity, and a wi&s;h to be holy, I therefore complied with this ceremony, but its virtues were lo&s;t upon me, for I found my&s;elf nothing the better for it. This place abounds with plenty of all kinds of provi&s;ions: The town is well built and pretty, and commands a fine pro&s;pect. Our &s;hip having taken in a load of wine, and other commodities, we &s;ailed for Lon|don, and arrived in July following.</P>
<P>OUR next voyage was to the Medi|terranean. The &s;hip was again got ready, and we &s;ailed in September for Genoa. This is one of the fine&s;t cities I ever &s;aw; &s;ome of the edifices were of beautiful marble, and made a mo&s;t noble appearance; and many had very curious fountains before them. The churches were rich and magnificent, and curiou&s;ly adorned both in the in|&s;ide and out. But all this grandeur was in my eyes di&s;graced by the galley &s;laves, who&s;e condition both there and in other parts of Italy is truly pi|teous and wretched. After we had &s;tayed there &s;ome weeks, during which
<PB N="70" REF="023353_0274_0FBF4449A5C0D738">
we bought many different things we wanted, and got them very cheap, we &s;ailed to Naples, a charming city, and remarkably clean. The bay is the mo&s;t beautiful I ever &s;aw; the moles for &s;hipping are excellent: I thought it extraordinary to &s;ee grand operas acted here on Sunday nights, and even attended by their maje&s;ties. I too, like the&s;e great ones, went to tho&s;e &s;ights, and vainly &s;erved God in the day while I thus &s;erved mammon effectually at night. While we remained here, there happened an eruption of mount Ve&s;u|vius, of which I had a perfect view. It was extremely awful; and we were &s;o near that the a&s;hes from it u&s;ed to be thick on our deck. After we had tran&s;|acted our bu&s;ine&s;s at Naples, we &s;ailed with a fair wind once more for Smyrna, where we arrived in December. A &s;era&s;kier or officer, took a liking to me here, and wanted me to &s;tay, and of|fered me two wives; however I refu&s;|ed the temptation, thinking one was as much as &s;ome could manage, and more than others would venture on. The merchants here travel in caravans or large companies. I have &s;een many caravans from India, with &s;ome hun|dreds of camels, laden with different
<PB N="71" REF="023353_0275_0FBF445103869680">
goods. The people of the&s;e caravans are quite brown. Among other articles they brought with them a great quan|tity of locu&s;ts, which are a kind of pul&s;e, &s;weet and plea&s;ant to the palace, and in &s;hape re&s;embling French beans, but longer. Each kind of goods is &s;old in a &s;treet by it&s;elf, and I always found the Turks very hone&s;t in their dealings. They let no Chri&s;tians into their mo&s;ques or churches, for which I was very &s;orry; as I was always fond of going to &s;ee the different modes of wor&s;hip of the people wherever I went. The plague broke out while we were in Smyrna, and we &s;topped taking goods into the &s;hip till it was over. She was then richly laden, and we &s;ailed in about March 1770, for England. One day in our pa&s;&s;age we met with an accident which was near burning the &s;hip. A black cook, in melting &s;ome fat, over|&s;et the pan into the fire under the deck, which immediately began to blaze, and the flame went up very high under the foretop. With the fright, the poor cook became almo&s;t white, and altoge|ther &s;peechle&s;s. Happily however we got the fire out without doing much mi&s;chief. After various delays in this
<PB N="72" REF="023353_0276_0FBF4452035706B8">
pa&s;&s;age, which was tedious, we arrived in Standgate creek in July; and, at the latter end of the year, &s;ome new event occurred, &s;o that my noble Captain, the &s;hip, and I all &s;eparated.</P>
<P>IN April 1771, I &s;hipped my&s;elf as a &s;teward with Capt. Wm. Robert&s;on of the &s;hip Grenada Planter, once more to try my fortune in the We&s;t Indies; and we &s;ailed from London for Madeira, Barbadoes, and the Grenades. When we were at this la&s;t place, having &s;ome goods to &s;ell, I met once more with my former kind of We&s;t India cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>A white man, an i&s;lander, bought &s;ome goods of me to the amount of &s;ome pounds, and made me many fair promi&s;es as u&s;ual, but without any in|tention of paying me. He had like|wi&s;e bought goods from &s;ome more of our people, whom he intended to &s;erve in the &s;ame manner; but he &s;till amu&s;|&s;ed us with promi&s;es However, when our &s;hip was loaded, and near &s;ailing, this hone&s;t buyer di&s;covered no inten|tion or &s;ign of paying for any thing he had bought of us; but on the contrary, when I a&s;ked him for my money he threatened me and another black man he had bought goods of, &s;o that we found we were like to get more blows
<PB N="73" REF="023353_0277_0FBF4453969328D8">
than payment. On this we went to complain to one Mr. M'Into&s;h, a ju&s;|tice of the peace; we told his wor&s;hip of the man's villainous tricks, and beg|ged that he would be kind enough to &s;ee us redre&s;&s;ed: but being negroes, although free, we could not get any remedy; and our &s;hip being then ju&s;t upon the point of &s;ailing, we knew not how to help our&s;elves, though we thought it hard to lo&s;e our property in this manner. Luckily for us however, this man was al&s;o indebted to three white &s;ailors, who could not get a far|thing from him; they therefore readily joined us, and we all went together in &s;earch of him. When we found where he was, I took him out of a hou&s;e and threatened him with vengeance; on which, finding he was likely to be handled ronghly, the rogue offered each of us &s;ome &s;mall allowance, but nothing near our demands. This exa&s;perated us much more; and &s;ome were for cutting his ears off; but he begged hard for mercy, which was at la&s;t granted him, after we had entirely &s;tripped him. We then let him go, for which he thanked us, glad to get off &s;o ea&s;ily, and ran into the bu&s;hes, after having wi&s;hed us a good voyage. We
<PB N="74" REF="023353_0278_0FBF445B5BDB4578">
then repaired on board, and &s;hortly after &s;et &s;ail for England. I cannot help remarking here a very narrow e&s;cape we had from being blown up, owing to a piece of negligence of mine, Ju&s;t as our &s;hip was under &s;ail, I went down under the cabin to do &s;ome bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and had a lighted candle in my hand, which, in my hurry, without thinking, I held in a barrel of gun|powder. It remained in the powder until it was near catching fire, when fortunately I ob&s;erved it and &s;natched it out in time, and providentially no harm happened; but I was &s;o over|come with terror that I immediately fainted at this deliverance.</P>
<P>IN twenty-eight days time we arriv|ed in England, and I got clear of this &s;hip. But, being &s;till of a roving di&s;|po&s;ition, and de&s;irous of &s;eeing as many different parts of the world as I could, I &s;hipped my&s;elf &s;oon after, in the &s;ame year, as &s;teward on board of a fine large &s;hip, called the Jamaica, Captain David Watt; and we &s;ailed from England in December 1771, for Nevis and Jamaica. I found Jamaica to be a very fine large i&s;land, well peopled, and the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable of the We&s;t India i&s;lands. There was a va&s;t number of negroes
<PB N="75" REF="023353_0279_0FBF445D43763B00">
here, whom I found as u&s;ual exceed|ingly impo&s;ed upon by the white peo|ple, and the &s;laves puni&s;hed as in the other i&s;lands. There are negroes who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to flog &s;laves; they go about to different people for employ|ment, and the u&s;ual pay is from one to four bits. I &s;aw many cruel puni&s;h|ments inflicted on the &s;laves in the &s;hort time I &s;tayed here. In particular I was pre&s;ent when a poor fellow was tied up and kept hanging by the wri&s;ts at &s;ome di&s;tance from the ground, and then &s;ome half hundred weights were fixed to his ancles, in which po&s;ture he was flogged mo&s;t unmercifully. There were al&s;o, as I heard, two different ma&s;|ters noted for cruelty on the i&s;land, who had &s;taked up two negroes naked, and in two hours the vermin &s;tung them to death. I heard a gentleman, I well knew, tell my captain that he pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence on a negro man to be burnt alive for attempting to poi&s;on an over|&s;eer. I pa&s;s over numerous other in&s;tan|ces, in order to relieve the reader by a milder &s;cene of roguery. Before I had been long on the i&s;land, one Mr. Smith at Port Morant, bought goods of me to the amount of twenty-five pounds &s;ter|ling; but when I demanded payment
<PB N="76" REF="023353_0280_0FBF445EF04DA190">
from him, he was going each time to beat me, and threatened that he would put me in goal. One time he would &s;ay I was going to &s;et his hou&s;e on fire; at another, he would &s;wear I was going to run away with his &s;laves. I was a&s;toni&s;hed at this u&s;age from a per|&s;on who was in the &s;ituation of a gen|tleman, but I had no alternative; and was therefore obliged to &s;ubmit. When I came to King&s;ton, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the number of Africans who were a&s;&s;embled together on Sundays; parti|cularly at a large commodious place, called Spring Path. Here each differ|ent nation of Africa meet and dance after the manner of their own country. They &s;till retain mo&s;t of their native cu&s;toms: they bury their dead, and put victuals, pipes and tobacco, and other things, in the grave with the corps, in the &s;ame manner as in Africa. Our &s;hip having got her loading we &s;ailed for London, where we arrived in the Augu&s;t following. On my re|turn to London, I waited on my old and good ma&s;ter, Dr. Irving, who made me an offer of his &s;ervice again. Being now tired of the &s;ea I gladly ac|cepted it. I was very happy in living with this gentleman once more; dur|ing
<PB N="77" REF="023353_0281_0FBF446404158070">
which time we were daily employ|ed in reducing old Neptune's domi|nions by purifying the briny element and making it fre&s;h. Thus I went on till May 1773, when I was rou&s;ed by the &s;ound of &s;ame, to &s;eek new adven|tures, and find, towards the north pole, what our Creator never intended we &s;hould, a pa&s;&s;age to India. An expedition was now fitting out to ex|plore a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age, conducted by the Honourable Con&s;tantine John Phipps, &s;ince Lord Mulgrave, in his Maje&s;ty's &s;loop of war the Race Hor&s;e. My ma&s;ter being anxious for the repu|tation of this adventure, we therefore prepared every thing for our voyage, and I attended him on board the Race Hor&s;e, the 24th day of May, 1773. We proceeded to Sheerne&s;s, where we were joined by his Maje&s;ty's &s;loop the Carca&s;s, commanded by Captain Lut|widge. On the 4th of June, we &s;ailed towards our de&s;tined place, the pole; and on the 15th of the &s;ame month we were off Shetland. On this day I had a great and unexpected deliverance from an accident which was near blowing up the &s;hip and de&s;troying the crew, which made me ever after during the voyage uncommonly cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|tious.
<PB N="78" REF="023353_0282_0FBF4465805D0868">
The &s;hip was &s;o filled that there was very little room on board for any one, which placed me in a very auk|ward &s;ituation. I had re&s;olved to keep a journal of this &s;ingular and intere&s;t|ing voyage; and I had no other place for this purpo&s;e but a little cabin, or the doctor's &s;tore-room, where I &s;lept. This little place was &s;tuffed with all manner of combu&s;tibles, particularly with tow and aquafortis, and many other dangerous things. Unfortunately it happened in the evening as I was writing my journal, that I had occa&s;ion to take the candle out of the lanthorn, and a &s;park having touched a &s;ingle thread of the tow, all the re&s;t caught the flame, and immediately the whole was in a blaze. I &s;aw nothing but pre|&s;ent death before me, and expected to be the fir&s;t to peri&s;h in the flames. In a moment the alarm was &s;pread, and many people who were near, ran to a&s;&s;i&s;t in putting out the fire. All this time I was in the very mid&s;t of the flames; my &s;hirt, and the handkerchief on my neck, were burnt, and I was almo&s;t &s;mothered with the &s;moke. However, through God's mercy, as I was nearly giving up all hopes, &s;ome people brought blankets and mattre&s;&s;es
<PB N="79" REF="023353_0283_0FBF44671FED6E70">
and threw them on the flames, by which means in a &s;hort time the fire was put out. I was &s;everely repri|manded and menaced by &s;uch of the officers who knew it, and &s;trictly charged never more to go there with a light: and, indeed, even my own fears made me give heed to this com|mand for a little time; but at la&s;t, not being able to write my journal in any other part of the &s;hip, I was tempted again to venture by &s;tealth with a light in the &s;ame cabin, though not without con&s;iderable fear and dread on my mind. On the 20th of June, we began to u&s;e Dr. Irving's apparatus for mak|ing &s;alt water fre&s;h; I u&s;ed to attend the di&s;tillery: I frequently purified from twenty-&s;ix to forty gallons a day. The water thus di&s;tilled was perfectly pure, well ta&s;ted, and free from &s;alt; and was u&s;ed on various occa&s;ions on board the &s;hip. On the 28th of June, being in lat: 78, we made Greenland, where I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the &s;un did not &s;et. The weather now became extremely cold; and as we &s;ailed be|tween north and ea&s;t which was our cour&s;e, we &s;aw many very high and curious mountains of ice; and al&s;o a great number of very large whales,
<PB N="80" REF="023353_0284_0FBF446971AE2F78">
which u&s;ed to come clo&s;e to our &s;hip, and blow the water up to a very great height in the air. One morning we had va&s;t quantities of &s;ea hor&s;es about the &s;hip, which neighed exactly like any other hor&s;es. We fired &s;ome har|poon guns among&s;t them, in order to take &s;ome, but we could not get any. The 30th, the captain of a Greenland &s;hip came on board, and told us of three &s;hips that were lo&s;t in the ice; however we &s;till held on our cour&s;e till July the 11th, when we were &s;topt by one compact impenetrable body of ice. We ran along it from ea&s;t to we&s;t above ten degrees; and on the 27th we got as far north as 80, 37; and in 19 or 20 degrees; ea&s;t longitude from London. On the 29th and 30th of July, we &s;aw one continued plain of &s;mooth unbroken ice, bounded only by the horizon; and we fa&s;tened to a piece of ice that was eight yards eleven inches thick. We had generally &s;un|&s;hine, and con&s;tant daylight; which gave cheerfulne&s;s and novelty to the whole of this &s;triking, grand, and un|common &s;cene; and, to heighten it &s;till more, the reflection of the &s;un from the ice gave the clouds a mo&s;t beautiful appearance. We killed many
<PB N="81" REF="023353_0285_0FBF44705502CCA8">
different animals at this time, and a|mong the re&s;t nine bears. Though they had nothing in their paunches but water yet they were all very fat. We u&s;ed to decoy them to the &s;hip &s;ome|times by burning feathers of &s;kins. I thought them cour&s;e eating, but &s;ome of the &s;hip's company reli&s;hed them very m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch. Some of our people once in the boat, fired at and wounded a &s;ea-hor&s;e, which dived immediately: and in a little time after, brought up with it a number of others. They all joined in an attack upon the boat, and were with difficulty prevented from &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing or over&s;etting her; but a boat from the Carca&s;s having come to a&s;&s;i&s;t ours, and joined it, they di&s;per&s;ed, after hav|ing wre&s;ted an oar from one of the men. One of the &s;hip's boats had be|fore been attacked in the &s;ame manner, but happily no harm was done. Though we wounded &s;everal of the&s;e animals we never got but one. We remained hereabouts until the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t; when the two &s;hips got com|pletely fa&s;tened in the ice, occa&s;ioned by the loo&s;e ice that &s;et in from the &s;ea. This made our &s;ituation very dreadful and alarming; &s;o that on the 7th day, we were in very great apprehen&s;ion of
<PB N="82" REF="023353_0286_0FBF44734A0D74B0">
having the &s;hips &s;queezed to pieces. The officers now held a council to know what was be&s;t for us to do in order to &s;ave our lives; and it was determined that we &s;hould endeavour to e&s;cape by dragging our boats along the ice towards the &s;ea; which, how|ever, was farther off than any of us thought. This determination filled us with extreme dejection, and confound|ed us with de&s;pair; for we had very little pro&s;pect of e&s;caping with life. However, we &s;awed &s;ome of the ice about the &s;hips, to keep it from hurting them; and thus kept them in a kind of pond. We then began to drag the boats as well as we could towards the &s;ea; but, after two or three days la|bour, we made very little progre&s;s; &s;o that &s;ome of our hearts totally failed us, and I really began to give up my|&s;elf for lo&s;t, when I &s;aw our &s;urround|ing calamities. While we were at this hard labour, I once fell into a pond we had made among&s;t &s;ome loo&s;e ice, and was very near being drowned; but providentially &s;ome people were near who gave me immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and thereby I e&s;caped drowning. Our deplorable condition, which kept up the con&s;tant apprehen&s;ion of our pe|ri&s;hing
<PB N="83" REF="023353_0287_0FBF4474811E6850">
in the ice, brought me gradu|ally to think of eternity in &s;uch a man|ner as I never had done before. I had the fears of death hourly upon me, and &s;huddered at the thoughts of meet|ing the grim king of terrors in the <HI>natural</HI> &s;tate I then was in, and was ex|ceedingly doubtful of a happy eternity if I &s;hould die in it. I had no hopes of my life being prolonged for any time; for we &s;aw that our exi&s;tence could not be long on the ice after leav|ing the &s;hips, which were now out of &s;ight, and &s;ome miles from the boats. Our appearance now became truly la|mentable; pale dejection &s;eized every countenance; many, who had been before bla&s;phemers, in this our di&s;tre&s;s began to call on the good God of hea|ven for his help; and in the time of our utter need he heard us, and again&s;t hope or human probability, delivered us! It was the eleventh day of the &s;hips being thus fa&s;tened, and the fourth of our drawing the boats in this manner, that the wind changed to the E. N. E. The weather immediately became mild, and the ice broke to|wards the &s;ea, which was to the S. W. of us. Many of us on this got on board again, and with all our might
<PB N="84" REF="023353_0288_0FBF447603A8CC50">
we hove the &s;hips into every open water we could find, and made all the &s;ail on them in our power: and now, having a pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, we made &s;ignals for the boats and the remainder of the people. This &s;eemed to us like a reprieve from death: and happy was the man who could fir&s;t get on board of any &s;hip, or the fir&s;t boat he could meet. We then proceeded in this manner till we got into the open water again, which we accompli&s;hed in about thirty hours, to our infinite joy and gladne&s;s of heart. As &s;oon as we were out of danger, we came to anchor and refitted; and on the 19th of Augu&s;t, we &s;ailed from this uninhabited extre|mity of the world, where the inho&s;|pitable climate affords neither food nor &s;helter, and not a tree or a &s;hrub of any kind grows among&s;t its barren rocks; but all is one de&s;olate and ex|panded wa&s;te of ice, which even the con&s;tant beams of the &s;un for &s;ix months in the year, cannot penetrate or di&s;&s;olve. The &s;un now being on the decline, the days &s;hortened as we &s;ailed to the &s;outhward; and, on the 28th, in latitude 73, it was dark by ten o'clock at night. September the 10th, in latitude 58-59, we met a
<PB N="85" REF="023353_0289_0FBF447DAE4951C8">
very &s;evere gale of wind and high &s;eas, and &s;hipped a great deal of water in the &s;pace of ten hours. This made us work exceedingly hard at all our pumps a whole day; and one &s;ea, which &s;truck the &s;hip with more force than any thing I ever met with of the kind before, laid her under water for &s;ome time, &s;o that we thought &s;he would have gone down. Two boats were wa&s;hed from the booms, and the long-boat from the chucks: all other moveable things on the decks were al&s;o wa&s;hed away, a|mong which were many curious things of different kinds which we had brought from Greenland; and we were obliged, in order to ligthen the &s;hip, to to&s;s &s;ome of our guns over|board. We &s;aw a &s;hip at the &s;ame time, in very great di&s;tre&s;s, and her ma&s;ts were gone; but we were unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. We now lo&s;t &s;ight of the Carca&s;s till the 26th, when we &s;aw land about Orfordne&s;s, of which place &s;he joined us. From thence we &s;ailed for London, and on the 30th came up to Deptford. And thus ended our Arctic voyage, to the no &s;mall joy of all on board, after having been ab&s;ent four months; in which time, at the imminent hazard of our lives, we ex|plored
<PB N="86" REF="023353_0290_0FBF447FBA8C0D68">
nearly as far towards the Pole as 81 degrees north, and 20 degrees ea&s;t longitude; being much farther, by all accounts, than any navigator had ever ventured before; in which we fully proved the impracticability of finding a pa&s;&s;age that way to india.</P>

<P>OUR voyage to the North Pole be|ing ended, I returned to London with Doctor Irving, with whom I con|tinued for &s;ome time, during which I began &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on the dangers I had e&s;caped, particularly tho&s;e of my la&s;t voyage, which made a la&s;ting im|pre&s;&s;ion on my mind; and, by the grace of God, proved afterwards a mercy to me; it cau&s;ed me to reflect deeply on myeternal&s;tate, and to &s;eek the Lord with full purpo&s;e of heart ere it was too late. I rejoiced greatly; and heartily
<PB N="88" REF="023353_0292_0FBF448711328EB0">
thanked the Lord for directing me to London, where I was determined to work out my own &s;alvation, and in &s;o doing, procure a title to heaven; being the re&s;ult of a mind blinded by igno|rance and &s;in.</P>
<P>IN proce&s;s of time I left my ma&s;ter, Doctor Irving, the purifier of waters. I lodged in Coventry-court, Hay|market, where I was continually op|pre&s;&s;ed and much concerned about the &s;alvation of my &s;oul, and was deter|mined (in my own &s;trength) to be a fir&s;t-rate Chri&s;tian. I u&s;ed every means for this purpo&s;e; and, not being able to find any per&s;on among&s;t tho&s;e with whom I was then acquainted that ac|quie&s;ced with me in point of religion. or, in &s;cripture language, that would &s;hew me any good, I was much de|jected, and knew not where to &s;eek relief; however&punc; I fir&s;t frequented the neighbouring churches, St. Jame's, and others, two or three times a day, for many weeks: &s;till I came away di&s;&s;atis|fied: &s;omething was wanting that I could not obtain, and I really found more heart-felt relief in reading my bible at home than in attending the church; and, being re&s;olved to be &s;aved, I pur&s;ued other methods. Fir&s;t I went
<PB N="89" REF="023353_0293_0FBF4488440914C0">
among the quakers, where the word of God was neither read or preached, &s;o that I remained as much in the dark as ever. I then &s;earched into the Ro|man catholic principles, but was not in the lea&s;t edified. I at length had re|cour&s;e to the Jews, which availed me nothing, as the fear of eternity daily hara&s;&s;ed my mind, and I knew not where to &s;eek &s;helter from the wrath to come. However this was my con|clu&s;ion, at all events, to read the four evangeli&s;ts, and whatever &s;ect or party I found adhering thereto, &s;uch I would join. Thus I went on heavily without any guide to direct me the way that leadeth to eternal life. I a&s;ked dif|ferent people que&s;tions about the man|ner of going to heaven, and was told different ways. Here I was much &s;tag|gered, and could not find any at that time more righteous than my&s;elf, or in|deed &s;o much inclined to devotion. I thought we &s;hould not all be &s;aved (this is agreeable to the holy &s;criptures) nor would all be damned. I found none among the circle of my acquaintance that kept wholly the ten command|ments. So righteous was I in my own eyes, that I was convinced I excelled many of them in that point, by keeping

eight out of ten; and finding tho&s;e who in general termed them&s;elves Chri&s;tians not &s;o hone&s;t or &s;o good in their morals as the Turks, I really thought the Turks were in a &s;afer way of &s;alvation than my neighbours: &s;o that between hopes and &s;ears I went on, and the chief com|forts I enjoyed were in the mu&s;ical French horn, which I then practi&s;ed and al&s;o dre&s;&s;ing of hair. Such was my &s;ituation &s;ome months, experiencing the di&s;hone&s;ty of many people here. I determined at la&s;t to &s;et out for Turkey, and there to end my days. It was now early in the &s;pring 1774. I &s;ought for a ma&s;ter, and found a captain John Haghes, commander of a &s;hip called Anglicanai, fitting out in the river Thames, and bound to Smyrna in Tur|key. I &s;hipped my&s;elf with him as a &s;teward; at the &s;ame time I recom|mended to him a very clever black man, John Annis, as a cook. This man was on board the &s;hip near two months doing his duty: he had former|ly lived many years with Mr. William Kirkpatrick, a gentleman of the i&s;land of St Kitts, from whom he parted by con&s;ent, though he afterwards tried many &s;chemes to inveigle the poor man. He had applied to many cap|tains
<PB N="91" REF="023353_0295_0FBF448B0064D868">
who traded to St. Kitts to trepan him; and when all their attempts and &s;chemes of kidnapping proved abor|tive, Mr. Kirkpatrick came to our &s;hip at Union Stairs, on Ea&s;ter Monday, April the fourth, with two wherry boats and &s;ix men, having learned that the man was on board; and tied, and forcibly took him away from the &s;hip, in the pre&s;ence of the crew and the chief mate, who had detained him af|ter he had information to come away. I believe this was a combined piece of bu&s;ine&s;s: but, be that as it may, it certainly reflected great di&s;grace on the mate and captain al&s;o, who, al|though they had de&s;ired the oppre&s;|&s;ed man to &s;tay on board, yet this vile act on the man who had &s;erved him, he did not in the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t to recover or pay me a farthing of his wages, which was about five pounds. I proved the only friend he had, who attempted to regain him his liberty if po&s;&s;ible, hav|ing known the want of liberty my&s;elf. I &s;ent as &s;oon as I could to Grave&s;end, and got knowledge of the &s;hip in which he was; but unluckily &s;he had &s;ailed the fir&s;t tide after he was put on board. My intention was then imme|diately to apprehend Mr. Kirkpatrick,
<PB N="92" REF="023353_0296_0FBF448CA6A37AC0">
who was about &s;etting off for Scot|land; and, having obtained a <HI>habeas corpus</HI> for him, and got a tip&s;taff to go with me to St. Paul's church-yard, where he lived, he, &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome|thing of this kind, &s;et a watch to look out. My being known to them, oblig|ed me to u&s;e the following deception: I whitened my face, that they might not know me, and this had the de&s;ired effect. He did not go out of his hou&s;e that night, and next morning I con|trived a well plotted &s;tratagem, not|with&s;tanding he had a gentleman in his hou&s;e to per&s;onate him. My direction to the tip&s;taff, who got admittance into the hou&s;e, was to conduct him to a judge, according to the writ. When he came there, his plea was, that he had not the body in cu&s;tody, on which he was admitted to bail. I proceeded immediately to that well known phi|lanthropi&s;t, Granville Sharp, E&s;q. who received me with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s, and gave me every in&s;truction that was needful on the occa&s;ion. I left him in full hope that I &s;hould gain the unhappy man his liberty, with the warme&s;t &s;en&s;e of gratitude towards Mr. Sharp, for his kindne&s;s; but alas! my attorney proved unfaithful; he
<PB N="93" REF="023353_0297_0FBF4491D31475E0">
took my money, lo&s;t me many months employ, and did not do the lea&s;t good in the cau&s;e; and when the poor man arrived at St. Kitts, he was, accord|ing to cu&s;tom, &s;taked to the ground with four pins through a cord, two on his wri&s;ts, and two on his ancles, was cut and flogged mo&s;t unmercifully and afterwards loaded cruelly with irons about his neck. I had two very moving letters from him, while he was in this &s;ituation; and made at|tempts to go after him at a great haz|ard, but was &s;adly di&s;appointed. I al&s;o was told of it by &s;ome very re&s;|pectable families now in London, who &s;aw him in St. Kitts, in the &s;ame &s;tate, in which he remained till kind death relea&s;ed him out of the hands of his tyrants. During this di&s;agreeable bu|&s;ine&s;s I was under &s;trong convictions of &s;in, and thought that my &s;tate was wor&s;e than any man's; my mind was unaccountably di&s;turbed; I often wi&s;h|ed for death, though at the &s;ame time convinced I was altogether unprepared for that awful &s;ummons. Suffering much by villains in the late cau&s;e, and being much concerned about the &s;tate of my &s;oul, the&s;e things (but particu|larly the latter) brought me very low;
<PB N="94" REF="023353_0298_0FBF4494B3EA67C0">
&s;o that I became a burden to my&s;elf, and viewed all things around me as emptine&s;s and vanity, which could could give no &s;atisfaction to a trou|bled con&s;cience. I was again deter|mined to go to Turkey, and re&s;olved, at that time, never more to return to England. I engaged as a &s;teward on board a Turkeyman (the We&s;ter Hall, Capt. Lina) but was prevented by means of my late captain, Mr. Hughes, and others. All this appeard to be a|gain&s;t me, and the only comfort I then experienced was, in reading the holy &s;criptures, where I &s;aw that <Q>there is no new thing under the &s;un,</Q> Eccle&s;. 1. 9; and what was appointed for me I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to. Thus I con|tinued to travel in much heavine&s;s, and frequently murmured again&s;t the Al|mighty, particularly in his providen|tial dealings; and, awful to think! I began to bla&s;pheme, and wi&s;hed often to be any thing but a human being. In the&s;e &s;evere conflicts the Lord an&s;wer|ed me by awful <Q>vi&s;ions of the night, when deep &s;leep falleth upon men, in &s;lumberings upon the bed,</Q> Job xxxiii. 15. He was plea&s;ed, in much mercy, to give me to &s;ee, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure under&s;tand, the great
<PB N="95" REF="023353_0299_0FBF44964F6DFF38">
and awful &s;cene of the judgment|day, that <Q>no unclean per&s;on, no unholy thing, can enter into the kingdom of God,</Q> Eph. v. 5. I would then, if it had been po&s;|&s;ible, have changed my nature with the meane&s;t worm on the earth; and was ready to &s;ay to the mountains and rocks "fall on me." Rev. vi. 16; but all in vain. I then in the greate&s;t agony reque&s;ted the divine Creator, that he would grant me a &s;mall &s;pace of time to repent of my follies and vile iniquities, which I felt were grievous, The Lord, in his manifold mercies, was plea&s;ed to grant my reque&s;t, and being yet in a &s;tate of time the &s;en&s;e of God's mercies were &s;o great on my mind when I awoke, that my &s;trength entirely fail|ed me for many minutes, and I was ex|ceedingly weak. This was the fir&s;t &s;piritual mercy I ever was &s;en&s;ible of, and being on praying ground, as &s;oon as I recovered a little &s;trength, and got out of bed and dre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf, I invoked Heaven from my inmo&s;t &s;oul, and fer|vently begged that God would never again permit me to bla&s;pheme his mo&s;t holy name. The Lord, who is long|&s;uffering, and full of compa&s;&s;ion to &s;uch poor rebels as we are, conde&s;cended to
<PB N="96" REF="023353_0300_0FBF449B8EE18648">
hear and an&s;wer. I felt that I was al|together unholy, and &s;aw clearly what a bad u&s;e I had made of the faculties I was endowed with: they were given me to glorify God with; I thought, there|fore, I had better want them here, and enter into life eternal, than abu&s;e them and be ca&s;t into hell fire. I prayed to be directed, if there were any holier than tho&s;e with whom I was acquaint|ed, that the Lord would point them out to me. I appealed to the Searcher of hearts, whether I did not wi&s;h to love him more, and &s;erve him better. Not|with&s;tanding all this, the reader may ea&s;ily di&s;cern, if a believer, that I was &s;till in nature's darkne&s;s. At length I hated the hou&s;e in which I lodged, be|cau&s;e God's mo&s;t holy name was bla&s;|phemed in it: then I &s;aw the word of God verified, viz. <Q>Before they call, I will an&s;wer; and while they are yet &s;peaking, I will hear.</Q></P>
<P>I had a great de&s;ire to read the bible the whole day at home; but not having a convenient place for retirement, I left the hou&s;e in the day, rather than &s;tay among&s;t the wicked ones; and that day as I was walking, it plea&s;ed God to direct me to a hou&s;e where there was an old &s;ea-faring man, who experienced
<PB N="97" REF="023353_0301_0FBF449D2219C450">
much of the love of God &s;hed abroad in his heart. He began to di&s;cour&s;e with me; and, as I de&s;ired to love the Lord, his conver&s;ation rejoiced me greatly; and indeed I had never heard before the love of Chri&s;t to believers &s;et forth in &s;uch a manner, and in &s;o clear a point of view. Here I had more que&s;tions to put to the man than his time would per|mit him to an&s;wer: and in that memor|able hour there came in a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter; he joined our di&s;cour&s;e, and a&s;ked me &s;ome few que&s;tions; among others, where I heard the go&s;pel preached? I knew not what he meant by hearing the go&s;pel; I told him I had read the go&s;pel: and he a&s;ked where I went to church, or whether I went at all or not? To which I replied <Q>I attended St. James's, St. Martin's, and St. Ann's Soho;&mdash;So, &s;aid he, you are a churchman?</Q> I an&s;wered, I was. He then invited me to a love|fea&s;t at his chapel that evening. I ac|cepted the offer, and thanked him; and &s;oon after he went away, I had &s;ome further di&s;cour&s;e with the old Chri&s;tian, added to &s;ome profitable read|ing, which made me exceedingly hap|py. When I left him he reminded me of coming to the fea&s;t; I a&s;&s;ured him
<PB N="98" REF="023353_0302_0FBF44A3BAF4BA48">
I would be there. Thus we parted, and I weighed over the heavenly conver|&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e two men, which cheered my then heavy and drooping &s;pirit more than any thing I had met with for many months. How|ever, I thought the time long in going to my &s;uppo&s;ed banquet. I al&s;o wi&s;hed much for the company of the&s;e friendly men; their company plea&s;ed me much; and I thought the gentleman very kind in a&s;king me, a &s;tranger, to a fea&s;t; but how &s;ingular did it appear to me, to have it in a chapel! When the wi&s;h|ed for hour came I went, and happily the old man was there, who kindly &s;eated me, as he belonged to the place. I was much a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee the place filled with people, and no &s;igns of eating and drinking. There were many mini&s;ters in the company. At la&s;t they began by giving out hymns, and between the &s;inging, the mini&s;ters engaged in prayer: in &s;hort, I knew not what to make of this &s;ight, having never &s;een any thing of the kind in my life before now. Some of the gue&s;ts began to &s;peak their experience, agreeable to what I read in the Scriptures: much was &s;aid by every &s;peaker of the providence of God, and his un&s;peakable mercies, to
<PB N="99" REF="023353_0303_0FBF44A6D6CE0EF8">
each of them. This I knew in a great mea&s;ure, and could mo&s;t heartily join them. But when they &s;poke of a future &s;tate, they &s;eemed to be altogether cer|tain of their calling and election of God; and that no one could ever &s;eperate them from the love of Chri&s;t, or pluck them out of his hands. This filled me with utter con&s;ternation, intermingled with admiration. I was &s;o amazed as not to know what to think of the com|pany; my heart was attracted, and my affections were enlarged. I wi&s;hed to be as happy as them, and was per&s;uaded in my mind that they were different from the world <Q>that lieth in wicked|ne&s;s,</Q> 1 John v. 19. Their language and &s;inging, &amp;c. did well harmonize; I was entirely overcome, and wi&s;hed to live and die thus. La&s;tly, &s;ome per&s;ons in the place produced &s;ome neat ba&s;kets full of buns, which they di&s;tributed a|bout; and each per&s;on communicated with his neighbour, and &s;ipped water out of different mugs, which they hand|ed about to all who were pre&s;ent. This kind of Chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip I had never &s;een, nor ever thought of &s;eeing on earth; it fully reminded me of what I had read in the holy &s;criptures, of the primitive Chri&s;tians, who loved each
<PB N="100" REF="023353_0304_0FBF44A842264330">
other and broke bread; in partaking of it, even from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. This entertainment (which la&s;ted about four hours) ended in &s;inging and prayer. It was the fir&s;t &s;oul fea&s;t I ever was pre&s;ent at. This la&s;t twenty-four hours pro|duced me things, &s;piritual and temporal, &s;leeping and waking, judgment and mercy, that I could not but admire the goodne&s;s of God, in directing the blind, bla&s;phemous &s;inner in the path that he knew not of, even among the ju&s;t; and in&s;tead of judgment he has &s;hewed mer|cy, and will hear and an&s;wer the pray|ers and &s;upplications of every returning prodigal:
<Q><L>O! to grace how great a debtor</L>
<L>Daily I'm con&s;train'd to be!</L></Q></P>
<P>AFTER this I was re&s;olved to win Heaven if po&s;&s;ible; and if I peri&s;hed I thought it &s;hould be at the feet of Je&s;us, in praying to him for &s;alvation. After having been an eye-witne&s;s to &s;ome of the happine&s;s which attended tho&s;e who feared God, I knew not how, with any propriety, to return to my lodgings, where the name of God was continually profaned, at which I felt the greate&s;t horror; I pau&s;ed in my mind for &s;ome time, not knowing what to do; whe|ther
<PB N="101" REF="023353_0305_0FBF44A9D14F5DB0">
to hire a bed el&s;ewhere, or go home again. At la&s;t fearing an evil report might ari&s;e, I went home, with a farewel to card-playing and vain je&s;t|ing, &amp;c. I &s;aw that time was very &s;hort, eternity long, and very near; and I viewed tho&s;e per&s;ons alone ble&s;&s;ed who were found ready at midnight call, or when the judge of all, both quick and dead, cometh.</P>
<P>THE next day I took courage, and went to Holborn, to &s;ee my new and worthy acquaintance, the old man, Mr. C&mdash;; he, with his wife, a gra|cious woman, were at work at &s;ilk weaving; they &s;eemed mutually happy, and both quite glad to &s;ee me, and I more &s;o to &s;ee them. I &s;at down and we conver&s;ed much about &s;oul matters, &amp;c. Their di&s;cour&s;e was amazingly de|lightful, edifying, and plea&s;ant. I knew not at la&s;t how to leave this agreeable pair, till time &s;ummoned me away. As I was going they lent me a little book, entitled <Q>The conver&s;ion of an In|dian.</Q> It was in que&s;tions and an|&s;wers. The poor man came over the &s;ea to London, to inquire after the Chri&s;tian's God, who, (through rich mercy) he found, and had not his jour|ney in vain. The above book was of
<PB N="102" REF="023353_0306_0FBF44AB56933C60">
greatu&s;e to me, and at that time was a means of &s;trengthening my faith; how|ever, in parting, they both invited me to call on them when I plea&s;ed. This delighted me, and I took care to make all the improvement from it I could; and &s;o far I thanked God for &s;uch com|pany and de&s;ires. I prayed that the many evils I felt within might be done away, and that I might be weaned from my former carnal acquaintances. This was quickly heard and an&s;wered, and I was &s;oon connected with tho&s;e whom the &s;cripture calls the excellent of the earth. I heard the go&s;pel preached, and the thoughts of my heart and actions were laid open by the preachers, and the way of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t alone was e|vidently &s;et forth. Thus I went on hap|pily for near two months; and I once heard, during this period, a reverend gentleman Mr. G. &s;peak of a man who had departed this life in full a&s;&s;urance of his going to glory I was much a&s;to|ni&s;hed at the a&s;&s;ertion; and did very deliberately inquire how he could get at this knowledge. I was an&s;wered fully, agreeable to what I read in the oracles of truth; and was told al&s;o, that if I did not experience the new birth, and the pardon of my &s;ins, through the
<PB N="103" REF="023353_0307_0FBF44B3B27B0CC8">
blood of Chri&s;t, before I died, I could not enter the kingdom of heaven. I knew not what to think of this report, as I thought I kept eight commandments out of ten; then my worthy interpreter told me I did not do it, nor could I; and he added, that no man ever did or could keep the commandments, with|out offending in one point. I thought this &s;ounded very &s;trange, and puzzled me much for many weeks; for I thought it a hard &s;aying. I then a&s;ked my friend Mr. L&mdash;d, who was a clerk in a chapel, why the commandments of God were given, if we could not be &s;aved by them? To which he replied, <Q>The law is a &s;choolma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t,</Q> who alone could and did keep the commandments, and fufilled all their requirements for his elect people, even tho&s;e to whom he had given a living faith, and the &s;ins of tho&s;e cho&s;en ve&s;&s;els <HI>were already</HI> atoned for and forgiven them whil&s;t living&punc; and if I did not experience the &s;ame before my exit, the Lord would &s;ay at that great day to me, "Go, ye cur&s;ed," &amp;c. &amp;c. for God would appear faithful in his judgments to the wicked, as he would be faithful in &s;hewing mercy to tho&s;e were ordained to it before the

world was; therefore Chri&s;t Je&s;us &s;eem|ed to be all in all to that man's &s;oul. I was much wounded at this di&s;cour&s;e, and brought into &s;uch a dilemma as I never expected. I a&s;ked him, if <HI>he</HI> was to die that moment, whether he was &s;ure to enter the kingdom of God? and added, "Do you <HI>know</HI> that your &s;ins are forgiven you?" He an&s;wered in the affirmative. Then confu&s;ion, anger, and di&s;conted &s;eized me, and I &s;tag|gered much at this &s;ort of doctrine; it brought me to a &s;tand, not knowing which to believe, whether &s;alvation by works, or by faith only in Chri&s;t. I reque&s;ted him to tell me how I might know when my &s;ins were forgiven me. He a&s;&s;ured me he could not, and that none but God alone could do this. I told him it was very my&s;terious; but he &s;aid it was really matter of fact, and quoted many portions of &s;cripture immediately to the point, to which I could make no reply. He then de&s;ired me to pray to God to &s;hew me the&s;e things. I an&s;wered, that I prayed to God every day? he &s;aid, <Q>I perceive you are a churchman.</Q> I an&s;wered I was. He then entreated me to beg of God to &s;hew me what I was, and the true &s;tate of my &s;oul. I thought the prayer
<PB N="105" REF="023353_0309_0FBF44B740278D00">
very &s;hort and odd; &s;o we parted for that time. I weighed all the&s;e things well over, and could not help thinking how it was po&s;&s;ible for a man to know that his &s;ins were forgiven him in this life. I wi&s;hed that God would reveal this &s;elf &s;ame thing unto me. In a &s;hort time after this I went to We&s;tmin&s;ter chapel; the Rev. Mr. P&mdash;preached from Lam. iii. 39. It was a wonderful &s;ermon; he clearly &s;hewed that a liv|ing man had no cau&s;e to complain for the puni&s;hments of his &s;ins; he evident|ly ju&s;tified the Lord in all his dealings with the &s;ons of men; he al&s;o &s;hewed the ju&s;tice of God in the eternal puni&s;h|ment of the wicked and impenitent. The di&s;cour&s;e &s;eemed to me like a two|edged &s;word cutting all ways; it afford|ed me much joy, intermingled with ma|ny fears about my &s;oul; and when it was ended, he gave it out that he intend|ed, the en&s;uing week, to examine all tho&s;e who meant to attend the Lord's ta|ble. Now I thought much of my good works, and at the &s;ame time was doubt|ful of my being a proper object to re|ceive the &s;acrament; I was full of me|ditation till the day of examining.

reverend gentlemen, thinking if I was not right, he would endeavor to con|vince me of it. When I conver&s;ed with him, the fir&s;t thing he a&s;ked me, was, what I knew of Chri&s;t? I told him I be|lieved in him, and had been baptized in his name <Q>Then, &s;aid he, when were you brought to the knowledge of God? and how were you convinced of &s;in?</Q> I knew not what he meant by the&s;e que&s;tions; I told him I kept eight commandments out of ten; but that I &s;ometimes &s;wore on board &s;hip, and &s;ometimes when on &s;hore, and broke the &s;abbath. He then a&s;ked me if I could read? I an&s;wered, 'Yes.'&mdash;'Then,' &s;aid he, 'do you not read in the bible, he that offends in one point is guilty 'of all?' I &s;aid, 'Yes.' Then he a&s;|&s;ured me, that one &s;in unatoned for was as &s;ufficient to damn a &s;oul as one leak was to &s;ink a &s;hip. Here I was &s;truck with awe; for the mini&s;ter exhorted me much, and reminded me of the &s;hortne&s;s of time, and the length of eternity, and that no unregenerate &s;oul, or any thing unclean, could enter the kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>HE did not admit me as a commu|nicant; but recommended me to read the &s;criptures, and hear the word preach|ed,

not to neglect fervent prayer to God, who has promi&s;ed to hear the &s;uppli|cations of tho&s;e who &s;eek him in godly &s;incerity; &s;o I took my leave of him, with many thanks, and re&s;olved to fol|low his advice, &s;o far as the Lord would conde&s;cend to enable me. During this time I was out of employ, nor was I likely to get a &s;ituation &s;uitable for me, which obliged me to go once more to &s;ea. I engaged as &s;teward of a &s;hip called the Hope, Capt. Richard Strange, bound from London to Cadiz in Spain. In a &s;hort time after I was on board I heard the name of God much bla&s;|phemed, and I feared greatly, le&s;t I &s;hould catch the horrible infection. I thought if I &s;inned again, after having life and death &s;et evidently before me, I &s;hould certainly go to hell. My mind was uncommonly chagrined, and I mur|mured much at God's providential deal|ings with me, and was di&s;contented with the commandments, that I could not be &s;aved by what I had done; I hated all things, and wi&s;hed I had never been born; confu&s;ion &s;eized me, and I wi&s;hed to be annihilated. One day I was &s;tanding on the very edge of the &s;tern of the &s;hip, thinking to drown my&s;elf; but this &s;cripture was in&s;tantly

Again I was convinced that the Lord was better to me than I de&s;erved, and I was better off in the world than many. After this I began to fear death; I fretted, mourned, and prayed, till I became a burden to others, but more &s;o to my&s;elf. At length I concluded to beg my bread on &s;hore rather than go again to &s;ea among&s;t a people who feared not God, and I entreated the captain three different times to di&s;|charge me; he would not, but each time gave me greater and greater encou|ragement to continue with him, and all on board &s;hewed me very great civility: notwith&s;tanding all this I was unwilling to embark again. At la&s;t &s;ome of my religious friends advi&s;ed me, by &s;aying it was my lawful calling, con&s;equently it was my duty to obey, and that God was not confined to place, &amp;c. &amp;c. par|ticularly Mr G. S. the governor of Tothil-fields Bridewell, who pitied my ca&s;e, and read the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews to me, with exhortations. He prayed for me, and I believed that he prevailed on my behalf, as my bur|den

was then greatly removed, and I found a heartfelt re&s;ignation to the will of God. The good man gave me a pocket Bible and Alleine's Alarm to the Unconverted. We parted, and the next day I went on board again. We &s;ailed for Spain, and I found favour with the captain It was the fourth of the month of September when we &s;ailed from Lon|don; we had a delightful voyage to Cadiz, where we arrived the twenty|third of the &s;ame month. The place is &s;trong, commands a fine pro&s;pect, and is very rich. The Spani&s;h galloons frequent that port, and &s;ome arrived whil&s;t we were there. I had many op|portunities of reading the &s;criptures. I wre&s;tled hard with God in fervent prayer, who had declared in his word that he would hear the groanings and deep &s;ighs of the poor in &s;pirit. I found this verified to my utter a&s;toni&s;hment and comfort in the following manner.</P>
<P>ON the morning of the 6th of October, (I pray you to attend) all that day, I thought I &s;hould either &s;ee or hear &s;omething &s;upernatural. I had a &s;ecret impul&s;e on my mind of &s;omething that was to take place, which drove me conti|nually for that time to a throne of grace. It plea&s;ed God to enable me to wre&s;tle

with him, as Jacob did: I prayed that if &s;udden death were to happen, and I peri&s;hed, it might be at Chri&s;t's feet.</P>
<P>IN the evening of the &s;ame day, as I was reading and meditating on the 4th chapter of the Acts, twelfth ver&s;e, under the &s;olemn apprehen&s;ions of eternity, and reflecting on my pa&s;t actions, I be|gan to think I had lived a moral life, and that I had a proper ground to be|lieve I had an intere&s;t in the divine fa|vour; but &s;till meditating on the &s;ub|ject, not knowing whether &s;alvation was to be had partly for our own good deeds or &s;olely as the &s;overeign gift of God;&mdash;in this deep con&s;ternation the Lord was plea&s;ed to break in upon my &s;oul with his bright beams of heavenly light; and in an in&s;tant as it were, removing the veil, and letting light into a dark place, I &s;aw clearly with the eye of faith the crucified Saviour bleeding on the cro&s;s on mount Calvary: the &s;criptures be|came an un&s;ealed book, I &s;aw my&s;elf a condemned criminal under the law, which came with its full force to my con&s;cience, and when <Q>the command|ment came &s;in revived, and I died.</Q> I &s;aw the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his humili|ation, loaded and bearing my reproach, &s;in, and &s;hame. I then clearly perceived
<PB N="111" REF="023353_0315_0FBF44CB81416940">
that by the deeds of the law no fle&s;h liv|ing could be ju&s;tified. I was then con|vinced that by the fir&s;t Adam &s;in came, and by the &s;econd Adam (the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t) all that are &s;aved mu&s;t be made alive. It was given me at that time to know what it was to be born again, John iii. 5. I &s;aw the eighth chapter to the Romans, and the doctrines of God's decrees, verified agreeable to his eternal, everla&s;ting, and unchangeable purpo&s;es. The word of God was &s;weet to my ta&s;te, yea &s;weeter than honey and the honeycomb. Chri&s;t was re|vealed to my &s;oul as the chiefe&s;t among ten thou&s;and. The&s;e heavenly moments were really as life to the dead, and what John calls an earne&s;t of the Spi|rit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 13, 14, &amp;c.</NOTE>. This was indeed un&s;peakable, and I firmly believe undeniable by many. Now every leading providential cir|cum&s;tance that happened to me, from the day I was taken from my parents to that hour, was then in my view, as if it had but ju&s;t then occurred. I was &s;en&s;ible of the invi&s;ible hand of God, which guided and protected me when in truth I knew it not: &s;till the Lord pur&s;ued me although I &s;lighted and di&s;regarded it; this mercy melted

me down. When I con&s;idered my poor wretched &s;tate I wept, &s;eeing what a great debtor I was to &s;overeign free grace. Now the Ethiopian was willing to be &s;aved by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the &s;inner's only &s;urety, and al&s;o to rely on none other per&s;on or thing for &s;alva|tion. Self was obnoxious, and good works he had none, for it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do. Oh! the amazing things of that hour can never be told&mdash;it was joy in the Holy Gho&s;t! I felt an a&s;toni&s;hing change; the burden of &s;in, the gaping jaws of hell, and the fears of death, that weighed me down before, now lo&s;t their horror; indeed I thought death would now be the be&s;t earthly friend I ever had. Such were my grief and joy as I believe are &s;eldom expe|rienced. I was bathed in tears, and &s;aid, What am I that God &s;hould look thus look on me the vile&s;t of &s;inners? I felt a deep concern for my mother and friends, which occa&s;ioned me to pray with fre&s;h ardour; and in the a|by&s;s of thought, I viewed the uncon|verted people of the world in a very awful &s;tate, being without God and without hope.</P>
<P>IT plea&s;ed God to pour out on me the

&s;pirit of prayer and the grace of &s;up|plication, &s;o that in loud acclamations I was enabled to prai&s;e and glorify his mo&s;t holy name. When I got out of the cabin, and told &s;ome of the people what th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lord had done for me, alas! who could under&s;tand me or believe my report!&mdash;None but to whom the arm of the Lord was revealed. I became a barbarian to them in talking of the love of Chri&s;t: his name was to me as ointment poured forth: indeed it was &s;weet to my &s;oul, but to them a rock of offence I thought my ca&s;e &s;ingu|lar, and every hour a day until I came to London, for I much longed to be with &s;ome to whom I could tell of the wonders of God's love towards me, and join in prayer to him whom my &s;oul loved and thir&s;ted after. I had uncommon commotions within, &s;uch as few can tell aught about. Now the bible was my only companion and comfort; I prized it much, with many thanks to God that I could read it for my&s;elf, and was not left to be to&s;&s;ed about or led by man's devices and no|tions The worth of a &s;oul cannot be told&mdash;May the Lord give the reader an under&s;tanding in this. Whenever I looked in the bible I &s;aw things new,

and many texts were immediately applied to me with great comfort, for I knew that to me was the word of &s;al|vation &s;ent. Sure I was that the Spi|rit which indited the word opened my heart to receive the truth of it as it is in Je&s;us&mdash;that the &s;ame Spirit enabled me to act faith upon the promi&s;es that were precious to me, and enabled me to believe to the &s;alvation of my &s;oul. By free grace I was per&s;uaded that I had a part in the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, and was enlightened with the "light of the living," Job xxxiii. 30. I wi&s;hed for a man of God with whom I might conver&s;e: my &s;oul was like the chariots of Aminadab, Canticles vi. 12 The&s;e among others, were the precious pro|mi&s;es that were &s;o powerfully applied to me. <Q>All things what&s;oever ye &s;hall a&s;k in prayer, believing, ye &s;hall receive,</Q> Mat. xxi. 22. <Q>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,</Q> John xiv. 27. I &s;aw the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer to be the fountain of life, and the well of &s;al|vation. I experienced him to be all in all; he had brought me by a way that I knew not, and he had made crooked paths &s;traight. Then in his name I &s;et up my Ebenezer, &s;aying, Hitherto be

hath helped me: and could &s;ay to the &s;inners about me, Behold what a Sav|iour I have! Thus I was, by the teaching of that all-glorious Deity, the great One in Three, and Three in One, confirmed in the truths of the bible, tho&s;e oracles of everla&s;ting truth, on which every &s;oul living mu&s;t &s;tand or fall eternally, agreeable to Acts iv. 12. <Q>Neither is there &s;alva|tion in any other, for there is none other name under heaven given a|mong men whereby we mu&s;t be &s;aved, but only Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</Q> May God give the reader a right under|&s;tanding in the&s;e facts! <Q>To him that believeth, all things are po&s;&s;i|ble, but to them that are unbeliev|ing nothing is pure,</Q> Titus i. 15.</P>
<P>DURING this period we remained at Cadiz until our &s;hip got laden. We &s;ailed about the fourth of November; and, having a good pa&s;&s;age, we ar|rived in London the month following, to my comfort, with heartfelt grati|tude to God for his rich and un&s;peaka|ble mercies.</P>
<P>ON my return I had but one text which puzzled me, or that the devil endeavoured to buffet me with, viz. Rom. xi. 6. and, as I had heard of

One day I went to Blackfriars church, and, to my great &s;atisfaction and &s;urpri&s;e, he preached from that very text. He ve|ry clearly &s;hewed the difference be|tween human works and free election which is according to God's &s;overeign will and plea&s;ure, The&s;e glad tidings &s;et me entirely at liberty, and I went out of the church rejoicing, &s;eeing my &s;pots were tho&s;e of God's Children.

<P>WHEN our &s;hip was got ready for &s;ea again, I was entreated by the captain to go in her once more; but as I felt my&s;elf now as happy as I could wi&s;h to be in this life, I for &s;ome time refu&s;ed; however, the advice of my friends at la&s;t prevailed; and, in full re&s;ignation to the will of God, I again embarked for Cadiz; in March 1775. We had a very good pa&s;&s;age, without any material accident, until we arrived off the Bay of Cadiz? when one Sun|day, ju&s;t as we were going into the har|bour, the &s;hip &s;truck again&s;t a rock and knocked off a garboard plank, which is the next to the keel. In an in&s;tant all hands were in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, and began with loud cries to call on God to have mercy on them. Although I could not &s;wim, and &s;aw no way of e&s;caping death, I felt no
<PB N="123" REF="023353_0327_0FBF44EFB5C68678">
dread in my then &s;ituation, having no de&s;ire to live. I even rejoiced in &s;pirit, thinking this death would be &s;udden glory. But the fulne&s;s of time was not yet come. The people near to me were much a&s;toni&s;hed in &s;eeing me thus calm and re&s;igned; but I told them of the peace of God, which through &s;overeign grace I enjoyed, and the&s;e words were that in&s;tant in my mind:
<Q><L>Chri&s;t is my pilot wi&s;e, my compa&s;s is his word:</L>
<L>My &s;oul each &s;torm defies, while <HI>I</HI> have &s;uch:</L>
<L>Lord.</L>
<L>I tru&s;t his faithfulne&s;s and power,</L>
<L>To &s;ave me in the trying hour.</L>
<L>Though rocks and quick&s;ands deep through all my pa&s;&s;age lie.</L>
<L>Yet Chri&s;t &s;hall &s;afely keep and guide me with 'his eye,</L>
<L>How can I &s;ink with &s;uch a prop,</L>
<L>That bears the world and all things up.</L></Q></P>
<P>AT this time there were many large Spani&s;h flukers or pa&s;&s;age-ve&s;&s;els full of people cro&s;&s;ing the channel; who &s;eeing our condition, a number of them came along&s;ide of us. As many hands as could be employed began to work; &s;ome at our three pumps, and the re&s;t unloading the &s;hip as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. There being only a &s;ingle rock called the Porpus on which we &s;truck; we &s;oon
<PB N="124" REF="023353_0328_0FBF44F1210F5548">
got off it, and providentially it was then high water, we therefore run the &s;hip a&s;hore at the neare&s;t place to keep her from &s;inking. After many tides, with a great deal of care and indu&s;try, we got her repaired again. When we had di&s;patched our bu&s;ine&s;s at Cadiz, we went to Gibraltar, and from thence to Malaga, a very plea&s;ant and rich city, where there is one of the fine&s;t cathe|drals I had ever &s;een. It had been above fifty years in building, as I heard, though it was not then quite fini&s;hed; great parts of the in&s;ide, however, was completed and highly decorated with the riche&s;t marble columns and many &s;uperb paintings; it was lighted occa|&s;ionally by an amazing number of wax tapers of different &s;izes, &s;ome of which were as thick as a man's thigh; the&s;e, however, were only u&s;ed on &s;ome of their grand fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>I was very much &s;hocked at the cu&s;tom of bull-baiting, and other di|ver&s;ions which prevailed here on Sun|day evenings, to the great &s;candal of Chri&s;tianity and morals. I u&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s my abhorrence of it to a prie&s;t whom I met with. I had frequent conte&s;ts about religion with the reve|rend father, in which he took great
<PB N="125" REF="023353_0329_0FBF44F2BB3E0FB8">
pains to make a pro&s;elyte of me to his church; and I no le&s;s to convert him to mine. On the&s;e occa&s;ions I u&s;ed to produce my Bible, and &s;hew him in what points his church erred. He then &s;aid he had been in England, and that every per&s;on there read the Bible, which was very wrong; but I an&s;wer|ed him that Chri&s;t de&s;ired us to &s;earch the Scriptures. In his zeal for my con|ver&s;ion, he &s;olicited me to go to one of the univer&s;ities in Spain, and de|clared that I &s;hould have my educa|tion free; and told me, if I got my|&s;elf made a prie&s;t, I might in time become even pope; and that Pope Benedict was a black man. As I was ever de&s;irous of learning, I pau&s;ed for &s;ome time upon this temptation; and thought by being crafty I might catch &s;ome with guile; but I began to think that it would be only hypocri&s;y in me to embrace his offer, as I could not in con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cience conform to the opinions of his church. I was therefore enabled to regard the word of God, which &s;ays, "Come out from among&s;t them," and refu&s;ed Father Vincent's offer. So we parted without conviction on either &s;ide.</P>

wines, fruits, and money, we pro|ceeded to Cadiz, where we took about two ton's more of money, &amp;c. and then &s;ailed for England in the month of June. When we were about the north latitude 42, we had contrary wind for &s;everal days and the &s;hip did not make in that time above &s;ix or &s;even miles &s;trait cour&s;e. This made the captain exceeding fretful and peevi&s;h: and I was very &s;orry to hear God's mo&s;t holy name often bla&s;phemed by him. One day as he was in that impious mood, a young gentleman on board who was a pa&s;&s;enger, reproached him, and &s;aid he acted wrong; for we ought to be thankful to God for all things, as we were not in want of any thing on board; and though the wind was contrary for us, yet it was fair for &s;ome others, who, perhaps, &s;tood in more need of it than we. I immediately &s;econded this young gentleman with &s;ome bold|ne&s;s, and &s;aid we had not the lea&s;t cau&s;e to murmur, for that the Lord was better to us than we de&s;erved, and that he had done all things well. I expected that the captain would be ve|ry angry with me for &s;peaking, but he replied not a word. However, before that time on the following day, being
<PB N="127" REF="023353_0331_0FBF44F9434284B8">
the 21&s;t of June, much to our great joy and a&s;toni&s;hment, we &s;aw the pro|vidential hand of our benign Creator, who&s;e ways with his blind creatures are pa&s;t finding out. The preceding night I dreamed that I &s;aw a boat im|mediately off the &s;tarboard main &s;hrouds; and exactly at half pa&s;t one o'clock, the following day at noon, while I was below, ju&s;t as we had dined in the cabin, the man at the helm cried out, A boat! which brought my dream that in&s;tant into my mind, I was the fir&s;t man that jumped on the deck; and looking from the &s;hrouds onward, according to my dream, I de&s;cried a little boat at &s;ome di&s;tance; but as the waves were high, it was as much as we could do &s;ometimes to di&s;|cern her; we however &s;topped the &s;hips way, and the boat, which was extreme|ly &s;mall, came along &s;ide with eleven mi|&s;erable men, whom we took on board immediately. To all human appear|ance, the&s;e people mu&s;t have peri&s;hed in the cour&s;e of one hour or le&s;s, the boat being &s;mall, it barely con|tained them. When we took them up they were half drowned, and had no victuals, compa&s;s, water, or any other nece&s;&s;ary what&s;oever, and had only one
<PB N="128" REF="023353_0332_0FBF44FAC8490860">
bit of an oar to &s;teer with, and that right before the wind; &s;o that they were obliged to tru&s;t entirely to the mercy of the waves. As &s;oon as we got them all on board, they bowed them&s;elves on their knees, and, with hands and voices lifted up to heaven, thanked God for their deliverance; and I tru&s;t that my prayers were not wanting among&s;t them at the &s;ame time. This mercy of the Lord quite melted me, and I recollected his words which I &s;aw thus verified in the 107th P&s;alm, <Q>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever. Hungry and thir&s;ty, their &s;ouls fainted in them. They cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation. O that men would prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;s and for his wonderful works to the children of men! For he &s;atisfieth the longing &s;oul, and filleth the hungry &s;oul with goodne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Such as fit in darkne&s;s and in the &s;hadow of death:</Q></P>
<P><Q>Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he &s;aved them out

of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es. They that go down to the &s;ea in &s;hips; that do bu|&s;ine&s;s in great waters: the&s;e &s;ee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. Who&s;o is wife and will ob&s;erve the&s;e things, even they &s;hall under&s;tand the loving kindne&s;s of the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>The poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed captain &s;aid, <Q>that the Lord is good; for, &s;eeing that I am not fit to die, he therefore gave me a &s;pace of time to repent.</Q> I was very glad to hear this expre&s;&s;ion, and took an opportunity when conveni|ent of talking to him on the providence of God. They told us they were Por|tugue&s;e, and were in a brig loaded with corn, which &s;hifted that morning at five o'clock, owing to which the ve&s;&s;el &s;unk that in&s;tant with two of the crew; and how the&s;e eleven got into the boat (which was la&s;hed to the deck) not one of them could tell. We provided them with every nece&s;&s;ary, and brought them all &s;afe to London: and I hope the Lord gave them repentance unto life eternal.</P>
<P>I was happy once more among&s;t my friends and brethren, till November, when my old friend, the celebrated Doctor Irving, bought a remarkable
<PB N="130" REF="023353_0334_0FBF45040877A9E0">
fine &s;loop, about 150 tons. He had a mind for a new adventure in cultivat|ing a plantation at Jamaica, and the Mu&s;quito Shore; a&s;ked me to go with him, and &s;aid that he would tru&s;t me with his e&s;tate in preference to any one. By the advice, therefore, of my friends, I accepted of the offer, knowing that the harve&s;t was fully ripe in tho&s;e parts, and hoped to be an in&s;trument under God, of bringing &s;ome poor &s;inner to my well beloved ma&s;ter, Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Before I embarked, I found with the Doctor four Mu&s;quito Indians, who were chiefs in their own country, and were brought here by &s;ome Engli&s;h tra|ders for &s;ome &s;elfi&s;h ends. One of them was the Mu&s;quito king's &s;on; a youth of about eighteen years of age; and whil&s;t he was here he was baptized by the name of George. They were go|ing back at the government's expen&s;e, after having been in England about twelve months, during which they learned to &s;peak pretty good Engli&s;h. When I came to talk to them about eightdays before we &s;ailed, I was very much mortified in finding that they had not frequented any churches &s;ince they were here, to be baptized, nor was any attention paid to their morals. I
<PB N="131" REF="023353_0335_0FBF45054EB41190">
was very &s;orry for this mock Chri&s;tia|nity, and had ju&s;t an opportunity to take &s;ome of them once to church before we &s;ailed. We embarked in the month of November 1776, on board of the &s;loop Morning Star, Captain David Miller, and &s;ailed for Jamaica. In our pa&s;&s;age, I took all the pains that I could to in|&s;truct the Indian prince in the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, of which he was entire|ly ignorant; and, to my great joy, he was quite attentive, and received with gladne&s;s the truths that the Lord enabled me to &s;et forth to him. I taught him in the compa&s;s of eleven days all the letters, and he could put even two or three of them together and &s;pell them. I had Fox's Martyrology with cuts, and he u&s;ed to be very fond of looking into it, and would a&s;k many que&s;tions about the papal cruelties he &s;aw depict|ed there, which I explained to him. I made &s;uch progre&s;s with this youth, e&s;pecially in religion, that when I u&s;ed to go to bed at different hours of the night, if he was in his bed, he would get up on purpo&s;e to go to prayer with me, without any other clothes than his &s;hirt; and before he would eat any of his meals among the gentlemen in the cabin, he would fir&s;t come to me to
<PB N="132" REF="023353_0336_0FBF4506E3B6D668">
pray as he called it. I was well plea&s;ed at this, and took great delight in him, and u&s;ed much &s;upplication to God for his conver&s;ion. I was in full hope of &s;eeing da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly every appearance of that change which I could wi&s;h; not know|ing the devices of &s;atan, who had ma|ny of his emi&s;&s;aries to &s;ow his tares as fa&s;t as I &s;owed the good &s;eed, and pull down as fa&s;t as I built up. Thus we went on nearly four fifths of our pa&s;&s;age, when &s;atan at la&s;t got the up|per hand. Some of his me&s;&s;engers, &s;eeing this poor heathen much advan|ced in piety, began to a&s;k him whether I had converted him to Chri&s;tianity, laughed and made their je&s;t at him, for which I rebuked them as much as I could; but this treatment cau&s;ed the prince to halt between two opinions. Some of the true &s;ons of Belial, who did not believe that there was any hereaf|ter, told him never to fear the devil, for there was none exi&s;ting; and if ever he came to the prince, they de&s;ired he might be &s;ent to them. Thus they teazed the poor innocent youth, &s;o that he would not learn his book any more! He would not drink nor carou&s;e with the&s;e ungodly actors, nor would he be with me, even at prayers. This grieved
<PB N="133" REF="023353_0337_0FBF450DE94575D0">
me very much. I endeavored to per|&s;uade him as well as I could, but he would not come; and entreated him very much to tell me his rea&s;ons for act|ing thus At la&s;t he a&s;ked me, <Q>How comes it that all the white men on board who can read and write, and ob&s;erve the &s;un, and know all things, yet &s;wear, lie, and get drunk, only ex|cepting your&s;elf?</Q> I an&s;wered him, the rea&s;on was, that they did not fear God; and that if any one of them died &s;o they could not go to, or be happy with God. He replied, that if the&s;e per&s;ons went to hell he would go to hell too. I was &s;orry to hear this; and, as he &s;ome|times had the tooth-ach, and al&s;o &s;ome other per&s;ons in the &s;hip at the &s;ame time. I a&s;ked him if their tooth-ach made his ea&s;y: he &s;aid, No. Then I told him if he and the&s;e people went to hell together, their pains would not make his any lighter. This an&s;wer had great weight with him: it depre&s;&s;ed his &s;pirits much; and he became ever after, during the pa&s;&s;age, fond of being alone. When we were in the latitude of Martinico, and near making the land, one morning we had a bri&s;k gale of wind, and, carrying too much &s;ail, the main-ma&s;t went over the &s;ide.
<PB N="134" REF="023353_0338_0FBF4510F33FF308">
Many people were then all about the deck, and the yards, ma&s;ts, and rig|ging came tumbling all about us, yet there was not one of us in the lea&s;t hurt, although &s;ome were within a hairs' breadth of being killed: and, particu|larly, I &s;aw two men who, by the provi|dential hand of God, were mo&s;t miracu|lou&s;ly pre&s;erved from being &s;ma&s;hed to pieces. On the fifth of January we made Antigua and Mont&s;errat, and ran along the re&s;t of the i&s;lands: and on the fourteenth we arrived at Jamaica. One Sunday while we were there I took the Mu&s;quito Prince George to Church, where he &s;aw the &s;acrament admini&s;|tered. When we came out we &s;aw all kinds of people, almo&s;t from the church door for the &s;pace of half a mile down to the water&s;ide, buying and &s;elling all kinds of commodities: and the&s;e acts afforded me great matter of exhortation to this youth, who was much a&s;toni&s;hed. Our ve&s;&s;el being ready to &s;ail for the Mu&s;quito &s;hore, I went with the Doctor on board a Guinea-man, to purcha&s;e &s;ome &s;laves to carry with us, and cul|tivate a plantation; and I cho&s;e them all my own countrymen. On the 12th of February we &s;ailed from Jamaica, and on the eighteenth arrived at the
<PB N="135" REF="023353_0339_0FBF451201D20C98">
Mu&s;quito &s;hore, at a place called Du|peupy. All our Indian gue&s;ts now, after I had admoni&s;hed them and a few ca&s;es of liquor given them by the Doc|tor, took an affectionate leave of us, and went a&s;hore, where they were met by the Mu&s;quito king, and we never &s;aw one of them afterwards. We then &s;ailed to the &s;outhward of the &s;hore, to a place called Cape Gracias a Dios, where there was a large lagoon or lake, which received the emptying of two or three very fine large rivers, and abounded much in fi&s;h and land tor|toi&s;e. Some of the native Indians came on board of us here; and we u&s;ed them well, and told them we were come to dwell among&s;t them, which they &s;eemed plea&s;ed at. So the Doctor and I, with &s;ome others, went with them a&s;hore; and they took us to different places to view the land, in order to choo&s;e a place to make a plantation of. We fixed on a &s;pot near a river's bank, in a rich &s;oil; and, having got our nece&s;&s;aries out of the &s;loop, we began to clear away the woods, and plant different kinds of vegetables, which had a quick growth. While we were emyloyed in this man|ner, our ve&s;&s;el went north ward to Black River to trade. While &s;he was there,
<PB N="136" REF="023353_0340_0FBF4513CAF607C0">
a Spani&s;h guarda co&s;ta met with and took her. This proved very hurtful, and a great embarra&s;&s;ment to us. How|ever, we went on with the culture of the land. We u&s;ed to make fires every night all around us, to keep off wild bea&s;ts, which, as &s;oon as it was dark, &s;et up a mo&s;t hideous roaring. Our habitation being far up in the woods, we frequently &s;aw different kinds of animals; but none of them ever hurt us, except poi&s;onous &s;nakes, the bite of which the Doctor u&s;ed to cure by giving to the patient as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, about half a tumbler of &s;trong rum, with a good deal of Cayenne pepper in it. In this manner he cured two natives and one of his own &s;laves. The indians were exceedingly fond of the Doctor, and they had good rea&s;on for it; for I believe they never had &s;uch an u&s;eful man among&s;t them. They came from all quarters to our dwelling; and &s;ome <HI>woolwow</HI> or flat-headed indians, who liv|ed fifty or &s;ixty miles above our river, &amp; this &s;ide of the South Sea, brought us a good deal of &s;ilver in exchange for our goods. The principal articles we could get from our neighbouring indians, were turtle oil, and &s;hells, little &s;ilk gra&s;s, and &s;ome provi&s;ions; but they would
<PB N="137" REF="023353_0341_0FBF451BA0D03908">
not work at any thing for us, except fi&s;hing; and a few times they a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed to cut &s;ome trees down, in order to build us hou&s;es; which they did exactly like the Africans, by the joint labour of men, women, and children. I do not recollect, any of them to have had more than two wives. The&s;e always accompanied their hu&s;bands when they came to our dwelling, and then they generally carried whatever they brought to us, and always &s;quatted down be|hind their hu&s;bands. Whenever we gave them any thing to eat, the men and their wives eat &s;eperate. I never &s;aw the lea&s;t &s;ign of incontinence among&s;t them. The women are ornamented with beads, and fond of painting them&s;elves; the men al&s;o paint. even to exce&s;s, both their faces and &s;hirts: their favourite colour is red. The women generally cultivate the ground, and the men are all fi&s;hermen and canoe makers. Upon the whole, I never met any nation that were &s;o &s;imple in their manners as the&s;e people, or had &s;o little ornament in their hou&s;es. Neither had they, as I ever could learn, one word expre&s;&s;ive of an oath. The wor&s;t word I ever heard among&s;t them when they were quarrel|ling, was one that they had got from the
<PB N="138" REF="023353_0342_0FBF451D0DE65598">
Engli&s;h, which was 'you ra&s;cal. 'I never &s;aw any mode of wor&s;hip among them; but in this they were not wor&s;e than their European brethren or neighbours, for I am &s;orry to &s;ay that there was not one white per&s;on in our dwelling, nor any were el&s;e, that I &s;aw, in different places I was at on the &s;hore, that was better or more pious than tho&s;e un|enlightened indians; but they either worked or &s;lept on Sundays: and, to my &s;orrow, working was too much Sunday's employment with our&s;elves, &s;o much &s;o, that in &s;ome length of time we really did not know one day from another. This mode of living laid the foundation of my decamping at la&s;t. The natives are well made and warlike; and they particularly boa&s;t of having never been conquered by the Spaniards. They are great drinkers of &s;trong liquors when they can get them. We u&s;ed to di&s;til rum from pine apples, which were very plentiful here, and then we could not get them away from our place.' Yet they &s;eemed to be &s;in|gular, in point of hone&s;ty, above any other nation I was ever among&s;t. The country being hot, we lived under an open &s;hed, where we had all kinds of goods, without a door or a lock to any

article; yet we &s;lept in &s;afety, and never lo&s;t any thing, or were di&s;turbed. This &s;urpri&s;ed us a good deal; and the Doctor, my&s;elf, and others, u&s;ed to &s;ay if we were to lie in that manner in Europe we &s;hould have our throats cut the fir&s;t night. The indian governor goes once in a certain time all about the province or di&s;trict, and has a number of men with him as attendants and a&s;&s;i&s;tants. He &s;ettles all the differences among the people, like the judge here, and is treated with very great re&s;pect He took care to give us timely notice before he came to our habitation, by &s;ending his &s;tick as a token, for rum, &s;ugar, and gunpowder, which we did not re|fu&s;e &s;ending; and at the &s;ame time we made the utmo&s;t preparation to receive his honour and his train. When he came with his tribe, and all our neigh|bouring chieftians, we expected to find him a grave reverend judge, &s;olid and &s;agacious; but in&s;tead of that, before he and his gang came in &s;ight, we heard them very clamorous; and they even had plundered &s;ome of our good neighbouring indians, having intoxi|cated them&s;elves with our liquor. When they arrived we did not know what to make of our new gue&s;ts, and would

gladly have di&s;pen&s;ed with the honor of their company However, having no alternative, we fea&s;ted them plen|tifully all the day till the evening; when the governor, getting quite drunk, grew very unruly, and &s;truck one of our mo&s;t friendly chiefs who was our neare&s;t neighbour, and al&s;o took his gold-laced hat from him. At this a great commotion taken place; and the Doctor interferred to make peace, as we could all under&s;tand one another, but to no purpo&s;e; and at la&s;t they became &s;o outrageous that the Doctor, fearing he might get into trouble, left the hou&s;e, and made the be&s;t of his way to the neare&s;t wood, leaving me to do as well as I could among them. I was &s;o enraged with the governor, that I could have wi&s;hed to have &s;een him tied fa&s;t to a tree and flogged for his behaviour; but I had not people enough to cope with his party. I therefore thought of a &s;tratagem to appea&s;e the riot. Recollecting a pa&s;&s;age I had read in the life of Columbus, when he was among&s;t the Indians in Mexico or Peru, where on &s;ome occa&s;ion, he frightened them, by telling them of certain events in the Heavens, I had recour&s;e to the &s;ame expedient; and it &s;ucceeded be|yond

my mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. When I had formed my determination, I went in the mid&s;t of them; and, tak|ing hold of the Governor, I pointed up to the Heaven I menanced him and the re&s;t: I told them God lived there, and that he was angry with them, and they mu&s;t not quarrel &s;o; that they were all brothers, and if they did not leave off, and go away quietly, I would take the book (point|ing to the Bible) read, and <HI>tell</HI> God to make them dead. This operated on them like magic.&mdash;The clamour im|mediately cea&s;ed, and I gave them &s;ome rum and a few other things; after which they went away peaceably; and the Governor afterwards gave our neighbour, who was called Captain Pla&s;mahy, his hat again. When the Doctor returned, he was exceedingly glad at my &s;ucce&s;s in thus getting rid of our trouble&s;ome gue&s;ts. The Mu&s;|quito people within our vicinity, out of re&s;pect to the Doctor, my&s;elf, and his people, made entertainments of the grand kind, called in their tongue <HI>tourrie</HI> or <HI>dryekbo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> The Engli&s;h of this expre&s;&s;ion is, a fea&s;t of drinking about. of which it &s;eems a corruption of lan|guage.

apples roa&s;ted, and ca&s;ades chewed or beaten in mortars; which, after lying &s;ometime, ferments, and becomes &s;o &s;trong as to intoxicate, when drank in any quantity. We had timely notice given to us of the entertainment. A white family, within five miles of us, told us how the drink was made, and I and two others went before the time to the village, where the mirth was ap|pointed to be held, and there we &s;aw the whole art of making the drink, and al&s;o the kind of animals that were to be eaten there. I cannot &s;ay the &s;ight of either the drink or the meat were enticing to me. They had &s;ome thou|&s;ands of pine apples roa&s;ting, which they &s;queezed dirt and all, into a canoe they had there for the purpo&s;e. The ca&s;ade drink was in beef barrels, and other ve&s;&s;els, and looked exactly like hog-wa&s;h. Men, women and children, were thus employed in roa&s;ting the pine apples, and &s;queezing them with their hands. For food they had many land torpins or tortoi&s;es, &s;ome dried turtle, and three large alligators alive, and tied fa&s;t to the trees. I a&s;ked the people what they were going to do with the&s;e alligators; and I was told they were to be eaten. I was much &s;urpri&s;|ed

at this, and went home, not a little di&s;gu&s;ted at the preparations. When the day of the fea&s;t was come, we took &s;ome rum with us, and went to the ap|pointed place, where we found a great a&s;&s;emblage of the&s;e people, who re|ceived us very kindly The mirth had begun before we came; and they were dancing with mu&s;ic: and the mu&s;ical in&s;truments were nearly the &s;ame as tho&s;e of any other &s;able people; but, as I thought, much le&s;s melodious than any other nation I ever knew. They had many curious ge&s;tures in dancing, and a variety of motions and po&s;tures of their bodies, which to me were in no wi&s;e attracting. The males danced by them&s;elves, and the females al&s;o by them&s;elves, as with us. The Doctor &s;hewed his people the example, by im|mediately joining the women's party, though not by their choice. On per|ceiving the women di&s;gu&s;ted, he joined the males. At night there were great illuminations, by &s;etting fire to many pine trees, while the drickbot went round merrily by calaba&s;hes or gourds: but the liquor might more ju&s;tly be called eating than drinking One Ow|den, the olde&s;t father in the vicinity, was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;trange and terrifying

form. Around his body were &s;kins adorned with different kinds of feathers, and he had on his head a very large and high head-piece, in the form of a gre|nadier's cap, with prickles like a por|cupine: and he made a certain noi&s;e which re&s;embled the cry of an alligator. Our people &s;kipped among&s;t them out of complai&s;ance, though &s;ome could not drink of their tourrie; but our rum met with cu&s;tomers enough, and was &s;oon gone. The alligators were killed and &s;ome of them roa&s;ted. Their man|ner of roa&s;ting is by digging a hole in the earth, and filling it with wood, which they burn to coal, and then they lay &s;ticks acro&s;s, on which they &s;et the meat. I had a raw piece of the alligator in my hand: it was very rich: I thought it looked like fre&s;h &s;almon, and it had a mo&s;t fragrant &s;mell, but I could not eat any of it. This merry-making at la&s;t ended without the lea&s;t di&s;cord in any per&s;on in the company, although it was made up of different nations and complexions.</P>

away. I thought this was in &s;ome mea&s;ure a judgment upon us for work|ing on Sundays, and it hurt my mind very much. I often wi&s;hed to leave this place and &s;ail for Europe; for our mode of procedure and living in this heatheni&s;h form was very irk &s;ome to me.

<P>THOUGH I was much attached to the Doctor, I was happy when he con&s;ented. I got every thing ready for my depar|ture, and hired &s;ome Indians, with a large canoe, to carry me off. All my poor countrymen, the &s;laves, when they heard of my leaving them, were very &s;orry, as I had always treated them with care and affection, and did every thing I could to comfort the poor creatures, and render their condition ea&s;y. Hav|ing taken leave of my old friends and companions, on the 18th of June, ac|companied by the Doctor, I left that &s;pot of the world, and went &s;outhward above twenty miles along the river. There I found a &s;loop, the captain of which told me he was going to Jamaica. Having agreed for my pa&s;&s;age with him and one of the owners, who was al&s;o on board, named Hughes, the Doctor and I parted, not without &s;hed|ding tears on both &s;ides. The ve&s;&s;el then &s;ailed along the river till night, when &s;he &s;topped in a lagoon within the &s;ame river. During the night a &s;chooner
<PB N="147" REF="023353_0351_0FBF40F537B5CF70">
belonging to the &s;ame owners came in, and, as &s;he was in want of hands, Hughes, the owner of the &s;loop a&s;ked me to go in the &s;chooner as a &s;ailor, and &s;aid he would give me wages. I thanked him; but I &s;aid I wanted to go to Jamaica. He then immediately changed his tone, and &s;wore, and abu&s;ed me very much, and a&s;ked how I came to be freed. I told him, and &s;aid that I came into that vicinity with Dr. Irving; whom he had &s;een that day. This account was of no u&s;e; he &s;till &s;wore exceedingly at me, and cur&s;ed the ma&s;|ter for a fool that &s;old me my freedom, and the Doctor for another in letting me go from him. Then he de&s;ired me to go in the &s;chooner, or el&s;e I &s;hould not go out of the &s;loop as a free-man. I &s;aid this was very hard, and begged to be put on &s;hore again; but he &s;wore that I &s;hould not. I &s;aid I had been twice among&s;t the Turks, yet had never &s;een any &s;uch u&s;age with them, and much le&s;s could I have expected any thing of this kind among the Chri&s;|tians. This incen&s;ed him exceedingly; and, with a volley of oaths and impre|cations, he replied, <Q>Chri&s;tians! damn you, you are one of St. Paul's men; but by G&mdash;, except you have St. Paul's or St. Peter's faith, and walk
<PB N="148" REF="023353_0352_0FBF40F825C10618">
upon the water to the &s;hore, you &s;hall not go out of the ve&s;&s;el;</Q> which I now learnt was going among&s;t the Spaniards towards Carthagena, where he &s;wore he would &s;ell me. I &s;imply a&s;ked him what right he had to &s;ell me? but, without another word, he made &s;ome of his people tie ropes round each of my ancles, and al&s;o to each wri&s;t, and another rope round my body, and hoi&s;ted me up without letting my feet touch or re&s;t upon any thing. Thus I hung, without any crime committed, and without judge or jury; merely be|cau&s;e I was a free man, and could not by the law get any redre&s;s from a white per&s;on in tho&s;e parts of the world. I was in great pain from my &s;ituation, and cried and begged very hard for &s;ome mercy; but all in vain. My tyrant, in a great rage brought a mu&s;|quet out of the cabin and loaded it before me and the crew, and &s;wore that he would &s;hoot me if I cried any more. I had now no alternative; I therefore remained &s;ilent, &s;eeing not one white man on board who &s;aid a word on my behalf. I hung in that manner from between ten and eleven o'clock at night till about one in the morning; when, finding my cruel abu&s;er fa&s;t a&s;leep, I
<PB N="149" REF="023353_0353_0FBF40F9831B1AE0">
begged &s;ome of his &s;laves to &s;lack the rope that was round my body, that my feet might re&s;t on &s;omething. This they did at the ri&s;k of being cruelly u&s;ed by their ma&s;ter, who beat &s;ome of them &s;everely at fir&s;t for not tying me when he commanded them. Whil&s;t I remained in this condition, till be|tween five and &s;ix o'clock next morn|ing, I tru&s;t I prayed to God to forgive this bla&s;phemer who cared not what he did, but when he got up out of his &s;leep in the morning was of the very &s;ame temper and di&s;po&s;ition as when he left me at night. When they got up the anchor, and the ve&s;&s;el was get|ting under way, I once more cried and begged to be relea&s;ed; and now, being fortunately in the way of their hoi&s;ting the &s;ails, they relea&s;ed me. When I was let down, I &s;poke to one Mr. Cox, a carpenter, whom I knew on board, on the impropriety of this conduct. He al&s;o knew the doctor, and the good opinion he ever had of me. This man then went to the captain, and told him not to carry me away in that manner; that I was the doctor's &s;teward, who regarded me very highly, and would re&s;ent this u&s;age when he &s;hould come to know it. On which he de&s;ired a
<PB N="150" REF="023353_0354_0FBF40FBD0E1C318">
young man to put me a&s;hore in a &s;mall canoe I brought with me. This &s;ound gladdened my heart, and I got ha&s;tily into the canoe and &s;et off, whil&s;t my tyrant was down in the cabin; but he &s;oon &s;pied me out, when I was not above thirty or forty yards from the ve&s;&s;el, and running upon the deck with a loaded mu&s;quet in his hand, he pre|&s;ented it at me, and &s;wore heavily and dreadfully, that he would &s;hoot me that in&s;tant, if I did not come back on board. As I knew the wretch would have done as he &s;aid, without he&s;itation I put back to the ve&s;&s;el again; but, as the good Lord would have it, ju&s;t as I was along&s;ide he was abu&s;ing the captain for letting me go from the ve&s;|&s;el; which the captain returned, and both of them &s;oon got into a very great heat. The young man that was with me now got out of the canoe; the ve&s;|&s;el was &s;ailing on fa&s;t with a &s;mooth &s;ea: and I then thought it was neck or no|thing, &s;o at that in&s;tant I &s;et off again, for my life, in the canoe, towards the &s;hore; and fortunately the confu&s;ion was &s;o great among&s;t them on board, that I got out of the mu&s;quet &s;hot un|noticed, while the ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed on with a fair wind a different way; &s;o that
<PB N="151" REF="023353_0355_0FBF40FD434F1F48">
they could not overtake me without tacking: but even before that could be done I &s;hould have been on &s;hore, which I &s;oon reached, with many thanks to God for this unexpected de|liverance. I then went and told the other owner, who lived near that &s;hore (with whom I had agreed for my pa&s;|&s;age) of the u&s;age I had met with. He was very much a&s;toni&s;hed and ap|peared &s;orry for it. After treating me with kindne&s;s, he gave me &s;ome re|fre&s;hment, and three heads of roa&s;ted Indian corn, for a voyage of about 18 miles &s;outh to look for another ve&s;&s;el. He then directed me to an Indian chief of a di&s;trict, who was al&s;o the Mu&s;|quito admiral, and had once been at our dwelling; after which I &s;et off with the canoe acro&s;s a large lagoon alone (for I could not get any one to a&s;&s;i&s;t me), though I was much jaded, and had pains in my bowels, by means of the rope I had hung by the night before. I was therefore at different times unable to manage the canoe, for the paddling was very laborious. However, a little before dark I got to my de&s;tined place, where &s;ome of the Indians knew me, and received me kindly. I a&s;ked for the admiral; and
<PB N="152" REF="023353_0356_0FBF4107400ABE00">
they conducted me to his dwelling. He was glad to &s;ee me, and refre&s;hed me with &s;uch things as the place afforded; and I had a hammock to &s;leep in. They acted towards me more like Chri&s;tians than tho&s;e whites I was among&s;t the la&s;t night, though they had been bapti&s;ed. I told the admiral I wanted to go to the next port to get a ve&s;&s;el to carry me to Jamaica; and reque&s;ted him to &s;end the canoe back which I then had, for which I was to pay him. He agreed with me, and &s;ent five able Indians with a large canoe to carry my things to my intended place, about fifty miles; and we &s;et off the next morning. When we got out of the lagoon and went along &s;hore, the &s;ea was &s;o high that the canoe was oftentimes very near being filled with water We were obliged to go a&s;hore and drag acro&s;s different necks of land; we were al&s;o two nights in the &s;wamps, which &s;warmed with mu&s;quito flies, and they proved trouble&s;ome to us. This tire&s;ome journey of land and wa|ter ended, however, on the third day, to my great joy; and I got on board of a &s;loop commanded by one Captain Jenning. She was then partly loaded, and he told me he was expecting daily
<PB N="153" REF="023353_0357_0FBF410944BC99C8">
to &s;ail for Jamaica; and having agreed with me to work my pa&s;&s;age, I went to work accordingly. I was not many days on board before we &s;ailed; but to my &s;orrow and di&s;appointment, though u&s;ed to &s;uch tricks, we went to the &s;outhward along the Mu&s;quito &s;hore, in&s;tead of &s;teering for Jamaica. I was compelled to a&s;&s;i&s;t in cutting a great deal of mahogany wood on the &s;hore as we coa&s;ted along it, and load the ve&s;&s;el with it, before &s;he &s;ailed. This fretted me much; but, as I did not know how to help my&s;elf among the&s;e deceivers, I thought patience was the only remedy I had left, and even that was forced. There was much hard work and little victuals on board; except by good luck we happened to catch turtles On this coa&s;t there was al&s;o a particular kind of fi&s;h called manatee, which is mo&s;t ex|cellent eating, and the fle&s;h is more like beef than fi&s;h; the &s;cales are as large as a &s;hilling, and the &s;kin thicker than I ever &s;aw that of any other fi&s;h. Within the bracki&s;h waters along &s;hore there were likewi&s;e va&s;t numbers of alli|gators, which made the fi&s;h &s;carce. I was on board this &s;loop &s;ixteen days, during which, in our coa&s;ting, we came to another place, where there was a
<PB N="154" REF="023353_0358_0FBF410AC83C8540">
&s;maller &s;loop called the Indian Queen, commanded by one John Baker. He al&s;o was an Engli&s;hman, and had been a long time along the &s;hore trading for turtle &s;hells and &s;ilver, and had got a good quantity of each on board. He wanted &s;ome hands very much; and, un|der&s;tanding I was a free man, and want|ed to go Jamaica, he told me if he could get one or two, that he would &s;ail im|mediately for that i&s;land: he al&s;o pre|tended to &s;hew me &s;ome marks of at|tention and re&s;pect, and promi&s;ed to give me forty-five &s;hillings &s;terling a month if I would go with him. I thought this much better than cutting wood for nothing. I therefore told the other captain that I wanted to go to Ja|maica in the other ve&s;&s;el; but he would not li&s;ten to me; and, &s;eeing me re&s;olved to go in a day or two, he got the ve&s;&s;el to &s;ail, intending to carry me away a|gain&s;t my will. This treatment mortified me extremely. I immediately, accor|ding to an agreement I had made with the Capt. of the Indian Queen, called for her boat, which was lying near us, and it came along&s;ide; and, by the means of a north-pole &s;hipmate which I met with in the &s;loop I was in, I got my things into the boat, and went on
<PB N="155" REF="023353_0359_0FBF410C41BC88C8">
board of the Indian Queen, July the 10th. A few days after I was there, we got all things ready and &s;ailed: but again, to my great mortification, this ve&s;&s;el &s;till went to the &s;outh, nearly as far as Carthagena, trading along the coa&s;t, in&s;tead of going to Jamaica, as the captain had promi&s;ed me: and, what was wor&s;t of all he was a very cruel and bloody minded man, and was a horrid ble&s;phemer. Among others, he had a white pilot, one Stoker, whom he beat often as &s;everely as he did &s;ome negroes he had on board One night in particular, after he had beaten this man mo&s;t cruelly, he put him into the boat, and made two negroes row him to a de&s;olate key, or &s;mall i&s;land, and he loaded two pi&s;tols, and &s;wore bitterly that he would &s;hoot the negroes if they brought Stoker on board again. There was not the lea&s;t doubt but that he would do as he &s;aid, and the two poor fellows were obliged to obey the cruel mandate; but, when the captain was a&s;leep, the two negroes took a blanket and carried it to the unfortu|nate Stoker, which I believe was the means of &s;aving his life from the an|noyance of in&s;ects. A great deal of entreaty was u&s;ed with the captain the
<PB N="156" REF="023353_0360_0FBF4113B1AC6A58">
next day, before he would con&s;ent to let Stoker come on board; and when the poor man was brought on board he was very ill, from his &s;ituation during the night, and he remained &s;o till he was drowned a little time after. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> we &s;ailed &s;outhward we came to many uninhabited i&s;lands, which were over|grown with fine large cocoa nuts. As I was very much in want of provi&s;ions, I brought a boat load of them on board, which la&s;ted me and other for &s;everal weeks, and afforded us many a delicious repa&s;t in our &s;carcity One day, before this, I could not help ob|&s;erving the providential hand of God, that ever &s;upplies all our wants, though in the way, and manner we know not. I had been a whole day without food, and made &s;ignals for boats to come off, but in vain. I therefore earne&s;tly prayed to God for relief in my need; and at the clo&s;e of the evening I went off the deck. Ju&s;t as I laid down I heard a noi&s;e on the deck; and, not knowing what it meant, I went directly on the deck again, when what &s;hould I &s;ee but a fine large fi&s;h about &s;even or eight pounds, which had jumped aboard! I took it, and admired, with thanks, the good hand of God; and, what I con|&s;idered
<PB N="157" REF="023353_0361_0FBF4114DDBB1198">
as not le&s;s extraordinary, the captain, who was very avaricious, did not attempt to take it from me, there being only him and I on board; for the re&s;t were all gone a&s;hore trading. Sometimes the people did not come off for &s;ome days: this u&s;ed to fret the captain, and then he would vent his fury on me by beating me, or making me feel in other cruel ways. One day e&s;pecially, in his wild, wicked, and mad career, after &s;triking me &s;everal times with different things, and once acro&s;s my mouth, even with a red burning &s;tick out of the fire, he got a barrel of gunpowder on the deck, and &s;wore that he would blow up the ve&s;&s;el. I was then at my wit's end, and earne&s;tly prayed to God to direct me. The head was out of the barrel; and tho captain took a lighted &s;tick out of the fire to blow him&s;elf and me up, be|cau&s;e there was a ve&s;&s;el then in &s;ight coming in, which he &s;uppo&s;ed was a Spaniard, and he was afraid of falling into their hands. Seeing this I got an axe, unnoticed by him, and placed my&s;elf between him and the powder, having re&s;olved in my&s;elf as &s;oon as he attempted to put the fire in the barrel
<PB N="158" REF="023353_0362_0FBF41160D1C79D0">
to chop him down that in&s;tant. I was more than an hour in this &s;ituation; during which he &s;truck me often, &s;till keeping the fire in his hand for this wicked purpo&s;e. I really &s;hould have thought my&s;elf ju&s;tifiable in any other part of the world if I had killed him, and prayed to God, who gave me a mind which re&s;ted &s;olely on him&s;elf. I prayed for re&s;ignation, that his will might be done: and the following two portions of his holy word, which oc|cured to my mind, buoyed up my hope, and kept me from taking the life of this wicked man. <Q>He hath deter|mined the times before appointed, and &s;et bounds to our habitations,</Q> Acts xvii. 26. And, <Q>Who is there among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his &s;ervant, that walketh in darkne&s;s and hath no light? let him tru&s;t in the name of the Lord, and &s;tay upon his God,</Q> I&s;aiah l. 20. And thus by the grace of God I was enabled to do. I found him a pre&s;ent help in the time of need, and the captain's fury began to &s;ub&s;ide as the night approached: but I found,
<Q><L>That he who cannot &s;tem his anger's tide</L>
<L>Doth a wild hor&s;e without a bridle ride.</L></Q>
<PB N="159" REF="023353_0363_0FBF41178135EFC0">
The next morning we di&s;covered that the ve&s;&s;el which had cau&s;ed &s;uch a fury in the captain was an Engli&s;h &s;loop. They &s;oon came to an anchor where we were, and, to my no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e, I learned that Doctor Irving was on board of her on his way from the Mu&s;quito &s;hore to Jamaica. I was for going immediately to &s;ee this old ma&s;ter and friend, but the captain would not &s;uffer me to leave the ve&s;&s;el. I then informed the Doctor, by letter, how I was treated, and begged that he would take me out of the &s;loop: but he informed me that it was not in his power, as he was a pa&s;|&s;enger him&s;elf; but he &s;ent me &s;ome rum and &s;ugar for my own u&s;e. I now learned that after I had left the e&s;tate which I managed for this gentleman on the Mu&s;quito &s;hore, during which the &s;laves were well fed and comfort|able, a white over&s;eer had &s;upplied my place: this man through inhumanity and ill-judged avarice, beat and cut the poor &s;laves mo&s;t unmercifully; and the con&s;equence was, that every one got into a large Puriogua canoe, and endeavored to e&s;cape; but not know|ing where to go, or how to manage the canoe, they were all drowned; in con&s;equence of which the Doctor's

<P>On the 14th of October, the Indian Queen arrived at King&s;ton in Jamaica. When we were u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">aded I demanded my wages, which amounted to eight pounds five &s;hillings &s;terling; but Captain Baker refu&s;ed to give me one farthing, although it was the harde&s;t|earned money I ever worked for in my life. I found out Doctor Irving upon this, and acquainted him of the cap|tain's knavery. He did all he could to help me to get my money; and we went to every magi&s;trate in King&s;ton (and there were nine) but they all re|fu&s;ed to do any thing for me, and &s;aid my oath could not be admitted again&s;t a white man. Nor was this all; for Baker threatened that he would beat me &s;everely if he could catch me for at|tempting to demand my money; and this he would have done, but that I got, by means of Doctor Irving, under the protection of Captain Douglas, of the Squirrel man of war. I thought this exceeding hard u&s;age; though indeed I found it to be too much the practice there to pay free negro men for their labour in this manner.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="023353_0365_0FBF41201F567218">
One day I went with a free negro, taylor, named Joe Diamond, to one Mr. Cochran, who was indebted to him &s;ome trifling &s;um; and the man, not being able to get his money, be|gan to murmur. The other immedi|ately took a hor&s;e-whip to pay him with it, but, by the help of a good pair of heels, the taylor got off. Such op|pre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e made me &s;eek for a ve&s;&s;el to get off the i&s;land as fa&s;t as I could: and by the mercy of God, I found a &s;hip in November bound for England, when I embarked with a con|voy, after having taken a la&s;t farewell of Doctor Irving. When I left Jamaica he was employed in refining &s;ugars; and &s;ome months after my arrival in En|gland I learned, with much &s;orrow, that this my amiable friend was dead, owing to his having eaten &s;ome poi|&s;oned fi&s;h.</P>
<P>We had many very heavy gales of wind in our pa&s;&s;age; in the cour&s;e of which no material incident occurred, except that an American privateer, fal|ling in with the fleet, was captured and &s;et fire to by his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Squir|rel.</P>

<P>SUCH were the various &s;cenes which I was a witne&s;s to, and the for|tune I experienced until the year 1777. Since that period, my life has been more uniform, and the incidents of it fewer, than in any other equal nnmber of years preceding; I therefore ha&s;ten to the conclu&s;ion of a narrative, which I fear the reader may think already &s;uf|ficiently tedious.</P>
<P>I had &s;uffered &s;o many impo&s;itions in my commercial tran&s;actions in dif|ferent
<PB N="164" REF="023353_0368_0FBF412A2DD12BF8">
parts of the world, that I became heartily di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;ea-faring life, and was determined not to re|turn to it, at lea&s;t for &s;ome time. I therefore once more engaged in &s;ervice &s;hortly after my return, and continued for the mo&s;t part in this &s;ituation until 1784.</P>
<P>SOON after my arrival in London, I &s;aw a remarkable circum&s;tance relative to African complexion, which I thought &s;o extraordinary, that I beg leave ju&s;t to mention it: A white negro woman, that I had formerly &s;een in London and other parts, had married a white man, by whom &s;he had three boys, and they were every one mullattoes, and yet they had fine light hair. In 1779, I &s;erved Governor Macnamara, who had been a con&s;iderable time on the coa&s;t of Africa. In the time of my &s;ervice, I u&s;ed to a&s;k frequently other &s;ervants to join me in family prayer; but this only excited their mockery. However, the Governor, under&s;tanding that I was of a religious turn, wi&s;hed to know what religion I was of; I told him I was a prote&s;tant of the church of England, agreeable to the thirty-nine articles of that church; and that whom&s;oever I found to preach accord|ing
<PB N="165" REF="023353_0369_0FBF412B6465A468">
to that doctrine, tho&s;e I would hear. A few days after this, we had &s;ome more di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ame &s;ubject; when he &s;aid he would, if I cho&s;e, as he thought I might be of &s;ervice in converting my countrymen to the Go&s;pel faith, get me &s;ent out as mi&s;&s;ionary to Africa. I at fir&s;t refu&s;ed going, and told him how I had been &s;erved on a like occa|&s;ion by &s;ome white people the la&s;t voyage I went to Jamaica, when I at|tempted (if it were the will of God) to be the means of converting the Indian prince; and &s;aid I &s;uppo&s;ed they would &s;erve me wor&s;e than Alexander the copper&s;mith did St. Paul, if I &s;hould attempt to go among&s;t them in Africa. He told me not to fear, for he would apply to the Bi&s;hop of London to get me ordained. On the&s;e terms I con|&s;ented to the Governor's propo&s;al to go to Africa in hope of doing good, if po&s;&s;ible, among&s;t my countrymen; &s;o, in order to have me &s;ent out properly, we immediately wrote the following letters to the late Bi&s;hop of London:</P>

WITH the&s;e letters, I waited on the Bi&s;hop by the Governor's de&s;ire, and pre&s;ented them to his Lord&s;hip. He received me with much conde&s;cen&s;ion and politene&s;s; but from &s;ome certain &s;cruples of delicacy, and &s;aying the Bi&s;hops were not of opinion of &s;end|ing a new mi&s;&s;ionary to Africa, he de|clined to ordain me.</P>
<P>MY &s;ole motive for thus dwelling on this tran&s;action, or in&s;erting the&s;e pa|pers, is the opinion which gentlemen of &s;en&s;e and education, who are ac|quainted with Africa, entertain of the probability of converting the inhabi|tants of it to the faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, if the attempt were countenanced by the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>Shortly after this I left the Governor, and &s;erved a nobleman in the Dor&s;et|&s;hire militia, with whom I was en|camped at Coxheath for &s;ome time; but the operations there, were too mi|nute and unintere&s;ting to make a de|tail of.</P>
<P>IN the year 1783, I vi&s;ited eight counties in Wales, from motives of curio&s;ity. While I was in that part of the country I was led to go down into a coal-pit in Shrop&s;hire, but my curi|o&s;ity
<PB N="170" REF="023353_0374_0FBF4134D5AE7DC8">
nearly co&s;t me my life; for while I was in the pit the coals fell in, and buried one poor man, who was not far from me: upon this I got out as fa&s;t as I could, thinking the &s;urface of the earth the &s;afe&s;t part of it.</P>
<P>IN the &s;pring of 1784, I thought of vi&s;iting old ocean again. In con&s;e|quence of this I embarked as &s;teward on board a fine new &s;hip called the London, commanded by Martin Hop|kin, and &s;ailed for New-York. I ad|mired this city very much; it is large and well-built, and abounds with pro|vi&s;ions of all kinds. While we lay here a circum&s;tance happened which I thought extremely &s;ingular:&mdash;One day a malefactor was to be executed on a gallows; but with a condition that if any woman, having nothing on but her &s;hift, married the man under the gal|lows, his life was to be &s;aved. This extraordinary privilege was claimed; a woman pre&s;ented her&s;elf; and the marriage ceremony was performed.</P>
<P>OUR &s;hip having got laden we re|turned to London in January 1785. When &s;he was ready again for another voyage, the captain being an agreeable man, I &s;ailed with him from hence in the &s;pring, March 1785, for Philadel|phia.
<PB N="171" REF="023353_0375_0FBF413ADCC77650">
On the 5th of April, we took our departure from the land's-end, with a plea&s;ant gale; and about nine o'clock that night the moon &s;hone bright, and the &s;ea was &s;mooth, while our &s;hip was going free by the wind, at the rate of about four or five miles an hour.&mdash;At this time another &s;hip was going nearly as fa&s;t as we on the oppo&s;ite point, meeting us right in the teeth, yet none on board ob&s;erved either &s;hip until we &s;truck each other forcibly head and head, to the a&s;toni&s;hment and con&s;ter|nation of both crews. She did us much damage, but I believe we did her more; for when we pa&s;&s;ed by each other, which we did very quickly, they cal|led to us to bring to, and hoi&s;t out our boat, but we had enough to do to mind our&s;elves; and in about eight minutes we &s;aw no more of her. We refitted as well as we could the next day, and proceeded on our voyage, and in May arrived at Philadelphia.</P>
<P>I was very glad to &s;ee this favorite old town once more; and my plea&s;ure was much increa&s;ed in &s;eeing the wor|thy quakers freeing and ea&s;ing the bur|thens of many of my oppre&s;&s;ed African brethren. It rejoiced my heart when one of the&s;e friendly people took me to
<PB N="172" REF="023353_0376_0FBF413C4C1C28A0">
&s;ee a free-&s;chool they had erected for every denomination of black people, who&s;e minds are cultivated here, and forwarded to virtue; and thus they are made u&s;eful members of the communi|ty. Does not the &s;ucce&s;s of this prac|tice &s;ay loudly to the planters, in the language of &s;cripture&mdash;"Go ye and do likewi&s;e!"</P>
<P>IN October 1785, I was accompanied by &s;ome of the Africans, and pre&s;ented this addre&s;s of thanks to the gentlemen called Friends or Quakers, in Grace-church-Court, Lombard Street:</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN, BY reading your book, entitled a Caution to Great-Britain and her Co|lonies, concerning the Calamitous State of the en&s;laved Negroes: We part of the poor, oppre&s;&s;ed, needy, and much degraded Negroes, de&s;ire to approach you with this addre&s;s of thanks, with our inmo&s;t love and warme&s;t acknow|ledgment; and with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;e of your benevolence, unwearied labour, and kind interpo&s;ition, towards break|ing the yoke of &s;lavery, and to admi|ni&s;ter a little comfort and ea&s;e to thou|&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands of very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">grievou&s;ly afflicted, and too heavy burthened negroes.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="023353_0377_0FBF413FF6421B30">
GENTLEMEN, could you, by per&s;e|verance, at la&s;t be enabled under God, to lighten in any degree the heavy bur|then of the afflicted, no doubt it would in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be the po&s;&s;ible means, under God, of &s;aving the &s;ouls of many of the oppre&s;&s;ors; and if &s;o, &s;ure we are that the God, who&s;e eyes are ever upon all his creatures, and always rewards every true act of virtue, and regards the prayers of the oppre&s;&s;ed, will give to you and yours tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which it is not in our power to expre&s;s or conceive, but which we as a part of tho&s;e captivated, oppre&s;&s;ed, and af|flicted people, mo&s;t earne&s;tly wi&s;h and pray for.</P>
<P>THESE gentlemen received us very kindly, with a promi&s;e to exert them|&s;elves on behalf of the oppre&s;&s;ed Afri|cans, and we parted.</P>
<P>WHILE in town, I chanced once to be invited to a quaker's wedding. The &s;imple and yet expre&s;&s;ive mode u&s;ed at their &s;olemnizations is worthy of note. The following is the true form of it:</P>
<P>AFTER the company have met they have &s;ea&s;onable exhortations by &s;everal of the members; the bride and bride|groom &s;tand up, and, taking each other
<PB N="174" REF="023353_0378_0FBF4140CD6AD080">
by the hand in a &s;olemn manner, the man audibly declares to this purpo&s;e:</P>
<P>"FRIENDS, in the fear of the Lord, and in the pre&s;ence of this a&s;&s;embly, whom I de&s;ire to be my witne&s;&s;es, I take this my friend, M. N. to be my wife; promi&s;ing, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, to be unto her a loving and faithful hu&s;band till death &s;eparate us:" and the woman makes the like decla|ration. Then the two fir&s;t &s;ign their names to the record, and as many more witne&s;&s;es as have a mind. I had the honour to &s;ub&s;cribe mine to a regi&s;ter in Gracechurch-Court, Lombard-&s;treet.&mdash;My hand is ever free&mdash;if any female Debonair wi&s;hes to obtain it, this mode I recommend.</P>
<P>WE returned to London in Augu&s;t; and our &s;hip not going immediately to &s;ea, I &s;hipped as a &s;teward in an Ame|rican &s;hip called the Harmony, Capt. John Willet, and left London in March 1785, bound to Philadelphia. Eleven days after &s;ailing, we carried our fore|ma&s;t away We had a nine weeks pa&s;|&s;age, which cau&s;ed our trip not to &s;uc|ceed well, the market for our goods proving bad; and to make it wor&s;e, my commander began to play me the like tricks as others too often practi&s;e

on free negroes in the We&s;t-Indies. But I thank God I found many friends here, who in &s;ome mea&s;ure prevented him. On my return to London in Augu&s;t, I was very agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the benevolence of govern|ment had adopted the plan of &s;ome philanthropic individuals to &s;end the Africans from hence to their native quarter; and that &s;ome ve&s;&s;els were then engaged to carry them to Sierra Leona; an act which redounded to the honour of all concerned in its pro|motion, and filled me with prayers and much rejoicing. There was then in the city, a &s;elect committee of gentlemen for the black poor, to &s;ome of whom I had the honour of being known; and as &s;oon as they heard of my arrival, they &s;ent for me to the committee. When I came there, they informed me of the intention of government; and as they &s;eemed to think me quali|fied to &s;uperintend part of the under|taking, they a&s;ked me to go with the black poor to Africa I pointed out to them many objections to my going; and particularly I expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome difficulties on the account of the &s;lave dealers, as I would certainly op|po&s;e their traffic in the human &s;pecies

I proceeded immediately to the exe|cuting of my duty on board the ve&s;&s;els de&s;tined for the voyage, where I con|tinued till the March following.</P>
<P>DURING my continuance in the em|ployment of government, I was &s;truck with the flagrant abu&s;es committed by the agent, and endeavoured to remedy them, but without effect One in&s;tance, among many which I could produce, may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen. Government had ordered to be provided all nece&s;|&s;aries (&s;lops, as they are called, includ|ed) for 750 per&s;ons; however, not being able to mu&s;ter more than 426, I was ordered to &s;end the &s;uperfluous &s;lops, &amp;c. to the king's &s;tore's a Port&s;|mouth; but, when I demanded them for that purpo&s;e from the agent, it appeared they had never been bought, though paid for by government. But that was not all, government were not the only objects of peculation; the&s;e poor peo|ple &s;uffered infinitely more; their ac|commodations, were mo&s;t wretched; many of them wanted beds, and many more cloathing and other nece&s;&s;aries. For the truth of this, and much more, I do not &s;eek credit from my own a&s;&s;er|tion. I appeal to the te&s;timony of Capt. Thomp&s;on, of the Nautilus, who con|voyed
<PB N="179" REF="023353_0383_0FBF414F18F4A048">
us, to whom I applied in Feb|ruary 1787, for a remedy, when I had remon&s;trated to the agent in vain, and even brought him to be a witne&s;s of the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion I complained of. I appeal al&s;o to a letter written by the&s;e wretched people, &s;o early as the beginning of the preceding January, and publi&s;hed in the Morning Herald. on the 4th of that month, &s;igned by twenty of their chiefs.</P>

By this I &s;uffered a con&s;iderable lo&s;s in my property: however, the com|mi&s;&s;ioners were &s;atisfied with my con|duct, and wrote to Capt Thomp&s;on, expre&s;&s;ing their approbation of it.</P>

He has had the misfortune to have &s;unk a con&s;iderable part of his lit|tle property in fitting him&s;elf out, and in other expences ari&s;ing out of his &s;itu|ation, an account of which he here annexes.

<P>THE negro con&s;olidated act, made by the a&s;&s;embly of Jamaica la&s;t year, and the new act of amendment now in agitation there, contain a proof of the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e charges that have been made again&s;t the planters relative to the treatment of their &s;laves.</P>

<P>As the inhuman traffic of &s;lavery is to be taken into the con&s;ideration of the Briti&s;h legi&s;lature, I doubt not, if a &s;y&s;tem of commerce was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Africa, the demand for manufactures will mo&s;t rapidly augment, as the na|tive inhabitants will in&s;en&s;ibly adopt the Briti&s;h fa&s;hions, manners, cu&s;toms, &amp;c in proportion to the civilization, &s;o will be the con&s;umption of Briti&s;h manufactures.</P>

<P>A CASE in point.&mdash;It co&s;t the Abo|rigines of Britain, little or nothing in clothing, &amp;c;. The difference between their forefathers and the pre&s;ent gene|ration, in point of con&s;umption, is literally infinite. The &s;uppo&s;ition is mo&s;t obvious. It will be equally im|men&s;e in Africa&mdash;The &s;ame cau&s;e, viz. civilization, will ever have the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>IT is trading upon &s;afe grounds. A commercial intercour&s;e with Africa opens an inexhau&s;table &s;ource of wealth to the manufacturing intere&s;ts of Great Britain, and to all which the &s;lave trade is an objection.</P>
<P>IF I am not mi&s;informed, the manu|facturing intere&s;t is equal, if not &s;upe|rior, to the landed intere&s;t, as to the value, for rea&s;ons which will &s;oon ap|pear The abolition of &s;lavery, &s;o diabolical, will give a mo&s;t rapid ex|ten&s;ion of manufactures, which is to|tally and diametrically oppo&s;ite to what &s;ome intere&s;ted people a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P>THE manufactures of this country mu&s;t and will, in the nature and rea&s;on of things, have a full and con&s;tant em|ploy by &s;upplying the African markets.</P>

POPULATION, the bowels and &s;urface of Africa, abound in valuable and u&s;e|ful returns; the hidden trea&s;ures of cen|turies will be brought to light and into circulation. Indu&s;try, enterprize, and mining, will have their full &s;cope, pro|portionably as they civilize. In a word, it lays open an endle&s;s field of commerce to the Briti&s;h manufactures and merchant adventurer. The manu|facturing intere&s;t and the general inte|re&s;ts are &s;ynonymous. The abolition of &s;lavery would be in reality an univer&s;al good.</P>

If the blacks were per|mitted to remain in their own country, they would double them&s;elves every fifteen years In proportion to &s;uch increa&s;e will be the demand for manu|factures.

<P>I have only therefore to reque&s;t the reader's indulgence and conclude. I am far from the vanity of thinking there is any merit in this narrative: I hope cen&s;ure will be &s;u&s;pended, when it is con&s;idered that it was written by one
