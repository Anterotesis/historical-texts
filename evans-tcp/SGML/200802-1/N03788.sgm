<P>Two are better than One, becau&s;e they have a good Reward for their Labour. For if they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow: But woe be to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up. Again, if Two lie together, then they have Heat; but how can one be warm alone? And if One prevail again&s;t him, Two &s;hall with&s;tand him; and a Threefold Cord is not quickly broken.</P></Q>

<P>AMong the many Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;ignable for the &s;ad Decay of <HI>True Chri&s;tia|nity,</HI> perhaps the neglecting to <HI>a&s;&s;em|ble our&s;elves together,</HI> in <HI>Religious Societies,</HI> may not be one of the lea&s;t. That I may therefore do my Endeavour towards promoting &s;o excellent a Means of Piety,
<PB N="4" REF="004648_0003_100D86711E67DBF8">
I have &s;elected a Pa&s;&s;age of Scripture drawn from the Experience of the wi&s;e&s;t of Men, which being a little enlarged on and illu&s;trated, will fully an&s;wer my pre&s;ent De&s;ign; that be|ing to &s;hew, in the be&s;t Manner I can, the <HI>Ne|ce&s;&s;ity</HI> and <HI>Benefits</HI> of <HI>Society</HI> in general, and of <HI>Religious Society</HI> in particular.</P>
<P><HI>Two are better than One,</HI> &amp;c,</P>
<P>From which Words I &s;hall take Occa&s;ion to prove,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Truth of the Wi&s;e Man's A&s;&s;er|tion, <HI>viz. Two are better than One,</HI> and that in Reference to <HI>Society</HI> in general, and <HI>Religious Society</HI> in particular.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To a&s;&s;ign &s;ome Rea&s;ons why <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> e&s;pecially as to the la&s;t Particular. 1. Becau&s;e Men can rai&s;e up one another when they chance to &s;lip: <HI>For if they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow.</HI> 2. Becau&s;e they can impart Heat to each other: <HI>Again, if Two lie together, then they have Heat; but how can One be warm alone?</HI> 3. Becau&s;e they can &s;ecure each other from tho&s;e that do oppo&s;e them: <HI>And if One prevail again&s;t him, Two &s;hall with&s;tand him; and a threefold Cord is not quickly broken.</HI> From hence,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I &s;hall take Occa&s;ion to &s;hew the Duty incumbent on every Member of a <HI>Religious Society.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> I &s;hall draw an Inference or two from what &s;hall have been &s;aid; and then conclude with a Word or two of Exhortation from the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004648_0003_100D86711E67DBF8"><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, I am to prove the Truth of the Wi&s;e Man's A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> and that in Reference to <HI>Society</HI> in general, and <HI>Religious Societies</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>And how can this be done better than by &s;hewing that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the Welfare both of the Bodies and Souls of Men? Indeed, if we look upon Man as he came out of the Hands of his Maker, we imagine him to be <HI>perfect, entire, lacking nothing.</HI> But GOD, who&s;e <HI>Thoughts are not as our Thoughts,</HI> &s;aw &s;omething &s;till wanting to make <HI>Adam</HI> happy. And what was that? Why, an Help meet for him. For thus &s;peaketh the Scripture: <HI>And the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>&s;aid, It is not good that the Man &s;hould be alone, I will make an Help meet for him.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, GOD &s;aid, <HI>It is not good,</HI> thereby implying that the Creation would have been imperfect, <HI>in &s;ome &s;ort,</HI> unle&s;s an <HI>Help</HI> was found out <HI>meet for Adam.</HI> And if this was the Ca&s;e of Man before the Fall; if an <HI>Help</HI> was <HI>meet</HI> for him in a State of Perfection &s;urely &s;ince the Fall, when we come naked and helple&s;s out of our Mother's Womb, when our Wants increa&s;e with our Years, and we can &s;carcely &s;ub&s;i&s;t a Day without the mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance of each other, well may we &s;ay, <HI>It is not good for Man to be alone.</HI></P>
<P>Society then, we &s;ee, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry in re&s;pect to our <HI>bodily</HI> and <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Wants. If we carry our View farther, and con&s;ider Man|kind as divided into different Cities, Countries, and Nations, the Nece&s;&s;ity of it will appear yet
<PB N="6" REF="004648_0004_100DB68A764860A8">
more evident. For how can Communities be kept up, or Commerce carried on, without <HI>So|ciety?</HI> Certainly not at all, &s;ince Providence &s;eems wi&s;ely to have a&s;&s;igned a particular Pro|duct to almo&s;t each particular Country, on Pur|po&s;e, as it were, to oblige us to be &s;ocial; and hath &s;o admirably mingled the Parts of the whole Body of Mankind together, <HI>that the Eye cannot &s;ay to the Hand, I have no Need of thee, nor again, the Hand to the Foot, I have no Need of thee.</HI></P>
<P>Many other In&s;tances might be given of the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Society,</HI> in Reference to our <HI>bodily, per&s;onal,</HI> and <HI>national</HI> Wants. But what are all the&s;e when <HI>weighed in the Ballance of the Sanc|tuary,</HI> in Compari&s;on of the infinite greater Need of it, with re&s;pect to the <HI>Soul?</HI> It was chiefly in regard to this better Part, no doubt, that GOD &s;aid, <HI>It is not good for the Man to be alone.</HI> For, let us &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Adam</HI> to be as happy as may be, placed as the Lord of the Creation in the <HI>Paradi&s;e of</HI> GOD, and &s;pend|ing all his Hours in adoring and prai&s;ing the ble&s;&s;ed Author of his Being; yet as his Soul was the very Copy of the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> who&s;e peculiar Property it is to be communicative, <HI>without the Divine All-&s;ufficiency,</HI> he could not be compleatly happy, becau&s;e he was alone and incommunicative, nor even content in <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> for want of a <HI>Partner</HI> in his Joys, GOD knew this, and therefore &s;aid, <HI>It is not good that the Man &s;hould be alone, I will make a Help meet for him.</HI> And tho' this proved a fatal Means of
<PB N="7" REF="004648_0004_100DB68A764860A8">
his falling; yet that was not owing to any na|tural Con&s;equence of <HI>Society</HI>; but partly to that cur&s;ed Apo&s;tate, who <HI>craftily lies in wait to deceive</HI>; partly to <HI>Adam</HI>'s own Folly, in ra|ther chu&s;ing to be mi&s;erable with one he loved, than tru&s;t in GOD to rai&s;e him up another Spou&s;e.</P>
<P>If we reflect indeed on that familiar Inter|cour&s;e our fir&s;t Parents could carry on with Heaven, in a State of Innocence, we &s;hall be apt to think he had as little Need of <HI>Society,</HI> as to his <HI>Soul,</HI> as before we &s;uppo&s;ed him to have, in re&s;pect to his Body. But yet, as GOD and the Holy Angels were &s;o far above him on the one Hand, and the Bea&s;ts &s;o far beneath him on the other, there was nothing like having one to to conver&s;e with, who was <HI>Bone of his Bone, and Fle&s;h of his Fle&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Man, then, could not be fully happy, we &s;ee even in <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> without a Companion of his own Species, much le&s;s now he is driven out. For, let us view him a little in his natural E&s;tate now, &s;ince the Fall, as <HI>having his Under&s;tanding darkened, his Mind alienated from the Life of</HI> GOD; as no more able to &s;ee his Way wherein he &s;hould go, than a blind Man to de&s;cribe the Sun: That notwith&s;tanding this, he mu&s;t re|ceive his Sight e'er he can &s;ee GOD: And that if he never &s;ees him, he never can be happy. Let us view him, I &s;ay, in this Light (or rather this Darkne&s;s) and deny the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Society</HI> if we can. A Divine Revelation we find is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, we being by Nature as un|able
<PB N="8" REF="004648_0005_100DB68C041228F8">
to do our Duty. And how &s;hall we learn except one teach us? But was GOD to do this him&s;elf, how &s;hould we, with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI>exceed|ingly quake and fear? Nor would the Mini&s;try of Angels in this Affair be without too much Terror. It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore (at lea&s;t GOD's Dealing with us hath &s;hewed it&punc; to be &s;o) that we be <HI>drawn with the Cords of a Man.</HI> And that a Divine Revelation being granted, we &s;hould u&s;e one another's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, under GOD, to in&s;truct each other in the Knowledge, and to exhort one another to the Practice of tho&s;e Things which belong to our everla&s;ting Peace. This is undoubtedly the great End of Society intended by GOD &s;ince the Fall, and a &s;trong Argument it is, why <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> and why we &s;hould <HI>not for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling our &s;elves together.</HI></P>
<P>But farther, let us con&s;ider our&s;elves as <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> as having this natural Veil, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, taken off from our Eyes by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of GOD's Holy Spirit, and &s;o enabled to &s;ee what he requires of us. Let us &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves in &s;ome degree to have <HI>ta&s;ted the good Word of Life,</HI>and to have felt the Powers of the World to come, influencing and moulding our Souls into a religious Frame: To be fully and heartily convinced that we are <HI>Soldiers</HI> li&s;ted under the <HI>Banner of</HI> CHRIST, and have proclaimed open War at our <HI>Bapti&s;m, again&s;t the World, the Fle&s;h, and the Devil</HI>; and have, perhaps, frequently renewed our Obligations &s;o to do, by partaking of the <HI>Lord's Supper:</HI> That we are &s;urrounded
<PB N="9" REF="004648_0005_100D68C041228F8">
with Millions of Foes without, and infe&s;ted with Legions of Enemies within: That we are commanded to &s;hine as Lights in the World, in the mid&s;t of a crooked and perver&s;e Generati|on: That we are travelling to a long Eter|nity, and need all imaginable Helps to &s;hew us, and encourage us in our Way thither. Let us, I &s;ay, reflect on all this, and then how &s;hall each of us cry out, Brethren, what a nece&s;&s;ary Thing it is to meet together in <HI>Religiuos Societies?</HI></P>
<P>The Primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were fully &s;en&s;ible of this, and therefore we find them continually keeping up Communion with each other: For what &s;ays the Scripture? <HI>They continued &s;ted|fa&s;t in the Doctrine and Fellow&s;hip,</HI> Acts ii. 42. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> were no &s;ooner di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the Great Council, than they ha&s;te away to their Companions. <HI>And being &s;et at Liberty,</HI> &s;ays the Text, <HI>they came to their own, and told them all the&s;e Things which the High Prie&s;t had &s;aid unto them,</HI> Acts iv. 23. <HI>Paul,</HI> as &s;oon as converted, <HI>tarried three Days with the Di&s;ciples that were at</HI> Dama&s;cus, Acts ix. 19. And <HI>Peter</HI> after|wards, when relea&s;ed from Pri&s;on, immediately goes to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Mary,</HI> where there were <HI>great Multitudes a&s;&s;embled, praying,</HI> Acts xii. 12. And it is reported of <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in After-Ages, that they u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble together before Day|light, to &s;ing a P&s;alm to CHRIST as GOD. So precious was the <HI>Communion of Saints</HI> in tho&s;e Days.</P>
<P>If it be asked, what Advantage we &s;hall reap from &s;uch a Procedure now? I an&s;wer, much
<PB N="10" REF="004648_0006_100DB68F6A1C4DD0">
every Way. <HI>Two are better than One, becau&s;e they have a good Reward for their Labour: For if they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow; but woe be to him that is alone when he falleth, for he hath not another to help him up. Again, if Two lye together, then the have Heat; but how can One be warm alone? And if One prevail again&s;t him, Two &s;hall with&s;tand him; and a Three-fold Cord is not quickly broken.</HI></P>
<P>Which directly leads me to my Second general Head, under which I was to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome Rea&s;ons why <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> e&s;pe|cially in <HI>Religions Society.</HI></P>
<P>I. As Man in his pre&s;ent Condition cannot always &s;tand upright, but by Rea&s;on of the Frail|ty of his Nature cannot but fall; one eminent Rea&s;on why <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> or, in other Words, one great Advantage of <HI>Religious Society</HI> is, <HI>That when they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow.</HI></P>
<P>And an excellent Rea&s;on this, indeed! For alas! When we reflect how prone we are to be drawn into Error in our Judgments, and into Vice in our Practice; and how unable, at lea&s;t how very unwilling, to e&s;py or correct our own Mi&s;carriages; when we con&s;ider how apt the World is to flatter us in our Faults, and how few there are &s;o kind as to tell us the Truth; what an ine&s;timable Privilege mu&s;t it be to have a Set of true, judicious, hearty Friends about us, continually watching over our &s;oul, to inform us where we have fallen, and warn us that we fall not again for the future. Surely it is &s;uch a
<PB N="11" REF="004648_0006_100DB68F6A1C4DD0">
Privilege that (to u&s;e the Words of an <HI>eminent Chri&s;tian</HI>) we &s;hall never know the Value of, till we come to Glory.</P>
<P>But this is not all; for &s;uppo&s;ing that we could always &s;tand upright, yet who&s;oever re|flects on the Difficulties of Religion in general, and his own Propen&s;ity to Lukewarmne&s;s and Indifference in particular, will find that he mu&s;t be <HI>zealous</HI> as well as <HI>&s;teady,</HI> if ever he expects to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Here then, the Wi&s;e Man points out to us another excel|lent Rea&s;on why <HI>Two are better than One. Again,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>If Two lie together, then they have Heat, but how can One be warm alone?</HI></P>
<P>Which was the next Thing to be con&s;idered under the Second general Head, <HI>viz.</HI> to a&s;&s;ign a &s;econd Rea&s;on why <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> becau&s;e they can impart <HI>Heat</HI> to each other.</P>
<P>It is an Ob&s;ervation no le&s;s true than com|mon, That kindled Coals, if placed a&s;under, &s;oon go out, but if heaped together, quicken and enliven each other and afford a la&s;ting Heat. The &s;ame will hold good, in the Ca&s;e now be|fore us. If <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> kindled by the Grace of GOD unite, they will quicken and enliven each other; but if they &s;eparate and keep a&s;under, no marvel if they &s;oon grow cool or tepid. If <HI>Two</HI> or <HI>Three</HI> meet together in CHRIST's Name, <HI>they will have Heat; but how can One be warm alone?</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, <HI>How can One be warm alone?</HI> The Wi&s;e Man's expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf by way of Que|&s;tion, implies an Impo&s;&s;ibility, at lea&s;t a very
<PB N="12" REF="004648_0007_100DB69326D36C30">
great Difficulty, to be warm in Religion with|out Company, where it may be had. Behold here, then, another excellent Benefit flowing from <HI>Religious Society</HI>; it will keep us <HI>zealous,</HI> as well as <HI>&s;teady,</HI> in the Ways of Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>But to illu&s;trate this a little farther by a Compari&s;on or two. Let us look upon our&s;elves (as was above hinted) as <HI>Soldiers</HI> li&s;ted under CHRIST's <HI>Banner</HI>; as going out with <HI>ten thou|&s;and to meet One that cometh again&s;t us with twenty thou&s;and:</HI> as Per&s;ons that are to <HI>wre&s;tle not only with Fle&s;h and Blood, but again&s;t Princi|palities, again&s;t Powers, and &s;piritual Wicked|ne&s;&s;es in high Places.</HI> And then tell me, all ye that fear GOD, if it be not an invaluable Privi|lege to have a Company of <HI>Fellow Soldiers</HI> conti|nually about us, animating and exhorting each other to &s;tand our ground, to keep our Ranks, and manfully to follow the <HI>Captain of our Salva|tion,</HI> though it be through a Sea of Blood?</P>
<P>La&s;tlv, Let us con&s;ider our&s;elves in another View before mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> as Per&s;ons travel|ling to a long <HI>Eternity</HI>; re&s;cued by the <HI>freeGrace of GOD,</HI> in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, from our natural <HI>Egyptian Bondage,</HI> and marching under the Con|duct of our <HI>&s;piritual Jo&s;hua,</HI> thro' the <HI>Wilder|ne&s;s of this World,</HI> to the Land of our <HI>Heavenly Canaan.</HI> Let us farther reflect how apt we are to &s;tartle at every Difficulty; to cry, <HI>There are Lions! There are Lions in the Way! There are the Sons of Anak</HI> to be grappled with, e'er we can po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>Promi&s;ed Land:</HI> How prone we are, with <HI>Lot's Wife,</HI> to look wi&s;hfully back on
<PB N="13" REF="004648_0007_100DB69326D36C30">
our <HI>&s;piritual Sodom,</HI> or with the fooli&s;h <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> to long again for the <HI>Fle&s;h-Pots</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and to return to our former natural State of Bondage and Slavery. Con&s;ider this my Brethren, and &s;ee what a ble&s;&s;ed Privilege it will be to have a Set of <HI>I&s;raelites indeed</HI> about us, always reminding us of the Folly of any &s;uch cowardly De&s;ign, and of the intolerable Mi&s;ery we &s;hall run into, if we fall in the lea&s;t &s;hort of the <HI>Promi&s;ed Land.</HI></P>
<P>More might be &s;aid on this Particular, did not the Limits of a Di&s;cour&s;e of this Nature, oblige me to ha&s;ten.</P>
<P>3. To give a Third Rea&s;on, mentioned by the Wi&s;e Man in the Text, why <HI>Two are better than One</HI>; namely, becau&s;e they can &s;ecure each other from Enemies without. <HI>And if One prevail again&s;t him, yet Two &s;hall with&s;tand him; and a Threefold Cord is not quickly broken.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto we have con&s;idered the Avantages of <HI>Religious Societies,</HI> as a great Pre&s;ervative again&s;t falling (at lea&s;t dangerou&s;ly falling) into Sin and Lukewarmne&s;s, and that too from our own Corruptions. But what &s;ays the Wi&s;e Son of <HI>Sirach? My Son, when thou goe&s;t to &s;erve the Lord, prepare thy Soul for Temptation</HI>: And that not only from inward, but outward Foes; par|ticularly from the&s;e two grand Adver&s;aries, the <HI>World</HI> and the <HI>Devil</HI>: For no &s;ooner will thine Eye be bent Heavenward, but the former will be immediately diverting it another Way, tel|ling thee thou neede&s;t not be <HI>&s;ingular</HI> in order to be <HI>religious</HI>; that one may be a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> with|out going &s;o much out of the <HI>Common Road.</HI></P>
<P>Nor will the Devil be wanting in his artful
<PB N="14" REF="004648_0008_100DB694B4D957B8">
In&s;inuations, or <HI>impious</HI> Sugge&s;tions, to divert or terrify thee from pre&s;&s;ing forwards, <HI>that thou may&s;t lay hold on the Crown of Life</HI>: And if he cannot prevail this Way, he will try another; and in order to make his Temptation the more undi&s;cerned, but withal more &s;ucce&s;sful, he will employ, perhaps, &s;ome of thy neare&s;t Relatives, or mo&s;t powerful Friends (as he &s;et <HI>Peter</HI> on our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter</HI>) who will always be bidding thee <HI>&s;pair thy&s;elf</HI>; telling thee thou neede&s;t not take &s;o much Pains; that it is not &s;o difficult a Matter to get to Heaven as &s;ome People would make of it, nor the Way &s;o narrow as others imagine it to be.</P>
<P>But &s;ee here the Advantage of Religious Com|pany; for &s;uppo&s;ing thou finde&s;t thy&s;elf thus &s;urrounded on every Side, unable to with&s;tand &s;uch <HI>horrid</HI> (though &s;eemingly <HI>friendly</HI>) Coun|&s;els, <HI>ha&s;te</HI> away to thy Companions, and they will teach thee a truer and better Le&s;&s;on; they will tell thee, that thou mu&s;t be <HI>&s;ingular</HI> if thou wilt be <HI>religious</HI>; and that it is as impo&s;&s;ible for a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> as for a City &s;et upon a Hill, to be hid: That if thou wilt be an <HI>almo&s;t Chri&s;tian</HI> (and as good be none at all) thou may&s;t live in the &s;ame idle indifferent Manner as thou &s;ee&s;t mo&s;t other People do: But if thou wilt be not only <HI>almo&s;t</HI> but <HI>altogether a Chri&s;tian,</HI> they will inform thee thou mu&s;t go a great deal farther: That thou mu&s;t not only <HI>faintly &s;eek,</HI> but <HI>ear|ne&s;tly &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait Gate</HI>: That there is but <HI>One</HI> Way now to Heaven as former|ly, <HI>viz.</HI> through the narrow Pa&s;&s;age of a <HI>&s;ound Conver&s;ion</HI>: And that in order to bring about
<PB N="15" REF="004648_0008_100DB694B4D957B8">
this mighty Work, thou mu&s;t undergo a con&s;tant, but nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;cipline of Fa&s;ting, Watching, and Prayer. And that therefore, the only Rea|&s;on why the&s;e Friends give thee &s;uch Advice, be|cau&s;e they are not willing to take &s;o much Pains them&s;elves; or, as our Saviour told <HI>Peter</HI> on a like Occa&s;ion, becau&s;e they <HI>&s;avour not the Things that be of GOD, but the Things that be of Men.</HI></P>
<P>This then, is another excellent Ble&s;&s;ing ari&s;ing from <HI>Religious Society,</HI> that Friends can hereby &s;ecure each other from tho&s;e that oppo&s;e them. The <HI>Devil</HI> is fully &s;en&s;ible of this, and therefore he has always done his utmo&s;t to &s;uppre&s;s, and put a Stop to the <HI>Communion of Saints.</HI> This was his grand Artifice at the fir&s;t planting of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI>; to per&s;ecute the Profe&s;&s;ors of it, in order to &s;e|parate them. Which, though GOD, as he always will, over-ruled for the better; yet it &s;hews what an Enmity he has again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tians a&s;&s;embling them&s;elves together.</HI> Nor has he yet left off his old &s;tratagem; it being his u&s;ual Way to entice us <HI>by our &s;elves,</HI> in order to tempt us; where, by be|ing de&s;titute of one another's Helps, he hopes to lead us <HI>captive at his Will.</HI></P>
<P>But, on the contrary, knowing his own Inte|re&s;t is &s;trengthened by <HI>Society,</HI> he would fir&s;t per|&s;uade us to neglect the <HI>Communion of Saints,</HI> and then bid us <HI>&s;tand in the Way of Sinners,</HI> hoping thereby to put us into <HI>the Seat of the Scornful. Judas</HI> &amp; <HI>Peter</HI> are melancholly In&s;tances of this. The former had no &s;ooner left his Company at Supper, but he went out &amp; betrayed his Ma&s;ter: And the di&s;mal Downfal of the latter, when he would venture him&s;elf among&s;t a Company of
<PB N="16" REF="004648_0009_100D864193DC4638">
Enemies, plainly &s;hews us what the Devil will endeavour to do, when he gets us by our&s;elves. Had <HI>Peter</HI> kept his own Company, he might have kept his Integrity; but a <HI>&s;ingle Cord,</HI> alas, how quickly was it broken? Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour knew this full well, and therefore it is very ob&s;ervable, that he always &s;ent out his Di&s;ciples <HI>Two by Two.</HI></P>
<P>And now, after &s;o many Advantages to be rea|ped from <HI>Religious Society,</HI> may we not very ju&s;t|ly cry out with the Wi&s;e Man in my Text, <HI>Woe be to him that is alone; for when he falleth, he hath not another to lift him up:</HI> When he is <HI>cold,</HI> he hath not a Friend to <HI>warm</HI> him; when he is <HI>a&s;&s;aulted,</HI> he hath not a <HI>Second</HI> to help him to with&s;tand his Enemy.</P>
<P N="3">III. I now come to my <HI>Third general Head,</HI> under which was to be &s;hewn the &s;everal Duties incumbent on every Member of a <HI>Religious Society,</HI> as &s;uch, which are three.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Mutual Reproof:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Mutual Exhortation:</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Mutual a&s;&s;isting and defending each other.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. Mutual Reproof. Two are better than One: for when they fall, the One will lift up his Fellow.</P>
<P>Now, Reproof may be taken either in a more exten&s;ive Sen&s;e, and then it &s;ignifies our rai&s;ing a Brother by the gentle&s;t Means, when he falls into Sin and Error; or in a more re&s;trained Sig|nification, as reaching no farther then tho&s;e, lit|tle Mi&s;carriages, which unavoidably happen in the mo&s;t holy Men living.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;e Man in the Text, &s;uppo&s;es all of us &s;ubject to both: <HI>For when they fall</HI> (&s;ays he, thereby implying that each of us may fall) <HI>the One will lift up his Fellow.</HI> From whence we
<PB N="17" REF="004648_0009_100D864193DC4638">
may infer, that <HI>when any Brother is overtaken with a Fault, he that is &s;piritual</HI> (that is, regene|rate, and knows the Corruption and Weakne&s;s of Human Nature) <HI>ought to re&s;tore &s;uch a one in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s.</HI> And why he &s;hould do &s;o, the Apo&s;tle &s;ubjoins a Rea&s;on <HI>con&s;idering thy&s;elf, le&s;t thou al&s;o be tempted; i.e.</HI> con&s;idering thy own Frailty, le&s;t thou al&s;o fall by the like Temptation.</P>
<P>We are all frail un&s;table Creatures; and it is merely owing to the <HI>Free Grace and good Provi|dence of GOD,</HI> that we <HI>run not into the &s;ame Exce&s;s of Riot</HI> with other Men. Every offending Brother, therefore, claims our <HI>Pity</HI> rather than our <HI>Re&s;ent|ment</HI>; and each Member &s;hould &s;trive who &s;hould be mo&s;t forward, as well as mo&s;t gentle, in re&s;to|ring him to his former State.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing a Per&s;on not to be <HI>overtaken,</HI> but to fall <HI>wilfully</HI> into a Crime; yet who art thou that denie&s;t Forgivene&s;s to thy offending Brother? <HI>Let him that &s;tandeth take heed le&s;t he fall.</HI> Take ye, Brethren, the holy Apo&s;tles as eminent Examples for you to learn by, how you ought to behave in this Matter. Con&s;ider how quickly they joined the Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip with <HI>Peter,</HI> who had &s;o wilfully denied his Ma&s;ter: For we find <HI>John</HI> and him together but two Days after, <HI>Joh.</HI> xx. 2. And <HI>v.</HI> 19. we find him a&s;&s;embled with the re&s;t. So &s;oon did they forgive, &s;o &s;oon a&s;&s;ociate with their &s;inful, yet relenting Brother,&mdash;<HI>Let us go &amp; do likewi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But there is another kind of Reproof incum|bent on every Member of <HI>Religious Society;</HI> name|ly, <HI>a gentle Rebuke for &s;ome Mi&s;carriage or other, which, though not actually &s;inful, yet may become the Occa&s;ion of Sin.</HI> This indeed &s;eems more ea&s;y, but
<PB N="18" REF="004648_0010_100DB699ABDFDF60">
perhaps will be found a more difficult Point than the former: For when a Per&s;on has really &s;in|ned, he cannot but own his Brethrens Reproof to be ju&s;t; whereas, when it was only for &s;ome little Mi&s;conduct, the Pride that is in our Natures, will &s;carce &s;uffer us to brook it. But however ungrate|ful this Pill may be to our Brother, yet if we have any Concern for his Welfare, it mu&s;t be admini|&s;tred by &s;ome friendly Hand or other. By all Means then let it be applied; only, like a &s;kilful Phy&s;i|cian, <HI>gild</HI> over the ungrateful Medicine, &amp; endea|vour if po&s;&s;ible, to <HI>deceive</HI> thy Brother into Health and Soundne&s;s. <HI>Let all Bitterne&s;s, &amp; Wrath, and Malice, &amp; Evil-&s;peaking, be put away</HI> from it. Let the Patient know his Recovery is the only Thing aimed at, that thou delighte&s;t not <HI>cau&s;ele&s;ly to grieve thy Brother</HI>; &amp; then thou can&s;t not want Succe&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Mutual Exhortation</HI> is the &s;econd Duty re|&s;ulting from the Words of the Text. &mdash; <HI>Again, If Two lie together, then they have Heat.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve here again, the Wi&s;e Man &s;uppo&s;es it as impo&s;&s;ible for Religious Per&s;ons to meet toge|ther, &amp; not to be the Warmer for each other's Com|pany, as for two Per&s;ons to lie in the &s;ame Bed, and yet freeze with Cold. But now, how is it po&s;&s;ible to communicate Heat to each other, without mu|tually <HI>&s;tirring up the Gift of GOD</HI> which is in us, by brotherly Exhortation? Let every Member then of a <HI>Religious Society</HI> write that zealous Apo&s;tle's Advice on the Tables of his Heart; <HI>See that ye ex|hort, &amp; provoke one another to Love, &amp; to good Works; and &s;o much the more as you &s;ee the Day of the LORD approaching.</HI> Believe me, Brethren, we have need of Exhortation to rouze up our &s;leepy Souls, to &s;et
<PB N="19" REF="004648_0010_100DB699ABDFDF60">
us upon our Watch again&s;t the Temptations of the <HI>World,</HI> the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Devil</HI>; to excite us to re|nounce our&s;elves, to take up our Cro&s;&s;es, &amp; follow our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, &amp; the glorious Company of Saints &amp; Martyrs, <HI>who thro' Faith, have fought the good Fight, &amp; are gone before us to inherit the Promi|&s;es.</HI> A third Part, therefore, of the Time wherein a <HI>Religious Society</HI> meets, &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to be&s;pent in this important Duty: For what avails it to have our Under&s;tandings enlightned by pious Reading unle&s;s our Wills are at the &s;ame Time inclined, and inflamed by mutual Exhortation, to put it in Practice? Add to this, that this is the be&s;t Way both to receive &amp; impart Light, &amp; the only Means to pre&s;erve &amp; increa&s;e that Warmth &amp; Heat which each Per&s;on fir&s;t brought with him; GOD &s;o order|ing this, as all other &s;piritual Gifts, that <HI>to him that hath, i.e.</HI> improve &amp; communicates what he has <HI>&s;hall be given; but from him that hath not, i.e.</HI> does not im|prove the Heat he hath, <HI>&s;hall be taken away even that which he &s;eemed to have.</HI> So needful, &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary is Exhortation to the Good of <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Thirdly and la&s;tly, The Text points out another Duty incumbent on every Member of a <HI>Religious Society, viz.</HI> To <HI>defend each other</HI> from tho&s;e that do oppo&s;e them. <HI>And if One prevail again&s;t him, yet Two &s;hall with&s;tand him; and a Threefold Cord is not quickly broken.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Wi&s;e Man takes it for granted, that <HI>Offences will come,</HI> nay, &amp; that they <HI>may prevail</HI> too. And this is no more than our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter</HI> has long &s;ince told us. Not indeed, that there is any Thing in <HI>Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf</HI> that has the lea&s;t Tendency to give ri&s;e to, or promote &s;uch Offences: No, on the
<PB N="20" REF="004648_0011_100DB69CA77B3168">
contratry, it breathes nothing but Unity &amp; Love.</P>
<P>But &s;o it is, that ever &s;ince the fatal Sentence pronounced by GOD, after our fir&s;t Parents Fall, <HI>viz. I will put Enmity between thy Seed &amp; her Seed; He that is born after the Fle&s;h,</HI> i. e. the unregene|rate unconverted Sinner, has in all Ages <HI>per&s;ecuted him that is born after the Spirit:</HI> And &s;o it always will be. Accordingly we find an early Proof given of this in the In&s;tance of <HI>Cain</HI> &amp; <HI>Abel</HI>; &amp; of <HI>I&s;mael</HI> &amp; <HI>I&s;aac</HI>; of <HI>Jacob</HI> &amp; <HI>E&s;au</HI> afterwards. And indeed, the whole <HI>Bible</HI> contains little el&s;e but an Hi&s;tory of the great &amp; continued Oppo&s;ition between the Children of this World &amp; the Children of GOD. The fir&s;t Chri&s;tians were remarkable Examples of this; though tho&s;e trouble&s;ome Times, ble&s;&s;;ed be GOD, are now over, yet the Apo&s;tle has laid it down as a general Rule, &amp; all that are &s;incere can expe|rimentally prove the Truth of it, That <HI>they that will live godly in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> (to the End of the World, in &s;ome Degree or other) <HI>&s;uffer Per&s;ecution.</HI> That therefore this may not make us de&s;ert our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter's Cau&s;e, every Member &s;hould unite their Forces, in order to &s;tand again&s;t it. And for the better effecting this, each would do well, from Time to Time, to communicate his Experiences, Grievances, &amp; Temptations, &amp; beg his Compani|ons fir&s;t asking GOD's A&s;&s;itance, without which all is nothing) to admini&s;ter Reproof, Exhortation or Comfort, as his Ca&s;e requires: So that <HI>if One cannot prevail again&s;t it, yet Two &s;hall with&s;tand it; and a threefold</HI> (much le&s;s a many-fold) <HI>Cord will not be quickly broken.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. But it is Time for me to proceed to the <HI>Fourth general Thing</HI> propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> To draw an Inference or two from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="004648_0011_100DB69CA77B3168">
<P N="1">1. And fir&s;t then, if <HI>Two are better than One,</HI> and the Advantages of <HI>Religious Society</HI> are &s;o ma|ny and &s;o great, then it is the Duty of every true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> to &s;et on Foot, e&s;tabli&s;h &amp; promote, as much as in him lies <HI>Societies</HI> of this Nature. And I believe we may venture to affirm, that if ever a Spirit of true Chri&s;tianity is revived in the World, it mu&s;t be bro't about by &s;ome &s;uch Means as this. Motives, &s;urely, cannot be wanting, to &s;tir us up to this commendable &amp; nece&s;&s;ary Undertaking: For granting all hitherto advanced to be of no Force, yet methinks the &s;ingle Con&s;ideration that great Part of our Happine&s;s in Heaven will con&s;i&s;t in the <HI>Communion of Saints</HI>; or that the Intere&s;t as well as Piety of tho&s;e Sectari&s;ts that differ from us, is &s;trengthened &amp; &s;upported by nothing more than their frequent Meetings; either of the&s;e Con&s;i|derations, I &s;ay, one would think, &s;hould induce us to do our utmo&s;t to copy after their good Exam|ple, &amp; &s;ettle a la&s;ting &amp; pious <HI>Communion of Saints</HI> on Earth. Add to this that we find the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hed daily by &s;uch like Means; and &s;hall not the Kingdom of CHRIST be &s;et in Oppo&s;ition again&s;t it? Shall the Children of <HI>Belial</HI> a&s;&s;emble &amp; &s;trengthen each other in Wickedne&s;s; and &s;hall not the Children of GOD unite, and &s;trengthen them&s;elves in Piety? Shall Society <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Societies be countenanced for Midnight Revel|lings, and the promoting of <HI>Vice,</HI> and &s;carcely one be found intended for the Propagation of <HI>Virtue?</HI>&mdash; Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O Heavens at this!</P>
<P N="2">2. But this leads me to a &s;econd Inference; namely, to warn Per&s;ons of the great Danger tho&s;e are in, who either by their Sub&s;criptions,
<PB N="22" REF="004648_0012_100DB69FD6DFD1D8">
Pre&s;ence or Approbation, promote <HI>Societies</HI> of a quite oppo&s;ite Nature to Religion.</P>
<P>And here I would not be under&s;tood to mean only tho&s;e publick Meetings which are de&s;igned manife&s;tly for nothing el&s;e but Revellings and Banquetings, for Chambering &amp; Wantonne&s;s, and at which a mode&s;t <HI>Heathen</HI> would blu&s;h to be pre|&s;ent; but al&s;o tho&s;e &s;eemingly <HI>innocent</HI> Entertain|ments and Meetings which the <HI>politer</HI> Part of the World are &s;o very fond of, &amp; &s;pend &s;o much Time in: But which notwith&s;tanding, keep as many Per&s;ons out of a Sen&s;e of <HI>true Religion,</HI> as Intempe|rance, Debauchery or any other Crime whatever. Indeed, whil&s;t we are in this World, we mu&s;t have proper Relaxations, to fit us both for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of our Profe&s;&s;ion, &amp; Religion. But then, for Per&s;ons who call them&s;elves <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI>  that have &s;olemnly vowed at their Bapti&s;m, <HI>to renounce the Vanities of this &s;inful World</HI>; that are commanded in Scripture <HI>to ab&s;tain from all Appearance of Evil, and to have their Conver&s;ation in Heaven.</HI> For &s;uch Per&s;ons as the&s;e to &s;upport Meetings, that (to &s;ay no wor&s;e of them) are vain &amp; trifling, &amp; have a natural Ten|dency to draw off our Minds from GOD, is ab&s;urd, ridiculous, &amp; &s;inful. Surely <HI>Two are</HI> not <HI>better than One</HI> in this Ca&s;e: No; it is to be wi&s;hed there was not <HI>One</HI> to be found concerned in it. The &s;ooner we for&s;ake the <HI>a&s;&s;embling our&s;elves together</HI> in &s;uch a Manner, the better; and no matter how quickly the Cord that holds &s;uch <HI>Societies</HI> (was it a Thou&s;and-fold) is broken.</P>
<P>But <HI>you, Brethren, have not &s;o learned</HI> CHRIST: But, on the contrary, like true Di&s;ciples of your LORD &amp; Ma&s;ter, have by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD
<PB N="23" REF="004648_0012_100DB69FD6DFD1D8">
(as this Evening's Solemnity abundantly te&s;tifies) happily formed your&s;elves into &s;uch <HI>Societies</HI>&punc; which, if duly attended on and improved, cannot but &s;trengthen you in your Chri&s;tian Warfare, and <HI>make you fruitful in every good Word and Work.</HI></P>
<P>What remains for me to do, but, as was propo|sed, in the la&s;t Place, to clo&s;e up what has been &s;aid, in a Word or two, by Way of Exhortation from the whole, &amp; to be&s;eech you, in the Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, to go on in the Way you have begun; and by a con&s;tant con&s;cientious Attandance on your re&s;pective <HI>Societies,</HI> to di&s;|countenance Vice, encourage Virtue, and <HI>build each other up in the Knowledge and Fear of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Only permit me to <HI>&s;tir up your pure Minds, by Way of Remembrance,</HI> and to exhort you, <HI>if there be any Con&s;olation in</HI> CHRIST, <HI>any Fellow&s;hip of the Spirit,</HI> again and again to con&s;ider, that as all <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in general, &s;o all Members of <HI>Religious Societies</HI> in particular, are in an e&s;pecial Manner, as Hou&s;es built upon an Hill; &amp; that therefore it highly concerns you to <HI>walk circum&s;pectly</HI> towards tho&s;e that are without, and to <HI>take heed to your &s;elves, that your Conver&s;ation,</HI> in common Life, <HI>be as becometh</HI> &s;uch an open &amp; peculiar Profe&s;&s;ion <HI>of the Go&s;pel of</HI> CHRIST: Knowing that the Eyes of all Men are upon you, narrowly to in&s;pect every Circum&s;tance of your Behaviour; &amp; that every notorious wilful Mi&s;carriage of any &s;ingle Member, will, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, redound to the Scandal and Di&s;honour of your whole Fraternity.</P>
<P>Labour, therefore, my beloved Brethren, to let your Practice corre&s;pond to your Profe&s;&s;ion: And think not that it will be &s;ufficient for you to plead
<PB N="24" REF="004648_0013_100DB6A170F44D88">
at the la&s;t Day, LORD, have we not a&s;&s;embled our&s;elves together <HI>in thy Name,</HI>&amp; enlivened each other, by <HI>&s;inging P&s;alms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs?</HI> For verily, I &s;ay unto you notwith&s;tand|ing this, our ble&s;&s;ed LORD will bid you <HI>depart, from him</HI>; nay, that you &s;hall <HI>receive a greater Damnation,</HI> if, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e great Preten|&s;ions, you are found to be <HI>Workers of Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>But GOD forbid that any &s;uch Evil &s;hould be|fal you; that there &s;hould be ever a <HI>Judas,</HI> ever a Traitor among&s;t &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed Followers of our <HI>Common Ma&s;ter.</HI> No, on the contrary, the Excellency of your Rules, the Regularity of your Meetings, and more e&s;pecially your pious Zeal in a&s;&s;embling in &s;uch a publick and &s;olemn Manner &s;o frequently in the Year, per&s;uade me to think, that you are willing, not barely to <HI>&s;eem,</HI> but to <HI>be</HI> in <HI>Reality, Chri&s;tians</HI>; &amp; hope to be found at the <HI>La&s;t Day,</HI> what you would be e&s;teemed <HI>now, viz.</HI> holy, &s;incere Di&s;ciples of a Crucified Redeemer.</P>
<P>Oh, may you always continue thus minded&punc; &amp; make it your daily, con&s;tant Endeavour, both by Precept and Example, to turn all you conver&s;e with, more e&s;pecially tho&s;e of your own <HI>Societies,</HI> in the &s;ame mo&s;t Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit and Temper&punc; Thus will you adorn the Go&s;pel of our Lord JE|SUS CHRIST, in all Things: Thus will you an|ticipate the Happine&s;s of a future State; and by attending on, and improving <HI>the Communion of Saints</HI> on Earth, make your&s;elves meet to join the Communion and Fellow&s;hip of the Spirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect, of the Holy Angels, nay, of the Ever Ble&s;&s;ed and Eternal GOD in Heaven.</P>
