<P>OUR a&s;&s;embling at this time, and place, &s;peaks the occa&s;ion import|ant&mdash;Among other de&s;igns of a more u&s;ual nature one principal object, is, to record the name of Jehovah in this Hou&s;e, which has lately, been erected for his prai&s;e. <HI>And now, for the fir&s;t time,</HI> we are called upon to enkindle upon <HI>this Altar,</HI> through the aids of the holy Spirit, tho&s;e holy and devout af|fections towards GOD, which may reach his throne as &s;weet incen&s;e perfumed in the Blood of the Lamb. And how happy &s;hould we be, were the&s;e affections, we are now to offer, a prelude to our &s;tanding in the pre|&s;ence of GOD above, and joining with the heavenly ho&s;ts, and all the redeemed, in their more pure, and eternal effu&s;ions of love, adoration and prai&s;e. But while we pre&s;ent our &s;acrifice here, we are to offer to

GOD, our devout acknowledgments&mdash;as for all his other mercies, &s;o in particular for this&mdash;the gift of &s;o convenient an edifice, which of his own free bounty and provi|dence he has enabled us to accompli&s;h&mdash;And finally, We are here to leave our vows with GOD&mdash;that we avouch the Lord Jehovah for our GOD, confe&s;&s;ing our entire dependence upon him, for all the pre&s;ent temporal and &s;piritual favors we enjoy&mdash;and all which we hope for, in the world to come.</P>
<P>That we may perform the&s;e exerci&s;es, in a becoming manner, may the Holy Spirit, who dwelt in the temple of old, de&s;cend in|to every heart, <HI>enlighten, guide, and direct us,</HI> that at the clo&s;e of this &s;ervice, and the clo&s;e of life, we may find to draw near to GOD is good, and that his loving kindne&s;s is better than life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord.</P>

<P N="3">3dly. Shall we again take but a cur&s;ory view of GOD's goodne&s;s towards us &s;ince the conclu|&s;ion of peace&mdash;As a nation, how greatly ble&s;&s;ed have we been in the formation, adoption, and e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Federal Government&mdash;The good hand of GOD, formed men for council, and wi&s;dom, brought them forward as the Fathers of the people, and guided them to unite the intere&s;t of individuals, with the good of the whole, in the formation of our general con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Through the guidance of God's good pro|vidence, this con&s;titution, has gone into the mo&s;t benign operation, without the lo&s;s of any man's life, and made us, in re&s;pect to our civil privileges, one of the happie&s;t people on the Globe.</P>
<P>To awaken in us a &s;en&s;e of GOD's great goodne&s;s in this particular, we need only turn our eyes, acro&s;s the Atlantic, and be|hold the anarchy, rage of party, and flowing blood of an allied nation: What could have re&s;cued us, from the horrors they experience, but that &s;ame good providence which has <HI>nouri&s;hed and brought us up as children</HI>&mdash;But who&s;e heart is not &s;mitten, and who&s;e eyes do not <HI>gu&s;h with tears,</HI> to hear of the &s;cenes

of woe and blood, tran&s;acted in the capital of France, and her other great cities, through means of civil di&s;cord. The&s;e &s;cenes by contra&s;t may ever teach us, the di&s;tingui&s;hing goodne&s;s of GOD towards us, and make us prize our liberties and civil ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>As to our increa&s;e in population and wealth, what nation has exceeded us? In the year 1783, at the conclu&s;ion of peace, the number of inhabitants in the United States were computed at 2, 389, 300&mdash;The la&s;t year they were computed upon a pretty accurate &s;cale of calculation, taken from the Cen&s;us of 1791, and the number was found to be 4, 784, 983&mdash;which makes an increa&s;e &s;ince the war, of 2, 395, 683&mdash;which is &s;ome thou|&s;ands more than double. Our internal wealth likewi&s;e has had a rapid increa&s;e&mdash; Our &s;hores are lined with &s;hips&mdash;Our com|merce is large and exten&s;ive&mdash;and for this two years, been greatly enriching to the country. Our Lands yield their increa&s;e by handfuls, through the ble&s;&s;ings of GOD on the labors of the hu&s;bandman. Our country <HI>does much</HI> in feeding the I&s;lands of the &s;ea, and even many on the ea&s;tern continent. Our granaries are full; affording all manner of &s;tore. The pre&s;ent year in a &s;pecial man|ner, the earth has afforded us, rich and liber|al &s;upplies of every nece&s;&s;ary and valuable

<P>In addition to the&s;e in&s;tances of GOD's great goodne&s;s towards us, as a people, we have to notice the continuation of the im|portant life of our chief Magi&s;trate, The Pre&s;ident of the United States&mdash;Many things in the peace, order, and happine&s;s of our country have &s;eemed to depend much upon his wi&s;e and energetic management&mdash;And none can fore&s;ee, what a righteous provi|dence may &s;uffer to take place when he falls. Our confidence ought to be in GOD, who is able to form another of equal wi&s;dom to fill his place&mdash;<HI>The lives</HI> al&s;o of mo&s;t of our chief Rulers have been continued.</P>
<P>We are to notice likewi&s;e the continuation of general health.

numbers end? The&s;e hints mu&s;t &s;uffice to bring into view GOD's great goodne&s;s to|wards us, as a nation, in a <HI>temporal view.</HI></P>
<P>And &s;hall we in the</P>
<P>4th And la&s;t place, hint at our religious privileges&mdash;their nature, and importance? But who can &s;peak of the in&s;tances of GOD's goodne&s;s in the&s;e?&mdash;A theme like this would be expo&s;ed in the hands of an angel&mdash;How much more in the hands of a potters ve&s;&s;el! &mdash;<HI>But</HI> let us ju&s;t ob&s;erve; the word of the ever ble&s;&s;ed GOD, <HI>is in our hands.</HI> It is giv|en in our own language, and we have abun|dant time, and opportunity to peru&s;e it&mdash;No religious tyranny pretends to interfere, to deprive us of any part of this ine&s;timable trea&s;ure&mdash;No inqui&s;ition u&s;urps the authority, of giving <HI>law</HI> to con&s;cience; or di&s;turbs our religious exerci&s;es&mdash;<HI>more &s;till,</HI> we have no religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by civil Iaw, or one man permitted to domineer over the con&s;cience of another&mdash;But every one is protected in his devotion by the civil arm, and not per|mitted to di&s;turb his neighbor.</P>
<P>One day in &s;even is immediately a&s;&s;igned for the wor&s;hip of GOD. This day, as yet, is reverenced more generally, by the people of the&s;e States, than in any other country&mdash; though in many ca&s;es as a chri&s;tian people, we ought to feel the depth of &s;hame, <HI>yea, horror,</HI> at our profanation of it&mdash;Still, the
<PB N="13" REF="030663_0012_0FE8551D0CD45510">

The Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s has ble&s;&s;ed us with the riche&s;t &s;upply of his cheering beams. How full is our land of the judicious labors of pious men. The truths of GOD's word, <HI>the law and go&s;pel,</HI> are made to &s;hine all around us.

<P><HI>Man by nature is a rebel again&s;t his</HI> GOD&mdash; By turning enemy to him, he has imbibed the Spirit; and has the black character of his Se|ducer.

of GOD, he &s;ent his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever &s;hould believe in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but &s;hould have eternal life.

<PB N="15" REF="030663_0014_0FE85525AAE55A90">
<HI>No wonder the Angels de&s;ire to look into the&s;e mi&s;teries</HI> of GOD's goodne&s;s.

<P>Again&mdash;GOD is infinitely good to us, in a &s;piritual view&mdash;not only in offering mercy, but in ab&s;olutely giving power to his ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel, and &s;aving a multitude of precious &s;ouls from de&s;truction.

<P>But at what period &s;hall we begin? Our minds are naturally carried back, to that de&s;olating &s;cene in which our former hou&s;e was laid in ruins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Nov. 26 1793&mdash;A fire broke out in a &s;tore in this city, owned by Me&s;&s;rs. Hubbards &amp; Greene, about &s;ix in the evening&mdash; and burnt with much fury. It continued to encrea&s;e, baffling all efforts to &s;uppre&s;s it, till it had con|&s;umed fifteen buildings, among which was the Meeting Hou&s;e&mdash;Through a kind Providence, the wind &s;uddenly &s;hifting carried the flames back from its fir&s;t cour&s;e&mdash;and by the vigorous exertions of the citizens, were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. No lives were lo&s;t. The lo&s;s of property in the whole was e&s;timated from eight to ten thou&s;and pounds.</NOTE>&mdash;The frown of GOD, lay upon us for that moment; many of us have felt the rebuke, till this hour&mdash;the judg|ment was terrible, though mingled with mer|cy. Our feelings as a &s;ociety, received a &s;en&s;ible check, in re&s;pect to our worldly pro&s;pects&mdash;but did not &s;ink. The Lord was kinder to us than we de&s;erved, and &s;pared the mo&s;t of our dwellings from the flames. Soon the cloud of GOD's di&s;plea&s;ure, began to <HI>di&s;&s;ipate,</HI> the fir&s;t meeting which was cal|led, for the purpo&s;e of rebuilding an hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, evidenced the good hand of

GOD towards us. The union, prudence, and mutual kindne&s;s, which appeared was &s;ingular. All as one, expre&s;&s;ed their wi&s;hes to attempt the execution of &s;o important a de&s;ign; and leave to the deci&s;ions of provi|dence, whether <HI>means</HI> could be obtained by gratuity, for the accompli&s;hment of it. As is was the Lord who put it into the hearts of the people of old, to give for the building of the temple; &s;ub&s;criptions for this purpo&s;e, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed our expectations. The attempt likewi&s;e to rai&s;e &s;upplies from our neigh|boring friends by lot, &s;ucceeded <HI>perfectly</HI>&mdash;beyond what might ju&s;tly be expected, e&s;pecially in the ca&s;e of tho&s;e donations which were generou&s;ly given <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were by Thomas Shaw E&s;q. of New-London, 262 Dollars, and Col.

<P>We are next to notice that the goodne&s;s of GOD has appeared great&mdash;in the procuring the materials&mdash;the location of the hou&s;e&mdash; the hazard of rearing of it up, and the labo|rious ta&s;k of fini&s;hing.
