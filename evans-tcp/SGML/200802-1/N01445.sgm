<L>That all <HI>my Joys</HI> from th' Premi&s;es do flow.</L>
<L>And yet I wou'd not have you think that I</L>
<L>Owe this <HI>great</HI> BLISS to Sen&s;uality,</L>
<L>No, mine 's a noble Flame.</L>
<L>Our Con&s;ort-Souls harmoniou&s;ly do move,</L>
<L>And Pilot-Rea&s;on dictates how to love.</L>
<L>The&s;e are the Plea&s;ures I 've been treating of,</L>
<L>Which tho' I'm full, I have not yet enough.</L>
<L>Dear Youth,</L>
<L>May your <HI>caelebian</HI> Sun &s;erenely &s;et,</L>
<L>And may indulgent Heaven then &s;ee fit,</L>
<L>To crown the Re&s;idue of your remaining Life</L>
<L>With that great Happine&s;s, a vertuous Wife,</L>
<L>And may You then with me</L>
<L>And Halcyon-Days, in that bright Orbit move,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Hymen</HI> dwells with all the Charms of Love.</L>
