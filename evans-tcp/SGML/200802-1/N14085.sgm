<HEAD>NARRATIVE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the late &s;cene in Bennington, which has clo&s;ed with my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, is not only in|tere&s;ting to my friends, who are fellow-&s;ufferers with me, but it is imagined that the knowledge of it may be u&s;eful to others, who have at lea&s;t a curio&s;ity to know, I would humbly reque&s;t the candour of the public, while I exhibit a &s;ummary view of it for the &s;atisfaction of inquirers.</P>
<P>This office, which I have accepted at the in&s;tance of many whom I much e&s;teem, I am not in&s;en&s;ible is as delicate as it is difficult for me to perform, as the innocent feelings of each one concerned are to be pre&s;erved unhurt, while truth and charity require that I deal faithfully with all.</P>
<P>To open the &s;cene, then, to the greater advantage, I would beg leave to acquaint the reader, that the ground on which it has been acted was, no longer ago than twenty three years, an entirely uncultivated and howling wilderne&s;s; lying about forty miles north-ea&s;t of Albany. The &s;oil being rich and luxu|riant, the &s;ituation high and &s;ightly, in a pure and healthy air, was neverthele&s;s very inviting to &s;ettlers. From &s;mall beginnings this town has ari&s;en to con&s;i|derable eminence and importance, in regard both of the number of its inhabitants and wealth; and in regard of military prowe&s;s, Bennington is thought to be &s;econd to none on the continent.</P>
<P>The original proprietors were chiefly Congregati|onal Separates, from different parts of New-Eng|land,
<PB N="6" REF="017823_0004_0FA31997044D3240">
who being weary of the re&s;traints of authority, and in fear of dwindling to nothing in their &s;cattered &s;ituation, were willing to embody together, that they might act out their principles without re&s;traint, and exhibit to the world the light of their religion.</P>
<P>This favorable &s;pot was then cho&s;en as the thea|tre of their glory. While they were few in number and feeble in their circum&s;tances, they were remarka|ble for their love of one another. Be&s;ides this there have been &s;ea&s;ons of e&s;pecial awakening and attenti|on here; and in the judgment of charity a happy number have been renewed and added to the Lord. This circum&s;tance has contributed not a little to the gaining them re&s;pect and even fame abroad, as a re|ligious people.</P>
<P>As a number of profe&s;&s;ors, not of the &s;eparate or|der, have become inhabitants of the town, and have had great re&s;pect for the per&s;onal and mini&s;terial en|dowments of the Rev. Mr. DEWEY, who was of catholic and liberal principles, they have, at dif|ferent periods joined the communion here.&mdash;And it is to be hoped that, by conver&s;ing with chri&s;|tians of other di&s;tinctions, and by a more liberal train of thinking, the&s;e walls of jealou&s;y, &s;hyne&s;s and &s;e|peration, which now divide profe&s;&s;ors, will &s;oon be demoli&s;hed; and go&s;pel union and affection be re|&s;tored in the hou&s;e of Chri&s;t's friends.</P>
<P>My worthy predece&s;&s;or, who held his office here about fifteen years, was no &s;ooner gathered to his fathers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DEC, 21, 1778.</NOTE>, than the united attention of this people was turned upon me to become his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Ac|cordingly I made them a vi&s;it in January 1780, when I was received with great warmth of affection. This vi&s;it I continued until the la&s;t of February, when the people were plea&s;ed to give me a call for &s;ettlement,
<PB N="7" REF="017823_0005_0FA3199800B993D0">
with only one di&s;&s;entient in the church, and one in the congregation.</P>
<P>From this great union and good agreement, after they had had a fair opportunity of knowing my &s;en|timents on religion, I was induced to think that here was laid a happy foundat&s;on for my living in the af|fections of the people, and for my being u&s;eful in this part of the vineyard, where labourers are very much needed. And being willing to make a &s;acri|fice of other views and pro&s;pects, for the &s;ake of doing this people good, I did, on the tenth of April, accept their invitation to &s;ettle here.</P>
<P>It being not my intention to de&s;cend to many mi|nute circum&s;tances in this narration, I &s;hould gladly pa&s;s the following one in &s;ilence, did it not claim par|ticular notice, as it &s;hows the nature, as well as the beginning of our confu&s;ions. The incident is this: That when, upon giving my an&s;wer to the people's call, I propo&s;ed that they would be plea&s;ed to appoint a day and a council for my in&s;talment,&mdash;The Hon. JOHN FASSET, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who had objected again&s;t &s;ending for me in the fir&s;t place, and who had been uniformly again&s;t me all along, was plea&s;ed to object again&s;t its being done at pre&s;ent, it being cold and late in the day. And notwith&s;tanding the appointment might have been made in le&s;s time than was con&s;umed in &s;huffling it off, it was po&s;tponed from Monday until Friday.</P>
<P>And when the Friday-meeting came on, there appeared the &s;tronge&s;t jealou&s;y&mdash;That all was not right&mdash;that I held dangerous &s;entiments in my heart, which I was unwilling now to bring out, and that the people were taking a ha&s;ty &s;tep, which they might have occa&s;ion to tread back at a future period. This will be truly &s;urprizing, when it &s;hall be known, that as yet I had broached no one &s;enti|ment
<PB N="8" REF="017823_0006_0FA319992E097DF0">
different from what I had clearly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, to the entire &s;atisfaction of the church, previous to their call. The con&s;equence of all was, that after much had been done to give content and to &s;ave the credit of the church, five brethren were again&s;t my in&s;tal|ment, and two or three profe&s;&s;ed to be neuters.</P>
<P>The incivility and the indeceney of this u&s;age of a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and the interruption of the peace and harmony of the town, met with de&s;erved rebuke from men of feeling here. And while this manoeuvre failed of gaining the conductors of it that applau&s;e, which it might have gained them if they had not over-acted their part, they had difficulty in retreating &s;o as wholly to cover a de&s;ign,&mdash;and to &s;upport their profe&s;&s;ion as "I&s;raelites indeed, in whom is no guile."</P>
<P>This manoeuvre was no &s;ooner over, and the heat of men's &s;pirits abated, than the people very amica|bly agreed in making the nece&s;&s;ary appointments for the in&s;tallation without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The third day of May was the time of our attend|ing this &s;olemnity. And when there appeared be|fore the council but three di&s;&s;enters in the church, and only one in the congregation, the oppo&s;ition was &s;o &s;mall that I made no &s;cruple to renew my an&s;wer: which as it will give the reader an idea of my views, as well as of the manner of my induction, I beg leave to pre&s;ent him with it here.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"Dear brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"INASMUCH as it hath plea&s;ed the great Head of the church to turn your early attention to me, in your de&s;titute circum&s;tances; and ina&s;much as, af|ter a full and fair trial of my mini&s;terial qualifica|tions
<PB N="9" REF="017823_0007_0FA319994EC16F70">
and endowments, you have very unanimou&s;ly and very cheerfully invited me to take the pa&s;toral watch and care of you, under the great Shepherd of the &s;heep, for your &s;piritual edification and comfort; and finally, ina&s;much as this day of fa&s;ting and pray|er is, by mutual con&s;ent, appointed for our uniting as pa&s;tor and church: I do now, in the pre&s;ence of the living God, of the holy angels and of the&s;e wit|ne&s;&s;es, mo&s;t cheerfully e&s;pou&s;e you as a church of vi&s;ible believers; and I do hereby publi&s;h and de|clare my hearty compliance with your invitation and call to become your pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>And ina&s;much as I have heretofore been duly or|dained an officer in Chri&s;t's kingdom, by "the lay|ing on of the hands of the pre&s;bytery," whereby I am inve&s;ted with full power and authority to admi|ni&s;ter &s;ealing ordinances, and to do all the duties of a mini&s;ter in God's hou&s;e; and ina&s;much as I can receive no new, nor even any acce&s;&s;ion of power by a re-ordination; I do now, without &s;ome of the u|&s;ual ceremonies of an in&s;talment, thus publicly ac|knowledge and declare my&s;elf to be under the mo&s;t &s;acred vows to exerci&s;e my office, and to do all the duties of the pa&s;tor of this church, according to the tenor of the charge given to Timothy or Titus, or to any other pa&s;tor of new te&s;tament de&s;cription, &s;o long as God in his providence &s;hall continue me with you. And, in reliance on divine grace, I do engage to exerci&s;e this my office for your edification and not de&s;truction, that I may hope to pre&s;ent you as a cho&s;en virgin to Chri&s;t, to whom I am to give account, that you and I may rejoice together at his appearing.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion, I hope that your goodne&s;s, my brethren, will &s;uffer me to mention to you that I have great confidence in your zeal and faithfulne&s;s,
<PB N="10" REF="017823_0008_0FA3199A0653EF20">
that you will concur with me in every prudent mea|&s;ure for the reviving and &s;upporting of church di&s;|cipline, to the end that the erroneous may be cor|rected, the vicious and the impenitent may be ex|cluded, and that the ju&s;t may be vindicated and en|couraged; or, to &s;peak in the language of the Apo&s;|tle Jude, "Of &s;ome have compa&s;&s;ion, making a dif|ference; and others &s;ave with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garments &s;potted by the fle&s;h." In this way will you become con&s;picu|ous as a city on a hill; and in this way will the "KING greatly de&s;ire your beauty."</P>
<P>Finally, my brethren, as you regard your own advancement, the be&s;t intere&s;t and good of others, and the glory of God in the kingdom of redemption, you will afford me the chri&s;tian charity of your prayers, that I may be guided by the &s;pirit of truth; that I may have fortitude and &s;trength for every en|counter; that I may defend the go&s;pel again&s;t all oppo&s;ers; that I may &s;tand in an evil day; that I may make full proof of my mini&s;try; that I may turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s; and that at la&s;t I may meet the approbation of my Judge&mdash;"to whom be glory in the church by Chri&s;t Je&s;us, throughout all ages, world without end." Amen.</P>
<P>In the next place I would turn my addre&s;s to the people of the congregation, who u&s;ually meet for public wor&s;hip with the church here.</P>
<P>My dear friends,</P>
<P>Your cheerful and unanimous concurrence with the church, in calling me to labour in this part of the vineyard, hath been no &s;mall inducement to me to &s;ettle among&s;t you.</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as the holy &s;criptures, and indeed the very nature of the thing, do manife&s;tly make a di&s;|tinction between an evangeli&s;t and a pa&s;tor; the lat|ter
<PB N="11" REF="017823_0009_0FA3199AC5215AC0">
having relation to church, lead in the di&s;cipline of it, and the former having no &s;uch charge, I beg leave to avail my&s;elf of this di&s;tinct on now.</P>
<P>Upon this principle would I proceed therefore to declare, in the witne&s;&s;ing view of heaven and of this a&s;&s;embly, that I do very cordially accept your invitation to me to become your mini&s;ter. And I do hereby engage to exerci&s;e my office as a preacher of the go&s;pel among&s;t you, to notice your morals, to &s;eek your be&s;t intere&s;t, and to watch for your &s;ouls and the &s;ouls of your children, as one who mu&s;t give account to God.</P>
<P>And give me leave, my people, to a&s;&s;ure you, in this public manner, that I have great plea&s;ure in the thought that you will give your con&s;tant attend|ance on my mini&s;try; and that you will, in honour|able and effectual ways, exert your&s;elves, with &s;pirit, to encourage my heart and to &s;trengthen my hands, in this good work which I have now undertaken for your benefit and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>And, Oh! that my labours may not be in vain, as to any of you, my precious charge! While I &s;hall be continued your mini&s;ter, it will, I tru&s;t, be the af|fectionate prayer of my heart, that you may be giv|en me as the &s;eal of my mini&s;try, and as the crown of my rejoicing in the day of the Lord Je&s;us.</P>
<CLOSER>Amen and Amen."</CLOSER>

<P>When the eyes of the people thus &s;aw their teach|er, there was vi&s;ibly a great and general joy, as might naturally be expected upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion. The noi&s;e and clamour, which before had been &s;o great, being now hu&s;ht to &s;ilence, and my oppo&s;ers &s;eeming unwilling to appear in arms, the people fe|licitated them&s;elves much in pro&s;pect of increa&s;ing delight in my mini&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="017823_0010_0FA3199B86536A50">
But as bright and halcyon days &s;eldom continue long without a cloud, &s;o it was not long before this tranquility was greatly interrupted, when a rencoun|ter commenced, in a way little expected by one un|acquainted with &s;uch operations.</P>
<P>Some time in June, the head of the oppo&s;ing par|ty pre&s;ented, to the church, a &s;mall li&s;t of grievan|ces, ari&s;ing from my preaching, which he de&s;ired might be accepted as a &s;ufficient apology for his withdraw from the wor&s;hip of God where I guided the a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>This gentleman pleaded, that although he could not and dared not &s;ay that my doctrines were un|&s;criptural, yet, as he could not &s;ee them to be right, he judged that he ought not to be compelled to hear that which he deemed not for edification. Be&s;ides, he wi&s;hed that, if he were in an error about my doc|trines, or did not rightly apprehend my &s;entiments, the church would bear with his weakne&s;s and afford him help by conference; that he and they might yet walk together in love.</P>
<P>Although the church had no idea that this apolo|gy ought to have been accepted by them, yet be|ing willing to gratify a brother, in a ca&s;e that re|&s;pected faith and con&s;cience, they readily complied with the motion for a conference.</P>
<P>In managing this interview, the church were very particular in explaining the grounds and rea&s;ons of their belief in tho&s;e points which were &s;o &s;tumbling to their brother. But their explanation was &s;o far from yielding him &s;atisfaction, that it appeared only to give an edge to his feelings. Hence there com|menced a long and tedious di&s;pute. But after a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing trial of this expedient, Mr. Fa&s;&s;et was more di&s;&s;atisfied, and more burdened, about my principles than before. But this was not all&mdash;by
<PB N="13" REF="017823_0011_0FA3199C44C23360">
this time, a number of others had collected courage enough to come out, and declare them&s;elves di&s;&s;atis|fied with the &s;ame points that had been the ground of di&s;pute now in the church.</P>
<P>While this conference made work and made way for one or two more, there was found no be|nefit ari&s;ing from it, except it was to &s;ee under who&s;e banners one and another would appear. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid of almo&s;t every conference on the &s;ubject of grievances. For as the di&s;&s;enting intere&s;t began now to gain credit and to lift up its head, &s;o, at almo&s;t every conference, &s;ome new re|cruit would be found paraded on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. And thus the church appeared to be daily dividing again&s;t it&s;elf, and to threaten a general convul&s;ion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, if town fame is true, the leaders in the oppo&s;ition &s;ounded the feelings of many from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, thereby exciting the &s;ympathy of weakne&s;s in their favour, becau&s;e of their burdens and great di&s;tre&s;&s;es. So that there was little now to be heard, from any quarter, but the cry of grievances.</P>
<P>At length, being weary, by hearing the dolorous &s;ound of unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content, and willing to make their patience and conde&s;cen&s;ion as con&s;picu|ous as their love of order, the church did, notwith|&s;tanding confering had hitherto been quite unavail|ing, &s;o far yield to the dint of importunity as to con|&s;ent to meet them once more in conference. Ac|cordingly, very early in January following, the church a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee if any thing more could be done, in this way, towards giving content to their troubled brethren. Care being had to the aggrieved's &s;en&s;e of the articles of their burden; and it being found that, in ca&s;e the church &s;hould fail in clearing them up to their liking and acceptance, they would
<PB N="14" REF="017823_0012_0FA3199D060C7258">
continue &s;till to ab&s;ent them&s;elves from my mini&s;try, our &s;ituation became truly alarming; and we began now to apprehend danger from the very mea&s;ures which we were pur&s;uing with our brethren, who were bound to the &s;ame ob&s;ervance, of rule and or|der as we were.</P>
<P>The church, upon this, needed very little time to con&s;ider that the&s;e articles of grievance, as they were &s;tiled, were properly to be deemed articles of charge and complaint again&s;t the pa&s;tor, for mal|admini&s;tration. And by this time, their eyes were opened to &s;ee that they were going upon enchanted ground, while they were &s;uffering charges to be brought thus again&s;t a brother, and e&s;pecially again&s;t an elder, under the fallacious cloak of grievances, when there had been no private labour with the brother complained of, as a nece&s;&s;ary and an indi&s;pen&s;ible pre-requi&s;ite to a public hearing of a ca&s;e, of &s;uch nature and degree as to be made the ground of &s;eparation among&s;t brethren.</P>
<P>Accordingly, con&s;idering that no one hath right to be grieved with his brother, except for tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion&mdash;that, in ca&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, it is antichri&s;tian and cruel to pro&s;ecute a brother publicly, before private influence has been exerted betwixt the par|ties alone&mdash;that a church hath no right to hear a ca&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion debated, except in the appoint|ed way of di&s;cipline:&mdash;Con&s;idering al&s;o, that the practice of telling grievances, which are real charges, is an abu&s;ive way of pro&s;ecuting a brother, contra|ry to the dictates both of humanity and revelation&mdash;and that it hath a direct tendency to create fears, &s;u&s;picions, jealou&s;ies, heart burnings, and alienati|ons of affection, the bane and ruin of all intercou&s;e, communion and happine&s;s in a church&mdash;and finally being determined to &s;upport the credit of religion
<PB N="15" REF="017823_0013_0FA3199DC3FB93B8">
and the honor of their own profe&s;&s;ion:&mdash;the church, at la&s;t, very wifely re&s;olved, that they would allow of this u&s;age no more.</P>
<P>How painful, and how confounding to the views and &s;chemes of our great advocates for the practice, now laid a&s;ide by the church, this re&s;olution was, is hard to &s;ay. The mo&s;t piteous out-cry was now made, that could well have been made, had the church voted again&s;t one of the fir&s;t privileges of the kingdom of heaven. And notwith&s;tanding the popular cry of tyranny and intolerance, the church have done them&s;elves the honour hitherto to &s;upport, with fortitude, their good re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The way being thus prepared, I urged upon my oppo&s;ers, with great &s;olemnity, that they &s;hould treat me according to Chri&s;t's law of di&s;cipline, in ca&s;e I had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, in my preaching, on the ac|count of which they were &s;o much offended as to turn their backs upon my mini&s;try&mdash;to the end that they might appear to regard the divine authority, and that I might know my crime and repent.</P>
<P>But, being per&s;uaded that they could not make a chargelye again&s;t me, and unwilling to hazard a le|gal trial, in which, if they &s;hould fail, they mu&s;t abide the con&s;equences, they excu&s;ed them&s;elves from this irk&s;ome ta&s;k, by &s;aying that they did not know, and &s;o did not choo&s;e to &s;ay, that I had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, or that my preaching, in the lea&s;t, erred from the divine word.</P>
<P>When they were reminded of what had been re|peated to them times out of mind, that they could not be ju&s;tified, in their withdrawing from the wor|&s;hip, and interrupting the communion by treating the pa&s;tor as an offender, for his preaching, unle&s;s they could &s;hew that the pa&s;tor had erred, and that his preaching was corrupt; and that, in &s;uch ca&s;e,
<PB N="16" REF="017823_0014_0FA3199E84C11250">
they could not be excu&s;ed from &s;o plain and &s;o binding a duty as that of di&s;cipline&mdash;they replied, that ina&s;much as the preaching was of public no|toriety and expo&s;ed to every one's remark, the pri|vate &s;teps of di&s;cipline might lawfully be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>But when they were reminded of the principles of the church on this head, that Chri&s;t's law of di&s;ci|pline is not to be re&s;tricted to private offences and tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, but that it re&s;pects tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as well pub|lic as private, and may, in no ca&s;e of tre&s;pa&s;s, be di&s;|pen&s;ed with&mdash;and that every one who is guilty of tre&s;pa&s;s is entitled to the priviledge of being di&s;|ciplined according to law&mdash;and that, they ought, therefore, to extend this privilege to the pa&s;tor, would they keep them&s;elves in countenance, even if it were only their opinion that he had erred in his preaching:&mdash;they had the &s;agacity to avail them|&s;elves of a method, as extraordinary as their ca&s;e now required to help them out of a pinch, which was, to deny that they con&s;idered me as a member of the church, over whom they were to exerci&s;e bro|therly watch. This was their rea&s;oning to make it out: That I was not a member unle&s;s a pa&s;tor of the church&mdash;that I was not a pa&s;tor unle&s;s ordain|ed&mdash;that I was not ordained legally unle&s;s by the power of the brotherhood;&mdash;but ina&s;much as my ordination was by the pre&s;bytery, by virtue of their own office-power without any inve&s;titure from the brotherhood&mdash;they could not &s;ee that I was an offi|cer, nor that I belonged to their communion. And when they were reminded that as the &s;ubject of my ordination had been largely con&s;idered by the church and by them&s;elves too, not only previous to my in&s;talment but to their giving their call, and that my denying the right of ordination in the brother|hood,
<PB N="17" REF="017823_0015_0FA3199F43FDCA20">
by no means invalidated my ordination by the pre&s;bytery, much le&s;s de&s;troyed it, or made it out that it was no ordination: they an&s;wered that they had not &s;o well con&s;idered this matter before, as they had &s;ince my introduction.</P>
<P>The principal actor being now &s;truck off from the &s;tage, the &s;cene &s;uddenly &s;hifted, and a&s;&s;umed a new form, much to the &s;urprize of the &s;pectators, when the whole train of grievances was now brought in again&s;t the church, for their receiving me and my doctrines. Lay ordination, allowed by Cambridge platform and practi&s;ed by many great and good men, and which is one of the principal bulwarks of the &s;eparate intere&s;t&mdash;the danger of &s;ur|rendering the privileges of the church into the hands of tho&s;e who explode the power of the bro|therhood in ordination&mdash;That by receiving a mini&s;|ter who does not fellow&s;hip the doctrine of lay or|dination is building the things which they once de|&s;troyed, and thereby making them&s;elves tran&s;gre&s;&s;|ors&mdash;were popular themes to harp upon, and like a vade-mecum, were always at command when occa&s;i|on called for them.</P>
<P>The church having now become the declared ob|ject of our brethren's grief and unea&s;ine&s;s; and as it was proper that they &s;hould be allowed an oppor|tunity of telling us ought that they had again&s;t us; the &s;econd day of March was appointed for a full audience, when every article, to be con&s;idered, &s;hould be &s;tated in writing. The church met ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>But when it was found that our brethren would not &s;ay that they were aggrieved, on the account of any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the church; and that they were unwilling to treat tho&s;e articles as grounds of di&s;ci|pline; notwith&s;tanding they could not walk with the
<PB N="18" REF="017823_0016_0FA319A00514E358">
church as they now were&mdash;con&s;idering al&s;o that bringing the&s;e articles again&s;t the church, when they had no iniquity to lay to their charge, was in reali|ty, though under cover, obliquely pro&s;ecuting the pa&s;tor, as he was the mark to which all their arrows were &s;till pointed; the church judged it not their duty to con&s;ume time in hearing complaints again&s;t them&s;elves, any &s;ooner than they would again&s;t a brother, unle&s;s they were for &s;ome bad conduct, ei|ther real or &s;uppo&s;ed; and that it would be early enough for them to confer with the aggrieved when they &s;hould declare them&s;elves aggrieved on the ac|count of &s;in, either real or &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>However, con&s;idering that, by the unwarrantable mea&s;ures now pur&s;ued, the doctrines of Chri&s;t were daily growing into di&s;repute; that the dignity of the mini&s;terial office was hereby degraded and brought down to the du&s;t of men's feet; and that the breach of friend&s;hip was con&s;tantly &s;preading it&s;elf like fire, and threatening general ruin to the church:&mdash;we propo&s;ed, in much conde&s;cen&s;ion to our brethren, to call in the aid of mutual council, if peradventure they might do ought to &s;ave us, before our ca&s;e &s;hould become incurable. The conditions were, that each party &s;hould chu&s;e whom they plea&s;ed, and no one &s;hould fault his brother's choice. This motion was very readily agreed to, and a council appointed. The church appointed mini&s;ters of the &s;tanding or|der, and the aggrieved mini&s;ters of the &s;trict congre|gational order, as the &s;eparates are &s;tiled.</P>
<P>Our di&s;putes being now referred to an enlighten|ed and judicious board, in whom we placed great confidence, we enjoyed, for a moment, a little ce&s;&s;a|tion; and we fondly felicitated our&s;elves on the pro&s;pect of our receiving much &s;atisfaction from the gentlemen. But, in the mean time, the &s;ending of
<PB N="19" REF="017823_0017_0FA319A0C65402A8">
our letters mi&s;&s;ive was unexpectedly delayed, for &s;ome weeks, when there were found plau&s;ible objec|tions again&s;t our &s;ending for the council at pre&s;ent. However, the church were quite happy in finding them&s;elves able &s;o far to &s;urmount tho&s;e huge diffi|culties as to agree, the &s;econd time, to &s;end for the men, whom they, according to accepted propo&s;als, had cho&s;en for coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>But when the much wi&s;hed for time for the &s;e&s;&s;ion of council had arrived<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">25<HI>th of May</HI> 1781</NOTE>, we were made to know, by a very affecting providence, that it was not the de|&s;ign of Chri&s;t that there &s;hould yet be an end put to our troubles. For ina&s;much as all the gentlemen ap|pointed by the aggrieved failed, the other could do little more than to behold our mi&s;ery and return, leaving us, like &s;hip wrecked mariners, &s;till buffet|ed by the waves. A double gloom was now ca&s;t upon the face of our affairs; and indeed we walked in darkne&s;s and had no light!</P>
<P>The church, hitherto unwilling to cro&s;s the incli|nations, the humours and prejudices of the aggriev|ed, in any thing which they could with any colour avoid, le&s;t they might &s;eem to be inattentive to their comforts and delights, &s;o far allowed them to rule as to omit the celebration of the Lords &s;up|per untill now. But finding, upon trial, that this conformity to them was as fruitle&s;s as it was unwar|rantable, it being turned into wantonne&s;s by them, the church felt them&s;elves approved for their own folly, and on the fir&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> them communed toge|ther, in this ordinance, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince my in|&s;talment.</P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding the church profe&s;&s;ed to have communed with Chri&s;t, at his table,&mdash;to have &s;at under his &s;hadow with great delight,&mdash;and to have
<PB N="20" REF="017823_0018_0FA319A186173058">
found his fruit &s;weet to their ta&s;te,&mdash;our aggrieved brethren took great umbrage at our conduct, &s;tig|mati&s;ing it with the opprobrious epithets of prema|ture, ra&s;h and unwarrantable, as well publicly as privately from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. However, had we waited longer for a &s;ettlement of the grievances, pre|&s;ented only in a way of complaining of certain things which they did not like, we might have left our gift at the altar until now, without know|ing, in a legal way, that they had ought again&s;t us: For their telling us, not in a way of di&s;cipline, that they could not believe as the church did, re|&s;pecting my introduction and doctrines; when at the &s;ame time they declared, that they were not grieved with the church on the account of &s;ins; what was there for us to remember that our bre|thren had again&s;t us? The truth is, that a church &s;hould never neglect a plain duty that good might come. The way of duty is the way of &s;afety&mdash;and we are to expect light and comfort only in the way of the keeping of Chri&s;t's commandments. And "they who ob&s;erve lying vanities, for&s;ake their own mercy."<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Jonah ii. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>De&s;pairing now of the church's turning from the &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s of their purpo&s;e not to take cognizance of grievances, which were not on the account of &s;ing our brethren judged it time to turn their at|tention to other mea&s;ures for redre&s;s. Accordingly, very early in autumn, they moved for a council of &s;eparate churches only, as the church had never profe&s;&s;ed to be in fellow&s;hip with any but tho&s;e of this order.</P>
<P>But, con&s;idering that the time was now pa&s;t for a council to prevent a rupture; that di&s;cipline ought to precede the dernier re&s;ort to council; that as
<PB N="21" REF="017823_0019_0FA319A245F90D80">
there had been made no complaint of error, nor of &s;in, we had no bu&s;ine&s;s proper for a council, as yet; and that, according to the propo&s;al for having none but &s;eparates, our election could not be free, and &s;o, af|ter all, the council could not be mutually cho&s;en: the church thought it not their duty to gratify them in their reque&s;t.</P>
<P>But this denial having given no conviction to our brethren, either of the impropriety of their motion, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of their duty to be in &s;ubjection to the church, with whom they were bound to walk in charity, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> all humility and reverence; they had the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of their own heads, to appoint and exparte <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;uch churches as they had propo&s;ed for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> and appointment.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;cheme, however, they were far from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> according to their wi&s;hes.

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, the Rev. Mr. Palmer, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his brethren in the exparte appointment, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a vi&s;it to &s;ee how we did, and to know if <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> members had any rea&s;on or occa&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> council's coming. And to gratify this gentleman, who had expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much love and concern for us, we &s;pent a day in relating to him the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and progre&s;s of our di&s;putes, from my fir&s;t coming among&s;t this people, until then. And af|ter a full hearing, on both &s;ides, M. Palmer told the aggrieved plainly that he &s;aw no rea&s;on why they &s;hould &s;end for a council. This di&s;appoint|ment was as grievous, it may be pre&s;umed, as it was unexpected. However, like every thing el&s;e on
<PB N="22" REF="017823_0020_0FA319A376D4B288">
this &s;ubject, it unhappily failed in affording that conviction, which was fervently prayed it might af|ford, to check their fiery ambition; although they were not a little mortified that their own mea&s;ures had &s;o unfortunately turned again&s;t their darling views.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on following was remarkable for nothing more than the production of two additional articles of grievance, though not on account of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in the church. The&s;e were made the pretext for calling the church together, &s;ome time in May, when, a|vailing them&s;elves of them, together with all the o|ther articles, which &s;till di&s;turbed the peace of their conferences as much as ever, our zealous brethren, with great warmth, renewed their application for a council. But being unwilling to countenance a motion, which now &s;avoured &s;trongly of a de&s;ire in them, not &s;o much to gain light as to be availed of in|fluence, by which they might hope to have their own mea&s;ures &s;anctified and they them&s;elves placed a|bove the reach of blame; although we had no un|ea&s;y apprehen&s;ions from that quarter; and con&s;i|dering that there &s;till exi&s;ted the &s;ame objections a|gain&s;t our &s;ending now for a council, as there did la&s;t fall when we rejected this motion; and indeed being filled with a &s;en&s;e that our own dignity, that propriety and decency would not allow us to treat the ordinance of councils with &s;o great di&s;re&s;pect, as to &s;end for one, when it had been already judged, that we had nothing prepared to be laid before any board from abroad: the church was obliged, upon principle, once more to deny them.</P>
<P>Finding them&s;elves foiled and baffled in all their attempts for a council, our brethren had now but little hope of &s;ucceeding in the cour&s;e which they held; and, it &s;eems that, they would have been
<PB N="23" REF="017823_0021_0FA319A3EA76E150">
quite in de&s;pair, had not the &s;uppo&s;ed goodne&s;s of their cau&s;e been to them as a reviving cordial to keep up their &s;pirits, while they imagined that God would yet appear for them, and bring light out of pre&s;ent darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Of this de&s;ponding countenance was a reque&s;t, as ab&s;urd as it was extraordinary, which they made to the church, in the beginning of fall, that we would di&s;mi&s;s them in regular &s;tanding and in chri&s;|tian fellow&s;hip, that they might be a church by them|&s;elves. The impropriety, if not the impo&s;&s;ibility, of our granting this reque&s;t to tho&s;e, who had virtually if not formally renounced our fellow&s;hip, and who&s;e only rea&s;on for this motion was, that the church held to &s;uch a faith and practice as that they could not commune with us, appears evidently at fir&s;t blu&s;h. For if they could not hold fellow&s;hip with us when we were related to each other as members of one body; how could they do it when we &s;hould be divided in|to two? Be&s;ides, we were per&s;uaded that the laws of God's hou&s;e make no provi&s;ion for a church's di|viding on points which prevent, not only the higher acts of communion at the table, but even their pray|ing and wor&s;hiping together, either upon the &s;ab|bath or any other day; except by regular di&s;cipline; but then not in fellow&s;hip. To &s;uppo&s;e the contrary would be to make profe&s;&s;ors covenant breakers ac|cording to law. But this is both ab&s;urd and im|po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all this, &s;o intent had the church hitherto been on making their patience, their forbearance and their conde&s;cen&s;ion as great, as was their brethren's want of the&s;e virtues, they would have attended to any arguments which might have been offered on the &s;ubject, had not their own con|duct rendered it inadmi&s;&s;ible. For as one of the
<PB N="24" REF="017823_0022_0FA319A484D30028">
&s;igners of their reque&s;t was under public di&s;cipline, in a very heavy charge of here&s;y and &s;candal, their petition carried in it a reque&s;t that we would acquit him of this charge when he had done nothing to &s;a|tisfy it. And when they were reminded of this in|delicacy and impropriety, &s;o far were they from a di&s;po&s;ition to expunge his name, and leave his ca&s;e to be decided in the church without them, that they cho&s;e rather to &s;tand or fall together, as the die might be ca&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as they allowed the &s;entiments to be ju&s;t which their brother was charged with broaching and maintaining; although they granted that he had been imprudent in declaring them; they were not a little intere&s;ted in the trial depending, and repeatedly urged the bringing of it on. This indeed was nece&s;&s;ary in order to their knowing what &s;tep to take next.</P>
<P>The trial of this brother was no &s;ooner i&s;&s;ued, in the church, than it was judged that there mu&s;t be i&s;&s;ued other mea&s;ures be&s;ides tho&s;e on which they had hitherto placed dependence. Accordingly they in&s;tantly circulated, through the church, a &s;ub&s;crip|tion, reque&s;ting a meeting "to &s;ee if the church would agree to call a council of churches, known by the name of &s;trict congregational churches, to look into the difficulties then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in this church, and to give their advice agreeable to Cam|bridge platform and our covenant."</P>
<P>After this paper had obtained the names of one half of the church, it was brought to me, for my direction. And, pa&s;&s;ing unnoticed the indignity of this low ceremony of jealou&s;y, I warned a meeting according to orders; but with le&s;s cheerfulne&s;s, than I &s;hould have done the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, had only one or two made this reque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="017823_0023_0FA319A54490A7C8">
It being now found, when the church came toge|ther, that my friends were overpowered by numbers, and con&s;idering that di&s;puting would be more likely to &s;tir up wrath, than to convince tho&s;e who could &s;how a majority, the council was appointed, accord|ing to de&s;ire, without indecorum.</P>
<P>Although I &s;aw no nece&s;&s;ity, nor any regularity or propriety in this appointment, as our affairs were circum&s;tanced&mdash;and although no one was under any obligation to plead, in defence, before the council, as there had been no legal proce&s;s to lay any under &s;uch obligations:&mdash;Yet being willing to embrace &s;o favourable an opportunity for propagating light, as well for the &s;atisfaction of the &s;pectators as of the council: I complied with the de&s;ire of my friends &s;o far as to give a stating of facts, as they had happened, and to correct &s;uch mi&s;takes and mi&s;repre&s;entations as might be made, in handling the &s;everal points &s;et up, by our aggrieved brethren.</P>
<P>That which has been improved as the occa&s;ion of &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s and debate, and of interrupting the communion here; and been the occa&s;ion of &s;o great a noi&s;e through the country; to the no &s;mall di&s;advantage of the go&s;pel, and to the wounding of religion, may be &s;een, as it is judiciou&s;ly drawn up in the following re&s;ult of council, which now in|vites the reader's attention.</P>

The council cho&s;e the Rev. E. Wright mode|rator, and J. Spalding for be.</P>
<P>The council being opened with prayer, proceeded to hear the Rev. Mr. Avery give a narration of the various &s;teps, by which the differences have ari&s;en which now &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the church. Several articles of grievance were then laid before the council, by a number of the brethren of the church, and the day being &s;pent, the council adjourned until eight o'clock the next morning.</P>
<P>May 27th, the council met, according to adjourn|ment, opened with prayer, and proceeded to hear di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the article of grievance re&s;pecting the church's departing from their covenant and plat|form, in receiving the Rev. Mr. Avery as their mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>The council having carefully attended to this ar|ticle of complaint or grievance, are of the opinion that the church have not departed from their cove|nant or platform, in receiving the Rev. Mr. Avery as their mini&s;ter; and that there is no ju&s;t cau&s;e of grievance on that account.</P>
<P>Secondly, The council proceeded to hear the fol|lowing articles of grievance or complaint again&s;t the church, for their receiving certain doctrines, de|livered by Mr. Avery, as &s;ound and orthodox, which they the aggrieved members look upon as er|roneous: which doctrines, for &s;ub&s;tance, are as follows&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That whatever an unregenerate man does, as a moral agent, is &s;in.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Chri&s;t's interce&s;&s;ion, in the court of heaven, is &s;uch as now operates again&s;t all the views, &s;chemes, and evil de&s;igns of the wicked, and will at la&s;t terminate in the utter ruin and overthrow of finally impenitent &s;inners.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="27" REF="017823_0025_0FA319A6C645A6E0">
3. That a man can do all that God requires of him, if he is but willing: or, in other words, that moral ability con&s;i&s;ts in the will.</P>
<P>The council having carefully examined what has been &s;aid for and again&s;t the&s;e doctrines, are of opi|nion that they are agreeable to divine revelation.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The council attended to the general run of the doctrines received by the church, as being mere &s;peculation.</P>
<P>As to this, we are of the opinion that tho&s;e who make this complaint are blameable!</P>
<P>Fourthly, The complaint relative to the church's receiving Leonard Robin&s;on to their communion, after he had been &s;et by for &s;everal years, although there had been no charge again&s;t him, was laid before the council.</P>
<P>Careful attention being paid to this article, we are of the opinion that the church did right in their re|ceiving Mr. Robin&s;on again to their communion.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The Rev. Mr. Avery was accu&s;ed to the council, as &s;aying&mdash;To make our appeal to creeds and confe&s;&s;ions of faith, as te&s;ts of orthodoxy, in|&s;tead of making it to the bible, in any cau&s;e re&s;pect|ing revelation, is more becoming papi&s;ts than pro|te&s;tant chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The council having heard Mr. Avery explain him&s;elf, as to this matter, are of the opinion that there was, in this, no ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence.</P>
<P>Sixthly, The di&s;cipline of the church, re&s;pecting Mr. Simeon Sears, was &s;ubmitted to the council for their opinion.</P>
<P>This being con&s;idered, we are of the opinion that the church's procedure again&s;t Mr. Sears was ju&s;t.</P>

<P>We would therefore earne&s;tly recommend to you to put away all &s;inful &s;trife and contentions; and each one, for him&s;elf, walk with God, in the tem|per of his heart, and tenor of his life, as the only way that will bring you to walk together in the kingdom and patience of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>The moderator then, in the pre&s;ence of the coun|cil, delivered the following admonition, to which they all gave con&s;ent. A copy has &s;ince been giv|en us for the pre&s;s.</P>
<Q><P>"I think it my duty, before I take my leave of you, to addre&s;s my&s;elf, in a particular manner to the aggrieved brethren, as they are called.</P>
<P>Beloved brethren,</P>
<P>From what I have &s;een and heard, in the cour&s;e of the trials which have been depending before this council, I am very deeply concerned for you and for the church in this place. I hope you will allow me to expre&s;s my concern for you, in dealing plainly and faithfully with you. It may be this will be the la&s;t opportunity that I &s;hall ever have to &s;ee you or to &s;peak to you; and I am unwilling to go away without leaving my te&s;timony with you.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, then, I have to tell you, that tho&s;e doctrines exhibited to the council, which you deny to be doctrines according to godline&s;s, I e&s;teem to be &s;ome of the great truths revealed in the word of God. I have believed them, and preached them for many years; and I have known them to be owned and ble&s;t of God for the awakening, and I tru&s;t for the conver&s;ion of many &s;ouls, e&s;pecially in the place where I live.</P>
<P>In your oppo&s;ing the&s;e doctrines, it appears to me that, you are oppo&s;ing &s;ome of the great truths, on which the faith and hope of the people of God depend. If we give up the&s;e doctrines, we do, in effect, give up the whole &s;y&s;tem of divine truths.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="017823_0028_0FA319A9045F4B10">
And notwith&s;tanding you may thing your&s;elves hone&s;t and upright, in oppo&s;ing Mr. Avery in the&s;e doctrines, I earne&s;tly be&s;eech you to con&s;ider whe|ther you are not really doing the devil's work. Sa|tan is endeavouring, various ways, and by any means that he can make u&s;e of, to root up the go&s;|pel to de&s;troy it from off the face of the earth: and what mu&s;t the unhappine&s;s of tho&s;e be that &s;erve him herein?</P>
<P>Furthermore, con&s;ider, I pray you, whether, by your means, the go&s;pel will not be driven away from Bennington; and this people be deprived of the means and ordinances of grace, whereby many poor &s;ouls may peri&s;h eternally, and their blood be required at your hands.&mdash;I really think, my brethren, that you have rea&s;on to fear that this may be the ca&s;e.&mdash;I therefore &s;eriou&s;ly entreat you not to think light of it.</P>
<P>In the next place, your neglecting your duty as members of this church, your not attending the or|dinances, the order and rule of God's hou&s;e, fills me with painful apprehen&s;ions for you. I have known &s;everal churches, that were as flouri&s;hing for a &s;ea|&s;on as any, perhaps, in the land, that by letting in &s;uch di&s;putes and contentions, and indulging a &s;pirit of divi&s;ion and &s;eperation, have gone on to bite and devour one another, till they have been con&s;umed one of another, and not the lea&s;t appearance of a vi&s;ible church left.</P>
<P>While I have the&s;e things in view, and con&s;ider|ing the circum&s;tances that this church is in, at pre|&s;ent, I have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to fear that this may be your ca&s;e here in Bennington; and that you will become like Shiloh of old, when the ark was taken from them. God is with his people while they hearken to his voice and obey his word: but if they
<PB N="31" REF="017823_0029_0FA319A9C3D20AE8">
walk contrary to him, he will walk contrary to them, and repent of the good wherewith he &s;aid he would benefit them.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Lev. xxvi. 23, 24. Jer. xviii. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Be entreated therefore, my brethren, to &s;top and con&s;ider your ways, le&s;t, if you go on as you have done, you may repent when it will be too late!</P>
<P>Thus, brethren, I mu&s;t take my leave of you, praying that God, of his &s;overeign grace and mercy, would direct and pre&s;erve you in the way that you &s;hould go."</P></Q>
<P>When, upon this occa&s;ion, the moderator put to vote the doings of council, my friends accepted of every article; but the aggrieved brethren accepted of none but the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Now finding that, notwith&s;tanding my oppo&s;ers were thus confounded by their own mea&s;ures, they &s;till maintained, in full &s;trength, their aver&s;ion to my doctrines and di&s;cipline; and that their ear could not be gained by all the eloquence and per&s;ua&s;ion of the worthy council of their own choice, the appoint|ment of which they had obtained with &s;o much ad|dre&s;s, I could not long he&s;itate what part to act.</P>
<P>Accordingly, being per&s;uaded of the truth of the wi&s;eman's maxim, as well in regard of the people as of my&s;elf, that "Better is a dry mor&s;el, and quiet|ne&s;s therewith, than a hou&s;e full of &s;acrifices with &s;trife,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvii 1.</NOTE> I re&s;igned my office here the 17th of June; but not without the livelie&s;t &s;en&s;e of grief for the very unhappy nece&s;&s;ity which compelled me to do it.</P>

<P>IT has been in my heart to live and to die with you. This I &s;hould &s;till be free to do, were there now a pro&s;pect of the continuance of my u&s;efulne&s;s, as there was when I fir&s;t came among&s;t you. But the bright and promi&s;ing pro&s;pects, which we con|templated with &s;o much plea&s;ure at fir&s;t, being now ob&s;cured and cut off, I am compelled by the &s;evere&s;t nece&s;&s;ity to relinqui&s;h my connexions here, that I

<P>As you have been con&s;tant &s;pectators and even actors in the affecting &s;cene in which I have &s;hared &s;uch a variety of misfortunes, you are not ignorant of the embarra&s;&s;ments and di&s;couragements which attend my mini&s;try here. And I cannot but do you the ju&s;tice to &s;uppo&s;e that you are of the &s;ame opi|nion with the late council, that the end of my mi|ni&s;try is &s;o much fru&s;trated, that it is beyond my power to do you that good, which you need to have done you by a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t. In this view of things, I am per&s;uaded that you will ju&s;tify me, when I re&s;ign my mini&s;terial watch over you, and reque&s;t you to con&s;ider the relation between us as null and void.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion, I beg leave to return my be&s;t thanks to you, for all that attention and re&s;pect which you have been plea&s;ed to &s;how me, in the cour&s;e of my connexions with you. And, from the feelings of my own heart, I am ready to hope that a remembrance of mutual good offices will be reciprocal and perpetual between us. Above all, allow me to hope, my dear friends, that you will never di&s;pute nor reject tho&s;e intere&s;ting doctrines which you have been taught from my lips, and which have been &s;o much di&s;credited by my mi&s;|judging brethren; that &s;o I may not be "the &s;avour of death unto death to you!"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2.

<P>We have anxiou&s;ly felt for you, in your embar|ra&s;&s;ments and perplexities; and it has been with great grief and concern, that we have been witne&s;|&s;es of tho&s;e di&s;&s;entions, in the church, which nece&s;|&s;itate you to be at liberty from us.</P>

<P>Thus has clo&s;ed a &s;cene which has made as di&s;|agreeable, as it has an unu&s;ual di&s;play, on the chri&s;|tian theatre. While the actors on one part have been intent on a favourite point, tho&s;e on the other part have contended earne&s;tly for the faith once delivered to the &s;aints. Who has acted a part worthy of imi|tation, is left to the reader's judgment&mdash;and who&s;e eye has been &s;ingle, in conducting this &s;cene, is humbly refered to the judgment of the great day.</P>
<P>I have now only to make a remark or two, and then I &s;hall put an end to this writing.</P>
<P N="1">1. I cannot but be of the opinion, that a princi|pal occa&s;ion of our confu&s;ions has been a neglect of church di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>Had di&s;cipline been &s;ea&s;onably and duly ob&s;erv|ed, it would, without doubt, have bla&s;ted, in the bud, tho&s;e evils which have brought forth &s;o much cor|rupt fruit. This would have prevented our bre|thren's taking up a cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s with my preaching, unle&s;s they had again&s;t it rea&s;ons &s;uf|ficient to ju&s;tify a public declaration. And, in &s;uch ca&s;e, they would not have made any public declara|tion
<PB N="38" REF="017823_0036_0FA319AF04306728">
before they had u&s;ed private influence to re|cover me from error. In this way, communion would not have been interrupted, and the peace and union of the church would have remained.&mdash;And I beg leave to add, that had the church turned their forbearance into di&s;cipline, they would either have gained their brethren, or el&s;e have excluded them from their communion according to law; and &s;o have pre&s;erved the dignity and order of God's hou&s;e.&mdash;But, alas, the day in which we live is a day when it is imagined that church di&s;cipline &s;avours rather of a hard and unchri&s;tian di&s;po&s;ition, than of that love and faithfulne&s;s which con&s;titute the bro|ther of Chri&s;t. Hence, hone&s;t men, who know their duty, are too much inclined to neglect this ordi|nance through fear of offence. But this is their weakne&s;s, and it calls for mourning, as well as it does that it &s;hould be &s;hrewdly given out, in vari|ous ways, that the great law of brotherly love is dangerous to the union and peace of churches.</P>
<P>When churches put up with evils, which require di&s;cipline, thinking thereby to get along, &s;ome how, as it is often expre&s;t, would do well to con&s;ider that there is no getting along, in Chri&s;t's kingdom, but by keeping his commandments; and that when the&s;e are neglected, churches ly &s;till, or rather go back, and are making work for repentance. Should the in&s;tance before us convince the reader of the truth of this remark, it will be found that he has read our affecting &s;tory not in vain.</P>
<P N="2">2. To revive and &s;upport the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of God's hou&s;e, is an object of the fir&s;t importance to command the attention and the zeal of chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Every one ought to "mark well, and behold with his own eyes, and hear with his ears all that
<PB N="39" REF="017823_0037_0FA319AFC4400728">

Adopting any other &s;y&s;tem, and acting upon any other max|ims, however plau&s;ible, and however celebrated they may be, will utterly fail in reducing men to the or|der of the hou&s;e.

<P>AS you have a joint intere&s;t with me in the &s;ceene now de&s;cribed, I beg leave to addre&s;s you, in particular, on the &s;ubject, at my parting with you.</P>
<P>My heart being filled with the tendere&s;t &s;ympathy, I do &s;incerely condole with you, in your pre&s;ent af|fliction. By matters being brought to this cri&s;is. I am &s;en&s;ible that your views and expectations are cut off equally as my own. And notwith&s;tanding peo|ple are wont to feel little concern in affairs foreign to them, yet I am per&s;uaded that the hi&s;tory of your troubles, as it is a hi&s;tory of human nature, will not fail to excite in per&s;ons of &s;en&s;ibility the livelie&s;t pity and compa&s;&s;ion for you; e&s;pecially if they them&s;elves have experienced the like misfortune. But that which is mo&s;t needful for you is to make a wi&s;e improvement of the di&s;pen&s;ation which &s;o

<P N="1">1. Adore that holy hand which hath effected tho&s;e events by which we are obliged to part.</P>
<P>This is the believer's challenge; "Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?" And not only revelation, but even nature it&s;elf teacheth the &s;ame doctrine. "A&s;k now the bea&s;ts, and they &s;hall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they &s;hall tell thee: or &s;peak to the earth, and it &s;hall teach thee; and the fi&s;hes of the &s;ea &s;hall de|clare unto thee: who knoweth not in all the&s;e, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job xii. 7&mdash;9.</NOTE></P>
<P>While you con&s;ider that you have to do with God in the&s;e concerns, you will be happily guarded again&s;t fretting at &s;econd cau&s;es.

<P N="4">4. Be aware of a &s;eparateing &s;pirit.</P>
<P>From the many awful di&s;plays of this &s;pirit, made before your eyes, in the cour&s;e of a few years pa&s;t, as well before as &s;ince I came among&s;t you, there is more rea&s;on why you &s;hould fear it, than there is that you &s;hould fear "the pe&s;tilence that walketh in darkne&s;s, or the de&s;truction that wa&s;teth at noon|day."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xci. 6.</NOTE> This &s;pirit always feels independent of its neighbours; and is intent only upon its own inte|re&s;t and humour.

than it&s;elf; and it &s;eldom blu&s;hes to make its own goodne&s;s a &s;tandard for its brother. Hence it is not uncommon for this &s;pirit to affect great compa&s;|&s;ion for the blindne&s;s and the &s;mall experiences of its fellow-profe&s;&s;ors. In various ways it calls upon beholders to admire its &s;hining excellencies; and in as many ways it is wont to &s;how di&s;plea&s;ure if they withhold their applau&s;e. It "loves the up|permo&s;t &s;eats in the &s;ynagogues, and greetings in the market,"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 43.</NOTE> as though the&s;e of right belonged to it. It a&s;&s;umes, with airs, the dictator's chair; and is not unwilling to give laws to inferiors.

And then the di&s;cipline of &s;hyne&s;s, jealou&s;y, murmuring, un&s;ociablene&s;s, &s;urline&s;s, &s;our|ne&s;s, unkindne&s;s, unmercifulne&s;s, and complaining, is the ordinance of your reformation. As this &s;pi|rit never gathers with Chri&s;t, it always &s;catters abroad, contrary to the whole &s;train of the &s;criptures. And what is &s;urpri&s;ing is, that it delights in being alone, when it can exclude all others as not nece&s;&s;a|ry to its happine&s;s.</P>

of one mind." "Be perfectly joined together in the &s;ame mind and in the &s;ame judgment." "Let us &s;tand fa&s;t in one &s;pirit." "Behold how good and how plea&s;ant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity." "Now I be&s;eech you, brethren, mark them which cau&s;e divi&s;ions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them." I &s;ay, when I con&s;ider the&s;e things, and how great a &s;tre&s;s is laid upon this doctrine, which all believers receive in the love of it&mdash;I he&s;itate not to pronounce upon a &s;eparating &s;pirit, that it is an|tichri&s;tian &s;pirit, and ought to be avoided as the bane of churches.</P>
<P>You cannot, therefore, my friends, have too great an abhorrence of this &s;pirit, in whom&s;oever it may, at any time, appear. You ought to guard again&s;t it with diligence, and cru&s;h the fir&s;t ri&s;ings of it among&s;t you. If it be let alone very long, it will become head-&s;trong, and utterly unmanageable, like the wild Gadarene, whom no man could tame.</P>
<P>Introduced with this unholy and dangerous &s;pirit is a train of evils of the foule&s;t character. Its na|tural and con&s;tant attendants are, "debates, envy|ings, wraths, &s;trifes, backbitings, whi&s;perings, &s;wel|lings, tumults." And whenever you &s;hall &s;ee this troop of furies ari&s;e, &s;tand in awe and dread the con&s;equences. For if every kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf is brought to de&s;olation: and if no city or hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf &s;hall &s;tand: know you for certain, that when a &s;pirit of divi&s;ion &s;hall have dominion over you, then de&s;truction will be even at your door. "If ye bite and and devour one another, &s;aith the apo&s;tle, take heed that ye be not con&s;umed one of another."</P>
<P N="5">5. Seek after go&s;pel order and walk in it.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="017823_0045_0FA319B5C4701FA8">
The ble&s;&s;ings of order are &s;o numerous, &s;o great, and &s;o precious, that it is truly a&s;toni&s;hing that it does not more command the attention of believers. Its lines are drawn with &s;o much clearne&s;s and pre|ci&s;ion; and its di&s;tingui&s;hing marks are &s;o plain and ea&s;y to be &s;een; that it &s;eems to require invention to avoid it. To every humble and hone&s;t di&s;ciple, the way of duty is obvious enough: &s;o that "the way-faring men, though fools, &s;hall not err therein." Hence young children, and per&s;ons of very &s;canty capacities may ea&s;ily be convicted of perver&s;ene&s;s, and wilful blindne&s;s when they refu&s;e to walk in it. This is the covenant.</P>
<P>"Thine eyes &s;hall &s;ee thy teachers: and thine ears &s;hall hear a word behind thee, &s;aying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left." "The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way. All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto &s;uch as keep his covenant and his te&s;timonies." And as "God is not the author of confu&s;ion, but of peace, as in all churches of &s;aints:" &s;o his peculiar people are di&s;tingui&s;hed from others by their love and practice of peace and order.</P>
<P>Indeed this is an article of &s;uch e&s;timation in the &s;criptures, that "in this the children of God are ma|nife&s;t, and the children of the devil: who&s;oever doth not righteou&s;ne&s;s is not of God, neither he that lov|eth not his brother." Of your duty on this head, this is the &s;um: "Thou &s;hall not hate thy brother in thine heart; thou &s;halt in any wi&s;e rebuke thy neighbour, and not &s;uffer &s;in upon him." "If thy brother &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou ha&s;t gained thy brother. But if he will not

hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es every word may be e&s;tabli&s;hed. And if he &s;hall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican." "Withdraw your&s;elves from every brother that walketh di&s;orderly. If any man obey not our word by this epi&s;tle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be a|&s;hamed" "Mark them which cau&s;e divi&s;ions, con|trary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and a|void them." "I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner&mdash;with &s;uch an one, no not to eat.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">If any reader &s;hall imagine that we are prohibited eating with an excommunicant, at the Lord's table only&mdash;let him con&s;ider&mdash;that we are to have NO company with him&mdash;&s;urely then, not the HIGHEST and MOST HONORABLE kind of company.

The in&s;truments of the churl are evil: he devi&s;eth wicked devices, to de&s;troy the poor with lying words, even when the needy &s;peaketh right." And yet this &s;ame vile per&s;on, this churl, the enormity of who&s;e villainy and covetou&s;ne&s;s exceeds even the livelie&s;t de&s;cription, would fain be thought to be liberal, bountiful, manly, honorable.

<P>"But the liberal devi&s;eth liberal things."&mdash;This man can look on great and generous de&s;igns with noble plea&s;ure and a heart-felt &s;atisfaction; and in this, as well as in every other re&s;pect, he is &s;uperior to a man of a narrow mind, in that he can behold the &s;olicitor of a charity, without turning pale. It is not his character to treat the good of others with cold indifference; for he knows by experience that "it is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive." And as he enjoys the plea&s;ure of diffu&s;ing happine&s;s among&s;t men, &s;o he is "&s;atisfied from him&s;elf."

His "charity &s;eeketh not her own." The ama&s;&s;ing of wealth, and laying up riches, he knows not whether for a wi&s;e man or a fool, is not an object of &s;o much importance in his e&s;timation, as his being "eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame; a father to the poor, and a &s;earcher out of the cau&s;e that he knows not, his breaking the jaws of the wicked, and plucking the &s;poil out of his teeth." The cry of the poor, of the fatherle&s;s, and of him who hath none to keep him, more readily reacheth his feelings, than the moving eloquence of the able&s;t orator; and the widow's heart &s;inging for joy affords him a nobler entertainment, than even a band of the be&s;t performers. And &s;o odd is he in

prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thir&s;ty, and ye gave me drink: I was a &s;tranger, and ye took me in: naked, and ye cloathed me: I was &s;ick, and ye vi&s;ited me: I was in pri&s;on, and ye came unto me. Ina&s;much as ye have done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</P>
<P>Be not afraid, then, my friends, to be truly libe|ral, and truly great. So far are you from lo&s;ing your money by lending it unto the Lord, that you lo&s;e even all that you do not lend to him. In this di&s;po|&s;ing of your intere&s;t you lay up for your&s;elves trea|&s;ures in heaven, which you &s;hall enjoy hereafter. "He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again." "There is that &s;cattereth, and yet increateth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. The liberal &s;oul &s;hall be made fat; and he that watereth &s;hall be wa|tered al&s;o him&s;elf."</P>
<P N="7">7. Reprove and avoid a levelling di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>If you receive my advice under the la&s;t head, &s;ure|ly you will under this. Your religious character, and your highe&s;t intere&s;t depend upon it. As a le|velling di&s;po&s;ition is not only dangerous to &s;ociety, but is expre&s;sly forbidden in God's word, I be&s;eech you not to &s;peak lightly of it: for in this matter you have a mighty concern with your maker. The divine law, on this &s;ubject is&mdash;"In lowline&s;s of mind let each e&s;teem other better than them&s;elves." "Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor prefering one another." "Render to all their dues: fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour" "Therefore all things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them."</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="017823_0051_0FA319BA43D03628">
This law you need to have well written in your hearts, that you may di&s;play it in all your deport|ment towards others. Chri&s;tians in nothing appear more like the great Pattern of humility, of meekne&s;s and of philanthropy, than they do in a &s;trict confor|mity to this rule And I am free to &s;ay, that it is owing to nothing but pride and arrogancy that any are not in &s;ubjection to it.</P>
<P>As a levelling &s;pirit ever envies the &s;uperiority of its neighbours; &s;o it does not &s;cruple to adopt any mea&s;ures to clip the wings of tho&s;e who fly, or to depre&s;s tho&s;e who attempt to ri&s;e. This demon of envy can never endure its equal, much le&s;s its rival, in either intere&s;t or fame. And indeed, &s;uch is the nature of this di&s;po&s;ition, that it cannot re&s;t without degrading other characters below the level, that it may enjoy the plea&s;ure of thinking it&s;elf e&s;|teemed above them. Its language is&mdash;I am not in|ferior to any one&mdash;men were made to &s;erve me! Hence it confounds the di&s;tinctions which nature has made, and which time immemorial has &s;anctified, between members of &s;ociety, on the account either of their age or rank. Men of this &s;tamp "de&s;pi&s;e government, pre&s;umptuous are they, &s;elf willed, they are not afraid to &s;peak evil of DIGNITIES."</P>
<P>And this evil di&s;po&s;ition is as de&s;tructive to &s;ociety, as it is ungracious and degrading. For as it di&s;|robes public characters of that dignity and honour which God has confered upon them for the good of others; &s;o it renders u&s;ele&s;s their admini&s;trations, whether it be in church or &s;tate, exactly in propor|tion as they are brought down from that eminence in which their offices place them above others. Would you then, my friends, de&s;ire to have the ci|vil magi&s;trate "a terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to &s;uch as do well," hold him up in the light of
<PB N="54" REF="017823_0052_0FA319BB0497F6E0">
DIGNITY. And would you wi&s;h to have the mi|ni&s;ters of the go&s;pel "&s;ave them who hear them," hold them up in the light of DIGNITY. And &s;ince this daring, levelling &s;pirit of the times has pervaded all our land, and &s;hakes even the pillars of church and &s;tate, from both extremities of the con|tinent, and more than legions of veterans is threat|ening ruin to our liberties and to our religion&mdash;let me conjure you to awake, and to be upon your guard again&s;t this fiend, this offspring of pride, this enemy of all righteoune&s;s, this pe&s;t and plague of &s;ociety. Now is the time for you to rou&s;e, when the effects of a levelling &s;pirit have become &s;o alarming. Lift up then a &s;tandard again&s;t this enemy, and make the tyrant flee&mdash;make the tyrant die! Cru&s;h, with &s;pi|rit, the fir&s;t ri&s;ings of his power, before he gains &s;trength among&s;t you&mdash;You can more ea&s;ily con|quer him in the cradle, than in the field&mdash;"I &s;peak as to wi&s;e men; judge ye what I &s;ay."</P>
<P>Finally, as family-religion&mdash;family-government&mdash;the education of children&mdash;and the promoting of learning in this young and ri&s;ing &s;tate&mdash;are &s;ubjects of high importance to you, I would gladly di&s;cant upon each of them, were it not that it will &s;well this addre&s;s to too great a &s;ize. Neverthele&s;s, allow me to indulge in the plea&s;ure of the hope that my pain|ful in&s;tructions on the&s;e topics will be kept in la&s;ting remembrance, and will be carried forth in practice, by you.</P>
<P>And now, I mu&s;t take my leave of you&mdash;it may be that with &s;ome it will be for ever. I hope you will allow me to remind you, that the opportunities which we have had together, in the cour&s;e of my mi|ni&s;try here, will &s;en&s;ibly affect us hereafter. The great doctrines of grace which I have invariably preached to you are of the fir&s;t excellence and im|portance.
<PB N="55" REF="017823_0053_0FA319BBC42F0B80">
And accordingly as the&s;e doctrines have been receieved or rejected, &s;o will the happine&s;s or the mi&s;ery of the hearers be. Be advi&s;ed then to take heed to what you have heard and learned, and hold fa&s;t. Be careful to make the&s;e doctrines &s;hine in all your conver&s;ation, that you may &s;hine hereafter in the kingdom of your Father.</P>
<P>"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace &s;hall be with you. If there be therefore any con&s;olation in Chri&s;t if any comfort of love, if any fellow&s;hip of the &s;pirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the &s;ame love, being of one ac|cord, of one mind." My addre&s;s concludes with the ble&s;&s;ing of I&s;rael:</P>
<P>"The Lord ble&s;s thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to &s;hine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace."</P>
