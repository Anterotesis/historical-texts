<BIBL>PSALM LXXXII. VERSE I.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>GOD</HI> &s;tandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty: He judgeth among the <HI>GODS.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age of in&s;pired &s;cripture may well po&s;&s;e&s;s the minds of this numerous and re&s;pectable audience, with reverence and a &s;acred awe, before him, who is greatly to be feared in the a&s;&s;embly of his &s;aints; and who will be &s;antified in all them that come nigh him: It is particularly adapted to arre&s;t the mo&s;t &s;erious attention of our honoured Rulers; at who&s;e invitation we are a&s;&s;embled in the Hou&s;e of God on this au&s;picious anniver&s;ary, &mdash;to &s;upplicate the Divine Pre&s;ence with them, and his &s;miles and ble&s;&s;ing upon the &s;pecial bu&s;ine&s;s of the day; and their admini&s;tration of government the en&s;uing year; and to enquire of him from his word, agreeable to the laudable practice of our pious Progenitors, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the country, to the pre&s;ent period.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="021713_0006_0FB54BDD670D15E8">OUR text has a primary reference to the Rulers of God's ancient covenant people. But as this pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture is of no private interpretation, it will as &s;itly apply to our civil fathers now before God, as to the <HI>Jewi&s;h Sanhedrim</HI> of old.</P>
<P>THE words before us, will naturally lead us&mdash;'To make &s;ome brief and general ob&s;ervations on government.'&mdash;The propriety and u&s;efulne&s;s of an <HI>a&s;&s;embly,</HI> for conducting the important affairs of it.&mdash;The &s;ublime characters rulers &s;u&s;tain.&mdash;The Supreme Ruler pre&s;ent with them, as an ob&s;erver, and judge; ready for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport, when acting up to their character; and carefully noticing whenever they lo&s;e &s;ight of the great end of their appointment: And the powerful influence, the con&s;ideration of his pre|&s;ence and in&s;pection mu&s;t have, to engage them in a con&s;cientious di&s;charge of the duties of their exalted &s;tations. May I be indulged your &s;erious and candid attention, while I attempt to dilate a little, upon the&s;e &s;everal particulars; all obviou&s;ly contained in, or ea&s;ily deducible from our text. <HI>GOD &s;tandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty: He judgeth among the Gods.</HI></P>
<P>THAT our text applies to the &s;upreme govern|ment of a community, and involves the various
<PB N="7" REF="021713_0007_0FB54BE1E140E8B0">departments of it, is readily &s;een by looking into the P&s;alm before us; where we find this congre|gation of the mighty, reproved for the improper u&s;e of their power, and a different mode of conduct enjoined upon them. "How long will ye judge unju&s;tly, and accept the per&s;ons of the wicked? Defend the poor and fatherle&s;s: Do ju&s;tice to the afflicted and needy: Deliver the poor and needy, rid them out of the hand of the wicked."</P>
<P>CIVIL government is both a dictate of nature, and revelation; and is accordingly indifferently denominated, <HI>the ordinance of God, and the ordinance of man.</HI> Man was originally formed for &s;ociety, and furni&s;hed with faculties adapted thereto: Faculties for the improvement of which &s;ocial intercour&s;e is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. Some of the mo&s;t important duties, and refined delights of human life are of the &s;ocial kind.</P>
<P>IN order to obtain the benefits of &s;ociety, civil rule is e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite. Tho&s;e lu&s;ts of men, from whence come wars and fightings, are &s;o prevalent in this apo&s;tate world, that they are obliged to form compacts and combinations, for mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport. And there is perhaps no people no earth, however uncultivated and barbarous, but who have adopted &s;ome kind of civil polity.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="021713_0008_0FB54BE386446690">THE light and law of nature, which uniformly urges to this mode of procedure, may well be ac|cepted, as an expre&s;&s;ion of the divine will: For God addre&s;&s;es the human mind in divers man|ners; and he does it by the voice of rea&s;on, as well as revelation.</P>
<P>THE providence of God is particularly concern|ed, in elevating man to po&s;t of honour and digni|ty; and giving them a &s;eat among the congrega|tion of the mighty. "For promotion cometh nei|ther from the ea&s;t, nor from the we&s;t, nor from the &s;outh: But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and fitteth up another." "By me (&s;ays wi&s;|dom, or that glorious Being who is the wi&s;dom of God) by me kings reign, and princes decree ju&s;|tice. By me princes rule and nobles, even all the judges of the earth." And in the New-Te&s;tament, we have the &s;ame idea held up, in terms equally ex|pre&s;s. "Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers; for there is no power, but of God. The powers that be, are ordained of God. Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God." Again, "&s;ubmit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's &s;ake; whether it be to the King, as &s;upreme, or unto Governours,
<PB N="9" REF="021713_0009_0FB54BE51EE76C38">
as unto them that are &s;ent by him, for the puni&s;h|ment of evil doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well. For &s;o is the will of God."</P>
<P>THESE declarations apply to civil government in general, which is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to &s;o|cial felicity and &s;afety. But they are by no means to be extended to every mode of government that has obtained among mankind: Not certainly to a de&s;potic and lawle&s;s domination. This is not the ordinance of God. Nor indeed any other go|vernment, but &s;uch as protects the &s;ubjects in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ju&s;t rights, proper|ties and priviledges.</P>
<P>THE particular form of government and mode of admini&s;tration, that &s;hall obtain among the va|rious nations of the world, heaven has not &s;een fit to pre&s;cribe. This &s;eems to be referred to the wi&s;dom of each community to determine for them&s;elves. And a great variety has in this re|&s;pect, actually taken place; in con&s;equence of the different genius, &s;entiments and &s;ituation, of dif|ferent people, in different ages and climes.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome con&s;titutions, the &s;upreme authority hath been ve&s;ted in one man. In others, a few
<PB N="10" REF="021713_0010_0FB54BEBCAE640B0">
are &s;elected for the purpo&s;e. Others &s;till have &s;ub|mitted it to many. The particular mode of go|vernment that has obtained the preference with the people of this land, directs our attention to the latter of the&s;e three. And &s;o does our text. <HI>The congregation of the mighty.</HI></P>
<P>THERE &s;eems an evident propriety in commit|ting the management of the intere&s;ting and impor|tant affairs of government, to a number &s;elected from the whole.</P>
<P>POWER is of an intoxicating quality; and for a &s;ingle individual to be ve&s;ted with &s;overeign rule, is &s;ubjecting him to a temptation too &s;trong for hu|man virtue. A de&s;ire of pre-eminence is a natural pa&s;&s;ion, and when properly re&s;trained, may prove highly beneficial to &s;ociety. But when it has a full free cour&s;e, and attains the &s;ummit of its wi&s;h, and feels it&s;elf without controul; the &s;ubject of this undue elevation, is apt to be puffed up with pride, to become intolerably &s;upercilious and ty|rannical; and to trample upon tho&s;e rights of the community, and individuals, which it is the prime de&s;ign of government to protect.</P>
<P>WHEREVER the will of a de&s;pot is the &s;upreme law, the great end of government is u&s;ually per|verted.
<PB N="11" REF="021713_0011_0FB54BF0D687FD78">
This is &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted by facts: And it is no other than what might ju&s;tly be expected from the nature of man.</P>
<P>THERE are, it is true, advantages ari&s;ing from ve&s;t|ing the admini&s;tration in the hands of one man, or a few; when they are well furni&s;hed with wi&s;|dom and fidelity; advantages from the deci&s;ion and di&s;patch, with which affairs of State may be tran&s;acted; and which in particular emergen|cies, may be peculiarly beneficial. But they are &s;o counterbalanced by the ills that re&s;ult from ar|bitrary rule, on the one hand, and the &s;afety that ari&s;es from good advice on the other, that there &s;eems a manife&s;t propriety that a number &s;hould be &s;elected for the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>"WHERE no council is (&s;ays the wi&s;e Solo|mon) the people fall: But in the multitude of councellors there is &s;afety." So limited is the human mind in all its perceptions and operations, and &s;o diffu&s;e, difficult, and many times perplexed are human affairs, e&s;pecially the important ones of government, that they elude the comprehen&s;ion of an individual; and demand the combined wi&s;|dom of a number, to conduct them with propriety. In free and judicious debates, there is frequently
<PB N="12" REF="021713_0012_0FB54BF22AEE8250">
much light reflected upon intricate &s;ubjects. What e&s;capes the ob&s;ervation, or recollection of one, may occur to another; and the minds of all be ripened for a re&s;ult, by means of the light mutual|ly reflected in their con&s;ultations. Affairs of State, thus carefully canva&s;&s;ed, may doubtle&s;s be con|ducted with greater propriety, by an a&s;&s;embly of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t men in a community, than by a &s;ingle individual, however improved and judi|cious he might be.</P>
<P>SUCH further is the immen&s;e weight of govern|ment, that it is too heavy for the &s;houlders of an individual: A congregation of the mighty, will find the burden equal to their united &s;trength. Thoughtle&s;s and incon&s;iderate people, may fondly conceive, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of a Ruler is as ea&s;y as the character is honourable. But tho&s;e who know the circle of their duty, and the various difficul|ties that attend it, are fully &s;en&s;ible, that it is an office, laborious, exten&s;ive, and greatly exerci&s;ing to all the powers of the body and mind.</P>
<P>WHATEVER refers to the public &s;afety and happine&s;s, demands their attention. The good and whole&s;ome laws, that are in being, are faith|fully
<PB N="13" REF="021713_0013_0FB54BF323B8ED90">
to be executed; and proper per&s;ons &s;ought out to carry them into effect. Laws unexecuted, however good in them&s;elves, and beneficial in their tendency, an&s;wer no valuable purpo&s;e; and may really prove injurious, by lowering the general influence of authority. If men may violate one law without any animadver&s;ion; why not another? There is nothing in&s;pires the public mind with &s;o general a veneration of government, as an undoubted expectation, that every penalty incurred, &s;hall be inflicted. New laws are from time to time to be framed, accommodated to the temper, genius and circum&s;tances of a people, and the exigencies of &s;tate: And to be &s;o framed that it may not be ea&s;y to elude their meaning, or evade their force. Ju&s;tice, <HI>di&s;tributive, penal,</HI> and <HI>commutative,</HI> mu&s;t have a free uninterrupted cour&s;e in a community: This &s;eems to be the very corner &s;tone of its happy exi&s;tence. U&s;eful literature is to be encouraged, that youth may be trained up in knowledge and virtue, and fitted to &s;erve God, and their generation, accord|ing to his will. Religion pure and undefiled, before God and the Father, &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the favour and ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, is particularly to be patronized. They mu&s;t guard with a vigilant eye, again&s;t the numerous
<PB N="14" REF="021713_0014_0FB54BF4A17A2120">
evils which threaten the body politic, whether from external violence, or internal convul&s;ions; and attend to whatever &s;erves to promote public pro&s;perity. The commerce, agriculture, and manufactures of a people &s;hould particularly be put under the mo&s;t judicious regulations; to encourage hone&s;t indu&s;try, and bani&s;h idlene&s;s: The former as beneficial, as the latter is baneful. The one, continually prompting to vice and &s;edition; the other engaging to a quiet and peaceable life.</P>
<P>GREAT and arduous is the labour requi&s;ite for &s;o exten&s;ive a &s;phere of action as this; &s;ome out|lines of which, we have but hinted at. And the difficulties of it are &s;ometimes greatly enhanced, by the peculiar embarra&s;&s;ments in which a people are involved. The <HI>cumbrance</HI> of a great community is hard to be borne; but their <HI>&s;trifes</HI> render the burden &s;till more grievous.</P>
<P>WHEN Jethro, that wi&s;e Prince, and prie&s;t of Midian, ob&s;erved Mo&s;es attending this duty from morning to evening, he makes this ju&s;t remark.&mdash;"The thing that thou doe&s;t is not good: Thou wilt &s;urely wear away: This thing is too heavy for thee: Thou art not able to perform it thy&s;elf alone." And the exce&s;&s;ive labour and fatigue, and
<PB N="15" REF="021713_0015_0FB54BFDDA4A3598">
various vexations of the &s;ervice, effectually con|vinced Mo&s;es of the propriety of his ob&s;ervation. Though he was eminently furni&s;hed with every qualification requi&s;ite for a good ruler, and &s;ucce&s;sful admini&s;tration;&mdash;&s;uch as learning, wi&s;dom, meekne&s;s, patience, and the mo&s;t perfect patrioti&s;m; yet worn down with painful &s;ervices, and ready to &s;ink under the burden, we find him pouring out his complaint to God, in the&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ive terms,&mdash;"Wherefore ha&s;t thou afflicted thy &s;ervant? And wherefore have I not found favour in thy &s;ight, that thou laye&s;t the burden of all this people upon me? Have I conceived all this people? Have I begotten them, that thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ay unto me, &mdash;carry them in thy bo&s;om as a nur&s;ing father carrieth the &s;ucking child.&mdash;I am not able to bear all this people alone, becau&s;e it is too heavy for me."</P>
<P>UPON this earne&s;t application to heaven, God was plea&s;ed to alter their form of government. Mo&s;es is directed to &s;elect out of all the people, &s;eventy men of their fir&s;t characters: Men known and noted as &s;uch, to be joined with him in the admini&s;tration. The&s;e compo&s;ed the great <HI>San|hedrim,</HI> and are <HI>that Congregation of the Mighty,</HI>&mdash;tho&s;e earthly GODS, to whom our text mo&s;t probably hath a primary reference.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="021713_0016_0FB54BFF241F48B0">IT is a divinely glorious character they &s;u&s;tain. <HI>The mighty,</HI> and according to the Hebrew dialect; <HI>Gods.</HI> The&s;e terms expre&s;s their dignity, and point out the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uitable qualifications for the di&s;charge of the duties of their &s;tation.</P>
<P>THE dignity of rulers, has by &s;ome been im|proved, as a &s;ubject of flattery; and their minds have been immoderately puffed up, by the high &s;trained compliments of fawning &s;ycophants; till they have conceived them&s;elves &s;omething above human. But they bear the image of God's au|thority, and are illu&s;trious by the rays of his ma|je&s;ty, for a very different purpo&s;e:&mdash;That they might imitate the ju&s;tice and beneficence of that glorious Being they repre&s;ent; And exerci&s;e the authority with which they are ve&s;ted in provi|dence, to the great and good ends, for which they are rai&s;ed above their brethren. When the public good engro&s;&s;es their attention, and engages their unwearied exertions: When they lay them|&s;elves out for the encouragement of whatever is virtuous, commendable and prai&s;e worthy, and for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of every thing of a contrary na|ture and tendency: When they improve all the powers of their minds, and all the advantages of their preferment to the&s;e ends:&mdash;Then do they
<PB N="17" REF="021713_0017_0FB54C00A1FFB470">
act up to their honourable character; they fill with dignity their exalted &s;tations, and may be &s;itly denominated <HI>Gods,</HI> and workers together with God.</P>
<P>To be equal to this important character and employ, it is nece&s;&s;ary that they be per&s;ons of good natural abilities, and acquired accomplish|ments. The former of our bodies and the father of our &s;pirits, has been plea&s;ed to exerci&s;e, both his "wi&s;dom and &s;overeignty in the different make of men. To &s;ome he giveth wi&s;dom and under|&s;tanding exceeding much; and largene&s;s of heart, even as the &s;and that is on the &s;ea &s;hore," where|by they are able to di&s;cern both time and judg|ment, and are ready for every emergency. The powers of others &s;eem formed upon a le&s;&s;er &s;cale, and evidently point them to a lower line of duty. Education &s;erves to keep up the natural diver&s;ity in the human compo&s;ition. The &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of &s;ome, in the cour&s;e of provi|dence, is peculiarly favourable for improvements in tho&s;e u&s;eful &s;ciences which enlarge and ennoble the mind, and qualify it for exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s: While others are nece&s;&s;arily de&s;titute of tho&s;e ad|vantages, and con&s;equent improvements. Provi|dence,
<PB N="18" REF="021713_0018_0FB54C05A2CED7C8">
as with a &s;un-beam, points out the former of the&s;e, as per&s;ons proper to be ve&s;ted with ru|ling powers, in preference to the latter. Their qualifications be&s;peak it; the public good de|mands it; and the word of God directs to it. "Provide out of all the people <HI>able men,</HI> &s;uch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetou&s;ne&s;s, and place &s;uch over them." <HI>Able men</HI>&mdash;men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wi&s;dom and knowledge; of &s;ence and &s;ub|&s;tance, of fortitude and firmne&s;s; neither enerva|ted by debauchery, or effeminated by di&s;&s;ipations, equal to the cares, fatigues and burden of govern|ment; and of "attending continually on this very thing." Their religious and moral qualifications are directly &s;ubjoined, and are equally de&s;ireable, in tho&s;e who rule over men. <HI>Such as fear God,</HI> are really religious, in principle and practice; <HI>Men of truth,</HI>&mdash;of inviolable integrity; who maintain a &s;acred regard to their engagements: <HI>Hating covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; not only free from that turbid &s;ource of corruption; but dete&s;ting the low prin|ciple that centers wholly in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>SUCH characters collected from a large com|munity, for the purpo&s;e of conducting its impor|tant public concerns, compo&s;e a truly re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly: <HI>A Congregation of the Mighty:</HI> God's
<PB N="19" REF="021713_0019_0FB54C0B19B7CD20">
vicegerents. They exhibit a &s;aint re&s;emblance and repre&s;entation of the &s;ource of all power; and are mini&s;ters of the providential government of the great Supreme.</P>
<P>OUR text repre&s;ents the great <HI>Jehovah</HI> as pre|&s;ent with them; and taking cognizance of their conduct. <HI>God &s;tandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty: He judgeth among the Gods.</HI></P>
<P>INFIDEL minds, and tho&s;e who by their conduct, have made it for their intere&s;t, either that there &s;hould be no God, or that he &s;hould be regardle&s;s of their behaviour; have &s;ometime flatly denied his &s;uperintending human affairs. At other times endeavoured to argue them&s;elves into &s;cepti&s;ci&s;m upon the &s;ubject. The ancients of I&s;rael, in the days of Ezekiel, had the confidence to a&s;&s;ert, that "The Lord had for&s;aken the earth." Others of a &s;till more ancient date are repre&s;ented as querying&mdash;"Is not God in the height of heaven? And behold the height of the &s;tars, how high they are&mdash;How doth God know? Can he judge through the dark cloud? Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he &s;eeth not, and he walketh in the circuit of heaven." Others &s;till have &s;aid in their hearts, &s;ecretly whi&s;pered to them&s;elves, when rebuked by their con&s;ciences for their
<PB N="20" REF="021713_0020_0FB54C0E170C9AB0">
criminal conduct; not daring to utter aloud the impious thought: "God hath forgotten, he hideth his face; he will never &s;ee it."</P>
<P>OUR inward feelings revolt at &s;uch bla&s;phemous &s;ugge&s;tions, and a&s;&s;ertions. And the word of God throughout, reprobates the &s;hocking imagination; and repre&s;ents it, as the fruitful &s;ource of all the over-flowings of impiety and immorality, which prevail, in the mo&s;t degenerate places and periods of time.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t high God, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven and Earth, is uniformly revealed in his word, as an immen&s;e, an infinite Being; omnipre&s;ent and omni&s;cient.

<P>HE is pre&s;ent in the Congregation of the Mighty as an attentive ob&s;erver:&mdash;A powerful a&s;&s;i&s;t|ant: A righteous Judge.</P>

<P>CIVIL Rulers are honoured as mini&s;ters and in|&s;truments of his providential government; and they are favoured with his providential pre&s;ence, that the ordinance of Heaven in this re&s;pect, might not be rendered void; but that they may accom|pli&s;h that which the Supreme Ruler plea&s;es; and pro&s;per in the &s;tation which he has a&s;&s;igned them.</P>
<P>WHEN God has &s;uch a favour for his people, as to afford their Rulers his gracious pre&s;ence; his right hand and the light of his countenance will do great things for them, and cau&s;e all things to go well with them.</P>

<P><PB N="25" REF="021713_0025_0FB54C1D2D27AD58">SUCH &s;ea&s;ons of danger and di&s;tre&s;s are not ideal. They have been realized under every form of go|vernment; though more frequently perhaps un|der tho&s;e of the mo&s;t liberal complexion. It is not the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of civil rule; or the mo&s;t faith|ful and judicious admini&s;tration, that is a certain &s;ecurity from &s;uch evils.</P>
<P>UNDER the <HI>Jewi&s;h theocracy,</HI> where God him|&s;elf conde&s;cended to be their King; enacted their laws, civil as well as &s;acred; re&s;ided among them, exhibiting continually, a vi&s;ible appearance of his pre&s;ence; conducting the affairs both of Church and State, by the mini&s;try of Mo&s;es;&mdash;of who&s;e appointment to office by Heaven, his qualifica|tions for it, and fidelity in it, they had the mo&s;t undeniable proofs. Yet under all the&s;e advantages for a quiet admini&s;tration, and obligations to a due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; Korah and company, had the addre&s;s to effect a mo&s;t dangerous in&s;urrection. They fir&s;t attach to their intere&s;t, a number of leading characters; then rai&s;e their <HI>po&s;&s;e,</HI> and pre|pare their charge.</P>
<P>BUT what charge could hold, again&s;t &s;o emi|nent a Ruler as Mo&s;es? Whom has he defrauded, or oppre&s;&s;ed? Not a &s;ingle individual. He de|clares
<PB N="26" REF="021713_0026_0FB54C1EC1A1D8C0">
before the heart-&s;earching God, he had not. "Re&s;pect them not (&s;ays he, in his &s;olemn addre&s;s to the Diety) I have not taken one a&s;s from them, neither have I hurt one of them."</P>
<P>WHAT is the terrible grievance, or pretended grievance, that enables the&s;e &s;ons of &s;edition, to rai&s;e the whole Congregation again&s;t Mo&s;es and Aaron? It is pride and imperiou&s;ne&s;s. Strange that this of all things, &s;hould be the charge, when we are a&s;&s;ured, from &s;acred record, that "the man Mo&s;es, was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth." But what of that? The charge takes, and that an&s;wers the purpo&s;e. "Ye take too much upon you, (they complain) &s;eeing all the Congregation are holy, every one of them: Wherefore then lift ye up your&s;elves above the Congregation of the Lord?</P>
<P>THIS daring rebellion was &s;everely rebuked by the righteous Governour of the World. The au|thors of it, and leaders in it, were partly con|&s;umed by fire from the Lord: And for the re&s;t, the earth opened her mouth, and they went down quick into the pit.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch a malignant effect had this in&s;urrec|tion upon the minds of the people, that even this
<PB N="27" REF="021713_0027_0FB54C2397DCFE58">
awful interpo&s;ition of the great God of Heaven, was not &s;ufficient to quell it. The very next day there is a fre&s;h ri&s;ing, and a new charge exhibit|ed. Mo&s;es and Aaron are impeached with killing the people of the Lord.</P>
<P>GRACIOUS Heaven! Is it po&s;&s;ible, that when tho&s;e &s;inners again&s;t their own &s;ouls, were cut off by the hand of God, in the open view of thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;and witne&s;&s;es; and by his creating a new thing too; cau&s;ing "the earth to open and &s;wallow them up, with all that appertained to them," that the whole Congregation &s;hould directly charge Mo&s;es and Aaron, with the murder of tho&s;e pious good people?</P>
<P>THIS was too much for infinite patience to en|dure. "Get ye up from this congregation (&s;ays the Lord to Mo&s;es, pro&s;trate before him as an humble &s;ervent interce&s;&s;or for them) that I may con&s;ume them in a moment." And though Mo&s;es and Aaron &s;tood in the gap, and at length turned away the anger of God: Yet it was not till fourteen thou&s;and &s;even hundred, were made monuments of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure; be&s;ides them that died about the matter of Korah.</P>
<P>THESE things happened to I&s;rael of old for en|&s;amples; and they are written for our admonition
<PB N="28" REF="021713_0028_0FB54C2A2124CD60">
on whom the ends of the world are come, and they admit of a profitable improvement. We do not indeed in the pre&s;ent age expect miracu|lous interpo&s;itions; yet when God is graciou&s;ly pre&s;ent with his &s;ervants, he does &s;ometimes by a &s;urprizing coincidence of events, work out their &s;alvation: So that "whoever is wi&s;e and ob|&s;erves them, may under&s;tand the loving kind|ne&s;s of the Lord." To proceed with our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE great Governor of the world, is not only pre&s;ent with tho&s;e in authority, as an ob&s;erver of all the good they do for his people; and to afford every a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport, as circum&s;tances re|quire:&mdash;But as a righteous judge, who critically ob&s;erves the deportment of the whole, and of each individual, and takes cognizance whenever they lo&s;e &s;ight of the great end of their appoint|ment. <HI>He judgeth among the Gods.</HI></P>
<P>THAT all-piercing eye which pervades the uni|ver&s;e, and penetrates every di&s;gui&s;e, &s;ees who con&s;titute the Congregation of the Mighty. He perfectly knows the various views they have; and the different improvement they make of their talents and opportunities. They are rai&s;ed above their brethren; not that they may &s;hine in affluence, and fare &s;umptuou&s;ly every day;
<PB N="29" REF="021713_0029_0FB54C2B60411098">
much le&s;s, that they may indulge to inglorious ea&s;e and &s;loth; and lea&s;t of all, that they &s;hould pervert judgment, and ju&s;tice; but that having a more extended circle of duty, they may be more exten&s;ively u&s;eful. If however there are any who neglect the bu&s;ine&s;s of their &s;tation, who permit their talents to lie by them u&s;ele&s;s, as though folded up in a napkin, if content with the honors or profits of preferment, they leave the duties to be performed by others: He who &s;tands in the mid&s;t of their a&s;&s;embly ob&s;erves it. If through their delinquency, "judgment is turned away backward, and ju&s;tice &s;tandeth afar off: If truth falleth in the &s;treet, and equity cannot enter," the Lord &s;ees it. "If they forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and tho&s;e that are ready to peri&s;h; if they &s;ay, behold we knew it not: Doth not He that pondereth the heart con|&s;ider it? and He that keepeth their &s;oul, doth He not know it? and &s;hall He not render to every man according to his works?"</P>
<P>WHATEVER pleas any may &s;ub&s;titute for the neglect of their duty, every omi&s;&s;ion is noticed by the righteous Judge; and noted down in the book of his remembrance. The abu&s;e of their tru&s;t, expo&s;es them to the ju&s;t re&s;entments
<PB N="30" REF="021713_0030_0FB54C2CE7B2C7E0">
of tho&s;e, who have con&s;ided their intere&s;ts to their care; and to the pre&s;ent rebukes of that God who judgeth in the earth. But whether they fall under the effects of the&s;e now, or not&mdash;a &s;e|vere reckoning and an awful doom awaits them at the great day: "Ca&s;t ye the <HI>unprofitable</HI> &s;er|vant into outer darkne&s;s, there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth."</P>
<P>AND if mere indolence and inattention to duty, be thus re&s;ented by the Supreme Ruler; tho&s;e who are chargeable with direct and po&s;itive breaches of their tru&s;t, will not e&s;cape his ob&s;erva|tion. If they judge unju&s;tly, and accept the per|&s;ons of the wicked: If mi&s;chief be framed by a law, in effect and con&s;tructively, however covertly done, and men are turned a&s;ide from their right&mdash;He who is higher than the highe&s;t regardeth &s;uch violent perver&s;ion of judgment and ju&s;tice. When this is the ca&s;e, "all the foundations of the earth or land, are out of cour&s;e," as it is expre&s;&s;ed in our context: For when ju&s;tice is preverted, what good can be expected? "The omni&s;cient God &s;ees, and &s;hall he not avenge &s;uch inju&s;tice as this? Hear that declaration of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, which will apply to the point, and de&s;erves the &s;erious attention of tho&s;e who abu&s;e their tru&s;t;

"But if that evil &s;ervant &s;hall &s;ay in his heart, my Lord delayeth his coming; and &s;hall begin to finite his fellow-&s;ervants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; the Lord of that &s;ervant &s;hall come, in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and &s;hall cut him a&s;under, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites."</P>
<P>AND now will not the con&s;ideration of the divine pre&s;ence in the a&s;&s;embly of political rulers, mo&s;t powerfully engage them to a con&s;cientious di&s;charge of the duties of their exalted &s;tation? If their minds are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a lively &s;en&s;e of his immediate in&s;pection; they will, they mu&s;t attend to the important affairs that come before them, with great &s;olemnity of &s;pirit.&mdash;Every matter that is &s;ugge&s;ted, or &s;ubmitted to their con&s;ideration, will be impartially examined; and nothing &s;uffered to pa&s;s merely upon the account of its plau&s;ible appearance. In every debate the enquiry will be, not what mea&s;ure will mo&s;t contribute to my popularity; to &s;ecure my pre&s;ent &s;tation; or advance me to an higher? Nor, what will be mo&s;t for my per&s;onal intere&s;t, or the advantage of tho&s;e with whom I am particularly connected? But what is fit, and right in it&s;elf; and in the view of my mo&s;t calm and retired

thoughts, dive&s;ted as much as po&s;&s;ible of pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice? What will &s;tand the awful trial of the Supreme Governour, and meet his final approbation?</P>
<P>A LIVELY &s;en&s;e of an ever pre&s;ent God, habitu|ally impre&s;&s;ed upon the mind, will happily in|fluence the general temper and conduct; and it will prove peculiarly beneficial in pre&s;&s;ing public emergencies: It will rai&s;e above that fear of man which bringeth a &s;nare; and le&s;&s;en, if not utterly de&s;troy the force of temptation, from whatever quarter it originates. It will make them &s;tedfa&s;t, immovable, abounding in the work of the Lord. It will expand the human heart, and in&s;pire with a laudable ambition, to &s;ecure his &s;acred &s;anction. In &s;hort it will form a principle of action, which viewed in its proper connexion and extent, is one of the noble&s;t and be&s;t that can po&s;&s;e&s;s the Ruler's brea&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE are it is true, other principles that have their u&s;e, and are often improved by Providence to produce good effects: Such as a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition:&mdash;A quick &s;en&s;e of honor:&mdash;ambition of being di&s;tingui&s;hed as of con&s;equence in the State; and the like. But the influence of all the&s;e lower principles, is very uncertain, e&s;pecially in times of great trial and temptation. If pre&s;ent
<PB N="33" REF="021713_0033_0FB54C3934C477F8">
intere&s;t, and pre&s;ent duty interfere, as they &s;ome times may; what is there but a &s;erious reference to the invi&s;ible God, that will enable the ruler to hold fa&s;t his integrity? This indeed will engage him to go through honor and di&s;honor, good report, and evil report; re&s;olutely to &s;urmount, or charge through every difficulty and oppo&s;ition that he meets with in the line of duty. The te&s;timony of his own con&s;cience affords him a con&s;tant &s;upport, a continual fea&s;t. "The work of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be peace; and the effect of righteou&s;ne&s;s, quietne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance forever."</P>
<P>FAITHFUL Rulers, acting uniformly under the influence of this mo&s;t excellent principle, have the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ecuring the acceptance and ap|probation of their fellow-citizens; and thereby of protracting the period, and enlarging the &s;phere of their u&s;efulne&s;s. But whatever returns are made them, by an ungrateful world or per|ver&s;e generation; God is not unrighteous to for|get their work and labour of love. That peace of his which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s their hearts, and prove their &s;upport under every pre&s;ent pre&s;&s;ure. And in the neare&s;t views of di&s;&s;olution, the te&s;timony of their con&s;ciences, that they have walked before God, with a perfect

heart, and have done that which was right in his &s;ight, will in&s;pire a hope &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t. And great &s;hall be their reward in Heaven.</P>
<P>WILL not the &s;ubject, thus con&s;idered, natu|rally lead us to reflect, with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ations, and &s;incere&s;t gratitude to Heaven, upon our own happy con&s;titution of civil govern|ment. Emancipated from Briti&s;h domination, freed from that exorbitant claim to a right to bind us in all ca&s;es whatever; which like a hor|rid vortex threatned to &s;wallow up all that was dear and &s;acred in our view; and to reduce us to a &s;tate of ab&s;olute &s;ervility: Freed from the&s;e evils, we have had the &s;ingular privilege of form|ing and e&s;tabli&s;hing a frame of government for our&s;elves: And, to render it the more perfect, of availing our&s;elves of the examples and maxims of the &s;acred writings, as well as the wi&s;dom of all preceding ages. The thought that it is <HI>our own</HI> is a plea&s;ing recommendation. The trea&s;ure and the blood we have been obliged to expend in order to its acqui&s;ition, mu&s;t enhance its value. But e&s;pecially the broad ba&s;is it lays for equal liberty, civil and religious; the &s;ecurity it gives to all our rights as men, and chri&s;tians; the favourable a&s;|pect it has upon our peace and pro&s;perity in this
<PB N="35" REF="021713_0035_0FB54C40613E21C0">
life; and the advantages it affords of &s;ecuring a good foundation again&s;t the time to come; all con&s;pire to rai&s;e our e&s;teem even to veneration. Strangers are not permitted to rule over us. "Our nobles are of our&s;elves: And our Governour proceeds from the mid&s;t of us." Our be&s;t cha|racters, it is our privilege and our duty to &s;elect, out of all the people, and from every part of the Commonwealth, to conduct our intere&s;ting af|fairs: And, not by will or caprice, but fixed fundamental rules, which they are under the oath of God to maintain &s;acred and inviolable. And if experience &s;hould convince us that amend|ments or alterations, are eligible, or nece&s;&s;ary; a con&s;titutional mode is pointed out, in which they may be effected, without expo&s;ing us to tho&s;e inte&s;tine jarrs and convul&s;ions, which u&s;ually attend alterations, and e&s;pecially revolutions in other States. Happy, thrice happy people, have we but wi&s;dom to know, and virtue to improve, &s;o excellent a &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>WHAT thanks &s;hould we render to God mo&s;t high, to God who performeth all things for us, for the favourable di&s;po&s;itions of his providence, which opened the way for, and has enabled us to &s;ecure &s;o excellent a con&s;titution! Our pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation is by no means the re&s;ult of chance. The
<PB N="36" REF="021713_0036_0FB54C4219C7D2B0">
revolution that introduced it was replete with brilliant events; &s;uch as engaged the attention and admiration of di&s;tant nations; and will &s;hine with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre in the faithful page of hi&s;tory. The hand of Heaven has been con&s;pi|cuous, in rai&s;ing up eminent characters for council and war, in uniting &s;o exten&s;ive a territory in a common cau&s;e; in giving us favour in the eyes of foreign powers, and influencing them to afford us e&s;&s;ential aid; and e&s;pecially in a variety of mar|vellous interpo&s;itions of his providence, in periods of greate&s;t perplexity, darkne&s;s and danger. How did the Supreme Ruler ride forth upon the Hea|vens for our help; and in his Excellency upon the &s;kies! How often did he make bare his arm on our behalf, and exert the &s;aving &s;trength of his own right hand, till we obtained the completion of our wi&s;hes; peace with e&s;tabli&s;hed independence; upon terms too, as honorable to America, as they were humiliating to Britain.</P>
<P>To hint at the&s;e intere&s;ting events, will not be deemed improper at this time, as it &s;erves to touch the &s;ecret &s;prings of gratitude, and draw forth our whole &s;ouls in love to him, to whom we are &s;o infinitely indebted.

<P>THEY will keep a vigilant eye upon tho&s;e re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits, who either from an aver&s;ion to the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traints of government, di&s;|content at their own &s;ituation, or embarra&s;s|ments in their per&s;onal intere&s;t, through their own folly, extravagance or un&s;ucce&s;sful &s;pe|culations, are continually plotting mi&s;chief, excit|ing the fears and jealou&s;ies of hone&s;t people, in&s;inuating that their liberties and privileges, are invaded, or in danger, &amp;c. Such men are the pe&s;ts of &s;ociety: They &s;hould be narrowly ob&s;erv|ed, and whenever their factious di&s;po&s;ition di&s;co|vers it&s;elf by overt acts, &s;ea&s;onably and &s;everely animadverted upon; that others may avoid their crimes as they would their fate. Inattention to evils of this kind in their ri&s;e is dangerous, and may prove fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="021713_0039_0FB54C4D1F01F530">To contribute to public happine&s;s our civil Fa|thers will give every encouragement to indu&s;try, &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to bring forward to our aid, the numerous re&s;ources with which our coun|try is ble&s;&s;ed. By good laws and proper encour|agements, they will endeavour to improve our agriculture, fi&s;heries, commerce, arts and manu|factures. The&s;e exten&s;ive fields will furni&s;h out full, and profitable employ for all parts of the community. And indu&s;try in the improvement of the&s;e advantages, attended with proper econo|my, would enable us to emerge from our embar|ra&s;&s;ments, di&s;charge our debts, feel our indepen|dence, and appear to advantage upon the great Theatre of the world.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer the great end of their appointment, our Rulers will patronize learning and the libe|ral arts. They will encourage our Schools and Academics, and e&s;pecially our Univer&s;ity, &s;o illu&s;trious for the renowned characters it has al|ready produced: And to which the Common|wealth will &s;till direct her eye for "&s;trong rods for the &s;ceptre of them that bare rule;" to her own &s;ons nurtured in that feat of learning, will &s;he look for prophets, and to her young men for Nazarites, to take her by the hand, and lead her in the way &s;he ought to go.</P>

THEY will moreover endeavour the impartial di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice and judgment. "The God of I&s;rael &s;aid, the rock of I&s;rael &s;poke: He that ruleth over men, mu&s;t be ju&s;t." Would they approve them&s;elves to the Supreme Ruler or an|&s;wer the prime de&s;ign of government; they mu&s;t con&s;cientiou&s;ly attend to this cardinal virtue. All their acts and laws mu&s;t be founded upon this &s;ure ba&s;is. And all their promi&s;es and en|gagements, held &s;acred and inviolable.</P>
<P>THEIR promi&s;es, their plighted faith for the payment of the public debt, does in a particu|lar manner &s;olicit their mo&s;t &s;erious attention. The creditors of the public, attached to the inter|e&s;t of their country, in the mo&s;t critical juncture, chearfully &s;teped forward, and expo&s;ed both their per&s;ons, and their fortunes, to the mo&s;t threatning dangers, on her behalf. While &s;ome jeoparded their lives in the high places of the field, and endured all the fatigues of a &s;evere and long con|tinued war; through various perils, many times in cold and nakedne&s;s, hunger and thir&s;t, yea "in deaths oft." Others ri&s;qued their intere&s;t at the earne&s;t call of their country, in the &s;upport of the common cau&s;e, relying upon the public faith. Have they forfeited their right to their intere&s;ts,

And tho&s;e among our|&s;elves, who have been uniformly inimical to the American cau&s;e, may be plea&s;ed with the cruel mortification to which they &s;ee them &s;ubjected. But is there an individual friendly to the revolu|tion, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t moderate &s;hare of judgment and integrity, who does not view them as highly meritorious?</P>
<P>THE decided part they took in favour of their much injured country, and in periods too of its utmo&s;t perplexity and danger, is greatly to their honor. They a&s;&s;erted her rights and &s;upported her cau&s;e, not by a mere profu&s;ion and flouri&s;h of words; but by actions, which admitted of no duplicity of &s;en&s;e or meaning. They ri&s;qued their dear-earned intere&s;t, and their &s;till dearer lives for the freedom of their country. Heaven di|rected and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the noble exertions, and crown|ed the arduous attempt with glorious &s;ucce&s;s. Had they not a right to expect, that government would honor them&s;elves, by paying a &s;acred re|gard to their engagements? Did not found po|licy, ju&s;tice, honor, gratitude and every inge|nous principle which actuates the human mind,

Can &s;pecious promi&s;es, under the names of certificates, indents, facilities, due-bills, &amp;c. couched in the faire&s;t terms, while covering the gro&s;&s;e&s;t deception, be con&s;idered as a honorable di&s;charge of the public engagements? Is this cla&s;&s; of citizens, to look and expect till their eyes and hearts fail them with waiting? Have not many already been as effectually ruined by their depen|dence upon the public faith, as if their &s;ub&s;tance had been con&s;umed by the flames?

Some appear aver&s;e to this interpo&s;ition, becau&s;e it mu&s;t now come too late with re&s;pect to many. But if through the delinquency or delay of the public, many of her faithful and tried friends, who have rendered her the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, are ruined; is this a good rea&s;on why they &s;hould make thorough work, and di&s;patch the whole body of them?</P>
<P>"To turn away a man from his right, or &s;ub|vert him in his cau&s;e, the Lord approveth not," in any ca&s;e whatever. But are there not in the ca&s;e before us &s;ome circum&s;tances, which give a peculiar colouring to the inju&s;tice done, to a part at lea&s;t, of the public creditors, by with-holding their due?</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="021713_0043_0FB54C591FCE49C8">WHEN David while in the &s;trong hold, ex|claimed,&mdash;"O that one would give me water to drink out of the well of Bethlehem; and three of the thirty chief, break through the ho&s;t of the Phili&s;tines, and drew it, and brought it to him; he would not drink of it. My God forbid it me, that I &s;hould do this thing (&s;ays he.) Shall I drink the blood of the&s;e men, that have put their lives in jeopardy? For with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it." In this view of the ca&s;e, and as far as it will fairly apply to our army, &mdash;is there an individual, who would with-hold from them their due; and deprive them of that bread they have acquired a righteous claim to, at the peril of their lives? Again.</P>
<P>THE aged and helple&s;s, and particularly widows and orphans, may be viewed as another cla&s;s of public creditors. The&s;e, incapable of vindicating their rights, have a &s;pecial claim to the patronage and protection of authority. Inju&s;tice offered to the&s;e, and e&s;pecially to the latter, is ever con&s;i|dered as greatly aggravated. And &s;ome of the mo&s;t pointed threatnings in the whole book of God, are directly levelled again&s;t this &s;in. Says the Supreme Ruler of the univer&s;e, &mdash;Ye &s;hall not afflict any widow, or fatherle&s;s child. If thou afflict them in any wi&s;e, and they cry at all unto me;
<PB N="44" REF="021713_0044_0FB54C626309ECC8">
I will &s;urely hear their cry, and my wrath &s;hall wax hot, and I will kill you with the &s;word, and your wives &s;hall be widows, and your children fatherle&s;s."</P>
<P>THERE is other property, of which the com|munity have availed them&s;elves in the late conte&s;t, the with-holding of which, and e&s;pecially the per|ver&s;ion of it, from its original de&s;ign, is perhaps carrying inju&s;tice to its highe&s;t pitch. I mean that which has been devoted to God: Con&s;ecrated to charitable u&s;es: The pious donations to our Univer&s;ity: The funds for the benefit of Churches, and other &s;ocieties: The provi&s;ion made in one place and another, for the relief of the aged and nece&s;&s;itous, the widow and orphan. What is an inva&s;ion of this kind of property, but down-right <HI>&s;acrilege</HI>? A crime that &s;carce admits of excu&s;e or extenuation. "If one man &s;in again&s;t another, the Judges &s;hall judge him: But if a man &s;in again&s;t the Lord, who &s;hall plead for him?"</P>
<P>SHALL the&s;e claims upon the public be &s;till &s;u&s;pended to give &s;cope for &s;peculation? Shall they be vacated, or in any degree mutilated, be|cau&s;e the di&s;charge of them is not to be effected, without laying a burden upon the community? And this when we are a&s;&s;ured, they are entirely
<PB N="45" REF="021713_0045_0FB54C63BB5F66E0">
competent to the annual di&s;charge of the intere&s;t, and lowering the principal, with a tax no heavier in proportion to the pre&s;ent number, than was commonly paid before the war? Would &s;uch pleas avail between man and man? Would they with good men and true, in a Court of Ju&s;tice? Should an individual endeavour to get rid of his debts by &s;uch means, would it not con&s;ign his character to perpetual infamy? Can any plead for it then in a community; e&s;pecially when the example it exhibits is &s;o dete&s;table in it&s;elf, and &s;o de&s;tructive in its tendency, and abominable in the eyes of a righteous God, who declares, "I hate robbery for burnt &s;acrifice."</P>
<P>PERMIT me only to add here, Our honoured Ru|lers among all their other exertions for the good of the Commonwealth, will pay a particular attention to the intere&s;t of Religion. Is it their governing aim to approve them&s;elves to God? They mu&s;t per&s;onally think of, and practi&s;e, the graces and virtues of the Chri&s;tian character, without which it is not po&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God. If they have the intere&s;t of religion at heart, they will give it their determined &s;upport: Not by in&s;tituting articles of faith, or forms of wor&s;hip, or in any manner infringing the rights of con&s;cience; but by pro|moting

none to places of power and tru&s;t, but per|&s;ons of good moral characters; by countenancing and encouraging the mini&s;ters of religion; by a faithful execution of the laws for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of profanene&s;s, immorality and impiety; and e&s;|pecially by an exemplary attendance upon public wor&s;hip, and go&s;pel in&s;titutions. Examples, and particularly of tho&s;e in higher life, have a prevail|ing victorious force; and by them good Rulers may eminently &s;ub&s;erve the intere&s;ts of piety and virtue.</P>
<P>"GODLINESS is profitable to all things; having promi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come." It in&s;ures the favour and ble&s;&s;ing of heaven. It contributes to public happiness, by engaging all orders of men to an upright di&s;charge of their &s;everal duties. Rulers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of religi|ous principles, will approve them&s;elves "Mini&s;ters of God for good," to their people. And &s;ubjects under &s;imilar influences, will yield due obedience; not merely for wrath, or through fear of puni&s;h|ment; but from a far nobler principle,&mdash;"for con&s;cience &s;ake." Religion in this view is &s;o far from being a vain thing, <HI>that it is our life.</HI></P>

It amply repays the toils of the indu&s;tri|ous hu&s;bandman; yielding a rich &s;upply of the nece&s;&s;aries, and mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial articles of life; and a good &s;urplu&s;age for the purpo&s;es of com|merce.
