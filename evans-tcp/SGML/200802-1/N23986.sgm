<HEAD>THE VISION OF MIRZA.</HEAD>
<P>ON the fifth day of the moon, which, ac|cording to the cu&s;tom of my forefathers, I al|ways keep holy, after having wa&s;hed my&s;elf, and offered up my morning devotions, I a&s;cended the high hills of Bagdat, in order to pa&s;s the re&s;t of the the day in meditation and prayer. As I was here airing my&s;elf on the tops of the mountains, I fell into a profound comtemplation on the vani|ty of human life; and pa&s;&s;ing from one thought to another, "Surely," &s;aid I, "man is but a &s;hadow, and life a dream." Whil&s;t I was thus mu&s;ing, I ca&s;t my eyes towards the &s;ummit of a rock that was not far from me, where I di&s;cover|ed one in the habit of a &s;hepherd, with a little mu&s;ical in&s;trument in his hand. As I looked
<PB N="4" REF="031735_0003_0FEE2881E0A1DDD8">
upon him he applied it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The &s;ound of it was exceeding &s;weet, and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpre&s;&s;ibly melodious, and altogether dif|ferent from any thing I had ever heard, they put me in mind of tho&s;e heavenly airs that are play|ed to the departed &s;ouls of good men upon their fir&s;t arrival in Paradi&s;e; to wear out the impre&s;|&s;ions of the la&s;t agonies, and qualify them for the plea&s;ures of that happy place. My heart melted away in &s;ecret raptures.</P>
<P>I had been often told that the rock before me was the haunt of a genius; and that &s;everal had been entertained with the mu&s;ic, who had pa&s;&s;ed by it, but never heard that the mu&s;ician had be|fore made him&s;elf vi&s;ible. When he had rai&s;ed my thoughts by tho&s;e tran&s;porting airs which he played, to ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of his conver&s;ation, as I looked upon him like one a&s;toni&s;hed, he bec|koned to me, and by the waving of his hand di|rected me to approach the place where he &s;at. I drew near with that reverence which is due to a &s;uperior nature; and as my heart was entirely &s;ubdued by the captivating &s;trains I had heard, I fell down at his feet and wept. The genius &s;miled upon me with a look of compa&s;&s;ion and affability, that familiarized him to my imagina|tion, and at once di&s;pelled all the fears and ap|prehen&s;ions with which I approached him. He
<PB N="5" REF="031735_0004_0FEE288366F08D38">
lifted me from the ground, and taking me by the hand, "Mirza," &s;aid he, "I have heard thee in thy &s;oliloquies; follow me."</P>
<P>He then led me to the highe&s;t pinnacle of the rock, and placing me on the top of it, "Ca&s;t thine eyes ea&s;tward," &s;aid he, "and tell me what thou &s;ee&s;t." "I &s;ee," &s;aid I, "a huge valley, and a prodigious tide of water rolling through it." "The valley that thou &s;ee&s;t," &s;aid he. "is the vale of mi&s;ery, and the tide of water that thou &s;ee&s;t, is part of the great tide of eternity." "What is the rea&s;on," &s;aid I, "that the tide I &s;ee ri&s;es out of a thick mi&s;t at the one end, and again lo&s;es it&s;elf in a thick mi&s;t at the other?" "What thou &s;ee&s;t," &s;aid he, "is that portion of eternity which is called time, mea&s;ured out by the &s;un, and reaching from the beginning of the world to its con&s;ummation. Examine now," &s;aid he, "this &s;ea that is bounded with darkne&s;s at both ends, and tell me what thou di&s;covere&s;t in it." "I &s;ee a bridge," &s;aid I, "&s;tanding in the mid&s;t of the tide." "The bridge thou &s;ee&s;t," &s;aid he, "is human life; con&s;ider it at|tentively." Upon a more lei&s;ure &s;urvey of it, I found that it con&s;i&s;ted of three &s;core and ten en|tire arches, with &s;everal broken arches, which, added to tho&s;e that were entire, made up the number about an hundred. As I was counting the arches, the genius told me that this bridge
<PB N="6" REF="031735_0005_0FEE2884EE5E9718">
con&s;i&s;ted at fir&s;t of a thou&s;and arches; but that a great flood &s;wept away the re&s;t, and left the bridge in the ruinous condition I now beheld it: "But tell me further," &s;aid he, "what thou di&s;covere&s;t on it." "I &s;ee multitudes of peo|ple pa&s;&s;ing over it," &s;aid I, "and a black cloud hanging on each end of it." As I looked more attentively, I &s;aw &s;everal of the pa&s;&s;engers drop|ping through the bridge, into the great tide that flowed underneath it; and upon further exami|nation, perceived there were innumerable trap|doors that lay concealed in the bridge, which the pa&s;&s;engers no &s;ooner trod upon, but they fell through them into the tide, and immediately di&s;|appeared. The&s;e hidden pit-falls were &s;et very thick at the entrance of the bridge, &s;o that throngs of people no &s;ooner broke through the cloud, but many of them fell into them. They grew thinner towards the middle, but multiplied and lay clo&s;er together towards the end of the arches that were entire.</P>
<P>There were indeed &s;ome per&s;ons, but their number was very &s;mall, that continued a kind of hobbling march on the broken arches, but fell through one after another, being quite tired and &s;pent with &s;o long a walk.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in the contemplation of this wonderful &s;tructure, and the great variety of ob|jects which it pre&s;ented. My heart was filled
<PB N="7" REF="031735_0006_0FEE288B6E0F2B10">
with a deep melancholy to &s;ee &s;everal dropping unexpectedly in the mid&s;t of mirth and jollity, and catching at every thing that &s;tood by them to &s;ave them&s;elves. Some were looking up to|wards the heavens in a thoughtful po&s;ture, and in the mid&s;t of a &s;peculation &s;tumbled and fell out of &s;ight. Multitudes were very bu&s;y in the pur&s;uit of bubbles that glittered in their eyes and danced before them; but often when they thought them&s;elves within the reach of them, their footing failed, and down they &s;unk. In this confu&s;ion of objects, I ob&s;erved &s;ome with &s;cimitars in their hands, and others with urinals, who ran to and fro from the bridge, thru&s;ting &s;everal per&s;ons on trap-doors which did not &s;eem to lie in their way, and which they might have e&s;caped had they not been thus forced upon them.</P>
<P>The genius &s;eeing me indulge my&s;elf in this melancholy pro&s;pect, told me I had dwelt long enough upon it: "Take thine eyes off the bridge," &s;aid he, "and tell me if thou &s;ee&s;t any thing thou do&s;t not comprehend." Upon look|ing up, "What mean," &s;aid I, "tho&s;e great &s;ight of birds that are perpetually hovering about the bridge, and &s;ettling upon it from time to time? I &s;ee vultures, harpies, ravens, cormorants, and among many other feathered creatures &s;everal lit|tle winged boys, that perch in great numbers
<PB N="8" REF="031735_0007_0FEE2891D9D8C688">
upon the middle arches." "The&s;e," &s;aid the genius, "are envy, avarice, &s;uper&s;tition, de&s;pair, love, with the like cares and pa&s;&s;ions that infe&s;t human life."</P>
<P>I here fetched a deep &s;igh; "Alas," &s;aid I, "man was &s;urely made in vain! how is he given away to mi&s;ery and mortality! tortured in life, and &s;wallowed up in death!" The genius being moved with compa&s;&s;ion towards me, bid me quit &s;o uncomfortable a pro&s;pect. "Look no more," &s;aid he, "on man in the fir&s;t &s;tage of his exi&s;|tence, in his &s;etting out for eternity; but ca&s;t thine eye on that thick mi&s;t into which the tide bears the &s;everal generations of mortals that fall into it." I directed my &s;ight as I was ordered, and (whether or no the good genius &s;trengthened it with any &s;upernatural force, or di&s;&s;ipated part of the mi&s;t that was before too thick for the eye to penetrate) I &s;aw the valley opening at the far|ther end, and &s;preading forth into an immen&s;e ocean, that had a huge rock of adamant running through the mid&s;t of it, and dividing it into two equal parts. The clouds &s;till re&s;ted on one half of it, in&s;omuch that I could di&s;cover nothing in it; but the other appeared to me a va&s;t ocean planted with innumerable i&s;lands, that were cov|ered with fruits and flowers, and interwoven with a thou&s;and little &s;hining &s;eas that run among them. I could &s;ee per&s;ons dre&s;&s;ed in glorious habits
<PB N="9" REF="031735_0008_0FEE28936144D498">
with garlands upon their heads, pa&s;&s;ing among the trees, laying down by the &s;ides of fountains, or re&s;ting on beds of flowers; and could hear a confu&s;ed harmony of &s;inging birds, falling wa|ters, human voices, and mu&s;ical in&s;truments. Gladne&s;s grew in me upon the di&s;covery of &s;o delightful a &s;cene. I wi&s;hed for the wings of an eagle, that I might fly away to tho&s;e happy &s;eats; but the genius told me there was no pa&s;&s;age to them, except through the gates of death that I &s;aw opening every moment upon the bridge. "The i&s;lands," &s;ays he, "that lie &s;o fre&s;h and green before thee, and with which the whole face of the ocean appears &s;potted as far as thou can&s;t &s;ee, are more in number than the &s;and on the &s;ea &s;hore; there are myriads of i&s;lands be|hind tho&s;e which thou here di&s;covere&s;t, reaching further than thine eyes, or even thine imagination can extend it&s;elf. The&s;e are the man&s;ions of good men after death, who, according to the degree and kinds of virtue in which they ex|celled, are di&s;tributed among the&s;e &s;everal i&s;lands, which abound with plea&s;ures of different kinds and degrees, &s;uitable to the reli&s;hes and perfec|tions of tho&s;e who are &s;ettled in them; every i&s;land is a paradi&s;e accommodated to its re&s;pec|tive inhabitants. Are not the&s;e, O Mirza, habitations worth contending for? Does life ap|pear mi&s;erable, that gives thee opportunities of
<PB N="10" REF="031735_0009_0FEE2894E8FDA700">
earning &s;uch a reward? is death to be feared, that will convey thee to &s;o happy an exi&s;tence? think not man was made in vain, who has &s;uch an eternity re&s;erved for him." I gazed with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure on the&s;e happy i&s;lands. At length, &s;aid I, "&s;hew me now I be&s;eech thee, the &s;ecrets that lie hid under tho&s;e dark clouds, which cover the ocean on the other &s;ide of the rock of adamant. The genius making me no an&s;wer, I turned about to addre&s;s my&s;elf to him a &s;econd time, but I found that he had left me; I then turned again to the vi&s;ion which I had been &s;o long contemplating; but in&s;tead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge, and the happy i&s;lands, I &s;aw nothing but the long hollow valley of Bagdat, with oxen, &s;heep and camels upon the &s;ides of it.</P>

<HEAD>BENEVOLENCE URGED FROM THE MYSERY OF SOL|ITUDE. AN EASTERN STORY.</HEAD>
<P>CARASAN, the merchant of Bagdat, was eminent throughout all the Ea&s;t for his avarice and his wealth: His origin was ob&s;cure, as that of the &s;park which by the colli&s;ion of &s;teel and adamant is &s;truck out of darkne&s;s; and the
<PB N="11" REF="031735_0010_0FEE289B0703DE30">
patient labour of pre&s;erving diligence alone had made him rich. It was remembered, that when he was indigent he was thought to be generous; and he was &s;till acknowledged to be inexorably ju&s;t. But whether, in his dealings with men, he di&s;covered a perfidy which tempted him to put his tru&s;t in gold, or whether in proportion as he accumulated wealth, he di&s;covered his own im|portance to increa&s;e; Carazan prized it more as he u&s;ed it le&s;s: he gradually lo&s;t the inclination to do good, as he acquired the power; and as the hand of time &s;cattered &s;now upon his head, the freezing influence extended to his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>But though the door of Carazan was ne|ver opened by ho&s;pitality, nor his hand by com|pa&s;&s;ion, yet fear led him con&s;tantly to the mo&s;que at the &s;tated hours of prayer; he performed all the rites of devotion with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous punctuality, and had thrice paid his vows at the temple of the prophet. That devotion which ari&s;es from the love of God, and nece&s;&s;arily in|cludes the love of man, as it connects gratitude with beneficence, and exalts that which was mor|al to divine, confers new dignity upon goodne&s;s, and is the object not only of affection but rever|ence. On the contrary, the devotion of the &s;elf|i&s;h, whether it be thought to avert the puni&s;h|ment which every one wi&s;hes to be inflicted, or to in&s;ure it by the complication of hypocri&s;y with
<PB N="12" REF="031735_0011_0FEE28A0975B2810">
guilt, never fails to excite indignation and abhor|rence. Carazan, therefore, when he had locked his door, turning round with a look of circum|&s;pective &s;u&s;picion, proceeded to the mo&s;que, and was followed by every eye with &s;ilent malignity; the poor &s;u&s;pended their &s;upplication when he pa&s;&s;ed by; and though he was known by every man, yet no man &s;aluted him.</P>
<P>Such had long been the life of Carazan, and &s;uch was the character which he had acquired, when notice was given by proclamation, that he was removed to a magnificent building in the cen|ter of the city, that his table &s;hould be &s;pread for the public, and that the &s;tranger &s;hould be wel|come to his bed. The multitude &s;oon ru&s;hed like a torrent to his door, where they beheld him di&s;tributing bread to the hungry, and apparel to the naked, and his eye &s;oftened with compa&s;|&s;ion, and his cheek glowing with delight. Every one gazed with a&s;toni&s;hment at the prodigy; and the murmur of innumerable voices increa&s;|ing like the &s;ound of approaching thunder. Ca|razan beckoned with his hand; attention &s;u&s;|pended the tumult in a moment, and he thus gra|tified the curio&s;ity which had procured him audi|ence.</P>
<P>To Him who touches the mountains and they &s;moke; the Almighty, and the mo&s;t Merciful, be everla&s;ting honour! he has ordained &s;leep to be
<PB N="13" REF="031735_0012_0FEE28A21F6E0D10">
the mini&s;ter of in&s;truction, and his vi&s;ions have reproved me in the night. As I was &s;itting alone in my haram, with my lamp burning before me, computing the product of my merchandi&s;e and exulting in the increa&s;e of my wealth, I fell into a deep &s;leep, and the hand of him who dwells in the third heaven was upon me. I be|held the angel of death coming forward like a whirlwind, and he &s;mote me before I could dep|recate the blow. At the &s;ame moment I felt my&s;elf lifted from the ground, and tran&s;ported with a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity through the regions of the air. The earth was contracted to an atom beneath; and the &s;tars glowed round me with a lu&s;tre that ob&s;cured the &s;un. The gate of para|di&s;e was now in &s;ight; and I was intercepted by a &s;udden brightne&s;s which no human eye could behold; the irrevocable &s;entence was now to be pronounced; my days of probation was pa&s;t; and from the evil of my life nothing could be taken away, nor could any thing be added to the good. When I reflected that my lot for eternity was ca&s;t, which not all the powers of nature could rever&s;e, my confidence totally for&s;ook me; and while I &s;tood trembling and &s;ilent, covered with confu&s;ion and chilled with horror, I was thus addre&s;&s;ed by the radiance that flamed be|fore me.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="031735_0013_0FEE28A3A7B2F6C0">
<Q>Carazan, thy wor&s;hip has not been accept|ed, becau&s;e it was not prompted by the love of God; neither can thy righteou&s;ne&s;s be re|warded, becau&s;e it was not produced by love of man; for thy own &s;ake only, ha&s;t thou ren|dered to every man his due; and thou ha&s;t approached the Almighty only for thy&s;elf. Thou ha&s;t not looked up with gratitude, nor round thee with kindne&s;s. Around thee, thou ha&s;t, indeed, behold vice and folly; but if vice and folly could ju&s;tify thy par&s;imony, would they not condemn the bounty of hea|ven? If not upon the fooli&s;h and vicious, where &s;hall the &s;un diffu&s;e its light, or the clouds di&s;till their dew? where &s;hall the lips of the &s;pring breathe fragrance, or the hand of autumn diffu&s;e plenty? remember, Cara|zan, that thou ha&s;t &s;hut compa&s;&s;ion from thine heart, and gra&s;ped thy trea&s;ures with a hand of iron: thou ha&s;t lived for thy&s;elf; and therefore, henceforth for ever thou &s;halt &s;ub|&s;i&s;t alone. From the light of heaven, and from the &s;ociety of all beings, &s;halt thou be driven; &s;olitude &s;hall protract the lingering hours of eternity, and darkne&s;s aggravate the horrors of de&s;pair.</Q> At the moment I was driven by &s;ome &s;ecret and irre&s;i&s;table power through the glowing &s;y&s;tem of creation, and pa&s;&s;ed innumerable worlds in a moment. As I approached the verge of nature, I perceived
<PB N="15" REF="031735_0014_0FEE28AAAF87CD08">
the &s;hadows of total and boundle&s;s vacuity deep|en before me; a dreadful region of eternal &s;i|lence, &s;olitude and darkne&s;s! unutterable horror &s;eized me at the pro&s;pect, and this exclamation bur&s;t from me with all the vehemence of de&s;ire: <Q>O! that I had been doomed for ever to the common receptacle of impenitence and guilt! there &s;ociety would have alleviated the tor|ment of de&s;pair, and the rage of fire could not have excluded the comfort of light. Or if I had been condemned to re&s;ide on a comet, that would return but once in a thou&s;and years to the regions of light and life; the hope of the&s;e periods, however di&s;tant, would chear me in the dreary interval of cold and darkne&s;s, and the vici&s;&s;itude would divide eternity into time.</Q> While this thought pa&s;&s;ed over my mind, I lo&s;t &s;ight of the remote&s;t &s;tar, and the la&s;t glimmering of light was quench|ed in utter darkne&s;s. The agonies of de&s;pair every moment increa&s;ed, as every moment aug|mented my di&s;tance from the la&s;t habitable world. I reflected with intolerable angui&s;h, that when ten thou&s;and thou&s;and years had car|ried me beyond the reach of all but that power who fills infinitude, I &s;hould &s;till look forward into an immen&s;e aby&s;s of darkne&s;s, through which I &s;hould &s;till drive without &s;uccour and without &s;ociety, farther and farther &s;till, for
<PB N="16" REF="031735_0015_0FEE28B1CE77D3B0">
ever and ever. I then &s;tretched out my hands towards the regions of exi&s;tence, with an emo|tion that awakened me. Thus have I been taught to e&s;timate &s;ociety, like every other ble&s;|&s;ing, by its lo&s;s. My heart is warmed to liberali|ty; and I am zealous to communicate the hap|pine&s;s which I feel, to tho&s;e from whom it is de|rived; for the &s;ociety of one wretch, whom in the pride of pro&s;perity I would have &s;purned from my door, would, in the dreadful &s;olitude to which I was condemned, have been more highly prized, than the gold of Afric, or the gems of Golconda.</P>
<P>At this reflection upon his dream, Carazan became &s;uddenly &s;ilent, and looked upward in an extacy of gratitude and devotion. The multi|tude were &s;truck at once with the precept and example; and the Caliph, to whom the event was related, that he might be liberal beyond the power of gold, commanded it to be recorded for the benefit of po&s;terity.</P>

<HEAD>COVETOUSNESS ITS OWN PUNISHMENT. A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>IN the city of Mexico, as we are told, by that famous and much to be depended on hi&s;torian Father Giardino, there lived a cer|tain gentleman, called Don Cavanilla Quignata Lorenzano, who had once followed the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of a &s;crivener, but had now betaken him&s;elf to that honorable and u&s;eful employ|ment, the a&s;&s;i&s;ting of his fellow-creatures with a portion of his own wealth at cent. per cent. intere&s;t, vulgarly denominated u&s;ury. This wor&s;hip|ful per&s;on in the fiftieth and fourth year of his age, entered into a contract of matrimony with the virtuous Donna E&s;tifania Montenella, in the eight and thirtieth year of hers. To this tran&s;action he was the rather induced, not more on account of the beauty of her per&s;on and the qualities of her mind, than becau&s;e &s;he was very rich, and as careful of her money as he was of his. Already had Lorenzano pa&s;&s;ed ten good years with his dame in the honorable &s;tate of holy matrimony, without how|ever enjoying the comforts of a family of chil|dren; for the want of which ble&s;&s;ing he com|forted him&s;elf in public, by expre&s;&s;ing his thank|fulne&s;s to Providence for being thus freed of a
<PB N="18" REF="031735_0017_0FED38126C333750">
multitude of cares, and in private by the thoughts of the great expence he was thus &s;aved; for as the prudent Lorenzano hardly allowed him&s;elf the nece&s;&s;aries of life, wi&s;ely con&s;idering that his riches, great as they were, might make to them|&s;elves wings and fly away, you may judge whether he would have reli&s;hed the expence attending the feeding, the cloathing, and educating a numerous family. He was wi&s;e from ob&s;ervation; for his father di&s;inherited his elder brother, becau&s;e he was a thoughtle&s;s, gay, extravagant youth, and left his fortune to Lorenzano, who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions were &s;imilar to his own. Of this he had many proofs; but one in particular determined him; for, when a favourite dog which was warmly at|tached to Lorenzano, having grown up with him from his infancy, had became too old to go abroad to find its food in the dung-hills or on the &s;treets, he had &s;hut it out of the hou&s;e, and allowed it to die for want.</P>
<P>When Lorenzano had not occa&s;ion to go to market for the purpo&s;e of victuals, an expedition which he took perhaps twice a month, he &s;eldom left the hou&s;e. When he appeared in the &s;treet, the children u&s;ed to run after him, and a mi&s;|chievous little rogue would often pick an onion out of his pocket through the holes of his old cloak as he was travelling homeward loaden with vegetables.</P>

His coat was &s;o ancient, and had been &s;o of|ten patched, that few people in Mexico remem|bered its original colour, the thrifty Donna E&s;|tifania had exerted her &s;kill on it with &s;uch &s;uc|ce&s;s, that it not only fortified her good man from the inclemency of the weather, but might have defended him from the effect of a bullet had it been aimed at him. Of &s;imilar or &s;uperior &s;trength were a pair of jack boots which he con&s;tantly wore; the&s;e by frequent accretions of contribu|tory leather to the legs, and of tinplate nailed to the &s;ouls, became &s;o &s;trong, that they might well have &s;erved as buckets to the mo&s;t frequented well in Mexico. But that he might not be quite born down with the weight of his apparel, he uniformly carried in his right hand a thick knob|bed &s;tick, which not only &s;erved him for &s;upport, but as a defence again&s;t the noi&s;y curs of the city which always barked at him as he went along. At his left &s;ide he likewi&s;e wore a &s;word, which re&s;embled as one egg does another, that of the renowned Sir Hudibras, as friend Butler de&s;cribes it. Notwith&s;tanding this mi&s;erable armour and &s;orry apparel, he never forgot to di&s;play the en|&s;igns of an order of knighthood conferred on him by a late Viceroy of his Catholic Maje&s;ty, for certain &s;ervices rendered to the revenues of the &s;tate of Mexico, or rather to the emoluments of the &s;aid Viceroy. Certainly the in&s;ignia of that
<PB N="20" REF="031735_0019_0FEE28BF35957010">
celebrated order had never hung on the brea&s;t of a more mi&s;erable &s;ubject; but it convinced the people of Mexico, that a dung hill cannot receive lu&s;tre even from a diamond.</P>
<P>It <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> fine morning in the Spring, that Lovenzano &s;et out for the fields in the neigh|bourhood of the city to gather &s;imples for a pec|toral draught, more &s;alutary than tea, to his con|&s;ort; and to regale him&s;elf with a fre&s;h &s;alad, made luxurious by the thought that he &s;hould pay nothing for it. As he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome magnifi|cent country &s;eats without the town, he ob&s;erved below a tree an Indian &s;ervant, whom &s;leep had overtaken, and be&s;ide whom lay a pair of delicate new boots, which attracted the eager gaze, and excited the covetous de&s;ires of our noble knight. He &s;poke and coughed aloud, and when he &s;aw that the &s;leeper did not awake, he con&s;idered this as a charming opportunity to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of a pair of new boots at no expence. He quick|ly di&s;incumbered him&s;elf of his own old &s;ervants, which he laid down be&s;ide the Indian, and hav|ing made free with the new ones, he &s;campered off with as much celerity as if he had been run|ning for a wager.</P>
<P>With what joy, when he got home, did he re|late in &s;ecret to his &s;pou&s;e his &s;ucce&s;sful trick, and with what rapture did he &s;urvey his well|dre&s;&s;ed feet!</P>

"God knows, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, it was a lucky hour when I fir&s;t thought of going out to gather &s;imples."</P>
<P>Next day he went to church, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with much devotion at a ma&s;s, and gave a few coun|terfeit maravedis in charity. But &s;carcely had he turned his back on the church, when he felt him&s;elf &s;uddenly &s;eized by the &s;houlder, and looking about, &s;aw an Indian &s;ervant in the li|very of the Viceroy, crying aloud, "this is the thief, this is the thief"</P>
<P>"What do you mean, ra&s;cal?" &s;aid Lorenza|no, &s;omewhat confidently.</P>
<P>"Sennor Caballero, replied the Indian, you have &s;tolen the&s;e boots, which belong to the Viceroy. They are a pre&s;ent from the king of Quizzimoro, who to pa&s;s the tedious hours, and to drive away melancholy, diverts him&s;elf with the making of boots. I will prove it, for the king &s;tamps under the in&s;tep of all his boots his own mark, which is a golden &s;un,"</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant by chance there was pa&s;&s;ing an Alguazil, and Lorenzano was immediately car|ried before the judge; the boots were di&s;covered to be his Maje&s;ty of Quizzimoro's own make, and to be the identical boots that were &s;ent by him to the Viceroy The by&s;tanders, well ac|quainted with the covetous di&s;po&s;ition of Loren|zano,
<PB N="22" REF="031735_0021_0FEE28C4862F11A0">
rejoiced to hear him condemned to pay a fine of a thou&s;and doubloons, with co&s;ts of &s;uit. The Alguazil called a hackney coach, made Lo|renzano enter it, mounted after him, and driving to his hou&s;e received from the trembling hands of the petrified knight the whole money, gave him a di&s;charge for it, and leaving his own old jack-boots, laughed in his face and bid him good morrow.</P>
<P>Ah! merciful God! cried Donna E&s;tifania, tearing, like another Medu&s;a, a handful of hair out of her head, what an infamous rogue have I for a hu&s;band! a thou&s;and doubloons! I am ru|ined and undone!</P>
<P>"God knows, &s;aid Lorenzano, with loud la|mentation, it was an unlucky hour when I fir&s;t thought of going out to gather &s;imples."</P>
<P>With a look, furious as Othello's, he ca&s;t his eyes on the jack-boots which the Alguazil had left in the middle of the room, and &s;pringing up, he threw them both out of the window into the lake.</P>
<P>It happened that about this time two fi&s;her|men, his neighbours, who had &s;pread their net in the morning, were now preparing to draw it, and finding an unu&s;ual weight in it, "Neigh|bour, &s;aid one of them, God has been good to us this morning, the net is &s;o heavy that it is impo&s;&s;ible it can be with fi&s;h; who knows but we

have found a trea&s;ure? &s;ome box of money or jewels, or &s;omething as valuable, is certainly in the net.&mdash;Accordingly they &s;et to with all their might to haul the net on &s;hore; but what was their grief when, in&s;tead of the trea&s;ure they had flattered them&s;elves with finding, they &s;aw only the mon&s;trous jack-boots which had torn more than an hundred holes in their only net. Full of indignation at their misfortune, and chag|rined at their di&s;appointed hopes, they took up the boots and threw them in at the window of the di&s;con&s;olate knight, as he &s;at ruminating on his late di&s;a&s;ter. Unluckily one of them hap|pened to &s;trike upon a cabinet containing a mag|nificent &s;ervice of porcelaine, given to Lorenzano, in pawn for a large &s;um of money, which it brought to the ground with a hideous cra&s;h, and the whole contents were &s;hivered to atoms.</P>
<P>"O the&s;e cur&s;ed jack-boots, cried Donna E&s;tifania; would they and that old villain, who will bring me to a bit of bread, were both at the devil! God pity me, and forgive all my &s;ins."</P>
<P>"Alas! &s;obbed Lorenzano, mi&s;erable man that I am! how unlucky has been the hour that fir&s;t led me out to gather &s;imples."</P>
<P>"Out of the hou&s;e this in&s;tant, cried E&s;tifa|nia, with your vile boots, and let me never &s;ee an atom of them more"</P>
<P>Lorenzano took up the unfortunate boots, and
<PB N="24" REF="031735_0023_0FEE28CF118FB658">
at night went into his garden, where, by the light of a farthing candle which glimmered through an old broken lantern, he dug a hole, and com|mitted his ill-fated boots to the cold ground.</P>
<P>A neighbour of his, by trade a joiner, had once been employed in mending &s;ome old furni|ture for our honorable knight, but had been paid &s;o &s;curvily for his labour, that he &s;till bore the old man a grudge&mdash;This man happened to &s;ee Sennor Lorenzano &s;o late at work in his garden, &s;u&s;pected that &s;omething unlawful was going on, and therefore he called his neighbours about him.</P>
<P>In the mean time Lorenzano had gone to ano|ther &s;pot, where, without the knowledge of his lady wife, he had concealed a little ca&s;ket with &s;ome jewels, to &s;ee if they were &s;till &s;afe, and he found them &s;o. He &s;at him&s;elf down be&s;ide the ca&s;ket, which he opened, and with &s;uch &s;ecret joy contemplated his hidden trea&s;ure, that he al|mo&s;t forgot his late misfortunes.</P>
<P>The following day the joiner waited on a ma|gi&s;trate, and related to him what he and his neighbours had &s;een. It was immediately &s;u&s;|pected that Lorenzano, had found a trea&s;ure; and as by the law of the country every valuable thing found under the earth belongs to his Ca|tholic Maje&s;ty, a deputation was forthwith di&s;|patched, headed by the joiner and a notary, to the garden of Lorenzano, who &s;oon dug up the ca&s;ket with the jewels.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="031735_0024_0FEE28D3102BD0F8">
"You know, I pre&s;ume, Sennor, &s;aid the no|tary, that all trea&s;ures in the bowels of the earth belong of right to our liege lord his Catholic Maje&s;ty; and that when they are found they mu&s;t be delivered up to the council of &s;tate."</P>
<P>"I know it well, &s;aid Lorenzano, trembling; but this ca&s;ket is my own private property."</P>
<P>"Your own private property!"</P>
<P>"Yes, upon my hone&s;t word it is."</P>
<P>Why would you bury it, then, &s;aid the nota|ry, if it were your own private property? no, no, that is but a pretence. The&s;e jewels mu&s;t have been depo&s;ited in the earth by &s;ome of the inhabitants at the time of the &s;iege of the town by Cortez, and our valient ance&s;tors; it could not be you who buried them."</P>
<P>"By the ble&s;&s;ed virgin, &s;aid Lorenzano, they were wore by my own mother."</P>
<P>Do not call the ble&s;&s;ed virgin, &s;aid the notary, to palliate your crime, or to witne&s;s your impo|&s;ition; &s;he is better employed than to vouch for your fal&s;hoods. I hereby &s;eize and confi&s;cate the&s;e jewels in the name of his Catholic Ma|je&s;ty and of the council of &s;tate."</P>
<P>"Ah! wretch that I am!" exclaimed Lo|renzano. "And to puni&s;h you, continued the notary, for having attempted to embezzle this trea&s;ure, by concealing it, I hereby further de|cree, that you immediately pay a fine of one thou|&s;and
<PB N="26" REF="031735_0025_0FEE28D9701E0228">
doubloons, together with the expences of this deputation."</P>
<P>It was in vain that Lorenzano prote&s;ted and &s;wore, and raved like one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; he was ob|liged to pay the money; and the ca&s;ket with the jewels was carried off by the deputation in pro|per form.</P>
<P>When Donna E&s;tifania was made acquainted with the&s;e proceedings &s;he fell into fits, &s;he &s;eized a knife with which &s;he was going to fini&s;h her own exi&s;tence; but reflecting better upon the bu&s;ine&s;s, her rage took another turn, and &s;he vented it on the unhappy Lorenzano with &s;uch effect, that he retained the marks of it in his fle&s;h for many a day.</P>
<P>The poor wretch went out full of angui&s;h into his garden, dug up his jack-boots, and threw them when it was night into the canal that ran through his &s;treet. It is well known that canals run through all the &s;treets of Mexico, which are furni&s;hed with grates in particular places.</P>
<P>In the morning, nobody in the neighbourhood could get out of their hou&s;e; for the mon|&s;trous jack-boots had planted them&s;elves again&s;t the grate of that &s;treet, like a pair of dragons be|fore an enchanted ca&s;tle; and &s;o prevented the water from pa&s;&s;ing, that the whole &s;treet was overflowed. The officers of the police immedi|ately went to vi&s;it the grate, and finding the jack-boots
<PB N="27" REF="031735_0026_0FEE28DAF73FC0C8">
of the unhappy Lorenzano choaking it up, they took them out and proceeded with them to his hou&s;e. Sore from the brui&s;es of ye&s;terday, Lorenzano could hardly move from his bed; but upon hearing an alarm without he crawled to the window, and &s;eeing the inundation, his fears gave him a true foreboding of what was to hap|pen.</P>
<P>The waters were no &s;ooner let off than a body of city officers approached his hou&s;e, bearing the jack-boots like trophies on a long pole before them.</P>
<P>"Ah! God pity me! cried Lorenzano, they are bringing back tho&s;e damn'd boots that I la&s;t night threw into the kennel."</P>
<P>"Into the kennel did you throw them? &s;aid E&s;tifania, with a voice not much calculated to &s;ooth his &s;orrows, or allay his apprehen&s;ions; O thou &s;tupid wretch! did&s;t thou not know how &s;trictly it is forbidden to throw any thing there. Certainly the boots have &s;topt up the grate and cau&s;ed the overflow of the water. We are un|done."</P>
<P>It is as I feared, "&s;ighed Lorenzano" The officers entered the hou&s;e, threw down the jack-boots, and led Lorenzano on before the judge.</P>
<P>Here he was accu&s;ed of contempt of the law, by throwing his jack-boots into the canal, and of preventing the whole inhabitants of the &s;treet
<PB N="28" REF="031735_0027_0FEE28DC8228B048">
from going about their lawful occupations, by the inundation he had occa&s;ioned. He was fined in a thou&s;and doubloons, and ordered to pay damages and expences.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had he paid the money than he ran to his kitchen, made a fire upon the hearth, and threw in his jack-boots. "If the water will not keep you, &s;aid he, I will make fire fini&s;h you." The boots which had lain all night in the water, were &s;o wet that they put out the fire when they were thrown into it. What, &s;aid he, do you de|fy even the flames? What witches and magi|cians cannot re&s;i&s;t, will you a pair of infernal jack-boots, think to e&s;cape? No, if you are &s;a|lamanders, or a&s;be&s;tos it&s;elf, you &s;hall burn, With the&s;e words, he brought all the dry wood he could find, and made &s;uch a fire, that at la&s;t the flames reached the roof, and &s;et fire to the hou&s;e. Immediately the cry of fire re&s;ounded through the city. E&s;tifania fainted; and had not Lorenzano thrown a whole pitcher of water about her ears, &s;he would probably have given up the gho&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the fire was got under without doing any con&s;iderable damage; but Lorenzano for his carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, and the alarm he had given to the city, was fined in another thou|&s;and doubloons, and to pay all expen&s;es. He was obliged to &s;ubmit and pay the money, and a

&s;igh and a tear dropt on every piece as he count|ed it.</P>
<P>"Since the unhappy day that I went to ga|ther &s;imples&mdash;</P>
<P>"Hold your tongue, cries E&s;tifania, vile wretch."</P>
<P>"For God's &s;ake, dear Fanna, replies the Knight, allow me to &s;peak, or el&s;e my heart will bur&s;t with vexation. Since that unhappy bo|tannical expedition, misfortunes have fallen thick upon me! tho&s;e infernal boots&mdash;4000 doubloons with co&s;ts, and a box of jewels! The boots of my whole family, &s;ince the expul|&s;ion of the Moors from Granada, never co&s;t half the &s;um."</P>
<P>"I am the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all mi&s;erable women, cried E&s;tifania! Little joy have I had in my married &s;tate; but I de&s;ire you once for all to take the&s;e hateful boots from my &s;ight. Would to God I had never &s;een either you or them, for they will bring me to beggary."</P>
<P>"I have thrown them, &s;ays Lorenzano, into the kennel, into the fire, and have buried them in the earth. I &s;hall try if all the elements are in league again&s;t me. I &s;hall hang them out in the free air, that they may rot like a thief on the gallows.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="031735_0029_0FEE28E886B91D78">
He immediately went and &s;ecured them upon a nail on the wall of his hou&s;e near the window of his own chamber; and when they had hung there &s;everal days, he congratulated him&s;elf on his invention, and he rejoiced that at la&s;t he got the&s;e cur&s;ed boots di&s;po&s;ed of, that had wrought him &s;o much vexation and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, the boots were ob&s;erved by the boys in the &s;treet, who began to divert them|&s;elves by throwing &s;tones at them, and happy was he who was lucky enough to hit them. The boys were often indeed cha&s;ed away by Loren|zano, who did not reli&s;h their &s;port; but the boots were &s;o excellent a mark, that they &s;oon returned. One day as the Knight was &s;itting ru|minating on his lo&s;&s;es, an unlucky &s;tone, that had been aimed at the boots, took a wrong di|rection, and entering the window, &s;truck poor Lorenzano on the mouth, and drove out two of the few teeth he had remaining. Smarting with pain, and mad with re&s;entment, he ha&s;tily armed him&s;elf with his knobbed &s;tick, and ran into the &s;treet&mdash;but the boys more nimble than he, were &s;oon out of his reach, and he was obliged to re|turn into his hou&s;e unrevenged. He concealed him&s;elf behind the door, however, to be in rea|dine&s;s to bolt out upon the fir&s;t attack made on his boots. Some other boys, who did not know of the accident which had ju&s;t happened, &s;oon
<PB N="31" REF="031735_0030_0FEE28EA0D45EB30">
began to take their accu&s;tomed diver&s;ion, when &s;uddenly Lorenzano quitting his hiding place, &s;allied out to the &s;treet, and blind with rage, mi&s;|took the object of his re&s;entment, and unfortu|nately &s;truck one of the Viceroy's pages, who was accidentally pa&s;&s;ing, &s;uch a blow on the head, that the blood gu&s;hed at once from his mouth and no&s;trils.</P>
<P>The boys run away, and Lorenzano, who &s;aw his mi&s;take, &s;lunk back to his hou&s;e trembling.</P>
<P>E&s;tifania, who was looking out of the window when this unhappy qui pro que took place, grew in&s;tantly frantic, &s;unk into a chair, and fell into a fit. In a little time, a knocking was heard at the door, and Lorenzano judging rightly that it was an officer of ju&s;tice who demanded admit|tance, had not courage to face him, but retreat|ed for protection to the chamber of his wife.&mdash;Reader, you may have heard of the unhappy Ore&s;tes, who, when flying from the vengeance of his frantic mother found his retreat cut off, and the furies them&s;elves ob&s;tructing his e&s;cape. But had Ti&s;iphome or Megera, or their other &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e name I have forgot, been pre&s;ent in their proper per&s;ons, they could not have offered a more horrid &s;ight to the view of the ter|rified Lorenzano than did the countenance of his own wife. I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe the &s;cene that followed. Lorenzano attended the
<PB N="32" REF="031735_0031_0FEE28EE2F3E1208">
officer to the pre&s;ence of the judge, and was, upon a deliberate inve&s;tigation of the whole af|fair, condemned to pay a fine of a thou&s;and doubloons to the page for the injury he had &s;u&s;|tained, and a thou&s;and more as a &s;atisfaction to the public for &s;o flagrant breach of the peace.</P>
<P>Scarcely had he crawled home, and paid the money, than his ears were &s;aluted with a dread|ful uproar in the &s;treet; an hundred women's voices were di&s;cernable that &s;truck the heart of our Knight with apprehen&s;ion and di&s;may. E&s;|tifania approached the window, and &s;aw a crowd gathered round a woman whom they were car|rying into a hou&s;e.&mdash;This was the wife of an eminent baker in the city, who was pa&s;&s;ing by the hou&s;e of Lorenzano at the very moment when, as ill luck would have it, the &s;tring that &s;up|ported the eventful boots gave way, and down they came upon the head of this good lady, whom they brought along with them to the ground.</P>
<P>"Oh the old hunks, cried the women! mu&s;t he hang out his boots over the &s;treet to murder people as they pa&s;s along&mdash;poor Mrs. Se&s;ame, &s;he was three weeks gone with child, heaven knows if &s;he will get over it. If the old Jew is not well &s;ou&s;ed for this, there is neither law nor ju&s;tice in Mexico."</P>
<P>Lorenzano found to his co&s;t, that there was no want of either; for he was fined in another
<PB N="33" REF="031735_0032_0FEE28F76982A1F8">
thou&s;and doubloons, and the money given to the baker for the injury done to his wife.</P>
<P>"Was ever man &s;o puni&s;hed, &s;aid Loronza|no for a pair of old boots!

<P>The judge con&s;ented, upon paying a certain &s;um for the trouble of the depo&s;it; and tho&s;e famous jack-boots are now to be &s;een among the curio&s;ities of Mexico, hung up as a monument of the baneful effects of <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Di&s;hon|e&s;ty.</HI></P>

<P>THERE is a &s;ort of enthu&s;ia&s;m in pub|lic &s;pirit, which renders it politically prudent in corrupt &s;tate&s;men to di&s;courage it; and yet there is &s;omething &s;o great and &s;o divine in this enthu|&s;ia&s;m, that &s;tate&s;men of a better turn, though they dare not encourage, yet cannot but admire it. We have a &s;hining and &s;urpri&s;ing ex|ample
<PB N="34" REF="031735_0033_0FEE28F8F2623950">
of this in the cobler of Me&s;&s;ina, which hap|pened in the la&s;t century, and is at once a proof that public &s;pirit is the growth of every degree.</P>
<P>This cobler was an hone&s;t man, and, I was going to &s;ay, poor; but when I con&s;ider that he maintained his family, and was above depend|ence, I cannot prevail upon my&s;elf to make u&s;e of the expre&s;&s;ion. He was al&s;o a man of reflec|tion; He &s;aw the corruption, luxury, and op|pre&s;&s;ion, the private frauds, the public robberies, the enormous violation of ju&s;tice, under which his country laboured. He &s;aw rapes unpuni&s;h|ed, adulteries unreproved, barbarous murders either &s;creened by church &s;anctuaries, or atoned for by money; in a word, he &s;aw univer&s;al de|generacy of manners, partly from the want of power in the government to cha&s;ti&s;e offenders. In this &s;ituation he re&s;olved to undertake the arduous ta&s;k of reforming the&s;e di&s;orders, and thought it both lawful and expedient to a&s;&s;ume the authority of avenger of the innocent, and the terror of the guilty.</P>
<P>Full of this romantic re&s;olution, he provided him&s;elf with a &s;hort gun, which he carried un|der his cloak; and equipped with a powder pouch on one thigh, and a bag of balls on the other, he &s;allied out in the evenings, and as pro|per opportunities offered, he di&s;patched &s;uch as he knew to be incorrigible offenders to that tri|bunal,
<PB N="35" REF="031735_0034_0FEE28FA79E43890">
where he was &s;en&s;ible they could not elude ju&s;tice; and then returned home full of that &s;a|tisfaction, which is the &s;ole reward of public &s;pi|rit. As there were in Me&s;&s;ina a great number of the&s;e overgrown criminals, the cobler in the &s;pace of a few weeks, did a great deal of execu|tion. The &s;un never ro&s;e without di&s;covering fre&s;h marks of his ju&s;tice; here lay an u&s;urer who had ruined hundreds; there an unju&s;t ma|gi&s;trate, who had the cur&s;e of thou&s;ands; in one corner a nobleman who had debauched his friend's wife; in another, a man of the &s;ame rank, who through avarice and ambition, had pro&s;tituted his own; but as the bodies were al|ways untouched, with all their ornaments about them, and very often with con&s;iderable &s;ums in their pockets, it was vi&s;ible they were not di&s;|patched for the &s;ake of money: and their num|bers made it as evident that they did not fall vic|tims to private revenge.</P>

He began with putting his excellency in mind of his oath, who a&s;&s;ured him he meant to keep it religiou&s;ly. The cobler then proceeded to the following harangue: "I, Sir, have been alone that in&s;tru|ment of ju&s;tice, who di&s;patched in &s;o &s;hort a time &s;o many criminals. In doing this, Sir, I have done no more than what was your duty to do. You, Sir, who in reality, are guilty of all the of|fences

He then entered into an exact detail of all the murders he had done, and the motives upon which he had proceeded. The viceroy, who was thoroughly convinced that he told him no more than the truth, repeated his a&s;&s;urances of &s;afety, and thanked him very affectionately for the tenderne&s;s he had &s;hewn him, adding, after all, he was ready to pay him the 2000 crowns.</P>
<P>Our cobler returned the viceroy his compli|ments in his rough way; but told him, after what had pa&s;&s;ed, he believed it would be but pru|dent in him to make choice of &s;ome other city for his habitation, and that too in &s;ome corner of Italy not under the juri&s;diction of his Catholic maje&s;ty. The viceroy thought his rea&s;ons had weight, and, therefore, after thanking him in the mo&s;t gracious terms for &s;upplying that power which the government wanted, he ordered a tar|tane to tran&s;port him, his family, effects, and 2000 crowns, to one of the ports in the territory of Genoa; where this extraordinary per&s;on pa&s;&s;|ed the remainder of his days in ea&s;e and quiet, and the city of Me&s;&s;ina felt, for a long time af|ter, the good effects of his enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal for the public good, and for the fir&s;t execution of ju&s;tice, without re&s;pect to per&s;ons.</P>

<HEAD>THE STORY OF CLARINDA; Containing many Remarkable Adventures.</HEAD>
<P>CLARINDA was neither born to a for|tune, nor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of beauty, but in the early part of life applied her&s;elf &s;o &s;teadily to reading and the improvement of the mind, that it appeared &s;he de&s;igned to atone by the excellence of her under&s;tanding, for the de|fects of her per&s;on. But when &s;he arrived to years of maturity, and became conver&s;ant with the world, either the flatteries which her wit procured her, or her natural vanity, engaged her to imagine her eyes had as much power as her under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>She had naturally a great inclination for po|etry, and her &s;ucce&s;s in one &s;ong attracted the notice of a young gentleman of very con&s;idera|ble fortune, who &s;oon became enamoured of her happy talents in ballad writing. Clarinda attrib|uted the impre&s;&s;ion, not to her poetry but her beauty; however, &s;he continued to furni&s;h him with &s;uch productions as flattered his vanity and humoured his caprice; till at length, that &s;he might no longer mi&s;take the cau&s;e of her mighty influence over him, he pre&s;ented her with a pur&s;e of an hundred guineas, and &s;ettled on her fifty
<PB N="43" REF="031735_0042_0FEE291865E08C68">
pounds a year, in token of his regard to her poe|tical genius.</P>
<P>This greatly enhancing her opinion of her own capacity, &s;he determined on quitting the country where &s;he then re&s;ided, and repaired to London, the rendezvous of the gay, the young and the fair. Thus re&s;olved, &s;he &s;ent a per&s;on to Cambridge (from whence &s;he was di&s;tant but two miles) to take a place for her in the coach. It was her fortune to go up with a young &s;tudent of the univer&s;ity, whom we &s;hall call Urbanus, who was him&s;elf an admirer of the mu&s;es, and acquainted with mo&s;t of the beaux e&s;prits in Lon|don of either &s;ex. Clarinda, by repeating &s;ome of her ver&s;es, and her attracting deportment, per|fectly engaged the young &s;tudent in her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Being arrived in town, &s;he took leave of her new acquaintance at the inn, having been inform|ed before how &s;he might &s;end to him as &s;oon as &s;he was &s;ettled, which &s;he de&s;igned to do by his advice, as near Covent Garden as po&s;&s;ible, that being a place whether the wits generally re&s;ort. Accordingly, in a few days &s;he took a gen|teel lodging in Southampton-&s;treet, where, when &s;he was fixed, Urbanus had &s;oon notice, and as &s;oon repaired to her abode. He gallanted her about to the female wits, and introduced all the male whom he thought worthy of her acquaint|ance. It was not long before her lodgings were
<PB N="44" REF="031735_0043_0FEE2923E97E2588">
the daily re&s;ort of many who really had wit, and of more who de&s;ired to be thought to have it, in&s;omuch that in the &s;pace of about &s;ix months, &s;he had ingratiated her&s;elf into the favour of many of her own &s;ex of quality, as &s;he knew how to flatter them exqui&s;itely well; and the men of figure and quality, as well as tho&s;e of wit, con|&s;tantly paid their attendance on the ladies at her apartment. Among the re&s;t, there was a gen|tleman of great fortune, who was a per&s;on of in|tolerable vanity, that without either parts or per|&s;on &s;et him&s;elf up as a prodigy for accompli&s;h|ments both of body and mind. Clarinda deter|mined to avail her&s;elf of the&s;e foibles, in order, if po&s;&s;ible to &s;ecure &s;o valuable a prize, and as no method appeared &s;o effectual as that of per&s;uad|ing him &s;he was in love with him, &s;he &s;ent him a &s;ong to that effect, which pierced him through the very &s;oul; and a mixture of vanity and compa&s;|&s;ion made him re&s;olve to make the poete&s;s his wife, whatever might be the con&s;equence. The wedding day was therefore appointed, and to make as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, it was re&s;olved the nuptials &s;hould be celebrated at a place between thirty and forty miles di&s;tant from London.</P>
<P>Thus Clarinda by the force of her wit, from a &s;tate of ob&s;curity rendered her&s;elf re&s;pected by the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part of the town, and laid &s;uch a foundation for happine&s;s in life, as nothing but the &s;ame cau&s;e could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;troy. She was
<PB N="45" REF="031735_0044_0FEE29256F673930">
now mi&s;tre&s;s of a reputable hu&s;band, and a very good e&s;tate, which are two nece&s;&s;ary ingredients in the compo&s;ition of a woman's felicity. They lived in tolerable &s;atisfaction in the country for about two months; but the &s;ea&s;on of the year and Clarinda's extreme love of conver&s;ation, ren|dered this &s;eque&s;tered life very di&s;agreeable, &s;o that they repaired to London, and having taken an elegant hou&s;e in Pall-mall, were vi&s;ited by the gay and airy from all quarters of the town.</P>
<P>Would-be, (for that was her hu&s;band's name) though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o high an opinion of him&s;elf, was of a very jealous di&s;po&s;ition, and of con&s;e|quence &s;oon grew weary of &s;uch a promi&s;cuous concour&s;e of men and women as his wife Clarin|da drew together. He likewi&s;e fancied that tho&s;e freedoms &s;he permitted to &s;ome of her male vi&s;it|ors, whom &s;he called platonic lovers, was only a &s;pecious pretext to cover more criminal concerns, and therefore fir&s;t admoni&s;hed his lady, that her conduct was not agreeable to him; and when that would not prevail, he flatly informed her, that for the future his doors &s;hould be &s;hut again&s;t all manner of company.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to recount the daily alter|cations which this re&s;olution of Would-be pro|duced: &s;uffice it therefore to ob&s;erve, that from words the &s;urly hu&s;band proceded to blows; from blows to a &s;eparation of beds, and from thence, in a few months, to a &s;eparation of families.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="031735_0045_0FEE2926F6416F50">
Clarinda, however, applied to Doctor's Com|mons, and having obtained a very hand&s;ome &s;ep|arate maintainance, fixed her&s;elf in new lodgings, which &s;oon became the re&s;ort of the gay and the witty.</P>
<P>Urbanus, her fir&s;t acquaintance, had been &s;ome time out of town, and therefore ignorant of the mo&s;t important revolutions of her life, e&s;pecial|ly of the un&s;ettled and various parts of it, &s;ince matrimony. He retained his love for her, and frequently expre&s;&s;ed it; &s;he received it as her cu&s;|tom was, and permitted him to be her platonic admirer.</P>
<P>Would-be, notwith&s;tanding the &s;eparation, &s;ometimes vi&s;ited her, and happening to come at a time when Urbanus was ki&s;&s;ing her, and &s;he ad|mitting his embraces with all the patience that &s;he could a hu&s;band, the jealous madman, fired with indignation, drew his &s;word, and at one pa&s;s &s;lew the unfortunate &s;tudent. Clarinda, expecting the &s;ame fate, fled out of the room, and whil&s;t her hu&s;band's rage pur&s;ued her, the hou&s;e was alarmed, and Would-be taken into cu&s;tody for the murder of Urbanus.</P>
<P>This was a melancholy effect of her follies, but the con&s;equence was mo&s;t dreadful, &s;ince &s;he was compelled to be an evidence again&s;t her own hu&s;|band, and he was ca&s;t by her evidence chiefly, the other being only circum&s;tantial.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="031735_0046_0FEE292E563ECF18">

<P>This fatal accident &s;truck Clarinda with &s;ome &s;erious reflections on the dire event of her ob&s;ti|nacy and coquetry, &s;o that burning all her books of wit and poetry &s;he retired into the remote&s;t part of Wales; where contenting her&s;elf with her annuity of fifty pounds, &s;he led a mi&s;erable life till death put an end to her troubles; afford|ing a melancholy proof, of how little con&s;equence mere wit is, when compared with the accompli&s;h|ments of a wife.</P>

<P>It is the cu&s;tom on the&s;e occa&s;ions for the &s;ev|eral corporals to ca&s;t lots for this di&s;egreeable office: and when every one expected to have &s;een the lots ca&s;t as u&s;ual, they were &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the major had given orders, that the pri&s;oner &s;hould die by the hands of his own brother, who was only a private man in the &s;ame company; and who when the cruel order arriv|ed was taking his leave of his unhappy brother, and with tears fa&s;t &s;lowing, that expre&s;&s;ed the angui&s;h of his &s;oul, was hanging for the la&s;t time about his neck</P>
<P>On his knees did the poor fellow beg that he might not have a hand in his brother's death; and the poor pri&s;oner, forgetting for a moment his pe|titions to heaven, begged to die by any hands but tho&s;e of a brother. The unrelenting officer, however, could by no means be prevailed on to revoke his cruel &s;entence, tho' intreated to do &s;o by every inferior officer of the regiment; but on the contrary, he &s;wore that he, and he only, &s;hould be the executioner, if it was merely for example &s;ake, and to make ju&s;tice appear more terrible. When much time had been wa&s;ted in fruitle&s;s endeavours to &s;often the rigour of this
<PB N="49" REF="031735_0048_0FEE29379D8C0A88">
inhuman &s;entence, the pri&s;oner prepares to die, and the brother to be the executioner.</P>
<P>The major &s;trict to his maxims of cruelty, &s;tands clo&s;e to &s;ee that the piece was properly loaded, which being done he directs that the third motion of his cane &s;hall be the &s;ignal of his di&s;|charge, and at the third motion receives (in&s;tead of the pri&s;oner) the bullets through his own head.</P>
<P>The man had no &s;ooner di&s;charged his piece, than throwing it on the ground, he exclaimed as follows:&mdash;"He that can give no mercy, no mercy let him receive. Now I &s;ubmit! I had ra|ther die this hour for his death, than live an hundred years and take away the life of my brother." No per&s;on &s;eemed to be &s;orry for this unexpected piece of ju&s;tice on the inhuman ma|jor, and the man being ordered into cu&s;tody, many gentlemen pre&s;ent, who had been witne&s;&s;es of the whole affair, joined to intreat the officers to defer the execution of the other brother till the queen's plea&s;ure &s;hould be known.</P>

All at once Mons. Fo&s;cue was mi&s;&s;ing; diligent &s;earch was made after him in every place; the ponds were drawn, and every method, which human imagina|tion

could &s;ugge&s;t, was taken to find him, but all in vain.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after, his hou&s;e was &s;old, and the purcha&s;er beginning either to rebuild it, or make &s;ome alteration in it, the workman di&s;cov|ered a door in the cellar, with a key in the lock, which he ordered to be opened, and on going down they found Mons Fo&s;cue lying dead on the ground, with a candle&s;tick near him, but no candle in it, which he had eat; and on &s;earching farther, they found the va&s;t wealth that he had ama&s;&s;ed. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that when Mons. Fo&s;cue went into his cave, the door by &s;ome accident &s;hut after him, and being out of the call of any per&s;on, he peri&s;hed for want of food. He had knawed the fle&s;h of both his arms, as is &s;uppo&s;ed for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Thus did this mi&s;er die in the mid&s;t of his trea&s;ure, to the &s;candal of him&s;elf, and to the prejudice of the whole &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>A MEMORABLE INSTANCE OF REAL LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>PHILARIO was the &s;on of an Engli&s;h merchant, who had re&s;ided long at Cadiz; he had been &s;ent young to England for the advan|tage of his education, at the royal college of Ea|ton, and while there, fell in love with I&s;abella, the only daughter of a gentleman of good fami|ly and e&s;tate, who had promi&s;ed this lady to a di&s;tant relation of his own name; but &s;he had an aver&s;ion to the propo&s;ed match, and openly avow|ed her pa&s;&s;ion for Philario, which the father was &s;o far from approving of, that being provoked by her oppo&s;ition to his orders, he commanded her, under penalty of his di&s;plea&s;ure, never more to conver&s;e with her lover.</P>
<P>I&s;abella, notwith&s;tanding this re&s;traint found means to e&s;cape, and dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf in boy's cloaths, embarked with Philario, in a Spani&s;h &s;hip belonging to Bri&s;tol, bound for the Cana|ries. But alas! human re&s;olutions are vain.&mdash;During the voyage they were taken by a Moori&s;h &s;hip belonging to Sallee; and 'tis ea&s;ier to con|ceive than expre&s;s, the affliction, the de&s;pair, the a&s;toni&s;hment of Philario. He &s;aw the beloved object of his affections now his partner in &s;lavery, and he &s;uffered more than death, every time that

his eyes all &s;wimming with tears, &s;tole a glance of his beloved I&s;abella. But what aggravated his &s;orrow, to the mo&s;t piercing extremity, was an information he received of his father's death, and that all his effects had been &s;eized by the Span|iards.</P>
<P>They pa&s;&s;ed about a week with the re&s;t of the &s;hip's company, in a dungeon, where they were in continual expectation of that &s;ummons which mu&s;t &s;eparate them for ever. The moon one night &s;hone clearly through the grates of the pri&s;|on windows, and Philario, whil&s;t the others were a&s;leep, took notice of &s;omething concealed in a corner of the room. He went and pulled it out and to his great &s;urpri&s;e found &s;eventy moidores, be&s;ides &s;mall pieces.</P>
<P>He approached I&s;abella, and awaked her in all the extacy of a man who con&s;idered him&s;elf as di&s;tingui&s;hed by Providence. He whi&s;pered his new hope of an immediate redemption, and found means, by the help of an hone&s;t Jew, to be carried to the Alcaid; and tru&s;ting his gold with the I&s;raelite, propo&s;ed to ran&s;om him&s;elf and his beloved I&s;abella, whom he called his broth|er; but the conflict of pa&s;&s;ions had &s;o vi&s;ible an effect on his looks, that the magi&s;trate took the advantage, and in&s;i&s;ted on the whole &s;um as the ran&s;om for one only, which was offered for both He bid him name either his brother or him&s;elf;

but advi&s;ed him to lo&s;e no time, as an Engli&s;h &s;hip was to &s;ail out of the harbour in a few days with ran&s;omed captives. Philario trembled with fear, he knew not what to do; either he mu&s;t go into &s;lavery him&s;elf, or the dear partner of his life mu&s;t be confined within the walls of a &s;erag|lio.</P>
<P>He went out with the Jew, and took a &s;udden re&s;olution. But what was it? to pay the money for the ran&s;om of I&s;abella, and remain in &s;lavery him&s;elf. He communicated the fatal news to the per&s;on deare&s;t to him in the world; but what tongue can expre&s;s her agony; &s;he fell into &s;trong convul&s;ions; but let mankind attend to the inter|po&s;itions of Providence.</P>
<P>A Jew had lately arrived from Gibraltar, and having met with his brother I&s;raelite, the conver|&s;ation turned on the two captives, and it was agreed upon betwixt them to pay the ran&s;om, and accompany the lovers to their native coun|try.</P>

<HEAD>INSTANCES OF TRUE AND FALSE COURAGE.</HEAD>
<P>DURING Oliver Cromwell's pro|tector&s;hip, a noi&s;y young officer, who had been bred in France, came to the ordinary at the Black Hor&s;e in Holborn, where the per&s;on that u&s;ually pre&s;ided at table was a rough old|fa&s;hioned gentleman, who, according to the cu&s;|tom of tho&s;e times, had been both major and preacher of a regiment. The young officer was vending &s;ome new-fangled notions, and &s;peaking, in his gaiety, again&s;t the di&s;pen&s;ations of Provi|dence. The major, at fir&s;t, only de&s;ired him to &s;peak more re&s;pectfully of one for whom all the company had an honour; but finding him run on in his extravagance, began to reprimand him in a more &s;erious manner. "Young man," &s;aid he, "do not abu&s;e your Maker while you are eating his bread.

Upon their coming into the garden, the old fellow advi&s;ed his antagoni&s;t to con|&s;ider the place into which one pa&s;s might drive him; but finding him grow upon him to a degree of &s;currility, as believing the advice pro|ceeded from fear: "Sirrah," &s;ays he, "if a thunderbolt does not &s;trike thee dead, before I come at thee, I &s;hall not fail to cha&s;ti&s;e thee for thy prophanene&s;s to thy Maker, and thy &s;auci|ne&s;s to his &s;ervant." Upon this he drew his &s;word, and cried with a loud voice, "<HI>The &s;word of the Lord, and of Gideon;</HI>" which &s;o terrified our young gentleman, that he was immediately di&s;armed, and thrown upon his knees. In this po&s;ture he begged for life, which the major re|fu&s;ed to grant, before he had a&s;ked pardon for his offence, in a &s;hort prayer, which the major dictated upon the &s;pot, and which his pro&s;elyte repeated after him, in the pre&s;ence of the whole ordinary, that were now gathered about them in the garden.</P>

<HEAD>THE OLD PROVERB, Take a Wife down in her Wedding Shoes, exemplified in a plea&s;ant STORY.</HEAD>
<P>A GENTLEMAN in Lincoln&s;hire had four daughters, three of which were early mar|ried very happily; but the fourth, though no way inferior to any of her &s;i&s;ters, either in per|&s;on or accompli&s;hments, had from her infancy, di&s;covered &s;o imperious a temper (u&s;ually called a &s;pirit) that it continually made great unea&s;ine&s;s in the family, became her known character in the neighbourhood, and deterred all her lovers from declaring them&s;elves. However, in pro|ce&s;s of time, a gentleman of a plentiful fortune, and long acquaintance, having ob&s;erved that quickne&s;s of &s;pirit to be her only fault, made his addre&s;&s;es, and obtained her con&s;ent, in due form. The lawyers fini&s;hed the writings (in which by the way, there was no pin-money) and they were married. After a decent time &s;pent in the fa|ther's hou&s;e, the bridegroom went to prepare his &s;eat for her reception. During the whole cour&s;e of his court&s;hip, though a man of the mo&s;t equal temper, he had artificially lamented to her, that he was the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate creature breathing. By this one intimation, he at once made her un|der&s;tand warmth of temper to be what he ought
<PB N="60" REF="031735_0059_0FEE2965E8DF5D18">
to pardon in her, as well as that he alarmed her again&s;t that con&s;titution in him&s;elf. She at the &s;ame time, thought her&s;elf highly obliged by the compo&s;ed behaviour which he maintained in her pre&s;ence. Thus far he with great &s;ucce&s;s &s;ooth|ed her from being guilty of violences, and &s;till re&s;olved to give her &s;uch a terrible apprehen&s;ion of his fiery &s;pirit, that &s;he &s;hould never dream of giving way to her own. He returned on the day appointed for carrying her home; but in|&s;tead of a coach and &s;ix hor&s;es, together with gay equipage &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, he appear|ed without a &s;ervant, mounted on a &s;keleton of a hor&s;e (which his hunt&s;man had the day before bought in to fea&s;t his dogs on the arrival of his new mi&s;tre&s;s) with a pillion fixed behind, and a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols before him, attended only by a fa|vourite hound. Thus equipped, he in a very obliging (but &s;omewhat po&s;itive) manner, de&s;ired his lady to &s;eat her&s;elf upon the cu&s;hion; which done, away they crawled. The road being ob|&s;tructed by a gate, the dog was commanded to open it; the poor cur looked up and wagged his tail; but the ma&s;ter, to &s;hew the impatience of his temper, drew a pi&s;tol and &s;hot him dead. He had no &s;ooner done it, but fell into a thou&s;and apologies for his unhappy ra&s;hne&s;s, and begged as many pardons for his exce&s;&s;es before one for

whom he had &s;o profound a re&s;pect. Soon af|ter their hor&s;e &s;tumbled, but with &s;ome difficulty recovered; however, the bridegroom took oc|ca&s;ion to &s;wear, if he frightened his wife &s;o again he would run him through; and, alas! the poor animal being now almo&s;t tired, made a &s;econd trip; immediately on which, the careful hu&s;band alights, and with great ceremony, fir&s;t takes off his lady, then the accoutrements, draws his &s;word, and &s;aves the hunt&s;man the trouble of killing him.

Some time after, the father of the lady gave an entertainment to all his daughters and their hu&s;bands, where, when the wives were retired, and the gentlemen pa&s;&s;ing a toa&s;t about, our la&s;t married man took occa|&s;ion to ob&s;erve to the re&s;t of his brethren, how much to his great &s;atisfaction, he found the world mi&s;taken as to the temper of his lady, for that &s;he was the mo&s;t meek and humble woman breath|ing.

However, Luchin did not cea&s;e his intrigues; he feigned to be very friend|ly to the hu&s;band, and actually &s;hewed him many civilities and favours, to corrupt the wife, and

not without hopes of prevailing with him to yield to his reque&s;t, and to force his wife to &s;ubmit to his &s;olicitations. Even this could work nothing upon the cha&s;te and re&s;olute Jaquinette, who&s;e immoveable re&s;olution made him in &s;ome &s;ort give up the pur&s;uit of his adulterous de&s;ign.</P>
<P>But, her hu&s;band being taken by the pirates, and the city of Genoa being oppre&s;&s;ed with a great dearth, and five &s;mall children crying about the good woman for bread, without her capaci|ty to provide for them, Jaquinette, oppre&s;&s;ed with extreme want and de&s;pair, having no hu|man means to help her&s;elf and children, &s;he, in a fit of frenzy goes directly to Luchin's hou&s;e, and, being introduced to him alone, gave her|&s;elf up to his power, on condition of his provid|ing for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of her family.</P>

<P>IT is not very difficult to bear that con|dition to which we are not condemned by ne|ce&s;&s;ity, but induced by ob&s;ervation and choice; and therefore I, perhaps, have never yet felt all the malignity, with which a reproach, edged with the appellation of old maid, &s;wells in &s;ome of tho&s;e hearts in which it is fixed. I was not con|demned in my youth to &s;olitude, either by ne|ce&s;&s;ity or want, nor pa&s;&s;ed the earlier part of life without the flattery of court&s;hip, and the joys of triumph. I have danced the round of gaiety, amid&s;t the murmurs of envy and gratulations of

If, therefore, I am yet a &s;tranger to the nuptial happine&s;s, I &s;uffer only the con&s;equences of my re&s;olves, and can look back upon the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of lovers, who&s;e addre&s;&s;es I have rejected, without grief, and without malice.</P>
<P>When my name fir&s;t began to be in&s;cribed upon gla&s;&s;es, I was honoured with the amorous pro|fe&s;&s;ions of the gay Venu&s;tulus; a gentleman who being the only &s;on of a wealthy family, had been educated in the wantonne&s;s of expence, and &s;oft|ne&s;s of effeminacy. He was beautiful in his per|&s;on and ea&s;y in his addre&s;s, and therefore &s;oon gained upon my eye at an age <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it is very lit|tle over-ruled by the under&s;tanding. He had not any power in him&s;elf of plea&s;ing or amu&s;ing, but &s;upplied his want of conver&s;ation by treats and diver&s;ions; and his chief act of court&s;hip was to fill the mind of his mi&s;tre&s;s with parties, rambles, mu&s;ic, and &s;hows. We were often en|gaged in &s;hort excur&s;ions to gardens and &s;eats, and I was for a while plea&s;ed with the care which Venu&s;tulus di&s;covered, in &s;ecuring me from any appearance of danger, or po&s;&s;ibility of mi&s;chance. He never failed to recommend caution to his coachman, or to promi&s;e the waterman a reward
<PB N="66" REF="031735_0065_0FEE297DAE352D88">
if he landed us &s;afe; and his great care was al|ways to return by day-light for fear of robbers. This extraordinary &s;olicitude was repre&s;ented for a time as the effect of his tenderne&s;s for me; but fear is too &s;trong for continual hypocri&s;y. I &s;oon di&s;covered that Venu&s;tulus had the cowardice as well as elegance of a female. His imagination was perpetually clouded with terrors, and he could &s;carcely refrain from &s;creams and outcries at any accidental &s;urpri&s;e. He dur&s;t not enter the room where a rat was heard behind the wain&s;cot, nor cro&s;s a field where cattle were fri&s;k|ing in the &s;un-&s;hine; the lea&s;t breeze that wav|ed upon the river was a &s;torm, and every clam|our in the &s;treet was a cry of fire. I have &s;een him lo&s;e his colour when my &s;quirrel had broke his chain; and was forced to throw water in his face on the &s;udden entrance of a black cat. I was once obliged to drive away with my fan a beetle that kept him in di&s;tre&s;s, and chide off a dog that yelped at his heels, to whom he would gladly have given up me to facilitate his own e&s;|cape. Women naturally expect defence and pro|tection from a lover or a hu&s;band, and therefore you will not think me culpable in refu&s;ing a wretch, who would have burdened life with un|nece&s;&s;ary fears, and flown to me for that &s;uccour, which it was his duty to have given.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="031735_0066_0FEE297F3618E080">
My next lover was Fungo&s;o, the &s;on of a &s;tock|jobber, who&s;e vi&s;its my friends, by the importu|nity of per&s;ua&s;ion, prevailed upon me to allow. Fungo&s;o was indeed no very &s;uitable companion, for having been bred in a compting-hou&s;e he &s;poke a language unintelligible in any other place. He had no de&s;ire of any reputation but that of an acute progno&s;ticator of the changes in the funds; nor had any means of rai&s;ing merriment, but by telling how &s;omebody was over-reached in a bar|gain by his father. He was, however, a youth of great &s;obriety and prudence, and frequently in|formed us how carefully he would improve my fortune. I was in no ha&s;te to conclude the match, but was &s;o much awed by my parents that I dur&s;t not di&s;mi&s;s him, and might perhaps have been doomed for ever to the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of igno|rance, and the jargon of u&s;ury, had not a fraud been di&s;covered in the &s;ettlement, which &s;et me free from the per&s;ecution of grovling pride and pecuniary impudence.</P>
<P>I was afterwards &s;ix months without any par|ticular notice, but at la&s;t became the idol of the glittering Flo&s;culus, who pre&s;cribed the mode of embroidery to all the fops of his time, and vari|ed at plea&s;ure the cock of every hat; and the &s;leeve of every coat, that appeared in fa&s;hionable a&s;|&s;emblies.

hear without emotion: he commended my &s;kill in dre&s;s, my judgment in &s;uiting colours, and my art in di&s;po&s;ing ornaments. But Flo&s;culus was too much engaged by his own elegance, to be &s;uf|ficiently attentive to the duties of a lover. He expected to be repaid part of his tribute, and &s;taid away three days becau&s;e I neglected to take no|tice of a new coat. I &s;oon found that Flo&s;cu|lus was rather a rival than an admirer, and that we &s;hould probably live in perpetual &s;truggle of emulous finery, and &s;pend our lives in &s;tratagems to be fir&s;t in the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>I had &s;oon after the honour, at a fea&s;t, of at|tracting the eyes of Dentatus, one of tho&s;e human beings who&s;e only happine&s;s is to dine.

<HEAD>LOVE'S INGENUITY; OR, CUPID'S CUNNING.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Before the Marriage-Act took place a remark|able nuptial ceremony was performed in a plea&s;ant village not far from Exeter.</HEAD>
<P>IN this village, one Mr. Placid occupied a pretty paternal &s;eat, and a well cultivated fam|ily e&s;tate. His &s;pou&s;e was what the world calls a good woman, that is, &s;he was neat, careful, and an excellent hou&s;ewife; but if we con&s;ider the petulancy of her temper, &s;he was not &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing as one might imagine.</P>
<P>Mr. Placid had been ble&s;t by this lady with a beautiful daughter, named Juliana, adorned with every exterior charm, and embelli&s;hed with ev|ery polite accompli&s;hment; happy in the ex|cellence of her temper, and the benevolence of her heart; replete with all that could in&s;pire men with love, but devoid of that coqueti&s;h acrimo|ny which creates envy in the bo&s;om of a wo|man</P>
<P>Mr Placid had for his near neighbour, one Doctor Prig, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed two fat livings in that part of the country, one of which was the pari&s;h where he re&s;ided.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="031735_0071_0FEE2994E987D218">
Doctor Prig was the &s;on of a dignified eccle&s;ia&s;|tic. In his childhood he had been &s;poiled in the nur&s;ery, by the indulgence of his mother, who dying when he was about ten years of age, left him to the care of his &s;urviving parent, who was too much wrapt up in his own importance, and the &s;tudy of the father's to de&s;cend to the con&s;ideration of his child's future welfare. He was therefore, to prevent trouble, &s;ent to a board|ing &s;chool in the neighbourhood, where he was whipped into &s;tupidity by the careful Mr Sla&s;h|am, in order to make him a cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar. At the proper age he was removed to one of the univer&s;ities, where he was lectured into pedantry, which, added to the profound re&s;pect he always entertained of his own abilities, very frequently rendered his company in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>As Doctor prig vi&s;ited at Mr. Placid's, it is no wonder that the charms of Mi&s;s Juliana made an impre&s;&s;ion on his heart. He was forcibly &s;mit|ten&mdash;declared his pa&s;&s;ion in form to the parents, and after due deliberation, it was affirmed by Mrs Placid, that the propo&s;al was too lucrative|ly elegible to be &s;lighted. As Mr. Placid and his wife, were but one, according to the matrimo|nial law of nations, they never has but one opi|nion, that is, Mr. Placid was always obliged to a|dopt the opinion of his &s;pou&s;e and call it his own, which prevented di&s;putes. Mrs. Placid
<PB N="73" REF="031735_0072_0FEE299F16CCC2F0">
then being of opinion, that it ought to be a match, the hymenial plan of operations was &s;ettled with|out once con&s;ulting the young lady's inclinations, who happened to de&s;pi&s;e Doctor Prig with as &s;upreme a contempt as her benevolent heart was capable of conceiving.</P>
<P>At this critical period arrived Captain Affable, a di&s;tant relation of Mr. Placid's upon a vi&s;it of a month. He had never &s;een Juliana &s;ince her childhood; he was &s;truck with the angelic bloom of her ripening beauties, a mutual tenderne&s;s &s;wam in the eyes of each, and a &s;ympathetic in|tercour&s;e of &s;peaking glances gave intelligence to each of the &s;ituation of the other's heart; they were both, allowing for the difference of &s;ex, equally beautiful, and equally accompli&s;hed&mdash;And a &s;econd &s;ighted &s;eventh &s;on of a &s;eventh &s;on would have &s;worn that the recording angel of the Fates had written both their names in the &s;ame connubial line. As they were un&s;u&s;pected, they &s;oon found an opportunity of &s;peaking to|gether in private. Captain Affable had the char|acter of &s;incerity, Juiliana knew nothing of the di&s;tant ceremonial of modi&s;h coquetry; he de|clared his pa&s;&s;ion; &s;he confe&s;t her &s;ituation; they vowed a mutual con&s;tancy, and equally la|mented the avariciou&s;ly ab&s;urd intention of her parents. After determining upon their future conduct they parted.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="031735_0073_0FEE29A09F333A78">
Capt. Affable next morning feigned an ab&s;o|lute emergency to be ab&s;ent for the &s;pace of four days; he rode po&s;t to London, procured a &s;pe|cial licence, and returned at his promi&s;ed time.</P>
<P>A few evenings after his arrival, Dr. Prig threw out &s;everal illiberal reflections and &s;ar|ca&s;tical &s;neers on the gentlemen of the army, which the captain <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">torted with &s;ome jokes on the pride and incapacity of the clergy. The di&s;pute grew warm, till after many a&s;&s;ertions in disfavour of each party, the captain offered to wager the pedant that he could not repeat the requi&s;ite official ceremonies of the church with|out a book. The Doctor accepted the chal|lenge, and de&s;ired him to mention any cere|mony in which he was not perfect, without Rub|ric A&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Captain named the marri|age ceremony, at the &s;ame time with a &s;neer in|&s;i&s;ting, that he did not believe he knew in what part of the ceremony to put on the ring. The Doctor, in his own ju&s;tification, began to repeat the ceremony. A plain gold ring was produced, which Dr. Prig, impatient to vindicate his ho|nour, and win the hundred guineas, in the agi|tation of his &s;pirits, placed on Juliana's finger, without reflecting on the con&s;equence. Mr. Placid, who&s;e brain was not de&s;igned by nature for the di&s;covery of plots, thought proper to of|ficiate as father, imagining it would be unkind
<PB N="75" REF="031735_0074_0FEE29A225AFC420">
to baulk the Doctor in his repetition, by &s;uffer|ing him to want &s;o e&s;&s;ential a per&s;onage in the ceremony. The Captain repeated tho&s;e parts appointed for the bridegroom, to prove that he did not de&s;ign to baffle the Doctor by the double ceremonial's being omitted. And Juliana pur|&s;ued each &s;entence of the voluble eccle&s;ia&s;tic as bride, to &s;hew her&s;elf di&s;intere&s;ted in the affairs The ceremony was completed. The Captain owned his wager lo&s;t, and entreated pardon for having &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;o complete a gentleman could be deficient in any point whatever. All things were amicably adju&s;ted, the Doctor, after taking leave, retired to his own hou&s;e, and the Captain &s;eemingly to the apartment a&s;&s;igned him at Mr. Placid's; &s;eemingly I &s;ay, for if the rea|der does not already &s;uppo&s;e, it may not be im|proper for me to inform him that he that night took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his lovely bride.</P>
<P>The next morning the whole affair was un|folded to the parents; the &s;pecial licence pro|duced; the validity of the marriage elucidated; and a ble&s;&s;ing craved.

<HEAD>A REMARKABLE STORY OF THE AFFECTION OF TWO BROTHERS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century the Portugue&s;e carracks &s;ailed from Li&s;bon to Goa; a very great, rich, and flouri&s;hing colony of that nation in the Ea&s;t-Indies. There were no le&s;s than twelve hundred &s;ouls, mariners, merchants, pa&s;&s;engers, prie&s;ts, and friars on board one of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els. The beginning of their voyage was pro&s;perous, they had doubled the Southern ex|tremity of the great continent of Africa, called the Cape of Good Hope, and were &s;haping their cour&s;e North Ea&s;t, to the great continent of In|dia;
<PB N="77" REF="031735_0076_0FEE29AFF2F21D40">
when &s;ome gentlemen on board, who hav|ing &s;tudied geography and navigation (arts that reflect honour on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors) found in the lat|itude in which they were then &s;ailing, a large ridge of rocks laid down in their &s;ea charts. They had no &s;ooner made this di&s;covery, but they ac|quainted the captain of the &s;hip with the affair, de&s;iring him to communicate the &s;ame to the pi|lot; which reque&s;t he immediately gratified, re|commending him to lie by in the night, and &s;lacked &s;ail by day, until they &s;hould be pa&s;t the danger. It is a cu&s;tom always among the Por|tugue&s;e, ab&s;olutely to commit the &s;ailing part, on the navigation of the ve&s;&s;el, to the pilot, who is an&s;werable, with his head, for the &s;afe conduct or carriage of the king's &s;hips, or tho&s;e belong|ing to private traders; and he is under no man|ner of direction from the captain, who commands in every other re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The pilot being one of tho&s;e &s;elf-&s;ufficient men, who think every hint given from others, in the way of their profe&s;&s;ion, as derogatory to their under&s;tanding, took it as an affront to be taught his art; and, in&s;tead of complying with the cap|tain's reque&s;t, actually crowded more &s;ail than the ve&s;&s;el had carried before. They had not &s;ailed many hours, but ju&s;t about the dawn of day a terrible di&s;a&s;ter befel them, which would have been prevented if they had laid by:&mdash;the &s;hip

&s;truck upon a rock.

<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s, the captain ordered the pin|nance to be launched; into which having to&s;&s;ed a &s;mall quantity of bi&s;cuit, and &s;ome boxes of marmalade, he jumped him&s;elf, with nineteen others; who, with their &s;words, prevented the coming in of any more, le&s;t the boat &s;hould &s;ink. In this condition, they put off into the great In|dian ocean, without a compa&s;s to &s;teer by, or any fre&s;h water, but what might happen to fall from the heavens, who&s;e mercy alone could deliver them. After they had rowed four days, to and fro, in this mi&s;erable &s;ituation, the captain, who had been for &s;ometime &s;ick and weak, died; this added, if po&s;&s;ible, to their mi&s;ery; for, as they now fell into confu&s;ion, every one would govern, and none would obey. This obliged them to elect one of their own company to command them, who&s;e orders they implicitly agreed to fol|low. This per&s;on propo&s;ed to the company to draw lots, and to ca&s;t every fourth man overboard; as their &s;mall &s;tock of provi&s;ion was &s;o far &s;pent, as not to be able, at a very &s;hort allowance, to &s;u&s;|tain life above three days longer. They were

now nineteen per&s;ons in all; in this number were a friar and carpenter, both of whom they would exempt, as the one was u&s;eful to ab&s;olve and com|fort them in their la&s;t extremity, and the other to repair the pinnance, in ca&s;e of a leak, or other accident. The &s;ame compliment they paid to their new captain, he being the odd man, and his life of much con&s;equence. He refu&s;ed this in|dulgence a great while, but, at la&s;t, they obliged him to acquie&s;ce; &s;o that there were four to die out of the &s;ixteen remaining per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The three fir&s;t, after having confe&s;&s;ed, and re|ceived ab&s;olution, &s;ubmitted to their fate. The fourth whom fortune condemned was a Portu|gue&s;e gentleman that had a younger brother in the boat, who &s;eeing him about to be thrown overboard, mo&s;t tenderly embraced him, and with tears in his eyes, be&s;ought him to let him die in his room; enforcing his arguments, by telling him, that he was a married man, and had a wife and children at Goa, be&s;ides the care of three &s;i&s;ters, who ab&s;olutely depended upon him; that as for him&s;elf, he was &s;ingle, and his life of no great importance; he therefore conjured him to &s;upply his place. The elder brother a&s;toni&s;hed, and melting with this genero&s;ity, replied, "That &s;ince the Divine Providence had appointed him to &s;uffer, it would be wicked and unju&s;t to per|mit any other to die for him, e&s;pecially a brother
<PB N="80" REF="031735_0079_0FEE29B490D65D20">
to whom he was &s;o infinitely obliged." The younger, per&s;i&s;ting in his purpo&s;e, would take no denial; but, throwing him&s;elf on his knees, held his brother &s;o fa&s;t, that the company could not di&s;engage them. Thus they di&s;puted for a while, the elder brother bidding him be a father to his children, and recommended his wife to his pro|tection; and as he would inherit his e&s;tate to take care of their common &s;i&s;ters; but all he could &s;ay did not make the younger de&s;i&s;t. This was a &s;cene of tenderne&s;s that mu&s;t fill any brea&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of generous impre&s;&s;ions, with pity.&mdash;At la&s;t, the con&s;tancy of the elder brother yield|ed to the piety of the other; he acquie&s;ced and &s;uffered the gallant youth to &s;upply his place, who being ca&s;t into the &s;ea, and a good &s;wimmer &s;oon got to the &s;tern of the pinnance, and laid hold of the rudder with his right hand, but be|ing perceived by one of the &s;ailors, he cut off the hand with a cutla&s;s; then dropping into the &s;ea, he caught again hold with his left, which receiv|ed the &s;ame fate by a &s;econd blow; thus di&s;mem|bered of both hands, he made a &s;hift, notwith|&s;tanding, to keep him&s;elf above water with his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ect, and too &s;tumps, which he held bleeding up|wards.</P>

<PB N="81" REF="031735_0080_0FEE29C088618200">
he was accordingly taken into the boat; where he had his hands bound up as well as the place and circum&s;tances would permit.

<HEAD>A REMARKABLE STORY OF A MURDER.</HEAD>
<P>A FARMER on his return from the market, at Southam, in the county of Warwick, was murdered. A man went the next morning to his hou&s;e, and enquired of the mi&s;tre&s;s if her hu&s;band came home the evening before; &s;he re|plied no; and that &s;he was under the utmo&s;t anxiety and terror on that account. "Your terror," added he, "cannot equal mine; for la&s;t night, as I lay in my bed quite awake, the apparition of your hu&s;band appeared to me, &s;hewed me &s;everal gha&s;tly &s;tabs in his body; told me he had been murdered by &s;uch a per&s;on, and his carca&s;e thrown into &s;uch a marle pit." The alarm was given, the pit &s;earched, the body found, and the wounds an&s;wered the de&s;cription of them. The man whom the gho&s;t had accu&s;ed, was apprehended and committed on a violent &s;u&s;picion of murder. His trial came on at War|wick, before the lord chief ju&s;tice Raymond, when the jury would have convicted, as ra&s;hly as the ju&s;tice of peace had committed him, had not the judge checked them. He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to them in words to this purpo&s;e: "I think, gentlemen, you &s;eem inclined to lay more &s;tre&s;s on the evidence of an apparition, than it will

bear. I cannot &s;ay I give much credit to the&s;e kind of &s;tories; but be that as it will, we have no right to follow our own private opinions here; we are now in a court of law, and mu&s;t be de|termined according to it; and I know not of any law now in being which will admit of the te&s;|timony of an apparition; nor yet if it did, doth the gho&s;t appear to give evidence&mdash;Crier," &s;aid he, "call the gho&s;t," which was thrice done, but to no purpo&s;e, it appeared not. Gen|tlemen of the jury," continued the judge "the pri&s;oner at the bar, as you have heard by unde|niable witne&s;&s;es, is a man of the mo&s;t unblem|i&s;hed character, nor hath it appeared in cour&s;e of the examination, that there was any manner of quarrel or grudge between him and the party decea&s;ed. I do believe him to be perfectly in|nocent; and as there is no evidence again&s;t him either po&s;itive or circum&s;tantial, he mu&s;t be ac|quitted. But from many circum&s;tances which have aro&s;e during the trial, I do &s;trongly &s;u&s;pect that the gentleman who &s;aw the apparation, was him&s;elf the murderer; in which ca&s;e he might ea&s;ily a&s;certain the pit, the &s;tabs, &amp;c without any &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, on &s;u&s;picion, I &s;hall think my&s;elf ju&s;tified in committing him to clo&s;e cu&s;tody, till the matter can be further enquired into" This was immediately done, and a war|rant granted for &s;earching his hou&s;e, when &s;uch

<P>A POOR, idle drunken weaver in Spit|alfields, had a faithful and laborious wife, who by her frugality and indu&s;try, had laid by her as much money as purcha&s;ed her a ticket in a late lottery. She had hid this very privately in the bottom of a trunk, and had given her number to a friend and confidant, who had promi&s;ed to keep the &s;ecret, and bring her news of the &s;uc|ce&s;s.

<HEAD>THE HAUNTED HOUSE, OR BEAUTIFUL APPARI|TION.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG gentleman going down from London to the we&s;t of England to the hou&s;e of a worthy gentleman, to whom he had the honour to be related; it happened the gentleman's hou&s;e at that time was full, by rea&s;on of a kin&s;woman's wedding that had lately been kept there; he there|fore told the young gentleman, that he was very
<PB N="94" REF="031735_0093_0FEE29F54A516738">
glad to &s;ee him, and that he was very welcome to him; but, &s;aid he I know not how I &s;hall do for a lodging for you; for my cou&s;in's marriage has not left a room free, but one, and that is haunt|ed; you &s;hall have a very good bed, and all other accommodations. Sir, replied the young gentleman, you will very much oblige me, in let|ting me be there, for I have often coveted to be in a place that was haunted. The gentleman, very glad that his kin&s;man was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his accommodation, ordered the chamber to be got ready, and a good fire to be made in it, it being winter time. When bed time came, the young gentleman was conducted up into his cham|ber, which, be&s;ides a good fire, was furni&s;hed with all &s;uitable accommodations; and having recommended him&s;elf to the divine protection, he goes to bed, where having kept &s;ome time awake, and finding no di&s;turbance, he fell a&s;leep; out of which he was waked, about three o'clock in the morning, by the opening of the chamber door, and the coming in of &s;omething in the ap|pearance of a young woman, having a night|dre&s;s on her head, and only her &s;hift on; but he had no perfect view of her, for his candle was burnt out. And though there was a fire in the room, yet it gave not light enough to &s;ee her di&s;|tinctly. But this unknown vi&s;itant going to the chimney, took the poker and &s;tirred up the fire,
<PB N="95" REF="031735_0094_0FEE29F6D04AA398">
by the flaming light whereof, he could di&s;cern the appearance of a young gentlewoman more di&s;tinctly; but whether it was fle&s;h or blood, or any airy phantom, he knew not. This lovely appearance having &s;tood &s;ome time before the fire, as if to warm her, at la&s;t walked two or three times about the room, and came to the bed-&s;ide, where having &s;tood a little while, &s;he took up the bed-cloaths and went into bed, pulling the bed|cloaths upon her again, and lay very quietly. The young gentleman was a little &s;tartled at this unknown bed-fellow, and upon her approach, lay on the further &s;ide of the bed, not knowing whether he had be&s;t ri&s;e or not. At la&s;t, lying very &s;till, he perceived his bed-fellow to breathe, by which, gue&s;&s;ing her to be fle&s;h and blood, he drew nearer to her, and, taking her by the hand, found it warm, and that it was no airy phantom, but &s;ub&s;tantial fle&s;h and blood; and finding &s;he had a ring on her finger, he took it off unper|ceived; the gentlewoman being all this while a&s;leep, he let her lie without di&s;turbing her, &s;he flung off the bed-cloaths again, and getting up, walked three or four times about the room, as &s;he had done before; and then &s;tanding &s;ome time before the door, opened it, went out, and &s;hut it after her. The young gentleman, per|ceiving by this in what manner the room was haunted, ro&s;e up, and locked the door on the in|&s;ide,
<PB N="96" REF="031735_0095_0FEE29FC0D7A3DB8">
and then lay down again, and &s;lept till morning; at which time the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e came to him to know how he did, and whether he had &s;een any thing, or not? He told him, there was an apparition appeared to him, but begged the favour of him that he would not urge him to &s;ay any thing further, till the whole fa|mily were all together. The gentleman compli|ed with his reque&s;t, telling him, as long as he was well, he was very well &s;atisfied. The de&s;ire the whole family had to know the i&s;&s;ue of this affair, made them dre&s;s with more expedition than u&s;ual; &s;o that there was a general a&s;&s;embly of the gentle|men and ladies before eleven o'clock, not one of them being willing to appear in her di&s;habille. When they were all got together in the great hall, the young gentleman told them, that he had one favour to de&s;ire of the ladies before he could &s;ay any thing, and that was, to know whether any of them had lo&s;t a ring? The young gentlewoman from who&s;e finger it was taken, having mi&s;&s;ed it all the morning, and not knowing how &s;he lo&s;t it, was glad to hear of it again, and readily owned &s;he wanted a ring, but whether lo&s;t or mi&s;laid, &s;he knew not. The young gentleman a&s;ked her if that was it, giving it into her hand, which &s;he acknowledged to be hers, and thanking him, he turned to the gentleman, the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e; "Now, Sir," &s;aid he, "I can a&s;&s;ure you," ta|king
<PB N="97" REF="031735_0096_0FEE2A0666B8CBC8">
the gentlewoman by the hand, "this is the lovely &s;pirit by which your chamber is haunted." And thereupon repeated what is related. I want words to expre&s;s the confu&s;ion the young gentle|woman &s;eemed to be in at this relation, who de|clared her&s;elf perfectly ignorant of all that he had &s;aid; but believed it might be &s;o, becau&s;e of the ring, which &s;he perfectly well remembered &s;he had on when &s;he went to bed, and knew not how &s;he had lo&s;t it. This relation gave the whole com|pany a great deal of diver&s;ion; for, after all, the father declared that &s;ince his daughter had al|ready gone to bed to his kin&s;man it &s;hould be his fault if he did not go to bed to his daughter, he being willing to be&s;tow her upon him, and give her a good portion: this generous offer was &s;o advantageous to the young gentleman, that he could by no means refu&s;e it; and his late bed|fellow, hearing what her father had &s;aid, was ea|&s;ily prevailed upon to accept him for her hu&s;band.</P>

<HEAD>THE GAMESTER.</HEAD>
<P>AT Tunbridge, in the year 1715, a gentleman, who&s;e name was Hedges, made a very brilliant appearance; he had been married about two years to a young lady of great beauty and large fortune; they had one child, a boy, on whom they be&s;towed all that affection which they could &s;pare from each other. He knew nothing of gaming, nor &s;eemed to have the lea&s;t pa&s;&s;ion for play; but he was unacquainted with his own heart; he began by degrees to bett at the tables for trifling &s;ums, and his &s;oul took fire at the pro&s;pect of immediate gain; he was &s;oon &s;ur|rounded with &s;harpers, who with calmne&s;s lay in ambu&s;h for his fortune, and cooly took advantage of the precipitancy of his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>His lady perceived the ruin of her family ap|proaching, but at fir&s;t, without being able to form any &s;cheme to prevent it. She advi&s;ed with his brother, who at that time was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;mall fellow&s;hip in Cambridge. It was ea&s;ily &s;een, that whatever pa&s;&s;ion took the lead in her hu&s;|band's mind, &s;eemed there to be fixed unaltera|bly; it was determined therefore, to let him pur&s;ue his fortune, but previou&s;ly take mea&s;ures to prevent the pur&s;uits being fatal.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="031735_0098_0FEE2A0976818590">
Accordingly every night this gentleman was a con&s;tant attendant at the hazard tables; he un|der&s;tood neither the arts of &s;harpers, nor even the allowed &s;trokes of a connoi&s;&s;eur, yet &s;till he played. The con&s;equence is obvious; he lo&s;t his e&s;tate, his equipage, his wife's jewels, and every other moveable that could be parted with, except a repeating watch. His agony upon this occa|&s;ion was inexpre&s;&s;ible; he was even mean enough to a&s;k a gentleman, who &s;at near, to lend him a few pieces, in order to turn his fortune; but this prudent game&s;ter, who plainly &s;aw there was no expectations of being repaid, refu&s;ed to lend a farthing, alledging a former re&s;olution again&s;t lending. Hedges was at la&s;t furious with the continuance of ill &s;ucce&s;s; and pulling out his watch, a&s;ked if any per&s;on in company, would &s;et him &s;ixty guineas upon it&mdash;the company were &s;ilent. He then demanded fifty&mdash;&s;till no an&s;wer. He &s;unk to forty, thirty, twenty&mdash;finding the company &s;till without an&s;wering, he cried out by G&mdash;d it &s;hall never go for le&s;s, and da&s;hed it again&s;t the floor, at the &s;ame time, attempting to da&s;h out his brains again&s;t the marble chimney-piece.</P>
<P>The la&s;t act of de&s;peration immediately excited the attention of the whole company; they in|&s;tantly gathered round, and prevented the effects of his pa&s;&s;ion; and after he again became cool,
<PB N="100" REF="031735_0099_0FEE2A57DBEA7430">
he was permitted to return home, with &s;ullen di&s;content, to his wife. Upon his entering her apartment, &s;he received him with her u&s;ual ten|derne&s;s and &s;atisfaction; while he an&s;wered her care&s;&s;es with contempt and &s;ternne&s;s; his di&s;po|&s;ition being quite altered with his misfortunes. "But my dear Jemmy," &s;ays his wife, "per|haps you don't know the news I have to tell; my mama's old uncle is dead, the me&s;&s;enger is now in the hou&s;e, and you know his e&s;tate is &s;et|tled upon you." This account &s;eemed only to encrea&s;e his agony; and looking angry at her, cried, "There you lie, my dear, his e&s;tate is not &s;ettled upon me." "I beg your pardon, &s;ays &s;he, I really thought it was, at lea&s;t you have al|ways told me &s;o." "No," returned he, as &s;ure as you and I are to be mi&s;erable here, and our children beggars hereafter, I have &s;old the rever|&s;ion of it this day, and have lo&s;t every farthing I got for it at the hazard table. "What, all," replied the lady, "Yes, every farthing, return|ed he, "and I owe a thou&s;and pounds more than I have to pay." Thus &s;peaking, he took a few frantic &s;teps acro&s;s the room. When the lady had a little enjoyed his perplexity, "No, my dear, cried &s;he, you have lo&s;t but a trifle, and you owe nothing; our brother and I have taken care to prevent the effects of your ra&s;hne&s;s, and

Her prudence had the proper effect, he ever after retained a &s;en&s;e of his former follies, and never played for the &s;malle&s;t &s;ums, even for amu&s;ement.</P>

Sir George was &s;en&s;ible of the im|portance of the advice, and the &s;ucce&s;sful expe|dition of the captain; but after the fight was over, the victory obtained, and the proper ad|vantages made of it, the Admiral ordered Capt. Hardy on board; and with a &s;tern countenance, "You have done, Sir, &s;aid he, a very important piece of &s;ervice to the queen; you have added to the honour and riches of your country by your diligence; but don't you know you are at this in&s;tant liable to be &s;hot for quitting your &s;ta|tion?" "He's unworthy to bear a commi&s;&s;ion under her maje&s;ty, replied the captain, who holds his own life as aught, when the glory and in|tere&s;t of his queen and country requires him to hazard it." On this heroic an&s;wer, the admiral di&s;patched him home with the fir&s;t news of the victory, and letters, of recommendation to the queen, who in&s;tantly knighted him, and after|wards made him a rear admiral.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of the reward of bravery, was of the prince of Conte, who being highly plea&s;ed with the intrepid behaviour of a grenadier at the &s;iege of Phillip&s;burgh, in 1734, threw him his pur&s;e, excu&s;ing the &s;mallne&s;s of the &s;um it con|tained, as being too poor a reward for his cou|rage.

<P>Mrs. Foible, a widow lady, had one only daughter, to whom &s;he was greatly attached, as &s;he not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many mental and per&s;onal charms, but was remarkably dutiful to her par|ent, and polite and affable in her general behav|iour. As her fortune was very &s;mall, &s;he had no rea&s;on to think of matching her daughter with any per&s;on above the degree of a reputable trade&s;|man; nor indeed, were her views exalted beyond the bounds of rea&s;onable probability. In pro|ce&s;s of time the daughter, Maria, received the ad|dre&s;&s;es of a young man of much honour and in|du&s;try, ju&s;t out of his time, but who&s;e circum|&s;tances were not &s;ufficient to &s;et him up in bu&s;i|ne&s;s

<P>The young man &s;incere, and indu&s;trious, pro|po&s;ed marriage, and offered his be&s;t endeavours to maintain the darling of his &s;oul with decency and comfort; before they had fixed on the day it for|tunately happened, that a relation of Mrs. Foi|ble's died, and bequeathed her 1000l. and Maria, 500l. The mother elated by this increa&s;e of fortune, began to &s;et a higher value on her&s;elf; and endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade her daughter from the propo&s;ed match, repre&s;enting it not only as beneath her, but that it might ob&s;truct &s;ome more advantageous and honourable connection. But the generous girl, endued with much more noble &s;entiments than her mother, was deaf to all her di&s;&s;ua&s;ions; urged, that &s;he was bound by the ties of honour and ju&s;tice, to marry the man who would have taken her without a &s;hilling, and u&s;ed &s;uch powerful arguments, in vindication of
<PB N="106" REF="031735_0105_0FEE2A21F8923938">
her re&s;olution, that they were &s;oon married with con&s;ent of all parties. The behaviour of the new married couple greatly plea&s;ed Mrs. Foible, in&s;omuch that the &s;on-in-law, having occa&s;ion for an additional &s;um to carry on a very exten&s;ive branch of bu&s;ine&s;s in which he had embarked, applied to his mother for the loan of 200l. with which &s;he mo&s;t chearfully complied, a&s;&s;ured him that &s;he would never demand the capital provid|ed &s;he received the intere&s;t for her &s;upport. But this turn of mind in the widow &s;oon changed; for in a &s;hort time &s;he became want only enamour|ed of an Iri&s;h fortune hunter, and married him contrary to the advice of all her friends. She was now totally changed, and from the tender mother, had degenerated into the thoughtle&s;s woman of di&s;&s;ipation and indulgence, without the lea&s;t rule of rea&s;on or re&s;traint.</P>
<P>An expen&s;ive cour&s;e &s;oon reduced the &s;tate of her finances, which occa&s;ioning her &s;on-in-law, as well as daughter, to intimate to her their di&s;ap|probation of her conduct; &s;he began to conceive a mo&s;t violent re&s;entment again&s;t them. The poor young fellow, on his mother's a&s;&s;uring him &s;he &s;hould never demand the money, had di&s;po&s;|ed of it in trade, in &s;uch a manner that he could not return it immediately without injuring him mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore ap|prehended a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful &s;cene from its being called in.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="031735_0106_0FEE2A250CF31040">
Nor were his fears without foundation; for the frantic mother, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed through her own follies, and the extravigance of an abandoned hu&s;band, not only demanded the money to be immediately re&s;tored, but determined to heap her revenge on the young couple; gave out that &s;he had been ruined by &s;upporting her &s;on-in-law in his ambitious, expen&s;ive undertaking. This di&s;ingenuous report alarmed his creditors; a &s;tat|ute of bankruptcy was brought into the hou&s;e, on the very day that his wife was delivered of a child; and affected her in &s;o poignant a manner, that &s;he died in a few hours after that doleful event. But it appearing on a review that there was more than &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the legal demands of his creditors, the unhappy young man was treated with great genero&s;ity, and enabled to purcha&s;e a commi&s;&s;ion, and depart honourably for the Ea&s;t-Indies. The weak and vicious mother atoned mo&s;t amply for her vice and folly, as being con|&s;cious of her own guilt, her peace of mind was &s;acrificed; and her hu&s;band, when all was &s;pent, treated her with the utmo&s;t cruelty, upbraided her with her ridiculous fondne&s;s, and at length left her to &s;hift for her&s;elf. Thus &s;ituated &s;he had no other re&s;ource than that of a workhou&s;e, where &s;he expired with grief, about a year after &s;he had, at the in&s;tigation of the ba&s;e&s;t of pa&s;|&s;ions, involved her dutiful children as well as her|&s;elf in remedile&s;s woe and ruin.</P>

Nothing &s;urely can afford a more lively repre|&s;entation of imprudence and revenge, than this narrative.

<HEAD>THE PREVALENCE OF LOVE, AND OF PASSION.</HEAD>
<P>DON Guzman, a wealthy merchant in the city of Madrid, was father to Juan, a youth of &s;en&s;e and honour, and guardian to the Lady Leonora who&s;e beauty was only exceeded by the virtues of her mind.</P>
<P>The &s;on and ward conceived for each other in their earlie&s;t years, a friend&s;hip which, in proce&s;s of time, terminated in the &s;incere love and mo&s;t cordial affection, and &s;uch were their re&s;|pective di&s;po&s;itions, as to afford the agreeable pro&s;pect of a &s;eries of uninterrupted happine&s;s. But an event occurred before the con&s;ummation of their wi&s;hes, which ca&s;t a gloom over all their plea&s;ing hopes, and produced the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite
<PB N="109" REF="031735_0108_0FEE2A2C0B86AF00">
pain and anxiety, that can po&s;&s;ibly torture the hu|man mind.</P>
<P>The Marquis de Mendo&s;a &s;aw the beautiful Leonora, and was &s;o &s;truck with the lu&s;tre of her charms, that he determined at all events to ob|tain her in marriage. As he was extremely rich and had very great influence at court, he prevail|ed with Guzman to permit his addre&s;&s;es to the lady, notwith&s;tanding her prior engagement with his own &s;on Juan, for whom it was &s;u&s;pected he had procured a per&s;on of much greater fortune than his fair and virtuous ward.</P>
<P>Though Guzman determined to &s;acrifice Le|onora to the will of the Marquis, he was at a lo&s;s whether he &s;hould acquaint his &s;on, that he had changed his mind concerning the match, or whether he &s;hould impart it to him by &s;ome com|mon friend. At length, however, thinking him|&s;elf the propere&s;t per&s;on to di&s;clo&s;e the affair, he took an opportunity of telling him, that for di|vers weighty rea&s;ons he mu&s;t re&s;ign all thoughts of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Leonora. Don Juan was thunder|&s;truck, at the information, and gave his father to under&s;tand, that though he owed him all duty and obedience, he could by no means relinqui&s;h a claim to which he was entitled by every pre|ten&s;ion founded on ju&s;tice or honour. Having hinted this, the generous youth retired to his chamber to avoid the pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances of his
<PB N="110" REF="031735_0109_0FEE2A35B5377960">
father, who afterwards &s;ent for Leonora, and ac|quainted her with the pa&s;&s;ion that the noble Marquis had conceived for her, and his de&s;ign of aggrandizing her name by a &s;peedy marriage into &s;o ancient and honourable a family. Leonora &s;tarted at the propo&s;al, and &s;olemnly vowed eter|nal celibacy, unle&s;s &s;he gave her hand to the gen|erous and con&s;tant Juan, who was &s;ole po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of her heart, which therefore could not admit the &s;malle&s;t place for the greate&s;t monarch upon earth. Guzman, incen&s;ed at the re&s;olution of his ward, proceeded to more vigorous mea&s;ures, and after a very &s;evere reprimand for her ob&s;tinacy, order|ed her to prepare her&s;elf to receive a vi&s;it from the Marquis of Mendo&s;a, as a per&s;on with whom &s;he was allotted to &s;pend the remainder of her life, and further enjoined her to deny the addre&s;&s;es of Juan. This la&s;t injunction completed her de&s;pair, and her grief was almo&s;t turned to fury, in&s;omuch that &s;he departed from her guardian's apartment, in order to give full vent to the &s;orrow which overwhelmed her faithful bo&s;om. She had for &s;ome time pa&s;t ob&s;erved a coolne&s;s between Juan and his father, and now perceiving the cau&s;e, de|termined to write to him, wi&s;ely judging that a per&s;onal interview at this critical juncture would inflame the old man's re&s;entment, and excite him to &s;uch a conduct as would be productive of much di&s;quiet both to her&s;elf and lover. Accordingly
<PB N="111" REF="031735_0110_0FEE2A374262BF90">
&s;he acquainted him of the injunction laid upon her not to receive his addre&s;&s;es, and painted the &s;tate and condition of her mind in the mo&s;t &s;trik|ing and affecting colours. The dome&s;tic who delivered the letter brought back an an&s;wer, in which Don Juan conjured her by the love &s;he had for him not to forget him, and a&s;&s;ured her that his life was in her hands, nor would he hold it by any other tenure than her con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>As Don Juan, who was at this time on his fa|ther's bu&s;ine&s;s, ab&s;ent from Madrid, could not af|ford her immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance, Leonora deter|mined to go into a convent; and having impart|ed her de&s;ign to her waiting maid, a coach was prepared, which &s;oon conveyed her to an abbey, of which the abbe&s;s was her relation and partic|ular friend. Guzman no &s;ooner heard of his ward's elopement and the &s;pot of her re&s;idence, than through the intere&s;t of the Marquis, he ob|tained permi&s;&s;ion to place in the convent a wo|man that was one of his creatures, in order to be a &s;py upon Leonora: the nuns were likewi&s;e ordered to prevent any corre&s;pondence between her and Don Juan. The Marquis &s;ent to her re|peatedly to de&s;ire permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it her at the grate, but &s;he always refu&s;ed, and not without tokens of &s;corn. Incen&s;ed at this behaviour, he determined to marry her merely to gratify his re|&s;entment, and after deliberating on the means of
<PB N="112" REF="031735_0111_0FEE2A38C8862CB8">
accompli&s;hing his de&s;ign, thought no expedient &s;o effectual as that of removing Juan to a con&s;idera|ble di&s;tance from Leonora, nor was it long be|fore fortune pre&s;ented a favourable opportunity. The lover, notwith&s;tanding the precautions of his father, and the vigilence of the woman placed by him in the convent as a &s;py upon his ward, had found means to corre&s;pond with her by let|ter, &s;o that it was agreed through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the nun who was her confident, that Juan &s;hould come in the night time over a particular part of the garden wall, that was not &s;o high as the re&s;t, and return after his vi&s;it the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>The enraptured youth eagerly repaired to the &s;pot appointed, but to his confu&s;ion and a&s;ton|i&s;hment had no &s;ooner mounted the wall than he e&s;pied a per&s;on walking with two attendants be|hind him, in the &s;treet next to the garden. This per&s;on anxiou&s;ly de&s;irous of knowing who had got into the convent, &s;ent for the watch, which he po&s;ted at the very place where he imagined he was to come back. Having made this di&s;po|&s;ition, the Marquis de Mendo&s;a, for he was the per&s;on, &s;ent to acquaint the nuns that there was a man in the garden. While the lovers, little &s;u&s;|pecting the fre&s;h misfortune that was ready to fall upon them, were giving each other the mo&s;t re|ciprocal marks of their affection, they heard a confu&s;ed noi&s;e in the convent, which obliged them
<PB N="113" REF="031735_0112_0FEE2A3C84C22F78">
to &s;eparate. Don Juan ha&s;tened over the wall, but was no &s;ooner down, than two men ru&s;hed upon him, took away his &s;word, and in the king's name charged him to follow them. The captain of the guard cau&s;ed him to be committed to pri|&s;on, and drew up an information again&s;t him, which was next day laid before the &s;olicitor general.</P>
<P>Don Juan now imagined that his ruin was un|avoidable, the violation of the walls of a convent being in Spain con&s;idered as a capital offence. His death indeed appeared inevitable, and the affair became the common topic of di&s;cour&s;e through|out the metropolis, where Don Juan was gene|rally beloved; all men of honour pitied his ca&s;e, and &s;olicited for him, but with &s;mall hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. Don Guzman and the Marquis now came to a re&s;olution of propo&s;ing to Leonora, as the king favoured the de&s;ign, this alternative; either to &s;ave the life of Juan by con&s;enting to wed Mendo&s;a, or ha&s;ten his death by an ob&s;tinate refu&s;al. A propo&s;al of &s;o delicate and import|ant a nature could not but greatly embarra&s;s the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fair one, who evinced every token of doubt and anxiety, and at length bur&s;t into this exclamation: "If this is the only way of &s;aving the life of Don Juan, I rather chu&s;e to die with him, as I am well a&s;&s;ured he loves me too well to con&s;ent to live upon &s;uch terms, and would grieve that I had prevented his death by &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion!"</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="031735_0113_0FEE2A45CEF61018">
The Marquis, enraged at her per&s;everance, de|clared, that as &s;he was willing that Don Juan &s;hould die, he would join with the nuns in pro|&s;ecuting him, and a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who &s;ought his ru|in. This declaration touched Leonora in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part, in&s;omuch that her re&s;olution failing, &s;he con&s;ented, in order to &s;ave the life &s;he held mo&s;t dear, and having &s;lowly uttered, "Save the life of Don Juan, I will obey," faint|ed. The Marquis procured her relief, and when &s;he recovered, &s;he de&s;ired to be carried to her chamber.</P>
<P>The pardon was accordingly procured for Juan, but, previous to the delivery, Mendo&s;a be|ing for concluding the marriage, the unfortu|nate Leonora was wedded to his mortal enemy, whom neverthele&s;s &s;he con&s;idered as his deliverer.</P>
<P>Don Juan heard nothing of the&s;e tran&s;actions in the pri&s;on, where he was abandoned to the mo&s;t melancholy reflections, &s;o that he waited with impatience the time of his death; and the thoughts of its approach was the only comfort he had, when the news was brought that the king had &s;igned his pardon. On his being acquaint|ed with the terms, de&s;cription cannot paint the agitation of his &s;oul, as the various impre&s;&s;ions con&s;equent upon it &s;eemed as it were to have broken the very &s;prings which put it in motion.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="031735_0114_0FEE2A475588AE18">
The per&s;on who acquainted him with Leono|ra's marriage, endeavoured to pacify him by a vindication of her conduct, giving him a particu|lar detail of what his unfortunate mi&s;tre&s;s had &s;uffered, and of the nece&s;&s;ity to which &s;he was reduced, of giving her hand to the Marquis of Mendo&s;a.</P>
<P>The generous youth &s;tood motionle&s;s for &s;ome time, till at length the pa&s;&s;ion he had for Leono|ra having recovered entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul, he cried out in a plaintive tone, "Alas! why has &s;he loved me to &s;uch a degree? or rather why did &s;he not let me die? what &s;hall I do with a life I &s;o much hate?"</P>
<P>While Don Juan was thus complaining, the officers of Ju&s;tice came to &s;et him at liberty; and he no &s;ooner reached his own habitation, than he wrote to Leonora, expre&s;&s;ing the greate&s;t con|cern for the late tran&s;action, and his unfeigned de&s;ire of the &s;atisfaction of dying at her feet. She returned an immediate an&s;wer, mode&s;tly vindicat|ing her late conduct, and repre&s;enting the inex|pediency of granting the favour reque&s;ted.</P>
<P>The unfortunate Juan was &s;o affected by this circum&s;tance, that he re&s;olved to indulge melancholy till it put an end to his misfortune, and accordingly &s;hut him&s;elf up at home, &s;pend|ing all his time in venting the bittere&s;t complaints again&s;t the &s;everities of his fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="031735_0115_0FEE2A48E06A85E0">
While he was in this &s;ituation, a &s;tranger de|&s;ired to &s;peak with him, and was no &s;ooner ad|mitted into his apartment, than he declared him|&s;elf to have been the &s;ervant of the Marquis of Mendo&s;a, that his ma&s;ter had di&s;covered him when he got into the convent, &s;ent him immedi|ately to give notice of it to the nuns, and po&s;ted the watch under the wall, by whom he was ar|re&s;ted.</P>
<P>The injured Juan, who could not &s;tifle his re|&s;entment a &s;ingle moment, immediately &s;ent the Marquis a challenge, couched in &s;uch terms as he could not refu&s;e without bringing an eternal &s;tig|ma on his character; it being therefore accept|ed, the antagoni&s;ts met, and without any parley drew their &s;words and fought mo&s;t furiou&s;ly. After a &s;trenuous encounter, Juan determining to put an end by one pu&s;h, to a duel which had la&s;ted &s;o long, made a full pa&s;s at the Marquis, and run him into the brea&s;t; but received at the &s;ame time a &s;tab in the bottom of his belly, which was altogether as dangerous. Both of the com|batants lo&s;t &s;o much blood that they could no longer &s;tand on their feet, but fell down toge|ther the moment that a coach came up to them. This proved to be the carriage of Leonora, who having &s;een the challenge upon the table, had ha&s;tened with all &s;peed to prevent the fatal con|&s;equence. Words cannot expre&s;s the divided
<PB N="117" REF="031735_0116_0FEE2A4D0E681858">
&s;tate of the unfortunate Leonora's mind in this critical &s;ituation. Duty engaged her to &s;upport her hu&s;band; affection diverted her attention to|wards her lover; &s;he &s;hed tears in abundance while &s;he was &s;topping the blood that flowed from the wounds of her hu&s;band; nor were the tears le&s;s &s;incere that were &s;hed for the wounds of Don Juan, which continued bleeding. But the principal &s;ource of her grief was the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he was under of leaving her lover in that condition: love, however, at length prevailed over decorum; and &s;he &s;taid till a &s;ervant whom &s;he had &s;ent to the convent of the Carthu&s;ians, brought &s;ome of the nuns attendants, who carried Don Juan to the convent.</P>
<P>Though no audible conver&s;e pa&s;&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion between Leonora and Juan, the Mar|quis could not but perceive the cau&s;e of his wife's delaying her return home, nor could any thing but the langour con&s;equent on the duel prevent him from reproaching her in the &s;evere&s;t terms. The duel was well known at court; but as nei|ther of their wounds proved mortal, ju&s;tice took no cognizance of the matter, and there was no pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P>When the Marquis recovered from his wounds, &s;uch continual di&s;putes happened between him and his &s;pou&s;e, who could not bear the lea&s;t in|dignity offered to the name of her beloved Juan,

that a &s;eparation being agreed upon, Leonora betook her&s;elf to a &s;olitary retirement in order to indulge her reflections on the extraordinary for|tunes through which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed, before &s;he had attained to the age of five and twenty years. Don Juan, who&s;e love though pa&s;&s;ionate was honourable, and therefore would not &s;uffer him to make the lea&s;t indign propo&s;al to its object, determined to quit Madrid, and had almo&s;t fini&s;h|ed the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for his departure, when he received the news that the Marquis, in a fit of jealou&s;y, rage and de&s;pair, had plunged a fatal javelin into his brea&s;t, and in a moment put a period to a more wretched exi&s;tence.

<P>I AM inclined to think that the misfor|tunes, as they are termed, of life, are not &s;o of|ten owing to the want of care, as the having too much, and being over &s;ollicitous to acquire, what nature, the great &s;ub&s;titute of heaven, would ef|fect for us, if we would be contented to follow her dictates.

There dwelt not far from the city, in a little cell among a ridge of mountains, an old hermit, who many years before had retired from the world to that place, to &s;pend the re&s;t of his days in prayer and contemplation.

he immediately went to Abudah, for &s;o he was called, and never failed of receiving con&s;olation, in the deepe&s;t affliction, from his prudent coun|&s;el; which made the &s;uper&s;titious imagine, that there was a charm in the &s;ound of his words to drive away de&s;pair and all her gloomy attendants.

Abudah perceiving that a di&s;contented mind alone was the &s;ource of the young man's troubles: "Be comforted, my &s;on," &s;aid he, "for a time &s;hall come, by the will of heaven, when thou &s;halt receive the reward of a true believer and be freed from all thy misfortunes; but thou mu&s;t &s;till undergo many more, before thou can&s;t be num|bered with the truly happy.

The philo&s;opher's cave of retirement, and the &s;oldier's tent amid&s;t the noi&s;e and dangers of war, are by turns her habitation; the rich man may &s;ee her in his trea&s;ures, and the beggar in his wallet. In all the&s;e &s;tations &s;he is to be found,

Achmet, not under&s;tanding Abudah's meaning, left him as di&s;contented as he came, and returned to I&s;pahan with a full re&s;olution of grati|fying every inclination of plea&s;ure and ambition, imagining one of the&s;e mu&s;t be the road to felicity. Accordingly he gave up his fir&s;t years entirely to tho&s;e enjoyments which enervate both body and mind; but finding at length no real &s;atis|faction in the&s;e, but rather di&s;ea&s;es and di&s;ap|pointments, he changed his cour&s;e of life, and followed the dictates of avarice, that was con|tinually offering to his eyes external happine&s;s &s;eated on a throne of gold. His endeavours &s;uc|ceeded, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fortune he be|came the riche&s;t &s;ubject of the ea&s;t. Still &s;ome|thing was wanting.

In &s;hort, being di&s;appointed, and finding happine&s;s in no one condition, he &s;ought the hermit a &s;e|cond time, to complain of his fate, and claim the promi&s;e he had received before the beginning of his adventures. Abudah &s;eeing his di&s;ciple return again after the &s;tated time, &s;till di&s;content|ed, took him by the hand, and, &s;miling upon him with an air of gentle reproof, "Achmer, &s;aid he, cea&s;e to blame the fates for the unea&s;ine&s;s which ari&s;es alone from thy own brea&s;t; behold, &s;ince thou ha&s;t performed the ta&s;k I enjoined in order to make thee more capable of following my future in&s;tructions, I will unfold to thee the grand mi&s;|tery of wi&s;dom, by which &s;he leads her votaries to happine&s;s.

<HEAD>THE HUMOROUS INTRUSION.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Dyer, who was remarkable for face|tiou&s;ne&s;s and drollery, happened one day to be alone at the Fla&s;k at Hamp&s;tead, in a veni&s;on time, when the Cordwainers company kept their annual fea&s;t there. Dyer ob&s;erved two glorious haunches roa&s;ting at the fire, and made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to learn who they were for. Being told for the Cordwainers company, he determined to dine with them. He knew it was the cu&s;tom up|on tho&s;e occa&s;ions for every member to bring his friend, and con&s;equently that &s;everal, as well as him&s;elf, would be &s;trangers to all but one in the company; and that que&s;tions are never a&s;k|ed, when once admittance is obtained and people are &s;eated; he therefore watched his opportuni|ty when dinner went up, and &s;eated him&s;elf among the re&s;t, as near as he could to one of the haunches, where he did not fail to play his part. He was very plea&s;ant and cheerful, and tho&s;e that &s;at next him were highly diverted; no exceptions

were taken, and all pa&s;&s;ed off as he had imagin|ed. After dinner when the bottle and &s;ong be|gan to move bri&s;kly round, he &s;ung in his turn, and was much applauded. But when the time came that he thought of departing, he &s;hifted his &s;eat, and placing him&s;elf next the door, he began a &s;tory. He had already drawn the atten|tion of the company upon him by his uncom|mon humour: &s;o, upon the word &s;tory, all were &s;ilent. "Gentlemen," &s;aid he, "I am always plea&s;ed when I have an opportunity of remark|ing the flouri&s;hing condition of trade; I remem|ber a wonderful operation for the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in this very company of yours within the&s;e forty years, and I think I can give you a remarkable in&s;tance of it. When I was a young fellow," continued Dyer, gravely, "I was but low in the world, my&s;elf; and I ob&s;erved that the neare&s;t way to wealth was through the road of frugality; and therefore I pitched upon a chop-hou&s;e, in Grub|&s;treet, where I could dine for two-pence. The mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e was remarkably neat and civil, particularly to tho&s;e who were her con&s;tant cu&s;tomers; and the room where we dined was, by means of a curtain, or more properly a blanket hung upon a rod, partitioned off into two divi|&s;ions, the inner and the outer; the inner divi&s;ion the good woman kept for the better &s;ort of folks, of which I had the honour to be accounted one,
<PB N="127" REF="031735_0126_0FEE2A7E75E4AD38">
and the outer was for the ca&s;ual and ordinary &s;ort. It happened one day, however, as I was drawing the blanket to go in as u&s;ual, the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e pulled me ha&s;tily by the coat, and whi&s;pered in my ear, 'You mu&s;t not go in there to-day, Sir,' 'Why &s;o?' &s;aid I in &s;ome heat. 'I beg your pardon, Sir,' &s;aid the woman; 'but indeed you can't be admitted' What the devil's the matter, that I can't be admitted? &s;aid I, &s;wag|gering. 'Why,' &s;aid the woman, with joy in her countenance, 'the ma&s;ter and wardens of the Cordwainers company do me the honour to dine with me to-day, and I mu&s;t keep my be&s;t parlour empty for their wor&s;hips reception!' I thought it indeed but decent to give place to that worthy body, and &s;o was pacified.' The compa|ny upon hearing this &s;tory, began to lay their heads together, to know who this gentleman was, which Dyer ob&s;erving, took that opportunity to &s;lip away.</P>

<P>However, he carried it home, and having ham|mered off the dro&s;&s;y ma&s;s which adhered to it, his wife &s;coured it, and placed it as an ornament upon an old che&s;t of drawers.

<P>Three &s;harpers, having found means to be in|troduced to a king, told him that they could weave a brocade of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip, and of &s;o rare a property, that it would be invi&s;ible to any per&s;on who was either ba&s;e-born, di&s;honour|ed by his wife or had been guilty of any villainy. The king, de&s;irous to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o great a rarity, gave them a kind reception, and allotted them a palace to carry on the manufacture. He fur|ni&s;hed them with money, gold, &s;ilver, &s;ilk, and all other materials. They fixed up their looms, and reported that they were employed all day upon the web. After &s;ome time, one of them
<PB N="132" REF="031735_0131_0FEE2A93F18C8648">
waited upon the king, and acquainted him that the work was begun, and that the brocade would be the mo&s;t beautiful in the world, as his maje&s;ty might be convinced, if he would conde&s;cend to come and &s;ee it alone. The king, to prove the reality of their preten&s;ions, in&s;tead of going him|&s;elf, &s;ent his chamberlain, but without dropping any hint of the danger of an impo&s;ition. The chamberlain went; but when the weavers told him the property of the brocade, he had not courage enough to &s;ay that he did not &s;ee it, but told the king that the work went on, and that the piece would be of unparalelled beauty The king &s;ent another nobleman, who, from the &s;ame mo|tive, made the &s;ame report. After that he &s;ent many others, who all declared they had &s;een the piece. At length the king went him&s;elf, and upon his entrance, ob&s;erved that all the weavers were diligently employed, and that their whole conver&s;ation turned upon the &s;ucce&s;s of their work; one &s;aying, "Here is a noble foliage!" another, "What a grand de&s;ign!" a third, "How beautiful is this colour!" But as he could &s;ee nothing all this time except the loom, and as he could not &s;u&s;pect the report which had been brought him by &s;o many courtiers without any variation, he was &s;truck to the heart, and began to doubt the legitimacy of his own birth How|ever, he thought it mo&s;t prudent to di&s;gui&s;e his
<PB N="133" REF="031735_0132_0FEE2A9581947EC8">
&s;entiments; and when he returned to court he began to expre&s;s him&s;elf highly plea&s;ed with the goodne&s;s and beauty of this ma&s;ter piece of art. At the end of three days, he &s;ent the &s;teward of his hou&s;hold, who, that he might not loo&s;e his honour, prai&s;ed the work even more extravagant|ly than the king had done. This redoubled the king's vexation; and he and all his courtiers re|mained in the utmo&s;t doubt and perplexity; no one daring to confe&s;s, that this famous piece was a non-entity to him. In this &s;tate the affair con|tinued, till upon occa&s;ion of a great fe&s;tival, &s;ome courtiers pre&s;&s;ed his maje&s;ty to have a robe made of this &s;ilk in honour of the day. When the weavers came to the pre&s;ence chamber, and were acquainted with the king's purpo&s;e, they in&s;i&s;ted that none could make up the brocade &s;o well as them&s;elves, pretended they had brought it with them curiou&s;ly wrapped up, and bu&s;ied them|&s;elves as if they were unfolding it. They al&s;o took mea&s;ure of his maje&s;ty, handled their &s;ci&s;&s;ors, and practi&s;ed all the motions of per&s;ons bu&s;y in cutting out. On the fe&s;tival day they returned, pretended they had brought the robe, made as if they were trying it on, and at length told his maje&s;ty that it fitted and adorned him beyond imagina|tion. The king, credulous and confounded, walked down &s;tairs, mounted his hor&s;e, and be|gan the &s;olemn cavalcade, in which he was to

At length a Moor, who belonged to the king's &s;tables, could not help crying out, "The king is in his &s;hirt, the king is naked." The ice was now broke. The next per&s;on to him &s;aid the &s;ame, and the confe&s;&s;ion of not &s;ee|ing this imaginary brocade was &s;oon made by ev|ery mouth; till at la&s;t the king him&s;elf, and all his courtiers, encouraged by the multitude, dive&s;|ted them&s;elves of their fears, and ventured to own the deception. Upon this, orders were giv|en to apprehend the &s;harpers; but they had very wi&s;ely taken care of them&s;elves, and made off with the money, gold, &s;ilver, &s;ilk, and other val|uable materials, with which the king had &s;upplied them. Thus many erroneous opinions prevail in the world, from the dread of incurring the cen|&s;ure of &s;ingularity, though that &s;ingularity &s;hould be ever &s;o rea&s;onable.</P>

<P>HELVETIUS, phy&s;ician in ordinary to the Queen of France, had a coachman who&s;e in|tellects did not very much exceed tho&s;e of the bea&s;ts he drove. John, however, one day took it into his head to tell his ma&s;ter that he was weary of being no better than a coachman at &s;mall wages, and hard work, and that he had a great mind to be a doctor of phy&s;ic, which he ob&s;erved was a much more ea&s;y way of getting money; and that po&s;&s;ibly, with a little good luck, he might come to ride in a chariot of his own, in&s;tead of driving another's. "A phy&s;ician, John!" &s;ays his ma&s;ter, "but how are you qual|ified?" "Oh! as to that, ma&s;ter, you need ne|ver fear," replied John, "if you will give me &s;ome of your in&s;tructions, teach me a dozen cramp words, and let me vi&s;it a few patients with you, I'll warrant you I will do and &s;ay as you do, and I &s;hall be bound to pray for you the longe&s;t day I have to live."</P>
<P>Helvetius humoured the fellow's project, and told him, he would take him out the next day upon a vi&s;it to one of his patients. According|ly John, after providing an occa&s;ional coachman, and being equipped by his ma&s;ter, with a volumi|nous

Upon this a pan was brought to him of chantily porcelain, virgin ware out of the &s;hop, when the Doctor gravely called for a &s;poon, and by way of ta&s;ting, eat two or three &s;poonfuls, a&s;&s;uring his patient that it was very laudable matter; and &s;o in fact it was, being no other than an excellent marmal|ade of apricots prepared for carrying on the je&s;t. John, who&s;e &s;tomach had turned at fir&s;t, recov|ered a little at &s;eeing his ma&s;ter eat &s;o favourou&s;|ly. The Doctor took his fee and they left the patient.

as this would probably prevent a robbery, it would deprive him of an opportunity to gain a con&s;id|erable &s;um, which he would become entitled to upon their conviction, if he could apprehend them after the fact; he therefore very prudently cal|led up four of his ho&s;tlers that belonged to the yard, and having communicated his &s;u&s;picions and de&s;ign, engaged them to enli&s;t under his command, as an e&s;cort to the coach, and to watch the motions of the high waymen as he &s;hould di|rect.

He was indeed greatly &s;urprized to &s;ee them turn the contrary way when they went out of the inn yard; but he &s;uppo&s;ed they might chu&s;e to take a &s;mall circle to prevent &s;u&s;picion, as they might ea&s;ily overtake the coach whenever they would; he determined, however, to keep behind them; and therefore, in&s;tead of going af|ter the coach, followed them at a di&s;tance, till to his utter di&s;appointment, he &s;aw them per&s;i&s;t in a different rout, and at length turn into an inn in Piccadily, where &s;everal &s;ervants in livery appear|ed to have been waiting for them, and where his curio&s;ity was &s;oon gratified with their characters and names.</P>
<P>In the mean time the coach proceeded on its journey. The panic of the pa&s;&s;engers increa&s;ed upon perceiving that the guard which they had hired did not come up; and they began to accu&s;e Spiggot, of having betrayed them to the robbers for a &s;hare of the booty; they could not help looking every moment from the window, though it was &s;o dark that a waggon could not have been &s;een at the di&s;tance of twenty yards; every tree was mi&s;taken for a man and hor&s;e, the noi&s;e of

<HEAD>HISTORY OF THE SIEGE AND SURRENDER OF CALAIS, IN THE YEAR 1347.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the memorable battle of Cre&s;&s;y, the victorious Edward the third, laid &s;iege to Calais. He had fortified his camp in &s;uch an impregnable manner, that all the efforts of the French to rai&s;e the &s;iege or to throw &s;uccours into the city, proved ineffectual. The citizens, how|ever, animated by their gallant governor, John de Vienne, made an admirable defence; and the &s;iege was protracted to the &s;econd year, when the inhabitants were reduced by famine to the mo&s;t deplorable extremities. In a de&s;perate &s;ally, the governor was taken pri&s;oner; and the command then devolved upon Eu&s;tace de St Pierre, the may|or of the city, a man of humble birth, but of ex|alted virtue, who &s;oon found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of capitulating, and offering to &s;ur|render the city, with all the effects of the inhab|itants, provided they were permitted to depart with life and liberty. As Edward had long be|fore expected to a&s;cend the throne of France, he was exa&s;perated to the la&s;t degree again&s;t the&s;e people, who&s;e valour had defeated his warme&s;t hopes. He determined, therefore, to take an exemplary revenge, although he wi&s;hed to avoid
<PB N="146" REF="031735_0145_0FEE2AD7AC9E4978">
the imputation of cruelty. He an&s;wered by Sir Walter Mauny, that they all de&s;erved capital puni&s;hment, as ob&s;tinate traitors to him, their rightful &s;overeign; that, however, in his wonted clemency, he con&s;ented to pardon the inhabitants, provided they would deliver up to him &s;ix of their principal citizens with halters about their necks, as victims of due atonement for that &s;pirit of rebellion with which they had inflamed the common people. All the remains of this de&s;olate city were convened in the great &s;quare, anxiou&s;ly expecting the &s;entence of their con|queror. When Sir Walter had declared his me&s;&s;age, con&s;ternation was impre&s;&s;ed on every face; each looked upon death as his own inevi|table lot; for &s;hould they de&s;ire to be &s;aved at the price propo&s;ed? Whom had they to deliver up, &s;ave parents, brothers, kindred, or valiant neighbours, who had &s;o often expo&s;ed their lives in their defence? To a long and dead &s;ilence, deep &s;ighs and groans &s;ucceeded, till Eu&s;tace de Saint Pierre, a&s;cending a little eminence, thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly: "My friends and fellow-citizens, you &s;ee the condition, to which we mu&s;t either &s;ubmit, to the terms of the cruel conqueror, or yield up our tender infants, our wives and daughters, to the brutal rage of the &s;oldiery.

Look about you my friends, and &s;ix upon the per&s;ons whom you wi&s;h to deliver up as the victims to your own &s;afety. Which of the&s;e would you appoint to the rack, the ax, or the halter? Is there any here who has not watch|ed for you, who has not bled for you? Is there any here, who has not &s;uffered fatigues and mi&s;e|ries a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than death, that you and yours might live to &s;ee days of peace and pro&s;perity? Is it your pre&s;ervers, then, whom you would devote to de&s;truction? You will not, you cannot do it. Ju&s;tice, honour, humanity, make &s;uch a trea&s;on impo&s;&s;ible. Where then is our re&s;ource? Is there any expedient left, by which we may avoid guilt and infamy on the one hand, or the horrors of a &s;acked city on the other? There is, my friends, there is one expe|dient left; an excellent, a godlike expedient! Is there any here to whom virtue is dearer than life? Let him offer an oblation for the &s;afety of the people!

virtue and magnanimity in others, which all wi&s;hed to approve in them&s;elves, though they wanted the re&s;olution. At length St. Pierre re&s;umed:</P>
<P>"I &s;hould have deemed it di&s;honorable, my fellow-citizens, to propo&s;e to others that &s;acrifice, to which I could not &s;ubmit my&s;elf But I thought it ungenerous to deprive any man of that honourable renown, which might attend a fir&s;t offer of &s;o &s;ignal an occa&s;ion; for I doubt not that there are many here who are as zealous for this martyrdom as I can be, however mode&s;ty, and the fear of imputed o&s;tentation, may pre|vent them from being foremo&s;t in the offer. Indeed, the &s;tation, to which the captivity of the governor has unhappily rai&s;ed me, imports a right of being the fir&s;t in giving my&s;elf for your &s;akes. I give it then freely, I give it cheerfully. Who comes next?&mdash;Your &s;on! exclaimed a youth. "Ah, my child!" cried St. Pierre, I am then twice &s;acrificed.

This is the hour of heroes."&mdash;"Your kin&s;man," cried John de Aire!&mdash;"Your kin&s;|man," cried James Wi&s;&s;ant!&mdash;"Your kin&s;man," cried Peter Wi&s;&s;ant!&mdash;"Ah, exclaimed Sir Wal|ter Mauny, bur&s;ting into tears, Why was I not a citizen of Calais?"</P>

The &s;ixth victim was &s;till wanting, but was quickly &s;upplied, by lot, from numbers who were now emulous of &s;o ennobling an example.</P>
<P>The keys of the city were delivered to Sir Walter. He ordered the gates to be opened, and gave charge to his attendants to conduct the remaining citizens, with their families, through the camp of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Before they departed, however, they de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion to take their la&s;t adieu of their deliv|erers. What a parting! What a &s;cene!" They crowded with their wives and children about St. Pierre, and his fellow-pri&s;oners. They embraced, they clung around, they fell pro&s;trate before them. They groaned; they wept aloud. At length St. Pierre and his fellow victims, appeared under the conduct of Sir Walter and his guard. All the tents of the Engli&s;h were in&s;tantly emp|tied. The &s;oldiers arranged them&s;elves on each &s;ide, to behold, to contemplate, to admire this little band of patriots as they pa&s;&s;ed. They mur|mured their applau&s;e of that virtue which they could but revere even in enemies; and they re|garded tho&s;e ropes which they had voluntarily a&s;&s;umed about their necks as en&s;igns of greater dignity than that of the Briti&s;h garter.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they had reached the royal pre|&s;ence, "Mauny," &s;aid the King, "Are the&s;e the principal inhabitants of Calais?" "They are,"
<PB N="150" REF="031735_0149_0FEE2AEA7541AEA8">

They are &s;elf-deliv|ered, &s;elf-devoted, and come to offer their ine&s;ti|mable lives, as an ample equivalent for the ran|&s;om of thou&s;ands."</P>
<P>The King, who was highly incen&s;ed at the length of the &s;iege, ordered them to be carried away to immediate execution; nor could all the intreaties of his courtiers divert him from his cruel purpo&s;e. But what neither a regard to his own character, nor the feelings of humanity could effect, was happily accompli&s;hed by the more powerful influence of conjugal affection. The Queen who was then pregnant, being informed of the particulars re&s;pecting the &s;ix victims, flew into her hu&s;band's pre&s;ence, threw her&s;elf on her knees before him, and, with tears in her eyes, be&s;ought him not to &s;tain his character with an indelible mark of infamy, by committing &s;uch a barbarous deed. Edward could refu&s;e nothing to a wife whom he &s;o tenderly loved; and the Queen, not &s;atisfied with having &s;aved the lives of the &s;ix burghers, conducted them to her tent, where &s;he applauded their virtue, regaled them

<P>GREECE and the Ea&s;t, at their con|querors feet, enjoyed the calm of profound peace. Alexander &s;eemingly contented amid&s;t this tranquility of the world, devoted unre&s;erv|edly his heart to his appetites for plea&s;ure Ban|quets and all the &s;ports of fe&s;tive joy within the walls of Ecbatana, filled up his time; varied his delights. Statira, Thais, and Roxana, by turns, &s;hared and accumulated his de&s;ires. But from the banks of the Hyda&s;pes, a more charming object introduced at his court, was &s;oon likely to fix his love.

The hand of nature, and the work of art, had never formed &s;o perfect a model. So &s;oon as with admiring eyes he had &s;urveyed her over, he ordered Apelles to be &s;ent for: "From thy art I require a new ma&s;ter-piece; of mortals, &s;aid he, "come and paint the mo&s;t beautiful&mdash;&s;he is a &s;ubject worthy thy pencil; go and pre|pare thy colours and canva&s;s; from her bed I will have her conducted before us, that thy eyes may &s;ee her without garb and without veil: all

Ricciardo was a cavalier of honor on the other hand, and had a fair reputation with the father and mother of this lady, that he was as free in the hou&s;e with them as a child of the family. They were both well de&s;cended, and by the fre|quency of vi&s;its and interviews, had contracted &s;uch an agreement of inclinations and manners, that they thought they could not place their af|fections better than mutually one upon the oth|er.

<HEAD>THE LEARNED COUNTRY JUSTICE.</HEAD>
<P>THE wor&s;hipful Simon Simple, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> one of his maje&s;ty's ju&s;tices of the peace for the county of Kent, being one day at dinner with much oth|er company, at the hou&s;e of a neighbouring gen|tleman; after dinner, their kind ho&s;t, imagining that they had not eaten heartily enough, demanded if any of the company would eat a &s;lice of cold neat's tongue; but being an&s;wered in the nega|tive by every per&s;on pre&s;ent, "Come, come," cries he, "perhaps you only &s;ay &s;o, becau&s;e it is not here; fetch the tongue, Thomas, and bring a &s;lice of butter with it,"&mdash;The Servant obeys, but coming into the room, his foot &s;lipped, and the tongue falling from the di&s;h, come rolling in before him.

He therefore orders a &s;houlder of mutton to be roa&s;ted, and &s;et by, till it was cold; and inviting a number of gentlemen to dine with him on the following day, he employed all the intervening time in in&s;tructing his &s;ervant how to throw down the mutton, and make the Latin apology&mdash;which he conceived would produce excellent &s;port.&mdash;His company came at the time appointed, and having dined, our wor&s;hipful ju&s;tice cries&mdash;"I am afraid, gentlemen, you have made but an indifferent dinner, will you eat a &s;lice of cold mutton?&mdash;Being an&s;wered in the negative, he &s;ays, "Come, I know you only &s;ay &s;o, becau&s;e it is not here; Robert fetch the mutton, and be &s;ure you bring a &s;lice of butter with it." Robert obeys his orders, and blundering in at the door, let fall the mutton; on which the ju&s;tice began to &s;cold at him, and Robert (as before in&s;tructed) excu&s;es him&s;elf by &s;aying, "It was only <HI>&s;lap&s;um &s;lingum,</HI> and therefore no terror of the mind."

<HEAD>MODESTY AND ASSURANCE. A FABLE.</HEAD>
<P>MODESTY, the daughter of Knowl|edge, and A&s;&s;urance, the off&s;pring of ignorance, met accidentally upon the road; and as both had a long way to go, and had experienced from former hard&s;hips, that they were alike unquali|fied to pur&s;ue their journey alone, they agreed, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition in their nature, to lay a&s;ide animo&s;ities, and, for their mutual ad|vantage to travel together. It was in a country where there were no inns for entertainment; &s;o that to their own addre&s;s, and to the ho&s;pitality of the inhabitants, they were continually to be obliged for provi&s;ion and lodging.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;urance had never failed getting admittance to the hou&s;es of the great; but it had frequently
<PB N="177" REF="031735_0176_0FEE2B65AECA4198">
been her misfortune to be turned out of doors, at a time when &s;he was promi&s;ing her&s;elf an ele|gant entertainment, or a bed of down to re&s;t upon. Mode&s;ty had been excluded from all &s;uch hou&s;es, and compelled to take &s;helter in the cot|tages of the poor, where, though &s;he had leave to continue as long as &s;he plea&s;ed, a tru&s;s of &s;traw had been her u&s;ual bed, and roots, or the coar&s;|e&s;t provi&s;ion, her con&s;tant repa&s;t. But as both, by this accidental meeting, were become friends and fellow travellers, they entertained hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;ting each other, and of &s;hortening the way, by dividing the cares of it.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;urance who dre&s;&s;ed lightly, and who had &s;omething commanding in her voice and pre&s;|ence, found the &s;ame ea&s;y acce&s;s as before to the ca&s;tles and palaces upon the way; while Mode&s;ty, who followed, &s;peaking low, and ca&s;ting her eyes upon the ground, was, as u&s;ual, pu&s;hed back by the porter at the gate, till introduced by her companion, who&s;e fa&s;hionable appearance and familiar addre&s;s got admi&s;&s;ion for both.</P>
<P>And now, by the endeavour of each to &s;up|port the other, their difficulties vani&s;hed, and they &s;aw them&s;elves the favourites of all com|panies, and the parties of their plea&s;ures, fe&s;ti|vals and amu&s;ements. The &s;allies of a&s;&s;urance were continually checked by the delicacy of Mode&s;ty; and the blu&s;hes of Mode&s;ty were fre|quently
<PB N="178" REF="031735_0177_0FEE267F97464C38">
relieved by the vivacity of A&s;&s;urance, who, though &s;he was &s;ometimes detected at her old pranks, which always put her companion out of countenance, was yet &s;o awed by her pre&s;ence, as to &s;top &s;hort of offence.</P>
<P>Thus in the company of Mode&s;ty, A&s;&s;urance gained that reception and e&s;teem which &s;he had vainly hoped for in her ab&s;ence, while Mode&s;ty, by means of her new acquaintance, kept the be&s;t company, fea&s;ted upon delicacies, and &s;lept in the chambers of &s;tate. A&s;&s;urance, indeed, had in one particular, the a&s;cendency over her compan|ion; for, if any one a&s;ked Mode&s;ty, who&s;e daugh|ter &s;he was, &s;he blu&s;hed, and made no an&s;wer, while A&s;&s;urance took the advantage of her &s;ilence, and impo&s;ed her&s;elf on the world as the off&s;pring of knowledge.</P>
<P>In this manner did the travellers pur&s;ue their journey; A&s;&s;urance taking the lead through the great towns and cities, and apologizing for the ru&s;ticity of her companion; while Mode&s;ty went foremo&s;t through the villages and hamlets, and excu&s;ed the odd behaviour of A&s;&s;urance, by pre|&s;enting her as a courtier.</P>
<P>It happened one day, after having mea&s;ured a tedious length of road, that they came to a nar|row river, which by a ha&s;ty &s;well had wa&s;hed away the bridge built over it. As they &s;tood upon the bank, ca&s;ting their eyes upon the oppo|&s;ite
<PB N="179" REF="031735_0178_0FEE2B67365BF848">
&s;hore, they &s;aw at a little di&s;tance, a magnifi|cent ca&s;tle, and a crowd of people inviting them to come over. A&s;&s;urance, who &s;topt at nothing throwing a&s;ide the covering from her limbs, plunged almo&s;t naked into the &s;tream, and &s;wam &s;afely to the other &s;ide. Mode&s;ty offended at the indecency of her companion, and diffident of her own &s;trength, would have declined the danger; but being urged by A&s;&s;urance, and de|rided for her cowardice by the people on the other &s;ide, &s;he unfortunately ventured beyond her depth, and oppre&s;&s;ed by her fears, as well as entangled by her cloaths, which were bound tightly about her, immediately di&s;appeared, and was driven by the current no one knows whither. It is &s;aid, indeed, that &s;he was afterwards taken up alive by a fi&s;herman on the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, and that &s;hortly &s;he will be carried to the metropolis, and &s;hewn to the curious of both &s;exes.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;urance, not in the lea&s;t daunted, pur&s;ued her journey alone; and though not altogether as &s;ucce&s;sfully as with her companion; yet having learned in particular companies, and upon parti|cular occa&s;ions, to a&s;&s;ume the air and manner of Mode&s;ty, &s;he was received kindly at every hou&s;e; and, at la&s;t, arriving at the end of her travels, &s;he became a very great lady, and ro&s;e to be the fir&s;t maid of honour to the queen of the country.</P>

<P>The Pru&s;&s;ian troops are always ready to take the field; and the 19th of June, at ten o'clock at night, the count's regiment received orders to march at midnight for Sile&s;ia He was at Berlin and his mi&s;tre&s;s at a country hou&s;e four leagues from the town He &s;et off con&s;equently without &s;eeing her; and he wrote to her from the fir&s;t place where he &s;topped, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to live without her, that it was e&s;&s;ential to his happine&s;s that &s;he &s;hould follow him imme|diately, and that they &s;hould be married in Sile|&s;ia.

Never did the &s;ands of Brandenburg appear &s;o heavy as to this charming girl; but at length the journey ended, and &s;he arrived at the town of Hor&s;tadt:&mdash;It was in the morning, and "nev|er" &s;aid her brother to me, "did my eyes &s;ee a woman lovelier than my &s;i&s;ter.

<HEAD>ALCANDER AND SEPTIMIUS. From Gold&s;mith's E&s;&s;ays.</HEAD>
<P>ATHENS, long after the decline of the Roman empire, &s;till continued the &s;eat of learning, politene&s;s, and wi&s;dom. Theodore, the O&s;trogoth, repaired the &s;chools which barbar|ity was &s;uffering to fall into decay, and continued tho&s;e pen&s;ions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had monopolized. In this city, and about this period, Alcander and Septi|mius were fellow-&s;tudents together. The one, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle rea&s;oner of all the Lyceum; the other, the mo&s;t eloquent &s;peaker in the academic grove. Mutual admiration &s;oon begot a friend|&s;hip. Their fortunes were nearly equal, and they were natives of the two mo&s;t celebrated cities in the world: for Alcander was at Athens, Sep|timius came from Rome.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of harmony they lived for &s;ome time together, when Alcander, after pa&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t part of his youth in the indolence of philo&s;o|phy, thought at length of entering into the bu&s;y world; and, as a &s;tep previous to this, placed his affections on Hypatia, a lady of exqui&s;ite beauty. The day of their intended nuptials was fixed; the previous ceremonies were performed; and noth|ing
<PB N="185" REF="031735_0184_0FEE251BA94D7C80">
now remained but her being conducted in|triumph to the apartment of the bridegroom.</P>
<P>Alcander's exultation in his own happine&s;s, or being unable to enjoy any &s;atisfaction without making his friend Septimius a partner, prevailed upon him to introduce Hypatia to his fellow|&s;tudent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found him&s;elf equally happy in friend|&s;hip and love. But this was an interview fatal to the future peace of both; for Septimius no &s;ooner &s;aw her, but he was &s;mitten with an invol|untary pa&s;&s;ion; and, though he u&s;ed every effort to &s;uppre&s;s de&s;ires at once &s;o imprudent and un|ju&s;t, the emotions of his mind in a &s;hort time be|come &s;o &s;trong, that they brought on a fever, which the phy&s;ician judged incurable.</P>
<P>During this illne&s;s, Alcander watched him with all the anxiety of fondne&s;s, and brought his mi&s;tre&s;s to join in tho&s;e amiable offices of friend|&s;hip. The &s;agacity of the phy&s;icians, by the&s;e means, &s;oon di&s;covered the cau&s;e of their patient's di&s;order was love; and Alcander being apprized of their di&s;covery, at length extorted a confe&s;&s;ion from the reluctant dying lover.</P>
<P>It would but delay the narrative to de&s;cribe the conflict between love and friend&s;hip in the brea&s;t of Alcander; the Athenians were at that time ar|rived at &s;uch refinement in morals, that every vir+tue was carried to exce&s;s. In &s;hort, forgetful of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="186" REF="031735_0185_0FEE251D31BF1798">
own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms, to the young Roman. They were married privately by his connivance, and this un|looked for change of fortune wrought as unex|pected a change in the con&s;titution of the now happy Septimius. In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and &s;et out with his fair partner for Rome. Here, by an exertion of tho&s;e talents which he was &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, Septimius, in a few years, arrived at the highe&s;t dignities of the &s;tate, and was con&s;tituted the city-judge, or praetor.</P>
<P>In the mean time Alcander not only felt the pain of being &s;eparated from his friend and his mi&s;tre&s;s, but a pro&s;ecution was al&s;o commenced again&s;t him by the relations of Hypatia, for hav|ing ba&s;ely given up his bride, as was &s;ugge&s;ted, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own de|fence, were not able to with&s;tand the influence of a powerful party. He was ca&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> and condemn|ed to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to rai&s;e &s;o large a &s;um at the time appoint|ed, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were confi&s;cated, he him&s;elf was &s;tripped of the habit of freedom, expo&s;ed as a &s;lave in the market-place, and &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>A merchant of Thrace becoming his purcha&s;er, Alcander, with &s;ome other companions of di&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="187" REF="031735_0186_0FEE2526D6C29190">
was carried into that region of de&s;olation and &s;terility. His &s;tated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious ma&s;ter, and his &s;ucce&s;s in hunting was all that was allowed him to &s;upply his precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of &s;ea&s;on &s;erved but to aggravate his un|&s;heltered di&s;tre&s;s. After &s;ome years of bondage, however, an opportunity of e&s;caping offered; he embraced it with ardour; &s;o that travelling by night, and lodging in taverns by day, to &s;hort|en a long &s;tory, he at la&s;t arrived at Rome. The &s;ame day on which Alcander arrived, Septimius &s;at admini&s;tering ju&s;tice in the fortun, whither our wanderer came, expecting to be in&s;tantly known, and publicly acknowledged, by his former friend. Here he &s;tood the whole day, among the croud, watching the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of, but he was &s;o much altered by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hard&s;hips, that he contin|ued unnoticed among the re&s;t; and, in the evening, when he was going up to the praetor's chair, he was brutally repul&s;ed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another; for night com|ing on he found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking a place to lie in, and yet he knew not where to apply. All emaciated, and in rags as he was, none of the citizens would harbour &s;o much

wretchedne&s;s; and &s;leeping in the &s;treets might be attended with interruption or danger: in &s;hort, he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city, the u&s;ual retreat of guilt, poverty, and de&s;pair. In this man&s;ion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his mi&s;eries a while in &s;leep; and found on his flinty couch, more ca&s;e than beds of down can &s;upply to the guilty.</P>
<P>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this their retreat; but happening to di&s;agree about the divi&s;ion of their plunder, one of them &s;tabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the en|trance. In the&s;e circum&s;tances he was found next morning dead at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a further enquiry, an alarm was &s;pread; the cave was examined; and Alcander was apprehended and accu&s;ed of rob|bery and murder. The circum&s;tances again&s;t him were &s;trong, and the wretchedne&s;s of his ap|pearance confirmed &s;u&s;picion. Misfortune and he were now &s;o long acquainted, that he at la&s;t became regardle&s;s of life. He dete&s;ted a world where he had found only ingratitude, fal&s;hood, and cruelty; he was determined to make no de|fence; and thus lowering with re&s;olution, he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribu|nal of Septimius. As the proofs were po&s;itive

again&s;t him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was proceeding to doom him to a mo&s;t cruel and ignominious death, when the attention of the multitude was &s;oon divided by another object. The robber who had been really guilty, was apprehended &s;elling his plunder, and &s;truck with a panic, had confe&s;&s;ed his crime. He was brought bound to the &s;ame tribunal, and acquitted every other per&s;on of any partner&s;hip in his guilt. Alcander's innocence therefore ap|peared, but the &s;ullen ra&s;hne&s;s of his conduct re|mained a wonder to the &s;urrounding multitude; but their a&s;toni&s;hment was &s;till further encrea&s;ed when they &s;aw their judge &s;tart from their tribunal to embrace the &s;uppo&s;ed criminal: Septimius re|collected his friend and former benefactor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and joy. Need the &s;equel be related? Alcander was ac|quitted; &s;hared the friend&s;hip and honours of the principal citizens of Rome; lived afterwards in happine&s;s and ea&s;e; and left it to be engraved on his tomb, That no circum&s;tances are &s;o de&s;|perate, which Providence may not relieve.</P>

him&s;elf the eyes of all the ladies of Grenada; though he him&s;elf paid attention to none but Cele&s;tina: while &s;he, not in&s;en&s;ible to his attach|ment, began, on her part, to take con&s;iderable notice of her admirer.</P>
<P>Two months pa&s;&s;ed away without the lovers daring to &s;peak, though, neverthele&s;s, they &s;ilent|ly &s;aid a great deal. At the end of that time Don Pedro found means of conveying a letter to his mi&s;tre&s;s; which informed her or what &s;he knew before. The re&s;erved Cele&s;tina had no &s;ooner read this letter, than &s;he ordered it to be &s;ent back to Don Pedro; but &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an excellent memory, &s;he retained every word, and was able to return a very punctual an&s;wer a whole week afterwards.</P>
<P>A corre&s;pondence was now &s;ettled between the two lovers. Don Pedro was de&s;irous to be &s;till more intimate. He had long &s;olicited per|mi&s;&s;ion to conver&s;e with Cele&s;tina through her latices; &s;uch is the cu&s;tom in Spain; where the windows are of much more u&s;e during the night than the day. They are the places of rendez|vous. When the &s;treet is vacant and &s;till, the lover wraps him&s;elf up in his cloak, and, taking his &s;word, invoking love and night to favour him, proceeds to &s;ome low latice, grated on the &s;ide next the &s;treet and &s;ecured on the in&s;ide by &s;hutters.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="031735_0191_0FEE25383828E848">
He waits not long before the window opens, &s;oftly, and the charming maid appears. She a&s;ks, in a tremulous voice, if any one is there. Her lover, tran&s;ported at her conde&s;cen&s;ion, en|deavours to di&s;pel her fears: they talk in a whi&s;|per, and repeat the &s;ame thing a hundred times. The gratings cannot hinder their interchanging vows; though they may prevent their ki&s;&s;es. The lover cur&s;es the envious bars, while his mi&s;tre&s;s thanks them for their friendly interpo&s;ition. Day, at length, approaches, and they mu&s;t &s;eparate. They are an hour in taking leave; and part, at la&s;t, without having &s;aid half the tender things they intended.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina's latice was on the ground floor, and opened into a narrow pa&s;&s;age, where the hou&s;es were ill built, and only inhabited by the lower cla&s;s of people. Don Pedro's old nur&s;e happen|ed to occupy a tenement directly oppo&s;ite the window of Cele&s;tina. Pedro, therefore, repaired to his nur&s;e. My good woman, &s;aid he, I have been much to blame to &s;uffer you to live &s;o long in this mi&s;erable habitation; but I am determined to make you amends by giving you an apartment in my own hou&s;e. Come and re&s;ide in that, and leave me to di&s;po&s;e of this.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t women could not refrain from tears: and, for a long time, refu&s;ed; but, at la&s;t, over|come by his &s;olicitations, &s;he con&s;ented to the
<PB N="193" REF="031735_0192_0FEE2539C4BB8088">
exchange, with every expre&s;&s;ion of gratitude for the kindne&s;s of her benefactor.</P>
<P>Never did any monarch enter his palace with more &s;atisfaction than Don Pedro took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hovel of his nur&s;e.</P>
<P>Early in the evening Cele&s;tina appeared at her latice. She promi&s;ed to repair thither every other day, and &s;he kept her word. The&s;e delightful inter|views &s;erved only to increa&s;e the flame of love; and, very &s;oon the lovers' nights were pa&s;&s;ed in plea&s;ing conver&s;ation, and their days in writing pa&s;&s;ionate epi&s;tles.</P>
<P>At length they both arrived at that intoxica|tion of delight and anxiety which is the la&s;t peri|od of the pa&s;&s;ion of love.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this time Henriquez, the intended hu&s;|band of Cele&s;tina, arrived from Salamanca; bring|ing with him a declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion in Latin, which had been written for him by the head of the college.</P>
<P>The lovers con&s;ulted each other on this event at the latice; but in the mean time the old guar|dian had drawn <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> contract of marriage, and a day was fixed on for the celebration of the nuptials of Cele&s;tina and Henriquez.</P>
<P>Every one mu&s;t perceive that, under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, the only remedy was to fly into Por|tugal. This was determined on, and it was al&s;o &s;ettled that the two lovers, on arriving at Li&s;|bon,
<PB N="194" REF="031735_0193_0FEE253B4BAAFFE0">
&s;hould fir&s;t marry, and afterwards have re|cour&s;e to the law again&s;t the guardian.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina was to carry with her a box of jew|els, which had been left her by her mother. The&s;e were very valuable, and would be &s;uffici|ent to maintain the happy couple till the law-&s;uit &s;hould be decided in their favour. No plan could ever be laid with more prudence.</P>
<P>Nothing was now wanting but to contrive how to effect this e&s;cape; and for this purpo&s;e, it was nece&s;&s;ary to procure the key of the latice. In this Cele&s;tina &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>It was therefore re&s;olved that the next night, at eleven, Don Pedro, after having ordered hor&s;es to wait without the city, &s;hould come and fetch Cele&s;tina; who &s;hould de&s;cend from the window into the arms of her lover, and immedi|ately &s;et off for Portugal.</P>
<P>Don Pedro &s;pent the whole day in prepara|tions for his departure. Cele&s;tina, on her part, was equally bu&s;y in getting ready the little box &s;he was to take with her. She was very careful not to omit &s;ecuring in it a very fine emerald, which had been given her by her lover.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina and her box were ready by eight in the evening; and before ten, Don Pedro, who had already provided carriages on the road to Andalu&s;ia, arrived at the appointed &s;pot; his heart beating with perturbation and hope.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="031735_0194_0FEE253F2B480078">
As he approached the place, he heard per&s;ons calling for help, and perceived two men attacked by five a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, armed with &s;words and bludge|ons. The brave Pedro forgot his own affairs to defend the lives of the a&s;&s;aulted. He wounded two, and put the other three a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to flight.</P>
<P>What was his &s;urpri&s;e, on more attentively con&s;idering tho&s;e he had delivered, to perceive they were no other than Henriquez and Cele&s;ti|na's guardian, Alonzo! Some de&s;perate young cavalier of the city, who was in love with Cele&s;|tina, knowing it was intended that Henriquez &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e her, had hired bravoes, a &s;pecies of ra&s;cals but too common in Spain, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate them; and had it not been for the valour of Don Pedro, the young &s;cholar and the old mi&s;er would have found it no ea&s;y matter to have e&s;|caped with life.</P>
<P>Pedro did his utmo&s;t to avoid their grate|ful acknowledgements, but Henriquez, who piqued him&s;elf on having learned politene&s;s in Salamanca, &s;wore he &s;hould not leave them that night. Pedro, in de&s;pair, had already heard the clock &s;trike eleven. Alas! he knew not the mi&s;chief that had happened.</P>
<P>One of the bravoes whom he had put to flight, had pa&s;&s;ed, muffled up in his cloak, near the la|tice of Cele&s;tina. The night was extremely dark, and the unfortunate fair, having opened the win|dow,
<PB N="196" REF="031735_0195_0FEE254731797378">
imagining him to be Don Pedro. She pre|&s;ented him the box with joyful impatience.</P>
<P>Take our diamonds, &s;aid &s;he, while I de&s;cend.&mdash;At the word <HI>diamonds,</HI> the bravo &s;uddenly &s;topped, took the box, without &s;peaking a word, and, while Cele&s;tina was coming down from the window, fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation.</P>
<P>Imagine the &s;urpri&s;e of Cele&s;tina, when &s;he found her&s;elf alone, in the &s;treet, and &s;aw noth|ing of him whom &s;he had &s;uppo&s;ed to be Don Pedro. She thought, at fir&s;t, he had left her to avoid rai&s;ing &s;u&s;picion or alarm. She, therefore, ha&s;tily walked to a little di&s;tance, looked round on every &s;ide, and called in a low voice. But no Pedro could &s;he &s;ee; no lover could &s;he hear.</P>
<P>She was now &s;eized with the mo&s;t alarming apprehen&s;ions. She knew not whether it was mo&s;t advi&s;eable to return home, or endeavour to find the hor&s;es and attendants of Don Pedro, that were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> out of town. She continued to walk forwards, in the utmo&s;t uncertainty and di&s;tre&s;s, till &s;he had lo&s;t her&s;elf among the &s;treets; while her fears were redoubled by darkne&s;s and &s;ilence.</P>
<P>At length &s;he met a per&s;on, whom &s;he a&s;ked if &s;he were far from the gate of the city. The &s;tranger conducted her thither, but &s;he found no body waiting as &s;he expected.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="031735_0196_0FEE2548BA601780">
She dared not yet accu&s;e her lover of deceiv|ing her: &s;till &s;he hoped he was at no great di&s;|tance. She therefore, proceeded along the road, fearful at every bu&s;h, and calling Don Pedro at every &s;tep; but the farther &s;he walked the more &s;he was bewildered; for &s;he had come out of the city on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite the Portugal road.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Don Pedro found him&s;elf unable to get away from the grateful Henriquez and his father. They would not &s;uffer him to leave them for a moment, but obliged him to en|ter the hou&s;e with them, to which Pedro, fearful of betraying his intent, and fru&s;trating his dear|e&s;t hopes, and imagining too that Cele&s;tina might be &s;oon &s;atisfied why he thus delayed, mo&s;t re|luctantly con&s;ented.</P>
<P>Alonzo ha&s;tens to the chamber of his ward, to inform her of the danger he had ju&s;t e&s;caped. He calls, but receives no an&s;wer: enters her apartment, and finds the latice open; his cries collected the &s;ervants, the alarm is immediately given, Cele&s;tina is mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Pedro, in di&s;pair, immediately offered to go in que&s;t of her. Henriquez, thanking him for the concern he expre&s;&s;ed, declared his re&s;olution of accompanying him. Pedro &s;ugge&s;ted that the probability of finding her would be greater if they took different roads. Accordingly, he ha&s;|tened to rejoin his dome&s;tice; and not doubting
<PB N="198" REF="031735_0197_0FEE254A47268160">
but Cele&s;tina had taken the road to Portugal, put his hor&s;es on at full &s;peed. But their &s;wift|ne&s;s only removed him farther from the object of his love; while Henriquez galloped towards the Alpuxarian mountains, the way Cele&s;tina had ac|tually gone.</P>
<P>In the mean time Cele&s;tina continued to wan|der di&s;con&s;olate, along the road that leads to the Alpuxares, &s;eeking her lover. Anon &s;he heard the clattering of approaching hor&s;es; and, at fir&s;t, imagined it might be her beloved Pedro; but, afterwards, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of di&s;covery, the vio|lence of travellers, or, perhaps, robbers, &s;he con|cealed her&s;elf, trembling behind &s;ome bu&s;hes.</P>
<P>Here &s;he pre&s;ently &s;aw Henriquez pa&s;s by, fol|lowed by a number of &s;ervants. Shuddering at the danger of being again in the power, and dreading a &s;econd time to &s;ubmit to the redoubled tyranny of Alonzo, if &s;he continued in the high road, &s;he turned a&s;ide, and took refuge in a thick wood.</P>
<P>The Alpuxares are a chain of mountains which extend from Grenada to the Mediterra|nean. They are only inhabited by a few pea&s;ants. To the&s;e fear and terror conducted the unfortun|ate maiden. A dry and &s;tony &s;oil, with a few oak trees, thinly &s;cattered, &s;ome torrents and echoing cataracts, and a number of wild goats, leaping from precipice to precipice, are the only objects
<PB N="199" REF="031735_0198_0FEE254DC88E5690">
which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the eyes of Cele&s;tina, as &s;oon as the day begins to break. Exhau&s;ted, at length with wearine&s;s and vexation, her feet being torn by the rugged &s;tones over which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he &s;at down under a rock, through the cliffs of which a limpid water gently ouzed.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of this grotto, the wildne&s;s of the land&s;cape around, the hoar&s;e and di&s;tant murmur of &s;everal ca&s;cades, and the noi&s;e of the water near her, falling drop by drop into the ba&s;on it had hallowed beneath, all con&s;pired to convince Cele&s;tina &s;he was alone in the mid&s;t of a de&s;art, abandoned by her lover, who to her was the whole world.</P>
<P>She &s;at her&s;elf down on the edge of this &s;tream, to vent her grief in tears, reflecting on the mi&s;er|ies that &s;eemed to threaten her; but, above all, her lo&s;t Don Pedro, whom, at moments, &s;he &s;till flattered her&s;elf &s;he &s;hould one day regain.</P>
<P>It certainly was not him, &s;aid &s;he, whom I &s;aw carry off my diamonds. I mu&s;t have been mi&s;|taken. Yet, how was it po&s;&s;ible that my heart &s;hould not have informed me of the truth? No doubt he is now far hence, &s;eeking me with anx|ety and di&s;traction; while I, as far di&s;tant from him, here am peri&s;hing.</P>
<P>While mournfully thus &s;he ruminated, &s;he heard, at the bottom of the grotto, the &s;ound of the ru&s;tic flute.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="031735_0199_0FF098D16E7CECB8">
Upon &s;earching, &s;he found a young goat-herd fitting at the foot of a willow, his eyes bedewed with his tears, and fixed on the water as it i&s;&s;ued from its rocky &s;ource. In his hand he held a flageolet, and by his &s;ide lay a &s;taff and a little parcel.</P>
<P>Shepherd, &s;aid Cele&s;tina, have pity on one abandoned, and &s;hew me my way among the&s;e mountains, to &s;ome village, or habitation, where I may procure, though not repo&s;e, at lea&s;t &s;u&s;|tenance.</P>
<P>Alas! madam, replied the goat-herd, I wi&s;h it were in my power to conduct you to the vil|lage of Gadara, behind the&s;e rocks; but you will not a&s;k me to return thither, when you are informed my mi&s;tre&s;s is this day to be married to my rival. I am going to leave the&s;e moun|tains, never to behold them more: and I carry nothing with me but my flute, a change of dre&s;s, which I have in this parcel, and the memory of the happine&s;s I have lo&s;t.</P>
<P>This &s;hort account &s;ugge&s;ted a new project to Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>My friend, &s;aid &s;he to the goat-herd, you have no money, which you will certainly want, when you have left this country. I have a few pieces of gold; the&s;e I will divide with you, if you will let me have the dre&s;s you &s;ay is in your parcel.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="031735_0200_0FF09747EFD1BEB8">
The goat-herd accepted the offer. Cele&s;tina gave him a dozen ducats, and, having informed her&s;elf which was the road to Gadara, took her leave of the de&s;pairing lover, and returned into the grotto to put on her newly purcha&s;ed di&s;|gui&s;e.</P>
<P>She came out habited in a ve&s;t of chamois &s;kin, with a &s;hepherd's wallet hanging by her &s;ide, and on her head a hat ornamented with ribbons. In this attire &s;he appeared yet more beautiful than when adorned with brocades and jewels. She took the road to the village, and, &s;topping in the market-place, enquired of the pea&s;ants if they knew of any farmer who wanted a &s;ervant.</P>
<P>The inhabitants &s;urrounded her, and &s;urveyed the &s;tranger with admiration. The girls expre&s;&s;|ed their &s;urpri&s;e at the beauty of her flowing ringlets; her elegant form, her graceful manner, the brilliancy of her eyes, even though dejected, their &s;uperior intelligence and mild benignity, a&s;toni&s;h and delight all beholders. No one could conceive from whence came this beautiful youth. One imagines him a per&s;on of high di&s;tinction in di&s;gui&s;e; another, a prince, in love with &s;ome &s;hepherde&s;s; while the &s;chool-ma&s;ter, who was at the &s;ame time the poet of the village, declared it mu&s;t be Apollo, &s;ent down, a &s;econd time, to keep &s;heep among mortals.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="031735_0201_0FF097BA25DD5818">
Cele&s;tina, who a&s;&s;umed the name of Marcelio, was not long in want of a ma&s;ter. She was hired by an aged alcade of the village, e&s;teemed one of the worthie&s;t men in the whole province.</P>
<P>This hone&s;t countryman &s;oon contracted the warme&s;t friend&s;hip for Cele&s;tina. He &s;carcely &s;uffered her to tend his flocks for a month before he gave her an employment within his hou&s;e, in which the pretended Marcelio be|haved with &s;o much propriety and fidelity, that he was equally beloved by ma&s;ter and &s;ervants.</P>
<P>Before he had lived here half a year, the al|cade, who was more than eighty, left the entire management of all he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to Marcelio: he even a&s;ked his opinion in all the cau&s;es that came before him, and never had any alcade decided with &s;o much ju&s;tice as he, from the time he per|mitted him&s;elf to be guided by the advice of Mar|celio. Marcelio was beloved, and propo&s;ed as an-example to all the village: his affability, his plea&s;ing manner, and his good &s;en&s;e, gained every heart. See the excellent Marcelio, cried the mothers to their &s;ons, he is continually with his ma&s;ter, he is perpetually employed in rendering his old age happy, and never neglects his duty, like you, to run after the &s;hepherde&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Two years pa&s;&s;ed away in this manner. Ce|le&s;tina, who&s;e thoughts were continually employ|ed on her lover, had &s;ent a &s;hepherd, in whom
<PB N="203" REF="031735_0202_0FF097461D25F5B8">
the could confide, to Grenada to procure information concerning Don Pedro, Alon|zo, and Henriquez. The &s;hepherd brought word back, that Alonzo was dead, Henriquez married, and that Pedro had not been &s;een or heard of for the&s;e la&s;t two years.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina now lo&s;t all hopes of ever again be|holding her lover, and, happy in being able to pa&s;s her days in that village, in the bo&s;om of peace and friend&s;hip, had re&s;olved to bid an etern|al adieu to love, when the old alcade, her ma&s;ter, fell dangerou&s;ly ill. Marcelio attended his la&s;t moments with all the affection of a &s;on, and the good old man behaved to him like a grateful fa|ther; he died, and left all he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to the faithful Marcelio. But his will was by no means a &s;ufficient con&s;olation to his heir.</P>
<P>The whole village mourned for the alcade, and, after his funeral rites had been celebrated with more &s;orrow than pomp, the inhabitants of the place a&s;&s;embled to chu&s;e a &s;ucce&s;&s;or. In Spain, certain villages have the right of nominat|ing their own alcade, who&s;e office it is to decide their differences, and take cognizances of greater crimes by arre&s;ting and examining the offenders, and delivering them over to the &s;uperior judges, who generally confirm the &s;entence of tho&s;e ru&s;|tic magi&s;trates; for good laws are generally per|fectly con&s;onant to &s;imple rea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="031735_0203_0FF09843ED7D0118">
The villagers, being met, agreed, with one voice, that no one could be &s;o proper to &s;ucceed the late alcade as the youth whom he &s;eemed to have de&s;igned for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The old men, therefore, followed by their &s;ons, came with all the u&s;ual ceremonies to offer Marcelio the white wand, the en&s;ign of the vacant office. Cele&s;tina accepted it, and &s;en&s;ibly touched by &s;uch a proof of e&s;teem and affection from the&s;e good people, re&s;olved to con&s;ecrate to their happine&s;s a life &s;he had formerly intended to dedicate to love.</P>
<P>While the new alcade is bu&s;ied with the du|ties of her office, let us return to the unfortun|ate Don Pedro, whom we left galloping towards Portugal, and continually removing farther from her he &s;o anxiou&s;ly &s;ought.</P>
<P>He arrived at Li&s;bon, without obtaining any intelligence of Cele&s;tina, and immediately return|ed by the &s;ame road, to re&s;earch every place he had before in vain examined; again he returned to Li&s;bon, but without &s;ucce&s;s</P>
<P>After &s;ix months ineffectual enquiry, having a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf that Cele&s;tina had never returned to Grenada, he imagined &s;he might perhaps be at Seville, where he knew &s;he had relations. Im|mediately he ha&s;tened to Seville, there he found the relations of Cele&s;tina had ju&s;t embarked for Mexico.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="031735_0204_0FF098713704F9E8">
Pedro no longer doubted but his mi&s;tre&s;s was gone with them, and directly went on board the la&s;t &s;hip which remained to &s;ail. He arrived at Mexico, where he found the relations, but, alas, no Cele&s;tina; they had heard nothing of her, he, therefore, returned to Spain. And now the &s;hip is attacked by a violent &s;torm, and ca&s;t on the coa&s;t of Grenada: him&s;elf, and a few of the pa&s;&s;engers, &s;ave them&s;elves by &s;wimming; they land, and make their way to the mountains, to procure a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and, by chance or love, are conducted to Gadara.</P>
<P>Don Pedro, and his unfortunate companions took refuge in the fir&s;t inn, congratulating each other on the danger they had e&s;caped. While they were di&s;cour&s;ing on their adventures, one of the pa&s;&s;engers began to quarrel with a &s;oldier, concerning a box, which the pa&s;&s;enger a&s;&s;erted belonged to him.</P>
<P>Don Pedro, de&s;irous to put an end to the con|tention, obliged the pa&s;&s;enger to declare what it contained, opening it at the &s;ame time to di&s;cover whether he &s;poke truth.</P>
<P>How great was his &s;urprize to find in it the jewels of Cele&s;tina, and, among them, the very emerald he had given her. For a moment he &s;tood motionle&s;s, examining attentively the ca&s;k|et; and fixing his eyes, &s;parkling with rage, on the claimant, How came you by the&s;e jewels? &s;aid he, with a voice of terror.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="031735_0205_0FF09749748A4970">
What does it &s;ignify, replied the pa&s;&s;enger, haughtily, how I came by them! it is &s;ufficient that I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>He then endeavoured to &s;natch the ca&s;ket from Don Pedro; but he, pu&s;hing him back, in&s;tantly drew his &s;word.</P>
<P>Wretch, &s;aid he, confe&s;s your crime, or you die this moment.</P>
<P>So &s;aying he attacked him with great fury: his antagoni&s;t defended him&s;elf with equal brave|ry, but pre&s;ently received a mortal wound, and fell.</P>
<P>Don Pedro was immediately &s;urrounded, and &s;eized by the people of the hou&s;e. They take him to pri&s;on, and the ma&s;ter of the inn &s;ends his wife to fetch the clergyman of the pari&s;h that he may admini&s;ter &s;piritual comfort to the dying man while he runs him&s;elf to the alcade, to carry the ca&s;ket, and inform him of the whole adven|ture.</P>
<P>How great was the &s;urprize, the joy, and the anxiety of Cele&s;tina, on perceiving her diamonds, and hearing the behaviour of the noble &s;tranger.</P>
<P>She immediately ha&s;tened to the inn, the min|i&s;ter was already there, and the dying man, in|duced by his exhortations, declared in pre&s;ence of the alcade, that, two years before, as he was one night pa&s;&s;ing through a &s;treet in Grenada, a lady had given him that box, through a latice, telling

him to hold it till &s;he came down, but that he immediately made off with the jewels; for which theft he a&s;ked pardon of God, and the unknown lady, whom he had injured.</P>
<P>Immediately after this confe&s;&s;ion, he expired, and Cele&s;tina ran to the pri&s;on.</P>
<P>How did her heart palpitate with expectation! &s;he could no longer doubt but &s;he &s;hould again &s;ee Don Pedro, but &s;he feared &s;he &s;hould be known by him; &s;he therefore pulled her hat over her eyes, wrapped her&s;elf up in her cloak, and, preceded by her clerk and the gaoler, entered the dungeon.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had &s;he got to the bottom of the &s;tairs than &s;he perceived Don Pedro. Her joy almo&s;t deprived her of &s;peech; &s;he leaned again&s;t the wall, her head &s;unk on her &s;houlders, and the tears &s;treamed down her cheeks. She wiped them away, &s;topped a moment to take breath, and endeavouring to &s;peak with firmne&s;s, ap|proached the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Stranger, &s;aid &s;he, di&s;gui&s;ing her voice, you have killed your companion.&mdash;What could in|duce you to &s;o horrid an action?</P>
<P>The&s;e few words were all &s;he could utter, and &s;eating her&s;elf on a &s;tone, &s;he concealed her face with her hand.</P>
<P>Alcade, replied Don Pedro, I have committed no crime; it was an act of ju&s;tice; but I beg for

death. Death alone can end the continual mi&s;|eries of which the wretch I have &s;acrificed to my revenge was the fir&s;t cau&s;e Condemn me, I wi&s;h, not to make a defence. Deliver me from a life which is hateful to me, &s;ince I have lo&s;t what alone could render it delightful; &s;ince I can no, longer hope to find&mdash;</P>
<P>He was unable to conclude, and his voice faintly expre&s;&s;ed the name of Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>Cele&s;tina trembled on hearing him pronounce her name. She could &s;carcely conceal her tran&s;|ports, but was ready to ri&s;e and throw her&s;elf into the arms of her lover. The pre&s;ence, however, of &s;o many witne&s;&s;es, re&s;trained her. She there|fore turned away her eyes, and faintly reque&s;ted to be left alone with the pri&s;oner; &s;he was obeyed.</P>
<P>Giving a free cour&s;e to her tears, &s;he advanced towards Don Pedro, and, offering him her hand, &s;aid to him, in a mo&s;t affectionate tone, Do you then &s;till love her who lives for you alone?</P>
<P>At the&s;e words, at this voice, Pedro lifts his head, unable to believe his eyes. Oh, heaven! is it&mdash;is it my Cele&s;tina! or is it &s;ome angelic being a&s;&s;uming her form? Yes, it is &s;he. I can no longer doubt it, cried he, cla&s;ping her in his arms, and bathing her with his tears. It is my love, my life, and all my woes are ended.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="031735_0208_0FF0987328BF2318">
No, &s;aid Cele&s;tina, as &s;oon as &s;he could recover &s;peech, you are guilty of blood&s;hed, and I cannot free you from your fetters; but I will repair to|morrow to the &s;uperior judge, will inform him of the &s;ecret of my birth, relate to him our misfor|tunes, and, if he refu&s;es me your liberty, I will return and end my days with you in this pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Marcelio immediately gave orders for the re|moval of Pedro from the &s;ubterraneous dun|geon, to a le&s;s hideous place of &s;ecurity; took care that he &s;hould want for nothing, and after|wards returned home to prepare for his journey, the next day, when a mo&s;t alarming event pre|vented his departure, and ha&s;tened the delivery of Don Pedro.</P>
<P>Some Algerine galleys, which had for &s;everal days pur&s;ued the &s;hip on board of which Don Pe|dro was, arrived on the coa&s;t &s;ome time after the &s;hipwreck; and willing to repay them&s;elves for the trouble they had taken, had determined to land during the night. Two renegadoes who knew the country, undertook to conduct the bar|barians to the village of Gadara, and fulfiled their promi&s;e but too well.</P>
<P>About one in the morning, when labour en|joys repo&s;e, and villainy wakes to remor&s;e, the dreadful cry of <HI>to arms,</HI> was heard.</P>
<P>The Moors had landed, and were burning and &s;laughtering all before them. The darkne&s;s of
<PB N="210" REF="031735_0209_0FF097547595B278">
the night, the groans of the dying, and the &s;hrieks of the terrified inhabitants, filled every heart with con&s;ternation. The trembling wives caught their hu&s;bands in their arms; and the old men &s;ought &s;uccour from their &s;ons. In a moment the village was in flames, the light of which di&s;|covered the gory &s;cymitars and white turbans of the Moors.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e barbarians, the flambeau in one hand and the hatchet in the other, were breaking and burning the doors of the hou&s;es; and making their way through the &s;moaking ruins, to &s;eek for victims or for plunder, returned covered with blood, and loaded with booty.</P>
<P>Nothing is held &s;acred by tho&s;e mon&s;ters. They force their way into the temples of the Mo&s;t High, break the &s;hrines, &s;trip off the gold, and trample the holy relics under foot. Alas! what avail to prie&s;ts their &s;acred character, to the aged their grey hairs, to youth its graces, or to infancy its innocence? Slavery, fire, deva&s;tation, and death, are every where, and pity is fled.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t alarm and tumult the alcade made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to the pri&s;on to inform Don Pedro of the danger. The brave Pedro demand|ed a &s;word for him&s;elf and a buckler for the al|cade. He takes Cele&s;tina by the hand, and makes his way to the market place. There he addre&s;|es the fugitives.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="031735_0210_0FF0987546906798">
My friends, cries he, are ye Spaniards, and do ye fly and abandon your wives and children to the fury of the infidels?</P>
<P>He &s;tops them, collects them round him, in|&s;pires them with his own valour, and, more than human, for he is a lover and a hero, ru&s;hes, &s;a|bre in hand, on a party of the Moors, whom he breaks and di&s;per&s;es. The inhabitants recover their recollection and their courage, and enraged behold their &s;laughtered friends, and ha&s;ten in crowds to join their leader.</P>
<P>Pedro, without quitting Cele&s;tina, and ever &s;olicitous to expo&s;e his life in her defence, attacks the barbarians, at the head of the brave Spaniards, and, dealing de&s;truction to all who make re&s;i&s;t|ance, drive the fugitives before him, retakes the plunder and the pri&s;oners, and only quits the pur|&s;uit of the enemy to return and extingui&s;h the fires.</P>
<P>The day began to break, when a body of troops, who had too late received information of the de&s;cent of the infidels, arrived from a neigh|bouring town. The governor had put him&s;elf at their head, and found Don Pedro &s;urrounded by women, children and old men; who, weeping, ki&s;&s;ed his hands, with unfeigned gratitude for having pre&s;erved their hu&s;bands, their fathers, or their &s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="031735_0211_0FF09876DF448828">
The governor, informed of the exploits of Don Pedro, loaded him with prai&s;es and care&s;&s;|es; but Cele&s;tina, reque&s;ting to be heard, de|clared to the governor, in pre&s;ence of the whole village, her &s;ex; giving, at the &s;ame time, a re|lation of her adventures, the death of the brave by Don Pedro, and the circum&s;tances which ren|dered him excu&s;eable.</P>
<P>All the inhabitants, greatly affected with her &s;tory, felt at the feet of the governor, intreating pardon for the man to whom they were indebted for their pre&s;ervation. The reque&s;t was grant|ed, and the happy Pedro, thus re&s;tored to his dear Cele&s;tina, embraced the governor, and ble&s;&s;ed the good inhabitants. One of the old men then advanced. Brave &s;tranger, &s;aid he, you are our deliverer, but you take from us our alcade; this lo&s;s, perhaps, outweighs your bene|fit. Double our ble&s;&s;ings, in&s;tead of depriving us of our greate&s;t; remain in this village; con|de&s;cend to become our alcade, our ma&s;ter, our friend. Honour us &s;o far as to permit nothing to abate our love for you. In a great city, the cowardly and wicked who maintain the &s;ame rank with your&s;elf, will think them&s;elves your equals; while here, every virtuous inhabitant will look on you as his father; next to the Deity him&s;elf, you will receive from us the highe&s;t honour; and, while life remains, on the anniver&s;ary of

this day, the fathers of our families will pre&s;ent their children before you, &s;aying, behold the man who pre&s;erved the lives of your mothers.</P>
<P>Pedro was enchanted while he li&s;tened to the old man. Yes, cried he, my children; yes my brethren, I will remain here. My life &s;hall be de|voted to Cele&s;tina, and to you. But my wife has con&s;iderable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in Granada. Our excel|lent governor will add his intere&s;t to ours, that we may recover them, and they &s;hall be employed to rebuild the hou&s;es which have been burnt by the infidels. On this condition alone will I accept the office of alcade; and though I &s;hould expend in your &s;ervice, both my riches and my life, I &s;hould &s;till, be your debtor; for it is you who have re|&s;tored me my Cele&s;tina.</P>
<P>Imagine the tran&s;ports of the good villagers, while Don Pedro &s;poke. The governor was a per&s;on of great power, and undertook to arrange every thing to his wi&s;h; and two days afterwards the marriage was celebrated between Cele&s;tina, and her lover.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the late misfortunes nothing could exceed the joy of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The two lovers long lived in unexampled feli|city; and, happy and virtuous them&s;elves, made the whole di&s;trict happy and virtuous likewi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF EDWARD DRINKER.</HEAD>
<P>EDWARD Drinker was born on the 24th of December, 1680, in a &s;mall cabin near the pre&s;ent corner of Walnut and Second &s;treets in the city of Philadelphia. His parents came from a place called Beverly, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay. The banks of the Delaware, on which the city of Philadelphia now &s;tands, were inhabited at the time of his birth by Indians, and a few Swedes and Hollanders. He often talked to his compan|ions of picking wortleberries, and catching rab|bits, on &s;pots now the mo&s;t populous and impro|ved of the city. He recollected the &s;econd time William Penn came to Penn&s;ylvania, and u&s;ed to point to the place where the cabin &s;tood, in which he and his friends that accompanied him were ac|commodated upon their arrival. At twelve years of age he went to Bo&s;ton, where he &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip to a cabinet maker. In the year 1745, he returned to Philadelphia with his fam|ily, where he lived till the time of his death. He was four times married, and had eighteen chil|dren, all of whom were by his fir&s;t wife. At one time of his life he &s;at down at his own table with fourteen children. Not long before his death, he heard of the birth of a grandchild to one of his grandchildren, the fifth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="031735_0214_0FF0987AFAF5B448">
He retained all his faculties till the la&s;t years of his life; even his memory, &s;o early and &s;o generally dimini&s;hed by age, was but little im|paired. He not only remembered the incidents of his childhood or youth, but the events of later years; and &s;o faithful was his memory to him, that his &s;on informed me that he never heard him tell the &s;ame &s;tory twice, but to different per&s;ons, and in different companies. His eye &s;ight failed him many years before his death, but his hear|ing was uniformly perfect and unimpaired. His appetite was good till within a few weeks before his death. He generally ate a hearty breakfa&s;t of a pint of tea or coffee, as &s;oon as he got out of his bed, with bread and butter in proportion. He ate likewi&s;e at eleven o'clock, and never fail|ed to eat plentifully at dinner of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;olid food. He drank tea in the evening, but never ate any &s;upper. He had lo&s;t all his teeth 30 years before his death (his &s;on &s;ays by drawing ex|ce&s;&s;ive hot &s;moke of tobacco into his mouth) but the want of &s;uitable ma&s;tication of his food did not prevent its &s;peedy dige&s;tion, nor impair his health. Whether the gums, hardened by age, &s;upplied the place of his teeth in a certain degree, or whether the juices of the mouth and &s;tomach became &s;o much more acrid by time, as to per|form the office of di&s;&s;olving the food more &s;peed|ily
<PB N="216" REF="031735_0215_0FF0987C9A589930">
and more perfectly I know not; but I have often ob&s;erved, that old people are more &s;ubject to exce&s;&s;ive eating than young ones, and that they &s;uffer fewer inconveniences from it. He was in|qui&s;itive after news in the la&s;t years of his life; his education did not lead him to increa&s;e the &s;tock of his ideas in any other way. But it is a fact well worthy to be attended to, that old age, in|&s;tead of dimini&s;hing, always increa&s;es the de&s;ire of knowledge. It mu&s;t afford &s;ome con&s;olation to tho&s;e who expect to be old, to di&s;cover that the infirmities, to which the decay of nature ex|po&s;e the human body, are rendered more tolera|ble by the enjoyments that are to be derived from the appetite for &s;en&s;ual and intellectual food</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of this hi&s;tory was remarkably &s;o|ber and temperate. Neither hard labour, nor company, nor the u&s;ual afflictions of human life, nor the wa&s;tes of nature, ever led him to an im|proper or exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of &s;trong drink. For the la&s;t 25 years of his life he drank twice every day a draught of toddy, made with two table &s;poon|fuls of &s;pirit, in half a pint of water. His &s;on, a man of fifty-nine years of age, told me he had never &s;een him intoxicated The time and man|ner in which he u&s;ed &s;pirituous liquors, I believe, contributed to lighten the weight of his years, and probably to prolong his life. "Give wine to him that is of a heavy heart, and &s;trong drink
<PB N="217" REF="031735_0216_0FF0975C12594FB8">
to him that is ready to peri&s;h" [with age as well as with &s;ickne&s;s.] "Let him drink and forget his &s;orrow, and remember his mi&s;ery no more."</P>
<P>He enjoyed an uncommon &s;hare of health, in|&s;omuch that in the cour&s;e of his long life he was never confined more than three days to his bed.</P>
<P>He often declared that he had no idea of that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing pain called the head-ach. His &s;leep was interrupted a little in the la&s;t years of his life, with a defluxion in his brea&s;t, which pro|duced what is commonly called the old man's cough.</P>
<P>The character of this aged citizen was not &s;ummed up in his negative quality of temper|ance; he was a man of a mo&s;t amiable temper; old age had not curdled his blood; he was uni|formly cheerful and kind to every body; his religious principles were as &s;teady as his morals were pure; he attended public wor&s;hip above thirty years, in the Rev. Dr. Sproat's church, and died in a full a&s;&s;urance of a happy immor|tality. The life of this man is marked with &s;ev|eral circum&s;tances which perhaps have &s;eldom occurred in the life of an individual; he &s;aw and heard more of tho&s;e events which are mea|&s;ured by time, than have ever been &s;een or heard by any man &s;ince the age of the patriarchs; he &s;aw the &s;ame &s;pot of earth in the cour&s;e of his life covered with wood and bu&s;hes, and the re|ceptacle

of bea&s;ts and birds of prey, afterwards become the &s;eat of a city, not only the fir&s;t in wealth and arts in the new, but rivalling in both many of the fir&s;t cities in the old world. He &s;aw regular &s;treets, where he once pur&s;ued a hare; he &s;aw churches ri&s;ing upon mora&s;&s;es where he had often heard the croaking of frogs; he &s;aw wharfs and warehou&s;es where he had often &s;een Indian &s;avages draw fi&s;h from the river for their daily &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and he &s;aw &s;hips of every &s;ize and u&s;e in tho&s;e &s;treams where he had been u&s;ed to &s;ee nothing but Indian canoes; he &s;aw a &s;tately edifice filled with legi&s;lators, a&s;toni&s;hing the world with their wi&s;dom and virtue, on the &s;ame &s;pot probably where he had &s;een an Indian council; he &s;aw the fir&s;t treaty ratified between the newly confederated powers of America, and the ancient monarchy of France, with all the for|malities of parchment and &s;eals, on the &s;ame &s;pot probably where he once &s;aw William Penn ratify his fir&s;t and la&s;t treaty with the Indians, without the formalities of pen, ink, or paper; he &s;aw all the intermediate &s;tages through which a people pa&s;s from the mo&s;t &s;imple to the mo&s;t complica|ted degrees of civilization; he &s;aw the begin|ning and the end of the empire of Great-Britain in Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>He had been the &s;ubject of &s;even crowned herds, and afterwards died a citizen of the newly

The number of his &s;overeigns, and his long habits of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to them, did not extingui&s;h the love of liberty, which is natural to the mind of man in its healthy &s;tate. He embraced the liberties and independ|ence of America in his withered arms, and tri|umphed in the la&s;t years of his life in the &s;alva|tion of his country. He died Nov. 17, 1782; aged 103.</P>

<P>MR. C&mdash;, a&s;&s;uming the name of Jones, &s;ome years &s;ince, purcha&s;ed a &s;mall piece of land, and built on it a neat hou&s;e on the edge of a common in Wilt&s;hire. Here he long re&s;id|ed, unknowing, and almo&s;t unknown, by the neighbourhood Various conjectures were form|ed re&s;pecting this &s;olitary and &s;ingular &s;tranger; at length a clergyman took &s;ome notice of him, and occa&s;ionally inviting him to his hou&s;e, he found him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of intelligence and manners, which evidently indicated his origin to have been in the higher &s;tations of life. Returning one day from a vi&s;it at this clergyman's, he pa&s;&s;ed the

hou&s;e of a farmer, at the door of which was the daughter employed at the wa&s;hing-tub. He looked at the girl a moment, and thus acco&s;ted her&mdash;My girl, would you like to be married?" "Sir!" exclaimed the girl&mdash;"I a&s;ked you, young woman, whether you would wi&s;h to be married: becau&s;e if you would, I will marry you." "Lord, Sir! the&s;e are &s;trange que&s;tions from a man I never &s;aw in my life before." "Very likely," replied Mr. Jones; "but how|ever, I am &s;erious, and will leave you till ten o'clock to-morrow to con&s;ider of it; I will then call on you again, and if I have your and your father's con&s;ent, we will be married the follow|ing day."</P>
<P>He kept his appointment, and meeting with the father, he thus addre&s;&s;ed him: "Sir, I have &s;een your daughter; I &s;hould like her for a wife: and I am come to a&s;k your con&s;ent." "This propo&s;al," an&s;wered the old man, "is very extraordinary from a &s;tranger: Pray, &s;ir, who are you? and what are you?" "Sir," replied Mr. J.

Mr. J. employed great part of his time in improving his wife's mind, but never di&s;clo&s;ed his own origin. At length, upon taking a journey of plea&s;ure with her, while remarking the beauties of the country, he noticed and named the different gentlemen's &s;eats as they pa&s;&s;ed; and coming to a very magnifi|cent one, "This, my dear," &s;aid he, "is B&mdash;hou&s;e, the &s;eat of the earl of E. and if you plea&s;e, we will go in and a&s;k leave to look at it: it is an elegant hou&s;e, and probably will amu&s;e you."</P>

<HEAD>TACITURNITY. AN APOLOGUE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Tran&s;lated from the French of Abb&eacute; Blanchet.</HEAD>
<P>AT Amadan was a celebrated academy, the fir&s;t &s;tatute of which run thus:</P>
<P><HI>The Academicans are to think much, write little, and, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;peak le&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This was called the Silent Academy, nor was there a &s;age in Per&s;ia, who was not ambitious of being admitted a member. Zeb, a famous &s;age, and author of an excellent little book, intitled <HI>The Gag,</HI> heard, in the di&s;tant provinces where he lived, there was a vacancy in the &s;ilent academy. Immediately he departed for Amadan, and, ar|riving, pre&s;ented him&s;elf at the door of the hall where the academicians were a&s;&s;embled, and &s;ent in the following billet to the pre&s;ident:</P>
<P>Zeb, a lover of &s;ilence, humbly a&s;ks the va|cant place</P>
<P>The billet arrived too late; the vacancy was already &s;upplied. The academicians were almo&s;t in de&s;pair; they had received, &s;omewhat again&s;t their inclination, a courtier, who had &s;ome wit, and who&s;e light and trifling eloquence had be|come the admiration of all his court-acquaint|ance; and this learned body was now reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of refu&s;ing the &s;age Zeb, the &s;courge of bablers, the perfection of wi&s;dom.</P>

The pre&s;ident, who&s;e duty it was to announce this di&s;agreeable news to the &s;age, &s;carcely could re&s;olve, nor knew in which manner be&s;t, to per|form his office. After a moment's reflection he ordered a flagon to be filled with water, and &s;o full that another drop would have made the water run over. He then de&s;ired them to introduce the candidate.</P>
<P>The Sage appeared, with that &s;imple and mode&s;t air which generally accompanies true merit. The pre&s;ident ro&s;e, and, without &s;peak|ing a word, pointed, with affliction in his looks, to the emblematical flagon &s;o exactly full.</P>
<P>The Sage under&s;tood from thence, the va|cancy was &s;upplied, but, without relinqui&s;hing hope, he endeavoured to make them compre|hend that a &s;upernumerary member might, per|haps, be no detriment to their &s;ociety.

<HEAD>THE PERFIDIOUS FRIEND. A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>ABASE act perpetrated under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, excites double abhorrence, and the injury inflicted is, from the hypocri&s;y by which it is accompanied, much more injurious and dete&s;t|able.</P>
<P>John Stephens and Charles Murray had been brought up at the &s;ame &s;chool when boys, and, though not preci&s;ely of the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, be|came in&s;eparable companions. Stephens was cunning, pa&s;&s;ionate, and &s;omewhat &s;elfi&s;h; while Murray was un&s;u&s;picious, mild, and generous.</P>
<P>Connections early contracted, often endure through life, in de&s;pite of every forbidden circum|&s;tance; and thus the intimacy and friend&s;hip be|tween Stephens and Murray continued till they had both entered on the bu&s;y &s;tage of the world; though the difference of their characters, and with it that of their circum&s;tances and &s;ituation, increa&s;ed every day. Stephens grew rich, while Murray continued in that humble mediocrity in which he had been originally born.</P>
<P>The familiar intercour&s;e however, that had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them, &s;till continued; though Stephens would occa&s;ionally give him&s;elf airs of &s;uperiority, which the mild temper of
<PB N="226" REF="031735_0225_0FF0988B73A3D558">
Murray induced him to overlook, and nothing occurred to interrupt their friend&s;hip and good under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>At length Murray married an elegant woman of &s;mall fortune, and went to re&s;ide in a com|modious, but not &s;uperb hou&s;e, on an e&s;tate which the wealth of Stephens had enabled him to pur|cha&s;e. Here he enjoyed the real happine&s;s of life without the fatiguing o&s;tentation of luxury, and felt that he could not have purcha&s;ed more with all the riches of his affluent neighbour.</P>
<P>But Stephens had &s;urveyed Mrs. Murray with a pa&s;&s;ion which he would perhaps have called love; he was therefore more attentive than ever to his friend, more a&s;&s;iduous in his &s;ervices, and more frequent in his vi&s;its than ever he had been.</P>
<P>As he gained nothing, however, by what he con&s;idered as fair means, determined at length to employ others which he tru&s;ted he &s;hould find more effectual, and therefore planned an artful and diabolical &s;cheme to carry off Mrs. Murray by the means of hired bravoes, and &s;atisfy his brutality in di&s;gui&s;e, &s;o that &s;he &s;hould never know by whom &s;he had been injured. Accord|ingly, one morning, when Mr. Murray was out, the villains who had watched their opportunity for the purpo&s;e, forced into the hou&s;e, and finding her dre&s;&s;ing, attempted to carry her off half na|ked, but being met by her hu&s;band at a &s;mall di&s;|tance
<PB N="227" REF="031735_0226_0FF0988D1E968160">
from the hou&s;e, they &s;everely wounded, and left him for dead, and would effectually have &s;ecured their prize, had not they &s;uppo&s;ed they heard the noi&s;e of &s;ome per&s;ons on hor&s;eback, which, &s;triking them with a kind of panic ter|ror, they fled precipitately without accompli&s;hing their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;s of this unhappy woman may be better imagined than de&s;cribed. Mr. Murray, however, after langui&s;hing long, recovered from his wounds. Mr. Stephens, of whom no &s;u&s;|picion was entertained, &s;till continued his appar|ent friend&s;hip and his vi&s;its; he &s;eemed to feel the greate&s;t concern for the &s;ufferings of his wounded friend, and profe&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s to do every thing in his power for his recovery and relief.</P>
<P>Not long after, it happened that Mr. Murray (being now nearly well of his wound) walked out in the evening with his friend Stephens, when they were a&s;&s;aulted by two footpads, who ru&s;hed &s;uddenly on them from behind a hedge, but Mr. Stephens being a re&s;olute man, knocked down one of them, and the other ran away. They &s;e|cured their pri&s;oner, and took him to a cottage at a &s;mall di&s;tance, when Mr. Murray im|mediately recognized him to be the very man who had wounded him in the attempt to cary off his wife; the fellow likewi&s;e knew his employer
<PB N="228" REF="031735_0227_0FF0976B6DE89810">
Stephens, who was &s;o &s;truck with confu&s;ion at this incident, that he immediately confe&s;&s;ed the whole of his villainous plot, and hypocritical conduct; forcing him at the &s;ame time to accept of the hou&s;e in which he lived, and a large piece of land near it, as a &s;light recompence for the in|jury he had intended to do him; after which he &s;old his e&s;tate in that place, and went to re&s;ide in a di&s;tant part of the kingdom, where no per&s;on had ever heard of the ba&s;e act of which he had been guilty.</P>

<HEAD>THE DANGER OF A KISS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing &s;o dangerous to a young woman, as &s;uffering a man &s;he does not di&s;like, to approach her lips; which too often, when mo&s;t &s;ilent, betray the feelings and the dic|tates of the inmo&s;t &s;oul. This caution is not pe|culiarly confined to the maiden, but equally ex|tends to the wife. And &s;o &s;en&s;ible were the wi&s;|e&s;t and greate&s;t Romans of the danger of this indelicacy, that Manilius was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from the li&s;t of &s;enators, for daring to &s;alute his wife in the pre&s;ence of his daughters.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="031735_0228_0FF0988F5692CF00">
It is not that there is any immediate criminal|ity in a mere ki&s;s; but it is a freedom which, when allowed, leads to greater familiarities. It is an introduction to &s;omething more capital; it is the fir&s;t page of the preface to &s;eduction and a|dultery. If a married woman would reflect up|on the dignity and honour of her condition, &s;he would be as cautious of yielding a ki&s;s to a &s;tran|ger (for all men &s;hould be &s;trangers but the hu&s;|band to her lips) as yielding her virtue; for the woman who &s;uffers any kind of dalliance from a man, reduces her con&s;equence, and gives crude &s;u&s;picions to the world of her character. Wo|men may be chearful and gay, without giving their hands and mouths to te&s;tify their good na|ture and ea&s;e. It is the &s;ame with the virgin. If &s;he &s;uffers her&s;elf to be pulled about and toyed with, and ki&s;&s;ed, &s;he would find tho&s;e very gal|lants the foremo&s;t to blow up her fame. It is an idle frippery cu&s;tom and practi&s;ed by no people publickly, but the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>If ladies would in general attentively attend to this ob&s;ervation, we &s;hould &s;ee fewer unhappy marriages; for I am confident, that the woman who returns a ki&s;s, means to give a &s;ilent a&s;&s;ent to the man's de&s;ires. It is a circum&s;tance which rarely fails, when the man is ungenerous enough to pur&s;ue the encouragement.</P>

<HEAD>TREACHEROUS GUARDIAN.</HEAD>
<P>SOMEWHERE in the great wilderne&s;s of <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> in an ob&s;cure hole, dwells an old, over-grown <HI>he-&s;erpent,</HI> whom men call <HI>Viperly,</HI> in every part re&s;embling man; but his internals &s;eem the true copy of his ance&s;tor, fir&s;t &s;een in the garden of Eden; many a widow and or|phan he had devoured, who&s;e &s;hadows are &s;till walking up and down the &s;treets of a famous city; yet this much I mu&s;t needs &s;ay for him, he never meddled with the poor, unle&s;s it were to thru&s;t him from his gate. This creature had once a friend named <HI>Kindman,</HI> a per&s;on of &s;ome wealth, but richer far in his only child <HI>Con&s;tantia,</HI> whom with all his e&s;tate he left to the guardian|&s;hip and tru&s;t of his friend; and, dying, be|queathed al&s;o to his care young <HI>Heartly,</HI> his deare&s;t friend's &s;on, to whom Kindly was guard|ian; with a po&s;itive injunction that he &s;hould marry his daughter when &s;he came to the age of &s;ixteen. Heartly was about that age when Kind|man died, and had a hand&s;ome e&s;tate left him by his father's will, which he was to po&s;&s;e&s;s at tweenty-one. Con&s;tantia, wholly left to Viper|ly's care, was educated from eight years old till fourteen, at a boarding &s;chool, where &s;he had the good fortune to be in&s;tructed in the princi|ples
<PB N="233" REF="031735_0232_0FF097705B92D680">
of true virtue, which her own natural incli|nation improved to a miracle, nor was &s;he le&s;s a proficient in all her other ornamental exerci&s;es. Add to the&s;e the beauty of her per&s;on, which was as extraordinary as tho&s;e of her mind, and you may believe &s;he might ble&s;s any mortal man in a marriage with her. Heartly in the mean time led an academic life about four years, and then made a trip into foreign countries for another twelvemonth, whence he returned at age to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his e&s;tate. He &s;oon went to vi&s;it Con&s;tantia, at the boarding &s;chool, and the oft|ener he vi&s;ited her the more de&s;irable he found her. 'Tis true, at fir&s;t he loved her very well in her infancy, as it were; but the thoughts of being in a manner confined to marry her, made him le&s;s eager of the proffered happine&s;s: yet &s;he always pa&s;&s;ionately loved him, at lea&s;t with as much pa&s;&s;ion as her tender years were capa|ble of, though &s;he knew he was de&s;igned for her lord and ma&s;ter. In &s;hort they loved each other perfectly. Heartly therefore made it his reque&s;t to Viperly, that he would plea&s;e to remove her from the &s;chool to his own hou&s;e, which did not in the lea&s;t di&s;plea&s;e him. To Viperly then &s;he was brought, where, for her &s;ake, Hartly took lodgings and lived with her in a pure &s;tate of in|nocence and love for about a year and a half. But mark now the in&s;tability of human affairs.</P>
<P><PB REF="031735_0233_0FF09897713C8DA0">
Heartly, when abroad, had contracted as he thought, an inviolable friend&s;hip with one <HI>Rich|more,</HI> a young gentleman of a very great e&s;tate, though much inferior to him in parts and per|&s;on. This Richmore, one day to his misfor|tune, he invites to dine with him at Viperly's, in order to &s;hew him the beautiful creature whom he was de&s;igned to marry. At the fir&s;t &s;ight of her, Richmore could hardly make her any compli|ment, or &s;o much as tell her &s;he was beautiful, becau&s;e he knew it too well. To &s;peak plainly, he fell wickedly in love with her. However, he had the grace, or rather the cunning to conceal it for about a quarter of a year; when finding that his friend's happine&s;s grew nearer and near|er every hour, and that his own pa&s;&s;ion encrea&s;ed every minute, he bethought him&s;elf of a mo&s;t damnable expedient to prevent Heartly's bli&s;s, and put an end to his own torments.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince his fir&s;t entertainment at Viperly's, he had as ea&s;y an acce&s;s to the lady, as Heartly him&s;elf, though in Heartly's ab&s;ence; but now his bu&s;ine&s;s was not &s;o immediately directed to her. He came now to tempt the <HI>&s;erpent,</HI> whom he luckily found at home; and after &s;ome compliments enticed from his hole to the tavern, where he began to tell him, that it was in his power to damn or ble&s;s him; and that if he would endeavour the la&s;t, he
<PB N="235" REF="031735_0234_0FF0989971A021D0">
would give him two thou&s;and pounds. The old one you may imagine, would not ea&s;ily let go &s;o fair a proffer; however, he told him, that if there were any thing wherein he might do him ea&s;e, and his own con&s;cience no hurt, he might com|mand him, without any reward. Said Richmore then, 'tis only to break off the de&s;igned marriage between Heartly and Con&s;tantia, for I cannot live without her. Here are two propo&s;itions in one, interrupted Viperly, their marriage mu&s;t be broken off, and you enjoy her. Right, replied Richmore, but if the la&s;t be done, 'tother will fall of cour&s;e; perform but this, and the money is yours the next hour.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the villainous mi&s;er promi&s;ed to effect it: accordingly, with &s;ome &s;hew of rea&s;on, he &s;oon after per&s;uaded Heartly to go near an hund|red miles from the town to look after &s;ome part of his e&s;tate, making it &s;o &s;eemingly nece&s;&s;ary, that the young gentleman was forced by his in|tere&s;t, to leave the town in le&s;s than ten days time. And yet not before he had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve the great intimacy and friend&s;hip &s;o lately contract|ed between the old and young gentleman. Where|fore, fearing the wor&s;t, he taught Con&s;tantia to arm her&s;elf again&s;t all misfortunes, by an expedi|ent that is not frequently practi&s;ed, becau&s;e there are but few young lovers about this town that know how to write a quite contrary thought with
<PB N="236" REF="031735_0235_0FF097752E1DEC68">
a black ink, in a manner, on the &s;ame lines on which they had written their true meaning in a white liquid matter, which will appear, the black being obliterated by wa&s;hing the paper with a third water or mixture.</P>
<P>When Viperly-thought that Heartly was far enough from him, not to &s;ee and hear his devil|&s;hip's de&s;igns, he brought Richmore one night with him, and was plea&s;ed to be very &s;eemingly drunk; or, perhaps, he was really &s;omething near it: and then took the liberty to tell Con|&s;tantia, that he had provided a better hu&s;band for her than her father's de&s;cription of her fortune could give her rea&s;on to hope. The lady was mode&s;tly plea&s;ed to an&s;wer, that &s;he did truly be|lieve &s;uch a per&s;on as Richmore, was infinitely beyond the merits of her per&s;on or fortune. Richmore replied, by the way of compliment, well enough for a &s;park of his e&s;tate; which he thought, without the help of words, might be &s;uf|ficient to an&s;wer the lady's expectation; and, to &s;ay truth, he made a very good figure, which no doubt he was de&s;irous to copy. Of this he made her partly &s;en&s;ible that very night; thence &s;he began to be as apprehen&s;ive of danger from the young man's love, as &s;he was from the old man's avarice: for within a very few days after, Viper|ly let her know, that it was his determinate plea|&s;ure &s;he &s;hould marry Richmore, unle&s;s &s;he would
<PB N="237" REF="031735_0236_0FF0989C64EA0708">
make Heartly happy without a groat to her por|tion; which we may imagine, was none of the mo&s;t obliging di&s;cour&s;es that &s;he had ever been entertained with. However, the di&s;cour&s;e was not all; for he gave Richmore &s;uch villainous opportunities, that none but a virtue like her's could have fru&s;trated his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>Once he was concealed in her bed-chamber till &s;he went into bed, and had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her &s;er|vant; and then all the darkne&s;s that her pre&s;|ence could &s;uffer, added &s;omething more than a confidence to his de&s;ires; which yet, I am apt to think, had been lawful, were it not for her pre|engagement to his friend: but this wicked op|portunity was his &s;ini&s;ter friend, and at that fir&s;t time he took his la&s;t leave of tho&s;e lips which would have cur&s;ed him had they been taught; at lea&s;t they happily deceived him, when &s;he beg|ged of him not to take the advantage of the night, &s;ince &s;he would willingly meet his love in a lawful honourable bed; but &s;he was confident, &s;he ad|ded, this could be the contrivance of none but Viperly, or the devil. And continued &s;he, that you may be a&s;&s;ured of my truth in this matter, procure a light, and I will immediately write to Mr. Heartly all the mo&s;t di&s;obliging things that you your&s;elf &s;hall de&s;ire me, and with all &s;end to him under my own hand, that I will marry you within the&s;e ten days; for if I could not love

This &s;udden thought of hers, had its de&s;ired effect upon him; &s;o tel|ling her that he would expect the performance of her promi&s;e before the next day noon he left her. Next morning when he under&s;tood he might be admitted, he came again to the cham|ber where he found her writing the&s;e words to Heartly, upon a &s;heet of paper on which &s;he had before written in white ink, a ha&s;ty &s;ummons to him to come to her re&s;cue.</P>

<P>The day came, and Heartly had walked in that place from half an hour pa&s;t one, till the hour appointed, when he &s;aw Con&s;tantia led by Richmore. Upon the fir&s;t &s;ight of Heartly, &s;he forced her hand from the other, and gave it to him. Richmore, &s;aid he, I mu&s;t &s;ee you to night at the tavern over the way, if thou can&s;t, without this lady, the hour is &s;even; till then farewell. Saying &s;o, he walked off with her, and put her into a coach, which carried them to the hou&s;e of a friend of his not far off. At &s;even he met Richmore, of whom he de&s;igned to have taken &s;atisfaction, for the injuries he had done him in his ab&s;ence: but Richmore, who was con&s;cious of his guilt, and had really a friend&s;hip for him, which renewed at his &s;ight, told him, that po&s;&s;ibly he would give him better

&s;atisfaction than he could expect from him. At that word, in&s;tead of drawing his &s;word, he drew the writings delivered to him by old Viperly, which concerned all Con&s;tantia's e&s;tate, and with &s;ome confu&s;ion begged his pardon, charging his infidelity on the exce&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion; and now, continued he, I thank heaven, you have returned time enough to pre&s;erve both my friend&s;hip and honour, though I have lo&s;t a mi&s;tre&s;s by it. Within a few days after, Heartly and Con&s;tantia married, as you may well think, without &s;o much as ever calling old Viperly to the wedding, though not long after they called him to an ac|count concerning both their e&s;tates, which they obliged him to make good to them to the utmo&s;t farthing.</P>

<P>Lucinda Harvey was a young lady of a mo&s;t amiable per&s;on, and a truly generous and &s;u&s;cep|tible heart.

The child, however, by its beauty, and helple&s;s &s;ituation, won &s;o much on the feel|ing heart of the tender Lucinda, that &s;he per&s;uad|ed her mother not to re&s;ign it to the rigours of a pari&s;h maintenance; but let it be brought up with them, as if it were her &s;i&s;ter. "It can re|quire but little," &s;aid &s;he, "and who can &s;ay how amply providence may repay us." The infant had hanging round its neck, when it was found, the miniature portrait of a gentleman, with the air and countenance of which Lucinda felt her&s;elf much impre&s;&s;ed, and frequently noticed to her mother the elegance of the figure, and how ably the painter had di&s;played his art.</P>
<P>As the child grew up, her beauty became every day more apparent; and it was manife&s;t that the &s;trength of her under&s;tanding, and the goodne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, and genero&s;ity of her di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t, in her riper years, give additional force and lu&s;|tre to the charms of her per&s;on.</P>
<P>But in the world in which we live, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;o good, &s;o generous a deed, &s;hould entirely e&s;cape the in&s;inuations of the mean, or the cen&s;ures of the malignant. The tea table tattlers, mi&s;s Vapid, mi&s;s Re&s;tle&s;s, mi&s;s Prattle, and mi&s;s Sneer, met on the occa&s;ion, and
<PB N="243" REF="031735_0242_0FF09791F3AC1E70">
decreed, <HI>nem. con.</HI> that there was &s;omething pro|digiou&s;ly dark and &s;u&s;picious in the tran&s;ac|tion; that it was mon&s;trou&s;ly incredible that any young lady &s;hould maintain a child from mere good nature, tenderne&s;s, or genero&s;ity; and on breaking up of their convention, immortal, &s;can|dals &s;tretched their eagle wings, and it &s;oon be|came the firm, un&s;haken creed of the fa&s;hionable go&s;&s;ips of the village, that Lucinda had deigned to lie privately in, and that the child &s;he protected and cheri&s;hed was no other than her own.</P>
<P>As Lucinda's per&s;onal and mental accompli&s;h|ments had given much &s;ecret offence to many of her female acquaintances, the de&s;truction of her character became a delicious treat to them, and more than one gentleman of fortune, who was on the point of making honourable and advantage|ous propo&s;als to Lucinda, were deterred from it by the&s;e buzzing &s;landers. Still, however, &s;he remained firm; &s;he &s;till treated the child as her &s;i&s;ter or daughter; deigned to give no an&s;wer to the ba&s;e in&s;inuations of little minds; nor would &s;he as her mother wi&s;hed, con&s;ent to leave the place where &s;uch ba&s;e reports had been circulated.</P>
<P>In the mean time, ten long years had rolled away, and Lucinda had not even received any &s;e|rious offers of marriage; and as &s;he was now eight and twenty, though her charms yet &s;hone in all their lu&s;tre, her envious rivals enjoyed their
<PB N="244" REF="031735_0243_0FF0977DEF4C2398">
triumph, and began to hope the time approach|ing, when they might confer on her the title of Old Maid.</P>
<P>About this time it chanced that a Mr. Horton, a gentleman who had gone out to India &s;ome years before, and rapidly made a fortune, returning home to enjoy the fruits of his good &s;ucce&s;s in his native country, purcha&s;ed a hou&s;e and e&s;tate in the neighbourhood of the village in which Lu|cinda and her mother re&s;ided. He met with Lu|cinda at the a&s;&s;embly, and being plea&s;ed with her conver&s;ation, made &s;everal vi&s;its to her and her mother. Lucinda had remarked, the fir&s;t time &s;he &s;aw him, the &s;trong re&s;emblance there was between his features and tho&s;e of the portrait &s;he had found on the de&s;erted Laura, for by that name &s;he had called the child &s;he had found and pro|tected: and this re&s;emblance excited in her brea&s;t a kind of e&s;teem for him, before &s;he became acquainted with the good qualities of his heart and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>But the &s;candalous reports that had been &s;o long circulated to the di&s;credit of Lucinda, were &s;oon indu&s;triou&s;ly tran&s;mitted to Mr. Horton's ear; the con&s;equence of which was, that his vi|&s;its became much le&s;s frequent, and his behaviour to that lady &s;en&s;ibly different from what it had hitherto been.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="031735_0244_0FF098A4AB684E00">
Lucinda, now, for the fir&s;t time, felt that the venomed &s;hafts of &s;lander could reach her, and de&s;troy her peace: though Mr. Horton had too much politene&s;s to give even the &s;lighte&s;t hint of the cau&s;e of alteration in his behaviour towards her, &s;he ea&s;ily conceived from what &s;ource it aro&s;e, and the fir&s;t opportunity that pre&s;ented, related to him with equal candour and emotion, the &s;tory of finding the child, and the &s;ub&s;equent at|tacks made on her character by malicious &s;candal. This &s;he declared, and declared with truth, was the fir&s;t time &s;he had felt any pain from the&s;e in|&s;inuations, and the fir&s;t time &s;he had ever at|tempted to defend her&s;elf, and &s;he had only done it now becau&s;e &s;he could not bear to lo&s;e the e&s;|teem of a gentleman, of who&s;e good &s;en&s;e and genero&s;ity &s;he had too high an opinion, to ima|gine he would li&s;ten for a moment to &s;uch fal&s;e and malicious &s;ugge&s;tions, when he had heard the truth. She ended by &s;howing him the picture &s;he had found with the child.</P>
<P>Mr. Horton viewed the picture with equal &s;ur|pri&s;e and emotion; he in&s;tantly knew it for his own portrait, and the child for his own daughter. "Madam," &s;aid he, "your innocence is appar|ent indeed; &s;uffer me to confe&s;s my folly and my fault. This picture is my portrait; it has marks on it which preclude all doubt, and your Laura is my daughter. Before I went to India, I had a

connection (not greatly to my honour) with a woman of mean character, by whom I had this child. I left her with what money I could &s;pare, and made &s;everal remittances, but could never learn what became of her. Since my return I have made every enquiry, but have only been able to learn that &s;oon after I left her, &s;he went to live with &s;ome fellow of a character &s;imilar to her own, and has not been heard of &s;ince. It is probable they abandoned the child as an embar|ra&s;&s;ment. Your tenderne&s;s and generous kind|ne&s;s have pre&s;erved it! and if I am &s;o fortunate as to be agreeable to you, my hand, my fortune, and my heart, &s;hall be your's."</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time after, Lucinda was married to Mr. Horton, and, triumphing over every &s;canda|lous &s;ugge&s;tion, became, by law, the mother of her adopted child.</P>

<HEAD>A SINGULAR STORY OF MR. STANLEY.</HEAD>
<P>CAPTAIN James Stanley, who had been an officer in the king's army, during the civil wars which began in the year 164<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, and had lo&s;t by the &s;eque&s;tration &s;ucceeding them the large&s;t part of his e&s;tate, retired to &s;pend the remnant of his days on one of his farms, which he had found means to pre&s;erve in the name of a relation of the contrary party, and which was &s;eated in that part of Gloce&s;ter&s;hire which borders on the Severn.</P>
<P>He &s;urvived but a little the ruins of his cau&s;e, and dying in retirement, left his wife a young widow, with that farm for her jointure, who&s;e rent, when la&s;t lett, had been about 5001. per annum: &s;he had a &s;on under nine years of age, whom &s;he took from a &s;chool he was &s;ent to in the life-time of his father, and kept him at home, as a means to divert or alleviate her &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Robert Stanley, this &s;on, di&s;covered a genius much bent to a love of the country. He would often delight to be pre&s;ent at the plowings, the thre&s;hings, and &s;uch other bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;er|vants, and was every year diligent in picking up acorns, as they fell from &s;ome trees which grew about his mother's hou&s;e which acorns he would
<PB N="248" REF="031735_0247_0FF09781DBE58A60">
be whole days employing him&s;elf in making holes for, and planting up and down in the banks of the hedge-rows or enclo&s;ure.</P>
<P>The mother, however, was advi&s;ed, when her &s;on reached fifteen, to &s;end him to London, where the law was believed the mo&s;t hopeful employment he could follow. He was therefore recommended to the care of an attorney, with whom he lived &s;everal years; and afterwards &s;etting up for him&s;elf, mi&s;carried in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and either through fear of his mother's di&s;plea|&s;ure, or the weight of &s;ome debts he had con|tracted, procured recommendations for &s;ome &s;mall preferment abroad, and went over to Jamaica, which was then newly &s;ettled by the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>In Jamaica, from a very narrow beginning, he obtained by the &s;ucce&s;s of his indu&s;try a con&s;i|derable plantation, and lived in that i&s;land al|mo&s;t twenty years; at the end of which time he grew de&s;irous to vi&s;it England again, and there &s;ettle near his mother, who was &s;till alive and impatient to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uit of this view, he fold his plantation, and freighted a &s;hip with his effects, put him&s;elf and his family on board her, and &s;et &s;ail for Bri&s;|tol; to which he was &s;o near as the i&s;land of Scilly, by the Land's End off Cornwall, when the &s;hip by a &s;torm in the night unfortunately &s;plit upon a rock, where nothing at all of her cargo,
<PB N="249" REF="031735_0248_0FF098A847FF8BE0">
was &s;aved; and with very much difficulty &s;ome few of the pa&s;&s;engers, among whom was Mr. Stanley him&s;elf, thus re&s;tored to his country in a condition more naked and mi&s;erable than he left it.</P>
<P>He found means, however, to get &s;oon to his mother, who received him with that mixture of &s;orrow and joy which was natural to the occa|&s;ion; and when her fir&s;t emotions were over, and her pa&s;&s;ions grew calm enough to hear him at large give an account of his &s;hipwreck and the particulars of his lo&s;s by it, &s;he an&s;wered him with a &s;igh&mdash;That &s;he feared &s;ome misfortune would befal him wherever he was, becau&s;e a few days before, an unu&s;ual high wind had blown down above a hundred of tho&s;e oaks which &s;he had cheri&s;hed for his &s;ake, and which he might remember when a boy, he had planted from the acorn all about the e&s;tate; but &s;he thanked God, there were many yet left &s;tanding, which &s;he hop|ed was a good omen, that he would overcome his misfortunes.</P>
<P>A good omen indeed, cried Mr. Stanley, if in nigh thirty years growth they are &s;o large as I wi&s;h them; for but a day or two ago, in the city of Bri&s;tol, I met with a per&s;on who was pur|po&s;ely employed, and is making enquiry, with a great deal of earne&s;tne&s;s, after &s;ound, young oak timber, a great parcel of which &s;ort he is commi&s;&s;ioned to purcha&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="031735_0249_0FF0978576750A40">
The end of the &s;tory is, that upon examina|tion they found above &s;eventeen hundred &s;uch oaks as they &s;old for forty &s;hillings a-piece, with which &s;tock Mr. Stanley began a new trade, and became as con&s;iderable a merchant as any in the We&s;t; and, in memory of this fortunate acci|dent, he pre&s;erved from the axe about twenty of the trees which grew neare&s;t the hou&s;e, which trees (though the e&s;tate is now fallen to another family) are known to this day by the name of 'Save-all Remnant.'</P>
<P>This example of a gentleman pre&s;erved from &s;uch ruin, in the middle of his life, by the inno|cent and unmeaning diver&s;ion of his childhood, together with what is told us by the famous Sir Richard We&s;ton, of a merchant of his acquaint|ance, who planted with his own hands &s;o much wood that he &s;old it in his life-time for fifty thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling; the&s;e examples, we &s;ay, are &s;ufficient to excite a new vigour in our Country Gentlemen, who might ea&s;ily improve upon the hint, &s;o far as to ea&s;e their e&s;tates of a burden which often oppre&s;&s;es, and &s;ometimes de&s;troys them: we mean where a gentleman leaves many daughters, for who&s;e fortunes the e&s;tate is the fund, and &s;tands mortgaged to provide for them.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="031735_0250_0FF098AA5D25E618">
How ea&s;ily were the inconvenience prevented, if at the birth of a daughter but ten acres of land were &s;et out from the e&s;tate, and, after be|ing carefully enclo&s;ed, were well planted with timber-trees.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, for example, they were fir-trees, which are found to thrive readily in all parts of England: four thou&s;and &s;uch trees would grow twenty years together on ten acres of land without galling each other; at the end of which term they would, one with another, be worth twenty &s;hillings a-piece for &s;mall ma&s;ts for ve&s;&s;els, and many other good u&s;es; &s;o that here were (almo&s;t without lo&s;s or expence) a fortune of four thou|&s;and pounds provided for the young lady by that time &s;he grows marriageable, and her father's e&s;tate not charged with a penny towards rai&s;ing it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing being done, only charging the kind of tree, planted at every new birth of a daughter or &s;on, would effectually provide for them all as fa&s;t as they grow up, like a plow kept at work for their benefit, even they were &s;leeping; there is, we may hope, no elder bro|ther in England who will di&s;like this particular part of this e&s;&s;ay, whatever his opinion may be of the other.</P>

<HEAD>AN INTERESTING NARRATIVE.</HEAD>
<P>AT the dreadful epoch of the unfor|tunate affair of Nancy, twenty-two &s;oldiers of the regiment Chateau-Vieux were condemned to condign puni&s;hment. As the fatal proce&s;&s;ion was pa&s;&s;ing through a narrow &s;treet, one of the &s;oldiers condemned, contrived, amid&s;t the pre&s;s, to &s;lip unob&s;erved into a pa&s;&s;age, the door of which was open. It was the hou&s;e of his mi&s;|tre&s;s. Conceive her tran&s;port to find her lover in her arms, at the moment &s;he was bewailing his death.</P>
<P>One victim at the place of execution was found wanting to the number. Search was every where made for the fugitive, but in vain. It was re|newed with all the keenne&s;s, and all the &s;a|gacity of blood-hounds; but the de&s;tined ob|ject of vengeance eluded the utmo&s;t penetration and diligence of his pur&s;uers. He was all this while concealed in a corn-loft, where he had been &s;ecreted by his mi&s;tre&s;s, and where &s;he found means to nouri&s;h him for three months unknown to her parents.</P>
<P>A rich farmer of Ba&s;le, who had heard no|thing of his &s;on &s;ince the carnage of Nancy, and the horrible execution of the Swi&s;s, could no

For this purpo&s;e he undertook a journey to Nancy, but though his concern excited pity, and his enquiries intere&s;ted all to whom they were addre&s;&s;ed, there were none who could afford him the de&s;ired information. At la&s;t he learned with tran&s;port that his &s;on had e&s;caped the fate of his companions, and was di|rected by a &s;oldier to the hou&s;e of his mi&s;tre&s;s, as a place where it was probable he might obtain farther intelligence.</P>
<P>He repaired immediately to the hou&s;e, but the mi&s;tre&s;s of his &s;on pretended an entire igno|rance; and notwith&s;tanding the particulars of his family, which he mentioned in their conver&s;ation; pre&s;erved the mo&s;t cautious &s;ilence.

<HEAD>THE HILL OF LIFE. A VISION.</HEAD>
<P>A GENTLE a&s;cent led to a lofty emi|nence, and on the &s;ummit was a level plain, of no great extent. The boundaries of it could not indeed be ea&s;ily a&s;certained: for as the a&s;cent on one &s;ide was ea&s;y and gradual, &s;o the &s;lope on the other continued almo&s;t imperceptible till it terminated at once in an abrupt declivity.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t entrance of the hill I ob&s;erved great numbers of infants crawling on beds of primro&s;es, or &s;leeping on pillows formed by the mo&s;s. They frequently &s;miled, and their &s;weet countenances, &s;eemed to expre&s;s a complacency and joy in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their new exi&s;t|ence. Many indeed wept and wailed, but their &s;orrow though pungent, was &s;hort, and the &s;ight of a pretty leaf or flower would cau&s;e a &s;mile in the mid&s;t of their tears; &s;o that nothing was more common than to &s;ee two drops trickling down cheeks which were dimpled with &s;miles. I was &s;o delighted with the &s;cenes of innocence, that I felt an impul&s;e to go and play with the little tribe, when, ju&s;t as I was advancing, I felt a wand &s;trike my &s;houlder, and turning my eyes on one &s;ide, I beheld a venerable figure, with a white beard, and a grey mantle elegantly thrown round him.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="031735_0254_0FF09788DC70DE58">
My &s;on, &s;aid he, I &s;ee your curio&s;ity is rai&s;ed, and I will gratify it; but you mu&s;t not move from this place, which is the mo&s;t advantageous &s;pot for the contemplation of the &s;cene before you.</P>
<P>You hill is the Hill of Life, a pageant which I have rai&s;ed by the magic influence of this wand, to amu&s;e you with an in&s;tructive picture.</P>
<P>The beauteous innnocents whom you &s;ee at the foot of the hill, pre&s;ent you with the idea of angels and cherubs, and of &s;uch indeed is the kingdom of Heaven. Simplicity and innocence are their amiable qualities, and the more of them they retain in their a&s;cent, the happier and love|lier &s;hall they be during the whole of their jour|ney.</P>
<P>But rai&s;e your eyes a little &s;pace. You &s;ee a lively train intent to learn, under the &s;age in&s;truc|tors who accompany them, the ea&s;ie&s;t and &s;afe&s;t way of a&s;cending and de&s;cending the hill which lies before them. They often run from the &s;ide of their guides and lo&s;e them&s;elves among the &s;hrubs that blo&s;&s;om around them. Some give no ear to in&s;truction, and con&s;equently are con|tinually deviating among thorns, thi&s;tles, nettles, and brambles. Their errors are at pre&s;ent re|trievable, and few fall in the pitfalls with which the hill abounds. Joy illuminates their counte|nances. Theirs are the ruddy cheek, the &s;park|ling eye, lively &s;pirits, and unwearied activity.
<PB N="256" REF="031735_0255_0FF098B10229E4E0">
They retain a great &s;hare of the innocence with which they &s;et out, and therefore they are cheer|ful. Enviable age, if rea&s;on were mature! But folly, wantonne&s;s, frowardne&s;s of temper, and ignorance, greatly interrupt and &s;poil their en|joyments. Fruits of delicious ta&s;te grow around them, and flowrets of the &s;weete&s;t &s;cent and mo&s;t beautiful colour &s;pring beneath their feet. But they &s;oon grow tired of this lower part of the hill, and ambitiou&s;ly a&s;pire at higher eminences.</P>
<P>Behold them a few paces higher. They ad|vance with eagerne&s;s, and many of them for&s;ake the guides which have conducted them thus far in their a&s;cent. They ha&s;ten in their cour&s;e, nor do they adhere to the direct road, but deviate without &s;cruple. Some indeed return, but the greater part climb the hill by paths of their own choice, full of difficulty and danger. The pit|falls which are placed in every part of the hill are in this part very numerous, and not ea&s;ily to be avoided by tho&s;e who for&s;ake the high road. There are, indeed, no parts of the hill in which a guide is more nece&s;&s;ary than here, nor any in which travellers are le&s;s inclined to &s;eek his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>You &s;ee the beauty of the blo&s;&s;oms&mdash;you hear the mu&s;ic of the birds&mdash;all nature &s;eems to con|&s;pire in affording delight; but too many of the travellers pre&s;erve not that innocence and &s;impli|city which are nece&s;&s;ary to give a ta&s;te for the
<PB N="257" REF="031735_0256_0FF0978E75E62438">
plea&s;ures which are allowed. In&s;tead of pluck|ing the flowers which are known to be &s;afe and &s;alutary, they de&s;ire none but &s;uch as are poi&s;on|ous. The a&s;piring nature of the travellers leads them to continue the a&s;cent, and by this time you &s;ee they have reached the level &s;ummit, where you ob&s;erve a prodigious crowd, all bu&s;y in pur|&s;uit of their &s;everal objects. Their faces are clouded with care, and in the ardour of pur&s;uit they neglect tho&s;e plea&s;ures which lie before them. Mo&s;t of them have now lo&s;t a great &s;hare of their original innocence and &s;implicity, and many of them have lo&s;t it entirely.</P>
<P>And now they begin to de&s;cend. Their cheer|fulne&s;s and alacrity are greatly abated. Many limp, and &s;ome already crawl. The numbers di|mini&s;h almo&s;t every &s;tep; for the pitfalls are multiplied on this &s;ide of the hill, and many of the travellers have neither &s;trength nor &s;agacity to avoid them. Many delightful &s;cenes remain. Fruit in great abundance grows around them. But the greater part, you may remark, are care|le&s;s of the obvious and natural plea&s;ures which they might reach and enjoy, and are eagerly dig|ging in the earth for yellow du&s;t, on which they have placed an imaginary value. Behold one who has ju&s;t procured a load of it, under which he is ready to &s;ink. He totters along in ha&s;te to

find a hiding-place for it; but before he has found it, him&s;elf is hidden from our eyes: for lo! while I &s;peak, he is dropping into a pitfall. Mo&s;t of his companions will follow him; but you &s;ee no one is alarmed by the example. The de|&s;cent is become very &s;teep and abrupt, and few there are who will reach the bottom of the hill. Of tho&s;e few, not one advances without &s;tumb|ling on the edge of the pitfalls, from which he can &s;carcely recover his feeble foot. Ah! while I &s;peak they are all gone!</P>
<P>And is this a picture of life? &s;aid I: Alas! how little do they &s;eem to enjoy it! Surely &s;ome error mu&s;t infatuate them all. O &s;ay! that I may avoid it and be happy.</P>
<P>My &s;on, &s;aid my benevolent guide, do not ha&s;|tily form an opinion derogatory from the value of life.

&s;aying, "Come again, ye children of men."&mdash;And lo the plain opened in more places than I could number, and myriads of myriads &s;tarted into exi&s;tence, with bodies beautiful and glorious. And the voice proceeded, "In my father's hou&s;e are many man&s;ions. Ye have all fallen &s;hort of the perfection for which ye were created; but &s;ome have been le&s;s unprofitable &s;ervants than others; and to them are allotted the more exal|ted places of bli&s;s; but there remain man&s;ions appropriated to all the &s;ons of men. I have re|deemed the very wor&s;t of them from the tyran|ny of death. Ri&s;e therefore to your re&s;pective man&s;ions, enter into the joy of the Lord."

<HEAD>AN AFFECTING NARRATIVE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From "The OBSERVER," a &s;eries of E&s;&s;ays upon different Subjects, Written by R. CUMBERLAND, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THE following &s;tory is &s;o extraordi|nary, that if I had not had it from good au|thority in the country where it happened, I &s;hould have con&s;idered it as the invention of &s;ome poet for the fable of a drama.</P>
<P>A Portugue&s;e gentleman, whom I &s;hall beg leave to de&s;cribe no otherwi&s;e than by the name of Don Juan, was lately brought to trial for poi&s;|oning his half-&s;i&s;ter by the &s;ame father, after &s;he was with child by him. This gentleman had for &s;ome years before his trial led a very &s;olitary life at his ca&s;tle in the neighbourhood of Mon|tremos, a town on the road between Li&s;bon and Badajos, the frontier garri&s;on of Spain. I was
<PB N="261" REF="031735_0260_0FF097904B9A8520">
&s;hewn his ca&s;tle, as I pa&s;&s;ed through that di&s;mal country, about a mile di&s;tant from the road, in a bottom &s;urrounded with cork trees, and never &s;aw a more melancholy habitation. The cir|cum&s;tances which made again&s;t this gentleman were &s;o &s;trong, and the &s;tory was in &s;uch general circulation in the neighbourhood where he lived, that although he laid out the greate&s;t part of a con&s;iderable income in acts of charity, nobody ever entered his gates to thank him for his boun|ty, or &s;olicit relief, except one poor father of the Jeronymite convent in Montremos, who was his confe&s;&s;or, and acted as his almoner at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>A charge of &s;o black a nature, involving the crime of ince&s;t as well as murder, at length reach|ed the ears of ju&s;tice, and a commi&s;&s;ion was &s;ent to Montremos, to make enquiry into the ca&s;e. The &s;uppo&s;ed criminal made no attempt to e&s;|cape, but readily attended the &s;ummons of the Commi&s;&s;ioners. Upon the trial it came out, from the confu&s;ion of the pri&s;oner, as well as from the depo&s;ition of witne&s;&s;es, that Don Juan had lived from his infancy in the family of a rich merchant at Li&s;bon, who carried on a con&s;idera|ble trade and corre&s;pondence in the Brazils. Don Juan being allowed to take the merchant's name, it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed that he was his natural &s;on, and a clande&s;tine affair of love hav|ing been carried on between him and the merch|ant's
<PB N="262" REF="031735_0261_0FF098B96E638CA0">
daughter Jo&s;epha, who was an only child, &s;he became pregnant; and a medicine being ad|mini&s;tered to her by the hands of Don Juan, &s;he died in a few hours after, with all the &s;ymptoms of a per&s;on who had taken poi&s;on. The mother of the young lady &s;urvived her death but a few days, and the father threw him&s;elf into a con|vent of Mendicants, making over, by deed of gift, the whole of his property to the &s;uppo&s;ed murderer.</P>
<P>In this account there &s;eemed a &s;trange ob&s;cu|rity of facts; for &s;ome made &s;trongly to the crim|ination of Don Juan, and the la&s;t mentioned cir|cum&s;tance was of &s;o contradictory a nature, as to throw the whole into perplexity; and therefore to compel the pri&s;oner to a further elucidation of the ca&s;e, it was thought proper to interrogate him by torture.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this was preparing, Don Juan without betraying the lea&s;t alarm at what was going for|ward, told his judges that it would &s;ave them and him&s;elf &s;ome trouble, if they would receive his confe&s;&s;ion upon certain points, to which he would truly &s;peak, but beyond which all the tortures in the world could not force one &s;yllable. He &s;aid he was not the &s;on, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed, of the merchant with whom he lived, nor allied to the decea&s;ed Jo&s;epha any otherwi&s;e than by the ten|dere&s;t ties of mutual affection, and a promi&s;e of
<PB N="263" REF="031735_0262_0FF09795570F36A8">
marriage, which, however, he acknowledged he had not &s;olemnized: That he was the n&s;o of a gen|tleman of con&s;iderable fortune in the Brazils, who left him an infant to the care of the merch|ant in que&s;tion: That the merchant, for rea|&s;ons be&s;t known to him&s;elf, cho&s;e to call him by his own name; and this being done in his infan|cy, he was taught to believe, that he was an or|phan youth, the &s;on of a di&s;tant relation of the per&s;on who adopted him; he begged his judges therefore to ob&s;erve, that he never under&s;tood Jo&s;epha to be his &s;i&s;ter: That as to her being with child by him, he acknowledged it, and pray|ed God forgivene&s;s for an offence, which it had been his intention to repair by marrying her: That with re&s;pect to the medicine, he certainly did give it her with his own hands, for that &s;he was &s;ick in con&s;equence of her pregnancy, and being afraid of creating alarm or &s;u&s;picion in her parents, had required him to order certain drugs from an apothecary, as if for him&s;elf, which he accordingly did; and he verily believed they were faithfully mixed, ina&s;much as he &s;tood by the man whil&s;t he prepared the medicine, and &s;aw every ingredient &s;eparately put in.</P>
<P>The judges thereupon a&s;ked him, if he would take it on his con&s;cience to &s;ay, that the lady did not die by poi&s;on? Don Juan, bur&s;ting into tears for the fir&s;t time, an&s;wered, to his eternal
<PB N="264" REF="031735_0263_0FF097A26387EE98">
&s;orrow he knew that &s;he did die by poi&s;on&mdash;Was that poi&s;on contained in the medicine &s;he took?&mdash;It was&mdash;Did he impute the crime of mixing the poi&s;on in the medicine to the apothe|cary, or did he take it on him&s;elf?&mdash;Neither the apothecary nor him&s;elf was guilty&mdash;Did the lady from a principle of &s;hame (he was a&s;ked) commit the act of &s;uicide, and infu&s;e the poi&s;on without his knowledge?&mdash;He &s;tarted into horror at the que&s;tion, and took God to witne&s;s, that &s;he was innocent of the deed.</P>
<P>The judges &s;eemed now confounded, and for a time ab&s;tained from any further interrogatories, debating the matter among&s;t them&s;elves by whi&s;|pers; when one of them ob&s;erved to the pri&s;on|er, that according to his confe&s;&s;ion he had &s;aid &s;he did die by poi&s;on, and yet by the an&s;wers he had now given, it &s;hould &s;eem as if he meant to acquit every per&s;on on whom &s;u&s;picion could po&s;&s;ibly re&s;t: there was however one interrogatory left, which, unnatural as it was, he would put to him for form's &s;ake only, before they proceeded to greater extremities, and that que&s;tion involved the father or mother of the lady&mdash;Did he mean to impute the horrid intention of murdering their child to the parents?&mdash;No, replied the pri&s;oner in a firm tone of voice, I am certain no &s;uch in|tention ever entered the hearts of the unhappy parents, and I &s;hould be the wor&s;t of &s;inners, if I
<PB N="265" REF="031735_0264_0FF098BB27ED1990">
imputed it to them. The judges upon this de|clared with one voice, that he was trifling with the court, and gave orders for the rack; they would however for the la&s;t time demand of him, if he knew who it was that did poi&s;on Jo&s;epha? to which he an&s;wered without he&s;itation, that he did know, but that no tortures &s;hould force him to declare it, and they might di&s;po&s;e of him as they &s;aw fit; he could not die in greater tor|tures than he had lived.</P>
<P>They now took this peremptory recu&s;ant, and &s;tripping him of his upper garments, laid him on the rack; a &s;urgeon was called in, who kept his &s;ingers on his pul&s;e; and the executioners were directed to begin their tortures. They had giv|en him one &s;evere &s;tretch by ligatures fixed to his extremities and pa&s;&s;ed over an axle, which was turned by a windla&s;s: the &s;train upon his mu&s;|cles and joints, by the action of this infernal en|gine was dreadful, and Nature &s;poke her &s;uffer|ings by a horrid cra&s;h in every limb; the &s;weat &s;tarted in large drops upon his face and bo&s;om; yet the man was firm amid&s;t the agonies of the machine, not a groan e&s;caped, and the fiend who was &s;uperintendant of the helli&s;h work, declared they might encrea&s;e his tortures upon the next tug, for that his pul&s;e had not not varied a &s;troke, nor abated of its &s;trength in the &s;malle&s;t degree.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="031735_0265_0FF09798EF208F58">
The tormentors had now began a &s;econd oper|ation with more violence than the former, which their devili&s;h ingenuity had contrived to vary, &s;o as to extort acuter pains from the application of the engine, to parts that had not yet had their full &s;hare of the fir&s;t agony; when &s;uddenly a Monk ru&s;hed into the chamber, and called out to the judges to de&s;i&s;t from torturing that innocent man, and take the confe&s;&s;ion of the murderer from his own lips. Upon a &s;ignal from the judges, the executioners let go the engine at once, and the joints &s;napped audibly into their &s;ockets with the ela&s;ticity of a bow. Nature &s;unk under the re|vul&s;ion, and Don Juan fainted on the rack. The Monk immediately with a loud voice exclaimed, Inhuman wretches, delegates of hell, and agents of the devil, make ready your engine for the guilty, and take off your bloody hands from the innocent; for behold! (and &s;o doing he threw back his cowl) behold the father and the mur|derer of Jo&s;epha!&mdash;</P>
<P>The whole a&s;&s;embly &s;tarted with a&s;toni&s;hment; the judges &s;tood agha&s;t; and even the demons of torture rolled their eye-balls with horror and di&s;may.</P>
<P>If you are willing, &s;ays he to the judges, to receive my confe&s;&s;ion, whil&s;t your tormentors are preparing their rack for the vile&s;t criminal ever &s;tretched upon it, hear me! if not, &s;et your
<PB N="267" REF="031735_0266_0FF098BE02B09940">
engine to work without further inquiry, and glut your appetites with human agonies, which once in your lives you may now inflict with ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Proceed &s;aid the &s;enior judge.</P>
<P>That guiltle&s;s &s;ufferer, who now lies in&s;en&s;ible before my eyes, &s;aid the Monk, is the &s;on of an excellent father, who was once my deare&s;t friend; he was confided to my charge, being then an in|fant, and my friend followed his fortunes to our &s;ettlements in the Brazils: he re&s;ided there twenty years without vi&s;iting Portugal once in the time; he remitted to me many &s;ums of money on his &s;on's account. At this time a helli&s;h thought aro&s;e in my mind, which the di&s;tre&s;s of my af|fairs and a pa&s;&s;ion for extravagance in&s;pired, of converting the property of my charge to my own account. I imparted the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions to my unhappy wife, who is now at her account; let me do her the ju&s;tice to confe&s;s &s;he with&s;tood them firmly for a time. Still fortune frowned upon me, and I was &s;inking in my credit every hour; ruin &s;tared me in the face, and nothing &s;tood be|tween me and immediate di&s;grace but this infa|mous expedient.</P>
<P>At la&s;t per&s;ua&s;ion, menaces, and the impending pre&s;&s;ure of nece&s;&s;ity conquered her virtue, and &s;he acceded to the fraud. We agreed to adopt the in|fant as the orphan &s;on of a di&s;tant relation of our own name. I maintained a corre&s;pondence with
<PB N="268" REF="031735_0267_0FF0979B5E0EC360">
his father by letters pretended to be written by the &s;on, and I &s;upported my family in a &s;plendid extravagance by the a&s;&s;ignments I received from the Brazils. At length the father of Don Juan died, and by will bequeathed his fortune to me in failure of his &s;on and heirs. I had already advanced &s;o far in guilt, that the temptation of this contingency met with no re&s;i&s;tance in my mind; and determining upon removing this bar to my ambition, I propo&s;ed to my wife to &s;e|cure the prize that fortune had hung within our reach, by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the heir. She re|volted from the idea with horror, and for &s;ome time her thoughts remained in &s;o di&s;turbed a &s;tate, that I did not think it prudent to renew the attack. After &s;ome time, the agent of the de|cea&s;ed arrived in Li&s;bon from the Brazils, and as he was privy to my corre&s;pondence, it became nece&s;&s;ary for me to di&s;cover to Don Juan who he was, and al&s;o what fortune he was intitled to. In this cri&s;is, threatened with &s;hame and detection on one hand, and tempted by avarice, pride, and the devil on the other, I won over my reluctant wife to a participation of my crime, and we mix|ed that do&s;e with poi&s;on, which we believed was intended for Don Juan, but which in fact was de&s;tined for our only child.</P>
<P>She took it; Heaven di&s;charged its ven|geance on our heads, and we &s;aw our daughter
<PB N="269" REF="031735_0268_0FF098C0169A77F0">
expire in agonies before our eyes, with the bit|ter aggravation of a double murder, for the child was alive within her. Are there words in lan|guage to expre&s;s our lamentations? Are there tortures in the reach of even your invention to compare with tho&s;e we felt? Wonderful were the &s;truggles of nature in the heart of our expi|ring child: &s;he bewailed us, &s;he con&s;oled, nay &s;he even forgave us. To Don Juan we made immediate confe&s;&s;ion of our guilt, and conjured him to inflict that puni&s;hment upon us which ju&s;tice demanded, and our crimes de&s;erved. It was in this dreadful moment that our daughter with her la&s;t breath, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn adjura|tions, exacted and obtained a promi&s;e from Don Juan not to expo&s;e her parents to a public exe|cution by di&s;clo&s;ing what had pa&s;&s;ed. Alas! alas! we &s;ee too plainly how he kept his word: behold, he dies a martyr to honour! your in|fernal tortures have de&s;troyed him.&mdash;</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the Monk pronounced the&s;e words in a loud and furious tone, than the wretched Don Juan drew a &s;igh; a &s;econd would have followed, but Heaven no longer could tole|rate the agonies of innocence, and &s;topped his heart for ever.</P>
<P>The Monk had fixed his eyes upon him, gha&s;tly with terror; and as he &s;tretched out his mangled limbs at life's la&s;t ga&s;p, Accur&s;ed mon&s;|ters,
<PB N="270" REF="031735_0269_0FF097A08FB68988">
he exclaimed, may God requite his murder on your &s;ouls at the great day of Judgment! His blood be on your heads, ye mini&s;ters of dark|ne&s;s! For me, if heavenly vengeance is not yet appea&s;ed by my contrition, in the mid&s;t of flames my aggrieved &s;oul will find &s;ome con&s;olation in the thought, that you partake its torments.</P>
<P>Having uttered this in a voice &s;carce human, he plunged a knife to his heart, and, whil&s;t his blood &s;pouted on the pavement, dropped dead upon the body of Don Juan, and expired without a groan.</P>

<HEAD>NOURADIN AND FATIMA. AN EASTERN TALE.</HEAD>
<P>IN one of the mo&s;t beautiful vallies that lies upon the borders of the capital of the Ea&s;t, lived Jezdad, an innoffen&s;ive &s;hepherd; he had but one child, and having been bereft of his wife for many years, his whole &s;tock of tenderne&s;s was be&s;towed on Fatima. Though fortune had not been lavi&s;h of her gifts to the father of Fati|ma, yet he wanted not the nece&s;&s;aries or com|forts,
<PB N="271" REF="031735_0270_0FF098C1F163B128">
of life; his cottage was clean, and furni&s;h|ed with every thing u&s;eful; his fields and flocks &s;upplied them with food and raiment. Fatima was coar&s;e in her per&s;on, but &s;he was chearful and good-natured: She ro&s;e with the feathered &s;ong&s;ters, and, while performing the duties of her &s;tation, carolled forth &s;ome &s;imple ditty in wild untutored notes. Her whole &s;tudy was to plea&s;e her father, and to prepare his meals. She never repined at hard labour, and a &s;mile from Jezdad was like a cordial to revive her &s;pirits. When oppre&s;&s;ed with fatigue, &s;he would a&s;&s;i&s;t, una&s;ked, in the mo&s;t laborious employments; and at eve, by the pale light of Cynthia, &s;he would lightly trip with her young companions, while her fath|er played on the flagelet. The mind of Fatima was as calm as the delights of Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>One day &s;he was &s;ent to the grand vi&s;ier's with fruits for his favourite, and was conducted by an eunuch into the garden, where the beautiful Se|mira was repo&s;ing on a bed of ro&s;es, clad in all the pomp of ea&s;tern magnificence, while two &s;laves were fanning her to re&s;t. Fatima had never be|fore &s;een aught but &s;implicity. She was filled with wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;urpri&s;ing beauty and grandeur of Semira, and as &s;he gaz|ed, envy and di&s;content crept into her hitherto guilele&s;s bo&s;om.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="031735_0271_0FF098C4193F8040">
She returned home with a mind totally chang|ed from what it was; her rural pa&s;times no more delighted&mdash;labour was now a trouble. She had been a witne&s;s to the ca&s;e and indolence of Semira; if &s;he caught a glimp&s;e of her own &s;ha|dow in the &s;tream, &s;he turned from it with hor|ror and di&s;gu&s;t. Her days were joyle&s;s, and her nights &s;pent in moaning and bewailing her un|happy lot. The colour fled from her cheeks, and &s;he became the picture of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>One evening, deaf to the &s;olicitations of her young companions, &s;he retired to a thick grove, and, inattentive to the di&s;tant notes of the flage|let, thus found vent for her grief:</P>
<P>"Oh! wretched Fatima, unhappy maid! Why was I born to know &s;o hard a fate, to eat the bread of labour, and &s;leep upon a pea&s;ant's home|ly couch; while Semira is &s;urrounded with &s;plen|dour, is &s;erved by kneeling &s;laves, and &s;leeps on a bed of down!&mdash;And why has nature denied me tho&s;e ravi&s;hing beauties it has &s;o bountifully &s;howered on her; her eyes &s;o &s;parkling, her lips &s;o tempting red, and then her hand and arm &s;o finely turned, &s;o delicately white!&mdash;Oh! why was I not lovely as Semira, and favourite to the grand vi&s;ier?&mdash;But my own being is intolerable, I will no longer bear it, but in yon limpid &s;tream lo&s;e at once my&s;elf, and the remembrance of Semira."</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="031735_0272_0FF098C602FCBD70">
She ro&s;e from the ground, and was ha&s;tening towards the brook, when the genii Nouradin ap|peared, and thus addre&s;&s;ed her:</P>
<P>"Thy complaints are ju&s;t, O Fatima! and if thou wilt relinqui&s;h thy home, and for&s;ake thy father, thou &s;halt enjoy the utmo&s;t extent of thy wi&s;hes."</P>
<P>Fatima complied, and the genii touching her with his wand, and &s;prinkling her with my&s;tic water, &s;he was transformed into a beautiful vir|gin, and was conveyed into the garden of one of the palaces belonging to the grand vi&s;ier.</P>
<P>The beautiful Semira had the day before of|fended her lord, and was no longer a favourite. Fatima attracted the notice of the vi&s;ier; he took her into the palace, he clothed her with rich &s;ilks, adorned her with jewels, and &s;he &s;upplied the place of the degraded Semira.</P>
<P>Fatima now thought her&s;elf the happie&s;t among the happy; but the vi&s;ier was pa&s;&s;ionate, caprici|ous, and exceedingly cruel. It was not long be|fore &s;he found that the favourite of the grand vi|&s;ier lived only in &s;plendid &s;lavery. But though &s;aid &s;he often to her&s;elf, though the grand vi&s;ier's favourite is mi&s;erable, how &s;uperlatively happy mu&s;t be the favourite &s;ultana of my lord the em|peror. Oh! could I but fill that envied place, how &s;oon &s;hould the imperious vi&s;ier &s;uffer for his barbarity to me. Again did the bo&s;om of Fa|tima
<PB N="274" REF="031735_0273_0FF097A41480FA48">
experience all the mi&s;eries of di&s;content;&mdash;the vaulted roofs, &s;pacious gardens, and rich pre&s;|ents of the vi&s;ier no longer charmed; &s;he &s;ighed for the en&s;igns of royalty, and her pillow was nightly bedewed with her tears.</P>
<P>One evening &s;he retired to an arbour at the extremity of the garden, and throwing her&s;elf on the bank where &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een Semira, thus poured forth her complaints.</P>
<P>"Oh! mi&s;erable Fatima! how hard, a lot is this!&mdash;Condemned to drag out a wretched life with a man who &s;tudies only his own gratification, and expects me to be the &s;lave of his caprice and pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Oh! could I but get from this dete&s;ted place, I would fly to my lord the emperor, and bow my&s;elf low in the du&s;t before him;&mdash;my charms might captivate his royal heart, and I might nobly reign empre&s;s of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke the&s;e words a &s;udden light en|tered the arbour, and the genius Nouradin ap|peared before her.</P>
<P>"Beautiful Fatima," &s;aid he, "forbear your complaints; the prophet permits you to enjoy your wi&s;h; then ri&s;e, and in&s;tantly follow me."</P>
<P>The genii in&s;tantly tran&s;ported her to the em|peror's palace, and placed her along with a num|ber of beautiful virgins, which were the next mor|ning to be &s;hewn to the emperor, that he might chu&s;e a favourite.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="031735_0274_0FF097B89C488250">
In the morning, the emperor pa&s;&s;ed through the apartment, and his choice fell upon Fatima. She was clothed in all the en&s;igns of royalty, led in &s;tate to the mo&s;que, and in a few hours after, heard her&s;elf proclaimed empre&s;s of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>But deluded Fatima, to the idea of royalty had connected the ideas of youth and beauty. How &s;urprized was &s;he to find the emperor old, ugly, and deformed in his per&s;on, moro&s;e in his di&s;po|&s;ition, and jealous to an extreme. She &s;hrunk from him with horror, and contracted &s;o &s;ettled an aver&s;ion to his per&s;on, that it was not all the grandeur and pomp that atttended her could com|pen&s;ate for her being obliged to &s;uffer his loathed embraces.</P>
<P>Among the &s;laves that attended on Fatima was the beautiful Zynina, who had long with envious eyes beheld the en&s;igns of royalty be&s;towed on others, and only watched an opportunity to ingra|tiate her&s;elf with the emperor; to this end &s;he artfully cultivated the friend&s;hip of the new queen, and, by degrees, drew from her the rea&s;on of her tears and dejection. This intelligence was in&s;tant|ly conveyed to the emperor, with the addition of Fatima's heart being dedicated to another. The emperor, willing to be convinced of the &s;incerity of Zynina's declaration, de&s;ired to be concealed in an apartment adjoining to the queen's, where he might ea&s;ily hear any thing that pa&s;&s;ed between
<PB N="276" REF="031735_0275_0FF097A7CF264BC0">
her and the deceitful &s;lave, who immediately re|turned to her mi&s;tre&s;s, and renewed the conver|&s;ation. Fatima, glad to unburthen her almo&s;t breaking heart, was ea&s;ily led to confe&s;s her &s;et|tled aver&s;ion to her lord; and that death it&s;elf would be preferable to her pre&s;ent &s;ituation.&mdash;"Then death be thy portion!" cried the enraged emperor, furiou&s;ly ru&s;hing into the room, and lifting his glittering &s;cymitar.</P>
<P>Fatima fell upon her knees, and, bur&s;ting into a flood of tears, cried, "Oh! that I was an hum|ble cottager, and had never known the pangs that wait on greatne&s;s!" At that in&s;tant &s;he found her&s;elf clad in her former homely apparel, &s;tand|ing by her father's cottage, when the genius again appeared, and thus addre&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>"Fatima, I have &s;hewn you the vanity of hu|man wi&s;hes; learn from hence to be content with the allotments of Providence. Whatever be your &s;ituation in life, &s;ubmit to it without repin|ing, and know, that our holy prophet, who or|dereth all things in this terre&s;tial globe, knoweth what is be&s;t for mortals; therefore, fulfil the re|&s;pective duties of thy &s;tation to the be&s;t of thy power; envy not the wealth or &s;plendour of ano|ther, but humbly take the ble&s;&s;ings within thy reach, enjoy them, and be thankful."</P>

<HEAD>THE HAPPY COTTAGER; or the REWARD OF VIRTUE. A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>A REMOTE village in Oxford&s;hire, famed for its rural beauties, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a poor yet indu&s;trious cottager, who had a lovely daughter and his only child. The innocent &s;im|plicity of her manners, blended with paternal af|fection for an aged and only parent, rendered her charms peculiarly fa&s;cinating and amiable.</P>
<P>Sylvia was &s;o extremely beautiful, and the &s;ymmetry of her features &s;o exqui&s;itely delicate, that a young gentleman in the &s;ame village, en|dowed with a liberal fortune, refined accompli&s;h|ments, and engaging conde&s;cen&s;ion, was &s;o vio|lently attached to her per&s;on, that he was con|tinually di&s;patching his &s;ervant with pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> her&mdash;at the &s;ame time, wi&s;hing to conceal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> rank, de&s;ired him not to acquaint the object of his admiration from whom &s;uch tokens of e&s;teem were &s;ent. The &s;ervant of Mr. Norman (which was the gentleman's name) made &s;uch frequent vi&s;its to the humble cottage of our fair heroine, that the fond protector of his female offspring became alarmed for the &s;afety of his affectionate child.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="031735_0277_0FF097AD71613858">
Three days had &s;carcely elap&s;ed, before the faithful me&s;&s;enger was again &s;ent to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed father of his beloved Sylvia; a pur&s;e of gold was pre&s;ented to the ru&s;tic cottager, with a letter to the following purport:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Venerable and much re&s;pected cottager,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The trifling tokens of e&s;teem which your daughter has received from an unknown per&s;on, I am per&s;uaded mu&s;t have created &s;ome little unea&s;ine&s;s in your mind. I can a&s;&s;ure you, un|le&s;s I am the fortunate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of her matchle&s;s charms, I &s;hall for ever conceive my&s;elf the mo&s;t wretched and mi&s;erable mortal exi&s;ting; the con|tents of the pur&s;e which accompanies this note, I hope, will render you &s;ufficiently happy till I have an opportunity of per&s;onally declaring my tender and &s;incere pa&s;&s;ion for the lovelie&s;t of the &s;ex&mdash;my adorable Sylvia, your affectionate child.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your friend mo&s;t truly, NORMAN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Sylvia peru&s;ed the letter with great attention, and pathetically exclaimed, "My dear father, the numerous pre&s;ents I have received from an unknown friend, proves to be from Mr. Nor|man of our village&mdash;the a&s;&s;i&s;tance you have like|wi&s;e experienced, comes from the &s;ame kind benefac|tor!&mdash;How &s;hall we thank him enough?" Upon
<PB N="279" REF="031735_0278_0FF098CAB7D37160">
which her aged parent replied, "My dear child, it is not in our power to make Mr. Norman the &s;malle&s;t acknowledgment for the favours he has be&s;towed on us. Alas! may heaven be the re|ward of his goodne&s;s, is my ardent prayer." He had &s;carce uttered the la&s;t &s;entence when a flood of tears, the re&s;ult of gratitude, bedewed his wrinkled cheeks.</P>
<P>A &s;hort time had only expired, before Mr. Norman and his &s;ervant rode up to the cottage door, upon which he beheld his lovely Sylvia dil|igently &s;itting at a &s;pinning-wheel. He immedi|ately alighted, when &s;he with the mode&s;t blu&s;h of nature acco&s;ted him, and begged he would be &s;eated under their humble roof; upon which he &s;at down with apparently more real &s;atisfaction than in his own &s;uperb man&s;ion.</P>
<P>The following is a &s;hort delineation of his conver&s;ation to the father of Sylvia:</P>
<P>"My good and worthy cottager, I have long entertained a &s;ecret and tender pa&s;&s;ion for your mo&s;t virtuous daughter; I am now come to de|clare my honourable intention; my future hap|pine&s;s and comfort depends entirely on your ap|probation for me as a &s;on-in-law; the remainder of your days will, I hope, be made happy through the medium of my fortune, which &s;hall be at your daughter's di&s;po&s;al on the day of marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="031735_0279_0FF098CCC1BC4660">
The hone&s;t cottager replied, "My good &s;ir, my daughter is not worthy of &s;o good a gentle|man as you are; it di&s;tre&s;&s;es me to think you will have &s;o poor a relation as me&mdash;my heart is too full of gratitude to &s;ay more."</P>
<P>Mr. Norman and Sylvia were happily united a &s;hort time after this interview; and from the ob&s;cure roof of a cottage, &s;he removed to a &s;plen|did man&s;ion, where &s;he was univer&s;ally re&s;pected as the wife of Mr. Norman; her fond parent was al&s;o made comfortable for life.</P>

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF A REMARKABLE TRIAL BY COMBAT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Chevalier John Carouge, va&s;&s;al of the count d'Alencon, who was married to a young and beautiful lady, was obliged to make a &s;ea-voyage on &s;ome occa&s;ion, in which his for|tune was at &s;take; he accordingly left his wife at his ca&s;tle, where &s;he was ob&s;erved to comport her&s;elf with great prudence. It happened (&s;ays the hi&s;torian Froi&s;&s;ard, who relates this affair) that the devil entered into Jacques le Gris, ano|ther va&s;&s;al to the count d'Alencon, and by his wicked temptations in&s;pired him with a de&s;ire to enjoy the lady of the chevalier Carouge.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="031735_0280_0FF098CEC44838D0">
Accordingly, as the witne&s;&s;es at the trial de|po&s;ed, on a certain day, and at a certain hour, he mounted one of the count d'Alencon's hor&s;es, and rode to Argenteiul, where &s;he re&s;ided. His reception was &s;uch as was due to the friend of her hu&s;band, and the adherent of the &s;ame noble family. She &s;hewed him the ca&s;tle; and upon his reque&s;ting to &s;ee the tower, &s;he conducted him thither, without being accompanied by any of her dome&s;tics. When they were there, Ja|ques le Gris &s;hut the door, took the lady in his arms, and, as he was a powerful man, pre&s;ently &s;atisfied his de&s;ires. The lady &s;eeing her&s;elf thus di&s;honoured, &s;aid to him, "Oh Jaques, Jaques! you have not done well: the blame &s;hall not re&s;t upon me; a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, that if ever my hu&s;|band returns, it &s;hall light upon your own head." Jaques &s;eemed not to notice her menace, but re|mounted his hor&s;e, and rode back to the count d'Alencon's ca&s;tle full &s;peed.</P>
<P>He had been &s;een at four o'clock in the morn|ing at the ca&s;tle, and at nine the &s;ame morning he was at the count's levee; which particular circums;tance it is nece&s;&s;ary to remark.</P>
<P>The lady's hu&s;band at length returned, and &s;he received him with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s. The day pa&s;&s;ed away, and the night came; the chevalier went to re&s;t, and his wife walked about the chamber, cro&s;&s;ing her&s;elf at intervals,
<PB N="282" REF="031735_0281_0FF097B1F5765720">
till &s;uch time as every body was gone to bed. She then went to her hu&s;band's bed&s;ide, fell on her knees, and related what had happened to her, with great grief. At fir&s;t he could not cre|dit what &s;he told him; but after &s;ome time, per&s;uaded by her tears and prote&s;tations, he be|gan to think of vengeance. The friends and relations of him&s;elf and lady were accordingly a&s;&s;embled and con&s;ulted; and the general opinion was, that the deci&s;ion of the affair &s;hould be re|mitted to the count d'Alencon.</P>
<P>The parties were quickly &s;ummoned; the count &s;at to hear their depo&s;itions; and after many arguments on both &s;ides, concluded, that the lady had dreamed the tran&s;action; for he thought it impo&s;&s;ible, that a man could ride 23 leagues, and commit the crime, with all its cir|cum&s;tances, of which the defendant was accu&s;ed, in four hours and a half, which was the &s;ole interval that Jaques le Gris was mi&s;&s;ing from the ca&s;tle. They were therefore forbidden to men|tion the matter any further.</P>
<P>The Chevalier Carouge, however, who was a per&s;on of courage and delicate &s;en&s;e of honour, was not &s;atisfied with this deci&s;ion, but brought the cau&s;e before the tribunal of Paris; by which it was ordered to be decided by &s;ingle combat: and the king who was then at Sluys in Flanders, &s;ent a courier to defer the day of combat till his
<PB N="283" REF="031735_0282_0FF0973F00AA93F8">
return, it being his de&s;ire to be pre&s;ent. Among many others, the Dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, came al&s;o to Paris, to be witne&s;&s;es of this intere&s;ting &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>The place appointed was St. Catherine's; &s;caf|folds were erected for the public; and the com|batants were armed cap-a-pee. The lady, dre&s;&s;ed in black, was &s;eated under a kind of throne; her hu&s;band, as he entered the lifts, approached her, and &s;aid&mdash;'Madam, from your recital, and in your quarrel, I am going to expo&s;e my life in mortal combat again&s;t Jaques le Gris; it is be&s;t known to you whether or not my cau&s;e is ju&s;t and good.' To which &s;he replied&mdash;'Mon&s;ieur, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf it is; and therefore fight in full &s;ecurity.' The Chevalier then took her hand, ki&s;&s;ed it, made the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, and mounted.</P>
<P>The lady continued in prayer during the whole combat: her &s;ituation was truly critical; if her champion was vanqui&s;hed, &s;he was condemned to be hung and burnt without mercy.</P>
<P>The advantages of ground and &s;un were di|vided, as was the cu&s;tom, between the two com|batants; each ran his-career with the lance; but as they were both &s;kilful, neither of them receiv|ed any wound at this kind of attack; they there|fore di&s;mounted to fight on foot.</P>
<P>The Chevalier Carouge received the fir&s;t wound in the thigh; his friends trembled for him; and
<PB N="284" REF="031735_0283_0FF098D30627F168">
his poor lady was more dead than alive: but he recovered, and fell upon his enemy with &s;o much impetuo&s;ity and addre&s;s, that he threw him to the earth, and plunged his &s;word in his body. He then turned towards the &s;pectators, and a&s;ked them if he had done his duty; to which they an&s;wered with one voice 'Yes!'</P>
<P>The body of Jaques le Gris was abandoned to the executioner; who hung it on a hill near Paris, where it was left to peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The conqueror, after the victory, went and threw him&s;elf at his Maje&s;ty's feet; who prai&s;ed him for his valour, in&s;tantly gave him a thou&s;and livres, with a pen&s;ion of two hundred per annum, and appointed him one of the gentlemen of his chamber. He then ran to his lady, ki&s;&s;ed her, and went with her to the cathedral, where they mutually returned thanks, and left their offer|ings.</P>
<P>Thus was an accu&s;ation of this &s;erious nature &s;uppo&s;ed to be proved. The hi&s;torian who re|lates the combat, makes no reflections on the po&s;|&s;ibility of error; for it was not permitted to doubt of the guilt of Jaques le Gris after he had been thus &s;olemnly vanqui&s;hed.</P>
