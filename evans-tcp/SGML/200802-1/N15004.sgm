<Q><HI>And he &s;aid unto JESUS, LORD remember me when thou come&s;t into thy Kingdom.&mdash;And JESUS &s;aid unto him, Verily I &s;ay unto thee, To-day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e.</HI></Q>

<P>THIS memorable reque&s;t to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, was made by one of the malefactors which were cruci|fied with him. One of the&s;e per|&s;ons joined with the &s;urrounding multitude in in&s;ulting the &s;uffering Saviour in his la&s;t moments. One of the ma|lefactors which were hanged, railed on him, &s;aying, <HI>If thou be the</HI> CHRIST <HI>&s;ave thy&s;elf and us. Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> mention both the&s;e per&s;ons as joining in this railing accu&s;ation.&mdash;It is common in the Scripture for a &s;ingle thing to be expre&s;&s;ed in the plural number, e&s;pecially when it is not the de&s;ign of the writer to be very particular.&mdash;That is &s;aid to be written in the Prophets, which is written only in one of them. It is ob&s;erved of <HI>Jeptha,</HI> that he was buried in the cities of <HI>Gilead,</HI> meaning one of tho&s;e cities.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mark</HI> i. 2. <HI>Judges</HI> xii. 7.</NOTE></P>

THESE two Evangeli&s;ts, not de&s;igning particu|larly to relate the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e which were crucified with JESUS, expre&s;s them&s;elves in general terms: But St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives an exact detail of what pa&s;&s;ed re&s;pecting the&s;e per&s;ons, and repre&s;ents the one as having acted a very dif|ferent part from his fellow-&s;ufferer.&mdash;<HI>He an|&s;wering, rebuked him, &s;aying, do&s;t not thou fear</HI> GOD, <HI>&s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame condemnation? And we indeed ju&s;tly: For we receive the due re|ward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing ami&s;s.&mdash;And he &s;aid unto</HI> JESUS, LORD <HI>re|member me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom.</HI> Some &s;uppo&s;e that this reque&s;t implied nothing more than that CHRIST would exert his mi|raculous power in delivering him from his pre|&s;ent &s;ufferings, and that he would give him a place in a temporal kingdom on earth. But if we con&s;ider, that our LORD's di&s;ciples had giv|en up all hopes of his being the temporal deli|verer of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation, it will not appear very probable that this malefactor retained &s;uch a &s;entiment; e&s;pecially if we ob&s;erve that he &s;eemed perfectly &s;atisfied with the an&s;wer which our LORD gave him, <HI>To-day &s;halt thou be with me, &amp;c.</HI>&mdash;He &s;eems to have entertained ju&s;t and exalted notions of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, and to have believed that though CHRIST was &s;u&s;pended on the cro&s;s, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;piritual dominion and regal dignity, and had power to &s;ave and to de&s;troy.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider a little di&s;tinctly the reque&s;t it&s;elf, and the gracious an&s;wer which our LORD
<PB N="7" REF="019037_0005_0FA99E542CEE3280">
returned. This per&s;on evidently believed in CHRIST as the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, and the Sa|viour of the world. Notwith&s;tanding the ig|nominy and di&s;grace of his &s;ituation on the cro&s;s, he viewed him as the LORD of life and glory, and was willing to tru&s;t his immortal intere&s;ts in his hands. He was, in &s;ome way or other, brought to a &s;en&s;e of his ab&s;olute, pe|ri&s;hing need of a Saviour, and clearly &s;aw that there was &s;alvation in none other but CHRIST. If he had not firmly believed that CHRIST would be rai&s;ed from the dead, and that he would take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom of glory, there would have been no propriety in &s;uch an addre&s;s.&mdash;By what means &s;oever, we may &s;up|po&s;e that he became acquainted with the cha|racter of CHRIST, it certainly di&s;covered a &s;trong degree of faith to ca&s;t him&s;elf upon the mercy of one who was then nailed to the cro&s;s, and ju&s;t ready to give up the gho&s;t. He &s;aw the di|vine glory of a &s;uffering Saviour; and while one of his immediate di&s;ciples had betrayed him, while another had denied him, and the re&s;t for&s;aken him and fled, he &s;ays, LORD <HI>re|member me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom.</HI> He acknowledges that the dying JESUS is LORD of univer&s;al nature, and is able to be&s;tow ble&s;&s;ings infinitely &s;uperior to any thing that earth can yield.&mdash;The ca&s;e with many &s;inners is, that they do not &s;ee any beauty or comeli|ne&s;s in CHRIST that they &s;hould de&s;ire him. They fondly imagine that they are <HI>rich and in|crea&s;ed in goods, and have need of nothing,</HI> when they are really <HI>wretched and mi&s;erable, poor, blind and naked.</HI></P>

BUT this penitent thief deeply &s;en&s;ible of the exceeding evil and malignity of &s;in, and the fearful con&s;equences of it in a &s;tate of re|tribution, flies to JESUS the only city of re|fuge, and ca&s;ts him&s;elf upon his mercy <HI>who is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>To whom el&s;e can any &s;inners go, but to him <HI>who has the words of eternal life?</HI> Where can other condemned malefactors who are on the brink of eternity look, but to him who poured out his mo&s;t precious life in groans and agonies on the cro&s;s, to &s;ave the <HI>chief of &s;inners?</HI> By whom can they wi&s;h to be re|membered, but by him who has the dignity and glory of a kingdom to be&s;tow, to whom all power is committed in Heaven and earth? This petition &s;eems plainly to imply that the thief on the cro&s;s was a real friend of CHRIST, and that he was willing to be &s;aved on the terms of the go&s;pel.&mdash;His conver&s;ion might not, perhaps, in all re&s;pects have been &s;o &s;ud|den as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed: It is evident that he had &s;ome knowledge of the character of CHRIST from what he &s;aid to his fellow-&s;ufferer, <HI>This man has done nothing ami&s;s.</HI> It is not impo&s;&s;i|ble that he might have heard &s;ome of our LORD's di&s;cour&s;es, and &s;een &s;ome of his mira|culous works.</P>
<P>DURING his confinement in pri&s;on he might have been convinced of the evil and danger of &s;in, and have had &s;erious thoughts upon death and judgment.&mdash;Some have &s;uppo&s;ed that he might
<PB N="9" REF="019037_0007_0FA99E55ABD3A678">
have been a good man before the commi&s;&s;ion of the crime for which he &s;uffered, and that this &s;ingle act of gro&s;s wickedne&s;s which brought him to an untimely end, was not totally in|con&s;i&s;tent with the truth of grace. But there &s;eems no foundation for &s;uch a conjecture.&mdash;The ca&s;e of this per&s;on is rather recorded as a &s;ignal in&s;tance of the power and grace of the Redeemer; to &s;hew that no crimes are &s;o great, but that his blood can expiate the guilt of them; that no heart is &s;o hard, but it may be brought, by his victorious grace, to <HI>the obedience of faith.</HI></P>
<P>"I CANNOT but look upon this happy man," &s;ays Dr. <HI>Doddridge,</HI> <Q>(for &s;uch, amid&s;t all the ignominy and torture of the cro&s;s, he &s;ure|ly was) as a glorious in&s;tance of the power, as well as the &s;overeignty of divine grace; which, perhaps, taking the fir&s;t occa&s;ion from the preternatural darkne&s;s, wrought &s;o pow|erfully as to produce by a &s;udden and a&s;to|ni&s;hing growth in his la&s;t moments, all the virtues which could be crouded into &s;o &s;mall a a &s;pace, and which were eminently manife&s;ted in his confe&s;&s;ing his own guilt, in his admo|ni&s;hing his companion for a crime which he feared would prove fatal to him, in his vindi|cating the character of CHRIST, and repo|&s;ing his confidence in him as the LORD of a kingdom beyond the grave, when his ene|mies were triumphing over him, and he him&s;elf, abandoned by mo&s;t of his friends, was expiring on the cro&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="019037_0008_0FA99E566A8354D0">
IT is probable, that the previous knowledge he had of the character of CHRIST was merely &s;peculative, and that his heart was never effec|tually changed 'till this memorable day, in which he was to die on the cro&s;s with the LORD of glory.&mdash;It is quite rational to &s;up|po&s;e, that the divine Saviour who&s;e life was a &s;eries of wonders, who went about doing good to the &s;ouls and bodies of men, and who delighted above all things in acts of benevolence and mercy, &s;hould, in a dying hour give &s;ome &s;triking in&s;tance of the power of his grace.</P>
<P>WE cannot pretend to determine the exact time or manner of his conver&s;ion. But it can|not be denied, that the power and grace of CHRIST are &s;ufficient at any time to bring a &s;inner <HI>out of darkne&s;s into marvelous light,</HI> and to rai&s;e a &s;oul, guilty, depre&s;t and polluted to the joyful hope of immortality and glory. A Being of infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, does not confine him&s;elf to any particular mode of operation. He is &s;ometimes <HI>found of them that &s;eek him not</HI> and prevents men with the ble&s;&s;ings of his grace, while they are running on in a mad career of vice. In every age, there may be &s;ome &s;ignal monuments of the power of his grace, to &s;hew that nothing is too hard for him to effect to whom Omnipotence belongs.</P>
<P>THIS in&s;tance of the penitent thief cannot however, afford &s;ufficient matter of encourage|ment to others to per&s;i&s;t in &s;in, hoping to ob|tain
<PB N="11" REF="019037_0009_0FA99E594678E7F8">
pardon and life in their la&s;t moments. He had not &s;inned again&s;t &s;uch clear light and &s;trong convictions as per&s;ons in general do, who enjoy the Go&s;pel: It would be pre&s;umpti|on for tho&s;e to take comfort from this example who have long re&s;i&s;ted the &s;trivings of GOD's &s;pirit; who have broken &s;olemn vows and en|gagements, have &s;lighted the promi&s;es, de&s;pi|&s;ed the threatnings, been deaf to all the calls of GOD's word, and abu&s;ed that grace and mercy which has been &s;o freely offered them? This in&s;tance of late repentance, can never ju&s;tify any who have been educated under the clear light of the Go&s;pel, in neglecting that <HI>great &s;alvation</HI> which it offers, 'till death approaches. A &s;ingle in&s;tance of a late repentance produced and accepted in the article of death, and this under &s;uch peculiar circum&s;tances as never can occur again,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His &s;uffering with CHRIST on the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> darkne&s;s, &amp;c. are referred to.</NOTE> is a mo&s;t precarious ba&s;is for any to build their hopes upon.</P>
<P>IF per&s;ons retain their &s;ins as long as they po&s;&s;ibly can, again&s;t the cleare&s;t light and evi|dence, and call upon CHRIST to <HI>remember</HI> them when they have ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to <HI>remember</HI> him, can they with any propriety plead the ca&s;e of this malefactor in their be|half? The probability is, that he had no fair opportunity of profe&s;&s;ing faith in CHRIST 'till he was on the confines of eternity, and there|fore
<PB N="12" REF="019037_0010_0FA99E599AECE608">
was in a &s;ituation far different from tho&s;e in general, who have been born and educated un|der the clear light of the Go&s;pel. Their ca&s;e &s;eems to come the neare&s;t to his, who have been educated in total ignorance of the princi|ples and duties of religion, and who&s;e manner of life has been &s;uch, that they have had few opportunities to hear the word of GOD di&s;pen&s;|ed. Such a ca&s;e as this has exi&s;ted in our day; &s;uch an one is now pre&s;ented to our view.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Referring to <HI>Barrick</HI> and <HI>Sullivan,</HI> who had never been taught to read, and had heard but few Sermons in the cour&s;e of their lives.&mdash;See the Appendix.</NOTE> How fit and nece&s;&s;ary is it for per&s;ons in this &s;ituation to look to the divine Saviour for mercy, and &s;ay LORD <HI>remember us! &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>WE come now to con&s;ider the gracious and conde&s;cending an&s;wer which our LORD return|ed to this reque&s;t of the thief on the cro&s;s, <HI>To-day &s;hall thou be with me in Paradi&s;e.</HI> What an a&s;toni&s;hing mixture of dignity and mercy was here, that the Son of GOD &s;hould &s;peak from the cro&s;s as from a throne, and &s;hould in the agonies of death not merely di&s;pen&s;e pardons, but di&s;po&s;e of &s;eats in Paradi&s;e! What un&s;peak|able joy and &s;atisfaction mu&s;t this an&s;wer have yielded to the wretched malefactor! With what calmne&s;s and compo&s;ure could he re&s;ign his departing &s;pirit, after being a&s;&s;ured from the mouth of JESUS that to be ab&s;ent from the body would be to gain admi&s;&s;ion to the im|mortal joys of Heaven!</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="019037_0011_0FA99E5A2D3A8D60">
THE general opinion of the <HI>Jews</HI> re&s;pecting Paradi&s;e was, that it was a place into which pious &s;ouls were immediately received after death. This was the original of that oracle among the <HI>Chaldees, Seek Paradi&s;e the glorious country of the &s;oul.</HI> This was their benevolent wi&s;h for a dying per&s;on, <HI>Let his &s;oul be in Para|di&s;e.</HI> This word is introduced only in two other pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;acred volume; the one is 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 4. where St. <HI>Paul</HI> is &s;aid to have been caught up into Paradi&s;e, and to have heard un&s;peakble words: The other is <HI>Rev.</HI> ii. 7. where CHRIST promi&s;eth to him that over|cometh, that he &s;hall <HI>eat of the tree of life which is in the mid&s;t of the Paradi&s;e of</HI> GOD. This expre&s;&s;ion plainly alludes to that de|lightful garden in which our fir&s;t Parents dwelt while they retained their innocence; where the tree of life was fixed as a &s;urety and pledge of immortality. As they would have enjoyed an immortal life, if they had not &s;inned, &s;o all the true di&s;ciples of CHRIST will be admitted to a &s;tate of glory, honor and im|mortal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in that <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> which is above; an happine&s;s va&s;tly &s;uperior to that which the garden of <HI>Eden</HI> was capable of yielding; even &s;uch as <HI>eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, and which it hath not entered into the heart of man to conceive of.</HI></P>
<P>LET us however con&s;ider for a moment, the account which the Scriptures give us of the heavenly happine&s;s. It is declared to be
<PB N="14" REF="019037_0012_0FA99E5AED1E4330">
a &s;tate of perfect freedom from all evil and mi&s;ery. They who arrive at the man&s;ions of bli&s;s <HI>hunger no more, neither thir&s;t any more, the &s;un does not light on them, nor any heat, and</HI> GOD <HI>wipes away all tears from their eyes.</HI> There will be no danger from without, no pains and di&s;tre&s;&s;es from within to di&s;turb and perplex them. <HI>There the wicked cea&s;e from troubling and there the weary are at re&s;t.</HI> No <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> evil or defilement will any more cleave to them, nor will they be tempted any more to depart from GOD. No &s;educer or adver&s;ary can have acce&s;s to them. When they enter the <HI>Paradi&s;e of</HI> GOD, they take their leave of &s;in and mi&s;ery forever, and are fixed in tho&s;e calm and bli&s;sful regions, from whence &s;ighs and tears are perpetually bani&s;hed.</P>
<P>IT is not, however, to be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;uch as <HI>die in the</HI> LORD, are, in their &s;eparate &s;tate, exalted to the highe&s;t dignity and glory of the heavenly world: But as we pa&s;s thro' the &s;e|veral &s;tages of infancy, childhood, youth, &amp;c. in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, &s;o it is probable that the happine&s;s of the next, will be progre&s;&s;ive. It is evident from the general tenor of Scripture, that the happine&s;s of the &s;aints will be greatly augmented at the re&s;urrection; that they will be admitted to the compleat and everla&s;ting en|joyment of GOD and the Redeemer. <HI>When</HI> CHRIST <HI>who is our life &s;hall appear,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>then &s;hall ye al&s;o appear with him in glo|ry.

How do they prompt men to mea&s;ures which impair the under&s;tanding and &s;ear the con&s;cience; which are di&s;honorary to GOD and injurious to men; which bla&s;t repu|tation and character, and end in mi&s;ery and death!

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX, EXHIBITING Some Account of the Conver&s;ation and Behaviour of WHITE, BAR|RICK and SULLIVAN, in Pri&s;on, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ALEXANDER WHITE, when brought upon his Trial before the Honourable Supreme Judicial Court, for Murder and Piracy on the High Seas, pleaded GUILTY. The Court &s;eemed much affected with his plea, and the rehear&s;al of his &s;tory. They did not direct his plea to be recorded, but re|manded him to pri&s;on, informing him that they would con&s;ider further of his ca&s;e the next morning. Upon his appearing at the Bar the &s;econd time he pleaded as before. The Court were &s;o tender of his ca&s;e, that they proceed|ed to examine &s;undry witne&s;&s;es; and after they had gone through their evidence, <HI>White</HI> declared that they had related the circum&s;tances of the affair as nearly as could po&s;&s;ibly be expected.</P>
<P>AT the fir&s;t Pa&s;toral Vi&s;it, which was made him in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> it was particularly enquired, Why he accu&s;ed him&s;elf before the Court in a tri|al for his life? He an&s;wered, that his con&s;cience
<PB N="26" REF="019037_0024_0FA99E656EBAE7E8">
formed him that he was guilty, and that as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> life was forfeited, he wi&s;hed not to retain&mdash;It was then ob&s;erved that pleading <HI>not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> before a Court amounts to nothing more in putting one's &s;elf upon trial.&mdash;He &s;aid he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;en&s;ible of that; but knowing that he had murdered an innocent man, it appeared to him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> duty to confe&s;s it before GOD and men: he added, that he believed the evidence was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ufficient to convict him, but he cho&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the puni&s;hment due to his crime.</P>
<P>IT was then ob&s;erved to him, that Death was &s;olemn and important event, and that the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of it was a pa&s;&s;ion deeply implanted in hu|man nature; and particular enquiry was made <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> what grounds he was &s;o reconciled to it? <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aid, that he had &s;oon after the commi&s;&s;ion his crime, framed a &s;tory, in which he en|deavoured to throw the guilt upon the Pa&s;&s;en|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">; but that after he was committed to pri|&s;on at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> he was brought under deep <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">viction of the evil of &s;in, and was for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ral weeks in the utmo&s;t angui&s;h and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that he read the Word of GOD and other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of devotion with the utmo&s;t attention and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and frequently received vi&s;its from Mr. <HI>Rob|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> and other Mini&s;ters and Friends, who gave <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the be&s;t coun&s;el and advice in their power; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> al&s;o that he heard &s;undry Sermons which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> well adapted to his ca&s;e.

<P>EVERY time the author of the foregoing Ser|mon vi&s;ited him, he appeared very humble, &s;eri|ous and prayerful. He &s;pake of death with great calmne&s;s and compo&s;ure, and declare him&s;elf perfectly reconciled to it, from a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion of his intere&s;t in the favour of GOD and a confident hope of a better life.

<P><PB N="28" REF="019037_0026_0FA99E66ED76CB40">
SEVERAL other Mini&s;ters who &s;aw and con|ver&s;ed with him, were at fir&s;t very apprehen&s;ive that he was a mere <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t,</HI> and that as death approached, he would change his &s;tile: But upon further conver&s;ation, when the time of ex|ecution was at hand, they &s;eemed much more &s;atisfied of his &s;incerity. It is worthy of parti|cular notice, that he took great pains to en|lighten his Fellow-&s;ufferers, by reading to them the Scriptures and other good books; by coun|&s;els and exhortations, and that he often prayed with and for them.</P>
<P>As he was going to the place of execution, he was a&s;ked, Whether he now heartily approved of the method of &s;alvation through JESUS CHRIST, and could tru&s;t in his merits and mediation for pardon and eternal life? He &s;aid that it appeared to him mo&s;t wi&s;e and excellent, and that he had not the lea&s;t wi&s;h for any other way of life than that through JESUS CHRIST, and that he did en|tirely depend on the rich grace and mercy of GOD, through him, for pardon and &s;alvation. When enquiry was made, Whether his faith and hope continued as &s;trong and vigorous as ever? He &s;aid they really did, and that he viewed death with the utmo&s;t complacency and &s;atisfaction; and further &s;aid, that if the&s;e graces &s;hould fail him in his la&s;t moments he would openly de|clare it: He added, that he ardently wi&s;hed the pro&s;perity and &s;ucce&s;s of the kingdom of the Re|deemer among men. He prayed very earne&s;tly with his la&s;t breath, and died commending his &s;oul into the hands of GOD.</P>

IN this recital the &s;tile of the Pri&s;oner could not be exactly recollected; but his ideas are re|pre&s;ented as nearly as po&s;&s;ible. Many other que&s;|tions were propo&s;ed to him, the recording of which, might too far protract this Appendix. The&s;e facts are &s;ubmitted, leaving every one to form his own judgment upon &s;o &s;ingular a ca&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Barrick</HI> and <HI>John Sullivan</HI> appeared exceedingly ignorant, and owned that they had never been taught to read. <HI>Barrick</HI> &s;aid that he never knew his parents, but was &s;ent very young to the foundling-ho&s;pital. It was ob&s;erv|ed to him that proper provi&s;ion was made there for the in&s;truction of children. He &s;aid that this was the ca&s;e in &s;ome parts of it; but not &s;o in others. <HI>Sullivan</HI> &s;aid that his parents were &s;o|licitous for the education of their children, and that of eleven he was the only one which was not taught, and that this was owing to his re|fractory temper and his di&s;obedience to his pa|rents. When enquiry was made whether they believed the Being and perfections of GOD, and that men would be happy or mi&s;erable after death, according to their conduct in the pre&s;ent &s;tate? they an&s;wered in the affirmative. They were a&s;ked whether they were &s;en&s;ible of the ex|ceeding evil of &s;in as it is oppo&s;ite to a holy GOD, and their need of pardon and mercy through JE|SUS CHRIST? They &s;eemed at a lo&s;s for an an|&s;wer, and &s;aid they did not under&s;tand it. No &s;mall pains was taken by &s;undry Mini&s;ters to lead them to a proper &s;en&s;e of their &s;tate, and to
<PB N="30" REF="019037_0028_0FA99E686DC4F6F8">
open to them the way of &s;alvation through CHRIST.</P>
<P>AT the fir&s;t vi&s;it they pretended to deny that they were guilty of the Robbery at <HI>Winter-Hill,</HI> for which they had been convicted; but after &s;entence of death was pronounced by the Court, they both owned the fact.</P>
<P>HAVING formed an inveterate habit of vice in early life, and been de&s;titute of in&s;truction and di&s;cipline, it was extremely difficult to make any impre&s;&s;ion upon them. They &s;aid they were afraid to die, &s;en&s;ible that they were unprepared, and wi&s;hed for more time.</P>
<P>As the day of execution approached, they &s;eem|ed con&s;iderably affected, and &s;aid they were hear|tily &s;orry for all their &s;ins, and wi&s;hed for mer|cy through JESUS CHRIST. As they advanced to the Gallows, they &s;eemed much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and continued crying to GOD through CHRIST, 'till the moment arrived which u&s;hered them in|to eternity.&mdash;Thus much is mentioned with re&s;pect to the&s;e two unhappy Men, to &s;hew the extreme danger of neglecting the proper edu|cation and government of children, and the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;training them while young from &s;inful exce&s;&s;es.</P>
