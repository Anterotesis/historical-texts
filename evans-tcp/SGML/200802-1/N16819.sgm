<P>THE brave, but eccentric general Lee had &s;o little regard to the rules of politene&s;s and ci|vility, that he always &s;poke his opinions unre&s;ervedly, without regarding the offence or pain they might ex|cite. Being one night at Albany, drinking with an old Scotch officer, when he began to mellow with the wine, he told his companion that he had one fault, which he begged him to overlook, which was to abu&s;e the Scotch when he was in liquor. In troth, replied the officer, I &s;hall readily forgive your fault, if you will overlook mine; it is, when I hear any per&s;on impertinently abu&s;ing Scotland or Scotchmen, when I am drunk or &s;ober, I cannot refrain from laying my cane &s;oundly over his &s;houlders. Now I will readily pardon your fault, if you will pardon mine. This &s;ea&s;onable hint made the general very polite the remainder of the night.</P>

This curio&s;ity drew great crowds of people to &s;ee him, and among&s;t the re&s;t, general Wa&s;hington.

Soon after the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts in&s;urgents retreated from their attack on general Shepard, at Ordnance-hill, and when it was hourly expected they would renew it, Shays &s;ent a flag to general Shepard, re|que&s;ting to have delivered to him the bodies of the killed, amounting to five. The officer, who had been &s;ent by general Shepard, to receive the flag, on the reque&s;t being made for five &s;lain, with the utmo&s;t <HI>&s;ang froid</HI> imaginable replied, <Q>Pre&s;ent general She|pard's compliments to captain Shays: and inform him, that he cannot furni&s;h him with <HI>five</HI> dead, he having no more than <HI>four:</HI> but that if captain Shays will plea&s;e to attack him again, he will then furni&s;h him with another, and as many more as he &s;hall de&s;ire.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. Dr. Franklin, as agent for the province of Penn|&s;ylvania, being in England at the time the parliament pa&s;&s;ed the &s;tamp-act for America, was frequently ap|plied to by the mini&s;try for his opinion re&s;pecting the operation of the &s;ame, and a&s;&s;ured them that the people of America would never &s;ubmit to it. The act was neverthele&s;s pa&s;&s;ed, and the event &s;hewed he had been right. After the news of the de&s;truction of the &s;tamped paper had arrived in England, the mi|ni&s;try again &s;ent for the doctor, to con&s;ult with him, and concluded with this propo&s;ition, that if the Ame|ricans would engage to pay for the damage done in the de&s;truction of the &s;tamped paper, &amp;c. the par|liament would then repeal the act. To this the doc|tor an&s;wered, that it put him in mind of a French|man, who having heated a poker red hot, ran into the &s;treet, and addre&s;&s;ing an Engli&s;hman he met there, "hah, mon&s;ieur, voulez vous giv&eacute; me de plai&s;ir et de &s;atisfaction, and let&eacute; me runi dis poker only one foote up your back&s;ide?"

<P N="5">5. A member of the general court of Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, who, from accu&s;toming him&s;elf to take a nap after dinner, when at home, could not di&s;pen&s;e with the cu&s;tom, when attending to give laws to a mighty people, not long &s;ince occa&s;ioned much &s;port in the hou&s;e, by the following incident. A day was a&s;|&s;igned for the &s;econd reading of a lumber-act: as this intere&s;ted our &s;leeper, he reque&s;ted a friend, who &s;at next him, to awaken him, if the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the bill &s;hould be introduced, while he was a&s;leep This his friend promi&s;ed him: but, happening to go out for a few minutes, the bill was called for; and, af|ter a &s;hort debate, was committed. Immediately after, the bill for preventing fornication, was brought on. This occa&s;ioned &s;ome debate, during which the &s;leeper's friend returned. Finding the lumber-bill was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, he thought he might indulge his friend in his nap. However, as ill-luck would have it, he trod upon the toe of this votary to Morpheus, who &s;uppo&s;ed it a &s;ignal for his waking: immediately rou&s;ing him&s;elf, he rubbed his eyes, and looking about, perceived a pau&s;e in the debate&mdash;on which he aro&s;e and addre&s;&s;ed the &s;peaker as follows: <Q>Sir, I wi&s;h to &s;peak a few words on the bill now in que&s;|tion. It affects, mr. Speaker, my con&s;tituents very much: for <HI>above half our town get their living by it.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="6">6. Some time ago, at a yearly commencement in one of the ea&s;tern &s;tates, the auditors were entertain|ed part of the forenoon with a Hebrew oration. Be|ing

<P N="7">7. At the commencement of the late revolution, when the French nation appeared inclined to take part in the conte&s;t in favour of America, &s;ir Jo&s;eph Yorke, the amba&s;&s;ador from England to the United Netherlands, meeting the French amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, cen&s;ured his court for interfering in the di&s;|pute, and taking &s;o ungenerous a part: "You have been guilty of a di&s;honourable act (&s;aid he) that is unpardonable&mdash;to le&s;s than that of debauching our daughter." "I am &s;orry (replied the French Am|ba&s;&s;ador) that your excellency &s;hould put &s;uch a &s;e|vere con&s;truction, upon the matter: She made the fir&s;t advances, and ab&s;olutely threw her&s;elf into our arms; but, rather than forfeit your friend&s;hip, if matrimony will make any atonement, we are ready to act honourably, and marry her."</P>
<P N="8">8. Not long &s;ince a per&s;on vi&s;ited the city of New-York, under the &s;tyle of nobility. For &s;everal months his manner of living accorded with his a&s;|&s;umed character. His lodgings, his attendants and his equipage, corre&s;ponded only with rank and opu|lence. Fa&s;hion received from him its laws, and ta&s;te appealed to him as its genuine &s;tandard. Balls, a&s;&s;em|blies, and entertainments, welcomed him as their principal ornament: while &s;enators and amba&s;&s;adors were plea&s;ed to be enrolled as his companions.&mdash;In this career of glory, he addre&s;&s;ed a young lady, high|ly re&s;pectable for her character and connections: but, at the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of marriage, by the fre&s;h appearance of the ink, which he had u&s;ed in forging certain deels, de&s;igned as proof of great family property, and by a di&s;pute with a per&s;on about the price of the

<P N="9">9. When George Whitfield fir&s;t came to Charle&s;|ton in South Carolina, the rev. Alexander Garden was epi&s;copal mini&s;ter of that place. Not liking Whitfield's principles, he took occa&s;ion to preach a &s;ermon again&s;t him from the following text,&mdash;"Be|hold, tho&s;e that have turned the world up&s;ide down, are come hither al&s;o."&mdash;In the afternoon of the &s;ame day, Whitfield, in his turn, retorted upon his anta|goni&s;t to a very crowded audience, and with all the wit and &s;atire for which he was &s;o remarkable, from the&s;e words of St. Paul, "Alexander the copper|&s;mith hath done me much evil, the Lord reward him according to his works."&mdash;Soon after, Garden, not to be outdone, took occa&s;ion to declaim with &s;ome heat, again&s;t the light and trifling tunes u&s;ed in Whitfield's church, as being too theatrical and gay for holy wor&s;hip, and &s;uch as had been long appro|priated to prophane &s;ongs and airs&mdash;"Very true, doc|tor, &s;aid Whitfield in his next lecture: but pray, &s;ir, can you a&s;&s;ign any good rea&s;on why the devil &s;hould always be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t tunes?"</P>
<P N="10">10. Some officers of the army who had &s;erved du|ring the American war, walking in Hyde-Park, dre&s;&s;ed in their regimentals, met a man deformed by a haunch on his back, when one of them jocularly clapping his hand thereon, exclaimed, "What have you got here, my friend!" To which the other, with a countenance expre&s;&s;ive of the in&s;ult, replied, "Bunkers hill&mdash;damn your red coat."</P>
<P N="11">11. At the opening of one of the courts of law in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, lately, a clergyman was &s;ent for to addre&s;s the Deity&mdash;a gentleman pre&s;ent ob&s;erved, that although this was ever the laudable practice, at the &s;upreme judicial court, <HI>the&s;e</HI> courts had never, in his memory, opened with prayer. A &s;ailor, who heard the la&s;t remark, ob&s;erved to his me&s;s-mate, "If &s;o,

<P N="12">12. One Indian happened to kill another. The bro|ther of the decea&s;ed called upon the murderer, and &s;eeing a woman and children in his hut, a&s;ked who&s;e they were? The murderer declared them to be his family. The other then &s;aid, though his brother's blood called for revenge, yet as the children were young, and not able to provide for their mother and them&s;elves, he would remain, deaf to the&s;e calls for a while; and &s;o left them. Belonging to the &s;ame tribe, they continued to live &s;ociably together until the elde&s;t &s;on of the murderer killed a deer in hunt|ing. So &s;oon as the brother of the decea&s;ed was in|formed of this, he again called on the murderer, and told him, that his brother's blood called &s;o loud, that it mu&s;t be obeyed, e&s;pecially as his &s;on, having killed a deer, could &s;upport the family. The murderer &s;aid he was ready to die, and thanked the other for &s;o long a delay: on which the wife and children broke into tears. The murderer reproved them for their weakne&s;s, and particularly his &s;on&mdash;&s;aying to him, did you &s;hed tears when you killed the deer? and if you &s;aw him die with dry eyes, why do you weep for me, who am willing to &s;uffer what the cu&s;tom of our nation renders nece&s;&s;ary? With an undaunted countenance he then called on the brother of the de|cea&s;ed, to &s;trike; and died without a groan!</P>
<P N="13">13. General Morgan, with eight hundred men, of whom one half were militia, completely beat, at the battle of the Cowpens, colonel Tarleton, who at|tacked him with one thou&s;and regular troops.&mdash;Two hundred dragoons of that colonel, were put to flight, and bri&s;kly pur&s;ued by &s;ixty Americans, under co|lonel Wa&s;hington. Some months afterwards, Tar|leton, being in the hou&s;e of a farmer, &s;poke with much vanity of him&s;elf, and lightly of colonel Wa&s;hington, &s;aying "he wi&s;hed much to &s;ee his face." "It is a pity then," replied a girl in the

<P N="14">14. About four years before the Shawano Indians were forced to remove from the late Savannah town, they took a Mu&s;kohge warrior known by the name of old Scrany&mdash;They ba&s;tinadoed him in the u&s;ual manner, and condemned him to the fiery torture. He underwent a great deal, without &s;hewing any concern: his countenance and behaviour were as if he &s;uffered not the lea&s;t pain, and was formed beyond the common laws of nature. He told them, with a bold voice, that he was a very noted warrior, and gained mo&s;t of his martial preferment at the expence of their nation, and was de&s;irous of &s;hewing them in the act of dying, that he was &s;till as much &s;uperior to them as when he headed his gallant countrymen again&s;t them. That although he had fallen into their power, in forfeiting the protection of the divine be|ing, by &s;ome impurity or other, when carrying the holy ark of war again&s;t his devoted enemies; yet he had &s;till &s;o much remaining virtue, as would enable him to puni&s;h him&s;elf more exqui&s;itely than all their de&s;picable ignorant crowd could do, if they gave him liberty by untying him, and would hand to him one of the red hot gun barrels out of the fire. The pro|po&s;al, and his method of addre&s;s, appeared &s;o ex|ceedingly bold and uncommon, that his reque&s;t was granted. Then he &s;uddenly &s;eized one of the red hot barrels, and brandi&s;hing it from &s;ide to &s;ide, he forced his way through the armed and &s;urpri&s;ed mul|titude, and leaped down a prodigious &s;teep and high bank into a branch of the river, dived through it, ran over a &s;mall i&s;land, and pa&s;&s;ed another branch, amid&s;t a &s;hower of bullets, from the commanding ground where fort More, or New Wind&s;or garri&s;on, &s;tood, and though numbers of his eager enemies were in clo&s;e pur&s;uit of him, he got to a brambly &s;wamp, and in his naked, mangled condition, reached his own country. He proved a &s;harp thorn in their &s;ide af|tewards till the day of his death.</P>

15. In the we&s;tern expedition of 1758, general Forbes, who commanded it, was, by his infirmities, reduced &s;o low as to be taken up in a litter.&mdash;The Indians, who &s;aw him, were a&s;toni&s;hed that a war|rior could not walk:&mdash;this &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted them at their commander, that they remon&s;trated again&s;t him.

When the Briti&s;h and American armies were near each other in the neighbourhood of German-Town, five He&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers, who had &s;traggled in|to the woods, and lo&s;t their way, were met by an Iri&s;hman, who was a private in general Wa&s;hington's army: he immediately pre&s;ented his piece, and de|&s;ired them to &s;urrender; they &s;uppo&s;ing that he was &s;upported by a party, did as he directed, and threw down their arms. He then marched them before him to the American lines, and brought them to head quarters, general Wa&s;hington wondered at the &s;pi|rit and achievement of the fellow, and a&s;ked him, how he, a &s;ingle man, could capture five? Why, &s;ays the Iri&s;hman, <HI>plea&s;e your excellency, by Ja&s;us I &s;ur|rounded them!</HI>&mdash;The General laughed heartily, gave him a &s;um of money, and promoted him to a halbert.</P>

A gentleman, who had ta|ken a place in it, being engaged writing a letter, at the u&s;ual time of &s;etting out, reque&s;ted a few mi|nutes delay, but in vain. Mr. Whip was inexora|ble: he in&s;i&s;ted on &s;etting off, adding, by way of reproach, he was &s;ure no gentleman would a&s;k him to &s;tay a moment. So the gentleman was obliged to leave his letter unfini&s;hed, and the driver &s;et off at full &s;peed. When they had run about half a mile, the waggoner's hat falling off, he &s;tooped, to pick it up. The gentleman &s;eized the reins, and drove away, leaving mr.

He added that he was on his way to Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, where he had &s;ome friends, and a&s;ked charity of the doctor. The latter was liberal and ho&s;pitable to the &s;tranger, and told him as it was Saturday, and it would be im|proper for him to travel on the Sabbath, he might re|fre&s;h him&s;elf at his hou&s;e both days. The offer was accepted; and dr. Huntington invited his gue&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t him next day in the duties of his function; but he declined, alleging as a rea&s;on, that his clothes were not &s;ufficiently decent to appear in the pulpit. To obviate this difficulty, the doctor offered him a &s;uit of clothes almo&s;t new. The objection being removed, the pretended clergyman agreed to a&s;&s;i&s;t his brother, and, in order to prepare him&s;elf, de&s;ired to be left alone that even|ing, to &s;tudy his di&s;cour&s;e.
