<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear &amp; Intirely Beloved Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is an afflicting Providence from GOD, and ju&s;t cau&s;e of &s;hame to me [for I cannot clear my &s;elf from a great deal of ju&s;t blame] that I have not done, nor can now do any thing for you in regard of tho&s;e writings you de&s;ired of me: I have, and am continually pre&s;|&s;ed with variety of urgent occa&s;ions, &amp; much time [in the way I am in] is daily taken up from my per&s;onal &s;tudies, be&s;ides many incident avocations: And alas I can do little, &amp; make but &s;low progre&s;s in the long race of Learning I have to run! And it is my mi&s;erable gui&s;e, either by wickedne&s;s or weakne&s;s, to fall &s;hort of that good I &s;hould either get or do; and if it be &s;o in this ca&s;e towards you, it is no wonder, tho it &s;hould be my deep &s;orrow! But yet con&s;idering &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in your la&s;t and

former Letters concerning your Spiritual Condi|tion, and knowing, by experience in my &s;elf, the reality of &s;uch Complaints; I would not be &s;o gracele&s;s as to neglect you wholly therein: And tho' I can &s;ay or do very little, yet a word or two might be of &s;ome u&s;e; nor do I know what guilt might lye upon me, if I &s;hould be &s;ilent or &s;light in this Ca&s;e! And therefore [Dear&mdash;] if my barren heart would &s;uffer me, I would pre&s;ent you with a few words, as if you &amp; I were alone in a Corner, in the pre&s;ence of GOD!</P>
<P>The Condition you expre&s;s, is the Common [but fearful] Epidemical Calamity of tho&s;e times and places where the Go&s;pel is Preached, and a|mong &s;uch as outwardly carry fair: Convinced but not humbled; &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of mi&s;ery and affections now and then, but not deep effectual mournings; &s;omething burdened with &s;in and mi|&s;ery, and wrath of GOD; but yet able to bear it, and contented to live without being delivered from it: Knowing every thing, and feeling no|thing; or rather knowing every thing, and yet in|deed knowing nothing; in &s;eeing, not, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For my own part, it is that which hath been the baneful mi&s;ery of my Soul [even that very thing which thou &s;ay &amp; mean] ever &s;ince I knew any thing; and the Lord knows how little I am delivered from it, and how much of my work in this point [upon which the very hinges of our Salvation turn] is yet to do to this day! Oh [my&mdash;] if my heart were not Adamant, I &s;hould weep with, and for

you: And truly when I am mo&s;t near God, I have no greater reque&s;t than this for my &s;elf &amp; you, that God would u&s;e any means to make us &s;ee things really as they are, &amp; pound our hearts all to pieces, and make indeed &s;in mo&s;t bitter, and Chri&s;t mo&s;t &s;weet; that we might be both humbled, &amp; Com|forted to purpo&s;e! An imperfect work of the Law, and then an imperfect work of the Go&s;pel, is the bane &amp; ruine of us in the&s;e days! Some fears and affections, &amp; then &s;ome hopes of Mercy [without finding full re&s;t &amp; &s;atisfaction in Chri&s;t only] men re&s;t in, &amp; here peri&s;h! But hence is the ground of that you &s;peak of: An heart that doth not, can|not feel &s;in [&amp; con&s;equently, no other thing that Gods word &s;peaks of] &amp; the wrath of God for it, to purpo&s;e: Cannot be &s;en&s;ible of &s;in or mi&s;ery in an effectual manner! Now a word or two of Coun|&s;el to you in this Ca&s;e!</P>
<P>Fir&s;t con&s;ider the end &amp; thing you are to &s;trive after. Secondly the way &amp; manner how: Your bu&s;ine&s;s is never to re&s;t till you come to feel &s;in as an in&s;upportable burden, and then to find re&s;t and everla&s;ting &s;atisfaction in Chri&s;t, imbracing him as your own! To go on humbling to be humbled, and to &s;ee &s;uch intollerable evil in &s;in; and be &s;o bur|dened with the wrath of God lying upon you for it, as it may make &s;in everla&s;tingly odious to you, and force you to fly for refuge to lay hold of the hope &s;et before you; and to have &s;trong Con&s;ola|tion there! This is a great thing, not ea&s;ily and quickly gotten; but &s;it not down at quiet, till you

come to this! This is the way to make all &s;ure! But you will &s;ay I know not whether I ever had any true humiliation; whether there is any thing in me that will &s;tand by me, when an hour of Temptation comes? Therefore now re&s;olve, I will padle &amp; dally with God &amp; my own &s;oul no longer, I will never give God re&s;t till He &s;hew me things really, &amp; till I have attained that &s;en&s;e of &s;in, and Faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, which is real and effectual! This is the work of our lives, <HI>Job.</HI> 6.29. Let me ne|ver re&s;t till it be put out of all doubt, that God in Chri&s;t is mine own, and hath made an everla&s;ting Covenant with me! This I will have, or I will be in bitterne&s;s before the Lord while I have any Being; and for the re&s;idue of my days, I will dwell with them that lye down in &s;orrow, I will have my &s;ociety with &s;uch for&s;aken &s;ouls; who being de&s;olate &amp; de&s;erted, are free among the dead: If the ble&s;&s;ed God &s;hall excommunicate this wretch|ed Soul from His gracious pre&s;ence, [which yet is but an Act of His mo&s;t Holy &amp; Ju&s;t &s;everity] Oh! let me find this favour in his &s;ight, that I may al&s;o excommunicate my &s;elf from the plea&s;ures &amp; en|joyment of this pre&s;ent World! And re&s;olve this, If God will not let me &s;ee the good of his cho&s;en, [and I have nothing to &s;ay why He &s;hould] I will mourn, I will mourn; let me live &amp; dye in the hou&s;e of Mourning! If God will not Comfort me, nothing el&s;e &s;hall, if I may not have peace &amp; re&s;t in God, I'le have none at all; if God will take no plea&s;ure in me, I'le take no plea&s;ure in my &s;elf:

And let your &s;or|rows &amp; &s;en&s;e of your Souls mi&s;eries lie deep &amp; under|mo&s;t, &s;o as you may recall them in their &s;ea&s;on; when you come to pray, or be alone with God again; la|bour to have a con&s;tant habitual feeling of your &s;elf, [and get as many good thoughts &amp; affections as you can, at all times] &s;o as it may be livelily actual, e&s;pecially in your &s;ea&s;ons of attending upon God; and in them drive on the bu&s;ine&s;s of your Soul, as if there were no World; and as if there were nothing el&s;e to be minded but that. And if you find your heart gone when the &s;ea&s;on of &s;eeking God comes; then know that you have in &s;ome mea&s;ure back&s;lid|den and for&s;aken God; and never leave till you have recovered it. Recall &amp; review often the chief &s;ins of your life that you can remember, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> ag|gravate
<PB N="13" REF="002055_0013_0FBA8800B3E08868">
gravate them before God in a &s;pecial manner, [but have your times of confe&s;&s;ing &amp; bewailing all the &s;ins that ever you can remember] &amp; think of what &s;ins or cour&s;e it was that cau&s;ed God to leave you, to this woful impenitency of heart, &amp; bewail them bitterly. One thing more I mu&s;t add; Do not think it much to have &s;ome &s;pecial &s;ea&s;ons of &s;eeking God, be&s;ides tho&s;e I have named. If you had a friend with whom you might now &amp; then &s;pend a little time in conferring together, in opening your hearts, &amp; pre&s;enting your unutterable groanings before God; it would be of excellent u&s;e: Such an one would greatly &s;trengthen, be&s;tead, and further you in your way to Heaven. Spend now &amp; then [as occa&s;ions will permit] an hour [or &s;o] with &s;uch a friend more than ordinary, [&s;ome|times a piece of a day, &s;ometimes a whole day of ex|traordinary fa&s;t, in &s;triving &amp; wre&s;tling with God for everla&s;ting mercy.] And be much in quickning Conference, giving &amp; taking mutual encouragements and directions in the matters of Heaven! Oh! the life of God that falls into the hearts of the Godly, in and by gracious Heavenly Conference. Be open-hearted one to another, and &s;tand one for another again&s;t the Devil &amp; all his Angels. Make it thus your bu&s;ine&s;s in the&s;e &amp; &s;uch like ways, to provide for Eternity, while it is called to day, looking to Je&s;us the Author and fini&s;her of your Faith. But you will &s;ay [it may be] and I &s;peak but what I have found in my own heart, [Dear &mdash; I deal plainly with you, as I know you would have me do, and therefore let me &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be &s;aid] This is a tedious hard task, and my heart likes not to be &s;o yoaked and toiled in
<PB N="14" REF="002055_0014_0FBA88052E6C6258">
&s;uch things: I can take no plea&s;ure therein; and if I &s;hould force my &s;elf to it for a while, yet it would &s;oon weary me: I have no heart to the&s;e things; it may be &s;omething might be done in this way, or a|nother might do &s;omething: but I have no heart to it.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. Wonder not at this, nor think the wor&s;e of that cour&s;e, becau&s;e your heart lu&s;teth again&s;t it; but think the better of it. For, the better any thing is, and the more in&s;trumental for our Salvation; the more it is oppo&s;ed by our vile hearts, which are ene|mies to God, &amp; con&s;equently to our own chief good.</P>
<P N="2">2. Confe&s;s to God this naughtine&s;s of your heart: be&s;eech him to help you again&s;t this Devil, to change your nature, and let this occa&s;ion you to &s;ee &amp; loath the wickedne&s;s of your nature, and be inraged again&s;t it. <HI>The &s;pirit that dwelleth in us lusteth unto envy, but he giveth more grace</HI>; Jam. 4.5, 6.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>ly.</HI> Con&s;ider what is the rea&s;on why this way &s;eems &s;o irk&s;ome &amp; tedious and you have no heart to it? Is it not becau&s;e of inward blindne&s;s &amp; &s;ecu|rity? becau&s;e you &s;ee not things as they be, nor the weight &amp; worth of them? It is an irk&s;ome thing to a man to ri&s;e out of his bed in the Night, when he lies warm, &amp; knows no danger, nor urgent occa&s;ion to ri&s;e: but if he awake, and &s;ee, his hou&s;e on fire about his ears, he will make no demur about the mat|ter, but be glad he may ri&s;e! Verily, one real glimp&s;e of the wrath of God burning about us, or of Eternity that is a coming; one real glimp&s;e of Gods Anger [lying upon our Souls] which is infinitely above the mo&s;t awful apprehen&s;ion of Man or Angel; Oh! this would make us skip at a time to pray in, at an
<PB N="15" REF="002055_0015_0FBA880873B7D670">
hour to cry out to God for Mercy in, e&s;pecially if we might do it with any hope of being heard, and &s;aved; as now we may. So that the rea&s;on why I have no heart to this cour&s;e, is not becau&s;e there is want of rea|&s;on to per&s;wade me, but becau&s;e I am blind; and I feel my blindne&s;s, I know that I do not &s;ee things as they be, and therefore I have good rea&s;on to be deaf, to the Coun|&s;el of mine own blind ignorant heart, and to &s;trive by all means to &s;ee better; and in the mean time, to believe what I do not &s;ee.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>ly.</HI> Offer violence therefore to the Kingdom of Hea|ven, and be re&s;olved in this point; let my heart &s;ay what it will, let Hell &amp; World be again&s;t me: My God I mu&s;t have! my God I will have! I mu&s;t get &s;ight of &s;in, and faith in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; I mu&s;t make my Salvation &s;ure, or el&s;e I am undone for ever; and therefore pray I will, and follow God I will, in de&s;pite of the Devil: Unto him will I look, and [in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this] on him will I wait, who giveth the &s;ame &s;pirit of zeal, of indignation again&s;t &s;in &amp; &s;elf, as &s;ometimes was in holy <HI>Samuel,</HI> when he hewed <HI>Agag</HI> in pieces before the Lord in <HI>Gil<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">.</HI> Lord, thou ha&s;t commanded me <HI>to &s;eek thy face, and thy face will I &s;eek:</HI> I will not confer with fle&s;h and blood; I will not con&s;ult with Carnal rea&s;on; but what God bids me do, that will I do, and do it with all my might.</P>
<P N="5">5<HI>ly.</HI> Know that if you Con&s;cionably attend upon God, he will by degrees make it &s;weet &amp; ea&s;ie to you: He will &s;trengthen your heart &amp; hands in your way &amp; work, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 40.31. You will find it a &s;weet &amp; ble&s;&s;ed thing to &s;tand Confe&s;&s;ing your &s;ins before God, and emptying your heart in his &s;ight, opening all your Complaints &amp; Soul-Concernments to him: You will find it an happine&s;s that you may pray to the God of Heaven, and have any Communion with him. Our wicked hearts make reli|gious duties irk&s;ome; el&s;e they are in them&s;elves the &s;weete&s;t things in the World: Oh! if ever we come to

know God aright, we &s;hall account it our happine&s;s that we may do any thing, in way of Service to him, and Communion with him.</P>
<P N="6">6<HI>th.</HI> Salvation is worth all our labour, be it what it will be: Is it a trifle to be &s;aved Eternally? Do we think to get Heaven by a good wi&s;h? or to go thither in a Fea|ther-bed? No, God will make us &s;trive, &amp; &s;weat, and wre&s;tle for it; and be &s;ure it will quit the Co&s;t! It will never repent us of any Prayer we have made, or tear we have wept, when we come there! Oh! follow not the gui&s;e of this &s;ecure World, that [in the&s;e days] is ca&s;t into a dead &s;leep: Many profe&s;s, but few know what it is to work out their own Salvation with fear &amp; trembling. It is another matter to be a Chri&s;tian indeed, than mo&s;t make of it: And of tho&s;e that are &s;incere &amp; lively, you &s;ee but their dark-&s;ide, you know not what they are in &s;ecret: Follow not example, but follow the Word of God.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you the &s;um of my thoughts, accor|ding to my mea&s;ure &amp; manner. I be&s;eech you make &s;ome u&s;e of this poor Letter, and read it at &s;uch times as may mo&s;t &s;uit you&punc; You may have many doubts &amp; difficulties that I do not here touch; but &s;eek God, &amp; he will guide you. As for your outward Condition, follow on in the&s;e things, &amp; your trouble for &s;in &amp; &s;oul mi&s;ery, will &s;wallow up all other troubles; and future Con&s;olations will &s;weeten all: And what&s;oever may happen to you here, yet hereafter it &s;hall be well with you, and in your weari&s;ome pilgrimage it may be for a Con&s;olation to you, that you &s;hall rejoyce in time to come.</P>
<P>Now the Tender Mercies of God be with you, [Dear &mdash;] and the Lord lead you by the hand to his Eternal re&s;t, thro' all &s;ins &amp; &s;orrows, to his own Glory, and your everla&s;ting Comfort: So I remain,</P>
