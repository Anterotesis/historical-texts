<P>THE American Philo&s;ophical Society offered la&s;t year, among other premiums, one of an hun|dred dollars "for the be&s;t Sy&s;tem of liberal Edu|cation and literary in&s;truction, adapted to the ge|nius of the Government of the United States; comprehending al&s;o a plan for in&s;tituting and con|ducting public &s;chools in this country, on princi|ples of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive utility"&mdash;They re&s;erved to them&s;elves, however, the right of giving, in all ca&s;es, &s;uch part only of my premium propo&s;ed, as the performance &s;hould be adjudged to de&s;erve; or of withholding the whole, if it &s;hould appear to have no merit above what may have been be|fore publi&s;hed on the &s;ubject.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following pages were written in the &s;um|mer of 1796. They are pre&s;ented to the public with only a few verbal alterations, as they were then written. New ideas have &s;ince occurred to the author, and tho&s;e which are contained in the e&s;&s;ay might, in many in&s;tances, have been better expre&s;&s;ed. But as the production, as it now ap|pears, received the premium, it was thought im|proper to make any &s;ub&s;tantial additions.</P>
<P>As this performance may be read by &s;ome per|&s;ons unacquainted with the author, it may be pro|per to &s;tate that he neither claims the reverence due to age, nor the re&s;pect attached to e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation&mdash;The fewne&s;s of his years preclude the former, while his moderate attainments withhold the latter. If the efforts which he has made &s;hall excite the genius of his fellow-citizens, and he &s;hall prove, in a degree however limited, the in|&s;trument of attracting the public attention to a &s;ubject of all others the mo&s;t momentous, he will be rewarded to the extent of his wi&s;hes.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE man, who a&s;pires to the honour of forming a &s;y&s;tem of education adapted to a republic, &s;hould either po&s;&s;e&s;s the capacity of original reflecti|on, or that of improving, without adopting, the ideas of others. His hatred to vice, and aver&s;ion to error, &s;hould be as &s;trong, as his attachment to virtue, and love of truth. He &s;hould look upon the &s;entiments of the dead with di&s;tru&s;t, and oppo&s;e with intrepi|dity the prejudices of the living. As the tribunal to which he appeals may be &s;hrouded in delu&s;ion, he mu&s;t have the courage to rend the veil that inter|cepts the light of truth. He mu&s;t con&s;ider the fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tions of his own mind as treacherous; nor &s;uffer them to form a link in his chain of rea|&s;oning, till they &s;hall have pa&s;&s;ed the ordeal of rei|terated inve&s;tigation. Having undergone this trial unimpaired, he will dare to hold them forth to truth, as her legitimate off&s;pring, and to prejudice, as her
<PB N="10" REF="034558_0008_0FFE28420E7FF1D0">
merited &s;courge. No motive can bear him through this arduous performance, but a &s;upreme &s;en&s;e of duty, which, feeling ample retribution from the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing good, neither &s;olicits nor de&s;pi|&s;es general applau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE two great objects of a correct education are to make men virtuous and wi&s;e.</P>
<P>THE terms virtuous and wi&s;e, do not &s;eem &s;u&s;|ceptible of ab&s;olute definition. Accordingly, as ap|plied to different per&s;ons, and varying circum&s;tan|ces, they pre&s;ent different a&s;pects; though it be po&s;|&s;ible, nay probable, that the elements or fir&s;t prin|ciples of each, however modified by endle&s;s combi|nation, are the &s;ame. This hypothe&s;is derives &s;ome confirmation from the great affinity of one virtue to another, and the clo&s;e alliance between the &s;everal departments of &s;cience and literature.</P>
<P>WITHOUT attempting preci&s;e definition, it may be &s;ufficiently correct, &s;o far as it regards the objects of this e&s;&s;ay, to &s;tyle VIRTUE that active exertion of our faculties, which, in the highe&s;t degree promotes our own happine&s;s and that of our fellow-men; and WISDOM, that intelligent principle, which improves our faculties, affords them the means of u&s;eful exer|tion, and determines the objects on which they are exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>WHILE wi&s;dom and virtue have united, time im|memorial, to panegyri&s;e each other in reference to the general good they produce in the world, two
<PB N="11" REF="034558_0009_0FFE27FEC0CA8B90">
que&s;tions of great importance have remained unde|cided; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>I. WHETHER wi&s;dom and virtue are in any degree nece&s;&s;arily connected; and if they are, whether univer&s;ally, or partially?</P>
<P>II. WHETHER wi&s;dom, in its greate&s;t practical exten&s;ion, would, if univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, produce the greate&s;t portion of general happine&s;s?</P>
<P>IT will be acknowledged that the&s;e points de&s;erve a patient di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as their deci&s;ion will determine the definite objects of education; and as it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary that man &s;hould know the <HI>objects</HI> he de&s;ires to accompli&s;h, before he can apply, with the pro&s;pect of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ful re&s;ult, the <HI>means</HI> adapted to &s;ecure them.</P>
<P>I. THE fir&s;t enquiry is, "Whether wi&s;dom and virtue are, in any degree, nece&s;&s;arily connected; and if they are, whether univer&s;ally, or partially?"</P>
<P>IT has been the opinion of &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed philo&s;ophers that virtue and in&s;tinct are the &s;ame; and that a wi&s;e providence has not left the direction of the moral principle under the capricious and fee|ble influence of rea&s;on: while others have contend|ed, that although man be by nature ignorant and entirely de&s;titute of moral principle, yet that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es faculties capable of high improvement, if not of perfection it&s;elf. Both the&s;e &s;y&s;tems, notwith|&s;tanding their numerous votaries, are probably founded in error.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="034558_0010_0FFE28451B85FD70">
IF in&s;tinct and virtue be &s;ynonimous, it is clear, that where there is mo&s;t in&s;tinct, there &s;hould be mo&s;t virtue, and that, as the brute creation po&s;&s;e&s;s in&s;tinct in a much higher degree than man, they mu&s;t likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s virtue in a higher degree. This re&s;ult will not be &s;eriou&s;ly contended for by any one. For, however ferocious and ignorant man may be, he is infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in the&s;e qualities by every animal that has the capacity of being fero|cious. In this contra&s;t too, it is proper to ob&s;erve, that, however the in&s;tinct of the brute may withhold him from doing injury, is &s;eldom, if ever, in&s;pires him with the ardour of doing good.</P>
<P>WERE in&s;tinct and virtue the &s;ame, it would be clear that the infant would be more virtuous than his fire, and the &s;avage inhabitant of the fore&s;t more virtuous than the off&s;pring of civilization and &s;ci|ence. For the ears of the infant are open to the voice of nature alone, while tho&s;e of its parent are not altogether regardle&s;s of the dictates of rea&s;on. A preci&s;e analogy exi&s;ts between the infant and its parent, and the &s;avage and civilized man; the mind of the &s;avage is &s;till in its infancy, while civiliza|tion, if the expre&s;&s;ion be allowed, imparts manhood to the mind.&mdash;If this point remain &s;till undecided in the mind of any, let it be a&s;ked, if the ideot or the lunatic are ever e&s;teemed virtuous? It will then be &s;een that virtue without rea&s;on is a phantom which never exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>THOSE, who would a&s;cribe every thing to rea&s;on and nothing to nature, probably adopted their ideas,
<PB N="13" REF="034558_0011_0FFE2800462CD750">
more from a conviction, that the rival &s;y&s;tem was fal&s;e, than from any di&s;tinct conviction of the truth of their own; and from that di&s;po&s;ition of the mind, which makes us readily, if not eagerly, embrace the rever&s;e of that which we have found to be errone|ous.</P>
<P>TO affirm that becau&s;e education does much, it can therefore accompli&s;h every thing, is to pro|nounce a maxim refuted by univer&s;al experience. Every circum&s;tance in this life partakes of a finite nature; and the power of education, however great, has doubtle&s;s its limits.</P>
<P>HOWEVER difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, it might be to gain the a&s;&s;ent of &s;ome philo&s;ophers to the &s;y&s;tem of natural inequality in reference to virtue or capa|city; they will, without he&s;itation, agree, that the phy&s;ical part of man is infinitely modified by nature; they will al&s;o grant, that an infinite variety &s;eems to be delighted in by the author of nature; and that this variety is mo&s;t di&s;played in tho&s;e works, which abound, in the highe&s;t degree, with qualities that excite our admiration or regard. Both the&s;e in&s;tances, borrowed from material objects, furni&s;h &s;triking analogies, illu&s;trative of the exi&s;|tence of variety of morality and intellect in diffe|rent minds uninfluenced by education. Is it to be believed that an object &s;o important, as variety ap|pears to be in the e&s;timation of the author of nature, &s;hould be left to the controul of cau&s;es, operating &s;o unequally, and in &s;o contracted a &s;phere, as rea|&s;on
<PB N="14" REF="034558_0012_0FFE28469ED5E3F0">
and civilization? Were it to depend entirely on the&s;e accidental circum&s;tance, might it not be highly endangered? Might it not be lo&s;t?</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome things, which, however contro|verted by the refinements of philo&s;ophy, will always continue to be held in &s;ecure belief by the good &s;en&s;e of mankind. Such is the conviction of natu|ral bia&s;s; of one per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing genius; another, fancy; a third, memory; &amp;c.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE deductions from this conci&s;e and nece&s;&s;arily &s;uperficial view of a &s;ubject, in &s;ome re&s;pects intri|cate, are, that nature is neither &s;o liberal, nor edu|cation &s;o omnipotent, as the rival &s;y&s;tems affirm; that man is indebted to both; that certain pa&s;&s;ions are born with him, which he cannot exterminate, but may control; that a varied capacity is imparted to him, which, by education he can weaken or im|prove. But, that &s;till the traces of nature are vi&s;i|ble in his thoughts and actions; and that her voice never cea&s;es to be heard amid&s;t all the refinements of art.</P>
<P>BUT even granting, what is far from being the truth, that man, unenlightened by education, has engraven upon his heart certain great principles of duty, and is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the means nece&s;&s;ary for their di&s;charge, it yet remains unconte&s;ted, that the&s;e principles are few and undefined; and that they do not comprehend half the relations in which men &s;tand towards each other. It follows, of cour&s;e,
<PB N="15" REF="034558_0013_0FFE2805FA69DF68">
that they mu&s;t be extended and improved, before they can an&s;wer the great purpo&s;es for which they were originally implanted in man, and &s;ubmitted to his guidance, modification and exten&s;ion.</P>
<P>BESIDES, it &s;hould never be forgotten in di&s;cu&s;&s;ions &s;imilar to this, that man is already in a great degree civilized; and that though it may be po&s;&s;ible for the &s;avage to re&s;i&s;t the force of improvement, and remain un&s;haken in his attachment to his original &s;tate, yet that man, once civilized, has it not in his power to return to his natural condition. He may overturn all the trophies of the arts, he may con&s;ign to the flames every ve&s;tige of &s;cience, he may extingui&s;h every &s;park of genius; but he is &s;till unable to re|duce him&s;elf to the &s;avage &s;tate. We behold him more deba&s;ed, perhaps, than the barbarian, but without his ferocity. The world abounds with &s;cenes in which the triumphs of &s;cience have been &s;ucceed|ed by the mo&s;t brutal ignorance; over which fear, meanne&s;s, and indolence have &s;pread their gloomy features; features the very oppo&s;ite of tho&s;e which characterize the &s;avage life.</P>
<P>WE cannot, therefore, err in a&s;&s;uming it as a fact that virtue and wi&s;dom are in &s;ome degree nece&s;&s;a|rily connected; that the crude wi&s;dom which nature be&s;tows is unequal to the production and govern|ment of virtue, &s;uch as man in his pur&s;uit of hap|pine&s;s di&s;covers it to be his intere&s;t to practice; and that to in&s;ure this de&s;irable object, it is nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="16" REF="034558_0014_0FFE284C5CB88230">
that the original faculties of the mind &s;hould be vi|gorou&s;ly exerci&s;ed, extended, and &s;trengthened.</P>
<P>IT &s;till remains to be con&s;idered whether wi&s;dom and virtue are partially or univer&s;ally connected.</P>
<P>IT is generally agreed that no being can be per|fectly good without being perfectly wi&s;e. Such is the &s;ublime idea we form of deity. It will be ob|&s;erved that perfect goodne&s;s is not here made to de|pend &s;olely on the <HI>intention</HI> of the agent, but al&s;o on the <HI>good effected;</HI> as we now con&s;ider virtue an efficient principle exerting all the energies of its nature.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;ertion that the man, who, without equall|ing this character, approaches it the neare&s;t, would partake in the highe&s;t degree of the divine excel|lence, might be deemed correct, were not the world full of examples of men, who, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of comprehen&s;ive powers of mind, are not only defici|ent in the exerci&s;e of virtue, but actually famed for the mo&s;t profligate indulgence in vice. This enigma, however, admits of ea&s;y &s;olution. Great endowments of mind are &s;o rare, that they are &s;el|dom di&s;played without exciting more envy than at|tachment. He, who not only admires but e&s;teems another for his talents, mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s no incon&s;idera|ble portion of talent him&s;elf; ju&s;t as the be&s;t evi|dence of a &s;upreme love of virtue is a high regard for the &s;ource of all virtue. The cla&s;s of men po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e qualities being &s;mall, and that po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="17" REF="034558_0015_0FFE280780ED32A8">
of different, if not ho&s;tile qualities, being very numerous, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that re&s;entment and malice &s;hould be active in their efforts to cru&s;h &s;o formidable an adver&s;ary. Thus the mo&s;t unworthy means are u&s;ed to nip in the bud talents qualified to enlarge the &s;phere of human happine&s;s.</P>
<P>HUMAN virtue has its limits. To be the object of uncea&s;ing calumny and detraction, without &s;ighing for vengeance, would argue an apathy of heart by no means mortal. The &s;ubject of oppre&s;&s;ion, has now, in his turn, recour&s;e to tho&s;e means, which had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;fully applied to his ruin; and finding them &s;ucce&s;&s;ful, he throws away the crutch of truth for the &s;taff of deception. Cea&s;ing to feel an intere&s;t in that virtue which he had ju&s;t &s;een &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, his ambition gra&s;ps objects which bring with them immediate gratification, and lull the con|&s;cience to a dangerous repo&s;e. Wealth, power, and plea&s;ure, throw out their gay and &s;plendid &s;olicitati|ons, and virtue is exiled from the heart in which it lately delighted to dwell.</P>
<P>THIS would not be the ca&s;e, if virtue and talents were as common as vice and ignorance. The mo|ment a majority enli&s;t them&s;elves on the &s;ide of the former marks the aera of their eternal reign. This aera is that which all good and great men &s;hould unite to ha&s;ten.</P>
<P>FROM a review of hi&s;tory, it will appear, that ju&s;t in proportion to the cultivation of &s;cience and the
<PB N="18" REF="034558_0016_0FFE284DDE767E10">
arts has the happine&s;s of man advanced in the nati|on which cultivated them. And this aro&s;e in a great mea&s;ure from this con&s;ideration. The wants of na|ture are few in its unimproved &s;tate. Man of cour&s;e is exempt from the nece&s;&s;ity of making any great ef|forts for his &s;upport. He is therefore indolent. Not dependent on another, for any thing which his heart holds dear, he is re&s;erved, di&s;tant, unaccom|modating in his deportment. He &s;carcely merits the epithet of a &s;ocial being. Of cour&s;e, if his vices are not numerous, his virtues are &s;till le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P>THE very rever&s;e of this takes place as &s;ociety im|proves. The deare&s;t part of man's happine&s;s, in this &s;tage of his exi&s;tence, is connected with a &s;up|ply of articles, which depend on the indu&s;try of one, who is alike dependent on him. Hence a re|ciprocity of wants! Hence the origin of new and permanent regards, the parents of a thou&s;and now virtues! From what &s;ource do the&s;e proceed, but from the developement of rea&s;on, &s;ugge&s;ting to man the improvement of his &s;ituation? This improve|ment &s;eems &s;u&s;ceptible of endle&s;s exten&s;ion. Hence the conclu&s;ion, that rea&s;on in alliance with virtue admits of progre&s;&s;ion without termination, and that the purity of the la&s;t is be&s;t &s;ecured by the &s;trength of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>WE proceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>II. WHETHER wi&s;dom it&s;elf, in its greate&s;t exten|&s;ion, would, if univer&s;ally diffu&s;ed, produce the greate&s;t portion of general happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="034558_0017_0FFE280902A932B8">
THE affirmative &s;ide of this que&s;tion will be il|lu&s;trated by con&s;idering;</P>
<P>THAT the diffu&s;ion of knowledge actually produ|ces &s;ome virtues, which without it would have no exi&s;tence, and that it &s;trengthens and extends all &s;uch virtues as are generally deemed to have, in a limited degree, an exi&s;tence independent of un|common attainments. And that,</P>
<P>THE exerci&s;e of the&s;e virtues is the only certain means of &s;ecuring real happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE virtues, which are the exclu&s;ive and appro|priate off&s;pring of an enlightened under&s;tanding, are tho&s;e which are di&s;connected with any particu|lar time, per&s;on, or place. Exi&s;ting without refe|rence to the&s;e, a &s;pirit of univer&s;al philanthropy is in&s;pired, that views the whole world as a &s;ingle fa|mily, and tran&s;fers to it the feelings of regard which are indulged towards the mo&s;t amiable of our ac|quaintance. This &s;entiment, free from the alloy of per&s;onal con&s;ideration, or national attachment, lifts the mind to an elevation infinitely &s;uperior to the &s;en&s;ation of individual regard, &s;uperior to the ardent feelings of patrioti&s;m, and rivals, in a mea|&s;ure, the enjoyment of the &s;ublime ideas we con|nect with the apprehen&s;ion of the divine mind. This tone of mind mu&s;t acknowledge congeniality with the noble&s;t virtues. The mind is full and yet tranquil. The turbulence of pa&s;&s;ion is &s;ubdued in|to a reverence of rea&s;on. Man feels him&s;elf too en|nobled
<PB N="20" REF="034558_0018_0FFE284F6224CC88">
to do a ba&s;e or a mean thing. He yields to an irre&s;i&s;tible enthu&s;ia&s;m to atchieve whatever unites the highe&s;t portion of greatne&s;s with the large&s;t por|tion of goodne&s;s. Language is inadequate to the de&s;cription of the feelings of a man thus in&s;pired; it ha&s;tens to his actions, which can receive only a feeble delineation.</P>
<P>IT will be found &s;till more unequivocally, that a diffu&s;ion of knowledge &s;trengthens and extends all &s;uch virtues as have in a limited degree an exi&s;tence, independent of uncommon attainments. This cla&s;s of virtues comprehends tho&s;e which are created by the relation in which one man &s;tands to another, and which are the ba&s;is of what may be denominated common duty.</P>
<P>THE di&s;cretion with which man is ve&s;ted implies the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome knowledge. Were it not for this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he would be the &s;port of ca&s;ualty and accident. He would nominally be his own ma&s;ter, but really a &s;lave to &s;ome unknown power.</P>
<P>NATURE appears to have been liberal in its endow|ments to mo&s;t of her off&s;pring, as far as re&s;pects the pre&s;ervation of each &s;pecies; but to have been lea&s;t liberal in this re&s;pect to man; doubtle&s;s becau&s;e &s;he has lavi&s;hed her bounty in imparting to him alone the capacity of gradual and large improvement.</P>
<P>THE doctrine of original depravity here affords a forcible illu&s;tration. It is not material to decide
<PB N="21" REF="034558_0019_0FFE280D68BDA448">
whether this belief be correctly true in the extent to which &s;ome writers have carried it; or whether the alleged depravity be a crime, or only a defect. It is &s;ufficient that &s;uch a belief almo&s;t univer&s;ally prevails, and that all mankind acknowledge the va&s;t intermediate &s;pace that lies between the barrenne&s;s of the &s;tate of nature, and the improvement effected by a liberal education. This general opinion of man|kind is alike authoritative in regard to virtue as well as rea&s;on.

<P>ALL agree that virtue can never be carried too far. But does not the truth of this remark depend entirely upon the manner in which virtue is direct|ed, or more properly, perhaps, on an accurate de|finition of it? If this be true, will not the greate&s;t portion of virtue be a&s;cribed to the man, who, with given means, accompli&s;hes the mo&s;t good? And is not this the &s;ame with &s;aying that virtue in its high|e&s;t exerci&s;e requires the greate&s;t attainments? If it be enquired what the&s;e attainments &s;hould be, it may be replied that, as all knowledge is &s;u&s;cepti|ble of practical application, and is abu&s;ed when it does not receive &s;uch application, it is improper to fix any limits to the improvement of the mind, which in proportion to its exten&s;ion is qualified to effect general good.</P>

<P>THE duties of men are preci&s;ely co-exten&s;ive with their knowledge.

It is true that he who&s;e years revolve in acquiring, without u&s;ing, learning, is even more &s;elfi&s;h and criminal than the mi&s;er, as he hoards from &s;ociety a greater good; and, in this view of the &s;ubject, what Bacon &s;ays is &s;trictly ju&s;t;</P>

the mind to one branch of knowledge, in&s;tead of enlarging, will impair it. In&s;tead of furni&s;hing it with truth, it will burthen it with error. Of this tendency Locke relates &s;everal whim&s;ical in|&s;tances.</P>

between duty and intere&s;t: rendered more cap|tivating by their borrowing a new character from the liberal &s;pirit in&s;pired by rea&s;on. To the natural tie of parental regard would be added the grateful &s;en|&s;ation excited in the mind of a child from the com|munication of new ideas, and the production, of cour&s;e, of new plea&s;ures. To the magic of in&s;tinct would be &s;uperadded the charm of reflection.</P>
<P>THE &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice and hone&s;ty would be con|firmed by the folly of inju&s;tice and di&s;hone&s;ty.

<P>PATRIOTISM, a virtue which has fertilized the bar|ren rock and given the greate&s;t expan&s;ion to the mind and the heart, would become a &s;teady and a rational principle. Founded on an unprejudiced attachment to country, we &s;hould cea&s;e to glory in error, &s;olely becau&s;e it proceeded from our ance&s;|tors.

<P>IT remains to be con&s;idered, whether the exer|ci&s;e of the enumerated virtues, be not the only mean of &s;ecuring real happine&s;s.</P>
<P>No nece&s;&s;ity is believed to exi&s;t, to prove, that a &s;y&s;tem of pure &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is ho&s;tile in the highe&s;t de|gree to happine&s;s.

<P><PB N="27" REF="034558_0025_0FFE281618F94F80">
WHETHER rea&s;on it&s;elf would be fertile in the production of virtue need not be decided. It is pro|bable that rea&s;on is only that power which directs the pa&s;&s;ions to their fit objects, and determines the force with which they ought to be applied. Rou&s;|&s;eau &s;ays, <Q>It is by the activity of our pa&s;&s;ions, that our rea&s;on improves; we covet knowledge merely becau&s;e we court enjoyment, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive, why a man exempt from fears and de&s;ires &s;hould take the trouble to rea&s;on. The pa&s;&s;ions, in their turn, owe their origin to our wants.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rou&s;&s;eau on Inequality of mankind, 8 vo. Edit. p. 40.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ions, as imparted by nature, are few, but impetuous. The whole energy of the &s;oul here &s;peaks in every word and action. The conduct of one individual to another, in proportion as man ob|tains a more correct knowledge of duty, becomes the &s;ubject of a certain portion, often a moderate one, of prai&s;e or blame, of reward or puni&s;h|ment. And, accordingly, civilized man is as cautious in pronouncing an opinion on the conduct of the per&s;on who invites his &s;trictures, as unbridled pa&s;&s;ion is impetuous and ra&s;h. The la&s;t knows no gradations between virtue and vice, and of cour&s;e loves or hates in the extreme&s;t degree. The con&s;e|quence is, that man is mi&s;erable; as mi&s;erable per|haps from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of ill directed ven|geance or mi&s;applied regard, as from the &s;en&s;e of unde&s;erved re&s;entment.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="034558_0026_0FFE285B396A8450">
IN proportion to the advancement of the arts and &s;ciences, the pa&s;&s;ions are increa&s;ed in number, and abridged in force, by the diver&s;ity of objects which &s;olicit their exerci&s;e. Man, reduced from a &s;ullen &s;tate of independence, becomes the &s;ubject of innu|merable wants, the centre of innumerable plea&s;ures. Avarice, &s;o congenial to ignorance and indolence, is robbed of more than half is violence by the love of plea&s;ure, and a regard to popular opinion. It never fails to be as much weakened in the vortex of activity, as it is cheri&s;hed in the li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;eclu|&s;ion. In large commercial towns there are few mi|&s;ers. In mona&s;teries they abound. Be&s;ides the am|bition of acquiring more keep afloat immen&s;e rich|es, which circulate till they become the inheri|tance of an heir, who &s;eldom feels a di&s;po&s;ition to hoard them.</P>
<P>PITY is &s;aid by &s;ome writers to be the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion of nature. But how does it operate?&mdash;Upon every object it meets. Accident accompli&s;hes every thing. Entirely mechanical, it as frequently encou|rages vice, as it relieves virtue. Whereas knowledge produces di&s;cernment and di&s;crimination. The benevolence of an improved mind is virtue, becau&s;e it aids merit in di&s;tre&s;s; natural pity is often vice, becau&s;e it is blind, and as frequently a&s;&s;i&s;ts the wicked as the good; perhaps oftener, as virtue is more aver&s;e to &s;olicitation than vice.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider the different effects of pity and benevolence, as here di&s;tingui&s;hed, on the per&s;on
<PB N="29" REF="034558_0027_0FFE2817E13868E8">
who exerci&s;es them. Pity is a mere natural impul&s;e; there is no merit in obeying its voice; the good which it does is forgotten as &s;oon as accompli&s;hed; all the happine&s;s it affords is confined to a moment, and this is an unreflecting happine&s;s; it is the hap|pine&s;s of an infant.&mdash;Benevolence, on the contrary, is never practi&s;ed without reflection. It choo&s;es its objects with care, which when cho&s;en it is liberal in rewarding. It does not give to depravity the debt due to virtue, and thereby generate &s;elf-reproach. Virtue and merit are its creditors, to whom it ever &s;truggles to be ju&s;t. Gratitude, almo&s;t unknown to the di&s;pen&s;er of pity, is the off&s;pring of benevolence. Remembrance recals, perhaps heightens, the plea|&s;ures excited by the good effected; and he, who is actuated by enlightened benevolence, is amply re|warded by his own feelings, independently of the treatment he may receive from the object of his bounty, or the propitious influence of his actions on his future peace.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame remarks, illu&s;trating the difference be|tween the pa&s;&s;ions of the ignorant and the wi&s;e, might be exten&s;ively applied with but little variation. Suffice it in addition to &s;ay that with the wi&s;e, in|clination is &s;upplanted by duty, caprice by con&s;i&s;t|ency. Emulation and competition too come in with all their forces, and, perhaps, produce more virtue in the world than they found in it. [Note D.]</P>
<P>HE who has been accu&s;tomed to feel within him|&s;elf the re&s;ource of reflection, and the capacity of
<PB N="30" REF="034558_0028_0FFE285F912A41B0">
improvement, delights in ab&s;tracting his attention from grovelling pur&s;uits, and in di&s;engaging him&s;elf from the &s;ordid cares of low occupation. However impo&s;&s;ible it be for him entirely to withdraw him|&s;elf from the&s;e engagements, yet he always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an unexhau&s;ted trea&s;ure, on which he may draw, when oppre&s;&s;ed with them. Neither the mind nor the body &s;eem de&s;igned for one uniform employ|ment. The more exten&s;ive the objects, therefore, within the reach of man, the larger is his circle of enjoyment. Hi&s;tory enforces the truth of this re|mark. Who more happy as well as di&s;tingui&s;hed, than they who alternately exchanged the plough for the clo&s;et; who now procured food for the body, and now &s;ought food for the mind? Who more unri|valled in tranquil plea&s;ure, in unambitious retire|ment, in &s;plendid con&s;ideration, than Cincinnatus?</P>
<P>THAT man &s;eems, on the whole, to be the mo&s;t happy, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a large &s;tock of ideas, is in the con&s;tant habit of encrea&s;ing them, and whom every hour of his exi&s;tence renders more informed. The energy of &s;uch a mind is almo&s;t without limits; it admits of con&s;tant activity; for when fatigued with one train of ideas, it finds repo&s;e in another. A rich variety of enjoyment is ever before it, the bare con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing which is &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to make it happy.</P>
<P>SOME notice is due to the objections to the con|nection between knowledge and happine&s;s. It is &s;aid that a refinement of ideas di&s;inclines the mind
<PB N="31" REF="034558_0029_0FFE281D8E79EAD8">
to an attention to common objects, to which a very moderate degree of reflection is equal. This objec|tion, if it has any pre&s;ent force at all, would be wholly removed by that knowledge becoming common which is now rare. We now find it to be the gene|ral exclamation that pro&s;perity is altogether owing to accident, and this remark is &s;anctioned, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the concurrence of the wi&s;e as well as the uninformed. This ari&s;es from the imperfection of human knowledge, whereby men obtain a good de&s;ired, not through the fit means as di&s;covered by rea&s;on, but as &s;ugge&s;ted by accident. Hence the in|clination is &s;o often repugnant to availing it&s;elf of the means of acquiring a de&s;irable object, that it is frequently coerced into them, contrary to its wi&s;hes. Hence the affairs of the world are called a lottery, where fortune pre&s;ides, and rea&s;on is blind.</P>
<P>As, however, every effect is in&s;eparable from its cau&s;e, and as the events of this life, which men mo&s;t covet, depend upon cau&s;es, which the improv|ed mind without doubt po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of di&s;co|vering, the time may and probably will arrive, in which by far the greater part, if not the whole, of tho&s;e things, at pre&s;ent the gift of accident, will be the reward of virtue and reflection. It will then be as great a phenomenon for wi&s;dom not to be &s;uc|ceeded by pro&s;perity, as it is now to be connected with it, even in reference to tho&s;e objects which it ever will deem &s;ubordinate.</P>

ONE philo&s;opher of great di&s;tinction, it is grant|ed, has &s;aid that were man to con&s;ult his real happi|ne&s;s, he would never reflect; intimating that the act of reflection is injurious to health. This asper|&s;ion on &s;cience can be traced, as it regards Rou&s;&s;eau, to no better origin, than that of a mind, incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and di&s;contented with every pre&s;ent en|joyment. The mind of Rou&s;&s;eau was, without doubt, a great one; it emitted, as copiou&s;ly as geni|us or fancy could de&s;ire, the &s;parks of a noble in|tellect, which dared to di&s;dain the &s;hackles of preju|dice, and break the chains of ignorance. But it mu&s;t be allowed, that in tho&s;e ca&s;es which admitted of per&s;onal application, he gro&s;sly erred, and ge|nerally &s;uffered his &s;trong &s;en&s;e to be overruled by his inexplicable feelings. Complete refutation, how|ever, will be the portion of this injurious remark, by con&s;idering the per&s;evering zeal, which has cha|racterized the conduct of the cultivators of &s;cience; by con&s;idering their unanimous opinion that the moment which gives birth to a new thought is a period of unrivalled enjoyment, which has been compared to the feelings of deity at the creation; [Note E.] and la&s;tly, by con&s;idering that longevity has, in a remarkable degree, been the reward of tho&s;e, who have cultivated &s;cience. Let any one, who doubts this fact, con&s;ult a biographical dictiona|ry, and all the prejudices he ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject mu&s;t vani&s;h; he will grant that as the mind depends on the exerci&s;e of the body for its vigor, &s;o the health of the body, in its turn, is promoted

by the active employment of the faculties of the mind.</P>
<P>ONE great objection cannot be here overlooked; its di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is highly important from its connecti|on with numerous prejudices, and particularly with the pa&s;&s;ion of avarice. It will be &s;aid that though refined happine&s;s be intimately connected with vir|tue and knowledge, yet that this kind of happine&s;s was never de&s;igned for the ma&s;s of any nation, as their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depends entirely on labour, and the productivene&s;s of labour depends on the time devoted to it.</P>
<P>IT only requires a zealous di&s;po&s;ition to embrace <HI>what ought to be,</HI> in&s;tead of clinging to <HI>what is,</HI> to di&s;arm this objection of all its force. It is granted that a &s;mall portion of that time, which is at pre&s;ent occupied by the labour of the body, will, &s;hould the&s;e ideas be adopted, be ab&s;orbed in the exerci&s;e of the mind. But it &s;hould be ob&s;erved;</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT it is not true, as implied in the objecti|on, that the mind and body are incapable of con|temporaneous employment. So far is this from being a fact, that &s;ome activity of body is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to vigorous reflection. The more &s;evere the reflection, the more likely is the &s;tudent to be involved in even involuntary exerci&s;e. Viewing this objection with the greate&s;t partiality, it can only apply to tho&s;e &s;tudies that require the highe&s;t ab&s;traction of mind, which will forever be confined
<PB N="34" REF="034558_0032_0FFE2866C3B43E00">
to a few. Tho&s;e trains of thought, which are con|nected with practical improvement, will be aided rather than impaired by labour, if it be not un|commonly &s;evere.</P>
<P N="2">2. The actual labour nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;i&s;t man is much le&s;s than that which occupies the whole of his time. The hours at pre&s;ent devoted to labour are about twelve. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e to be abridged by bringing them down to ten. A que&s;tion occurs whe|ther this diminution of time will le&s;&s;en the ma&s;s of articles of nece&s;&s;ity or convenience fabricated?&mdash;The &s;olution of this que&s;tion either affirmatively or negatively is of little con&s;equence, though from the fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;tions of the mind it would &s;eem impor|tant. It is not probable it would produce the dimi|nution &s;uppo&s;ed; becau&s;e ten hours of active labour may in their re&s;ult be equal to twelve; as there is a protraction of labour de&s;tructive of all energy. This is &s;o abundantly illu&s;trated in the ca&s;e of &s;laves, compared with freemen, that the fact needs only to be mentioned to be deci&s;ive; but yielding for a mo|ment that ten hours of manual labour will not pro|duce &s;o much as twelve, will not more be gained by improved modes of labour, than is lo&s;t by this dereliction of two hours? Will not the habit of reflec|tion and progre&s;&s;ive improvement continually devi&s;e new means of accompli&s;hing a given object? Have not the powers of machinery already given a new creation to manufactures? And is not agriculture equally &s;u&s;ceptible of improvement?</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="034558_0033_0FFE282091E89840">
BUT granting that this abridgment of labour would dimini&s;h the articles of u&s;e, is it unequivocal that this effect would be an evil? The nece&s;&s;aries of life would &s;till be produced in abundance. The con|veniencies of life produced would be fully equal to a moderate indulgence of its plea&s;ures. The only deficiency exi&s;ting would apply to articles of luxury. And whether the&s;e ought to be encouraged or re|pre&s;&s;ed cannot be a que&s;tion in a &s;tate of &s;ociety in which every man is a candidate for equal happine&s;s. An indulgence in luxury is a &s;elfi&s;h enjoyment, which may be &s;aid to &s;educe every one from his du|ty. The le&s;s, therefore, it prevails, the better for virtue and general happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE relative wealth of individuals, under this arrangement, would remain the &s;ame with that un|der the old one, as far as it applied to the citizens of the United States. Some &s;mall difference might be produced between the relative wealth of the United States and that of foreign nations; but its effects &s;eem too unimportant to be dwelt on.</P>
<P>LET us, then, con&s;ider a moderate increa&s;e of the hours of reflection, and a &s;mall decrea&s;e of tho&s;e of labour, as a leading feature in a &s;y&s;tem of republican education.

<P>I. <HI>THE time fit to be devoted to education.</HI></P>
<P>PHILOSOPHY, which is but another word for experience, has decided the happine&s;s of man to de|pend upon the labour of the body and the exerci&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="034558_0036_0FFE2869CA59F2B8">
of the mind. It had been well for mankind, had the human race in its earlie&s;t age been under the control of principles of legi&s;lation, which by a ju|dicious apportionment of the hours of reflection to tho&s;e of labour, had produced in infancy and youth habits de&s;tined from their &s;trength to remain unim|paired in advanced age. Had the voice of philo&s;o|phy dictated &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, it would have been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on the&s;e principles. Bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence re|quires certain articles, which are the product of la|bour. The&s;e are nece&s;&s;aries of life, and mu&s;t be obtained by labour. Convenience demands a fur|ther &s;upply, the furni&s;hing of which would occupy an additional period of labour. This convenience is e&s;&s;entially connected with happine&s;s, mental as well as corporeal. Labour would, therefore, have been called upon to &s;ati&s;fy the claims of nece&s;&s;ity and convenience; it would have been un&s;educed by the allurements of luxury.</P>
<P>UNFORTUNATELY for mankind no &s;uch &s;y&s;tem has been adopted. It has &s;carcely even been thought of. The novelty of the plan forms no objection to its truth. If it po&s;&s;e&s;s decided advantages, let us dare to believe human virtue equal to its accompli&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een that in a nation, in which the hours of labour &s;hould be abridged, and tho&s;e of reflection increa&s;ed, no injury would be &s;u&s;tained by individuals, and little, if any, by the nation it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="034558_0037_0FFE282949510E38">
IT were a vain attempt, however, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to in&s;pire with a love of &s;cience men from who&s;e minds reflection has long been alienated. The im|provement propo&s;ed mu&s;t be the effect of a &s;y&s;tem of education gradually and cautiou&s;ly developed.</P>
<P>PREVIOUSLY to any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, one prin|ciple mu&s;t prevail. Society mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h the right to educate, and acknowledge the duty of having educated, all children. A circum&s;tance, &s;o momen|tou&s;ly important, mu&s;t not be left to the negligence of individuals. It is believed, that this principle is recogni&s;ed in almo&s;t all our &s;tate con&s;titutions. If &s;o, the exerci&s;e of it would not be conte&s;ted. In|deed, whether at pre&s;ent acknowledged or not, it would produce &s;uch beneficial effects, as well in re|ference to the parent as the child, that a general acquie&s;cence might be relied on. [Note F.]</P>
<P>HAVING contemplated in reference to man an abatement of two hours of labour, the next object of enquiry is what time &s;hould be devoted to the edu|cation of youth. It &s;hould unque&s;tionably be much larger; as during this period the mind is unimprov|ed; as impre&s;&s;ions of the greate&s;t &s;trength are rapid|ly made; and as the future bia&s;s of the mind en|tirely depends upon the improvement of the&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions. The period, however, &s;hould have its limits. Study &s;hould never be continued after it becomes oppre&s;&s;ive. The preceptor &s;hould be as cau|tious in u&s;ing every mean nece&s;&s;ary to prevent di&s;|gu&s;t,
<PB N="40" REF="034558_0038_0FFE286F79683290">
as he ought to be zealous in exciting a thir&s;t of knowledge. Without aiming at rigid preci&s;ion, in con&s;idering the claims of labour and &s;tudy, we &s;hall not, perhaps, materially err in a&s;&s;igning four hours each day to education.</P>
<P>II. <HI>THE objects proper to be accompli&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary that the principle of an univer&s;al diffu&s;ion of knowledge &s;hould be in the highe&s;t de|gree energetic. This is a principle which cannot be too exten&s;ively embraced; for it is too true, that all the efforts of an enlightened zeal will never make a whole nation as well informed as its intere&s;ts would pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>BUT this nece&s;&s;ary limit forms no objection to every practicable exten&s;ion of it. We &s;hall be fur|ni&s;hed with irrefragable evidence of its beneficial tendency, on con&s;idering that knowledge has only produced injurious effects, when it has been the &s;ub|ject of monopoly. The efforts of ignorance to op|pre&s;s &s;cience have excited a &s;pirit of retaliation, which we mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed at beholding, in its turn, its own avenger. The moment, how|ever, which marks the univer&s;al diffu&s;ion of &s;cience, by withdrawing the temptation to, as well as the means of, injury, will re&s;tore knowledge to its ori|ginal purity and lu&s;tre. It is with knowledge, as with every other thing which influences the human mind. It acts preci&s;ely in proportion to the force of the object acted upon. As the beggar cannot cor|rupt
<PB N="41" REF="034558_0039_0FFE282ACBC42560">
by gold the beggar; &s;o neither can opulence corrupt opulence. In the &s;ame manner, equality of intellectual attainments is a foe to oppre&s;&s;ion; and ju&s;t as mankind &s;hall advance in its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the means as well as the inducement to oppre&s;s will be annihilated. We are correct, therefore, in declaring a diffu&s;ion of knowledge, the be&s;t, perhaps the only pledge of virtue, of equality, and of independence.</P>
<P>LET us, then, with mental inflexibility, believe that though all men will never be philo&s;ophers, yet that all men may be enlightened; and that folly, unle&s;s ari&s;ing from phy&s;ical origin, may be bani&s;hed from the &s;ociety of men. [Note G.]</P>
<P>THE ideas already expre&s;&s;ed, and tho&s;e which &s;uc|ceed, mu&s;t be under&s;tood as applicable to a &s;y&s;tem of general education. They only pre&s;cribe what it is nece&s;&s;ary every man &s;hould know. They do not at|tempt to limit his acqui&s;itions. Wealth and genius will always po&s;&s;e&s;s great advantages. It will be their prerogatives, if properly directed, to carry improve|ment to its highe&s;t eminences.</P>
<P>IN forming a &s;y&s;tem of liberal education, it is nece&s;&s;ary to avoid ideas of too general a character, as well as tho&s;e which involve too minute a &s;pecifica|tion. Con&s;iderable latitude mu&s;t be allowed for the different degrees of natural capacity, and the vary|ing &s;hades of temper and bia&s;s. It &s;eems, therefore, fit to lay down principles which po&s;&s;e&s;s properties common to every mind, and which will, of cour&s;e,
<PB N="42" REF="034558_0040_0FFE282C4FB88170">
in their application, admit of few, if any, excep|tions.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t great object of a liberal &s;y&s;tem of edu|cation &s;hould be, the admi&s;&s;ion into the young mind of &s;uch ideas only as are either ab&s;olutely true, or in the highe&s;t degree probable; and the cautious exclu&s;ion of all error.</P>
<P>WERE man able to trace every effect to its cau&s;e, he would probably find that the virtue or the vice of an individual, the happine&s;s or the mi&s;ery of a fa|mily, the glory or the infamy of a nation, have had their &s;ources in the cradle, over which the prejudi|des of a nur&s;e or a mother have pre&s;ided. The years of infancy are tho&s;e in which the chains of vir|tue or of vice are generally forged. Fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions are almo&s;t omnipotent. Their reign is &s;ilent, but not on that account the le&s;s &s;ecure. The mind no &s;ooner begins to unfold it&s;elf than it gra&s;ps with ea|gerne&s;s every new idea. Intoxicated, as it were, with plea&s;ure at its reception, it &s;urrenders it&s;elf more to enjoyment than reflection. Indeed, it has now the capacity to enjoy, but not to reflect. In proportion to the length of time any idea occupies the mind, does it acquire &s;trength and produce con|viction. And no &s;ooner have the&s;e ends been ac|compli&s;hed, than it con&s;titutes it&s;elf the judge of every other re&s;embling or oppo&s;ing idea. Hence it tyrannizes with de&s;potic authority.</P>
<P>IF this view be correct, &s;hould it not be thought trea&s;on again&s;t truth and virtue, to in&s;til prejudice
<PB N="43" REF="034558_0041_0FFE2871013C3D08">
and error into the young mind? If this be trea&s;on again&s;t truth and virtue, what &s;hall we &s;ay of tho&s;e who inculcate principles which they know to be fal&s;e, and attempt in this way to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;y&s;tems that only exi&s;t in the mid&s;t of human carnage and de&s;truction?</P>
<P>WHETHER we con&s;ider man's exi&s;tence as termi|nated by the grave, or view him, as he doubtle&s;s is, the heir of a future life, we mu&s;t con&s;ider his happine&s;s as altogether dependent on the ob&s;ervance of certain moral principles. The univer&s;ality with which the&s;e have been received may be con&s;idered as the te&s;t of their truth. The&s;e principles are few and &s;imple. As the mind expands they &s;hould be explained. They require no other aid than clear illu&s;tration. The unperverted under&s;tanding ac|knowledges their truth as it were by intuition. [Note H.]</P>
<P>LET then tho&s;e truths in which all men agree be firmly impre&s;&s;ed; let tho&s;e which are probable be inculcated with caution, and let doubt always hang over tho&s;e re&s;pecting which the good and the wi&s;e di&s;agree. Above all things let the infant mind be protected from conviction without proof.</P>
<P>BUT it will be &s;aid that in almo&s;t all the depart|ments of a general plan of education, the peru&s;al of approved books mu&s;t be chiefly relied on. The indi&s;pen&s;able economy of arrangements which are to pervade a whole &s;ociety, will prohibit the em|ployment
<PB N="44" REF="034558_0042_0FFE282F350D38F8">
of preceptors of either great or original talents. It will therefore be fit that the preceptor, in&s;tead of inculcating his own immature ideas, &s;hould be guided by pre&s;cribed works. It is a&s;ked, where performances explaining and enforcing plain and undeniable truths, and avoiding prejudices or fal&s;e|hoods, are to be found? Such productions are ac|knowledged to be rare. It is al&s;o granted that this difficulty pre&s;ents one of the mo&s;t &s;erious ob&s;tacles to &s;ucce&s;sful education. But it is not in&s;urmounta|ble. It is attempted to be removed, as will appear hereafter, by offering large rewards for books of this nature, and by inciting the learned by other inducements to embark in &s;o noble a &s;ervice. At pre&s;ent we mu&s;t be &s;atisfied in giving the prefe|rence to tho&s;e works which abound mo&s;t with truth and are the mo&s;t exempt from error.</P>
<P>THE elements of education, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> reading and writ|ing, are &s;o obviou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary, that it is u&s;ele&s;s to do more than enumerate them.</P>
<P>OF nearly equal importance are the fir&s;t princi|ples of mathematics, as at pre&s;ent almo&s;t univer&s;ally taught.</P>
<P>A TOLERABLY correct idea of Geography would &s;eem, in a Republic e&s;pecially, to involve great ad|vantages. The intere&s;t of the mercantile part of the community is clo&s;ely connected with correct geographical knowledge. Many important depart|ments of &s;cience include an accurate knowledge of
<PB N="45" REF="034558_0043_0FFE2872852D9F60">
it. But the mo&s;t important con&s;ideration is that which contemplates the United States as either al|lied in friend&s;hip, or arrayed in ho&s;tility, with the other nations of the earth. In both which ca&s;es, it becomes the duty of the citizen to have ju&s;t ideas of the po&s;ition, &s;ize, and &s;trength, of nations, that he may as much as po&s;&s;ible, confide in his own judg|ment, in forming an opinion of our foreign relati|ons, in&s;tead of yielding his mind to a dangerous credulity. A mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of Geography relates to a knowledge of our own country. Correct information on this &s;ubject will always conduce to &s;trengthen the bands of friend&s;hip, and to di&s;&s;ipate the mi&s;repre&s;entations of party prejudice.</P>
<P>THE cultivation of natural philo&s;ophy, particu|larly &s;o far as it relates to agriculture and manufac|tures, has been heretofore almo&s;t entirely neglected. The benefits, however, which it would produce, are great, both as they regard the happine&s;s of the individual, and as they regard national wealth. Many of the labours of the farmer and the mecha|nic, &s;o far from forbidding reflection, invite it. Thus the con&s;tant developement of new beauties in na|ture, and the almo&s;t as con&s;tant production of new wonders in art, extort admiration from the mo&s;t ignorant, and even impre&s;s their minds with con&s;i|derable delight. And yet how little do they know of the energies of nature or art? Lo&s;t in the con|templation of effects, the tribute of a grateful mind finds vent in &s;imple wonder.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="034558_0044_0FFE2834E749F008">
IF we rever&s;e the &s;cene, and behold the farmer enlightened by the knowledge of chemi&s;try, how wide a field of reflection and plea&s;ure, as well as profit, would acknowledge his empire?</P>
<P>THE ingenuity of the mechanic would not long remain pa&s;&s;ive. Repeated efforts at improvement would often prove &s;ucce&s;sful, and be the &s;ource of new and rapid wealth. At any rate in all the&s;e ca&s;es, whether pro&s;pered with the expected &s;ucce&s;s or not, an adequate compen&s;ation would be con|ferred on the mind thus employed, who&s;e thoughts generally bring with them their own reward.</P>
<P>THE circum&s;cribed advantages, attending Geo|graphical knowledge, will be greatly enlarged by a liberal acquaintance with Hi&s;tory. In proportion as this branch of education &s;hall be cultivated, men will &s;ee the mighty influence of moral principle, as well on the private individuals of a community, as on tho&s;e who are called to pre&s;ide over its public concerns. It will be di&s;tinctly &s;een, that ambition has generally ri&s;en on a de&s;truction of every &s;enti|ment of virtue, and that it much oftener merits execration than applau&s;e. Power, long enjoyed, will appear to be ho&s;tile to the happine&s;s, and &s;ub|ver&s;ive of the integrity, of the individual in whom it centres. Fanatici&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition will appear &s;urrounded with blood and torture. War will &s;tand forth with the bolde&s;t prominence of vice and folly, and make it, for a while, doubtful, whether man is mo&s;t a villain or a fool. In &s;hort the mirror which
<PB N="47" REF="034558_0045_0FFE28366A7527E8">
hi&s;tory pre&s;ents will manife&s;t to man what, it is pro|bable, he will become, &s;hould he &s;urrender him&s;elf up to tho&s;e &s;elfi&s;h pur&s;uits, which centering in his own fame alone, have ennabled him without horror to wade through the blood and the tears of millions.</P>
<P>THIS horrid truth, confirmed by every page of hi&s;tory, will re&s;train, as it undoubted has re&s;trained, the indulgence of furious pa&s;&s;ion. The immortal admiration attached to great and di&s;intere&s;ted vir|tue, the immortal dete&s;tation in&s;eparable from great and &s;elfi&s;h vice, will furni&s;h the mind at once with the &s;tronge&s;t incentives to the one, and the livelie&s;t abhorrence of the other.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd leading object of education, &s;hould be to in&s;pire the mind with a &s;trong di&s;po&s;ition to improvement.</P>
<P>IT is acknowledged that &s;cience is &s;till in its in|fancy. The combination of ideas is infinite. As this combination advances the circle of knowledge is enlarged, and of cour&s;e, the &s;phere of happine&s;s extended. At pre&s;ent &s;cience is only cultivated by a few reclu&s;e &s;tudents, too apt to mingle the illu&s;i|ons of imagination with the re&s;ults of indi&s;tinct ob|&s;ervation. Hence the reproach that theory and practice oppo&s;e each other. But no &s;ooner &s;hall a whole nation be tributary to &s;cience, than it will dawn with new lu&s;tre. To adopt a phy&s;ical illu&s;tra|tion, its rays may be expected to meet with little ab&s;orption from ignorance, but to be reflected
<PB N="48" REF="034558_0046_0FFE2876DA860A00">
with additional lu&s;tre, from every object they &s;trike.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t &s;plendid di&s;coveries have not been made by philo&s;ophers of profound erudition and ab&s;tracted reflection, but by men of moderate at|tainments and correct ob&s;ervation. They have pro|ceeded from &s;teady and patient ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>WERE the progre&s;s of a mind to improvement attended with no other effects than internal delight, it would &s;till de&s;erve the highe&s;t rank among tho&s;e objects which produce happine&s;s. Bani&s;hing from the mind all tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations of indifference, ennui, and vacancy, which produce effects the more cruel from their being almo&s;t wholly without remedy, it would give to exi&s;tence a thou&s;and new charms; not fleeting, but con&s;tant and always at command. The periods of youth and of active life would be invigorated, the clo&s;e of exi&s;tence would become a ble&s;&s;ing in&s;tead of a burthen. Is there any thing in exi&s;tence more intere&s;ting than an old man, who&s;e mind is &s;tored with wi&s;dom, and who&s;e heart is full of &s;en&s;ibility?</P>
<P>WERE it &s;uppo&s;ed probable that any objection would be made to a vigorous &s;pirit of re&s;earch, an appeal might be made to the words of Dr. Clarke, alike eminent for di&s;tinction in virtue and &s;cience: <Q>A free and impartial inquiry into truth is far from being reprehen&s;ible. On the contrary, it is a di&s;po&s;ition which every man ought in him&s;elf to
<PB N="49" REF="034558_0047_0FFE283951491068">
labour after, and to the utmo&s;t of his power en|courage in others. It is the great foundation of all our knowledge, of all true virtue, and of all &s;incere religion.</Q></P>
<P>THIS progre&s;&s;ive improvement would be pro|moted, in the third place, by in&s;piring youth with a ta&s;te for, and an attachment to, &s;cience, &s;o firm, that it &s;hould be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to eradicate it in the &s;ub&s;equent periods of life.</P>
<P>FOR this purpo&s;e &s;tudies which addre&s;s them&s;elves to the heart, as well as tho&s;e which require &s;trong mental attention, &s;hould invite the exerci&s;e of their thoughts. Rewards &s;hould be liberally be|&s;towed, as well tho&s;e which furni&s;h the means of moderate plea&s;ure, as tho&s;e which confer di&s;tinc|tion. Coercion &s;hould be &s;eldom, if ever applied. [Note I.]</P>
<P>BUT this great object would be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, more than by any other con&s;ideration, by&mdash;</P>
<P>RENDERING, in the fourth place, knowledge as highly practical as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THIS idea has been already noticed. But it merits a more exten&s;ive di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Next to the fir&s;t object it claims the greate&s;t notice.</P>
<P>ALL &s;cience ought to derive its rank from its utility. The real good which it actually does, or is capable of doing, is the only genuine criterion
<PB N="50" REF="034558_0048_0FFE287B24621A28">
of its value. Man may indulge him&s;elf in &s;ublime reveries, but the world will forever remain uninte|re&s;ted in them. It is only when he applies the powers of his mind to objects of general u&s;e, that he becomes their benefactor; until he does this he is neither entitled to their gratitude or applau&s;e.</P>
<P>HE is the be&s;t friend of man, who makes di&s;co|veries involving effects which benefit mankind the mo&s;t exten&s;ively. Moral truths are therefore of im|portance but little &s;hort of infinite. For they ap|ply to numbers which almo&s;t evade enumeration, and to time which lo&s;es it&s;elf in eternity. The&s;e truths, all agree, are not to be &s;ought in the cloi|&s;ter. They are only acquired by uniting the calm and patient reflection of retirement, with the bold and penetrating ob&s;ervation of active life.</P>
<P>IN phy&s;ics, the happine&s;s of mankind is in the highe&s;t degree increa&s;ed by di&s;coveries and im|provements connected with agriculture and manu|factures. The&s;e two occupations employ nine|tenths of mo&s;t communities, and a much larger proportion of others. Does it not then become an intere&s;ting enquiry, whether it be not expedient in infancy and youth to communicate to the mind the leading principles of nature and art in the&s;e depart|ments of labour, not only by a theoretic expo&s;ition of them, but al&s;o by their practical developement.</P>
<P>IF almo&s;t the whole community be de&s;tined to pur|&s;ue one or other of the&s;e avocations from nece&s;&s;ity,
<PB N="51" REF="034558_0049_0FFE28B884D06048">
and if it be the duty of an individual to &s;upport him&s;elf, whenever he can, by an exertion of his own powers; and if the&s;e can only yield a &s;ure &s;up|port from an ability to be acquired in youth to pro|&s;ecute a particular branch of agriculture or mecha|nics, does it not &s;eem to be the duty of &s;ociety to control education in &s;uch a way as to &s;ecure to every individual this ability? If this ability ex|i&s;ted, how much mi&s;ery would be annihilated, how much crime would be de&s;troyed? Even under a government,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In France.</NOTE> in which the happine&s;s of men does not appear to have been the leading object, the no|bility were obliged to be in&s;tructed fully in the principles, and partially in the practice, of a parti|cular trade.</P>
<P>SHOULD, however, the ju&s;tice of abridging natu|ral right in the&s;e ca&s;es be doubted, and its expe|dience denied, the propriety of a union of practical with theoretic in&s;truction will not be conte&s;ted in reference to tho&s;e who are de&s;igned for agriculture or mechanics.</P>
<P>NAKED &s;peculation is either unintelligible or un|intere&s;ting to the young mind, while it delights in examining external appearances, and often in &s;earch|ing after their cau&s;es. Tho&s;e objects which have engaged our earlie&s;t, and &s;urely in &s;ome re&s;pects our happie&s;t days, are cheri&s;hed and pur&s;ued by the mind with increa&s;ing delight in advanced and old age. From this plain view of the &s;ubject, it ap|pears
<PB N="52" REF="034558_0050_0FFE287CA5940690">
that in youth the addition of practical to theoretical knowledge would add to its charms; while in maturer age the blending theoretic with practical knowledge would render labour more agreeable and engaging.</P>
<P>As the period of education will, it is probable, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, be protracted till the child &s;hall be engaged in preparing him&s;elf for &s;ome employ|ment in life, it would be important to confine his attention, in a con&s;iderable degree, to the acqui&s;ition of that kind of knowledge which would be of the greate&s;t practical u&s;e in the profe&s;&s;ion for which he is de&s;tined. Give the mind an object worthy of its efforts, and you may rely upon their being made. In this ca&s;e the child would reali&s;e the con|nection between its pre&s;ent pur&s;uits, and its future pro&s;perity, and this impre&s;&s;ion could not fail to kindle new ardour in its youthful brea&s;t.</P>
<P>THE fifth object &s;hould be the in&s;piring youth with an ardent love for mankind. To accompli&s;h this end, the preceptor &s;hould cautiou&s;ly avoid in|&s;tilling into the mind of his pupil a mean idea of human nature. The pages of the morali&s;t by de|ba&s;ing man have aided that degeneracy which they deprecate. We &s;hould not even convey a &s;u&s;picion of the hone&s;ty of him whom we wi&s;h to be virtuous. Tho&s;e who have led the public mind, &s;o far from attending to this maxim, have almo&s;t univer&s;ally pourtrayed the heart and conduct of man as infi|nitely
<PB N="53" REF="034558_0051_0FFE28BCD0CB4548">
depraved; and we have often beheld the gloomy &s;pectacle of a mi&s;anthropic infant. If we examine the tendency of the unperverted princi|ples of nature, we mu&s;t acknowledge their ho&s;tility to that &s;u&s;picion and jealou&s;ly which have proceeded from the force of education. The delight which we all feel on contemplating the ab&s;ence of &s;u&s;picion, is an evidence of the triumph of virtue and nature. The child has no doubt of the hone&s;ty of tho&s;e about him, until his mind has received an artificial bia&s;s. Having received this unfortunate bia&s;s, and looking upon his fellow-beings as ho&s;tile, as he en|ters on life, he treats them with &s;u&s;picion; and perhaps, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that they would pur&s;ue their own intere&s;t even to his injury, he he&s;itates not to pur&s;ue his to theirs. This aggre&s;&s;ion, on his part, cannot fail to produce from them that conduct which he has been taught to expect; and thus irra|tionally is &s;trengthened a conviction dictated by pre|judice.</P>
<P>WE know, in our intercour&s;e with the world, that confidence is the parent of friend&s;hip, which forbids its &s;ubject to do an act ba&s;e or di&s;honoura|ble. On the other hand, it is alike evident that di&s;|tru&s;t produces enmity, and that enmity will often dictate, in the paroxy&s;m of re&s;entment, a mean and di&s;graceful action.</P>
<P>IN whatever light this &s;ubject is viewed by rea|&s;on, it will appear that men are the creatures of &s;entiment, and that their virtue is often greatly,
<PB N="54" REF="034558_0052_0FFE287E29400B18">
&s;ometimes altogether, dependent on the opinion entertained of them by others. Let us then em|brace the &s;entiment &s;o forcibly expre&s;&s;ed by Sulli|van, "It is not po&s;&s;ible," &s;ays he, <Q>for a &s;ane mind, for any continuance, to look upon man|kind, either as emmets, below his &s;erious atten|tion, or as mon&s;ters, more worthy of his hatred than his regard.</Q></P>
<P>III. <HI>THE manner of accompli&s;hing the objects of education!</HI></P>
<P>THIS branch of the &s;ubject may, in many re|&s;pects, claim &s;uperior importance to the other branches. It involves a more detailed &s;tatement, and more minute and &s;pecific ideas, than tho&s;e which have been already di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is to be feared, however, that the nece&s;&s;ary &s;pe|cification of &s;mall objects which it requires to ren|der it clear or u&s;eful, may le&s;&s;en, in the minds of &s;ome, the dignity of the &s;ubject, and expo&s;e it to the edge of ridicule. But it &s;hould be con&s;idered that as education it&s;elf altogether con&s;i&s;ts in a vigi|lant attention to &s;mall objects, and would be wholly defeated without &s;uch attention, &s;o that &s;y&s;tem of education, other con&s;iderations being equal, mu&s;t be the be&s;t, which, in the&s;e &s;mall objects, leaves the lea&s;t to error, negligence and caprice. As in the natural world the boundle&s;s ocean takes its &s;ource in innumerable petty &s;prings, &s;o the mind, invigo|rated with exten&s;ive acqui&s;itions, acknowledges its dependence on the humble&s;t ideas.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="034558_0053_0FFE28BE5488CE30">
BEFORE we proceed to adju&s;t the &s;everal parts of the &s;y&s;tem, two intere&s;ting enquiries pre&s;ent them|&s;elves for &s;olution.</P>
<P>I. At what age education &s;hould commence?</P>
<P>II. SHOULD education be public or private?</P>
<P>I. EVERY correct view of human nature &s;hews the young mind, though tender, to be capable of great improvement. The injury it &s;o often &s;u&s;|tains from yielding to &s;uper&s;titious notions, by be|ing &s;acrificed to unmanly fear, and by being wedded to numerous prejudices, abundantly atte&s;ts the in|fluence of certain ideas on the mind, which had it been hone&s;tly directed, would have embraced truth in&s;tead of delu&s;ion, and courage in&s;tead of pu&s;illa|nimity. Mark the fir&s;t dawnings of the mind, and &s;ay if the infant exhibit any evidence of attach|ment to fal&s;ehood? On the contrary, with the mo&s;t engaging &s;implicity, you behold it giving expre&s;&s;i|on to truths the mo&s;t obvious. Regard the inte|re&s;ting credulity with which the child hears a mar|vellous &s;tory, until its mind labour under the op|pre&s;ive burthen of a ti&s;&s;ue of &s;upernatual incidents. We may then a&s;&s;ume it as an undeniable fact that an attachment to truth is the property of the un|perverted mind.</P>
<P>WHILE this principle is in its vigour, it is infi|nitely important that the mind &s;hould be as highly exerci&s;ed as po&s;&s;ible. But, it is &s;aid, that it &s;hould not be fatigued, much le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed. Granted.
<PB N="56" REF="034558_0054_0FFE2881115729C8">
But, let it in reply be remarked, that at no period of our life, as at the earlie&s;t, are we, in &s;ome re&s;pects, &s;o capable of a con&s;tant exerci&s;e of our faculties. Every object around, every idea within, is then new. Novelty is the &s;ource of our highe&s;t enjoyment; of cour&s;e not an object impre&s;&s;es the &s;en&s;es, not an idea is formed in the mind, which does not yield the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delight. Why is the remem|brance of the &s;cenes of childhood &s;o dear to us, but from the intere&s;ting recollection of &s;cene&s;
<Q><L>"Forever varying, and forever new."</L></Q></P>
<P>ON this branch of the &s;ubject, we may gather correct ideas, by attending to the remarks of a wri|ter of antiquity, who has for the mo&s;t part united with ma&s;terly &s;kill philo&s;ophy and a knowledge of human nature. Quintillian &s;ays, <Q>Some have thought that none &s;hould be in&s;tructed in letters who are under &s;even years of age, becau&s;e that early period can neither comprehend learning nor endure labour.</Q></P>
<Q><P>BUT what can they do better from the time at which they are able to talk? For &s;omething they mu&s;t do. Or why &s;hould we &s;light the gain, little as it is, which occurs, before the age of &s;e|ven? For certainly, however little that may be which the preceding age &s;hall have contributed, yet the boy will be learning greater things in that very year, in which he would otherwi&s;e have been learning &s;maller. This, extended to &s;eve|ral years, amounts to a &s;um; and whatever is an|ticipated
<PB N="57" REF="034558_0055_0FFE28C41A9E83A0">
in infancy, is an acqui&s;ition to the period of youth.</P>
<P>LET us not then throw away even the very fir&s;t period; and the le&s;s &s;o as the elements of learn|ing require memory alone, which is not only found in little boys, but is very tenacious in them.</P></Q>
<P>IT is true, that the mea&s;ure of knowledge which infancy will receive is &s;mall. But in mo&s;t &s;y&s;tems of education it has been injudiciou&s;ly re&s;tricted. The mind has lo&s;t half its vigor by being oppre&s;&s;ed with the nomenclature of &s;cience. Languages have been exclu&s;ively forced upon it; and it has been compelled to believe legitimate &s;cience to be as unmeaning and as barren as the words which it has acquired.</P>
<P>HAD a different plan been pur&s;ued; had our na|tive language only occupied the attention until well under&s;tood; had the &s;imple elements of morals and phy&s;ics received concurrent inculcation, intellec|tual &s;trength might have been &s;ecured in&s;tead of be|ing &s;pent. The mind, engaged in objects intimate|ly connected with its own happine&s;s, and the happi|ne&s;s of tho&s;e around it, would have imbibed a love of knowledge, which would probably never have been lo&s;t. [Note K.]</P>
<P>THESE remarks are forcibly illu&s;trated by a lu|minous ob&s;ervation of Monte&s;quieu. "Another
<PB N="58" REF="034558_0056_0FFE2886C4EF07F0">
advantage," &s;ays he, <Q>their (the Ancients) edu|cation had over ours; it never was effaced by con|trary impre&s;&s;ions. Epaminondas the la&s;t year of his life, &s;aid, heard, &s;aw, and performed the very &s;ame things, as at the age in which he received the fir&s;t principles of his education.</Q></P>
<P>ONE con&s;ideration may de&s;erve &s;ome attention, though it is not known hitherto to have received any; and as it flows from a general law of nature, its truth is confided in. All animals excepting man are &s;ubmitted almo&s;t wholly to their own efforts as to &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and welfare, as &s;oon as they have ac|quired phy&s;ical &s;trength &s;ufficient to protect them from the inva&s;ion of force. No animal is known to exi&s;t which does not require a certain portion of &s;a|gacity to guide it. This &s;agacity, it may therefore be fairly &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s as &s;oon as it attains its phy&s;ical manhood. Man alone, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate, pa&s;&s;es a cour&s;e of years in corporeal manhood, and mental infancy. May not the idea be hazarded that this has ari&s;en from fal&s;e education, which has retarded the progre&s;s of the mind, and protracted the period of mental infancy beyond the limits a&s;&s;igned it by nature.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e con&s;iderations, it appears, that the earlier the mind is placed under a proper regimen, the greater is the probability of producing the de|&s;ired effects. Some years mu&s;t be &s;urrendered to the claims of maternal regard: &s;ome will elap&s;e before the child is able to attend to any thing but
<PB N="59" REF="034558_0057_0FFE28C59E926E68">
tho&s;e external objects which irre&s;i&s;tibly force them|&s;elves on its notice.</P>
<P>MAKING an allowance of five years, for the&s;e un|avoidable &s;acrifices, and for the acqui&s;ition of tho&s;e elements of knowledge which are with facility ac|quired in any &s;ituation, we arrive at the period of life mo&s;t proper for commencing a &s;y&s;tem of gene|ral education.</P>
<P>IT is acknowledged that there is &s;omething arbi|trary in fixing the period of commencing the edu|cation of youth, as the mind varies in different per&s;ons. Still however, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary that age &s;hould decide the time fit for beginning education, which on the whole, with perhaps few variations, will be found the lea&s;t exceptionable mode of giving to this part of the &s;y&s;tem a feature definite and cer|tain; a feature which &s;hall not be under the control of parental weakne&s;s or ignorant caprice. If at the age of five, the mind, in &s;ome children, be too tender to receive much, an intelligent in&s;tructor will be &s;atisfied with imparting little. No danger need be apprehended from inten&s;e application at this period of life. Every idea formed in the mind will be &s;imple, and it is only in the combination of ideas that much mental vigor is required.</P>
<P>II. <HI>SHOULD education be public or private?</HI></P>
<P>THE mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed talents have been engaged in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject; and here, as in mo&s;t
<PB N="60" REF="034558_0058_0FFE288847A6C550">
controver&s;ies of a &s;peculative ca&s;t, we find a great diver&s;ity of &s;entiment. Quintillian and Milton are warm in their eulogium on a public, while Locke is equally animated in his prai&s;e of a private &s;y&s;tem of education. The great argument, which may be called the centre of all others urged, is the produc|tion of emulation by a public education; while the great objection made to public education, is the &s;acrifice, alleged to be produced, of morality and hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>As there is, undoubtedly, truth on both &s;ides, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider what weight the al|leged advantages and di&s;advantages ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s in determining the preference of the judgment to one over the other &s;y&s;tem. It will, perhaps, be po&s;&s;ible to reconcile the apparently conflicting ideas, in &s;uch a way, as to make the re&s;ult of benefit produced infinitely larger than the ri&s;que of injury &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>THE early period of life is under parental and e&s;pecially maternal control. The &s;olicitude of a mother is now the be&s;t, the only protection, which the child can receive. Some years elap&s;e, before the mind &s;eems capable of being impre&s;&s;ed with true or fal&s;e knowledge in a degree &s;ufficient to influence its future expan&s;ion, and during this pe|riod, it is fortunate that we have not occa&s;ion to regret the unenlightened &s;tate of the female mind. But though the&s;e years do not mark much &s;trength of mind, yet they rapidly unfold and form the di&s;|po&s;ition,
<PB N="61" REF="034558_0059_0FFE28C721F315F8">
which &s;eldom fails to receive a virtuous bias from a mother, who, however vicious her|&s;elf, feels deeply intere&s;ted in the virtue of her off&s;pring. Hence tho&s;e amiable affections are ex|cited which are the ornament of human nature. Before the age of five the child &s;eldom feels a di&s;|po&s;ition to do an immoral thing; and even if it &s;hould exhibit &s;uch a &s;ymptom, the temper is &s;o flexible, that it ea&s;ily yields to a more virtuous direction.</P>
<P>THE young mind, having pa&s;&s;ed five years of its exi&s;tence, free from much corruption, and a plan of education being now commenced, it becomes an object of con&s;ideration whether the child &s;hould remain with its parents, or be &s;eparated from them.</P>
<P>AS a large portion of parental &s;olicitude &s;till exi&s;ts, which alone &s;eems capable of &s;ecuring a vi|gilant attention to tho&s;e little indications of temper and mind which now &s;o profu&s;ely appear, it &s;eems highly important that the child &s;hould &s;till remain under the immediate control of parental authority. That affection which, on the part of the child, is but half formed, will have time and opportunity to gain &s;trength, a love of dome&s;tic tranquillity will be produced, and both the&s;e principles will form a firm &s;hield to virtue.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the daily attendance at &s;chool will withdraw the mind of the child from an <HI>entire</HI> dependence on its parents; will place it in &s;ituati|ons
<PB N="62" REF="034558_0060_0FFE2889C9A99648">
demanding the exerci&s;e of its faculties; and will &s;trengthen, in&s;tead of weakening, its attach|ment to dome&s;tic &s;cenes. To be deprived of that which we love is in &s;ome degree painful to us all; to children it is painful in the highe&s;t degree. Yet a habit of voluntary or compul&s;ory ab&s;tinence from plea&s;ure is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to human happi|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE child, in this &s;ituation, having its time di|vided between &s;chool, the hours of diver&s;ion, and tho&s;e &s;pent in the hou&s;e of its parents, will, per|haps, remain as free from a pro&s;tration of morals, as can be expected in infancy. This, indeed, is the plan, which univer&s;ally prevails in the civilized world, and its univer&s;ality is certainly &s;ome argu|ment in its favour.</P>
<P>LET this plan, partly dome&s;tic and partly public, be pur&s;ued till the mind begins boldly to expand it|&s;elf, and to indicate an ability and an inclination to think for it&s;elf. The commencement of this capa|city of combining ideas takes place about the age of ten. We have now reached the period which claims the clo&s;e&s;t attention. The mind now feels its vi|gour, and delights in di&s;playing it. Ambition is kindled, emulation burns, a de&s;ire of &s;uperiority and di&s;tinction are rou&s;ed.</P>
<P>THIS, then, appears to be the era, if ever, of pub|lic education. The indulgence of parental tender|ne&s;s &s;hould now be exchanged for the patient and
<PB N="63" REF="034558_0061_0FFE28CCD44DC8D0">
unob&s;tructed exerci&s;e of the mental powers. Let us attend to the advantages of the two rival &s;y&s;tems at this period.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the plan of public Education;</P>
<P N="1">1. EMULATION is excited. Without numbers there can be no emulation. It is founded on the love of di&s;tinction. In a private family this di&s;|tinction cannot be acquired.</P>
<P N="2">2. An attention to &s;tudy, when the child is re|moved from the hou&s;e of its parent, may be unin|terruped; whereas while it re&s;ides with him a thou&s;and trifling, menial, avocations, will always take precedence. From this re&s;ults the conviction in the mind of the child that &s;tudy is altogether &s;ubordinate to the objects to which it is compelled to attend.</P>
<P N="3">3. BUT, above every other con&s;ideration, the &s;y&s;tem of public education, in&s;pires a &s;pirit of in|dependent reflection and conduct. Removed from a &s;cene, where it has little occa&s;ion to think, and le&s;s to act, the child now finds it&s;elf placed in a &s;itu|ation free from rigid parental authority. [Note L.] Placed in the mid&s;t of objects of pur&s;uit, its prefe|rence of one object to another, is often determined by its own volition. Hence reflection is excited; and with children there is certainly no danger of too much thought;&mdash;the only apprehen&s;ion is that there being too little.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="034558_0062_0FFE288E34467A10">
LET a &s;pirit of independent reflection animate a large number of even youthful minds, and the ac|qui&s;ition of u&s;eful truths will &s;oon be rapid. This &s;pirit, aided by the in&s;truction of enlightened pre|cepts, mu&s;t give an undeniable a&s;cendency to the public over the private plan.</P>
<P>ERROR is never more dangerous than in the mouth of a parent. The child, from the dawn of its exi|&s;tence, accu&s;tomed to receive as undoubted every idea from this quarter, &s;eldom, if ever, que&s;tions the truth of what it is told. Hence prejudices are as he|reditary as titles; and you may almo&s;t univer&s;ally know the &s;entiments of the &s;on by tho&s;e of the fa|ther. [Note M.] Now by education remote from parental influence, the errors of the father cea&s;e to be entailed upon the child&mdash;Still farther, the child, having acquired true ideas, very often, from the &s;uperior force of truth, di&s;&s;ipates the errors of his parent by the remon&s;trances of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>As education profe&s;&s;es to improve the &s;tate and character of men, and not barely to oppo&s;e their declen&s;ion, it mu&s;t follow that dome&s;tic education is improper, as it does no more, even if &s;ucce&s;sful, than &s;ecure the la&s;t at the expence of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the argument urged again&s;t public education (for only one is urged with any tenacity) we &s;hall find that the evil it deprecates ari&s;es from the imperfection of human nature, more than from any appropriate and exclu&s;ive property of public education.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="034558_0063_0FFE28CE564775F0">
<Q>WHEREVER there are numbers, of children a&s;|&s;embled together, there will be mi&s;chief and im|morality.</Q> This is true; but is it &s;o exten&s;ively true as to countervail the numerous advantages which have been but partially &s;tated? Is it equal to the injury &s;u&s;tained by the mechanical adoption of pa|rental error or vice? More mi&s;chief, more immo|rality, have &s;prung from this &s;ource, than from the one complained of. On the other hand does not the conduct of children, in a public in&s;titution, in a con&s;iderable degree, re&s;emble the actions of men in the world? The knowledge, therefore, thus acquired, though &s;ometimes at the expence of ho|ne&s;ty and truth, mu&s;t be deemed of &s;ome impor|tance. It is probable that it aro&s;e from the &s;pirit of their plans of education, that Sparta was the la&s;t nation that fell a prey to the Macedonians, and Crete to the Romans. The Samnites, Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erves, had the &s;ame in&s;titutions, which furni&s;h|ed tho&s;e very Romans with the &s;ubject of four and twenty triumphs. Indeed, though it be probable, that no plan can ever be devi&s;ed, which &s;hall ad|mit all the advantages of an honorable and zealous competition, and exclude all the injuries hereto|fore &s;o clo&s;ely allied as to be deemed in&s;eparable, yet &s;ome improvement ought not to be de&s;paired of, amid&s;t the univer&s;al tendency of every thing to amelioration.</P>
<P>THE di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject appears in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;uper&s;eded, and the preference unequivo|cally
<PB N="66" REF="034558_0064_0FFE288FB673AE98">
e&s;tabli&s;hed of the public over the private plan, by the &s;mall expence of the fir&s;t, compared with the unpracticable expence of the la&s;t. If parents educated their children, the hours withdrawn from bu&s;ine&s;s would alone impoveri&s;h them.</P>
<P>BEFORE a detail is given of the cour&s;e of educa|tion propo&s;ed, it may be proper conci&s;ely to &s;tate the points, which it has been the object of the pre|ceding remarks to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>IN THE FIRST PLACE, virtue and wi&s;dom have been deemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s an in&s;eparable connection, and the degree and efficiency of the one has been decid|ed to depend on the mea&s;ure and vigor of the other. From this propo&s;ition the inference is deduced that a nation cannot po&s;&s;ibly be too enlightened, and that the mo&s;t energetic zeal is nece&s;&s;ary to make it &s;ufficiently &s;o for the great intere&s;ts of virtue and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. That it is the duty of a nation to &s;u|perintend and even to coerce the education of children, and that high con&s;iderations of expedi|ency not only ju&s;tify, but dictate the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;y&s;tem, which &s;hall place under a control, in|dependent of, and &s;uperior to, parental authority, the education of children.</P>
<P>THIRDLY. The preference has been given at a certain age to public education over dome&s;tic edu|cation.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="034558_0065_0FFE28CFD84C4A88">
FOURTHLY. The period of education recommend|ed has been fixed at an age &s;o early, as to anticipate the reign of prejudice, and to render the fir&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ions made on the mind &s;ub&s;ervient to virtue and truth.</P>
<P>GUIDED by the&s;e principles it is propo&s;ed;</P>
<P>I. THAT the period of education be from 5 to 18.</P>

<P>XXII. FOR the promotion of literature and &s;ci|ence, it is propo&s;ed that a board of literature and &s;cience be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the following principles:</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="034558_0069_0FFE28D8A8DD5978">
IT &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of fourteen per&s;ons &s;killed in the &s;everal branches of, 1. Languages. 2. Mathematics. 3. Geography and Hi&s;tory. 4. Natural Philo&s;ophy in general. 5. Moral Philo&s;ophy. 6. Engli&s;h Lan|guage, Belle Lettres, and Critici&s;m. 7. Agricul|ture. 8. Manufactures. 9. Government and Laws. 10. Medicine. 11. Theology. 12. Elements of ta&s;te, including principles of Mu&s;ic, Architecture, Gardening, Drawing, &amp;c. 13. Military Tactics. And in addition, 14. A per&s;on eminently &s;killed in Science, who &s;hall be Pre&s;ident of the board.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons forming the board &s;hall, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, be determined by law, and in ca&s;e of va|cancy, a new election &s;hall be held by the remain|ing members of the board.</P>
<P>TWENTY years &s;ub&s;equent to the commencement of the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem, all vacancies &s;hall be &s;up|plied by a choice made in the fir&s;t in&s;tance by the profe&s;&s;ors of the Univer&s;ity, which &s;hall be then approved by a majority of colleges, the profe&s;&s;ors of each college voting by them&s;elves; and finally &s;anctioned by a majority of the fellows of the Uni|ver&s;ity voting. No per&s;on under 30 years of age &s;hall be eligible.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons, &s;o elected, &s;hall hold their offices during life, and receive a liberal &s;alary, which &s;hall render them independent in their circum&s;tances. No removal &s;hall take place unle&s;s approved by the &s;uffrages of three-fourths of the colleges, three-fourths
<PB N="72" REF="034558_0070_0FFE289867E31710">
of the profe&s;&s;ors of the Univer&s;ity, and three-fourths of the fellows of the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>IT &s;hall be the duty of this board to form a &s;y&s;|tem of national education to be ob&s;erved in the Univer&s;ity, the colleges, and the primary &s;chools; to chu&s;e the profe&s;&s;ors of the Univer&s;ity; to fix the &s;alaries of the &s;everal officers; and to &s;uperintend the general intere&s;ts of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>AS merit and talents are be&s;t &s;ecured by liberal rewards, a fund &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed and placed un|der the control of this board, out of which premi|ums &s;hall be paid to &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hall, by their writings, excel in the treatment of the &s;ubjects pro|po&s;ed by the board for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, or &s;uch as &s;hall make any valuable di&s;covery.</P>
<P>IT &s;hall further be the duty of this board to pe|ru&s;e all literary or &s;cientific productions &s;ubmitted to them by any citizen, and in ca&s;e they &s;hall pro|nounce any &s;uch work worthy of general peru&s;al and calculated to extend the &s;phere of u&s;eful know|ledge, it &s;hall be printed at the public expence, and the author rewarded.</P>
<P>IT &s;hall be the e&s;pecial duty of the board to de|termine what authors &s;hall be read or &s;tudied in the &s;everal in&s;titutions, and at any time to &s;ub&s;titute one author for another.</P>
<P>As the exten&s;ive diffu&s;ion of knowledge is admi|rably promoted by libraries, it &s;hall be in the power
<PB N="73" REF="034558_0071_0FFE28DA2BA55700">
of the board to e&s;tabli&s;h them, wherever it &s;hall &s;ee fit; and to direct all original productions of me|rit to be introduced into them.</P>
<P>IT is not concealed, that on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this board, the utility, the energy, and the dignity of the propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem are deemed greatly to de|pend. It will therefore be proper to exhibit with &s;ome minutene&s;s the rea&s;ons which render &s;uch an in&s;titution expedient, or in other words to &s;tate the advantages which may be expected to be derived from it.</P>
<P>OUR &s;eminaries of learning have heretofore been under the management of men, either incompetent to their &s;uperintendance, or not intere&s;ted in a &s;uf|ficient degree in their welfare. Voluntary and di&s;intere&s;ted &s;ervices, however honorable, are but rarely to be obtained. The zeal, which embarks a man of talents in the promotion of any object, will cool, unle&s;s &s;u&s;tained by &s;ome &s;ub&s;tantial bene|fits, either received or expected. It is almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible in this country for the ca&s;e to be different. Affluence is &s;o uncommon that few are to be found who po&s;&s;e&s;s it in union with intellectual attain|ments. Independent of this con&s;ideration, it is generally conceded that more knowledge is to be expected from men in a &s;ubordinate &s;phere of life, who are con&s;trained to cultivate their minds, than from tho&s;e who can live, without &s;uch cultivation, in ea&s;e and affluence. From this combination of acknowledged facts, it mu&s;t clearly appear that every
<PB N="74" REF="034558_0072_0FFE289E18777168">
advantage will flow from the in&s;titution of the pro|po&s;ed board, which either does or can proceed from tho&s;e formed on the exi&s;ting plans, and that great and exclu&s;ive additional benefits may be expected.</P>
<P>THE high re&s;pon&s;ibility of this board will in&s;ure its fidelity. Every member of it, being di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by eminent attainments in &s;ome department of learning, will be con&s;trained by the powerful ob|ligations due to character, to &s;uperintend with zeal and hone&s;ty tho&s;e concerns &s;pecially delegated to him. No branch of &s;cience or literature will flou|ri&s;h at the expence of another, as they will all be repre&s;ented at this board. This board being the &s;ource from which all inferior appointments pro|ceed, if it be governed in its choice of per&s;ons by incorrupt and intelligent motives, the &s;everal &s;tations of profe&s;&s;ors and preceptors will probably be filled with men equally eminent for knowledge and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>So far the advantages connected with the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of &s;uch a board have been contemplated in their immediate relation to the education of youth. Benefits, equally great and more &s;plendid, will flow to &s;ociety, from the &s;ecurity given to mo|rals, and the impul&s;e given to &s;cience. To this board, if liberally endowed with funds, talents will look for &s;ure protection and encouragement. Not only talents previou&s;ly exi&s;ting will be rewarded and animated to the noble&s;t efforts, but talents which had never otherwi&s;e exi&s;ted, will trace their crea|tion
<PB N="75" REF="034558_0073_0FFE28DBB044E730">
to this in&s;titution. The reliance on having publicity given to their di&s;coveries and re&s;earches, and the being rewarded by fame and &s;ome &s;hare of pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, will encourage all tho&s;e who feel con&s;cious of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing great powers of mind, to give them activity and expan&s;ion.</P>
<P>As it may be relied upon that a body of men, well known, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a full &s;en&s;e of the va|lue of character, will guard with peculiar circum|&s;pection, the intere&s;ts of virtue, and will only reward talents when exerted in its cau&s;e, we may expect that authors, as they regard the approbation of this board, will be careful to promote and not attack morals. Hence it may be inferred that fewer vicious productions will i&s;&s;ue from the pre&s;s, than at pre&s;ent di&s;grace it.</P>
<P>WHEN it is con&s;idered how &s;low literary merit is at pre&s;ent in receiving its reward, and that po&s;t|humous is more frequent than living fame; when it is con&s;idered how detrimental this circum&s;tance is to the acqui&s;ition of knowledge; when it is further con&s;idered that poverty is almo&s;t always the &s;ure lot of devotion to &s;cience; it becomes difficult to a&s;&s;ign limits to the advantages which &s;cience would derive from always knowing where to meet with protection, and receive both reputation and pecuniary reward. Every work recommended to general acceptance by this board would &s;urely go into a rapid circulation, which of it&s;elf will generally amply recompen&s;e the author.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="034558_0074_0FFE289F9C0CF438">
IF any one circum&s;tance be more connected with the virtue and happine&s;s of the United States than another, it is the &s;ub&s;titution of works defining cor|rectly, political, moral and religious duty, in the place of tho&s;e which are at pre&s;ent in u&s;e. The radical ideas we have already e&s;tabli&s;hed, and which are in a great mea&s;ure peculiar to us, claim a new and entirely different expo&s;ition from that which they have yet received. Every new work, there|fore, which comes from the pen of a citizen, may be deemed an important acqui&s;ition, a &s;tay to our virtue and a &s;hield to our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>EXCLUSIVELY of the enumerated advantages, which &s;cience may derive from this board, great ad|vances in knowledge may be expected from the individual contributions of its &s;everal members. Inured in the early period of their lives to clo&s;e application, having acquired the habits of patient and per&s;evering &s;tudy, and at length being placed in independent and ea&s;y circum&s;tances, we need not fear di&s;appointment in expecting from them performances and di&s;coveries of the fir&s;t order.</P>
<P>IN con&s;idering the objections likely to be urged again&s;t embracing the plan of education here pro|po&s;ed, only two of much importance are fore&s;een. The fir&s;t is its exten&s;ivene&s;s, the &s;econd its ex|pence.</P>
<P>As the exten&s;ivene&s;s can only be objectionable in reference to the expence, this alone &s;eems to require examination.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="034558_0075_0FFE28E0038C4F58">
TO give a fair trial to this &s;y&s;tem, liberal com|pen&s;ation &s;hould be allowed to the preceptors and profe&s;&s;ors. Their offices &s;hould be e&s;teemed as ho|norable as any employments, either public or pri|vate, in the community; and one &s;ure way of ren|dering them &s;o is to attach to them independence. Without this appendage we &s;hall in vain expect that exclu&s;ive attention to &s;cience and profe&s;&s;ional duty, which can alone accompli&s;h the ends de&s;ired.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ary expence mu&s;t, then, be &s;ubmitted to without reluctance. On an enquiry into the &s;ources of taxation we &s;hall find more encourage|ment than di&s;couragement. When it is &s;tated that the wealth of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania alone may be e&s;timated at more than 400 million of dollars, it will at once be &s;een how little the mo&s;t liberal &s;um, rai&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of education, would partake of burthen or oppre&s;&s;ion. When on the other hand the greatne&s;s of the object is correctly e&s;timated and truly felt, all prejudices ought at once to be annihilated; and it is only doing ju&s;tice to the patrioti&s;m of our citizens to believe that they would be annihilated.</P>
<P>TWO &s;ubjects connected with a general &s;y&s;tem of education, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> female in&s;truction, and that which has been called ornamental, have been avoided: Both of the&s;e certainly involve very important con|&s;iderations. But in the exi&s;ting diver&s;ity of opinion re&s;pecting the nature and extent of the fir&s;t, &s;uch coincidence and agreement as to produce a &s;y&s;tem
<PB N="78" REF="034558_0076_0FFE28A286396DF8">
mu&s;t ab&s;olutely be de&s;paired of. It is &s;ufficient, perhaps, for the pre&s;ent that the improvement of women is marked by a rapid progre&s;s, and that a pro&s;pect opens equal to their mo&s;t ambitious de|&s;ires.&mdash;With regard to ornamental in&s;truction, it would &s;eem to re&s;t more on principles of expedi|ency than of nece&s;&s;ity. It may, al&s;o, be con&s;ider|ed as a kind of mental luxury, which like that of a gro&s;&s;er nature, will imperceptibly, but &s;urely, by the allurements and plea&s;ures which its cultivation holds forth, in&s;inuate it&s;elf into general acceptance. But as it is of &s;ome con&s;equence, that a plan of in&s;truction in the polite arts &s;hould be devi&s;ed, which &s;o far from being incompatible with, might aid the promotion of branches of knowledge more immediately nece&s;&s;ary, it is propo&s;ed, that a limit|ed opportunity be offered in the colleges, and a full one in the univer&s;ity, to become acquainted with the principles as well as execution of every polite art. The effects of the&s;e elegant pur&s;uits on the mind and temper are of the mo&s;t beneficial nature. [Note N.] They may be emphatically denominat|ed the fini&s;hed offspring of civilization and refine|ment. Be&s;ides, a &s;y&s;tem of &s;ufficient comprehen|&s;ivene&s;s &s;hould contain a department for every &s;pe|cies of genius. Every &s;park of mental energy &s;hould be cheri&s;hed. The mind &s;hould be left free to chu&s;e its favourite object, and when cho&s;en &s;hould find the means of pro&s;ecuting it with ar|dour.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="034558_0077_0FFE28E2EB37DF90">
SUCH is the &s;y&s;tem propo&s;ed. Its imperfections are beyond doubt numerous. Of this fact, no man can be more &s;en&s;ible than their author. In the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of a &s;ubject, which has ably employed the pens of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed writers, without pro|ducing a general conviction of the preference of one plan over another, it became the writer to ex|erci&s;e as much diffidence as con&s;i&s;ts with the expo|&s;ition of truth. If he has manife&s;ted in any part of the preceding &s;peculations the appearance of arro|gant confidence in his own &s;entiments, he tru&s;ts it will be a&s;cribed to his impre&s;&s;ions of the importance of the &s;ubject, and not to a vain attachment to his peculiar ideas. He who is &s;olemnly impre&s;&s;ed with intere&s;ting truths, will think with energy, and ex|pre&s;s his thoughts with deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the univer&s;al agreement of all men in this country as to the nece&s;&s;ity of a re|form in education, &s;o e&s;&s;entially do their profe&s;&s;ions di&s;agree with their actions, that nothing &s;hort of the commanding eloquence of truth, without <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> thundered on their ears, can produce that concur|rence of action, that unity of effort, which &s;hall give efficiency to a wi&s;e &s;y&s;tem of education. Let then the voice of the good man mingle with that of the wi&s;e in announcing the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peedily adopt|ing &s;uch a mea&s;ure. In&s;tead of one party denoun|cing another for equivocal political crimes, let all parties unite in atte&s;ting their patrioti&s;m by their co-operating efforts in &s;o great a cau&s;e. Is it a
<PB N="80" REF="034558_0078_0FFE28A4181F4718">
que&s;tion with any man whether our liberties are &s;ecure? Let him know that they depend upon the knowledge of the people, and that this know|ledge depends upon a comprehen&s;ive and energetic &s;y&s;tem of education. It is true that &s;ome nations have been free without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a large portion of illumination; but their freedom has been precari|ous and accidental, and it has fallen as it ro&s;e.</P>
<P>THE two things which we are mo&s;t intere&s;ted in &s;ecuring are harmony at home, and re&s;pect abroad. By calling into active operation the mental re&s;our|ces of a nation, our political in&s;titutions will be rendered more perfect, ideas of ju&s;tice will be dif|fu&s;ed, the advantages of the undi&s;turbed enjoy|ment of tranquillity and indu&s;try will be perceived by every one, and our mutual dependence on each other will be rendered con&s;picuous. The great re&s;ult will be harmony. Di&s;cord and &s;trife have always proceeded from, or ri&s;en upon, ignorance and pa&s;&s;ion. When the fir&s;t has cea&s;ed to exi&s;t, and the la&s;t &s;hall be virtuou&s;ly directed, we &s;hall be deprived of every &s;ource of mi&s;under&s;tanding. The &s;word would not need a &s;cabbard, were all men en|lightened by a conviction of their true intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>HARMONY at home mu&s;t produce re&s;pect abroad. For the aera is at hand when America may hold the tables of ju&s;tice in her hand, and proclaim them to the unre&s;i&s;ting ob&s;ervance of the civilized world. Her numbers and her wealth vie with each other in
<PB N="81" REF="034558_0079_0FFE28E5D18D7438">
the rapidity of their increa&s;e. But the immutable wi&s;dom of her in&s;titutions will have a more efficient moral influence, than her phy&s;ical &s;trength. Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of both &s;he cannot fail to a&s;&s;ume, without competition, the &s;tation a&s;&s;igned her by an overrul|ing power.</P>
<P>SUCH is the bright pro&s;pect of national dignity and happine&s;s, if America give to her youth the advantages of a liberal and ju&s;t education. On the other hand, &s;hould avarice, prejudice, or malice, fru&s;trate this great object, and &s;hould a declen&s;ion of knowledge, gradually, but not the le&s;s deci&s;ively as to a future period, be &s;uffered to triumph, the pro&s;pect is gloomy and dreadful. Gigantic power mi&s;applied, towering ambition un&s;atiated with cri|minal gratification, avarice trampling poverty un|der foot, mark but a few of the dark &s;hades which will in all probability, envelop our political hori|zon. On &s;uch an event, we mu&s;t expect the mi|&s;eries of oppre&s;&s;ion at home, and conque&s;t abroad.</P>
<P>IT may intere&s;t the attention, as it certainly will amu&s;e the fancy, to trace the effects of the preced|ing principles of education on a future age. It has been ob&s;erved that however virtuous, enlightened and vigorous our fir&s;t efforts to aggrandize the hu|man character, it were, notwith&s;tanding, folly to expect the celerity of preternatural agency. A &s;y&s;tem founded on true principles mu&s;t gradually and cautiou&s;ly eradicate error, and &s;ub&s;titute truth. The period, will, therefore, be remote before the

<Q><P>IT is a view of delight to &s;tand or walk on the &s;hore &s;ide and to &s;ee a &s;hip to&s;&s;ed with tempe&s;t upon the &s;ea, or to be in a fortified tower, and to &s;ee two battles joined upon a plain. But it is
<PB N="83" REF="034558_0081_0FFE28E8B22DBFB8">
a plea&s;ure incomparable for the mind of man to be &s;ettled, landed and fortified in the certainty of truth, and from thence to de&s;cry and behold the errors, perturbations, labours and wanderings up and down of other men.</P></Q>
<P>THE love of knowledge, which even a moderate portion of information never fails to in&s;pire, would at the &s;ame time &s;hut up many &s;ources of mi&s;ery, and open more &s;ources of happine&s;s. The love of wealth would cea&s;e to be the predominant pa&s;&s;ion of the heart; other objects would divide the attention, and perhaps challenge and receive a more con&s;tant regard.</P>
<P>THE acqui&s;ition of knowledge is open to all. It injures no one. Its object is di&s;intere&s;ted. It de|lights in di&s;tinction only &s;o far as it increa&s;es the ma&s;s of public good. Here then is an object which all may pur&s;ue without the interference of one with another. So far from producing interference, it will con&s;tantly tend to de&s;troy it; for the more men think, the more they will re&s;emble each other, and the more they re&s;emble each other, the &s;tron|ger will their mutual attachment be.</P>
<P>II. VIEWING the effects of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem on the United States, the fir&s;t re&s;ult would be the giving perpetuity to tho&s;e political principles &s;o clo&s;ely connected with out pre&s;ent happine&s;s. In addition to the&s;e might be expected numerous improvements in our political economy.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="034558_0082_0FFE28ACB70D9CD8">
BY the&s;e means government without oppre&s;&s;ion, and protection without danger, will exi&s;t in their ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;trength.</P>
<P>POLITICS are acknowledged to be &s;till in their in|fancy. No circum&s;tance could &s;o rapidly promote the growth of this &s;cience as an univer&s;al illumina|tion of mind. The minds of millions centering in one point, could not fail to produce the &s;ubli|me&s;t di&s;coveries. Hence the pro&s;pect that our po|litical in&s;titutions would quickly mature into plans as perfect as human happine&s;s would require.</P>
<P>IF all the genius of a nation could be impelled into active exertion, philo&s;ophy, both moral and phy&s;ical, would &s;oon pre&s;ent a new face. Every new di&s;covery would probably tend to abridge the labour of the body, and to allow opportunity, as well as in&s;pire inclination, to cheri&s;h reflection. Man would feel him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two exten|&s;ive &s;ources of enjoyment, the exerci&s;e of the body, and the reflection of the mind; and he would &s;oon find the la&s;t as &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tate of things could not fail to elevate the United States far above other nations. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every &s;ource of happine&s;s, under the guardian&s;hip of all nece&s;&s;ary power, &s;he would &s;oon become a model for the nations of the earth. This leads in the third place to,</P>
<P>III. THE con&s;ideration of the effects of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem on the world.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="034558_0083_0FFE28EA5BEB6660">
NATION is influenced as powerfully by nation, as one individual is influenced by another. Hence no &s;ooner &s;hall any one nation demon&s;trate by prac|tical illu&s;tration the goodne&s;s of her political in&s;ti|tutions, than other nations will imperceptibly in|troduce corre&s;ponding features into their &s;y&s;tems. No truth is more certain, than that man will be happy if he can. He only wants a complete con|viction of the means, to pur&s;ue them with energy and &s;ucce&s;s. This conviction the United States may be de&s;tined to fla&s;h on the world.</P>
<P>INDEPENDENT of this nece&s;&s;ary effect, other effects will be produced. Many of the mo&s;t enlightened of our citizens will traver&s;e the globe with the &s;pi|rit of philo&s;ophical re&s;earch. They will carry with them valuable information and an ardent enthu|&s;ia&s;m to diffu&s;e it. Its diffu&s;ion will be the aera of reform wherever it goes.</P>
<P>BUT more important, &s;till, will be the example of the mo&s;t powerful nation on earth, if that exam|ple exhibit dignity, humility and intelligence. Scarcely a century can elap&s;e, before the population of America will be equal, and her power &s;uperior, to that of Europe. Should the principles be then e&s;tabli&s;hed, which have been contemplated, and the connection be demon&s;trated between human happine&s;s and the peaceable enjoyment of indu&s;try and the indulgence of reflection, we may expect to &s;ee America too enlightened and virtuous to &s;pread the horrors of war over the face of any country,
<PB N="86" REF="034558_0084_0FFE28AE38FF7DE0">
and too magnanimous and powerful to &s;uffer its exi&s;tence where &s;he can prevent it. Let us, then, with rapture anticipate the aera, when the triumph of peace and the prevalence of virtue &s;hall be ren|dered &s;ecure by the diffu&s;ion of u&s;eful knowledge.</P>

<Q><P>ASTRONOMY is not merely a &s;peculative &s;ci|ence; its u&s;e is as exten&s;ive as its re&s;earches are profound. To it, navigation owes its &s;afety; to it, commerce is in|debted for its exten&s;ion, and Geography for its improve|ment. But, what above all, &s;peaks its prai&s;e, is, that it has led the way to the diffu&s;ion of knowledge, and to the civilization of mankind.</P>

<Q><P>Too long have we been accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider as an authority, a duty of protection engraved by nature in our hearts. Contrary to the eternal order of thing, a power of admini&s;tration has been turned to the exclu&s;ive advan|tage of tho&s;e by whom it was exerci&s;ed. This mi&s;taken idea originated in the opinion long implicitly received, that man can belong to man, an atrocious &s;y&s;tem which the Romans modified in the days of their refinement, and which we propo&s;e totally to overthrow, by reducing the relations between father and child to kindne&s;s and be|nefits on the one &s;ide, and to re&s;pect and gratitude on the other.</P>

<Q><P>A ju&s;t ta&s;te in the fine arts, by &s;weetening and harmo|nizing the temper, is a &s;trong antidote to the turbulence of pa&s;&s;ion. Elegance of ta&s;te procures to a man &s;o much enjoyment at home, or ea&s;ily within reach, that, in or|der to be occupied, he is, in youth, under no temptation to precipitate into hunting, gaming, drinking; nor, in middle age, to avarice. A ju&s;t reli&s;h of what is beauti|ful, proper, elegant, and ornamental, in writing or painting, in architecture or gardening, is a fine prepa|ration for di&s;cerning what is beautiful, ju&s;t, elegant or magnanimous in character or behaviour.</P>
