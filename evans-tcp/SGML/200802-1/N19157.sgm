<ARGUMENT>
<P>IN obedience to the Orders of the <HI>HOUSE</HI> of <HI>REPRESENTATIVES</HI> of the fir&s;t and &s;econd days of November la&s;t, the fir&s;t directing the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury to report to the Hou&s;e &s;uch information as he may have obtained, re&s;pecting any diffi|culties which may have occurred in the execution of the Act "<HI>repealing, after the la&s;t day of June next, the duties heretofore laid upon di&s;tilled &s;pirits imported from abroad, and laying others in their &s;tead; and al&s;o upon &s;pirits di&s;tilled within the United States, and for appropriating the &s;ame,</HI>" together with his opinion thereupon; the &s;econd directing him to report to the Hou&s;e whether any, and what alterations in favor of the &s;pirits which &s;hall be di&s;tilled from articles of the growth or produce of the United States, or from foreign articles, within the &s;ame, can, in his opinion, be made in the act for laying duties upon &s;pirits di&s;tilled within the United States, con&s;i&s;tently with its main de&s;ign, and with the mainte|nance of the public faith&mdash;the &s;aid Secretary re&s;pectfully &s;ubmits the following</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>REPORT.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the &s;everal petitions and memorials which have been referred to the Secretary, as well as from various repre&s;entations which have been made to him, it appears that objections have ari&s;en in different quarters again&s;t the above mentioned act; which have in &s;ome in&s;tances embarra&s;&s;ed its execution, and in&s;pired a de&s;ire of its being repealed, in others have induced a wi&s;h that alterations may be made in &s;ome of its provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The&s;e objections have reference to a &s;uppo&s;ed tendency of the act: 1&s;t, To contravene the principles of liberty: 2dly, To injure morals: 3dly, To op|pre&s;s by heavy and exce&s;&s;ive penalties: 4thly, To injure indu&s;try and interfere with the bu&s;ine&s;s of di&s;tilling.</P>
<P>As to the &s;uppo&s;ed tendency of the act to contravene the principles of liber|ty, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of the &s;ubject, which have had place in and out of the Le|gi&s;lature, &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of more than a few brief general ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed that a revi&s;ion of the point cannot, in this re&s;pect, weaken the conviction which originally dictated the law.</P>
<P>There can &s;urely be nothing in the nature of an <HI>internal duty</HI> on a <HI>con&s;uma|ble</HI> commodity more incompatible with liberty, than in that of an external du|ty on a like commodity. A doctrine which a&s;&s;erts, that all duties of the for|mer kind (u&s;ually denominated exci&s;es) are incon&s;i&s;tent with the genius of a free government, is too violent and too little reconcilable with the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;o|ciety to be true. It would tend to deprive the government of what is in mo&s;t coun|tries a principal &s;ource of revenue, and by narrowing the di&s;tribution of taxes, would &s;erve to oppre&s;s particular kinds of indu&s;try. It would throw in the fir&s;t in&s;tance an undue proportion of the public burthen on the merchant and on the landholder.</P>
<P>This is one of tho&s;e ca&s;es in which names have an improper influence, and in which certain prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions exclude a due attention to facts.</P>
<P>Accordingly the law under con&s;ideration is complained of though free from the features, which have &s;erved in other ca&s;es to render laws on the &s;ame &s;ubject
<PB N="4" REF="024925_0003_0FCD81176055F058">
exceptionable. And though the differences have been pointed out, they have not only been overlooked, but the very things, which have been &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided in the formation of the law, are charged upon it, and that too from quarters where its operation would from circum&s;tances have worn the lea&s;t appearance of them.</P>
<P>It has been heretofore noticed, that the chief circum&s;tances, which in certain exci&s;e-laws have given occa&s;ion to the charge of their being unfriendly to li|berty, are not to be found in the act, which is the &s;ubject of this report; namely: 1&s;t, A &s;ummary and di&s;cretionary juri&s;diction in the exci&s;e officers contrary to the cour&s;e of the common law, and in abridgment of the right of trial by jury: and 2dly, A general power in the &s;ame officers to &s;earch and in&s;pect <HI>indi&s;criminately</HI> all the hou&s;es and buildings of the per&s;ons engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s to which the tax relates.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t particular, there is nothing in the act even to give colour to a charge of the kind again&s;t it, and accordingly it has not been brought. But as to the &s;econd, a very <HI>different power</HI> has been mi&s;taken for it, and the act is complained of as conferring that very power of indi&s;criminate &s;earch and in&s;pection.</P>
<P>The fact neverthele&s;s is otherwi&s;e. An officer, under the act in que&s;tion, can in&s;pect or &s;earch no hou&s;e or building, or even <HI>apartment</HI> of any hou&s;e or building, which has not been <HI>previou&s;ly entered</HI> and <HI>marked</HI> by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or as a place u&s;ed for di&s;tilling or keeping &s;pirits.</P>
<P>And even the power &s;o qualified is only applicable to di&s;tilleries from fo|reign materials, and in cities, towns and villages from dome&s;tic materials; that is only in ca&s;es in which the law contemplates that the bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on upon &s;uch a &s;cale as effectually to &s;eparate the <HI>di&s;tillery</HI> from the <HI>dwelling</HI> of the di&s;tiller. The di&s;tilleries &s;cattered over the country, which form much the greate&s;t part of the whole, are in no degree &s;ubject to di&s;cretionary in&s;pec|tion and &s;earch.</P>
<P>The true principle of the objection, which may be rai&s;ed to a general di&s;|cretionary power of in&s;pection and &s;earch is, that the <HI>domicil</HI> or <HI>dwelling</HI> of a citizen ought to be free from vexatious inqui&s;ition and intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>This principle cannot apply to a ca&s;e in which it is put in his own power to &s;eparate the place of his <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> from the place of his <HI>habitation,</HI> and by de|&s;ignating the former by vi&s;ible public marks, to avoid all intermeddling with the latter.</P>
<P>A di&s;tillery &s;eldom forms a part of the <HI>dwelling</HI> of its proprietor, and even where it does, it depends on him to direct and limit the power of vi&s;iting and &s;earch, by marking out the particular <HI>apartments</HI> which are &s;o employed.</P>
<P>But the requi&s;ition upon the di&s;tiller to &s;et marks on the building or apart|ments which he makes u&s;e of in his bu&s;ine&s;s, is one of the topics of complaint again&s;t the law. Such marks are repre&s;ented as a di&s;honorable badge. And thus a regulation, de&s;igned as much to conform with the feelings of the citi|zen, as for the &s;ecurity of the revenue, is converted into matter of objection.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;y to conceive what maxim of liberty is violated, by requiring per&s;ons, who carry on particular trades, which are made contributory to the revenue, to de&s;ignate by public marks the places in which they are carried on.
<PB N="5" REF="024925_0004_0FCD815BAE491348">
There can certainly be nothing more harmle&s;s or le&s;s inconvenient, than &s;uch a regulation. The thing it&s;elf is frequently done by per&s;ons of various call|ings for the information of cu&s;tomers; and why it &s;hould become a hard&s;hip or grievance, if required for a public purpo&s;e, can with difficulty be ima|gined.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed tendency of the act to injure morals &s;eems to have relation to the oaths, which are in a variety of ca&s;es required, and which are liable to the objection, that they give occa&s;ion to perjuries.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of requiring oaths, is whenever it occurs, matter of regret. It is certainly de&s;irable to avoid them as often and as far as po&s;&s;ible. But it is more ea&s;y to de&s;ire than to find a &s;ub&s;titute. The requiring of them is not peculiar to the act in que&s;tion. They are a common appendage of revenue laws, and are among the u&s;ual guards of tho&s;e laws, as they are of public and private rights in courts of ju&s;tice. They con&s;tantly occur in jury trials, to which the citizens of the United States are &s;o much and &s;o ju&s;tly attached. The &s;ame objection in different degrees lies again&s;t them in both ca&s;es. Yet it is not perceivable how they can be di&s;pen&s;ed with in either.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that <HI>both</HI> the kinds of &s;ecurity to the revenue, which are to be found in the act, the oaths of parties, and the in&s;pection of officers, are objected to. If they are both to be abandoned, it is not ea&s;y to imagine what &s;ecurity there can be for any &s;pecies of revenue, which is to be collected from articles of con&s;umption.</P>
<P>If precautions of this nature are incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty, and immoral, as there are very few indirect taxes, which can be collected without them, the con&s;equence mu&s;t be, that the entire or almo&s;t entire weight of the public burthens mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, fall upon fixed and vi&s;ible property, hou&s;es and lands, a con&s;equence which would be found in experiment productive of great inju&s;tice and inequality, and ruinous to agriculture.</P>
<P>It has been &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome di&s;tillers, that both the topics of complaint, which have been mentioned, might be obviated by a fixed rate of duty, ad|ju&s;ted according to a ratio compounded of the capacity of each &s;till, and the number and capacities of the ci&s;terns employed with it; but this and every &s;imilar method are objected to by other di&s;tillers, as tending to great inequa|lity, ari&s;ing from unequal &s;upplies of the material at different times and at dif|ferent places, from the different methods of di&s;tillation practi&s;ed by different di&s;tillers, and from the different degrees of activity in the bu&s;ine&s;s which ari&s;e from capitals more or le&s;s adequate.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of an examination of this point appears to be, that every &s;uch mode in ca&s;es in which the bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on upon an exten&s;ive &s;cale, would nece&s;&s;arily be attended with con&s;iderable inequalities; and upon the whole, would be le&s;s &s;atisfactory than the plan which has been adopted.</P>
<P>It is proved by the fulle&s;t information, that, in regard to di&s;tilleries, which are rated in the law, according to the capacity of each &s;till, the alternative of paying according to the quantity actually di&s;tilled is viewed in many parts of the United States as e&s;&s;ential to the equitable operation of the duty. And it is evident that &s;uch an alternative could not be allowed, but upon the condition of the party rendering upon oath an account of the quantity of &s;pirits di&s;tilled by him, without entirely defeating the duty.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="024925_0005_0FCD815EC6B8FE38">As to the charge that the penalties of the act are &s;evere and oppre&s;&s;ive, it is made in &s;uch general terms, and &s;o ab&s;olutely without the &s;pecification of a &s;in|gle particular, that it is difficult to imagine where it points.</P>
<P>The Secretary however has carefully reviewed the provi&s;ions of the act in this re&s;pect, and he is not able to di&s;cover any foundation for the charge.</P>
<P>The penalties it inflicts are in their nature the &s;ame with tho&s;e which are common in revenue laws, and in their degree comparitively moderate.</P>
<P>Pecuniary fines from fifty to five hundred dollars, and forfeiture of the arti|cle in re&s;pect to which there has been a failure to comply with the law, are the &s;evere&s;t penalties inflicted upon delinquent parties, except in a very few ca&s;es: In two, a forfeiture of the value of the article is added to that of the article it&s;elf, and in &s;ome others a forfeiture of the &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, and of the waggon or other in&s;trument of conveyance, a&s;&s;i&s;tant in a breach of the law is likewi&s;e involved.</P>
<P>Penalties like the&s;e for wilful and fraudulent breaches of an important law, cannot truly be deemed either unu&s;ual or exce&s;&s;ive. They are le&s;s than tho&s;e which &s;ecure the laws of impo&s;t, and as moderate as can promi&s;e &s;ecurity to any object of revenue, which is capable of being evaded.</P>
<P>There appears to be but one provi&s;ion in the law which admits of a que&s;tion, whether the penalty pre&s;cribed may not partake of &s;everity. It is that which inflicts the pains of perjury on any per&s;on who &s;hall be convicted of "wilfully taking a fal&s;e oath or affirmation in any of the ca&s;es in which oaths or affirma|tions are required by the act."</P>
<P>Precedents in relation to this particular vary. In many of them the penalties are le&s;s &s;evere, than for perjury in courts of ju&s;tice; in others they are the &s;ame. The latter are generally of the late&s;t date, and &s;eem to have been the re&s;ult of experience.</P>
<P>The United States have in other ca&s;es pur&s;ued the &s;ame principle as in the law in que&s;tion. And the practice is certainly founded on &s;trong rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The additional &s;ecurity which it gives to the revenue cannot be doubt|ed. Many who would ri&s;k pecuniary forfeitures and penalties would not en|counter the more di&s;graceful puni&s;hment annexed to perjury.</P>
<P N="2">2. There &s;eems to be no &s;olid di&s;tinction between one fal&s;e oath in violation of law and right, and another fal&s;e oath in violation of law and right. A di&s;|tinction in the puni&s;hments of different &s;pecies of fal&s;e &s;wearing is calculated to beget fal&s;e opinions concerning the &s;anctity of an oath; and by countenancing an impre&s;&s;ion that a violation of it is le&s;s heinous in the ca&s;es in which it is le&s;s puni&s;hed, it tends to impair in the mind that &s;crupulous veneration for the ob|ligation of an oath which ought always to prevail, and not only to facilitate a breach of it in the ca&s;es which the laws have marked with le&s;s odium, but to prepare the mind for committing the crime in other ca&s;es.</P>
<P>So far is the law under con&s;ideration from being chargeable with particu|lar &s;everity, that there are to be found in it marks of more than common attention to prevent its operating &s;everely or oppre&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="024925_0006_0FCD8160EACB75A8">The 43d &s;ection of the act contains a &s;pecial provi&s;ion (and one which it is believed is not to be found in any law enacted in this country prior to the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the United States) by which forfeitures and penalties incurred without an intention of fraud or wilful negligence may be mitigated or remitted.</P>
<P>This mild and equitable provi&s;ion is an effectual guard again&s;t &s;uffering, or inconvenience in con&s;equence of unde&s;igned tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the law.</P>
<P>The 38th &s;ection contains a provi&s;ion in favor of per&s;ons, who though in|nocent may accidentally &s;uffer by &s;eizures of their property (in the execu|tion of the revenue laws &s;ometimes unavoidably happens) which is perhaps entirely peculiar to the law under con&s;ideration. Where there has even been a <HI>probable</HI> cau&s;e of &s;eizure, &s;ufficient to acquit an officer, the jury are to a&s;&s;e&s;s whatever damages may have accrued, from any injury to the article &s;eized, with an allowance for the detention of it at the rate of &s;ix per centum per an|num of the value, which damages are to be paid out of the public trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>There are other provi&s;ions of the act which mark the &s;crupulous attention of the government, to protect the parties concerned from inconvenience and injury, and which con&s;pire to vindicate the law from imputations of &s;everity or oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed tendency of the act to injure indu&s;try, and interfere with the bu&s;ine&s;s of di&s;tilling, is endeavored to be &s;upported by &s;ome general and &s;ome &s;pecial rea&s;ons; both having relation to the effect of the duty upon the manu|facture.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the fir&s;t kind affirm generally, that duties on home manufactures are impolitic, becau&s;e they tend to di&s;courage them; that they are particularly &s;o, when they are laid on articles manufactured from the produce of the coun|try, becau&s;e they have then the additional effect of injuring agriculture; that it is the general policy of nations to protect and promote their own manufac|tures; e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are wrought out of dome&s;tic materials; that the law in que&s;tion interferes with this policy.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervations of this kind admit of an ea&s;y an&s;wer. Duties on manufactures tend to di&s;courage them or not, according to the circum&s;tances under which they are laid, and are impolitic or not, according to the &s;ame circum&s;tances. When a manufacture is in its infancy, it is impolitic to tax it; becau&s;e the tax would be both unproductive, and would add to the difficulties, which naturally impede the fir&s;t attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h a new manufacture, &s;o as to endanger its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>But when a manufacture (as in the ca&s;e of di&s;tilled &s;pirits in the United States) is arrived at maturity, it is as fit an article of taxation as any other. No good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, why the con&s;umer of a dome&s;tic commodity &s;hould not contribute &s;omething to the public revenue, when the con&s;umer of a fo|reign commodity contributes to it largely. And as a general rule it is not to be di&s;puted, that duties on articles of con&s;umption are paid by the con&s;umers.</P>
<P>To the manufacture it&s;elf the duty is no injury, if an equal duty be laid on the rival foreign article. And when a greater duty is laid upon the latter than upon the former, as in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the difference is a bounty on the
<PB N="8" REF="024925_0007_0FCD8161B2169DD8">
dome&s;tic article, and operates as an encouragement of the manufacture. The manufacturer can afford to &s;ell his fabric the cheaper, in proportion to that difference, and is &s;o far enabled to under&s;ell and &s;upplant the dealer in the foreign article.</P>
<P>The principle of the objection would tend to confine all taxes to imported articles, and would deprive the government of re&s;ources which are indi&s;pen&s;i|ble to a due provi&s;ion for the public &s;afety and welfare; contrary to the plain intention of the con&s;titution, which gives expre&s;s power to employ tho&s;e re|&s;ources when nece&s;&s;ary; a power which is found in all governments, and is e&s;&s;ential to their efficiency, and even to their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Duties on articles of internal production and manufacture form in every country the principal &s;ources of revenue. Tho&s;e on imported articles can only be carried to a certain extent, without defeating their object; by operating either as prohibitions; or as bounties upon &s;muggling. They are moreover in &s;ome degree temporary; for as the growth of manufactures dimini&s;hes the quantum of duty on imports, the public revenue, cea&s;ing to ari&s;e from that &s;ource, mu&s;t be derived f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m articles which the national indu&s;try has &s;ub&s;titu|ted for tho&s;e previou&s;ly imported. If the government cannot then re&s;ort to internal means for the additional &s;upplies, which the exigencies of every na|tion call for, it will be unable to perform its duty or even to pre&s;erve its ex|i&s;tence. The community mu&s;t be unprotected, and the &s;ocial compact be di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;ons, that a duty ought not to be laid on an article manu|factured out of the produce of the country (which is the point mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted upon) it ought not to be laid upon the produce it&s;elf, nor con&s;equently upon the land, which is the in&s;trument of that produce; becau&s;e taxes are laid up|on <HI>land</HI> as the <HI>fund</HI> out of which the <HI>income</HI> of the proprietor is drawn, or, in other words, <HI>on account of its produce.</HI> There ought, therefore, on the prin|ciple of the objection, to be neither taxes on land nor on the produce of land, nor on articles manufactured from that produce. And if a nation &s;hould be in a condition to &s;upply it&s;elf, with its own manufactures, there could then be very little or no revenue, of cour&s;e there mu&s;t be a want of the e&s;&s;ential means of national ju&s;tice and national &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Po&s;itions like the&s;e, however well meant by tho&s;e who urge them, refute them&s;elves, becau&s;e they tend to the di&s;&s;olution of government, by rendering it incapable of providing for the objects for which it is in&s;tituted.</P>
<P>However true the allegation that it is and ought to be the prevailing policy of nations to cheri&s;h their own manufactures, it is equally true that nations in general lay duties for the purpo&s;e of revenue on their own manufactures; and it is obvious to a demon&s;tration that it may be done without injury to them. The mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful nations in manufactures have drawn the large&s;t revenues from the mo&s;t u&s;eful of them. It merits particular attention, that ardent &s;pirits are an article, which has been generally deemed and made u&s;e of, as one of the fitte&s;t objects of revenue, and to an extent in other countries, which bears no compari&s;on with what has been done in the United States.</P>
<P>The &s;pecial rea&s;ons alluded to are of different kinds.&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">I. It is &s;aid, that the act in que&s;tion by laying a &s;maller <HI>additional</HI> duty on foreign &s;pirits, than the duty on home-made &s;pirits, has a tendency to di&s;cou|rage the manufacture of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="024925_0008_0FCD816337DD7BB0">This objection merits con&s;ideration, and as far as it may appear to have foundation ought to be obviated.</P>
<P>The point however &s;eems not to have been viewed in all re&s;pects in a cor|rect light.</P>
<P>Before the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the United States began to operate, the regulations of the different &s;tates, re&s;pecting di&s;tilled &s;pirits were very di&s;&s;i|milar. In &s;ome of them, duties were laid on foreign &s;pirits only, in others, on dome&s;tic as well as foreign. The ab&s;olute duty in the former in&s;tances, and the difference of duty in the latter, was upon an average, con&s;iderably le&s;s than the pre&s;ent difference in the duties on foreign and home-made &s;pirits. If to this be added the effect of the uniform operation of the exi&s;ting duties throughout the United States, it is ea&s;y to infer that the &s;ituation of our own di&s;tilleries is, in the main, much better, as far as they are affected by the laws, than it was previous to the pa&s;&s;ing of any act of the United States upon the &s;ubject. They have therefore upon the whole gained materially under the &s;y&s;tem which has been pur&s;ued by the national government.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t law of the United States on this head laid a duty of no more than eight cents per gallon on tho&s;e of Jamaica proof. The &s;econd encrea&s;ed the duty on foreign &s;pirits to twelve cents per gallon of the lowe&s;t proof, and by certain gradations to fifteen cents per gallon of Jamaica proof. The la&s;t act places the duty at twenty cents per gallon of the lowe&s;t proof, and extends it by the like gradations to twenty-five cents per gallon of Jamaica proof, laying al&s;o a duty of eleven cents per gallon on home-made &s;pirits di&s;tilled from foreign materials of the lowe&s;t proof, with a like gradual exten&s;ion to fifteen cents per gallon of Jamaica proof; and a duty of nine cents per gallon on home-made &s;pirits di&s;tilled from dome&s;tic materials of the lowe&s;t proof, with the like gradual exten&s;ion to thirteen cents per gallon of Jamaica proof.</P>
<P>If the tran&s;ition had been immediate from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t law, it could not have failed to have been con&s;idered as a change in favor of our own di&s;til|leries, as far as the rate of duty is concerned. The mean duty on <HI>foreign &s;pi|rits</HI> by the fir&s;t law was nine cents, by the la&s;t the mean <HI>extra</HI>-duty on foreign &s;pirits is in fact about eleven cents, as it regards &s;pirits di&s;tilled from <HI>foreign</HI> materials, and about thirteen, as it regards &s;pirits di&s;tilled from <HI>dome&s;tic</HI> mate|rials. In making this computation it is to be adverted to, that the four fir&s;t degrees of proof mentioned in the law corre&s;pond with the different kinds of &s;pirits u&s;ually imported, while the generality of tho&s;e made in the United States are of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of proof.</P>
<P>Spirits from dome&s;tic materials derived a double advantage from the la&s;t law, that is, from the encrea&s;ed rate of duty on foreign imported &s;pirits, and from a higher rate of duty on home-made &s;pirits of foreign materials.</P>
<P>But the intervention of the &s;econd law has &s;erved to produce in &s;ome places a different impre&s;&s;ion of the bu&s;ine&s;s, than would have happened without it. By a con&s;iderable addition to the duties on foreign &s;pirits, without laying any thing on tho&s;e of home manufacture, it has &s;erved to give to the la&s;t law the ap|pearance of taking away a part of the advantages previou&s;ly &s;ecured to the do|me&s;tic di&s;tilleries. It &s;eems to have been overlooked, that the &s;econd act ought in reality to be reviewed only as an intermediate &s;tep to the arrangement finally contemplated by the legi&s;lature; and that as part of a &s;y&s;tem, it has upon the whole operated in favor of the national di&s;tilleries. The thing to be con&s;ider|ed is the &s;ub&s;tantial exi&s;ting difference in favor of the home manufacture, as the law now &s;tands.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="024925_0009_0FCD8E4B169AD998">The advantage, indeed, to the di&s;tillation of &s;pirits from the produce of the country ari&s;ing from the difference between the duties on &s;pirits di&s;tilled from foreign and tho&s;e di&s;tilled from dome&s;tic materials, is exclu&s;ively the work of the la&s;t act, and is an advantage which has not been properly appreciated by tho&s;e di&s;tillers of &s;pirits from home produce, who have complained of the law, as hurtful to their manufacture.</P>
<P>Cau&s;es entirely foreign to the law it&s;elf have al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted in producing mi&s;ap|prehen&s;ion. The approximation of the price of home-made &s;pirits to that of foreign &s;pirits, which has of late taken place, and which is attributed to the operation of the act in que&s;tion is in a great degree owing to the circum&s;tances, which have tended to rai&s;e the price of mola&s;&s;es in the We&s;t-India market, and to an extra-importation of foreign &s;pirits prior to the fir&s;t of July la&s;t, to avoid the payment of the additional duty which then took place.</P>
<P>It is &s;tated in the petition from Salem, that previous to the la&s;t act, the price of dome&s;tic to foreign &s;pirits was as 1<HI>&s;</HI>9 to 3<HI>&s;</HI>4, of the money of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, per gallon, and that &s;ince that act it has become as 3<HI>&s;</HI>3 to 4<HI>&s;</HI>2.</P>
<P>It is evident that a ri&s;e from 1<HI>&s;</HI>9 to 3<HI>&s;</HI>3 per gallon, which would be equal to 20 cents, is not to be attributed wholly to a duty of eleven cents. Indeed if there were a concurrence of no other cau&s;e, the inference would be very different from that intended to be drawn from the fact, for it would evince a profit gained to the di&s;tiller of more than eighty per cent. on the duty.</P>
<P>It is however meant to be under&s;tood, that this approximation of prices occa&s;ions a greater importation and con&s;umption of foreign, and a le&s;s con|&s;umption of dome&s;tic &s;pirits than formerly. How far this may or may not be the ca&s;e, the Secretary is not now able to &s;ay with preci&s;ion; but no facts have come under his notice officially, which &s;erve to authenticate the &s;ug|ge&s;tion. And it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, as po&s;&s;ible, that repre&s;entations of this kind, are rather the effect of appprehen&s;ion than of experience. It would even be not unnatural, that a con&s;iderable enhancement of the prices of the foreign article &s;hould have led to a greater con&s;umption of the dome&s;tic article, as the cheape&s;t of the two, though dearer it&s;elf than formerly.</P>
<P>But while there is ground to believe that the &s;ugge&s;tions which have been made on this point are in many re&s;pects inaccurate and mi&s;conceived, there are known circum&s;tances, which &s;eem to render advi&s;eable, &s;ome greater dif|ference between the duties on foreign and on home-made &s;pirits. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances have been noticed in the report of the Secretary on the &s;ubject of manufactures, and an alteration has been propo&s;ed by laying two cents in ad|ditition upon imported &s;pirits of the lowe&s;t proof, with a proportional increa&s;e on the higher proofs, and by deducting one cent from the duty on the lowe&s;t proof of home made &s;pirits, with a proportional diminution in re&s;pect to the higher proofs.</P>
<P>This alteration would bring the proportion of the duties nearly to the &s;tandard, which the petitioner Hendrick Doyer, who appears likely to be well informed on the &s;ubject, repre&s;ents as the proper one to enable the di&s;tillation of geneva to be carried on with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ame advantage as before the pa&s;&s;ing of the act. He ob&s;erves that the duty on home-made geneva being 9 cents the additional duty on foreign ought to have been 12 cents. By the alteration propo&s;ed, the proportion will be as 10 to 8 which is little different to that of 12 to 9.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="024925_0010_0FCD8E4C8A8E3D70">It is worthy of remark, that the &s;ame petitioner &s;tates, that previous to the pa&s;&s;ing of the act, of which he complains, he "could &s;ell his geneva 16 &frac14; per cent. under the price of Holland geneva, but that he cannot do it at pre&s;ent, and in future lower, than 14 per cent." If, as he al&s;o &s;tates, the quality of his geneva be equal to that of Holland, and if his meaning be as it appears to be, that he can now afford to &s;ell his geneva lower by 14 per cent. than the ge|neva of Holland, it will follow that the manufacture of that article is in a very thriving train, even under the pre&s;ent rate of duties. For a difference of 14 per cent. in the price is capable of giving a decided preference to the &s;ale of the dome&s;tic article.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is objected that the duty, by being laid in the fir&s;t in&s;tance upon the di&s;tiller, in&s;tead of the con&s;umer, makes a larger capital nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s, and in this country, where capitals are not large, puts the national di&s;tillers under di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>But this inconvenience, as far as it has foundation, in the &s;tate of things, is e&s;&s;entially obviated by the credits given. Where the duty is payable upon the quantity di&s;tilled, a credit is allowed, which cannot be le&s;s than &s;ix, and may extend to nine months. Where the duty is charged on the capacity of the &s;till, it is payable half yearly. Sufficient time is therefore allowed to rai&s;e the duty from the &s;ale of the article, which &s;uper&s;edes the nece&s;&s;ity of a greater capital. It is well known, that the article is one u&s;ually &s;old for ca&s;h, or at &s;hort credit. If the&s;e ob&s;ervations are not applicable to di&s;tilleries in the inte|rior country, the &s;ame may be &s;aid in a great degree of the objection it&s;elf. The cour&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s in that quarter, renders a con&s;iderable capital le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than el&s;ewhere. The produce of the di&s;tillers own farm, or of the neighbouring farms, brought to be di&s;tilled upon &s;hares or compen&s;ations in the article it&s;elf, con&s;titute the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of the di&s;tilleries in the remote parts of the country. In the comparatively few in&s;tances, in which they may be pro&s;ecuted as a regular bu&s;ine&s;s, upon a large &s;cale, by force of capital, the ob&s;ervations which have been made will &s;ub&s;tantially apply.</P>
<P>The collection of the duty from the di&s;tiller has, on the other hand, &s;everal advantages. It contributes to equality, by charging the article in the fir&s;t &s;tage of its progre&s;s, which diffu&s;es the duty among all cla&s;&s;es alike. It the better &s;ecures the collection of the revenue, by confining the re&s;pon&s;ibility to a &s;maller number of per&s;ons, and &s;implifying the proce&s;s. And it avoids the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;o great a number of officers as would be required in a more dif|fu&s;e &s;y&s;tem of collection, operating immediately upon purcha&s;ers and con&s;um|ers. Be&s;ides, that the latter plan would transfer whatever inconveniencies may be incident to the collection, from a &s;maller to a greater number of per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is alledged that the in&s;pection of the officers is injurious to the bu|&s;ine&s;s of di&s;tilling, by laying open its &s;ecrets or my&s;teries.</P>
<P>Different di&s;tillers, there is no doubt, practi&s;e, in certain re&s;pects, different methods in the cour&s;e of their bu&s;ine&s;s, and have different degrees of &s;kill. But it may well be doubted whether in a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o old and &s;o much diffu&s;ed as that of the di&s;tillation of &s;pirits, there are, at this day, &s;ecrets of con&s;equence to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>There will at lea&s;t be no hazard in taking it for granted, that none &s;uch exi&s;t in regard to the di&s;tillation of rum from mola&s;&s;es or &s;ugar, or of the &s;pi|rits
<PB N="12" REF="024925_0011_0FCD8E50523AA040">
from grain u&s;ually called whi&s;key, or of brandies from the fruits of this country. The ca&s;es in which the allegations are made with mo&s;t colour, ap|ply to geneva, and perhaps to certain cordials.</P>
<P>It is probable, that the cour&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s might and would always be &s;uch, as in fact to involve no inconvenience on this &s;core. But as the contrary is affirmed, and as it is de&s;irable to obviate complaint as far as it can be done, con&s;i&s;tently with e&s;&s;ential principles and objects, it may not be unadvi&s;able to attempt a remedy.</P>
<P>It is to be pre&s;umed, that if any &s;ecrets exi&s;t, they relate to a primary proce&s;s, particularly the mixture of the ingredients; this, it is &s;uppo&s;eable, cannot take a greater time each day, than two hours. If therefore, the officers of in&s;pec|tion were enjoined to forbear their vi&s;its to the part of the di&s;tillery commonly made u&s;e of for &s;uch proce&s;s, during a &s;pace not exceeding two hours each day to be notified by the di&s;tiller, there is ground to conclude that it would obvi|ate the objection.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The regulations for marking of ca&s;ks and ve&s;&s;els, as well as hou&s;es and buildings, al&s;o furni&s;h matter of complaint.</P>
<P>This complaint, as it regards hou&s;es and buildings, has been already adverted to: But there is a light in which it is made that has not yet been taken no|tice of.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the requiring the doors of the apartments as well as the outer door of each building to be marked, impo&s;es unnece&s;&s;ary trouble.</P>
<P>When it is con&s;idered how little trouble or expence attends the execution of this provi&s;ion, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and that the marks once &s;et will endure for a great length of time, the objection to it appears to be without weight.</P>
<P>But the provi&s;ion, as it relates to the apartments of buildings, has for its immediate object the convenience of the di&s;tillers them&s;elves. It is calculated to avoid the very evil of an indi&s;criminate &s;earch of their hou&s;es and buildings, by enabling them to de&s;ignate the <HI>particular apartments,</HI> which are employed for the purpo&s;es of their bu&s;ine&s;s, and to &s;ecure all others from in&s;pection and vi&s;itation.</P>
<P>The complaint, as it re&s;pects the marking of ca&s;ks and ve&s;&s;els, has &s;omewhat more foundation. It is repre&s;ented (and upon careful enquiry appears to be true) that through long e&s;tabli&s;hed prejudice, home-made &s;pirits of <HI>equal qua|lity</HI> with foreign, if known to be home-made, will not command an equal price. This particularly applies to geneva.</P>
<P>If the want of a di&s;tinction between foreign and home-made &s;pirits were an occa&s;ion of fraud upon con&s;umers, by impo&s;ing a wor&s;e for a better commo|dity, it would be a rea&s;on for continuing it; but as far as &s;uch a di&s;tinction gives operation to a mere prejudice, favorable to a foreign, and injurious to a dome&s;tic manufacture, it furni&s;hes a rea&s;on for aboli&s;hing it.</P>
<P>Though time might be expected to remove the prejudice, the progre&s;s of the dome&s;tic manufacture, in the interval, might be materially checked.</P>
<P>It appears therefore expedient to remove this ground of complaint by au|thori&s;ing the &s;ame marks and certificates, both for foreign and for home made geneva.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="024925_0012_0FCD8E51AF061218">Perhaps indeed it may not be unadvi&s;eable to ve&s;t &s;omewhere a di&s;cretionary power to regulate the forms of certificates, which are to accompany, and the particular marks, which are to be &s;et upon ca&s;ks and ve&s;&s;els containing &s;pirits, generally, as may be found convenient in practice.</P>
<P>Another &s;ource of objection with regard to the marking of ca&s;ks is, that there is a general prohibition again&s;t defacing, or altering the marks, and a penalty upon doing it, which prevents the u&s;ing of the &s;ame ca&s;ks more than once, and occa&s;ions wa&s;te, lo&s;s and embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>It is conceived, that this prohibition does not extend to the effacing of old marks and placing of new ones by the officers of the revenue, or in their pre|&s;ence and by their authority. But as real inconveniencies would attend a contrary con&s;truction, and there is &s;ome room for que&s;tion, it appears de&s;irea|ble that all doubt &s;hould be removed, by an explicit provi&s;ion to enable the officer to efface old marks and &s;ub&s;titute new ones, when ca&s;ks have been emp|tied of their former contents, and are wanted for new u&s;e.</P>
<P N="5">V. The requi&s;ition to keep an account from day to day of the quantity of &s;pirits di&s;tilled is repre&s;ented both as a hard&s;hip and impo&s;&s;ible to be com|plied with.</P>
<P>But the Secretary is unable to perceive that it can ju&s;tly be viewed either in the one or in the other light. The trouble of &s;etting down in the evening the work of the day, in a book prepared for and furni&s;hed to the party mu&s;t be incon&s;iderable, and the doing of it would even conduce to accuracy in bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The idea of impracticability mu&s;t have ari&s;en from &s;ome mi&s;conception. It &s;eems to involve a &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;omething is required different from the truth of the fact. Spirits di&s;tilled are u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed into high wines, proof &s;pirits, and low wines. It is certainly po&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s each day the quantity of each kind produced, and where one kind is converted into another, to explain it by brief notes, &s;hewing in proper columns the re&s;ults in tho&s;e kinds of &s;pirits which are ultimately prepared for &s;ale.</P>
<P>A revi&s;ion is now making of the forms at fir&s;t tran&s;mitted, and it is not doubted that it will be ea&s;y to obviate the objection of impracticability.</P>
<P>On full reflection the Secretary is of opinion, that the requi&s;ition in this re&s;pect is a rea&s;onable one, and that it is of importance to the due collection of the revenue, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e ca&s;es, where, by the alternative allowed in favor of country di&s;tilleries, the oath of a party is the only evidence of the quantity produced. It is u&s;eful in every &s;uch ca&s;e to give the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible <HI>preci&s;ion</HI> to the object which is to be atte&s;ted.</P>
<P N="6">VI. It is alledged as a hard&s;hip, that di&s;tillers are held re&s;pon&s;ible for the duties on &s;pirits which are exported, till certain things difficult to be per|formed are done, in order to entitle the exporter to the drawback.</P>
<P>This is a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion. The drawback is at all events to be paid in &s;ix months, which is as early as the duty can become payable, and frequently earlier than it does become payable. And the government relies on the bond of the exporter for a fulfilment of the conditions upon which the drawback is allowed.</P>
<P>An explanation to the &s;everal collectors of this point, which has taken place &s;ince the complaint appeared, will have removed the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="024925_0013_0FCD8E5511E6EA90">The &s;ame explanation will obviate another objection founded on the &s;up|po&s;ition that the bond of the di&s;tiller and that of the exporter are for a like purpo&s;e. The latter is merely to &s;ecure the landing of the goods in a foreign country, and will often continue depending after every thing relative to duty and drawback has been liquidated and fini&s;hed.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It is an article of complaint that no drawback is allowed in ca&s;e of &s;hipwreck when &s;pirits are &s;ent from one port to another in the United States.</P>
<P>There does not occur any objection to a provi&s;ion for making an allowance of that kind, which would tend to alleviate misfortune and give &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The nece&s;&s;ity of twenty-four hours notice, in order to the benefit of drawback on the exportation of &s;pirits, and the prohibition to remove them from a di&s;tillery after &s;un&s;et, except in the pre&s;ence of an officer, are repre&s;ented as embarra&s;&s;ments to bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The length of notice required appears greater than is nece&s;&s;ary. It is not perceived, that any inconvenience would ari&s;e, from reducing the time to &s;ix hours.</P>
<P>But it is not conceived to be nece&s;&s;ary or expedient to make an alteration in the la&s;t mentioned particular. The prohibition is of real con&s;equence to the &s;ecurity of the revenue. The cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s will readily adapt it&s;elf to it, and the pre&s;ence of an officer in extraordinary ca&s;es will afford due accom|modation.</P>
<P N="9">IX. It is &s;tated as a hard&s;hip, that there is no allowance for leakage and wa&s;tage in the ca&s;e of &s;pirits &s;hipped from one &s;tate to another.</P>
<P>The law for the collection of the duties on imports and tonnage allows two per cent. for leakage on &s;pirits imported. A &s;imilar allowance on home made &s;pirits at the di&s;tillery, does not appear le&s;s proper.</P>
<P N="10">X. It is mentioned as a grievance, that di&s;tillers are required to give bond <HI>with &s;urety</HI> for the amount of the duties, and that the &s;ufficiency of the &s;urety is made to depend on the di&s;cretion of the chief officer of in&s;pection.</P>
<P>The requiring of &s;ureties can be no more a hard&s;hip on di&s;tillers than on importing merchants, and every other per&s;on to whom the public afford a credit. It is a natural con&s;equence of the credit allowed; and a very rea|&s;onable condition of the indulgence, which without this precaution might be imprudent, and injurious to the United States.</P>
<P>The party has his option to avoid it by prompt payment o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the duty, and is even entitled to an abatement, which may be con&s;idered as a premium if he elects to do &s;o.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd point, if &s;ureties are to be given, there mu&s;t be &s;ome per|&s;on on the part of the government to judge of their &s;ufficiency, otherwi&s;e the thing it&s;elf would be nugatory; and the di&s;cretion cannot be ve&s;ted more conveniently for the party than in the chief officer of in&s;pection for the &s;urvey.</P>
<P>A view has now been taken of mo&s;t, if not of all, the objections of a general nature, which have appeared.</P>
<P>Some few of a local complexion remain to be attended to.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="024925_0014_0FCD8E5700C3B978">The repre&s;entation &s;igned Edward Cook, chairman, as on behalf of the four mo&s;t we&s;tern counties of Penn&s;ylvania, &s;tates, that the di&s;tance of that part of the country from a market for its produce leads to a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;til|ling the grain, which is rai&s;ed, as a principal dependance of its inhabitants; which circum&s;tance and the &s;carcity of ca&s;h combine to render the tax in que&s;tion unequal, oppre&s;&s;ive, and particularly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to them.</P>
<P>As to the circum&s;tance of equality, it may &s;afely be affirmed to be impracti|cable to devi&s;e a tax which &s;hall operate with exact equality upon every part of the community. Local and other circum&s;tances will inevitably create di&s;|parities more or le&s;s great.</P>
<P>Taxes on con&s;umable articles have upon the whole better preten&s;ions to equality than any other. If &s;ome of them fall more heavily on particular parts of the community, others of them are chiefly borne by other parts. And the re&s;ult is an equalization of the burthen as far as is attainable. Of this cla&s;s of taxes it is not ea&s;y to conceive one which can operate with greater equality than a tax on di&s;tilled &s;pirits. There appears to be no article, as far as the information of the Secretary goes, which is an object of more equal con&s;ump|tion throughout the United States.</P>
<P>In particular di&s;tricts a greater u&s;e of cyder may occa&s;ion a &s;maller con&s;ump|tion of &s;pirits; but it will not be found on a clo&s;e examination that it makes a material difference. A greater or le&s;s u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits, as far as it exi&s;ts, &s;eems to depend more on relative habits of &s;obriety or intemperance than on any other cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As far as habits of le&s;s moderation, in the u&s;e of di&s;tilled &s;pirits, &s;hould pro|duce inequality any where, it would certainly not be a rea&s;on with the legi&s;la|ture either to repeal or le&s;&s;en a tax, which by rendering the article dearer might tend to re&s;train too free an indulgence of &s;uch habits.</P>
<P>It is certainly not obvious how this tax can operate particularly unequally upon the part of the country in que&s;tion. As a general rule it is a true one, that duties on articles of con&s;umption fall on the con&s;umers, by being added to the price of the commodity. This is illu&s;trated in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance by facts. Previous to the law laying a duty on home made &s;pirits the price of whi&s;|key was about thirty-eight cents; it is now about fifty-&s;ix cents. Other cau&s;es may have contributed in &s;ome degree to this effect, but it is evidently to be a&s;cribed chiefly to the duty.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s, therefore, the inhabitants of the counties, which have been men|tioned are greater con&s;umers of &s;pirits, than tho&s;e of other parts of the country, they cannot pay a greater proportion of the tax. If they are, it is their inte|re&s;t to become le&s;s &s;o. It depends on them&s;elves by dimini&s;hing the con&s;ump|tion to re&s;tore equality.</P>
<P>The argument, that they are obliged to convert their grain into &s;pirits in order to tran&s;portation to di&s;tant markets, does not prove the point alledged. The duty on all they &s;end to tho&s;e markets will be paid by the purcha&s;ers. They will &s;till pay only upon their own con&s;umption.</P>
<P>As far as an advance is laid upon the duty, or as far as the difference o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> duty between whi&s;key and other &s;pirits tends to favour a greater con&s;umption of the latter, they as greater manufacturers of the article, &s;uppo&s;ing this fact to be as &s;tated, will be proportionably benefited.</P>

From the communications which have been received, &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ing of the act, it appears, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat paying the rate annexed to the capacity of the &s;till, and u&s;ing great diligence, the duty may be in fact reduced to &s;ix cents per gallon. Let the average be taken at &s;even and a half cents which is probably higher than is really paid.</P>
<P>Generally &s;peaking, then, for every gallon of whi&s;key which is con&s;umed, the con&s;umer may be &s;uppo&s;ed to pay &s;even and a half cents; but for every gal|lon of &s;pirits di&s;tilled from foreign materials the con&s;umer pays at lea&s;t eleven cents, and for every gallon of foreign &s;pirits at lea&s;t twenty cents. The con&s;u|mer therefore of foreign &s;pirits pays nearly three times the duty, and the con|&s;umer of home made &s;pirits from foreign materials nearly fifty per cent. more duty, on the &s;ame quantity, than the con&s;umer of &s;pirits from dome&s;tic mate|rials, exclu&s;ive of the greater price in both ca&s;es, which is an additional charge upon each of the two fir&s;t mentioned cla&s;&s;es of con&s;umers.</P>
<P>When it is con&s;idered that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">/21 parts of the whole quantity of &s;pirits con&s;u|med in the United States are foreign, and 7/21 parts are of foreign materials, and that the inhabitants of the Atlantic and mid-land countries are the principal con&s;umers of the&s;e more highly taxed articles, it cannot be inferred, that the tax under con&s;ideration bears particularly hard on the inhabitants of the we&s;t|ern country.</P>
<P>This may &s;erve as an exemplification of a general propo&s;ition of material con&s;equence, namely, that, if the former de&s;criptions of citizens are able from &s;ituation to obtain more for their produce that the latter, they contribute pro|portionally more to the revenue. Numerous other examples in confirmation of this might be adduced.</P>
<P>As to the circum&s;tance of &s;carcity of money, as far as it can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have foundation, it is as much an objection to any other tax as to the one in que&s;tion. The weight of the tax is not certainly &s;uch as to involve any pecu|liar difficulty. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive that nine cents per gallon on di&s;|tilled &s;pirits, which is &s;tating it at the highe&s;t, can from the magnitude of the tax, di&s;tre&s;s any part of the country, which has an ability to pay taxes at all, enjoying too the unexampled advantage of a total exemption from taxes on hou&s;es, lands or &s;tock.</P>
<P>The population of the United States being about 4,000,000 of per&s;ons, and the quantity of &s;pirits annually con&s;umed between ten and eleven millions of gallons, the yearly proportion to each family, if con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix per&s;ons, which is a full ratio, would be about &s;ixteen gallons, the duty upon which would be le&s;s than <HI>one dollar and a half.</HI> The citizen who is able to maintain a fa|mily, and who is the owner or occupier of a farm, cannot feel any inconveni|ence from &s;o light a contribution, and the indu&s;trious poor, whether arti&s;ans or labourers are u&s;ually allowed &s;pirits or an equivalent in addition to their wages.</P>
<P>The Secretary has no evidence to &s;atisfy his mind, that a real &s;carcity of mo|ney will be found, on experiment, a &s;erious impediment to the payment of the tax any where. In the quarter where this complaint has particularly prevailed, the expenditures for the defence of the frontier would &s;eem alone &s;ufficient to obviate it. To this it is an&s;wered, that the contractors for the &s;upply of the army operate with goods and not with money: But this &s;till tends to keep at home whatever money finds its way there. Nor is it a fact, if the information of the Secretary be not materially erroneous, that the purcha&s;es of the contractors of
<PB N="17" REF="024925_0016_0FCD8E5E199CCB10">
flour, meat, &amp;c. are <HI>wholly</HI> with goods. But if they were, the Secretary can aver, that more money has in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year been &s;ent into the we&s;tern country from the trea&s;ury, in &s;pecie, and bank bills which an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e, for the pay of the troops and militia, and for quarter-ma&s;ters &s;up|plies, than the whole amount of the tax in the four we&s;tern counties of Penn|&s;ylvania and the di&s;trict of Kentucky is likely to equal in four or five years. Si|milar remittances are likely to be made in future.</P>
<P>Hence the government it&s;elf furni&s;hes, and in all probability will continue to furni&s;h, the means of paying its own demands, with a &s;urplus which will &s;en&s;i|bly fo&s;ter the indu&s;try of the parties concerned, if they avail them&s;elves of it under the guidance of a &s;pirit of oeconomy and exertion.</P>
<P>Whether there be no part of the United States, in which the objection of want of money may truly exi&s;t, in a degree to render the payment of the duty &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the inhabitants, the Secretary is not able to pronounce. He can only expre&s;s his own doubt of the fact, and refer the matter to &s;uch information as the members of any di&s;trict &s;o &s;ituated, may have it in their power to offer to the legi&s;lative body.</P>
<P>Should the ca&s;e appear to exi&s;t, it would involve the nece&s;&s;ity of a mea&s;ure in the ab&s;tract very ineligible, that is the receipt of the duty in the article it&s;elf.</P>
<P>If an alternative of this &s;ort were to be allowed, it would be proper to make it the duty of the party paying, <HI>to deliver the article at the place in each county</HI> where the office of in&s;pection is kept, and to regulate the price according to &s;uch a &s;tandard, as would induce a preference of paying in ca&s;h except from a real impracticability of obtaining it.</P>
<P>In regard to the petition from the di&s;trict of Kentucky, after what has been &s;aid with reference to other applications, it can only be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that the exemption which is &s;ought by that petition, is rendered impracticable by an expre&s;s provi&s;ion of the con&s;titution, which declares, that all duties, impo&s;ts and exci&s;es &s;hall be uniform throughout the United States.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the foregoing examination of the objections which have been made to the law, &s;ome alterations have been &s;ubmitted for the purpo&s;e of removing a part of them. The Secretary will now proceed to &s;ubmit &s;uch farther alterations as appear to him advi&s;eable, ari&s;ing either from the &s;ugge&s;|tions of the officers of the revenue or from his own reflections.</P>
<P N="1">I. It appears expedient to alter the di&s;tinction re&s;pecting di&s;tilleries from dome&s;tic materials in cities, towns and villages, &s;o as to confine it to one or more &s;tills worked at the &s;ame di&s;tillery, the capacity or capacities of which together do not fall &s;hort of four hundred gallons.</P>
<P>The effectual execution of the pre&s;ent provi&s;ions re&s;pecting di&s;tilleries from home materials in cities, towns and villages, would occa&s;ion an inconvenient multiplication of officers, and would in too great a degree exhau&s;t the pro|duct of the duty in the expence of collection. It is al&s;o probable that the alteration &s;ugge&s;ted would al&s;o conduce to public &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P N="2">II. The pre&s;ent provi&s;ions concerning the entering of &s;tills are found by experience not to be adequate, and in &s;ome in&s;tances not convenient.</P>
<P>It appears advi&s;eable, that there &s;hall be one office of in&s;pection for each county, with authority to the &s;upervi&s;or to e&s;tabli&s;h more than one, if he &s;hall judge it nece&s;&s;ary for the accommodation of the inhabitants; and that every di&s;tiller or per&s;on having or keeping a &s;till, &s;hall be required to make entry of the &s;ame, at &s;ome office of in&s;pection for the county, within a certain determi|nate
<PB N="18" REF="024925_0017_0FCD8E5F2D2B5EA8">
period in each year. It will be proper al&s;o to enjoin upon every per&s;on, who re&s;iding within the county, &s;hall procure a &s;till, or who removing into a county, &s;hall bring into it a &s;till, within twenty days after &s;uch procuring or removal, and before he or &s;he begins to u&s;e the &s;till, to make entry at the office of in&s;pection. Every entry be&s;ides de&s;cribing the &s;till, &s;hould &s;pecify in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion it is, and the purpo&s;e for which it is intended, as whether for &s;ale or for u&s;e in di&s;tilling; and in the ca&s;e of a removal of the per&s;on from another place into the county, &s;hall &s;pecify the place from which the &s;till &s;hall have been brought. A forfeiture of the &s;till ought in every ca&s;e in which an entry is required, to attend an omi&s;&s;ion to enter.</P>
<P>This regulation by &s;implifying the bu&s;ine&s;s of entering &s;tills, would render it ea&s;ier to comprehend and comply with what is required, would furni&s;h the offi|cers with a better rule for a&s;certaining delinquencies, and, by avoiding to them a con&s;iderable degree of unnece&s;&s;ary trouble will facilitate the retaining of pro|per characters in the offices of collectors.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is repre&s;ented that difficulties have in &s;ome in&s;tances ari&s;en concern|ing the per&s;ons re&s;pon&s;ible for the duty. The apparent, not being always the real proprietor, an opportunity for collu&s;ion is afforded; and without collu&s;ion the uncertainty is &s;tated as a &s;ource of embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P>It al&s;o &s;ometimes happens, that certain itinerant per&s;ons without property, complying with the preliminary requi&s;itions of the law as to entry, &amp;c. erect and work &s;tills for a time, and before a half yearly period of payment arrives, remove and evade the duty.</P>
<P>It would tend to remedy the&s;e inconveniences, if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and proprie|tors of &s;tills were made jointly and &s;everally liable, and if the duty were made a <HI>&s;pecific lieu</HI> on the &s;till it&s;elf; if al&s;o the proprietor of the land, upon which any &s;till may be worked &s;hould be made an&s;werable for the duty, except where it is worked by a lawful and bona fide tenant of the land of an e&s;tate not le&s;s than for a term of one year, or unle&s;s &s;uch proprietor can make it appear, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the &s;till was during the whole time without his privity or connivance an intruder or tre&s;pa&s;&s;er on the land; and if in the la&s;t place any di&s;tiller about to remove from the divi&s;ion in which he is, &s;hould be required previous to &s;uch removal to pay the tax for the year, deducting any prior payments, or give bond with approved &s;urety, conditioned for the payment of the full &s;um for which he or &s;he &s;hould be legally accountable to the end of the year, to the collector of the divi&s;ion to which the removal &s;hall be, rendering proof thereof under the hand of the &s;aid collector, within &s;ix months after the expiration of the year.</P>
<P>As well with a view to the forfeiture of the &s;tills for non-entry, as to give ef|fect to a <HI>&s;pecific lieu</HI> of the duty (if either or both of the&s;e provi&s;ions &s;hould be deemed eligible) it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enjoin it upon the officers of the reve|nue to identify by proper marks the &s;everal &s;tills which &s;hall have been entered with them.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The exemptions granted to &s;tills of the capacity of fifty gallons and under, by the 36th &s;ection of the law, appear from experience to require revi|&s;ion. Tending to produce inequality, as well as to fru&s;trate the revenue, they have excited complaint. It appears at lea&s;t advi&s;eable, that the obligation to enter, as connected with that <HI>of paying duty,</HI> &s;hould extend to &s;tills of all dimen|&s;ions, and that it &s;hould be enforced in every ca&s;e by the &s;ame penalty.</P>
<P N="5">V. The 28th &s;ection of the act makes provi&s;ion for the &s;eizure of &s;pirits unaccompanied with marks and certificates in the ca&s;es in which they are re|quired; but as they are required only in certain ca&s;es, and there is no method of di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;pirits, in re&s;pect to which they are nece&s;&s;ary, from tho&s;e in re&s;pect to which they are not nece&s;&s;ary, the provi&s;ion becomes nugatory,
<PB N="19" REF="024925_0018_0FCD8E60AB816F98">
becau&s;e an attempt to enforce it would be oppre&s;&s;ive. Hence not only a great &s;ecurity for the due execution of the law is lo&s;t, but &s;eizures very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to unoffending individuals mu&s;t happen notwith&s;tanding great precaution to avoid them.</P>
<P>It would be, in the opinion of the Secretary of great importance to provide, that all &s;pirits what&s;oever, in ca&s;ks or ve&s;&s;els of the capacity of twenty gallons and upwards &s;hould be marked and certified, on pain of &s;eizure and forfeiture, making it the duty of the officers to furni&s;h the requi&s;ite certificates <HI>gratis</HI> to di&s;tillers and dealers in all ca&s;es, in which the law &s;hall have been com|plied with.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e ca&s;es in which an occa&s;ion at recurrence to the officers for certifi|cates might be inconvenient, blanks may be furni&s;hed to be accounted for. And it may be left to the parties them&s;elves in the like ca&s;es to mark their own ca&s;ks or ve&s;&s;els in &s;ome &s;imple manner to be defined in the law. The&s;e ca&s;es may be de&s;ignated generally. They will principally relate to dealers, who in the cour&s;e of their bu&s;ine&s;s draw off &s;pirits from larger to &s;maller ca&s;ks, and to di&s;tillers who pay according to the capacities of their &s;tills.</P>
<P>As a part of a regulation of this &s;ort it will be nece&s;&s;ary to require, that within a certain period, &s;ufficiently long to admit of time to know and comply with the provi&s;ion, entry &s;hall be made, by all dealers and di&s;tillers, of all &s;pi|rits in their re&s;pective po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which &s;hall not have been previou&s;ly marked and certified according to law, in order that they may be marked and certified as old &s;tock.</P>
<P>The regulations here propo&s;ed though productive of &s;ome trouble and in|convenience in the out&s;et, will be afterwards a &s;ecurity both to individuals and to the revenue.</P>
<P N="6">VI. At pre&s;ent &s;pirits may not be imported from abroad in ca&s;ks of le&s;s capa|city than fifty gallons. The &s;ize of the&s;e ca&s;ks is &s;maller than is de&s;ireable, &s;o far as the &s;ecurity of the revenue is concerned, and there has not occurred any good objection to confining the importation to larger ca&s;ks, that is to &s;ay, to ca&s;ks of not le&s;s than ninety gallons. Certainly as far as re&s;pects rum from the We&s;t-Indies it may be done without inconvenience, being conformable to the general cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s. The re&s;ult of examination is that the excep|tion as to this particular in favor of gin may be aboli&s;hed. Should any alter|ation on this &s;ubject take place it ought not to begin to operate till after the expiration of a year.</P>
<P N="7">VII. There is ground to &s;uppo&s;e, that the allowance of drawback without any limitation as to quantity has been abu&s;ed. It is &s;ubmitted that none be made on any le&s;s quantity than one hundred and fifty gallons.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. There is danger that facility may be given to illicit importations, by making u&s;e of ca&s;ks which have been once regularly marked, and the certificates which have been i&s;&s;ued with them to cover other &s;pirits than tho&s;e originally contained in &s;uch ca&s;ks. Appearances which countenance &s;u&s;picion on this point have been the &s;ubjects of repre&s;entation from &s;everal quarters.</P>
<P>The danger may be obviated by prohibiting the importation in &s;uch marked ca&s;ks on pain of forfeiture, both of the &s;pirits and of any &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el in which they may be brought. A prohibition of this &s;ort does not appear liable to any good objection.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The duty of &s;ixty cents per gallon of the capacity of a &s;till was founded upon a computation, that a &s;till of any given dimen&s;ions worked <HI>four</HI> months in the year, which is the u&s;ual period of country di&s;tillation, would yield a quantity of &s;pirits which at the rate of nine cents per gallon, would corre&s;pond with &s;ixty cents per gallon of the capacity of the &s;till. It will de&s;erve con&s;ideration,
<PB N="20" REF="024925_0019_0FCD8E635FDD4D88">
whether it will not be expedient to give an option to country di&s;tillers, at the annual entry of their &s;tills, to take out a licence for any portion of the year, which they may re&s;pectively think fit, and to pay at the rate of 12 &frac12; cents per gallon of the capacity, per month, during &s;uch period. This to &s;tand in lieu of the alternative of paying by the gallon di&s;tilled. It would obviate in this ca&s;e the nece&s;&s;ity of accounting upon oath, and would leave it in the power of each di&s;tiller to cover the preci&s;e time he meant to work his &s;till with a licence, and to pay for that time only. A &s;trict prohibition to di&s;til at any other time, than that for which the licence was given, would be of cour&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to ac|company the regulation as far as regarded any &s;uch licen&s;ed di&s;tiller.</P>
<P>The only remaining points which have occurred, as proper to be &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of the legi&s;lature, re&s;pects the officers of the revenue.</P>
<P>It is repre&s;ented, that in &s;ome in&s;tances, from the ill humour of individuals, the officers have experienced much embarra&s;&s;ment, in re&s;pect to the filling of &s;tills with water, to a&s;certain their capacity, which upon examination is found the mo&s;t &s;imple and practicable mode. The proprietors have in &s;ome in&s;tan|ces not only refu&s;ed to aid the officers, but have even put out of their way the means by which the filling might be conveniently accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>It would conduce to the ea&s;y execution of the law, and to the very impor|tant purpo&s;e of retaining and procuring re&s;pectable characters as collectors, if the proprietors and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of &s;tills were required to aid them in the exe|cution of this part of their duty, or to pay a certain &s;um as a compen&s;ation for the doing of it.</P>
<P>The limits a&s;&s;igned in the law re&s;pecting compen&s;ations are found in prac|tice e&s;&s;entially inadequate to the object.</P>
<P>This is &s;o far the ca&s;e, that it becomes the duty of the Secretary to &s;tate, that greater latitude in this particular is <HI>indi&s;pen&s;ible to the effectual execution of the law.</HI></P>
<P>In the mo&s;t productive DIVISIONS the commi&s;&s;ions of the collectors afford but a moderate compen&s;ation. In the greate&s;t part of THEM the compen&s;ation is glaringly di&s;proportioned to the &s;ervice, in many of them it falls materially &s;hort of the expence of the officer.</P>
<P>It is believed, that in no country whatever has the collection of a &s;imilar duty been effected within the limit a&s;&s;igned. Applying in the United States to a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> article only, and yielding con&s;equently a le&s;s total product than where many articles are comprehended, the expence of collection mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity be proportionally greater.</P>
<P>It appears to the Secretary that 7 &frac12; per cent. of the total product of the duties on di&s;tilled &s;pirits, foreign as well as dome&s;tic, and not le&s;s will &s;uffice to de|fray the compen&s;ations to officers and other expences incidental to the collection of the duty. This is to be under&s;tood as &s;upplemental to the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom-hou&s;e expences.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to urge to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, how e&s;&s;ential it mu&s;t be to the execution of the law in a manner effectual to the purpo&s;es of the government and &s;atisfactory to the community, to &s;ecure by competent, though moderate rewards, the <HI>diligent &s;ervices</HI> of re&s;pectable and tru&s;t-worthy characters.</P>
