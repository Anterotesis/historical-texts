<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>MR. and Mrs. <HI>Jennet</HI> had &s;ix children, three boys, and three girls; the elde&s;t boy's name was <HI>George,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Charles,</HI> and the third <HI>Thomas,</HI> and the girls names were <HI>Maria, Charlotte,</HI> and <HI>Harriot.</HI> In this little book I intend to give you &s;ome ac|count of each of them; as, I dare &s;ay, you will like to read about &s;o many little boys and girls, and know which of them were good, and which naughty.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Jennet</HI> were both extremely fond of their children, and took great pains
<PB N="14" REF="021148_0009_0FB2517EC82CCDD0">
to educate them properly, and make them behave as all little boys and girls &s;hould do; but, notwith&s;tanding all their care, Ma&s;ter <HI>Charles</HI> would very frequently give them a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s, upon ac|count of his bad behaviour, for he was not at all good-tempered, and u&s;ed continually to be getting into mi&s;chief, and quarrelling with his brothers and &s;i&s;ters. One day when his papa had given <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Tom</HI> an ap|ple, as a reward for their having read, and written, and &s;aid their ta&s;ks very well, he a&s;ked for one likewi&s;e; but his papa &s;aid, "No, <HI>Charles,</HI> I &s;hall not give you an ap|ple, I a&s;&s;ure you, you have not at all minded your book, nor your writing, if you had, I would have given you one as well as your brothers; but I will not treat naughty boys the &s;ame as if they were good; and if you do not behave bet|ter to-morrow than you have done to day, I &s;hall look you up in my &s;tudy, and not &s;uffer you to go to play all day." <HI>Charles</HI> knew,
<PB N="15" REF="021148_0010_0FB25180312757F0">
that if he &s;aid any thing &s;aucy, his papa would certainly puni&s;h him I &s;o he hold his tongue, though he looked exceedingly cro&s;s and out of humour; and when he went into the garden he began to quarrel with his brother. <HI>George,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>give</HI> me your ap|ple, for I have as much right to it as you. Indeed <HI>Charles,</HI> you have not, replied <HI>George,</HI> for my papa gave it to me, becau&s;e I was good, and if you had been &s;o, he would have given you one; but I will give you half, if you plea&s;e&mdash;you are very welcome to half, though I cannot &s;pare it all. You <HI>&s;hall</HI> &s;pare it though, &s;aid he, for I will have it all. If you &s;ay &s;o, <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;aid <HI>George,</HI> you &s;hall not have any: So will you have half, or go quite without? I will have <HI>all,</HI> replied he. Then you &s;hall not have any, &s;aid <HI>George,</HI> and &s;o good-bye to you, and away he ran, whil&s;t <HI>Charles,</HI> who ran after him, but could not overtake him, kept throwing &s;tones after him, one of which

hit his leg, and brui&s;ed it very much.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was running after <HI>George,</HI> his brother <HI>Tom</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by playing with his ap|ple, to&s;&s;ing it up and catching <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t again, like a ball. <HI>Tom,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Charles,</HI> give me that ap|ple! I will give you a bit of it, returned <HI>Tom,</HI> but I cannot &s;pare it all. But you &s;hall give it <HI>all,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Charles,</HI> for I <HI>will</HI> have it; and then he ran to him, and tried to get it out of his hand. <HI>Tom</HI> for a good
<PB N="17" REF="021148_0012_0FB251834B5C2C30">
while kept it, by turning it about, and &s;tooping and putting it in his pocket. At la&s;t, <HI>Charles</HI> being &s;tronger and older than his brother, threw him down upon the ground, and took it from him, tied his legs together, and then walked off eating the apple.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> was a good-natured little boy, and would not have minded parting with his apple, if his brother would have a&s;ked pret|tily for it; but he did not like to have it taken in &s;uch a manner, and to have his legs tied; &s;o he could not help crying, and called out, <HI>Charles!</HI> brother <HI>Charles!</HI> pray come, and untie my legs! But <HI>Charles,</HI> like a naughty boy, did not attend to him, but only laughed at what he had done, and ate up the ap|ple, without returning poor little <HI>Tom</HI> one mouthful, though it was his own.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were in this &s;ituation, <HI>George</HI> came by, and a&s;ked <HI>Tom</HI> what he was cry|ing for? I cannot help crying, &s;aid he, <HI>Charles</HI> has taken away my apple; but I
<PB N="18" REF="021148_0013_0FB2518B2F6A2B18">
would not mind that if he had not tied my legs together, &s;o that I cannot walk at all! O! don't cry, my dear, replied <HI>George,</HI> I will untie your legs; and here, you may have my apple, if you plea&s;e. No, thank you, brother, &s;aid <HI>Tom,</HI> indeed I will not take your's. I don't mind going without my apple, only I don't like to have it taken away as <HI>Charles</HI> took it. No body would like that indeed, &s;aid <HI>George;</HI> but you &s;hall have a bit of mine, &s;o he took out his knife, and after paring it, and taking out the core, gave little <HI>Tom</HI> half.</P>

<P>ALL the conver&s;ation which was re|lated in the la&s;t chapter between <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Tom,</HI> Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> had overheard, as he happened to be walking the other &s;ide of the hedge by which they were &s;tanding whil&s;t they were talking together, and it gave him great unea&s;ine&s;s to find, that his &s;on <HI>Charles</HI> had been &s;uch a very naughty boy, not only in neglecting his learning, but likewi&s;e &s;o much wor&s;e in his behaviour to his brothers; for it was very wicked, you know, to quarrel with them, throw &s;tones, take away little <HI>Tom'</HI>s apple, and tie his legs together; and therefore Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> thought it very nece&s;&s;ary to puni&s;h him for &s;uch be|haviour. He therefore called him, and a&s;ked how he came to be &s;o naughty? But <HI>Charles,</HI> in&s;tead of acknowledging his fault, and be|ing &s;orry for it, only &s;aid, he did it becau&s;e he <HI>wanted</HI> an apple, and &s;hould do &s;o an|other

Why then, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Jennet,</HI> I think it is very nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould be prevented from doing &s;o again: I &s;hall therefore tie your hands behind you, and your legs together, as you did <HI>Tom'</HI>s. <HI>Charles</HI> then began to cry, and beg his papa not to puni&s;h him; but Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> told him, that as he thought he de&s;erved puni&s;hment, he certainly &s;hould inflict

it, though he was very &s;orry to be obliged to do it. Accordingly he tied his hands be|hind

<P>MASTER <HI>George,</HI> the la&s;t time he had played at cricket, had &s;truck his ball into a ditch and lo&s;t it. As therefore he wanted another, he went to his papa to a&s;k leave to go to a &s;hop and buy one. And pray, Sir, &s;aid he, may my brother <HI>Tom</HI> go with me? Yes, my dear, replied Mr. <HI>Jennet,</HI> if you will take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of him, and not let him run into the road, and come back again as &s;oon as you have bought your ball. I will take care of him and come back directly, &s;aid <HI>George;</HI> &s;o away he went, and little <HI>Tho|mas</HI> along with him.</P>
<P>They had not gone far before they met a little girl, not quite three years old, crying and &s;obbing mo&s;t &s;adly.

Where is <HI>Will?</HI> a&s;ked <HI>George.</HI> He ran down that lane, and I don't know my way home. <HI>George</HI> then inquired where &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ived? To which &s;he replied, at mammy's hou&s;e. And where does your mammy live? She lives at <HI>Dai&s;y-Down,</HI> &s;aid the little girl.

Pray, &s;aid <HI>George,</HI> very civilly, is either of your names <HI>Will?</HI> Mine is, replied a boy of about fourteen years old! what do you want? And pray, &s;aid <HI>George,</HI> have you a little &s;i&s;ter? Yes, half a dozen, an&s;wered the boy, do you want any of them? And where, &s;aid <HI>George,</HI> is one about three years old? I left her in the road, &s;aid <HI>Will!</HI> Did you &s;o? &s;aid <HI>George,</HI> and who is to take care of her whil&s;t you are at play? are you not a&s;hamed to leave &s;uch a poor lit|tle creature by her&s;elf? &s;he is crying enough to make her, &s;ick: Pray go to her, and either take her home, or el&s;e let her be with you, and don't leave her in the road, perhaps &s;he may be run over. I cannot help it if &s;he is, replied <HI>Will!</HI> I &s;han't go to her 'till I have fin|i&s;hed my play; and if you are afraid &s;he &s;hould be lo&s;t, pray take care of her your&s;elf; <HI>George</HI> then told him how naughty it was not to take care of his &s;i&s;ter.

Ma&s;ter <HI>George</HI> for his concern for his &s;i&s;ter, went to play again with the other boys.</P>
<P><HI>George</HI> and <HI>Tom</HI> were very &s;orry to find he would not be prevailed with to help his &s;i&s;ter; and when they returned, they found her &s;creaming &s;till more than when they left her; for a great dog was come to her, and was licking her face and hands, not with a de&s;ign to hurt her, but the poor little girl thought he was going to bite her, and was terribly frightened indeed.</P>

<HI>George,</HI> who was an exceedingly good-natured boy, could not bear to &s;ee her in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, and he could not tell how to help her; for, to carry her home would take up a long time, and his papa, you know, told him to return directly, &s;o he did not know what to do about it. At la&s;t, after thinking a little while, he determined to take her back with him, and and de&s;ire his mamma to &s;end her home to her mammy.

Then I will carry you, &s;aid <HI>George,</HI> and very good-naturedly took her up in his arms, and walked home as fa&s;t as he could; for he had been out longer than he ought to have been, and knew that his papa would be wondering he did not return.</P>

<P>BEFORE Ma&s;ter <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Tom</HI> had got home they met Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> coming to &s;eek for them. <HI>George,</HI> &s;aid he, where have you been all this time?

Well, &s;aid he, I am very glad to hear you have been &s;o well employed. I was afraid you had met with &s;ome accident, or had for|got that you &s;aid you would return &s;oon;
<PB N="28" REF="021148_0023_0FB251CA75526BD0">
and that made me unea&s;y, for I &s;hould have been extremely &s;orry, either to have had you hurt, or that you &s;hould not have kept your word; for that would have been &s;till wor&s;e, in my opinion, than being hurt: but you are a good boy, and it gives me great plea&s;ure to &s;ee you &s;o. Come, bring your little child home, and we will give her &s;ome victuals and drink, and then you &s;hall conduct her to her mother, who, I am &s;ure, will be much obliged you for the care of her daughter.</P>
<P><HI>George</HI> was much plea&s;ed to find his fa|ther approved of what he had done, and with great good-humour, carried the little girl all the way in his arms. See, how kind he looks, wiping her eyes, whil&s;t his

<P>MRS. <HI>Jennet</HI> and her three daughters were in the parlour when Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> and the two young gentlemen returned.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> was &s;tanding at the win|dow, folding up a &s;hirt of her papa's, which &s;he was making, and had ju&s;t fini&s;hed &s;titch|ing on the &s;houlder &s;traps, and had left off work. Look, mamma, &s;aid &s;he, there is my papa, and my brothers; and <HI>George</HI> has got a child in his arms. Whom can he have found? I don't know, indeed, my dear, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jen|net,</HI> looking up as &s;he &s;poke. I will go and &s;ee, &s;aid <HI>Charlotte,</HI> and away &s;he ran, and in her hurry the lock of the door caught hold of her pocket hole, and tore her frock.</P>
<P><HI>Charlotte</HI> was a very good-humoured girl, but was rather too great a romp, and often would get her&s;elf into di&s;grace by means of her carele&s;&s;ne&s;s; for though her papa and mamma liked to &s;ee their children cheerful
<PB N="31" REF="021148_0026_0FB251F002101380">
and merry, yet they did not like to &s;ee their little girls quite like little boys, and clamber over gates, and chairs, and tear their clothes off their backs. It certainly is not pretty for little girls to be &s;o rude; but <HI>Charlotte</HI> was rather apt to forget her&s;elf, and not always behave quite &s;o well as her mamma wi&s;hed her.</P>
<P>I was beginning to tell you of her going to &s;ee whom <HI>George</HI> had in his arms when &s;he tore her frock, which &s;he never &s;topt to look at, when &s;he was fir&s;t entangled, but ran heedle&s;sly away, by which means the frock was torn quite to the bottom. However &s;he did not mind that, but called out to <HI>George,</HI> Who is that, <HI>George?</HI> What little girl is that? O! 'tis a nice little girl! &s;aid <HI>George,</HI> and carried her into the parlour. When he put her down, the poor little thing &s;ee|ing no body but &s;trangers, bur&s;t out a crying, and &s;aid, I want my mammy! I want my mammy! And who is your mammy? my dear, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jennet.</HI> She is my own dear
<PB N="32" REF="021148_0027_0FB251F236E71590">
mammy! replied the little girl. But what is your name? &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jennet.</HI> Little <HI>Nance,</HI> &s;aid &s;he.

Thank you, Ma'am, &s;aid the child, and made a pretty curte&s;y. There's a good girl, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jennet.</HI> See, my dear, how good &s;he is; &s;he does not forget to &s;ay thank you, Ma'am, for all &s;he is &s;uch a poor lit|tle girl, and &s;o very young. You, <HI>Charlotte,</HI> though &s;o much older, forget to &s;ay &s;o: Are you not a&s;hamed that this little child &s;hould behave &s;o much better than you do? and, &s;ee too how nicely &s;he holds up her head; I am &s;ure &s;he is a nice little girl.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jennet</HI> then went out of the room, and returned with a large piece of bread, and &s;ome plumbs, which &s;he gave to little <HI>Nance,</HI> who again remembered to &s;ay thank you, Ma'am, and made another curte&s;y.</P>

I like to &s;ee you good-natured, and willing to part with your play-things, to plea&s;e poor lit|tle girls who have none of their own. So <HI>Har|riot</HI> ran up &s;taris and fetched her own down:

it was dre&s;&s;ed in a blue jacket, and black cap, and red &s;hoes; it was a very nice doll, and <HI>Harriot</HI> was very kind to give it to little <HI>Nance,</HI> and &s;o all children &s;hould be, if they wi&s;h to have any body love them.</P>
<P>After the little girl had eaten up her bread and plumbs, &s;he began again to cry for her mammy. Don't cry, my dear, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jennet;</HI> you &s;hall go to her, if you will be good. So &s;he rang her bell, and de&s;ired the maid to carry her home to her mother. But Ma&s;ter <HI>George</HI> begged he might go with her, and &s;o did all the young ladies. Mrs. <HI>Jen|net,</HI> who never denied them any thing proper to be granted, gave them leave to go; but Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte,</HI> who&s;e frock was in &s;o &s;habby a con|dition, could not po&s;&s;ibly attend them. At fir&s;t &s;he began to cry, when her mamma told her &s;he might not go; but &s;he &s;oon wiped up her tears, as &s;he well knew, if &s;he was &s;een to cry upon &s;uch a trifling affair, it would much di&s;plea&s;e her mamma, and &s;he would certainly be puni&s;hed.

&s;ee the con&s;equence of not taking more care of your clothes. You cannot go out with your &s;i&s;ters. You know, <HI>Charlotte,</HI> you often &s;uffer for it: I wonder you don't take more care. You &s;hould have &s;topt when you found the lock had caught hold of your frock; but you are very carele&s;s indeed; &s;o now you mu&s;t take off your frock and mend it.

<P>Mrs. <HI>Brown</HI> thanked him a thou&s;and times for his care of her little girl, and &s;aid, &s;he did not doubt but that he would be a good man, as he was &s;o good and kind a boy.

<P><PB N="40" REF="021148_0035_0FB24E9DDD193418">
<HI>George</HI> and <HI>Tom</HI> were very &s;orry to &s;ee him in &s;uch a &s;tate, and went to their papa to beg him to relea&s;e him. But Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> &s;aid, No, my dear boys, I cannot con&s;ent to that: I am very &s;orry to confine him; I don't like to puni&s;h any of you; but if children will be naughty, they mu&s;t &s;uffer for it; it makes me very unea&s;y to think that he &s;hould de&s;erve it; but I &s;hould be as much to blame as he is, if I did not en|deavour to prevent his being &s;o naughty again. If he will behave as he &s;hould do, I will untie him when he goes to bed.</P>
<P>As Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> never broke his word, <HI>George</HI> and <HI>Tom</HI> knew it would be u&s;ele&s;s to urge it any farther. They therefore went back to &s;it with <HI>Charles,</HI> who, I am &s;ure, did not de|&s;erve their kindne&s;s in keeping him company, in&s;tead of playing out of doors, and diverting them&s;elves; as he only pouted, looked cro&s;s, and &s;aid, it was owing to them that he was puni&s;hed, becau&s;e they would not give him their apples.</P>

<P>When night came, and it was time for the young gentlemen and ladies to go to bed, Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> was in hopes that <HI>Charles</HI> would acknow|ledge his fault, and a&s;k to be forgiven; but
<PB N="42" REF="021148_0037_0FB24EA0879F7638">
<HI>Charles,</HI> although he had been in a &s;tate of puni&s;hment all day, was &s;till not good enough to do that: So Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> &s;aid to him, <HI>Charles,</HI> I &s;ee you are determined to be a naughty boy, and as that is the ca&s;e, I a&s;&s;ure you, <HI>I</HI> am <HI>de|termined</HI> to make you good; and if you will not be &s;o without, you mu&s;t be puni&s;hed 'till you are; and unle&s;s you will a&s;k my pardon this moment for being &s;o naughty, and giv|ing me &s;o much trouble and unea&s;ine&s;s, you &s;hall go to bed with your legs tied together, and your hands tied behind you; and &s;o you &s;hall continue all night.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> cried &s;adly when he heard his papa threaten him &s;o much, but &s;till continued naughty, and would not a&s;k forgivene&s;s; &s;o his papa had him put to bed, and then went up and tied his legs and arms again, and &s;o he lay all night, and very unea&s;y he found it. By the time morning came, he was quite tired of his confinement, and began to be &s;orry he had been &s;o naughty, and wi&s;hed mo&s;t heartily he had been good &s;ooner. He could not get up
<PB N="43" REF="021148_0038_0FB24EA1F4F86CC0">
becau&s;e his legs and arms were tied, but de|&s;ired one of his brothers to go and tell his papa that he was &s;orry he had behaved &s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jennet,</HI> very kindly, went up &s;tairs di|rectly (which was more than he de&s;erved, as he had been ob&s;tinate &s;o long, and therefore had no <HI>right</HI> to expect to be heard the moment he cho&s;e to a&s;k forgivene&s;s) to hear what he had to &s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>Charles,</HI> when he &s;aw his papa, bur&s;t out a crying, and &s;aid, he would be a good boy, if he would be &s;o kind as to untie him.

<P>He then untied his hands and feet, and &s;at by him all the time he was getting up, talking to him, trying to per&s;uade him to be good, and always kind and obliging to every body; at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring him, if he was naughty, he &s;hould certainly puni&s;h him the

next time, with much greater &s;everity than he had now done.</P>
<P>When he was dre&s;&s;ed he let him go down to breakfa&s;t, bidding him wipe his eyes, leave off crying, and be a good boy. And indeed his papa was much plea&s;ed to find <HI>Charles</HI> be|ginning to be good; for nothing gave Mr. Mrs. <HI>Jennet</HI> &s;o much joy, as to &s;ee their child|ren all good and happy together.</P>

<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Maria</HI> was working a mu&s;lin apron for her mamma, which &s;he did very neatly, and
<PB N="46" REF="021148_0041_0FB24EABE56FD8D8">
took great pains to keep it clean, as it looks very ugly to have work dirty. Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte,</HI> as was &s;aid before, was making a &s;hirt; and Mi&s;s <HI>Harriot</HI> was &s;titching a pocket for her &s;i&s;|ter <HI>Charlotte;</HI> and when that was fini&s;hed, &s;he was to begin one for her&s;elf.

<P><FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>CHARLOTTE. Pray, <HI>Harriot,</HI> while your mamma is out of the room, why do you keep your feet in the &s;tocks? Do you like to keep them &s;o clo&s;e confined?</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="021148_0043_0FB24EB9E812E940">
HARRIOT. No, I do not much <HI>like</HI> it; but my mamma, you know, <HI>bid</HI> me put them in when I fir&s;t went to work.</P>
<P>CHARLOTTE. Yes, I know &s;he bid you put them in; but now &s;he is gone out of the room &s;he won't &s;ee you. I always take mine out when &s;he goes away.</P>
<P>HARRIOT. I know you do, but I think that is very naughty. Don't you con&s;ider that mamma loves us dearly, and only tells us what is right for the &s;ake of making us good and happy: It can be of no advantage to her I am &s;ure, whether we turn out our toes or not. If we behave ever &s;o ungenteelly, people will not accu&s;e mamma on that account; but they will di&s;like us very much indeed: As well they may. Be&s;ides, I think it is quite wicked not to do what my mamma choo&s;es I &s;hould. She is very kind to us, and, I am &s;ure, we ought to mind her, and be good always.</P>
<P>CHARLOTTE. Yes, we <HI>ought</HI> to be good, to be &s;ure; but if we are good when &s;he &s;ees us, I think that is quite enough.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="021148_0044_0FB24EBD022F6708">
HARRIOT. O! fie, fie, <HI>Charlotte!</HI> I won|der you are not a&s;hamed of &s;aying &s;o! I would not do what my mamma don't like, upon any account: That I would not. Be&s;ides, you al|ways get into &s;ome trouble or other when you behave &s;o. You know, the other day, when &s;he bid you not touch her knife, that you cut your fingers mo&s;t &s;adly, playing with it when &s;he went out of the room; and when you clamber|ed over the rail into the orchard, after &s;he told you not, you know, how you tore your &s;tock|ing, and your leg too&punc; Don't you remember it?</P>
<P>CHARLOTTE. Yes, that I do, for my leg is not well yet; nor more is my hand that I cut, for it is very &s;ore.</P>
<P>HARRIOT. I am &s;orry you &s;hould be hurt; but indeed, <HI>Charlotte,</HI> you de&s;erve to meet with &s;uch accidents, when you will not mind, and do what mamma likes, becau&s;e &s;he don't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you.</P>

<HEAD>The Hi&s;tory of Mi&s;s POLLY INGRATE.</HEAD>
<P>MISS <HI>Polly Ingrate</HI> was a little girl, who&s;e papa and mamma were very fond of her, and u&s;ed to take great pains to in&s;truct her in every thing which was proper.</P>
<P>She was but &s;even years old, therefore it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould know what was right or wrong &s;o well as her parents; but though &s;he was &s;o young, &s;till &s;he was fooli&s;h enough to think &s;he knew as well as her friends; and whenever they told her not to do any thing, &s;he always &s;tood and argued, and &s;aid, But why may not I? What is the rea&s;on? Becau&s;e it is not proper, they would tell her. And then &s;he would argue again, But <HI>why</HI> is it not proper?</P>
<P>To hear a child argue &s;o, is certainly di&s;a|greeable, as it appears as if they wi&s;hed not to do as they are advi&s;ed.</P>
<P>At the upper end of Mr. <HI>Ingrate's</HI> garden
<PB N="54" REF="021148_0049_0FB24EC8FA7F3070">
there was a fi&s;h pond: And as children, when at play are apt to run too near the edge of the water, <HI>Polly</HI> was de&s;ired never to go beyond a row of trees, which grew in the middle of the garden. But <HI>why</HI> may not I? &s;aid &s;he. Be|cau&s;e I don't chu&s;e you &s;hould, &s;aid her mam|ma. But why not? &s;he a&s;ked again. Becau&s;e, replied her mamma, I am afraid you &s;hould go too near the water. No, I &s;hall not! &s;aid &s;he. I know I &s;hall not! I will take great care! I am &s;ure I will not go too clo&s;e! Say no more about it, &s;aid her mamma, for I do in&s;i&s;t upon it that you never go beyond the trees. Now a good child would have minded at once, without arguing about it; but after Mrs. <HI>Ingrate</HI> had &s;o repeatedly told her not to go beyond the trees, it certainly was <HI>extremely</HI> naughty to think of it: However, <HI>Polly</HI> was wicked enough to do it; and one day, when her mamma was out of the way of &s;eeing her, &s;he went beyond the trees to play at ball. She could play very well, and &s;ometimes caught above an hundred without once letting it fall;

and the day &s;he &s;o naughtily went to play, where &s;he &s;hould not, &s;he happened to play remarkably well, and had caught it an hundred and thirty &s;ix times, without once letting it tumble, &s;o that &s;he had been looking up a great while without &s;eeing where &s;he went: And running to catch it, the hundred and thirty &s;eventh time, her foot &s;lipt upon the edge of the pond, and in &s;he fell.</P>
<P>When &s;he found her&s;elf falling into the wa|ter, &s;he recollected all which her mamma had &s;aid to her, and wi&s;hed mo&s;t heartily that &s;he
<PB N="56" REF="021148_0051_0FB24ECF10DC5860">
had minded, and not been &s;o naughty, and &s;creamed out, I will be good! pray pull me out! &s;o loud, that a gardner, who was digging at &s;ome little di&s;tance heard her, and ran to help her. He ju&s;t got time enough to &s;ave her, for had he been one minute later, &s;he would have been &s;o low under the water he could not have &s;een where &s;he was, nor been able to have taken her out. She was &s;o frightened and hurt by the fall, that he &s;carcely knew whether &s;he was alive or dead when he fir&s;t took her in his arms: However he carried her in doors, and &s;he was put to bed, where &s;he was obliged to lay four days before &s;he could get up, having caught a mo&s;t violent cold by being in the water.</P>
<P>Her papa and mamma were extremely &s;orry for the accident, and &s;till more &s;orry to think that &s;he &s;hould have been &s;o very naughty as not to mind what they had &s;aid to her. They both talked to her a great deal, and tried to <HI>convince</HI> her of the folly and &s;in of not taking good advice; and &s;he appeared &s;o con&s;cious of her fault, that they were in great hopes &s;he

would never be guilty of the &s;ame again. But it was not a great while afterwards before &s;he forgot how much &s;he had &s;uffered through the want of obedience, and went into a little dirty yard, where &s;he had been bid not to go, as the hogs were kept there, and it was not at all a proper place for a young lady to play in. There was one of the &s;ows had a litter of twelve pigs. <HI>Polly</HI> &s;tooped down to &s;troke them; but the &s;ow, fearing &s;he was going to hurt them, bit her fingers &s;o bad, that one of

them was obliged very &s;oon to be taken off. She ran crying and &s;creaming in doors, but was afraid of &s;eeing her papa or mamma, as &s;he knew &s;he de&s;erved puni&s;hment for go|ing into the hog yard after &s;he had been po|&s;itively forbid.</P>
<P>Her papa and mamma again endeavoured to convince her of her fault, and told her, that had &s;he minded them, the &s;ow could not have bit her fingers, as &s;he never went out of her &s;ty and little yard. I did not intend to hurt the pigs, &s;aid <HI>Polly.</HI> Very likely not, replied her mamma; your fault was not in <HI>&s;troking</HI> the pigs, but in going where you had been bid <HI>not</HI> to go. That is what I am angry with you for? but I hope the puni&s;hment you have met with, from the &s;ow's biting you, will teach you not to do &s;o, or <HI>any thing</HI> you are told not, any more.</P>
<P>After having &s;uffered twice &s;o very &s;everely from her di&s;obedience, any body would have thought that &s;he would have grown good, and for the future minded every thing that was &s;aid to her. But &s;till that was not the ca&s;e: And
<PB N="59" REF="021148_0054_0FB24EDD2F772368">
&s;he continually kept doing tho&s;e things out of her parents &s;ight, which &s;he would not dared to have done had they been pre&s;ent. Among&s;t the re&s;t, one which &s;he was guilty of was eating fruit whenever &s;he went into the garden to play. Her mamma had many times charged her not to pick any, promi&s;ing her, &s;he &s;hould have given to her as much as was proper and good for her health. But notwith&s;tanding all her mamma could &s;ay to her, &s;he u&s;ed, when in the garden alone (and when every body was in the front part of the hou&s;e, &s;o that &s;he was not &s;een) to pick and eat it: The con&s;equence of which was, that &s;he grew extremely &s;ick, and had a terrible pain in her &s;tomach, &s;o that &s;he was obliged to take great quantities of very na&s;ty phy&s;ick to give her ea&s;e; but &s;till &s;he was not broke of her naughty tricks; and one day when &s;he was at play in her mamma's chamber (though &s;he had been told over and over again never to go to an open window) &s;he was look|ing out of it, and &s;liping a little farther than &s;he intended, fell out, and broke her back|bone.
<PB N="60" REF="021148_0055_0FB24EDEDDF75B30">
At fir&s;t, when they took her up they thought &s;he was dead; but &s;he &s;oon came to her &s;en&s;es again, and after laying a great many months in bed, and &s;uffering a prodig|ious deal of pain, was able to get up; and after &s;ome months were pa&s;t, could walk about: But &s;he never grew any taller, but continued mo&s;t &s;hockingly crooked indeed.</P>
<P>She is now a woman, and you cannot think how &s;adly &s;he looks.

<P>AFTER Ma&s;ters <HI>Jennet</HI> had fini&s;hed their &s;tudies above &s;tairs, and their three &s;i&s;ters below, they all went to play together in the garden; and <HI>Charles,</HI> who was then in good humour, took his kite, and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his brothers, flew it very well.

They were all much delighted to &s;ee it mount &s;o high in the air; and there is no &s;aying how long they might have pur&s;ued the amu&s;ement,
<PB N="63" REF="021148_0058_0FB24EE7EB8B6A48">
had not a trifling accident happened, which put a &s;top to their &s;port.</P>
<P>Little <HI>Tom,</HI> who was running as fa&s;t as he could, with his head to&s;&s;ed back, looking at the kite, and not &s;eeing where he went, ran with &s;uch force again&s;t a large tree as knocked him down backwards, and not only &s;tunned him with the fall, but happened to hit his head a violent blow upon a &s;harp &s;tone, cut &s;o large a ga&s;h upon the back of his head, as made it bleed very much indeed. All his brothers and &s;i&s;ters ran to him, and tried to lift him up; but finding he could not &s;tand, they began to think he was dead; and when they &s;aw the blood run, they were all <HI>&s;ure</HI> that was the ca&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>George</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> took him up between them, whil&s;t Mi&s;s <HI>Maria</HI> walked be&s;ide them, holding her handkerchief to the wound in his head to &s;top the blood, and <HI>Charlotte</HI> and <HI>Harriot</HI> made all the ha&s;te they could in doors, calling out, <HI>Tom</HI> is killed! <HI>Tom</HI> is

killed! Upon hearing this, Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Jennet,</HI> and two or three of the &s;ervants, all came out together to &s;ee what was the matter, and met poor little <HI>Thomas</HI> carried in the manner related, and his brothers and &s;i&s;ters crying as they brought him in.

<P>Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> took him in his arms, and &s;aid, do not cry, my dears, your brother will be better pre&s;ently, I hope; and having put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to his head to do it good, laid him on the bed, where he had not been long before he began to open his eyes, and &s;peak, and &s;oon afterwards fell a&s;leep, and when he awaked was much better, and able to go down &s;tairs to dinner. You cannot imagine how greatly rejoiced his brothers and &s;i&s;ters were to &s;ee him &s;o much recovered, for they had all concluded he was dead. When, therefore, they found him well enough to &s;it and eat a little dinner, they were &s;o delighted they &s;carcely knew how to expre&s;s their joy.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as dinner was over, <HI>Charles</HI> was in a hurry to go and look after his kite, as he had left it without regarding what became of it to help his brother <HI>Tom,</HI> when fir&s;t he fell down; and was &s;o taken up with the thoughts of him afterwards, that he never looked for it until after dinner, when he &s;aw <HI>Tom</HI> &s;o much better. He went into the garden in hopes of finding it there; but no kite was to be found, nor could he tell where to go and &s;eek for it, as it po&s;|&s;ibly might fly a great way after he left it before it fell to the ground. However, he re&s;olved to go the way the wind blew when he flew it, and enquire of all the neighbours, whether it had fallen into any of their gardens? So having a&s;ked his papa's leave, he &s;et off in the &s;earch of it. He &s;topt at &s;eve|ral of the neighbours gates, and a&s;ked very
<PB N="66" REF="021148_0061_0FB24EF249B949D0">
civilly to go into the garden and look for his kite, and they all very kindly permitted him to go; but no kite could he find. At la&s;t as he was walking on, intending to a&s;k one more lady to let him go into her garden, he &s;aw a great many boys &s;tanding together, and as he pa&s;&s;ed by, turned his head towards them, and perceived they were ju&s;t beginning to rai&s;e a fine large kite; which, upon looking more earne&s;tly at, he found

was his own. He directly ran up to them
<PB N="67" REF="021148_0062_0FB24EF3F4D4D378">
and called out, That is <HI>my</HI> kite! &s;o pray give it me directly! for I have been look|ing for it! <HI>Your</HI> kite? &s;aid the boy, who was running with the &s;tring in his hand, in order to make it fly, I wonder what made it <HI>your's!</HI> I am &s;ure it is my own, and I wonder what made it <HI>your's!</HI> replied <HI>Charles;</HI> for, I am &s;ure, it <HI>is</HI> mine!

That you &s;hall not &s;aid the boy, for I found it, and will keep it, and not give it to you, I a&s;&s;ure you.

O! you chu&s;e to fight, do you, ma&s;ter? replied the boy; if that's the ca&s;e, I will fight with you with all my heart, and immediately he &s;tript and began.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> (who, as has been &s;aid before, was not of a good temper) in a mo&s;t violent pa&s;|&s;ion attacked the boy, who being rather &s;tronger than him&s;elf, pre&s;ently conquered, and beat him mo&s;t terribly indeed; whil&s;t
<PB N="68" REF="021148_0063_0FB24EFAD44BC918">
the blood ran as plentifully from his no&s;e and face, as before it had done from his brother <HI>Tom's</HI> head. At la&s;t, with his eyes almom&s;t beat out, and extremely hurt, he begged the boy to leave off, &s;aying, he did not chu&s;e to fight any more; upon which the boy left him; and <HI>Charles</HI> &s;eeing the kite in a little boy's hand, who had been holding it during the battle, ran to it, and in a violent rage drove his hand through it, and tore it all to pieces. <HI>There!</HI> &s;aid he, if you will not let <HI>me</HI> have it, <HI>you</HI> &s;hall never have it again. Upon <HI>Charles'</HI>s offering this violence to the kite, all the boys who had only &s;tood and looked on before, immedi|ately began to re&s;ent it, and kicked, and cuffed, and beat him about until he could &s;carcely crawl home: Where he was glad to return, as fa&s;t as in his mi&s;erable condition he could; and had he &s;tayed much longer, it is very probable he might have been killed, for they not only thra&s;hed him, but
<PB N="69" REF="021148_0064_0FB24EFBFA61FBE0">
threw &s;tones at, and pelted him with mud and dirt all the way he went.</P>

<P>WHEN <HI>Charles</HI> came into the parlour, his papa and mamma, and all his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, were quite amazed to &s;ee him; both his eyes were &s;welled as big as eggs, and the blood from his no&s;e had run into his mouth, and all down his chin and throat, and over his wai&s;tcoat; and his coat and hair were all covered with mud; &s;o that he made a mo&s;t &s;hocking appearance indeed. What have you been about, <HI>Charles?</HI> &s;aid Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Jennet;</HI> where have you been to? and what is the matter with you? <HI>Charles</HI> an&s;wered, I have been fighting with a boy for my kite! I am &s;o provoked I don't know what to do with my&s;elf! I found my kite: &s;ome boys had it, and they would not give it me. I wi&s;h I could kill them!

<PB N="71" REF="021148_0066_0FB24F02126A2C20">
but pray tell me all about it. How did the boy get the kite? I don't know how he got it, &s;aid <HI>Charles:</HI> but I am quite po&s;itive it was mine, and I told him &s;o, and a&s;ked him to give it me directly, but he would not. I am afraid, replied Mr. <HI>Jennet,</HI> you did not behave right, and a&s;k for it in a civil pro|per manner: If you had, I think he would have returned it. Did you tell him how you lo&s;t it? No, not I (&s;aid <HI>Charles</HI>) I told him it was mine, and I would have it; and when he would not give it me I &s;truck him; that was all; and then he thra&s;hed me &s;o un|mercifully; but he never will have the kite again however! I am glad of that! I took care he &s;hould not have the plea&s;ure of fly|ing it any more, for I tore it all to pieces, and broke the &s;ticks, and then, like a par|cel of cowards, half a dozen boys fell upon me all at once, and threw &s;tones and mud at me. I &s;hall not, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Jennet,</HI> pretend to ju&s;tify the behaviour of the boys for throwing

&s;tones at you: but indeed, <HI>Charles,</HI> it is en|tirely your own fault, that you are now in this &s;ad, brui&s;ed, &s;habby condition; and had it not been for your own ha&s;ty di&s;po&s;ition, you might, in all probability have reigained your kite, and &s;aved your&s;elf tho&s;e blows you have received. How often have I told you never to put your&s;elf in a pa&s;&s;ion; but to enquire calmly and good humouredly into things, before you allow your&s;elf to be angry. Had you followed my advice, and done &s;o now, how much trou|ble and &s;hame might you have &s;aved your&s;elf: The boy, no doubt found the kite where it had fallen, therefore until he met the true owner of it, was at liberty to keep it. When you &s;aw him with it, you &s;hould civilly have enquired whether he did not find that kite, as you had lately lo&s;t it, and &s;hould be greatly obliged to him if he would return it. Had you, <HI>Charles,</HI> made u&s;e of &s;uch kind of expre&s;&s;ions, I doubt not but the boy would have returned it: Or, had he refu&s;ed to do &s;o, you might have &s;aid, If you think that I am mi&s;taken, and that it is not

to have it re&s;tored, even though the boy &s;hould be convinced it really was your's.

<P><HI>Charles</HI> li&s;tened to all his papa &s;aid, but it did not &s;eem to have any very good effect; for when Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> cea&s;ed &s;peaking, he muttered out, I am glad I have &s;poiled the kite however!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> again endeavoured to convince him of the folly of &s;uch behaviour. How can you, <HI>Charles,</HI> &s;aid he, chu&s;e to act &s;o much like

<PB N="77" REF="021148_0072_0FB24F17AFB8DBA0">
you do with it? Why, Sir, an&s;wered the boy, I will tell you. I and my playfellows were go|ing to fly it, when a boy came, and &s;qualled out, that it was <HI>his,</HI> and he <HI>would</HI> have it; now as I did not know by what right it was his, I &s;aid, he &s;hould <HI>not</HI> have it; but, &s;aid he, I will! &s;o I told him he &s;hould not! and upon my refu&s;ing to give it him, without telling me that he had lo&s;t one, or giving me any rea&s;on to think that it be|longed to him more than to my&s;elf, he gave me a knock in the face, &s;o then I gave him another, and we went to fighting, and I beat him; and af|ter I left off, like a &s;impleton as he was, he tore and broke the kite all to pieces; &s;o that if it really was his own, he can never have it again. It was a thou&s;and pities to &s;poil it, for it was a charming good one. But, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Jennet,</HI> how came you not to return it when he told you it was his?

out it; and indeed I did not believe it was his; for I thought if it had been, he would have given an account in what manner he lo&s;t it, and not only have &s;aid, I <HI>will</HI> have it: Indeed &s;aid Mr. <HI>Jennet,</HI> I cannot wonder at you, for when people will put them&s;elves in a pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of talk|ing rea&s;onably upon any &s;ubject, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of under&s;tanding what they mean. I do not therefore blame you for refu&s;ing to de|liver the kite 'till you was a&s;ked civilly for it; but I think you did wrong by fighting about it. I did not want to fight, Sir, &s;aid the boy; but I a&s;&s;ure you, he began fir&s;t, and was in &s;uch a rage, that I was obliged to beat him as I would a wild bea&s;t, to keep him from doing me &s;ome mi&s;chief.

much better, if you would be aways calm and good humoured, and patiently wait to hear what each had to &s;ay; but likewi&s;e when you are men and women, you will find that nothing will &s;ucceed as you wi&s;h, if you &s;uffer your|&s;elves to be agitated and di&s;compo&s;ed when any circum&s;tance happens different to what you like: And once more I will repeat, for you cannot too well remember, that <HI>no one,</HI> whether children, men or women, can ever be happy who are not good humoured.

<P>THE next morning Ma&s;ter <HI>Tom'</HI>s head was pretty well, but Ma&s;ter <HI>Charles'</HI>s face and eyes were very bad indeed, and frightfully ugly he did look; his eyes black, his no&s;e and mouth extremely &s;welled, and a great cut on one &s;ide of his chin, which the point of a nail had torn in one of his falls, while he was fighting; &s;o that had any little boys &s;een him, I think they would have taken care never to fight any more, had they ever been &s;o &s;illy before.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were at break fa&s;t, a man came to the door with a box upon his head, directed for Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Jennet.</HI> They ordered it to be brought in, and then told the children to try and untie the cord that was round it, which af|ter a good deal of difficulty, they did, but then it was locked, and having no key, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> looked &s;adly di&s;appointed, as they were in hopes to have found it open. What &s;hall we do now? &s;aid they. How &s;hall we get it open? for it is

locked, and we have no key? O! &s;aid Mr. <HI>Jen|net,</HI> here is a key, and your mamma has another, &s;o I hope we &s;hall &s;oon open it, and &s;ee its con|tents. <HI>Charles</HI> took the key and opened the box,

while they all &s;tood round to &s;ee what was in it; but how were they &s;urpri&s;ed to find three rods, a fool's cap, and four &s;ilver medals, each tied through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ole with a yellow ribband. On one of them was the following words, Whoever wears this, is a cro&s;s child: Upon another, Whoe|ver wears this, cannot be depended upon when
<PB N="83" REF="021148_0078_0FB24F22EBD42B48">
out of &s;ight: Upon a third, The wearer of this has told a lie: And on the fourth, This medal is a badge of &s;loth and idlene&s;s. All the Mi&s;s and Ma&s;ter <HI>Jennets</HI> were much di&s;appointed to find the box contain &s;uch di&s;agreeable objects, and all of them looked very grave, turned away, and walked to their &s;eats. I find, my dears, &s;aid their papa, the &s;ight of what the box contains is very di&s;agreeable to you; and no doubt, rods and &s;uch kind of things, mu&s;t be far from agree|able to any body: For my part, I di&s;like the &s;ight of them as much as any of you can, and &s;hall be very glad never to be obliged to open the box any more; but it is the duty of all parents to make their children good; and if they will not be per&s;uaded to mind without, they mu&s;t be puni&s;hed. You may depend upon it, there|fore, that the&s;e rods, this ridiculous fool's cap, and the&s;e medals will be taken out, and u&s;ed, if any of you render it nece&s;&s;ary, otherwi&s;e, the box &s;hall never again be unlocked. He then locked it up, and carried it out of the room; but &s;oon returned with another box of the &s;ame &s;ort,
<PB N="84" REF="021148_0079_0FB24F246B021220">
though much larger than the fir&s;t. Now, &s;aid he, try my dears, and open that. They were all &s;o di&s;appointed at the contents of the other, that they had no great inclination to open it; but upon their papa's giving them the key, and telling them to do it, they unlocked it, and lifting up the lid, di&s;covered it to be filled with books, bats, balls, kites, nine pins, marbles, work-bags, hou&s;e wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es, dolls, boxes, and a great variety of pretty things, which I do not now recollect. They &s;oon changed their counte|nances, and each one&punc; &s;miled at &s;o plea&s;ing a pro&s;pect. Well, how do you like the contents of this box, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Jennet?</HI> They all replied, they liked it very well. And which, &s;aid he, &s;hould you chu&s;e to receive &s;ome of; what is now before you, or what you &s;aw in the other box? They all again replied, that they &s;hould much prefer what they now &s;aw, and never de|&s;ired to have another &s;ight of the other as long as they lived. Neither do I, replied their papa; and I a&s;&s;ure you, it entirely depends upon your&s;elves, whether it is ever opened

<P>FOR the whole week following the arrival of the two boxes, all the Mi&s;s and Ma&s;ter <HI>Jennets</HI> behaved extremely well indeed; &s;o that their papa and mamma thought proper to reward them out of the <HI>good child's box,</HI> as it was called, the other being named the <HI>naughty child's box:</HI> and as they thought books would not only amu&s;e, but at the &s;ame time in&s;truct them, they gave each of them a book.

This par|ticular direction is given, in ca&s;e any good little children &s;hould wi&s;h to read them, and not know where to buy them; and, no doubt, their papas and mammas will will|ingly a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the purcha&s;e, if they will take pains with their reading, and mind the good advice which is given in tho&s;e pretty books.</P>
<P>All the Mi&s;s and Ma&s;ter <HI>Jennets</HI> were exceed|ingly well plea&s;ed with their different books, and after thanking their parents in an hand&s;ome manner, went to read them. As &s;oon as they
<PB N="88" REF="021148_0083_0FB24F2BED4E57C8">
had read through, and looked at all the pretty pictures in their own, they lent them to each other, and, by that means, had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing <HI>&s;ix</HI> entertaining books apiece; and in|deed it employed them &s;everal days, before they could read them through. After they had en|joyed this amu&s;ement for four days, and all had very good humoredly lent them to one another, whenever de&s;ired to do &s;o, <HI>Charles,</HI> who &s;eldom continued good long together, began to grow naughty again; and when his &s;i&s;ter <HI>Harriot</HI> de|&s;ired him to lend her his book, he very rudely, and cro&s;sly refu&s;ed, and &s;aid, <HI>No, indeed I won't&punc;</HI> Are you going to read it, brother <HI>Charles?</HI> &s;aid <HI>Harriot.</HI> If you are, I do not de&s;ire it: but if you are not making any u&s;e of it, I &s;hould be much obliged to you for it, for a little while, and you &s;hall have it the moment you want it. But al|though <HI>Harriot</HI> &s;poke &s;o very prettily, he only an&s;wered, "That &s;he &s;hould <HI>not</HI> have it! and though he was not reading it now, he could not tell how &s;oon he &s;hould! be&s;ides, whether he read it or not, he liked to keep it in his own
<PB N="89" REF="021148_0084_0FB24F2E5ECE6DC8">
pocket, and &s;he &s;hould not have it at all!" Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> did not interrupt him, till he had done &s;peaking, and then he &s;aid, <HI>Charles,</HI> you know I always keep my word, and never promi&s;e what I do not perform. I told you if you were good you &s;hould be rewarded with &s;omething out of the <HI>good child's box,</HI> and accordingly I gave you a pretty book, becau&s;e you had been good for &s;ome days. I likewi&s;e told you if you were naughty, you &s;hould be puni&s;hed, and I now mu&s;t keep my word. I am &s;orry to be obliged to unlock the <HI>naughty child's box;</HI> but your be|haviour makes me do it: he then took the key out of his pocket, and fetched in the medal which had the words upon it, <HI>Whoever wears this is a cro&s;s child!</HI> and tied it with the yellow ribbon round his neck. He cried &s;adly at having it put on; and to be &s;ure that is not to be wondered at, as it looked extremely ridiculous to &s;ee a yellow ribbon round a boy's neck: and a bow, and long ends hanging upon his coat down his back, and a medal bobbing about under his chin with &s;uch
<PB N="90" REF="021148_0085_0FB24F319817F800">
di&s;graceful words upon it: but, as he had been &s;o cro&s;s to his &s;i&s;ter, it was proper he &s;hould be puni&s;hed. All his brothers and &s;i&s;ters looked very grave when they &s;aw it put on: indeed, &s;ome of them could not help &s;hedding tears upon the occa&s;ion, as they were all very fond of each other, and did not like to &s;ee one another in affliction: they a&s;ked their papa to take it off, but, after again telling them how nece&s;&s;ary it is to puni&s;h children when they are naughty, and convincing them that he mu&s;t not break his word, and prai&s;ing them for their affection to their bro|ther, he in&s;i&s;ted upon its being worn all day.</P>
<P><HI>Charles</HI> was quite a&s;hamed of walking about, for every body who &s;aw him took hold of the medal, and read the in&s;cription upon it. Some people &s;aid, there's a <HI>cro&s;s boy!</HI> Do not go near him! Others &s;aid, that boy de&s;erves to be whip|ped! So that he found he was laughed at, and de&s;pi&s;ed by every one who &s;aw him, and mo&s;t heartily &s;orry he was that he had behaved &s;o.</P>

<P>In the afternoon, &s;ome gentlemen and ladies drank tea with Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Jennet,</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> felt &s;o exceedingly a&s;hamed when he came into the room, he did not know which way to look. As &s;oon as he made his appearance, not know|ing at fir&s;t what it was, they all enquired, why he cho&s;e to wear &s;o much frightful yellow rib|bon round his neck? But when they were clo&s;e enough to read the words upon the medal, they begged he would not come near any of them, as they all greatly di&s;liked <HI>cro&s;s</HI> people. <HI>Charles</HI> was
<PB N="92" REF="021148_0087_0FB24F344FC1FB38">
&s;o mortified at the di&s;grace, that he could not help crying all the time he was in the room; and very early de&s;ired leave to go to bed; and upon his promi&s;ing not to behave &s;o any more, and acknowledging he was &s;orry for his fault, his papa took off the medal, and permitted him to retire.</P>
<P>When <HI>Saturday</HI> came, and they all had been very good, excepting <HI>Charles</HI> one day, that he was naughty about lending his &s;i&s;ter his book, Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Jennet</HI> again opened the <HI>good child's box,</HI> and took out of it a bat and cricket-ball for <HI>George;</HI> a very pretty flowered work|bag for <HI>Maria;</HI> a doll for <HI>Charlotte;</HI> a battledoor and &s;huttlecock for <HI>Harriot;</HI> a kite for <HI>Thomas;</HI> and as <HI>Charles</HI> had been much better than u&s;ual, excepting that one day when he was puni&s;hed, they were &s;o kind as to give him an orange; telling him at the &s;ame time, that they were very &s;orry that he had by his behaviour forfeit|ed a more valualuable reward; but as he had been good &s;ome days, he &s;hould not go quite unrewarded from out of the <HI>good child's box;</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="021148_0088_0FB24F3686B5C9E8">
and they hoped by the next week he would gain &s;omething better. After having &s;een the &s;ad con&s;equences of being naughty, not only as it produced puni&s;hment, but likewi&s;e as it was the cau&s;e of going without &s;ome pretty play|thing at the end of the week, it never could have been thought that any of the Mi&s;s or Ma&s;ter <HI>Jennets</HI> would again be &s;illy, and occa|&s;ion the di&s;plea&s;ure of their parents; but, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, &s;ome of them &s;tood in need of repeated cha&s;ti&s;ements. Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> was apt to be very &s;illy, and one day, &s;he, <HI>Harriot,</HI> and little <HI>Tom,</HI> had been to take a walk in the field behind the hou&s;e with the maid; and Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte,</HI> in&s;tead of walking in the path, ran all over the field in the very dirtie&s;t parts &s;he could find out. The maid de&s;ired her not to do &s;o; but in&s;tead of minding, &s;he only tried to per&s;uade her brother and &s;i&s;ter to do &s;o too; but they, like very good children, &s;topt the mo|ment they were de&s;ired. Upon which <HI>Charlotte</HI> laughed at them, and called them <HI>tender chick|ens</HI> and <HI>fooli&s;h go&s;tins,</HI> to mind what the maid

&s;aid, and not only ridiculed their proper beha|viour, but likewi&s;e made faces at Mrs. <HI>Deborah</HI> (the maid) and flung dirt at her. When they
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
got home, Mrs. <HI>Jennet</HI> a&s;ked <HI>Deborah</HI> how &s;he happened to go out in &s;o very dirty a gown and cloak, as in general &s;he looked very tidy, and clean? I did not <HI>go out</HI> &s;o dirty indeed, Mad|am, &s;aid <HI>Deborah;</HI> but Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> did it. How did <HI>Charlotte</HI> do it? enquired Mrs. <HI>Jennet.</HI> She then told the whole affair, and how &s;adly Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> had behaved, and wanted to
<PB N="95" REF="021148_0090_0FB24F3D4C4FB3F0">
make her brother and &s;i&s;ter as bad as her&s;elf; but they were very good, and did not mind her. If that is the ca&s;e, replied Mrs. <HI>Jennet,</HI> I think &s;he behaves as if &s;he had not common &s;en&s;e: the <HI>fool's cap</HI> will therefore be the propere&s;t head dre&s;s &s;he can wear. <HI>Charlotte</HI> began to cry, and beg it might not be put on; but her mamma &s;aid, you know, <HI>Charlotte,</HI> if you will be naughty, you mu&s;t be puni&s;hed, and if you did not chu&s;e puni&s;hment, you would not be guilty of &s;uch things as de&s;erve it. Indeed, mamma, I do not chu&s;e it, &s;aid <HI>Charlotte,</HI> pray do not put it on! You cannot expect, replied Mrs. <HI>Jennet,</HI> that I &s;hould break my promi&s;e, if I did, I &s;hould be &s;till naughtier than you; and you know very well that I have told you, if you <HI>will</HI> be naughty, you &s;hall be puni&s;hed. She then unlocked the <HI>naughty child's box,</HI> and took the fool's cap, and placed it upon <HI>Char|lotte'</HI>s head. The cap was made &s;omething in the &s;hape of a &s;ugar loaf, and had two long ears, like a&s;&s;es, hanging from the &s;ides, and was painted red, blue, green, yellow, &s;carlet,
<PB N="96" REF="021148_0091_0FB24F3F74FCCDD8">
and black; with bits of all coloured ribbons &s;treaming from it, and in the middle of the front was the picture of a naughty child cry|ing; &s;o that, you may think, it looked ex|tremely ugly and ridiculous. Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> &s;creamed &s;o loud when it was put on, that her mamma threatened to tie up her mouth, and took out her handkerchief for that purpo&s;e; but <HI>Charlotte</HI> left off, &s;o &s;he put it in her pocket again. When dinner was ready, Mr. <HI>Jennet</HI> was quite &s;hocked to &s;ee his daughter with &s;o frightful a cap on her head; nor could her bro|thers

<PB N="97" REF="021148_0092_0FB24F4116F32EE0">
and &s;i&s;ters, or the &s;ervants, keep from looking at it, to &s;ee how &s;trange and ridiculous it looked. After dinner &s;he again begged it might be taken off. Her mamma told her it &s;hould, when &s;he had been to <HI>Deborah,</HI> and a&s;ked her pardon, and told her, &s;he was &s;orry &s;he had behaved &s;o badly, and promi&s;ed not to do &s;o any more. <HI>Charlotte</HI> did not like the thoughts of a&s;king pardon; but when &s;he found her mam|ma would not take it off, unle&s;s &s;he did, &s;he went out of the room, &s;aying &s;he would go and a&s;k <HI>Deborah's</HI> pardon. In&s;tead of which, &s;he only went up &s;tairs into her own room for a few minutes, and then returned, and a&s;ked her mam|ma to take the cap off. Have you, then, a&s;ked <HI>Deborah's</HI> pardon? &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Jennet.</HI> Yes, Madam, I have, &s;aid &s;he!

Mrs. <HI>Jennet</HI> then &s;aid, <HI>Charlotte,</HI> how dare you be &s;o
<PB N="98" REF="021148_0093_0FB24F4357A8F9F0">
very wicked, and naughty, as to tell &s;uch a fib. I thought you &s;aid you did not like puni&s;hment; but you mu&s;t now be puni&s;hed with very great &s;everity indeed. I am quite a&s;hamed of you, and do not know when I &s;hall ever depend upon you again; but though <HI>you</HI> tell lies, <HI>I</HI> &s;hall not, I a&s;&s;ure you&punc; but &s;hall puni&s;h you as I always &s;aid I &s;hould, if you &s;poke any thing which was not true. She then again opened the <HI>naughty child's box,</HI> and took out one of the three rods which was in it, and the medal that had the words, <HI>The wearer of this has told a lie.</HI> Then taking hold of <HI>Charlotte,</HI> tied the medal round her neck, and led her into another room by her&s;elf where &s;he whipped her as much as &s;he de&s;erv|ed, for being &s;o wicked a girl; and that, you know, was a great deal, &s;o that &s;he was mo&s;t terribly puni&s;hed indeed.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Jennet</HI> then returned into the parlour, and found all the children crying for their &s;i&s;ter. I do not at all wonder, my dears, &s;aid &s;he, to &s;ee you cry; I can &s;carcely keep from it my&s;elf. I love all my children, and am extremely &s;orry

that any of them &s;hould &s;uffer pain and unea&s;i|ne&s;s; you may, therefore, well be concerned now, that &s;he has undergone &s;o great a degree; and another cau&s;e &s;ufficient to cry for, is, the thought of her having been guilty of &s;o wicked a thing as deceit, and lying; but I hope &s;he will never be &s;o naughty again. Mrs. <HI>Jennet</HI> then fetched <HI>Charlotte</HI> into the room (for &s;he had left her by her&s;elf for a few minutes after &s;he had corrected her) and &s;he remained in the parlour all the re&s;t of the day, with the fool's cap upon her head, and the medal round her neck; nei|ther would her mamma &s;uffer her to &s;peak a word to any of her brothers, or &s;i&s;ters, for fear &s;he &s;hould teach them to be as naughty as her|&s;elf, &s;aying, if &s;he did not make the proper u&s;e of her tongue, which was &s;peaking the truth, &s;he &s;hould not u&s;e it at all; &s;o, you may be &s;ure, &s;he &s;pent a mo&s;t mi&s;erable, unhappy afternoon. At la&s;t bed time came, and her mamma was then &s;o kind as to let her go to bed, though, indeed, children who tell lies do not de&s;erve a bed to

of the crime &s;he had committed, after talking a great while to her, and convincing her of the bad con&s;equences of deceit and fal&s;ehood, tel|ling her that nobody would ever depend upon her, or believe what &s;he &s;aid, and al&s;o that it was extremely wicked, and would certainly make her very mi&s;erable; they at la&s;t ki&s;&s;ed her, and let her go down to breakfa&s;t; but &s;till they behaved very gravely to her, for it was impo&s;&s;ible to have as good an opinion of her, as if &s;he had not been &s;o naughty. She was, her&s;elf, very unea&s;y at the thoughts of her folly; and endeavoured, all in her power, to make amends by being very good, and doing every thing &s;he was bid, which, to be &s;ure, was the only way to regain the love of her friends. But, &s;till it was impo&s;&s;ible to <HI>untell</HI> the fal&s;ity &s;he had &s;poken; nor could &s;he be &s;o much de|pended upon afterwards, as if &s;he had not told it. When <HI>Saturday</HI> arrived, all the young folks waited with great patience, though they thought the time rather long, until the <HI>good child's box</HI> &s;hould be opened, and when it was unlocked,

Ma&s;ter <HI>George</HI> had another book, a <HI>Hi&s;tory of Birds and Bea&s;ts</HI> given him: Mi&s;s <HI>Maria</HI> a very hand|&s;ome fan: Ma&s;ter <HI>Charles</HI> a &s;et of nine-pins: Mi&s;s <HI>Harriot</HI> a &s;et of doll's tea things; and Ma&s;ter <HI>Thomas</HI> a bag of marbles; but Mi&s;s <HI>Char|lotte,</HI> who had, during the week, been &s;o ex|tremely naughty, had not any one thing given her, not even &s;o much as an orange or an apple. She was, you may be &s;ure, &s;adly mortified, to be obliged to go without, though &s;he could not but acknowledge &s;he did not de&s;erve any, and all the others were much delighted with their pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>The example of <HI>Charlotte'</HI>s puni&s;hment, had &s;o good an effect upon them, that all except|ing <HI>Charles,</HI> took care never to de&s;erve the &s;ame: neither was Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> ever guilty of telling another lie. Little <HI>Thomas,</HI> at one time, neg|lected his book for a few days; &s;o that he was obliged to wear the medal which was the <HI>badge of idlene&s;s and &s;loth,</HI> and, excepting that, Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Jennet</HI> never had occa&s;ion to unlock the <HI>naughty child's box</HI> for any of their children

but <HI>Charles;</HI> who, notwith&s;tanding all the pains that were taken with him, and all the encourage|ment he met with when good, would frequently be very naughty, and was &s;o bad as to oblige his papa to u&s;e, not only all the di&s;graceful medals and fools cap, but al&s;o the rods upon him. All his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, when they grew up, were very worthy men and women, comfortable to them&s;elves, and beloved and admired by every body who knew them. Whereas, <HI>Charles,</HI> from the badne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, and cro&s;s di&s;oblig|ing

temper, was de&s;pi&s;ed, and &s;hunned by all mankind; nobody liked to be in company with him, and even his brothers and &s;i&s;ters went but &s;eldom to &s;ee him; though they would have gone with all their hearts, if he would but have been kind and civil to them; but, in&s;tead of be|ing &s;o, he was &s;o quarrel &s;ome, that they never knew how to plea&s;e him, or not give offence. In &s;hort, he was a mo&s;t mi&s;erable, unhappy man, and pa&s;t all his time extremely uncomfortable, without being beloved by any one per&s;on in the world. He lived by him&s;elf, for no one cho&s;e to live with him; nor could he ever get &s;ervants to &s;tay with him above a month at a time; neither did any of his neighbours vi&s;it him, becau&s;e they did not chu&s;e to keep company with &s;o bad tempered a per&s;on. His &s;ad behaviour gave the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s to his parents, and they would certainly have died of grief, had they not been comforted by the very different con|duct of his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, who, by their kind and dutiful behaviour, gave them great &s;ati&s;faction and joy; and, by their con&s;tant at|tention

to every thing their father and mother liked, repayed that pains and care they had taken of their education. It is much to be wi&s;hed that all children, who read this hi&s;tory, will learn to imitate the good Mi&s;s and Ma&s;ter <HI>Jennets,</HI> and, if ever they have been naughty before, it is to be hoped, that like Mi&s;s <HI>Char|lotte,</HI> they will repent, and be &s;orry for their crimes, and take care never to be guilty of the &s;ame again, for fear le&s;t they &s;hould at la&s;t come to be as unhappy and mi&s;erable as Ma&s;ter <HI>Charles;</HI> which, they may depend upon it, they will be, if, like him, they neglect to mind what is &s;aid to them.</P>
<P>I hope therefore, the child who is now reading this pretty book, will remember and always take pains to be good.</P>
