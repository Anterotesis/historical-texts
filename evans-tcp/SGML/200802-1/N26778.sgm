<P>THE LIFE OF MRS. SARAH OSBORN.</P>

<HEAD>PART I. Containing an Account of the fir&s;t thirty years of her Life, written by her&s;elf; with a brief In|troduction.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. SARAH OSBORN, was born in London, on February 22, 1714. Her father was Mr. Benjamin Haggar. Her mother was Mrs. Su&s;anna Haggar, who&s;e maiden name was Guy&s;e. She was &s;i&s;ter to the Reverend Doctor John Guy&s;e of London. Mrs. O&s;born came to America, with her mother, in the year 1722, in the ninth year of her age, her father having been here for &s;ome time before. They lived in Bo&s;ton a &s;hort time, and then moved to Freetown, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Taunton river, near fifty miles &s;outh of Bo&s;ton, and above twenty miles from Newport. In the year 1729, they moved to Newport on Rhodei&s;land, where &s;he lived till her decea&s;e.</P>
<P>The following is a more particular account of the fir&s;t thirty years of her life, written by her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="035636_0004_100613DDDFEE1E38">HAVING been for &s;ome years &s;trongly in|clined to write &s;omething of what I can re|member of the dealings of God with my &s;oul from a child, I now, being about thirty years old, attempt to do it; hoping it may con&s;i&s;t with the glory of God, at which I tru&s;t, through grace, I &s;incerely aim: And the good of my own &s;oul, as a mean to &s;tir up gratitude in the mo&s;t ungrate|ful of all hearts, even mine, to a glorious and compa&s;&s;ionate Savior, for all his benefits towards &s;o vile a mon&s;ter in &s;in as I am: And for the encouragement of any who may providentially light on the&s;e lines after my decea&s;e, to tru&s;t in the Lord, and never de&s;pair of mercy, &s;ince one &s;o &s;tubborn and rebellious as I have been, has obtained it, through the &s;overeign riches of free grace. But Oh, let all tremble at the thought of abu&s;ing a Savior &s;o, le&s;t God &s;hould &s;ay, "Let them alone, they &s;hall never enter into my re&s;t."</P>
<P>Lord, humble me for my ba&s;e ingratitude; and help me, by affording me the influences and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of thy ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, that I may be im|partial in this work, declaring the truth, and nothing but the truth; and in all that, have a &s;ingle eye to thy glory. O, for Je&s;us' &s;ake, &s;uffer me not to do any thing that will tend to puff up &s;elf. O, remove all &s;piritual pride, and keep me low at the feet of Je&s;us. Fill me with adoring and admiring thoughts of thee, O God the Fa|ther, God the Son, and God the Holy Gho&s;t, who has &s;o wonderfully contrived and wrought out my redemption; and though thou ha&s;t, through infinite wi&s;dom, hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, yet ha&s;t revealed them unto babes; and even to me, the mo&s;t ignorant and
<PB N="7" REF="035636_0004_100613DDDFEE1E38">
vile of all creatures: Who&s;e deep rooted enmity again&s;t thee and thy laws broke out into action, as &s;oon as I was capable of any. The fir&s;t that I can remember of actual &s;ins, of which I was guilty, was <HI>telling a lie.</HI> And then that text of &s;cripture often rang in my ears, "All liars &s;hall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brim&s;tone."</P>
<P>I was frequently under the &s;trivings of the Spirit of God, pre&s;&s;ing me to for&s;ake &s;in, and re|pent and perform duties: But &s;ometimes found them very burden &s;ome to me; &s;uch as praying and &s;aying many good things, which I was fre|quently taught. Ble&s;&s;ed be God for &s;uch in&s;truc|tions. Sometimes I loved them, and was much affected with them: But my corruptions prevail|ed dreadfully, an angry temper &s;tiring in me; e&s;pecially when corrected by my mother. But I acknowledge, to the glory of God, that he pre|&s;erved &s;uch a tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience in me, that if at any time my mother convinced me that &s;he did it becau&s;e it was her duty, and for my &s;in again&s;t God, I could bear it patiently, and willingly, yea thankfully.</P>
<P>Thus I continued till I was about &s;even or eight years old; when, my father being in New England, my mother put me to a boarding &s;chool, about three miles from London, where every thing was delightful to me. I was con|&s;tantly taught things that were religious, and they all became &s;weet to me, &s;o that I verily thought I lived a heaven upon earth. O, how &s;weet were Sabbaths! And for &s;ecret praye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, I would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have omitted it for all the world; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> omitting it appeared &s;o mon&s;trous, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="8" REF="035636_0005_100613DF66EA8258">
dreadful thing, that I dare not lie down without it: In this I was doubtle&s;s governed by a legal &s;pirit. I was frequently much enlarged in that duty, and u&s;ed to weep much when confe&s;&s;ing my &s;ins, and pleading for the pardon of them, and for an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. The name of Chri&s;t was &s;weet to me, and &s;in appeared more hateful. I often u&s;ed to reprove others, when guilty of it. But once in particular, I remember, when I was at Hartford, where my grandmother lived, and my brother with her, a little time before we came to New England, my brother did &s;omething which I thought was wicked, and I reproved him &s;harply for it; but was much perplexed, after I had done it, with the&s;e words of &s;cripture, "Thou hypocrite, fir&s;t ca&s;t out the beam out of thine own eye; and then &s;halt thou &s;ee clearly to ca&s;t out the mote out of thy brother's eye." This frighted me exceedingly. I thought I was a vile hypocrite, and &s;hould never dare to reprove any body again. And, I &s;uppo&s;e, a hypocrite I was. But at la&s;t I told my grandmother of it, who encouraged me to go on, telling me i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was my duty &s;o to do; and if I was faithful, God would ble&s;s me, and love me.</P>
<P>So I continued for a while, as I thought, to delight in the ways of holine&s;s. But alas! alas! how &s;oon was it over! My goodne&s;s was like the morning cloud and the early dew, which &s;oon pa&s;&s;eth away; for when I was in my ninth year my father &s;ent for my mother and me to come to New England to him. And on board the &s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t my good impre&s;&s;ions, and grew vile, &s;o that I could then play upon the Sabbath. But was convinced of that &s;in by an accident which
<PB N="9" REF="035636_0005_100613DF66EA8258">
befel me; or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> was ordered by infinite wi&s;dom for that end. Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as I was bu&s;y in boil|ing &s;omething for my amu&s;ement, I fell into the fire with my right hand, and burnt it all over; which I pre&s;ently thought came ju&s;tly upon me for playing on the Sabbath day: And I was a&s;hamed and &s;orry I had done &s;o.</P>
<P>But after this I do not remember any partic|ular conviction for &s;ome years; but was change|able and incon&s;tant, &s;ometimes quite carele&s;s, and then more diligent in the performance of prayer. I had always, as I thought, a great love for tho&s;e who I believed were good people, e&s;|pecially mini&s;ters. My very heart would leap with joy, when I could &s;ee, or come near enough to touch them. I mention this as a childi&s;h no|tion, that I took &s;uch plea&s;ure in touching them. I u&s;ed to go &s;ecretly behind them for that pur|po&s;e. I thought I could do any thing in my power to &s;erve them.</P>
<P>About two years and an half after we came to Bo&s;ton, my parents moved to Freetown, and I with them. And when I was about thirteen years old, my mother went from thence to New|port on Rhodei&s;land, and went to vi&s;it Mr. Clap, who gave her a little book of &s;piritual &s;ongs for me, and de&s;ired her to give it to me, and tell me that it came from one who was a hearty well wi&s;her to my &s;oul. The&s;e words immediately &s;eized me, and filled me with &s;hame to think that one whom I never knew &s;hould take &s;uch care of my precious &s;oul, while I was &s;o carele&s;s my&s;elf. And from that minute I thought I had a grateful love for Mr. Clap <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="10" REF="035636_0006_100613E1CE89B1E8">
longed to &s;it under his mini&s;try. I was then for &s;ome time under &s;trong convictions. Had &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of the hardne&s;s of my heart, that I often thought it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to be &s;uf|ficiently awakened by any ordinary means; and prayed that God would do any thing with me, though ever &s;o terrible, &s;o that I might be driv|en from my evil cour&s;es, and turned to God. Some change I thought mu&s;t be wrought in me, or I &s;hould never get to heaven; but after what manner, I knew not. However, I re&s;olved to per&s;i&s;t in the way of duty, as I called it, and to for&s;ake my &s;ins, and lead a new life. But, fool that I was, I made re&s;olutions in my own &s;trength, and built upon my own works; and &s;o &s;oon fell again. O, amazing grace, that God &s;hould &s;pare &s;uch a wretch as me, &s;uch an a|bu&s;er of mercy!</P>
<P>After this I found my&s;elf dead, and to have no heart, as I thought, to pray, nor any &s;weet|ne&s;s in it, when I did. Then, O how I longed for the return of the &s;pirit of God, imagining he was withdrawn from me. Sometimes I did ago|nize in prayer, and plead with God that he would return to me by his Spirit once more. But was often an&s;wered by the&s;e words, "My Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man." Then I would beg, and promi&s;e that if God would try me <HI>this once,</HI> I would never grieve or re&s;i&s;t his Spirit a|gain. O, wretch that I was! thus to lie to the glorious God, who was then &s;triving with me, to bring me to his Son; for I did, <HI>I did</HI> quench his motions, and &s;oon forgot my promi&s;es. O, deceitful and dreadfully wicked heart! who can

know it? Lord, I am amazed at thy patience that I am out of hell.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, contrary to my parents' commands, I got into a canoe to paddle about in the river,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Their hou&s;e &s;tood by Taunton river, which was navigable.</NOTE> and could not get on &s;hore again. It being in the night, though the moon &s;hined bright, I expected no other but to be drowned. Once I thought to get out, and pull the canoe to the &s;hore; but tried fir&s;t if I could reach the bottom with my paddle: And finding I could not, dur&s;t not venture. Then I could &s;ee no probability of e&s;caping death. So I kneeled down and prayed, and all my former convictions revived: And the &s;in of di&s;obedience to my pa|rents e&s;pecially appeared odious. I thought it was ju&s;t that God &s;hould bring me into this di&s;tre&s;s for this &s;in; and with great vehemence and &s;elf abhorrence confe&s;&s;ed my &s;ins, with their aggra|vations before God, pleading for an intere&s;t in the blood of Chri&s;t, and for pardon for his &s;ake, for that, and all my other &s;ins. And while I was praying, I felt a &s;ecret joy, verily believing that I was forgiven, and that Chri&s;t had loved me with an everla&s;ting love, and that I &s;hould be happy with him, and longed for the time. I was im|mediately re&s;igned, as I thought, to the will of God, quite willing to die, and willing to live; begging that God would di&s;po&s;e of me as mo&s;t con&s;i&s;ted with his glory. And after I had thus re|&s;igned my&s;elf, as I thought, &s;oul and body into the hands of God, to do with me as &s;eemed good to him, I was as calm and &s;erene in the temper of my mind, as ever in my life.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035636_0007_100613E355E09600">But at length I bethought my&s;elf, that &s;elf pre&s;ervation was a great duty, and therefore I ought to try to get on &s;hore. So I hollowed as loud as I could to the neighbors, who with much difficulty were made to hear, and came to me, &s;ome hours after. There was not another canoe within two or three miles; for I had been driven by the tide &s;ome miles, fir&s;t up and then down the river.</P>
<P>How it would have been with my &s;oul, if God had taken me out of the world at that time, he only knows. Some chri&s;tians have thought, a &s;aving change was then wrought, and that I &s;hould have been happy.</P>
<P>After this, I was more diligent in pur&s;uing, as I thought, the ways of holine&s;s in the way God had appointed; and more watchful again&s;t &s;in. My life was plea&s;ant and &s;weet. I had great en|largements in duties. But at length grew cold again. O ungrateful &s;oul! to forget &s;uch a re|markable deliverance from death.</P>
<P>The next winter I was as wonderfully pre|&s;erved. The weather being exceeding cold, the river was frozen, &s;o that people, hor&s;es and teams went over on the ice. But while it was hard and &s;lippery, I dur&s;t not venture on it, for fear of falling. But after a great thaw, &s;o that the ice looked quite black, I, contrary to my parents' orders again, they being from home, went quite over to the other &s;ide, which was a mile. But the tide was ri&s;ing, &s;o I could not get on &s;hore: And when I looked round me, I could &s;ee nothing but great holes, as large as hou&s;|es, or larger, &s;ome of them. There was no way for me, but to go &s;traight back again;
<PB N="13" REF="035636_0007_100613E355E09600">
which I did. But the water was almo&s;t over &s;hoes all the way; and the ice, it &s;eemed to me, bent every &s;tep I took. And when I got back, the water was &s;o ri&s;en, that I was much be&s;et to get on &s;hore: And it was in the du&s;k of the evening. But at la&s;t, with much diffi|culty, I found a &s;trip of ice, as narrow as a bridge, which reached the &s;hore, by which I got to land. But when I had got off, and &s;aw the imminent danger to which I had expo&s;ed my&s;elf, by my folly and pre&s;umption, it made me tremble exceedingly. I pre&s;ently thought again, how ju&s;t God would have been, if I had been drowned for my di&s;obedience to my pa|rents; and wondered at his patience in &s;paring me: But do not remember, that I felt any a|biding impre&s;&s;ions; &s;o great was my woful &s;tu|pidity: Though I think I kept on praying, &amp;c. As to the river, the wind ro&s;e pre&s;ently, and blew very hard from the &s;outh, &s;o that it, with the tide, broke it up, that before bed time there was not a piece of ice of any bigne&s;s within &s;ight of our hou&s;e, which &s;tood clo&s;e by the river. I am amazed, when I con&s;ider how wonderful|ly God pre&s;erved me, a poor finful worm, &s;o unworthy of the lea&s;t mercy.</P>
<P>The next March, we removed to Dighton,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A town on the other &s;ide of Taunton river&punc;</NOTE> where we lived one year. I remember but one awakening in that time; and that was by hearing of the death of one of my former a&s;&s;o|ciates in Freetown, a young girl, about my age.</P>
<P>Then I was again a&s;toni&s;hed at the patience of God, in &s;paring me alive and out of hell.
<PB N="14" REF="035636_0008_100613E4E01B8B20">
Then I renewed my re&s;olutions to lead a new life. But in&s;tead of that, in the &s;pring we moved to Rhodei&s;land, where I &s;oon got into company, and was full of vanity. But my con|&s;cience would not let me be ea&s;y.</P>
<P>After &s;ome &s;ore trials and temptations, I was more comfortable, and had a great de&s;ire, I thought, to for&s;ake <HI>all &s;in,</HI> and to comply with every commanded duty. I longed to join to the church; but thought I was unworthy. I thought I thir&s;ted for communion with God in the ordinance of the Lord's Supper, and u&s;ed to think, if I came to <HI>that,</HI> it would certainly be a re&s;traint upon me, &s;o that I &s;hould not dare to &s;in as others did. And when I &s;tayed to &s;ee the ordinance admini&s;tered, I u&s;ed to think I could give all this world, I were fit to attend it. My &s;pirit would even &s;ink within me for the longings I had. Some times I &s;hould weep &s;o that I could not conceal it. One Sabbath, I went to hear Mr. Clap preach at his own hou&s;e, where I inclined to go con&s;tantly; but my pa|rents went to the other meeting, and were not plea&s;ed I &s;hould go from them: So I went but &s;eldom. But at this time there was a girl of a|bout fourteen years old bapti&s;ed, which &s;o af|fected me that I could hardly refrain from cry|ing out in the meeting, when I thought how I had broken the covenant engagements, which my parents had made with God, in my behalf, in my infancy, and &s;o long abu&s;ed &s;o great a privilege, as being a child of the covenant: And &s;he, who had not had &s;o much done for her, &s;hould now come to de&s;ire it her&s;elf! I
<PB N="15" REF="035636_0008_100613E4E01B8B20">
&s;aw, as I thought, &s;uch a beauty in her, that I loved her entirely, and wi&s;hed to be as good as I thought &s;he was. I made new re&s;olutions to live an&s;werable to the mercies I had received: But being made in my own &s;trength I &s;oon fell again. I thought I tru&s;ted in God; and u&s;ed frequently, in times of trial, to go and pour out my complaints to him, thinking he was my only &s;upport. But I dare not now be po&s;itive, or really conclude, that I knew what it was to put my tru&s;t in God; for my conduct after this &s;eems &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with grace, that I dare not &s;ay I had one &s;park of it then; but rather think I was only under a common work of the Spirit: Though &s;ome times I think I had true grace, though very weak. God only know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> how it was. O that he would enable me now to give diligence to make my calling and election &s;ure, that I may not be deceived in a matter of &s;o great importance. But to go on. After this (O that with deep humility of &s;oul, with &s;orrow and &s;hame, I could &s;peak of it) I relap&s;ed again, and was full of vanity. I kept company with a young man, &s;omething again&s;t my parents will. But that was owing to fal&s;e reports rai&s;ed of him; for at fir&s;t they liked him. I made re&s;olutions, that, after I was married, I would lead a new life, flattering my&s;elf that then I &s;hould not have the hinderances which I now had. I u&s;ed bitterly to reflect upon my&s;elf, when I had given my&s;elf liberty to be merry; for though I ap|peared outwardly &s;o, I had no real plea&s;ure: But &s;till put off repentance, or an entire breaking off from vanity, till a more convenient &s;ea&s;on; and
<PB N="16" REF="035636_0009_100613E66C43F860">
&s;o re&s;i&s;ted the Spirit of God. O Lord, how ju&s;t had&s;t thou been, if thou had&s;t left me entirely to my&s;elf! And if thou had&s;t, nothing would have been too bad for &s;uch a vile wretch as I to have committed. But ble&s;&s;ed be God, who withheld me from &s;uch &s;ins as would have brought me to open ju&s;tice, and expo&s;ed my|&s;elf and family to &s;hame and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>In proce&s;s of time, I was married to Mr. Sam|uel Wheaten, being in my eighteenth year, Oc|tober 21, 1731, and went with my hu&s;band, the next winter, to &s;ee his friends in the country; where I &s;tayed almo&s;t five months; and was almo&s;t all the time under &s;trong convictions. Oh, how I did &s;weat and tremble for fear my convictions &s;hould wear off again, and plead with God to &s;et home &s;trong convictions, and never, <HI>never</HI> &s;uffer them to cea&s;e, till they end|ed in a &s;ound and &s;aving conver&s;ion; till I knew and was &s;ure that I had a &s;aving intere&s;t in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and was freely forgiven for his &s;ake! And this was the &s;ub&s;tance of my frequent prayers ever after, when I could pray at all with earne&s;tne&s;s; that I might never re&s;t more, till I was &s;ure my peace was made with God.</P>
<P>From this time I had a hope again, at times, that Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t was mine. But it was &s;ome years af|ter before it plea&s;ed God to an&s;wer it fully, by giving me an a&s;&s;urance of it. But then I longed again for the ordinance of the Lord's &s;upper, though &s;ome times &s;hocked by that awful text, "He who eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to him&s;elf." But
<PB N="17" REF="035636_0009_100613E66C43F860">

<P>After I came home, I met with much afflic|tion in many re&s;pects. It &s;eemed to me that the whole world were in arms again&s;t me. I thought I was the mo&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed creature living upon earth. I u&s;ed to pray to God in &s;ecret to relieve me; but did not, as I ought, &s;ee his hand in permitting it &s;o to be, as a ju&s;t pun|i&s;hment for my vile &s;ins: And therefore was not humbled under it as I ought; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et na|ture ri&s;e, and acted very imprudently, in many re&s;pects. I was then with child, and often la|mented that I was like to bring a child into &s;uch a world of &s;orrow: But &s;ome times found a di&s;po&s;ition to dedicate my babe to God, while in

the womb; and did &s;o, at all &s;ea&s;ons of &s;ecret prayer. And, after it was born, my hu&s;band being at &s;ea, I could not re&s;t till I had &s;olemn|ly given it up to God in bapti&s;m. And I thought that I did indeed give up both my&s;elf and it to God.</P>
<P>I met with many trials in my lying in, it be|ing an extreme cold &s;ea&s;on. My child was born on Oct. 27, 1732. The next &s;pring, my hu&s;band returned home; but went to &s;ea again, and died abroad in November, 1733. I was then in my twentieth year. The news of my hu&s;band's death came to me on the fir&s;t of the next April. And I was prepared the evening before to receive it, by being uncommonly ex|erci&s;ed in my mind about &s;piritual things: And that text in Hebrews was continually in my thoughts, "How &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation?" This put me upon plead|ing with God, that I might not be found among the neglecters of it. I went to bed in a hou&s;e all alone, my child being at my father's. And about eleven or twelve o'clock at night was a|waked to hear the heavy tidings. But God ap|peared wonderfully for my &s;upport. I &s;aw his hand, and was enabled to &s;ubmit with patience to his will. I daily looked round me, to &s;ee how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch heavier the hand of God was laid on &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, than it was on me, where they were left with a large number of children, and much involved in debt. And I had but one to main|tain; and, though poor, yet not involved. Oth|ers, I &s;aw, as well as my&s;elf, had their friends &s;natched from them by &s;udden accidents. The
<PB N="19" REF="035636_0010_100613E92902B7E0">
con&s;ideration of the&s;e things, together with this thoughts of what I de&s;erved, &s;tilled me &s;o, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> though the lo&s;s of my companion, whom I dear|ly loved, was great; yet the veins of mercy, which I &s;aw running through all my a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ictions, were &s;o great likewi&s;e, that, with Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I could &s;ay, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath tak|en away, and ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord." I had then the promi&s;es of the widow's God to plead, and &s;eemed to ca&s;t my&s;elf more immedi|ately upon his care, verily believing, as I thought, he would provide for me, with my fatherle&s;s babe; for whom I often pleaded for covenant ble&s;&s;ings, &s;ince he had been ca&s;t upon God from the womb.</P>
<P>O, how much comfort do tho&s;e parents lo&s;e, who never gave their children up to God in bapti&s;m in their infancy! And how &s;ad for chil|dren them&s;elves to be deprived of the privilege of pleading with God for covenant ble&s;&s;ings! My being dedicated to God in my infancy al|ways put an argument into my mouth, to beg of God that I might not cut my&s;elf off, &s;ince I was a child of the covenant, and from a child given to him in bapti&s;m. But, to return:</P>
<P>As before this affliction every one &s;eemed to be enemies to me, &s;o from that time, all became friends. My parents treated me very ten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and God inclined every one who &s;aw m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> kind to me.

how I &s;hould do. I could &s;ee no way in which I could get a living. All doors &s;eemed to be &s;hut. But I verily believed that God would point out a way for me. And accord|ingly, the very day I came to a re&s;olution to move as &s;oon as I could, a &s;tranger to my ca&s;e, who kept a &s;chool a little way off, came to me, and told me that &s;he only waited for a fair wind to go to Carolina; and, if it would &s;uit me, I &s;hould have her chamber and &s;chollars; which I joyfully accepted. Thus the widow's God remarkably provided for me. This was on Nov. 19, 1734. I was then placed in a family, who di&s;covered a great deal of affection for me; and in all re&s;pects u&s;ed me as tenderly as if I had been a near relation.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed God the next May to lay his af|flicting hand on me, by a &s;harp humour, which broke out in my hands, &s;o that, for three months, every finger I had was wrapped up in pla&s;ters; and I could help my&s;elf but very lit|tle, and was under the doctor's hands. In the fall I was taken with violent fits, and was quite deprived of &s;en&s;e by them five days. I was bli&s;tered almo&s;t all over by the doctor; and my hands and arms were all raw, from my fin|gers' ends, up above my elbows, attended with a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fever. But all my friends were exceed|ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd to me, and tho&s;e in the hou&s;e took care of me, and of my children too; &s;o that my &s;chool was not broken up, till I was able to take care of it my&s;elf again. But the &s;harp humour continued very violent, at times, for &s;ome years: And &s;till continues at &s;ome &s;ea|&s;ons.

But, in all this time of illne&s;s, God won|derfully provided for me. I wanted for none of the comforts of life: Neither was I ca&s;t down; for his mercy held me up.</P>
<P>The in&s;tances of the remarkable hand of God in his providence, in ordering my temporal af|fairs, are innumerable. But, oh vile wretch! after all this I grew flack again, and got into a cold, lifele&s;s frame. As I grew better in bodily health, my &s;oul grew &s;ick. I daily laid up a &s;tock for repentance. But, through rich grace, I was again convinced of my &s;tupidity, and be|gan to be more diligent in attending on the means of grace. But I found I could not prof|it by the word preached: Nothing reached my heart; all &s;eemed but &s;kin deep: And the more I went to meeting, the more I found it &s;o. Then I began to think I mu&s;t take &s;ome other cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Not long after I went to hear Mr. Clap; who told me the very &s;ecrets of my heart in his &s;er|mon, as plain as I could have told them to him, and indeed more &s;o. His &s;ermon was very ter|rible to me. My &s;ins, from my cradle, were ranked in order before my eyes, and they ap|peared dreadful. I &s;aw the depravity of my na|ture; and how I was expo&s;ed to the infinite ju&s;tice of an angry God. All my former convi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions were brought to my remembrance. I &s;aw how I had &s;tifled the motions of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit of God, and re&s;i&s;ted all the kind invita|tions of a compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour. I was heart &s;ick of all my works. And as it had been of|ten &s;ugge&s;ted to me, I believe from Satan, that it

was time enough for me to repent hereafter, it was now &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on my mind, that it was <HI>now</HI> too late for me to find mercy. Once I might have had a Chri&s;t; but now my day was pa&s;t. And it was &s;ugge&s;ted that I had com|mitted the unpardonable &s;in; becau&s;e I had &s;inned again&s;t light and knowledge, even again&s;t the convictions of my own con&s;cience. This I knew I had done; and therefore believed I had committed that &s;in which could never be forgiven.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s, I went to my Bible; but could find nothing but terror there. My whole attention was turned to &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as the fol|lowing. "After thy hardne&s;s and impenitent heart, trea&s;ure&s;t up wrath to thy&s;elf again&s;t the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will reader to every man according to his deeds.

It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Who among us can dwell with everla&s;ting burnings!" All the&s;e, and many more &s;uch terrible pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, I found, whenever I opened the Bible. My eyes were open to nothing el&s;e, and not one
<PB N="23" REF="035636_0012_100613EED629A520">
word of comfort could I find. And if I thought of complying with any commanded duty, I &s;eemed to be frowned away by the&s;e words, What ha&s;t thou to do to take my covenant into thy mouth? Oh, the di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h of &s;oul I then felt, neither my tongue nor pen can ex|pre&s;s, when I was brought to believe there was no mercy for &s;uch a mon&s;ter in &s;in as I was, and expected every moment that hell would open its mouth and &s;wallow me up, amazed that God had kept me out &s;o long!</P>
<P>When Satan, and my wicked heart, had pre|vailed &s;o far as to make me de&s;pair of the mercy of God, and verily to believe hell would be my portion, I was tempted to try to get the ea&s;ie&s;t room there; and, to that end, to keep my&s;elf as ignorant as I could; it being &s;ugge&s;ted to my mind, that the &s;ervant who knew not his Lord's will would be beaten with few &s;tripes; while he who knew it, and did it not, would be beaten with many &s;tripes: And as my time was over for doing his will, I had better leave off reading, praying or hearing the word preached any more; for I &s;hould fare better, if I did. And oh, vile wretch as I was, I yielded in &s;ome mea&s;ure to the &s;ubtil adver&s;ary of my &s;oul and &s;alvation. O, a&s;toni&s;hing grace, that God did not &s;trike me down into hell the very moment I thought to do &s;o! God had been ju&s;t if he had done &s;o, though I mu&s;t have weltered under the &s;cald|ing drops of his wrath forever and ever.</P>
<P>But, O! what &s;hall I &s;ay, or how, with grat|itude enough, expre&s;s the wonderful goodne&s;s of that God, who pre&s;erved me, even when I

was, in my own apprehen&s;ion, upon the very brink of hell, weltering in my blood; when no eye pitied me, and no created arm could &s;ave me: Even then did he &s;pread his &s;kirt over me, and &s;aid to me, Live. After I had been near a week in this di&s;tre&s;s, my very &s;oul racked with fear of what I mu&s;t undergo to all eternity, tho&s;e words, "<HI>Depart from me,</HI>" &s;ounding in my ears, and I uttering the language of hell, "There is no hope! There is no help! The door of mercy is &s;hut again&s;t me forever!" all at once, I was alarmed with the&s;e thoughts, which &s;eemed to be conveyed to my mind in the following words. "Who has told you, that your day of grace is over? Are not the doors of the meeting hou&s;e open? Cannot you hear the offers of &s;alvation? Have you not your Bible to read? And you may pray: Therefore, you &s;ee your external day of grace is not over. And how do you know but you may yet obtain mercy? It is the devil who has &s;ugge&s;ted all this to you; and he is a liar from the beginning." I was then con|vinced, that it was the devil who had been tempting me to de&s;pair of the mercy of God, which I did not perceive before, but verily thought what he &s;ugge&s;ted to me was true, viz. That there was no hope for me.</P>
<P>During the time of this di&s;tre&s;s, which was from Saturday night to the next Saturday night, I &s;lept no more than ju&s;t to keep me alive. And when I did &s;leep, it was filled with terrors. It was the &s;ame with my nece&s;&s;ary food; I thought my|&s;elf &s;o unworthy of the lea&s;t mercy, that I know not how to eat. I found that expre&s;&s;ion of

Oh how terrible mu&s;t it be for tho&s;e poor &s;ouls who are on a death bed, to have &s;uch hard work to do!

<P>After I &s;aw that I was tempted by Satan to de&s;|pair, and knowing that he was a liar, I began, for a few minutes, to have &s;ome glimmering of hope that it might po&s;&s;ibly be, that Chri&s;t would receive me, becau&s;e he had &s;pared me hitherto, on this &s;ide the grave, and out of hell. Who knows, thought I, but I may yet be a child of God. Immediately upon the&s;e thoughts, I was furi|ou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted with new temptations by Satan, I believe, not to flatter my&s;elf with the thought that I &s;hould be a child of God; for I was not elected, and therefore could not be &s;aved. Be|&s;ides, God did not leave his children to be tempted by him, as I had been. I might be &s;ure, if I was one of God's cho&s;en, he would not have &s;uffered me to be tempted &s;o; but I belonged to Satan, and he was &s;ure of me. And I, like a fool, yielded to the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, and at once ca&s;t off my hope again, verily believing it was impo&s;&s;ible that I could ever be a child of

The&s;e words were accompanied with tho&s;e powerful influences of the &s;pirit of God, which excited in me a &s;en&s;e of the excellence, glory and truth of God, and I had a plea&s;ing confidence and re&s;t in the divine faithful|ne&s;s, and embraced the promi&s;es in the&s;e words.

<P>Thus, through rich unlimited grace, was I brought to lay down my arms of rebellion, which I &s;aw I had held as long as I could. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, that I was then compelled to come in, and li&s;t un|der the banner of Chri&s;t.

<P>The next day I went to &s;ee Mr. Clap, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an intent to acquaint him with my de&s;ire to join the church, the&s;e words, <HI>This do in remem|brance of me,</HI> &s;till &s;ounding in my ears.

Then he a&s;ked me the rea&s;on of it. I dare not now make any formal excu&s;es as u&s;ual; but bur&s;t out into tears, and told him, I had been too wicked. He no &s;ooner perceived what my condition was, but like a tender father to a little child, bid me not grieve, if that was the rea&s;on; I was wel|come to him <HI>now:</HI> And he would do all he could to help me forward. And after &s;ome more conver&s;ation, contrary to my expectation, he a&s;ked me if I did not de&s;ire to join to the church? I &s;aid, that was indeed part of my bu|&s;ine&s;s.
<PB N="31" REF="035636_0016_100613F6419CDF50">
I had met with many hinderances, and particularly that awful text of &s;cripture, "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to him&s;elf," had made me afraid to approach the Lord's table. But <HI>now</HI> re&s;olving, through grace, to rely upon Chri&s;t alone for a&s;&s;i&s;tance and acceptance, re|nouncing all my own righteou&s;ne&s;s, believing it to be a po&s;itive commanded duty, I dare not omit it once more, if I might be received. Up|on this he told me he &s;hould inquire into my character. This I told him I expected; but could tell him more of my&s;elf, than any could &s;ay of me, having been, through re&s;training grace, kept from open and &s;candalous &s;ins. Then he &s;aid I had great cau&s;e to be thankful. He bid me come to him, as often as I had a de&s;ire, if it was morning, noon or night, and I &s;hould be always welcome. And he lent me a book, en|titled, "But they &s;eek a better country, even an heavenly." I was &s;o delighted with it, that I &s;at up all night to read it two or three times over.</P>
<P>I vi&s;ited Mr. Clap very often; and he as often expre&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s to do me good. And once in particular, after he had done &s;o, he lift|ed up his hands, giving me his ble&s;&s;ing, and &s;aid, "You &s;ee I am willing to do you all the good I can; and if &s;uch a poor, &s;inful creature as I am, is willing to do &s;o, think with your&s;elf, how much more willing your glorious Lord is to receive you."</P>
<P>The&s;e words having &s;o much rea&s;on in them, filled me with joy un&s;peakable. I hardly knew how to get home. I &s;aw Chri&s;t willing, and I,
<PB N="32" REF="035636_0017_100613F9C8C7AA58">
through grace, made willing. I could utter no other language but, "Come in, Lord Je&s;us, take full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; I will come to thee, thou art mine, and I am thine. Even &s;o, Father; for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight." I immediately retir|ed when I got home, to give vent to my feel|ings. But O, what a rapture was I in, when I renewed my &s;olemn engagements to be the Lord's! Enabled, I tru&s;t, by grace, &s;incerely to take the Lord Jehovah for my covenant God; the Lord Je&s;us to be my Prophet, Prie&s;t and King; the Holy Gho&s;t for my comforter, guide and &s;anctifier; the &s;criptures for my rule to walk by: Giving up my&s;elf, &s;oul and body, all my faculties and members, as in&s;truments of righteou&s;ne&s;s.

And when examining my&s;elf, thrice putting the que&s;|tion to my &s;oul, which Chri&s;t put to Peter, Tell me, O my &s;oul, love&s;t thou the Lord Je&s;us? How did my heart melt, and my eyes &s;low with tears, in appealing to him! Lord, thou knowe&s;t all things, thou knowe&s;t that I love thee. And when inquiring into the cau&s;e of this love which I felt, and from whence it flowed, it &s;till over|came me more, becau&s;e I knew I was brought to love him, by the powerful grace of Chri&s;t, who was before an enemy to him. This cau&s;ed me to loath my&s;elf, and cry out Lord, what a traitor have I been, and yet thou ha&s;t freely lov|ed me! O, why me, Lord! Why am I not in hell! Why among the living to prai&s;e the Lord!
<PB N="33" REF="035636_0017_100613F9C8C7AA58">
There can be no other rea&s;on, but this; where my &s;ins have abounded, thy grace has much more abounded. O, amazing grace! Ha&s;t thou &s;natched me as a brand out of the burning!

O, then how &s;weet was a Saviour! I could heartily &s;ub&s;cribe to tho&s;e words of &s;cripture, "Unto you who believe he is precious. The chief among ten thou&s;and, altogether lovely."</P>
<P>Thus I continued from day to day, in &s;uch ec&s;tacies of joy, thir&s;ting for full &s;anctification, and more intimate communion with God; daily a&s;king what I &s;hould render to him for all his benefits to &s;uch an hell de&s;erving &s;inner; earne&s;tly begging that God would find out &s;ome way for me, that I might be made in&s;trumental in advancing his kingdom and intere&s;t in the world.

And though I know that it every thing I offend, and in all come &s;hort of God's glory; &s;o that every performance has need of wa&s;hing in the blood of Chri&s;t; yet it is a comfort to me, to this day, that I was ena|bled by grace to labour with the little &s;ouls, then committed to my charge; but de&s;ire to be humbled that I did no more.

my eyes, telling me it was impo&s;&s;ible, not with|&s;tanding my great hopes, for me ever to be &s;av|ed. He was &s;till &s;ure of me, and would not let me go. I &s;hould &s;urely turn back again, and be wor&s;e than ever. It is impo&s;&s;ible to relate the tenth part of the fiery darts he &s;lung at me. But I was compo&s;ed, not in the lea&s;t daunted; but could prove him a liar in every thing he &s;ugge&s;t|ed, by &s;cripture, which flowed into my mind, as though I had learned it all by heart. Never had I &s;uch a variety of &s;cripture texts at my command in all my life, either before, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ince. There was nothing he could allege again&s;t me, but if I knew it was true, I immediately &s;ub|&s;cribed to it; and then flew to the particular properties of the blood of Chri&s;t, which I found &s;ufficient for me. Thus I overcame him by the blood of the Lamb; and was left, in the i&s;&s;ue, filled with the con&s;olations of the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit; triumphing over Satan; ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;ing God for delivering me out of the hand of this cruel tyrant; adoring the lovely Je&s;us. And thus I &s;pent the remainder of that night. O, how &s;weet was it to me! I longed for more &s;trength to prai&s;e and love; and even to be di&s;|&s;olved, and to be with Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus I continued for &s;ome time, rejoicing and re&s;olving, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting grace, to pre&s;s forward, and by all means to make my calling and elec|tion &s;ure. Then I wrote my experience to be communicated to the church; and I was admit|ted, February 6, 1737, to partake of that holy ordinance of the Lord's Supper. But it is impo&s;|&s;ible for me to expre&s;s the ec&s;tacy of joy I was
<PB N="36" REF="035636_0019_100613FD38852590">
in, when I &s;aw my&s;elf there, who was by nature a child of wrath, an heir of hell, and by practice a rebel again&s;t God, a re&s;i&s;ter of his grace, a piercer of the lovely Je&s;us, unworthy of the crumbs that fall; yet, through free grace, com|pelled to come in, and partake of children's bread. It was indeed &s;weet to me to feed by faith on the broken body of my deare&s;t Lord. Surely it did humble me to the du&s;t, and filled me with &s;elf abhorrence, as I meditated on his &s;ufferings and death, and knew my &s;ins to be the procuring cau&s;e. But when I came to take the cup, and by faith to apply the precious proper|ties of the blood of Chri&s;t to my &s;oul, the veil of unbelief &s;eemed to drop off, and I was forc|ed to cry out, "My Lord, and my God," when I beheld the hole in his &s;ide, and the prints of the nails. And I could not but, in the words of Peter, appeal to him, Lord, thou knowe&s;t all things, thou knowe&s;t that I love thee." O then I was admitted, with the beloved di&s;ciple, to lean on his brea&s;t! O, a&s;toni&s;hing grace, and un&s;peakable joy, to &s;ee God reconciled to me, in and through him; and he bidding me welcome to his table! The Holy Spirit, by his powerful influences applied all this for my &s;trong con&s;o|lation. O, what a fea&s;t is this, when intimate communion with the glorious God is thus ob|tained! When &s;trong covenant engagements with him are renewed; I being a&s;&s;ured that he was my God, and giving my&s;elf, body and &s;oul, to him forever, and rejoicing in him as my only portion forevermore. Surely, I thought, I could never enough adore the
<PB N="37" REF="035636_0019_100613FD38852590">
lovely Je&s;us for appointing &s;uch an ordinance as this.</P>
<P>But I cea&s;e to &s;ay any more of this; for it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to de&s;cribe the thou&s;andth part of what I then felt. O, that I could always live as one who had thus been on the mount with God! The next morning I was as much refre&s;hed by meditating on the 32d P&s;alm, from the fir&s;t ver&s;e, to the end of the 5th. This cau&s;|ed me yet more to adore di&s;tingui&s;hing grace, and even to be &s;wallowed up with love to the immaculate Lamb; and re&s;olve more and more, with full purpo&s;e of heart to cleave to the Lord. The frequent language of my &s;oul was this, "Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ide thee."</P>
<P>I daily renewed my covenant engagements with God: But that they might be more invio|lably kept, I re&s;olved to write them. And ac|cordingly began to do it; and went on comfort|ably, till I came to write the&s;e words, "That I would leave, lo&s;e, and deny all that was dear to me, when it &s;tood in competition with God, even life it&s;elf, if he &s;hould plea&s;e to call for it, rath|er than to for&s;ake him and his ways." Then Sa|tan be&s;et me, and furiou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulted me. He &s;ugge&s;ted to me that I was now lying to God: For I had nothing in me, that would &s;tand by me, when an hour of trial &s;hould come; but, with the &s;tony ground hearers, would fall away. This gave me a dreadful &s;hock at fir&s;t, and cau&s;ed me to &s;top a while, to plead with God for a di&s;covery of my &s;tate: That he would &s;earch me and try me, and &s;ee if there were any
<PB N="38" REF="035636_0020_1005EDF780809210">
wicked way in me: And grant me real and per&s;evering grace. And in an&s;wer to my pe|titions, the following portion of God's word was powerfully &s;et home to my heart, "My grace is &s;ufficient for thee." And then my heart was filled with joy and prai&s;es, firmly believing he was faithful who had promi&s;ed, and therefore would perform it. So I proceeded to write with more fixed re&s;olution than before.</P>
<P>But again Satan with great fury a&s;&s;aulted me, and told me, my hope would &s;urely peri&s;h; and I &s;hould turn back, and be wor&s;e than ever, and brought to &s;hame; and ranked in order my &s;ins of youth. But I immediately opened my Bible, being dreadfully &s;hocked with fear le&s;t it &s;hould be &s;o. And the fir&s;t lines I ca&s;t my eyes upon were in I&s;aiah liv. 4, &amp;c. "Fear not; for thou &s;halt not be a&s;hamed: Neither be thou con|founded, for thou &s;halt not be put to &s;hame: For thou &s;halt forget the &s;hame of thy youth, and &s;halt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. For thy Maker is thine hu&s;band, the Lord of ho&s;ts is his name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of I&s;rael, the God of the whole earth &s;hall he be called. For the Lord hath called thee as a woman for&s;aken and griev|ed in &s;pirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wa&s;t refu&s;ed, &s;aith thy God. For a &s;mall moment have I for&s;aken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment; but with ever|la&s;ting kindne&s;s will I have mercy on thee, &s;aith the Lord thy Redeemer. For this is as the wa|ters of Noah unto me. For as I have &s;worn

that the waters of Noah &s;hould n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> go over the earth; &s;o have I &s;worn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. For the mountains &s;hall depart, and the hills be remov|ed; but my kindne&s;s &s;hall not depart from thee, neither &s;hall the covenant of my peace be re|moved, &s;aith the Lord that hath mercy on thee." The&s;e gracious promi&s;es were &s;o adapted to ev|ery particular of my circum&s;tances, and applied by the Spirit of God, with &s;uch great power, that they &s;trengthened me exceedingly.</P>
<P>But O, when I had fini&s;hed writing my cov|enant, which was on the 26th of March, 1737, and came to &s;pread it before God, and with prayers and tears to deliver it to him as my own act and deed, it verily &s;eemed to me that all the heavens rang with acclamations of joy, that &s;uch a prodigal as I was returned to my God and Father. And my joy was &s;o great, that my bodily &s;trength failed, and I was, for &s;ome time, as one who&s;e &s;oul was ready to break loo&s;e, and wing away into the bo&s;om of my God. O, how welcome a me&s;&s;enger would death then have been to me! But my great petition was, that I might with patience wait my appointed time, and glorify God upon earth.</P>
<P>After I had &s;o &s;olemnly delivered my &s;olemn covenant engagements to God, under hand and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eal, I went on my way rejoicing; this being the language of my &s;oul, "Who &s;hall &s;eparate me from the love of God? Shall tribulation, or di&s;|tre&s;s, or per&s;ecution, or famine, or nakedne&s;s, or peril, or &s;word? No. I am per&s;uaded, that neither life, nor death, nor angels, nor princi|palities,

nor powers, nor things pre&s;ent, nor thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, &s;hall be able to &s;eparate me from the love of God which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us my Lord." And I am a&s;toni&s;hed, when I remember the a|mazing conde&s;cen&s;ion of my God! He granted me near acce&s;s to the throne of his grace contin|ually: And in almo&s;t every thing for which I earne&s;tly prayed, I was remarkably an&s;wered; and &s;o &s;urpri&s;ingly, at &s;ome times, that I was afraid to think it was &s;o.</P>
<P>Once in particular, in that &s;ame month of March, as I was a&s;leep in the bed, early in the morning, I was awaked with the mo&s;t terrible wind that I ever knew. It immediately tore off both my windows, and carried them into the &s;treet. I ro&s;e directly, and looked out. I think I never &s;aw the heavens and the water look &s;o dreadfully before: And the wind blew exceed|ing hard, &s;o that it appeared that all the ve&s;&s;els in the harbor would &s;oon be broken to pieces. I thought of tho&s;e poor &s;ouls who were expo&s;ed to the fury of the &s;torm; and my heart was fil|led with tender pity and compa&s;&s;ion for them. I retired, for &s;ecrecy, into the garret. After I got there, I expected every moment that the roof would be ripped off and blown away. But I was very earne&s;t with God to abate the vio|lence of the &s;torm, and to have compa&s;&s;ion on the poor &s;ouls in di&s;tre&s;s. And while I continued pleading with God, I had an affecting view and &s;en&s;e of the &s;ufficiency of one word of Chri&s;t to do it. It was only for him to &s;ay, "Peace, be &s;till," and the winds and &s;ea would immediately obey him.
<PB N="41" REF="035636_0021_10061400A6D50A40">
And after I had &s;ome time thus wre&s;tled with God in prayer, I went down. I had been &s;o earne&s;tly engaged, that I had not perceived any abate|ment of the &s;torm; but looking again out of the window in my chamber, I was &s;urpri&s;ed a|bove mea&s;ure. The &s;ea looked as calm and plea&s;ant to me, as if there had been no &s;torm. I immediately retired again, and returned thanks for it, as a remarkable an&s;wer of prayer. But have often heard &s;ince, that it was a piece of pride and pre&s;umption for me to think it &s;o. However, this I know, God is both the hearer and an&s;werer of prayer, for Je&s;us' &s;ake.</P>
<P>I could not avoid, when there was opportu|nity for it, expre&s;&s;ing my love and thankfulne&s;s to God, for &s;natching me as a brand out of the burning: And when I did this once to my mother, with tears of joy running down my cheeks, &s;he &s;aid to me, "Ah, child, you will not always find your love thus flaming to the ble&s;|&s;ed Je&s;us. After a while you will be more cool again." But I ha&s;tily an&s;wered, too much like Peter, It was impo&s;&s;ible I could be &s;uch a mon|&s;ter for ingratitude. But &s;he told me, &s;he did not mean that I &s;hould in reality love him le&s;s, but compared the fir&s;t e&s;pou&s;als of a &s;oul to Chri&s;t, with that of a hu&s;band and wife, which was generally attended with more fondne&s;s and joy, than afterwards, though the love might be the &s;ame, or &s;tronger.</P>
<P>I continued to go on my way rejoicing for &s;ome time, without knowing what is was to be de&s;erted one hour together, or entirely to lo&s;e &s;en&s;ible communion with God in any duty or
<PB N="42" REF="035636_0022_100614051EE26710">
&s;pecial ordinance, or ever to lie down without God; or to awake without &s;ome &s;weet and refre&s;h|ing portion of the word of God in my thoughts. My very &s;leep was filled with plea&s;ant thoughts of divine things. Surely I enjoyed &s;ome foreta&s;te of heaven at this &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e were happy days.&mdash;But now how &s;hall I &s;peak! Oh that I may do it with a heart truly broken for my &s;ins! After all this, I began to grow more conformed to the world. Things which, when I was thus lively, appeared in&s;ipid, and indeed odious to me, began to grow more tolerable, and by degrees in a mea&s;ure plea&s;ant. And depraved nature and Satan together plead|ed for them thus, "That there was a time for all things; and &s;inging and dancing now and then, with a particular friend, was an innocent di|ver&s;ion. Who did I &s;ee, be&s;ides my&s;elf, &s;o pre|ci&s;e and &s;trict? Other chri&s;tians allowed them|&s;elves in &s;uch things, who, I had rea&s;on to think, were far &s;uperior to me in grace; e&s;pecially one with whom I was very intimate. Sure, if it was &s;in, &s;he would not allow her&s;elf in it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t was for extraordinary chri&s;tians, &s;uch as mini&s;|ters, and others who were eminent for piety, to avoid the practice of &s;uch things, and not for <HI>me.</HI> Who did I think I was, that I &s;hould pretend to outdo other chri&s;tians? They could talk of worldly things. What ailed me?" Thus the devil and carnal rea&s;oning argued me out of a great part of my re&s;olutions for &s;trict godline&s;s; and, in &s;hort, made me, in a &s;ort, believe that it was only pride and hypocri&s;y, and to be &s;een of men, that had ever made me pretend to it.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="035636_0022_100614051EE26710">Thus I &s;unk by degrees lower and lower, till I had at la&s;t almo&s;t lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of my former experiences. I had only the bare remembrance of them, and they &s;eemed like dreams or delu|&s;ion, at &s;ome times. At others again, I had &s;ome revivals. I &s;till con&s;tantly attended the means of grace, and Sabbaths were &s;ometimes very &s;weet to me. At times I had acce&s;s to the throne of grace, and obtained &s;ome communion with God, and re&s;olved to be more circum&s;pect, and renewed my covenant engagements with God. But I knew I was a dreadful back&s;lider, and had dealt treacherou&s;ly with God, and &s;ometimes dare not, with any boldne&s;s, look up to him; guilt would &s;top my mouth. At other times gracious invitations to back&s;liders to return, would revive me. Thus I continued, for a great while, &s;ome times revived, and &s;ometimes &s;unk, and dejected.</P>
<P>In Sept. 1740, God in mercy &s;ent his dear &s;ervant Whitefield here, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;tirred me up. But when Mr. Tennent came &s;oon after, it plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s his preaching &s;o to me, that it rou&s;ed me. But I was all the winter after exerci&s;ed with dreadful doubts and fears about my &s;tate. I que&s;tioned the truth of all I had experienced, and feared I had never yet pa&s;&s;ed through the pangs of the new birth, or ever had one &s;park of grace. And what confirmed this to me, my dear aged pa&s;tor, Mr. Clap, frequently preached, that they who had <HI>real grace,</HI> had <HI>growing grace.</HI> This u&s;ed to make me tremble, becau&s;e I could not perceive any growth; but thought I rather went back,
<PB N="44" REF="035636_0023_10061409A5D75CD8">
and grew wor&s;e. Thus I was covered over with thick clouds for months together. Oh, the dreadful fruits of back&s;liding! At la&s;t, I applied to Mr. Clap, and begged of him, that if he knew of any thing which I had left undone, by what I had told him, or wrote for my admi&s;&s;ion into the church, he would let me know it, that the mi&s;take might be rectified before it was too late. I was indeed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the thought, that he &s;aw &s;o clearly into my &s;tate, that he knew I was a hypocrite, though I did not till then. I told him of this. But he &s;aid, he never thought &s;o; and put me upon renewing covenant en|gagements with God, and giving my&s;elf up to him <HI>then</HI>; and perhaps I &s;hould find I had done &s;o before. This I endeavored to do, and did get &s;ome relief; but was not yet &s;atisfied. The tokens of a woful back&s;lider were upon me. I had for&s;aken my fir&s;t love, and God ju&s;tly de|&s;erted me. Sometimes that text would refre&s;h me, "Return, ye back&s;liding children, and I will heal your back&s;lidings." My heart would an&s;wer, "Behold I come unto thee; for thou art the Lord my God." And &s;ometimes that pa&s;|&s;age, "I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and as a cloud thy &s;ins: Return unto me; for I have redeemed thee." But ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all this time I could not get clear of doubts; but thought &s;uch dreadful formality and hypoc|ri&s;y, as I perceived to be in my heart, could not con&s;i&s;t with grace. I labored along thus all the winter, unre&s;olved how the ca&s;e &s;tood be|tween God and my &s;oul: And an uncomforta|ble, dreadful life it was. At &s;ome times I was
<PB N="45" REF="035636_0023_10061409A5D75CD8">
&s;o covered with darkne&s;s, that I &s;eemed to be &s;ure I had not one &s;park of grace: At other times afraid of ingratitude, afraid to deny what God had done for my &s;oul. Oh, the&s;e were the dreadful fruits of back&s;liding, and lo&s;ing my fir&s;t love! The Lord in mercy pre&s;erve me, that I may never do &s;o any more!</P>
<P>I continued thus till March, 1741. And then it plea&s;ed God to return Mr. Tennent to us again, and he preached twenty one &s;ermons here. But while he was here, I was more than ever di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. I had lo&s;t the &s;en&s;ible manife&s;ta|tions of Chri&s;t's love. I had no more but a bare remembrance of &s;ome things, which I had experienced; and yet I was afraid to draw up a conclu&s;ion, one way or the other. I applied to Mr. Tennent, and he di&s;cour&s;ed very &s;uitably with me. But &s;till I was not quiet, but exceed|ingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome light and refre&s;hment under his preaching the next day; but my darkne&s;s return|ed again, and I &s;unk very low. I was &s;o afraid of pre&s;umption, that I dare not conclude my &s;tate was good. And he &s;truck directly at tho&s;e things, for which I had &s;o fooli&s;hly and wickedly pleaded chri&s;tian example, &s;uch as &s;inging &s;ongs, dancing, and fooli&s;h je&s;ting, which is not convenient. He &s;aid, he would not &s;ay there was no &s;uch thing as a dancing chri&s;tian, but he had a very mean opinion of &s;uch as could bear to &s;pend their time &s;o, when it is &s;o &s;hort, and the work for eternity &s;o great. Then, and not till then, was I fully convinced what prod|igal wa&s;ters of precious time &s;uch things were.
<PB N="46" REF="035636_0024_1006140B318E1C88">
And, through grace, I have abhorred them all ever &s;ince. And to the glory of God be it &s;poken; for it is only from his &s;overeign won|derful goodne&s;s to me.</P>
<P>I am indeed now a&s;toni&s;hed when I think how I my&s;elf, or any other chri&s;tian, who has once ta&s;ted one moment's &s;weet communion with God, can have any reli&s;h for &s;uch vanities as &s;inging and dancing, &amp;c. O, how much great|er is the plea&s;ure which is to be enjoyed in the exer|ci&s;e of religious duties, than any &s;uch thing can afford! Not only &s;o; but I am amazed to think how I could po&s;&s;ibly want &s;uch things to pa&s;s away time: For I now find the precious moments fly &s;o fa&s;t, and my work &s;o great, that I am often hard be&s;et to know how to &s;pend my time as God requires, between the immediate exerci&s;es of religion, public, private and &s;ecret, and the calling, in which God has placed me. I know the &s;ame God, who has bid me hear, and pray, and &s;earch the &s;criptures, has bid me work; and both in their place is my duty. And I find it very difficult to yield a uniform obedience; to give to God, what he requires for him&s;elf, and to the world, what is required as a duty, and no more. Be&s;ides all this, my heart is &s;o perver&s;e, that I have enough to do to watch again&s;t pride, &s;loth, wanderings, formality, hypocri&s;y, and the temptations of Satan, who is always ready to di&s;quiet me. All the&s;e, I find, are employment enough to take up all my time, without tho&s;e former recreations. If I am cheerful, a &s;ong of Zion is more &s;weet and refre&s;hing to me, that all the vain &s;ongs in the world ever were, or can
<PB N="47" REF="035636_0024_1006140B318E1C88">
be. And &s;ure I am, whatever any may plead, that there is a time for all things, God never yet allowed time for &s;in.</P>
<P>O Lord, humble me for the bad example I have &s;et, &s;ince I called my&s;elf a Chri&s;tian; and forbid that any &s;hould ever again be able to plead my example for vanity. And oh, that all who name the name of Chri&s;t, may be ena|bled to depart from iniquity, and ab&s;tain from all appearance of evil! And if we pretend to be in Chri&s;t, oh that we may walk even as he walked! For I am per&s;uaded, that the carele&s;s walk of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians, lulls more con|&s;ciences a&s;leep, when the devil, and fle&s;h and blood &s;et in to plead their example, than the vices of all the world be&s;ides, who make no profe&s;&s;ion. And oh, what a dreadful thing for chri&s;tians to be the means of ruining precious and immortal &s;ouls, and dimini&s;hing that king|dom and intere&s;t, which they &s;hould be forever engaged to promote; and promote his kingdom and intere&s;t, again&s;t which they &s;hould always proclaim open war! Oh dreadful indeed! that Chri&s;t &s;hould be &s;o wounded in the hou&s;e of his friends! Lord, make me yet more circum|&s;pect, for Je&s;us' &s;ake.&mdash;But to proceed&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;till continued in very dark and melancho|ly circum&s;tances, between hope and fear, afraid to conclude one way or the other. And having no opportunity to &s;peak with Mr. Tennent again, I wrote to him as well as I could, briefly relat|ing what I had experienced, and begged of him to try it by &s;cripture rules, and judge of it accordingly, and give me his opinion; that I

They who have been &s;o humbled and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for &s;in, as to be divorced from the governing love and practice of it; and have been by the Spirit of God made willing to embrace the Redeemer deliberately, unre&s;ervedly, and re&s;olutely, upon his own terms, have a &s;ure intere&s;t in the great &s;alvation.

Though they have played the harlot with many lovers; yet they may return to their fir&s;t hu&s;band. Though God may hide his face for a little mo|ment, yet with everla&s;ting loving kindne&s;s will he return.

<P>I have tran&s;cribed this letter, that, if Provi|dence &s;hould ever ca&s;t the&s;e lines into the hands of any in like circum&s;tances, it may, if the Lord will, have the &s;ame happy effect on them, as, by
<PB N="49" REF="035636_0025_1006140CCD9FDE88">
the ble&s;&s;ing of God, it had on me; which was this&mdash;The letter it&s;elf was exceeding &s;weet and refre&s;hing; but the precious texts of &s;cripture, which were quoted, were &s;o powerfully &s;et home on my mind, that they &s;cattered all my clouds im|mediately, and I was as one re&s;tored from the grave. Then with life and courage I again re|newed my written covenant engagements with God, and became more lively and zealous for God than ever. O the amazing goodne&s;s of God to me! I have heard of &s;ome chri&s;tians who never recover &s;uch back&s;lidings all their days. But I have not &s;ince lo&s;t my evidences of grace. Though I have been &s;ometimes un|der de&s;ertion, yet I could frequently &s;ay, "Why art thou ca&s;t down, O my &s;oul, and why art thou di&s;quieted within me? Hope in God, for I &s;hall yet prai&s;e him, who is the light of my countenance, and my God."</P>
<P>After I was thus revived, my longings to be made u&s;eful in the world returned, and I earn|e&s;tly pleaded with God that he would not &s;uffer me to live any longer an unprofitable &s;ervant; but would point out &s;ome way, in which I might be u&s;eful: And that I might now be as exem|plary for piety, as I had been for folly. And it plea&s;ed God &s;o to order it, that I had room to hope my petitions were both heard, and in a mea&s;ure an&s;wered. For &s;oon after this a num|ber of young women, who were awakened to a concern for their &s;ouls, came to me, and de&s;ired my advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and propo&s;ed to join in a &s;ociety, provided I would take the care of them. To which, I tru&s;t with a &s;en&s;e of my
<PB N="50" REF="035636_0026_1006140E57DF1198">
own unworthine&s;s, I joyfully con&s;ented. And much &s;weetne&s;s we enjoyed in the&s;e meetings. (And ble&s;&s;ed be God, they are yet kept up.)</P>
<P>About this time it plea&s;ed God to lay his af|flicting hand upon me by the removal of my on|ly brother by death. As to the lo&s;s of his per&s;on, I found I could quietly &s;ubmit, and &s;ay, "The Lord gave, and he has taken away, and ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord." But I had a &s;inful curio&s;ity to know how it was with his precious &s;oul: And being filled with fear about it, I was very much dejected. But I knew my cu|rio&s;ity was &s;inful. And I pleaded earne&s;tly with God, that he would not &s;uffer me to attempt to pry into the &s;ecrets of his will; but give me a quiet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. I continued wre&s;tling with God for re&s;ignation to his will, till about two o'clock in the morning, and then I went to bed, &s;till begging that I might never &s;pend another day unre&s;igned. And ju&s;t about break of day I awaked with the following words &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed on my mind, "Secret things belong un|to God, but tho&s;e which are revealed belong unto us. The will of God is done, <HI>the will of God is done.</HI>" The&s;e words quieted me, &s;o that I aro&s;e as cheerful, compo&s;ed and thankful, as if I had met with no affliction at all, and I think more &s;o; and never did from that hour, nor could mourn as I had done. This I con&s;id|ered as a remarkable an&s;wer to prayer.</P>
<P>After this my bu&s;ine&s;s failed, and I found I could not keep my room where I lived; and which way to turn, I knew not. But was per|&s;uaded God would point out &s;ome way for me.
<PB N="51" REF="035636_0026_1006140E57DF1198">
I had &s;everal offers to go into the country to keep &s;chool in credible families, where I had a pro&s;pect of wanting for nothing of the nece&s;&s;a|ries of this life. But I could not bear the thought of going from the means of grace, and other precious privileges, which I then enjoy|ed. And the &s;ociety of young women often entreated me not to leave them. I had double ties every way, and knew not what to do. But I was not di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, believing God would pro|vide for me. Accordingly he did &s;o; though by an afflictive di&s;pen&s;ation. It plea&s;ed him to remove a dear friend by death, with whom I was very intimate. Her hu&s;band was a very &s;ober good &s;ort of a man, and wanted me to keep his &s;hop for my board, and wa&s;h for my|&s;elf. This offer &s;uited me very well; for here|by I was not likely to be deprived of any of my religious privileges. So on the fir&s;t day of July, I went there to live, and indeed had much comfort. Dear Mr. Clap met with the &s;ociety at his hou&s;e twice every week, which I con&s;tantly attended; and religion &s;eemed to be the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of my life. Had much com|fort in all the duties of religion, public, private, and &s;ecret: And had as much time to &s;pend in them as I could de&s;ire.</P>
<P>About this time I had the offer of a &s;econd marriage, with one who appeared to be a real chri&s;tian (and I could not think of being une|qually yoked with one who was not &s;uch.) I took the matter into &s;erious con&s;ideration. I fore&s;aw there were difficulties which I mu&s;t un|avoidably encounter; and many duties would
<PB N="52" REF="035636_0027_100614122ABB0E70">
be incumbent on me, to which I had been a &s;tranger: Particularly, in my being a mother in law to three &s;ons, which my propo&s;ed hu&s;band had by a fir&s;t wife. But after weighing all cir|cum&s;tances, as well as I could, in my mind, and earne&s;t prayer&punc; which God enabled me to con|tinue in for &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. I concluded it was the will of God, that I &s;hould accept of the offer, and accordingly was married to Mr. Henry O&s;born, on the fifth day of May, 1742.</P>
<P>The next July after I was married, I went with an intimate friend, to Little Compton, on purpo&s;e to join in a fa&s;t which was appointed there to implore the outpouring of the Spirit of God on that place; which was attended with much &s;olemnity. The next day, which was the 29th day of the month, my friend and I were riding to a private religious meeting, and my hor&s;e &s;tumbled and threw me over his head. My &s;tomach came fir&s;t to the ground; and yet was comparatively but little hurt; and clo&s;e by the &s;pot where my head came was a large rock, which mu&s;t, in all probability, have ended my days, if I had fallen upon it. This gave me a &s;en&s;e of the goodne&s;s of God in pre|&s;erving me. I got &s;afe to the hou&s;e to which I propo&s;ed to go. And in the evening Mr. Ty|lar preached a &s;ermon, which greatly affected the people, who were under concern before: But they with much difficulty kept &s;ilence, till the &s;ermon and prayer were ended; and then cried out in vehement agonies, lamenting their lo&s;t condition without a Savior, and pleading with God to have mercy on them, and give
<PB N="53" REF="035636_0027_100614122ABB0E70">
them an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t. At this time I had an awful &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate of the damned, who were crying out under their torments; but pa&s;t remedy.</P>
<P>Then a number of young women with my|&s;elf withdrew into a chamber, in order to form a religious &s;ociety. Where we &s;pent &s;ome time in praying, reading, conver&s;ing and &s;inging. At the &s;ame time a company of young men were engaged in another room in the &s;ame ex|erci&s;es. We happened to &s;ing in both rooms at the &s;ame time. The melody was very &s;weet, and gave me lively apprehen&s;ions of the glori|ous employment, and ble&s;&s;ed enjoyment of the &s;aints in the New Jeru&s;alem; and filled my &s;oul with adoring thoughts of God.</P>
<P>But in my return to the place where I lodg|ed, it being late in the night, we were over|taken in the mo&s;t awful &s;torm of thunder and lightning that I ever heard or &s;aw. During the terrible claps of thunder my hor&s;e &s;tood trem|bling; and as &s;oon as they cea&s;ed, ran with full &s;peed. I was then filled with a greater &s;en&s;e of the awfulne&s;s and maje&s;ty of a God, than I had ever experienced before; and more realizing thoughts of the &s;olemnity of the la&s;t day. I did not imagine that was the time; but thought it a great re&s;emblance of it. And I expected every moment to be called to appear before my Judge, either by the thunder and lightning, or a fall from my hor&s;e. This put me upon examining my&s;elf, to &s;ee where the foundation of my hope was laid; and whether I had real grace, and a &s;ure intere&s;t in Chri&s;t;
<PB N="54" REF="035636_0028_10061416488D21F8">
that he might then be my advocate. I earne&s;tly pleaded that this might be my very ca&s;e. Upon &s;trict &s;earch, I found &s;uch evidences as kept me from all fears of hell. Though I did not then feel the manife&s;tations of the love of God, as at &s;ome other times; yet I found Chri&s;t was my only refuge. But ju&s;t after the la&s;t hard clap of thunder, my hor&s;e turning &s;uddenly round a corner, threw me off backward. My right temple came fir&s;t to the ground. As I fell, I committed my &s;pirit into the hands of my Savior, expecting death: But was wonder|fully pre&s;erved; &s;o that I was but little hurt. Thus God &s;hewed me, in this day and night of large experience, what he could do <HI>with me,</HI> in a way of judgment; and what <HI>for me,</HI> in a way of mercy, in pre&s;erving me, when in imminent danger of death. Lord, for thine own name's &s;ake, write a law of gratitude in my heart for this, with all my other mercies. O Lord, what am I, the chief of &s;inners, that thou art thus mindful of me!</P>
<P>Soon after this, we fell into di&s;agreeable and difficult worldly circum&s;tances, with re&s;pect to living and paying the debts we owed. My greate&s;t concern was with re&s;pect to the latter, le&s;t we &s;hould not be able to do ju&s;tice, and &s;o wrong our creditors, and bring di&s;honor on God, and our profe&s;&s;ion. Under this pre&s;&s;ure and di&s;tre&s;s, I was relieved and &s;upported by the following words of Scripture, "Let your conver&s;ation be without covetou&s;ne&s;s; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e content with &s;uch things as ye have; for he hath &s;aid, I will never leave thee, nor for&s;ake

<P>I have often thought God has &s;o ordered it throughout my days hitherto, that I &s;hould be in an afflicted, low condition, as to worldly circum&s;tances, and inclined the hearts of oth|ers to relieve me in all my di&s;tre&s;&s;es, on pur|po&s;e to &s;uppre&s;s that pride of my nature, which doubtle&s;s would have been acted out greatly to his di&s;honor, had I enjoyed hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, and had pro&s;perity, &s;o as to live independent of others. I will therefore think it be&s;t for me; for the tenderne&s;s of my friends to me, has always had a tendency to humble me greatly, and cau&s;e me to admire the goodne&s;s of God to me, that while others were daily complaining, that the rich have many friends; but the poor is de&s;|pi&s;ed by his neighbor, I could never &s;ay I had not as much love and re&s;pect &s;hewed me, as if I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great riches, and that by the rich, as well as the poor.

<HEAD>PART II. Containing a <HI>GENERAL ACCOUNT</HI> of her <HI>LIFE</HI>&punc;</HEAD>
<P>THE parents of Mrs. O&s;born were never in affluent worldly circum&s;tances; and had lit|tle or nothing to give to her when &s;he mar|ried: And perhaps did not give her all the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance which they were able to do, as they were not plea&s;ed with her marrying to the per|&s;on whom &s;he cho&s;e. He was young, and u&s;ed the &s;ea, and had nothing beforehand, and died in the &s;econd voyage after he was married, and &s;he was left a poor widow with one young child before &s;he was twenty years old. She contin|ued a widow more than eight years. In which time &s;he did no more than ju&s;t &s;upport her&s;elf and &s;on, by her indu&s;try, in keeping a &s;mall &s;chool part of the time; which bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he was, at length, obliged to relinqui&s;h, by &s;ickne&s;s, in which &s;he needed and had the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome of her kind friends. Thus &s;he continued a poor widow, till &s;he married the &s;eccond time, in the twenty ninth year of her age.</P>
<P>Her &s;econd hu&s;band was in &s;ome trade and bu&s;ine&s;s when &s;he married him; but &s;oon ap|peared to owe to his creditors more than he was able to pay. They gave up all they had and their creditors were paid, &s;o that they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="59" REF="035636_0030_1006141A4C4BACB0">
all made ea&s;y, and gave them a di&s;charge. From that time he did but little or no bu&s;ine&s;s, by rea&s;on of bodily di&s;orders, and other infirm|ities. At the &s;ame time he had children who were poor, and wanted a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, Mrs. O&s;born began to keep &s;chool again in May, 1744. In which bu&s;ine&s;s &s;he continued about thirty years, till her eye&s;ight and bodily &s;trength failed, &s;o that &s;he was o|bliged to give it up. She was, during this whole time, attended with bodily weakne&s;s, pains and infirmities; her con&s;titution being greatly in|jured by taking mercury in an improper man|ner and degree, which was pre&s;cribed by her phy&s;ician when afflicted with the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;|order, which &s;he mentions in the account &s;he has given of her life, the weakening and painful effects of which attended her to the day of her death. Under the&s;e di&s;orders, which were at times very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, &s;he per&s;evered in her bu|&s;ine&s;s, which in her circum&s;tances required a diligence, circum&s;pection and re&s;olution, which have been equalled by few or none, until &s;he lo&s;t her &s;ight and &s;trength, to &s;uch a degree as obliged her to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>For this &s;pace of about thirty years &s;he pre|&s;ided in a &s;chool, which was mo&s;t of the time &s;o large that &s;he was obliged to employ a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The whole number of children in her &s;chool a|mounted &s;ometimes to &s;eventy or more, &s;ome of whom, at times eight or ten, &s;he boarded.</P>
<P>But, having a con&s;iderable family of her own to maintain, and other dependents which &s;he thought it her duty to help, and the price for

&s;chooling and boarding being low, &s;he, through this whole time, was not able to lay up any thing; but was reduced to great &s;traits and dif|ficulties; and at the end of the year &s;he fre|quently found her&s;elf in the rear, rather than to have gained any overplus or &s;tock for the next; this kept her in a con&s;tant &s;tate of peculiar trial, and temptation to worldly &s;olicitude and anxie|ty, which required an uncommon degree of faith and piety to &s;urmount. And &s;ometimes, under the darke&s;t appearances, her faith would &s;o far fail that &s;he would &s;ink into gloom and dejection, e&s;pecially in the former part of this time. But &s;he evidently made advances in her faith and cheerful re&s;ignation to the divine will, and happy contentment with the allotments of Divine Providence, while her trials and worldly &s;traits, continued as great as ever: So that &s;he appeared, at length, to have got the victory over the world to an uncommon degree, and to have enjoyed a calm, &s;weet re&s;ignation and content|ment in her worldly circum&s;tances, which was the &s;ource of high religious enjoyment, in the con&s;tant and &s;trong exerci&s;e of that piety, by which &s;he enjoyed God as her only and eternal portion. This appears from her diary; and was e&s;pecially manife&s;t to her intimate friends, after &s;he was obliged to give up all bu&s;ine&s;s, and was wholly dependent on her friends for &s;up|port; of which a more particular account may be given, before the&s;e memoirs are fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>Mrs. O&s;born began to keep &s;chool the &s;ec|ond time, as has been ob&s;erved, in the month of May, 1744, in the thirty fir&s;t year of her age.

<P>"<HI>Saturday April</HI> 28, 1744.&mdash;This day I am determined, if the Lord will, to enter again into the calling of keeping &s;chool. Will the Lord in mercy ble&s;s my endeavors, and pro&s;per the work of my hands, and overrule this for his own glory, by making me in&s;trumental in promoting the good of &s;ouls. O Lord, if thou wilt again employ me, and make me faithful, my tongue &s;hall &s;ing aloud of thy righteou&s;ne&s;s. Oh, pre|&s;erve me from making dependence on any thing I can do, either for &s;oul or body: But if it may con&s;i&s;t with thy will, O ble&s;s me in this lawful undertaking. But above all, O Lord, go on to re&s;ign me to thy will. Not mine, but thine be done. Lord, I de&s;ire to leave it with thee. O undertake for me, and deal graciou&s;ly with me, for thine own &s;ake, as thou u&s;e&s;t to do to tho&s;e who love thy name. Help me to eye thee in all thy di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, and be thankful to thee for every temporal mercy. Dear Lord, order it &s;o that thine own honor may be &s;ecured, and thou maye&s;t be glorified in me, and it is enough. Once more, I beg to be re&s;igned, and to take all things well at thy dear hand. Whether thou &s;mile or frown, let me ble&s;s and love; for this is my duty, and what thou ju&s;tly expecte&s;t of me. Lord, thou art worthy of infinitely more love and prai&s;e than I am capable of giving: But oh, accept my at|tempts to love and prai&s;e, for Je&s;us' &s;ake alone.
<PB N="62" REF="035636_0032_1006141F35EE1760">
In his name I come to thee for all ble&s;&s;ings, &s;pir|itual and temporal.</P>
<P>"<HI>Friday morning, May</HI> 4.&mdash;At this time much &s;traitened in my&s;elf to know if it is my duty to pray evening and morning in my &s;chool, if the Lord ble&s;s me with one. I am a|fraid of o&s;tentation, afraid of doing any thing to be &s;een of men. I am afraid of neglecting it, on account of what others will &s;ay or think, le&s;t that &s;hould be being a&s;hamed of Chri&s;t and his ways, in this wicked generation; and yet, I am afraid of bringing religion into contempt. O Lord, direct me to do, in this ca&s;e, as will mo&s;t con&s;i&s;t with thy glory. For I be&s;eech thee, dear Lord, that thou wilt not &s;uffer me to enter into this calling, except thou wilt be with me, and ble&s;s me in it. Oh, make me in&s;trumental of the good of their &s;ouls committed to my charge, as well as faithful to their parents in in|&s;tructing them. And if it be thy will that I pray with them, as well as for them, oh &s;trength|en me and encourage my heart. Lord, pour out on me a &s;pirit of prayer and &s;upplication, that I may a&s;k for things agreeable to thy ble&s;&s;ed will. O Lord, I leave this ca&s;e with thee. I beg thou wilt direct me, and &s;uffer nothing but pure aims at thy glory, and the good of &s;ouls, to be the governing principle in me. Lord, I am afraid of the rea&s;onings of my own deceitful heart. It ea&s;ily impo&s;es upon, and deceives me. But, ble&s;&s;ed be thy name, it cannot de|ceive thee. O, do thou &s;earch it and try it, and di&s;cover to me more of its vilene&s;s, that I may never be a fool, tru&s;ting to it. Lord, it is

thine: Oh mould it into thine own likene&s;s, fill it with thy grace, and po&s;&s;e&s;s it forever.</P>
<P>"<HI>Thur&s;day May</HI> 10.&mdash;I de&s;ire to record it with thankfulne&s;s, that God in his providence gave me an opportunity la&s;t evening to advi&s;e with my dear aged pa&s;tor (Mr. Clap) about praying with my &s;cholars. He rejoiced much in the propo&s;al; and advi&s;ed me, by all means to proceed, and let nothing di&s;courage me, and fear no &s;coffs; for it was God's cau&s;e, and he who put it into my heart to do it, would take care of his own glory. He likewi&s;e reminded me how highly Chri&s;t re&s;ented it, when his own di&s;ciples would have deprived little children of privileges. He advi&s;ed me to be brief and plain, and often to mention tho&s;e words in Matth. vi. "A&s;k, and ye &s;hall receive; &s;eek, and ye &s;hall find; knock, and it &s;hall be open|ed unto you." And tho&s;e in Prov. "I love them that love me, and tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me." And to make confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in, and plead for pardon for Chri&s;t's &s;ake.&mdash;En|deavor to follow him in plainne&s;s, &s;o that the little ones might under&s;tand what I meant, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"As I think I never &s;aw him more joyful, and plea&s;ed with me, &s;o I know not when I have come away more comforted: For my &s;cruples all vani&s;hed. And now, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting grace, I determine to proceed, as God &s;hall en|able me. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, that I enjoy &s;o great a privilege as my dear pa&s;tor, who has thus en|couraged my faith, obedience and joy; and helped me in my &s;trait. And now, O my God, I am convinced it is my duty to pray with my dear

children, I fly to thee again for a&s;&s;i&s;ting grace. Lord, without that it will be only a piece of formality, and will never prove &s;erviceable to any. I be&s;eech thee, O Lord, pour out on me a &s;pirit of prayer, and fill me with bowels of compa&s;&s;ion to poor little ones."</P>
<P>Mrs. O&s;born not only prayed daily with the children in her &s;chool; but was con&s;tant and careful to in&s;truct them in the principles of re|ligion, and in their duty to God and man; and at certain times, and on particular occa&s;ions, &s;e|riou&s;ly addre&s;&s;ed them on the concerns of their &s;ouls, urging their attention to the Bible, to Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, and the way of &s;alvation by him; and to give them&s;elves up to him, to fear and &s;erve him, &amp;c. Her di&s;cour&s;es with them on the&s;e &s;ubjects frequently appeared to make im|pre&s;&s;ions on their minds, and greatly to affect them: And mo&s;t of the many hundreds who were in&s;tructed in her &s;chool, retained a love and e&s;teem for her in the future part of their life, and numbers of them, how many cannot be now known, have never lo&s;t the &s;erious impre&s;|&s;ions, which they received by her in&s;truction and admonitions; but they have i&s;&s;ued in their &s;aving conver&s;ion to God. And we may rea|&s;onably con&s;ider &s;ome of them now in heaven with her, as her glory, and joining with her in mutual joy.</P>
<P>She compo&s;ed and committed to writing a number of particular directions and rules for the children in her &s;chool, pointing out the decent and proper manner of their behavior towards her, and each other in &s;chool, and when going
<PB N="65" REF="035636_0033_1006142296447080">
away and returning; at home and abroad; when in the hou&s;e and by the way; and their manner of &s;peech and behavior towards all with whom they had any connection and concern; which rules were to be often read in &s;chool. The&s;e rules di&s;covered her good judgment and ta&s;te, re&s;pecting the propriety and decency of conduct of children in all &s;ituations, and towards &s;uperi|ors, equals and inferiors, in age and other cir|cum&s;tances. They might be very u&s;eful to teachers of &s;chools and to their pupils, were they tran&s;cribed; and were they not too lengthy to be in&s;erted here.</P>
<P>A FEW months after Mrs. O&s;born began to keep &s;chool the &s;econd time, her only &s;on, Sam|uel Wheaten, died, being near twelve years old, who was an apprentice in the country above twenty miles from Newport, and was a promi&s;|ing youth. She has recorded &s;ome of her ex|erci&s;es under this trial, part of which will be here in&s;erted.</P>
<P>"<HI>Friday morning, September</HI> 22, 1744.&mdash;On Thur&s;day afternoon, the &s;ixth day of this month, I had the &s;orrowful news that my only &s;on was &s;ick unto death. God in his providence pro|vided pre&s;ently for me&mdash;My dear Su&s;a Antho|ny to keep my hou&s;e&mdash;A hor&s;e for my hu&s;band and my&s;elf to ride, and all other things com|fortable. And on my way God gave me &s;uch
<PB N="66" REF="035636_0034_10061424359A4E28">
a &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s to me in a thou&s;and in|&s;tances, that in&s;tead of &s;inking under my &s;orrow, my mind was employed in attention to, and ble&s;&s;ing God for my mercies. Sometimes, that he was not &s;natched from me in a moment, by &s;ome awful accident&mdash;That he was not at &s;o great a di&s;tance, but I might be allowed to go to him, with hopes of finding him yet alive&punc; And tho&s;e precious promi&s;es which in the morn|ing had &s;upported me, &s;till continued as a re|fre&s;hing cordial; even the&s;e.

<P>"On Friday morning we got to Rehoboth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> where I found my &s;on much &s;welled with a drop&s;y, and pined to a mere &s;keleton with the jaundice, &s;curvy and con&s;umption, all combin|ing. He rattled in his throat, like a dying per|&s;on, laboring for every breath. He was given over by the doctors and all friends, who lament|ed him, and did the be&s;t for him in their pow|er, as to the body. But alas! my great con|cern was for that precious jewel, his immortal &s;oul. I endeavored to improve every opportu|nity to di&s;cour&s;e with him, and read to him &s;uch portions of &s;cripture as I thought &s;uitable, with pa&s;&s;ages out of Mr. Allen's Alarm, &amp;c. And I was enabled to pray all the day, by e|jaculatory breathings, and &s;ometimes to plead and wre&s;tle with God on his behalf: Though a|las! God was plea&s;ed to hide his dealings with him altogether. For I could di&s;cern no evi|dence of a work of grace wrought on his &s;oul&punc;
<PB N="67" REF="035636_0034_10061424359A4E28">
for which I did plead from day to day. I did not &s;o much as once, in all his &s;ickne&s;s, pray for his life; but for &s;ome evidence that his &s;oul might live. And for want of this, I &s;ometimes &s;eemed to be cru&s;hed down, having a &s;en&s;e of his doleful ca&s;e, if not reconciled to God. On Thur&s;day, Sept. 13, the day before he died, I was ju&s;t ready to give up, and &s;it down di&s;cour|aged. My heart even almo&s;t died with fear of what would become of him. But ju&s;t in this juncture, God in his providence ordered it &s;o that I received a letter from my dear S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;a, which was a cordial to my drooping &s;pirits.</P>
<P>"In his dying moments I had an awful &s;en&s;e of his deplorable condition, if his naked &s;oul &s;hould launch into a boundle&s;s eternity, without a God to go to. I had al&s;o a view and &s;en&s;e of his and my utter inability to help our&s;elves, and ut|ter unworthine&s;s that God &s;hould help us. And with the woman of Canaan, I cried out, Truth Lord, I am as unworthy as a dog! But I pleaded for the crumbs that fell, one of which would be &s;ufficient for me and mine. I had a clear di&s;covery of the fulne&s;s and &s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t to make &s;atisfaction. I pleaded that he would have mercy, as on the theif on the cro&s;s, then at the eleventh hour; apply but one drop of his precious blood, and it was enough. Thus I was enabled to fill my mouth with arguments, and in bitter agony of &s;oul I wre&s;tled with God for mercy for him. Surely the pangs I then endured for his foul far exceeded tho&s;e that brought him into the world. But as &s;oon as the &s;oul had taken its flight, I was ea&s;ed of my
<PB N="68" REF="035636_0035_10061425ED2E2D68">
burden. I immediately ca&s;t my&s;elf, and my burden too, on God. I adored him as a &s;ove|reign God, and ble&s;&s;ed his name; for he had given, and it was he who had taken. Surely he was better to me than ten &s;ons.</P>
<P>"I then aro&s;e from my dead child, and was quieted, for the will of God was done, and my work was done, as it re&s;pected my child. And God was plea&s;ed to give &s;uch evidence of his love, that my mouth was filled with prai&s;es. But when I looked on the young people who &s;tood round lamenting him, I felt bowels of compa&s;|&s;ion for them, and be&s;ought them to take warn|ing, and make their &s;peedy flight to the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, before &s;ickne&s;s and death overtook them.</P>
<P>"While friends were putting on his grave clothes, I went out into the field and walked, where, with more &s;ecrecy and freedom, I could breathe out my &s;oul to God. And the &s;weet|ne&s;s of that &s;ea&s;on I cannot expre&s;s. God di&s;|covered him&s;elf to be my God, my covenant God, my Father, my Friend, my only portion and happine&s;s, my &s;overeign, my all in all, my infinite fountain of all fulne&s;s. And the&s;e were &s;ome of the breathings of my &s;oul after him. "Lord, I adore thee as my all. I rejoice in thee as my only portion. Lord, if I have thee, I have enough. Though all the &s;treams were cut off; yet the fountain remains; I cannot be poor. Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none on earth I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee.

all things here below, it cannot &s;eparate be|tween thee and me." O, here I rejoiced a|gain, cho&s;e my God again, and again renewed the dedication of my&s;elf to him, my whole &s;oul and body, with all I have, am, or can do. O, his word comforted, his <HI>rod</HI> comforted me. I &s;aw no frown in it: No, but the kind cha&s;ti&s;e|ment of my indulgent Father. This portion of &s;cripture was very &s;weet, "If ye be without cha&s;ti&s;ement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye ba&s;tards, and not &s;ons. For whom the Lord loveth, he cha&s;teneth." Therefore I cried out, "I know, O Lord, thy judgments are right, and in very faithfulne&s;s thou ha&s;t af|flicted me."</P>
<P>"But I mu&s;t cea&s;e.&mdash;For &s;uch ble&s;&s;ed &s;ea|&s;ons are better felt than expre&s;&s;ed. I contin|ued &s;o compo&s;ed and comfortable, that I feared tho&s;e who knew not the cau&s;e would think me void of natural affection; till my tak|ing my la&s;t farewell at his funeral. And then I found the bonds of natural affection very &s;trong; and I wept much. But as I followed to the grave, I pleaded thus with God, "Lord, I adore thee &s;till as my &s;overeign. I do not repine at thy hand. But, dear Lord, pity me, and &s;uffer me to weep under the &s;mart of thy rod; it is my <HI>only &s;on.</HI>" Then I thought on P&s;alm ciii. "As a father pitieth his children, &s;o the Lord pitieth them that fear him." This comforted me. But as I inquired again, if my tears were not &s;inful, and the effect of an un|re&s;igned will, which I dreaded mo&s;t of all, I was comforted again by reflecting, that when
<PB N="70" REF="035636_0036_100614277B28AB28">
Martha and Mary wept for their brother Laza|rus, the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us was not angry, but wept with them. O, then I again adored a &s;ympa|thi&s;ing Savior, a glorious high prie&s;t, who was &s;en&s;ibly touched with the feeling of my infirmi|ties. The&s;e and &s;uch like were the exerci&s;es of my mind, while following and laying my du&s;t into the grave. And ever &s;ince I have been kept compo&s;ed and cheerful.</P>
<P>"The Lord in mercy grant that I may more and more glorify him in this affliction. O that my &s;ins may be more mortified. Lord, grant I may come out of this furnace as gold puri|fied and fitted for my ma&s;ter's u&s;e. If I have behaved in any mea&s;ure as becomes a child of God, and any re&s;ignation has appeared in me, Lord, it is all owing to the riches of thy glori|ous and &s;pecial grace: For had&s;t not thou by that compelled me to act otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould have flew in thy face, murmured, fretted and repined at thee; ca&s;t away all my other com|forts and mercies, and &s;aid I had none left, be|cau&s;e thou had&s;t taken <HI>one</HI> from me. Lord, the&s;e, and more than the&s;e, would have been the effects of my perver&s;e nature. Therefore, not unto me, not unto <HI>me</HI>; but to thy glori|ous name be all the glory forever and ever. Amen."</P>
<P>IN the year 1741, a religious, female &s;oci|ety was formed under the care of Mrs. O&s;born,
<PB N="71" REF="035636_0036_100614277B28AB28">
they having cho&s;en her to be their head. Of which &s;he makes mention in her account of her own life, which has been tran&s;cribed, page 49. This &s;ociety met for &s;ome time twice ev|ery week, viz. on Tue&s;day and Friday even|ings. Afterwards they agreed to meet but once a week, on the afternoon of Wedne&s;day or Thur&s;day. Mrs. O&s;born was continued and con&s;idered the head of this &s;ociety from that time to her decea&s;e, which was above fifty years; and it &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and there are above thirty members of it who are now living. It has con&s;i&s;ted of a much greater number of members. About thirty years ago, above &s;ixty per&s;ons were members of it. But the war, and other evils which have &s;ince that time taken place, have dimini&s;hed it.</P>
<P>This &s;ociety have met con&s;tantly once every week, during this whole time of above half a century, excepting a few interruptions, by &s;ome extraordinary occurrences. They al&s;o have ob&s;erved four whole quarterly days in every year, as days of fa&s;ting and prayer, confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins, and &s;eeking God for &s;piritual ble&s;&s;|ings on them&s;elves, on the church of Chri&s;t, and on all nations. They al&s;o have been wont to &s;pend the afternoon of every fir&s;t Thur&s;day of each month in prayer together; and the afternoon of every Saturday before the monthly admini&s;tration of the Lord's Supper. They have a box, which &s;tands in the room where they meet, into which money is put by each one, as &s;he is able and inclined. And at the end of the year, or any other time, when they
<PB N="72" REF="035636_0037_1006142B1A593188">
think proper, the box is by their con&s;ent open|ed, and the money contained in it counted, and generally given for the &s;upport of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>They did agree upon a number of articles and rules, which were committed to writing, to be ob&s;erved by the &s;ociety and by each indi|vidual, and to be &s;igned by every member, and by every one who &s;hould afterwards be admit|ted. The &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e is as follows:</P>
<P>At the weekly meeting of the &s;ociety, when the appointed hour arrives, and a number are convened, the exerci&s;e &s;hall begin by reading in &s;ome profitable book, till all have come in who are expected. Then a prayer &s;hall be made by one of the members; and after that, a chapter in the Bible &s;hall be read, and relig|ious conver&s;ation be attended to, as time &s;hall allow. The meeting to be concluded by an|other prayer. Four quarterly days in the year, in January, April, July and October, be|ginning on the fir&s;t day of every January, to be ob&s;erved as days of &s;olemn fa&s;ting and prayer. We promi&s;e not to ridicule or divulge the &s;up|po&s;ed or apparent infirmities, of any fellow member; but to keep &s;ecret all things relating to the &s;ociety, the di&s;covery of which might tend to do hurt to the &s;ociety or any individu|al. We re&s;olve to be charitably watchful over each other, to advi&s;e, caution and admoni&s;h, where we judge there is occa&s;ion, and that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may be u&s;eful. And we promi&s;e not to re&s;ent; but kindly and thankfully receive &s;uch friendly advice or reproof from any one of our mem|bers. We will endeavor that our di&s;cour&s;e
<PB N="73" REF="035636_0037_1006142B1A593188">
while together &s;hall be on the &s;erious and im|portant &s;ubjects of religion: And when &s;epa|rate, that our &s;peech and behavior &s;hall be &s;uch as become chri&s;tians, that we may be holy in all conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>If any member commit any &s;candalous &s;in, or walk unruly, and after proper reproof con|tinue manife&s;tly impenitent, &s;he &s;hall be ex|cluded from us, until &s;he give evidence of her repentance. Each one &s;hall pay her propor|tion to defray the nece&s;&s;ary expen&s;es for wood, or any thing el&s;e, unle&s;s excu&s;ed by the &s;oci|ety.</P>
<P>When any per&s;on &s;hall manife&s;t to any one of us a de&s;ire to join the &s;ociety, it &s;hall be mentioned in one of our meetings, that all may have opportunity, who de&s;ire it, to &s;atisfy them|&s;elves, re&s;pecting the character and conver&s;a|tion of the per&s;on offering to join. And if at the meeting on the next week, there be no ob|jection to her being admitted, &s;he may apply to the head of the &s;ociety, who will read our arti|cles to her, and if &s;he is willing, and do &s;ign them, &s;he &s;hall be con&s;idered as a member of the &s;ociety, regularly admitted.</P>
<P>As to any other matters, which we &s;hall here|after find conducive to the benefit and good regulation of our &s;ociety, we engage to leave to the di&s;cretion and deci&s;ion of a major part of us, to who&s;e determination we promi&s;e quietly to agree and &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>This &s;ociety has evidently been of great ad|vantage to many if not all the members of it, to the church and congregation to which mo&s;t
<PB N="74" REF="035636_0038_1006142DA8F89DF0">
of the members have belonged, and to the in|tere&s;t of religion in general, e&s;pecially in New|port, by their prayers, and apparent &s;incerity and engagedne&s;s in religion, and exemplary conduct.</P>
<P>Mrs. O&s;born was by unanimous con&s;ent the head of this &s;ociety above fifty years, as has been ob&s;erved, even from the fir&s;t in&s;titution of it, to the day of her death; and a great part of the time their meetings were attended at her hou&s;e. And &s;he was di&s;tingui&s;hed in her u&s;e|fulne&s;s in this &s;tation and capacity, by her prayers, her conver&s;ation, advice, judgment, prudence and example; by which &s;he was a principal medium of the long and happy ex|i&s;tence and union of the &s;ociety. Her influ|ence apparently reached to every member, and her &s;teady, prudent zeal and activity, and her amiable character, were very much the means of their continuance and edification. The &s;o|ciety continued to meet in the room in which &s;he lived, till her bodily infirmities were &s;o in|crea&s;ed that &s;he was no longer able to &s;u&s;tain their company, and the exerci&s;es of the meet|ing. They then withdrew into another room in her hou&s;e, where &s;he was tenderly remem|bered in their prayers; and &s;he was pre&s;ent in &s;pirit with them, and partook largely with them in their exerci&s;es and enjoyments.</P>
<P>MRS. OSBORN was e&s;teemed as an emi|nently pious, exemplary chri&s;tian, by all who
<PB N="75" REF="035636_0038_1006142DA8F89DF0">
knew her. And even the irreligious and pro|fane had a degree of veneration for her, as a re|markably good woman. Few or none have ob|tained this character more univer&s;ally than &s;he did, among all &s;orts of people, who knew her or heard of her: And not many women had a more numerous acquaintance, or more exten|&s;ive fame. Many educated in her &s;chool were afterwards &s;ettled in di&s;tant parts, and &s;pake in favor of her character and &s;chool to their friends and acquaintance. And as &s;he had a great re&s;pect for the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, &s;he corre&s;ponded with &s;ome of them; and many others vi&s;ited her, agreeable to her incli|nation and de&s;ire, when they came to Newport, as did many other religious per&s;ons. By this, as well as what has been before mentioned, her name and character was &s;pread abroad, as few or none who vi&s;ited her, went away unimpre&s;&s;|ed in her favor, as amiable in her conver&s;ation and behavior, and eminently pious and benev|olent. In conver&s;ation &s;he appeared remarkab|ly mild, plea&s;ant and cheerful, and di&s;covered a mode&s;t, meek, humble, tender and benevo|lent mind, impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;erious, impor|tant and plea&s;ing truths and duties of Chri&s;tian|ity. The law of kindne&s;s was in her tongue to an uncommon degree. She had a &s;trong, habitual aver&s;ion to any thing like a&s;per&s;ing the character of others, being careful to &s;peak evil of none; and when occa&s;ion offered, was di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;ay all that could be &s;aid with truth in favor of the wor&s;t. She was often greatly grieved and rendered very uncomfortable, in
<PB N="76" REF="035636_0039_10061430A36518A0">
companies where &s;lander and detraction took place, and would endeavor, when there was opportunity, to divert the conver&s;ation from topics &s;o di&s;agreeable to her. This part of her character, of which the above is an imperfect &s;ketch, rendered her agreeable, and recom|mended her to the e&s;teem and affection of all religious per&s;ons who were acquainted with her, or heard a true report of her. And this pro|cured to her the general approbation of all, of every denomination and character, as an emi|nently good woman.</P>
<P>IN the years 1766, 1767, there was an un|common attention to religion, which turned the thoughts of many to Mrs. O&s;born. They re|paired to her as a known pious, benevolent chri&s;tian, to whom they could have ea&s;y acce&s;s, that they might enjoy her coun&s;el and prayers. This was the occa&s;ion of numbers re&s;orting to her hou&s;e. When &s;he &s;aw this, and that the number increa&s;ed, &s;he was at a great lo&s;s what to do. She trembled with fear that if &s;he en|couraged their meeting at her hou&s;e, it would be going beyond her &s;phere, offend &s;ome of her chri&s;tian friends, and give occa&s;ion to &s;ome not friendly to religion, to &s;peak evil of her and of religion, and &s;o do much more hurt than good. On the other hand, &s;he was afraid to di&s;cour|age them, and refu&s;e to let them come to her and meet at her hou&s;e, when under apparent concern about their &s;ouls, le&s;t, by this, their at|tention
<PB N="77" REF="035636_0039_10061430A36518A0">
and concern &s;hould abate and cea&s;e. She advi&s;ed with her chri&s;tian friends, and &s;ome mini&s;ters; and upon their advi&s;ing her to en|courage them and attend to them, &s;he granted them liberty to come, and appointed particular times for their coming. The poor Blacks ap|peared more generally concerned and engaged, than others. They agreed to meet at Mrs. O&s;|born's on the evening of the Sabbath. She ad|mitted them, on condition that they &s;hould be|have orderly in coming and retiring, and al|ways break up &s;ea&s;onably, and that tho&s;e who were not free &s;hould not come without the con&s;ent of their ma&s;ters, and that they &s;hould not make any acknowledgment to her by at|tempting any compen&s;ation by pre&s;ents, or any other way; declaring that &s;he would not re|ceive any thing of this kind from them. On the&s;e conditions they convened in great num|bers, commonly to the amount of &s;ixty or eighty, and &s;ome times more. Mrs. O&s;born, finding their attention was &s;o much to her, was greatly cautious, fearing to go beyond her line, as a woman, in endeavoring to promote their in&s;truction and religious impre&s;&s;ions for the good of their &s;ouls. She u&s;ed to &s;elect pa&s;&s;a|ges of &s;cripture, which &s;he thought would be mo&s;t u&s;eful to them, and from other religious books, and read them to them: And when &s;he had opportunity, &s;he would invite &s;ome chri&s;t|ian man to pray with them. She took opportu|nity to conver&s;e with individuals, and &s;ome times would give a word of advice to them all.
<PB N="78" REF="035636_0040_100614324E754370">
And where &s;he could, &s;he obtained &s;ome min|i&s;ter to preach to them, and conver&s;e with them; the pa&s;tor of the church, to which &s;he belonged, not being able to attend.</P>
<P>The&s;e meetings continued a year or more, and were the means of the apparent reformation of many, and of the hopeful conver&s;ion of a num|ber.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Among whom were two in particular, who were &s;laves, but &s;ome years after joined to buy a ticket in a lottery, and drew a prize, by which they both obtained their liberty. Their names were BRISTOL YAMMA, and JOHN QUAMINE. As they were men of good natural a|bilities, and appeared truly pious, and retained the knowledge of the language of the nation from whence they were taken on the gold coa&s;t, it was thought proper to attempt to fit them to be mi&s;&s;ionaries, to en|deavor to &s;pread the go&s;pel among the heathen Africans, their breth|ren, for which they appeared greatly de&s;irous. To promote this de&s;ign a con&s;iderable collection of money was made in New England. And the Society in Scotland for propagating chri&s;tian knowledge, &s;ent mo|ney over, which was laid out on them to fit them for the propo&s;ed mi&s;|&s;ion. But when they were judged to be fit to enter on the mi&s;&s;ion, the war between Great Britain and America came on, which put a &s;top to the de&s;ign. And before the war was over the latter died; and the former not long after fell into an ill &s;tate of health, and died al&s;o. John Quamine was brought from Africa when he was a boy. He &s;aid his father was one of the chief men at Anamabo, and that he &s;ent him by the captain of a Guineaman to America, to be put to &s;chool and in&s;tructed in the learning of this country; which the captain engaged to do: But, contrary to his promi&s;es, he &s;old him a &s;lave for life. Af|ter his freedom was obtained, and he was preparing to go to Africa, a letter was written to a black mi&s;&s;ionary at Cape Coa&s;t Ca&s;tle, informing him of the propo&s;al of &s;ending him with his companion mi&s;&s;ionaries to Africa: And relating the &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;tory which John Quamine told of his father, and the rea&s;on of his being &s;ent to America; and de|&s;iring him to make inquity re&s;pecting the fact, and inform what he &s;hould learn concerning it. The following is an extract of his an&s;wer.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><DATELINE>"CAPE COAST CASTLE,
<DATE>AUGUST 30, 1773.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>&mdash;"It is with great plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction I acquaint you, that my inquiries after the friends and relations of that gentleman have not been fruitle&s;s. The minute account which he has given you of his family and kindred is ju&s;t: For by inquiring, have found his father's name to be the &s;ame as mentioned in your letter; who has been dead many years. His mother's name an&s;wers your de&s;cription; who is &s;till alive; and whom I have had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing. But the bow|els of maternal affection, in truth do I declare, appear to yearn and greatly agitate her, with tears of joy, like that of Jacob's, when he heard that his beloved &s;on Jo&s;eph was yet alive. The joy it kindled on the occa&s;ion, the expectation of &s;eeing once more the fruit of her loins, before &s;he, with her grey hairs go to the grave, fills her with ec|&s;ta&s;ies re&s;embling Jacob's, who in raptures breaks forth, and &s;ays, it is enough! My &s;on is yet alive! I hope, through God's ble&s;&s;ing to &s;ee him before I die. His uncle's name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the &s;ame which you me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion. In &s;hort, every circum&s;tance agrees with the de&s;cription given me in your letter. His uncle, or &s;ome great per&s;onage of his family, who now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es his father's e&s;tate, de&s;ires with importunity that I would ear|ne&s;tly petition you, for his returning to his nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e country as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and promi&s;es that nothing &s;hall be w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing conducive to make him, and all about him happy, and live &s;atisfactorily among his own kindred. The family unanimou&s;ly de&s;ire me to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pre&s;s to you all the thanks they are able to return for your paternal care and affection ex|pre&s;&s;ed towards him."</P>
<P>It may here be added, that the way to this propo&s;ed mi&s;&s;ion yet lies open, and the importance of it, and the encouragement to it, are as great as ever. All that is wanted is money, exertion, and mi&s;&s;ionaries to undertake it. There are religious blacks to be found who under|&s;tand the language of the nations in tho&s;e parts, who might be im|proved, if properly encouraged. And if they were brought to em|brace Chri&s;tianity, and to be civilized, it would put a &s;top to the &s;lave trade and render them happy. And it would open a door for a trade which would be for the temporal intere&s;t of both Americans and Afri|cans. As attention to &s;ending the go&s;pel to the heathen appears to be now &s;preading and increa&s;ing in America, it is hoped that the eyes of many will be opened, to &s;ee the peculiar obligations they are under to attempt to &s;end the go&s;pel to the Africans, whom we have injured and abu&s;ed &s;o greatly, even more than any other people under heaven; it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the be&s;t and the only compen&s;ation we can make.</P>

<P>Not only Blacks; but numbers of other peo|ple met at Mrs. O&s;born's in this time. A num|ber of young men u&s;ed to meet on the &s;ame e|vening with the blacks in a different apart|ment; for prayer, reading and religious con|ver&s;ation. And on Monday evening a number of young women from nine to twenty years old, often above forty or fifty, met together at her hou&s;e, to enjoy her prayers and in&s;tructions. Mrs. O&s;born at fir&s;t was in doubt about the propriety and expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iency of praying with them. But after maturely con&s;idering the matter, and &s;eeking direction, &s;he concluded it was her du|ty, and accordingly practi&s;ed it, and read to them, and gave them that in&s;truction and ad|vice, which &s;he thought proper and important. And they appeared &s;o attentive, and at times &s;ome of them were &s;o impre&s;&s;ed and affected, that &s;he was encouraged to proceed. On Tue&s;day evening a large number of boys met in her room for a con&s;iderable time to receive her in&s;truction and ble&s;&s;ing.

<P>"<HI>Tue&s;day morning, January</HI> 27, 1767.&mdash;O my Lord and my God, appear for my help now, as thou ha&s;t appeared for my help here|tofore. Fain would I rai&s;e a tribute of hum|ble prai&s;e and thank&s;giving for thy conde&s;cen|&s;ion and grace to me in the year pa&s;t; for the Lord him&s;elf has vouch&s;afed to be my protec|tion from errors and confu&s;ions, amid&s;t the throng he has gathered round me. To thee be all the glory forever. In July la&s;t the number had amounted to three hundred &s;ouls. And now the Lord has increa&s;ed it to five hundred and twenty five, who have &s;tatedly re&s;orted here. And yet no evil has followed, though my fears have often been alarmed, with re&s;pect to Lord's day evenings; yet all is quiet, and every company more &s;eriou&s;ly compo&s;ed and &s;ettled in &s;teadily pur&s;uing after knowledge. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, who indulges me with frequent tidings of Blacks and little ones being more concerned, and getting alone to pray.

<P>YESTERDAY very much overcome in God's hou&s;e, at the &s;olemn ordination of the Rev. Mr. Helyer. My heart was then filled with joy and prai&s;es; and God excited and enabled me to breathe out my &s;oul in vehe|ment cries to him for all needful grace, for his &s;ervant, and for his church. Rejoiced much to think I was once more to enjoy the glorious fea&s;t, in&s;tituted by my dear Redeemer. I longed to render a tribute of prai&s;e, and even to be &s;wallowed up with prai&s;es all my life long, becau&s;e God had &s;o graciou&s;ly given me the de&s;ire of my heart. But, alas! how &s;hort liv|ed are my prai&s;es. All this day, with bodily indi&s;po&s;ition and my own declining heart, I have been as water heated, returning to my former coldne&s;s again.

<P><HI>Sabbath noon, July</HI> 15.&mdash;Ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul, and forget not all his benefits. I have been to the table of the Lord, and he brought me into his banqueting hou&s;e, and his banner over me was love. I &s;at under his &s;hadow with great delight, and his fruit was &s;weet to my ta&s;te. My &s;oul &s;aid, It is good for me to be here. I was enabled, with all my powers engaged, to renew my dedication of my&s;elf to God, and rejoice in my choice of him. I was, in a mea&s;ure, brought to behold his glory in the perfections of his nature. I was enabled to wre&s;tle with him for victory over my &s;ins, and to be made more holy. The&s;e &s;eemed to be my chief errands; and as I was pleading that promi&s;e, "They that have clean hands &s;hall grow &s;tronger and &s;tronger," this promi&s;e &s;eemed to be whi&s;pered, I will &s;trengthen thee,

I will uphold thee by the right hand of my righteou&s;ne&s;s; and &s;in &s;hall not have dominion over thee.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From Mrs. O&s;born's manner of expre&s;&s;ion here, and in a number of other places, &s;ome may &s;u&s;pect that &s;he thought promi&s;es were made to her by &s;ome particular, immediate revelation, or divine im|pul&s;e, by which &s;he was a&s;&s;ured that they were then applied to her, which would be a high degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m. The truth appears to be this: She had a fixed belief and confidence, that &s;he was a believer in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and con&s;equently intere&s;ted in all the promi&s;es con|tained in the covenant of grace, and in the whole word of God, whether made to the church collectively, or to individuals, as the &s;er|vants of God, or chri&s;tians. Therefore, when her mind was quickened and turned to &s;ome promi&s;e, or any number of promi&s;es in the word of God; and influenced to a &s;trong belief and affecting &s;en&s;e of the good things contained in them, and of the truth, reality, and excel|lence of them, &s;he con&s;idered them as made or belonging to her: And could not THEN doubt of it, as the evidence that &s;he was a real chri&s;t|ian would be clear and irre&s;i&s;tible to her own mind, in proportion to her lively view and &s;en&s;e of Chri&s;t, and the good things contained in the promi&s;es. In this way &s;he con&s;idered the promi&s;es to be applied to her by the Spirit of God, as he was the author of that &s;piritual &s;en&s;e and di&s;cerning, by which the promi&s;es were brought into her view, and &s;he was led with &s;trong faith and affection to embrace them. And this every chri&s;tian has a warrant to do. See Heb. xiii.5. compared with Jo&s;h. i.5.</NOTE></P>

Why ha&s;t thou given thy&s;elf for me!" His blood was &s;weet to me, as it was &s;hed for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. At la&s;t I broke out in a rapture, "I found the pearl of great|e&s;t price, my heart doth &s;ing for joy." I longed to get &s;till nearer, while I &s;eemed to be re&s;ting and leaning on my beloved. Surely I did find him whom my &s;oul loveth. O a&s;toni&s;hing, all conquering grace! O happy earne&s;t of more near and intimate communion! O what a fea&s;t is this!

<P>Mr. Nathaniel Clap was born at Dorche&s;ter, near Bo&s;ton, A. D. 1667. He had his public education <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Harvard College in Cam|bridge.

<P>He was the father of the congregational intere&s;t in Newport. When he fir&s;t began to preach there, he had but a &s;mall number of heare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who had no hou&s;e for public wor&s;hip. His congregation &s;oon in|crea&s;ed in number and re&s;pectability. But he continued there twenty five years before a &s;ufficient number appeared qualified and di&s;po&s;ed to unite in forming into a chri&s;tian church.

<P>Mr. Clap was univer&s;ally re&s;pected, as a man of eminent play. Mr. Callender, who preached his funeral &s;ermon, &s;ays, "The man &s;troke in his character, was his EMINENT SANCTITY and PI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">TY, and AN ARDENT DESIRE to promote the knowledge and practice of true godline&s;s in others."

<P>When the infirmities of old age increa&s;ed upon him, the church and congregation invited Mr. Jonathan Helyer to &s;ettle colleag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with Mr. Clap.

my &s;pirits till afternoon. But then the children grew &s;o unruly, and I &s;o weary and di&s;compo&s;|ed, I knew not what to do with my&s;elf.

<P>Lord, forbid I &s;hould ever re&s;t &s;atisfied with the bare external performance of duty. No. It is the God of ordinances I want to find.

<P>Lord, this were indeed too great a mercy for &s;uch a worthle&s;s worm to a&s;k, had&s;t not thou, for the &s;ake of a glorious Mediator, en|couraged, yea, commanded me to a&s;k: And ha&s;t told me, by his own mouth, "How much more thou wilt give thy Holy Spirit to them who a&s;k him." Yea, this Spirit Chri&s;t hath died to purcha&s;e. This is the Comforter. This is he who is come to guide his people into all nece&s;&s;ary truth; to reduce them, when they wander; to quicken them, when they are dull; to help their infirmities, when they know not what to pray for as they ought: Yea, to make interce&s;&s;ion in them, with groanings which can|not be uttered; and to fill them with all grace and joy in believing. This is the Spirit who&s;e

<P><HI>Sabbath day, April</HI> 1.&mdash;I have now enjoyed my room for retirement one week. And O, has it not been a &s;weet week to me!

<P>And, Lord, &s;ince grace is thus ab&s;olutely free and &s;overeign, and increa&s;e of grace is at|tainable for tho&s;e who have the principle, who are believers in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and per&s;ever|ance to the end is certain, I fly to thee, in the name of Je&s;us, and renew my reque&s;t for increa&s;e of grace, and per&s;everance too.

<P><HI>Tue&s;day morning, May</HI> 15.&mdash;On Saturday evening, Sabbath morning and evening, and ye&s;terday morning, I have been much refre&s;h|ed in writing on death and judgment. I find, by examination, &s;till good ground to hope, through riches of grace, that the great Judge of quick and dead is, in very deed, my ever|la&s;ting friend; and therefore never will di&s;own me; never will &s;ay, I know you not, depart from me: But, on the contrary, will &s;ay, Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you before the foundation of the world: For I have paid the ran&s;om for you; I have redeemed you with the price of my precious blood. I effectually called you in time, and enabled you by faith to embrace me, on my own terms. I made you &s;incere, from the day I called you, though you were then very imperfect.</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> was then &s;anctified but in part. You groaned under a body of &s;in and death, which cau&s;ed you to wander from me, wound your own &s;oul, and grieve my ble&s;&s;ed Spirit. But I kept thee by the bonds of the everla&s;ting cov|enant, and by my mighty power, through faith unto &s;alvation. And, for my &s;ake all thy poor imperfect performances, and &s;incere endeavors to &s;erve me were accepted. I pitied and &s;uc|cored thee then. I had a feeling of thy infirmi|ties. I remembered thy frame, that thou
<PB N="124" REF="035636_0063_1006146B78965400">
wa&s;t but du&s;t. I heard all thy groanings, be|cau&s;e of thy &s;piritual enemies, thy inbred lu&s;ts and corruptions, as well as Satan and the world, which held thee at a di&s;tance from me, when thou wa&s;t in that vale of tears. I beheld all thy thir&s;tings and longings after me and my grace, univer&s;al obedience and perfection in holine&s;s. It was I that excited and &s;trengthened them. I encouraged and &s;trengthened thy faith, when thou did&s;t cleave to me, and would not let me go. I cau&s;ed thee to delight in me, a|bove all other objects. I di&s;covered &s;ome|thing of my excellencies to thee then, which cau&s;ed thee to be enamored with my beauty; but thou &s;awe&s;t only through a gla&s;s darkly.</P>
<P>But now, behold, the vail is rent from top to bottom. I will never any more hide my face from thee. Come, all thy de&s;ires are fulfilled; all thy imperfections are done away; and, ac|cording to thy wi&s;h, thou art made perfect in holine&s;s. Thou &s;halt never find any more wearine&s;s in my &s;ervice. And thou maye&s;t now with open face behold me, con&s;tantly look on my perfections, &s;ee my glory, and the lu&s;tre of it &s;hall not confound thee. Come, here is the open vi&s;ion, the full fruition thou did&s;t long for. Come, drink in as much of God now, as thy finite capacity can hold; and I will &s;till enlarge thy capacity: Thou &s;halt pa&s;s from glo|ry to glory; and be more and more transform|ed into the &s;ame image. Come, drink and &s;wim, and drink again of tho&s;e rivers of plea|&s;ure, which flow from the right hand of God forevermore. Here is the boundle&s;s ocean, in
<PB N="125" REF="035636_0063_1006146B78965400">
which thou maye&s;t dive throughout the end|le&s;s ages of eternity, and thy delights &s;hall be forever new.</P>
<P>Come, &s;earch into the wonders of redeeming love and grace, which has brought &s;o many of the apo&s;tate &s;ons and daughters of Adam to glory: And now, in this everla&s;ting <HI>now,</HI> give to God the glory of his &s;overeign grace. Come, tune thy harp, and &s;ound upon the highe&s;t &s;tring. Shout aloud for joy; for he has given grace and glory too. Here is no danger of o&s;tentation or &s;piritual pride; or of grieving any of the inhabitants of this upper world. No, they will all join with thee, and each for him|&s;elf, and on thy behalf, give glory to God, in the highe&s;t &s;trains. Did&s;t thou long to be thus employed? Well, go on forever to prai&s;e and adore the glorious Three One. Did&s;t thou delight to commune with me in providences, as well as in ordinances? Well, thou maye&s;t now learn the my&s;teries of them: They &s;hall be unfold|ed. Unbelief &s;hall no more mole&s;t thee. Now thou &s;halt &s;ee how by the watchful eye of my prov|idence, I pre&s;erved thee from every danger. How I &s;wayed the &s;ceptre in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and cau&s;ed all things to work together for thy good; even when thou &s;aid&s;t, All the&s;e things are again&s;t me! I never took my eye from thee; nor turned away from doing thee good. Now, thou maye&s;t adore forever, on this account al|&s;o; and &s;ee what thou did&s;t, when thou did&s;t commit all thy concerns to me, for time and eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="035636_0064_1006146E32F82050">Did&s;t thou delight in the company and com|munion of my amba&s;&s;adors, and dear children? Did they appear the mo&s;t lovely and agreeable of all the inhabitants of the lower world? E&s;|pecially, when thou did&s;t di&s;cern, through their imperfections, as the &s;un through a cloud, my image, drawn in an eminent degree upon their &s;ouls. Did&s;t thou love them for my &s;ake, where|ever thou &s;awe&s;t them? Were they, in thy e&s;|teem, indeed the excellent of the earth? Well, here thou &s;halt forever enjoy the communion of &s;aints: The&s;e &s;hall be thy companions for|ever. All their imperfections, as well as thine, are done away. They are now perfect, and &s;hall never en&s;nare thee, as even <HI>they</HI> were wont to do. They &s;hall never turn off thy eyes from me. No, not the brighte&s;t &s;eraph in all the heavenly regions, &s;hall ever be able to do it: Nor all the glittering robes of glorified &s;aints and angels. But thou &s;halt enjoy me in all the&s;e. I will forever fea&s;t thy &s;oul with communications from my&s;elf. And if I, who am God all&s;ufficient, can make thee happy, thou &s;halt be &s;o; for I will be thy portion to eternity.</P>
<P>And did&s;t thou in time, by faith, commit the keeping of thy &s;oul and body into my merciful and faithful hands, again&s;t this great day? I ex|cited and enabled thee to do it: And now thou &s;ee&s;t the effect. Thy expectations from me, &s;hall never be di&s;appointed; neither &s;halt thou ever be a&s;hamed of thy hope. I kept thee by my power, while on earth. I kept thee in the hour of death, when Satan would gladly have
<PB N="127" REF="035636_0064_1006146E32F82050">
hurled thy &s;oul into the infernal regions; but he could not pluck thee out of my hands. I &s;ent thy guardian angels to conduct thy pre|cious &s;oul to Abraham's bo&s;om. And I &s;till took care of thy mouldering du&s;t, while in the grave; not an atom of it is lo&s;t. And now, be|hold! I have rai&s;ed it a glorious body, fa&s;hion|ed like my own. And now the union between &s;oul and body &s;hall never be di&s;&s;olved; but the dear partner &s;hall forever reap together, as they &s;owed together. Behold, according to thy faith and hope, I now pre&s;ent them &s;potle&s;s and blamele&s;s before the throne of God. I have redeemed them by my blood. By my obedience and death I have &s;atisfied ju&s;tice, and have purcha&s;ed reconciliation with God. Mercy and truth have met together; righteou&s;|ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other. I have wa&s;hed away all thy pollutions. And now, I give thee joy; and all the ho&s;t of heaven give thee joy; therefore enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. I gave thee joy in the day of thy e&s;pou&s;als, and in frequent after manife&s;tations, as an earne&s;t of this. Thou ha&s;t had a ta&s;te of the &s;ame in kind, when I revealed my&s;elf to thee on earth; but the degree &s;hall now be greater than thou coulde&s;t then a&s;k or think.</P>

Perhaps, a ta&s;te to &s;trengthen
<PB N="128" REF="035636_0065_1006146FECF46C40">
thy faith to thy journey's end. Be exceeding thankful for &s;uch views of un&s;een and eternal things. Keep the eye of faith &s;till fixed upon them, and run with patience the race &s;et before thee; looking and longing for the glorious ap|pearance of the great God, even our Lord and Savior Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And now, in a &s;pecial manner, watch and pray, le&s;t thou enter into temptation. And remember, it is by grace thou &s;tande&s;t. O, be not high minded, but fear before a holy and &s;in hating God; for the glorious things thou ha&s;t &s;een, by an eye of faith, are not yet accompli&s;hed. Rejoice in hope of the glory of God, and &s;tedfa&s;tly believe that in his own time, all the&s;e things will be revealed; and therefore march forward in his &s;trength towards the joyful period.</P>
<P>But take heed of boa&s;ting, as though thou had&s;t already put off the harne&s;s; for perhaps thou maye&s;t be but girding it on. Thou art yet in thy enemies' country. Snares await thee on every &s;ide. Thou art not out of the reach of &s;piritual pride, or vain glory: Nor out of the reach of unbelief, which may yet rai&s;e many black clouds, before thou reach the bli&s;sful re|gions. Nor ha&s;t thou yet got clear of &s;loth and carnal &s;ecurity. Nay, all the lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, which now &s;eem to be in &s;ome good degree conquered, may yet ri&s;e up again&s;t thee. There may yet be &s;ore conflicts in this field of battle: And though they &s;hall not finally overcome, they may &s;adly wound thee, and di&s;honor God. Again, my &s;oul, thou art not yet out of the reach of Satan, who has often de&s;ired to have
<PB N="129" REF="035636_0065_1006146FECF46C40">
thee, that he might &s;ift thee as wheat. Many a fiery dart may he yet throw at thee, many griev|ous injections: For though the hou&s;e is built upon the rock Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and therefore &s;hall not fall: Yet the rain may de&s;cend, the floods come, the winds blow, and beat upon it; and thou ha&s;t no rea&s;on to expect any other.</P>
<P>Therefore, I &s;ay again, watch and pray, le&s;t thou enter into temptation. And beware le&s;t &s;elf confidence &s;hould betray thee; or any of the troubles or amu&s;ements of a vain world. O take heed of hewing out any more broken ci&s;terns; for they can hold no water. Not all the creatures upon earth, nor all created things, can ever yield thee, my &s;oul, that &s;atisfaction thou ha&s;t already found in God, that &s;pring and fountain of all felicity. Therefore turn not to the creature; but maintain thy re&s;olution to remain comfortle&s;s, except he comfort thee with communications from him&s;elf. Let nothing le&s;s &s;atisfy thee. Thou wa&s;t made to glorify and enjoy him even here. Thou art not obliged to wait till death has done its work: No, even now thou maye&s;t anticipate that joy, if thou art not wanting to thy&s;elf.</P>
<P>And I charge thee, my &s;oul, harbor no di&s;|tru&s;ts of his grace. Remember this has been thy prevailing infirmity. Therefore watch a|gain&s;t this thy own iniquity. It is &s;aid of Chri&s;t; that he did not many mighty works, in his own country, <HI>becau&s;e of their unbelief.</HI> Let this therefore be laid a&s;ide; and let faith be daily upon the &s;cout, &s;ending it forth continually to Chri&s;t for fre&s;h &s;upplies of grace and &s;trength,
<PB N="130" REF="035636_0066_100614718C563018">
and all &s;hall be well. For he is the head of all gracious influences. He has an immen&s;e &s;tock to give out, an inexhau&s;tible fulne&s;s for his poor, needy creatures. And who can tell but he may have yet far greater degrees of grace to be&s;tow on thee? Even &s;trengthening, quickening and &s;anctifying grace; for he is thy &s;anctification as well as redemption. Who can tell but I &s;hall be much more conformed to his ble&s;&s;ed image, even here? Though perfection in holine&s;s is not to be obtained in this life; yet grace is ab&s;olutely free and &s;overeign. Some have been made eminent patterns of pie|ty, though in them&s;elves unworthy, as well as I. Some lights have &s;o &s;hined, that others &s;eeing their good works, have glorified their Father who is in heaven. O my God, unworthy wretch as I am, yet glorify thy&s;elf in me al&s;o.

This I bewailed, and that I have been a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or from the womb; an ungrateful abu&s;er of divine mercy. But Chri&s;t Je&s;us appeared &s;o glorious and lovely in his prie&s;tly office, that my &s;oul was tran&s;ported with joy: His obedience and his blood; his glorious re&s;urrection and &s;e&s;&s;ion at his Father's right hand; his being touched with the feeling of my infirmities. My &s;oul flew to him, and embraced him, as my great High Prie&s;t, my great Advocate in the court of heaven: Plead|ed for ju&s;tification, a free and full pardon, for his &s;ake alone. A view &s;till of the great power and tyranny of &s;in, Satan and the world, to draw off my heart from God. Renewed my choice of Chri&s;t, as my ab&s;olute &s;overeign, my Prince, as well as Savior: Committed my precious &s;oul again into his merciful and faithful hands.

What wi&s;e and ble&s;&s;ed &s;teps hath he taken, though once afflic|tive. When in my young and tender years, my heart was much &s;et on the hu&s;band of my youth, he rent him from me, and likewi&s;e be|reaved me of almo&s;t all that was dear to me according to the fle&s;h, whereby he broke off my dependence on tho&s;e &s;treams for comfort, and led me to the fountain. O, "happy rod, that brought me nearer to my God." He hath abundantly made up to me, in him&s;elf, and in his Chri&s;t, the lo&s;s of all the&s;e. But, alas, &s;till the world, its plea&s;ures, profits and cares, threatened to engro&s;s and entangle my affec|tions.

Dear Je&s;us, keep my frame of mind, as well as my &s;oul, in thine own hands. I commit this to thy charge. I can no more keep my frame good my&s;elf, than I can keep my &s;oul eternally &s;ecure my|&s;elf. I look to thee for a Godlike, Chri&s;tlike temper of mind.

O keep me in &s;uch a frame as much and as con&s;tantly here below, as is con&s;i&s;tent with a mortal &s;tate. Sure this is becoming a chri&s;tian: Sure thou wilt be glorified by this. O glori|ous, incomprehen&s;ible Trinity, glorify thy&s;elf in me, for thy own name's &s;ake; becau&s;e the world believes thou art my God; and therefore expects I will behave accordingly. O help me

in all re&s;pects, that glory may redound to thy great name by me, for Je&s;us' &s;ake.</P>
<P>And let all thy dear children &s;hare with me in this happy, this glorious privilege of glorify|ing God. O let us join heart and hand. O unite us in the &s;acred work. Let a &s;acred glow of love and gratitude to God and each other ever in&s;pire our brea&s;ts. Let the world know the difference between tho&s;e who have been with Je&s;us, and tho&s;e who have not, by our love and delight in each other, as well as love and delight in God.

he was, hovering ju&s;t on the brink of E|ternity, and ready to launch into it in a mo|ment. And God gave me a deep &s;en&s;e of the worth of his precious &s;oul; of his utter inability to help him&s;elf.&mdash;Of his utter unworthine&s;s to receive mercy, and mine, or ours, earne&s;tly to apply to the throne of grace in his behalf: But pleaded encouragements from our being jointly engaged for mercy for him, and I tru&s;t we really were &s;o throughout the room. I ble&s;s God, who gave &s;uch a number of us op|portunity to unite, and implore mercy for him, and commit him into the hands of a glorious Chri&s;t, to be clothed with the all glorious and &s;potle&s;s robe of his righteou&s;ne&s;s; in which he might lift up his head before &s;trict and impar|tial ju&s;tice, before the bar of a holy God.

And I humbly tru&s;t my &s;en&s;ible view both of the worth of his &s;oul&mdash;his undone &s;tate without Chri&s;t&mdash;his unworthine&s;s to re|ceive, or mine to implore mercy&mdash;the ful|ne&s;s and &s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t for him, as well as for Jeru&s;alem &s;inners who had imbrued their hands in his own precious blood&mdash;and the glory that would redound to God, both in heaven and on earth, in the &s;alvation of this &s;oul&mdash;was from God; that tho&s;e di&s;coveries were from him, and the de&s;ires were excited by his own Spirit. It was he who emboldened me, who am but du&s;t and a&s;hes, thus to draw near,

And I believe it was Satan who &s;ugge&s;ted to me, that my de&s;ires were not excited by the Spirit of God; for he was not then the &s;ubject of prayer; and therefore my prayer was lo&s;t; for God never a&s;&s;i&s;ted any to pray for the dead.&mdash;It gave my &s;pirits a con&s;iderable damp: For I verily thought that God by his Spirit had held me up to wre&s;tle with him, and given me &s;uch boldne&s;s and freedom of acce&s;s; and even &s;trong confidence that God would hear and an|&s;wer for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. And if he was dead at that very time, I knew not what to make of it! Still I could not help thinking God was with me of a truth in that prayer. I therefore went down to the hou&s;e, and inquired, at what time he died? And his &s;i&s;ter told me, Ju&s;t at nine. &mdash;And God did help me: And he &s;hall have all the glory, while I rejoice in hope that he is glorified in heaven, for the &s;alvation of that &s;oul.&mdash;And now, my God, lay me in the du&s;t. &mdash;And comfort the near and dear relations, and all to whom he was dear.

du&s;t and bewail before God all our hypocri&s;y, all our formality and covetou&s;ne&s;s, which is idolatry. Lord, humble us all this day, and make us upright before thee, and grant us that wi&s;dom which is from above. O help us not only to confe&s;s, but to for&s;ake &s;in this day. Lord God, pour out thy Spirit upon us, a &s;pir|it of humiliation, prayer and &s;upplication. O that thou woulde&s;t rend the heavens, and come down, and cau&s;e all mountains that ri&s;e in our way of acce&s;s and conformity to thee, to flow down at thy pre&s;ence. O excite our cries for thy church univer&s;al; for all the world of &s;in|ners; for thy mini&s;ters every where; for our mini&s;ter and church in particular. Lord, have mercy upon us, and yet revive us, for Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake. And let us, thy poor, unworthy handmaids, yet rejoice in thy &s;alvation.</P>
<P>And &s;till permit me to feed thy lambs, and devote my whole life to the &s;ervice of my God. In the Beloved let me be accepted: And thus let all thine be accepted. O be in the mid&s;t of us this day! Say me not nay; but come and &s;anctify us throughout. O make us holy, as God is holy.</P>

<P><HI>Saturday morning, November</HI> 8.&mdash;Lord, I be|&s;eech thee, &s;how me yet more and more of my own vilene&s;s, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of my vile pride. Shew me thy purity, and how far I am from being pure in thy &s;ight. Shew me, Lord, how every thing I do is tainted with &s;in, all polluted, all deficiency; and imperfections mix|ed every where. Turn to what duty I will, and I find it there, whether &s;ecret duties, public

private, &s;ocial or relative. I have nothing to plead before God: I cannot be clean in his fight. I fly from all, to the blood and right|eou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t; and there I will &s;tand and lift up my head, not only at the throne of grace; but even at the bar of God. There I can look death, judgment and long eternity in the face without amazement; yea, with joy and tran&s;port.</P>
<P>O ble&s;&s;ed be God for the great, the glorious atonement, made by the precious blood of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t for all the &s;ins that have attended my holy things! And for the &s;ake of the great a|tonement alone, they &s;hall be accepted, yea, meet with reward of grace, notwith&s;tanding all that Satan can &s;ay. The Lord rebuke thee, Satan. I adore the grace which has enabled me, vile as I am, to feed the hungry and clothe the naked, de&s;titute, fatherle&s;s ones&mdash;to labor to &s;upport the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and to refre&s;h occa&s;ionally his dear mini&s;ters and chil|dren. And I will plead for acceptance for his own name's &s;ake: For he has told me, A cup of cold water &s;hall be accepted; and tho&s;e who give it in the name of a di&s;ciple or a prophet, &s;hall not lo&s;e their reward. And I will hope in the mercy and free grace of God for accept|ance of my poor labors of love, in educating the poor, from year to year; that I have been able to &s;ay, Silver and gold have I none; but &s;uch as I have give I thee. And the Lord &s;eal in&s;truction, and make tho&s;e I have in&s;tructed a godly &s;eed to &s;erve the Lord, and in&s;truments

<P>The Lord rebuke thee, Satan; for by the grace of God I am what I am; not &s;uch a u&s;e|le&s;s creature as thou do&s;t in&s;inuate, though de|filed. Ble&s;&s;ed be God for the te&s;timony of my con&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity I have had my conver&s;ation in this world renouncing evil, hating covetou&s;ne&s;s, pride and unbelief; hating murmurings, di&s;|contents, di&s;tru&s;ts of providence and grace; hating deceit, guile, &s;loth and hypocri&s;y; yea, hating and groaning under the whole body of &s;in, and contrariety to God and his holy, pre|cious law: And I do delight in it, after the in|ward man, and long for conformity to it; yea, perfect conformity. And in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t I am complete; though not in my own; I own it to be imperfect and defiled; yet in the Beloved I am accepted: And, God helping me, I will cling there, and with Job I will hold my integrity, till I die. I am not wholly a hypocrite, though tainted with hypoc|ri&s;y. The Lord rebuke thee, Satan, and in his own time deliver me from thee. And he will do it: For he has &s;aid, I will never leave thee, nor for&s;ake thee. And he never will. O now let me boldly &s;ay, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear. O my God, help me! All my &s;ufficiency is of thee. Make me humble and make me thankful; for I am thine forever.</P>

O Lord, thou knowe&s;t they will, through the malice of Satan, di&s;honor thee more than ever; be more aver&s;e to the ways and people of God than ever, except thou do&s;t turn them about by almighty power. Lord, is thy hand &s;hortened that it cannot &s;ave? Are even the children of Rhodei&s;land out of the reach of &s;overeign grace? Shall goodly appear|ances all wear off and come to nought? O that thou woulde&s;t rend the heavens, and come down, and cau&s;e all mountains to &s;low down at thy pre&s;ence! Thou can&s;t &s;top the&s;e poor young creatures, in their mad career.

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, April</HI> 23.&mdash;It has plea&s;ed a righteous, holy, and good God, to lay his hand on me from Saturday afternoon; &s;o that I have been unable to attend on either the black peo|ple, young women, lads, or &s;chool. Have kept my chamber from Lord's day; attended with an ague in my face, much &s;woln, a fever, &amp;c. And, ble&s;&s;ed be God, a &s;weet content, a re&s;igned will; &s;ome little glimp&s;e of hope that I might po&s;&s;ibly go home. A &s;weet &s;atisfaction in a &s;ettled belief, that, however poor, &s;hort|&s;ighted, ignorant mortals may, through frailty, have &s;et their eyes too much on a worthle&s;s worm, God &s;tands in no need of me. What|ever infinite love and wi&s;dom has devi&s;ed, in|finite power will effect. I cannot cau&s;e a &s;in|gle word to do good to any one; but God can do his own work by whom he will. Ble&s;&s;ed be his name, that does not depend on &s;o &s;len|der a thing as my poor, feeble frame. Though that were di&s;&s;olved, the Lord yet lives. Let this comfort me, and all my dear friends; and re&s;ign us all to thy holy will.</P>
<P>But, Lord, if it be thy plea&s;ure to continue me in life, thy will be done. Then, even here do what thou wilt with me: Only glorify thy|&s;elf in me; only make the path of duty plain to me, and I will, by grace, go in it. Whether thou do&s;t call me to active or pa&s;&s;ive obedi|ence, thy will be done. If the Lord hath no

more for me to do, who am I, that I &s;hould contend! If it be his plea&s;ure, I &s;hould yet &s;erve him, and my generation according to his will, he will bring me back, re&s;tore health of body, and fortitude of mind, again&s;t Satan's wiles. He will kindle my love to him and his cau&s;e afre&s;h. He will of his own &s;overeign grace, grant me warmer zeal to run the heav|enly road: For he is a faithful God. And he will clothe me with that humility, which &s;hall, of his infinite grace, prevent his work being marred in my worthle&s;s hands. And glory &s;hall redound to Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, through the thank&s;givings of many, on my be|half.</P>
<P>And now I determine, by grace, cheerfully to go forth to the work, to which God &s;hall call me this day and evening, &s;o far as God, with &s;trength of body, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Spirit, permit. Thou knowe&s;t that without thee I can do nothing. Only help me, Lord, and I will neither flinch nor fear; but work till I die.</P>

<P>MY glorious Lord, do&s;t thou inquire, Whom do men &s;ay that I, <MILESTONE N="14"> the Son of man am? There are indeed various opinions of thee this day. <MILESTONE N="15"> Some believe thee to be only as a great prophet, who did not exi&s;t till time began, <MILESTONE N="16"> &amp;c.

<P>Let me hear thee pronounce the ble&s;&s;ing on me; <MILESTONE N="17"> for fle&s;h and blood did not reveal this to me; but thy Father who is in heaven, by his Spirit, for the &s;alvation of my poor &s;oul.</P>
<P>And on thee, as an eternal rock, are all my hopes of &s;afety forever built: <MILESTONE N="18"> And I do be|lieve the gates of hell &s;hall not finally pre|vail again&s;t me, after ten thou&s;and attempts to overthrow my faith, yet this rock is my defence.</P>
<P>I humbly ble&s;s thee for a&s;&s;urance from thy word, <MILESTONE N="19"> that what thy Peter and other apo&s;|tles by their writings bound on earth, is bound in heaven; and what they have loo&s;ed on earth, is loo&s;ed in heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="035636_0173_1006156767AC6EE0"> <MILESTONE N="20"> Is it thy will that I &s;hould keep &s;ecret the di&s;coveries thou make&s;t to me of thy&s;elf? Then &s;how it to me clearly.

<P> <MILESTONE N="21"> My dear Redeemer, &s;ince thou ha&s;t &s;uf|fered, according to thy word, let me never be offended in a crucified Je&s;us, <MILESTONE N="22"> or any doctrines of his cro&s;s; or &s;ufferings to be endured for thy &s;ake. <MILESTONE N="23"> Lord, let me never favor the things that be of men; fle&s;h plea&s;|ing things; and hereby merit thy &s;harp re|bukes: But teach me to acquie&s;ce in all the will of God; all that is brought to pa&s;s by the determinate coun&s;el and foreknowledge of God, however contrary to fle&s;h and blood. Lord, teach me effectually, to believe at all times, that infinite wi&s;dom knows be&s;t what is mo&s;t for his own glory, and does all things well.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="24"> And in whatever thou art plea&s;ed to call me to &s;elfdenial, I pray thee, grant me &s;trength from heaven, that in every thing, without re&s;erve, <MILESTONE N="25"> I may cheerfully take up my cro&s;s, and follow thee, never attempting to &s;ave my life in a &s;inful way; but joyfully lo&s;e it, rather than &s;in again&s;t thee, lo&s;e thee, and lo&s;e my own &s;oul.

<P> <MILESTONE N="8"> It will be in vain to a&s;k wi&s;e virgins for part of their oil. Poor hearts!

Say to me, I know thee by name, and will not reject thee. I will, in no wife, ca&s;t thee out.</P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="13"> But O, let not me, nor any of thine, re&s;t &s;ecure in pa&s;t attainments, but all watch. For we know not the day, nor the hour where|in the Son of man cometh, <MILESTONE N="14"> to call to an ac|count tho&s;e to whom he has committed his goods.

<P>True, hateful pride is ready to ri&s;e and rob God of his glory, in every attempt to improve my talent. But &s;hall I, to prevent that, run to the other extreme, and hide my Lord's money? Is not his grace &s;ufficient for me? O my God, guide, direct and protect me, even me. He

who had five talents, did improve; he who had two, did improve. It was by thy grace they did &s;o. Say to me, even to me, My grace is &s;uf|ficient for thee, and I will endeavor to improve al&s;o.

<HEAD>PART IV. The Conclu&s;ion of her Life.</HEAD>
<P>THE bodily infirmities of Mrs. O&s;born increa&s;ed &s;o much; and her eye&s;ight failed to &s;uch a degree for above twenty years of the la&s;t part of her life, and her whole bodily frame was &s;o weakened and worn out, that &s;he was obliged to give up her &s;chool, and was not able to do any thing to &s;upport her&s;elf. And as &s;he had nothing laid up to live upon, &s;he was wholly dependent on Divine Providence and her friends for daily &s;upplies, during the whole of this time; and was, the greate&s;t part of it, confined to her room. This was in many re&s;|pects the happie&s;t part of her life. She was free from worldly anxiety and care. She en|joyed a calmne&s;s and &s;erenity of mind, the at|tendant of re&s;ignation to God, and humble tru&s;t and confidence in him, contented with the al|lotments of Divine Providence, &s;eeing the hand of God in every thing which took place&mdash;con|&s;tantly thankful to him for the mercies &s;he was daily and every hour receiving&mdash;full of grati|tude to tho&s;e whom God inclined to &s;how kindne&s;s to her&mdash;&s;pending the chief of her time and &s;trength in devotion, in contemplating the divine perfections manife&s;ted in his works of

creation and providence, and in his word&mdash;a|doring and prai&s;ing the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, praying to him for the church and the world; for her acquaintance, relations, friends, benefactors, and for her&s;elf; with con&s;tant, humble confe&s;&s;ion of unworthine&s;s, aggravated &s;ins, and depravity of heart, making the daily occurrences re&s;pecting her&s;elf, and others, the matter of prayer and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>She enjoyed an almo&s;t uninterrupted a&s;&s;ur|ance of her intere&s;t in the divine favor through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and longed to be perfectly holy. The thought of dying was plea&s;ing to her: And when any particular di&s;order, or pain of body, came upon her, which &s;eemed to indicate a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution, it would commonly give a &s;pring to her mind and excite plea&s;ure and joy. Thus &s;he appeared in this la&s;t part of her life in a mea&s;ure to enjoy the happy con&s;equence and reward, of the &s;ore trials, labors and conflicts, through which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed in former years. Something of which the reader has &s;een in that part of her diary which has been tran&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Mrs. O&s;born often &s;aid to her friends in this time, that &s;he con&s;idered her &s;ituation and cir|cum&s;tances in life, to be the be&s;t for her; and that &s;he knew of none, with whom &s;he could wi&s;h to exchange outward circum&s;tances, were it left to her option. She expre&s;&s;ed a particu|lar &s;atisfaction in living &s;en&s;ibly dependent on the providence of God, for daily &s;upplies for the body, living with God by the day, as &s;he u&s;ed to expre&s;s it, having no &s;tore of her own, and not able to do any thing to &s;upply her re|turning

wants, and not knowing how and by whom they would be &s;upplied, till it was &s;ent in to her, commonly in ways, and by per&s;ons not thought of by her. This was &s;uited to ex|cite a con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of her dependence on God for daily and hourly &s;upplies, and the exerci&s;e of tru&s;t in him, and con&s;tant application to him, and acknowledgement and admiration of his goodne&s;s in &s;upplying her wants, in a way and at times &s;uited to di&s;cover his hand and par|ticular care of her; and to excite her gratitude to her friends, and prayers for them, who &s;ent or brought to her the things &s;he wanted.</P>
<P>In this manner &s;he lived more than twenty years, and often declared to her friends that her daily wants were fully &s;upplied, and that &s;he was never de&s;titute of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and commonly had a fulne&s;s, and often abound|ed. Her wants were not great. She &s;tood in need of daily food, wa&s;hing, candle light, fire wood, and &s;ome clothing, and money to pay the rent of her hou&s;e, which was five dollars every three months. All the&s;e wants were con&s;tantly &s;upplied, while no particular per&s;on was en|gaged to do it; &s;o that &s;he had none to depend upon but God. While the Briti&s;h had po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of Rhodei&s;land in the time of the war, which was near three years, the inhabitants of Newport were driven to great &s;traights, by the &s;carcity of provi&s;ion, fuel, &amp;c. and many &s;uffer|ed to a great degree. Mrs. O&s;born lived in a great degree of quiet, and had a con&s;tant &s;up|ply of the nece&s;&s;aries of life; and received no abu&s;e from the Briti&s;h officers or &s;oldiers, as
<PB N="355" REF="035636_0178_100615738C61B168">
mo&s;t others did. Though a number of &s;oldiers were quartered near the hou&s;e in which &s;he lived, none were obtruded on her, as they were on others. And as to tho&s;e who were quarter|ed near her; it was remarked by her and oth|ers, that they made le&s;s di&s;turbance and noi&s;e, than they did el&s;ewhere; and were particularly careful not to do any thing on the Sabbath to di&s;turb that <HI>good woman,</HI> as they called her.

Which &s;he u&s;ed to mention afterwards to her friends, as a remarkable in|&s;tance of the tender care and protection of heaven.</P>
<P>In the year 1778, while the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Newport, Mr. O&s;born, her hu&s;band, died; and a grand daughter of his, with her hu&s;band, who lived in her hou&s;e, on whom &s;he had &s;ome dependence for protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, moved into the country, by which &s;he appeared more de&s;titute and expo&s;|ed, than before, being left <HI>alone.</HI></P>
<P>In this time of particular danger and trial, Mrs. MASON, a per&s;on who gave good evi|dence that &s;he was a real friend to Chri&s;t, and to his followers, manife&s;ted peculiar friend&s;hip and genero&s;ity towards her, by her con&s;tant at|tention to her, and &s;upplying many of her wants; and continued her &s;pecial kindne&s;s in mini&s;tering to her as long as &s;he (Mrs. Ma&s;on) lived, which &s;he did till March, 1792. Mrs. Or&s;born often &s;aid, that Mrs. Ma&s;on never failed her in one in&s;tance, as a peculiar friend and con&s;tant benefactor, to the day of her

death. We have no rea&s;on to doubt that they, both the giver and the receiver, are peculiarly happy together now; and that the former is re|warded a thou&s;and fold for all her kindne&s;s to the latter, as a dear di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Others have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in their kindne&s;s to Mrs. O&s;born in mini&s;tering to her, whom it is improper to mention, as they are yet alive.

<P>There was &s;omething peculiar and extraor|dinary in her being able punctually to pay the rent of her hou&s;e in this time, which is worthy of particular mention. She depended wholly upon the un&s;olicited benefactions of her friends for this, as &s;he did for her daily &s;upport. And no one was engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in doing this, or to take any care about it. She had there|fore no particular per&s;on to look to for it, or to make up any deficiency by which &s;he &s;hould be unable to pay what was due at the end of each quarter. It was therefore a very preca|rious matter, to human appearance, whether, when &s;he had paid the rent of one quarter, &s;he &s;hould ever be able to pay another. She could not conjecture from whence it would come, as &s;he had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to look to for it, but that God, who&s;e is the world, and the fulne&s;s thereof. Her intimate friends were &s;ometimes concerned for her, when her quarter was near at an end, and &s;he had received but part of the five dollars which would be &s;oon due, and there was a
<PB N="357" REF="035636_0179_10061575FB270D18">
great &s;carc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty of money, and all appearances that &s;he would not be able to pay. When this was &s;ugge&s;ted to her, &s;he would reply nearly in the following words. "I de&s;ire to be thank|ful to God, I do not feel in the lea&s;t anxious about it. I do not doubt of my having the whole of the money at the time in which it will be due, or near it. God has given me a con|&s;tant and earne&s;t de&s;ire to do ju&s;tice, and pay when any thing is due. This is a ju&s;t debt, and God has been plea&s;ed hitherto to gratify me by enabling me to pay, when it is due; and I believe he will &s;till continue to do it. Per|haps I &s;hall not live to the end of the quarter. I &s;hall then leave enough to pay this debt. I de&s;ire to leave it with God." She generally had the money in her hand by the time it was due, and never failed being able to pay with punctuality. She frequently did not receive much, if any part of the money, till ju&s;t before the quarter was ended, and knew not from whom, or from whence it would come; yet be|fore the time to pay came, as much as was nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer her end at that time, would be brought or &s;ent to her, by per&s;ons who knew nothing of her pre&s;ent &s;trait. And it was often &s;ent by per&s;ons who lived at a di&s;tance, which would come to her ju&s;t at the time in which it was wanted. She had money &s;ent her from Quebec, from the We&s;t Indies, and from vari|ous parts of the United States.</P>
<P>This is related as a remarkable in&s;tance of humble tru&s;t in God, and re&s;ignation and acqui|e&s;cence in his will; and of the tender care

and faithfulne&s;s of God, and loving kindne&s;s to|wards one devoted to his &s;ervice, and tru&s;ting in his promi&s;es: And that it may &s;erve as an example and encouragement to all, to "tru&s;t in the Lord, at all times, and pour out their hearts before him."</P>
<P>Mrs. Or&s;born was, in the la&s;t twenty years of her life, &s;tripped, by degrees, and deprived of many privileges and enjoyments, which to her had been very great and precious. She had e&s;teemed public wor&s;hip, attending on the preaching of the go&s;pel and public in&s;titutions, as far more de&s;irable and important than all worldly good, in attending on which &s;he had great enjoyment. But her bodily infirmities were &s;o great and increa&s;ing, that for near twenty years &s;he was unable to attend public wor&s;hip. Her eyes failed her to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he was obliged to lay by her pen, not being able to write any thing con&s;iderable, which &s;he had done before this with great plea&s;ure and profit to her&s;elf, having written more than fifty volumes, the lea&s;t containing near 100 pages, the bigger part above 200, and a number 300, and more, be&s;ides letters to her friends, and other occa&s;ional writing. The failing of her &s;ight al&s;o deprived her of the plea&s;ure and profit of <HI>reading</HI>; e&s;pecially of reading the Bi|ble, which &s;he had before daily peru&s;ed with great plea&s;ure and advantage. She had the Bible, indeed, read to her daily; which &s;he con&s;idered as an un&s;peakable favor. But this did not equal the privilege of being able to have acce&s;s to it, at all times, and on every
<PB N="359" REF="035636_0180_1006157A06473168">
particular occa&s;ion. But &s;he paid &s;uch atten|tion to the Bible, read it &s;o much, and &s;o trea|&s;ured it up in her memory, while &s;he could read, that &s;he found great plea&s;ure and bene|fit in being able to recollect &s;o much of it, when &s;he was not able to read; which &s;he fre|quently mentioned to her friends, as matter of thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The religious meetings in the room where &s;he lived, which have been mentioned, of the church, of the female &s;ociety, and occa&s;ional meetings for prayer of a number of profe&s;&s;ors of religion, which &s;he con&s;idered as a great priv|ilege, were continued as long as &s;he was able to bear them, partly for her &s;ake. But at length her infirmities were &s;o great that &s;he was obliged to relinqui&s;h this enjoyment. And &s;he became &s;o weak that &s;he could not bear lengthy vi&s;its of her friends, in which &s;he u&s;ed to take a peculiar plea&s;ure. Her mo&s;t intimate friends could only have &s;hort interviews with her at different times. But while &s;he found her&s;elf thus deprived of the&s;e privileges and her precious enjoyments, one after another, &s;he remained calm and re&s;igned in a &s;en&s;e of her unworthine&s;s of them, and de&s;ert of in|finitely greater evils; and con&s;tantly expre&s;&s;ed her thankfulne&s;s for the privileges and favors &s;he yet enjoyed; particularly that God had not taken him&s;elf from her; but indulged her with &s;uch a degree of free acce&s;s to him, and &s;uch enjoyment of him in views of his glorious per|fections and works, e&s;pecially his love and grace in the glorious work of redemption,
<PB N="360" REF="035636_0181_1006157B916E0170">
which more than made up for all that was taken from her. She enjoyed the almo&s;t uninter|rupted light of God's countenance, and &s;pent mo&s;t of her time and &s;trength in devotion, in prayer and prai&s;e, in which &s;he had un&s;peaka|ble delight, and a rich foreta&s;te of heaven. She u&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;he had learned to con&s;ider and hold her neare&s;t friends, as well as all worldly enjoyments, as a cloak or loo&s;e garment, which &s;he was ready to have taken off and laid a&s;ide, whenever there was occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>Some years before her death, &s;he &s;aid to her friends, &s;he thought the time was now come for them, and all who knew her, to be quite willing that &s;he &s;hould leave the world; for &s;he was become u&s;ele&s;s in all re&s;pects, and was only a charge and burden to tho&s;e by whom her bodily wants were &s;upplied. She was told, that all her friends de&s;ired that her life might be yet continued, if con&s;i&s;tent with the divine will, as &s;he was far from being u&s;ele&s;s, as we had her prayers for her friends; for the church and congregation to which &s;he belonged; for all the people and churches of Chri&s;t, and his intere&s;t and kingdom in the world, &amp;c. And when her acquaintance, and, particularly, the congregation of which &s;he was a member, thought of her, as being alive in her room, which probably mo&s;t of them often did, it was attended with an idea and feeling, which tend|ed to their good, and which they could not have, if &s;he were not in the world. And as to tho&s;e who mini&s;tered to her &s;upport and com|fort, they enjoyed a privilege and &s;atisfaction
<PB N="361" REF="035636_0181_1006157B916E0170">
in it, in&s;tead of its being an unde&s;irable burden, which they could not have, if &s;he were not here in ju&s;t &s;uch circum&s;tances. And they who did this to her, becau&s;e &s;he belonged to Chri&s;t, had opportunity hereby to exerci&s;e chri&s;tian charity, and expre&s;s their love to Chri&s;t, for all which they would be abundantly rewarded in his eternal kingdom. Her reply was to this purpo&s;e. "If this be &s;o, and I can be in any re&s;pect and degree u&s;eful in my &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, I am willing to continue in the body; but to depart and be with Chri&s;t is far better. I de&s;ire to leave it all with God, and am willing to live or die, ju&s;t as he plea&s;es."</P>
<P>Some months before her decea&s;e her di&s;or|ders of body appeared to increa&s;e; her &s;trength failed her more and more, and &s;he became drop&s;ical, and was at times in great di&s;tre&s;s for want of breath. She con&s;idered her&s;elf as now &s;oon <HI>going home,</HI> as &s;he expre&s;&s;ed it, and wi&s;hed for patience to wait till the appointed time of her departure &s;hould come, and to bear what|ever bodily di&s;tre&s;s God was plea&s;ed to lay upon her. She de&s;ired her friends to pray for her, that &s;he might have faith and patience to the end of life, and, in no re&s;pect, conduct &s;o as to be a di&s;grace to the religion which &s;he pro|fe&s;&s;ed, and put her chri&s;tian friends to &s;hame on her account: But that &s;he might glorify God, and &s;peak, and conduct worthy of her high and holy calling, to her la&s;t breath.</P>

<PB N="362" REF="035636_0182_1006157D2DDAD888">
Vol. II, is the following paragraph, written by one who vi&s;ited her often in her la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s.</P>
<P>"As &s;he drew near the clo&s;e of life, &s;he was a proof of the &s;trength and hope of the righteous; was an in&s;tance of the my&s;terious example of flouri&s;hing virtue, with the decays of nature: Of &s;atisfaction in the pro&s;pect of future good, when from the world &s;he could derive no plea&s;ure. My phy&s;ician," &s;he &s;aid, "has &s;eriou&s;ly intimated, that I cannot live <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng; but I am not alarmed. Unle&s;s my heart deceive me, and <HI>the heart is deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately wicked</HI>; but unle&s;s mine <HI>greatly</HI> deceive me, I have no rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive for the future &s;tate. It appears to be the will of God that I &s;hould go hence. I ought to &s;ubmit to his will, and I do, with cheerfulne&s;s. May his will be done." In an|other &s;ea&s;on, &s;he &s;aid, "The trials of my &s;ituation are great; to be in want of breath, is very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; pray for me, that I may have patience and re&s;ignation: I de&s;ire them above all things. O pray for me that, in the&s;e la&s;t hours of my life, I may not cau&s;e you all to blu&s;h that I have profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tianity." It being remarked, that God was faithful, and would never for&s;ake tho&s;e who had loved and &s;erved him. "Yes," &s;he replied, "I know, by experience, that he is a faithful covenant keep|ing God, and he will never leave tho&s;e who love and &s;erve him; though without his grace I &s;hould immediately &s;ink, and my mind be filled with darkne&s;s and repining." In this temper of humility and reliance on God, &s;he

continued, and gave no &s;ign of impatience, more than &s;aying, a day or two before her death, when &s;he heard the bell toll, that &s;ome|body had got the &s;tart of her."</P>
<P>She continued to &s;ink by degrees, till after a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing turn, &s;he appeared more comfortable, and they who attended her, helped her to lie down, at her de&s;ire, hoping &s;he might get &s;ome re&s;t and &s;leep. They left her for a few minutes, and when they returned, they found her breath was gone, and &s;he a lifele&s;s corp&s;e! Thus &s;he left the world, and pa&s;&s;ed that death which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> had &s;o often and &s;o long de&s;ired, calm and &s;e|rene, without the lea&s;t perceivable &s;truggle or groan, and, we doubt not, entered into that re&s;t to which the righteous go, on the 2d day of Augu&s;t, 1796, in the 83d year of her age. Her funeral was attended on the 4th day of Augu&s;t, by an uncommon concour&s;e of peo|ple. The corp&s;e was carried into the meeting hou&s;e, and a funeral &s;ermon was preached, from Ephe&s;ians iv.1. <HI>I therefore, the pri&s;oner of the Lord, be&s;eech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Memoirs will be concluded by mentioning a number of particulars of her chri&s;tian character, in which Mrs. Or&s;born was eminent, and worthy of imitation, which have been in &s;ome mea&s;ure brought into view in the foregoing narrative, and the extracts from her diary; and appear in a more clear and &s;triking

light to tho&s;e who have peru&s;ed the whole of her writings, or had a particular and intimate acquaintance with her.</P>
<P>She was &s;en&s;ibly and &s;trongly devoted to the glory of God, and con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;ought to honor him in all her ways. She was tenderly concerned, and careful to do and &s;ay nothing which had the lea&s;t perceivable tendency to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onor him, and con&s;tantly watched again&s;t every thing of that kind. She de&s;ired nothing for her&s;elf or others, and that nothing might take place, but what was con&s;i&s;tent with the highe&s;t di&s;play of the divine glory; and it was matter of con&s;tant joy to her, that God was able and would &s;ecure his own honor, and make the brighte&s;t manife&s;tation of his own glorious per|fections; and would &s;uffer nothing to take place but that which &s;hould be for his glory; and there|fore would cau&s;e even tho&s;e things and events, which, in them&s;elves appeared to have a tenden|cy to the contrary, to be the occa&s;ion of a more clear di&s;covery of his mo&s;t amiable and glori|ous character. She had an affecting and &s;trong abhorrence of every thing which &s;he &s;aw in her&s;elf, even all moral depravity; and which appeared in others, as having a tendency to di&s;honor God. This was a con&s;tant &s;ource of grief and trouble to her. By this &s;he mani|fe&s;ted a high degree of di&s;intere&s;ted, benevolent love to God, and was more conformed than mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians appear to be, to that apo&s;tolic injunction, "Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or what&s;oever ye do, do all to the glory of God."</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="035636_0183_1006157FAA10B128">Her love to God, and benevolence to man|kind led her greatly to de&s;ire the pro&s;perity and advancement of the intere&s;t and kingdom of Chri&s;t in the world, and the &s;alvation of men. For this &s;he prayed, and rejoiced when &s;he found others engaged and united in this, and when there was any appearance of the re|vival of religion, and of the conver&s;ion of &s;in|ners, or heard of any thing of this kind in di&s;|tant places. She earne&s;tly &s;ought the &s;alvation and temporal good of all whom &s;he knew, and with whom &s;he had any connection; and their circum&s;tances, and the events re&s;pecting them, whether pro&s;perous or adver&s;e, affected her, which con&s;tantly afforded her matter of prayer and prai&s;e, while &s;he endeavored to conduct towards all, and treat them &s;o in all re&s;pects as to recommend religion to them, and per&s;uade them to embrace and practi&s;e it.</P>
<P>She practi&s;ed &s;ecret devotions at &s;tated times, unle&s;s prevented by &s;ome unavoidable inter|ruption; in which &s;he &s;pent con&s;iderable time every day, in reading the Bible, &s;erious medi|tation and prayer, in which &s;he had, e&s;pecially at times, great enlargement and delight. And when &s;he had no &s;en&s;ible acce&s;s to God, &s;he could have but little comfort and enjoyment in any thing. Her mind was frequently and almo&s;t con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed in devotion by pi|ous ejaculations, when in company, or attending to her daily bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>She was a great friend to family religion, to have &s;ome portion of the Bible read, and prayer attended in the family, in the morning
<PB N="366" REF="035636_0184_10061583DF248CA8">
and evening; and took care to have all her family pre&s;ent, and that they &s;hould behave with decency. And when no man was pre&s;ent, &s;he thought it her duty to pray with her family her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She had a great veneration and love for the chri&s;tian Sabbath, and public wor&s;hip. This was a high day with her; and &s;he commonly had great enjoyment in attending public prayers, &s;inging, and hearing the word preach|ed; and e&s;pecially in attending the Lord's Sup|per; for which &s;he was careful and &s;olemn in preparations, and &s;elf examination. She u&s;ed to recollect the particular heads of the public di&s;cour&s;es for her own improvement in her re|tirement, and often committed them to writing, with her reflections on them. She was care|ful to prepare for the Sabbath, by ordering her family affairs &s;o as not to be led by them to intrude upon the Sabbath, or be any di&s;turb|ance to her devotions. And after &s;he was con|fined, and could not attend public wor&s;hip, &s;he took &s;pecial care not to attend to any thing on the day before the Sabbath, which might in any re&s;pect unfit her for the private duties of the Sabbath, wi&s;hing to re&s;erve all her &s;trength of body and mind for the exerci&s;es of that high day. And though &s;he could not enjoy bodily attendance on public wor&s;hip; yet in her &s;pirit &s;he was pre&s;ent with the wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;emblies of chri&s;tians; e&s;pecially with that to which &s;he had a more particular relation, &s;o as to have a peculiar enjoyment in her attending to them, and joining with them in her mental exerci&s;es.
<PB N="367" REF="035636_0184_10061583DF248CA8">
In this re&s;pect &s;he received great benefit by public wor&s;hip, and doubtle&s;s had more bene|fit and enjoyment from it, than many, if not the mo&s;t, received, who were allowed to attend con&s;tantly. She was &s;o inqui&s;itive to know what were the &s;ubjects of the public di&s;cour&s;es, that &s;he would be informed what they were to be, before they were delivered, or &s;oon after, and &s;he would attend to them, and &s;o fea&s;t upon the truths contained in them, that her en|tertainment and profit by them appeared far to exceed that which mo&s;t who heard them in public obtained.</P>
<P>The following extract of a letter which &s;he wrote to a friend, is in&s;erted here, as an illu&s;|tration of the above. Speaking of her being deprived of the enjoyment of public wor&s;hip, by bodily infirmity, &s;he &s;aid, "My Lord's days' enjoyments, &s;ince my confinement, have been better felt than expre&s;&s;ed. Perhaps my exerci&s;es never were higher, when wor&s;hipping in God's own hou&s;e, nor even at the Redeemer's table: Never felt a dearer union with the people of God; that onene&s;s which cannot be expre&s;&s;ed. Nor had &s;tronger de&s;ires excited by the Spirit of God for Zion's pro&s;perity; and the de&s;truc|tion of &s;in and Satan, and advancement of Chri&s;t's cau&s;e and kingdom: Nor &s;tronger de|&s;ires to help my dear mini&s;ter while he was en|gaged in the Lord's work; to be permitted to hold up his hands, that Amalek may not pre|vail, but the work of the Lord pro&s;per in his hands.

And God &s;o ble&s;&s;eth &s;omething repeated to me from the &s;ermons, that I retain and feed more on the precious truths all the week, than I have been able to re|tain, when I have heard the whole.

<P>She was not talkative; yet affable and plea&s;|ant in conver&s;ation, and when in company with her friends and acquaintance, &s;he had an aver|&s;ion to vain, trifling conver&s;ation. And if at any time it took place, &s;he would generally at|tempt to divert it to &s;omething &s;erious and profitable. If in any in&s;tance &s;he neglected this, and in any degree joined with them, and &s;poke any thing which on reflection &s;he thought to be too light and unprofitable, &s;he would with &s;orrow condemn and humble her&s;elf before God. Her chief enjoyment in company was with her chri&s;tian friends; and when &s;he was with them and little or no religious conver&s;a|tion took place, it would be matter of grief, &s;hame and lamentation to her. Few have their tongues &s;o much under a bridle, as &s;he had; yet &s;he often lamented that it was not more &s;o.</P>
<P>She had a deep, abiding, and increa&s;ing con|viction and &s;en&s;e of the evil of &s;in, as being en|mity again&s;t God, and all that is truly good;

She therefore tru&s;ted in Chri&s;t alone as her redeemer and &s;anctifier. He was infinitely honorable, excellent and precious in her &s;ight, on who&s;e atonement, merit, righteou&s;|ne&s;s, wi&s;dom and power &s;he relied, as every way &s;ufficient for her pardon and complete &s;alva|tion. This is abundantly expre&s;&s;ed in her dia|ry. She felt the power of the&s;e truths to form her to a willing obedience to Chri&s;t, and ear|ne&s;tly to de&s;ire perfect conformity to the holy law of God, and his moral image and character, knowing that &s;he could not be completely hap|py till &s;he awaked in the likene&s;s of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>She highly e&s;teemed tho&s;e who appeared the true mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, for their work's &s;ake, and was liberal in her contributions for the &s;upport of public wor&s;hip and the preach|ing of the go&s;pel, knowing it was ordained by Chri&s;t, that they who preach the go&s;pel, &s;hould live of the go&s;pel. It is known that in this

matter &s;he was willing to her power, and even beyond it; and that &s;he often gave more to this end, than many wealthy per&s;ons of the &s;ame congregation. And &s;he u&s;ed her influence to excite others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o contribute. And when &s;he was wholly dependent on her friends for a &s;upport, and unable to attend public wor&s;hip, if &s;he had more given to her than &s;he want|ed for her pre&s;ent &s;upply and comfort, &s;he would give a part of it for the &s;upport of the go&s;pel; and would &s;ay, &s;he pre&s;umed her friends who kindly mini&s;tered for the &s;upply of her wants would be willing that &s;he &s;hould have the &s;atisfaction of contributing her two mites for the &s;upport of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, when &s;he had any thing to &s;pare.</P>
<P>Mrs. O&s;born had an uncommon concern to do ju&s;tice to all with whom &s;he had any deal|ings, in all re&s;pects, both in the &s;ight of men, and before God. In this &s;he was con&s;cientious, and con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed her&s;elf with great care and circum&s;pection to have a con&s;cience void of offence towards men, always keeping what &s;he called the golden rule in her view, de&s;iring to do to others, as &s;he would they &s;hould do to her. This appears in a clear and &s;triking light in her diary.</P>
<P>And &s;he not only did ju&s;tice, but loved mer|cy. She gladly embraced every opportunity to relieve the wants and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others, when in her power, and would often run ventures, and &s;trip her&s;elf of what &s;he really wanted, to relieve others who appeared to her to be in greater want. When &s;he was dependent on
<PB N="371" REF="035636_0186_100615870384FC58">
others for &s;upport, and &s;he had any thing in her hand which &s;he could &s;pare, &s;he took delight in relieving the poor in di&s;tre&s;s, knowing that her benefactors were willing &s;he &s;hould enjoy this plea&s;ure, which was much greater to her, than to u&s;e it for her&s;elf. In this way &s;he was al|ways laying up a trea&s;ure in heaven, and became rich towards God.</P>
<P>Mrs. O&s;born was a kind and <HI>faithful</HI> friend. She was a true friend to all, even to tho&s;e who acted an unfriendly part to her, and injured her. But her heart was united in a peculiar manner and degree to tho&s;e who appeared to be friends to Chri&s;t. The&s;e were her cho&s;en a&s;&s;ociates and companions, in whom &s;he had great delight. And all her chri&s;tian friends might place the greate&s;t confidence in her, and u&s;e the utmo&s;t freedom without giving offence; and tru&s;t any &s;ecret with her, with the greate&s;t &s;afety, without the lea&s;t fear of being betrayed, or that it would be communicated to any one. She had a number of intimate friends, with whom &s;he conver&s;ed with great openne&s;s, free|dom and plea&s;ure, finding, on acquaintance, that &s;he could &s;afely rely on their candor, friend&s;hip, prudence and fidelity. Among the&s;e Mi&s;s Su&s;a Anthony, who&s;e life has lately been publi&s;hed, was the fir&s;t, and her greate&s;t inti|mate, whom &s;he highly e&s;teemed and loved, as an eminent chri&s;tian, of uncommon di&s;cerning and judgment; and whom &s;he found to be a mo&s;t faithful, prudent friend, at all times. There was a di&s;tingui&s;hed and eminently chri&s;t|ian and happy friend&s;hip enjoyed and cultivat|ed
<PB N="372" REF="035636_0187_10061588B71F5018">
between them, for about fifty years, without any interruption, and to their great mutual comfort and helpfulne&s;s.&mdash;They were truly, and in a di&s;tingui&s;hed degree, of one heart and one &s;oul, and during the whole time loved each other with a pure heart, fervently. It is not known or believed that there is to be found, or has been in this century &s;uch a union and hap|py chri&s;tian friend&s;hip between two &s;uch emi|nent chri&s;tians, for &s;o long a time, as took place in this in&s;tance. What fervent prayers and prai&s;es did they pour out before God for each other, when &s;eparate! What hearty and &s;weet coun&s;el did they take together, giving mutual advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, under their various trials, burdens, difficulties and doubts, while they o|pened their hearts and feelings, in full confi|dence in each other! With what fervor, freedom and plea&s;ure, did they two join in devotion, by pouring out their hearts before God, when they had opportunities! With what high delight and rapture have they met among the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect, where, free from all &s;in and &s;orrow, their long continued friend&s;hip in this world, is made perfect with an a&s;&s;urance that it will increa&s;e in happine&s;s and la&s;t forever, in the favor and pre&s;ence of Him, whom they love with all their hearts, and is their everla&s;ting portion! Here we are lo&s;t, and mu&s;t wait till the curtain of mortality be dropped, to have a perfect knowledge and enjoyment of that felic|ity and glory of which we have now ideas &s;o dark and very imperfect. Ble&s;&s;ed are they

who are not &s;lothful, but followers of them, who, through faith and patience, now inherit the promi&s;es!</P>
<P>AFTER Mrs. O&s;born had laid by her pen for a number of years, through the defect of her eye &s;ight, and debility of body and mind, her thoughts unaccountably turned upon meditating on divine &s;ubjects, in ver&s;e or rhyme. This increa&s;ed upon her, &s;o that &s;he made ver&s;es on a number of &s;ubjects; and her memory retained them, while they were not written, &s;o that &s;he could rehear&s;e them di&s;|tinctly, when &s;he plea&s;ed; which &s;he did to &s;ome of her intimate friends. They were plea&s;ed with them, not for their elegance and poetry; for to this &s;he made no preten&s;ion; but for the &s;entiments, as expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>her,</HI> and flowing from her heart, without any &s;peculative &s;tudy: And &s;ome of them were written from her mouth.</P>
<P>Her mind became more and more engaged in this way, which &s;he found to be entertaining and profitable to her&s;elf. At length &s;he thought of attempting to re&s;ume her pen, and write her ver&s;es on &s;everal &s;ubjects, though &s;he knew &s;he was not a poet, and had never before attempted any thing of the kind. She found her&s;elf able to write, beyond any thing &s;he, or her friends, had ever expected, and wrote &s;o much on a number of &s;ubjects, many of which &s;he had be+fore
<PB N="374" REF="035636_0188_1006158B353F5130">
compo&s;ed in her mind, and retained in her memory, that, if collected together, they would make a con&s;iderable volume.</P>
<P>As this was, in &s;everal re&s;pects, an extraordi|nary event, and the&s;e writings expre&s;s the de|vout exerci&s;es of her heart, in a manner differ|ent from her diary, the following is here in|&s;erted as a &s;pecimen of the whole.</P>
