<HEAD>AN ESSAY on CREDIT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>CREDIT <HI>is the confidence which mankind place in the virtue and good character of its object;</HI> &s;o when we &s;ay of a man, he is a per&s;on of credit and re|putation, the meaning is, that he is a man in who&s;e virtue and good character people in general place confi|dence.</P>
<P>CREDIT, in a commercial &s;en&s;e, <HI>is the confidence which people place in a man's integrity and punctuality, in fulfilling his contracts, and performing his engagements.</HI> When we &s;peak of a merchant of credit, we mean a merchant, in who&s;e ability, integrity, and punctuality, in fulfilling his contracts and engagements, people have confidence, i. e. a man of integrity and truth, who is fit to be believed and tru&s;ted; the contrary or rever&s;e of this, i. e. a man of no credit is a man of no integrity in his dealings, who will quibble and &s;huffle, evade his contracts, violate his word and truth, delay his pay|ments, di&s;appoint his creditors, u&s;e deceit, chicanery and fal&s;hood, &amp;c. i. e. is not &s;it to be believed or tru&s;|ted.&mdash;From this view of the matter, it appears that credit is a mo&s;t valuable thing in &s;ociety, it gives hearts ea&s;e, it gives wealth, 'tis a nur&s;e of every &s;ocial virtue, it makes a &s;oil &s;uitable for the growth of public &s;pirit and every public virtue; the worth and value of this may perhaps be be&s;t illu&s;trated by comparing it or view|ing it in contra&s;t, with its contrary; how much better do we feel? how much richer do we grow? how much more ea&s;y, &s;afe and &s;atisfied do we enjoy our&s;elves? when we live among citizens to whom we can give full credit, in whom we can have &s;afe confidence, and whom we can tru&s;t, than when we find our&s;elves among people to whom we can give no credit, in whom we
<PB N="4" REF="020129_0003_0FADEC082074D298">
can have no confidence, and whom we cannot tru&s;t, and where every concern or contract we make with them is attended with anxiety, unea&s;ine&s;s and fear, and commonly followed by deceit, lo&s;s and di&s;appoint|ment; in this ca&s;e, I de&s;ire, I can need no better ar|gument, no better proof, no better explanation of my &s;ubject, than an appeal to the in&s;tant feelings of my fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>BUT however valuable and excellent in &s;ociety, how|ever profitable and haypyfying, however &s;oothing to our warme&s;t wi&s;hes credit public or private may be, <HI>'tis in vain to hope for it, or even to imagine the po&s;&s;ibility of its exi&s;tence, without its proper object, which is hone&s;ty or integrity,</HI> it can no more be forced by laws, it can no more be obtruded by authority, however high and pui&s;&s;ant, than an article of faith can be forced on the under&s;tanding, without proper proof or evidence.&mdash; <HI>Credit and hone&s;ty are in their nature correlatives, and mu&s;t and forever will imply and &s;upport each other.</HI> Integrity will generate credit and confidence the moment 'tis known in any part of the world, and the moment that integrity or hone&s;ty is ob&s;erved to cea&s;e, the credit or confidence which was generated by it, in&s;tantly cea&s;es too; it dies, it can never be brought to draw another breath, after the integrity which generated it, and &s;up|plied all its vital motions, is gone.</P>
<P>'TIS here to be noted, that however nece&s;&s;ary and even e&s;&s;ential integrity is to credit, yet in a commercial &s;en&s;e, i. e. as far as it relates to trade, money or wealth, 'tis not the only thing nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>power or ability mu&s;t be added,</HI> for however clear and plain it is, that an hone&s;t man will never contract beyond his power of perform|ance, yet it often happens that his power of perform|ance may be much le&s;&s;ened between the time of contract and the time of fulfillment, by many incidents, which may and do often take place, which at once le&s;&s;en his credit, or the confidence of his neighbours in his en|gagements;
<PB N="5" REF="020129_0004_0FADEC090296AC88">
the&s;e incidents often affect hone&s;t mer|chants &s;o deeply, as to occa&s;ion their failure or bank|ruptcy, and their failure often produces another in their creditors, that a third and that a fourth, &amp;c. This &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of failures often originates in a &s;wind|ler or ra&s;cal, who knowingly contracts va&s;tly beyond his ability of performance, and of cour&s;e ruins not only him&s;elf, but a numerous &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hone&s;t men. This affords us one in&s;tance of the va&s;t mi&s;|chief which a community may and often does &s;uffer from one di&s;hone&s;t man re&s;iding among them; very many others might be produced of like mi&s;chief, ef|fected in a great variety of ways, and to &s;uch a degree that a national character may be deeply &s;tained by the iniquity and knavery of a few. This &s;hews that it is of mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;equence to every &s;tate, to u&s;e eve|ry po&s;&s;ible means, not only to pre&s;erve the national credit and character of their &s;tate in good purity and honor, but al&s;o to introduce as far as may be, habits of integrity and honor among their citizens, and extir|pate, as far as can be done, all &s;uch villainous and &s;candalous practices, as naturally tend to di&s;grace the national character, and ruin the fortunes of private citizens.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations will appear with greater force and advantage, if we recur for a moment, to what I ju&s;t now mentioned, viz. the great ea&s;e, &s;atisfaction, and convenience of living in a &s;tate where the public finance is &s;o managed, that all private citizens can &s;afe|ly rely on the ju&s;tice and punctuality of the public en|gagements, and where the habits of hone&s;ty and in|tegrity are &s;o general among the private citizens, that they may &s;afely tru&s;t one another, &s;o that credit and mutual confidence in each other may prevail through the community. Thus circum&s;tanced, every man may &s;afely employ his &s;tock in any bu&s;ine&s;s of advantage, either of merchandi&s;e, mechani&s;m, or hu&s;bandry; whereas if he lived in a &s;tate, and among citizens of
<PB N="6" REF="020129_0005_0FADEC0D1436DDA0">
contrary character, <HI>he would be afraid to let his &s;tock go out of his own keeping, lea&s;t it &s;hould fall into hands either public or private, which would retain it from him, &s;o that he could not recover it again, though the advantages of improvement both to the public and him&s;elf, might be ve|ry great and inviting.</HI>&mdash;In a &s;tate, and among citizens &s;o happily di&s;po&s;ed, any man, with indu&s;try and oeco|nomy, though his means were &s;mall, might live very ea&s;y and comfortable, and the man of fortune might improve his e&s;tate very &s;afely and happily, to the great advantage both of the public and him&s;elf. Strangers would have every encouragement to flock in to &s;uch a &s;tate, and thereby increa&s;e the population, and of cour&s;e the commerce, manufactures, and hu&s;bandry of it.</P>
<P>FROM this view of the &s;ubject it appears &s;trikingly evident, that credit, both public and private, and the mutual confidence of citizens in the public ju&s;tice, and in each other, is of mo&s;t momentous advantage, of mo&s;t capital convenience, both to the public and to the individual members of it, it contributes mo&s;t decidedly and e&s;&s;entially to the internal e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;ecurity and &s;afety of the government, and to the ea&s;e, wealth and happine&s;s of private citizens, therefore it follows, that <HI>'tis the high intere&s;t, and great duty of every &s;tate to adopt and pur&s;ue every practicable method of &s;ecuring, en|larging and extending to the utmo&s;t degree, all the advan|tages and ble&s;&s;ings which can re&s;ult from &s;uch public and private credit, and the mutual confidence of the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate, in the public and in each other.</HI></P>
<P>THE wi&s;e&s;t and riche&s;t nations of Europe, long be|fore we were born, have &s;een this &s;ubject and its mo&s;t momentous importance, in a light &s;o &s;trong and glaring, as induced them to adopt every practicable method in their power, to &s;ecure to them&s;elves &s;uch invaluable advantages.&mdash;In their practice we have an example, and in their &s;ucce&s;s we have encouragement, and very &s;trong inducement to imitate it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="020129_0006_0FADEC0F5E9D43D8">FOR this purpo&s;e the riche&s;t trading cities of Eu|rope, long &s;ince adopted the plan of e&s;tabli&s;hing public banks; this plan they formed upon the mo&s;t deliberate con&s;ideration; they had the greate&s;t opportunities of information, had the greate&s;t experience in the &s;ubject; they knew the importance, operation and effects of both ca&s;h and credit, the be&s;t of any men then in the world, as their trade and wealth were then the great|e&s;t of any in the world.&mdash;It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that their fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays reached the perfection of the &s;ubject, but they found advantages enough in their fir&s;t trial, to induce them to continue the practice ever &s;ince.</P>
<P><HI>Genoa</HI> was the fir&s;t &s;tate in Europe which e&s;tabli&s;hed a public bank; their bank of St. George was e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in 1407, by a public act of that republic. The plan was &s;oon followed by <HI>Venice,</HI> who&s;e bank, which continues to this day with the greate&s;t ad|vantage to the &s;tate, as well as to their private citi|zens, and has ever been in the highe&s;t reputation and credit both at home and through all Europe, was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by a public act of their &s;tate. The city of <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI> long after followed their example, and their pre|&s;ent bank received a public e&s;tabli&s;hment by an act of their States-General, in 1609. The cities of <HI>Rotterdam</HI> and <HI>Hamburgh</HI> adopted the &s;ame practice; and England, who is always phlegmatic and late in adopting the example of the other European &s;tates, in&s;tituted and e&s;tabli&s;hed its bank in 1694; and France, who&s;e attention in tho&s;e days was little turned to improvements in trade, came later into it, their royal bank at <HI>Paris</HI> was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by public authority in 1718, be&s;ides the&s;e, ve|ry many other banks of le&s;s extent and con&s;equence, both public and private, are now e&s;tabli&s;hed in the tra|ding cities of Europe, and banks are become the great receptacles of the ca&s;h of Europe, and almo&s;t all mer|cantile receipts and payments are made through them.</P>
<P>THE bank of <HI>Genoa</HI> indeed fail'd in 1746, after that re|public
<PB N="8" REF="020129_0007_0FADEC10DB9C0610">
had for a great length of time enjoyed mo&s;t &s;ignal and capital benefits from it, but its ruin was not brought on by any defect of its principle, or mi&s;management of its Directors, but by the madne&s;s of the rulers of that &s;tate; they were not mad enough indeed to decry it as a u&s;ele&s;s or dangerous in&s;titution, but they adopt|ed the contrary extreme, they magnified its &s;trength and power too much, and compelled the Directors to make advances to the &s;tate, beyond what their funds would bear.</P>
<P>THE other banks have continued to this day, and with &s;uch incredible and mo&s;t acknowledged benefit to the &s;everal &s;tates in which they are e&s;tabli&s;hed, that their credit or decline has generally been con&s;idered as a &s;ort of &s;ure criterion of the &s;trength or weekne&s;s of the &s;tate in which they are e&s;tabli&s;hed. When nations are at war, they ever have thought it a &s;ure way to bring on fatal embarra&s;sments on an enemy, if they can by any po&s;&s;ible means &s;hake the credit of their bank, and every &s;tate has always been ready to go great lengths to &s;upport their bank, if by any turn of affairs it has happened to be in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t therefore be very ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>&s;uch an in&s;titution can be hurtful or even u&s;ele&s;s, that has &s;tood the te&s;t of &s;uch exten&s;ive and durable tryal and practice, among &s;o many nations of the greate&s;t experience, and mo&s;t accurate knowledge of the &s;ubject</HI>; an in&s;titution through which not only the ca&s;h of private merchants, but of the greate&s;t and riche&s;t trading companies, and even the trea&s;ure of nations, has been &s;o long negociated, and which, through &s;o great a length of time up to this very hour, &s;upports its credit, and character of va&s;t utility, by the univer&s;al &s;uffrage of nations, thro' all ranks of people, from crowns and the mo&s;t digni|fied a&s;&s;emblies of &s;tate&s;men, and the mo&s;t wealthy com|panies of merchants, down to the lowe&s;t dealer.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="020129_0008_0FADEC1123594930">BUT all this notwith&s;tanding people may be found little acquainted with the &s;ubject, and wholly unexperi|enced in it, who will give their opinion <HI>that &s;uch an in&s;titution is injurious to a &s;tate, and incompatible with the &s;afety of it.</HI> This may be con&s;idered as an in&s;tance and proof of that height of ab&s;urdity, which people may arrive at, who grow zealous and po&s;itive in things they do not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>BUT however well the nature of banks may be un|der&s;tood in Europe, and however immen&s;e the advan|tages and profits which are derived from them, may be, yet the thing is new in America, and by many people thought unfavorably of.</P>
<P>THE BANK of <HI>North-America,</HI> though e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of Congre&s;s (December 31, 1781) which is the highe&s;t authority of the union, and recognized expre&s;s|ly by many of the &s;tates, and implicitly by them all, is neverthele&s;s treated by many people here, as a mo&s;t dangerous and injurious thing, utterly incompatible with the &s;afety of the &s;tate, and of cour&s;e they think it ought to be demoli&s;hed without ceremony, and that the common forms of di&s;&s;olution are unnece&s;&s;ary, as people are not very nice in the manner, or delicate in the choice of means of hunting down a bea&s;t of prey, or de&s;troying a common enemy.</P>
<P>BUT as I &s;uppo&s;e my fellow-citizens will ever be wil|ling to hear before they condemn a thing that has once &s;aved them, and very often afforded many of them a material convenience, I apprehend a &s;hort di&s;&s;ertation, &s;hewing the nature of a bank, will not be unacceptable.</P>
<P>A BANK <HI>is a large repo&s;itory of ca&s;h, depo&s;ited under the direction of proper officers</HI> (&s;ay a Pre&s;ident and Di|rectors) <HI>for the purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing and &s;upporting a great and exten&s;ive credit, to be made u&s;e of in every ca&s;e where an e&s;tabli&s;hed credit will an&s;wer in exchange or
<PB N="10" REF="020129_0009_0FADEC11E359D5D0">
payment, as well as ca&s;h, or better than ca&s;h, as in many circum&s;tances will manife&s;tly and undoubtedly be the ca&s;e;</HI> for in&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e this &s;tate &s;hould erect and e&s;tabli&s;h a bank, and order all the revenues of the &s;tate to be paid into it, and &s;hould direct that all the debts of the &s;tate &s;hould be paid in bank-bills of the &s;ame bank, payable to the owner or bearer, which bearer &s;hould have liberty, whenever he plea&s;es, to carry his bill to the bank, and receive ca&s;h for it, and &s;hould direct further, that if &s;uch bank-bills, in any circum&s;tance, happen to &s;uit any citizen better than ca&s;h, he &s;hould be at liberty to carry his ca&s;h to the bank, and take out bank-bills for it.</P>
<P>THIS would be a public or &s;tate-bank, becau&s;e the &s;tock of it would be the money of the public, and the officers of it would be appointed by the public, i. e. by the General A&s;&s;embly, or Pre&s;ident and Council.</P>
<P>THE effect or operation of &s;uch a bank, when its credit becomes e&s;tabli&s;hed (i. e. when the people at large believed with full confidence, that the fund or &s;tock was &s;ufficient, and the management fair and up|right) I &s;ay the operation or effect of &s;uch a bank would be, that very few of the people who &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch bank-bills, would carry them into the bank, and receive ca&s;h for them, becau&s;e the bills would an&s;wer by far <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he greate&s;t part of the purpo&s;es of ca&s;h as well as ca&s;h, i. e. they would purcha&s;e any kind of commodities, and pay any kind of debts as well as ca&s;h, as we find is the ca&s;e of the bank-bills of the bank of North-America, at this time.</P>
<P>FURTHER &s;uch bills would not only be as good as ca&s;h for almo&s;t every purpo&s;e, where ca&s;h is u&s;ed or needed, but on many accounts they would be better than ca&s;h, as any &s;um of them is ea&s;ier and more certain|ly counted than ca&s;h; the danger of counterfeits would be le&s;s&punc; the carriage would be ea&s;ier; they would be le&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="020129_0010_0FADEC12A366A710">
expo&s;ed to thefts and robberies than ca&s;h, (for a man can conceal from a thief a thou&s;and dollars in bills, or run from a robber with them, ea&s;ier than with a thou&s;and dollars of &s;ilver); in ca&s;e they are de&s;troyed by fire, water, or other accident, they are not lo&s;t, but on proof made at the bank, they may be re|placed, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE advantages would be &s;till greater, if in&s;tead of bank-bills, the owner &s;hould take a bank credit, and draw checks on the bank, whenever he needed his mo|ney; this would enable him to pay any &s;um exactly, without the trouble of making change, he would be able in any future time to prove his payments, if he kept his checks which he received cancelled from the bank, as every man ought to do; this would at once free him from all danger of lo&s;s by fire, robbers, mi&s;|laying, dropping them on the road, &amp;c &amp;c. This practice is found by experience to be &s;o very conveni|ent, that 'tis almo&s;t univer&s;ally adopted by people who keep their ca&s;h in our pre&s;ent bank.</P>
<P>THESE and many other advantages which bank-bills or bank credit have beyond what ca&s;h can have, would doubtle&s;s induce mo&s;t people to prefer bills or bank credit to ca&s;h, and of cour&s;e very few po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of ei|ther would demand ca&s;h at the bank, the con&s;equence of which would be, that at the end of the year much of the ca&s;h would remain in the bank, though the whole amount of the bank-&s;tock &s;hould have been paid out in bills, and been con&s;tantly circulating among the people, with every advantage that ca&s;h could have, and many other very valuable advantages that ca&s;h could not have, as has been ju&s;t now &s;hown.</P>
<P>THE benefits or u&s;es of the bank when thus e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">|li&s;hed, are various: 1, <HI>The bank gains all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">+per, i. e. all &s;uch bank-bills as are lo&s;t (where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> can't be proved) and of cour&s;e can never be br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the
<PB N="12" REF="020129_0011_0FADEC137ACB4500">
bank for redemption or payment.</HI> 2, The bank can on any public emergency <HI>emit bank-bills, beyond the amount of the ca&s;h or &s;tock in the bank,</HI> and of cour&s;e can have the benefit of a con&s;iderable &s;um to circulate or u&s;e for the public benefit, without paying intere&s;t, or <HI>having it known to an enemy that they are embarra&s;&s;ed or in debt.</HI> Or 3, if the exigencies of the &s;tate-&s;hould not require this, <HI>they may accommodate their citizens with di&s;counts or loans on intere&s;t, to the great increa&s;e of the bank-&s;tock or public revenue,</HI> as well as doing great favor to indivi|duals, and increa&s;ing the trade, manufactures and hu&s;bandry of the &s;tate; <HI>this is the be&s;t and perhaps the only proper way of &s;upporting a public loan-office in a &s;tate.</HI> And 4, if the revenues &s;hould increa&s;e beyond the ex|penditures of the &s;tate, <HI>the bank-&s;tock will accumulate 'till the amount may be very great,</HI> and a rich &s;tate, like a rich individual, derives many and great advantages from wealth, and even from the reputation of wealth.</P>
<P>THESE advantages have been found by experience to be much greater, va&s;tly greater, than a &s;anguine &s;pe|culator, upon a bare view of the nature of the &s;ubject, would imagine. <HI>The force and energy of credit, perfect|ly well e&s;tabli&s;hed and permanent, is va&s;t almo&s;t beyond conception,</HI> it is found by experience to &s;upply the place of ca&s;h, and much better than ca&s;h, in almo&s;t all tran&s;|actions, except in &s;mall expences, where &s;mall change is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;uch as travelling expences, market-mo|ney, &amp;c. it is al&s;o found by experience, that any &s;um of money in the &s;tock of a bank, well regulated and managed, is &s;ufficient to &s;upport the credit of <HI>double or treble its amount in bank-bills,</HI> whil&s;t each of tho&s;e bills is indi&s;putably as good as ca&s;h, becau&s;e <HI>the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or may at any time exchange them at the bank for &s;olid hard money, whenever, either through di&s;tru&s;t of the bank, or his own conveniency, he may cho&s;e to do it</HI>; it follows then 5th, that a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">od bank may increa&s;e the circulating medium of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> double or treble the quantity of real ca&s;h, with|out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ea&s;ing the real money, or <HI>incurring the lea&s;t

<P>THIS bank will have a nature and operation &s;imilar to the other, and will afford the &s;ame kind of conve|nience to the citizens who cho&s;e to be concerned in it, and in both ca&s;es the particular profits of the bank will go to the &s;tockholders, i. e. in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to the public or &s;tate, which is the great and &s;ole &s;tockholder of it, in the other ca&s;e to the private &s;tockholders, who&s;e contributions compo&s;e the &s;tock.</P>
<P>OF this kind is the BANK of <HI>North-America,</HI> and has a much greater capital (about mine hundred thou|&s;and dollars) than any &s;tate bank can have in the pre&s;ent condition of our finances, and its operation, effects and u&s;es are much more exten&s;ive, and its ac|commodations to the citizens, and even to the &s;tate, much greater than a &s;tate bank could have; this may afford one an&s;wer to an objection which &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> rai&s;e again&s;t the pre&s;ent bank, viz. <HI>that it would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+ter to di&s;continue the pre&s;ent bank, and erect a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

Another rea&s;on is, that a bank, who&s;e &s;tock is made up by the &s;ub&s;cription of private men, and ma|naged by the &s;tockholders, is the &s;ure&s;t antidote or pre&s;ervative again&s;t tyranny in the government, that can be named; its owners are the rich men of the &s;tate, who will never be concerned in needle&s;s popular cla|mours or &s;edition again&s;t the government, but at the &s;ame time have both influence and inducement eno' to be a check and re&s;traint on government, when it becomes oppre&s;&s;ive, and really verges towards tyranny; the rich have an intere&s;t in their poor fellow-citizens, and (as &s;ome men u&s;e their wives) however tyrannical they may be them&s;elves, they will not &s;uffer any body el&s;e to tyrannize over them.

<P>SOME objections have been made to the pre&s;ent bank, which it may be proper to con&s;ider.&mdash;1, <HI>&s;uch va&s;t &s;ums of money are hoarded up in the bank, that ca&s;h is became &s;carce</HI> in town and country.

<HI>A very great part of the bank &s;tock, on the &s;trength of which the bank i&s;&s;ues and &s;upports the circulation it gives out, belongs not ot this &s;tate or its neighbourhood, but to peo|ple who live in di&s;tant parts,</HI> to whom it mu&s;t be remit|ted if the bank &s;hould be broke up.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER <HI>objection is, that monied men find a greater advantage in purcha&s;ing bank &s;tock than in letting their money on intere&s;t to people in the country, as formerly was done, and of cour&s;e, though the monied men in town may gain by the bank, yet the country people &s;uffer by it.</HI>&mdash; This is a &s;trange &s;ort of &s;entiment to appear in form of an objection; becau&s;e, the bank inhances the value, or increa&s;es the u&s;e of ca&s;h or any other property, &s;o that the purcha&s;er is compelled to give more for it than be|fore; therefore the bank is hurtful. The &s;ame cau&s;e (i. e. the bank) rai&s;es the price of wheat and flour, to the benefit of the country farmer indeed, but to the damage of the merchant in town, who mu&s;t pay more for them than before; if our country produce was all con&s;umed in the &s;tate, the&s;e mi&s;chiefs and benefits would balance one another; becau&s;e, what one citizen lo&s;t another would gain, but a very con&s;iderable part of our produce is exported and paid for by foreigners; and therefore the higher the price, the greater is the benefit to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>BUT this evil complained of <HI>does not originate in the bank,</HI> but in quite different cau&s;es, many monied men who u&s;ed to lend money on intere&s;t, have lo&s;t their money <HI>by the war, by the enemy, or by the depreciation of money, or by eva&s;ions of payment</HI> which have been introdu|ced &s;ince, and, of cour&s;e, have no money to lend; and all that have any, have found the danger of letting it in the old way &s;o great, that few will venter into it a|gain; and la&s;tly, the objection is hardly true in fact; <HI>be|cau&s;e any man in the country who has credit enough in town to get a good indor&s;er, can have money out of the bank, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ell as a merchant of the city.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="19" REF="020129_0018_0FADEC1D1513A140">3. ANOTHER objection to the bank is, <HI>that the di&s;counts of the bank, make money of &s;uch ea&s;y acquirement, that it induces merchants to overtrade their &s;tocks, and di&s;&s;ipating young fellows to &s;pend money fa&s;ter, than they would do, if it was harder to get it.</HI> I believe this is all true, and not only ari&s;es from, but is an actual proof of, the great convenience and public utility of the bank: 'Tis ju&s;t of the nature of all other objections a|gain&s;t a good thing, becau&s;e, it may be made an ill u&s;e of, and will prove that a good farm is wor&s;e than a bad one, becau&s;e, it makes the farmer lazy, ina&s;|much as a little work on good land, will rai&s;e his bread; good victuals and drink are wo&s;e than bad, becau&s;e gluttons and drunkards will eat and drink to exce&s;s; a loving wife is wor&s;e than a cro&s;s one, be|cau&s;e, her hu&s;band will be apt to lie in bed too long with her; and riches are wor&s;e than poverty, becau&s;e they introduce luxury, &amp;c. &amp;c.

<P N="5">5. ANOTHER <HI>objection is, that the great wealth of the bank will give it an undue influence on the government.</HI> There is no doubt but wealth creates influence; but 'tis that &s;ort of influence which has ever been found &s;afe to the &s;tate. Our bank is a &s;ort of mercantile in|&s;titution, and the influence of merchants is the &s;afe&s;t of any that can affect a government. The <HI>par&s;on</HI> lives on the <HI>&s;ins</HI> of the people, the <HI>doctor</HI> on their <HI>di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>lawyer</HI> on their <HI>di&s;putes</HI> and <HI>quarrels</HI> (and I &s;uppo&s;e they all think they ought to pray for their dai|ly bread) but the merchant lives on the <HI>wealth</HI> of the people. He never wi&s;hes for a poor cu&s;tomer or a poor country; the richer his cu&s;tomers are, the more they can purcha&s;e, and the better payments they can make to him. The merchant has every inducement to &s;eek, and promote the wealth of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>WEALTH <HI>rarely begets &s;edition</HI>; that baneful pro|duction generally &s;prings from <HI>poverty, vice, and di&s;ap|pointment.</HI> The&s;e are the characters which find an in|tere&s;t in fi&s;hing in troubled waters. We have perhaps no in&s;tance of a nation ruined by its merchants. I never heard of a &s;tate di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by its bank, but in&s;tan|ces are plenty enough of &s;tates &s;erved and &s;aved by their bank.&mdash;On the whole I think it ab&s;urd to bani&s;h wealth from a &s;tate for fear it &s;hould gain <HI>too much influence</HI> in government, or <HI>generate faction</HI> in the &s;tate; but of all kinds of wealth, <HI>a bank would be the lea&s;t likely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">roduce the&s;e effects,</HI> becau&s;e the &s;tockholders of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> are made up of all parties, and are as likely to

time, but they form no conclu&s;ion again&s;t the princi|ples of the bank or its natural utility. <HI>The &s;ame novelty of the thing prevented a general confidence in the bank at fir&s;t among the people.</HI>&mdash;'Twas further unlucky, that the bank was fir&s;t opened <HI>at a time when the people had &s;o often been di&s;appointed and deceived in every &s;pecies of public propo&s;itions and engagements relative to money, that they knew not who they could tru&s;t</HI>; they he&s;itated lea&s;t they &s;hould be taken in by the bank, as they had often been, by very numerous propo&s;als to which their con|fidence had been courted. But the fidelity of the Di|rectors, and the perfect punctuality of all payments at the bank, &s;oon got the better of this diffidence, and the bank gained an almo&s;t univer&s;al credit and confi|dence among the people, even among its profe&s;&s;ed and bittere&s;t enemies.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER difficulty with the bank has ever been, that <HI>the balance of foreign trade has been again&s;t Ameri|ca, ever &s;ince the bank was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI> This has occa&s;ioned &s;uch great exportations of ca&s;h as render it &s;carce, and of cour&s;e embarra&s;&s;es all ca&s;h bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P N="3">3.

heard all this time again&s;t the bank, <HI>as an in&s;titution hurtful to the &s;tates or individuals,</HI> but its mi&s;chiefs were made to grow out of its great utility, and &s;alutary ef|fects.</P>
<P>THE directors, with much trouble, <HI>put a &s;top to this plan,</HI> by &s;trongly urging the fatal con&s;equences ari&s;ing <HI>from two capital banks operating in one city,</HI> which might, perhaps, <HI>act in oppo&s;ition to each other,</HI> and of cour&s;e, de&s;troy each other. They finally per&s;uaded the &s;ub|&s;cribers to the new bank, to relinqui&s;h their &s;cheme, and join the old bank, and add their &s;ub&s;criptions to it, which they at la&s;t agreed to, and &s;o that difficulty was got over.</P>
<P>BUT the bank did not re&s;t long, for &s;oon after this la&s;t mentioned difficulty &s;ub&s;ided, there aro&s;e a pretty numerous party in the &s;tate who adopted the <HI>&s;cheme of paper money to be i&s;&s;ued by our General A&s;&s;embly.</HI> All the difficulty was to make it pa&s;s equal to hard money, and they had little hopes of this, unle&s;s the bank would give it a currency, which every body &s;ee plain enough that the Directors could not do. The bank therefore and the &s;cheme for paper money, were con&s;idered as incon&s;i&s;tent with each other, and one or the other, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t fall. The party for paper money determined at once, that the bank mu&s;t be &s;acrificed and united with all its other enemies, to decry it as an in&s;titution <HI>injurious to the &s;tate, and incompatible with the public &s;afety.</HI> They rai&s;ed (and declaimed upon) ma|ny objections to it, the mo&s;t material of which (that I heard of) I have con&s;idered already in the foregoing pages of this e&s;&s;ay. The matter was carried &s;o far, that an act of the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate was obtained, and pa&s;&s;ed September 13, 1785, repealing the act of April 1, 1782, which granted the &s;tate charter to the bank, and al&s;o the act of March 18, 1782, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ade it felony to counterfeit the bank bills, &amp;c. and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tands the matter at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="27" REF="020129_0026_0FADEC27A3656AA8">3. I NOW proceed <HI>to make &s;ome remarks on the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the bank.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. NOTWITHSTANDING all the difficulties above mentioned, the bank is now in good condition; its in|ternal &s;trength is not weakened; its funds are not di|mini&s;hed, though its energy and extent of operati|on has been indeed &s;omewhat le&s;&s;ened, as was ob&s;erved before.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent funds or wealth of the bank, con&s;i&s;ts in, 1. <HI>the bank &s;tock, about</HI> 900,000 Mexican dollars. 2. In the <HI>di&s;counted bills</HI> now in the bank and payable to it. 3. The <HI>ca&s;h depo&s;ited</HI> in the bank for &s;afe keep|ing, and which the owners may draw out whenever they plea&s;e. 4. The <HI>furniture and uten&s;ils</HI> of the bank, and any <HI>&s;mall profits</HI> which may have lain over or ari&s;en &s;ince the la&s;t dividend.</P>
<P>THE debts of the bank to be paid out of their &s;tock are, 1. All the <HI>bank bills now in circulation.</HI> 2. All the <HI>bank credits</HI> or balances due to &s;uch per&s;ons as have depo&s;its in the bank; N. B. <HI>When both the&s;e are deducted from the &s;tock, they leave a balance of about</HI> 900,000 <HI>dollars in favor of the bank.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE legal e&s;tabli&s;hment of this bank is derived from the charter of Congre&s;s, of December 31, 1781; from the charter of the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, of March 9, 1782; from the charter of Delaware &s;tate of Feb. 2, 1786; from the recognizance of the char|ter of Congre&s;s, publicly made by the &s;tate of Penn|&s;ylvania, in their act of March 18, 1782, and their charter of incorporation of the bank, by their act of April 1, 1782: But 'tis to be ob&s;erved that <HI>the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> la&s;t mentioned</HI> acts of the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, were repealed by their act of September 13, 1785.

<P><PB N="28" REF="020129_0027_0FADEC285F160DB8"><HI>Que&s;tion</HI> 1. WHETHER <HI>Congre&s;s has a right to e&s;tabli&s;h a national bank, &s;o as to make it &s;uch a legal in&s;titution as the laws of the &s;tates of the union are obliged to ac|knowledge or recognize?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. I ANSWER, this objection is grounded principly on the &s;econd article of the confederation, viz. "Each &s;tate retains its &s;overeignty, freedom and independence; and every power, juri&s;diction and right, which is not <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> delegated to the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;|&s;embled." But the an&s;wer is ea&s;y, for, 1. A power of incorporating a national bank never did exi&s;t in a|ny of the &s;tates. They might erect banks, or any other corporation, and call them by what <HI>name</HI> they plea&s;ed, but their <HI>authority,</HI> like that of all their other laws, mu&s;t be limited by the bounds of the &s;tate, and could not extend beyound them. Nor,</P>
<P N="2">2. DOES this act of Congre&s;s limit the power of any of the &s;tates, they &s;till retain and may exerci&s;e every power, juri&s;diction and right of incorporating banks, as fully as ever they had them: For, 3. the &s;aid &s;econd article of confederation, does not re&s;train Congre&s;s from having or exerci&s;ing any &s;overeignty, power, ju|ri&s;diction or right, whatever; it only re&s;trains them from exerci&s;ing it in &s;uch manner as to deprive the &s;tates of it. Notwith&s;tanding all the &s;overeignty and power of Congre&s;s, they &s;hall ever be &s;o limited, that each &s;tate &s;hall retain its own &s;overeignty, power, &amp;c. concurrent juri&s;dictions often exi&s;t together without the lea&s;t re&s;traint of each other.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE act of Congre&s;s incorporating the bank, <HI>is an act of finance,</HI> they con&s;idered it mo&s;t expre&s;sly as a means, a very important <HI>means of finance,</HI> which is a branch of power that mo&s;t undoubtedly falls within their authority or juri&s;diction. They are not <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mpowered, indeed, to appoint a Financier, give him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ructions, receive his plans, or form a bank. But,
<PB N="29" REF="020129_0028_0FADEC2958817BB8">
as all tho&s;e were nece&s;&s;ary means of promoting the general intere&s;t, the liberties and general welfare of the &s;tates, which are the grand and mo&s;t acknow|ledged objects of the confederation, they are doubtle&s;s comprehended within its powers.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE confederation (article 9) empowers Con|gre&s;s to <HI>borrow money</HI> on the credit of the &s;tates, and <HI>this certainly implies a power to find or procure &s;omebody who will lend it to them,</HI> and this they effected to a great degree by incorporating the bank, which &s;uppli|ed them to a very large amount&mdash;They owed the bank, at one time 400,000 Mexican dollars, for money lent them by the bank, and all the monies lent at different times to Congre&s;s, and to the different <HI>departments</HI> un|der their direction, amounted to above two million of Mexican dollars; and the&s;e loans were of &s;uch capital and e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice in that mo&s;t deranged and weak &s;tate of the public finances, that (in the opinion of tho&s;e be&s;t acquainted with the matter) the war could not have been continued without them.</P>
<P>THE bank al&s;o lent at different times to this &s;tate for its defence and other public purpo&s;es, above 130000 dollars, which certainly proves that the bank was very convenient to the public, and very nece&s;&s;ary to the general welfare and general intere&s;t of it, and there|fore mu&s;t be comprehended in the powers granted to Congre&s;s, to manage the general intere&s;t, and &s;ecure the liberties, defence and general welfare of the &s;tates.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE <HI>independence, defence, and almo&s;t the very exi&s;tence, of our pre&s;ent political e&s;tabli&s;hments, depend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the bank, in ca&s;e of an inva&s;ion of an enemy,</HI> for 'tis v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ry certain that in &s;uch ca&s;e, due and nece&s;&s;ary op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+&s;ition and defence could not be made by a depreciatin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> currency; nor do I think it would be po&s;&s;ible for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Congre&s;s or &s;tates to borrow el&s;ewhere, monies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+cient, and in &s;ea&s;on, for our defence, or to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="30" REF="020129_0029_0FADEC2D1846E7A0">
bills enough for that purpo&s;e, which would not de|preciate.&mdash;I apprehend I &s;hall not be called on for a|ny proof of this; I therefore go on to infer, that Con|gre&s;s, who are expre&s;sly empowered to &s;ecure <HI>the de|fence, liberties, welfare and general intere&s;ts</HI> of the &s;tates, are, of cour&s;e, empowered <HI>to in&s;titute a bank,</HI> which is &s;o <HI>apparently and e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to all the&s;e great purpo&s;es</HI>&mdash;It follows then, that tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the bank, oppo&s;e the e&s;&s;ential means of our defence, and, of cour&s;e, lay us open to de&s;truction, the fir&s;t time any enemy &s;hall invade our country.</P>
<P N="5">5. IF we &s;hould admit that there was a defect in the powers of Congre&s;s to incorporate the bank, yet <HI>that defect is amply &s;upplied by the &s;ub&s;equent recognizance of the &s;tates, their acquie&s;cence in the in&s;titution, and parti|cipation of the benefits of it for a cour&s;e of years; for a &s;ub&s;equent con&s;ent of the principal,</HI> is as good as <HI>a previ|ous order,</HI> to every purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hment or legiti|mation of any act of <HI>a &s;ub&s;titute.</HI></P>
<P>ON the whole then, I conclude that the bank of North-America, by the ordinance of Congre&s;s for its incorporation, is a well e&s;tabli&s;hed and legal in&s;titution, and as &s;uch ought to be con&s;idered and recognized by all the &s;tates, both in their laws and all judicial pro|ceedings, as far as the &s;ame may affect the &s;aid bank.</P>
<P>QUESTION II. <HI>What is the weaning, energy and ope|ration of the act of this &s;tate of March</HI> 18, 1782, <HI>making it felony to counterfeit the &s;eal or bills of the bank?</HI> I an|&s;wer,</P>

the legi&s;lature of this &s;tate would by a mo&s;t &s;olemn act, make it felony, i. e. death, to counterfeit the &s;eal and bills of any number of men, who had no legal right to make a &s;eal, i&s;&s;ue bills, or a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves any o|ther powers, liberties or privileges of a corporate body.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT <HI>act implies the mo&s;t &s;olemn con&s;ent of this &s;tate to the afore&s;aid ordinance of Congre&s;s, and carries in it further, the nature and energy of a &s;olemn &s;tipulation and compact</HI> of this &s;tate with Congre&s;s, i. e. with all the &s;tates, to &s;upport that public mea&s;ure of the union, with all the weight and authority which this &s;tate could give to it, in all the particulars or clau&s;es mentioned or enacted in the &s;aid law. The public and vigorous &s;upport of the particular &s;tates, gives great force to an act of Congre&s;s, though it might be con&s;idered as ful|ly legal without it, gives confidence in the public mea|&s;ures, and is a good rea&s;on and &s;trong inducement to engage the public councils of the particular &s;tates, as well as individuals, &s;trongly to exert them&s;elves and ri&s;k their fortunes therein.

<P N="5">5. WHATEVER might be the effect of this act on the bank, by way of aiding the legality of its e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, or giving it &s;upport as a continental in&s;titution, there is no doubt but it had this one perfect effect, viz. It incorporated the &s;ub&s;cribers to the bank into a legal company, and in&s;tituted a complete, e&s;tabli&s;hed, and legal bank of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> though by the name of the pre&s;ident, directors and company of the bank of <HI>North-America,</HI> for any &s;tate may give what name or title they plea&s;e to their corporations, though they can't extend their authority or privileges beyond their own juri&s;diction. This act therefore undoubtedly brought the bank under the cognizance of the laws of Penn|&s;ylvania, and entitled the company, and every propri|etor of it, to the full protection of the&s;e laws.

<P N="1">1.

their fortunes in the bank, and the legi&s;lature pa&s;&s;ed the &s;aid acts in &s;upport of it, and &s;o the bar|gain was fini&s;hed. I take it that, when the act of the legi&s;lature ve&s;ts in, or grants to, any individual or company of men, on valuable con&s;ideration (i. e. for which the grantee pays his money) any valuable right, privilege, intere&s;t or property, the <HI>grantees in&s;tantly be|come legally &s;eized of &s;uch right, which thereby becomes as much guarantied or warranted to them by the law of the land,</HI> as is any other property whatever, which they may or can po&s;&s;e&s;s, and therefore they can't be deve&s;ted or de|prived of it by any act of the legi&s;lature, any more than of their lands, cattle, furniture or any other e&s;tate, of which they are lawful owners, and which they hold under the full protection of the law.</P>

The great and u&s;ual circulati|on of ca&s;h (through which 37,000,000 dollars were negociated la&s;t year) would at once be &s;topped. 2. All di&s;counted bills mu&s;t immediately be paid or &s;ued, which would ruin very many, I think I may &s;ay, &s;cores of &s;ub&s;tantial families; and their failures would occa&s;ion, 3. A great lo&s;s to the bank, and of cour&s;e to the &s;tockholders. And 4. The &s;tockholders mu&s;t lye out of their money till the bank accounts could be &s;ettled, which would probably be &s;ome years. 5. All the monies belonging to &s;ub&s;cribers out of the &s;tate, mu&s;t be carried out of it, as fa&s;t as they could be collected; and 6. A mo&s;t fatal wound would be given to our credit, as well as to all our trade, and e|very kind of bu&s;ine&s;s which depends on the circulation of ca&s;h.&mdash;Who but an enemy would wi&s;h for &s;uch ca|lamities, or promote the means of them?</P>
<P>I will conclude my e&s;&s;ay on this very important and in|tere&s;ting &s;ubject, with only ob&s;erving, that I have <HI>&s;tated the facts</HI> with all care, and the be&s;t information, and I be|lieve, with exactne&s;s and truth; &s;hould I have erred, I am ready to &s;ubmit to better information; <HI>the &s;entiments and rea&s;onings</HI> are open and obvious to every one, and, I wi&s;h, may be received and con&s;idered in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e light of importance in which they appear to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

have no intere&s;t in the &s;ubject di&s;tinct from that of my fellow citizens, and as I would not be willing to be mi&s;led my&s;elf, &s;o neither do I wi&s;h to lead them into error. <HI>Magna e&s;t veritas and praevalebit.</HI></P>
