<BIBL>HEBREWS XIII. 17.</BIBL>
<Q>"For they watch for your &s;ouls as they that mu&s;t give account."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NOTHING is more evident, than that men are prejudiced against the go&s;pel. It is from this &s;ource, that tho&s;e who are for the de|fence of it, meet with &s;o much contempt. It is true, they are frail, &s;inful du&s;t and a&s;hes, in common with other men; yet on account of the important emba&s;&s;y with which they are entru&s;t|ed&punc; it is agreeable to the unerring dictates of in|&s;piration, to e&s;teem them very highly in love for their works &s;ake. 1 The&s;. v.13.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this &s;entiment, was the de&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle in this ver&s;e: "Obey them that have the rule over you, and &s;ubmit your&s;elves." He was far from inculcating any thing that might seem to confront what the Apo&s;tle Peter has enjoined, 1 Pet. v.3. Neither as being lords over God's heritage. The word &s;ignifies to <HI>lead, guide,</HI> or <HI>direct.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;e's paraphra&s;e.</NOTE></P>
<P>Our text contains an important motive, to ex|cite to attention and re&s;pect, that is due to the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, on account of their relation to him; and that is the a&s;pect their work
<PB N="4" REF="023437_0003_0FBF70215B6ED7A8" MS="y">
has to a judgement-day: For they watch for your &s;ouls, as they that mu&s;t quickly give ac|count. They are amenable to their great Lord and Ma&s;ter for every &s;ermon they preach, and mo&s;t give an account of the reception they and their work meet with, among their hearers.&mdash;Under the influence of &s;uch a thought, let us take notice of a few things, &s;uppo&s;ed by the work, a&s;&s;igned to mini&s;ters in the text.&mdash;Say &s;omething with re&s;pect to their character.&mdash;Whence it appears that they mu&s;t give account.&mdash;When they may be &s;aid to be properly influ|enced by &s;uch con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">I. There are &s;everal ideas &s;uggested by the work a&s;&s;igned to go&s;pel mini&s;ters in the text: which is, to <HI>watch for &s;ouls.</HI> This &s;upposes,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">l is of va&s;t importance; el&s;e why &s;o much attention paid to it, as to have a guard to in&s;pect it? All tho&s;e injunctions we find inter&s;per&s;ed through the &s;acred pages, to watch|men to be faithful, are &s;o many evidences of the worth of mens &s;ouls. What renders them &s;o valuable, is the important relation they &s;tand in to their Maker. The perfections of the Deity are more illu&s;trated in the redemption of fallen men, than they would have been the &s;alva|tion of apo&s;tate angels; el&s;e why were the latter pa&s;&s;ed by, while God cho&s;e the former as the objects of his attention? God hath from eternity appointed a proper number, for the di&s;play of his mercy and ju&s;tice; means are nece&s;&s;ary to fit
<PB N="5" REF="023437_0004_0FBF7022DBFA5698" MS="y">
them for the Ma&s;ter's u&s;e; &s;o that the &s;oul in this view, is of infinite importance.</P>
<P N="2">2. Watchmen over the &s;ouls of men implies that they are prone to neglect them, or to be in|attentive to their &s;ouls. When one is &s;et to in|&s;pect, or watch over another, it &s;uppo&s;es &s;ome kind of incapacity that he is under to take care of him&s;elf. The &s;cripture repre&s;ents mankind by nature as <HI>fools, madmen</HI>; and being in a &s;tate of <HI>darken&s;s,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Men in general are very &s;agacious with re|&s;pect to temporal affairs, and di&s;play much na|tural wit and ingenuity, in contriving and ac|compli&s;hing evil de&s;igns; but to do good, they have no knowledge. Jer. iv.22. This is an evidence that their inability to fore&s;ee danger, and provide again&s;t it, is of the moral kind. Was there a dispo&s;ition in mankind, corre&s;pond|ent to their natural powers, to &s;ecure the eternal interest of their &s;ouls in the way God has pro|&s;cribbed, watchmen would in a great mea&s;ure be u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. The work and office of gospel mini&s;ters, sugge&s;t&s; the idea of enemies invading; that there is a controver&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and danger approach|ing. When &s;oldiers are called forth, and cen|tinels stand upon the wall, it denotes war. The &s;ouls of men are environed with ten thou&s;and enemies, that are &s;eeking their ruin. Earth and hell are combined together to de&s;troy. How many already have fell victims to their ferocity!
<PB N="6" REF="023437_0005_0FBF702598949A40" MS="y">
The infernal powers are daily dragging their prey to the pri&s;on of hell. Men have rebelled again&s;t God, and made him their enemy; yea, all creatures, and all events, are working the eternal mi&s;ery of the finally impenitent &s;inner.</P>
<P N="4">4. We are taught in the text and elsewhere, that the work of a gospel mini&s;ter is not with the temporal, but the &s;piritual concerns of men: They watch for <HI>&s;ouls.</HI> Their conver&s;ation is not to be about worldly affairs, but things that relate to Christ's kingdom, which involves the everla&s;ting concerns of mens &s;ouls. When a mini&s;ter's affections are upon this world, his vi&s;its among his people will be barren; he will inquire about the outward circum&s;tances of his flock; and perhaps, from pecuniary motives, re|joice at &s;uch prosperity: But as though that was of greate&s;t concern, he will have nothing to &s;ay&mdash; with re&s;pect to the health, and pro&s;perity of their &s;ouls: Have no joys or &s;orrows, to expre&s;s, on account of the fruitful or more lifeless state of the inward man.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us &s;ay &s;omething with re&s;pect to the character of a &s;piritual watchman.</P>
<P>Natural endownments, embelli&s;hed with a good education, are qualifications &s;o obviou&s;ly requi&s;ite in an evangelical mini&s;ter, that it is needle&s;s we in&s;ist upon them at this time; and that the inte|re&s;t of religion has, and &s;till continues, greatly to &s;uffer for the want of them, is equally noto|rious.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="023437_0006_0FBF702779200600">In the early ages of chri&s;tianity, men were miraculously qualified and called into the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try; but we are far from be|lieving, that this is the pre&s;ent mode by which ordinary mini&s;ters are introduced.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is nece&s;&s;ary that tho&s;e who engage in this work, love the cau&s;e in which they profe&s;s to be embarked; that the love of Chri&s;t be &s;hed abroad in the heart: Hence our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, by tho&s;e repeated interrogations to Simon whether he loved him, has let before us the importance of this qualification in a &s;piritual Shepherd. The &s;ad con&s;equences of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e into the ar|my, who are in heart enemies to the common|wealth, have often taught men to be careful in this particular. The tru&s;t repo&s;ed in a watch|man is &s;uch, as renders him capable of great de|triment to the community. He that undertakes in this work from &s;ecular motives, will meet with di&s;appointment. What a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity is this, for a man to commend religion to others, while he is a &s;tranger to it him&s;elf! "The pious preacher will commend the Saviour, from the per&s;onal fund of his own experience." Being &s;mitten with the love of Chri&s;t him&s;elf with what zeal and fervor will he &s;peak of the divine glory! Love to Chri&s;t will tend to make a min|i&s;ter faithful and &s;ucce&s;sful. The importance of this point, urges me to be copious on the &s;ubject, were it not too obvious to require a long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. Wi&s;dom and prudence are important quali|fications
<PB N="8" REF="023437_0007_0FBF702DD8542E10">
in mini&s;ters; hence that injunction of the great preacher, Mat. x.16. Be ye there|fore wi&s;e as &s;erpents, and harmle&s;s as doves. He is a man of &s;piritual under&s;tanding, who&s;e &s;oul is irradiated with the beams of the Son of Right|eou&s;ne&s;s,&mdash;has received an auction from the holy one,&mdash;is taught by the word and &s;pirit, and walks in the light of God's countenance. He has &s;een the deceit of his own heart,&mdash;knows the intrigues of the enemy,&mdash;&s;ees the many &s;nares to which the &s;ouls of men are expo&s;ed,&mdash;and not being ignorant of the devices of &s;atan, he will endeavour to carry on the &s;piritual campaign, with that care and prudence, that he &s;hall not get advantage. He knows that he has a &s;ubtle enemy to oppo&s;e, and human nature, replete with enmity again&s;t the go&s;pel; and will endea|vour, in every effort, to conduct with that wi&s;|dom and circum&s;pection, as &s;hall appear mo&s;t likely to prove &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P N="3">3. Patience is another qualification very ne|ce&s;&s;ary in a &s;piritual watchman. His brea&s;t be|ing in&s;pired with love to the cau&s;e, he will &s;tand the &s;torms of temptation; will not be di&s;hearten|ed by all the fatigues, and &s;ufferings, to which his work expo&s;es him; but will endure hardne&s;s as a good &s;oldier of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. Courage and fortitude, mu&s;t con&s;titute a part of the character of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter. A &s;entinel, who is worthy of that &s;tation, will not fear the formidable appearance of the enemy, nor tremble at their menaces. None of the&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="023437_0008_0FBF702EEC7495B0">
things will move him, neither will he count his life dear unto him, to defend a cau&s;e &s;o very im|portant. He has the &s;pirit of the intrepid Ne|hemiah, "Should &s;uch a man as I flee?" He &s;tands fa&s;t in the faith; quits him&s;elf like a man, and is &s;trong.</P>
<P N="5">5. Nor mu&s;t we forget to mention vigilance, or clo&s;e attention to the bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;igned him, as an e&s;&s;ential qualification in a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t. A man does not an&s;wer the idea of a watchman, unle&s;s his mind is engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s. The word, which we have rendered <HI>watch,</HI> in the text, &s;ignifies, in the original, to awake, and ab&s;tain from &s;leeping.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Legh's Critica Sacra.</HI></NOTE> Indeed all the pur|po&s;es of a watch &s;et upon the wall, are fru&s;tra|ted, if he &s;leeps on guard; thereby him&s;elf, and the whole army, are liable to fall an ea&s;y prey to the cruel depredations of the enemy. The &s;pi|ritual watchman is not to &s;leep, but to watch the fir&s;t motion of the enemy, and give the alarm; le&s;t &s;ouls peri&s;h through his drow&s;ine&s;s and inattention.</P>
<P>Some further ob&s;ervations with re&s;pect to the work of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, will be made in their place. We pa&s;s,&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">III. To &s;hew, That mini&s;ters mu&s;t give re|count to God of their conduct, more e&s;pe|cially as it re&s;pects the people of their charge.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="023437_0009_0FBF7030694D5D40">This &s;olemn con&s;ideration is &s;ugge&s;ted in the text:&mdash;'Tis the de&s;ign of preaching, to make things ready for the day of judgment, 2 Cor. ii.16. To the one we are the &s;avour of death unto death; and to the other, the &s;avour of life unto life: We are fitting men for the Ma&s;ter's use,&mdash;preparing affairs for that deci&s;ive court. This &s;uppo&s;es, that things mu&s;t be laid open before the great a&s;&s;embly at the day of judgment; or why is it that there are &s;o many things that re|late therefore, and are preparatives therefor.</P>
<P>The work of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter has a peculiar relation to futurity: An approaching judgment is that, to which every &s;ubject is pointing, and which renders every &s;entiment to be inculcated, va&s;tly &s;olemn, and intere&s;ting. Mini&s;ters are accountable creatures in common with other men; and we have the unerring te&s;timony of &s;cripture, that God &s;hall bring every work into judgment, with every &s;ecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. Eccle. xii.14. If there is none of our conduct too minute to be cognizable, we may well conclude, that &s;uch im|portant affairs, that relate to the work and office of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, will not pa&s;s unnoticed.</P>
<P>Arguments may be taken from the names given to the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, that they mu&s;t give account. They are called <HI>&s;oldier, amba&s;&s;adors, &s;ervants, &s;tewards, angels,</HI> &amp;c. Which points out the relation they and their work &s;tands in to God: That they are &s;ent of God, and are ame|nable to him that &s;ent them; as a &s;ervant or
<PB N="11" REF="023437_0010_0FBF7031D8230038">
&s;teward, is to give account to his Lord and Ma&s;ter, with re&s;pect to his faithfulne&s;s, in the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. God tells Ezekiel, If watch|men are not faithful, and &s;ouls peri&s;h through their neglect, that he would require their blood at the hands of &s;uch carele&s;s watchmen. It is evident, that primitive mini&s;ters were influenced to faithfulne&s;s from a view of the &s;olemn account they expected to give at the day of judgment. This gave ri&s;e to tho&s;e words, Acts iv.19. 'But Peter and John an&s;wered and &s;aid unto them, Whether it be right in the &s;ight of God to Hear|ken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.' If God's omni&s;cience is a motive to faithfulne&s;s, it mu&s;t be in this view, that he will not let our conduct pa&s;s unnoticed, but call us an account.</P>
<P>It was approaching judgment that engro&s;&s;ed the attention of St. Paul, and made him exhort Timothy, to &s;tudy to approve him&s;elf unto God. This made the beloved di&s;ciple &s;peak of having boldne&s;s in the day of judgment, 1 John, iv.17.</P>
<P>The divine glory is an object only worthy of attention; and to di&s;play his holy character, was the de&s;ign of God in creation; as there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> other beings exi&s;ting antecedent thereto, to at|tract the mind of Jehovah; and we are &s;ure that God is pur&s;uing the &s;ame thing &s;till, and al|ways will. He is in one mind, and who can turn him? Job xxiii.13. There is no conceiva|ble object that bears any proportion with the glory of God; and for him ever to aim at any thing el&s;e, would be incompatible with his per|fections
<PB N="12" REF="023437_0011_0FBF703A0D3FEC08">
The day of judgment is de&s;igned to be a comment on all other days; at which time God's government of the world, and their con|duct towards him, will be publicly inve&s;tigated, that the equity of divine admini&s;tration may ap|pear con&s;picuous before the a&s;&s;embled univer&s;e. It is called a day when the &s;on of man is <HI>revealed.</HI> Luk. xvii.30. The honour of God requires that matters be publicly and particularly attend|ed to; that evidences are &s;ummoned at this open court: Hence the &s;aints are to judge the world. 1 Cor. vi.2.</P>
<P>It will conduce to the mutual happine&s;s of faithful mini&s;ters and people, to have matter laid open before the bar of God, as in the words fol|lowing our text, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief. The apo&s;tle &s;peaks of &s;ome mini&s;ters and people who &s;hould have reciprocal joy in the day of the Lord Je&s;us;&mdash;which &s;up|po&s;es, that mini&s;ters, and the people of their charge, are to meet another day as having &s;ome|thing &s;pecial with each other. The connexion between mini&s;ters and people is &s;uch, as renders them capable of &s;aying much for, or again&s;t, the people of their charge; and of hearers making the &s;ame ob&s;ervations with re&s;pect to their teach|ers; and in this way the mercy and ju&s;tice of God will appear illu&s;trious.</P>
<P>Since, therefore, the work of go&s;pel mini&s;ters has &s;uch a near relation to a judgment day;&mdash;&s;ince they are accountable creatures, and their work &s;o momentous;&mdash;&s;ince it is a &s;entiment that
<PB N="13" REF="023437_0012_0FBF703ADDDE4550">
has had &s;o powerful influence on all true mini&s;ters in all ages of the world: Al&s;o their connexion is &s;uch as to render them capable of laying many things relating to the people of their charge. Above all, &s;ince the di&s;plays of divine glory are &s;o highly concerned in this matter; we may without he&s;itation adopt the idea in the text, That mini&s;ters have a &s;olemn account to give to their great Lord and Ma&s;ter, how they di&s;charge the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them.</P>
<P N="4">IV. We are to inquire, what influence &s;uch con&s;iderations will have on the true mini&s;|ters of Chri&s;t; or when they may be &s;aid to preach and act as tho&s;e who mu&s;t give ac|count.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who properly expect to give account, will be very careful to examine them&s;elves with re&s;pect to the motives by which they are influ|enced, to undertake in this work. He will view him&s;elf acting in the pre&s;ence of an heart-&s;earch|ing God, who requires truth in the inward part, and will &s;hortly call him to an account for all the exerci&s;es of his heart. He will &s;earch every corner of his &s;oul, whether the divine honour, or &s;omething el&s;e, is the object of his pur&s;uit. He has been taught, by the rectitude of the di|vine law, that God will not pa&s;s by tran&s;gre&s;|sion, but will judge the &s;ecrets of men. The work will appear &s;o great, that nature will re|coil at the thought, like Jeremiah, "Ah, Lord God! behold, I cannot &s;peak; for I am a child." Or with the great apo&s;tle, "Who is &s;ufficient
<PB N="14" REF="023437_0013_0FBF703C5C4F2970">
for the&s;e things." The true di&s;ciple of Je&s;us will not thru&s;t him&s;elf forward into the mini&s;try, like a heedle&s;s u&s;urper; but with the greate&s;t caution, and &s;elf-diffidence.</P>
<P N="2">2. A faithful Watchman will manife&s;t that he expects to give account, by being very careful to know his duty, and will take all proper ways which are in his power, to become acquainted with it. He will &s;tudy, as the apo&s;tle directs Timothy, to &s;hew him&s;elf approved unto God. He will give attendance to Reading, Meditation and Prayer; will often call in divine aid, on ac|count of his own in&s;ufficiency. As a faithful &s;ol|dier will be careful to understand his duty; &s;o the &s;piritual Watchman, will adhere clo&s;ely to the word of God for his guide and directory.</P>
<P N="3">3. A mini&s;ter that watches for &s;ouls as one who expects to give account, will have done to ple&s;e but God. When he &s;tudies his Sermons, this will not be the enquiry, "How &s;hall I form my di&s;cour&s;e &s;o as to plea&s;e and gratify the humours of men, and get their applau&s;e?" but "How &s;hall I preach &s;o as to do honor to God, and meet with the approbation of my Judge?" this will be his daily reque&s;t at the throne of grace. This will be ten thou&s;and times better to him than the vain flattery of men. His di&s;cour&s;es will not be calculated to gratify the carnal heart, but he will not &s;hun to declare the whole coun&s;el of God.</P>
<P>The &s;olemn account that the faithful mini&s;ter expects to give another day, will direct him in the
<PB N="15" REF="023437_0014_0FBF7042622BB610">
choice of his &s;ubjects; he will dwell upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> things which have a more direct relation to the eternal world. He will not entertain his audi|ence with empty &s;peculations; or vain philo&s;ophy; but with things that concern their everla&s;ting welfare. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucified, will be the great topic and darling theme of his preach|ing. If he means to &s;ave &s;ouls, like a &s;kilful phy|&s;ician, he will endeavor to lead his patients into a view of their maladies, and then point them to a bleeding Saviour as the only way of recovery. The faithful Watchman will give the alarm at the approach of the enemy, will blow the trumpet in the ears of the &s;leeping &s;inner, and endeavour to awake him.</P>
<P N="4">4. The pious preacher will endeavour to adapt his di&s;cour&s;es to the under&s;tanding of his hearers. "He will not be ambitious of &s;aying fine things to win applau&s;e, but of &s;aying u&s;eful things, to win &s;ouls." He will con&s;ider that he has the weak as well as &s;trong, children as well as adults to &s;peak to, and that he mu&s;t be accountable for the blood of their &s;ouls, if they peri&s;h through his neglect. This will influence him to &s;tudy <HI>plainne&s;s</HI> more than politene&s;s; al&s;o he will la|bour to accommodate his &s;ermons to the different &s;tates, or circum&s;tances of his hearers; he will have comforting and encouraging le&s;&s;ons to &s;ee before the children of God; while the terrors of the law are to be proclaimed in the ears of the impenitent. He will &s;trive to preach di&s;tingui&s;h|ing, that every hearer may have his portion.&mdash;The awful &s;cenes of approaching judgment, will
<PB N="16" REF="023437_0015_0FBF7044D15BA638">
have an influence on the Chri&s;tian preacher with re&s;pect to the <HI>manner</HI> in which he will deliver him|self.

He will not &s;ub&s;titute a whining tone in the room of a Sermon; which, to &s;peak no wor&s;e of it, is a &s;ort of &s;atire upon the Go&s;pel, tending greatly to depreciate its &s;o|lemnity and importance, and to bring it into con|tempt; but the judgment will appear &s;o awful, and his attention &s;o captivated with it, that his accents will be the re&s;ult of a mind hone&s;tly, and engagedly taken up with &s;ubject va&s;tly impor|tant. "Such a preacher will not come into the pulpit as an actor comes upon the &s;tage, to per&s;on|ate feigned character, and forget his real one; to utter &s;entiments, or repre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ions not his own.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fordyce.</HI></NOTE> It is not to di&s;play his talents ; but like one who feels the weight of eternal things, he will not addre&s;s his hearers as though judgments was a mere empty &s;ound; but viewing eternity ju&s;t before him, and a congregation on the fron|tiers of it, who&s;e eternal &s;tate depends upon a few uncertain moments; Oh! with what zeal and fervor will he &s;peak! How will death, judg|ment; and eternity appear as it were in every feature, and every word! Out of the abundance of his heart, his mouth will &s;peak.

with reference to a judgment to come, and deli|ver every Sermon in &s;ome re&s;pect, as if it were his la&s;t, not knowing when his Lord will call him, or his hearers to account.&mdash; We are not to &s;uppo&s;e that his zeal will vent it&s;elf in the frightful bel|lowings of enthu&s;ia&s;m; but he will &s;peak forth the words of truth in &s;oberne&s;s, with mode&s;ty, and chri&s;tian decency.</P>

<P>A FEW PARTICULAR ADDRESSES.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, To him who is about to be &s;et apart to the work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try in this place.</P>
<P>DEAR SIR,</P>
<P>FROM the preceding ob&s;ervations, you will ea&s;ily &s;ee, that the work before you is great and
<PB N="18" REF="023437_0017_0FBF7048637456F8">
&s;olemn; and I hope this is a le&s;&s;on you have been taught otherwi&s;e; the former acquaintance I have had with you, gives me rea&s;on to hope that this is the ca&s;e. You are about to have the&s;e &s;ouls committed to your care; you are to be pla|ced as a Watchman upon the walls of this part of Zion; I doubt not but that it is with trembling you enter upon this work. The relation that this day's bu&s;ine&s;s has with a judgment to come, renders the &s;cene affecting. Your mind I tru&s;t has already anticipated the important moment, when you mu&s;t meet this people before the bar of God. The good profe&s;&s;ion you are this day to make is before many witne&s;&s;es; &s;aints and wicked men are beholding; the angels are looking down upon us; above all, the great God with compla|cency or di&s;approbation, beholds the tran&s;actions of this day; he &s;ees what motives govern you, and will proclaim it before the a&s;&s;embled Univer&s;e. Oh! &s;olemn, and affecting thought! The work before you is great, and requires great &s;earching of heart, great &s;elf-diffidence, and &s;elf aba&s;ement. How nece&s;&s;ary that you feel your dependance up|on God; you cannot perform any part of your work without his help; under a &s;en&s;e of your weakne&s;s, repair to him for help. Would you be a &s;ucce&s;sful Mini&s;ter, you mu&s;t be a praying dependant one; do all in the name, and &s;trength of the Lord Je&s;us. Would you be faithful in watching for the &s;ouls of men, you mu&s;t be much in watching your own heart. If you are carele&s;s with re&s;pect to your own &s;oul, you will be al&s;o with re&s;pect to others. Although the work is too
<PB N="19" REF="023437_0018_0FBF7049E19D50F0" MS="y">
great for you, yet let &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e revive your de&s;ponding heart. That the cau&s;e is good, better than life you may well give up all for it. 'Tis the cur&s;e of God. and that which will prove victorious, in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition from men or devils&mdash;that God has promi&s;ed to be with his Mini&s;ters to the end of the world&mdash;that the work is delighted; Paul &s;omewhere ble&s;&s;es God for putting him into the work of the Mini&s;|try&mdash;that the campaign is &s;hort, your warfare will &s;oon be accompli&s;hed&mdash;that the reward is great, being found faithful, you will receive a crown of glory, that fadeth not away.</P>
<P>Secondly, We have a word to the church and congregation in this place.</P>
<P>MY BRETHREM AND FRIENDS,</P>
<P>THE importance of the work of a go&s;pel Min|i&s;ter, &s;ugge&s;ts the weighty concerns of your &s;ouls;. As Mini&s;ters mu&s;t give account how they preach and behave; &s;o hearers al&s;o are to be examined how they hear and improve. You are to hear with a view to the day of judgment, always re|membering, that there is no &s;ermon or opportu|nity that you have in this life, to prepare for another world, that &s;hall go unnouced at that deci&s;ive court. Your pre&s;ent exerci&s;es, with re|&s;pect to the &s;olemn affairs of this day, will then come up to public view.</P>
<P>God, we tru&s;t, is this day &s;ending you one to watch for your &s;ouls: &s;hould not this excite &s;en|timents
<PB N="20" REF="023437_0019_0FBF704DD05503D8">
of gratitude in your brea&s;ts? Shall God take &s;o much care of your &s;ouls, and you neglect them? How unrea&s;onable will it be for you to de&s;pi&s;e the pious in&s;truction of your watchmen? You will herein wrong your own &s;ouls, and it will be an evidence that you love death. You will bear with him in not accommodating his &s;er|mons to your vitiated ta&s;tes, becau&s;e he <HI>mu&s;t give account.</HI> His work is great, and you mu&s;t pray for him; as in the ver&s;e following the text, the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, "Brethren, pray for us." Is it the bu&s;ine&s;s of your mini&s;ter to watch for your &s;ouls, with &s;uch indefatigable a&s;&s;iduity, you ea|&s;ily &s;ee how nece&s;&s;ary it is that you do what you can to &s;trengthen him in this work. That you admini&s;ter to his temporal wants, that he may give him&s;elf wholly to the&s;e things. The great backwardne&s;s among people in general with re|&s;pect to this matter at pre&s;ent, has an unfavoura|ble a&s;pect. "Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? Who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who &s;eedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock." 1 Cor. ix.7.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s this man is &s;ent here for the ri&s;e and fall of many in this place. We hope he will be u&s;ed as a mean of leading &s;ome to Chri&s;t; while on the other hand, we even tremble at the thought, he may fit others for a more aggravated condemnation. Take heed how you hear.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="023437_0020_0FBF704FDDDEFCE8"><HI>A few words to the A&s;&s;embly in general, will clo&s;e the &s;ubject.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT has been &s;aid about the character and work of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, &s;hews us at once that it is a matter in which we are all deeply intere&s;ted. The greater part of the people pre&s;ent, I expect to &s;ee no more, until I meet them at that day, which has been the main &s;ubject of the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e. With re&s;pect to the characters of the people pre&s;ent, we can &s;ay but little about them; only this we may ob&s;erve, <HI>they are all dying crea|tures,</HI> ha&s;tening to the grave, and to judgment: There mu&s;t we meet you,&mdash;there an account of this day's work will come up to view,&mdash;there each one mu&s;t give account concerning the right di&s;charge of the work a&s;&s;igned him: The preach|er mu&s;t give account, and you that hear al&s;o. Let me &s;ay to &s;uch as are yet in their &s;ins, and proclaim it from this part of the wall of Zion. That the enemy of your &s;ouls is at hand,&mdash;that de&s;truction awaits you. Oh! flee! flee! to Chri&s;t Je&s;us; bow to his &s;overeignty; know this, that except you are born again, and become new creatures, in the di&s;po&s;itions of your mind, you cannot be &s;aved. Shall mini&s;ters watch and pray for your &s;ouls night and day, and you pay no at|tention to them? Since they are &s;o valuable, having &s;uch a relation to God, did men regard divine glory, they would regard their &s;ouls, as being de&s;igned to exhibit it. Be in&s;tructed, then, to delay no longer, but by repentance toward God, and faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, make
<PB N="22" REF="023437_0021_0FBF70515A99D850">
peace with him, before you are &s;ummoned before his awful bar. Let me bear te&s;timony again&s;t a practice too common on &s;uch occa&s;ions as this: Many people think it a time for carnal mirth and di&s;&s;ipation, than which nothing can be more pro|voking to God, nor incon&s;i&s;tent with that day, and &s;trict account that &s;uch an occa&s;ion tends to excise in the mind. May all, both mini&s;ters and people, be exhorted to diligence in their work, that finally we may adopt the language of the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle,&mdash;"As al&s;o ye have acknowledg|ed us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye al&s;o are ours in the day of the LORD JESUS.</P>
