<Q><HI>STRIVE to enter in at the &s;trait gate.&mdash;</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the words of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, occa&s;ioned by a que&s;tion that was propo&s;ed to him in the following terms: "Lord, are there few that be &s;aved?" Who it was that a&s;ked this que&s;tion, or what his views therein were, we are not particularly in|formed. However, it &s;eems probable, by his addre&s;&s;ing our Saviour under the title of "Lord," that this was one of his profe&s;&s;ed di&s;ciples. But whoever he were, and whatever his particular views, this was certainly rather a que&s;tion of
<PB N="6" REF="008926_0004_103089AAA230B368">
curio&s;ity, than of real importance to the inquirer. Our Lord therefore, in&s;tead of returning a direct an&s;wer to him, gave him, in common with others that were pre&s;ent, this admonition; the ob&s;erva|tion of which could not but be of &s;olid advantage to them, as tending to their own &s;alvation re&s;pec|tively. <Q>And he &s;aid unto them, Strive [Strive ye] to enter,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE words, it is humbly conceived, may, without any impropriety, be con&s;idered as an ex|hortation, admonition or precept, given to all tho&s;e in general, who hear the go&s;pel of the king|dom preached; the duty enjoined therein being common to all; to high and low, rich and poor, male and female: And, it may be added, both to tho&s;e who are, and who are not, already in a regenerate &s;tate: For, be they in that happy e&s;tate or not, &s;till they ought to u&s;e their utmo&s;t dili|gence to obtain the &s;alvation revealed in the go&s;|pel; or, which is the &s;ame thing, to enter in at the &s;trait gate.</P>
<P>BUT it may be proper to be a little more par|ticular in explaining the phra&s;eology of the text; what is meant by the "&s;trait gate," and what by "&s;triving" to enter in thereat.</P>
<P>BY the "&s;trait gate," our Lord doubtle&s;s in|tends in general, the gate of eternal life and hap|pine&s;s. This is put beyond all doubt by his own
<PB N="7" REF="008926_0005_103089B38E18B808">
words in his &s;ermon on the mount; where he mentions the &s;trait gate, and the narrow way, as that which "leadeth unto life," and which "few find;" in oppo&s;ition to the wide gate, and the broad way, that "leadeth to de&s;truction; and many there be," &s;ays he, "that go in thereat." Our Lord, in this manner of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;eems to con|&s;ider the happine&s;s of the heavenly &s;tate, under the notion of a glorious man&s;ion, or city; to which there lies one certain road, and the en|trance into which, is by a door or gate. In con|formity to which manner of conception, he &s;ays in the ver&s;e immediately following the text&mdash;<Q>When once the ma&s;ter of the <HI>hou&s;e</HI> is ri&s;en up, and hath &s;hut to the <HI>door,</HI> and ye begin to &s;tand without, and to knock at the <HI>door,</HI></Q> &amp;c. And, in the revelation of St. John, it is &s;aid, <Q>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may <HI>enter in thro' the gates</HI> into the city.</Q> You &s;ee from hence, to what our Saviour alludes in the text, and why he u&s;es this metaphor.</P>
<P>BUT why is this called a "&s;trait" gate? Doubtle&s;s it is in re&s;pect of the many ob&s;tructions and difficulties which attend the working out our &s;alvation, or finally gaining admi&s;&s;ion into the paradi&s;e of God. The way of error and vice is &s;aid to be wide, and the gate of de&s;truction broad; becau&s;e it is &s;o natural and ea&s;y to walk in the one, and to enter in at the other. But the way
<PB N="8" REF="008926_0006_103089B567B8CAF0">
of truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s and life, is walked in, and the gate of heaven entered, with difficulty: Whence it is, that they are de&s;cribed as narrow and &s;trait, in oppo&s;ition to the former.</P>
<P>BY "&s;triving" to enter in at the &s;trait gate, is meant in general, exerting our&s;elves with vigour, or u&s;ing our earne&s;t endeavours to that end; to obtain the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls, or finally to gain admi&s;&s;ion into the kingdom of heaven. This is the proper notion and idea of &s;triving.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agonize&s;the.</NOTE> It is oppo&s;ed to indifference, negli|gence and &s;loth; and implies an inten&s;e applica|tion of the mind and faculties, in order to effect what we have in view. And &s;triving thus, &s;up|po&s;es two things. One is, that there is difficulty in the way, or oppo&s;ition to be overcome, which requires a vigorous effort. For if a thing may be performed with great ea&s;e, there is no occa|&s;ion, nor indeed any room, for &s;triving in order thereto. As, for example, a man in his full &s;trength can, with no propriety of language, be &s;aid to &s;trive to lift a &s;traw, or a &s;mall pebble-&s;tone; or to do any thing el&s;e, which may be done with facility. But this is far from being the ca&s;e, with re&s;pect to the matter now before us. There are numerous and great difficulties in reli|gion, as before ob&s;erved; with reference to which, the gate of life is &s;aid to be &s;trait: So that in this re&s;pect there is abundant occa&s;ion for &s;triving.
<PB N="9" REF="008926_0007_103089B835AC2490">
The world, the fle&s;h and the devil; principalities and powers, and &s;piritual wickedne&s;&s;es in high places, are not to be overcome, but by great re|&s;olution and vigor on our own part, even tho' aided by Him, who is &s;tronger than "the &s;trong man armed."&mdash;The other thing &s;uppo&s;ed in &s;triv|ing, unle&s;s it be an irrational &s;triving, is, that the object thereof is a matter of importance. For the difficulty of a thing, if it be of no con&s;equence, is no proper rea&s;on for &s;triving to accompli&s;h it: So far from it, that this will be a good rea&s;on for not &s;triving, or giving our&s;elves any trouble or concern about it. Men do indeed often take great pains, without having any thing in view, really worthy of them. In the language of the pro|phet, they "&s;pend their money for that which is not bread, and their labor for that which &s;atisfieth not." The&s;e are certainly ill-placed endeavours; &s;triving to no good purpo&s;e, even tho' the ends aimed at are attained. But when our Lord ad|moni&s;hes us to &s;trive, that we may enter in at the &s;trait gate, this is a matter of infinite, eternal im|portance to us; and &s;o ju&s;tly demands our utmo&s;t care and endeavours.</P>
<P>SOME may perhaps think, that &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate, farther implies &s;ome uncer|tainty as to the &s;ucce&s;s of our endeavours; whe|ther they &s;hall be effectual or not: And that our Lord de&s;igned to &s;ugge&s;t this to us, by &s;uch a manner of expre&s;&s;ion. But this is improbable
<PB N="10" REF="008926_0008_103089BC29A1D258">
for &s;everal rea&s;ons; and particularly becau&s;e, in his &s;ermon on the mount, the precept is expre&s;&s;ed ab&s;olutely: "Enter in at the &s;trait gate:" Not as it is here, "Strive," &amp;c. Which former manner of expre&s;&s;ion &s;eems a much better argument for the certain po&s;&s;ibility of the thing, than the lat|ter is for the doubtfulne&s;s of it.</P>
<P>BUT enough has been &s;aid to explain the phra&s;eology, and general &s;cope of this precept. In farther di&s;cour&s;ing upon the &s;ubject, it is pro|po&s;ed, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, more particularly to repre&s;ent to you, What this &s;triving implies in it: The fatal con&s;equences of not &s;triving; together with the happine&s;s and glory which will accrue to us, if we &s;trive effectually, or &s;o as finally to enter in at the &s;trait gate: And la&s;tly, What con|nexion there is, according to the word of God, between &s;triving in the manner we may and ought to do, and actually obtaining what we aim at therein, the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls. It is propo&s;ed to enlarge much more upon the la&s;t of the&s;e points, than upon any of the others. In the fir&s;t place it will be proper,</P>
<P>I. MORE particularly and di&s;tinctly to repre|&s;ent to you, what this &s;triving implies in it. For this is a very comprehen&s;ive duty, which pre&s;up|po&s;es &s;ome things, and directly contains &s;everal others. And,</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="008926_0009_103089BF1B932C70">
1&s;t. IT pre&s;uppo&s;es a man to be at lea&s;t a &s;pe|culative believer of the go&s;pel, or of the chri&s;tian revelation. For &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate, is the &s;ame thing, in other words, with en|deavouring to obtain that &s;alvation which the go&s;pel reveals. And it is evident, that no man can con&s;i&s;tently be &s;uppo&s;ed to do this, unle&s;s he is fir&s;t convinced of the truth of the go&s;pel in general. So that whatever a mere heathen, one who has never heard of, or who rejects the chri&s;|tian revelation, as an impo&s;ture, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to do with a view to his future happine&s;s; yet this does not come up to the proper notion and idea of &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate. But more particularly,</P>
<P>2dly. THIS &s;triving pre&s;uppo&s;es a man to be awakened into &s;ome &s;en&s;e of his &s;in, guilt, and mi&s;ery; and into a &s;erious concern for the wel|fare of his &s;oul. The &s;alvation revealed thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, re&s;pects, or has for its object, not the righteous, but &s;inners; not men, con|&s;idered in a &s;tate of innocency, who would need no &s;uch &s;alvation, but apo&s;tate, degenerate and guilty creatures, ju&s;tly obnoxious to the wrath of God. It is in this view that mankind are con&s;idered in the go&s;pel; the very foundation of which is laid in, and the whole &s;uper&s;tructure built upon, the &s;uppo&s;ition that mankind in general are in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;in, condemnation and ruin. And no one can be &s;uppo&s;ed to u&s;e his endeavours
<PB N="12" REF="008926_0010_103089C1160734B8">
to obtain deliverance from this &s;tate, or to have a part in that &s;alvation which the go&s;pel reveals, while he remains in a &s;tate of carnal &s;ecurity; or has not an awakened &s;en&s;e of his mi&s;ery, as lying under guilt, and being in a &s;tate of alienation from God. The doing any thing at all, how little &s;oever it may be, with a view to obtain de|liverance from &s;in and wrath, &s;uppo&s;es a per&s;on to be convinced, that he is really a &s;inner, and, as &s;uch, liable to wrath.</P>
<P>3dly. THIS &s;triving pre&s;uppo&s;es a per&s;on earne&s;tly to de&s;ire the &s;alvation revealed thro' Chri&s;t; or to have his heart engaged in this matter, as a thing of the la&s;t importance to him. De&s;ires always preceed endeavours, or go before &s;triving, both in our &s;piritual and temporal concerns. A man's &s;triving, or u&s;ing his endeavours, to obtain worldly riches, plea&s;ures, power and preferment, &s;uppo&s;es his heart to be &s;et upon the&s;e things: For if it were not, he would not certainly be at any great pains to acquire them, or give him&s;elf much concern about them. This is &s;trictly and evidently true of all our endeavours in religion, or &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate. All exer|tions, efforts and &s;trivings to this end, &s;uppo&s;e that we &s;incerely de&s;ire to obtain &s;alvation. Nor will any one &s;trive as he ought to do, in order to this, unle&s;s his de&s;ires are &s;trong and vigorous, in &s;ome proportion to the importance of it; at lea&s;t, unle&s;s he con&s;iders this as a thing of more
<PB N="13" REF="008926_0011_103089C2C8150BC8">
con&s;equence to him, than all worldly riches, plea|&s;ures and honors. For he that po&s;tpones the &s;alvation of his &s;oul to any thing in this world, can, with no propriety, be &s;aid to &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate.</P>
<P>4thly. THIS &s;triving implies in it, the u&s;e of proper care and diligence to be rightly informed concerning the way of &s;alvation, and to guard again&s;t error in this re&s;pect. For &s;urely, we can|not properly &s;trive to enter in at the gate of life, or of the kingdom of heaven, if we are un&s;ollici|tous to find that "narrow way" that leadeth to it. And here there are two things to be parti|cularly ob&s;erved. One is, that there is really but one way of life and &s;alvation revealed do us. The other is, that this is &s;o narrow, that it may be fatally mi&s;taken, or not found, by tho&s;e that are carele&s;s and negligent in their inquiries after it. From whence ari&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of taking pains to this end: For if the way of truth and life were &s;o plain and wide, that it could not po&s;&s;i|bly be mi&s;apprehended, all care and caution le&s;t we &s;hould err from it, would be &s;uper&s;eded.</P>
<P>THERE is, as was ju&s;t now ob&s;erved, really but one way of life and &s;alvation, revealed in the go&s;pel; and that is, the way which Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf taught; the new and living way, which was both opened and pointed out by him. With reference to which he &s;ays, "I am the way, the
<PB N="14" REF="008926_0012_103089C5A1B81C50">
truth and the life: No man cometh unto the Father, but by me." His in&s;pired apo&s;tles al&s;o taught the way of life: Concerning whom it is &s;aid in the acts of the apo&s;tles, "The&s;e men are the &s;ervants of the mo&s;t high God, which &s;hew unto us the way of &s;alvation." And that which they declared, was not a different way, but the &s;ame which Chri&s;t him&s;elf taught; as is manife&s;t by comparing their doctrine with his. So that there is certainly a way, or one way of &s;alvation, revealed. But is there any more than one? If any per&s;on &s;ays, there are two, or more, it is in|cumbent upon him to point them out; &s;hewing the difference which there is betwixt them; and yet, that both are true and right, the ways of God's revealing. But this, it is pre&s;umed, no man will attempt to do. It is in reference to the unity of the way of life, that the apo&s;tle &s;ays, there is "one faith."&mdash;"There is one body and one &s;pirit," &s;aith he, <Q>even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, <HI>one faith,</HI> one bapti&s;m, one God and Father of all, who is above all,</Q> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. IV. 4. 5. 6.</NOTE> There is therefore as certainly but one true faith, or one go&s;pel, in the faith of which we can be &s;aved, as there is but one hope of our calling, but one Lord or Chri&s;t, but one God and Father of all. And we might as well &s;uppo&s;e two Fathers of all, two Redeemers, and two go&s;|pels, as two ways of &s;alvation, that differ e&s;&s;en|tially from each other: And the &s;ame apo&s;tle de|nounceth
<PB N="15" REF="008926_0013_103089CB1BCFA8D0">
a cur&s;e again&s;t whom&s;oever &s;hould preach another go&s;pel, or another way of &s;al|vation, even tho' it were him&s;elf, or an angel from heaven.</P>
<P>IT was farther ob&s;erved above, that this one way of &s;alvation may be fatally mi&s;taken by tho&s;e, who are carele&s;s and negligent in their in|quiries after it. To which purpo&s;e it may &s;uf|fice for the pre&s;ent, to remind you of two pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture only. One is in the 2 Epi&s;. of Peter, chap. iii. "And account that the long-&s;uffering of our Lord is &s;alvation, even as our beloved bro|ther Paul, according to the wi&s;dom given unto him, hath written unto you: As al&s;o in all his epi&s;tles, &s;peaking of the&s;e things; in which are &s;ome things hard to be under&s;tood, which they that are unlearned and un&s;table" [men of an un|teachable, light and wavering mind] <HI>wre&s;t, as they do al&s;o the other &s;criptures, unto their own de&s;truction</HI>&mdash;Beware le&s;t ye al&s;o, being led away with <HI>the error of the wicked,</HI> &amp;c." The other pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture alluded to above, is in the 2 The&s;&s;. chap. ii. where the apo&s;tle &s;peaks of &s;ome, who "received not the love of the truth, that they might be &s;aved." He immediately &s;ubjoins: "And for this cau&s;e God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ion, that they &s;hould <HI>believe a lie; that they all might be damned, who believed not the truth,</HI> &amp;c." Now, if per&s;ons may wre&s;t the &s;criptures; not only tho&s;e which are really
<PB N="16" REF="008926_0014_103089CD047C25C8">
"hard to be under&s;tood," but al&s;o the "other &s;criptures," to their own de&s;truction; and if there are &s;ome, who are given over to "&s;trong delu|&s;ion," and believe a lie, to their own damnation; then it is certain, that men may err fatally con|cerning the way of life. If there be any funda|mental truths, there mu&s;t of con&s;equence be fun|damental errors; or &s;uch as &s;hall be fatal in their con&s;equences. And this is evidently &s;uppo&s;ed, not only in the&s;e, but in many other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture. From whence ari&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity of great care in inquiring after the way of life, and caution again&s;t deception with reference thereto. Nor can any man be &s;uppo&s;ed heartily to de&s;ire, and earne&s;tly to &s;trive, that he may enter in at the &s;trait gate, unle&s;s he exerci&s;eth care and dili|gence in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be demanded here, What errors are fatal? this, it is conceived, ought to be left to the judgment of God. No man can pre&s;ume, without arogance, pride and impiety, particularly to run the line between e&s;&s;ential and non-e&s;&s;ential articles of faith; or, which comes to the &s;ame thing, between &s;uch errors as &s;hall be ab&s;olutely fatal, and &s;uch as &s;hall not. If God him&s;elf has not explicitly determined the&s;e que&s;tions, as he has not, what unwarrantable pre&s;umption is it in men to do it; as the manner of &s;ome is! Tho' the way of &s;alvation revealed, be but one; tho' this may be fatally mi&s;apprehended by the care|le&s;s
<PB N="17" REF="008926_0015_103089CFDD7828B0">
and negligent; and tho', for this rea&s;on, we ought to u&s;e diligence that we may be rightly informed; yet it is certain, that all mi&s;|takes and errors re&s;pecting the way of life, are not fatal: For who then could be &s;aved! It may be &s;ubjoined here, that tho' the carele&s;s and &s;lothful may err fatally; yet it will by no means follow from hence, that tho&s;e may al&s;o err thus, who are &s;eriou&s;ly inqui&s;itive; tho&s;e who take Je&s;us Chri&s;t for their guide, and hear|tily de&s;ire to know the truth as it is in him. It would be a great reflexion on the goodne&s;s and mercy of God, and on the holy &s;criptures, to &s;uppo&s;e, either that every mi&s;take in &s;uch fallible creatures re&s;pecting the way of life, &s;hould be damning; or, that we might &s;incere|ly and earne&s;tly endeavour, in the u&s;e of pro|per means, to learn the way of &s;alvation from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, or the &s;criptures of truth, and yet not find it, but err from it in any e&s;&s;ential point. The former of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions would in ef|fect dive&s;t God of his mercy; and the latter of them would infer the &s;criptures to be inade|quate to the declared de&s;ign of them, which is, to guide our feet into the way of peace, and make us "wi&s;e unto &s;alvation;" which the apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts, they are "able" to do. And who&s;oever denies this prote&s;tant, and truly apo&s;|tolic doctrine, ought to go to Rome for a liv|ing, vi&s;ible and infallible guide; unle&s;s, per|haps, he had rather &s;et up to be one him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="008926_0016_103089D4F0A1FB50">
IN fine here: Striving to enter into life, ma|nife&s;tly implies great care in &s;eeking the way that leadeth thereto. In all the concerns of this mortal life, when we are heartily engaged in any pur&s;uit, or endeavour to accompli&s;h any end, we are careful le&s;t we &s;hould take &s;ome wrong &s;tep to our prejudice; except in &s;uch ca&s;es as we apprehend admit of no doubt or uncertainty. And we do, or at lea&s;t we ought to, act from the &s;ame general principle in the infinitely higher concerns of religion. Neither can we be &s;uppo&s;ed really to &s;trive, that we may enter in at the &s;trait gate, unle&s;s we are &s;ollicitous to know the truth as it is in Je&s;us, in &s;ome proportion to the importance of it, as it relates to our eternal &s;alvation.</P>
<P>5thly. THIS &s;triving implies in it, earne&s;t prayer to God for the illumination of his holy &s;pirit; for his guidance and direction in the way of life; for the pardon of our &s;ins; for a new heart, and right &s;pirit; and that he would purge our con&s;ciences from dead works, to &s;erve him in newne&s;s of life. Prayer is one, and indeed a mo&s;t important way, of &s;triving; to the u&s;e of which means, there are &s;o many exhortations and injunctions in the holy &s;crip|tures, and which are &s;o generally known, that it &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent to refer you to any in particular. And certainly no per&s;on who neglects this, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;trive as he ought to do.</P>

6thly. THIS undoubtedly implies in it, &s;triv|ing again&s;t &s;in; watchfulne&s;s again&s;t tempta|tion; a re&s;olute oppo&s;ition to the lu&s;ts and corruptions of our own hearts; and an endea|vour to for&s;ake and avoid all tho&s;e evil prac|tices which God has forbidden in his word; and for the &s;ake of which, his wrath cometh on the children of di&s;obedience. For &s;urely that man cannot be &s;aid to &s;trive to obtain &s;al|vation, who does not endeavour to avoid tho&s;e &s;ins, and unrighteous deeds, again&s;t which he knows the wrath of God is revealed from heaven.</P>
<P>7thly. THIS implies a real endeavour, not only to ab&s;tain from what God has forbid|den; but to do what&s;oever he has required, or to obey all his known commandments. For our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour has &s;aid, "Not every one that &s;aith unto me, Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter in|to the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven." And one would think it hardly po&s;&s;ible for any man to deceive him&s;elf &s;o much, as to imagine that he really &s;trives to enter in at the &s;trait gate, without endeavouring to comply with the known will of God. This &s;triving plainly implies a &s;incere de&s;ire to avoid every thing in general that may ob&s;truct, and to do every thing in general which may promote, a man's future well-being.&mdash;It is, however, very far
<PB N="20" REF="008926_0018_103089D8AF7F9B60">
from being the de&s;ign of what is here &s;aid, that we &s;hould do thus under the notion of merit|ing &s;alvation thereby; or performing &s;uch a righteou&s;ne&s;s as God is obliged in ju&s;tice to ac|cept. This were the greate&s;t folly. What|ever we do, we are unprofitable &s;ervants; yea, wor&s;e than unprofitable; for we are &s;till &s;in|ful creatures: And being &s;uch, can rea&s;onably hope for eternal life, only as the gift of God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, who hath redeem|ed us from the cur&s;e of the law.

For if any, after &s;triv|ing thus for a time, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure e&s;cap|ing the pollutions of the world, relap&s;e into their former carele&s;s and &s;inful way of life, the apo&s;tle compares them to a "dog that return|eth to his vomit, and a &s;ow that was wa&s;hed, to her wallowing in the mire."

IF it &s;hould be asked, Whether any unre|generate &s;inner can be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;trive in the manner repre&s;ented above? I an&s;wer, Yes; at lea&s;t in general. There is very little, if any thing, in this account of &s;triving, &amp;c. which would nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on to be already born of the Spirit. But if it &s;hould be farther demanded, Whether a &s;inner can be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;trive thus, antece|dent to <HI>any</HI> influence or operation of the good &s;pirit of God upon his heart? The an&s;wer is, By no means. God undoubtedly &s;trives with &s;inful men, by his word, his &s;pirit, and the di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence; awakening them to a &s;en&s;e of their guilt, mi&s;ery and dan|ger, antecedently to their &s;triving, or doing any thing tending to their &s;alvation: So that when any are finally brought to love him, it is "be|cau&s;e he fir&s;t loved them." But yet &s;uch in|fluences of the word and &s;pirit of God up|on the hearts of men, as &s;erve to awaken in them a &s;erious concern about their &s;alvation, and excite them to &s;trive in order thereto, do not infer them to be new creatures in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. My meaning is, that there may be, and always are, &s;uch awakenings and &s;trivings, prior to that thorough change of di&s;|po&s;ition and affections, which the &s;criptures expre&s;s by a new heart, the new creature, and being born of God.&mdash;It may be &s;ubjoined here, to prevent mi&s;con&s;truction, that tho' no

&s;inner &s;trives, but with whom God &s;trives fir&s;t; yet it will not from hence follow, that God &s;trives with none, be&s;ides tho&s;e who &s;trive in con&s;equence thereof. God is repre&s;ented as &s;triving with many, who, in&s;tead of yielding to the impre&s;&s;ions of his grace, re&s;i&s;t, grieve and quench his good &s;pirit; till they are utter|ly for&s;aken of him, and given over to a repro|bate mind: In conformity to his own threat|ning, that his "Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tho' the &s;criptures &s;peak of God as &s;triving; yet this &s;eems not literally and &s;trictly a&s;cribed to him. For &s;triving, in the ordinary import of the word, connotes weakne&s;s, or a limited power, which meets with oppo&s;ition, ob&s;tructions and difficulties: Whereas God is almighty; a being, to whom nothing is hard, nothing difficult, which he re&s;olves to do.</NOTE></P>
<P>II. I WAS, in the next place, to &s;hew you the fatal con&s;equences of not &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate: Or, in other words, of not u&s;ing your endeavours to obtain eternal life, in the manner repre&s;ented above. And here it is to be ob&s;erved in general, that &s;triving is in|di&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that with|out it we can never &s;ee the kingdom of God. It is not now a&s;&s;erted, that if we &s;trive aright, we &s;hall certainly be &s;ucceeded in our endea|vours: But let the &s;ucce&s;s of our endeavours be ever &s;o uncertain; let it be &s;uppo&s;ed alto|gether doubtful, whether our &s;triving &s;hall i&s;&s;ue in our &s;alvation, or not; yet it is certain, on
<PB N="23" REF="008926_0021_103089E168BBC3D0">
the other hand, that if we do not &s;trive, we &s;hall never obtain eternal life. This is no doubtful point, whatever the other may be. That the con&s;equences of our negligence in this re&s;pect, will be fatal, is infallibly certain, though the happy con&s;equences of u&s;ing our endeavours, &s;hould be ever &s;o problemati|cal, or precarious. However free the grace of God is, it is manife&s;t that he has required &s;omething of us in order to our &s;alvation. And our Lord here enjoins us to &s;trive to this end: Which is a general command, compre|hending various things in it, as we have &s;een above. And can we &s;uppo&s;e that our Saviour would have commanded us to &s;trive, if &s;triving were unnece&s;&s;ary to the end propo&s;ed? or, if we might finally enter in at the &s;trait gate without &s;triving? This cannot be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>BESIDES: If any &s;hould imagine that &s;triving is unnece&s;&s;ary, this would be to &s;uppo&s;e that every thing is unnece&s;&s;ary, which properly comes under the head of &s;triving; every thing which is pre&s;uppo&s;ed and implied therein, ac|cording to the account already given of it, &s;uppo&s;ing that to be a ju&s;t one. For example: It would be to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;inners, to whom the go&s;pel is preached, may inherit eternal life without giving any credit thereto; with|out being awakened into a &s;en&s;e of their guilt
<PB N="24" REF="008926_0022_103089E47791FF78">
and mi&s;ery; without de&s;iring to be &s;aved; without endeavouring to learn the way of life; without prayer to God; without endeavouring to for&s;ake their &s;ins; and without endeavouring to do the will of God. All the&s;e things are pre|&s;uppo&s;ed and implied in &s;triving; and con&s;e|quently, if &s;triving be unnece&s;&s;ary, the&s;e are unnece&s;&s;ary. But can any man who believes the holy &s;criptures to be the word of God, (and to &s;uch only I am &s;peaking) po&s;&s;ibly imagine that the&s;e things are unnece&s;&s;ary!&mdash;That a man may finally obtain the &s;alvation revealed thro' Chri&s;t, altho' he rejects the revelation thereof; altho' he continues hardened in his &s;ins; altho' he has no de&s;ire to obtain eternal life; altho' he never &s;eriou&s;ly enquires the way that leadeth thereto; altho' he never prays to God for his pardon, Spirit and grace; altho' he freely indulges, in&s;tead of mortifying his lu&s;ts; and in fine, tho' he takes no pains, u&s;es no endea|vours, to keep God's commandments, but wil|fully violates them from day to day; and con|tinues &s;o to do to the end of his life! It is &s;o manife&s;t from the whole tenor of &s;cripture, that &s;uch a man cannot be &s;aved, but mu&s;t peri&s;h in his &s;ins, that it were a mi&s;-&s;pence of time to prove it, by an induction of particular pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>IT being certain then, and mo&s;t manife&s;t from the holy &s;criptures, that we cannot finally enter in at the &s;trait gate, unle&s;s we exert our
<PB N="25" REF="008926_0023_103089E74BC91318">
&s;elves, and &s;trive in order thereto; from hence appear the fatal con&s;equences of negligence in this re&s;pect. I &s;ay con&s;equences, and fatal con&s;equences; for the&s;e three things are evi|dently contained, or implied, in being excluded from the kingdom of heaven: The lo&s;s, or falling &s;hort of eternal life, glory and happine&s;s; &s;uffering the puni&s;hment, to which we are ju&s;tly liable as &s;inners; and an additional weight of woe and mi&s;ery due to us, as de&s;pi|&s;ers of the mercy and grace of God.</P>
<P>BEING excluded from the kingdom of hea|ven, implies in it the lo&s;s, or falling &s;hort of eternal life, glory and happine&s;s. The &s;trait gate is the gate of life, of joy, of glory, honor and immortality: So that, not to enter in there|at, is to be forever excluded from the&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings; from the favour of God, and from the everla&s;ting joys that are in his pre&s;ence; an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away; for it is in heaven, that this inheritance is re&s;erved; and it can be enjoyed only by tho&s;e, who &s;hall finally enter in at the &s;trait gate.</P>
<P>THIS farther implies, the &s;uffering of that puni&s;hment, to which we are ju&s;tly liable as &s;inners. For, to be excluded from heaven, is in effect to be thru&s;t down to hell, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched;
<PB N="26" REF="008926_0024_103089EB3A4A0710">
there being no medium, no middle way for us, between being &s;aved and damned. As &s;in|ful creatures, we are already expo&s;ed to perdi|tion from the avenging ju&s;tice of God: yea, we are actually under a &s;entence of condem|nation and death, till &s;uch time as we are de|livered therefrom, by having an intere&s;t in the redemption wrought out by Chri&s;t. For, it is to them only that are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and &s;o in him as to walk, not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit, that there is no condemnation. Now, how terrible a thing is it to lie forever under guilt, the condemnation of God? How holy a being is he? how great his hatred of &s;in? how unlimited his power to puni&s;h it? how awful his threatnings, and how &s;ure the execution of them upon finally-hardened and irreclaimable tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors? Is it not a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God! Is not de&s;truction from the Almighty a terror to us!&mdash;e&s;pecially &s;uch an everla&s;ting de&s;truc|tion from his pre&s;ence, and the glory of his power, as is threatned in his word! And whatever, fooli&s;h, fal&s;e-hearted men may ima|gine, or however flatter them&s;elves with the hopes of impunity, "God is not a man that he &s;hould lie, or the &s;on of man that he &s;hould repent."</P>
<P>IT is farther to be ob&s;erved here, that tho&s;e who are favoured with the go&s;pel, and yet neg|lect
<PB N="27" REF="008926_0025_103089EE65975638">
to &s;trive after the &s;alvation revealed there|in, will incur an additional weight of woe and mi&s;ery, as de&s;pi&s;ers of the grace and mercy of God. He has provided and revealed a way of &s;alvation, for &s;inful, guilty and lo&s;t creatures, thro' the mediation, the &s;ufferings and death of his own dear Son; and &s;aith, "Who&s;oever will, let him come," &amp;c. God exerci&s;eth pa|tience and forbearance towards his &s;inful crea|tures; thereby giving them time and oppor|tunity for repentance, and working out their &s;alvation. Now, if you &s;hould neglect this method of deliverance from condemnation, and think everla&s;ting life not worth your &s;triving after; you will not only remain under the guilt of your other &s;ins, but will be ju&s;tly chargeable al&s;o with de&s;pi&s;ing the goodne&s;s of God; even the "riches of his goodne&s;s, for|bearance and long-&s;uffering": And if you do &s;o, you mu&s;t needs "trea&s;ure up unto your &s;elves wrath again&s;t the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God." Your guilt and puni&s;hment will be greatly aggravated in this re&s;pect. You will not only be condem|ned as &s;inners in the day of judgment; but as the mo&s;t heinous &s;inners: you will not only be ca&s;t into the place of torments; but have your part among&s;t the mo&s;t wretched that &s;uffer there. In conformity hereto, our Lord him&s;elf denounced a peculiar woe again&s;t the inhabitants of Corazin, Beth&s;aida and Caper|naum,
<PB N="28" REF="008926_0026_103089F02D54F330">
where he had preached the go&s;pel of the kingdom, becau&s;e they repented not; a&s;|&s;uring them, that it &s;hould be more tolerable for tho&s;e of Tyre and Sydon, for Sodom and Gomorrha, in the day of judgment, than for them. Thus al&s;o it is &s;aid in the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews: "If the word &s;poken by angels was &s;tedfa&s;t, and every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and di&s;|obedience received a ju&s;t recompence of re|ward; how &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation, which at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord," &amp;c.? And again: "If he that de&s;pi&s;ed Mo&s;es' law, died without mercy,&mdash;of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment &s;up|po&s;e ye, &s;hall they be thought worthy, who have trodden under foot the Son of God," &amp;c.?</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee then, what is to be the portion of tho&s;e who neglect, in&s;tead of &s;triving to obtain, the &s;alvation revealed in the go&s;pel. They will not only be excluded from eternal glory and happine&s;s in the kingdom of God, continue under wrath, and &s;uffer as tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of God's law; but al&s;o incur a peculiarly aggra|vated condemnation, as de&s;pi&s;ers of that mercy, which provided and revealed a method of &s;al|vation for &s;inners.

III. To repre&s;ent to you the happy and glo|rious con&s;equences of &s;triving &s;ucce&s;sfully, or &s;o as finally to enter in at the &s;trait gate; without pretending to determine at pre&s;ent, whether your endeavours to this end will certainly be effectual, or not. But this is at lea&s;t a po&s;&s;ible &s;uppo&s;ition: And, O! what would you gain, if your endeavours &s;hould actually be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s! This appears, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from what has been &s;aid under the preceeding head of di&s;cour&s;e; &s;o that there will be the le&s;s occa&s;ion, as indeed there is not time, for much enlargement here. Succe&s;s in the&s;e endeavors will be abundantly &s;ufficient, yea, infinitely more than &s;ufficient, to reward all the pains you take, or can take, even tho' you &s;hould &s;pend a thou&s;and, or ten million years, in the mo&s;t inten&s;e application; and allow your&s;elves no re&s;t day or night. For, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, you will obtain eternal deliverance from guilt, condemnation and wrath: And not only &s;o, but be compleatly and everla&s;tingly ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>YOU will obtain eternal deliverance from guilt, condemnation and wrath. The wages of &s;in, you know, is death; or everla&s;ting de|&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord. Now a primary, or main end of the &s;triving enjoined upon us in the text, is, obtaining delive|rance from a &s;tate of guilt, mi&s;ery and ruin; or from the wrath which is to come upon the
<PB N="30" REF="008926_0028_103089F6F7406CA8">
world of the ungodly; as appears from what has been di&s;cour&s;ed above. So that &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e endeavours, or in this &s;triving, implies in the very notion of it, obtaining a full and final relea&s;e from all our &s;ins, and from the puni&s;h|ment due to them. And how glorious a pri|viledge is this! Ble&s;&s;ed indeed is he, who&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are thus forgiven, and who&s;e &s;in is covered; yea, thrice ble&s;&s;ed is that man, unto whom the Lord will not impute iniquity!&mdash;who &s;hall never come into condemnation! If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that to be exempted from puni&s;hment, is but a negative happine&s;s; or that it implies no po&s;itive good in it; be it &s;o. Yet &s;urely, deliverance from evil is worth &s;triving for; e&s;pecially, from &s;o great an evil, as the damnation of hell. Tho' this were <HI>all</HI> that we could hope to obtain by &s;triving; yet, doubtle&s;s, our endeavours to this end would be well be&s;towed.</P>
<P>BUT, as was before ob&s;erved, if you &s;trive effectually, you will not only obtain delive|rance from &s;in and death; but be the heirs of eternal life and glory. That narrow gate, in|to which you &s;trive to enter, is the gate of life, the gate of heaven. And con&s;equently, if you &s;trive effectually, you will gain admi&s;&s;ion into the man&s;ions of everla&s;ting joy. "Eye hath not indeed &s;een, nor ear heard, neither have ente|red into the heart of man, the things which
<PB N="31" REF="008926_0029_103089F9D21209A0">
God hath prepared for them that love him." But, from what he hath revealed unto us by his Spirit, we know in general that the heaven|ly &s;tate is a &s;tate of perfect holine&s;s and happi|ne&s;s; an happine&s;s adapted to the rational na|ture of man; adequate to his mo&s;t exalted wi&s;hes; yea, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all his pre&s;ent con|ceptions; an happine&s;s which will never be in|terrupted or dimini&s;hed; but con&s;tant, immu|table and eternal. And if there were but a bare po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining &s;uch an happine&s;s as this, what rea&s;onable man would not &s;trive in order to it? e&s;pecially when the certain con|&s;equences of neglecting to do &s;o, are taken into con&s;ideration!</P>
<P>WHAT connexion there is between our &s;triving, and actually obtaining the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls, according to the holy &s;criptures, is, by divine permi&s;&s;ion and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to be con&s;idered in another di&s;cour&s;e. But the pre|&s;ent mu&s;t not be concluded without &s;ome &s;hort reflexions on what has been &s;aid already.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. IT appears, that there is &s;omething re|quired of, and to be <HI>done</HI> by &s;inful men, in or|der to their &s;alvation. Our Lord commands us to &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate; and certainly this implies the doing &s;omething;
<PB N="32" REF="008926_0030_103089FBDD531868">
yea, of many things, with a view to obtaining eternal life. Nor is there a &s;ingle command of Chri&s;t in the go&s;pel, but what ought to be o|beyed, partly with this view; though not indeed, under the notion of meriting &s;alvation thereby. How &s;trange? how unnaccountable is it then, that any &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, as &s;ome have done, that there is nothing to be done by &s;in|ners, in order to their &s;alvation; or at lea&s;t, nothing be&s;ides believing! And &s;ome there are, who have gone &s;o far as to &s;ay, that the very in|quiry, What men are to do to obtain eternal life, is an indication of a &s;elf-righteous &s;pirit; and a proof, that the per&s;on who makes it, knows nothing of the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation! What &s;trange infatuation is this! And with how much truth and propriety might it be retorted, that tho&s;e who have &s;uch a conception of the go&s;pel, are them&s;elves gro&s;ly ignorant of it; and need to be taught, even the fir&s;t principles of the oracles of God?</P>
<P N="2">2. IT farther appears, how much tho&s;e are mi&s;taken, who &s;uppo&s;e that the working out their &s;alvation is an <HI>ea&s;y</HI> matter; attended with few or no difficulties; and rather a matter of amu&s;ement, than of great pains, labor and &s;elf-denial; of the mo&s;t inten&s;e application, and vigorous exertions. Our Saviour, who cer|tainly knew every thing relating to this affair, enjoins us to "&s;trive;" or, if the word may
<PB N="33" REF="008926_0031_103089FEC4E55390">
may be allowed, to "agonize," that we may en|ter into life: Plainly importing, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion is at once of &s;uch va&s;t importance, and attended with &s;uch difficulties, as to call for the mo&s;t anxious concern, the mo&s;t fixed re&s;olutions, and unwearied endeavours. And there are divers metaphors u&s;ed in &s;cripture, relative to this mat|ter, which naturally &s;ugge&s;t the &s;ame thing to us: Particularly tho&s;e of "wre&s;tling," "running," and "fighting;" which expre&s;s efforts of &s;trength and activity, joined with warine&s;s and circum&s;pec|tion. The&s;e are all applied to the exerci&s;es, du|ties and employments of the chri&s;tian life; as if a man were to be almo&s;t continually exerting him&s;elf, and upon his guard, as in a race, a fight, or &s;ome other exerci&s;e, which at once requires care, dexterity, and a vigorous exertion of &s;trength: And &s;urely heaven is not prepared as a receptacle, or mighty hive, for the drones of the earth! But if we were to judge by the conduct of &s;ome profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians, and tho&s;e, perhaps, not the wor&s;t that the world affords, we &s;hould be apt to think, that to be, and to live the life of, a chri&s;tian, was a thing of the greate&s;t ea&s;e: and, as was intimated before, rather a matter of a|mu&s;ement, than of habitual care, pains and labor. For how many are there, who apparently, in&s;tead of making the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls their grand concern, the object of their mo&s;t earne&s;t endea|vours, con&s;ider it rather as &s;omething which is be&s;ide the main bu&s;ine&s;s of life; &s;omething &s;ub|ordinate,

not only to the getting riches or power, but even to their <HI>other</HI> diver&s;ions and pa&s;times? There are many per&s;ons of this character in the world; who may yet think them&s;elves in the way of &s;alvation, becau&s;e they make a profe&s;&s;ion of religion; becau&s;e they attend the public wor|&s;hip&mdash;when it &s;uits their <HI>humour;</HI> and are not openly vicious in their lives. But &s;uch per&s;ons will be certainly di&s;appointed, if they expect, in this way, ever to get admi&s;&s;ion into the kingdom of heaven. For can they, with any propriety of language, be &s;aid to &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate? or can they enter there, without &s;triving? What they really &s;trive for, is to obtain wealth, worldly honors, worldly plea&s;ures, and the meat that peri&s;heth; not the pearl of great price, not that honor that cometh from God, not tho&s;e plea&s;ures that are at his right hand, not the meat that endureth unto everla&s;ting life. Let none delude them&s;elves with an imagination, that they are in that "narrow way" that leadeth unto life everla&s;ting, while they live after this thoughtle&s;s, negligent and loo&s;e manner; nor unle&s;s they &s;trive in earne&s;t to enter in at the &s;trait gate, as a matter of infinite concernment to them; in compari&s;on of which, all other things are of tri|vial con&s;equence, hardly worth a &s;erious thought. This is indeed, what our Lord intends when he &s;ays, "one thing is needful."

3. YOU may &s;ee, by what has been &s;aid, not only that &s;triving is nece&s;&s;ary in order to entering into life; but al&s;o, that the <HI>manner</HI> of &s;triving is of great importance. People may take con&s;ider|able pains in religion, with a view to their future happine&s;s; and yet, thro' criminal inattention, not "&s;trive lawfully," or in the manner they ought to do; and &s;o never enter into life. To &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate, is an injunction of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and therefore mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean, &s;triving in a way that is in general a|greeable to the plan of the go&s;pel, the doctrine of our redemption. And if, thro' vicious prejudice, or even thro' want of &s;uch attention as might be rea&s;onably expected of us, we &s;hould wholly mi&s;take in this matter; whatever we do, mu&s;t, on the mo&s;t favourable &s;uppo&s;ition, go for noth|ing. Unle&s;s we &s;trive, in general, in the manner we ought to do, allowing for involuntary mi&s;|takes, we are not in the way that leadeth unto life.

4. LET me earne&s;tly exhort all to &s;trive. Tho' your endeavours &s;hould prove ineffectual; yet, as that is &s;uppo&s;ed at pre&s;ent to be an uncertainty, you are obliged in all rea&s;on to do your be&s;t, leaving the event with God. For this is the &s;itu|ation, the dilemma you are in, as guilty creatures: If you do not &s;trive to obtain deliverance from condemnation, you will, you <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> continue un|der it, and be mi&s;erable hereafter. But if you &s;trive, it is at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible that you <HI>may</HI> obtain deliverance from the wrath to come, and be eter|nally happy. And can you he&s;itate, in this &s;itu|ation, which is the wi&s;er part to take! Do you not &s;trive, in your worldly concernments, when at as great uncertainty about the &s;ucce&s;s of your endeavours? And yet tho&s;e are matters of no importance, in compari&s;on with this: "For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own &s;oul?" In <HI>tho&s;e</HI> affairs, tho' you did not exert your&s;elves with vigor, the damage could be but &s;mall, comparatively &s;peaking; and the gain is but &s;mall and temporary, when your en|deavours are &s;ucce&s;sful. But in <HI>this,</HI> if you are carele&s;s and negligent, you peri&s;h in your &s;ins, and are ruined forever: And if you &s;trive &s;uc|ce&s;sfully, as perhaps you may, your gain is infi|nite; a trea&s;ure that faileth not, a kingdom that hath foundations, a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</P>

BUT to conclude: If there are any who will not &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate of life, let them be per&s;uaded at lea&s;t, not to take pains to go in at that which leadeth to de&s;truction; which is altogether needle&s;s. For this gate is wide, ready to receive all that come; the way thereto is broad, &s;o that it can hardly be mi&s;&s;ed; and there are many who, even without taking pains for it, go in thereat. But yet there are &s;ome per&s;ons, who &s;eem to &s;trive, and take great pains, to enter in at this wide gate: I mean all &s;uch as endeavour to &s;tifle the convictions of their own con&s;ciences; to per&s;uade them&s;elves, that the chri&s;tian revelation is a fable, and to quench the Spirit of God, that &s;triveth with them. There are undoubtedly &s;ome, who really take pains to rid them&s;elves of every religious and moral prin|ciple; of all the re&s;traints of con&s;cience, which they find trouble&s;ome to them; which is no ea&s;y thing, e&s;pecially for tho&s;e who have had a religi|ous education. Some there are, who &s;eem to endeavour to excel in wickedne&s;s; who pride them&s;elves in impiety and vice; in profane cur&s;|ing and &s;wearing, in drinking, wantonne&s;s and riot: Who even "weary them&s;elves to do ini|quity;" and afterwards glory in their &s;hame. Now, all &s;uch per&s;ons may be &s;aid to &s;trive, not to &s;ave, but to de&s;troy their own &s;ouls. But how unnece&s;&s;ary a labor is this!

<Q><HI>STRIVE to enter in at the &s;trait gate.&mdash;</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BY the &s;trait gate is intended, the gate of life, or of the kingdom of heaven. It is called &s;trait, in re&s;pect of the difficulties which attend gaining admi&s;&s;ion into tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed man|&s;ions. By &s;triving to enter at this gate, is meant in general, u&s;ing our &s;incere endeavours to obtain eternal life. But, more particularly, this &s;triving pre&s;uppo&s;es and comprehends in it, a &s;peculative belief of the chri&s;tian revelation; a &s;en&s;e of our &s;inful, peri&s;hing condition; an earne&s;t de&s;ire to obtain the &s;alvation revealed thro' Chri&s;t; &s;erious and diligent inquiry after the way of life; prayer to God for the pardon of &s;in, for his &s;pirit and grace; &s;triving again&s;t &s;in, with an endeavour to keep all God's commandments; &s;till relying,
<PB N="40" REF="008926_0038_10308A1341EA47B8">
not on any &s;uppo&s;ed merit in what we do, but on the mercy of God in Chri&s;t, for acceptance with him. All which implies a partial refor|mation, or a good work begun in the &s;inner, by the word and &s;pirit of God; tho' it does not nece&s;&s;arily imply <HI>that</HI> thorough change, which the &s;criptures expre&s;s by a new and clean heart, by the new creature, and by being born of the Spirit.&mdash;Striving to enter in at the &s;trait gate, is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in order to our &s;alvation. Without it we &s;hall certainly fall &s;hort of eternal life, continue under condemnation, and incur an additional degree of guilt and mi&s;ery, as de&s;pi&s;ers of the grace of God. Such will be the con&s;e|quences of not &s;triving. On the other hand, if we &s;trive effectually, we &s;hall obtain deliverance from the wrath to come; and be inexpre&s;&s;ibly and eternally happy in the kingdom, pre&s;ence and enjoyment of God, the &s;upreme good. So that we have great rea&s;on to &s;trive, tho' there were but a bare po&s;&s;ibility, that our endeavours may be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE &s;everal things here mentioned in a cur&s;o|ry manner, were enlarged on in the preceding di&s;cour&s;e, under three general heads. And there now remains only one point to be con&s;idered, in order to fini&s;h the de&s;ign which I had, when I entered on this &s;ubject. And that is,</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="008926_0039_10308A185DF72098">
IV. WHAT connexion there is, according to the word of God, betwixt our &s;triving, and finally obtaining what is the grand one and object of our endeavours, the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>SOME per&s;ons, and indeed not a few, have &s;uppo&s;ed that there is no certain connexion between any &s;trivings or endeavours of &s;in|ners, and their obtaining eternal life: While others have &s;uppo&s;ed that our &s;ucce&s;s is certain, provided we &s;trive as we may and ought to do, to enter in at the &s;trait gate. To con&s;ider this matter, by the light of God's holy word, and by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is propo&s;ed as the bu&s;ine&s;s of this di&s;cour&s;e. And I &s;hall beg leave to intro|duce what I have to offer upon it, with &s;ome &s;hort remarks, tending to a ju&s;t and clear &s;tating of the point. The fir&s;t of which is,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the que&s;tion does not relate to the &s;triving, or endeavours, of the regenerate; of tho&s;e that are already born of God, or &s;uch as are, in the mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e, true believers and real chri&s;tians. The que&s;tion is not, Whe|ther the endeavours of &s;uch, to obtain &s;alva|tion, &s;hall be effectual or not? For it is al|lowed on all hands, that they &s;hall infallibly be &s;o. All acknowledge, that the go&s;pel plain|ly and directly promi&s;es eternal life to per&s;ons of this character. So that the pre&s;ent inquiry
<PB N="42" REF="008926_0040_10308A1A0AA88BD0">
has no relation to &s;uch. And con&s;equently, it mu&s;t relate wholly to the endeavours of the unregenerate.</P>
<P>2dly. THE que&s;tion is not, Whether &s;inners can be finally &s;aved, without becoming true believers, or real chri&s;tians, in the mo&s;t proper &s;en&s;e? Concerning this matter, there is no more controver&s;y, than there is about the point la&s;t mentioned. For it is allowed on all hands, that without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord; or ever gain admi&s;&s;ion into the king|dom of heaven. This is therefore no part of the que&s;tion before us. Neither,</P>
<P>3dly. Is the que&s;tion, Whether a &s;inful crea|ture can attain to true holine&s;s, and &s;o be en|titled to eternal life, merely by any endeavours of his own, or without the renewing and &s;anctifying influences of the Spirit of God? It is generally, if not univer&s;ally, agreed a|mong&s;t profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians, that repentance unto life, and evangelical holine&s;s, are not at|tainable without the gracious operations of God's holy Spirit; and con&s;equently, that without the&s;e divine influences, all the endea|vours of &s;inners to attain to holine&s;s, and &s;o to eternal life, mu&s;t be ineffectual. Which indeed amounts to neither more nor le&s;s, than what our Lord him&s;elf declares,&mdash;That "except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the king|dom
<PB N="43" REF="008926_0041_10308A1BD7138FF0">
of God." Chri&s;tians do indeed differ con|&s;iderably in their manner of explaining them|&s;elves upon this &s;ubject: But there are few or none, but what do in general a&s;&s;ert the nece&s;&s;i|ty of divine grace, or the influences of God's Spirit, in order to a &s;aving conver&s;ion; or in or|der to a &s;inner's attaining to holine&s;s here, and happine&s;s hereafter. And this is now taken for granted, as a certain and important truth. So that it is no part of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, whether the endeavours of &s;inners will be effectual to their &s;alvation, without the grace of God vouch&s;afed to them, &s;o as to create in them clean hearts, and right &s;pirits? For it is certain, they will not. Neither,</P>
<P>4thly. Is the pre&s;ent que&s;tion, Whether God is obliged, in ju&s;tice, to renew or change the heart of a &s;inner, in con&s;equence of his endea|vours, prayers, or any thing which he can be &s;uppo&s;ed to do? Or, in other words, is obli|ged, in point of ju&s;tice, to &s;ucceed the endea|vours of &s;inners, in order to their attaining to holine&s;s and eternal life? It is generally al|lowed, that God is not bound in ju&s;tice thus to &s;ucceed a &s;inner's endeavours; at lea&s;t, this is now taken for granted. And to &s;uppo&s;e that God is obliged, in point of equity, to do this, would be mo&s;t ab&s;urd, not to &s;ay impious. For, as &s;inners, we have forfeited all right to God's fa|vour; to any good what&s;oever; and are ju&s;t|ly
<PB N="44" REF="008926_0042_10308A1D8A1C7870">
liable to wrath and puni&s;hment. And if &s;o, it is a manife&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency to &s;uppo&s;e, that any thing which a &s;inner does, or can do, &s;hould merit his favourable regards; or ju&s;tly entitle him to tho&s;e influences of the holy Spi|rit, which are nece&s;&s;ary, and which will be effectual, to the &s;inner's &s;alvation. This would be, to &s;uppo&s;e him ju&s;tly liable to wrath for his &s;ins, and at the &s;ame time to have a ju&s;t claim to &s;alvation on account of his endeavours: For to have a ju&s;t claim to &s;alvation, and to have a claim of right to tho&s;e renewing influences of God's Spirit, which have &s;alvation connected with them, amount to the &s;ame thing at la&s;t; And &s;o the &s;uppo&s;itions are equally irrational, From whence it follows,</P>
<P>5thly. THAT if there be any certain con|nexion between the endeavours of &s;inful crea|tures to obtain eternal life, and their actually obtaining it, this is a connexion which the free grace, or unmerited goodne&s;s of God, has made and e&s;tabli&s;hed: And &s;o can be known, only by the gracious promi&s;es or declarations of his word: For, between God's ju&s;tice and his grace there is no medium. If there be &s;uch a connexion, which does not ari&s;e from the former, as certainly it cannot; it mu&s;t of con|&s;equence flow from the latter. And this can be known only from divine revelation: For it is only from the word, declarations and pro|mi&s;es
<PB N="45" REF="008926_0043_10308A206849DF90">
of God, that we can certainly know, to what particular objects, in what manner and mea&s;ure, when, and under what circum&s;tan|ces, God will exerci&s;e grace, or &s;hew mercy to the guilty. Wherefore,</P>
<P>6thly. UPON laying the&s;e &s;everal things to|gether, you will plea&s;e to ob&s;erve, that the in|quiry before us really comes to this at la&s;t, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Whether there are in the word of God, any gracious promi&s;es, invitations, or declarations, re&s;pecting unregenerate &s;inners, to whom the go&s;pel is preached, from whence it may be clearly inferred, that if they &s;trive in the man|ner they may and ought to do, to attain to holine&s;s and eternal life, God will certainly af|ford them all the influences of his Spirit and grace, which are nece&s;&s;ary to that end: So that their endeavours &s;hall not be in vain, but &s;ucceeded by him, and rendered effectual to their &s;alvation? This, it is humbly conceived, is a fair, ju&s;t and plain &s;tate of the important que&s;tion propo&s;ed.&mdash;It may, however, be &s;ta|ted &s;omewhat differently thus, without altering the true import of it, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Whether the gra|cious declarations and promi&s;es of God in his word, are &s;uch as will in any mea&s;ure admit of the &s;uppo&s;ition, that unregenerate &s;inners, to whom the go&s;pel is preached, may de&s;ire, &s;trive, and earne&s;tly endeavour, in the u&s;e of proper means, to obtain the &s;alvation revealed

therein, &s;eeking to God for his grace and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; and yet po&s;&s;ibly fall &s;hort of eternal life, and peri&s;h in their &s;ins, by rea&s;on that God with-holds his Spirit and grace from them? The que&s;tion thus &s;tated, comes preci&s;ely to the &s;ame thing, as in the former way. Or it may be reduced to another form, and &s;till nar|rower compa&s;s, thus: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Whether unrege|nerate &s;inners, under the di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel, have <HI>any</HI> day of grace and &s;alvation afforded to them; in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, that they &s;hall certainly obtain eternal life, provided they heartily de&s;ire it, and &s;trive to that end?&mdash;I have expre&s;&s;ed the true point in que&s;tion, in the&s;e &s;everal ways, not merely for the &s;ake of having it clearly under&s;tood; but partly, be|cau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;ed, that the bare &s;tating it thus, would go a con&s;iderable ways towards a pro|per re&s;olution of it, with tho&s;e that are tole|rably acquainted with the general tenor of holy &s;cripture; unle&s;s their minds are unhappily prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favor of &s;ome un&s;criptural &s;cheme of &s;y&s;tematical divinity.</P>
<P>HAVING prepared the way by the&s;e previ|ous remarks, I &s;hall now proceed more directly to what I had principally in view; which was to prove, by arguments drawn from the holy &s;criptures, That there is a certain connexion between &s;inners &s;triving to obtain the &s;alvation which God has revealed, and their actually

So they are rendered in the margin of &s;ome of our bibles. And being thus under&s;tood, they will be rather more direct and full to the point in view.</NOTE>; teaching us," &amp;c. Now, from &s;uch declarations of holy &s;cripture, we may fairly infer, that all tho&s;e, to whom the go&s;pel is preached, have therein an offer of &s;alvation made to them. For in what other view can
<PB N="49" REF="008926_0047_10308A2D34195B48">
it be con&s;idered, as glad tidings of great joy to all that hear In what other view can it be pro|perly called, the grace of God that bringeth &s;alvation to all men? And if it really makes an offer, or points out a method of &s;alvation to all; can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that any &s;inner, who is willing, and de&s;irous, and &s;trives, to obtain the &s;alvation thus revealed, &s;hould yet be rejected of God, and finally peri&s;h? Certainly it cannot.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) GOD hath declared in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that he hath no plea&s;ure in the death of &s;inners: "As I live, &s;aith the Lord, I have no plea&s;ure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live." Yea, it is declared, that God "will have all men to be &s;aved." Now, if what the&s;e declarations mo&s;t obviou&s;ly and &s;trongly import, be true; &s;urely all who really de&s;ire and &s;trive to obtain eternal life, will certainly obtain it. For if God him&s;elf hath no plea&s;ure in their death, but the contrary; and if they them&s;elves de&s;ire life, and endeavour to obtain it, what &s;hould hinder their &s;alvation? Can the devil be &s;uppo&s;ed to prevent it, on the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions? He cannot, unle&s;s he is &s;tronger, not only than man, but than God him&s;elf!</P>
<P N="3">(3.) ACCORDING to the repre&s;entations of &s;cripture, God affords to &s;inners a &s;pace for repen|tance, a day of grace and &s;alvation; or a &s;ea&s;on for making their peace with him; during which time,
<PB N="50" REF="008926_0048_10308A300A7B9BE8">
he is &s;aid to be "near", &s;o that he "may be found" by them that &s;eek him. Yea, God is repre&s;ent|ed as long-&s;uffering towards them, being unwil|ling that they &s;hould peri&s;h. To which purpo&s;e are the following pa&s;&s;ages, among&s;t innumerable others. "Seek ye the Lord <HI>while he may be found;</HI> call ye upon him <HI>while he is near.</HI> Let the wicked for&s;ake his way;"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. LV. 7</NOTE> &amp;c. <HI>"To day,</HI> if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart, as in the day of temptation&mdash;Forty years was I grieved with this generation,"<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. XCV. 7.</NOTE> &amp;c. "Agree with thine adver&s;ary quickly, <HI>whiles thou art in the way with him;</HI> le&s;t," &amp;c. "He beheld the city, and wept over it, &s;aying, If thou had&s;t known, even thou, at lea&s;t <HI>in this thy day,</HI> the things which belong unto thy peace! but now,"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke XIX. 41. 42.</NOTE> &amp;c. "I gave her <HI>a &s;pace to repent</HI>&mdash;and &s;he repented not"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 11. 21.</NOTE>.&mdash;"Receive not the grace of God in vain&mdash;For he &s;aith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of &s;alvation have I &s;uc|coured thee: Behold now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of &s;alvation<NOTE N="&Dagger;&sect;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor.

"The Lord is not &s;lack concerning his promi&s;e, as &s;ome men count &s;lackne&s;s; but is <HI>long-&s;uffering to us|ward, not willing that</HI> ANY <HI>&s;hould peri&s;h,</HI> but that ALL &s;hould come to repentance<NOTE N="&dagger;&sect;" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. III. 9.</NOTE>." Now, is it con&s;i&s;tent with the&s;e repeated declarations, to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;inners, during this time of their vi|&s;itation, may really de&s;ire and &s;trive to enter in
<PB N="51" REF="008926_0049_10308A34040BA500">
at the &s;trait gate; and yet fall &s;hort of &s;alvation? If God is long-&s;uffering, "not willing that any" of tho&s;e &s;inners, to whom the go&s;pel is preached, &s;hould peri&s;h, but that "all" &s;hould come to re|pentance; certainly he puts them all into a ca|pacity for attaining &s;alvation. To &s;uppo&s;e that any are left in &s;uch a &s;tate, that they cannot avoid peri&s;hing, tho' they de&s;ire it; or in &s;uch a &s;tate, as renders repentance impo&s;&s;ible for them; mani|fe&s;tly &s;uppo&s;es, that God <HI>wills them to peri&s;h,</HI> that he <HI>would not</HI> have them come to repentance; not really allows them a &s;pace for it, in any pro|per &s;en&s;e: And &s;o is directly contrary to the doctrine of &s;cripture&mdash;But let the unbia&s;&s;ed judge.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) IT is farther to be remarked, that during this &s;pace given for repentance, or that day of &s;al|vation, which the &s;criptures &s;o plainly a&s;&s;ert; &s;in|ners are earne&s;tly admoni&s;hed, exhorted and commanded, to &s;eek God, to be reconciled to him, and to work out their &s;alvation. Thus in &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ages but ju&s;t now quoted&mdash;"Seek the Lord while he may be found," &amp;c. "To day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts." So in Prov I. "Wi&s;dom crieth without&mdash;How long. ye &s;imple ones, will ye love &s;implicity? and the &s;corners delight in &s;corn|ing, and fools hate knowledge? Turn you at my reproof," &amp;c. And &s;till more emphatical are the words of the apo&s;tle, in his &s;econd epi&s;tle to the Corinthians; a part of which pa&s;&s;age was
<PB N="52" REF="008926_0050_10308A35D22D7528">
quoted before. But you may plea&s;e to con&s;ider it more at large, as it here follows. "All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to him&s;elf by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and hath given to us the mini&s;try of reconciliation: To wit, that God was in Chri&s;t reconciling THE WORLD unto him&s;elf, not im|puting their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es unto them; and hath com|mitted unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are emba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, <HI>as tho' God did be&s;eech you by us;</HI> we pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be &s;in for us, who knew no &s;in; that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him. We then as workers together with him, be&s;eech you al&s;o, that ye receive not the grace" [the go&s;pel] "of God in vain. For he &s;aith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of &s;alvation have I &s;uccoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time," &amp;c. The&s;e exhorta|tions, and commands, are all directed more e&s;pe|cially to &s;inners; to "the wicked"; to "&s;imple ones, "&s;corners", and "fools"; to &s;uch as were not yet "reconciled to God". And can any un|prejudiced man think it con&s;i&s;tent with them, to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;inners may be awakened to &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;ery in being in a &s;tate of aliena|tion from God, as to de&s;ire to be reconciled to him, and really &s;trive to obtain a part in the &s;al|vation thus revealed; and yet fail of it! Judge for your&s;elves&mdash;</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="53" REF="008926_0051_10308A377A19DB08">
(5.) CONFORMABLY hereto, life and death, ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing, are &s;aid to be &s;et before &s;in|ners, in the word of God; and they are admo|ni&s;hed to choo&s;e life&mdash;"I call heaven and earth to record this day&mdash;that I have &s;et before you life and death, ble&s;&s;ing and cur&s;ing; therefore choo&s;e life",<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. XXX. 19.</NOTE> &amp;c. But, with what truth or pro|priety could life and death be &s;aid to be &s;et be|fore &s;inners, if tho' they de&s;ired life, and heartily endeavour'd to obtain it, they might yet fail thereof? On this &s;uppo&s;ition, it is only death that is really &s;et before them, in any proper, con|&s;i&s;tent &s;en&s;e; without any life or ble&s;&s;ing, in op|po&s;ition thereto&mdash;It were but a cavil to &s;ay, that Mo&s;es, or God by him, here addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the people of I&s;rael upon the footing of mere law; enjoining upon them perfect obedience thereto, as the condition of their attaining life; and de|nouncing death again&s;t them in ca&s;e of the lea&s;t failure. They were already &s;inners, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the law, and are &s;poken of as &s;uch, in the ver&s;e immediately foregoing. So that in re&s;pect of mere law, they were under a cur&s;e already; and were utterly incapacitated to obtain life on the footing of law. Nothing but death was be|fore them in that re&s;pect, tho' they had de&s;ired life. And yet life and ble&s;&s;ing are &s;aid that day to have been &s;et before them, as well as death and cur&s;ing: And they are admoni&s;hed to choo&s;e life, as what was, at that time, attainable, if cho|&s;en;
<PB N="54" REF="008926_0052_10308A3926AD69B8">
for it is added,&mdash;that thou and thy &s;eed may live." It is manife&s;t therefore, that they were not here treated with upon the footing of mere law; life being offered to, or &s;et before them, for their choice, con&s;idered as &s;inners. And if &s;o, the obtaining it depended on their choice, or was connected therewith. And doubtle&s;s, it is not le&s;s truly and properly &s;et before &s;inners now, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, that it was before the I&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">lites in the time of Mo&s;es. From whence we may conclude, that if we really de|&s;ire, and &s;trive to enter into life, we &s;hall not fall &s;hort of it.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) THE &s;criptures &s;peak of &s;ome &s;inners as wholly left, and for&s;aken of God, in this world; given up to their own heart's lu&s;t, to incureable blindne&s;s, to &s;trong delu&s;ion, &amp;c. that they "might be damned." Now if there is any &s;uch thing as &s;uch-like pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture &s;eem to a&s;&s;ert, and as they are u&s;ually under&s;tood; it will even from hence follow, that the per&s;ons thus given up of God, were, antecedently hereto, in a &s;alvable &s;tate; that they had in &s;ome mea&s;ure the re&s;traints and &s;trivings of God's &s;pirit; that they were really put into a capacity for obtaining &s;alvation, had they de&s;ired it; and that their not doing &s;o, was the rea&s;on of their being thus for|&s;aken. And this is agreeable to the repre&s;entati|ons of &s;cripture, in tho&s;e very pa&s;&s;ages, which are here alluded to&mdash;"My people <HI>would</HI> not hear|ken
<PB N="55" REF="008926_0053_10308A3AD16DDA60">
to my voice, and I&s;rael <HI>would</HI> none of me: So I gave them up," &amp;c.&mdash;"If thou had&s;t known, even thou, in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace! but <HI>now</HI> they are hidden from thine eyes"&mdash;"They received not the love of the truth, that they might be &s;aved: And for this cau&s;e God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ion&mdash;that they all might be damned." Their ca&s;e is repre&s;ented as being made de&s;perate, by their be|ing thus given up of God; and this is a&s;cribed to their neglect of a former opportunity, in which they were in a capacity for attaining &s;alvation. And indeed, if they were not, the "things which belonged unto their peace", were really hid from their eyes before, as truly as afterwards. If God gave them up, becau&s;e they would not hearken to his voice; then they were not given up before they refu&s;ed to do &s;o; but might have obtained life, had they &s;ought after it: without which &s;up|po&s;ition, there &s;eems to be no ground for any &s;uch di&s;tinction as is apparently made between their &s;tate before, and their &s;tate after, God thus gave them over.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) THE &s;criptures &s;peak plainly and directly of &s;inners neglecting the opportunity allowed them for obtaining life, as the real cau&s;e of their death or de&s;truction.&mdash;"Becau&s;e I have called, and ye refu&s;ed; I have &s;tretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have &s;et at nought all my coun&s;el&mdash;I al&s;o will laugh at your calami|ty

But neither of the&s;e things can be truly and properly &s;aid of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who are awakened to &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their &s;ins, as re|ally to de&s;ire the &s;alvation revealed, and to &s;trive in order thereto; even tho' they are not (which is very &s;uppo&s;eable) already in a regenerate &s;tate. And therefore all &s;uch per&s;ons, unle&s;s they cea&s;e to de&s;ire and &s;trive thus, &s;hall be &s;aved; not, to be &s;ure, without being born of God; but they

<P N="8">(8.) SINNERS have a promi&s;e of the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom, or of &s;piritual wi&s;dom, with which eter|nal life is connected, if they hearken to God's re|proof, and diligently &s;eek it.

But it will perhaps be &s;aid, that none but a regenerate man, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to "turn at God's, or wi&s;dom's, reproof," or to "wait at the po&s;ts of her doors," in the &s;en&s;e here intend|ed: and con&s;equently, that none but &s;uch can be entitled to the promi&s;e, or ble&s;&s;ing. But this were an arbitrary a&s;&s;ertion; one, for which there is not the lea&s;t colour or foundation. For the per|&s;ons here addre&s;&s;ed, are &s;poken to under the cha|racter of "&s;imple ones," "&s;corners," and "fools"; who certainly need wi&s;dom the mo&s;t of any. And the promi&s;e is apparently made for the encou|ragement of &s;uch, to turn at her reproof, and to watch daily at her gates; that they might find her, and thereby "find life." This was therefore to be done by them, antecedently to their obtaining

&s;piritual wi&s;dom; not in the actual exerci&s;e of it, as the regenerate, who are already wi&s;e unto &s;al|vation, are to &s;eek for more wi&s;dom.

<P N="9">(9.) IN Ezekiel [chap. xxxvi.] God declares his purpo&s;e to do many things for the people of I&s;rael; and, among&s;t the re&s;t, to give them a "new heart" and a "new &s;pirit".<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 26.</NOTE> But he adds af|terwards, "I will yet for this be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ver. 37.</NOTE>": which unque&s;tionably relates in part, to the new heart and new &s;pirit, &s;poken of before. Upon which we may briefly remark, That eternal life, or &s;alvation, is connected in &s;cripture with the hav|ing

Here you will ob&s;erve, that the "good things" promi&s;ed, are &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings; &s;uch as have eternal life connected with them; as is manife&s;t from a parallel place in another evangeli&s;t, where the&s;e good things are explained to mean, the Holy Spirit&mdash;"How much more &s;hall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that a&s;k him?" You will farther ob&s;erve, that the obtaining the&s;e &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings is expre&s;ly connected with, and promi&s;|ed to, a&s;king, &s;eeking, knocking. But then it will perhaps be &s;aid, that this mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean, the a&s;king, &amp;c. of the regenerate; and that it cannot be intended of the de&s;ires, prayers and endeavours of the unregenerate. But does there appear any good rea&s;on for limiting the promi&s;e in this manner? It is humbly conceived, there is none: But that it ought to be under|&s;tood conformably to what our Lord had &s;aid before&mdash;that they who hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall be filled. The words were &s;poken by him to the promi&s;cuous multitude of his profe&s;&s;ed followers: and there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that all the&s;e were then in a regene|rate &s;tate. That any of them were &s;o, cannot be inferred merely from God's being &s;poken of in this pa&s;&s;age, under the character, or title, of their "Father" in heaven. For he is &s;aid to be the
<PB N="63" REF="008926_0061_10308A572D85FDE0">
"God and Father of ALL"; not only of the rege|nerate, tho' they are in a peculiar &s;en&s;e his child|ren, his &s;ons and daughters. This common Father has many evil and di&s;obedient, as well as good and obedient children. And the per&s;ons here &s;poken to, are &s;poken to as <HI>evil.</HI> "If ye then, being <HI>evil",</HI> &amp;c. From whence it might be at lea&s;t as fairly argued, that they were not in a re|generate &s;tate, as it could, that they were, from God's being &s;tiled their Father. For where do you find tho&s;e that are born of God, his &s;ons by adoption, and &s;piritual renovation, called <HI>evil</HI> in &s;cripture? However, no great &s;tre&s;s ought to be laid upon this: for even &s;uch per&s;ons may doubt|le&s;s be &s;tiled <HI>evil</HI> in a comparative &s;en&s;e; as our Lord &s;ays, "There is none <HI>good</HI> but One, that is God." But there is &s;till le&s;s rea&s;on to conclude the&s;e per&s;ons were born of God, from his being &s;poken of as their Father: For, as before ob&s;er|ved, he is the Father of ALL: And all in com|mon are directed to pray to him under this very character&mdash;"Our Father which art in heaven"&mdash;Had not this cavil been produced as a &s;erious ar|gument, and much in&s;i&s;ted on by &s;ome, it would have been a &s;hame to &s;ay &s;o much about it: which mu&s;t be my apology&mdash;I would farther ob&s;erve here, that the&s;e promi&s;es of our Saviour to &s;uch as a&s;k, &s;eek and knock, &s;eem to be more e&s;pecially de&s;igned and calculated for the encou|ragement of the unregenerate to &s;eek God, and &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings. For the "good things" pro|mi&s;ed,
<PB N="64" REF="008926_0062_10308A58F238AC98">
as explained by St. Luke, are &s;uch as are comprehended in the "gift of the holy &s;pirit:" The promi&s;e of which, in con&s;equence of a&s;king, &s;eeking and knocking, is &s;o far from &s;uppo&s;ing that the per&s;ons who do &s;o, are already regene|rate, or that the &s;pirit is given to them prior to their a&s;king; that it rather implies the direct con|trary; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that they had not the &s;pirit, in the &s;en&s;e here intended by our Saviour. For if they are &s;uppo&s;ed, at the time of their a&s;king, to have the &s;pirit of God dwelling in them, to "abide with them for ever," as all the &s;ons of God by regeneration and adoption have, what becomes of the promi&s;e? What are they to have in con&s;e|quence of a&s;king, &amp;c? Is it only the continu|ance of the &s;pirit, or larger mea&s;ures of it?&mdash;But the&s;e are, I think, never called, <HI>giving the &s;pirit,</HI> in the language of &s;cripture: which means the <HI>original</HI> be&s;towment of it [or him] on &s;uch as were de&s;titute of it; in con&s;equence of which, they are &s;aid to be born of the &s;pirit, or of God.

&s;atisfactory and conclu&s;ive evidence in favour of the doctrine propo&s;ed to be proved: but a full blaze of it, &s;o as to take away even the po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, from any per&s;on of a to|lerable comprehen&s;ion of mind, who &s;eriou&s;ly attends to it;&mdash;unle&s;s he is under the influ|ence of &s;ome very unhappy, tho' I do not &s;ay, criminal prejudices&mdash;But you are to judge for your &s;elves.</P>

From whence it is manife&s;t, that our Lord does not mean, that they "&s;hall not be able", tho' they &s;trive during the time of their vi&s;itation; but after it is elap&s;ed. For he proceeds thus: "When once the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e is <HI>ri&s;en up,</HI> and hath <HI>&s;hut to the door,</HI> and ye begin to &s;tand without, and to knock at the door, &s;ay|ing, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he &s;hall an&s;wer and &s;ay unto you, I know you not whence you are: Then &s;hall ye begin to &s;ay, We have eaten and drunk in thy pre&s;ence," &amp;c.

<PB N="72" REF="008926_0070_10308A70217A09B0">
&s;o far from implying, that they &s;hall not be able to enter in, tho' they &s;trive during the day of their vi&s;itation, that it implies the di|rect contrary, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that the door is not then <HI>&s;hut,</HI> but <HI>open;</HI> and that they are <HI>able,</HI> all things being con&s;idered, to enter in thereat, if they really &s;trive to this end. So that the&s;e words are plainly parallel with tho&s;e in Proverbs&mdash;"Becau&s;e I have called, and ye refu&s;ed;&mdash;I al&s;o will laugh at your calamity&mdash;when your fear cometh as de&s;olation, and your de&s;truction cometh as a whirlwind; when di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h cometh upon you.

In which words it is al&s;o clearly implied, that if &s;inners &s;trive, call on God, and &s;eek him dili|gently, before that time cometh, he will &s;ure|ly an&s;wer, and be found of them.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be farther &s;aid, that an unrege|nerate man cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;trive, &s;eek, or do any thing el&s;e, in a truly holy manner, &s;o as to be plea&s;ing to God; and con&s;equently, that God cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have connec|ted the attaining of eternal life with their en|deavours: It is an&s;wered, That what God has connected eternal life with, can be known only from his own word. To <HI>that</HI> we have been appealing; and have found, that he has therein actually connected &s;alvation with the endea|vours
<PB N="73" REF="008926_0071_10308A71D43E2100">
of &s;inners. And there is &s;ome real dif|ference between the temper and actions of a|wakened &s;inners;&mdash;awakened by God's own word and &s;pirit; hungring and thir&s;ting after righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate; and the temper and actions of tho&s;e, who are proceeding headlong in their criminal cour&s;es. Tho' the actions of the former are no ways me|ritorious, yet they are certainly, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, not &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to God, as tho&s;e of the latter. Yea; &s;ince God has commanded the unregenerate, while and as &s;uch, to &s;trive, &s;eek, &amp;c. it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, that he requires them to &s;trive in the exerci&s;e of &s;uch faculties as they have, not of &s;uch as they have not. Their &s;triving in the exerci&s;e of the&s;e powers, may therefore properly be cal|led obedience to him, or &s;aid to partake of the nature thereof. And if there be in it <HI>any thing</HI> of the nature of obedience, it has al&s;o <HI>&s;omething</HI> of the nature of good; and &s;o cannot be <HI>wholly</HI> unplea&s;ing to God. It mu&s;t therefore render tho&s;e who perform it, more &s;uitable objects of his favour and mercy than tho&s;e are, who do not &s;trive; but commit iniquity with greadine&s;s. And if &s;uch &s;inners are in the lea&s;t degree more &s;uitable objects of mercy, than the thoughtle&s;s and hard|ned, this affords an intelligible rea&s;on why God, willing to &s;hew his mercy, &s;hould connect eternal life with the <HI>&s;triving</HI> of the former; at lea&s;t in preference to the <HI>crimes</HI> of the latter:&mdash;Tho' it is by no means under the notion of any
<PB N="74" REF="008926_0072_10308A74AA271B70">
real merit, or good de&s;ert in tho&s;e who &s;trive, that God has promi&s;ed his holy Spirit, and there|with, eternal life to them. Be&s;ides: In the way of objecting above-mentioned, it might be thought irrational to &s;uppo&s;e, that God had connected eternal &s;alvation with any thing in, or done by, the regenerate them&s;elves. For is there not im|perfection and &s;in attending even them, and what|ever they do? And yet it is acknowledged, that God has connected eternal life with their &s;aith, love, &amp;c. tho' it is for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, that the&s;e promi&s;es are made to them; not on account of any merit in them&s;elves. To &s;um up all in a word: Tho&s;e who object in this manner, &s;eem to forget, that in the go&s;pel God is profe&s;&s;edly treating with us <HI>as</HI> degenerate, &s;inful creatures, who can do noth|ing that is perfectly holy, and who de&s;erve wrath;&mdash;that he is treating with us about our eternal happine&s;s, upon quite another footing than that of law or ju&s;tice, for the manife&s;tation of his goodne&s;s and grace;&mdash;upon the footing of a new covenant e&s;tabli&s;hed in a Mediator, who died for all, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t; in whom, all the promi&s;es of God to &s;inners are made, and in whom they are all "yea and amen." Had the&s;e things been duly con&s;idered, &s;urely we &s;hould not have had this objection &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on as it has been, That no actions of the unregene|rate are truly good and holy; and therefore, that no promi&s;es of good can be &s;uppo&s;ed annexed to their endeavours; to any thing that they

can do. Which objection is intirely grounded on a fal&s;e hypothe&s;is; a feeble &s;upport, which being taken away, the objection falls of cour&s;e; and appears, as it really is, weak and un&s;olid, tho' in&s;i&s;ted on by &s;ome worthy men.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould be farther objected, that this doc|trine of a certain connexion between &s;triving, and obtaining &s;alvation, has a tendency to give ea&s;e to the minds of &s;inners; and to make them re&s;t &s;atisfied with &s;omething &s;hort of regene|ration, under a notion that they are already in a &s;afe e&s;tate, in re&s;pect of their endeavours; and &s;o may be a means of de&s;troying, in&s;tead of &s;av|ing their &s;ouls: It is an&s;wered, That if it mini|&s;ters hope to awakened &s;inners, and no more than the go&s;pel affords; &s;o much the better: and, that it really affords them no more, has been ful|ly &s;hown. Our merciful Redeemer de&s;igned that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould have comfort and hope; he gives it to them him&s;elf; in which re&s;pect they have a right to it: And what the Lord <HI>giveth,</HI> his &s;ervants &s;hould not <HI>take away.</HI>&mdash;As to the tendency of this doctrine to lull &s;inners into a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, or to make them cea&s;e &s;triving; this is quite remote from good &s;en&s;e. What! does telling them, that they mu&s;t &s;trive with per&s;everance; that this is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and that if they continue to &s;trive, it &s;hall not be in vain; does this tend to make them remi&s;s, and think them&s;elves &s;afe without &s;triving! How ab|&s;urd

is this! But this objection may be retorted with unan&s;werable force, again&s;t the contrary doc|trine. For if &s;inners are told, that there is no &s;ort of connexion between any of their endea|vours, and obtaining eternal life; but that they may peri&s;h after all; this has a direct and mani|fe&s;t tendency to di&s;hearten them; and make them give over tho&s;e endeavours, which, they &s;uppo&s;e, may be thus fruitle&s;s. For hope is one of the mo&s;t powerful &s;prings of action; and endeavours are incompatible with de&s;pair.&mdash;In &s;hort: the doctrine of this di&s;cour&s;e, which affords &s;o much con&s;olation to heavy-laden &s;inners, is no other than the good tidings of great joy, which were to be unto all people; the very doctrine of Him who &s;aid&mdash;<Q>The Spirit of the Lord God is up|on me, becau&s;e the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath &s;ent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to pro|claim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the pri&s;on to them that are bound: To pro|claim the acceptable year of the Lord&mdash;to comfort all that mourn: To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion; to give unto them beauty for a&s;hes, the oil of joy for mourning, the gar|ment of prai&s;e for the &s;pirit of heavine&s;s: that they might be called trees of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai.

THIS &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ts numerous, and very important reflexions; but there is time only for the few which follow.</P>
<P>1&s;t. WE &s;ee from hence the wonderful good|ne&s;s and mercy of God; ina&s;much as he has given us the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of pardon and eternal life, on &s;uch terms as, by his offered grace, we may all comply with, if we really de&s;ire to do it: Which ought to be acknowledged with the warme&s;t gratitude, to the glory of his name. And how ju&s;tly is the revelation which di&s;covers this grace, and unfolds the my&s;teries of it; which di&s;pels our anxious fears, and rai&s;es guilty worms to the hopes of glory, honor and immortality: How ju&s;tly is this called, "good tidings of great joy!"&mdash;What manner of love hath the Father be&s;towed upon us!</P>
<P>2dly. IT appears, that tho' the &s;alvation of tho&s;e that are &s;aved, is intirely of grace; yet the de&s;truction of all who peri&s;h under the di&s;pen&s;a|tion of the go&s;pel, will be entirely of them&s;elves; as being owing, not &s;o properly to this, that they were &s;inful creatures, (for that is common to them with tho&s;e that are &s;aved) as to their neg|lect and contempt of that method of &s;alvation from &s;in, which was revealed to them. Nor will one of the&s;e mi&s;erable men be able to plead in the judgment of the great day&mdash;"Lord, I care|fully attended to thy go&s;pel, and heartily &s;trove,
<PB N="78" REF="008926_0076_10308A8293E05930">
according to thy command, to enter in at the &s;trait gate: Do not therefore, I be&s;eech thee by the bowels of thy mercy, now &s;hut it again&s;t me!&mdash;Lord, Lord, open unto me; for I believed thy words; and earne&s;tly endeavoured to walk in that path of life, which was marked out by thee."&mdash;Many, we know, will be able to plead, "We have eaten and drunk in thy pre&s;ence; and thou ha&s;t taught in our &s;treets." But this is a very different thing; a plea of no real force, as the other would evidently be. And if none will be able to make the former, as they certainly will not; what can they &s;ay again&s;t the righteou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a &s;entence as this?&mdash;"Depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."</P>
<P>3dly. LET all therefore be exhorted to &s;trive, now they are "able" to enter in at the &s;trait gate; le&s;t they &s;hould thus &s;eek to enter in here|after, and "not be able." Is it not worth while, my brethren, to &s;trive, that you may e&s;cape the wrath to come? that you may receive a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s and glory from the Lord's hand; and be admitted to "&s;it down with Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God?" Is it not, that you may be admitted to &s;it with Chri&s;t on his throne, "even as he al&s;o overcame, and is &s;et down with his Father on his throne!" What great pains do you take to avoid &s;ome incon&s;iderable evil, and
<PB N="79" REF="008926_0077_10308A8564BA7358">
to obtain &s;ome incon&s;iderable good, even when the &s;ucce&s;s of your endeavours is uncertain? And will you not endeavour to avoid &s;o great an evil as "everla&s;ting de&s;truction?" and to obtain &s;o ine&s;timable a prize as is now &s;et before you;&mdash;"the prize of our high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us?"&mdash;e&s;pecially when you are a&s;&s;ured by the word and promi&s;e of God, that he will render your endeavours effectual to the&s;e important ends? Will you not &s;trive, when He invites? when He commands, who hath both "the key of David," of the kingdom of heaven; and the "keys of hell and of death!"&mdash;who openeth and no man &s;hutteth; and &s;hutteth, and no man openeth! Do not, I be&s;eech you, delay: For human life is precarious; and altho' your own &s;hould be pro|longed, yet if you go on to provoke God by your &s;ins, he may perhaps give you over to a re|probate mind; &s;o that you will only live to fill up the mea&s;ure of your &s;ins. "To day then, if you will hear his voice!"&mdash;</P>
<P>4thly. LET me exhort all tho&s;e, who may imagine that they &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate; and &s;o, that they are in the way that lead|eth unto life, to examine them&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly as to this point. There are many per&s;ons who think of this matter, and do &s;omething with a view to their future happine&s;s; who cannot yet be &s;aid to &s;trive in the &s;en&s;e of our Saviour. Have you ever been awakened to a &s;en&s;e of your
<PB N="80" REF="008926_0078_10308A872D9E7780">
&s;ins? Are your de&s;ires to obtain the "great &s;alva|tion," &s;trong in &s;ome proportion to its impor|tance? &s;tronger than, to obtain any worldly good? Do you diligently inquire after the way of life, which God has revealed? Do you make it your practice to pray to him? Do you endeavour to mortify your lu&s;ts? Do you &s;trive to keep his known commandments; &s;till acknowledging that you are unprofitable &s;ervants; and &s;aying with the publican, "God be merciful to me a a &s;inner?" If you do not &s;trive, after &s;ome &s;uch manner as this, you cannot be thought to &s;trive in the way which Chri&s;t commands: And you know the con&s;equence.&mdash;But if you do thus, I may &s;afely tell you at lea&s;t, that you are not far from the kingdom of God; that you are in the way of his ble&s;&s;ing; and that "in due time you &s;hall reap, if you faint not."</P>
<P>5thly. IT appears, I think, that the main point which I have endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h in this di&s;|cour&s;e, is not only a certain truth, but a very important one. It is &s;o, particularly in two re&s;|pects. It is a clear and full vindication, both of the ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of God, in his dealings with men: As it &s;hews, that he has actually put tho&s;e who live under the go&s;pel, into a ca|pacity of obtaining &s;alvation, if they de&s;ire it; and con&s;equently, that tho&s;e who peri&s;h, will be, in a &s;trictly proper &s;en&s;e, their own de&s;troyers. Whereas, if this doctrine is denied, it will not be
<PB N="81" REF="008926_0079_10308A8A008018F8">
&s;o ea&s;y to make the&s;e things appear. Such a denial will bear hard on the veracity and &s;incerity of God in his word, wherein he declareth his great love and compa&s;&s;ion to &s;inful men: And it will be impo&s;&s;ible on this &s;uppo&s;ition, (that we may &s;trive, and yet not obtain) to &s;hew the ju&s;tice of pu|ni&s;hing all &s;uch as fall &s;hort of this &s;alvation, in a &s;ignal, exemplary manner, as de&s;pi&s;ers of God's grace. But all this will be clear and manife&s;t, if eternal life is really connected with &s;triving&mdash;This is an important doctrine in another re&s;pect: Sinners ought to have all the encouragement to &s;trive, which can be given them according to the word of God. We know, alas! how backward men generally are to take pains in religion; how difficultly they are per&s;waded to for&s;ake their wicked practices; and to <HI>labour</HI> here, that they may finally enter into <HI>re&s;t.</HI> All po&s;&s;ible encourage|ment, therefore, ought to be given them, in order to overcome this reluctance. And it is plain, that there is far greater encouragement, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that there is a certain con|nexion between their &s;triving and obtaining, than on the contrary, that all their endeavours, however diligent, uninterrupted, and of long continuance, may perhaps be in vain. Be the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls of ever &s;o much impor|tance; yet if they &s;uppo&s;e that this may be the ca&s;e, it mu&s;t needs prove a great di&s;courage|ment to them. Such doubt, or uncertainty,
<PB N="82" REF="008926_0080_10308A8E086A3C60">
has a direct tendency to di&s;hearten them; to damp their endeavours: Tho' it is allowed, that we ought in rea&s;on to &s;trive, even upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of &s;uch uncertainty.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee then, my brethren, how much tho&s;e who deny, there is any &s;ort of connexion between the mo&s;t earne&s;t endeavours of &s;in|ners, and their obtaining eternal life, di&s;honor God, by denying his grace in one material point; we &s;ee how their doctrine tends to di&s;|courage tho&s;e, who are really "&s;eeking the way to Zion;" how, to "break the brui&s;ed reed, and quench the &s;moaking flax"; and, in fine, how it tends rather to excu&s;e tho&s;e who fall &s;hort of &s;alvation, than to ju&s;tify the ways of God to men. All this is manife&s;t: Tho', by the way, I am far from charging any ill intention on tho&s;e who deny &s;uch a connexion as has been &s;poken of. But their doctrine is certainly bad, however good their de&s;igns be; of which God is the only proper judge&mdash;But &s;ome there are, who go much further: They not only deny any certain connexion; but a&s;|&s;ert that a per&s;on, going on in his &s;ins without remor&s;e, is altogether as <HI>likely</HI> to obtain &s;alva|tion at la&s;t, as one who is convinced of his &s;in|ful &s;tate, and u&s;es his utmo&s;t endeavours to obtain eternal life! Yea, there are, who go beyond this; a&s;&s;erting that all an unregene|rate man does, or can do, is &s;o far from ha|ving any real tendency to promote his &s;alva|tion,
<PB N="83" REF="008926_0081_10308A90DFF745F8">
that it is but rebellion again&s;t God, and &s;o &s;ets him at a &s;till greater di&s;tance from Him! To &s;uch lengths as the&s;e, &s;ome men have gone, in pur&s;uance of certain fal&s;e principles which they have unhappily imbibed, as principles of chri&s;tianity: Yea, and have repre&s;ented the belief of the&s;e impious notions, as e&s;&s;ential ar|ticles of faith; as if tho&s;e who denied them, were both &s;trangers and enemies to the grace of God! Now, if only the denial of any cer|tain connexion between the endeavours of &s;in|ners, and their obtaining eternal life, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure to di&s;honor God; to throw need|le&s;s di&s;couragements in the way of tho&s;e who &s;trive to obtain &s;alvation, and to prevent others from &s;triving; what &s;hall we &s;ay of this other doctrine, which &s;uppo&s;es all the endeavours of the unregenerate, rather to aggravate their guilt, and &s;o, their damnation, than to pro|mote their future well-being! What is the re|&s;ult of &s;uch doctrine as this, but that &s;inners &s;hould keep them&s;elves as &s;ecure and uncon|cerned as po&s;&s;ible, in&s;tead of &s;triving to enter in at the &s;trait gate? the former being, of the two, more likely to i&s;&s;ue in their &s;alvation, than the latter. Whatever apology may be made for tho&s;e, who only deny a connexion; it is extremely difficult to make any tole|rable one, for the&s;e other per&s;ons mentioned, unle&s;s it be this, that they are be&s;ide them|&s;elves, and know not what they &s;ay. For the&s;e notions are &s;o oppo&s;ite to rea&s;on, and the
<PB N="84" REF="008926_0082_10308A92C1DBA5A0">
whole tenor of &s;cripture; they tend &s;o directly to make, or to keep men, wicked; that if any one, in his &s;en&s;es, <HI>could</HI> be &s;uppo&s;ed to advance them, we could hardly put any other con&s;truc|tion upon his doing &s;o, than that he de&s;igned to repre&s;ent the ever good and glorious God in the mo&s;t odious light po&s;&s;ible; to bring a re|proach upon the chri&s;tian religion; to di&s;cou|rage &s;inners from endeavouring to obtain the &s;alvation revealed therein; and even to fill the world with all manner of impiety and vice. Which God forbid any man &s;hould really de|&s;ign! And rather than believe, any are &s;o a|bandoned, we ought charitably to hope that tho&s;e who teach &s;uch doctrines, are <HI>only out of their wits</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publi&s;heth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publi&s;heth &s;alvation!</Q>&mdash;But what if one of tho&s;e, who &s;hould be the bearers of the&s;e tidings, &s;hould bring only &s;uch as the&s;e?&mdash;<Q>Men and brethren!

No! in order to your e&s;caping eternal damnation, and entering in|to the kingdom of heaven, it is nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould become true chri&s;tians, or new creatures. But this is as much out of your power, as to create new worlds, or to annihilate the old: Neither may you depend on the grace of God to renew and &s;anctify you, tho' you &s;hould cry day and night unto him, and &s;trive to put your&s;elves in the way of his ble&s;&s;ing. All this may prove in vain. Yea, tho&s;e per&s;ons who are going on in their &s;ins without any remor&s;e, are at lea&s;t as likely (if not more &s;o) to be|come &s;ubjects of the &s;pecial, &s;aving grace of God, as you will be with all your &s;trivings, while in an unregenerate &s;tate. You need &s;piritual wi&s;dom; and are indeed directed to pray for it: but unle&s;s this wi&s;dom is fir&s;t given to you, you cannot pray for it &s;o as to obtain it. You need a new heart; but you mu&s;t fir&s;t have &s;uch an heart, before you can "inquire" of God aright, to be|&s;tow it on you. You need the pardon of &s;in, for which you are al&s;o to pray; but un|le&s;s you are fir&s;t in a regenerate, and there|fore

fore in a pardoned &s;tate, God may not hear your prayers, and pardon your &s;ins. You need a principle of &s;piritual life; for which you are to apply your&s;elves to God in Chri&s;t; but then you are to remember, that you are to carry this &s;ame principle with you, in going to God for it; or to pray in the actual exerci&s;e of it, when you pray for it: Otherwi&s;e you cannot expect that God will give it to you&mdash;You &s;ee plainly then, that all your prayers and endeavours, while unregenerate, may be to no purpo&s;e&mdash;Yea, farther: To deal plainly and &s;incerely with you, I mu&s;t tell you, that all &s;uch prayers and &s;trivings, in&s;tead of having the lea&s;t tendency to pro|mote your &s;alvation, are but rebellion again&s;t God; and &s;o may, not improbably, be a means of increa&s;ing your damnation.&mdash;Such duties are more to be feared than your <HI>other &s;ins</HI>&mdash;It is, however, po&s;&s;ible that God may &s;ave &s;ome of you, by a &s;overeign, irre&s;i&s;table act of his grace, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly changing your hearts; whether you do, or do not &s;eek him.&mdash;The&s;e are the good ti|dings of great joy, which I bring you in the name of my divine MASTER. And now, O what marvellous love is manife&s;ted to a guilty world, in the redemption there|of by Je&s;us Chri&s;t! How rich, how abun|dant is this goodne&s;s!
