The mo&s;t <HI>immediate</HI> government of the world, if God had cho&s;en &s;uch a method, could have afforded no degree of trouble to that my&s;teriou&s;ly perfect Being, who is nece&s;&s;arily infinite in happine&s;s: In his wi&s;dom, however, He has cho&s;en to u&s;e, in a great variety of in&s;tances, the <HI>media|tion</HI> of others, for carrying on the de&s;igns of his providence. Agreeably, civil rulers, in this world, are in the number of His mini&s;ters, or &s;ervants. They are <HI>con&s;tituted</HI> by <HI>Him. There is no power</HI> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) <HI>but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI> It is agree|able to the <HI>will of God,</HI> that there &s;hould be civil government: <HI>He</HI> has given to mankind that <HI>rea&s;on</HI> which points to it, as u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary; and, in general terms, the magi&s;trate is rai&s;ed up, and inve&s;ted with his office, in the cour&s;e of <HI>divine providence.</HI></P>
<P>CIVIL rulers are ordained of God; but the doctrine of their being divinely appointed, rightly under&s;tood, no more

militates again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ition that the people ought to have a voice in the elevation of tho&s;e who are, in a civil &s;en&s;e, to rule them, than the doctrine of God's appointing go&s;pel mini&s;ters interferes with the &s;uppo&s;ition of a right in the churches to elect their own pa&s;tors. He never de&s;igned, mediately or imme|diately, to appoint rulers over the people, in &s;tate or church, &s;o as to debar <HI>them</HI> from the privilege of choo&s;ing their own officers (except in a few extraordinary in&s;tances of ancient date) and they, who attempt to deprive the people of &s;uch a privilege, oppo&s;e them&s;elves equally, to the will of God, and to the rights of mankind.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The People may, by a con&s;titution, make an office hereditary in a Family, or leave it to particular per&s;ons to appoint rulers, agreeably to a con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by the whole &s;ociety, when, &s;o far, and &s;o long as they think it be&s;t; but &s;till they have an unaliena|ble right to alter &s;uch con&s;titution at plea&s;ure, and to interpo&s;e <HI>immediately</HI> in the election of their officers, whenever they judge it proper.</NOTE></P>

<P>GOD would have His civil mini&s;ters to prove, <HI>a terror to evil works; to puni&s;h evil doers</HI>&mdash;by &s;alutary laws, hone&s;tly and honorably executed, to &s;ave the &s;tate from foreign injurious invaders (while they are circum&s;pectful, to leave

It is al&s;o His plea&s;ure, that they &s;hould be <HI>a prai&s;e to them that do well</HI>&mdash;&s;hould properly honour and en|courage them. When the virtuous and the good are frowned on and di&s;graced, when laudable exertions for publick utility are damped and checked, when the perpetrators of wickedne&s;s noxious to &s;ociety are not terrified and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, but &s;creened and promoted, there is a &s;orrowful, and not blamele&s;s deviation from the de&s;ign of the righteous <HI>God, the father of mercies,</HI> in the in&s;titution of civil government.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of Govern|ment, it is of con&s;equence that men &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed with capacity, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of enlarged knowledge, re&s;|pecting the nature of their office, the extent of their power, the &s;tate &s;ufferings,

and dangers of the people, their intere&s;ts, and what may conduce to their relief, &s;ecurity and happine&s;s: but men of &s;uch greatne&s;s (like elephants in war) are not to be <HI>depended</HI> on, as per&s;ons who will <HI>&s;teadily</HI> pur&s;ue the publick good, unle&s;s they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that publick &s;pirit, which the charitable Go&s;pel infu&s;es, and &s;o have the end of government at <HI>heart.</HI> Avarice and ambition may carry men con&s;iderable lengths, in mea&s;ures which are for publick advantage, when they perceive that &s;uch mea&s;ures will be&s;t gratify the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions; but if they are enriched with no higher principles, whenever it &s;o happens, that there is an interference between the gratification of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, and a pur&s;uance of the publick good, which is likely to be fre|quently the ca&s;e, the happine&s;s of mul|titudes will probably fall a &s;acrifice to the vile affections of a few. Whereas, publick &s;pirit, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as it ought to be, predominates over every private worldly affection, and cau&s;es every pri|vate worldly intere&s;t, incompatible with the public welfare, to fall a &s;acrifice to

<P>IT has been &s;aid, that the mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel ought to have no concern in political matters; but, that God's civil mini&s;ters ought to &s;tand at a di&s;tance from every thing relating to re|ligion, we do not afirm. They have a right to govern the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t's Spiritual Kingdom. The clergy, in|&s;tead of arrogating to them&s;elves an in|&s;olent papal power of depo&s;ing Kings and Emperors, are as much obliged to be in &s;ubjection to civil powers, as other ranks of men. The rights of con&s;cience are to be treated with the greate&s;t deli|cacy; but if people, under a <HI>pretence</HI> of con&s;cience, conduct manife&s;tly to the
<PB N="14" REF="013053_0013_0F8FF61D33D43810">
material damage of Society, the civil arm has a right to re&s;train them. It is the part of civil powers to encourage and promote religion, as <HI>that</HI> is condu|cive to the benefit of Society; particu|larly, as it gives people due veneration for <HI>an Oath,</HI> which <HI>for confirmation is to them an end of all &s;trife.</HI> E&s;pecially, it is incumbent on the civil magi&s;trate to cultivate the &s;incere&s;t piety in his own brea&s;t. A mini&s;ter of God, who has no reverence for that great Being whom he is ordained to &s;erve, is a perfect prodigy. The perpetual nouri&s;hment of godline&s;s in the heart, is the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of the civil governor&mdash;for the honor of God, for his own &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of the people. A &s;uperlative <HI>re&s;pect</HI> for <HI>Him,</HI> who&s;e ab&s;olutely di&s;intere&s;ted goodne&s;s brought the world into being, and who governs it &s;o that <HI>His tender mercies are over all His works;</HI> a <HI>reverence</HI> for the authority of the chri&s;tian Legi&s;|lator, who&s;e precepts, in favor of charity, ju&s;tice and kindne&s;s, hold a di&s;tingui&s;hed place in the new te&s;tament; an engag|ing <HI>regard</HI> to <HI>His</HI> example, <HI>who went
<PB N="15" REF="013053_0014_0F8FF61DD5376D50">
about doing good,</HI> as He came down from heaven with the mo&s;t beneficent purpo&s;e, and who conde&s;cended to die for the <HI>good</HI> of the world; together with a deeply impre&s;&s;ed <HI>&s;en&s;e of Eternity</HI>&mdash;will have an happy and nece&s;&s;ary influence into that patrioti&s;m, which is the magi&s;|trate's indi&s;pen&s;able qualification. Sin|cere piety fills the &s;oul with the tendere&s;t feelings for mankind, and &s;o engages the heart in pur&s;uit of that, which is the great end of government. Impiety, worldly-mindedne&s;s and &s;en&s;uality render the heart flinty, and in&s;en&s;ible to the groans of the oppre&s;&s;ed; while godline&s;s in&s;pires the &s;ofte&s;t pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;in&s;pires the <HI>brotherly kindne&s;s and charity,</HI> which will never give their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or re&s;t, 'till every rational method is adopted, for the relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and the promotion of publick happine&s;s. Jo&s;eph, fir&s;t mini&s;ter of &s;tate to Pharaoh, having for &s;everal days confined his brethren, found him|&s;elf in&s;ufferably pained in heart, with the thought of longer detaining a &s;upply from the half fami&s;hed hou&s;e of his father, becau&s;e he <HI>feared God.</HI></P>

ALL the wi&s;dom, however, religion and publick &s;pirit, which have generally exi&s;ted, or can be expected &s;oon to take place, among <HI>the great men of the earth,</HI> are by no means a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity to the people, that the end of government will be honorably an&s;wered. Rulers are &s;o prone to have, va&s;tly at heart, certain worldly intere&s;ts, incon&s;i&s;tent with the publick, welfare and the duty they owe to the community, that it is incumbent on the people (who&s;e right it is to do this, on proper con&s;ideration, and every thing el&s;e, re&s;pecting government, which they judge will be for the &s;alvation and advantage of the whole) to fix on certain regulations, which if we plea&s;e we may call a <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> as the &s;tanding mea&s;ure of the proceedings of government; &s;o determining what powers they will inve&s;t their rulers with, and what privileges they will retain in their own hands.</P>
<P>THROUGH the mi&s;guiding arts of de&s;igning men, mi&s;takes and freaki&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, things hurtful to &s;ociety, are apt to take place in popular governments,

which might be prevented by ab&s;olute monarchy; while it ought in ju&s;tice to be acknowledged, that &s;ome ab&s;olute princes have been great benefactors to the publick: But &s;uch con&s;iderations &s;carcely furni&s;h a better argument in favor of yielding up to de&s;poti&s;m, than the religious divi&s;ions in prote&s;tant countries, and the degrees of &s;ervice ever done to the churches by the Popes, afford, in favor of the re-admi&s;&s;ion and e&s;tabli&s;hment of the papacy.</P>
<P>UNLIMITED power has generally been de&s;tructive of human happine&s;s. The people are not under &s;uch tempta|tions to thwart their own intere&s;ts, as ab&s;olute government is under to abu&s;e the people: and, that the publick intere&s;t has, generally and on the whole, &s;ucceed|ed beyond all compari&s;on better, where the people have, by the barrier of a con|&s;titution, retained power in a great degree in their own hands, than it has under de&s;potick governments, we dare appeal to all the &s;en&s;ible, humane, impartial examiners of univer&s;al hi&s;tory.</P>

<P>A CONSTITUTION being &s;ettled by the public con&s;ent, the magi&s;trate, awed by that Sovereignty which God has been plea&s;ed to inve&s;t the people with in the ca&s;e, ought ever to maintain a &s;acred re&s;pect to &s;uch con&s;titution, in every in&s;tance of government legi&s;lative or executive. The community having a right to fix boundaries between rulers and people by a con&s;titution, it is im|po&s;&s;ible that individuals &s;hould have a right to remove them, however high the rank of &s;uch individuals may be.
