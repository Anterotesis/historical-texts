<HEAD>BRIEF CONSIDERATIONS ON SLAVERY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE religious and moral Obligations we are under in a private capacity, to do our utmo&s;t to promote the true intere&s;ts of mankind, encrea&s;e with our powers and opportunities of action. Hence ari&s;es the importance of that tru&s;t, which the wi&s;dom of government has repo&s;ed in legi&s;latures; in di&s;charging which, having the will, they have al&s;o the power of promoting tho&s;e intere&s;ts in the mo&s;t effec|tual manner. The object therefore, which I now take the liberty of recommending to their attention, has an indi&s;putable claim to it; not only from its impor|tance as relating to the community, but from a con&s;i|deration which mu&s;t give it great additional weight with every generous mind&mdash;the incapacity of tho&s;e on who&s;e behalf it is &s;olicited, to plead their own cau&s;e. It is the ca&s;e of the en&s;laved Africans&mdash;a ca&s;e which tho' familiarized to us by cu&s;tom, is yet in all its parts &s;o replete with affecting circum&s;tances, that perhaps it has not its parallel in the hi&s;tory of any period of time; and attended with the particular aggravation, of being acted under a government, remarkable above all others for the excellence of its con&s;titution, and the equity of its laws. How it has happened that a nation, which has &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf in a&s;&s;erting the common rights of mankind, and which has &s;o often generou&s;ly interpo&s;ed its power for the relief
<PB N="4" REF="012701_0003_0F8C2DE3ACBE73D8">
of its oppre&s;&s;ed neighbours, &s;hould tolerate &s;o griev|ous an infringement of liberty in its own dominions, is difficult to comprehend. But my intention is not to expatiate on the incon&s;i&s;tency of the&s;e generous ex|ertions of its power, with the toleration of the African &s;lave-trade. I hope it may be attributed to the multi|plicity and weight of other engagements, which have &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed the attention of government, that the iniquitous nature of this traffick has not been adverted to; for certainly an acquaintance with it, could only be nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion. But without a further inve&s;tigation of the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> it is more to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, to confine my&s;elf to &s;uch con&s;iderations, as being duly attended to, may a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>cure</HI> of this malignant di&s;order in the body politick. With this view, I &s;hall briefly con&s;ider its incon&s;i&s;tency with the divine, as well as the &s;ocial law; its impolicy and evil tendency; and then endeavour to point out the mo&s;t probable means by which the evil may be remedied.</P>
<P>IT cannot be denied that Slavery was allowed to the I&s;raelites by the Mo&s;aic law, under certain circum|&s;tances and re&s;trictions; yet it differed from this of the Africans in &s;everal important particulars. Their bondmen and bondwomen enjoyed many privileges; and in the year of Jubilee, liberty was proclaimed unto all the inhabitants of the land. On the con|trary, a large part of our poor African &s;laves, have no ground to expect the mo&s;t di&s;tant admi&s;&s;ion to liberty, for either them&s;elves, or their late&s;t po&s;terity. But even though we may conceive Slavery to be recon|cileable to the precepts given under that di&s;pen&s;ation; yet to every unprejudiced mind, it mu&s;t appear totally repugnant to the &s;pirit and de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, the import of which was announced to the world, in a manner awfully expre&s;&s;ive of its &s;uperior excellence,
<PB N="5" REF="012701_0004_0F8C2DE4628FE298">
proclaiming <Q>Glory to GOD in the highe&s;t; peace on earth; and good will to men.</Q> The&s;e glorious purpo&s;es, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, when per&s;onally among men, inculcated by his example and doctrines; and, to give the&s;e greater efficacy, finally &s;ealed them with his blood. Various were the precepts he delivered, but tho&s;e relating to our &s;ocial duties, are all com|prized in that excellent command, <Q>Therefore what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is the law and the prophets.</Q> Mat. 7.12. St. Paul's opinion of tho&s;e concerned in the practice now under con&s;ideration, appears by his enumerating them among a number of atrocious offenders for whom the law was made, viz. <Q>Mur|derers of fathers; murderers of mothers; man|&s;layers; whoremongers; them that defile them|&s;elves with mankind; men&s;tealers,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THAT it is al&s;o an offence again&s;t the &s;ocial law, cannot be contradicted; for this law is founded on the nece&s;&s;ity of mutual &s;ecurity, and a reciprocation of benefits; and by the light of our natural rea&s;on, we cannot find a rule better adapted to promote the&s;e ends, than that I have quoted from the vii. of Mat|thew; to which both Chri&s;tians and Pagans have joined in giving the di&s;tingui&s;hing appellation of <HI>the golden rule.</HI> The celebrated Monte&s;quieu and many others who have made the rights of mankind their particular &s;tudy, a&s;&s;ert that men univer&s;ally have an inherent title to Liberty; and the author I have named, with no le&s;s &s;trength than vivacity of rea&s;oning, has refuted tho&s;e ridiculous arguments, which intere&s;ted men have been obliged to adduce, in &s;upport of a pretended opinion, that the colour or unpoli&s;hed manners of the Africans, can operate again&s;t their claim to this fir&s;t of temporal enjoyments.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="012701_0005_0F8C2DE6E00A7FD8">IN the&s;e northern provinces there are not very many, who are immediately concerned in the trade to Africa for Slaves; nor is the number of the&s;e op|pre&s;&s;ed people very con&s;iderable, when compared with that of many other colonies. Hence &s;ome, though admitting the inju&s;tice of the &s;lave trade in general, may yet be unwilling to view it as a matter &s;ufficiently important for the extraordinary interpo&s;ition of a legi&s;|lature; being perhaps in&s;en&s;ibly bia&s;ed by intere&s;t, the prevalence of cu&s;tom, or the example of le&s;s enlightened times; thus le&s;&s;ening the force of tho&s;e objections which calm reflection had &s;ugge&s;ted. I would &s;ubmit to the con&s;ideration of &s;uch, the com|plicated di&s;tre&s;s the&s;e poor creatures &s;uffer, in being forceably torn from that portion of happine&s;s, which the allwi&s;e Creator allotted to them in their native &s;tate; to &s;u&s;tain for life, a bondage which, in our &s;outhern colonies and i&s;lands, is more cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive than the mo&s;t of us in the northern colonies have had an opportunity of forming any idea of. Add to this, the bloody wars occa&s;ioned by this infernal trade&mdash;the great proportion of them who die on the pa&s;&s;age to, and in what is called the <HI>&s;ea&s;oning</HI> in America; and can we then he&s;itate a moment, in determining on the expediency of contributing whatever lies in our power to di&s;courage it. It is true &s;ome of our forefathers, and &s;ome of the pre&s;ent generation, may have been, and yet are in the practice of buying and &s;elling &s;laves. The rea&s;ons again&s;t it, but a few years ago, were not &s;o well under&s;tood as they now are. The opportuni|ties of information are become more frequent; and the u&s;age of them in general among us, has been le&s;s likely to excite an inquiry into the nature of the trade, and our title to their &s;ervices. The practice of ages cannot &s;anctify error; but the progre&s;s of reformation has, in all, been gradual. I doubt not there are now
<PB N="7" REF="012701_0006_0F8C2DE792972F90">
many men in England, who&s;e integrity we &s;hould re|vere, but who, for want of proper information or at|tention to the &s;ubject, do yet admit the right of the Briti&s;h parliament to tax the colonies; but we are not, for that rea&s;on obliged to admit it. Having thus briefly con&s;idered the &s;lave-trade as contradictory to the divine and &s;ocial law, it is needle&s;s to urge the impropriety of any, and e&s;pecially a free people being in anywi&s;e concerned in it. I &s;hall therefore proceed to con&s;ider the particular inconveniences attending it, with re&s;pect to the community.</P>
<P>THAT the trade is attended with many inconveni|ences of an evil and impolitic tendency, has been lately clearly &s;et forth by &s;everal writers. It will be &s;ufficient for me to enumerate a few of them. Every thing that deba&s;es the mind, unfits it for &s;ociety; and this is a di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tick of Slavery, which natu|rally &s;uppre&s;&s;es every generous expan&s;ion of the mind. Monte&s;quieu, in his &s;pirit of laws &s;aith, <Q>That nothing more a&s;&s;imilates a man to a bea&s;t, than living among freemen, him&s;elf a &s;lave: &s;uch people as the&s;e are the natural enemies of &s;ociety; and their number mu&s;t always be dangerous.</Q> Therefore the having &s;laves in our families or neighbourhood, mu&s;t have a pernicious effect on the principles and morals of our young people and &s;ervants. May we not fear that reli|gion and morality, indu&s;try and publick &s;pirit, have nearly declined in proportion as it has been encourag|ed?&mdash;The riches of a free &s;tate con&s;i&s;ts in the num|ber of members, who enjoying its privileges and ble&s;|&s;ings, are thereby intere&s;ted in its pre&s;ervation and ad|vancement. Every &s;lave among us occupies the room of a free per&s;on, and not only le&s;&s;ens the riches of the &s;tate by dimini&s;hing the number of its friends, but adds one to that of its internal enemies; for &s;uch every one
<PB N="8" REF="012701_0007_0F8C2DE883824CD8">
mu&s;t be accounted, who can derive no hope from its pro&s;perity, and may po&s;&s;ibly be benefited by its ruin.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Admitting this, what danger mu&s;t attend our &s;outhern colonies, in &s;ome of which, the proportion of &s;laves to freemen is greater than as twelve to one?</NOTE> While on the other hand, every &s;ervant on the expira|tion of a limited &s;ervitude, &s;etting out with the anima|ting hope of acquiring an independence in the commu|nity, and of enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of life, and the protection of the laws, heartily unites in promoting the pro&s;perity of his country; and, as that hope is an|&s;wered with &s;ucce&s;s, becomes more and more deeply in|tere&s;ted in its &s;afety: the beneficial effects of this on our lands and produce, are very exten&s;ive, and too obvious to need a recital.&mdash;In the pre&s;ent conte&s;t between Great|Britain and her colonies, it &s;eems particularly nece&s;&s;ary on our parts to convince her, that our oppo&s;ition to her claims is not merely from &s;elfi&s;h motives&mdash;not only made becau&s;e they happen to affect <HI>our</HI> particular inte|re&s;ts; but from a di&s;intere&s;ted generous love to liberty, founded on principle&mdash;on publick virtue, and a con|viction that it is the unalienable right of man. But how can &s;he believe this, when, &s;o loudly complaining of her attacks on our political liberty, all the colonies tolerate, and many of them greatly encourage this vio|lent inva&s;ion of natural liberty; &s;ubjecting the Africans not only to the deprivation of all property, but even to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of perpetual per&s;onal &s;lavery? If we &s;uppo&s;e the divine ble&s;&s;ing is nece&s;&s;ary to en&s;ure us &s;ucce&s;s in a&s;&s;erting our rights; of how much con&s;e|quence is it, that we &s;hould practi&s;e the part enjoined by the divine command, <Q>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them?</Q> If pow|er only mu&s;t determine our right, how little have we to expect? On the other hand, were we armed with con&s;cious innocence, and &s;upported by the ju&s;tice of
<PB N="9" REF="012701_0008_0F8C2DE8F8EE14D8">
our cau&s;e; what have we to fear? With what confidence might we urge our claims? But as a late writer on this &s;ubject ob&s;erves, <Q>If we need the help of the negroes; &s;o does Great-Britain need our help to pay off their national debt. If we de&s;ire to grow rich, and re&s;t at ea&s;e by their toils and labours; &s;o does Great-Britain de&s;ire the &s;ame at our expence. So that while we per&s;i&s;t in this practice of en&s;laving the Africans, our mouths ought to be entirely &s;hut, as to any duties and taxes which Great-Britain may &s;ee cau&s;e to lay upon us. Otherwi&s;e I &s;ee not, but that out of our own mouths, or by our own practice, we may be ju&s;tly condemned.</Q></P>
<P>HAVING given my &s;entiments on a trade and prac|tice, which, to u&s;e the words of the author of <HI>An e&s;&s;ay in vindication of the continental colonies of America,</HI> <Q>Po|licy rejects; ju&s;tice condemns; and piety di&s;&s;uades;</Q> I &s;hall, from the &s;ame re&s;pectable author, add, <Q>Shall Americans per&s;i&s;t in a conduct which cannot be ju&s;tified; or per&s;evere in oppre&s;&s;ion, from which their hearts mu&s;t recoil? If the barbarous Africans &s;hall continue to en&s;lave each other; let the daemon &s;la|very remain among them, that their crime may in|clude its puni&s;hment. Let not Chri&s;tians, by admi|ni&s;tering to their wickedne&s;s, confe&s;s their religion to be a u&s;ele&s;s refinement, their profe&s;&s;ion vain, and them&s;elves as inhuman as the &s;avages they dete&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>I CANNOT believe there are any in the chri&s;tian faith, who have attentively, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately con&s;idered the &s;ubject, but will adopt the opinion, that Slavery, in any ca&s;e, cannot be ju&s;tified&mdash;that, as it is conducted in the African trade, it is a mo&s;t cruel, tyrannical and violent inva&s;ion of the &s;acred rights of mankind; and highly offen&s;ive to Almighty God&mdash;that it is impolitick in its
<PB N="10" REF="012701_0009_0F8C2DEE3B053508">
nature&mdash;that the practice of buying and &s;elling &s;laves among our&s;elves is an evident encouragement of the trade; and that the encouragement of it, by any means, is incon&s;i&s;tent with our civil and religious intere&s;ts. If we thus believe, it is certainly our indi&s;pen&s;able duty in every &s;tation, publick or private, to exert our&s;elves for its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, whatever difficulties may be appre|hended to attend its final accompli&s;hment. The preju|dices of cu&s;tom are &s;trong&mdash;tho&s;e imbibed from intere&s;t, yet &s;tronger. But in &s;uch a cau&s;e, we may be a&s;&s;ured the ble&s;&s;ing of Omnipotence will attend our endea|vors, and in due time crown them with &s;ucce&s;s; not within our own limits only; but our example will mo&s;t probably have a happy influence on the conduct of others more remote. It lies in our power, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to atone for the wrongs our ance&s;tors or our|&s;elves have inadvertently impo&s;ed on the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed people in time pa&s;t.</P>
<P>IS not then the fir&s;t and mo&s;t important &s;tep, ab|&s;olutely to prohibit any future importations into the&s;e colonies. If by royal in&s;tructions, our governors are prevented the exerci&s;e of their own judgments; pro|vincial addre&s;&s;es to the crown, would be likely to re|move the difficulty. The &s;en&s;e of the people, conveyed by their repre&s;entatives to the royal ear, on &s;o intere&s;t|ing a &s;ubject, mu&s;t prevail, with a prince who&s;e virtues have endeared him to his people, although it &s;hould be oppo&s;ed by men, comparatively few in number; who&s;e avarice may continue to render them in&s;en&s;ible to the common feelings of humanity, and who&s;e GOD is gain. If we cannot obtain a <HI>total</HI> prohibition of the importation, we &s;hall certainly be indulged in obtaining it for the colonies which petition for it. Even &s;hould we fail here, the con&s;cious &s;atisfaction of having done our duty, will be a reward &s;ufficient for the labour.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="012701_0010_0F8C2DF0CE200B08">WITH re&s;pect to the &s;laves already among us, the ca&s;e is more difficult, and will con&s;equently occa&s;ion a diver&s;ity of &s;entiments on the proper means of effecting their enlargement. The fir&s;t que&s;tion is, What does ju&s;tice require? This being determined, the hone&s;t mind will endeavour to practi&s;e it. There are many of this character, who, in pur&s;uing the inquiry, have inclined to an opinion, that &s;ome of the&s;e unhappy peo|ple are unfit for liberty; and that their manumi&s;&s;ion would be attended with ruin to them&s;elves. Such a &s;tate of depravity is not impo&s;&s;ible, and nothing &s;o likely to occa&s;ion it, as a long continuance in the &s;ituation they have been in. I wi&s;h there may not be many in&s;tances of this kind. Where it happens to be the ca&s;e, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, after carefully dive&s;ting him|&s;elf of any &s;ini&s;ter bias, can ju&s;tify a detention on this motive, I &s;hall not controvert his right to exerci&s;e his judgment. There are al&s;o many, who not being yet &s;ufficiently acquainted with the &s;ubject, to &s;ee the iniqui|ty of the practice, do not apprehend the nece&s;&s;ity of relea&s;ing their &s;laves. As the&s;e would be inclined to oppo&s;e, and tho&s;e I have before mentioned, for other rea&s;ons, may be rather aver&s;e to a general and indi&s;|criminate manumi&s;&s;ion; we may perhaps infer the ex|pediency of po&s;tponing that de&s;irable work to a period more favourable to our wi&s;hes. In reformations of all kinds, where conviction precedes conver&s;ion, the effect is mo&s;t permanent. But no objections occur to me, to the framing &s;uch laws, as will leave people at liberty to emancipate their &s;laves under certain re&s;trictions.</P>
<P>AS the laws &s;tand at pre&s;ent in &s;everal of our north|ern governments, the act of manumi&s;&s;ion is clogged with difficulties that almo&s;t amount to a prohibition. An amendment is therefore nece&s;&s;ary; and may be effected with advantage to the community. We may &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="012701_0011_0F8C2DF186A33418">
all the laws alluded to, are intended to &s;ecure the pub|lick from being chargeable with any expence, in ca&s;e the manumi&s;ed &s;lave &s;hould by age, &s;ickne&s;s, or other di&s;ability, become incapable of &s;upporting him&s;elf: and a provi&s;ion of this nature &s;eems highly rea&s;onable in certain ca&s;es. If, for in&s;tance, a &s;lave is become aged and infirm in my &s;ervice, it is unrea&s;onable I &s;hould have it in my power, by manumi&s;&s;ion to deny him a &s;upport from my e&s;tate, to which perhaps his labour had contributed. But if, on the other hand, I have re|ceived no other benefit from his labour, than what was a proper compen&s;ation for the in&s;truction I have given him, and the publick afterwards receives that benefit, it is then as rea&s;onable, that the publick &s;hould be chargeable with any expence, occa&s;ioned by &s;uch di&s;|ability. This &s;eems to be the general principle on which our laws relating to <HI>paupers</HI> are formed; and I &s;ee no inconvenience in adopting it in the ca&s;e now under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>ADMITTING then, that if a &s;lave is &s;et at liberty at the age of twenty-one years, the publick afterwards receives all the benefit of his labour, it will follow that I may &s;et him free at that age, clear of any charge or incumbrance on my e&s;tate. If I detain him longer, and then give him his liberty, the &s;ame rea&s;oning &s;up|po&s;es, that if the publick is afterwards liable to &s;upport him, in ca&s;e of di&s;ability, I mu&s;t pay the publick a certain &s;um of money proportionable to the time of &s;uch detention exceeding twenty-one years. No gene|ral rule can be exactly adapted to all ca&s;es. But I believe a law formed on the&s;e principles, would not only greatly tend to the relief of individuals, but re|move &s;ome objections, to which I apprehend the pre|&s;ent laws of &s;everal provinces are liable; particularly tho&s;e which permit manumi&s;&s;ion on the ma&s;ter's enter|ing
<PB N="13" REF="012701_0012_0F8C2DF1F0E159F8">
&s;ecurity for the payment of a certain &s;um, in ca&s;e the &s;lave &s;hould be di&s;abled from maintaining him&s;elf. Now as this depends on a di&s;tant contingency, an al|teration in the circum&s;tances of the ma&s;ter and his &s;ureties, (if any are required) may effectually di&s;able him or them from making good their engagements. Whereas in the mode I propo&s;e, the money due on every manumi&s;&s;ion which requires it, being paid to a proper officer, remains &s;ecure with the publick. And if the &s;lave on who&s;e account it was paid, &s;hould never want any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the fund allotted for the purpo&s;e will be &s;o much the richer; which is a con&s;iderable advantage in its favour.</P>
<P>SOME may think it nece&s;&s;ary that no manumi&s;&s;ion &s;hould legally operate in all circum&s;tances, beyond a cer|tain age. The difficulty which would generally occur in determining the age of a negro, might be removed by enabling a magi&s;trate to convene three or five men, who, or a majority of them, after hearing &s;uch evi|dence as could be adduced, and judging from ap|pearances, &s;hould declare their judgment of his or her age. The&s;e, with many other particular con&s;iderations, will doubtle&s;s be properly attended to, whenever a matter of this con&s;equence, comes under the immedi|ate notice of a legi&s;lature. Some difficulty may at|tend a&s;certaining with preci&s;ion the &s;ums which will be nece&s;&s;ary to pay, at the re&s;pective ages of manumi&s;&s;ion, to &s;ecure the publick from any unju&s;t burden. It is a matter that requires judgment, and a particular kind of calculation with which I am but little acquainted. But as it may further explain what I have &s;ugge&s;ted; I will venture a few more hints on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand that on emancipating a &s;lave in Penn|&s;ylvania, the law requires &s;ecurity &s;hould be entered
<PB N="14" REF="012701_0013_0F8C2DF2AECC6860">
for 30l. without any regard to age, or any other circum|&s;tances; and that if the per&s;on &s;o emancipated, &s;hould afterwards require a&s;&s;i&s;tance, any expence exceeding that &s;um, is paid by the town&s;hip to which he or &s;he may belong. Although this mode is liable to &s;ome exceptions, for rea&s;ons before given, I have never heard of any burden, ari&s;ing therefrom, occa&s;ioning any unea&s;ine&s;s among the people of that province. Hence we may infer that the &s;um of 30l. has been ge|nerally found &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e. By the Bre&s;lau bills of mortality, it is found that the chances are equal, that a man of fifty years of age will live &s;even|teen years. Let us con&s;ider what inconveniences might ari&s;e, if 20l. was paid on the manumi&s;&s;ion of a &s;lave of that age, who afterwards lived &s;eventeen years, in the fir&s;t ten of which, we will &s;uppo&s;e he could &s;upport him&s;elf by his labour; and that in the remaining &s;even he required a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the expence whereof amounted to 30l. which, as before-mention|ed, experience has found to be &s;ufficient. Now 20l. put to intere&s;t (or applied to the other u&s;es of the fund, which is the &s;ame thing) for ten years, at &s;ix per centum per annum, amounts to 32l. which leaves a balance in favour of the publick of 2l. be&s;ides the intere&s;t &s;till ari&s;ing on the decrea&s;ing principle, after the fir&s;t ten years, and the benefit of his labour; which would further increa&s;e that balance. If this calcula|tion is ju&s;t, (and if it is erroneous, I think the error is in favour of the publick) it will be a publick advantage to permit manumi&s;&s;ion on the&s;e terms; and if it takes place at forty, a much le&s;s &s;um will an&s;wer the pur|po&s;e; and &s;o in a decrea&s;ing proportion to the age of twenty-one years, when, as has been before &s;hewn, nothing can be ju&s;tly expected. Now we find that if, on the manumi&s;&s;ion of a &s;lave between the years of twenty-one and fifty, fourteen &s;hillings is paid to the
<PB N="15" REF="012701_0014_0F8C2DF3622EFDE8">
publick for every year his or her age exceeds twenty|one, it will bear a very near proportion to 20l. paid on a manumi&s;&s;ion at fifty, as above &s;tated. I may be mi&s;taken in the method I have taken to determine the &s;ufficiency of that &s;um; but I am &s;o confident that the community would feel no inconvenience from adopt|ing it, that, had I a &s;ufficient e&s;tate to authorize the propo&s;al, I &s;hould not fear deriving a con&s;iderable advantage from undertaking to &s;upport all the negroes &s;o manumitted, who required a&s;&s;i&s;tance, with the mo|nies &s;o paid; exclu&s;ive of the benefit accruing to the community from their labour, in which I &s;hould be only intere&s;ted as an individual.</P>
<P>THUS I have &s;tated, and propo&s;ed a method for &s;et|tling the account, as it &s;tands, on a manumi&s;&s;ion, with the publick. There are many who, cheerfully com|plying with the&s;e terms, would al&s;o remember that in &s;ome ca&s;es, there is another account depending between them and their &s;laves: and any encouragement or a&s;&s;i&s;tance they may &s;uppo&s;e it their duty to give them in con&s;ideration of pa&s;t &s;ervices, will &s;till le&s;&s;en the ri&s;que of their ever becoming chargeable to the publick.</P>
<P>TO conclude&mdash;the object I have propo&s;ed, has an undoubted claim to the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration of people of all ranks, and of every denomination; for ju&s;tice is confe&s;&s;edly alike obligatory on all. If to relieve the per&s;on of a &s;ingle debtor from a temporary impri&s;onment, has repeatedly been admitted as a &s;uf|ficient call for the interpo&s;ition of a legi&s;lature&mdash;what is not due to the pro&s;ecution of the means of preventing the mi&s;eries in&s;eparably attendant on, and the cruelties and deplorable &s;ufferings too often annexed to, a &s;tate of perpetual &s;lavery; in which many thou&s;ands of our fellow-creatures are, and may be unju&s;tly detained?

Let us reconcile our practice to our avowed principles. Let not our profe&s;&s;ions of an inviolable attachment to liberty, of late &s;o frequently echoed from one end of the continent to the other, be contradicted by a practice as unju&s;t as it is impolitick. Doctor Young is very &s;evere where he &s;ays
"The world's all title page, there's no contents."
Let our conduct &s;hew our title to an exception. Let us therefore immediately con&s;ider, and adopt the mo&s;t prudent mea&s;ures for relieving tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed people; and of enemies make them friends and u&s;eful members of &s;ociety, by confering on them &s;uch privileges as will intere&s;t them in the general welfare.</P>
<P>BEING &s;en&s;ible of my deficiency, I &s;hould have been plea&s;ed, had the few hints I have pre&s;umed to obtrude on the publick, employed a pen more equal to the importance of my &s;ubject. Con&s;cious, however, of my motive in giving them, I flatter my&s;elf they will meet from the candid, the reception which is due to a good intention. As a wellwi&s;her to the religious and civil intere&s;ts of my country, I am willing to contribute my mite towards the removal of an evil, which I believe to be dangerous to both: and if any thoughts I have meant to expre&s;s, have the lea&s;t ten|dency to effect it; I &s;hall be indifferent whatever opinion is formed of the dre&s;s they appear in.</P>
