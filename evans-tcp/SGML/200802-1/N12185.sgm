<P>WHEN David, the in&s;pired Penman of this P&s;alm, was greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, unju&s;t|ly blam'd on account of the <HI>Amalekites</HI> invading, &s;poiling, and burning <HI>Ziklag</HI>; and carrying away captive the women that were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in, and when the people talked of &s;toning him on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> account, we read, that under the&s;e afflicting circum&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+ces, he <HI>encouraged him&s;elf in the Lord his God.</HI> 1 Sam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 6.

<P>By the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;e of God we are to under&s;tand the whole &s;y&s;tem of divine truth. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, when he was arraigned before Pilate, declar'd, <HI>for this end was I born, and for this end came I into the world, that I might bear witne&s;s to the truth.</HI> This al&s;o was the grand de|&s;ign of all the di&s;pen&s;ations of God to men. The old and new Te&s;tament were both of them written, and have been hitherto pre&s;erv'd, that they might exhibit to men a &s;cheme of truth. God has di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">play'd to our view the volume of nature, that we may therein read his &s;ublime glories and perfections, <HI>for the heavens de|clare his glory, and the firmament &s;heweth forth his handy work, and from the things that are made, are clearly &s;een his eternal power and Godhead.</HI> The invi&s;ible things of him are di&s;covered, by a &s;urvey of the creation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="015378_0004_0F98D27D86C863A0">All the doctrines contained in the old and new Te&s;|tament, from that &s;y&s;tem of truth, of which we are &s;peaking, among&s;t the&s;e doctrines, tho&s;e mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to man, are his fall in Adam, and redemption by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the nece&s;&s;ity of being regenerated and &s;anctified by the &s;pirit of God, and being ju&s;tified by the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his &s;on imputed to them, and received by faith, the nece&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s in order to happine&s;s, and of conformity in heart and life to the nature and will of God: The&s;e, and all the other doc|trines of his word, are the cau&s;e of God. For this cau&s;e he &s;ent prophets and apo&s;tles to preach and teach mankind, by their di&s;cour&s;es and writings: For this cau&s;e he &s;ent his &s;on and &s;pirit in the world. The&s;e doctrines have been maintained by the &s;aints in all ages, at the peril of their lives and all they held dear: This cau&s;e, Chri&s;t, his apo&s;tles, martyrs, and confe&s;&s;ors, have held &s;o dear, that they have &s;eal'd them with their blood. This is a cau&s;e that God loves and upholds, he has &s;tyl'd him&s;elf <HI>the God of truth, Deut.</HI> 32 4. David de|clares, that <HI>the Lord keepeth truth for ever, P&s;.</HI> 146.6.

This righteou&s;ne&s;s in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ludes what&s;o|ever things are true, what&s;oever things are pure; what|&s;oever things are hone&s;t, lovely, and of good rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. It includes a temper and conduct, entirely conformable to the truth revealed in the holy &s;criptures. This righ|teou&s;ne&s;s includes our duty to God, our fellow creature, and our&s;elves; it implies that we love God &s;upremely,

that we wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth, with rever|ence and godly fear, that we &s;ubmit with patience and re&s;ignation to all the &s;trokes of his rod, that we tru&s;t in his providence, rely on his mercy, goodne&s;s, truth, and other glorious perfections, that we fear to offend him, and &s;trive to plea&s;e him, always endeavoring to obey his will and commandments; it implies benevo|lence, ju&s;tice, charity, integrity, truth, and kindne&s;s in our conduct to our fellow creatures, that we love our neighbor as our&s;elves, and do to others as we would they &s;hould do unto us, that we forgive our enemies, and do good to all as we have opportunity. That we be meek, &s;ober, humble, heavenly minded, patient un|der injuries, contented with our condition, temperate, as to the u&s;e of earthly enjoyments, zealous for God's glory, and advancement of truth and religion in the world&mdash;The above particulars con&s;titute that righteou&s;|ne&s;s which is God's cau&s;e, a great part of which is the image of his own nature and perfections: This is what he delighteth in, for he loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hateth iniquity; he gave his laws to mankind that they might be holy, as he is holy; he gave his word and &s;pirit to &s;anctify the &s;ouls of men; he gave his only begotten and dearly beloved &s;on, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify us unto him&s;elf, a peculiar peo|ple, zealous of good works. All the di&s;pen&s;ations of divine providence, prove God's love of holine&s;s. All the favors of his goodne&s;s to the righteous, and the awful judgments executed on the ungodly, prove how much righteou&s;ne&s;s is the cau&s;e of God.

is the cau&s;e of God. They are a &s;ociety of holy and regenerate &s;ouls, tru&s;ting in the mercy of God through Chri&s;t, conforming the temper of their minds and the tenor of their lives, to the nature, will, and perfections of God; they are repre&s;ented in Scrip|ture, as a kingdom, of which Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the mon|arch, as a body, of which the &s;on of God is the head: They are de&s;cribed by St. Peter, as a cho&s;en generation, a royal Prie&s;thood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, de&s;tined to &s;hew forth the prai&s;es of him who called them from darkne&s;s to his marvellous light: They are in &s;cripture &s;tyl'd Zion, Jeru&s;alem, the kingdom of God, and the Church of Chri&s;t&punc; This &s;ociety are called elect, as being cho&s;en out of the world, &s;aints as being &s;anctified and made holy by the &s;pirit, and beloved of God, as being the favorites of the mo&s;t high. He loves them with a di&s;tingui&s;hing love; as a father pitieth his children, &s;o the Lord pitieth tho&s;e his &s;er|vants that fear him. God loves his people, infinitely more than all the re&s;t of the world: He loves the gates of Zion, more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

God's portion is his people, and I&s;rael the lot of his inheritance&mdash;he led

him about, he in&s;tructed him, he kept him as the ap|ple of his eye, as an Eagle &s;tirreth up her ne&s;t, flutter|eth over her young, &s;preadeth abroad her wings, tak|eth them, beareth them on her wings, &s;o the Lord alone did lead them. God &s;o loved the church, that he redeemed it by his own blood, he &s;pared not his own Son, but gave him for his cho&s;en people; Chri&s;t loved the church, and gave him&s;elf for it, gave him&s;elf to a life of &s;orrows, to inexpre&s;&s;ible agonies, and to the accur&s;ed death of the cro&s;s. Immanuel regards the injuries and favors done the church, as if done to him&s;elf: When Saul per&s;ecuted the church, he &s;aid unto him, <HI>Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecutest thou me,</HI> and at the la&s;t day he will &s;ay to tho&s;e who have fed the hungry &s;aint, given drink to the thir&s;ty believer, cloathed his naked di&s;ciples, vi&s;ited the &s;ick and impri&s;oned mem|bers of his invi&s;ible body, ina&s;much as ye have done it to the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye have done it un|to me. When the true believer is injured, oppre&s;&s;ed, per&s;ecuted, plundered, impri&s;oned, tormented, and murdered, he looks upon their cau&s;e as his own, <HI>preci|ous in his &s;ight is the death of his &s;aints</HI>: he is the father of their fatherle&s;s children, the God and protector of their widows, the friend of their friends, and the ene|my of their enemies. The enraptured P&s;almi&s;t thus celebrates the kindne&s;s of God to his people: <HI>The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and rai&s;eth up all that be bowed down, the Lord is righteous in all his ways, and ho|ly in all his works; the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth, P&s;.</HI> 140 146. <HI>He will fulfil the de&s;ire of them that fear him, he will al&s;o hear their cry and will &s;ave them. The Lord pre&s;erveth all them that love him, but all the wicked will he de&s;troy: Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, who&s;e hope is in the Lord his God, which made heaven and earth, the &s;ea and all that in them is; who keepeth truth for ever: who executeth judgment for the oppre&s;&s;ed, who giveth food
<PB N="9" REF="015378_0008_0F98D28085029BA8">
to the hungry: The Lord loo&s;eth the pri&s;oners: the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind: the Lord loveth the righte|ous: the Lord pre&s;erveth the &s;trangers, he relieveth the fa|therle&s;s and the widow, but the way of the wicked he turn|eth up&s;ide down: the Lord doth build up Jeru&s;alem, he gathereth together the outcasts of I&s;rael: he delighteth not in the &s;trength of the hor&s;e; he taketh not plea&s;ure in the legs of a man: the Lord taketh plea&s;ure in them that fear him, in tho&s;e that hope in his mercy.</HI> Thus you &s;ee my brethren, that the cau&s;e of truth, the cau&s;e of religion, the cau&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s, the cau&s;e of his church and people, is the cau&s;e of God: It is, as the P&s;almi&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;es it, <HI>his own cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Thus my brethren, I have &s;hewn you what is meant by the cau&s;e of God.</P>
<P>I now proceed to explain what we are to under&s;tand by God's pleading this cau&s;e, which was the &s;e|cond point propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Hebrew word here tran&s;lated plead, may be rendered litigate, &s;trove, contend, &s;ight, but being here connected with cau&s;e, it is be&s;t tran&s;lated, by the Engli&s;h word plead, a term very familiar to mo&s;t of us, which &s;ignifies an advocate, lawyer, or patron's ar|guing, &s;upplicating, interceeding, contending for his client, and repre&s;enting his ca&s;e to the be&s;t advantage, e&s;pou&s;ing or patronizing it, or taking it in his own hands and managing it. The phra&s;e of God's plead|ing his people's cau&s;e, frequently occurs in &s;cripture. Thus David, P&s;alm 35.1, invokes the divine help &s;ay|ing, <HI>plead my cau&s;e O Lord with them that strive with me, fight again&s;t them that fight again&s;t me:</HI> and when Saul unju&s;tly per&s;ecuted him and &s;ought his life, he thus acco&s;ts the cruel tyrant, 1 Sam. 24 15. <HI>the Lord therefore be Judge, and judge between me and thee, and &s;ee and plead my cau&s;e, and deliver me out of thine hand:</HI> and in the 143d P&s;alm he &s;aith, <HI>Judge me O God and plead
<PB N="10" REF="015378_0009_0F98D281452058F0">
my cau&s;e against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unju&s;t man.</HI> Solomon exhorts, Proverbs 22 23. <HI>Rob not the poor becau&s;e he is poor; neither op|pre&s;s the afflicted in the gate; for the Lord will plead their cau&s;e, and &s;poil the &s;oul of tho&s;e that &s;poiled them:</HI> And again he &s;ays in the next chapter: <HI>Remove not the old land marks, and enter not into the field of the fatherle&s;s, for their Redeemer is mighty; he &s;hall plead their cau&s;e with thee:</HI> See al&s;o Jeremiah 50, 33 34. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the children of I&s;rael and the children of Judah were oppre&s;&s;ed together, and all that took them cap|tives, held them fa&s;t, they refu&s;ed to let them go. Their Redeemer is &s;trong, the Lord of Ho&s;ts is his name, he &s;hall &s;trongly plead their cau&s;e, that he may give re&s;t to the land and di&s;quiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</HI> There is a re|markable pa&s;&s;age in the en&s;uing chapter, in which God &s;peaks of the injuries done to his people, as if done to him&s;elf; he makes their cau&s;e his own, and declares that he will plead it. See Jeremiah 51, 33 &amp;c. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Baby|lon hath devoured me, he hath cru&s;hed me, he hath made me an empty ve&s;&s;el, he hath &s;wallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with his delicates, he hath ca&s;t me out. The violence done to me and to my fle&s;h, be upon Ba|bylon, &s;hall the inhabitant of Zion &s;ay; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, &s;hall Jeru&s;alem &s;ay, therefore thus &s;aith the Lord, behold I will plead thy cau&s;e, and take vengeance for thee:</HI> and this was by puni&s;hing Nebu|chadnezzar in a mo&s;t &s;ignal manner, and by de&s;troying the inhabitants of Babylon. See the declaration of God's injured Church, Micah 7.8, &amp;c. <HI>Rejoice not again&s;t me, O mine enemy: when I fall I &s;hall ari&s;e: when I &s;it in darkne&s;s, the Lord &s;hall be a light unto me. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becau&s;e I have &s;inned again&s;t him, untill he plead my cau&s;e, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I &s;hall behold his righteou&s;ne&s;s. Then &s;he that is mine enemy &s;hall
<PB N="11" REF="015378_0010_0F98D28204BD5160">
&s;ee it, and &s;hame &s;hall cover her which &s;aid unto me, where is the Lord thy God? mine eyes &s;hall behold her: now &s;hall &s;he be trodden down as the mire in the &s;treets.</HI> Thus you &s;ee that God will plead his own and his people's cau&s;e, again&s;t their common enemies. But how doth God plead for his people, how doth he plead his own cau&s;e? I an&s;wer, he pleads it by his word, his &s;pirit, and his providence.</P>
<P N="1">1. He pleads his own and his people's cau&s;e by his word, both in a general and particular manner. He forbids all inju&s;tice, oppre&s;&s;ion, tyranny, murder, theft, plunder, adultery, &s;lander, fal&s;e witne&s;s, un|ju&s;tly coveting our neighbour's property: he incul|cates univer&s;al love, benevolence, compa&s;&s;ion, humani|ty, peace, and righteou&s;ne&s;s: he commands all chri&s;ti|ans to love their neighbour as them&s;elves, and to do to others as they would that others &s;hould do unto them: he commands brethren to dwell together in unity, concord, and mutual forbearance; he declares that to &s;ubvert a man in his cau&s;e, is not right; he for|bids the injuring our neighbour's name, life, or pro|perty; he pronounces a woe again&s;t them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievou&s;ne&s;s which they have pre&s;cribed, to turn the needy from judg|ment, and to take away the right of the poor of his people; he commands that he who ruleth over men, mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of the Lord; he com|mands magi&s;trates to be a terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well.</P>
<P>God pled the cau&s;e of liberty with the I&s;raelites, when they fooli&s;hly de&s;ired a king to reign over them: he told them the prejudice it would be to their free|dom and happine&s;s, in order to di&s;courage them from it: he &s;aid, <HI>this will be the manner of the king that &s;hall reign over you; he will take your &s;ons and appoint them for him&s;elf, for his chariots and to be his hor&s;emen, and &s;ome &s;hall run before his chariots, and he will appoint him cap|tains

over hundreds, and over fifties, and will &s;et them to ear his ground, and to reap his harve&s;t; and he will take your fields and your vineyards, and your olive yards, even the be&s;t of them, and he will take your men and maid &s;er|vants, and your goodlie&s;t young men, and your a&s;&s;es, and put them to his work, and ye &s;hall be his &s;ervants.</HI> God commanded the I&s;raelites, &s;aying, <HI>ye &s;hall not oppre&s;s one another.</HI> Leviticus 25, 14 17. When the ten tribes had revolted from Rehoboam, becau&s;e of oppre&s;&s;i|on, and when Rehoboam and Judah went out to fight again&s;t them to bring them back to &s;ubjection, God &s;ent his prophet to Rehoboam and Judah, &s;aying, <HI>ye &s;hall not go up, nor fight again&s;t your brethren</HI> 1 Kings 12 24. God declared to Abraham, <HI>I will ble&s;s them that ble&s;s thee, and cur&s;e them that cur&s;e thee.</HI> See al&s;o 1. Chron. 16 22, compared with P&s;alm 105 15, where Jehovah is repre&s;ented, &s;aying, <HI>touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm</HI>: i. e. God's anointed peo|ple, and not kings, becau&s;e it is &s;aid in the preceeding ver&s;e, <HI>he &s;uffered no man to do them wrong, yea, he reproved kings for their &s;ake.</HI> I need not multiply arguments, to prove that God by his word, pleads his own and his people's cau&s;e, what has been &s;aid is &s;ufficient&mdash;I &s;hall now point out &s;ome particular in&s;tances, in which God has by his word, pled his people's cau&s;e.
