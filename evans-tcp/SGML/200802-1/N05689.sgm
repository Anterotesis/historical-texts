<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE per&s;on, who&s;e daily conver&s;ation is here de&s;crib'd, was not long &s;ince a poor &s;imple country maid, and &s;ervant to a great family in <HI>France.</HI> The whole cour&s;e of her life was very in&s;tructive, and a mo&s;t &s;hining pattern of a true &s;piritual conver|&s;ation. The particulars here related are taken out of the 18th chapter of the &s;econd part of her <HI>Life,</HI> giving great encouragement to a daily and uninterrupted conver&s;ation with GOD, and to walk before him as the omnipre&s;ent LORD and Father.</P>
<P>If we knew nothing el&s;e of Chri&s;tianity, or any other exerci&s;e, but this, to &s;pend one day after another in this manner, it would be &s;uffi|cient. 'Tis very remarkable, that this per&s;on, who &s;erved GOD wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h unwearied prayer and watchfulne&s;s, was &s;o ignorant, that &s;he could neither read nor write, and withal a &s;ervant, con&s;tantly employed in bu&s;ine&s;s and hard la|bour. By this we &s;ee that the true &s;ervice of GOD is &s;piritual, univer&s;al, plain and ea&s;y, &s;o
<PB N="iii" REF="007218_0002_102B3F26950FE820">
that no per&s;on can be excu&s;ed from it by any pretence what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Some, who di&s;covered her &s;piritual di&s;po&s;i|tion, would needs have her go into a nunnery, where &s;he might be more at lei&s;ure to &s;erve GOD; which &s;he did accordingly. But per|ceiving her former zeal and love to GOD be|gin to abate, &s;he went to &s;ervice again; where|upon &s;he enjoyed the &s;ame favour of GOD, as &s;he had done before.</P>
<P>By this circum&s;tance the LORD taught her and her friends effectually, that piety and reli|gion was not confined to nunneries; and that the outward cloi&s;tering up of the body, without withdrawing the heart from the world, would never mortify, tho' perhaps it might colour and hide the inward corruptions of the &s;oul. And whereas in that party &s;he belong'd to, re|ligion is reduced to the too narrow compa&s;s of cloi&s;ters and nunneries, this may really con|vince them, that the life of grace is of a far lar|ger extent, than to be &s;hut up within the nar|row pales of certain places; and that neither time nor place can re&s;train within it&s;elf the free and boundle&s;s operations of the &s;pirit of GOD, which are above time and place. An heart humbly re&s;igned to the will of GOD, and walk|ing in his fear, is the temple, wherein the LORD manife&s;ts his &s;ecrets.</P>
<P>'Tis not &s;o much the changing of places, or names, or modes and forms, or of any thing without us, as the changing of our will and
<PB N="iv" REF="007218_0003_102B3F28D7D91A40">
heart, that will render our &s;ervice at all accep|table to GOD. Hence the &s;cripture declaring, what &s;ort of change is to be wrought in a &s;oul, requires a tran&s;lation from darkne&s;s to light; (<HI>Acts xxvi.</HI> 18.) from death to life, (<HI>Eph. ii.</HI> 5.) &amp; from being lo&s;t to be found again, (<HI>Luk. xv.</HI> 32.)</P>
<P>And hence it was, that the per&s;on the&s;e pa|pers treat of, lo&s;t in a manner the &s;weet enjoy|ments of a &s;piritual life, whil&s;t &s;he &s;ought more of them in cloi&s;ters and nunneries; but re|cover'd them by going back into her former &s;tate of life; which, though it was mean and toil&s;ome in the eye of rea&s;on, (too apt to judge of things by a &s;et form, and a devotion model|led by the art and contrivance of men) yet was it that wherein &s;he enjoyed richer incomes of GOD'S favour, than perhaps others in the mo&s;t retir'd &s;olitude. And this fal&s;e rule of con|fining religion to certain places, is too com|monly ob&s;erv'd in that church this per&s;on hap|pened to be a member of.</P>
<P>What is here related of this <HI>good Armelle,</HI> is a pa&s;&s;age of her daily intercour&s;e with GOD by faith and love. How &s;he &s;pent her time from morning to night, in her dre&s;&s;ing and outward devotion, in the mid&s;t of her bu&s;ine&s;s, in eat|ing and drinking, in daily &s;ufferings and temp|tations, in the evening, and when &s;he went to bed. In &s;hort: it &s;hews the manner of her child-like, hearty and confident conver&s;ing with GOD as her only love, her father, and intimate friend; and this at all times, in all pla|ces,
<PB N="V" REF="007218_0003_102B3F28D7D91A40">
and upon all occa&s;ions, without u&s;ing any other art or my&s;tery, but that of faith and love.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of this &s;hort e&s;&s;ay, is to excite &s;ome able pen or other, to undertake the tran&s;|lation of the whole account of this &s;piritual maid into <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> it appearing already in &s;eve|ral languages, for promoting the more &s;ub&s;tan|tial points of inward and un&s;ophi&s;ticated piety and religion. This is taken f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">m the <HI>French</HI> edition, printed with a large preface at <HI>Cologn</HI> in the Year 1704, under this title: <HI>The &s;chool of the pure love of GOD, opened both to the lear|ned and unlearned, in the marvellous Life of</HI> Ar|melle Nicolas, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The LORD give his grace to all that hear|tily de&s;ire it, always to walk before him after &s;uch a pious manner as this pious &s;oul did, whereof &s;he her&s;elf gave the following account to the author, of her life.</P>

<HEAD>A Chri&s;tian's daily Conver&s;ation with GOD.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as I wake in the Morning, <HI>&s;aith &s;he,</HI> I throw my &s;elf into the arms of my heavenly love, as a child into the arms of his father. I ri&s;e with a de&s;ign to &s;erve and plea&s;e him. And if I have time to pray, I fall upon my knees in his holy pre&s;ence, and &s;peak to him, as if I really &s;aw him with my bodily eyes. I give my &s;elf up wholly to him, and de&s;ire him, to fulfil all his holy will in me, and that he would not &s;uffer me that day to do the lea&s;t thing which might be offen&s;ive to him. Then I recommend to him all the pray|ers which &s;hall be made that day. In &s;hort: I love, and prai&s;e him as much and as long as my affairs permit; tho' very often I have hardly &s;o much time as to &s;ay the Lord's Prayer. But I do not trouble my &s;elf about that; for I have God always in my heart, as well when I am about my bu&s;ine&s;s, which I do in obedience to his will, as when I retire on purpo&s;e to pray to him. This he him&s;elf has taught me, that whatever I do out of love to him, is a real prayer.</P>
<P>I dre&s;s my&s;elf in his pre&s;ence, and he &s;hews me that his love &s;upplies me with raiment. And when I go a bout my bu&s;ine&s;s, even then doth he not for&s;ake me, nor I him; but he conver&s;es with me, and I with him; yea, I am then as much united to him, as when I am at my prayers, &s;et apart on purpo&s;e for my &s;piritual recollec|tion. O! how &s;weet and ea&s;y is all labour and toil in &s;uch good company! Sometimes I perceive &s;uch &s;trength and &s;upport in my mind, that nothing is too hard for me, and I think my&s;elf alone able to manage the affairs of the whole family. Nothing but the body is at work, the heart and my&s;elf burn with love in the &s;weet familiarity I entertain with God.</P>
<P>I eat and drink in his pre&s;ence, as I do every thing
<PB N="7" REF="007218_0004_102B3F2BB328F450">
el&s;e, and it is as if I dipp'd every bit into the precious blood of my Saviour, and as if he him&s;elf gave me food, on purpo&s;e to inflame my love, and to engage it the more to him&s;elf. I leave you to judge, what effect this mu&s;t have upon my &s;oul. Indeed it is impo&s;&s;ible for any body to expre&s;s it but God him&s;elf. As for me, my whole life would never be &s;ufficient to give an account of it.</P>
<P>Whan I am about my bu&s;ine&s;s in the day time, run|ning up and down, till the body begins to be weary, or to repine, or to de&s;ire un&s;ea&s;onable re&s;t, being oppre&s;&s;ed with anger and unea&s;ine&s;s; my divine love enlightens me forthwith, and &s;hews me, how I ought to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e rebellious motions of corrupt nature, and not to nouri&s;h them at all, either by word or deed. This love keeps the door of my lips, and watches over my heart, that it may not in the lea&s;t contribute to &s;uch irregular pa&s;&s;ions, which thus are cru&s;hed and &s;ubdu'd as &s;oon as they ri&s;e.</P>
<P>But if at any time, for want of care, I am &s;urpri&s;ed with the&s;e or the like faults, I cannot be at re&s;t, till I have ob|tained pardon, and God be reconciled to me. I lie pro|&s;trate before his foot&s;tool, confe&s;&s;ing all my faults to him, as if he did not know them already; and there I continue, till he has forgiven me, renewed his friend&s;hip with me, and confirm'd it more than before. For &s;o it always hap|pens through his infinite mercy, whenever I have com|mitted a fault, which &s;erves but to inflame my heart more and more with his divine love. If people per&s;ecute me, and by foul and uncharitable cen&s;ures rai&s;e &s;candals upon me, or any other way aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ict me; or if evil &s;pririts attack me with their crafty cunning temptations, I then pre&s;ent|ly run to my heavenly LOVE, who readily &s;tretches forth his &s;acred arms to receive me, &s;hewing me his heart and wounds open for my &s;ecurity; in which I hide my &s;elf as in a &s;trong ca&s;tle and fortre&s;s. And then I am &s;o mightily &s;trengthned, that if the whole army of hell it&s;elf, together with all the creatures, &s;hould ri&s;e up again&s;t me, I fear them no more than a fly, becau&s;e I am under the protec|tion of the mo&s;t high God, his love being the hiding-place and &s;afe-guard of my &s;oul.</P>
<P>If God at any time hides his face, making as if he would
<PB N="8" REF="007218_0005_102B3F2D439BB4C0">
go away from me, I tell him: <Q>O! 'tis no matter, my love, conceal thy&s;elf as much as thou plea&s;e&s;t, never|thele&s;s I'll &s;erve thee; for I know that thou art my God.</Q> And then I &s;tand upon my guard more than ever, to be faithful to him, for fear of di&s;plea&s;ing my love. And at the &s;ame time perceiving the greatne&s;s of my mi&s;ery and po|verty, I in&s;i&s;t the more upon the merits of our Saviour, and re&s;olve to re&s;t contented, tho' it &s;hould plea&s;e him to leave me all the days of my life in &s;uch a condition. But he never lets me continue long under the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces, and if I may venture &s;o to &s;peak, he cannot forbear loving me, any more than I can live without him.</P>
<P>At his return he recompen&s;es the little moment of his ab&s;ence with &s;o many care&s;&s;es and endearments, that of|tentimes I am not able to bear them, but am forced to cry out: <Q>I can receive no more! wherefore I de&s;ire him to moderate my &s;en&s;ation, or el&s;e to let me die under the powerful &s;en&s;e of his gracious pre&s;ence.</Q></P>
<P>Many times, to bear this the better, I leave all, retiring into a corner to ea&s;e my&s;elf, by giving vent to the tears and prai&s;es due to his Maje&s;ty, wherewith my heart is overcharged. And this I may do very well, &s;ince it is not the mere &s;en&s;e of his kindne&s;s I long for, but rather HIM|SELF ALONE, that I de&s;ire to enjoy. Altho' in the mean time one ought thankfully to receive the&s;e extraordinary tokens of God's mercy and love, if it be his holy will &s;o to deal with us.</P>
<P>If I am per&s;uaded on holidays, to be merry in compa|ny, I excu&s;e my&s;elf. For nothing can be compared to the plea&s;ures of my love, which are &s;o much the &s;weeter and greater, for my withdrawing from all company what|&s;oever. If they wonder, how I can &s;tay always at home alone, I think within my&s;elf: <Q>O! if you knew the glori|ous company I have, you would not &s;ay that I was alone: for I am never le&s;s alone, than when I have no body with me.</Q></P>
<P>After this manner I &s;pend not only working days, but holy days too, being often as much employed in the latter as in the former. But that is no hindrance to me, to whom labour and re&s;t, hard work and ea&s;y, all things are indif|ferent,
<PB N="9" REF="007218_0005_102B3F2D439BB4C0">
&s;ince I do not look upon what I have to do, but upon him, for who&s;e &s;ake I do it. I am &s;o taken up with his love, that I have no time to mind my &s;elf, nor any thing el&s;e but him alone.</P>
<P>But if I do any thing ami&s;s, or out of &s;ea&s;on, the &s;ame moment I feel a violent pain and &s;orrow for what I have done, &s;pringing from my love, which al&s;o makes me pre|&s;ently hope for pardon; &s;o that thinking of it no more, I go &s;trait forward on my way, turning a&s;ide neither to the right hand, nor to the left. Neither do I remember what is pa&s;t, or to come, but only, that I may love God to the utmo&s;t of my power.</P>
<P>The night coming on, and every one going to re&s;t, I find re&s;t only in the arms of divine love: I &s;leep leaning on his holy brea&s;t, like a child in his mother's bo&s;om. I &s;ay, I go to &s;leep, but being &s;till bu&s;ied about the love and prai&s;es of my God, till I fall quite a&s;leep. Many times this love rouzes up all my &s;en&s;es, &s;o that I cannot &s;leep the greate&s;t part of the night, but I &s;pend it in the embraces of the lovely grace of God, which never for&s;akes &s;uch a poor mi&s;erable creature as I am, but pre&s;erves me, and takes &s;pecial care of me.</P>
<P>If in the night the evil &s;pirits hover about, to torment or to &s;urpri&s;e me (which often happens) this divine love guards me, and fights for me. Yea, it gives me grace, too, to re&s;i&s;t them couragiou&s;ly, as if I were awake. For they &s;eldom continue long to a&s;&s;ault me, unle&s;s it be in my &s;leep.</P>
<P>And this is the life I have led for the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t, without perceiving the lea&s;t change of that love which was poured out into my heart, after my &s;incere conver|&s;ion unto him. Nay, I have ob&s;erved its daily increa&s;e, tho' every day it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible to endure any addition to what I already enjoyed. But truly, it is an infinite love, which &s;atisfies and nouri&s;hes me, &s;o that every day I have a new hunger, tho' methinks I can receive no more, than what I po&s;&s;e&s;s already every moment.</P>
<P>THE author of her life &s;ays, concerning the manner of her expre&s;&s;ions, that they were always very mode&s;t, with|out any noi&s;e or vehemence: her common di&s;cour&s;es were always holy and edifying; whereas others too commonly
<PB N="10" REF="007218_0006_102B3F2F88495680">
mi&s;&s;pend their time in u&s;ele&s;s conver&s;ation and unprofitable talk. If &s;he was in company, where they talk'd of indiffer|ent or evil things, &s;he had the faculty of giving them &s;uch a hand&s;ome turn, as to bring them quite off from that to &s;ome good and u&s;eful &s;ubject.</P>
<P>For a long while &s;he could bear no other di&s;cour&s;e but of God, and his holy love. <HI>I cannot imagine,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>how a &s;oul created for heaven can be concerned about the dro&s;s of this world.</HI> From that time, if &s;he happened to be in com|pany, where the &s;ubject of the di&s;cour&s;e was but indiffer|ent, either &s;he did not mind it at all, entertaining her&s;elf in the mean while with God; or, as &s;oon as &s;he thought it proper, &s;he diverted and changed the di&s;cour&s;e; thinking it but lo&s;t time, which was &s;pent in the trifles of this world.</P>
<P>To every body, that had a mind to be acquainted with God Almighty, &s;he gave this advice: <Q>To be &s;ilent, and to learn to keep their thoughts together in the center of the heart: for this, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> is the beginning of our union with God, and by the&s;e means the &s;oul forgets earthly things, and rai&s;es her&s;elf up to the contemplation of heavenly ob|jects. We ought to lo&s;e our familiarity with the crea|tures, if we de&s;ire to anjoy the conver&s;ation of the Crea|tor; a moment of which doth afford more delight and &s;a|tisfaction, than all the fine&s;t di&s;cour&s;es in the world.</Q></P>
<P>SHE declared once, that &s;he did by no means encourage any de&s;ire of knowing what did not concern her&s;elf. When a certain per&s;on a&s;k'd her, whether &s;he did not know &s;uch a &s;tory, that the town rang of at that time? <Q>&s;he an&s;wered, no; and gave God thanks, that &s;he never knew any thing of the news of this world, neither did &s;he de&s;ire to know it. But &s;he knew a great deal of news concerning the love and mercies of Almighty God. For this &s;he &s;aid was the only thing &s;he de&s;ired to know, and wherewith her heart was entirely taken up.</Q></P>
<P>The real <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he had of the inward and &s;piritual life of grace, and of the manifold operations it is attended with, doth abundantly apear from the larger account of her life and conver&s;ion. To give the reader a ta&s;te there of may &s;uffice for the pre&s;ent:</P>
<P>One time when her mi&s;tre&s;s was afraid that <HI>Armelle</HI> was
<PB N="11" REF="007218_0006_102B3F2F88495680">
like to run quite mad by an exce&s;s of devotion, &s;he forbad her all &s;piritual exerci&s;es, and would not let her go even to church, except on the Lord's day only: <HI>Armelle</HI> being &s;en|&s;ible of the fal&s;e &s;tep her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tre&s;s took, &s;miled with her&s;elf, &s;aying, <Q>Truly, I am not mad, after I have found my be|loved, whom I now love with all my heart. I remember a time when I was &s;eeking only God without me, and than I was mad indeed.</Q> This mi&s;tre&s;s of hers being of a &s;our and moro&s;e humour, &s;hew'd a deal of ill-nature to <HI>Armelle,</HI> of which, however &s;he never complain'd, but ra|ther thanked God, that he was plea&s;ed to make this a means of her fuller purification. When her friends &s;eeing what &s;he &s;uffered in that hou&s;e, advi&s;ed her one time, entire|ly to quit that place, &s;he replied according to her u&s;ual earne&s;tne&s;s: <Q>Why would you have me flee from the cro&s;s which the Lord him&s;elf has entailed upon me? No, by no means: I &s;hall never do it, except you ab&s;olu|tely command it. If I &s;hould undergo a thou&s;and times as much, I &s;hall never for&s;ake the place for all that, but ra|ther &s;tay till they turn me away by force.</Q> In which un|expected an&s;wer they acquie&s;ced, never prompting her again to quit a place, where &s;he had daily opportunity to practi&s;e <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Self-denial;</HI> virtues &s;o much contrary to the whole bent of corrupt nature, and yet &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for rightly framing a Chri&s;tian life and con|ver&s;ation. At another time &s;he &s;aid: <Q>If the &s;oul be but well grounded in the favour of God, and lively affected with the operations of his grace, all the in&s;ults of the devil, and of the creature, are born with joy and comfort. But that is mi&s;ery indeed, when the Lord him&s;elf withdraws from the &s;oul, and lets her &s;hift for her&s;elf. Then &s;he thinks, that every &s;tep is a &s;tep into &s;in and corruption, be|ing utterly unable to protect her&s;elf again&s;t it.</Q></P>
<P>In what company &s;oever &s;he was, &s;he talked of nothing more than of <HI>being faithful to God.</HI> Nothing dropped more from her mouth, than <HI>Let us be faithful, let us be faithful to the Lord.</HI> This word &s;he thought fit for any time, and &s;uitable to every company. Now and then &s;he would re|peat it an hundred times over; and being a&s;ked by her friends, whether &s;he had nothing el&s;e to &s;ay: She an&s;wer'd:
<PB N="12" REF="007218_0007_102B3F315CD3C6A8">
<Q>Don't wonder at my &s;aying this over and over again. If I &s;hould live a thou&s;and years, I &s;hould &s;till tell ye the &s;ame thing. For 'tis faithfulne&s;s, wherein the perfection of a Chri&s;tian life con&s;i&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P>Of the con&s;training power of the divine love &s;he has the following expre&s;&s;ion: <Q>Whenever I happened to adhere a little too much to my natural inclinations (apt to &s;teal in upon the mind under the &s;pecious pretence of nece&s;&s;ity) I was immediately reproved by the love of God. This di|vine love is like a careful tutor, who takes all the pains imaginable, for advancing his pupil in the way of learning he is engaged in; and for this rea&s;on keeps his eye con|&s;tantly fixed on him, both to correct his failings, though never &s;o &s;mall, and to prevent his being led away by any thing that might divert him from his chief employment. Thus, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> dealt the Lord with me. He kept me clo&s;e|ly confined to an holy awe and warine&s;s; and when I hap|pened by one over&s;ight or other to withdraw, as it were, from his eye, he in that very moment pur&s;ued after me, and recall'd me to my duty. But all this was done with &s;o much love and tenderne&s;s, that it mu&s;t be a heart of bra&s;s, if not mollified by &s;uch endearing marks of love and kindne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Of the di&s;orderly love to friends and relations, which now and then even well-di&s;po&s;ed &s;ouls are too much guilty of, &s;he gives the following account: <Q>One time, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> my parents came to &s;ee me; when I entertain'd them, I found my &s;elf tran&s;ported with &s;ome vain joy and plea&s;ure, and &s;omewhat coldi&s;h in minding the impre&s;&s;ions of the love of God; nay, it &s;eem'd as if the Lord him&s;elf did in a manner withdraw from me, to let me have as it were, the more liberty for the pre&s;ent. But no &s;ooner my parents were gone, and I come to my&s;elf, the burden and afflicti|on I then felt upon my &s;pirit, was heavy enough, &s;ince I did not find him whom I lov'd more than my own &s;oul. However, as &s;oon as I came home, I felt again a noble re|turn of the divine love, and it was, as if the Lord had wai|ted for me on purpo&s;e, to communicate him&s;elf unto me.</Q> After this &s;he freely confe&s;s'd, that from that very time &s;he found her&s;elf entirely freed from all manner of irregular ad|herency
<PB N="13" REF="007218_0007_102B3F315CD3C6A8">
to her parents, whom &s;he was too fond of hereto|fore, being now only taken up with the grand concern of promoting the more &s;piritual part of her friends and fellow-creatures: <Q>Thus, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> the love of God made every thing, nay even my very faults and imperfections, re|dound to my greater &s;piritual good and welfare.</Q></P>
<P>'Twas mention'd before, how earne&s;t &s;he was in exhor|ting every one to be faithful unto the Lord with what he had received. This faithfulne&s;s recommended by her unto others, &s;he was a mo&s;t &s;hining pattern of her&s;elf in her whole Life and conver&s;ation. But it mo&s;t vi&s;ibly appeared in that unwearied readine&s;s and quickne&s;s &s;he di&s;patch'd any thing tending to promote the glory of God in her &s;tation. No &s;ooner was &s;he convinc'd of the will of God, but was very earne&s;t and diligent, to an&s;wer it pre&s;ently. She often won|der'd at &s;ome peoples dilatory doings in the &s;ervice of God, and &s;aid, it was a cunning fetch and &s;tratagem of the devil, to make people put off from one day to another &s;uch de&s;igns as might &s;erve to advance the glory of God, and the good of our fellow creatures. <Q><HI>For,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>it often hap|pens, that that grace which at one hour offers it&s;elf to a man, in order to &s;upport him under &s;ome difficult enterpri&s;es, is not &s;o ea&s;ily met with at another time.</HI> And be&s;ides this, how uncertain is our life! nay, if we were &s;ure to live lon|ger, yet ought we not to linger upon that account at all, nor to defer from one day to another what might be done this day. A man that is full of delays in the &s;ervice of God, mu&s;t needs have but little love at the bottom. <HI>Wherever love is rai&s;ed to any con&s;iderable degree, there the &s;oul can't re&s;t, whil&s;t there remains any thing to be done requir'd by the Beloved.</HI> And this dilatory temper, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> was a great impediment in the way to perfection. Many &s;ouls were convinc'd of the will of God, but being too back|ward con&s;tantly to &s;truggle again&s;t the corrupt propen&s;i|ons of their dull and lazy t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mper, they made but a &s;low progre&s;s in the work of religion. They &s;ay, to-morrow, to-morrow it &s;hall be done in good earne&s;t; but that to-morrow never comes. The con&s;equence whereof is, that the longer they flatter them&s;elves in their di&s;orderly and wonted cu&s;toms, the le&s;s able they are to re&s;i&s;t them
<PB N="14" REF="007218_0008_102B3F3397266C10">
at la&s;t at all: the Lord leaves them now to their own will, &s;ince they did not improve faithfully what once they had receiv'd.</Q></P>
<P>THE virtue of humility was as remarkable in this holy maid as any of the re&s;t; and it was grounded on a true and &s;olid foundation too. She confe&s;&s;es her&s;elf, that the infi|nite love of God kept her undefiled as to the vanity of pride; in&s;omuch that &s;he did not know what pride and haughtine&s;s was. <Q>I was a&s;toni&s;hed, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> when I was told to <HI>watch again&s;t pride;</HI> for I thought whil&s;t I was well in my wits, I could not po&s;&s;ibly be proud. I was &s;o fully convinced that any thing really good was from God, that if all angels and men had offer'd to per&s;uade me to the contrary, I &s;hould never have believ'd them. And this &s;en&s;e fortified me again&s;t all manner of pride and pre&s;ump|tion, my own con&s;cience never charging me with the lea&s;t guilt of that vice, and I could not imagine how it was po&s;|&s;ible, that men &s;hould attempt &s;o heinous a thing as this.</Q> And this was the rea&s;on, that &s;he never would quit that manner of life &s;he was bred to, though mean and contemp|tible in the eye of the world.</P>
<P>Even her &s;piritual friends would now and then mo&s;t im|portunately intreat her, to re&s;ign up to any body el&s;e her place (which was that of a &s;ervant) and this under a fair pretence too, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That &s;he might have the more lei&s;ure to give her&s;elf up to a contemplative life, and thus to enjoy the favours and gracious infu&s;ions of the Lord more abun|dantly. And indeed there wanted no opportunity of at|taining &s;uch a quiet retirement, as &s;ome had cut out for her. But &s;he could never be prevailed with to comply. She had too high and e&s;teem for her low condition. <Q>She &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould never do &s;uch a thing, except &s;he was vi|&s;ibly convinced of the will of God. For tho' her &s;tation was but mean, yet was &s;he more pleas'd with it, than with all the prayers and contemplations &s;he perhaps might enjoy in the mo&s;t concealed &s;olitude of the world. She &s;aid, her outward employment and all the drugery &s;he was put to, did not at all cool or weaken the &s;en&s;e of the love, and of the gracious pre&s;ence of the Lord, &s;he u&s;ual|ly enjoyed. Nay, the more fervent &s;he was to &s;pend her|&s;elf
<PB N="15" REF="007218_0008_102B3F3397266C10">
entirely in works of charity, chearfully complying with every thing incident to her life, the more plentiful incomes &s;he had of the love and favour of God. Hence, it would be but the effect of a fal&s;e heart, if one &s;hould make bold to quit his outward employment, in order to gain more re&s;t and quiet in another place, <HI>God,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>knows ways to find &s;ouls wherever they be, if they do not wilfully &s;hut their hearts again&s;t him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Becau&s;e her love to God was great and fervent, the love &s;he bore to her fellow creatures, was al&s;o wonderfully in|fluenc'd and inflam'd thereby. When &s;he con&s;ider'd the woful &s;tate of the wicked, and the dreadful judgment that is like to befal them at la&s;t, &s;he then felt a mo&s;t tender and commi&s;erating love, and her very bowels began to yearn for compa&s;&s;ion. When &s;he look'd upon the happy &s;tate &s;he was arriv'd to, and the &s;evere doom attending &s;uch profli|gate wretches, &s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay, <Q>She &s;eemed unto her&s;elf like one that had been in a great &s;torm at &s;ea, and by &s;tre&s;s of weather like to be ca&s;t away every minute; but get|ting off at la&s;t &s;afe and &s;ound, remember'd now a&s;hore the dangers his bretheren and near relations were &s;till expo&s;ed to, being to&s;s'd up and down in the huge ocean, and left to the mercy of the roaring billows. Alas! <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> thus it is with me, when I lay to heart the danger &s;inners run them&s;elves into. For the more endearing marks of divine grace the Lord has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon me, the more fervent is my de&s;ire, that al&s;o others might partake of the &s;ame with me.</Q></P>
<P>AND now, ye learned men, and refin'd wits of the age, come hither and admire the ignorance and &s;implicity of this poor country maid! Con&s;ider how far &s;he exceeds your high flown &s;uperficial wi&s;dom, and the dark fla&s;hes of human wit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nd learning? And was it po&s;&s;ible for her to attain to this <HI>heavenly wi&s;dom and divine knowledge,</HI> to &s;uch a noble|ne&s;s and elevation of mind, without the &s;craps and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of artificial learning and philo&s;ophy? then truly, there mu&s;t be another &s;chool wherein tho&s;e that <HI>look unto the Lord</HI> (P&s;. xxxiv. 5.) <HI>are lightned.</HI> Indeed, <HI>to know the love of Chri&s;t, pa&s;&s;eth all knowledge,</HI> Eph. iii. 19. Concerning which our Saviour was pleas'd thus to expre&s;s his grateful

&s;entiments with hearty joy, and heavenly triumph: <HI>I thank thee, O Father, lord of heaven and earth, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t hid the&s;e things from the wi&s;e and prudent, and ha&s;t reveal|ed them unto babes. Even &s;o, Father, for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy &s;ight,</HI> Matt. xi. 25, 26. <HI>For it is written</HI> (&s;ays St. Paul) <HI>I will de&s;troy the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e, and will bring to no|thing the under&s;tanding of the prudent. Where is the wi&s;e? where is the &s;cribe? where is the di&s;puter of this world? But God hath cho&s;en the fooli&s;h things of this world, to con|found the wi&s;e; and God hath cho&s;en the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty. And ba&s;e things of the world, and things which are de&s;pi&s;ed hath God cho&s;en, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are. That no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his pre&s;ence,</HI> 1 Cor. i. 19, 20, 27, 28, 29. I&s;a. xxix. 14. Chap. xxxiii. 18.</P>
<P><HI>Laurentius de la re&s;urection,</HI> in his &s;piritual letters, &s;ays: <Q>I de&s;ire you to remember what I have often recommended to you, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That you do not forget God, day nor night, in all your employments and exerci&s;es, nor in your bodi|ly refre&s;hments. He is always pre&s;ent with you, do not let him &s;tay alone. It would be very uncivil to leave a friend alone by him&s;elf that came to &s;ee you. Why will you do &s;o with God? Pray do not forget him; think of|ten upon, pray to him without cea&s;ing; live and die with him. This is the be&s;t work a Chri&s;tian can be em|ployed about. In &s;hort, it is our profe&s;&s;ion, our trade and calling.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If we do not know it, we mu&s;t learn it: we mu&s;t deny all that doth not tend to the glory of God, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> our&s;elves to a continual, familiar and humble con|ver&s;ation and intercour&s;e with him. And withal, to pre|vent our &s;ouls &s;werving from it upon any occa&s;ion what|&s;oever, our heart mu&s;t be the &s;piritual temple, wherein we continually offer up our prayers. We mu&s;t watch our&s;elves narrowly, that we may neither do, nor &s;peak, nor think, whatever may be di&s;plea&s;ing to him.</Q> <HI>Col.</HI> iv. 2. Ch. iii. 17.</P>
