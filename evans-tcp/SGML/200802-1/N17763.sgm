<HEAD>REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>TREASURY DEPARTMENT,
<DATE><HI>January</HI> 9, 1790.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, in obedience to the re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, of the twenty-fir&s;t day of September la&s;t, has, during the rece&s;s of Congre&s;s, applied him&s;elf to the con&s;ideration of a proper plan for the &s;upport of the Public Credit, with all the attention which was due to the authority of the Hou&s;e, and to the magnitude of the object.</P>
<P>In the di&s;charge of this duty, he has felt, in no &s;mall degree, the anxieties which naturally flow from a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the difficulty of the ta&s;k, from a well-founded diffidence of his own qualifi|cations for executing it with &s;ucce&s;s, and from a deep and &s;olemn conviction of the momentous nature of the truth contained in the re&s;olution under which his inve&s;tigations have been conducted, "That an <HI>adequate</HI> provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of the Public Credit, is a matter of high importance to the honor and pro&s;perity of the United States."</P>
<P>With an ardent de&s;ire that his well-m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant endeavors may be conducive to the real advantage of the nation, and with the utmo&s;t deference to the &s;uperior judgment of the Hou&s;e, he now re&s;pect|fully &s;ubmits the re&s;ult of his enquiries and reflections, to their indulgent con&s;truction.</P>
<P>In the opinion of the Secretary, the wi&s;dom of the Hou&s;e, in giving their explicit &s;anction to the propo&s;ition which has been &s;tated, cannot but be applauded by all, who will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, and trace through their obvious con&s;equences, the&s;e plain and undeniable truths.&mdash;</P>
<P>That exigencies are to be expected to occur, in the affairs of nations, in which there will be a nece&s;&s;ity for borrowing.&mdash;</P>
<P>That loans in times of public danger, e&s;pecially from foreign war, are found an indi&s;pen&s;able re&s;ource, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the wealthie&s;t of them.&mdash;</P>
<P>And that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">untry, which, like this, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of little active wealth, or in other words, little monied capit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the nece&s;&s;ity for that re&s;ource, mu&s;t, in &s;uch emergencies, be proportionably urgent.</P>
<P>And as on the one hand, the nece&s;&s;ity for borrowing in particular emergencies cannot be doubted, &s;o on the other, it is equally evident, that to be able to borrow upon <HI>good terms,</HI> it is e&s;&s;ential that the credit of a nation &s;hould be well e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>For when the credit of a country is in any degree que&s;tionable, it never fails to give an extrava|gant premium, in one &s;hape or another, upon all the loans it has occa&s;ion to make. Nor does the evil end here; the &s;ame di&s;advantage mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tained upon whatever is to be bought on terms of future payment.</P>
<P>From this con&s;tant nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>borrowing</HI> and <HI>buying dear,</HI> it is ea&s;y to conceive how immen&s;ely the expences of a nation, in a cour&s;e of time, will be augmented by an un&s;ound &s;tate of the pub|lic credit.</P>
<P>To attempt to enumerate the complicated variety of mi&s;chiefs in the whole &s;y&s;tem of the &s;ocial oeconomy, which proceed from a neglect of the maxims that uphold public credit, and ju&s;tify the &s;olicitude manife&s;ted by the Hou&s;e on this point, would be an improper intru&s;ion on their time and patience.</P>
<P>In &s;o &s;trong a light neverthele&s;s do they appear to the Secretary, that on their due ob&s;ervance at the pre&s;ent critical juncture, materially depends, in his judgment, the individual and aggregate pro&s;perity of the citizens of the United States; their relief from the embarra&s;&s;ments they now expe|rience; their character as a People; the cau&s;e of good government.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="022998_0003_0FBAD37EAD381C60">If the maintenance of public credit, then, be truly &s;o important, the next enquiry which &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf is, by what means it is to be effected?&mdash;The ready an&s;wer to which que&s;tion is, by good faith, by a punctual performance of contracts. States, like individuals, who ob&s;erve their engagements, are re&s;pected and tru&s;ted: while the rever&s;e is the fate of tho&s;e, who pur&s;ue an oppo&s;ite conduct.</P>
<P>Every breach of the public engagements, whether from choice or nece&s;&s;ity, is in differ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt de|grees hurtful to public credit. When &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ity does truly exi&s;t, the evils of it are only to be palliated by a &s;crupulous attention, on the part of the government, to carry the violation no far|ther than the nece&s;&s;ity ab&s;olutely requires, and to manife&s;t, if the nature of the ca&s;e admits of it, a &s;incere di&s;po&s;ition to make reparation, whenever circum&s;tances &s;hall permit. But with every po&s;&s;ible mitigation, credit mu&s;t &s;uffer, and numerous mi&s;chiefs en&s;ue. It is therefore highly im|portant, when an appearance of nece&s;&s;ity &s;eems to pre&s;s upon the public councils, that they &s;hould examine well its reality, and be perfectly a&s;&s;ured, that there is no method of e&s;caping from it, be|fore they yield to its &s;ugge&s;tions. For though it cannot &s;afely be affirmed, that occa&s;ions have never exi&s;ted, or may not exi&s;t, in which violations of the public faith, in this re&s;pect, are inevita|ble; yet there is great rea&s;on to believe, that they exi&s;t far le&s;s frequently than precedents indicate; and are oftene&s;t either pretended through levity, or want of firmne&s;s, or &s;uppo&s;ed through want of knowledge. Expedients might often have been devi&s;ed to effect, con&s;i&s;tently with good faith, what has been done in contravention of it. Tho&s;e who are mo&s;t commonly creditors of a nation, are, generally &s;peaking, enlightened men; and there are &s;ignal examples to warrant a conclu&s;ion, that when a candid and fair appea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is made to them, they will under&s;tand their true intere&s;t too well to refu&s;e their concurrence in &s;uch modifications of their claims, as any real nece&s;&s;ity may demand.</P>
<P>While the ob&s;ervance of that good faith, which is the ba&s;is of public credit, is recommended by the &s;tronge&s;t inducements of political expediency, it is enforced by con&s;iderations of &s;till greater authority. There are arguments for it, which re&s;t on the immutable principles of moral obligation. And in proportion as the mind is di&s;po&s;ed to contemplate, in the order of Providence, an intimate connection between public virtue and public happine&s;s, will be its repugnancy to a violation of tho&s;e principles.</P>
<P>This reflection derives additional &s;trength from the nature of the debt of the United States. It was the price of liberty. The faith of America has been repeatedly pledged for it, and with &s;o|lemnities, that give peculiar force to the obligation. There is indeed rea&s;on to regret that it has not hitherto been kept; that the nece&s;&s;ities of the war, con&s;piring with inexperience in the &s;ub|jects of finance, produced direct infractions; and that the &s;ub&s;equent period has been a continu|ed &s;cene of negative violation, or non-compliance. But a dimunition of this regret ari&s;es from the reflection, that the la&s;t &s;even years have exhibited an earne&s;t and uniform effort, on the part of the government of the union, to retrieve the national credit, by doing ju&s;tice to the creditors of the nation; and that the embarra&s;&s;ments of a defective con&s;titution, which defeated this laudable effort, have cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>From this evidence of a favorable di&s;po&s;ition, given by the former government, the in&s;titution of a new one, cloathed with powers competent to calling forth the re&s;ources of the community, has excited corre&s;pondent expectations. A general belief, accordingly, prevails, that the credit of the United States will quickly be e&s;tabli&s;hed on the firm foundation of an effectual provi&s;ion for the exi&s;ting debt. The influence, which this has had at home, is witne&s;&s;ed by the rapid increa&s;e, that has taken place in the market value of the public &s;ecurities. From January to November, they ro&s;e thirty-three and a third per cent, and from that period to this time, they have ri&s;en fifty per cent more. And the intelligence from abroad announces effects proportionably favourable to our national credit and con&s;equence.</P>
<P>It cannot but merit particular attention, that among our&s;elves the mo&s;t enlightened friends of good government are tho&s;e, who&s;e expectations are the highe&s;t.</P>
<P>To ju&s;tify and pre&s;erve their confidence; to promote the encrea&s;ing re&s;pectability of the American name; to an&s;wer the calls of ju&s;tice; to re&s;tore landed property to its due value; to furni&s;h new re&s;ources both to agriculture and commerce; to cement more clo&s;ely the union of the &s;tates; to add to their &s;ecurity again&s;t foreign attack; to e&s;tabli&s;h public order on the ba&s;is of an upright and liberal policy.&mdash;The&s;e are the great and invaluable ends to be &s;ecured, by a proper and ade|quate provi&s;ion, at the pre&s;ent period, for the &s;upport of public credit.</P>
<P>To this provi&s;ion we are invited, not only by the general con&s;iderations, which have been no|ticed, but by others of a more particular nature. It will procure to every cla&s;s of the community &s;ome important advantages, and remove &s;ome no le&s;s important di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>The advantage to the public creditors from the increa&s;ed value of that part of their property which con&s;titutes the public debt, needs no explanation.</P>
<P>But there is a con&s;equence of this, le&s;s obvious, though not le&s;s true, in which every other ci|tizen is intere&s;ted. It is a well known fact, that in countries in which the national debt is properly funded, and an object of e&s;tabli&s;hed confidence, it an&s;wers mo&s;t of the purpo&s;es of mo|ney.
<PB N="5" REF="022998_0004_0FBAD3803293C100">
Transfers of &s;tock or public debt are there equivalent to payments in &s;pecie; or in other words, &s;tock, in the principal tran&s;actions of bu&s;ine&s;s, pa&s;&s;es current as &s;pecie.&mdash;The &s;ame thing would, in all probability happen here, under the like circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The benefits of this are various and obvious.&mdash;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Trade is extended by it; becau&s;e there is a larger capital to carry it on, and the mer|chant can at the &s;ame time, afford to trade for &s;maller profits; as his &s;tock, which, when unem|ployed, brings him in an intere&s;t from the government, &s;erves him al&s;o as money, when he has a call for it in his commercial operations.</P>
<P>Secondly. Agriculture and manufactures are al&s;o promoted by it: For the like rea&s;on, that more capital can be commanded to be employed in both; and becau&s;e the merchant, who&s;e en|terprize in foreign trade, gives to them activity and exten&s;ion, has greater means for enterprize.</P>
<P>Thirdly. The intere&s;t of money will be lowered by it; for this is always in a ratio, to the quantity of money, and to the quickne&s;s of circulation. This circum&s;tance will enable both the public and individuals to borrow on ea&s;ier and cheaper terms.</P>
<P>And from the combination of the&s;e effects, additional aids will be furni&s;hed to labour, to in|du&s;try, and to arts of every kind.</P>
<P>But the&s;e good effects of a public debt are only to be looked for, when, by being well funded, it has acquired an <HI>adequate</HI> and <HI>&s;table</HI> value. Till then, it has rather a contrary tendency. The fluctuation and in&s;ecurity incident to it in an unfunded &s;tate, render it a mere commodity, and a precarious one. As &s;uch, being only an object of occa&s;ional and particular &s;peculation, all the money applied to it is &s;o much diverted from the more u&s;eful channels of circulation, for which the thing it&s;elf affords no &s;ub&s;titute: So that, in fact, one &s;erious inconvenience of an unfunded debt is, that it contributes to the &s;carcity of money.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction which has been little if at all attended to, is of the greate&s;t moment. It in|volves a que&s;tion immediately intere&s;ting to every part of the community; which is no other than this&mdash;Whether the public debt, by a provi&s;ion for it on true principles, &s;hall be rendered a <HI>&s;ub&s;ti|tute</HI> for money; or whether, by being left as it is, or by being provided for in &s;uch a manner as will wound tho&s;e principles, and de&s;troy confidence, it &s;hall be &s;uffered to continue, as it is, a pernicious drain of our ca&s;h from the channels of productive indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The effect, which the funding of the public debt, on right principles, would have upon landed property, is one of the circum&s;tances attending &s;uch an arrangement, which has been lea&s;t advert|ed to, though it de&s;erves the mo&s;t particular attention. The pre&s;ent depreciated &s;tate of that &s;pe|cies of property is a &s;erious calamity. The value of cultivated lands, in mo&s;t of the &s;tates, has fallen &s;ince the revolution from 25 to 50 per cent. In tho&s;e farthe&s;t &s;outh, the decrea&s;e is &s;till more con&s;iderable. Indeed, if the repre&s;entations, continually received from that quarter, may be credited, lands there will command no price, which may not be deemed an almo&s;t total &s;acri|fice.</P>
<P>This decrea&s;e, in the value of lands, ought, in a great mea&s;ure, to be attributed to the &s;carcity of money.&mdash;Con&s;equently whatever produces an augmentation of the monied capital of the coun|try, mu&s;t have a proportional effect in rai&s;ing that value. The beneficial tendency of a funded debt, in this re&s;pect, has been manife&s;ted by the mo&s;t deci&s;ive experience in Great-Britain.</P>
<P>The proprietors of lands would not only feel the benefit of this increa&s;e in the value of their pro|perty, and of a more prompt and better &s;ale, when they had occa&s;ion to &s;ell; but the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elling would be, it&s;elf, greatly dimini&s;hed. As the &s;ame cau&s;e would contribute to the facility of loans, there is rea&s;on to believe, that &s;uch of them as are indebted, would be able through that re&s;ource, to &s;atisfy their more urgent creditors.</P>
<P>It ought not however to be expected, that the advantages, de&s;cribed as likely to re&s;ult from funding the public debt, would be in&s;tantaneous. It might require &s;ome time to bring the value of &s;tock to its natural level, and to attach to it that fixed confidence, which is nece&s;&s;ary to its quality as money. Yet the late rapid ri&s;e of the public &s;ecurities encourages an expectation, that the progre&s;s of &s;tock to the de&s;ireable point, will be much more expeditious than could have been fore&s;een. And as in the mean time it will be increa&s;ing in value, there is room to conclude, that it will, from the out&s;et, an&s;wer many of the purpo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in contemplation. Particularly it &s;eems to be probable, that from creditors, who are not them&s;elves nece&s;&s;itous, it will early meet with a ready reception in payment of debts, at its current price.</P>
<P>Having now taken a conci&s;e view of the inducements to a proper provi&s;ion for the public debt, the next enquiry which pre&s;ents it&s;elf is, what ought to be the nature of &s;uch a provi&s;ion? This requires &s;ome preliminary di&s;cu&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all hands, that that part of the debt which has been contracted abroad, and is denominated the foreign debt, ought to be provided for, according to the preci&s;e terms of the contracts relating to it. The di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, which can ari&s;e, therefore, will have reference e&s;&s;ential|ly to the dome&s;tic part of it, or to that which has been contracted at home, It is to be regretted, that there is not the &s;ame unanimity of &s;entiment on this part, as on the other.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="022998_0005_0FBAD381AF4AC408">The Secretary has too much deference for the opinions of every part of the community, not to have ob&s;erved one, which has, more than once, made its appearance in the public prints, and which is occa&s;ionally to be met with in conver&s;ation. It involves this que&s;tion, whether a di&s;|crimination ought not to be made between original holders of the public &s;ecurities, and pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, by purcha&s;e. Tho&s;e who advocate a di&s;crimination are for making a full provi&s;ion for the &s;ecurities of the former, at their nominal value; but contend, that the latter ought to receive no more than the co&s;t to them, and the intere&s;t: And the idea is &s;ometimes &s;ugge&s;ted of making good the difference to the primitive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>In favor of this &s;cheme, it is alledged, that it would be unrea&s;onable to pay twenty &s;hillings in the pound, to one who had not given more for it than three or four. And it is added, that it would be hard to aggravate the misfortune of the fir&s;t owner, who, probably through nece&s;&s;i|ty, parted with his property at &s;o great a lo&s;s, by obliging him to contribute to the profit of the per&s;on, who had &s;peculated on his di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Secretary, after the mo&s;t mature reflection on the force of this argument, is induced to reject the doctrine it contains, as equally unju&s;t and impolitic, as highly injurious, even to the original holders of public &s;ecurities;&mdash;as ruinous to public credit.</P>
<P>It is incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tice, becau&s;e in the fir&s;t place, it is a breach of contract; in violation of the rights of a fair purcha&s;er.</P>
<P>The nature of the contract in its origin, is, that the public will pay the &s;um expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ecurity, to the fir&s;t holder, or his <HI>a&s;&s;ignee.</HI> The <HI>intent,</HI> in making the &s;ecurity a&s;&s;ignable, is, that the proprietor may be able to make u&s;e of his property, by &s;elling it for as much as it <HI>may be worth in the market,</HI> and that the buyer may be <HI>&s;afe</HI> in the purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>Every buyer therefore &s;tands exactly in the place of the &s;eller&mdash;has the &s;ame right with him to the identical &s;um expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ecurity, and having acquired that right, by fair purcha&s;e, and in conformity to the original <HI>agreement</HI> and <HI>intention</HI> of the government, his claim cannot be di&s;|puted, without manife&s;t inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>That he is to be con&s;idered as a fair purcha&s;er, re&s;ults from this: Whatever nece&s;&s;ity the &s;el|ler may have been under, was occa&s;ioned by the government, in not making a proper provi&s;ion for its debts. The buyer had no agency in it, and therefore ought not to &s;uffer. He is not even chargeable with having taken an undue advantage. He paid what the commodity was worth in the market, and took the ri&s;ks of reimbur&s;ement upon him&s;elf. He of cour&s;e gave a fair equiva|lent, and ought to reap the benefit of his hazard; a hazard which was far from incon&s;iderable, and which, perhaps, turned on little le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a revolution in government.</P>
<P>That the ca&s;e of tho&s;e, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with their &s;ecurities from nece&s;&s;ity, is a hard one, cannot be denied. But whatever complaint of injury, or claim of redre&s;s, they may have, re&s;pects the government &s;olely. They have not only nothing to object to the per&s;ons who relieved their ne|ce&s;&s;ities, by giving them the current price of their property, but they are even under an implied condition to contribute to the reimbur&s;ement of tho&s;e per&s;ons. They knew, that by the terms of the contract with them&s;elves, the public were bound to pay to tho&s;e, to whom they &s;hould convey their title, the &s;ums &s;tipulated to be paid to them; and, that as citizens of the United States, they were to bear their proportion of the contribution for that purpo&s;e. This, by the act of a&s;&s;ignment, they tacitly engage to do; and if they had an option, they could not, with integri|ty or good faith, refu&s;e to do it, without the con&s;ent of tho&s;e to whom they &s;old.</P>
<P>But though many of the original holders &s;old from nece&s;&s;ity, it does not follow, that this was the ca&s;e with all of them. It may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;ome of them did it either through want of confidence in an eventual provi&s;ion, or from the allurements of &s;ome profitable &s;peculation. How &s;hall the&s;e different cla&s;&s;es be di&s;criminated from each other? How &s;hall it be a&s;certained, in any ca&s;e, that the money, which the original holder obtained for his &s;ecurity, was not more beneficial to him, than if he had held it to the pre&s;ent time, to avail him&s;elf of the provi&s;ion which &s;hall be made? How &s;hall it be known, whether if the purcha&s;er had employed his money in &s;ome other way, he would not be in a better &s;ituation, than by having applied it in the pur|cha&s;e of &s;ecurities, though he &s;hould now receive their full amount? And if neither of the&s;e things can be known, how &s;hall it be determined whether a di&s;crimination, independent of the breach of contract, would not do a real injury to purcha&s;ers; and if it included a compen|&s;ation to the primitive proprietors, would not give them an advantage, to which they had no equitable preten&s;ion.</P>
<P>It may well be imagined, al&s;o, that there are not wanting in&s;tances, in which individuals, urg|ed by a pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, parted with the &s;ecurities received by them from the public, and &s;hortly after replaced them with others, as an indemnity for their fir&s;t lo&s;s. Shall they be deprived of the indemnity which they have endeavoured to &s;ecure by &s;o provident an arrangement?</P>
<P>Que&s;tions of this &s;ort, on a clo&s;e in&s;pection, multiply them&s;elves without end, and demon&s;trate the inju&s;tice of a di&s;crimination, even on the mo&s;t &s;ubtile calculations of equity, ab&s;tracted from the obligation of contract.</P>

<P>As a &s;pecimen of its capricious operation, it will be &s;ufficient to notice the effect it would have upon two per&s;ons, who may be &s;uppo&s;ed two years ago to have purcha&s;ed, each, &s;ecurities at three &s;hillings in the pound, and one of them to retain tho&s;e bought by him, till the di&s;crimina|tion &s;hould take place; the other to have parted with tho&s;e bought by him, within a month pa&s;t, at nine &s;hillings. The former, who had had mo&s;t confidence in the government, would in this ca&s;e only receive at the rate of three &s;hillings and the intere&s;t; while the latter, who had had le&s;s confidence would receive <HI>for what co&s;t him the &s;ame money</HI> at the rate of nine &s;hillings, and his repre&s;entative, <HI>&s;tanding in his place,</HI> would be entitled to a like rate.</P>
<P>The impolicy of a di&s;crimination re&s;ults from two con&s;iderations; one, that it proceeds upon a principle de&s;tructive of that <HI>quality</HI> of the public debt, or the &s;tock of the nation, which is e&s;&s;ential to its capacity for an&s;wering the purpo&s;es of money&mdash;that is the <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> of <HI>transfer;</HI> the other, that as well on this account, as becau&s;e it includes a breach of faith, it renders property in the funds le&s;s valuable; con&s;equently induces lenders to demand a higher premium for what they lend, and produces every other inconvenience of a bad &s;tate of public credit.</P>
<P>It will be perceived at fir&s;t &s;ight, that the transferable quality of &s;tock is e&s;&s;ential to its operation as money, and that this depends on the idea of complete &s;ecurity to the transferree, and a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that no di&s;tinction can in any circum&s;tances be made between him and the original proprietor.</P>
<P>The precedent of an inva&s;ion of this fundamental principle, would of cour&s;e tend to deprive the community of an advantage, with which no temporary &s;aving could bear the lea&s;t compari&s;on.</P>
<P>And it will as readily be perceived, that the &s;ame cau&s;e would operate a diminution of the value of &s;tock in the hands of the fir&s;t, as well as of every other holder. The price, which any man, who &s;hould incline to purcha&s;e, would be willing to give for it, would be in a compound ratio to the immediate profit it afforded, and to the chance of the continuance of his profit. If there was &s;uppo&s;ed to be any hazard of the latter, the ri&s;k would be taken into the calculation, and either there would be no purcha&s;e at all, or it would be at a proportionably le&s;s price.</P>
<P>For this diminution of the value of &s;tock, every per&s;on, who &s;hould be about to lend to the government, would demand a compen&s;ation; and would add to the actual difference, between the nominal and the market value, an equivalent for the chance of greater decrea&s;e; which, in a precarious &s;tate of public credit, is always to be taken into the account.</P>
<P>Every compen&s;ation of this &s;ort, it is evident, would be an ab&s;olute lo&s;s to the government.</P>
<P>In the preceding di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the impolicy of a di&s;crimination, the injurious tendency of it to tho&s;e, who continue to be the holders of the &s;ecurities, they received from the government, has been explained. Nothing need be added, on this head, except that this is an additional and in|tere&s;ting light, in which the inju&s;tice of the mea&s;ure may be &s;een. It would not only dive&s;t pre|&s;ent proprietors by purcha&s;e, of the rights they had acquired under the &s;anction of public faith, but it would depreciate the property of the remaining original holders.</P>
<P>It is equally unnece&s;&s;ary to add any thing to what has been already &s;aid to demon&s;trate the fatal influence, which the principle of di&s;crimination would have on the public credit.</P>
<P>But there is &s;till a point in view in which it will appear perhaps even more exceptionable, than in either of the former. It would be repugnant to an expre&s;s provi&s;ion of the Con&s;titution of the United States. This provi&s;ion is, that "all debts con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">racted and engagements entered into be|fore the adoption of that Con&s;titution &s;hall be as valid again&s;t the United States under it, as un|der the confederation," which amounts to a con&s;titutional ratification of the contracts re&s;pecting the debt, in the &s;tate in which they exi&s;ted under the confederation. And re&s;orting to that &s;tand|ard, there can be no doubt, that the rights of a&s;&s;ignees and original holders, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as equal.</P>
<P>In exploding thus fully the principle of di&s;crimination, the Secretary is happy in reflecting, that he is the only advocate of what has been already &s;anctioned by the formal and expre&s;s autho|rity of the government of the Union, in the&s;e emphatic terms&mdash;"The remaining cla&s;s of credi|tors (&s;ay Congre&s;s in their circular addre&s;s to the &s;tates, of the 26th of April 1783) is compo&s;|ed, partly of &s;uch of our fellow-citizens as originally lent to the public the u&s;e of their funds, or have &s;ince manife&s;ted <HI>mo&s;t confidence</HI> in their country, by receiving transfers from the lenders; and partly of tho&s;e, who&s;e property has been either advanced or a&s;&s;umed for the public &s;ervice. To <HI>di&s;criminate</HI> the merits of the&s;e &s;everal de&s;criptions of creditors, would be a ta&s;k equally unnece&s;|&s;ary and invidious. If the voice of humanity plead more loudly in favor of &s;ome than of others, the voice of policy, no le&s;s than of ju&s;tice, pleads in favor of all. A WISE NATION will never permit tho&s;e who relieve the wants of their country, or who <HI>rely mo&s;t</HI> on its <HI>faith,</HI> its <HI>firmne&s;s,</HI> and its <HI>re&s;ources,</HI> when either of them is di&s;tru&s;ted, to &s;uffer by the event."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="022998_0007_0FBAD384B225B138">The Secretary concluding, that a di&s;crimination, between the different cla&s;&s;es of creditors of the United States, cannot with propriety be <HI>made,</HI> proceeds to examine whether a difference ought to be permitted to <HI>remain</HI> between them, and another de&s;cription of public creditors&mdash;Tho&s;e of the &s;tates individually.</P>
<P>The Secretary, after mature reflection on this point, entertains a full convicton, that an a&s;&s;ump|tion of the debts of the particular &s;tates by the union, and a like provi&s;ion for them, as for tho&s;e of the union, will be a mea&s;ure of &s;ound policy and &s;ub&s;tantial ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>It would, in the opinion of the Secretary, contribute, in an eminent degree, to an orderly, &s;ta|ble and &s;atisfactory arrangement of the national finances.</P>
<P>Admitting, as ought to be the ca&s;e, that a provi&s;ion mu&s;t be made in &s;ome way or other, for the entire debt; it will follow, that no greater revenues will be required, whether that provi&s;ion be made wholly by the United States, or partly by them, and partly by the &s;tates &s;eparately.</P>
<P>The principal que&s;tion then mu&s;t be, whether &s;uch a provi&s;ion c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nnot be more conveniently and effectually made, by one general plan i&s;&s;uing from one authority, than by different plans originating in different authorities.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t ca&s;e there can be no competition for re&s;ources; in the la&s;t, there mu&s;t be &s;uch a com|petition. The con&s;equences of this, without the greate&s;t caution on both &s;ides, might be inter|fering regulations, and thence colli&s;ion and confu&s;ion. Particular branches of indu&s;try might al&s;o be oppre&s;&s;ed by it. The mo&s;t productive objects of revenue are not numerous. Either the&s;e mu&s;t be wholly engro&s;&s;ed by one &s;ide, which might le&s;&s;en the efficacy of the provi&s;ions by the other; or both mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the &s;ame objects in different modes, which might occa&s;ion an accumulation upon them, beyond what they could properly bear. If this &s;hould not happen, the caution requi&s;ite to avoiding it, would prevent the revenue's deriving the full benefit of each object. The danger of interference and of exce&s;s would be apt to impo&s;e re&s;traints very un|friendly to the complete command of tho&s;e re&s;ources, which are the mo&s;t convenient; and to compel the having recour&s;e to others, le&s;s eligible in them&s;elves, and le&s;s agreeable to the commu|nity.</P>
<P>The difficulty of an effectual command of the public re&s;ources, in ca&s;e of &s;eparate provi&s;ions for the debt, may be &s;een in another and perhaps more &s;triking light. It would naturally happen that different &s;tates, from local con&s;iderations, would in &s;ome in&s;tances have recour&s;e to different objects, in others, to the &s;ame objects, in different degrees, for procuring the funds of which they &s;tood in need. It is ea&s;y to conceive how this diver&s;ity would affect the aggregate revenue of the country. By the &s;uppo&s;ition, articles which yielded a full &s;upply in &s;ome &s;tates, would yield nothing, or an in&s;ufficient product, in others. And hence the public revenue would not de|rive the full benefit of tho&s;e articles, from &s;tate regulations. Neither could the deficiencies be made good by tho&s;e of the union. It is a provi&s;ion of the national con&s;titution, that "all duties, impo&s;ts and exci&s;es, &s;hall be uniform throughout the United States." And as the general go|vernment would be under a nece&s;&s;ity from motives of policy, of paying regard to the duty, which may have been previou&s;ly impo&s;ed upon any article, though but in a &s;ingle &s;tate, it would be con|&s;trained, either to refrain wholly from any further impo&s;ition, upon &s;uch article, where it had been already rated as high as was proper, or to confine it&s;elf to the difference between the exi&s;ting rate, and what the article would rea&s;onably bear. Thus the pre-occupancy of an article by a &s;ingle &s;tate, would tend to arre&s;t or abridge the impo&s;ition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the union on that article. And as it is &s;uppo&s;eable, that a great variety of articles might be placed in this &s;ituation, by di&s;&s;imilar arrange|ments of the particular &s;tates, it is evident, that the aggregate revenue of the country would be likely to be very materially contracted by the plan of &s;eparate provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>If all the public creditors receive their dues from one &s;ource, di&s;tributed with an equal hand, their intere&s;t will be the &s;ame. And having the &s;ame intere&s;ts, they will unite in the &s;upport of the fi&s;cal arrangements of the government: As the&s;e, too, can be made with more convenience, where there is no competition: The&s;e circum&s;tances combined will in&s;ure to the revenue laws a more ready and more &s;atisfactory execution.</P>
<P>If on the contrary there are di&s;tinct provi&s;ions, there will be di&s;tinct intere&s;ts, drawing different ways. That union and concert of views, among the creditors, which in every government is of great importance to their &s;ecurity, and to that of public credit, will not only not exi&s;t, but will be likely to give place to mutual jealou&s;y and oppo&s;ition. And from this cau&s;e, the operation of the &s;y&s;tems which may be adopted, both by the particular &s;tates, and by the union, with relation to their re&s;pective debts, will be in danger of being counteracted.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal rea&s;ons, which render it probable, that the &s;ituation of the &s;tate creditors would be wor&s;e, than that of the creditors of the union, if there be not a national a&s;&s;umption of the &s;tate debts. Of the&s;e it will be &s;ufficient to mention two; one, that a principal branch of reve|nue is exclu&s;ively ve&s;ted in the union; the other, that a &s;tate mu&s;t always be checked in the im|po&s;ition of taxes on articles of con&s;umption, from the want of power to extend the &s;ame regulation to the other &s;tates, and from the tendency of partial duties to injure its indu&s;try and commerce. Should the &s;tate creditors &s;tand upon a le&s;s eligible footing than the others, it is unnatural to ex|pect
<PB N="9" REF="022998_0008_0FBAD3862F4CC3C0">
they would &s;ee with plea&s;ure a provi&s;ion for them. The influence which their di&s;&s;atisfaction might have, could not but operate injuriou&s;ly, both for the creditors, and the credit, of the United States.</P>
<P>Hence it is even the intere&s;t of the creditors of the union, that tho&s;e of the individual &s;tates &s;hould be comprehended in a general provi&s;ion. Any attempt to &s;ecure to the former either exclu&s;ive or peculiar advantages, would materially hazard their intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Neither would it be ju&s;t, that one cla&s;s of the public creditors &s;hould be more favoured than the other. The objects for which both de&s;criptions of the debt were contracted, are in the main the &s;ame. Indeed a great part of the particular debts of the States has ari&s;en from a&s;&s;umptions by them on account of the union. And it is mo&s;t equitable, that there &s;hould be the &s;ame mea&s;ure of retri|bution for all.</P>
<P>There is an objection, however, to an a&s;&s;umption of the &s;tate debts, which de&s;erves particular no|tice. It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that it would increa&s;e the difficulty of an equitable &s;ettlement between them and the United States.</P>
<P>The principles of that &s;ettlement, whenever they &s;hall be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, will require all the modera|tion and wi&s;dom of the government. In the opinion of the Secre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ry, that di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, till further lights are obtained, would be premature.</P>
<P>All therefore which he would now think advi&s;eable on the point in que&s;tion, would be, that the amount of the debts a&s;&s;umed and provided for, &s;hould be charged to the re&s;pective &s;tates, to abide an eventual arrangement. This, the United States, as a&s;&s;ignees to the creditors, would have an indi&s;putable right to do.</P>
<P>But as it might be a &s;atisfaction to the Hou&s;e to have before them &s;ome plan for the liquidation of accounts between the union and its members, which, including the a&s;&s;umption of the &s;tate debts, would con&s;i&s;t with equity: The Secretary will &s;ubmit in this place &s;uch thoughts on the &s;ubject, as have occurred to his own mind, or been &s;ugge&s;ted to him, mo&s;t compatible, in his judgment, with the end propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Let each &s;tate be charged with all the money advanced to it out of the trea&s;ury of the United States, liquidated according to the &s;pecie value, at the time of each advance, with intere&s;t at &s;ix per cent.</P>
<P>Let it al&s;o be charged with the amount, in &s;pecie value, of all its &s;ecurities which &s;hall be a&s;&s;u|med, with the intere&s;t upon them to the time, when intere&s;t &s;hall become payable by the United States.</P>
<P>Let it be credited for all monies paid and articles furni&s;hed to the United States, and for all o|ther expenditures during the war, either towards general or particular defence, whether authori|zed or unauthorized by the United States; the whole liquidated to &s;pecie value, and bearing an intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. from the &s;everal times at which the &s;everal payments, advances and ex|penditures accrued.</P>
<P>And let all &s;ums of continental money now in the trea&s;uries of the re&s;pective &s;tates, which &s;hall be paid into the trea&s;ury of the United States, be credited at &s;pecie value.</P>
<P>Upon a &s;tatement of the accounts according to the&s;e principles, there can be little doubt, that balances would appear in favor of all the &s;tates, again&s;t the United States.</P>
<P>To equalize the contributions of the &s;tates, let each be then charged with its proportion of the aggregate of tho&s;e balances, according to &s;ome equitable ratio, to be devi&s;ed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>If the contributions &s;hould be found di&s;proportionate, the re&s;ult of this adju&s;tment would be, that &s;ome &s;tates would be creditors, &s;ome debtors to the union.</P>
<P>Should this be the ca&s;e, at it will be attended with le&s;s inconvenience for the United States, to have to pay balances to, than to receive them from the particular &s;tates, it may perhaps, be prac|ticable to effect the former by a &s;econd proce&s;s, in the nature of a transfer of the amount of the debts of debtor &s;tates, to the credit of creditor &s;tates, ob&s;erving the ratio by which the fir&s;t ap|portionment &s;hall have been made. This, whil&s;t it would de&s;troy the balances due from the for|mer, would increa&s;e tho&s;e due to the latter. The&s;e to be provided for by the United States, at a rea&s;onable intere&s;t, but not to be transferable.</P>
<P>The expediency of this &s;econd proce&s;s mu&s;t depend on a knowledge of the re&s;ult of the fir&s;t. If the inequalities &s;hould be too great, the arrangement may be impracticable, without unduly in|crea&s;ing the debt of the United States. But it is not likely, that this would be the ca&s;e. It is al&s;o to be remarked, that though this &s;econd proce&s;s might not, upon the principle of apportionment, bring the thing to the point aimed at, yet it may approach &s;o nearly to it, as to avoid e&s;&s;entially the embarra&s;&s;ment, of having con&s;iderable balances to collect from any of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>The whole of this arrangement to be under the &s;uperintendence of commi&s;&s;ioners, ve&s;ted with equitable di&s;cretion, and final authority.</P>
<P>The operation of the plan is exemplified in the &s;chedule A.</P>
<P>The general principle of it &s;eems to be equitable, for it appears difficult to conceive a good rea|&s;on, why the expences for the particular defence of a part in a common war, &s;hould not be a com|mon
<PB N="10" REF="022998_0009_0FBAD387AB96FB38">
charge, as well as tho&s;e incurred profe&s;&s;edly for the general defence. The defence of each part is that of the whole; and unle&s;s all the expenditures are brought into a common ma&s;s, the tendency mu&s;t be, to add, to the calamities &s;uffered, by being the mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the ravages of war, an increa&s;e of burthens.</P>
<P>This plan &s;eems to be &s;u&s;ceptible of no objection, which does not belong to every other, that proceeds on the idea of a final adju&s;tment of accounts. The difficulty of &s;ettling a ratio, is com|mon to all. This mu&s;t, probably, either be &s;ought for in the proportions of the requi&s;itions, du|ring the war, or in the deci&s;ion of commi&s;&s;ioners appointed with plenary power. The rule pre|&s;cribed in the Con&s;titution, with regard to repre&s;entation and direct taxes, would evidently not be applicable to the &s;ituation of parties, during the period in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The exi&s;ting debt of the United States is excluded from the computation, as it ought to be, be|cau&s;e it will be provided for out of a general fund.</P>
<P>The only di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of a preliminary kind, which remains, relates to the di&s;tinctions of the debt into principal and intere&s;t. It is well known, that the arrears of the latter bear a large proportion to the amount of the former. The immediate payment of the&s;e arrears is evidently impracticable, and a que&s;tion ari&s;es, what ought to be done with them?</P>
<P>There is good rea&s;on to conclude, that the impre&s;&s;ions of many are more favorable to the claim of the principal than to that of the intere&s;t; at lea&s;t &s;o far, as to produce an opinion, that an in|ferior provi&s;ion might &s;uffice for the latter.</P>
<P>But to the Secretary, this opinion does not appear to be well founded. His inve&s;tigations of the &s;ubject, have led him to a conclu&s;ion, that the arrears of intere&s;t have preten&s;ions, at lea&s;t equal to the principal.</P>
<P>The liquidated debt, traced to its origin, falls under two principal di&s;criminations. One, re|lating to loans; the other to &s;ervices performed and articles &s;upplied.</P>
<P>The part ari&s;ing from loans, was at fir&s;t made payable at fixed periods, which have long &s;ince elap&s;ed, with an early option to lenders, either to receive back their money at the expiration of tho&s;e periods, or to continue it at intere&s;t, 'till the whole amount of continental bills circulating &s;hould not exceed the &s;um in circulation at the time of each loan. This contingency, in the &s;en&s;e of the contract, never happened; and the pre&s;umption is, that the creditors preferred continuing their money indefinitely at intere&s;t, to receiving it in a depreciated and depreciating &s;tate.</P>
<P>The other parts of it were chiefly for objects, which ought to have been paid for at the time, that is, when the &s;ervices were performed or the &s;upplies furni&s;hed; and were not accompanied with any contract for intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But by different acts of government and admini&s;tration, concurred in by the creditors, the&s;e parts of the debt have been converted into a capital, bearing an intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. per annum, but without any definite period of redemption. A portion of the loan-office debt has been ex|changed for new &s;ecurities of that import. And the whole of it &s;eems to have acquired that cha|racter, after the expiration of the periods prefixed for re-payment.</P>
<P>If this view of the &s;ubject be a ju&s;t one, the capital of the debt of the United States, may be con&s;idered in the light of an annuity at the rate of &s;ix per cent. per annum, redeemable at the plea&s;ure of the government, by payment of the principal. For it &s;eems to be a clear po&s;ition, that when a public contracts a debt payable with intere&s;t, without any preci&s;e time being &s;tipulated or under&s;tood for payment of the capital, that time is a matter of pure di&s;cretion with the government, which is at liberty to con&s;ult its own convenience re&s;pecting it, taking care to pay the intere&s;t with punctuality.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as long as the United States &s;hould pay the intere&s;t of their debt, as it accrued, their creditors would have no right to demand the principal.</P>
<P>But with regard to the arrear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of intere&s;t, the ca&s;e is different. The&s;e are now due, and tho&s;e to whom they are due, have a right to claim immediate payment. To &s;ay, that it would be impractica|ble to comply, would not vary the nature of the right. Nor can this idea of impracticability be honor+ably carried further, than to ju&s;tify the propo&s;ition of a new contract upon the ba&s;is of a commutation of that right for an equivalent. This equivalent too ought to be a real and fair one. And what other fair equivalent can be imagined for the detention of money, but a rea&s;onable intere&s;t? Or what can be the &s;tandard of that intere&s;t, but the market rate, or the rate which the government pays in ordinary ca&s;es?</P>
<P>From this view of the matter, which appears to be the accurate and true one, it will follow, that the arrears of intere&s;t are entitled to an equal provi&s;ion with the principal of the debt.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the foregoing di&s;cu&s;&s;ions is this&mdash;That there ought to be no di&s;crimination between the original holders of the debt, and pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors by purcha&s;e&mdash;That it is expedient, there &s;hould be an a&s;&s;umption of the &s;tate debts by the Union, and that the arrears of intere&s;t &s;hould be provided for on an equal footing with the principal.</P>

<P>The intere&s;ting problem now occurs. Is it in the power of the United States, con&s;i&s;tently with tho&s;e prudential con&s;iderations, which ought not to be overlooked, to make a provi&s;ion equal to the purpo&s;e of funding the whole debt, at the rates of intere&s;t which it now bears, in addition to the &s;um which will be nece&s;&s;ary for the current &s;ervice of the government?</P>
<P>The Secretary will not &s;ay that &s;uch a provi&s;ion would exceed the abilities of the country; but he is clearly of opinion, that to make it, would require the exten&s;ion of taxation to a degree, and to objects, which the true intere&s;t of the public creditors forbids. It is therefore to be hoped, and even to be expected, that they will chearfully concur in &s;uch modifications of their claims, on fair and equitable principles, as will facilitate to the government an arrangement &s;ub&s;tantial, durable and &s;atisfactory to the community. The importance of the la&s;t characteri&s;tic will &s;trike every di&s;cerning mind. No plan, however flattering in appearance, to which it did not belong, could be truly entitled to confidence.</P>
<P>It will not be forgotten, that exigencies may, ere long, ari&s;e, which would call for re&s;ources greatly beyond what is now deemed &s;ufficient for the current &s;ervice; and that, &s;hould the facul|ties of the country be exhau&s;ted or even <HI>&s;trained</HI> to provide for the public debt, there could be le&s;s reliance on the &s;acredne&s;s of the provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>But while the Secretary yields to the force of the&s;e con&s;iderations, he does not lo&s;e &s;ight of tho&s;e fundamental principles of good faith, which dictate, that every practicable exertion ought to be made, &s;crupulou&s;ly to fulfil the engagements of the government; that no change in the rights of its creditors ought to be attempted without their voluntary con&s;ent; and that this con&s;ent ought to be voluntary in fact, as well as in name. Con&s;equently, that every propo&s;al of a change ought to be in the &s;hape of an appeal to their rea&s;on and to their intere&s;t; not to their nece&s;&s;ities. To this end it is requi&s;ite, that a fair equivalent &s;hould be offered for what may be a&s;ked to be given up, and unque&s;tionable &s;ecurity for the remainder. Without this, an alteration, con&s;i&s;tently with the credit and honor of the nation, would be impracticable.</P>
<P>It remains to &s;ee, what can be propo&s;ed in conformity to the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iews.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="022998_0011_0FBAD38B1A8B5190" MS="y">It has been remarked, that the capital of the debt of the union is to be viewed in the light of an annuity at the rate of &s;ix per cent. per annum, redeemable at the plea&s;ure of the government, by payment of the principal. And it will not be required, that the arrears of intere&s;t &s;hould be con|&s;idered in a more favourable light. The &s;ame character, in general, may be applied to the debts of the individual &s;tates.</P>
<P>This view of the &s;ubject <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dmits, that the United States would have it in their power to avail them&s;elves of any fall in the market rate of intere&s;t, for reducing that of the debt.</P>
<P>This property of the debt is favourable to the public; unfavourable to the creditor. And may facilitate an arrangement for the reduction of intere&s;t, upon the ba&s;is of a fair equivalent.</P>
<P>Probabilities are always a rational ground of contract. The Secretary conceives, that there is good rea&s;on to believe, if effectual mea&s;ures are taken to e&s;tabli&s;h public credit, that the govern|ment rate of intere&s;t in the United States, will, in a very &s;hort time, fall at lea&s;t as low as five per cent. and that in a period not exceeding twenty years, it will &s;ink &s;till lower, probably to four.</P>
<P>There are two principal cau&s;es which will be likely to produce this effect; one, the low rate of intere&s;t in Europe; the other, the increa&s;e of the monied capital of the nation, by the funding of the public debt.</P>
<P>From three to four per cent. is deemed good intere&s;t in &s;everal parts of Europe. Even le&s;s is deemed &s;o, in &s;ome places. And it is on the decline; the increa&s;ing plenty of money continually tending to lower it. It is pre&s;umable, that no country will be able to borrow of foreigners upon better terms, than the United States, becau&s;e none can, perhaps, afford &s;o good &s;ecurity. Our &s;ituation expo&s;es us le&s;s, than that of any other nation, to tho&s;e ca&s;ualties, which are the chief cau&s;es of expence; our incumbrances, in proportion to our real means, are le&s;s, though the&s;e can|not immediately be brought &s;o readily into action, and our progre&s;s in re&s;ources from the early &s;tate of the country, and the immen&s;e tracts of un&s;ettled territory, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily exceed that of any other. The advantages of this &s;ituation have already engaged the attention of the European money-lenders, particularly among the Dutch. And as they become better under&s;tood, they will have the greater influence. Hence as large a proportion of the ca&s;h of Europe as may be wanted, will be, in a certain &s;en&s;e, in our market, for the u&s;e of government. And this will naturally have the effect of a reduction of the rate of intere&s;t, not indeed to the level of the places, which &s;end their money to market, but to &s;omething much nearer to it, than our pre&s;ent rate.</P>
<P>The influence, which the funding of the debt is calculated to have, in lowering intere&s;t, has been already remarked and explained. It is hardly po&s;&s;ible, that it &s;hould not be materially affected by &s;uch an increa&s;e of the monied capital of the nation, as would re&s;ult from the proper funding of &s;eventy millions of dollars. But the probability of a decrea&s;e in the rate of intere&s;t, acquires con|firmation from facts, which exi&s;ted prior to the revolution. It is well known, that in &s;ome of the &s;tates, money might with facility be borrowed, on good &s;ecurity, at five per cent. and, not unfre|quently, even at le&s;s.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t enlightened of the public creditors will be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the ju&s;tne&s;s of this view of the &s;ubject, and of the propriety of the u&s;e which will be made of it.</P>
<P>The Secretary, in pur&s;uance of it, will a&s;&s;ume, as a probability, &s;ufficiently great to be a ground of calculation, both on the part of the government and of its creditors&mdash;That the intere&s;t of money in the United States will, in five years, fall to five per cent. and, in twenty, to four. The probability, in the mind of the Secretary, is rather that the fall may be more rapid and more con&s;iderable; but he prefers a mean, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t likely to engage the a&s;&s;ent of the creditors, and more equitable in it&s;elf; becau&s;e it is predicated on probabilities, which may err on one &s;ide, as well as on the other.</P>
<P>Premi&s;ing the&s;e things, the Secretary &s;ubmits to the Hou&s;e, the expediency of propo&s;ing a loan to the full amount of the debt, as well of the particular &s;tates, as of the union, upon the following terms.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t&mdash;That for every hundred dollars &s;ub&s;cribed, payable in the debt (as well intere&s;t as prin|cipal) the &s;ub&s;criber be entitled, at his option, either</P>
<P>To have two thirds funded at an annuity, or yearly intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent, redeemable at the plea&s;ure of the government, by payment of the principal; and to receive the other third in lands in the We&s;tern Territory, at the rate of twenty cents per acre. Or,</P>
<P>To have the whole &s;um funded at an annuity or yearly intere&s;t of four per cent. irredeemable by any payment exceeding five dollars per annum on account both of principal and intere&s;t; and to receive, as a compen&s;ation for the reduction of intere&s;t, fifteen dollars and eighty cents, payable in lands, as in the preceding ca&s;e. Or</P>
<P>To have &s;ixty-&s;ix dollars and two thirds of a dollar funded immediately at an annuity or yearly intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. irredeemable by any payment exceeding four dollars and two thirds of a dollar per annum, on account both of principal and intere&s;t; and to have, at the end of ten years, twenty-&s;ix dollars and eighty-eight cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, funded at the like intere&s;t and rate of redemption. Or</P>
<P>To have an annuity for the remainder of life, upon the contingency of living to a given age, not le&s;s di&s;tant than ten years, computing intere&s;t at four per cent. Or</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="022998_0012_0FBAD38CC0701B38" MS="y">To have an annuity for the remainder of life, upon the contingency of the &s;urvivor&s;hip of the younge&s;t of two per&s;ons, computing intere&s;t, in this ca&s;e al&s;o, at four per cent.</P>
<P>In addition to the foregoing loan, payable wholly in the debt, the Secretary would propo&s;e, that one &s;hould be opened for ten millions of dollars, on the following plan.</P>
<P>That for every hundred dollars &s;ub&s;cribed, payable one half in &s;pecie, and the other half in debt (as well principal as intere&s;t) the &s;ub&s;criber be entitled to an annuity or yearly intere&s;t of five per cent. irredeemable by any payment exceeding &s;ix dollars per annum, on account both of principal and intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The principles and operation of the&s;e different plans may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w require explanation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is &s;imply a propo&s;ition for paying one third of the debt in land, and funding the other two thirds, at the exi&s;ting rate of intere&s;t, and upon the &s;ame terms of redemption, to which it is at pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Here is no conjecture, no calculation of probabilities. The creditor is offered the advantage of making his intere&s;t principal, and he is a&s;ked to facilitate to the government an effectual provi&s;ion for his demands; by accepting a third part of them in land, at a fair valuation.</P>
<P>The general price, at which the we&s;tern lands have been, heretofore, &s;old, has been a dollar per acre in public &s;ecurities; but at the time the principal purcha&s;es were made, the&s;e &s;ecurities were worth, in the market, le&s;s than three &s;hillings in the pound. The nominal price, therefore, would not be the proper &s;tandard, under pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, nor would the preci&s;e &s;pecie value then given, be a ju&s;t rule. Becau&s;e, as the payments were to be made by in&s;talments, and the &s;ecu|rities were, at the times of the purcha&s;es, extremely low, the probability of a moderate ri&s;e mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to have been taken into the account. Twenty cents, therefore, &s;eem to bear an equitable proportion to the two con&s;iderations of value at the time, and likelihood of increa&s;e.</P>
<P>It will be under&s;tood, that upon this plan, the public retains the advantage of availing it&s;elf of any fall in the market rate of intere&s;t, for reducing that upon the debt, which is perfectly ju&s;t, as no pre&s;ent &s;acrifice, either in the quantum of the principal, or in the rate of intere&s;t, is requi|red from the creditor.</P>
<P>The inducement to the mea&s;ure is, the payment of one third of the debt in land.</P>
<P>The &s;econd plan is grounded upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that intere&s;t, in five years, will fall to five per cent. in fifteen more, to four. As the capital remains entire, but bearing an intere&s;t of four per cent. only, compen&s;ation is to be made to the creditor, for the intere&s;t of two per cent. per annum for five years, and of one per cent. per annum, for fifteen years, to commence at the di&s;|tance of five years. The pre&s;ent value of the&s;e two &s;ums or annuities, computed according to the terms of the &s;uppo&s;ition, is, by &s;trict calculation, fifteen dollars and &s;even hundred and ninety-two thou&s;andth parts of a dollar; a fraction le&s;s than the &s;um propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The inducement to the mea&s;ure here is, the reduction of intere&s;t to a rate, more within the compa&s;s of a convenient provi&s;ion; and the payment of the compen&s;ation in lands.</P>
<P>The inducements to the individual are&mdash;the accommodation afforded to the public&mdash;the high probability of a complete equivalent&mdash;the chance even of gain, &s;hould the rate of intere&s;t fall, either more &s;peedily or in a greater degree, than the calculation &s;uppo&s;es. Should it fall to five per cent. &s;ooner than five years; &s;hould it fall lower than five before the additional fifteen were expired; or &s;hould it fall below four, previous to the payment of the debt, there would be, in each ca&s;e, an ab&s;olute profit to the creditor. As his capital will remain entire, the value of it will increa&s;e, with every decrea&s;e of the rate of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The third plan proceeds upon the like &s;uppo&s;ition of a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive fall in the rate of intere&s;t. And upon that &s;uppo&s;ition offers an equivalent to the creditor. One hundred dollars, bearing an in|tere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. for five years; of five per cent. for fifteen years, and thenceforth of four per cent. (the&s;e being the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive rates of intere&s;t in the market) is equal to a capital of 122 dollars, 510725 parts, bearing an intere&s;t of four per cent. which, converted into a capital, bearing a fixed rate of intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent, is equal to 81 dollars, 6738166 parts.</P>
<P>The difference between &s;ixty-&s;ix dollars and two thirds of a dollar (the &s;um to be funded imme|diately) and this la&s;t &s;um is 15 dollars, 0172 parts, which at &s;ix per cent per annum, amounts at the end of ten years, to 26 dollars, 8755 parts, the &s;um to be funded at the expiration of that period.</P>
<P>It ought, however, to be acknowledged, that this calculation does not make allowance for the principle of redemption, which the plan it&s;elf includes; upon which principle the equiva|lent in a capital of &s;ix per cent. would be by &s;trict calculation, 87 dollars, 50766 parts.</P>
<P>But there are two con&s;iderations which induce the Secretary to think, that the one propo&s;ed would operate more equitably than this: One is, that it may not be very early in the power of the United States to avail them&s;elves of the right of redemption re&s;erved in the plan: The other is, that with regard to the part to be funded at the end of ten years, the principle of redemption is &s;u&s;pended during that time, and the full intere&s;t at &s;ix per cent. goes on <HI>improving</HI> at the <HI>&s;am
<PB N="14" REF="022998_0013_0FBAD38F57310300" MS="y">
rate;</HI> which for the <HI>la&s;t five years</HI> will exceed the market rate of intere&s;t, according to the &s;up|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The equivalent is regulated in this plan, by the circum&s;tance of fixing the rate of intere&s;t higher, than it is &s;uppo&s;ed it will continue to be in the market; permitting only a gradual di&s;|charge of the debt, in an e&s;tabli&s;hed proportion, and con&s;equently preventing advantage being taken of any decrea&s;e of intere&s;t below the &s;tipulated rate.</P>
<P>Thus the true value of eighty-one dollars and &s;ixty-&s;even cents, the capital propo&s;ed, con&s;ider|ed as a perpetuity, and bearing &s;ix per cent. intere&s;t, when the market rate of intere&s;t was five per cent. would be a &s;mall fraction more than ninety-eight dollars, when it was four per cent. would be one hundred and twenty-two dollars and fifty-one cents. But the propo&s;ed capital being &s;ubject to gradual redemption, it is evident, that its value, in each ca&s;e, would be &s;omewhat le&s;s. Yet from this may be perceived, the manner in which a le&s;s capital at a fixed rate of intere&s;t, becomes an equivalent for a greater capital, at a rate liable to variation and diminution.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umable, that tho&s;e creditors, who do not entertain a favorable opinion of property in we&s;tern lands, will give a preference to this la&s;t mode of modelling the debt. The Secretary is &s;incere in affirming, that, in his opinion, it will be likely to prove, <HI>to the full</HI> as beneficial to the creditors, as a provi&s;ion for his debt upon its pre&s;ent terms.</P>
<P>It is not intended, in either ca&s;e to oblige the government to redeem, in the proportion &s;pecified, but to &s;ecure to it, the right of doing &s;o, to avoid the inconvenience of a perpetuity.</P>
<P>The fourth and fifth plans abandon the &s;uppo&s;ition which is the ba&s;is of the two preceding ones, and offer only four per cent. throughout.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of this is, that the payment being deferred, there will be an accumulation of com|pound intere&s;t, in the intermediate period again&s;t the public, which, without a very provident admini&s;tration, would turn to its detriment. And the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the burthen would be too apt to beget a relaxation of efforts in the mean time. The mea&s;ure therefore, its object being temporary accommodation, could only be advi&s;eable upon a moderate rate of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>With regard to individuals, the inducement will be &s;ufficient at four per cent. There is no di&s;po&s;ition of money, in private loans, making allowance for the u&s;ual delays and ca&s;ualties, which would be equally beneficial as a future provi&s;ion.</P>

<P>It will have appeared, that in all the propo&s;ed loans, the Secretary has contemplated the putting the intere&s;t upon the &s;ame footing with the principal: <HI>That</HI> on the debt of the United States, he would have computed to the la&s;t of the pre&s;ent year: <HI>That</HI> on the debt of the particular &s;tates, to the la&s;t of the year 1791; the rea&s;on for which di&s;tinction will be &s;een hereafter.</P>
<P>In order to keep up a due circulation of money, it will be expedient, that the intere&s;t of the debt &s;hould be paid quarter-yearly. This regulation will, at the &s;ame time, conduce to the advantage of the public creditors, giving them, in fact, by the anticipation of payment, a higher rate of in|tere&s;t; which may, with propriety, be taken into the e&s;timate of the compen&s;ation to be made to them. Six per cent. per annum, paid in this mode, will truly be worth &s;ix dollars, and one hundred and thirty-five thou&s;andth parts of a dollar, computing the market intere&s;t at the &s;ame rate.</P>
<P>The Secretary thinks it advi&s;able, to hold out various propo&s;itions, all of them compatible with the public intere&s;t, becau&s;e it is, in his opinion, of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, that the debt &s;hould, with the con&s;ent of the creditors, be remoulded into &s;uch a &s;hape, as will bring the expenditure of the nation to a level with its income. 'Till this &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, the finances of the United States will never wear a proper countenance. Arrears of intere&s;t, continually accruing, will be as continual a monument, either of inability, or of ill faith; and will not cea&s;e to have an evil influence on public credit. In nothing are appearances of greater moment, than in whatever re|gards credit. Opinion is the &s;oul of it, and this is affected by appearances, as well as realities. By offering an option to the creditors, between a number of plans, the change medi|tated will be more likely to be accompli&s;hed. Different tempers will be governed by different views of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But while the Secretary would endeavour to effect a change in the form of the debt, by new loans, in order to render it more &s;u&s;ceptible of an adequate provi&s;ion; he would not think it proper to aim at procuring the concurrence of the creditors by operating upon their nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>Hence whatever &s;urplus of revenue might remain, after &s;atisfying the intere&s;t of the new loans, and the demand for the current &s;ervice, ought to be divided among tho&s;e creditors, if any, who may not think fit to &s;ub&s;cribe to them. But for this purpo&s;e, under the circum&s;tance of depending propo&s;itions, a temporary appropriation will be mo&s;t advi&s;eable, and the &s;um mu&s;t be limited to four per cent. as the revenues will only be calculated to produce, in that propor|tion, to the entire debt.</P>
<P>The Secretary confides for the &s;ucce&s;s of the propo&s;itions, to be made, on the goodne&s;s of the rea&s;ons upon which they re&s;t; on the fairne&s;s of the equivalent to be offered in each ca&s;e; on the di&s;cernment of the creditors of their true intere&s;t; and on their di&s;po&s;ition to facilitate the ar|rangements of the government, and to render them &s;atisfactory to the community.</P>
<P>The remaining part of the ta&s;k to be performed is, to take a view of the means of providing for the debt, according to the modification of it, which is propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>On this point the Secretary premi&s;es, that, in his opinion, the funds to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, ought, for the pre&s;ent, to be confined to the exi&s;ting debt of the United States; as well, becau&s;e a pro|gre&s;&s;ive augmentation of the revenue will be mo&s;t convenient, as becau&s;e the con&s;ent of the &s;tate creditors is nece&s;&s;ary, to the a&s;&s;umption contemplated; and though the obtaining of that con|&s;ent may be inferred with great a&s;&s;urance, from their obvious intere&s;t to give it; yet 'till it &s;hall be obtained, an actual provi&s;ion for the debt, would be premature. Taxes could not, with propri|ety, be laid for an object, which depended on &s;uch a contingency.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="022998_0015_0FBAD393AC07F900">All that ought now to be done, re&s;pecting it, is, to put the matter in an effectual train for a future provi&s;ion. For which purpo&s;e, the Secretary will, in the cour&s;e of this report, &s;ubmit &s;uch propo&s;itions, as appear to him advi&s;eable.</P>
<P>The Secretary now proceeds to a con&s;ideration of the nece&s;&s;ary funds.</P>
<P>It has been &s;tated that the debt of the United States con&s;i&s;ts of

<P>Thus to pay the intere&s;t of the foreign debt, and to pay four per cent on the whole of the do|me&s;tic debt, principal and intere&s;t, forming a new capital, will require a yearly income of 2,239,163 dollars, 9 cents.</P>
<P>The &s;um which, in the opinion of the Secretary, ought now to be provided in addition to what the current &s;ervice will require.</P>
<P>For, though the rate of intere&s;t, propo&s;ed by the third plan, exceeds four per cent. on the whole debt, and the annuities on the tontine will al&s;o exceed four per cent. on the &s;ums which may be &s;ub&s;cribed; yet, as the actual provi&s;ion for a part is, in the former ca&s;e, &s;u&s;pended; as mea&s;ures for reducing the debt, by purcha&s;es, may be advantageou&s;ly pur&s;ued, and as the pay|ment of the deferred annuities will of cour&s;e be po&s;tponed, four per cent. on the whole, will be a &s;ufficient provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>With regard to the in&s;talments of the foreign debt, the&s;e, in the opinion of the Secretary, ought to be paid by new loans abroad. Could funds be conveniently &s;pared, from other exigencies, for paying them, the United States could ill bear the drain of ca&s;h, at the pre&s;ent juncture, which the mea&s;ure would be likely to occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But to the &s;um which has been &s;tated for payment of the intere&s;t, mu&s;t be added a provi&s;ion for the current &s;ervice. This the Secretary e&s;timates at &s;ix hundred thou&s;and dollars; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Schedule <HI>I.</HI></NOTE> making, with the amount of the intere&s;t, two millions, eight hundred and thirty-nine thou&s;and, one hun|dred and &s;ixty-three dollars, and nine cents.</P>
<P>This &s;um may, in the opinion of the Secretary, be obtained from the pre&s;ent duties on im|ports and tonnage, with the additions, which, without any po&s;&s;ible di&s;advantage either to trade, or agriculture, may be made on wines, &s;pirits, including tho&s;e di&s;tilled within the United States, teas and coffee.</P>
<P>The Secretary conceives, that it will be &s;ound policy, to carry the duties upon articles of this kind, as high as will be con&s;i&s;tent with the practicability of a &s;afe collection. This will le&s;&s;en the nece&s;&s;ity, both of having recour&s;e to direct taxation, and of accumulating duties where they would be more inconvenient to trade, and upon objects, which are more to be regarded as nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>That the articles which have been enumerated, will, better than mo&s;t others, bear high duties, can hardly be a que&s;tion. They are all of them, in reality&mdash;luxuries&mdash;the greate&s;t part of them foreign luxuries; &s;ome of them, in the exce&s;s in which they are u&s;ed, pernicious luxuries. And there is, perhaps, none of them, which is not con&s;umed in &s;o great abundance, as may, ju&s;tly, denominate it, a &s;ource of national extravagance and impoveri&s;hment. The con&s;umption of ardent &s;pirits particularly, no doubt very much on account of their cheapne&s;s, is carried to an extreme, which is truly to be regretted, as well in regard to the health and the morals, as to the oeconomy of the community.</P>
<P>Should the increa&s;e of duties tend to a decrea&s;e of the con&s;umption of tho&s;e articles, the effect would be, in every re&s;pect de&s;ireable. The &s;aving which it would occa&s;ion, would leave indivi|duals more at their ea&s;e, and promote a more favourable balance of trade. As far as this decrea&s;e might be applicable to di&s;tilled &s;pirits, it would encourage the &s;ub&s;titution of cyder and malt liquors, benefit agriculture, and open a new and productive &s;ource of revenue.</P>
<P>It is not however, probable, that this decrea&s;e would be in a degree, which would fru&s;trate the expected benefit to the revenue from rai&s;ing the duties. Experience has &s;hewn, that luxuries of every kind, lay the &s;tronge&s;t hold on the attachments of mankind, which, e&s;pecially when confirmed by habit, are not ea&s;ily alienated from them.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="022998_0016_0FBAD3952DBD9070">The &s;ame fact affords a &s;ecurity to the merchant, that he is not likely to be prejudiced by con|&s;iderable duties on &s;uch articles. They will u&s;ually command a proportional price. The chief things in this view to be attended to, are, that the terms of payment be &s;o regulated, as not to require inconvenient advances, and that the mode of collection be &s;ecure.</P>
<P>To other rea&s;ons, which plead for carrying the duties upon the articles which have been men|tioned, to as great an extent as they will well bear, may be added the&s;e; that they are of a na|ture, from their exten&s;ive con&s;umption, to be very productive, and are among&s;t the mo&s;t difficult objects of illicit introduction.</P>
<P>Invited by &s;o many motives to make the be&s;t u&s;e of the re&s;ource, which the&s;e articles afford, the e&s;&s;ential enquiry is&mdash;in what mode can the duties upon them be mo&s;t effectually collected?</P>
<P>With regard to &s;uch of them, as will be brought from abroad, a duty on importation recom|mends it&s;elf by two leading con&s;iderations; one is, that meeting the object at its fir&s;t entrance into the country, the collection is drawn to a point, and &s;o far &s;implified; the other is, that it avoids the po&s;&s;ibility of interference between the regulations of the United States, and tho&s;e of the particular &s;tates.</P>
<P>But a duty, the precautions for the collection of which &s;hould terminate with the landing of the goods, as is e&s;&s;entially the ca&s;e in the exi&s;ting &s;y&s;tem, could not, with &s;afety, be carried to the extent, which is contemplated.</P>
<P>In that &s;y&s;tem, the eva&s;ion of the duties, depends as it were, on a &s;ingle ri&s;k. To land the goods in defiance of the vigilance of the officers of the cu&s;toms, is almo&s;t, the &s;ole difficulty. No future pur&s;uit, is materially, to be apprehended. And where the inducement is equivalent to the ri&s;k, there will be found too many, who are willing to run it. Con&s;equently there will be ex|ten&s;ive frauds of the revenue, again&s;t which the utmo&s;t rigor of penal laws, has proved, as often as it has been tried, an ineffectual guard.</P>
<P>The only expedient which has been di&s;covered, for conciliating high duties with a &s;afe collec|tion, is, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a <HI>&s;econd</HI>; or interior &s;crunity.</P>
<P>By pur&s;uing the article, from its importation, into the hands of the dealers in it, the ri&s;k of detection is &s;o greatly inhanced, that few, in compari&s;on, will venture to incur it. Indeed every dealer, who is not him&s;elf the fraudulent importer, then becomes, in &s;ome &s;ort, a centinel upon him.</P>
<P>The introduction of a &s;y&s;tem, founded on this principle, in &s;ome &s;hape or other, is, in the opinion of the Secretary, e&s;&s;ential to the efficacy of every attempt, to render the revenues of the United States equal to their exigencies, their &s;afety, their pro&s;perity, their honor.</P>
<P>Nor is it le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the intere&s;t of the hone&s;t and fair trader. It might even be added, that every individual citizen, be&s;ides his &s;hare in the general weal, has a particular intere&s;t in it. The practice of &s;muggling never fails to have one of two effects, and &s;ometimes unites them both. Either the &s;muggler under&s;ells the fair trader, as, by &s;aving the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> he can afford to do, and makes <HI>it</HI> a charge upon him; or he &s;ells at the increa&s;ed price occa&s;ioned by the duty, and defrauds every man, who buys of him, of his &s;hare of what the public ought to receive. For it is evident, that the lo&s;s falls ultimately upon the citizens, who mu&s;t be charged with other taxes to make good the deficiency&punc; and &s;upply the wants of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The Secretary will not pre&s;ume, that the plan; which he &s;hall &s;ubmit to the con&s;ideration of the hou&s;e, is the be&s;t that could be devi&s;ed. But it is the one, which has appeared to him free&s;t from objections of any, that has occurred of equal efficacy. He acknowledges too, that it is &s;u&s;ceptible of improvement, by other precautions in favor of the revenue, which he did not think it expedient to add. The chief outlines of the plan are not original, but it is no ill recom|mendation of it, that it has been tried with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Secretary accordingly propo&s;es,</P>
<P>That the duties heretofore laid upon wines, di&s;tilled &s;pirits, teas and coffee, &s;hould, after the la&s;t day of May next, cea&s;e, and that in&s;tead of them, the following duties be laid.&mdash;</P>

<P>The Secretary does not di&s;tribute the duties on Teas into different cla&s;&s;es, as has been done in the impo&s;t act of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e this di&s;tribution depends on con&s;iderations of commer|cial policy, not of revenue. It is &s;ufficient, therefore, for him to remark, that the rates, above &s;pecified, are propo&s;ed with reference to the lowe&s;t cla&s;s.</P>
<P>The Secretary conceiving, that he could not convey an accurate idea of the plan contemplated by him, for the collection of the&s;e duties, in any mode &s;o effectual as by the draft of a bill for the purpo&s;e, begs leave re&s;pectfully to refer the Hou&s;e to that, which will be found annexed to this report, relatively to the article of di&s;tilled &s;pirits; and which, for the better explanation of &s;ome of its parts, is accompanied with marginal remarks.</P>
<P>It would be the intention of the Secretary, that the duty on wines &s;hould be collected upon preci&s;ely the &s;ame plan with that on imported &s;pirits.</P>
<P>But with regard to teas and coffee, the Secretary is inclined to think, that it will be expedi|ent, till experience &s;hall evince the propriety of going further, to exclude the <HI>ordinary</HI> right of the officers to vi&s;it and in&s;pect the places in which tho&s;e articles may be kept. The other pre|cautions, without this, will afford, though not complete, con&s;iderable &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>It will not e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of the Hou&s;e, that the Secretary, in the plan &s;ubmitted, has taken the mo&s;t &s;crupulous care, that tho&s;e citizens upon whom it is immediately to operate, be &s;ecured from every &s;pecies of injury by the mi&s;conduct of the officers to be employed. There are not only &s;trong guards again&s;t their being guilty of abu&s;es of authority; they are not only pu|ni&s;hable, criminally, for any they may commit, and made an&s;werable in damages, to individu|als, for whatever prejudice the&s;e may &s;u&s;tain by their acts or neglects: But even where &s;eizures
<PB N="19" REF="022998_0018_0FBAD3982EB40E00">
are made with probable cau&s;e, if there be an acquittal of the article &s;eized, a compen&s;ation to the proprietors for the injury their property may &s;uffer, and even for its detention, is to be made out of the public trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>So &s;olicitous indeed has the Secretary been, to obviate every appearance of hard&s;hip, that he has even included a compen&s;ation to the dealers, for their agency in aid of the revenue.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e precautions to manife&s;t a &s;pirit of moderation and ju&s;tice on the part of the go|vernment: And when it is con&s;idered, that the object of the propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem is the firm e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of public credit; that on this depends the character, &s;ecurity and pro&s;perity of the nation; that advantages in every light important, may be expected to re&s;ult from it; that the immedi|ate operation of it will be upon an enlightened cla&s;s of citizens, zealou&s;ly devoted to good go|vernment, and to a liberal and enlarged policy, and that it is peculiarly the intere&s;t of the virtu|ous part of them to co-operate in whatever will re&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rain the &s;pirit of illicit traffic; there will be perceived to exi&s;t, the ju&s;te&s;t ground of confidence, that the plan, if eligible in it&s;elf, will expe|rience the chearful and prompt acquie&s;cence of the community.</P>
<P>The Secretary computes the nett product of the duties propo&s;ed in this report at about one mil|lion &s;even hundred and three thou&s;and four hundred dollars, according to the e&s;timate in the &s;chedule K, which if near the truth, will, together with the probable product of the duties on imports and tonnage, complete the &s;um required. But it will readily occur, that in &s;o unexplored a field there mu&s;t be a con&s;iderable degree of uncertainty in the data. And that, on this account, it will be prudent to have an auxiliary re&s;ource for the fir&s;t year, in which the intere&s;t will become payable, that there may be no po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;appointment to the public creditors, ere there may be an opportunity of providing for any deficiency, which the experiment may di&s;cover. This will accordingly be attended to.</P>
<P>The proper appropriation of the funds provided, and to be provided, &s;eems next to offer it&s;elf to con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>On this head, the Secretary would propo&s;e, that the duties on di&s;tilled &s;pirits, &s;hould be applied in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to the payment of the intere&s;t of the foreign debt.</P>
<P>That re&s;erving out of the re&s;idue of tho&s;e duties an annual &s;um of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and dollars, for the current &s;ervice of the United States; the &s;urplus, together with the product of the other duties, be applied to the payment of the intere&s;t on the new loan, by an appopriation, co-exten&s;ive with the duration of the debt.</P>
<P>And that if any part of the debt &s;hould remain un&s;ub&s;cribed, the exce&s;s of the revenue be divided among the creditors of the un&s;ub&s;cribed part, by a temporary di&s;po&s;ition; with a limitation, how|ever, to four per cent.</P>
<P>It will hardly have been unnoticed, that the Secretary has been thus far &s;ilent on the &s;ubject of the po&s;t-office. The rea&s;on is, that he has had in view the application of the revenue ari&s;ing from that &s;ource, to the purpo&s;es of a &s;inking fund. The po&s;t-ma&s;ter-general gives it as his opinion, that the immediate product of it, upon a proper arrangement, would probably be, not le&s;s than one hundred thou&s;and dollars. And from its nature, with good management, it mu&s;t be a grow|ing, and will be likely to become a con&s;iderable fund. The po&s;t-ma&s;ter-general is now engaged in preparing a plan,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This plan, &s;ince the framing of this report, has been received, and will be, &s;hortly, &s;ubmitted.</NOTE> which will be the foundation of a propo&s;ition for a new arrangement of the e&s;tabli&s;hment. This, and &s;ome other points relative to the &s;ubject referred to the Secretary, he begs leave to re&s;erve for a future report.</P>
<P>Per&s;uaded as the Secretary is, that the proper funding of the pre&s;ent debt, will render it a na|tional ble&s;&s;ing: Yet he is &s;o far from acceding to the po&s;ition, in the latitude in which it is &s;ome|times laid down, that "public debts are public benefits," a po&s;ition inviting to prodigality, and liable to dangerous abu&s;e,&mdash;that he ardently wi&s;hes to &s;ee it incorporated, as a fundamental maxim, in the &s;y&s;tem of public credit of the United States, that the creation of debt &s;hould always be ac|companied with the means of extingui&s;hment. This he regards as the true &s;ecret for rendering public credit immortal. And he pre&s;umes, that it is difficult to conceive a &s;ituation, in which there may not be an adherence to the maxim. At lea&s;t he feels an unfeigned &s;olicitude, that this may be attempted by the United States, and that they may commence their mea&s;ures for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of credit, with the ob&s;ervance of it.</P>
<P>Under this impre&s;&s;ion, the Secretary propo&s;es, that the nett product of the po&s;t-office, to a &s;um not exceeding one million of dollars, be ve&s;ted in commi&s;&s;ioners, to con&s;i&s;t of the Vice-Pre&s;ident of the United States or Pre&s;ident of the Senate, the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, the Chief Ju&s;tice, Secretary of the Trea&s;ury and Attorney-General of the United States, for the time being, in tru&s;t, to be applied, by them, or any three of them, to the di&s;charge of the exi&s;ting pub|lic debt, either by purcha&s;es of &s;tock in the market, or by payments on account of the principal,
<PB N="20" REF="022998_0019_0FBAD399AF62A168">
as &s;hall appear to them mo&s;t advi&s;eable, in conformity to the public engagements; to continue &s;o ve&s;ted, until the whole of the debt &s;hall be di&s;charged.</P>
<P>As an additional expedient for effecting a reduction of the debt, and for other purpo&s;es which will be mentioned, the Secretary would further propo&s;e that the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ioners be authori&s;ed, with the approbation of the Pre&s;ident of the United States, to borrow, on their credit, a &s;um, not exceeding twelve millions of dollars, to be applied,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. To the payment of the intere&s;t and in&s;talments of the foreign debt, to the end of the pre&s;ent year, which will require 3,491,923 dollars, and 46 cents.</P>
<P>Secondly. To the payment of any deficiency which may happen in the product of the funds provided for paying the intere&s;t of the dome&s;tic debt.</P>
<P>Thirdly. To the effecting a change in the form of &s;uch part of the foreign debt, as bears an intere&s;t of five per cent. It is conceived, that, for this purpo&s;e, a new loan, at a lower intere&s;t, may be combined with other expedients. The remainder of this part of the debt, after paying the in&s;talments, which will accrue in the cour&s;e of 1790, will be 3,888,888 dollars, and 81 cents.</P>
<P>Fourthly. To the purcha&s;e of the public debt at the price it &s;hall bear in the market, while it continues below its true value. This mea&s;ure, which would be, in the opinion of the Secretary, highly di&s;honorable to the government, if it were to precede a provi&s;ion for funding the debt, would become altogether unexceptionable, after that had been made. Its effect would be in favor of the public creditors, as it would tend to rai&s;e the value of &s;tock. And all the difference, be|tween its true value, and the actual price, would be &s;o much clear gain to the public. The pay|ment of foreign intere&s;t on the capital to be borrowed for this purpo&s;e, &s;hould that be a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, would not, in the judgment of the Secretary, be a good objection to the mea&s;ure. The &s;aving by the operation would be it&s;elf, a &s;ufficient indemnity; and the employment of that capital, in a country &s;ituated like this, would much more than compen&s;ate for it. Be&s;ides, if the government does not undertake this operation, the &s;ame inconvenience, which the objection in que&s;tion &s;uppo&s;es, would happen in another way, with a circum&s;tance of aggravation. As long, at lea&s;t, as the debt &s;hall continue below its proper value, it will be an object of &s;peculation to fo|reigners, who will not only receive the intere&s;t, upon what they purcha&s;e, and remit it abroad, as in the ca&s;e of the loan, but will reap the additional profit of the difference in value. By the go|vernment's entering into competition with them, it will not only reap a part of this profit it&s;elf, but will contract the extent, and le&s;&s;en the extra profit of foreign purcha&s;es. That competition will accelerate the ri&s;e of &s;tock; and whatever greater rate this obliges foreigners to pay, for what they purcha&s;e, is &s;o much clear &s;aving to the nation. In the opinion of the Secretary, and con|trary to an idea which is not without patrons, it ought to be the policy of the government, to rai&s;e the value of &s;tock to its true &s;tandard as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. When it arrives to that point, foreign &s;peculations (which, till then, mu&s;t be deemed pernicious, further than as they &s;erve to bring it to that point) will become beneficial. Their money laid out in this country, upon our agriculture, commerce and manufactures, will produce much more to us, than the income they will receive from it.</P>
<P>The Secretary contemplates the application of this money, through the medium of a national bank, for which, with the permi&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e, he will &s;ubmit a plan in the cour&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Secretary now proceeds, in the la&s;t place, to offer to the con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e, his ideas, of the &s;teps, which ought at the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, to be taken, towards the a&s;&s;umption of the &s;tate debts.</P>
<P>The&s;e are briefly, that concurrent re&s;olutions of the two Hou&s;es, with the approbation of the Pre&s;ident, be entered into, declaring in &s;ub&s;tance,</P>
<P>That the United States do a&s;&s;ume, and will at the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion in the year 1791, provide, on the &s;ame terms with the pre&s;ent debt of the United States, for all &s;uch part of the debts of the re&s;pec|tive &s;tates, or any of them, as &s;hall, prior to the fir&s;t day of January in the &s;aid year 1791, be &s;ub&s;cribed towards a loan to the United States, upon the principles of either of the plans, which &s;hall have been adopted by them, for obtaining a re-loan of their pre&s;ent debt.</P>
<P>Provided that the provi&s;ion to be made as afore&s;aid, &s;hall be &s;u&s;pended, with re&s;pect to the debt, of any &s;tate, which may have exchanged the &s;ecurities of the United States for others i&s;&s;ued by it&s;elf, until the whole of the &s;aid &s;ecurities &s;hall, either be re-exchanged, or &s;urrendered to the United States.</P>
<P>And provided al&s;o, that the intere&s;t upon the debt a&s;&s;umed, be computed to the end of the year 1791; and that the intere&s;t to be paid by the United States, commence on the fir&s;t day of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nu|ary, 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>That the amount of the debt of each &s;tate &s;o a&s;&s;umed and provided for, be charged to &s;uch &s;tate
<PB N="21" REF="022998_0020_0FBAD39B45B7F188">
in account with the United States, upon the &s;ame principles, upon which it &s;hall be lent to the United States.</P>
<P>That &s;ub&s;criptions be opened for receiving loans of the &s;aid debts at the &s;ame times and places, and under the like regulations, as &s;hall have been pre&s;cribed in relation to the debt of the United States.</P>
<P>The Secretary has now completed the objects, which he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf, to compri&s;e in the pre&s;ent report. He has, for the mo&s;t part, omitted details, as well to avoid fatiguing the at|tention of the Hou&s;e, as becau&s;e more time would have been de&s;irable even to dige&s;t the general principles of the plan. If the&s;e &s;hould be found right, the particular modifications will readily &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves in the progre&s;s of the work.</P>
<P>The Secretary, in the views which have directed his pur&s;uit of the &s;ubject, has been influenced, in the fir&s;t place, by the con&s;ideration, that his duty from the very terms of the re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e, obliged him to propo&s;e what appeared to him an adequate provi&s;ion for the &s;upport of the public credit, adapted at the &s;ame time to the real circum&s;tances of the United States; and in the next, by the reflection, that mea&s;ures which will not bear the te&s;t of future unbia&s;&s;ed examination, can neither be productive of individual reputation, nor (which is of much greater con&s;equence) public honor, or advantage.</P>
<P>Deeply impre&s;&s;ed, as the Secretary is, with a full and deliberate conviction, that the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of public credit, upon the ba&s;is of a &s;atisfactory provi&s;ion, for the public debt, is, under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of this country, the true de&s;ideratum towards relief from individual and na|tional embarra&s;&s;ments; that without it, the&s;e embarra&s;&s;ments will be likely to pre&s;s &s;till more &s;e|verely upon the community&mdash;He cannot but indulge an anxious wi&s;h, that an effectual plan for that purpo&s;e may, during the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, be the re&s;ult of the united wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>He is fully convinced, that it is of the greate&s;t importance, that no further delay &s;hould attend the making of the requi&s;ite provi&s;ion; not only, becau&s;e it will give a better impre&s;&s;ion of the good faith of the country, and will bring earlier relief to the creditors; both which circum&s;tances are of great moment to public credit: but, becau&s;e the advantages to the community, from rai&s;ing &s;tock, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, to its natural value, will be incomparably greater, than any that can re&s;ult from its continuance below that &s;tandard. No profit, which could be derived from purcha|&s;es in the market, on account of the government, to any practicable extent, would be an equiva|lent for the lo&s;s, which would be &s;u&s;tained by the purcha&s;es of foreigners, at a low value. Not to repeat, that governmental purcha&s;es, to be honorable, ought to be preceded by a provi&s;ion. De|lay, by di&s;&s;eminating doubt, would &s;ink the price of &s;tock; and as the temptation to foreign &s;pe|culations, from the lowne&s;s of the price, would be too great to be neglected, millions would probably be lo&s;t to the United States.</P>

<HEAD>An ACT repealing, after the la&s;t day of  <GAP DESC="blank">  next, the Duties heretofore laid upon di&s;tilled Spirits imported from abroad, and laying others in their &s;tead, and al&s;o upon Spirits di&s;tilled within the United States, as well to di&s;courage the exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of tho&s;e Spirits, and promote Agri+culture, as to provide for the &s;upport of the Public Credit, and for the Common Defence and General Welfare.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BE it enacted by the Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States of America in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The four fir&s;t of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of proof corre&s;pond with the different kinds of &s;pirits now u&s;ually im|ported: The fir&s;t with gin; the &s;econd with St. Croix rum; the third with Antigua rum; the fourth with Jamaica &s;pirits; the fifth corre&s;ponds with the u&s;ual proof of high wines; the la&s;t with that of Alcohol. The&s;e di&s;tinctions are nece&s;&s;ary, not only to proportion the duty, but to prevent eva&s;ions of it. According to the pre&s;ent act, high wines, or even Alcohol, which is from <HI>30</HI> to <HI>40</HI> per cent. above Jamaica proof, might be imported liable only to the duty of Jamaica proof.</NOTE> that after the la&s;t day of  <GAP DESC="blank">  next, the duties laid on di&s;tilled &s;pirits by the act entitled "An act for laying a duty on goods, wares and merchandizes imported into the United States," &s;hall cea&s;e; and that upon all di&s;tilled &s;pirits which &s;hall be imported into the United States, after that day, from any foreign port or place, there &s;hall be paid for their u&s;e the duties following, that is to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. For every gallon of tho&s;e &s;pirits more than ten per cent. below proof, according to Dicas's hydrometer, twenty cents.</P>

<P N="3">3d. For every gallon of tho&s;e &s;pirits of proof, and not more than five per. cent below proof, according to the &s;ame hydrometer, twenty-two cents.</P>
<P N="4">4th. For every gallon of tho&s;e &s;pirits above proof, but not exceeding twenty per cent. accord|ing to the &s;ame hydrometer, twenty-five cents.</P>
<P N="5">5th. For every gallon of tho&s;e &s;pirits more than twenty, and not more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the &s;ame hydrometer, thirty cents.</P>
<P N="6">6th. For every gallon of tho&s;e &s;pirits, more than forty per cent. above proof, according to the &s;ame hydrometer, forty cents.</P>
<P N="2">II.

Generally &s;peaking, tran&s;ient per&s;ons are tho&s;e who avail them&s;elves of the advantage; and they, without it, would commonly pay down, from the inconvenience of procuring and leaving &s;ureties.</NOTE> that the &s;aid duties at the option of the proprietor, importer or con&s;ignee, may either be paid immediately, or &s;ecured by bond, with one or more &s;ureties, to the &s;atisfaction of the collector, or per&s;on acting as &s;uch, with condition for the payment of one moiety in four months, and the other moiety in eight months: Provided that where the &s;aid duties &s;hall not exceed fifty dollars, the &s;ame &s;hall be immediately paid; and that where the &s;ame &s;hall exceed fifty dollars, if the &s;aid proprietor, importer or con&s;ignee &s;hall think fit to make pre&s;ent payment thereof, there &s;hall be an abatement to him or her, at the rate of &s;even per cent per annum, only for &s;uch pre&s;ent payment, the allowance of ten per cent. in the &s;aid former act notwith&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>And as not only a due regard to the exigencies of the public, and to the intere&s;t and ea&s;e of the community, but ju&s;tice to tho&s;e virtuous citizens, who, content with the emoluments of fair and honorable trade, di&s;dain to violate the laws of their country, and the principles of probity, requires that every po&s;&s;ible impediment &s;hould be oppo&s;ed to the fraudulent views of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to profit at the expence both of the fair trader and of the community&mdash;</P>

<P N="5">V.
