</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE &s;cience of hi&s;tory has its peculiar ad|vantages, and is in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;ingu|larly u&s;eful and important. The plea&s;ing and profitable are here &s;o blended together, that it is alike calculated to entertain and improve. Such are the changes and revolutions in man|ners and cu&s;toms, that the hi&s;tory of a few years back, affords, perhaps more agreeable novelty, than the inventions of the fanciful in our own time. Hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially eccle&s;ia&s;|tical hi&s;tory, is al&s;o a &s;ource whence may be drawn the founde&s;t maxims of prudence, and mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial improvements in piety. We here become acquainted with a variety of per|&s;ons whom we never &s;aw, may learn their cha|racters, trace their motives of acting, and thus acquire great knowledge of mankind. While we are here furni&s;hed with many illu&s;trious models of goodne&s;s, benevolence, and piety; we al&s;o light on characters of a contrary com|plexion, who&s;e pride and ambition, di&s;obedi|ence and vice, and con&s;equent overthrow, are
<PB N="4" REF="033798_0003_0FF92F031D12EAB8">
on record for our admonition. The authen|tic hi&s;tory of the church does indeed contain the records of divine providence towards her, and furni&s;hes us with indubitable te&s;timony, that a holy God will not &s;uffer iniquity and vice to go unpuni&s;hed, nor virtue and piety unrewarded.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of the many important advantages re&s;ulting from a careful attention to eccle&s;ia&s;|tical hi&s;tory, the in&s;pired penman in this P&s;alm gives a brief hi&s;toric detail of God's marvellous dealings with his ancient people; and of their ungrateful requital of his kind|ne&s;s; from their departure out of Egypt, to the time of David's promotion to the throne of I&s;rael. Many things occur in the hi&s;tory of this people, &s;o extraordinary and important, adapted to admoni&s;h and in&s;truct all &s;ucceed|ing generations, that they ought never to be forgotten. And thus God expre&s;sly enjoined upon the I&s;raelites, at the giving of the law, that they &s;hould not only &s;tudy it, and become thoroughly acquainted with it them&s;elves; but al&s;o faithfully inculcate it upon their children, that the knowledge thereof, might be tran&s;|mitted through every &s;ucceeding generation&mdash;<HI>For he e&s;tabli&s;hed a te&s;timony in Jacob, and ap|pointed a law in I&s;rael, which he commanded our fathers, that they &s;hould make them known
<PB N="5" REF="033798_0004_0FF92F19C3665C80">
to their children; that the generation to come might know them, even the children which &s;hould be born, who &s;hould ari&s;e and declare them to their children.</HI> In exact conformity to this precept was this P&s;alm compo&s;ed. Though we have a hi&s;tory of the &s;ame events at large, el&s;ewhere; yet we here have an a|bridgment, containing only the more memo|rable and important occurrences, that the &s;ub|&s;tance of the whole is reduced into a &s;mall compa&s;s, may be collected at once, and hence is more adapted to immediate u&s;e.</P>
<P>For the in&s;truction and admonition of &s;uc|ceeding generations, the pious and learned, on various occa&s;ions, have taken great pains to collect materials for, and to furni&s;h the church with, authentic eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tories; and tran&s;mit to po&s;terity every thing calculated to &s;ub&s;erve the intere&s;ts of religion&mdash;That the Jews, in ages to come, might &s;ee the bread which God provided for their fathers in the wilderne&s;s, he directed Mo&s;es to have an omer full of Manna laid up in a pot, before the te&s;|timony of the Lord, and there to be kept for their generations.</P>
<P>This p&s;alm is introduced, with a mixture of authority and affection, &s;uitable to a divine teacher. <HI>Give ear, O my people to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth;</HI>"
<PB N="6" REF="033798_0005_0FF92F2E651B8EB8">
that is, attend with reverence to the in&s;truc|tive admonitions I am now about to give you, taken from the memorable events of provi|dence, relative to your forefathers, which me|rit your devout regard, and that of every &s;uc|ceeding age to the end of time. <HI>I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark &s;ay|ings of old.</HI> Though this p&s;alm contains a narrative of facts, ea&s;y to be under&s;tood; yet, if we con&s;ider it as having a typical reference to go&s;pel times, it then becomes parabolical, as to its &s;piritual meaning and ultimate de&s;ign. And thus Paul, referring to things related in this p&s;alm, &s;aith, <HI>now all the&s;e things happen|ed unto them for examples, and they are writ|ten for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</HI> And the things that I am about to relate, are &s;uch as <HI>we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us:</HI> that is, they are not things that have been done in another nation, and among another people, and hence of doubtful credit; but they are things that you have heard, and known to be on record in your &s;acred books; which your forefathers, who were eye-witne&s;&s;es of them, have faithfully regi&s;tered, and tran&s;mitted to you.</P>
<P>My text next follows, which the p&s;almi&s;t appears to have uttered with an ardour of pie|ty,
<PB N="7" REF="033798_0006_0FF92F3AC67F96E8">
and a mo&s;t generous regard for the inter|e&s;ts of religion, in generations to come.&mdash;<HI>We will not hide them from their children, &s;hewing to the generation to come the prai&s;es of the Lord, and his &s;trength, and his wonderful works that be hath done.</HI> Though the recollection of the ingratitude, with which your forefathers re|quited the marvellous goodne&s;s and grace of God, is humiliating in the highe&s;t degree; that did we merely court the applau&s;e of their children, we &s;hould pa&s;s in &s;ilence this unplea|&s;ant part of the hi&s;tory; yet, as this may be profitable for their admonition, we will hide no part from them&mdash;We will relate with the &s;ame fidelity, tho&s;e things that may mortify, or excite pain, as tho&s;e that are calculated to afford plea&s;ure. We will not conceal any thing from their children. The principle which actuated the &s;acred hi&s;torian, was gene|rous and animating. Not confining his at|tention to &s;elf, nor to a few particular friends, nor yet to the people of his own time, his views reached forward into futurity, and his love embraced millions of unborn &s;ons and daugh|ters of Zion. The prophetic grace imported to him, expanded his &s;oul, and extended his views to the generations to come, and rai&s;ed his thoughts &s;uperior to every thing low or groveling. His conduct on the occa&s;ion, does
<PB N="8" REF="033798_0007_0FF92F4E034E34E8">
honor to him as a citizen of I&s;rael, as a patri|ot, and is worthy of him as a prophet of the mo&s;t high.</P>
<P><HI>Shewing to the generation to come,</HI> or the lat|ter generations of chri&s;tianized Gentiles, as the meaning may probably be. This con&s;truc|tion gives the prophet's views a &s;till further extent and larger &s;cope. His love was warm&mdash;his pious zeal fervent&mdash;his language animated&mdash;his object grand and important, the glory of God, in the welfare of all &s;ucceeding gene|rations to the end of the world.</P>
<P>What <HI>the prai&s;es of the Lord, and his &s;trength, and his wonderful works,</HI> mentioned in the text, were, is obvious from the context. They were his marvellous acts of righteou&s;ne&s;s and grace, towards his ancient people, from the time they left Egypt, to the royal e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of David over them.</P>
<P>From the text thus explained, I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e, with &s;pecial application to this church and &s;ociety; taking notice of the more remarkable or leading providences of God towards her, from her fir&s;t origin to the pre&s;ent time, which is now one hundred years. That we may adhere as &s;trictly to the &s;pirit of the text, as the occa&s;ion will admit, I purpo&s;e to draw a parallel, or point out the re&s;emblance, between <HI>the prai&s;es of the Lord
<PB N="9" REF="033798_0008_0FF92F61CF4E3298">
and his &s;trength, and his wonderful works,</HI> towards I&s;rael, in the period to which this hi&s;|rory relates; and towards you, and your fore|fathers. Though it might favor of arrogance and &s;uper&s;tition, to &s;uppo&s;e that the I&s;raeliti&s;h church was intended to &s;et forth this, or any other chri&s;tian &s;ociety in particular; yet in the former we have an emblem of the whole chri&s;|tian church in general; and perhaps more &s;triking in&s;tances of re&s;emblance can be tra|ced in few chri&s;tian &s;ocieties, than in this.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The I&s;raelites could &s;ay, at the time this hi&s;tory commences, that they &s;prang from ance&s;tors of eminent piety&mdash;Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob. Though &s;ome of their po&s;terity of later times, have prided them&s;elves in their pious de&s;cent, in a manner that did them no credit, either as men, or as pious men; yet it is doubtle&s;s a privilege of no incon&s;iderable value, to de&s;cend from pious ance&s;tors&mdash;To be dedicated to God in infancy, and placed with|in the pale of the vi&s;ible church by believing parents, to have their prayers trea&s;ured up before God in our behalf, and our minds early furni&s;hed with pious in&s;truction, and nurtured to habits of virtue; are privileges, which no con&s;iderate per&s;on will undervalue&mdash;and thus the advantage of being a Jew formerly, and the profit of circumci&s;ion, &s;aith Paul, are
<PB N="10" REF="033798_0009_0FF92F7F582E5690">
much every way, chiefly, becau&s;e that unto them were committed the oracles of God&mdash;Now the&s;e are privileges with which you were born; and in the enjoyment of which you have grown up&mdash;You &s;prang from ance&s;tors of eminent piety; who gave &s;trong proof of the &s;teadine&s;s of their faith, and of their un|&s;haken adherence to their chri&s;tian principles&mdash;In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to e&s;cape per&s;ecution, or that they might guilty enjoy a good con|&s;cience in the wor&s;hip of their God; and that the morals of their youth might not be ex|po&s;ed to corruption among a di&s;&s;olute people; your forefathers fled acro&s;s the Atlantic, and chearfully &s;ubmitted to all the hard&s;hips that attended the &s;ettlement of a wilderne&s;s of a northern climate&mdash;Though they endured al|mo&s;t incredible &s;ufferings of cold, hunger, and nakedne&s;s; and dangers from the &s;avage natives of America, and other cau&s;es; yet, un|like the Jews, who were for returning to their bondage and oppre&s;&s;ion in Egypt, we never hear them complain of the lot, providence had appointed them. Mo&s;es e&s;teemed the reproach of Chri&s;t greater riches than the trea&s;ures of Egypt&mdash;And they preferred a good con&s;cience to ea&s;e and wealth&mdash;And perhaps in no part of the world &s;ince the days of the Apo&s;tles, has religion flouri&s;hed more, or in
<PB N="11" REF="033798_0010_0FF92F95F28359C8">
greater purity, than in New-England, the land where they fixed their habitation. They took pains, to have the go&s;pel immediately planted with them, and taught among them. The&s;e are the people from whom you &s;prang, and their prayers for you are not at this day obliterated from the book of God's remem|brance. Did your fathers do &s;o much, in their reduced and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances? What then ought you their children to do, at the height of pro&s;perity, to which you are rai&s;ed?</P>
<P N="2">2d. The I&s;raelites left Egypt under the guidance of Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of the Mo&s;t High, and accompanied by Aaron, who was appointed by God to mini&s;ter to them in holy things&mdash;And your fathers left Dorche&s;ter, Roxbury, and Milton, in the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, accompanied by a Mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel. When they came on to the&s;e &s;outh|ern provinces, it was not it appears in order to flee from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, nor to rid them&s;elves of religion, as a burden&s;ome or un|profitable thing&mdash;they &s;et too high a value on the go&s;pel and its ordinances, to di&s;pen&s;e with them; and were no doubt per&s;uaded, that to walk with God in all his holy in&s;titutions, is the &s;ure&s;t road to pro&s;perity and happine&s;s in this world&punc; and entirely nece&s;&s;ary to a well
<PB N="12" REF="033798_0011_0FF92FB01EBEED08">
grounded hope of admi&s;&s;ion into a better&mdash;Hence, when they &s;et out, the Ark of God mu&s;t go with them, or they furni&s;h them&s;elves with a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, who is ordained to their particular charge&mdash;Their fathers, breth|ern, and friends, accompany them down to the &s;hore; where, after kneeling down and mingling their &s;upplications to the God of all grace, they take leave of one another, with every expre&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tian tenderne&s;s and brotherly love, expecting to meet again in a &s;tate of in&s;eparable union to each other; and to Je&s;us their common head.</P>
<P>No people that are wi&s;e, will abandon or treat with neglect the &s;acred in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel; for they are &s;carcely le&s;s conducive to the peace and welfare of &s;ociety in this world, than to fit men for ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in the next.</P>
<P N="3">3d. When the I&s;raelites left Egypt, they car|ried with them the religion and wor&s;hip of the true God, into a land over&s;pread with iniquity and idolatry. And one leading object, which your fathers contemplated, in their removal to the &s;tate of South-Carolina, was, <HI>to en|courage the &s;ettlement of churches and the pro|motion of religion in the Southern plantations</HI>; a &s;triking evidence of their di&s;tingui&s;hed pie|ty and zeal for the general diffu&s;ion of the knowledge of the go&s;pel of peace.&mdash;Probably
<PB N="13" REF="033798_0012_0FF92FC9367F2C00">
at the time your fathers came on to Carolina, there were few or no religious &s;ocieties regu|larly organized in that &s;tate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Am informed by a per&s;on who has &s;een the records of the church in Dorche&s;ter in the &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, that they mention that the Sacrament of the Lords Supper had not been celebrated in the &s;tate of South-Carolina, until by this church.</NOTE> Hence they felt the nece&s;&s;ity of bringing the go&s;pel with them, that they might not be de&s;titute of a ble&s;&s;ing which they prized more than wealth. Being animated from on high, by a generous zeal for the &s;pread of that go&s;pel, which is able to make men wi&s;e unto &s;alvation; they were induced to leave their fathers, their brethern, and their native land. How far they &s;ucceeded in this laudable de&s;ign, we at this day are not able preci&s;ely to a&s;certain. That their example in this particular is how|ever, worthy of the imitation of the chri&s;tian world, while nations of our fellow men are peri&s;hing through Heatheni&s;h ignorance, none may doubt.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Mo&s;es and Aaron died, and were &s;uc|ceeded in office by Jo&s;hua and Eleazer. The Reverend pa&s;tor, Jo&s;eph Lord, who accom|panied your forefathers from New-England, to South-Carolina, has al&s;o had &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in the &s;acred office of the go&s;pel mini&s;try in this
<PB N="14" REF="033798_0013_0FF92FDD00457540">
church. The fir&s;t was the Reverend Hugh Fi&s;her, who died on the &s;ixth of October, 1734&mdash;The Reverend John O&s;good &s;ucceeded him, and entered on the pa&s;toral charge of this church, the twenty-fourth of March, 1735: and died the &s;econd of Augu&s;t, 1773; who&s;e &s;ympathy and affection, as the friend of his people&mdash;who&s;e labors, as the &s;ervant of Chri&s;t&mdash;who&s;e watchfulne&s;s, as the bi&s;hop of &s;ouls&mdash;who&s;e care, as the &s;hepherd of his flock&mdash;who&s;e piety, fidelity, and &s;ucce&s;s in the mini&s;|terial work, will by you be remembered to his prai&s;e for generations to come; and are now &s;tars in the crown of his rejoicing in Heaven, which &s;hall &s;hine with growing &s;plen|dor, when yon great lamp which illumes the heavenly orbs &s;hall be put out: for they that be wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the firmament; and they that turn many to righte|ou&s;ne&s;s as the &s;tars for ever and ever.&mdash;The three &s;ucceeding years after the death of Mr. O&s;good, the church was occa&s;ionally &s;upplied, by Dr. Zubly, Me&s;&s;rs. Cook, Daniel Robarts, and others.&mdash;In the year 1776, the Reverend Mo&s;es Allen &s;ucceeded to the pa&s;toral charge of this church, and continued in it until No|vember 1778, when it was entirely broken up, and di&s;per&s;ed by the Briti&s;h army. At the conclu&s;ion of the war, the people returned
<PB N="15" REF="033798_0014_0FF92FF036E0DBD0">
to their plantations, and immediately pro|ceeded to mea&s;ures for the re&s;toration of their religious privileges, &s;tatedly a&s;&s;embling on the Lords day, previous to their procuring a Mini&s;ter, and uniting in the duties of &s;ocial wor&s;hip. In Augu&s;t 1784, the Reverend Abiel Holmes entered on the mini&s;terial work among you, and continued his pious labors with you, until the twenty-fir&s;t of June 1791&mdash;Your pre&s;ent pa&s;tor &s;ucceeded him in the &s;a|cred office the fourth of the en&s;uing Decem|ber&mdash;And &s;irs, your fathers are gone as well as your mini&s;ters, and you have ri&s;en up in their &s;tead&mdash;One generation pa&s;&s;eth away, and another ha&s;teneth after it&mdash;We have here no continuing city. With our loins girded, and our lamps trimmed and burning, &s;hould we therefore hold our&s;elves in readine&s;s to go hence.</P>
<P N="5">5th. The Jews were a pilgrimating people. Forty years they had their encampments in the wilderne&s;s, journeying from place to place, without any fixed abode&mdash;This al&s;o hath been a pilgrimating church&mdash;In the year 1696, or probably in the beginning of the year 1697, your fathers arrived in South-Carolina, where they made a &s;tand, and named their &s;ettle|ment Dorche&s;ter, after the place of their na|tivity. They continued here about fifty-&s;even
<PB N="16" REF="033798_0015_0FF930006B09E9F0">
years&mdash;When, finding their lands in&s;ufficient for the ri&s;ing generation, and a di&s;po&s;ition in numbers, from this circum&s;tance, to remove; and apprehending this would operate to the injury of the &s;ociety, and e&s;pecially to the de|triment of &s;uch as &s;hould leave it, they wi&s;ely contemplated a general removal&mdash;And after &s;ending forward &s;everal per&s;ons, at different times, into this &s;tate, to &s;eek out a convenient &s;pot, and prepare the way; and hearing from them a good report of the lands, a con&s;idera|ble number of the &s;ociety with Mr. O&s;good, who at that time was their pa&s;tor, effected a removal to this place in the year 1754. The remaining part followed them, as &s;oon as their circum&s;tances would admit&mdash;thus evidencing their brotherly love&mdash;their union of heart, and unaffected regard for go&s;pel ordinances. The &s;ame attachments and &s;entiments of piety were again manife&s;ted, in the univer&s;al return of the people to their plantations, at the conclu|&s;ion of the Briti&s;h war. Happy is that peo|ple, who&s;e hearts are united by &s;upreme affec|tion to the God of love, and to one another by pure chri&s;tian friend&s;hip. If this be your ca&s;e, a&s;cribe the whole prai&s;e to him, who&s;e great love is the &s;ource of all our ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P N="6">6th. The ancient people of God found much oppo&s;ition to encounter, and many difficulties
<PB N="17" REF="033798_0016_0FF930105B5CE200">
to &s;urmount in their various journeyings&mdash;At one time they lacked bread, at another they were parched with thir&s;t, at another again, their progre&s;s was oppo&s;ed, by nations ho&s;tile|ly enclined towards them&mdash;And in this re&s;|pect as well as others, their &s;tate in the wil|derne&s;s, was intended to &s;et forth that of the chri&s;tian church; and has been re&s;embled by this &s;ociety in particular&mdash;Your difficulties and trials, and tho&s;e of your fathers, have been many and great, perhaps almo&s;t &s;ingular&mdash;They doubtle&s;s had many difficulties to en|counter, in their fir&s;t &s;ettling in Carolina&mdash;Many &s;ad di&s;couragements, heavy lo&s;&s;es, and di&s;appointments, al&s;o attended them in their removal from Carolina into this &s;tate&mdash;And the lo&s;&s;es you &s;u&s;tained, and the &s;ufferings you endured in the Briti&s;h war, exceed de&s;crip|tion, and were equalled perhaps by few &s;ocie|ties in America&mdash;Your hou&s;e of wor&s;hip, dwelling hou&s;es, and crops were con&s;umed by fire; your&s;elves driven from your plantations, and dive&s;ted of your property for many years; and your lives expo&s;ed to the mad unre&s;train|ed cruelties of men, ill affected towards the American cau&s;e&mdash;And your &s;avage neighbors, have been, as pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your &s;ides almo&s;t continually&mdash;The pe&s;ti|lence al&s;o hath prevailed among you, to a me|lancholly

Death and the grave, with their gha&s;tly attendants, and the painful di&s;ea&s;es that u&s;her them in, we all have to account on as certain, or they are entailed upon us. And how often are we cal|led to &s;uffer, in a &s;en&s;e, the pangs of death, in the lo&s;s of one near connection and another dear friend? Therefore, &s;aid the wi&s;e man,

<P>But in order thus to redeem time, it is re|qui&s;ite, that we &s;hould be appri&s;ed of the bu|&s;ine&s;s which properly belongs to time.

precarious, and the gratification of bodily ap+petites affords &s;uch momentary delight; that to &s;uppo&s;e God had primary regard to the&s;e, in allotting to man a &s;ea&s;on in this world, is to entertain very unworthy conceptions of him. The bu&s;ine&s;s of man in time, is emphatically, to prepare for eternity. And thus the &s;acred word enjoins, <HI>&s;eek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;Man having lo&s;t the image, and forfeited the favor of God; and in his infinitely conde&s;cending goodne&s;s a di&s;|pen&s;ation of grace being &s;et up, he was plea&s;|ed, to allot unto man a &s;ea&s;on in this world, to retrieve the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the fall, and to &s;ecure unto him&s;elf an happy immortality. That preparation for eternity, which con&s;ti|tutes the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of man in time, does then eminently con&s;i&s;t, in regaining the image and favor of God; without which, rational exi&s;tence becomes a cur&s;e.

That time which is employed in putting forward this, is &s;pent to good purpo&s;e; every advance we make in it, is &s;o far obtaining the grand end, for which time is given to man.

And it is to be recollected, that a mere e&s;cape from future mi&s;ery, and the at|tainment of future ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, is not the whole that may, and ought to be done by us&mdash;There are different degrees in the happine&s;s of Hea|ven. <HI>He that &s;oweth &s;paringly, &s;hall reap al&s;o &s;paringly; and he that &s;oweth bountifully, &s;hall reap al&s;o bountifully</HI>&mdash;And again, <HI>there is one glory of the Sun, and another glory of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars; for one &s;tar differeth from another &s;tar in glory.

danger of being deprived of their religious privileges. Now this was a proper motive, as well as that of their having &s;pent much time in heathen enormities, by which to urge them to extraordinary care and diligence in impro|ving the &s;ea&s;on, they then engaged. Though the days now, may not be evil in preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;en&s;e; yet from the growing prevalence of infidelity and vice, the days may fitly be termed evil in a &s;en&s;e, that &s;hould effectually excite every friend to the chri&s;tian cau&s;e, to extraordinary vigilance in guarding his own mind, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of our youth, from the contagious influence of vice, and in coun|teracting the malignant poi&s;on of infidelity.</P>
<P N="6">6th. Our immediate compliance with the injunction &s;hould be gained, by the con|&s;ideration, that the &s;ea&s;on is ha&s;tening on when time will be no more redeemable. <HI>I mu&s;t work the work of him that &s;ent me, while it is day; the night cometh when no man can work.</HI> There is a bu&s;ine&s;s properly belong|ing to time, and which can be done only in time. When the night of death, which is ap|proaching, &s;hall overtake us, this work mu&s;t cea&s;e forever. In however imperfect a &s;tate it &s;hall then be, it mu&s;t &s;o remain. And in re&s;pect of tho&s;e, who &s;hall then have utterly neglected this bu&s;ine&s;s, the neglect will be

irreparable. There will now be no retriev|ing mi&s;pent pa&s;t opportunities, by any extra|ordinary diligence in future. Time will be irredeemable&mdash;To what care and diligence &s;hould this con&s;ideration excite us now, in re|deeming &s;o valuable a ble&s;&s;ing. When men &s;uffer lo&s;&s;es of a worldly kind one year, they ordinarily have an opportunity the en&s;uing year, and feel it incumbent on them, then to make extraordinary exertions, to retrieve tho&s;e lo&s;&s;es. How much more &s;hould they make extraordinary exertions, to retrieve pa&s;t lo&s;&s;es, in the more weighty matters, that re&s;pect the well being of their &s;ouls through the intermi|nable ages of eternity? E&s;pecially when we con&s;ider, that if this &s;ea&s;on be neglected, the lo&s;s will be irretrievable: that there will be no &s;econd year or en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on in which to redeem time&mdash;To give this con&s;ideration its proper force, enquire within your&s;elves, what would a poor tormented &s;pirit in hell give, for &s;uch an opportunity as you now enjoy of redeeming time? Oh! that we did more accu&s;|tom our&s;elves, to live and act in the light of eternity!</P>
<P>Permit me to &s;ugge&s;t one con&s;ideration more, to enforce the injunction, and that is, the infinite price that was given to purcha&s;e time, as a &s;ea&s;on of grace for fallen man&mdash;
<PB N="18" REF="033798_0049_0FF8C7DC62549AD0">
But for the wonderful interpo&s;ition of the &s;on of God, the dreadful penalty of the divine law, we may &s;uppo&s;e, would have been imme|diately executed; at lea&s;t we could never have enjoyed time, as a &s;ea&s;on in which to make our peace with God, and prepare for an hap|py immortality. We derive this ble&s;&s;ing as a fruit of his infinitely meritorious obedience and &s;acrifice. It mu&s;t therefore, in its rela|tion to eternity, be infinitely precious. And thus it deeply concerns us, by every extraor|dinary effort to redeem &s;o precious a ble&s;&s;ing, wherein we have lo&s;t it. And be it remem|bered, that time having been purcha&s;ed for us at &s;o dear a rate, mu&s;t awfully aggravate the condemnation of tho&s;e, who con&s;ume it in the vanities of this world; utterly neglecting the weighty bu&s;ine&s;s properly pertaining to it.

They who have been &s;etting the highe&s;t value on time, and have been the mo&s;t careful in improving it, mu&s;t no doubt &s;ee much re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s

to charge upon them&s;elves. How little have you executed of the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of time? How little good fruit have you brought forth, compared with the religious cultivations with which you have been favored? How many important duties have you omitted, that might have been performed in hours &s;pent in vanity? How much lo&s;t time have you need to redeem? What cau&s;e of humiliation before God, of repairing to the blood of Je&s;us for pardon, and to the king of Zion for fre&s;h &s;trength?&mdash;And are there not &s;ome, who&s;e whole lives unto this day is &s;o much lo&s;t time; who have never yet begun to execute the pro|per work of time? About whom God hath been digging many years, expecting that they &s;hould bear fruit, but who remain unto this day barren trees in his vineyard. Oh con&s;ider! it is through the prevalent interce&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that you have been &s;pared &s;o long. And is he not now coming, &s;eeking the expected fruit from you? And what mu&s;t become of you, &s;hould he refu&s;e to interceed for you this year? Should he pronounce you henceforth <HI>cur&s;ed</HI>? And have you a right to expect any thing better then this? May the thought ef|fectually awaken up your &s;ouls, impre&s;s your minds with a proper &s;en&s;e of the un&s;peakable value of time, and per&s;uade you, from this day

onward, to pur&s;ue with unremitting care and diligence that work, which above every other, claims the attention of man in this his &s;tate of probation.</P>
<P>Finally; let us improve the &s;ubject, to the purpo&s;e of forming wi&s;e re&s;olutions, relative to the improvement of our remaining time; and of beginning this day to carry them into effect. By a little attention to the &s;ubject, you will probably be able to di&s;cover &s;ome of your principal omi&s;&s;ions of duty; and &s;ome of the principal things, that have been wont to con&s;ume your precious time. And as in world|ly concerns, you improve your arrangements for the en&s;uing year, in the light of pa&s;t expe|rience; &s;o much more &s;hould you, in the in|finitely more weighty concerns of the world to come. Remember that you have much lo&s;t time to redeem; make therefore &s;uch arrange|ments, for the management and di&s;po&s;al of your remaining time, as &s;hall the mo&s;t effectu|ally obtain this grand end. Take heed that you di&s;pen&s;e with no duty, whatever &s;elf-denial the performance of it may require. Let every hour, not only have employ, but be devoted to the mo&s;t valuable purpo&s;es. And be deter|mined, &s;trictly to adhere to the &s;y&s;tem you now form, until you &s;ee real cau&s;e for amend|ing it. And Oh! let your arrangements be

made in the light of eternity, and in the pre|&s;ence of omni&s;cience. Let your dependence be on God, and your re&s;olutions firm and de|cided. May &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed reformation be the re&s;ult, as &s;hall with joy be recorded in Heaven, occa&s;ion &s;houts of prai&s;e through all the An|gelic tribes, and march a new and pro&s;perous era in this church.</P>
