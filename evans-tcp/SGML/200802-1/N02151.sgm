&amp; wherewithal &s;hall I be Cloathed?</HI> This Extin|tingui&s;hes the due <HI>Agony</HI> upon, <HI>What &s;hall I do to be Saved</HI>?

<P><PB N="40" REF="002559_0041_0FDB142E31FD2E20">Fir&s;t; <HI>Have ye forgotten the Exhortation that &s;peaks unto you</HI>? 2 Pet. I. 10. <HI>Give Diligence to make your Calling &amp; Election &s;ure.</HI> Were you <HI>Sure,</HI> that you are <HI>Effectually Called,</HI> you may be <HI>Sure,</HI> that you are <HI>Eternally Cho&s;en,</HI> of GOD! You have the <HI>Call</HI> of the Go&s;pel brought unto you. From the time that you give a Proper &amp; an Hearty An&s;wer to the <HI>Call,</HI> you may be <HI>Sure</HI> of This; <HI>Whom He has Prede&s;tinated, them He Called.</HI> You are among the <HI>Elect</HI> of GOD, of whom you are &s;ure, <HI>It is not Po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be De&s;troyed.</HI> Hearken, Hearken then, unto the <HI>Call</HI> of your SAVIOUR. The <HI>Call</HI> of the Go&s;pel is, <HI>Abhor that which is Evil, &amp; thy &s;elf al&s;o for Doing it, and for Departing from the Living GOD.</HI> Mo&s;t Heartily An&s;wer, <HI>Lord, I Abhor it.</HI> The <HI>Call</HI> of the Go&s;pel is, <HI>Embrace the Great Salvation which a JESUS brings unto you; &amp; be glad of the Wi&s;dom, &amp; Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &amp; Holine&s;s, &amp; Redemption, which He has to be|&s;tow upon you.</HI> Mo&s;t Heartily An&s;wer, <HI>Lord, I Embrace it.</HI> The <HI>Call</HI> of the Go&s;pel is, <HI>Re|&s;olve on a Return to GOD, and a Godly &amp; Sober and Righteous Life before Him.</HI> An&s;wer mo&s;t Heartily, <HI>Lord, I Re&s;olve it.</HI> My Friend, If this be thy <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> &amp; if thy <HI>Heart</HI> be in the An&s;wer, thou art then among them that are <HI>partakers of the Heavenly Calling:</HI> And thou &s;halt not mi&s;s of the <HI>Heaven</HI> which thou art <HI>Call'd</HI> unto Do&s;t thou &s;ay, <HI>I do give the An&s;wer,
<PB N="41" REF="002559_0042_0FDB6FF2C1273A20">
but I don't know whether my heart be in it</HI>? Then Repeat the <HI>An&s;wer</HI>; carry on the Repetition of it, until thou do&s;t <HI>know,</HI> that thy <HI>Heart</HI> is in it. This <HI>An&s;wer of a Good Con&s;cience,</HI> will <HI>Bapti&s;e</HI> thee, tor a <HI>Deliverance</HI> from the <HI>Wrath to come.</HI></P>
<P>Again; All turns upon your Compliance, with the <HI>Three Illu&s;trious Articles</HI> of PIETY, which <HI>all that Fear GOD and work Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> are united in. There are <HI>Three Illu&s;trious Ar|ticles,</HI> wherein all the People of our SAVIOUR are <HI>One,</HI> as He has <HI>Interceeded</HI> that they may be. There have been many large Di&s;cour&s;es upon, <HI>The Trial of a Good State</HI>: And &s;ometimes after the Thing has been Largely Di&s;cour&s;ed on, tis left in as much ob&s;curity and perplexity, as it was before. But the mo&s;t <HI>Weighty Que&s;|tion</HI> in the World, will be &s;oon determined by the&s;e Three Enquiries.</P>
<P>Enquire, fir&s;t. <Q>Is it my principal &amp; per|petual Study to Glorify GOD in doing the <HI>Things that plea&s;e Him</HI>? And am I always a|fraid of Every Thing, which the <HI>Light of GOD</HI> in my Soul condemns as an Evil Thing?</Q></P>
<P>Enquire, nextly. <Q>Do I come &amp; look to a Glorious CHRIST, for all the Ble&s;&s;ings of an <HI>Holy Redeemer</HI>; &amp; do I long for nothing &s;o much, as to be what He would have me <HI>to be?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Enquire, la&s;tly. <Q>Do I heartily wi&s;h that my Neighbour may have with me a &s;hare in all the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings of Goodne&s;s</HI>; Pleas'd with his
<PB N="42" REF="002559_0043_0FDB6FF4A86C53E0">
Welfare; Griev'd at his Trouble; not har|bouring any evil Di&s;po&s;ition towards Him?</Q></P>
<P>Soul, If thou art come to the&s;e Things, thou ha&s;t the <HI>Marks of GOD</HI> upon thee; Thou art of the <HI>Righteous Nation,</HI> which the <HI>Gates of the Holy City</HI> forever &s;tand open to. Oh! let nothing pacify thee, till thou find thy &s;elf thus <HI>Marked</HI> of, and for the Lord.</P>
<P>Thirdly. There are various <HI>Acts</HI> of a <HI>Be|liever Living unto GOD.</HI> The Doing of any &s;uch <HI>Acts</HI> will help to &s;how it, and a cour&s;e Abounding and per&s;i&s;ting in &s;uch <HI>Acts,</HI> will indi&s;putably &s;how it, that you are to <HI>Live Eternally.</HI> As now, To do the part of a <HI>Sacri|ficer,</HI> in Patiently and Cheerfully Submitting to the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD, as often as he does with Afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ations <HI>Perform the Thing that is appointed for us</HI>: Willingly to offer up our <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> when our <HI>De&s;irable Things</HI> are taken away with a <HI>Stroke</HI>; Devoutly to find in a CHRIST all the Good which we fondly &s;ought in the things that we have <HI>Sacrificed</HI>: This will determine it, that we have a part in the <HI>Royal Prie&s;thood</HI>; &amp; we &s;hall one day come to &s;erve GOD in His <HI>Temple</HI> which is <HI>Above.</HI></P>
<P>Again; To Realize the <HI>Eye</HI> of GOD upon you in all your ways; to be by the Aw thereof Re&s;train'd from <HI>Evil</HI> ways, and Forwarded in <HI>Good</HI> ways; by this Thought, <HI>GOD &s;ees me; GOD knows what is done in the mo&s;t &s;ecret places</HI>!
<PB N="43" REF="002559_0044_0FDB6FF7A8947938">
To keep a Guard on the very Motions of your <HI>Hearts,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>GOD Looks</HI> upon them! This is the way of none but the <HI>upright in Heart</HI>; the <HI>Good</HI> ones, whom GOD will <HI>do Good</HI> unto.</P>
<P>Moreover, To welcome any <HI>Bitter Thing,</HI> whereby <HI>Sin</HI> may be <HI>Embittered</HI>; and this <HI>Be|cau&s;e</HI> of its being &s;o! To prefer a Sanctified <HI>Adver&s;ity,</HI> before a Secure, Sen&s;ele&s;s, Carnal <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI>: To be Thankful for a <HI>Way hedged with Thorns,</HI> wherein you are kept from <HI>Walk|ing in the vanity of your Minds</HI>! This is not the way of the <HI>Hypocrite</HI></P>
<P>Soul, Here are Symptoms, that thou ha&s;t the <HI>Life of GOD</HI> begun in thee But if thou do&s;t indeed feel thy &s;elf <HI>Living</HI> to GOD, thou may&s;t argue from it, <HI>Now I &s;ee that the Sentence of Death pa&s;&s;ed on me for my Sin, is taken off, &amp; my Sin is all forgiven.</HI> Go on, &amp; argue at this rate; <HI>The Life of GOD thus begun in me, will never Dy: No Death can Ever Extingui&s;h it!</HI></P>
<P>I will add one thing more. Chri&s;tian, Do&s;t thou feel the <HI>Blood</HI> of thy JESUS running warm in the Veins of thy Soul? That is to &s;ay: Does thy Soul clo&s;e with the Intentions on which the <HI>Blood</HI> of thy SAVIOUR has been &s;hed for His people, to <HI>Purify for Him&s;elf a Peculiar People?</HI> Does thy Soul wi&s;h &amp; long &amp; groan for it, that the Spirit of thy SAVI|OUR, would make thee <HI>Like</HI> unto Him, and bring thee to <HI>Hate Wickedne&s;s</HI> &amp; <HI>Love Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="002559_0045_0FDB6FFAAC3AA1C0">
and <HI>always do the Things that plea&s;e the FATHER?</HI> Do&s;t thou <HI>Dy</HI> to Creatures, <HI>and</HI> as this <HI>Death</HI> goes on, is a CHRIST more en|dear'd unto thee; nothing but a CHRIST left <HI>Alive</HI> unto thee? Now tis no longer to be que&s;tion'd, Thou art mo&s;t certainly one of tho&s;e whom thy SAVIOUR has <HI>Died</HI> for. The <HI>Blood</HI> of thy SAVIOUR has been mo&s;t certainly <HI>Sprinkled</HI> upon thee. The <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> is open for thee.</P>
<P>Fourthly. Yea, The <HI>Speaking</HI> of ONE WORD, if the <HI>Word</HI> be but <HI>Heartily Spoken</HI>; This may determine it, That you have <HI>an In|heritance in the Heavens re&s;erved for you.</HI> Such a <HI>Word</HI> as That; P&s;al CXIX. 94 <HI>Lord, I am Thine!</HI> This, This ONE WORD will go very far towards it. ONE WORD, O Soul &s;ol|licitous to <HI>know whither thou art going,</HI> ONE WORD, that &s;hall Declare thee to be among the <HI>Willing People</HI> of thy SAVIOUR; This will determine it. The Experiment &s;hall be made only in Two In&s;tances.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> wherein a Glorious CHRIST is the <HI>Head</HI> of His People, is Propos'd unto thee. It is Propos'd by GOD, <HI>Art thou willing that thy SAVIOUR &s;hould make thee both Righteous &amp; Holy, &amp; both Re&s;tore thee to the Favour of thy GOD, &amp; Re&s;tore to thee His Image; and make thee to be all that He will have His cho&s;en to be</HI>? Now, Heartily Reply this
<PB N="45" REF="002559_0046_0FDB6FFBC5E60E38">
ONE WORD; <HI>Lord Make me willing&punc; Thou ha&s;t Made me willing!</HI> Then ha&s;t thou <HI>Laid Hold on the Covenant</HI>; and thou art <HI>Bound up in the Bundle of Life.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. There is made unto thee a Pro|po&s;al of an <HI>E&s;pou&s;al</HI> unto a Glorious CHRIST, who &s;ays, <HI>I Marry My &s;elf unto thee.</HI> The Propo&s;al of thy SAVIOUR, is; <HI>Art thou wil|ling, That I &s;hould make thee Mine, &amp; by my Spirit Entirely take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of thee</HI>; &amp; <HI>Feed thee, Cloath thee, In&s;truct thee, Protect thee, bring thee to My Fathers Hou&s;e, &amp; Rejoyce in thee forevermore</HI>? Now, Heartily Reply this ONE WORD; <HI>Lord, Make me willing; Thou ha&s;t Made me wil|ling</HI>; Then art thou come into an <HI>E&s;pou&s;al</HI> with a Lord who <HI>hates putting away.</HI> In <HI>Faith|fulne&s;s forever</HI> has He <HI>Bethrothed</HI> thee unto Him&s;elf; &amp; He will no more part with thee, than the <HI>Apple of His Eye.</HI> Oh! Go home Re|joicing; Oh! Carry away with you the <HI>Great Con&s;olations of GOD.</HI> Be not now the Soul that will <HI>Refu&s;e to be Comforted.</HI> A&s;&s;ertion</P>
<P N="5">5. There are many who <HI>Walk in Darkne&s;s,</HI> &amp; yet may <HI>Know whither they are going</HI>: Do <HI>know,</HI> that <HI>Except they do Recent they mu&s;t peri&s;h,</HI> &amp; go down to <HI>Eternal Darkne&s;s!</HI> But yet, this al&s;o mu&s;t have &s;ome Limitation upon it; <HI>None knows,</HI> but that they may yet Repent. I may u&s;e the Language of the Apo&s;tle; <HI>Many Walk, Of whom I have told you Often, Their End is de&s;truction</HI> Are there any, who make a Practice

of tho&s;e Things <HI>for which the Wrath of</HI> GOD <HI>comes on the</HI> Children of Di&s;obedience? Any that abandon them&s;elves to <HI>Tippling,</HI> to <HI>Swearing,</HI> to <HI>Whoring,</HI> to <HI>Stealing,</HI> to <HI>Gaming,</HI> to <HI>Lying,</HI> and &s;uch flagrant Abominations? Any that are <HI>Children of Belial,</HI> and break the Hearts of their Parents by their Vicious cour&s;es? Yea, my Children, Are any of you Strangers to the <HI>Religion of the Clo&s;et</HI>; or &s;uch as never made the Flight of a Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul unto your only SAVIOUR? Ah, Blind Children of <HI>Sor|row.</HI> Don't &s;ay, That you <HI>don't know</HI> what is like to become of you. As Blind as you are, yet you do <HI>know whither you are going.</HI> You do <HI>Know</HI>; for GOD has told you; 1 Cor. VI. 9. <HI>Know ye not, that the</HI> Unrighteous <HI>&s;hall not Inherit the Kingdom of GOD.</HI> You do <HI>Know</HI>; for GOD has told you; Heb XII. 14. <HI>Without Holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI> O <HI>Unhap|py Condition</HI>! Others that are better than you, do not know, but they may Peri&s;h. But you do know, that you mu&s;t Peri&s;h; and your Souls cannot be &s;aved from <HI>Death,</HI> if you be not Converted from the <HI>Error</HI> of your way. You do know, That if you <HI>Dy</HI> as you are, it had been Good for you that you had never been <HI>Born.</HI> Young man, Thou <HI>dost know,</HI> That <HI>GOD will bring thee into Judgment</HI> But a <HI>Judgment,</HI> which is to be <HI>Trembled at.</HI> Thou art wor&s;e than a <HI>Pagan</HI> if thou <HI>Tremble</HI> not!</P>
<P>And yet none of the&s;e forlorn Children are utterly to be de&s;paired of. The wor&s;t of you all, may not Conclude, <HI>I am a Reprobate</HI>! Thou do&s;t <HI>not know,</HI> but that the Powerful and Victorious <HI>Arm</HI> of the Lord, may yet after all, <HI>Turn</HI> thee about, and make a <HI>New Creature</HI> of thee. No one <HI>Knows,</HI> that the&s;e forlorn Children &s;hall go down to the <HI>horrible</HI> Pit, which they appear <HI>bound</HI> unto, For there may <HI>be a Month</HI> in which the Sovereign &amp; Victorious Grace of God may yet find 'em, &amp; there may be <HI>Re&s;erves of Mercy</HI> for them. We will go and Weep unto the Lord, that it may be &s;o.</P>
