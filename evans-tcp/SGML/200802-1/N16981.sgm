<Q>"O! &s;ave my Country, Heav'n!"&mdash;&s;hall be thy la&s;t.</Q>
A youth, beholding the repre&s;entation of this gallant patriot, &s;eems to be &s;truck with admiration, and charmed with delight. A mini&s;|ter diverts his attention to an object of infinitely higher dignity, and greater wonder. If the hero died&mdash;PRO PATRIA, <HI>In defence of his country,</HI> CHRIST died&mdash;PRO INIMICIS, <HI>For the &s;alvation of his enemies.</HI> An in&s;tance this, of &s;uch di&s;intere&s;ted, diffu&s;ive, and di|vine benevolence; as makes all that heroes have achieved, and patri|ots &s;uffered, dwindle into nothing, and &s;carce de&s;erve our notice.</P>

<P>THESE reflections, the one on the <HI>deepe&s;t,</HI> the other on the <HI>gaye&s;t</HI> &s;cenes of nature, when they proceeded privately from the <HI>pen,</HI> were addre&s;&s;ed to a lady of the mo&s;t valuable endowments; who crown|ed all her other endearing qualities, by a fervent love of CHRIST, and an exemplary conformity to his divine pattern. She, alas! lives no longer on earth; unle&s;s it be in the honours of a di&s;tingui&s;hed character, and in the bleeding remembrance of her acquaintance.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible, Madam, to wi&s;h you a richer ble&s;&s;ing, or a more &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s, than that the &s;ame &s;pirit of unfeigned <HI>faith,</HI> the &s;ame cour&s;e of undefiled <HI>religion,</HI> which have enabled her to triumph over death, may both animate and adorn your life.

<P>Long, Madam, may you <HI>bloom</HI> in all the vivacity and amiablene&s;s of youth, like the charming &s;ubject of one of the&s;e contemplations. But at the &s;ame time remember,
<PB N="18" REF="021885_0017_0FB5EFD583FEC420">
that, with regard to &s;uch inferiour accompli&s;hments, you mu&s;t one day <HI>fade,</HI> (may it prove &s;ome very remote pe|riod!) like the mournful objects of the other.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e occa&s;ional meditations, begs leave to remind my readers of their <HI>latter end;</HI> and would invite them to &s;et, not their hou&s;es only, but, which is inexpre&s;&s;ibly more needful, their &s;ouls, in order: That they may be able, through all the intermediate &s;tages, to look forward upon their approaching exit, without any <HI>anxious apprehen|&s;ions;</HI> and, when the great change commences, may bid adieu to terre&s;trial things, with all the <HI>calmne&s;s</HI> of a cheerful re&s;igna|tion, with all the <HI>comforts</HI> of a well grounded faith.</P>
<P>The other attempts to &s;ketch out &s;ome little traces of the <HI>all &s;uf|ficiency</HI> of our <HI>Redeemer,</HI> for the grand and gracious purpo&s;es of everla&s;ting &s;alvation: That a &s;en&s;e of his unutterable dig|nity, and infinite perfections, may incite us to regard him, with &s;entiments of the mo&s;t profound <HI>veneration;</HI> to long for an a&s;|&s;ured intere&s;t in his merits, with all the ardency of <HI>de&s;ire;</HI> and to tru&s;t in his powerful mediation, with an <HI>affiance</HI> not to be &s;haken by any temptations, not to be &s;hared with any perform|ances of our own.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf, that the thoughts conceived among the <HI>tombs</HI> may be welcome to the <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>humane</HI> mind. Becau&s;e, as there are few who have not con&s;igned the remains of &s;ome dear <HI>relations,</HI> or honoured <HI>friends,</HI> to tho&s;e &s;ilent repo&s;itories; &s;o there are none but mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that this is the <HI>hou&s;e ap|pointed for all living;</HI> and that they them&s;elves are &s;hortly to remove into the &s;ame &s;olemn man&s;ions.&mdash;And who would not
<PB N="20" REF="021885_0019_0FB5EFDE4B7939B0">
turn a&s;ide, for a while, from the mo&s;t favourite amu&s;ements, to view the <HI>place</HI> where his once loved <HI>companions</HI> lie? Who would not &s;ometimes &s;urvey tho&s;e <HI>apartments</HI> where he <HI>him|&s;elf</HI> is to take up an <HI>abode,</HI> till time &s;hall be no more?</P>
<P>As to the other little e&s;&s;ay, may I not humbly pre&s;ume, that the very &s;ubject it&s;elf will recommend the remarks? For, who is not delighted with the pro&s;pect of the blooming creation, and even charmed with the <HI>delicate attractions</HI> of flowers? Who does not covet to a&s;&s;emble them in the garden, or wear them in a no&s;egay? Since this is a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o univer&s;al, who would not be willing to render it productive of the &s;ublime&s;t improvement? &mdash;This piece of <HI>holy frugality,</HI> I have ventured to &s;ugge&s;t, and endeavoured to exemplify, in the &s;econd letter; that, while the hand is cropping the tran&s;ient beauties of a flower, the attentive mind may be enriching it&s;elf with &s;olid and la&s;ting good.&mdash;And I cannot but entertain &s;ome plea&s;ing hopes, that the nice&s;t ta&s;te may receive and reli&s;h <HI>religious impre&s;&s;ions,</HI> when they are conveyed by &s;uch <HI>lovely monitors;</HI> when the in&s;tructive le&s;|&s;ons are found, not on the leaves of &s;ome formidable <HI>folio,</HI> but &s;tand legible on the fine <HI>&s;arcenet</HI> of a <HI>Narci&s;&s;us;</HI> when they &s;avour, not of the <HI>lamp</HI> and <HI>reclu&s;e,</HI> but come breathing from the fragrant bo&s;om of a <HI>Jonquil.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">In a LETTER to a LADY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_TRAVELLING lately into <HI>Cornwall,</HI> I happened to alight at a con&s;iderable Village, in that county: Where, finding my&s;elf under an unexpected nece&s;&s;ity of &s;taying a little, I took a walk to the <HI>Church.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I had named, in &s;ome former editions, a particular church, <HI>viz.</HI> KILKHAMPTON; where &s;everal of the monuments, de&s;cribed in the following pages, really exi&s;t. But as I thought it convenient, to mention &s;ome ca&s;es <HI>here,</HI> which are not, according to the be&s;t of my remembrance, referred to in any in&s;criptions <HI>there</HI>; I have now omitted the name. That imagination might operate more freely, and the im|provement of the reader be con&s;ulted, without any thing that &s;hould look like a variation from truth and fact.</NOTE> The doors, like the heaven to which they lead, were wide open; and readily ad|mitted an unworthy &s;tranger. Plea&s;ed with the op|portunity, I re&s;olved to &s;pend a few minutes under the &s;acred roof.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="021885_0025_0FB5EFE80E198328">In a &s;ituation &s;o retired and awful, I could not avoid falling into a train of meditations, <HI>&s;erious</HI> and <HI>mournfully plea&s;ing.</HI> Which, I tru&s;t, were in &s;ome degree profitable to <HI>me,</HI> while they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and warmed my thoughts; and, if they may admini&s;ter any &s;atisfaction to <HI>you,</HI> Madam, now they are recollected, and committed to writing, I &s;hall receive a fre&s;h plea&s;ure from them.</P>
<P>It was an ancient pile; reared by hands, that, ages ago, were mouldered into du&s;t.&mdash;Situate in the centre of a large <HI>burial ground;</HI> remote from all the noi&s;e and hurry of tumultuous life.&mdash;The body &s;pacious; the &s;tructure lofty; the whole magnificently plain. A row of regular pillars extended them&s;elves through the mid&s;t; &s;upporting the roof with &s;implicity, and with dignity.&mdash; The light, that pa&s;&s;ed through the windows, &s;eemed to &s;hed a kind of <HI>luminous Ob&s;curity;</HI> which gave every ob|ject a grave and venerable air.&mdash;The deep <HI>Silence,</HI> added to the gloomy a&s;pect, and both heightened by the lone|line&s;s of the place, greatly increa&s;ed the &s;olemnity of the &s;cene.&mdash;A &s;ort of <HI>religious Dread</HI> &s;tole in&s;en&s;ibly on my mind, while I advanced, all pen&s;ive and thought|ful, along the inmo&s;t ai&s;le. Such a dread, as hu&s;hed every ruder pa&s;&s;ion, and di&s;&s;ipated all the gay images of an alluring world.</P>
<P>Having adored that Eternal Maje&s;ty, who, far from being confined to temples made with hands, has Heaven for his throne, and the Earth for his foot|&s;tool&mdash;I took particular notice of a hand&s;ome <HI>Altar piece</HI>; pre&s;ented, as I was afterwards informed, by the ma&s;ter builders of <HI>Stow</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Name of a grand &s;eat, belonging to the late Earl of <HI>Bath</HI>; remarkable formerly for its excellent workman&s;hip, and elegant fur|niture; once the principal re&s;ort of the quality and gentry of the We&s;t; but now demoli&s;hed, laid even with the ground, and &s;carce one &s;tone left upon another.&mdash;So that corn may grow, or nettles &s;pring, where <HI>Stow</HI> lately &s;tood.</NOTE>; out of gratitude, I pre&s;ume, to that gracious GOD, who carried them through their work, and enabled them to
<Q>bring forth their top&s;tone with joy.</Q></P>
<P>O! HOW amiable is <HI>Gratitude!</HI> e&s;pecially when it has the &s;upreme Benefactor for its object. I have al|ways
<PB N="3" REF="021885_0026_0FB5EFEE52816188">
looked upon gratitude as the mo&s;t exalted princi|ple that can actuate the heart of man. It has &s;ome|thing noble, di&s;intere&s;ted, and (if I may be allowed the Term) generou&s;ly devout. <HI>Repentance</HI> indicates our nature fallen, and <HI>Prayer</HI> turns chiefly upon a regard to one's &s;elf. But the exerci&s;es of gratitude &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in paradi&s;e, when there was no fault to deplore; and will be perpetuated in Heaven, when
<Q>GOD &s;hall be all in all.</Q></P>
<P>The language of this &s;weet temper is,
<Q>I am un|&s;peakably obliged: What return &s;hall I make?</Q>
&mdash; And, &s;urely, it is no improper expre&s;&s;ion of an unfeign|ed thankfulne&s;s, to decorate our Creator's courts, and <HI>beautify</HI> "the <HI>place</HI> where his honour dwelleth." Of old, the habitation of his feet was glorious: Let it not, now, be &s;ordid or contemptible. It mu&s;t grieve an in|genuous mind, and be a reproach to any people, to have their own hou&s;es wain&s;cotted with cedar, and painted with vermillion; while the temple of the Lord of ho&s;ts is de&s;titute of every decent ornament.</P>
<P>Here I recollected, and was charmed with <HI>Solomon</HI>'s fine addre&s;s to the almighty, at the <HI>dedication</HI> of his famous temple. With immen&s;e charge, and exqui&s;ite &s;kill, he had erected the mo&s;t rich and fini&s;hed &s;truc|ture, that the &s;un ever &s;aw. Yet, upon a review of his work, and a reflection on the tran&s;cendent perfections of the Godhead, how he exalts the one and aba&s;es the other!&mdash;The building was too <HI>glorious,</HI> for the mightie&s;t monarch to inhabit; too <HI>&s;acred</HI> for unhallowed feet even to enter; yet infinitely too <HI>mean,</HI> for the Deity to re&s;ide in. It was, and the royal wor&s;hipper acknow|ledged it to be, a mo&s;t marvellous vouch&s;afement in un|created excellency, to "put his name there."&mdash;The whole pa&s;&s;age breathes &s;uch a delicacy, and is animated with &s;uch a &s;ublimity of &s;entiment, that I cannot per|&s;uade my&s;elf to pa&s;s on, without repeating it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Kings,</HI> viii.27. <HI>But will</HI>&mdash;A fine abrupt beginning, mo&s;t &s;ig|nificantly de&s;cribing the amazement and rapture of the royal pro|phet's mind!&mdash;<HI>GOD:</HI> He u&s;es no epithet, where writers of infe|riour di&s;cernment would have been found to multiply them: But &s;peaks of the Deity, as an incomprehen&s;ible Being, who&s;e perfections and glories are exalted above all prai&s;e.&mdash;<HI>Dwell:</HI> To be&s;tow on &s;inful creatures a propitious look; to favour them with a tran&s;ient vi&s;it of kindne&s;s; even this were an unutterable obligation. Will he then vouch&s;afe to fix his abode among them, and take up his &s;tated re&s;i|dence with them?&mdash;<HI>Indeed:</HI> A word, in this connexion, peculiarly emphatical; expre&s;&s;ive of a conde&s;cen&s;ion, wonderful and extraordinary almo&s;t beyond all credibility. <HI>Behold:</HI> intimating the continued, or rather the increa&s;ing &s;urpri&s;e of the &s;peaker, and awakening the attention of the hearer. <HI>Behold! the Heaven:</HI> The &s;pacious concave of the firmament; that wide extended azure circumference, in which worlds unnumbered perform their revolutions, is too &s;canty an apartment for the Godhead.&mdash;Nay, <HI>The Heaven of Heavens:</HI> Tho&s;e va&s;tly higher tracts, which be far beyond the limits of human &s;urvey; to which our very thoughts can hardly &s;oar: even the&s;e (unbounded as they are) cannot afford an adequate habitation for JEHOVAH; even the&s;e dwindle into a point, when compared with the infinitude of his e&s;&s;ence; even the&s;e
<Q>are as nothing before him.</Q>
&mdash;<HI>How much le&s;s</HI> proportionate is this poor diminutive &s;peek (which I have been erecting and embelli&s;hing), to &s;o augu&s;t a Pre&s;ence, &s;o immen&s;e a Maje&s;ty!</NOTE><HI>But will

<P>We are apt to be &s;truck with admiration at the &s;tate|line&s;s and grandeur of a ma&s;terly performance in archi|tecture. And, perhaps on a &s;ight of the ancient Sanc|tuary, &s;hould have made the <HI>&s;uperficial</HI> ob&s;ervation of the di&s;ciples;
<Q>What manner of &s;tones, and what build|ings are here!</Q>
&mdash;But what a <HI>nobler</HI> turn of thought, and <HI>ju&s;ter</HI> ta&s;te of things, does it di&s;cover; to join with <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s king, in celebrating the conde&s;cen&s;ion of the Di|vine Inhabitant! That the High and Lofty One, who fills immen&s;ity with his glory, &s;hould, in a peculiar manner, fix his abode there! Should <HI>there</HI> manife&s;t an extraordinary degree of his benedictive pre&s;ence; per|mit &s;inful mortals to approach his Maje&s;ty; and promi&s;e "to make them joyful in his hou&s;e of prayer!&mdash;<HI>This</HI> &s;hould more &s;en&s;ibly affect our hearts, than the mo&s;t cu|rious arrangement of &s;tones can delight our eyes.</P>
<P>Nay, the everla&s;ting GOD does not di&s;dain to dwell in our <HI>&s;ouls</HI> by his holy &s;pirit; and to make even our
<PB N="5" REF="021885_0028_0FB5EFF2A6B27A98">
<HI>bodies</HI> his temple.&mdash;Tell me, ye that frame critical judg|ments, and balance nicely the di&s;tinction of things; "Is this mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing or mo&s;t rejoicing?"&mdash;He hum|bleth him&s;elf, the &s;cripture a&s;&s;ures us, even to behold the things that are in Heaven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxiii.6.</NOTE>.

Be this my portion, and I &s;hall not covet crowns, nor envy conquerors.</P>
<P>But let me remember, what a <HI>&s;anctity</HI> of di&s;po&s;ition, and <HI>uprightne&s;s</HI> of conver&s;ation, &s;o exalted a relation de|mands: Remember this, "and rejoice with trembling." &mdash;Dur&s;t I commit any iniquity, while I tread the&s;e hallow|ed courts? could the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> high prie&s;t allow him&s;elf in any known tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, while he made that &s;olemn yearly entrance<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix.7.</NOTE> into the Holy of Holies, and &s;tood before the immediate pre&s;ence of <HI>JEHOVAH?</HI> No, truly.

<P>The next thing, which engaged my attention, was the <HI>lettered floor.</HI> The pavement, &s;omewhat like <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s roll, was written over from one end to the other. I &s;oon perceived the compari&s;on to hold good, in another re|&s;pect; and the in&s;criptions to be matter of
<Q>Mourning, lamentation, <HI>and</HI> woe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. ii.10.</NOTE>.</Q>
They &s;eemed to court my ob&s;ervation; &s;ilently inviting me to read them. And what would the&s;e dumb monitors inform me of?&mdash;

<P>By this interpretation, the text, I think, is cleared of its ob&s;curity and appears both truely &s;ublime, and perfectly ju&s;t.</P>
<P>May I be pardoned the <HI>digre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and acquitted from <HI>pre&s;umption,</HI> if, on this occa&s;ion, I take leave to animadvert upon what &s;eems har&s;h and unnatural in the common expo&s;ition of the la&s;t ver&s;e of this P&s;alm? All the commentators (as many, at lea&s;t, as I have con|&s;ulted) inform their readers, that to <HI>drink of the brook in the way,</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>to undergo &s;ufferings and death.</HI> Which, in my opinion, is a con&s;truction extremely forced, and hardly &s;upportable; altogether remote from the import of &s;uch poetical forms of diction, cu&s;|tomary among the ea&s;tern nations. In tho&s;e &s;ultry climes, nothing could be more welcome to the traveller, than a brook &s;treaming near his paths. To quench his thir&s;t, and lave his feet, in the cool|ing current, was one of the greate&s;t refre&s;hments imaginable, and re|animated him to pur&s;ue his journey. For which rea&s;on, among others, brooks are a very favourite image with the in&s;pired penmen; u&s;ed to denote a &s;ituation <HI>fertile</HI> and <HI>delightful,</HI> or a &s;tate of <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>&s;ati&s;|faction</HI>; but never, that I can recollect, to picture out the contrary condition of tribulation and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>

But then they are not <GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;Streams &s;o <HI>calm,</HI> that they keep within their banks, and glide quietly by the traveller's foot&s;teps; &s;o <HI>clear,</HI> that they are fit for the wayfaring man's u&s;e, and invite his lips to a draught; both which notions are plainly implied in the text.&mdash;They are rather&mdash; <GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;<HI>boi&s;terous billows</HI>; bur&s;ting over a &s;hip or da&s;hing them&s;elves, with dreadful impetuo&s;ity, upon the &s;hore: Or&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;<HI>&s;weeping in|undations</HI>; which bear down all before them, and drown the neighbour|ing country.&mdash;Be&s;ides, in the&s;e in&s;tances of horrour, we never find the word&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;<HI>He &s;hall drink</HI>; which conveys a plea&s;ing idea (un|le&s;s when it relates to a cup, filled with bitter, intoxicating, or im|poi&s;oned liquors; a ca&s;e quite different from that under con&s;ideration) but either&mdash;<GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;which imports <HI>terrour</HI> and <HI>a&s;toni&s;hment,</HI> or el&s;e&mdash; <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">&mdash;which &s;ignify to <HI>ru&s;h upon,</HI> to <HI>overwhelm,</HI> and even to <HI>bury</HI> under the waves.</P>

<P>Here, I was reminded of the various expedients which providence, un&s;earchably wi&s;e, u&s;es, to <HI>fructify</HI> both the material and intellectual world.&mdash;Sometimes, you &s;hall have <HI>impetuous</HI> and heavy <HI>&s;howers,</HI> bur&s;ting from the an|gry clouds.

They &s;teal down by &s;low degrees, and with in&s;en&s;ible &s;tillne&s;s. So &s;ubtle, that they deceive the nice&s;t eye; &s;o &s;ilent, that they e&s;cape the mo&s;t deli|cate ear: And when fallen, &s;o very light, that they nei|ther brui&s;e the tendere&s;t, nor oppre&s;s the weake&s;t flower. &mdash;Very <HI>different</HI> operations!

It is my &s;tedfa&s;t opinion, that the world, at lea&s;t this lower world, with its vari|ous appurtenances, was intended <HI>purely</HI> for man; that it is <HI>appro|priated</HI> to him; and that he (in &s;ubordination to GOD's glory) is the <HI>end</HI> of its creation.&mdash;Other animals, it is true, partake of the Creator's benefits; but then, they partake, under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">otion of man's dome&s;ticks, or on the foot of retainers to him; as crea|tures which bear &s;ome relation to his &s;ervice, and &s;ome way or other contribute to his good. So that, &s;till, he is the <HI>centre</HI> of the whole; or, as our incomparable <HI>Milton,</HI> equally ma&s;ter of poetry and divinity, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, <HI>All things live for man. Par. Lo&s;t,</HI> B. XI.161.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Pope,</HI> in his ethick epi&s;tles, is plea&s;ed to explode this tenet, as the height of <HI>pride,</HI> and a gro&s;s <HI>ab&s;urdity.</HI>&mdash;For my part, I &s;ee no rea&s;on for &s;uch a charge. With all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;o &s;uperiour a genius, it &s;eems very remote from pride, to be duly &s;en&s;ible of fa|vours vouch&s;afed; to contemplate them in all the extent of their munificence, and acknowledge them accordingly. I &s;hould rather imagine, that to contract their &s;ize, when they are immen&s;ely large; to &s;tint their number, when they are altogether innumerable; that &s;uch a procedure favours more of <HI>in&s;en&s;ibility,</HI> than our hypothe&s;is of pre|&s;umption; and has more in it of <HI>ingratitude,</HI> than that of arrogance.</P>
<P>And how can it be deemed an ab&s;urdity, to maintain that GOD gave us <HI>a world</HI> for our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when it is our duty to believe, that he gave us his <HI>only &s;on,</HI> for our propitiation? Sure, it can be neither difficult, nor extravagant to &s;uppo&s;e, that he de&s;igned the habitable globe, with its whole furniture, for our pre&s;ent u&s;e, &s;ince he withheld not his holy child JESUS, but freely delivered him up, for our final &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I cannot but conclude, that the attempt of our famous poet is neither <HI>kind,</HI> with regard to his fellow creatures &mdash;nor <HI>grateful,</HI> with regard to his Creator&mdash;neither is his &s;cheme, in fact, <HI>true.</HI> The attempt not <HI>kind,</HI> with regard to man; becau&s;e, it robs him of one of the mo&s;t delightful and ravi&s;hing contempla|tions imaginable. To con&s;ider the great author of exi&s;tence, as hav|ing <HI>me</HI> in his eye, when he formed univer&s;al nature; as contriving all things, with an immediate view to the exigencies of my par|ticular &s;tate; and making them all in &s;uch a manner, as might be mo&s;t conducive to my particular advantage: This mu&s;t occa&s;ion the &s;tronge&s;t &s;atisfactions, whenever I ca&s;t a glance on the objects that &s;urround me&mdash;Not <HI>grateful,</HI> with regard to GOD; becau&s;e it has the mo&s;t direct tendency to dimini&s;h our &s;en&s;e of his kindne&s;s, and by that means to throw a damp upon our gratitude. It teaches us to look upon our&s;elves, as almo&s;t lo&s;t among a croud of other beings, or regarded only with an occa&s;ional and incidental beneficence. Which mu&s;t certainly weaken the di&s;po&s;ition, and indeed &s;lacken the ties to the mo&s;t adoring thankfulne&s;s.&mdash;To which, I apprehend, we may ju&s;tly add, Neither is the &s;cheme, in fact, <HI>true.</HI> For, not to mention what might be urged from the &s;ure word of revelation, this one argument appears &s;ufficiently conclu&s;ive. The world began with man; the world mu&s;t cea&s;e with man; con&s;equently, the grand u&s;e, the principal end of the world, is, to &s;ub&s;erve the intere&s;t of man. It is on all &s;ides agreed, that the edifice was erected, when man was to be furni&s;hed with an habitation; and that it will be demoli&s;hed, when man has no farther need of its accommodations. When he enters into the hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens, "the earth, and all the works that are therein, &s;hall be burnt up." From which it &s;eems a very obvious and fair deduction, that man is the <HI>final cau&s;e</HI> of this inferiour creation.</P>

<HEAD>TO PAUL ORCHARD, OF STOKE ABBEY, in DEVONSHIRE, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS your honoured father was plea&s;ed to make choice of me to an&s;wer in your name at the font, and to exerci&s;e a &s;ort of <HI>guardian&s;hip</HI> over your &s;piritual intere&s;ts; permit me, by putting the&s;e little treati&s;es into your hand, to fulfil &s;ome part of that &s;olemn obligation.</P>
<P><HI>Gratitude</HI> for many &s;ignal favours, and a con&s;cientious regard to my &s;acred engagement, have long ago in&s;pired my brea&s;t with the warme&s;t wi&s;hes, both for your true <HI>dignity,</HI> and real <HI>happine&s;s.</HI> Nor can I think of a more endearing, or a more effectual way, of advancing either the one or the other, than to &s;et before you a &s;ketch of your excellent <HI>father's</HI> character.&mdash;Illu&s;trious examples are the mo&s;t winning incitements to virtue. And none can come attended with &s;uch particular recommendations to YOU, Sir, as the pattern of that worthy per&s;on, from whom you derive your very being.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t cordial, and reverential e&s;teem for the <HI>Divine Word,</HI> was one of his remarkable qualities. Tho&s;e, or|cles of Heaven were his principal delight, and his in&s;ep|arable

companions. Your gardens, your &s;olitary walks, and the hedges of your fields, can witne&s;s,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h. xxiv.27.</NOTE> with what an unwearied a&s;&s;iduity he exerci&s;ed him&s;elf in the law of the LORD. From hence he fetched his maxims of wi&s;dom, and formed his judgment of things. The &s;acred <HI>precepts,</HI> were the model of his temper, and the guide of his life; while the precious <HI>promi&s;es</HI> were the joy of his heart, and his portion for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Improving company</HI> was another of his mo&s;t reli&s;hing plea&s;ures. Few gentlemen were better furni&s;hed, either with richne&s;s of fancy, or copiou&s;ne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, to bear a &s;hining part in conver&s;ation. With the&s;e talents, he always endeavoured to give &s;ome <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> generally &s;ome <HI>religious,</HI> turn to the di&s;cour&s;e. Nor did he ever reflect, with greater complacency on his &s;ocial hours, than when they tended to glorify the Eternal Maje&s;ty; and to awaken, in him&s;elf and others, a more lively &s;pir|it of devotion.</P>
<P>To project for the good of others, was his frequent &s;tudy; and to carry tho&s;e benevolent contrivances into execution, his favourite employ. When vi&s;ited by the young per&s;ons of the neighbourhood, far from taking an ungraceful pride to initiate them in debauchery, or con|firm them in a riotous habit, it was his ince&s;&s;ant aim, by finely adapted per&s;ua&s;ives, to encourage them in <HI>in|du&s;try,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;h them in a cour&s;e of <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">briety;</HI> to <HI>guard</HI> them again&s;t the allurements of vice, and <HI>animate</HI> them with the principles of piety. A noble kind of ho&s;pi|tality this! which will probably tran&s;mit its beneficial influence to their earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; to their future families; and even to their everla&s;ting &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="021885_0188_0FB5F2DB68C7CDD8">A conviction of human indigence, and a thorough per&s;ua&s;ion of the divine all &s;ufficiency, induced him to be <HI>frequent in prayer.</HI> To pro&s;trate him&s;elf, in profound adoration, before that infinitely exalted being, who dwells in light inacce&s;&s;ible, was <HI>his glory;</HI> to implore the continuance of the Almighty favour, and the increa&s;e of all chri&s;tian graces, was <HI>his gain.</HI> In tho&s;e moments, no doubt, he remembered you, Sir, with a particular ear|ne&s;tne&s;s; and lodged many an ardent petition in the court of Heaven, for his infant &s;on. Cea&s;e not to &s;ec|ond them with your own devout &s;upplications, that they may de&s;cend upon your head, "in the fulne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel of peace."</P>
<P>To give their genuine lu&s;tre to all his other endow|ments, he was careful to maintain an <HI>humble mind.</HI> Though his friends might admire his &s;uperiour abilities, or his acquaintance applaud his exemplary behaviour, he &s;aw how far he <HI>fell &s;hort</HI> of the mark of his high call|ing; &s;aw, and lamented his defects; &s;aw, and renounced him&s;elf; relying, for final acceptance, and endle&s;s felicity, on a <HI>better righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> than his own; even on the tran|&s;cendently perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, and inconceivably prec|ious death, of JESUS the Redeemer. This was the rock of his hope, and the very crown of his rejoicing.</P>
<P>The&s;e, Sir, are &s;ome of the <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hed</HI> characteri&s;ticks of your decea&s;ed parent. As you had the misfortune to lo&s;e &s;o valuable a relative, before you was capable of form|ing any acquaintance with his per&s;on; I flatter my&s;elf, you will the more attentively ob&s;erve his picture. This his <HI>moral picture</HI>; de&s;igned, not to be &s;et in gold, or &s;par|kle

in enamel, but to breathe in your &s;pirit, and to live in all your conduct.&mdash;Which, though it be entirely your own, calculated purely for your&s;elf, may po&s;&s;ibly (like the family pieces in your parlour, that glance an eye upon as many as enter the room) make &s;ome <HI>plea&s;ing and u&s;eful</HI> impre&s;&s;ion on every beholder.&mdash;May every one, charmed with the beautiful image, catch its re&s;emblance; and each, in his re&s;pective &s;phere, "go and do likewi&s;e."</P>

That mighty hand, which once opened the windows from on high, and broke up the fountains of the great deep, will then unlock all the <HI>magazines</HI> of <HI>fire,</HI> and pour a <HI>&s;econd deluge</HI> upon the earth. The vengeful flames, kindled by the breath to the Almighty, &s;pread them&s;elves from the centre to the circumference. Noth|ing can with&s;tand their impetuo&s;ity; nothing can e&s;cape their rage. Univer&s;al de&s;olation attends their progre&s;s. Magnificent palaces, and &s;olemn temples, are laid in a&s;hes. Spacious cities, and impregnable towers, are mingled in one &s;moking ma&s;s. Not only the productions of <HI>human art,</HI> but the works of <HI>Almighty power,</HI> are

Our fields and gardens, lately bur|ied beneath the drifted heaps, ri&s;e plain and di&s;tinct to view.&mdash;Since we &s;ee nature once again, has &s;he no verdant traces, no beautiful features left? They are, like real friends, very rare; and therefore the more par|ticularly to be regarded, the more highly to be valued. &mdash;Here and there, the <HI>holly</HI> hangs out her glowing ber|ries; the <HI>lauru&s;tinus</HI> &s;preads her graceful tufts; and both under a covert of unfading foliage.&mdash;The plain, but hardy <HI>ivy</HI> clothes the decrepid, crazy wall; nor &s;hrinks from the friendly office, though the &s;kies frown, and the &s;torm roars.&mdash;The <HI>laurel,</HI> firm, erect, and bold, expands its leaf of vivid green. In &s;pite of the united, the repeated attacks of wind, and rain, and fro&s;t, it pre&s;erves an undi&s;mayed lively look; and maintains its po&s;t, while withering millions fall around. Worthy, by vanqui&s;hing the rugged force of winter, worthy to adorn the triumphant conqueror's brow.&mdash;Nor mu&s;t I forget the <HI>baytree,</HI> which &s;corns to be a mean pen&s;ioner on a few tran&s;ient &s;unny gleams; or, with a &s;ervile ob&s;equi|ou&s;ne&s;s, to vary its appearance, in conformity to the changing &s;ea&s;ons. By &s;uch indications of &s;terling worth, and &s;taunch re&s;olution, reading a lecture to the poet's genius, while it weaves the chaplet for his temples. &mdash;The&s;e, and a few other plants, clad with native ver|dure, retain their comely a&s;pect, in the bleake&s;t climes, and in the colde&s;t months.</P>
