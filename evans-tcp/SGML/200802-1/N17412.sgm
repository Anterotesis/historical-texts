<BIBL>PROVERBS, CHAP. 8, VERSE 16.</BIBL>
<Q>BY ME PRINCES RULE, AND NOBLES, EVEN ALL THE JUDGES OF THE EARTH.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN compliance with the laudable example of our pious Ance&s;tors, on &s;uch joyful anniver&s;ary occa&s;ions as this day pre&s;ents us with&mdash;we have a&s;&s;embled in the Hou&s;e of GOD, to offer our de|vout prai&s;es to him for what he has done for them, and for us, their children; to &s;eek his direction and ble&s;&s;ing upon our Political Fathers here pre|&s;ent, in the di&s;charge of the important tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in them, and his &s;miles on this confederat|ed ri&s;ing Republic.</P>
<P>AND as it has fallen to one of the lea&s;t of the Amba&s;&s;adors of CHRIST, to perform &s;o e&s;&s;ential a part of the exerci&s;e of the day, it will not be ex|pected that he turn State&s;man in this &s;acred place, or wander into all the affairs of government: But, in compliance with his character as a Mini|&s;ter, make &s;uch ob&s;ervations from the &s;acred text,
<PB N="6" REF="022506_0005_0FB947A36ACF51F0">
as may be profitable for direction and encourage|ment, that the men of GOD here pre&s;ent, may be furni&s;hed to every good work.</P>
<P>THIS book was pen'd by King Solomon&mdash;a man famed for wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding through|out all the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>THAT BEING who has an ea&s;y acce&s;s to the human mind, appeared to him in Gibeon, in a vi&s;ion of the night; and GOD &s;aid, a&s;k what I &s;hall give thee? And his reque&s;t, "give therefore thy &s;ervant an under&s;tanding heart," was &s;o ac|ceptable, that GOD gave him wi&s;dom above all that were before him in Jeru&s;alem; for the peo|ple &s;oon perceived "that the wi&s;dom of GOD was in him to do judgment."</P>
<P>IN the&s;e Proverbs of the wi&s;e man, we have the comprehen&s;ive duties we owe to GOD, and the world, made plain and ea&s;y, and enforced with the mo&s;t powerful motives. By folly, the Preacher would be under&s;tood to mean vice and wicked|ne&s;s&mdash;and by wi&s;dom, grace and CHRIST.</P>
<P>IN the text, the per&s;on &s;peaking is doubtle&s;s JESUS CHRIST, who by the Apo&s;tle, is called "the wi&s;dom of GOD, and the power of GOD." "By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth:" That is, by my Providence
<PB N="7" REF="022506_0006_0FB947A4E0E55B30">
and appointment, they are advanced to rule and govern; and their government is merciful and righteous, happy and pro&s;perous, by my council and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>EVER &s;ince the apo&s;tacy, the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, has pur&s;ued an uniform plan of grace, and govern|ment with the church, and the world. The merciful de&s;ign of which, is to reduce to order, peace and happine&s;s, his intelligent offspring.&mdash;To pro&s;ecute this de&s;ign, he has &s;ent into the world the "PRINCE of PEACE," and given him a commi&s;&s;ion for acts of mini&s;try and grace&mdash;magi&s;tracy and government.</P>
<P>THE intervention of the new covenant, and the advent of JESUS its Mediator, gave birth to order and &s;ubordination in Heaven, and upon Earth.</P>
<P>IN Heaven there are thrones, dominions, princi|palities and powers, angels and arch-angels; and upon earth, princes, nobles, and judges&mdash;and CHRIST is Head over them all.</P>
<P>THE text leads us to &s;peak of civil government, as ordained of GOD, in the hands of the Mediator; of civil rulers, as holding their commi&s;&s;ion and authority under CHRIST; of their duty and dig|nity as his Mini&s;ters, and of the duty and privi|lege of the people under their admini&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="022506_0007_0FB947A6C7202C48">
I. THAT civil government is ordained of GOD in the hands of the Mediator, the ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity of order and government, for the exi&s;tence and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, pleads its divine origi|nal: For without it; the affairs of mankind would fall into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion and di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE nature of man, as a &s;ociable creature, would no doubt, have led him to &s;ome &s;ort of go|vernment, had &s;in never entered the world. But &s;ince &s;in has deba&s;ed the noble nature of man, and &s;pread it&s;elf through the whole world&mdash;both rea&s;on and revelation plead for government.</P>
<P>IT is not a matter of human prudence only, but of nece&s;&s;ity and moral obligation: And being enjoined by him who rules in the kingdoms of mortal men, it is an important mean of delivering us from the evils of the apo&s;tacy; and de&s;igned to prepare us for the more encouraging re&s;traints the go&s;pel enjoins.</P>
<P>CIVIL government, then, is a branch of the tree of life, and founded in, and built upon that covenant, &s;ealed in Heaven by the oath of GOD, and upon earth by the blood of CHRIST.</P>
<P>HE being commi&s;&s;ioned by the Father to manage the great affairs of Empire, as well as of Zion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="022506_0008_0FB947A7F3DB6BD0">
"YET have I &s;et my King upon my holy Hill of Zion."&mdash;"The government &s;hall be upon his &s;houlders."</P>
<P>THE kingdom of CHRIST, where he rules by his word and &s;pirit, is his Church, a &s;piritual kingdom. But his commi&s;&s;ion extends to the utmo&s;t ends of the earth.</P>
<P>"FOR the &s;tone cut out of the mountain with|out hands, is to break in pieces all other king|doms, and fill the earth."</P>
<P>HIS kingdom will outlive all other kingdoms, and &s;wallow them up; for he mu&s;t reign till he hath "put down all rule and all authority and power."</P>
<P>THIS implies that rule and authority among men, or which is the &s;ame thing, civil govern|ment, is a divine appointment, and that it is put into the hands of the Mediator to rule and go|vern the world. For when the great and impor|tant ends for which he received his mediatorial kingdom, &s;hall be accompli&s;hed&punc; he will put down both mini&s;try and magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>II. THAT civil rulers hold their commi&s;|&s;ion and authority under CHRIST.</P>
<P>NOT that CHRIST has pointed out the form of government, or the per&s;ons to rule and go|vern;
<PB N="10" REF="022506_0009_0FB947A95DAC0220">
in this &s;en&s;e his "kingdom is not of this world." But chri&s;tianity enforces the law of na|ture; and has confirmed the &s;everal con&s;titutions of &s;tates and kingdoms, and called our obedience to the higher powers, as the go&s;pel finds them.</P>
<P>THE mode of government, and per&s;ons to go|vern, are &s;ubmitted to the wi&s;dom of men, in pur&s;uance of a divine ordinance, that &s;econd cau&s;es might operate. It being the method of GOD to carry on the de&s;igns of his government in this world, by the in&s;trumentality of &s;ubordinate Agents. When therefore, a people unite in a form of government, and choo&s;e per&s;ons to rule and govern them, and pledge their faith to be obe|dient to, and &s;upport the government, "though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man di&s;annulleth or addeth thereunto&punc;"</P>
<P>THE Magi&s;trate then, called to office by the voice of the people, and &s;olemnly &s;worn, becomes an ordinance of GOD, and receives his authority from him, "by whom Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth."</P>
<P>AND the Apo&s;tle, when he enjoins obedience to civil rulers, "becau&s;e the powers that be, are or|dained of GOD," means to include in his idea, the methods by which they become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their power, and likewi&s;e the u&s;e and improvement
<PB N="11" REF="022506_0010_0FB947AAE78821E8">
they make of it: If they rule for GOD, and for good to the people, they are to be &s;ubjected to, otherwi&s;e, "we ought to obey GOD, rather than men."</P>
<P>III. WE come to &s;peak of the duty and digni|ty of civil rulers, as the mini&s;ters of CHRIST.</P>
<P>1&s;t. IT is their duty to uphold the kingdom of CHRIST, which con&s;i&s;ts in "righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace, and joy in the HOLY GHOST."</P>
<P>RELIGION is, and ever has been, con&s;idered the glory of a people; as it in&s;ures the favour and protection of Heaven.</P>
<P>UNDER the former di&s;pen&s;ation, the Ark of GOD, which contained his laws, was a token of his pre&s;ence and defence. Governour Eli, who&s;e heart trembled for it, &s;u&s;tained the tidings of the of the death of his two Sons with fortitude; but when it was told him that the Ark of GOD was taken, he fell and died, and his Daughter refu&s;ed to be comforted, though a Son was born; becau&s;e the glory was departed from I&s;rael, and the Ark of GOD was taken.</P>
<P>UNDER this di&s;pen&s;ation, the go&s;pel and its ordinances, are our glory and defence. And as magi&s;trates are honoured by CHRIST, and act under his banner, they &s;hould be careful to be his glory, and &s;upport his religion in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="022506_0011_0FB947AE2F298068">
ALL men &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a principle of piety and virtue; but none &s;tand in greater need of it than tho&s;e who are called to rule and govern.</P>
<P>RELIGION dignifies and enobles the mind&mdash;refines and purifies the heart&mdash;fits men to act worthily their part on the &s;tage of life, and &s;hines with a peculiar lu&s;tre in the chri&s;tian magi&s;trate&punc; This will procure for them honour in the &s;ight of all men; "for tho&s;e that honour m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, I will honour."</P>
<P>SAUL was de&s;titute of this principle; but de|&s;irous of its fruits and effects. Therefore he pre&s;&s;ed the man of GOD, and laid hold on the &s;kirt of his mantle, and it rent; &s;aying "honour me now I pray thee, before the Elders of my people."</P>
<P>THIS is the way to have the pre&s;ence, and ble&s;&s;ing of GOD with them, and upon their ad|mini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE &s;eat of the magi&s;trate is called the throne of GOD; "and he was caught up unto GOD, and into his throne." As they have the image of GOD upon them as his Mini&s;ters, and act by his authority, it &s;hould be their care to have the image of GOD within them as men.</P>
<P>IT is an honourable account we have of Judah, in a time of general revolt, the ten tribes went
<PB N="13" REF="022506_0012_0FB947B29DEBAEE8">
after Jeroboam; "but Judah yet ruleth with GOD, and is faithful with the &s;aints."</P>
<P>IF religion is not honoured and &s;upported by men in places of public tru&s;t, the glory of the LORD will &s;oon depart, and the fire of GOD be &s;cattered over the city.</P>
<P>RULERS are called "the &s;hields of the earth;" they are to protect the people from injuries among men, and likewi&s;e from the judgments of GOD. When GOD's wrath was kindled again&s;t I&s;rael, for their idolatry at the foot of the mount, we find Mo&s;es, that pious ruler, pleading the cau&s;e of the people, and he founds his plea upon GOD's covenant, and reminds him of his oath. And David, that man after GOD's own heart, when he &s;aw the Angel that &s;mote the people, &s;aid, but the&s;e &s;heep, what have they done? "And the LORD &s;aid unto the Angel, it is enough, &s;tay now thine hand."</P>
<P>THE attention chri&s;tian rulers pay to religion in their hearts, and in their government, will be their &s;upport when they are called to lay down their commi&s;&s;ion, and their lives; it will brighten the &s;cene before them, and embalm their memo|ries when they are dead.</P>
<P>2d. IT is the duty of chri&s;tian rulers, to pre|&s;erve and &s;ecure to the people, their liberties and properties.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="022506_0013_0FB947B5AF9F3920">
THE end and de&s;ign of civil government is to &s;ecure the happine&s;s of the whole community. For this, rulers are appointed; "he is the Mini&s;ter of GOD to thee <HI>for good."</HI></P>
<P>THE liberties of mankind have ever been held dear, for they are given by GOD and nature. "With a great &s;um, obtained I this freedom," &s;ays the chief Captain to Paul, who replied, "but I was born free."</P>
<P>THIS has been and &s;till is the voice of Ameri|cans; and our attention to this voice, which is from Heaven, has brought us into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the liberties and privileges, we this day enjoy.</P>
<P>AN infringement on the&s;e, has ever awakened the fears, and kindled the re&s;entment of an en|lightened people!&mdash;It has overturned empires and kingdoms&mdash;cau&s;ed the &s;tars to fall from Hea|ven, and princes to walk, as at this day, like &s;er|vants on the earth!</P>
<P>IN order to &s;ecure the liberties and privileges of the people, righteous and equitable laws &s;hould be made, and pre&s;erved.&mdash;"That which is alto|gether ju&s;t &s;hall ye follow," is an injunction from the Fir&s;t Magi&s;trate in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>WE plead for a government of laws, not of men. The law is a rule to try all cau&s;es be|tween man and man by; and it is a rule between
<PB N="15" REF="022506_0014_0FB947B6E59C8A40">
the magi&s;trate and &s;ubject&mdash;it teaches the one how to rule, and the other how to obey.</P>
<P>THEY are the pillars on which the Common|wealth &s;tands; to them we appeal for a redre&s;s of grievances, and into their hands we are willing to fall; but not into the hands of men. They are in &s;cripture, called the foundations of the earth; and &s;aid to be out of cour&s;e, when the magi&s;trate is either ignorant of them, or neglects to &s;upport his authority in their execution.</P>
<P>3d. THE chri&s;tian ruler will hear the com|plaints, and redre&s;s the grievances of the people he governs.</P>
<P>HE will not with Rehoboam, reject the voice of the old men who&s;e years have taught them wi&s;dom, and apply to young men for coun|&s;el; an&s;wer the people with grievous words, and cau&s;e them to &s;ay in the bitterne&s;s of their &s;ouls, "what portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e." But he will enlighten the ignorant; and tho&s;e that are out of the way, he will reduce to order and obedience, with the cords of law and love. He will follow the example of him by whom he rules, who&s;e work and glory it is, to make peace and bind up the wounds of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="022506_0015_0FB947B86592BA88">
CHRISTIAN rulers will con&s;ider the infancy of the people, and the burdens laid upon them, and be careful le&s;t they over-drive, and &s;o de&s;troy the flock of GOD.</P>
<P>THEY will le&s;&s;en the charges of government, and lighten every burden, as much as is con&s;i&s;t|ent with the honour and well-being of govern|ment.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;e of the widow, the fatherle&s;s, the orphan, the &s;oldier, and him that has loaned his money for the help of government, will come with peculiar grace before chri&s;tian rulers; who will hold them&s;elves Heaven's clients to vindi|cate their righteous claims, and plead their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE credit of the Commonwealth, at home and abroad, is a matter that requires particular attention: In many in&s;tances its faith has been pledged. But chri&s;tian rulers will remem|ber, that our father Abraham, was not ju&s;tified by faith only; and add energy to our faith, that we may as a people, be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of GOD, and the world.</P>
<P>4th. WE come as propo&s;ed, to &s;peak of the duty and privilege of the people under the ad|mini&s;tration of chri&s;tian rulers. And</P>
<P>1&s;t. IT is their duty to pray for them.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT is an important tru&s;t, and though it be limitted by righteous and equitable
<PB N="17" REF="022506_0016_0FB947B9F1D5B4A8">
laws; yet &s;uch is the condition of human na|ture in this world, that the greate&s;t and be&s;t of men are liable to err, and are in&s;ufficient to ma|nage the great affairs of &s;tate, without direction and influence from Heaven.</P>
<P>GOD is the ble&s;&s;ed and only potentate&mdash;his e&s;&s;ential perfections are his ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and enable him to manage an univer&s;al Empire! He &s;tands in no need of his creatures' wealth to maintain his crown, their power to effect his de&s;igns, or their wi&s;dom to direct his coun&s;els. But it is far otherwi&s;e with his vicegerents here on earth; though they are called Gods, and clothed with authority from CHRIST and the people&mdash;yet they are but men.</P>
<P>THE affairs of government are often intricate and perplexing, and dangers eminent and threat|ning, &s;o that rulers find occa&s;ion to adopt the lan|guage of the pious king of Judah, "neither know we what to do."</P>
<P>WE are divinely bound to pray "for all in au|thority," that government might be equal and righteous, and that we might "lead a peaceable and quiet life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty."</P>
<P>IT is the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, that makes government &s;teady and effectual, and gives peace
<PB N="18" REF="022506_0017_0FB947BB5D139A80">
and quietne&s;s to the Commonwealth; and GOD will be &s;aught unto, for &s;uch an ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>WHEN we pray for them, we pray for the advancement of peace, and godline&s;s, this being the end for which government is in&s;tituted.</P>
<P>2d. IT is the duty of the people, to &s;upport their rulers.&mdash;That authority by which they govern; injoins obedience from the people to all their righteous laws.</P>
<P>AND as they have a painful pre-eminence above their fellow mortals, and an arduous and important tru&s;t committed to them by God, and the people; they &s;hould be freed from cares and troubles about the affairs of the world.&mdash;"For this cau&s;e, pay you tribute al&s;o; for they are GOD's Mini&s;ters, attending continually upon this very thing."&mdash;The advantages we enjoy under a righteous admini&s;tration, intitle tho&s;e who govern to large returns. Our per&s;ons and properties are &s;ecured, and we &s;et under our own vine and fig-tree, being protected, by a govern|ment merciful and righteous.</P>
<P>WHEN taxes are made for the &s;upport of government, there is a moral obligation on the people, to di&s;charge them; for government which is an ordinance of GOD, could not &s;ub|&s;i&s;t without &s;uch &s;upport.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="022506_0018_0FB947BCDEF77D80">
OUR ble&s;&s;ed LORD &s;et us an example worthy of imitation, when he &s;ent Peter to the mouth of the fi&s;h, that he might receive money to pay their tribute&mdash;And injoined upon us to "render to Cae&s;ar, the things that be Cae&s;ars."&mdash;A &s;upport, honor, love and obedience, are injoined through the whole book of GOD, upon the people, as a ju&s;t tribute due to tho&s;e who govern.</P>
<P>IT is the privilege of the people granted them by GOD and nature, to choo&s;e their own ru|lers.</P>
<P>KINGLY government was never of divine ap|pointment; but added, as the law was, "by rea|&s;on of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>THE government, early e&s;tabli&s;hed in the world among the ancient Hebrews, was a free republic like ours, the &s;overeignty re&s;ided in the body of the people.</P>
<P>THEY were to choo&s;e able men; and they were called to give their a&s;&s;ent to the laws given from Heaven, before they were put into execu|tion.</P>
<P>WHEN government is thus founded, according to the divine mind, and rulers cho&s;en, they be|come repre&s;entatives of the power and maje&s;ty of GOD; and important in&s;truments employed by
<PB N="20" REF="022506_0019_0FB947BE67C2D540">
his providence and grace, in the admini&s;tration of affairs in this lower world.</P>
<P>THEY are intru&s;ted with the lives, liberties and properties of the people, For them prayer &s;hould be continually made, and to them obedience given, as GOD's vicegerents, when they rule for him, and for good to the people.</P>
<P>PEOPLE &s;hould be careful of cen&s;uring them, and encrea&s;ing their burden and concern, le&s;t they be reproved by him, who has forbid our "revil|ing the Gods, or &s;peaking evil of the rulers of the people."</P>
<P>BUT when rulers neglect the great affairs of government&mdash;when they break not every yoke&mdash;plead not the cau&s;e of the injured and innocent, the widow and fatherle&s;s, the poor and needy&mdash;when they do not &s;upport religion, liberty, the arts and literature; the pillars of government will fall, and &s;ociety throw off its plea&s;ing appa|rel: "The &s;word &s;hall be upon the arm, and upon the right eye of the magi&s;trate"&mdash;he &s;hall lo&s;e his di&s;cernment in public mea&s;ures, and his authority &s;hall be taken away.</P>
<P>ON the other hand when tho&s;e in authority, move with dignity in their proper &s;phere, are GOD's mini&s;ters for good; and people are &s;ub|ject

for con&s;cience &s;ake, what a plea&s;ing ap|pearance does the Commonwealth put on! &s;uch as once induced the prophet to exclaim "how goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy taber|nacles O I&s;rael!"</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid we may infer.</P>
<P>1&s;t. THAT GOD in the &s;cheme of grace by CHRIST, provided for the happine&s;s of mankind in this world, as well as for their immortality and glory in the next. And fore&s;eeing to what endle&s;s confu&s;ion and irregularity the world would tumble, without order and &s;ubordination: has with one &s;troke wrote him&s;elf, religion and go|vernment on the mind of man.&mdash;And has &s;ent his SON from Heaven to explain, and enforce, what, at fir&s;t, he wrote on the mind of man, and to reign and govern in righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>CIVIL government is de&s;igned to &s;ub&s;erve the grace of the go&s;pel; and the happine&s;s it deffu&s;es through &s;ociety in this world, &s;hould call forth our gratitude, and prai&s;e to GOD, its author.</P>
<P>IT &s;mooths the rugged road of life, gives the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of every ble&s;&s;ing, and rai&s;es in the mind, the mo&s;t exalted concep|tions of that ble&s;&s;ed BEING, who&s;e benevolent de&s;ign, is to rai&s;e the virtuous among mankind, by &s;mall gradations, to happine&s;s and perfection with him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="022506_0021_0FB947C457141C90">
GOVERNMENT is a link in the chain of ever|la&s;ting mercy; and tho&s;e who are obedient "for the LORDS &s;ake" who has appointed it, may expect that their path will &s;hine more and more unto the perfect day.</P>
<P>2d. WE infer.&mdash;That days of greater peace and happine&s;s, then have ever dawn'd upon the church and world, are before us in America&mdash;This we argue from the ability of CHRIST's per&s;on, the extent of his commi&s;&s;ion, his going forth of old with our fathers; and the deliverance he hath wrought for this generation.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of providence, and the king|dom of grace are his; and he manages the affairs of the one in &s;ub&s;erviency to the other.</P>
<P>IT has been the method of GOD from the be|ginning, to reveal the de&s;igns of his grace and mercy to the world by degrees.</P>
<P>HE promi&s;ed one, mighty to &s;ave, and able to govern &s;oon after the apo&s;tacy in the garden; but four thou&s;and years were numbered, before the de&s;ire of all nations came.</P>
<P>SINCE he appeared on the theatre of life, the church and world have pre&s;&s;ed on for ages, thro' the fire of per&s;ecution: Deluges of blood, op|pre&s;&s;ion and &s;laughter, but little benefited, to appearance, by his coming and death.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="022506_0022_0FB947C51DCE7288">
'TILL the Angel of the LORD pointed our fore-fathers to this We&s;tern World; a land where he determined to unfold the plan of redemption and government. Here they found a &s;afe re|treat from per&s;ecution and cruelty. Savage bea&s;ts and men vani&s;hed before them, like the dew be|fore the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P>HERE the church was founded upon the doctrines of CHRIST, and the Apo&s;tles&mdash;which put forth her branches like the palm-tree, and bid fair to eclip&s;e the glory of the world.</P>
<P>THIS awakened the fears of the country from whence they came, who were grieved at our greatne&s;s and envious at our ri&s;ing glory, and at|tempted to take from us, our liberty, and this land GOD gave to our fathers; prepared chains to bind us to pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and drag us to perdition. The great charter was violated, and the laws that were to protect this infant world, infringed upon. "The foundations were all de|&s;troyed, and what could the righteous do?"</P>
<P>IN that day of our di&s;tre&s;s, we appealed to the &s;trength of JEHOVAH, and the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e: "And GOD came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran"&mdash;he &s;tood and mea&s;ured the earth, and drove a&s;under the nations, and confirmed us in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this goodly land.</P>

UNDER the direction, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of HIM, who admini&s;ters on Heaven's eternal plan, we are delivered from the horrors of war, and en|joy both civil and religious liberty!</P>
<P>WE have been led to frame and adopt a con|&s;titution of government that is the wonder of the world; re&s;embling that which GOD of old, gave the I&s;raelites, the &s;eed of Abraham his friend.</P>
<P>WE &s;houted with heart-felt joy, when the po|litical ark was brought to its place. Sing O Heavens for the LORD hath redeemed New-England, and glorified him&s;elf in America!</P>
<P>WHEN we look over the&s;e great events, we are con&s;trained to cry out with the Patriarch, "&s;urely the LORD is in this place, and we know it not."</P>
<P>WE are re&s;pected abroad among the nations of the earth, and united at home. GOD has put this honour upon us, and &s;poke peace to our bor|ders.</P>
<P>THE &s;y&s;tem of national government we have &s;ettled, we hope, will &s;ecure to us, and hand down to the generations to come, the liberties and pri|vileges we have procured by our toil, trea&s;ures, and the blood of many of our virtuous &s;ons.</P>

THE choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, religion, liberty and peace, were re&s;erved in the coun&s;els of GOD, for thee, O America!</P>
<P>AND what GOD has done for our fathers, and for us of this generation, are but intimations of our future happine&s;s and glory; that he will have a light before him in this Jeru&s;alem, 'till the &s;e|cond coming of HIM, who is the "light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his people I&s;rael." Here the empire of JESUS is founded, and the&s;e are the halcyon days di&s;clo&s;ed to the pious Pro|phet, in a vi&s;ion of the night&mdash;</P>
<P>"AND behold! one like the Son of Man came to the ancient of days, and there was given him dominion, glory and a kingdom; and his domi|nion is an everla&s;ting dominion, which &s;hall not pa&s;s away; and his kingdom, that, which &s;hall not be de&s;troyed."</P>
<P>FROM the ri&s;e and pre&s;ent exaltation of Ame|rica, we conclude &s;he is to be the theatre, where the latter day glory &s;hall be di&s;played; and the medium through which religion, liberty and learning, &s;hall be handed round creation.</P>
<P>3d. WE infer&mdash;That CHRIST will vindicate the &s;acred rights of his government, in the utter de&s;truction of all that oppo&s;e his reign.</P>
<P>IT becomes rulers, mini&s;ters and people, to be willing &s;ubjects of this kingdom, that they may be the glory of CHRIST its King.</P>

THE impious and ungodly will be en&s;nared in their own plots and devi&s;es; and the Heavens will reveal their iniquity one day. "Ki&s;s the Son, le&s;s he be angry, and ye peri&s;h from the way."</P>
<P>TRUE it is, GOD has done great things for us; he has delivered us from war, and invited us by the dawn of peace, to lay a&s;ide the dread artillery of death; he has given us a land that flows with milk and honey, and &s;ettled both church and &s;tate in peace.</P>
<P>BUT what is this to the &s;inners of my people, who live in intemperance, debauchery, pride and luxury, fraud and deceit; who violate GOD's holy laws, neglect the duties of the go&s;pel co|venant, ca&s;t off fear, and re&s;train prayer before GOD.</P>
<P>JESUS, who is exalted at the head of the univer&s;al polity of Angels and men, when his wrath is kindled but a little, will da&s;h &s;uch characters to pieces like a potter's earthern ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>FROM the evil returns we have made to Hea|ven for pa&s;t mercies, we have rea&s;on to fear the divine rebukes: "You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puni&s;h you for your iniquities."</P>
<P>GOD brought his people of old to the borders of the promi&s;ed land; but they murmured again&s;t Mo&s;es and Aaron, and were for making a Cap|tain

This provoked HIM who had done great things for them, to &s;ay "your carca&s;&s;es &s;hall fall in the wilderne&s;s, and ye &s;hall know my breach of promi&s;e: But your little ones, them will I bring in, and they &s;hall know the land which ye have di&s;pi&s;ed."&mdash;So it will be with the wicked of this generation; with Balaam we behold the glory of America, but not nigh; we &s;hall meet the grave, and the horrors of eternity; and our "&s;ons will come to honor, and we know it not."</P>
<P>WE have &s;olemn tidings this day from the mount of GOD:&mdash;The children of New-Eng|land have for&s;aken my covenant: Do ye thus requite the LORD?&mdash;O fooli&s;h people and un|wi&s;e!</P>

<P>O THAT we may as a people, know in this our day, the things of our peace, repent, and do our fir&s;t works; that GOD may heal us, and be|&s;tow tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, he has encouraged us to hope for, from pa&s;t mercies.
