<Q>&mdash;WHAT agreement hath the temple of GOD with idols?&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_TWO branches of the popi&s;h con|trover&s;y, viz. the infallibility and &s;upremacy claimed by the bi&s;hop and church of Rome, were handled by the two aged and learned divines <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Rev. EDWARD WIGGLESWORTH, D. D. late HOLLIS Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity; and the Rev. Mr. THOMAS FOXCROFT, of BOSTON.</NOTE>, whom I have the honor to &s;ucceed in this department of the <HI>Dudleian Lecture.</HI> It is now propo&s;ed, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to offer &s;omething con|cerning the idolatry of that church; it being one of the capital errors objected again&s;t her. This branch of the controver&s;y alone is &s;o fruitful, that it would require many di&s;cour&s;es to handle it in all its extent and variety. This learned audience will, therefore, expect nothing more in a &s;ingle di&s;cour&s;e, tho' long, than a general idea of popi&s;h idolatry; an imperfect &s;ketch, the outlines of it.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010068_0004_0F7C75854942E538">Idolatry con&s;i&s;ts in general in the &s;ervice of idols, or fal&s;e, imaginary deities. But this, like all other crimes, admits of various degrees. The wor&s;hip of a creature under the formal notion of its being the true God, exclu&s;ively of him, is the gro&s;&s;e&s;t kind of idolatry. The wor&s;hip of any creature in common with him, as though it were equally God, is a lower, but &s;till very high degree of it. A third &s;pecies thereof is paying &s;uch &s;ervice to creatures, un|der the notion of religion, as God hath forbid|den, and as they are unworthy of; although it may be profe&s;&s;edly paid to them, not as gods, but in &s;ubordination to him, as the ultimate object of wor&s;hip. It is al&s;o idolatry to wor|&s;hip the true God by images, or under any &s;uppo&s;ed material repre&s;entations of him. And it may be laid down as a general rule, that all &s;uch practices as the &s;cripture hath condemned as idolatrous in Jews or Pagans, are equally idolatrous in profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Prote&s;tants have not accu&s;ed Papi&s;ts of the fir&s;t and gro&s;&s;e&s;t kind of idolatry, or wor&s;hip|ping idols exclu&s;ively of the true God; but they have charged them with all the others: And to make good this old accu&s;ation, is the bu&s;ine&s;s now before me. In the pro&s;ecution of which, a &s;ummary account will be given of the doctrine and practice of the church of Rome re&s;pecting the wor&s;hip of the euchari&s;t, &s;aints and angels, pictures and images.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="010068_0005_0F7C7585E82B4F58">Chri&s;tians early began to &s;peak too my&s;ti|cally, not to &s;ay unintelligibly, concerning the euchari&s;t, or Lord's &s;upper. They did &s;o more and more, till the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and the wor&s;hip of the &s;acrament, were fully e&s;tabli&s;hed. The council of Trent, confirmed by pope Pius IV, and con&s;idered as an authen|tic &s;tandard of popery, defines the doctrine of the church of Rome as to this, and many other points, more particularly than had been done by any former council. In &s;e&s;&s;ion 13th that council declareth as follows: 'Principio do|cet &s;ancta &s;ynodus,' &amp;c. <HI>In the fir&s;t place the holy &s;ynod teacheth, and openly and &s;imply pro|fe&s;&s;eth, that in the pure &s;acrament of the holy euchari&s;t, after the con&s;ecration of the bread and wine, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, true God and man, is truly, really and &s;ub&s;tantially contained un|der the &s;pecies</HI> [or appearances] <HI>of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible things</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Conc. Trident. Se&s;&s;. 13. cap. 1.</NOTE>. This great my&s;tery is increa&s;ed in chapter 3d of the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion, where the coun|cil attempts to explain it. It is there &s;aid, 'Statim po&s;t con&s;ecrationem,' &amp;c. That <HI>im|mediately after con&s;ecration, the true body of our Lord, and his true blood, exi&s;t under the &s;pecies of bread and wine, together with his &s;oul and Divinity; his body indeed under the &s;pecies of bread, and his blood under the &s;pecies of wine, by virtue of the words</HI> [of con&s;ecration;] <HI>but the body it&s;elf un|der the &s;pecies of wine, and the blood under the &s;pecies of bread, and the &s;oul under both, by virtue of that natural connexion and concomitancy, by which
<PB N="8" REF="010068_0006_0F7C7586B4103F40">the parts of Chri&s;t the Lord, who pre&s;ently ro&s;e from the dead to die no more, are united together; and al&s;o the Divinity, becau&s;e of the admirable hy|po&s;tatical union thereof with the body and &s;oul. Wherefore it is mo&s;t true, that one and the &s;ame thing</HI> [or as much <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">tantumdem.</NOTE>] <HI>is contained under either &s;pecies, and under both: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> whole and perfect Chri&s;t exi&s;teth under the &s;pecies of bread, and un|der every part of its &s;pecies; al&s;o under he &s;pe|cies of wine, and under its parts.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the&s;e venerable fathers. And this wonderful change of the bread and wine is &s;aid, in the next chapter, to have been <HI>conve|niently and properly called tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.</HI> It follows, chapter 5th, 'Nullus itaque dubitandi locus relinquitur,' &amp;c. <HI>There is therefore no room left for doubt, but that all the faithful of Chri&s;t, according to the practice ever received in the catholic church, &s;hould in reverence give the wor&s;hip of latria, which is due to the true God, to this mo&s;t holy &s;acrament. For neither is it therefore the le&s;s to be adored, becau&s;e it was in|&s;tituted by Chri&s;t the Lord, to be taken</HI> [or eaten and drunk] <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">ut &s;umatur.</NOTE>. Thus the council: And in the <HI>Roman ritual</HI> this &s;acrament is honored with the title of our <HI>Creator.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved here, that the church of Rome di&s;tingui&s;hes wor&s;hip into latria, du|lia, hyperdulia and coadoration. By the fir&s;t of which, latria, they under&s;tand the highe&s;t kind of wor&s;hip, or that which is due to God alone. And the council of Trent expre&s;ly
<PB N="9" REF="010068_0007_0F7C75876CA594A8">declares, that the euchari&s;t is to be wor&s;hipped therewith. The doctrine and practice of the church of Rome in this re&s;pect are exactly con|formable to each other. The euchari&s;t is wor|&s;hipped by them in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, with pro&s;trations, prayers and incen&s;e. The ho&s;t is often carried in proce&s;&s;ions, with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity: And tho&s;e who are but ca&s;ually pre|&s;ent where it pa&s;&s;es along, are obliged to kneel down, as in an act of wor&s;hip to God; unle&s;s, perhaps, they will run the ri&s;que of the inqui|&s;ition, or of being knocked on the head by the devout rabble that attend it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is well known, that the chief accu&s;ation again&s;t the old reformers, was, that they denied tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; tho' &s;ome even of tho&s;e who &s;uffered death, particularly John Hus and Jerom of Prague, did not differ materially from the church of Rome in this point; as plainly appears from Mon&s;. Lenfant's <HI>Hi&s;tory of the council of Con&s;tance.</HI> And what great &s;tre&s;s the church of Rome lays upon this doctrine, as a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing and e&s;&s;ential article of faith, will further appear from the canons, i. e. cur&s;es, of the council of Trent, &s;e&s;&s;. 13. Some of which are here faithfully tran&s;lated, partly with that view, and partly with a view to give the unlearned reader a clearer idea of what the church of Rome holds, as to this matter. They are as follows.</P>
<P>Canon I. 'Si quis negaverit,' &amp;c. 'If any one &s;hall deny, that in the mo&s;t holy &s;acrament of the euchari&s;t the body and blood, together with the &s;oul and divinity of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are truly, really and &s;ub&s;tantially contained, and therefore whole Chri&s;t; but &s;hall &s;ay, they are in it only as in a &s;ign, or figure, or in virtue; let him be <HI>anathema.</HI>'</P>
<P>Can. II. 'If any one &s;hall &s;ay, that the &s;ub&s;tance of bread and wine remain in the holy &s;acrament of the euchari&s;t, together with the body and blood of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and &s;hall deny that admirable and &s;ingular conver&s;ion of the whole &s;ub&s;tance of bread into body, and of the whole &s;ub&s;tance of wine into blood, the &s;pecies [or appearance] only of bread and wine remaining; which conver&s;ion, indeed, the catholic church mo&s;t fitly calls tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; let him be <HI>anathema.</HI>'</P>
<P>Can. III. 'If any one &s;hall deny, that in the venerable &s;acra|ment of the euchari&s;t whole Chri&s;t is contained under each &s;pecies, and under the &s;everal parts of each &s;pecies; let him be <HI>anathema.</HI>'</P>
<P>Can. VI. 'If any one &s;hall &s;ay, that in the holy &s;acrament of the euchari&s;t, Chri&s;t the only begotten Son of God is not to be adored with the wor&s;hip of latria, even external;&mdash;let him be <HI>anathema.</HI>'</P>
<P>So important a doctrine is this, in the church of Rome: And more per&s;ons, it is apprehended, have &s;uffered death from her for denying it, and refu&s;ing to wor&s;hip the euchari&s;t, than for any other &s;uppo&s;ed here&s;y whatever.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010068_0008_0F7C75881F8A8DF0">Their doctrine and wor&s;hip being harmo|nious in this re&s;pect; it follows, that if the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation is fal&s;e, their wor|&s;hip grounded thereon is idolatry. It is be|yond the de&s;ign of this di&s;cour&s;e to enter into a particular di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that doctrine, or the arguments by which it is defended: It &s;hall &s;uffice to ob&s;erve a few things with relation thereto.</P>
<P>This doctrine is as plainly ab&s;urd, &s;elf-re|pugnant, and impo&s;&s;ible to be true, as any one that can be imagined. For what can be more &s;o, than that bread and wine &s;hould be changed into the very body and blood of Chri&s;t; while yet all the known properties of bread and wine remain, without the &s;ubject or &s;ub&s;tance; and none of the peculiar properties of fle&s;h or blood are perceived? What more impo&s;&s;ible, than that this bread and wine &s;hould al&s;o be changed, at the &s;ame time, into an human &s;oul, and into the very &s;ub&s;tance of the Deity? This
<PB N="11" REF="010068_0009_0F7C75890B7CC3F0">doctrine &s;uppo&s;es al&s;o, that the &s;ame undivided body of Chri&s;t may be wholly in heaven and wholly on earth, and in ten million different places on earth, at the &s;ame time. It &s;uppo&s;es, that tho' the bread is wholly changed into body, and the wine wholly into blood; yet both the body and blood of Chri&s;t, the &s;oul and Divinity, exi&s;t wholly and perfectly under each of the &s;pecies &s;eperately con&s;idered, and under every part thereof, be they ever &s;o minute and nume|rous: Every apparent crumb of con&s;ecrated wafer, and each drop of con&s;ecrated wine, how|ever &s;mall, contains whole, intire Chri&s;t un|der that &s;pecies; body, blood, &s;oul and Divi|nity; and yet it is owned, that there is but one Chri&s;t! Be&s;ides; this doctrine &s;uppo&s;es, that when our Lord in&s;tituted the &s;upper, he took his whole body into his own hand, which was but a part of it; put him&s;elf into his own mouth, &s;wallowed down his intire body in|to his &s;tomach, and at the &s;ame time gave his body and blood to be wholly eaten and drunk by each of his apo&s;tles! Could the mo&s;t fertile imagination invent gro&s;&s;er, more ridiculous, or more impious incongruities?</P>
<P>The evidence of &s;en&s;e is the mo&s;t certain, that we are capable of; and by this we know that tran&s;ub&s;tantiation is fal&s;e. The Romani&s;ts do not pretend to deny, but that all the five &s;en&s;es bear te&s;timony again&s;t it, as much as they po&s;&s;ibly could if it were fal&s;e, or if the bread and wine remained after the juggling, hocus-pocus
<PB N="12" REF="010068_0010_0F7C7589C3F13378"><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hocus-pocus &s;eems only a corrupt pronunciation of <HI>Hoc e&s;t corpus.</HI></NOTE> trick, which they term con&s;ecration. It is, therefore, at be&s;t weak and puerile, in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, to urge the te&s;timony of &s;cripture, or divine revelation. For the truth of the Chri&s;|tian revelation it&s;elf depends on the truth of certain facts, by which there was an appeal made to the &s;en&s;es of men; particularly the miracles and re&s;urrection of our Saviour. The evidence of &s;en&s;e being &s;et a&s;ide as precarious, it cannot be proved that ever our Lord uttered tho&s;e words, 'This is my body'; that he had any body at all; or that there was ever &s;uch a per|&s;on in the world, as 'the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us,' in di&s;tinction from a mere phanta&s;m, or, in the language of our adver&s;aries, from the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of a man. Thus does the church of Rome, by this doctrine, &s;ubvert the very foundations of chri&s;tianity. We cannot be more certain, that any one thing in nature is what it appears to be, and not another, the mo&s;t different therefrom, than that true bread and wine re|main after con&s;ecration; and con&s;equently, that tran&s;ub&s;tantiation is the gro&s;&s;e&s;t impo&s;ition and in&s;ult, that ever the prie&s;thood it&s;elf put upon the &s;uper&s;titious credulity of mankind.</P>
<P>This doctrine then, being plainly fal&s;e, the church of Rome is certainly guilty of idolatry, in wor&s;hipping the euchari&s;t as true God. For what is idolatry, if it be not &s;o, to believe a creature to be the Creator, and to pay divine homage thereto accordingly? Be&s;ides; when,
<PB N="13" REF="010068_0011_0F7C758DD9117330">to ju&s;tify their wor&s;hip of the euchari&s;t, &s;o often objected again&s;t as idolatry, they alledge tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; making this &s;uppo&s;ed change the ground of their wor&s;hip; this is an implicit acknowledgment, that their wor&s;hip would actually be idolatrous, if there were no &s;uch change: For why is this alledged, to exculpate them&s;elves, if their wor&s;hip of the euchari&s;t would not be idolatry without it?</P>
<P>Some Roman-catholics have, indeed, ex|pre&s;ly owned this con&s;equence. Co&s;terus par|ticularly, a learned je&s;uit, expre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf very &s;trongly, as cited by doctor H. More. Saith he, <Q>The errors of tho&s;e were more to|lerable, who wor&s;hipped &s;ome golden or &s;ilver &s;tatue, or &s;ome image of any other materials, for their God, as the heathen wor&s;hipped their gods; or a red cloth hung upon the top of a &s;pear, as is reported of the Laplan|ders; or &s;ome live animal, as of old the Egyptians did; than tho&s;e who wor&s;hip <HI>a bit of bread,</HI> as hitherto the Chri&s;tians have done all over the world, if the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation be not true.</Q> Thus do &s;ome Roman-catholics fully agree with us in this con&s;equence; but others deny it. And the &s;ub&s;tance of what the latter &s;ay, is, That tho' tran&s;ub&s;tantiation &s;hould be fal&s;e; yet the Deity is certainly there pre&s;ent in the bread and wine, &s;o that they do not mi&s;s of the proper object of adoration, while they &s;eem to wor|&s;hip tho&s;e material objects: And, that they
<PB N="14" REF="010068_0012_0F7C758E574D1680">cannot be ju&s;tly charged with idolatry, becau&s;e they do not intentionally wor&s;hip a creature, knowing it to be &s;o, but firmly believing it to be true God. Thus they try to exculpate them&s;elves, on the very di&s;agreeable &s;uppo&s;ition that tran&s;ub&s;tantiation is an error, and their in|fallibility mi&s;taken; whether effectually, or not, may appear from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>The divine nature is e&s;&s;entially every-where; intimately and equally pre&s;ent in all &s;en&s;ible objects throughout the univer&s;e. And if mere|ly the divine pre&s;ence in an object, will excu&s;e its wor&s;hippers from idolatry, then all other creatures may be wor&s;hipped without idolatry, as well as the euchari&s;t; provided the wor|&s;hippers intentionally direct their devotions ultimately, not to the&s;e objects ab&s;tractly con|&s;idered, but as &s;ymbols of the Deity pre&s;ent in them. This is a plain con&s;equence, and allow|ed by &s;ome Roman-catholics. Thus, no per&s;on, who is a believer in the true God, an omni|pre&s;ent being, can ever be guilty of idolatry, how many material objects &s;oever he may wor&s;hip in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that the Romani&s;ts wor&s;hip bread and wine in the euchari&s;t. Tho' each of the&s;e objects is &s;uppo&s;ed to be God, and wor&s;hipped under that per&s;ua&s;ion; and tho' the votary would be mi&s;taken in this re&s;pect; yet he would not mi&s;s of the proper object of adoration, becau&s;e, the wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t, God is pre&s;ent therein, whom he intends to wor&s;hip; which is &s;ufficient to clear
<PB N="15" REF="010068_0013_0F7C758F30981FE0">him from idolatry. For example; if one per|&s;on &s;hould wor&s;hip the &s;un, another an image of wood or bra&s;s, a third a man, a fourth a bea&s;t, and the fifth a devil, even with latria; each of the devonioni&s;ts being &s;o infatuated as to believe the object of his wor&s;hip the living and true God; Roman-catholics could not, upon the principle afore&s;aid, charge them with idolatry; or do it without condemning them|&s;elves. They would, indeed, be mi&s;taken, but not idolaters; becau&s;e it was their intention to wor&s;hip the true God.</P>
<P>But all idolatry, when people are &s;incere in their wor&s;hip, &s;uppo&s;eth &s;ome mi&s;take, or error in the judgment, either as to the object or the act of wor&s;hip. Without &s;ome erroneous opi|nions there can be no idolatry: And, as a learned divine hath ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, where this &s;in is committed the <HI>mo&s;t in good earne&s;t,</HI> there is the greate&s;t mi&s;take in the judgment of the wor&s;hipper. But they who alledge, that a mi&s;take with re&s;pect to tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, if it be really one, excu&s;es the wor&s;hippers of the bread and wine from idolatry, becau&s;e they think they are wor&s;hipping God; do in effect &s;ay, that idolatry cannot be committed by any one, who is &s;o erroneous as to believe the creature he wor&s;hippeth to be God mo&s;t high. This is quite ab&s;urd: For according to this way of rea&s;oning, the more ignorantly and &s;tu|pidly any wor&s;hip mere creatures, believing their proper Deity, and the more devoutly they adore
<PB N="16" REF="010068_0014_0F7C758F9EEA3710">them; &s;o much le&s;s liable they are to the im|putation of idolatry. But the direct contrary is manife&s;tly true: By how much more &s;in|cerely any believe a creature to be the true God, and wor&s;hip it as &s;uch; by &s;o much the more gro&s;s is their idolatry. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for illu&s;tration, that among the I&s;raelites of old, who wor&s;hipped golden calves, there were per|&s;ons of different opinions; that &s;ome adored them merely as &s;ymbols, or repre&s;entations of the true God; but that others were &s;o &s;otti&s;h as to believe the calf, to which they bowed down, was really Jehovah him&s;elf under the appearance or <HI>&s;pecies</HI> of a calf; even the very God that created, and brought them out of Egypt. Now, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, would any &s;en&s;ible man &s;ay, that the former were, indeed, guilty of idolatry, but not the latter; becau&s;e they believed this four-footed bea&s;t to be their Creator? Ought it not to be &s;aid, on the con|trary, that they were, for that very rea&s;on, more bruti&s;h idolaters than the others, who wor&s;hipped it only as an image or &s;ymbol of the Godhead? Or let us apply this to the heathens. The ignorant vulgar, who wor&s;hip|ped &s;en&s;ible objects as real deities, were ever and ju&s;tly accounted more &s;otti&s;h idolaters than tho&s;e &s;peculative per&s;ons, who had no &s;uch high opinion of the&s;e objects, but wor&s;hipped them merely as repre&s;entations of the gods; or rather, as &s;ome of them &s;eem to have done, of the vari|ous powers, virtues and perfections of one
<PB N="17" REF="010068_0015_0F7C759082FB07F0">almighty, &s;piritual and invi&s;ible being. Thus, if among the ancient Per&s;ians &s;ome adored the ri&s;ing &s;un, only as the mo&s;t glorious &s;ymbol of the Deity, and a principal mean or in&s;trument of his munificence, while others wor&s;hipped it as being it&s;elf God; the idolatry of the latter was certainly more gro&s;s than that of the for|mer. By the &s;ame rule, the more &s;incerely any believe tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and wor&s;hip the euchari&s;t as God; the more &s;otti&s;h is their ido|latry. Their idolatry would be le&s;s &s;candalous, tho' real, if they wor&s;hipped it merely as a re|pre&s;entation of the Deity, or a &s;acred memorial of our redemption by Chri&s;t. And here it is natural to ob&s;erve, that the idolatry of the Ro|mani&s;ts is more gro&s;s in this re&s;pect, than that of the I&s;raelites in wor&s;hipping golden calves, or than many per&s;ons, even among the Pagans, were chargeable with. There is no good rea|&s;on to think, that the I&s;raelites believed a gol|den calf, which they had ju&s;t made, to be the true God, their Creator; as the Papi&s;ts do, bread and wine. And it is certain, that &s;ome of the more intelligent heathens di&s;claimed, with much indignation, the thought of wor&s;hipping any material objects, otherwi&s;e than as &s;ymbols of the Deity; while the vulgar adored them, as having divinity belonging to them. So that popi&s;h idolatry, in this re&s;pect, approacheth nearer to that of vulgar Pagans, than to that of the more enlightened among them. And in|deed, none of them were ever &s;o brutal and &s;avage, as to eat what he took for a deity: at

And it is certain that the Egyptians, who wor&s;hipped many &s;orts of animals, roots and vegetables, that were good for food, as gods; yet thought it impious at once to adore and devour them: But the Papi&s;ts, it &s;eems, are le&s;s delicate, or &s;queami&s;h.</P>
<P>Let me di&s;mi&s;s this part of the &s;ubject with a remark of the late Dr. Middleton, agreeable to what was ju&s;t now &s;aid, in his excellent <HI>Letter from Rome,</HI> &s;hewing an exact con|formity between popery and pagani&s;m in many particulars. <Q>As to that celebrated act of popi&s;h idolatry, the wor&s;hip of the ho&s;t, &s;aith he, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I can|not find the lea&s;t re&s;emblance of it in any part of the pagan wor&s;hip: and as often as I have been &s;tanding by at ma&s;s, and &s;een the whole congregation pro&s;trate on the ground, in the humble&s;t po&s;ture of adoring; I could not help reflecting on a pa&s;&s;age of Tully, when &s;peaking of the ab&s;urdity of the heathens in the choice of their gods: <HI>But was man,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ever &s;o mad as to take that which he feeds upon for a god</HI>? <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><Q><P>Sed ecquem tam amentem e&s;&s;e putas, qui illud, quo ve&s;catur, Deum credat e&s;&s;e.</P>

<P><PB N="19" REF="010068_0017_0F7C7592440386E0">LET us now proceed to the wor&s;hip of &s;aints and angels, as practi&s;ed in the &s;ame church; by which the charge of idolatry will be further fixed upon her.</P>
<P>The wor&s;hip of demons, or the &s;ouls of renowned per&s;ons after their decea&s;e, is a very ancient &s;pecies of idolatry; as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, even more ancient than the flood. Be that as it may, this became afterward almo&s;t an uni|ver&s;al practice. For it is pa&s;t di&s;pute, that the greater part of the gods and godde&s;&s;es wor&s;hipped by the heathens, were demons; decea&s;ed heroes and kings, the inventors of arts, and other famous per&s;ons, male and fe|male. This kind of wor&s;hip was &s;trictly pro|hibited to the I&s;raelites; but yet they &s;ome|times fell into it, in conformity to their hea|then neighbours. Chri&s;tianity, which was de&s;igned to be the religion of the world, not of one nation only, was particularly adapted to put an end to this, and all other kinds of &s;uper&s;titious, fal&s;e wor&s;hip among the Gentiles; and to e&s;tabli&s;h that of one God, by one Me|diator, thro'out the earth. <Q>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us; who gave him|&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 6.</NOTE> And <Q>there is none other God but one. For tho' there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are

During the apo&s;tolic age, and &s;ome time after, Chri&s;tians in general were &s;o aver&s;e to the wor&s;hip of demons, and all other &s;orts of idolatry, that they determinately re|fu&s;ed any compliances with the wor&s;hip of their heathen neighbours, even at the expence of their blood. They con&s;idered the wor&s;hip of angels and demons as incon&s;i&s;tent with the religion which they profe&s;&s;ed; and as what would have been an implicit renunciation of it. But the church of Rome is, in effect, for reconciling the&s;e things together; even the <HI>temple of God with idols.</HI> For many ages pa&s;t, the wor&s;hip of demons, or angels, and the &s;ouls of dead men and women, has been fully e&s;tabli&s;hed therein, and as much practi&s;ed as ever the like wor&s;hip was among the heathens. The chief difference is, that the Romani&s;ts do not call the &s;aints or angels gods and godde&s;&s;es; though, for aught that appears, they attribute as much power to them at lea&s;t, as the pagans did to their inferior deities; and depend as much upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="010068_0019_0F7C7593B64061C8">The ri&s;e and progre&s;s of this &s;pecies of idola|try in the Chri&s;tian church, was briefly as follows. The martyrs were ju&s;tly held in great honor after their decea&s;e. The caemete|ries, or places of their burial, u&s;ed to be much frequented, even from the earlie&s;t times: There the people prayed, not to them indeed, but to God; and &s;ometimes &s;ung hymns in honor of their memory. All this was done for &s;ome time, without any thought of wor|&s;hipping them, though not wholly without &s;uper&s;tition. But an extravagant, and even idolatrous veneration for them &s;ucceeded, at lea&s;t as early as the fourth century. For Vi|gilantius, who lived at the latter end of it, as Dr. Middleton has ob&s;erved, publicly charged the ruling clergy with paganizing and idola|try, on account of &s;everal heatheni&s;h cu&s;toms then in the church; particularly the veneration of &s;aints and reliques. <Q>We &s;ee, &s;ays he, in effect, a pagan rite introduced into our chur|ches, under the pretext of religion; when heaps of wax candles are lighted up in clear &s;un-&s;hine, and people are every-where ki&s;&s;ing and adoring, I know not what, con|temptible du&s;t, pre&s;erved in a little ve&s;&s;el, and wrapped up in precious linnen. The&s;e men do great honor truly to the ble&s;&s;ed mar|tyrs, by lighting up paultry candles to tho&s;e, whom the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne illuminates with all the lu&s;tre of his maje&s;ty.</Q> It is &s;aid that Jerom, who attempted to an|&s;wer
<PB N="22" REF="010068_0020_0F7C75941E0F2508">Vigilantius, neither di&s;owned the&s;e prac|tices, nor denied that they were borrowed from the pagan wor&s;hip; but ju&s;tified them by &s;aying, <Q>That was once done to idols, and was then to be dete&s;ted; but this is done to the martyrs, and is therefore to be received.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Letter from Rome,</HI> the latter end.</NOTE></Q> So it &s;eems, that even in Jerom's opinion, what was dete&s;table &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry when done by Chri&s;tians in honor of the martyrs: There needed only to transfer the veneration from tho&s;e idols to the &s;aints, in order to render it laudable, at lea&s;t ad|mi&s;&s;ible: The kind of wor&s;hip might be retained, if the particular objects of it were changed, and chri&s;tian demons introduced in|&s;tead of pagan demons!</P>
<P>But worldly policy, as well as &s;uper&s;tition, had &s;ome hand in e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;aint-wor&s;hip. When Chri&s;tian teachers became corrupt and worldly-minded, thro' the indi&s;crete zeal, or, perhaps, policy, of Con&s;tantine the Great, they aimed more at increa&s;ing the number of nominal Chri&s;tians, for &s;ecular ends, than that of real ones; or pre&s;erving their religion in its original purity and &s;implicity. And ac|cordingly, ob&s;erving how attached the Pagans were to the wor&s;hip of their gods and demi|gods, to their magnificent temples, images, and the fea&s;ts kept in honor of their deities; the Chri&s;tian leaders were for bringing them over,
<PB N="23" REF="010068_0021_0F7C7596E5F8C788">by imitating many of their cu&s;toms. Then &s;pacious churches were built, &s;umptuou&s;ly adorned, and dedicated to the martyrs; pic|tures, images and altars were brought into u&s;e therein; and the formal invocation of &s;aints encouraged. Thus Chri&s;tians rivalled, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed Pagans, in their own way, with a view to bring them over to the faith of Chri&s;t, at lea&s;t to a profe&s;&s;ion of it. By which temporizing policy, as bi&s;hop Stilling|fleet ob&s;erves, chri&s;tianity came at la&s;t to be little or nothing el&s;e but 'reformed pagani&s;m,' as to its external wor&s;hip: Or, as Turretin &s;ays, <Q>the empire was brought over to the faith, but the church al&s;o infected with the pomp of the empire; the Pagans were con|verted to Chri&s;t, but the Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip depraved to the fa&s;hion of pagani&s;m. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See more relating to this, <HI>Letter from Rome,</HI> &s;ub fin.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The wor&s;hip of &s;aints prevailed more and more until the Reformation, tho' not equal|ly in all parts, nor without oppo&s;ition.

And the Pantheon at Rome, formerly the temple of all the gods, is now dedicated to Mary and all the &s;aints. They al&s;o make formal vows and prayers to them for ble&s;&s;ings temporal, &s;piritual and eternal. Why might they not as well offer &s;heep and oxen in &s;acrifice to them, as pay them &s;uch wor&s;hip as this; and yet be free from idola|try?</P>
<P>Let me in&s;tance in a few of their hymns and prayers to the &s;aints, by way of &s;pecimen.

But their wor&s;hip of the virgin Mary they term hyperdulia; by which it is not ea&s;y to know what they mean, only in general, that it is &s;omething more extravagant and outrageous than their wor&s;hip of other &s;aints, or of angels.

People may be guilty of this, by paying an unwarrantable wor&s;hip to &s;aints and angels, or other creatures, tho' they do not adore them as equal to God in nature and dignity, but wor&s;hip them as inferior to him. We are, indeed, to give honor, or, if they plea&s;e, wor&s;hip, which is an equivocal term, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word is divers times u&s;ed in &s;cripture, to expre&s;s the honor that may be ju&s;tly due, and paid to creatures.</NOTE> to all tho&s;e to whom it is due; and in &s;uch manner and mea&s;ure as it belongs to them, either by the expre&s;s appointment of God, or by natural rea|&s;on and right, in virtue of the known relation

To give &s;uch wor&s;hip as this to the &s;aints, is an implicit a&s;cription of divine per|fections to them, while they are explicitly owned to be but creatures. It is a kind of wor&s;hip, which &s;uppo&s;es them to be omnipotent, omni|&s;cient, and omnipre&s;ent; &s;ince He alone, who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e perfections, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to hear prayers at all times, from all parts of the earth at the &s;ame time; and able to grant &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings. How poor an eva&s;ion is it then, for Romancatholics to &s;ay, they neither call the &s;aints gods, nor wor&s;hip them with &s;upreme wor&s;hip? For is not this to &s;uppo&s;e them really gods? And is not that even &s;upreme wor&s;hip, which can, with propriety, be given only to God almighty? It is of no con&s;e|quence, except as a matter of critici&s;m, whether this be called latria or dulia: And if they are guilty of an apparent incon&s;i&s;tency in this re&s;|pect, as well as of idolatry; it much more con|cerns their own infallibility to clear it up, than it concerns us.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; this di&s;tinction might &s;erve &s;ome pagan idolaters as well as it does them; all tho&s;e, who acknowledged one God, as &s;upreme. For him alone they profe&s;&s;edly wor&s;hipped with &s;upreme honors, an&s;wering to the latria of the Papi&s;ts; the others they wor&s;hipped as &s;ubordi|nate, with a wor&s;hip an&s;wering to dulia or hyer|dulia.

<P>One cannot well help remarking here, by the way, the great di&s;ingenuity and a&s;&s;urance of tho&s;e Romancatholics, who pretend that they pray to the &s;aints only as friendly interce&s;&s;ors, to pray for them.

<P>Never did any pagan idolaters implore greater ble&s;&s;ings of their &s;upreme, or &s;o great of their inferior deities, or demons, as the Romancatho|lics implore directly of their &s;aints, e&s;pecially of Mary. But it has &s;ometimes been &s;aid by them, that there is a material difference in this re&s;pect: That tho&s;e dead men and women, whom the heathens wor&s;hipped, were ignorant of true re|ligon, and black with crimes in their life-time; whereas tho&s;e that are wor&s;hipped in the church of Rome, were very holy per&s;ons, adorned with many &s;hining virtues, the workers of miracles, the &s;pecial favourites of heaven; and the like. Be it &s;o: But the que&s;tion is not, who were the be&s;t, the mo&s;t worthy of imitation, and an ho|nourable remembrance; but whether any de|mons, or dead men, were they ever &s;o holy, can be thus wor&s;hipped without idolatry? True, it is more fooli&s;h and wicked to adore an ill man thus after his decea&s;e, than a wi&s;e and good one: But yet the latter is as truly idolatry as the o|ther. If the Pagans were idolaters in wor&s;hip|ping

And &s;ince the Romani&s;ts pay the like, if not greater honors, to dead men and women, or de|mons; this mu&s;t, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, be ido|latry in them al&s;o.</P>
<P>But it may be remembered, that &s;ome of tho&s;e men, whom the Pagans deified, had really been great benefactors to their re&s;pective countries and ages; teachers of agriculture, and other u&s;e|ful arts; the de&s;troyers of tyrants, and other wild bea&s;ts and mon&s;ters; the founders of cities and empires; wi&s;e legi&s;lators; upright judges, and good kings, the fathers of their people. In which re&s;pects they had at lea&s;t as good a title to great honors, both living, and after their de|cea&s;e, as &s;ome of the popi&s;h &s;aints; I think a much better. For divers of tho&s;e, who adorn the Roman kalender, were but ignorant enthu|&s;ia&s;ts, &s;carce better than madmen; per&s;ons who never did any thing worthy of applau&s;e.

'Nec inde &s;equitur, hoc po&s;ito, imagines', &amp;c. Nor does it follow, this being &s;uppo&s;ed, that images are to be retained only to help the memory, as modern heretics would have it: for memory is purely hi&s;torical, and memory exciteth to render wor&s;hip to God and the &s;aints; but accor|ding to this notion images would be kept for that latter re|membrance [<HI>only.</HI>] Neverthele&s;s the other opinion is more probable, and more agreeable to the &s;ynod, that images &s;hould be honored even in them&s;elves, and &s;hould be the material ter|minative object of veneration, and not only the exemplar, ap|prehended in them, or at the pre&s;ence of them; becau&s;e when the council &s;ays, that images are to be adored, but not with latria, it intends that another thing &s;hould be adored be&s;ides the exemplar only; for &s;ince Chri&s;t &s;hould be adored with true latria, the &s;ynod would not deny the wor&s;hip of latria to his image, if indeed in the adoration of it, not his image, but Chri&s;t him&s;elf were adored, to whom no other adoration be&s;ides that of latria, belongeth.

Thus I ap|prehend in my mind him that was crucified, together with the cro&s;s [<HI>perhaps not always</HI>] and in adoring the Crucified with a direct intention, the cro&s;s it&s;elf is coadored in the &s;ame act. <HI>Suma concil. omn.</HI> Opera &amp; &s;tudio M.

<P>Here is a plain conce&s;&s;ion, that they <HI>figure the Divinity,</HI> even while they acknowledge it cannot be &s;een, or expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>figures</HI> or <HI>colors</HI>: Which might, perhaps, pa&s;s for a con|tradiction in any church, but an infallible one.

<PB N="41" REF="010068_0039_0F7C75A5A17A2508">to make and wor&s;hip any picture or image of Chri&s;t, con&s;idered as God, which is what they chiefly intend here, is idolatry; and directly contrary to the &s;econd commandment, whe|ther it be latria, or dulia only, that is paid thereto. And the di&s;tinctions, of which the Papi&s;ts &s;erve them&s;elves, would &s;erve as well to ju&s;tify the I&s;raelites of old, provided they wor&s;hipped golden calves only as &s;ymbols or types of Jehovah; intending this honor &s;hould terminate on him, as the prototype. Upon the &s;ame principle, tho&s;e Pagans who wor|&s;hipped images, not for their own &s;ake, but as &s;uppo&s;ed repre&s;entations of the invi&s;ible God, could not be charged with idolatry, how often &s;oever they might ki&s;s, pro&s;trate them&s;elves before, and offer incen&s;e and &s;acri|fices to them. Some pagan wor&s;hippers of idols and images could, probably, have made &s;uch a plea as truly, and with a much better grace, than tho&s;e of the Romancatholics who have the holy &s;criptures; in which all image-wor&s;hip is plainly forbidden. And, indeed, the leaders in the church of Rome have &s;hewn a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that &s;cripture was again&s;t them in this re&s;pect, by leaving the &s;econd commandment wholly out of tho&s;e which are de&s;igned for common u&s;e, and di|viding the la&s;t of the ten into two, to compleat the number.</P>
<P>As to other pictures and images; if it be idolatry to wor&s;hip &s;aints and angels, as it is
<PB N="42" REF="010068_0040_0F7C75A82E851E60">practi&s;ed in the church of Rome; it is even more &s;o, to wor&s;hip their images. As &s;ome have ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, they are guilty of double idolatry in this re&s;pect; fir&s;t, in wor&s;hipping &s;aints and angels them&s;elves, and then in a|doring their images, with the like external wor&s;hip of prayers, pro&s;trations and incen&s;e: for either of the&s;e things would be idolatry, without the other. The &s;ame arguments which prove, that the Pagans wor&s;hipping the images of their demons, or inferior deities, was idolatry, will al&s;o &s;hew the idolatry of the church of Rome, in wor&s;hipping the ima|ges of angels and &s;aints, who are, &s;trictly and properly, their demons. The more intelli|gent &s;ort of pagans did not a&s;cribe divinity to their images them&s;elves; nor honor them with a more profound reverence, internal or exter|nal, than Romancatholics pay to theirs. Nay, &s;ome of them were intirely again&s;t the u&s;e of any images in their religious &s;ervices; as tend|ing to give people too gro&s;s conceptions of the Deity. And when the council of Trent &s;o gravely injoins, that all <HI>&s;uper&s;tition</HI> in the wor|&s;hip of &s;aints and reliques, and in the <HI>&s;acred u&s;e of images,</HI> &s;hould be <HI>taken away,</HI> &s;till encouraging the&s;e practices them&s;elves; it is as anti-&s;criptu|ral and irrational as if tho&s;e fathers had decreed, that men &s;hould commit fornication, but with|out uncha&s;tity; theft and robbery, but with|out inju&s;tice; murder, without breach of cha|rity; and bla&s;phemy, without impiety. The

The &s;uper&s;tition of this kind of wor&s;hip cannot be taken away, without taking away that wor&s;hip it&s;elf. Nor is there any better foundation for a di&s;tinction between the u&s;e and abu&s;e thereof, than be|tween the u&s;e and abu&s;e of lying and adultery, ince&s;t and perjury. Indeed, the leaders in the church of Rome find all the&s;e crimes very <HI>u&s;eful</HI> in their turns, and &s;ub&s;ervient to their own ends, when kept under their di&s;crete and &s;kilful management: So that, in their opinion, laying them wholly a&s;ide might, perhaps, be the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible abu&s;e of them. For what would then become of their di&s;pen&s;ations, pardons, indulgencies, and I know not what; the wicked <HI>craft, by which they have their wealth</HI>?</P>

<P>It further appears from hence, what great danger there is of perdition in the communion of this church; every true &s;on and daughter of which is, and mu&s;t be, an idolater. The wrath of God has not been revealed from heaven more frequently, or in more awful terms, again&s;t any one cla&s;s of &s;inners, than again&s;t idolaters. And one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing characters of the great apo&s;tacy from the faith, foretold, is
<PB N="45" REF="010068_0043_0F7C75AA04E06DA8">idolatry, will-wor&s;hip, a voluntary, affected hu|mility, and wor&s;hipping of angels and demons. 'The Spirit &s;pake expre&s;ly, that in the latter times &s;ome &s;hould apo&s;tatize from the faith, giving heed to erroneous &s;pirits, and doctrines concerning demons, thro' the hypocri&s;y of lyars, having feared con&s;ciences; forbidding to marry, and commanding to ab&s;tain from meats, which God,' &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. IV. 1, 2, 3. The author has followed the learned and excellent Mr. Jo&s;. Mede's tran&s;lation of this pa&s;&s;age, which is unque&s;tionably the mo&s;t grammatical and proper.</NOTE> It is &s;o much ea&s;ier to find all the&s;e characters in a certain church now in the world, than the marks of a true one; that there is hardly any room to doubt about the right application of them.</P>
<P>The ancient Babylon was famous for idola|try; of which it &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t &s;eat after the flood; perhaps was the principal, for a con&s;iderable time before either Egypt or Phoenicia obtained the infamous preheminence. If &s;o, this &s;ugge&s;ts one intelligible rea&s;on, why the apo&s;tate, idolatrous party in the chri&s;tian world &s;hould be de&s;igned by the &s;pirit of pro|phecy, under the title of Babylon: And even the Romancatholics generally own, that Rome is the Babylon of the new te&s;tament; only they &s;ay, it is Rome pagan, not chri&s;tian. Which, tho' &s;aid without any good rea&s;on, and even con|trary to &s;trong evidence, was yet nece&s;&s;ary for them to &s;ay; unle&s;s they would farther own, that the mo&s;t dreadful cur&s;es in the whole bible are
<PB N="46" REF="010068_0044_0F7C75AAA60F5110">pointed directly again&s;t them&s;elves; for the&s;e are pointed again&s;t Babylon. Nor is it wholly unworthy of remark, that the modern Babylon al&s;o nearly re&s;embles the ancient in re&s;pect of the particular kind of death, which &s;he inflicts on tho&s;e, who renounce her idolatrous wor&s;hip. In the ancient, they who would not fall down and wor&s;hip idols, were ca&s;t into a furnace of fire: In the modern, burning to death is the ordinary puni&s;hment for &s;uch di&s;&s;enters and &s;chi&s;matics; <HI>and in her is found the blood of prophets and of &s;aints.</HI> The former was a mo&s;t inhuman enemy and per&s;ecutor of God's peo|ple: But yet, where &s;he &s;lew her thou&s;ands, the latter has &s;lain her ten thou&s;ands. So much does the pretended only true and unerring church exceed the ancient Babylon in execrable cruelty, per&s;ecution and tyranny!</P>
<P>Altho' there had been no other weighty ob|jection again&s;t the church of Rome, be&s;ides her idolatry, this alone would &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify tho&s;e who have renounced her communion: <Q>For what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?</Q> or his wor&s;hip, with that of bread, demons and images? But &s;o enormou&s;ly antichri&s;tian is this church in many other re&s;pects, that we might almo&s;t reckon idolatry it&s;elf among her le&s;&s;er errors and abominations! In one view of it, in|deed, or merely as it affects civil &s;ociety, it is far from being the greate&s;t. No per&s;on, &s;urely, can ever want good authority to leave the com|munion of &s;uch a church. A warrant for it may
<PB N="47" REF="010068_0045_0F7C75AB6244E748">be found in almo&s;t every page of the bible; par|ticularly Revel. xviii. Where, after a de&s;cription of Babylon as 'fallen,' or apo&s;tatized; as become the habitation of demons [<GAP DESC="foreign">] and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird, &amp;c. it follows, <Q>And I heard a voice from heaven, &s;aying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: For her &s;ins have reached unto heaven, and God hath re|membered her iniquities.</Q> This is &s;ufficient warrant to come out of a church, whether Rome or any other, to which the characters of Babylon actually agree. And how much &s;oever the church of Rome may cur&s;e tho&s;e of the Re|formation, or imprecate upon them the ven|geance of Peter, Paul, the <HI>Queen of heaven,</HI> and the other &s;aints; we may be pretty &s;ure, that they have neither power nor inclination to harm us on this account; that they will nei|ther de&s;troy us them&s;elves, nor pray God to do it. They who invocate them to this end, in &s;olemn form, and &s;upport and propagate what they mi&s;-call religion, by per&s;ecution, fire and &s;word; have far more rea&s;on to fear the im|precations of tho&s;e &s;aints that were &s;lain for the word of God, and for the te&s;timony which they held; whom John &s;aw under the altar, while they <Q>cried with a loud voice, &s;aying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do&s;t thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev.

<P>Dete&s;table as the idolatry of the church of Rome is, there are other of her principles and practices, as has been intimated, which more immediately affect the peace and order of civil &s;ociety, the honor of princes, and the liberty and common rights of mankind. Our contro|ver&s;y with her is not merely a religious one: It is not, on our part, only a defence of the wor&s;hip of one God by one Mediator, in op|po&s;ition to that of a thou&s;and demons or idols; of the authority of the &s;acred oracles, in oppo|&s;ition to that of idle legends and traditions; and of &s;ober rea&s;on in oppo&s;ition to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fanatici&s;m: But a defence of our laws, liberties, and civil rights as men, in oppo&s;ition to the proud claims and encroachments of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal per&s;ons, who under the pretext of religion, and &s;aving mens &s;ouls, would engro&s;s all power and property to them&s;elves, and reduce us to
<PB N="49" REF="010068_0047_0F7C75ADF3CC9EC0">the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery: It is a defence, if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, of the common rights of &s;eeing, hearing, touching, &s;melling, ta&s;ting; all which popery attacks and undermines, by the doctrihe of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation; and would take them from us, as a means of making us dutiful &s;ons, or rather wretched &s;laves of the church. We mu&s;t not &s;ee, ta&s;te or &s;mell, but as the church is plea&s;ed to give us leave. If &s;he &s;hews us a mor&s;el of bread, or a drop or two of wine, after the prie&s;t has played a few tricks with it; we mu&s;t believe it is no longer bread or wine, but God. And whatever el&s;e &s;he declares, we mu&s;t implicitly receive it on her authority, on pain of being burnt in this world, and damned in the next! So important is this controver&s;y, as the honourable founder of this lecture well knew; having him&s;elf written and publi&s;hed a learned di&s;&s;ertation relative thereto.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">On '&s;laves, and &s;ouls of men, Rev. XVIII. 13.</NOTE> Altho' we had no regard for true religion, yet we ought in rea&s;on and prudence to dete&s;t the church of Rome, in the &s;ame degree: that we prize our freedom. Her laws, more arbitrary than tho&s;e of Draco, are, in effect, like his, all written in blood. Popery and liberty are in|compatible; at irreconcileable enmity with each other. May gracious Heaven ever pre|&s;erve us from the one, and ble&s;s us with the other: At lea&s;t, if we are ever to be &s;o unhappy as to lo&s;e our liberty, God grant the lo&s;s may not be aggravated, by having it taken from us either by lordly, tyrannical prie&s;ts, or by
<PB N="50" REF="010068_0048_0F7C75AE738F95C0">tho&s;e of the laity, from whom we have the be&s;t rea&s;on to expect the defence and &s;ecurity of it.</P>
<P>Popery is now making great &s;trides in Eng|land; as great, perhaps, as it did in the reign either of Charles or James the &s;econd: I pray God, things may not at length be brought to as bad a pa&s;s! Thou&s;ands of weak and wicked Prote&s;tants are annually perverted to an impi|ous, horrid &s;y&s;tem of tyranny over the bodies and &s;ouls of men; which le&s;s de&s;erves the name of religion, than that of an outrage on the &s;en&s;es, and mo&s;t valuable rights of men, and a &s;atire upon God. If we may believe tho&s;e who pretend to know, and probably do, popi&s;h prie&s;ts, je&s;uits, and other emi&s;&s;aries, are very open and bold in our mother-country of late years, meeting with no vigorous oppo&s;i|tion: And even <HI>popi&s;h bi&s;hops re&s;ide there, and go about to exerci&s;e every part of their function, without offence.</HI> It &s;eems, there is far le&s;s good old prote&s;tant zeal than were to be wi&s;hed and expected: Many, who call them&s;elves prote|&s;tants, look upon popery as an harmle&s;s, in|different thing, notwith&s;tanding its inherent, re&s;tle&s;s, intolerant malignity, and mo&s;t de&s;truc|tive tendency. Heaven only knows what the end of the&s;e things will be; the pro&s;pect is alarming!</P>
<P>The agents of Rome, ever re&s;tle&s;s and &s;chem|ing, <HI>compa&s;s &s;ea and land to make pro&s;elytes</HI>; going about continually from country to coun|try, <HI>&s;eeking whom they may devour</HI>: And, pro|bably,
<PB N="51" REF="010068_0049_0F7C75AF1D9A7208">there is no prote&s;tant country, in which there are not &s;ome of them, at lea&s;t lurking, if they dare not di&s;cover them&s;elves. We &s;hould not be <HI>ignorant of their devices</HI>; nor ever off our guard again&s;t them. May this &s;eminary of learning, may the people, mini&s;ters and churches of New-England, ever be pre&s;erved from popi&s;h, and all other pernicious errors. Our Saviour, on a memorable occa&s;ion, &s;aid to the tempter, <Q>It is written, Thou &s;halt wor&s;hip the Lord thy God, and him only &s;halt thou &s;erve.</Q> If our popi&s;h tempters are not confounded and &s;ilenc'd with the like an&s;wer, it &s;eems as if they had even le&s;s mode&s;ty than he, who once &s;aid, as the church of Rome now, in effect, faith; <HI>If thou wilt fall down and wor&s;hip ME, all &s;hall be thine.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude: They who would keep them|&s;elves pure from ever &s;pecies of idolatry, mu&s;t not only ab&s;tain from the wor&s;hip of idols in the common gro&s;s &s;en&s;e, as practi&s;ed by Pagans and Papi&s;ts; but al&s;o from an inordinate love of this world, its plea&s;ures and enjoyments; and love God &s;upremely. The apo&s;tle &s;tiles a covetous man 'an idolater':<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. V. 5. and Col. III. 5.</NOTE> For there are many that make gold their hope, and &s;ay unto the fine gold, 'Thou art my confidence,' even before it is formed into an image by art, and man's device. By the &s;ame rule, all other wicked men are in &s;ome &s;en&s;e idolaters. What|ever u&s;urps that place, that preheminence in
<PB N="52" REF="010068_0050_0F7C75B17720DAA0">the affections of men, which is due to God alone; that is their idol, that is their God. How many idolaters are there then, even among prote&s;tants? They only, who love God above all things, wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth, whatever church they live in commuion with. May &s;uch wor&s;hippers, whom the Father &s;eeketh, be increa&s;ed in every church, to his glory; even till 'THE MAN OF SIN,' who&s;e coming is after the working of &s;atan, with all deceivablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in them that peri&s;h, &s;hall finally be con&s;umed by the breath of the Lord, and <Q>de&s;troyed with the brightne&s;s of his coming! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;.
