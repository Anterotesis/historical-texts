<P>WHAT is more &s;olemn than to &s;ee a man die!&mdash;to &s;ee a fellow-creature, who mu&s;t exi&s;t an eternity, take his departure immediately to the bar of God!&mdash;to have his &s;tate unalterably fixed, either in eternal life, or in utter darkne&s;s, everla&s;ting puni&s;hment and de&s;pair!&mdash;Death is the king of terrours, though viewed in his mo&s;t frequent and common forms; but to &s;ee one in health cut down in the mid&s;t of life, by the hand of ju&s;tice, O how &s;hocking! this fills the mind with ideas which can|not be expre&s;&s;ed. At the repeated reque&s;t of &s;uch an one, I am now to preach the la&s;t &s;ermon he is ever to hear! and, peradventure, the la&s;t which may ever be heard by many others in this a&s;&s;embly. What &s;erious addre&s;s becomes this occa&s;ion! Excellency of &s;peech, and artful words of man's wi&s;dom, &s;uit not this &s;olemnity. An at|tempt at this time to be curious would be inexcu&s;ably criminal; for if ever great plainne&s;s of &s;peech was ne|ce&s;&s;ary, it is now. The words cho&s;en for our text com|po&s;e

the prayer of a poor publican&mdash;the penitent, earne&s;t cry of a broken-hearted &s;inner, who went up into God's holy temple, but had &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of his &s;in and guilt, that he dared not come nigh, and, &s;tanding afar off, would not &s;o much as lift up his eyes to heaven, but &s;mote up|on his brea&s;t, &s;aying, <HI>God be merciful to me, a &s;inner!</HI></P>
<P>THIS, O <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> is a prayer for you, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and penitential manner; let this be the cry of your whole heart, every moment you have to live.</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing upon this &s;ubject, we &s;hall ob&s;erve the following method:</P>
<P>I. Inquire what is implied in a &s;inner's praying for mercy.</P>
<P>II. Con&s;ider what is compri&s;ed in God's &s;howing mercy to a praying &s;inner.</P>
<P>III. Improve the &s;ubject with &s;everal remarks and ad|dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>IN a &s;inner's praying for mercy is implied,</P>
<P N="1">1. A felt and unfeigned &s;en&s;e of &s;in. The publican realized his being a &s;inner; his heart was affected with a &s;en&s;e of it; and whoever heartily adopts his prayer, has a painful &s;en&s;e of &s;in again&s;t God&mdash;has become guilty be|fore God, and &s;ees he has done that abomination which the Lord hateth. His &s;in appears to cover his head like a thick cloud, and to cry, even unto heaven, again&s;t him. He is convicted of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the law of God&mdash;a law that is holy, ju&s;t and good; and the con&s;equence of &s;uch conviction mu&s;t forever be what the Apo&s;tle confe&s;&s;ed, <HI>I am carnal, &s;old under &s;in:</HI> He can offer no excu&s;e for his conduct&mdash;can plead nothing in his favour&mdash;can find no one circum&s;tance that could in the lea&s;t alleviate his guilt. Thus he &s;tands condemned by God&mdash;&s;en&s;ibly condemned by his holy law&mdash;condemned by the whole bible. The law, with a voice like the thunder of Mount
<PB N="7" REF="020721_0005_0FB0E2E238BD9E98">
Sinai, cur&s;es him for not continuing in all things written therein, to do them. When he looks to the go&s;pel, he finds he has been guilty of the &s;in of unbelief; and that he who believeth not is condemned already. He finds, yea, he now feels, the &s;entence of condemnation in his own &s;oul; for both rea&s;on and con&s;cience fla&s;h in his face. Heaven and earth are ready to witne&s;s again&s;t him, and judgment is before him. He apprehends God will immediately enter into judgment with him;&mdash;it appears amazing, and pa&s;&s;ing wonder, that he has not done it long ago. There appears no probability that his final doom will be delayed any longer; and if not, he knows he cannot &s;tand in the judgment, but mu&s;t fall under condemnation, to all eternity. He &s;ees he has no right to any thing temporal or &s;piritual: when he treads on the earth, he cumbereth the ground&mdash;he breathes not a breath but by mere &s;ufferance. It appears truth to him, that God could not puni&s;h him too much; that everla&s;t|ing &s;ufferings are his due, and God mu&s;t be ju&s;t, do with him what he will. Such a &s;en&s;e of &s;in is occa&s;ioned by a proper &s;ight of God's law; <HI>for by the law is the know|ledge of &s;in.</HI> The law makes &s;in revive, and become ex|ceedingly &s;inful. A true &s;ight of the law is a di&s;covery of its holine&s;s and &s;pirituality, as exhibiting the infinite glory of the ble&s;&s;ed God; and until one has &s;uch a &s;ight of the exceeding holine&s;s of this law, as &s;ets the glory of the divine perfections in the mo&s;t awful and adorable view, he is in the &s;ame &s;ituation of mind with a per&s;e|cuting <HI>Saul&mdash;alive without the law;</HI> he has no true &s;en&s;e of &s;in, and no proper idea of his own real character: but when he is brought to &s;ee this, then &s;in appears what it really is&mdash;a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law, oppo&s;ition to ho|line&s;s, and enmity again&s;t God. This lays the founda|tion
<PB N="8" REF="020721_0006_0FB0E2E6942374E0">
of that painful and unfeigned &s;en&s;e of &s;in, which we have been attempting a little to de&s;cribe. Here we may ob&s;erve, that in a true &s;en&s;e of &s;in, one is not affected bare|ly with the fear of puni&s;hment, or the &s;ufferings which are his ju&s;t wages; but it is a &s;en&s;e of his having &s;inned again&s;t God, that breaks his heart; his having di&s;hon|oured a holy God, and injured his infinitely &s;acred char|acter:&mdash;this wounds his &s;pirit! this gives him his greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s! <HI>David</HI> &s;inned, and &s;hed innocent blood; and a dreadful &s;entence from God proceeded again&s;t him&mdash;that the &s;word &s;hould never depart from his hou&s;e; yet when he was brought to a true &s;en&s;e of what he had done, he found &s;omething in his conduct more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to his &s;oul, than all his puni&s;hment; it was this, <HI>Again&s;t thee, thee only, have I &s;inned, and done this evil in thy &s;ight.</HI> And when the prodigal &s;on came to him&s;elf, and returned to his father, he did not &s;ay, Father I have &s;inned, and have undone my&s;elf&mdash;I have been &s;tarving in foreign lands, and I am now peri&s;hing with hunger:&mdash;no; there was &s;omething in his conduct more affecting to his &s;oul, than his own wretchedne&s;s&mdash;more painful, than his hunger&mdash;it was this&mdash;<HI>Father, I have &s;inned again&s;t heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy &s;on.</HI> The penitent &s;inner is not in&s;en&s;ible of his own mi&s;ery, neither is he at all indifferent as to his peri&s;hing circum&s;tances. The publican cries for mercy, and the prodigal begs for the bread of an hired &s;ervant; but, at the &s;ame time, in a true &s;en&s;e of &s;in. The di&s;honour and injury done to our|&s;elves appears comparatively &s;mall, to the di&s;honour and injury done to a holy God.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN this prayer is implied, a realizing &s;en&s;e of de|pendence on God. The &s;inner finds him&s;elf peri&s;hing&mdash;that he has de&s;troyed him&s;elf, and is &s;inking under the
<PB N="9" REF="020721_0007_0FB0E2E9A82A0738">
in&s;upportable weight of his guilt&mdash;that help he mu&s;t have, and &s;uch help, too, as Almighty God alone can give. He &s;ees the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of his helping him&s;elf&mdash;that he can make no atonement for his crimes&mdash;it would avail him nothing, &s;hould he give his body to be burned for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, or the fruit of his body for the &s;in of his &s;oul&mdash;that <HI>Lebanon</HI> is not &s;ufficient to burn, nor all the bea&s;ts thereof, for a burnt-offering; he therefore re|nounces all hope in him&s;elf, and looks to God, &s;aying, with <HI>David, Help, Lord, for vain is the help of man.</HI> The &s;inner who thus pro&s;trates him&s;elf at the throne of grace, is &s;en&s;ible, if God appears for him, it will be mer|cy, pure &s;overeign mercy, and if not, it will be ju&s;t. Every gleam of hope is in the mercy of that God who hath a &s;overeign right either to ca&s;t off or &s;ave&mdash;to kill or make alive. He hath now but this one petition, <HI>God be mer|ciful to me, a &s;inner!</HI> and if this fail, he mu&s;t &s;ink into de&s;pair&mdash;his mouth is &s;topped, for there is no other plea. God would be ju&s;t in withholding his mercy from &s;inners. He is under no obligation to manife&s;t it to any one; though it is otherwi&s;e with man; it is criminal in us not to &s;how mercy to the utmo&s;t of our ability, for this plain rea&s;on, we have all, in a greater or le&s;s degree, received mercy at the hand of God. Every moment we have lived, every thing temporal and &s;piritual we have enjoyed, is the fruit of mere mercy; and if we have freely re|ceived, we ought freely to give. We are under obligation to be like God. Does God forgive enemies? &s;o mu&s;t we. Does he do good to the evil and unthankful? &s;o mu&s;t we. Do we pray, forgive us our tre&s;pa&s;&s;es? then we mu&s;t forgive, from our very heart, all tho&s;e who have tre&s;|pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t us. The &s;ervant, who had no compa&s;&s;ion on his fellow-&s;ervant, was condemned; and the rea&s;on
<PB N="10" REF="020721_0008_0FB0E2EA83070258">
of his condemnation was, that, a little before, his Lord forgave him his whole debt. Hence we have this com|mand, <HI>Be ye merciful, as your Father al&s;o is merciful.</HI> But God hath been laid under no &s;uch obligation, <HI>for who hath fir&s;t given unto him?</HI> And this is realized by him who feels his ab&s;olute dependence on &s;overeign mercy. O who can de&s;cribe the &s;ituation of one who &s;tands guilty before God, having nothing but eternity in view&mdash;&s;en&s;ible of de&s;erving nothing but frowns&mdash;feeling him&s;elf on the brink of de&s;erved ruin, and there wholly dependent on the mere plea&s;ure of an angry Judge&mdash;an injured God&mdash;who knows what he has done, and now beholds his &s;in with perfect indignation, and can, with infinite ea&s;e, glo|rify him&s;elf in his condemnation! He pleads for mercy, but is &s;en&s;ible that he pleads for unde&s;erved, uncovenanted mercy. He repeats his reque&s;t, but feels him&s;elf un|worthy, of all &s;inners the mo&s;t unworthy, of being heard. He knows he mu&s;t peri&s;h forever, if his &s;uit is not grant|ed; but, alas! it now comes fre&s;h to his remembrance, how many times he has &s;lighted this mercy. God hath called, and he hath refu&s;ed; the Lord hath &s;tretched out his hand, and he hath di&s;regarded; and that he might now laugh at his calamity, and mock at his fear. But notwith&s;tanding all this, he has no where el&s;e to go for help, but unto God; he is therefore re&s;olved to pro&s;trate his &s;oul before the throne of all grace, and if he dies, to die at the feet of Sovereign Mercy. His final conclu&s;ion is this, <HI>Let me fall now into the hand of the Lord,</HI> and if I peri&s;h, I peri&s;h!</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS prayer implies an apprehen&s;ion of the mercy of God. God is merciful in him&s;elf. He is a God of great and tender mercy. There mu&s;t be a greatne&s;s in that mercy, which can reach a &s;inner's ca&s;e. Of this
<PB N="11" REF="020721_0009_0FB0E2EC112DFEB8">
<HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was &s;en&s;ible, when pleading for a &s;inful people; he &s;ays, <HI>Pardon, I be&s;eech thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatne&s;s of thy mercy.</HI> And again, <HI>Let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou ha&s;t &s;poken, the Lord long-&s;uffering, and of great mercy.</HI> This is found in God. Here is mercy, of &s;uch eminence, and infinite power, as removes every thing that lies in its way; it triumphs over &s;in and guilt; it leaps over mountains of iniquity and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and makes its way into the &s;tubborn heart. Many of the chief of &s;inners have been made the joyful captives of this all-conquering mercy. We, of the human race, have had abundant opportunity to know, that the divine nature is &s;uch as delights in mer|cy. We were mi&s;erable&mdash;God pitied us. We were &s;inful,&mdash;God dete&s;ted us; yet though we were an abhorrence in his &s;ight, his mercy neither cea&s;ed nor abated: witne&s;s Chri&s;t's dying for the ungodly. This is the mercy craved in the text. The poor &s;inner apprehends the glorious truth; upon this his eye fixes, whil&s;t he cea&s;es not to implore this &s;overeign help; and mercy! mercy! is his repeated cry.</P>
<P>THE &s;inner at this time apprehends a fullne&s;s in the mercy of God. If he has any hope, he mu&s;t &s;ee enough in God to relieve him; and he who &s;ees him&s;elf, mu&s;t &s;ee, that nothing &s;hort of infinite is enough&mdash;yea, &s;o far from being &s;ufficient, that all that men or angels could do for him, would not give him the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible relief. Nothing but an infinite fullne&s;s of grace&mdash;nothing but an arm ab&s;olutely almighty, &s;tretched out by infinite mercy, can reach down to the gates of hell, where he now finds him&s;elf &s;inking; therefore he prays, <HI>God be merciful!</HI>&mdash;as much as to &s;ay, thou art merciful&mdash;an inexhau&s;tible ocean of grace is in thee. O di&s;play all that fullne&s;s and
<PB N="12" REF="020721_0010_0FB0E2F02544B1F8">
infinite freene&s;s of mercy, and thus appear for my help. <HI>David</HI> had this view of his own &s;ituation and others, when he called upon God in the&s;e words&mdash;<HI>Stir up thy &s;trength, and come and &s;ave us.</HI> He &s;aw, if God did not appear in all his &s;trength, in all his omnipotence, they could not be &s;aved. Such is the &s;ituation of every &s;inner; and &s;urely for God to appear in this manner, for the re|lief of a poor, peri&s;hing &s;oul, is a di&s;play of infinite mercy.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE prayer expre&s;&s;ed in the text implies &s;ome ap|prehen&s;ion of the method of &s;alvation. The publican evidently conceived it po&s;&s;ible for God to &s;how mercy in a way con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, that he might be ju&s;t in doing it; and this was his encouragement to pray&mdash;his only &s;upport. For though God is merciful, yet if the way was not open, in which he might manife&s;t it, ac|cording to righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth, it could never appear. This mercy is of too divine a nature, to have flown out in any way, that would in the lea&s;t have injured the holy law of God, his ju&s;tice, or any of his adorable perfections; and if &s;ome method is not revealed in which this can be done, there is no hope. Fallen angels know God is merciful, but this gives them no hope; for they have had no intimations of any way being devi&s;ed, in which God can be reconciled to them; therefore there mu&s;t be &s;ome apprehen&s;ion of the go&s;pel method of &s;alvation, wherever a &s;inner addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the throne of grace. This apprehen&s;ion may be very dark, as we know it al|ways was before the &s;ufferings and death of our Lord and Saviour; but God had even then, in various ways, pro|claimed his name in relation to &s;inners of the human race, the Lord God gracious and merciful. Ever &s;ince that early promi&s;e, <HI>The &s;eed of the woman &s;hall brui&s;e the &s;er|pent's
<PB N="13" REF="020721_0011_0FB0E2F2D1DE14D8">
head,</HI> it has been known in our world, that God de&s;igned mercy for the fallen race of <HI>Adam.</HI> This hath been believed by true penitents, in all generations; and they have always been per&s;uaded, that in &s;howing mercy, God would take care of his own glory, and do it in a way that &s;hould harmonize with all his perfections. This way of &s;alvation, through a Mediator, is made clear and plain to us, in the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>who died, the j<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> for the unju&s;t,</HI> and <HI>bore our &s;ins in his own body, on the tree</HI>&mdash;who fulfilled the law by his holy and obedient life, and &s;atisfied divine ju&s;tice by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf, and hath thus brought in an everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, that, through the redemption which is in his blood, we might be ju&s;t|ified freely by the grace of God. This precious redemp|tion&mdash;this complete atonement, is the &s;inner's refuge&mdash;is the grand pillar of all his hopes; on this is grounded that peculiar hope, which, as an anchor to the &s;oul, reach|ing within the veil, is &s;ure and &s;teadfa&s;t. When once the true penitent has a view of this glorious method of &s;al|vation, it appears &s;o complete, &s;o every way &s;uited to his circum&s;tances, that he will hope&mdash;he cannot but tru&s;t his immortal all in the hands of Je&s;us; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, he can &s;ay, if I had a thou&s;and &s;ouls to &s;ave, I could tru&s;t them all on this glorious foundation. Thus, weary and heavy laden with &s;in and guilt, he flies to the faithful arms of ever|la&s;ting love; and O! what excellency appears in Chri&s;t! unto him <HI>he is precious&mdash;altogether lovely&mdash;the chiefe&s;t of ten thou&s;ands;</HI> worthy to be loved, and adored with the whole heart, in time and eternity, on account of his own glories, he <HI>being the brightne&s;s of the Father's glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on.</HI> And notwith&s;tanding the great &s;en&s;e he has of his &s;infulne&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, this di&s;|covery of the mercy of God in Chri&s;t &s;trengthens his
<PB N="14" REF="020721_0012_0FB0E2F43A2FEB78">
&s;oul, and afre&s;h &s;upports him to agonize in prayer, and to cry with the mo&s;t earne&s;t importunity, <HI>God be merciful to me, a &s;inner!</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;hall now pa&s;s to the con&s;ideration of the &s;econd general head of this di&s;cour&s;e; which was, to con&s;ider what is compri&s;ed in God's &s;howing mercy to a &s;inner:&mdash;</P>
<P>AND, in the fir&s;t place, &s;hall ob&s;erve, this mercy con|tains a pardon of &s;in.</P>
<P>THE publican undoubtedly had this, fir&s;t, and princi|pally, in view&mdash;that God, for his own name's &s;ake, would pardon his &s;in; for, when he received a gracious an&s;wer, he went down to his hou&s;e, ju&s;tified.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The publican's being &s;aid to be ju&s;tified rather than the other, who was a &s;elf-righteous phari&s;ee, mu&s;t mean, that he was ju&s;tified, and the other was not; for we know of no &s;uch thing, as being ju&s;tified in part, or pardoned in part; when the Lord giveth, he giveth liberally, and upbraideth not.</NOTE> And we con&s;ider ju&s;tification as an act of God's free grace, wherein he pardoneth all our &s;ins. When God ju&s;tifies, he does it freely and fully: <HI>he will abundantly pardon</HI> the truly penitent. The publican a&s;ked a pardon of all his &s;ins, and in his ju&s;tification he received a full pardon, and went rejoicing home. Nothing &s;hort of this would have &s;at|isfied him, or in any degree have relieved his troubled &s;oul. The pardoning grace of God extends to &s;inners, only on account of the atonement made by Chri&s;t, which is received, and tru&s;ted in, as complete, and divinely &s;uitable, as we have already attempted to de&s;cribe. This is go&s;pel faith, the &s;ubjects of which are con&s;idered as being in Chri&s;t; and as Chri&s;t <HI>hath fini&s;hed tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and made an end of &s;in, their &s;ins are taken away</HI>&mdash;their iniquities are <HI>blotted out as a cloud,</HI> and their <HI>tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions as a thick cloud; for there is now no condemnation to them who are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s, the glorious and complete righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us, is imputed unto them,
<PB N="15" REF="020721_0013_0FB0E2F5B5EFFBC0">
which pre&s;ents them faultle&s;s to the eye of holine&s;s it&s;elf. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute &s;in,</HI> to whom <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s is imputed</HI> by faith: this is free grace&mdash;this is mercy indeed!</P>
<P N="2">2. IN God's &s;howing mercy to a &s;inner, there is not only this act of free forgivene&s;s, but there is al&s;o by the Holy Gho&s;t an application of his pardoning love to the &s;oul. <HI>The love of God is &s;hed abroad in the heart,</HI> which immediately removes the guilt of &s;in; the heart is &s;prin|kled from an evil con&s;cience. All &s;in loads the con&s;cience with guilt, but <HI>the blood of Je&s;us clean&s;eth from all &s;in.</HI> A believing application of this gives in&s;tant freedom to the &s;oul that is bowed down under a &s;en&s;e of the mo&s;t aggravated guilt. O! how heavy is the guilt of inno|cent blood! it made <HI>Cain</HI> cry out, <HI>My puni&s;hment is great|er than I can bear. David,</HI> &s;inking under this weight, cries out in agonies of pain, <HI>Deliver me from blood guilt|ine&s;s, O God!</HI> His earne&s;tne&s;s is like one who feels, that if God &s;hould not deliver him, he mu&s;t &s;ink into hell. But here is deliverance; the atoning blood of Je&s;us re|moves even the guilt of blood. Though innocent blood has a voice &s;o loud as to reach heaven with its avenging cries, yet the&s;e cries, by an application of a crucified Chri&s;t, are &s;ilenced in a moment. We read, that the blood of <HI>Abel</HI> cried unto God, from the ground&mdash;it cried for vengeance again&s;t the murderer; but the blood of &s;prinkling, the blood of Je&s;us, &s;peaketh better things&mdash;it &s;peaketh peace! peace! and all is peace! The whole weight of guilt is gone&mdash;the wounded con&s;cience is healed&mdash;the deepe&s;t &s;tains of &s;in are wa&s;hed away. This, even this, is compri&s;ed in the mercy of God to &s;inners.</P>
<P N="3">3. DIVINE mercy does not &s;top here; it is &s;o rich&mdash;&s;o abundant, as to bring penitents home to God, and
<PB N="16" REF="020721_0014_0FB0E2FB06C7AFF0">
adopt them as the children of his family. <HI>Behold what manner of love the Father hath be&s;towed upon us, that we &s;hould be called the &s;ons of God.</HI> God &s;ends forth <HI>the &s;pirit of his Son into their hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</HI> When the prodigal repented and returned, he not only received a pardon, but was cla&s;pt in his Father's arms; his pardon was &s;ealed with parental ki&s;&s;es; he was again called a &s;on; the father &s;aid to his &s;ervants, bring forth the be&s;t robe, and put it on him, and let a joyful fea&s;t be made ready: <HI>for this my &s;on was dead, and is alive; he was lo&s;t, and is found.</HI> So, likewi&s;e, when God has mercy on a &s;inner, he &s;eals his pardon with every tender expre&s;&s;ion of love. <HI>After ye believed,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>ye were &s;ealed with that holy &s;pirit of promi&s;e;</HI> and the immediate effect of this is <HI>peace with God, joy and peace in believing.</HI> The poor &s;inner is now made to rejoice with that joy which is <HI>un&s;peakable and full of glory.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. PERFECT holine&s;s, and the full enjoyment of God to all eternity, are compri&s;ed in God's &s;howing mercy to a penitent, praying &s;inner. When a &s;inner is fir&s;t brought to repentance, he is, in &s;ome degree, the &s;ubject of ho|line&s;s&punc; for repentance implies hatred to &s;in, and love to righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is holine&s;s. After &s;uch a change, his life is a warfare again&s;t &s;in; he hates it in all its forms and delu&s;ive charms; he groans earne&s;tly for deliverance; he looks on him whom he hath pierced, and mourns; whil&s;t he longs, and hungers and thir&s;te for righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;to be holy like God and Chri&s;t. The&s;e affections will increa&s;e, as long as he lives; and when death &s;hall do his kind office, and lay his body a&s;leep in Je&s;us, then he will live indeed; for, being freed from that body of death, under which he groaned while he lived, he comes to the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that promi&s;e in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, <HI>He
<PB N="17" REF="020721_0015_0FB0E2FD5C764528">
&s;hall &s;ave his people from their &s;ins.</HI> Now the &s;cenes of &s;orrow clo&s;e, and the &s;cenes of joy and immortality open. Now, adieu to an alluring world and tempting devil&mdash;a long farewell to a &s;piritual warfare and manifold tribu|lations&mdash;welcome life and glory. Thus being made free as a cele&s;tial, and bearing the image of the heavenly, he pa&s;&s;es, as in a moment, to the paradi&s;e of God&mdash;the Jeru&s;alem which is above, to join the general a&s;&s;embly of the church of the fir&s;t-born, who&s;e names are written in the Lamb's book of life; there to be gue&s;t with &s;aints and angels, and, what is more, to dwell in the eternal light, in the pre&s;ence of God, where there is fullne&s;s of joy; and at his right hand, where there are plea&s;ures forevermore. And the Lamb in the mid&s;t of the throne &s;hall feed him, and lead him unto fountains of living waters, and God &s;hall wipe away all tears from his eyes: here <HI>the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and his weary &s;oul is forever at re&s;t. Eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them who love him.</HI> But, my brethren, by faith we may look with|in the veil, and behold the redeemed &s;tanding on Mount Zion, clothed in white robes, having their Father's name in their foreheads, with crowns upon their heads, and palms in their hands, &s;inging the new &s;ong before the throne of God and the Lamb: for by faith we &s;ee things which are invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>HAVING thus attended to the doctrinal parts of this &s;ubject, we &s;hall now proceed to an improvement.</P>
<P>FROM what hath been &s;aid, we may learn the great encouragement &s;inners have to look to God for mercy. The Lord hath already looked mercifully towards &s;inners. With an eye of tender pity and infinite compa&s;&s;ion, he hath viewed our deplorable &s;ituation; for mercy hath
<PB N="18" REF="020721_0016_0FB0E391ED0E06F0">
plea&s;ed him. A glorious work of redemption hath been &s;et on foot by everla&s;ting love and infinite wi&s;dom, which have joined in planning and laying it out; and all things have been well ordered and made &s;ure by Almighty Power; and for a long while God hath been pa&s;&s;ing before &s;inners, in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, &s;aying, live! live! for I have found a ran&s;om. And there is not only a door opened, through which God may &s;how mercy to &s;inners, but there is an appointed Mediator, in who&s;e ever-pre|vailing name, we may come to the throne of grace, and plead for mercy, with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;urance; for he that cometh before God, believing the truth as it is witne&s;&s;ed in Je&s;us, <HI>&s;hall in no wi&s;e be ca&s;t out&punc;</HI> Sinners may venture to draw near to God, through the glorious Mediator; yea, they have a good warrant to come; yea, more, they have a free and urgent invitation to come&mdash;<HI>The &s;pirit and the bride &s;ay, come. And let him that heareth, &s;ay, come. And let him that is athir&s;t, come: and who&s;over will, let him take the water of life freely.</HI> The greatne&s;s of God's mercy is an encouragement; it is exceeding great; it pa&s;&s;eth knowledge&mdash;is beyond all compari&s;on&mdash;nothing but God him&s;elf can repre&s;ent it. The greatne&s;s and extent thereof can be mea&s;ured only by infinite lines; where it is di&s;played, it &s;natches the &s;inner from eternal mi&s;ery&mdash;it places him in eternal happine&s;s. The freene&s;s and readine&s;s of this mercy is an encouragement; it ap|pears in the moment of di&s;tre&s;s. God is a pre&s;ent help in trouble. He looketh <HI>down from the height of his &s;anc|tuary, to hear the groaning of the pri&s;oner, and to loo&s;e tho&s;e who are appointed to death.</HI> He is more ready to give his holy &s;pirit unto &s;uch as truly a&s;k it, than earthly parents are to give bread to their own children. This mercy is not only great and free, but it is al&s;o &s;ure and
<PB N="19" REF="020721_0017_0FB0E393EC106D10">
effectual. The &s;oul that receives it can never fail. <HI>The gifts and callings of God are without repentance;</HI> they are <HI>the &s;ure mercies of</HI> David. There is al&s;o this encourage|ment, that God hath appointed repentance unto life eter|nal; and, what is &s;till more, he hath exalted Je&s;us Chri&s;t to give repentance, and hath added, even to this, his promi&s;e, that he will have mercy on &s;inners, who truly repent. <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his way, and the unright|eous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and unto our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</HI> This, certainly, is encourag|ing; for it is offering mercy on the lowe&s;t terms; for he who repents not, and for&s;akes not his unrighteous way, cannot inherit the favour of God, for it is an holy gift, and cannot be received or enjoyed by an unholy and im|penitent heart. Be&s;ides, we have examples to encourage us. The poor publican found mercy; the prodigal, who only &s;ought for a ma&s;ter, found a father, and one too who had bowels and mercies. <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> who filled <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI> with innocent blood, was not out of the reach of God's pardoning mercy. O unmea&s;urable, un&s;earch|able grace! Why then &s;hall any one de&s;pair, or ever cea&s;e to cry, <HI>God be merciful to me, a &s;inner!</HI></P>
<P>I WOULD now addre&s;s a few words to this numerous audience, to look to God for mercy.</P>
<P>MY dear fellow-mortals, we all &s;tand in need of mercy, <HI>for all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God,</HI> and <HI>the wages of &s;in is death.</HI> He that is to &s;uffer this day, is not the only one in this a&s;&s;embly under the &s;entence of death; for death hath pa&s;&s;ed upon all, for all have &s;inned. <HI>Man goeth to his long home</HI>&mdash;born on by time's &s;wift wings. We are going whence we &s;hall not return. No more &s;hall we return to our hou&s;e; our place &s;hall know
<PB N="20" REF="020721_0018_0FB0E395C26B6668">
us no more. But it is not only <HI>appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.</HI> The &s;olemn moment is fa&s;t approaching, when all our &s;tates will be fixed for an eternity; and he that is unju&s;t, &s;hall be unju&s;t &s;till; and he that is filthy, &s;hall be filthy &s;till; and he that is righteous, &s;hall be righteous &s;till; and he that is holy, &s;hall be holy &s;till. You &s;ee, my dear hearers, that at the her of God there is only this one di&s;tinction, holy and unholy, ju&s;t and unju&s;t; and it will there be decided, unto which of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es we belong, and we mu&s;t take our overla&s;ting portion accordingly, for from this deci&s;ion there is no appeal. And can we be ju&s;t, righteous, and holy, without the mercy of God? Can we be thus of our&s;elves? No; it is the highe&s;t arrogance and pre&s;ump|tion to &s;uppo&s;e it. Shall man be ju&s;t before God? Shall any &s;on of man pre&s;ume he is righteous? Folly and mad|ne&s;s all! <HI>What is man that he &s;hould be clean?</HI> Behold! God putteth no &s;uch tru&s;t in his &s;aints, and <HI>the heavens are not clean in his &s;ight&mdash;how much more abominable and filthy is man, who drinketh iniquity like water!</HI> The&s;e are the words of everla&s;ting truth; and though by nature we are thus unholy, and far from righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet, as truly as God liveth, without holine&s;s and perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord in peace. Do we not then &s;tand in need of mercy, and infinite di&s;plays of mercy too? By God's free &s;pirit we mu&s;t have an application of the blood of Je&s;us made to our &s;ouls, that our &s;ins may be wa&s;hed away; we mu&s;t have the love of God &s;hed abroad in our hearts, that our con&s;ciences may be purged from &s;in and dead works, by an act of the free grace of God the Father; the glorious and complete righteou&s;ne&s;s of Je&s;us Chri&s;t mu&s;t be imputed unto us for our ju&s;tification&mdash;And is not this mercy, for God to do all this for poor hell-de&s;erving &s;in|ners?
<PB N="21" REF="020721_0019_0FB0E397B797CFC0">
Therefore, in the name and by the authority of the Son of God, I mu&s;t te&s;tify unto you all, who hear me this day, except you have all this done for you by the mere mercy of God, you mu&s;t be everla&s;tingly damned! O &s;inners! be not angry with this plain dealing with your &s;ouls; if you will not believe this to be truth, you mu&s;t run the awful hazard of your unbelief; but, for my&s;elf, I dare not &s;hun to declare the whole coun&s;el of God! O realize your dependence on God; remember your help is alone in the arm of Jehovah; all your encouragement is there. While then the door of mercy is open, be per&s;uaded to bow the knee&mdash;become beggars at the throne of grace. I know we may well blu&s;h to a&s;k &s;uch favours from one we have &s;o wronged, but nece&s;&s;ity calls for it; therefore, let every one be importunate for this mercy of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; great as it is, you mu&s;t all obtain it, or you cannot e&s;cape the wrath to come; yea, an eternity of happine&s;s depends upon your &s;ucce&s;s; go then, and take the publican's place, confe&s;s your guilt, and cry, <HI>God be merciful to me, a &s;inner!</HI> Never give over your &s;uit, what|ever di&s;couragements you may apprehend in the way, yet, look towards the holy temple, and the Lord will &s;end you an&s;wers of peace.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall now clo&s;e with a particular addre&s;s to the poor criminal, to look to God for mercy.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;aac Coombs,</HI> I have now, for the la&s;t time, to urge upon your mind, the&s;e important and eternal realities and will you then take one more view of your &s;ituation? You have &s;inned, and &s;hed innocent blood, for which you are condemned by an earthly judge. You have re|ceived &s;entence of death! and are now within one or two hours of your execution, which will &s;eparate your &s;oul and body. To-day your probation for eternity ends!
<PB N="22" REF="020721_0020_0FB0E39AB1100F00">
In a few hours, with you, time will be no longer! But there is &s;omething in your &s;ituation more &s;hocking than death! you have &s;inned again&s;t an holy God; you have poured contempt on his &s;acred authority; your heart has been &s;tout again&s;t God; and, after your hard and impenitent heart, you have &s;inned with an high hand, which you confe&s;s hath been again&s;t your own con&s;cience, and again&s;t &s;olemn warnings and reproofs; this is what gives death his &s;ting, <HI>the &s;ting of death is &s;in; for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of men;</HI> and you appear to be now expo&s;ed to this wrath. You have a &s;oul of an infinite value, and as we wi&s;h the &s;alvation of your immortal &s;pirit, we mu&s;t tell you plainly, you have not appeared to be a true penitent. Sometimes you have been affected with your &s;ituation, and we have been encouraged that you would lay it to heart; but, alas! the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions have &s;oon worn off, and you have di&s;|covered a &s;trong inclination to tho&s;e very &s;ins which have been your ruin. We mu&s;t, therefore, look upon you as being in the very <HI>gall of bitterne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>bond of iniquity.</HI> Life and death hath been &s;et before you&mdash;the way of repentance towards God, and faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath been pointed out to you, and there is no other way. Therefore, if you do not repent&mdash;hate &s;in, for&s;ake it, and turn to God, you cannot be &s;aved. For though God is merciful in Chri&s;t, to &s;uch as truly re|pent, yet he is a God of &s;trict ju&s;tice, he <HI>will, by no means, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the guilty.</HI> His law is exceeding broad. <HI>Who&s;oever is angry with his brother without a cau&s;e, &s;hall be in dan|ger of the judgment: but who&s;oever &s;hall &s;ay, thou fool, &s;hall he in danger of hell-fire.</HI> The&s;e are the true &s;ayings of God. O then! how great is your de&s;ert! you are going to appear before the Judge of all, to know the&s;e

truths from the bar of God; and if you are not there found intere&s;ted in Je&s;us, you mu&s;t immediately &s;ink down among&s;t the &s;pirits in pri&s;on, to &s;uffer the vengeance of eternal fire, to dwell with everla&s;ting burnings. Your poor &s;oul will be &s;entenced by the Judge of quick and dead, to welter out an eternity under his &s;corching wrath. If <HI>Cain,</HI> for &s;heding the blood of a brother, mu&s;t <HI>be avenged &s;even fold,</HI> truly, if &s;trict ju&s;tice takes place in thee, for &s;heding the blood of a nearer relation, thou mu&s;t be avenged <HI>&s;eventy and &s;even fold.</HI> Think how much blood there is in your ca&s;e. You confe&s;s the people of God have cleared their garments of your blood.
