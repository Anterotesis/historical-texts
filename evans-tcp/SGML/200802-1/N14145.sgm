<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now going on three years &s;ince I fir&s;t wrote this piece. Great and glorious events have &s;ince taken place in our po|litical affairs; and, I hope, the day is not far di&s;tant when peace, on the mo&s;t honourable and advantageous terms, for America, &s;hall be proclaimed throughout the&s;e United States. However, not knowing now much longer the war, by rea&s;on of our &s;ins, might be continued, I concluded it might not be ami&s;s to ca&s;t my mite into the trea&s;ury, in order to vindicate the conduct of all tho&s;e brave officers and men who have already, and may yet fall in the American war, in defence of our rights and liberties, civil and religious; and al&s;o to clear up the doubts and &s;cruples of tender con&s;ciences, as to the lawfulne&s;s of taking up arms in any ca&s;e what&s;oever. I acknowledge that there have already been many able pens employed in &s;tating the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, and none, in my opinion, merits more our thanks than the author of Common Sen&s;e; but none, that I have &s;een, has, to my &s;atisfaction, cleared up the lawfulne&s;s of the u&s;e of defen&s;ive arms again&s;t tyrants and tyranny, whene|ver they &s;hall endeavour to deprive a people of their liberty and property. It is, &s;urely, a pity that &s;ome abler hand had not undertaken the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, who might have done greater ju&s;tice to the cau&s;e. All that I have, or chu&s;e, to &s;ay, in prai&s;e of the performance, is, that the author means hone&s;tly, and &s;hall ever pray for the &s;ucce&s;s of the American arms&punc; and tho&s;e of her allies, in the pre&s;ent ju&s;t defen&s;ive war; and that he never has, nor never means to &s;pare him&s;elf, whenever he may be called upon to face the enemies of his country, if even it &s;hould, as it may, co&s;t him his life; for where could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e offer it better than on the altar of religion and liberty, fighting in defence of both?</P>
<P>And now for a word of advice to the brave officers and &s;ol|diers compo&s;ing the American army.&mdash;Gentlemen officers, let m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> entreat you to de&s;i&s;t from all vice, and practice virtue; fear God and obey your &s;uperio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s; &s;et good examples before your men; be tender and careful of their lives and health; di&s;countenance vice and encourage virtue in them; do not correct nor abu&s;e them but according to martial law.&mdash;I once read of a good old general that was walking through his army, when at length, he &s;aw a young prodigal officer beating an old &s;oldier unmercifully: O! &s;ays the general, <HI>lay on, for you know that he dare not &s;trike you again!</HI> Which reproof, though very mode&s;t, covered the officer with blu&s;hes, and cau&s;ed him to de&s;i&s;t.&mdash;And, in fact, it is a &s;ure &s;ign of a coward, to be beating a man that we know dare not, for his life, re&s;i&s;t.</P>

Some time pa&s;t I was at We&s;t-Point, and &s;aw an officer, with an unmerciful club, beating a poor druken &s;oldier; and, after he was tired, ordered &s;ome under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to continue the cha&s;|ti&s;ement, which he did in a mo&s;t horrid manner, knocking him down, and beating him over head and face, until the blood gu&s;hed out of almo&s;t every part of his body; many officers ga|thering round, &s;aid <HI>lay on,</HI> and damning him that dare &s;ay otherways, until I thought he would have been killed right out: but at length one h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ne, good o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">cer &s;poke, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aid, &s;top! if he has done ami&s;s, confine him; and if, upon trial, he is found guilty, let him be puni&s;hed accordingly.&mdash;He was confined, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, puni&s;hed again for the &s;ame e&s;&s;ence; which is contrary to all ju&s;tice, to puni&s;h a man twice for the &s;ame crime.</P>
<P>And you, my dear brother &s;oldiers, let me beg of you to con&s;ider you have &s;ouls to be &s;aved or lo&s;t; therefore cea&s;e from the practi&s;e of &s;in, and practi&s;e holine&s;s in the fear of God; honour and obey your officers; and &s;ee that you become the true &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and not on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> he fighting &s;oldiers, but praying ones al&s;o.

of the American war from April 19, 1775, to June, 17, 1779, and we &s;hall not be wanting of in&s;tances of many &s;uffering by the hands of Briti&s;h tyranny, for maintaining this principle of &s;elf defence, in defence of our lives and liberties. It is well known that the Americans did not ha&s;tily, nor violently, ru&s;h in to the pre&s;ent war. They did petition, remon&s;trate, and re&s;trained trade; nay&punc; took every rea&s;onable method that rea|&s;onable creatures could invent, in order to prevent the effu&s;ion of human blood. But when they found all their humble pe|titions rejected, and treated with the greate&s;t &s;corn and con|tempt; and that nothing would go down with proud, haugh|ty North and his &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ly tool George the III, and their a&s;&s;ociates in wickedne&s;s, but a total &s;urrender of all our rights and li|berties, and an unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they did take up arms to defend them&s;elves from the unju&s;t and wicked en|croachments of haughty Britain; and, if we may judge from the &s;ucce&s;s of our arms, we may rationally conclude that hea|ven approves of our undertaking, and that the God of battle has gone forth with our armies.&mdash;But not to enlarge upon a &s;ubject &s;o manife&s;t, I now proceed to prove the lawfulne&s;s of taking up arms to oppo&s;e all tyranny, oppre&s;&s;ion, and tho&s;e who ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e and mi&s;u&s;e their authority.

<P>The two fir&s;t of the&s;e authors do treat of a defen&s;ive, war under the direction of a parliament, like that in England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the year 1645; and the two la&s;t of re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the abu&s;e of a lawful power, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no acce&s;s to maintain our rights and liberties in any other way; which &s;eems to come the near|e&s;t to our ca&s;e, for we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no Briti&s;h parliament to be conducted by; but, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thereof, had recour&s;e to a congre&s;s; nor did we ever di&s;pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e the lawfulne&s;s of the king of England's right to the crown, and to govern according to the laws and con&s;titution thereof; but when he and his creatures undertook to govern us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to law, then did we mo&s;t ju&s;tly undertake to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> encroachments of a tyrant.

<P>I &s;hall now endeavour to con&s;ider it more complexly and exten&s;ively, and plead both for re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the abu&s;e of a lawful power are again&s;t the u&s;e and u&s;urpation of a tyrannical power, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;er not only the lawfulne&s;s of re&s;i&s;ting kings, when they abu&s;e their power, as is made manife&s;t by the above named authors, but al&s;o the expediency and nece&s;&s;ity of the duty of re|&s;i&s;ting this tyrannical power, whenever we are, by a good pro|vidence of God, called there unto; and this we mu&s;t do, if we would not be found betrayers of the liberties of our country and brethren, together with the ruin of our poor po&s;terity, which, if we &s;hould neglect to do, we &s;hall be in&s;truments of delivering up the&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings into the devouring jaws of tyran|ny; which if we &s;hould be tame enough to do, &s;hall we not bring on us the cur&s;e of Meroz and the cur&s;e of our brethren's blood, crying for vengeance on the heads of the &s;hedders thereof, and upon all who being in a capacity came not to their re&s;cue;&mdash;and the cur&s;e of po&s;terity would have been upon us for not tran&s;mit|ing that liberty whereof we were, by the valour of our worthy forefathers, put and left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. I &s;hall not, therefore, re&s;trict my&s;elf to the que&s;tion propounded ordinarily, to wit, whether or not, when a limited king doth really injure, oppre&s;s, and invade his &s;ubjects civil rights and liberties, and &s;ends out his bloody emi&s;&s;aries, with armed violence again&s;t them; and when all redre&s;s, or hope, by any addre&s;s or petition, is rendered void; then, and in that ca&s;e, may a community of &s;uch &s;ubjects defend them&s;elves and their liberties by arms, in re&s;i&s;ting his bloody emi&s;&s;aries.

<P>In the fir&s;t place for clearing of this truth, and taking of mi&s;|takes, then conce&s;&s;ions may be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. I do allow that the ordinance of maje&s;tracy, which is of God, is not to be re&s;i&s;ted; no, not &s;o much as by di&s;obedience
<PB N="9" REF="017905_0005_0FA37A4C42DD0070">
or non-obedience; nay, not &s;o much as menta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, by cur&s;ing in the heart. Eccle&s;. x. 20. But a per&s;on clothed therewith abu|&s;ing his power, may be &s;o far re&s;i&s;ted; but tyrants, or magi&s;trates turning tyrants, are not God's ordinances; and there is no ha|zard of damnation for re&s;u&s;ing to obey their unju&s;t commands; but rather, the hazard of that is in walking willingly after the commandment, when the &s;tatutes of Omri are kept; &s;o that what is objected from Eccle&s;. viii. 2. 4. <HI>I coun&s;el thee to keep the king's commandments, &amp;c.</HI> Is to be under&s;tood only of the law|ful commands of lawful things.</P>
<P>Second. I do allow that rebellion is a damnable &s;in, except: where the word is taken in a lax &s;en&s;e, as I&s;rael of old is &s;aid to have rebelled again&s;t Rehoboam and good Hezekiah again&s;t Se|nacherib, which was a good rebellion and a clear duty. Being taken there for re&s;i&s;tance and revolt, in this &s;en&s;e, the Americans ri&s;ing in arms may be called rebellion, for it is right and lawful, to all intents and purpo&s;es, to rebel again&s;t tyrants, as all are who offer, or attempt, to govern contrary to the laws of the land; for where law cea&s;es, tyranny begins. But becau&s;e the word is generally taken in an evil &s;en&s;e, many do not make the proper di&s;tinction between a lawful rebellion again&s;t tyrants, and an unlawful one again&s;t lawful authority. As I &s;aid before, I do allow that rebellion again&s;t lawful magi&s;trates is a mo&s;t dam|nable &s;in, which was of old mo&s;t exemplarily puni&s;hed in Ko<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ah and his company, who rebelled again&s;t Mo&s;es and in Sheba and Ab&s;alom, who rebelled again&s;t David. <HI>For to puni&s;h the ju&s;t is not good, nor to &s;trike princes for equity.</HI> Prov. xvii. 26. <HI>And they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation.</HI> Rom. xiii. 2. So that this objection, brought from this place, as if the apo&s;tle was commanding their &s;ubjection, without re&s;i&s;tance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">o and &s;uch like tyrants as he, is very impertinent; and to explain this a little, I &s;hall &s;hew that the apo&s;tle was here vindicating chri&s;ti|anity from that reproach of ca&s;ting off, or refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing &s;ubjection to all magi&s;trates, as if chri&s;tian liberty had de&s;troyed that religion, or that they were not to be &s;ubject to heathen magi&s;trates; where upon, to undeceive them in this point he binds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">his duty of &s;ubjection to magi&s;trates for con&s;cience &s;ake in general; and it is very con&s;iderable what Buchanan &s;ays in his book <HI>(De Jure regni:)</HI> that Paul did not write to the kings them&s;elves becau&s;e they were not chri&s;tians, and therefore the more might be ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ne with from them, though they &s;hould not under&s;tand the duty of magi&s;trates. But upon &s;uppo&s;ition there had been &s;ome chri&s;ti|an king who had turned tyrant and a limited one al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ho by
<PB N="10" REF="017905_0006_0FA37A4D044B5D80">
his tyrannical proceedings, was endeavouring to overturn the laws, charters, and liberties of his &s;ubjects, what would he have written then? Surely if he had been like him&s;elf he would have denied that he &s;hould be owned for a king; and would have in|terdicted all chri&s;tian communion with him; and that they &s;hould account him no king, but &s;uch as they were to have no fellow&s;hip with according to the law of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Second. The apo&s;tle here was, no doubt, &s;peaking of law|ful rulers, not tyrants; but of all &s;uch as are defined and quali|fied here, being powers ordained of God, terrors to evil works, mini&s;ters of God for good. Yea, but &s;ay tories and their adhe|rents, the&s;e are only motives of &s;ubjection to all powers, not qualifications of the powers. To which I an&s;wer, they are in|deed motives, but &s;uch as can be extended to none but to tho&s;e powers that are &s;o qualified.</P>
<P>Third. He &s;peaks of lawful powers indefinitely in the plural number, not &s;pecifying any kind or degree of them, as if only kings and emperors were here meant. It cannot be proved that the power of the &s;word is only in them, neither was there, at that time, at Rome a plurality of kings and emperors to be &s;ub|ject to. It is clear to me, that if he had meant the Roman em|peror, he would have de&s;igned him in the &s;ingular number; for all the rea&s;ons of the text agree to inferior judges. Al&s;o, for they are ordained of God; they are called rulers in &s;cripture, and God's mini&s;ters, revengers by office, who judge not for man but for the Lord. And inferior magi&s;trates al&s;o are not to be re&s;i&s;ted when doing their duty, 1 Peter, ii. 13. Yet all will al|low, when they go beyond their bounds, and turn little tyrants, they may be with&s;tood.</P>
<P>Fourth. He does not &s;peak of Nero, concerning whom it cannot be proved, that at this time he had the &s;overeign power, at the famous and learned Mr. Prin &s;hews; or if he had, that he was a tyrant at this time; and if he meant him at all, it was only as he was obliged to be by right, not as he was indeed: all men know, and none condemns the fact of the &s;enate hat re&s;i&s;t|ed N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">o at length, without tran&s;gre&s;hing this precept. Yea, I &s;hould rather think the &s;enate is the power that the apo&s;tle ap|plies this text to, if he appled it to any in particular.</P>
<P>Fifth. The &s;ubjection here required is the &s;ame with the ho|nour in the fifth command, where of this is an expo&s;ition, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ppo&s;tle to he contra ordinatene&s;s here condemned. Now &s;ub|jection takes in all the duties we owe to magi&s;trates, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all the contraries forbidden; but unlimited obedience
<PB N="11" REF="017905_0006_0FA37A4D044B5D80">
is not here required, &s;o neither unlimited &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>Third. I do allow pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjection, in &s;ome ca&s;es, even to tyrants, when the Lord lays on that yoke; and, in effect, &s;ays he will have us lie under it awhile, as he of old commanded the Jews to be &s;ubject to Nebuchadnezzar. Of which pa&s;&s;age, adduced to prove &s;ubjection to tyrants univer&s;ally, Buchanan as above infers, that if all tyrants are to be &s;ubjected to becau&s;e God by his prophet commanded his people to be &s;ubject to one tyrant, then it mu&s;t be likewi&s;e concluded that all tyrants ought to be killed, becau&s;e Ahab's hou&s;e was commanded to be de&s;troyed by Jehu. But pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjection, when people are not in a capacity to re&s;i&s;t, is nece&s;&s;ary; but I do not &s;ay pa&s;&s;ive obedience, which is a mere chimera, invented in the brains of &s;uch &s;ycophants and jack a&s;&s;es as would make the world &s;laves to tyrants. Who&s;oever &s;uffereth, if he can &s;hun it, is an enemy to his own being, and is a fir&s;t cou&s;in to a &s;elf-murderer; for every natural thing mu&s;t &s;trive to pre&s;erve it&s;elf again&s;t what annoyeth it; and al&s;o, he &s;ins again&s;t the order of God who, in vain, hath ordained &s;o many lawful means for the pre&s;ervation of our being, if we &s;uffer it to be de|&s;troyed, having power to help it.</P>
<P>Fourth. I do abhor all war of &s;ubjects, profe&s;&s;edly declared again&s;t a lawful king, who governs and rules according to law; as al&s;o all war again&s;t lawful authority, founded upon, or de&s;ign|ed for maintaining princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ples incon&s;i&s;tent with government, or again&s;t policy and piety; yea all war without authority; yet when all authority of magi&s;trates &s;upreme and &s;ubordinate is per|ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed and abu&s;ed, contrary to the ends thereof, to the oppre&s;&s;|ing of the people and overturning their laws and liberties, people mu&s;t not in &s;uch ca&s;es, which was exactly ours, &s;u&s;pend or delay their re&s;i&s;tance, waiting for the concurrence of men of authority, and neglect the duty in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, becau&s;e they have not m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n of authority to lead them; for if the ground be lawful, the call clear, the nece&s;&s;ity cogent, the capacity p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, they that have the law of nature, the law of God, and the fundamental laws of the land on their &s;ide, cannot want authority, although they may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a king to lead them. Al&s;o, it is proper h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e to ob&s;erve that people have this privilege of nature to de|&s;ent them&s;elves, and their rights and liberties, as well as kings; and had it before they erected and con&s;tituted kings; for I affirm, that there is no di&s;tinction of quality in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of nature, though there be in civil order; but &s;elf defence is not an act of civil order, in &s;uch intere&s;t people mu&s;t not depend upon the priority of their &s;uperiors, nor &s;u&s;pend the duties they owe to
<PB N="12" REF="017905_0007_0FA37A4DC5463840">
them&s;elves and their neighbours, upon the manuduction of other mens greatne&s;s the law of nature allowing &s;elf defence, and the defence of our brethren, again&s;t all unju&s;t violence, which fully ju&s;tifies the conduct of the different &s;tates appearing in and flying to arms in defence of our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and injured brethren of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay &s;tate, in the year 1775, when Britain laid her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hand of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion upon them. It is a great and incumbent duty on all people to defend their religion and liberties, and tho&s;e of their countrymen, again&s;t king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> who &s;hall attempt to de&s;troy the rights and liberties of the &s;ubjects for all the power of a king or ruler is &s;urely cumu|lative, not privative, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or&s;e condition of a ruler ought not to be by producing. Why then &s;hall the king, betraying his tru&s;t, wrong the cau&s;e of the people who&s;e tru&s;tee be is? Nay if it were not lawful for people to defend their religion, lives, and liberties again&s;t the unju&s;t encroachments of a tyrannical king, then I &s;ay the people would be in a wor&s;e &s;ituation with a king than without him, for they have done it before they had them, and &s;o had better be without them &s;till. But it is as clear as the &s;un at noon day in the firmament, that it is lawful to re&s;i&s;t kings when they, by their mal admini&s;tration, forfeit their &s;ubjects allegi|ance, as the king of England, by his has &s;urely done. Poor foul, I believe he repents, but it is like poor E&s;au's all too late.</P>
<P>Fifth. I do di&s;allow all war, without real nece&s;&s;ity and great wrongs &s;u&s;tained; and that it ought not to be declared or under|taken upon &s;uppo&s;ed grounds, or pretended cau&s;es; and &s;o the que&s;tion is impertinently &s;tated by the to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, whether or not it be lawful for &s;ubjects, or a party of them, when they think them|&s;elves injured, or to be in a capacity, to re&s;i&s;t or oppo&s;e the &s;u|preme power of a nation? For the que&s;tion is not if, when they think them&s;elves injured, they may re&s;i&s;t; but when the injuries are real. Neither is it every reality of injuries will ju&s;tify a people's re|&s;i&s;tance; but when their deare&s;t and neare&s;t liberties are invaded, e&s;pecially when &s;uch an inva&s;ion is made as threatens the total &s;ubver&s;ion of them. Nor do I &s;ay that a people, e&s;teeming them&s;elves in a capacity, or their being really in a capacity, doth make re&s;i&s;tance a duty, except all alike they have a call, as well as a capacity, which requires real nece&s;&s;ity, and a right to he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and the things contended for to be real and legal. Rights really and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ally encroached upon their capacity, gives them only a convenience to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bout the duty that is previou&s;ly lawful upon a moral ground. No man need to &s;ay who &s;hall be judge the king or people.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="017905_0007_0FA37A4DC5463840">
For fir&s;t. All who have eyes in their head may, I think, judge whether the &s;un &s;hines or not; and all who have common &s;en&s;e may judge in this ca&s;e; for when it comes to a nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;i&s;tance, it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed that the grievances complained of, and &s;ought to be redre&s;&s;ed by arms, are not hid, but mani|fe&s;t. Now it cannot be &s;o with a people only pretending their &s;uffering wrong. As to the grievances of the good people of America, it is &s;o manife&s;t to the world, that &s;ome of the nati|ons thereof have e&s;pou&s;ed our righteous cau&s;e, and the re&s;t &s;eems to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Second. There is no need of the formality of a judge in things evident to nature's eye, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s gra&s;s is not tyranny. Un|dermining and overturning religion and liberty, mu&s;t be na|ture in the acts of nece&s;&s;itated re&s;i&s;tance. In &s;uch a ca&s;e is judge, party, accu&s;er, witne&s;s, and all. Neither is it an act of judgment for people to defend their own. Defence is no act of juri&s;diction, but a privilege of nature. Hence ari&s;es the&s;e common &s;ayings, all laws permits force to be repelled by force; and the great and fir&s;t law of nature allows &s;elf|defence. I &s;ay, that the defence of life is nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;lows from the law of nature.</P>
<P>Third. Be judge who will, the tyrant cannot be judge in the ca&s;e; for in tho&s;e tyrannical acts that forces people to re|&s;i&s;tance, he cannot be acknowledged as king, and of cour&s;e no judge; for it is always &s;uppo&s;ed that the judge is ab&s;ent when he is the party that does the wrong; as &s;uch, is inferior to the innocent.</P>
<P>Fourth and la&s;tly. Let God be judge, and all the world take cognizance of the ju&s;tne&s;s of our cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Sixth. I condemn all ri&s;ing to revenge private injuries, whereby a country may be covered with blood, for &s;ome pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ty wrongs done to &s;ome per&s;ons great of &s;mall. I al&s;o abhor all revengeful u&s;urping of the magi&s;trates &s;word, to avenge our|&s;elves for per&s;onal injuries, as David's ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing of Saul would have been. I Sam. xxiv. 10, 12, 13. Ibid xxvi. 9, 10. To object this, in this ca&s;e, were very impertinent; for it would have been an act of offence, in a remote defence, if Saul had been immediately a&s;&s;aulting of him, it could&punc; by no means, be deemed to have been lawful; and it would have been an act of private revenge, for a per&s;onal injury, and a &s;inful prevent|ing of God's promi&s;e of David's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by a &s;candalous a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; but it is clear then, David was re&s;i&s;ting him and that is enough for my argument; and he &s;uppo&s;es he might

de&s;cend into battle and peri&s;h. I Sam. xxvi. 10. Not ex|cluding but that he might peri&s;h in battle again&s;t him&s;elf re|&s;i&s;ting. I do allow, indeed, that we are commanded, in &s;crip|ture, not to re&s;i&s;t evil, but who&s;oever &s;hall &s;mite us on the one cheek, to turn to him the other al&s;o. Mat v 39. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o recompence to no man evil for evil. Rom. xii. 17. But this doth not condemn &s;elf defence, and re&s;i&s;ting of tyrants, vio|lently endangering our lives, laws, religion, and liberties; but only re&s;i&s;tance by way of private revenge and retaliation; and enjoins patience, when the clear call and di&s;pen&s;ation do inevitably call unto &s;uffering, but not to give way to all vio|lence, to the &s;ubverting of religion and liberty. The&s;e texts do no more condemn private per&s;ons retaliating the magi&s;trates than magi&s;trates retaliating private per&s;ons; unle&s;s magi|&s;trates be exempted from this precept, and con&s;equently be not among Chri&s;t's followers; yea, they do no more forbid private per&s;ons to re&s;i&s;t the unju&s;t violence of a king than to re&s;i&s;t the unju&s;t violence of any private per&s;on. That objec|tion from our Lord's reproving Peter. Matt. xxvi. 3, 2. Put up thy &s;word for all they that take the &s;word &s;hall peri&s;h by the &s;word. Hath no weight here, for this condemns only mak|ing u&s;e of the &s;word either by way of private revenge, or u&s;urping the u&s;e of it without authority, and &s;o condemns all tyrants, which private &s;ubjects do not want to defend them|&s;elves, their religion, and liberty, or u&s;ing it without nece&s;&s;ity, which was not Peter's ca&s;e, both becau&s;e Chri&s;t was able to defend him&s;elf, and beca&s;e he was willing to deliver up him|&s;elf. <HI>Pools &s;ynops critic in l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cum.</HI> Chri&s;t could ea&s;ily have de|fended him&s;elf, but he would not, and, therefore, in cour&s;e there was not the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity for Peter's ra&s;hne&s;s. It con|demns, al&s;o, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;h precipitating, and preventing the call of God, to acts of re&s;i&s;tance. But otherwi&s;e it is plain it was not Peter's fault to defend his ma&s;ter, but a nece&s;&s;ary duty. The rea&s;on our ble&s;&s;ed Lord gives for that inhibition at that time was twofold, one expre&s;&s;ed Matt. xxvi. 52. For they that take the &s;word. &amp;c. Which do not belong to Peter, as if he was hereby threatened, but to tho&s;e that were coming to take Chri&s;t. They it were that, indeed, u&s;urped the &s;word of tyran|nical violence, and therefore are threatened with de&s;truction by the bloody &s;word of the Romans. So is that commination to be under&s;tood of anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;t and the tyrants that &s;erve him Rev. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. 10.

and tyrants. The rea&s;on is, John xviii. 11. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which my father hath given me &s;hall I not drink. Which clearly repels that objection of Chri&s;t's non-re&s;i&s;tance. To which it is an&s;wered, that &s;uffering was the end of his volun|tary &s;u&s;cepted humiliation, and his grand errand to the world, appointed by the father, and freely undertaken by him&s;elf, which is not the rule of our practice; though it be true that, even in his &s;uffering, he left us an example, that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps. 1 Pet. ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">1.

<P>Seven. I do al&s;o di&s;claim all ri&s;ing in arms for trifles of our own things, or &s;mall injuries done to our&s;elves, but in a ca&s;e of pure nece&s;&s;ity, for the pre&s;ervation of our lives, religion, laws, and liberties, when all that is dear to us as men and chri&s;tians, are in hazard. So I am not for ri&s;ing in arms to force any people to be of any particular religion, but to de|fend my own, and my country's religion and liberties, from unju&s;t force and violence, again&s;t kings and tyrants, that may encroach thereon. I do not believe that it is the way that Chri&s;t hath appointed to propa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate religion by arms. Let per&s;ecutors and lambs of antichri&s;t take that to them. But I am convinced that it is a privilege that Chri&s;t hath allowed to mankind, to defend and pre&s;erve their religion and liberties by arms, e&s;pecially when they have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;olemn charters, and the laws and con&s;titution of the land, and there|by become a land right, and the deare&s;t and mo&s;t precious of all rights and intere&s;t we have to contend for.

But the good confe&s;&s;ion he witne&s;&s;es here before Pilate, is, that he hath a kingdom which, as it is not in oppo&s;ition to any Ce&s;arean maje&s;ty, mu&s;t not be u&s;urped by any king of clay; but is &s;pecially di&s;tinct from all the kingdoms of the world, and &s;ubordinate to no earthly power, being of a &s;piritual nature, whereof this is a demon&s;tration, and &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for earthly kingdoms, that his &s;ervants, as &s;uch, that is as chri&s;tians and as mini&s;ters, were not appointed by him to pro|pagate it by arms, not to deliver him their king, at that time, becau&s;e he would not &s;uffer his glorious de&s;ign of redemption to be any longer retarded. But this doth not &s;ay that though they are not to propagate it as chri&s;tians and as mini&s;ters, by carnal weapons, yet they may pre&s;erve it with &s;uch weapons as men. Hence that old &s;aying may be vindicated, prayers and tears are the arms of the church. I grant they are &s;o, the only be&s;t prevailing arms, and without which all others would be ineffectual, and that they, together with preaching and church di&s;cipline, are the only ecc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;ia&s;tical or &s;piritual arms of a church as a church; but the members thereof are al&s;o men, and as men they may u&s;e the &s;ame weapons as others do. And ye my flock, the flock of my pa&s;ture, are men, faith the Lord. Ezek xxxiii 31. And from this I &s;hall take an argu|ment, that if it be lawful for private &s;ubjects to re&s;i&s;t a tyrant by prayers and tears, than it is lawful al&s;o to re&s;i&s;t them by vio|lence; but the former is true, therefore the latter. This per|&s;onal re&s;i&s;tance by violence is as con&s;i&s;tent with that command, Rom. xiii. 1, 2. Let every &s;oul be &s;ubject unto the higher pow|ers. Who&s;oever, therefore, re&s;i&s;teth the power, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God; as re&s;i&s;tance by prayer is with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Tim. ii. 1, 2. I exhort that &s;upplication be made for kings and for all that are in authority. If the king be good, the one re&s;i&s;tance is as unlawful as the other; and is a &s;inful re&s;i&s;tance of the ordi|nance of God, to pray again&s;t him no le&s;s than the other to fight again&s;t him. Therefore, when a king turns a tyrant, and a de&s;troyer of the religion and liberties of the people, I may not pray for him, except conditionally, but again&s;t him as an enemy, &s;o I may al&s;o fight again&s;t him. As &s;uch the tyrant of Britain, I mean George the III, and his burning bloo|dy emi&s;&s;aries, who do, at lea&s;t, by their actions, acknow|ledge that the re&s;i&s;tance made again&s;t them, by the prayers and tears of the faithful, is more powerful and effectual than that made by arms.

God. What has become of one or two near Springfield, in the &s;tate of New-Jer&s;ey, when they murdered the mini&s;ter's wife there? How have they de&s;troyed two at Somer&s;et, in &s;aid &s;tate? Al&s;o, at Crumpond, and Bedford in the &s;tate of New-York? And no doubt many more that at pre&s;ent does not occur to my mind. And farther, the law u&s;ed to make the one re&s;i&s;tance as trea&s;onable as the other, and that very de&s;ervedly too, when the king was doing his duty. But when he turns tyrant, nei|ther of tho&s;e methods of re&s;i&s;tance can ju&s;tly be condemned.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being admitted, I &s;hall now come to the thing in hand, and endeavour to prove this truth, that it is a nece&s;|&s;ary duty for a people to endeavour, in the defence of their re|ligion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ves, laws and liberties; to re&s;i&s;t and repr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s the tyran|ny of a king, u&s;ing and abu&s;ing his power for &s;ubverting religion, invading the liberties, and overturning the fundamental laws of the country. I propo&s;e to be as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e I think this truth in&s;ufficiently confirmed already, to convince any but the&s;e who are determined not to be convinced; yet I propo&s;e to hint at &s;ome others, and pro&s;ecute them in the following order. Fir&s;t, I &s;hall produce &s;ome arguments from the law of nature and nations. Secondly, From the common practices of all chri&s;tian people. Thirdly, From expre&s;s &s;criptures.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The arguments of the fir&s;t cla&s;s are very multifarious. I &s;hall endeavour to reduce them to a few as compendiou&s;ly as may be, and only give the &s;trength of them in a &s;yllogi&s;tical form, without expatiating, &s;ave where the matter requires.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The great antagoni&s;ts of this truth, through the clear|ne&s;s thereof, are forced to a&s;&s;ert and grant &s;uch particulars as will, by con&s;equence, ju&s;tify this plea.

The Surveyor of Naphtali grants the &s;ame. P. 23. 24. Yea, this has been granted in many of the councils and open courts of chri&s;tian nations, that in ca&s;e of the king's alienating his kingdom, he may be re&s;i&s;ted; which will fully ju&s;tify the Ame|rican re&s;i&s;tance; for &s;urely Britain, by her conduct, was about to &s;ell or de&s;troy her liberties and property; and has effectually e&s;tranged and drawn off our affections from her, even to the world's wonder. I need &s;ay no more than this, that a king's

carrying a ho&s;tile mind, to the de&s;truction of his people and kingdom, does give the people a right to re&s;i&s;t him. Doctor Ferne acknowledgeth, <Q>That per&s;onal defence is lawful again&s;t the &s;udden, illegal, and inevitable a&s;&s;aults of the kings me&s;&s;en|gers, or of him&s;elf, &s;o far as to ward off his blows, or hold his hands; as al&s;o he alloweth private per&s;ons liberty to deny &s;ub&s;idies and tribute to the prince, when he employeth it to the de&s;truction of the commonwealth.</Q> From hence I argue, if one may defend him&s;elf again&s;t the &s;udden, illegal and inevita|ble a&s;&s;aults of the king or his me&s;&s;enger&punc; then may many men, in defence of their lives and liberties, defend them&s;elves again&s;t the &s;urprizing ma&s;&s;acre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and &s;udden a&s;&s;aults of the king of Eng|land and his bloody emi&s;&s;aries, which were all illegal; but the former is true, therefore the latter.</P>

If a woman may defend her cha&s;tity again&s;t the king, le&s;t her non-re&s;i&s;tance make her guilty, then may a nation, or any part of it, re&s;i&s;t a king's attempt upon their religion and liberties, enticing them to fornication, le&s;t their non re&s;i&s;tance make them guilty; but the former is true&punc; therefore the latter.</P>

not illegitimate, and unto which re&s;i&s;tance is forbidden, for the fear of God and for con&s;cience &s;ake; and therefore he is no further to be looked at than as an enemy</Q></P>
<P>Sixth. <HI>Grotious de jure belli</HI> lib i. cap. 4. Granteth, <Q>the law of not re&s;i&s;ting does not bind, when the danger is mo&s;t weighty and certain;</Q> and I do not plead for it in any other ca&s;e. And further, he faith, <Q>the law of non-re&s;i&s;tance &s;eemeth to have flowed from them who fir&s;t combined together into &s;o|ciety, and from whom &s;uch as did command, did derive their power. Now if it had been a&s;ked of &s;uch whether they would cho&s;e to die, rather than in any ca&s;e to re&s;i&s;t the &s;uperior with arms, I know not if they would have yielded thereto, unle&s;s with this addition, if they could not be re&s;i&s;ted but with the greate&s;t perturbation of the common wealth, and de&s;truction of many innocents. And afterwards he hath the words, Never|thele&s;s I &s;carce dare condemn every one, or the le&s;&s;er part, which may only be done, at utmo&s;t extremity; notwith&s;tand|ing re&s;pect is to be had to the common good</Q> From all which I need not make the lea&s;t inference, the conce&s;&s;ion is &s;o large, that it does to all intents and purpo&s;es confirm my arguments.</P>
<P>Seventh. The &s;urveyor of Naphtali, in the place above cited, <Q>grants legal &s;elf-defence, again&s;t the &s;overeign, by way of plea in court, for &s;afety of a man's per&s;on or e&s;tate; as al&s;o is the ca&s;e of mo&s;t habited not our and compleat tyranny, again&s;t law to the de&s;truction of the body of a people; and of all known legal liberties, and the being of religion, according to law, and in ca&s;e of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not being in his right wits.</Q></P>
<P>Hence I argue, that if it be lawful to re&s;i&s;t the king by a plea in law, for an e&s;tate, yea the law will allow, by actual force if he come to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it illegally; then it mu&s;t be law|for their lives and e&s;tates, liberties and religion, to re&s;i&s;t him by force, when the legal re&s;i&s;tance is not admitted; but the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rmer is true therefore the latter. The rea&s;on of the connexion is, the municipal law permits the one, and the law of na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> and nations, which no municipal law can infringe, will warrant the other. He hath no more right to be both judge and party in this ca&s;e, than in the other. Second. If it be lawful to re&s;i&s;t tyranny a|gain&s;t law, to the de&s;truction of the rights of the people, their re|ligion and liberties, then I want no more to prove the lawfulne&s;s of the American re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the tyranny of Britain, exerci|&s;ed for years pa&s;t again&s;t us, which has proven the de&s;olation and ruin of many hundreds of families, be&s;ides all the rivers of blood that have been drawn from the veins of our dear country men;
<PB N="20" REF="017905_0011_0FA37A50C24F3F60">
and all this perpetrated for the profe&s;t purpo&s;e of &s;ubverting our religion and liberties, and to e&s;tabli&s;h an arbitrary government. And here I think it proper to an&s;wer an objection that &s;ome may make, viz. That I have blended religious liberty with civil, as a cau&s;e of the American re&s;i&s;tance, when the former was not in the lea&s;t invaded by any Briti&s;h act of parliament that was com|plained of; but all freedom left to the con&s;cience in that re&s;pect, and therefore I ought not to have made u&s;e of the word in this piece. In an&s;wer whereof, I offer the following as my rea&s;on for &s;o doing: I do freely acknowledge that I have not &s;een or heard of any Briti&s;h act of parliament that did, in direct terms, and in &s;o many words, declare that the people of America &s;hould all be of one uniform religion, upon pain of death and confi&s;cation of goods; but I have &s;een and read one that carried all that in it's bowels, to wit. The declaratory act, wherein they declare they had a right to bind the Americans in all ca&s;es what&s;oever; which if once they could have put into full execution, what would there be left we could call our own any longer than at the will and plea&s;ure of a tyrannical king and parliament, for there is no ex|ception in the word what&s;oever? Be&s;ides, whoever knew or heard of a people's enjoying their religious liberties when their civil was taken from them? They were born twins, knit together, therefore if-one of them dies, the other cannot live; at lea&s;t this is my opinion, and every one has a right to judge for them&s;elves. Now under the full conviction of this, and that had our civil li|berties been taken from us, our religious ones would not long &s;urvived. I was led to blend them together, and &s;hall through|out this piece.</P>
<P>Third. Suppo&s;e the king &s;hould run mad, and out of his wits, and then &s;hould run upon an innocent man to kill him, or make an attempt to cut his own throat, would it then, and in that ca&s;e, be lawful to re&s;i&s;t him? Yea, it would be a great &s;in not to do it. Then &s;urely, when in a mad rage, he is &s;eeking to de&s;troy many hundred of the good people of America, he may and ought to be re&s;i&s;ted. But the former is true therefore the latter. It is ea&s;ily to be &s;een by the above conce&s;&s;ions of adver&s;aries to my principles, that the ab&s;olute &s;ubjection they talk of will not hold good, nor the prerogative be &s;o uncontroulable in every ca&s;e as they would pretend; and that in many ca&s;es the &s;afety of the people hath the &s;upremacy above it, and that al&s;o in the&s;e ca&s;es the people mu&s;t be judges whether they may re&s;i&s;t or not.</P>
<P>Second. From the law of nature I may argue. Fir&s;t. If God the fountain of all power, and author of all right, hath gi|ven
<PB N="21" REF="017905_0011_0FA37A50C24F3F60">
unto man both the power, and the right of, and rea&s;on to manage &s;elf-defence, and hath no ways interdicted it in his word, to be put forth again&s;t tyrants, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n it is duty to u&s;e it again&s;t him upon occa&s;ion; but the former is true, therefore the latter. Second. If this power and right were re&s;trained in man again&s;t the unju&s;t violence of any, it would either be by policy or grace, or &s;ome expre&s;s prohibition in the word of God; but none of the&s;e can be &s;aid, therefore policy cannot de&s;troy nature, but is rather cumulative to it. A man entering into a politic incorpo|ration, does not lo&s;e the privilege of nature. If one particular nature may defend it&s;elf again&s;t de&s;troying violence out of &s;ocie|ty, then mu&s;t many of the&s;e natures, combined in &s;ociety have the &s;ame right; and &s;o much the more that their relative duties &s;uperadd an obligation of mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Grace does not re|&s;train the right of &s;inle&s;s nature, though it re&s;trains corruption. But &s;elf-defence is no corruption. Grace makes a man more a man than he was, and nothing can be more di&s;honourable to the go&s;pel than that, by the law of nature, it is lawful to re&s;i&s;t ty|rants. But we are bound by religion from with&s;tanding their cruelty. The laws of God do not interfere one with an|other. Third. That law which alloweth comparative <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re of|fending, &s;o as to kill rather than be killed, teache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;i&s;tance. But &s;o the law of nature alloweth, except we be guilty of mur|der, in the culpable omi&s;&s;ion of &s;elf defence. The rea&s;on is be|cau&s;e the love of &s;elf is nearer and greater, as to temporal life, than the love of our neighbour; that being the mea&s;ure of this, therefore it obliges rather to kill than be killed, the exigence of nece&s;&s;ity &s;o requiring. Fourth. If nature put no other differ|ence between the violence of a tyrant than of another man, then it teaches to re&s;i&s;t both alike; but it putte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h no difference, but rather aggravates that of a tyrant, being the violence of a man, the inju&s;tice of a member of the common wealth, and the cruelty of a tyrant; and it is mo&s;t ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that we might defend our&s;elves from the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er violence, and not from the greater. Fifth. If particular nature mu&s;t yield to the good of univer&s;al nature, then mu&s;t one man, though in greate&s;t power, be re&s;i&s;ted rather than the univer&s;al common wealth &s;uffer hurt. But the former is true therefore the latter; for that dictates the nece&s;&s;ity of the di&s;tracted father to be bound by his own &s;ons, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t all the family be hurt; therefore the greate&s;t of men, or kings, when de&s;tructive to the common wealth, mu&s;t be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is but one man, and &s;o but particular nature&punc; Sixth&punc; That which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and reflects upon p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, as putting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in a

wor&s;e condition than brutes, is ab&s;urd and contrary to the law of nature; but to &s;ay that the brutes have power to defend them|&s;elves, by re&s;i&s;ting what annoys them, and deny this power to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aen, is irrational, and reflects upon providence as putting men in a wor&s;e condition than brutes; therefore it is ab&s;urd and con|trary to the law of nature.</P>
<P>Third. From the in&s;titution of government, I may argue thus, that power and government, which is not of God, may be re&s;i&s;ted. The tyrant's power and government in breaking char|ters, overturning laws, &s;ubverting religion, oppre&s;&s;ing &s;ubjects, is not of God, therefore it may be re&s;i&s;ted. This is clear, be|cau&s;e that is only the rea&s;on why he is not to be re&s;i&s;ted, becau&s;e the ordinance of God is not to be re&s;i&s;ted. Rom. xiii. 2. But they re&s;i&s;ting a man, de&s;troying all the intere&s;ts of mankind, do not in this re&s;i&s;t the ordinance of God. And if it were not &s;o, this would tend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">remedable&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly to overthrow all po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cs, and open a gap to all di&s;order. Inju&s;tice and cruelty would give as great encouragement to tyrants to do what they li&s;t, as thieves would be encouraged, if they knew that nobody would re&s;i&s;t them, or b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing them to puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Fourth. From the original con&s;titution of government by men, it may be argued thus, if people, at the fir&s;t erection of go|vernment, acted rationally and did not put them&s;elves in a wor&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e than before, wherein it was lawful to defend them&s;elves a|gain&s;t all injuries, but devolved their rights upon the fiduciary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">utory of &s;uch as &s;hould remain &s;till in the rank of men, that can do wrong, who had no power but by their gift, con&s;ent, and choice, with whom they a&s;&s;ociated, not to their detriment, but for their advantage; and determined the form of their govern|ment, and time of its continuance, and in what ca&s;es they might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cur to their primeval liberty and &s;ettled a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to have cour&s;e, not by hereditary right, but by right and force of law for good ends; then they did not give away their birth right of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lf defence and power of re&s;i&s;tance, which they had before to with&s;tand the violence&punc; injuries, and oppre&s;&s;ions of men they &s;et over them, when they pervert the form, and convert it to tyran|ny; but did re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ain a power and privilege <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;i&s;t and revolt from them, and repel their violence when they &s;hould do violence to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;titution, and pervert the ends thereof. But the former <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> true, ergo, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">exion is confirmed from this. If the e|&s;tates of a kingdom give the power to a king, it is their own power in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and if they give it for their own good, they have power to judge when it is u&s;ed again&s;t them&s;elves and
<PB N="23" REF="017905_0012_0FA37A5183E7D120">
for their evil; and &s;o power to limit and to re&s;i&s;t the power that they gave.</P>
<P>Fifth. From the way and manner of erecting governors, by compact, the nece&s;&s;ity whereof is clear, many arguments might be deduced. I &s;hall reduce them to this form, if people mu&s;t propo&s;e conditions unto kings to be by them acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in, and &s;ubmitted unto, at their admi&s;&s;ion to the government, which thereupon becomes the fundamental laws of the government, and &s;ecurity for the peoples rights and liberties, giving a law claim to the people to pur&s;ue the king, in ca&s;e of fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing in the main and principle thing covenanted, as their own covenanted manda|tarius, who hath no right or authority of his own, but what he hath from them, and no more power but what is contained in the conditions upon which he undertaketh the government. Then whenever a tyrant doth break all the&s;e conditions, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nce accepted, and &s;o become, in &s;trict law, no king and the people be, in &s;trict law, liberated from &s;ubjection to him, they may and mu&s;t defend them&s;elves, and their fundamental rights and privi|leges, religion and laws, and re&s;i&s;t the tyranny overturning them. But the former is true, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sixth. From the nature of magi&s;tracy, it may be argued thus: That power which is properly neither parental nor merital, nor ma&s;terly and de&s;potick over the &s;ubjects and goods&punc; but only fi|duciary, and by way of tru&s;t, is more to be re&s;i&s;ted than that which is properly &s;o. But that power which is properly &s;o, that is parental power and marital and ma&s;terly, may be re&s;i&s;ted in many ca&s;es Therefore that power which is not &s;o properly, but only fiduciary, is more to be re&s;i&s;ted than a king's power o|ver his &s;ubjects, is neither parental nor marital, &amp;c. is mo&s;t clear. The minor is clear, by in&s;tances. Fir&s;t. If children may in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, re&s;i&s;t the fury and mad rage of their father, &s;eeking to de&s;troy them, then mu&s;t private &s;ubjects re&s;i&s;t the rage and tyranny of kings, &s;eeking to de&s;troy them, and what is dear|e&s;t to them; for there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> no &s;tricter obligation moral between king and people, than between parents and children, nor &s;o &s;trict; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> tyrants and people there is none at all, therefore the former ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> be denied. Second. If wives may lawfully de|fend them&s;elves again&s;t the unju&s;t violence of enraged hu&s;bands, then m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubjec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s have power to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the furious a&s;&s;aults of enraged tyran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, for there is not &s;o great a tie betwixt them and people&punc; as be w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n man and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e; yea there is none at all; but the former i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> true. Ergo, Three. If &s;ervants may defend them&s;elves again&s;t their ma&s;ters, then m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t private &s;ubjects again&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="017905_0013_0FA37A52430B0998">
a tyrant or his emi&s;&s;aries; but the former is true. Ergo, Four. If the king's power is only fiduciary, and by way of pawn, which he hath got to keep, then when that power is manife&s;tly abu&s;ed, to the hurt of them that entru&s;ted him with it, he ought, by all means, to be re&s;i&s;ted by all tho&s;e which he undertook to protect; but the former is true, therefore the latter.</P>
<P>Seventh. From the limited power of kings it may be thus argued: If kings be limited by laws and contracts, and may be re&s;i&s;ted by pleas in law, and have no ab&s;olute power to do and command what they will&punc; but mu&s;t be limited both by the laws of God and man, and cannot make what laws they will, in prejudice of the people's rights, nor execute the laws made according to their plea&s;ure&punc; nor confer on others a lawle&s;s licen&s;e to oppre&s;s whom they plea&s;e; then when they turn tyrants&punc; and arrogate a lawle&s;s ab&s;olutene&s;s, and cro&s;s the rules and tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds pre&s;cribed by God's laws and man's laws, and made their own lu&s;ts a law, and execute the &s;ame arbitrarily, they mu&s;t be re&s;i&s;t|ed by force when a legal re&s;i&s;tance cannot be had, in defence of religion and liberty. But all kings are limited, &amp;c and the con|nexion may be thus confirmed in &s;hort: That power which is not the ordinance of God, may be re&s;i&s;ted; but an ab&s;olute illi|mited power cro&s;&s;ing the rules and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the bounds pre|&s;cribed by God's law and man's, is not the ordinance of God, therefore it may be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Eighth. Further from the rules of government it may be ar|gued &s;everal ways. Fir&s;t. That power which is contrary to law, evil and tyrannical, can tie none to &s;ubjection; but if it oblige to any thing, it ties to re&s;i&s;tance. But the power of a king again&s;t law, religion, and liberty, is a power contrary to law, evil and tyrannical, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The major is plain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or wickedne&s;s can tie no man but to re&s;i&s;t it. That power which is contrary to law, evil and tyrannical is wickedne&s;s. Second. That power and tho&s;e acts, which neither king can exerci&s;e nor command, nor others execute, nor any o|bey&punc; mu&s;t certainly be re&s;i&s;ted; but &s;uch is the power and acts that oppre&s;s the &s;ubjects, and overturn religion and liberty, there|fore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The minor is evident from &s;cripture, condemning oppre&s;&s;ion and violence, both in them that command and in them that ex|ecute the &s;ame&punc; and al&s;o them that obey &s;uch wicked commands. The major is very clear from rea&s;on, both becau&s;e &s;uch power and &s;uch acts as cannot be commanded cannot be executed, can|not be obeyed lawfully, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ful and wicked; and becau&s;e it
<PB N="25" REF="017905_0013_0FA37A52430B0998">
cannot be a magi&s;tratical power, for that may always be exerci&s;|ed and executed lawfully; and what a man cannot command, the re&s;i&s;ting of that he cannot puni&s;h; but acts of oppre&s;&s;ion a|gain&s;t law, religion, and liberty, a man cannot command, ergo the re&s;i&s;ting of the&s;e he cannot puni&s;h. Third. That govern|ment and admini&s;tration which is not &s;ubordinate to the law and will of God, who hath appointed it, mu&s;t be re&s;i&s;ted. But that government, or admini&s;tration, which under mines or overturns religion and liberty, is not &s;ubordinate to the law and will of God, therefore, &amp;c. The major is clear, for nothing but what is the ordinance of God, &s;ubordinate to his law and will, is irre&s;i&s;t|able. Rom. xiii. 2. The a&s;&s;umption is undeniable.</P>
<P>Ninth. From the very end and true de&s;ign of government, which mu&s;t be acknowleged by all to be the glory of God and the good of mankind; yea all that have been either wi&s;e or ho|ne&s;t have always held that the &s;afety of the people is the &s;upreme law. The argument may run thus in &s;hort. Fir&s;t. That doc|trine which makes the holy one to cro&s;s his own ends, in giving governors, mu&s;t be ab&s;urd and unchri&s;tian, as well as irrational; but &s;uch is the doctrine that makes all kings, and tyrants irre&s;i&s;t|able upon any pretence whatever; which, by the bye, is the an|cient and modern to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y doctrine, ergo the the minor. I prove that doctrine which makes God, intending his own glory, and the peo|ples good, to give governors both as fathers to pre&s;erve and as mur|derers to de&s;troy them, mu&s;t make the holy one to cro&s;s his own ends, for the&s;e are contradictory; but the doctrine that makes all kings and tyrants irre&s;i&s;table, &amp;c. is &s;uch, for by office they are fathers to pre&s;erve, and by office al&s;o they mu&s;t be murderers, ve&s;t|ed with &s;uch a power from God by the fir&s;t act. If they be irre&s;i&s;t|able when they do &s;o, &s;eeing every power that is irre&s;i&s;table is the ordinance of God. Hence al&s;o when a ble&s;&s;ing turns a cur&s;e it is no more the ordinance of God, but to be re&s;i&s;ted with all our might and &s;trength; but when a king turns a tyrant, overturning religion and liberty, then a ble&s;&s;ing turns a cur&s;e, therefore&punc; &amp;c.</P>
<P>Second. Means are to be re&s;i&s;ted when they are not u&s;eful for, but de&s;tructive to the ends for which they were appointed; but kings overturning religion and liberty, are means not u&s;eful for, but de&s;tructive to the ends for which they were ap|pointed. Seeing then they are neither for the glory of God nor the good of mankind, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Third. If all powers and prerogatives of men are only means appointed for&punc; and &s;hould vail unto the &s;upreme law of the peoples &s;afety, and all laws be &s;ubordinate to and corroborative
<PB N="26" REF="017905_0014_0FA37A5303AFB5D8">
of this law; and when cro&s;s to it, are in &s;o far null, and no laws; and all law formalities in competion with it are to be laid a&s;ide, and all parliamentary priviledes mu&s;t yield to this, and king and parliament, both con&s;piring, have no power again&s;t it; and no &s;overeign power, by virtue of any re&s;ignation from the people can comprize any authority to act again&s;t it; then it is duty to obey the &s;upreme law, in re&s;i&s;ting all powers and prero|gatives, all laws and law formalities, and all con&s;piracies what|&s;oever again&s;t this &s;upreme law, the &s;afety of the people; but the former is true, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fourth. That power which is obliged and appointed to com|mand and rule ju&s;tly and religiou&s;ly, for the good of the people, and is only &s;et over them on the&s;e conditions, and for that end, cannot tie them to &s;ubjection, without re&s;i&s;tance, when the power is abu&s;ed to the de&s;truction of laws, religion, liberty, and people; but all power is &s;o appointed and obliged, therefore when&s;oever it is &s;o abu&s;ed&punc; it cannot tie people to &s;ubjection, but rather oblige them to the rejection of it.</P>
<P>Tenth. From the obedience required to government it may be argued thus: Fir&s;t. If we may flee from tyrants then we may re&s;i&s;t them; but we may flee from tyrants therefore we may re&s;i&s;t them. The connexion I prove, Fir&s;t. If all grounds of ju&s;tice will warrant the one as well as the other, then, if the one be duty &s;o is the other; but the former is true; for the &s;ame ju&s;tice and equity that warrants declining a tyrants unju&s;t violence by flight, will warrant re&s;i&s;tance when flight will not do it; the &s;ame principle of &s;elf defence that makes flight duty, when re&s;i&s;tance is not po&s;&s;ible, will al&s;o make re&s;i&s;tance duty when flight is not po&s;&s;ible; the &s;ame principle of charity to wives and children, that makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light lawful when, by re&s;i&s;tance, they cannot avoid tyran|ny, will make re&s;i&s;tance duty when by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light they cannot evita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e it; the &s;ame principle of con&s;cience to keep religion free, that prompts to flight when re&s;i&s;tance will not &s;ave it, will al&s;o prompt to re&s;i&s;t it when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light is not practicable. Second. If to flee from a ju&s;t power when, in ju&s;tice we are obnoxious to its &s;word, be to re&s;i&s;t the ordinance of God, and &s;o &s;in, then to flee from an unju&s;t power mu&s;t be al&s;o a re&s;i&s;ting of the abu&s;ing of it, and &s;o duty, for the one is re&s;i&s;tance as well as the other; but the difference of the power re&s;i&s;ted makes the one lawful, the other not. Again, if kingly power may be re&s;i&s;ted, by interpo&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eas, and miles, why not by the &s;ame rule by interpo&s;ing walls and arms? Both is re&s;i&s;tance, for again&s;t a lawful king or magi&s;|trate that would be re&s;i&s;tance. Third. If a tyrant hath irre&s;i&s;table
<PB N="27" REF="017905_0014_0FA37A5303AFB5D8">
power to kill and de&s;troy the people, he hath al&s;o irre&s;i&s;table power to cite and &s;ummon them before him; and if it be unlaw|ful to re&s;i&s;t his murders, it mu&s;t be as unlawful to re&s;i&s;t his &s;um|mons. Fourth. For a community of people to flee with wives and children, &s;trong and weak, young and old, to e&s;cape tyrannical violence, and leave the land, were more unlawful than to re&s;i&s;t, Alas! where &s;hould or could we of America have fled to have e&s;caped the power of tyranny? Therefore it was ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> duty to re&s;i&s;t, for what is not po&s;&s;ible as a natural means of pre&s;er|vation, is not a lawful mean; but this was not a po&s;&s;ible mean, neither is it warranted in nature's law, or God's word&punc; for a peo|ple that have God's right, and man's law, to the land, and the rights and liberties thereof, to leave the country and its liberties all into the hands of a tyrant, and his crew. And farther, if it is duty to di&s;obey, 'tis al&s;o duty to re&s;i&s;t tyrants in defence of re|ligion and liberty. But it is duty to di&s;obey them, therefore, &amp;c. The connection only will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ck at, which is thus &s;trengthened, if &s;ubjection be no more pre&s;&s;ed in &s;cripture than obedience. Then, if non obedience be duty, non &s;ubjection mu&s;t be &s;o al&s;o, and con&s;equently re&s;i&s;tance; but &s;ubjection is no more pre&s;&s;ed in &s;cripture than obedience, for all commands of &s;ubjection, to the higher powers as God's mini&s;ters, under pain of damnation, do only re&s;pect lawful magi&s;trates, and in lawful things, and do include obedience; and non-obedience to the power &s;o qualified is a re&s;i&s;ting of the ordinance of God, as well as non &s;ubjection. If then obedience to magi&s;trates be duty, and non-obedience &s;in, and obedience to tyrants &s;in, and non obe|dience duty, then, by parity of rea&s;on, &s;ubjection to magi&s;trates is duty, and non-&s;ubjection is &s;in; and al&s;o &s;ubjection to tyrants is &s;in&punc; and non &s;ubjection duty.</P>
<P>Eleventh. From the re&s;i&s;tance allowed in all governments, it may be argued thus:&mdash;If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be duty to defend our religion, lives and liberties, again&s;t an invading army of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut throats, Turks, Tar|tars, &amp;c. without or again&s;t the king's warrant, then of cour&s;e, it is and mu&s;t be duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o defend the &s;ame again&s;t home b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed ty|rants, except we would &s;ub&s;cribe our&s;elves home born &s;laves; but the former is true, therefore, &amp;c. The minor cannot be doubt|ed, becau&s;e the king's power cannot be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ative and de&s;tructive to defence of our religion, lives, and liberties; nor neither can it take away nature's birth right, to defend th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e or make it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e the wor&s;e than if we had no king at all. Now if we had no king at all, we might defend the&s;e again&s;t invaders; and whether we have king's or not, we are under moral obligations of the law of
<PB N="28" REF="017905_0015_0FA37A53C3AAC820">
God to endeavour the defence of the&s;e. But this need not be in&s;i&s;ted on; the connexion of the propo&s;ition is clear, if king's be more tyrannical, in invading religion and liberty them&s;elves, than in &s;uffering others to do it, or hindering them to be oppo&s;|ed; and if their inva&s;ion be more tyrannical, hurtful, and dan|gerous, than the inva&s;ion of &s;trangers, then, if it be duty to re&s;i&s;t &s;trangers, invading the&s;e intere&s;ts, it is more duty to re&s;i&s;t home bred tyrants invading the &s;ame; but the former is true, there|fore the latter. Re&s;i&s;tance in the one ca&s;e is no more re&s;i&s;ting the ordinance of God than in the other.</P>
<P>Twelfth. From the motives of re&s;i&s;tance we may draw this argument, which might indeed be branched out into &s;everal; but for brevities &s;ake, I propo&s;e to reduce it to this complex one: If when we are in a capacity we cannot acquit our&s;elves in the duty that we do owe to our country&punc; our&s;elves, and po&s;terity, and ab&s;olve our&s;elves from the &s;in and judgment of tyrants, who overturn religion and liberty, oppre&s;s our countrymen, im|po&s;e &s;lavery on our&s;elves, and intail it upon po&s;terity, by a pa&s;|&s;ive &s;ubjection, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, and not oppo&s;ing the&s;e mi&s;chiefs, then this in&s;tance is nece&s;&s;ary; but the former is true, therefore, &amp;c. The connexion is clear, for there cannot be a medium, if we cannot di&s;charge the&s;e duties by &s;ubjection, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and not oppo&s;ing; then, we mu&s;t do them by non &s;ubjection, non &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion&punc; and oppo&s;ing, &s;ince they mu&s;t be done &s;ome way. The a&s;&s;umption is thus confirmed Second. The duties we owe to religion, when it is like to be overturned, which no doubt would have been the ca&s;e had our civil liberties been taken from us, it is, I &s;ay, in this ca&s;e, our duty to re&s;i&s;t tyranny, by making u&s;e of defen&s;ive arms. This mu&s;t &s;urely be as nece&s;&s;ary as that of our civil liberties, which is an intere&s;t of our bodies, which is, indeed far inferior, and as nece&s;&s;ary a duty as to defend our civil liberties from perpetual &s;lavery, and as preferable thereunto as Chri&s;t's intere&s;ts is to man's; and as the true end of all &s;elf pre&s;ervation is to the means of it, the pre&s;ervation of religion being the end of all &s;elf pre&s;ervation. But this duty cannot be di&s;charged without re&s;i&s;tance in a mere pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjection and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, otherwi&s;e the &s;ame might be di&s;charged in our univer&s;al &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Turks or Indians, coming to de&s;troy our religion. Surely this pa&s;&s;ive way of conducting our&s;elves cannot an&s;wer the duty of pleading for truth. I&s;a. ix. 4. Seeking the truth. Jer. v. 1. Being valliant for it. Jer. lix. 3. Making up the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">edge, &s;tanding in the gap, &amp;c. Ezek. xxii. 30. Which yet are really nece&s;&s;ary and incumbent duties according to our capacity;
<PB N="29" REF="017905_0015_0FA37A53C3AAC820">
therefore we cannot an&s;wer the duties we owe to religion, in a mere pa&s;&s;ive way. I &s;ay farther, the duty we owe to our coun|trymen, and to tho&s;e of each &s;tate, is to a&s;&s;i&s;t and defend them, and relieve them when oppre&s;&s;ed, which fully and compleatly ju|&s;tifies the conduct of all tho&s;e brave officers and men who &s;o chear|fully flew from their ploughs to the &s;word, to the relief of our brave, but oppre&s;&s;ed brethren at Bo&s;ton, in the year 1775, as truly we were bound, by all laws of humanity, and of God, to do; and by the royal law of Chri&s;t, the foundation of all righteou&s;ne&s;s among men, towards each other. Matt. vii. 12. All things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them. Reader, never let this direction &s;lip your memory, for &s;urely as we would wi&s;h to have others help us, when we are oppre&s;&s;ed, &s;o &s;hould we do to them when it is in the power of our hands to do it, and not forbear to deliver them, for the Lord will require their blood at our hand. Prov. xxiv, 11, 12 But this cannot, by any means, be done by a mere &s;ubjection without re&s;i&s;tance. Third. There is no way to free our&s;elves of the &s;in and judg|ment of tyrants, by mere pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjection. We find in the &s;acred &s;criptures, how that the people of old have been involved and puni&s;hed for the &s;ins of tyrants, as the people of Judah for Mana&s;&s;eh. 2 Kings xxi. 11. &amp;c. Jer. xv. 4. Who&s;e &s;ins, if they had not been committed, the judgment for them had been prevented&punc; and if the people had hindred them, they had not &s;marted, but being jointly included with their rulers in the &s;ame bond of fidelity to God, and made accountable as joint princi|ples with their kings for that debt, by their mutual as well as &s;e|veral engagements, to walk in his ways, they were liable to be puni&s;hed for their rebellion and apo&s;tacy, becau&s;e they did not hinder it. Hence I &s;ay, re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t tyrants and tyranny is right and lawful, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Secondly. This truth is confirmed from the common prac|tice of the people of God, even under per&s;ecution, from whence I propo&s;e to draw an argument from &s;ome notable examples which, to condemn, were impious, and to deny were mo&s;t impu|dent; and, for forms &s;ake, it may run thus: What the people of God under both te&s;taments have frequently done, in time of per&s;ecution, for defending, vindicating, or recovering their reli|gion and liberties, may and ought to be done again in the like circum&s;tances, when the&s;e are in the like hazard; but under both te&s;taments, the people of God frequently, in times of per&s;ecuti|on, have defended, vindicated, and recovered their religion and liberties by defen&s;ive arms, re&s;i&s;ting the &s;overeign powers that
<PB N="30" REF="017905_0016_0FA37A54823DAB60">
&s;ought to de&s;troy them; therefore this may, and ought to be done again when the&s;e religious, civil and natural privileges are in the like hazard to be de&s;troyed by the violent encroachments of the &s;overeign powers. The propo&s;ition cannot be denied, ex|cept by all &s;uch as are open profe&s;&s;ed enemies to the people of God, as I take all the enemies to their country really to be. And I am ready to believe that, by an impartial and &s;trict <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ernt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y, it will be found that the examples of their endeavoured re&s;i&s;tance will be little inferior, if not &s;uperior, in number and importance to the examples of their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;ufferings in all ages of the world, which will appear in the probation of the a&s;&s;umption by adduction of many in&s;tances which I &s;hall only cur&s;orily glean out of that plentiful harve&s;t that hi&s;tories do afford us, both of ancient and modern date.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. I need only ju&s;t touch on that mo&s;t well known and famous hi&s;tory of the Maccabees, of undoubted verity, though not of cannonical authority, in which, according to &s;cripture pre|dictions, we have a mo&s;t notable account of many heroick enter|pri&s;es, atchievements, and exploits performed by them that knew their God, and tendered his glory and their religion and country's liberties, above the common cate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">k no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">us of uncontroul|able, irre&s;i&s;table royalty and ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">te, implicit, loyalty, that have abu&s;ed the world in all ages. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we have an account of the noble and &s;ucce&s;sful re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ance of a party of a few godly and zeal|ous patriots, without the concurrence of civil authority, or coun|tenance of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> or nobles of the kingdom, again&s;t a king univer&s;ally acknowledged and &s;ubjected unto, that came in pea|ceably and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the kingdom by flatteries, with whom the greate&s;t part&punc; and tho&s;e of the greate&s;t note, took part and did wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> the covenant and nation's intere&s;t, and were corr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters"> by flatteries; yet a few prie&s;ts, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> countrymen, did fly to arms again&s;t him and them, and the Lord did wonderfully a&s;&s;i&s;t them for a con&s;iderable time, as was foretold by Daniel xi. And all this did fall out under the per&s;ecution of Antiochus Epip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anes, and was happily begun by Matthias&punc; a godly prie&s;t and his five &s;ons, who being commanded under &s;evere certifications, to wor&s;hip according to the law then and at that time in force, and according to the king's wicked lu&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.

A great under|taking indeed. And have not we of America great rea&s;on to ble&s;s God, and to &s;tand amazed at the great goodne&s;s and pro|vidence of God, that when the king of Great-Britain, and his venal parliament, was about to de&s;troy our civil, and of cour&s;e, our religious liberties, that he rai&s;ed us up a &s;econd Matthias, even the great WASHINGTON, as an in&s;trument in his hands to &s;ave this land from ruin and &s;lavery; who has, by his great ge|neral&s;hip, rendered him&s;elf a world's wonder and a wonder to the world. But nothing is too hard or impo&s;&s;ible with God, who always fits and furni&s;hes in&s;truments &s;uitable to the work he has to do.</P>
<P>Second. To come down to the hi&s;tory of the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation, I allow indeed that in the time of the primitive per&s;ecuti|ons, under the heathen emperors, this great and well approved privilege of &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> defence was not much improved or made u&s;e of by chri&s;tians, who &s;tudied more to play the martyrs than to play the men as chri&s;tian &s;oldiers; becau&s;e&punc; at that time, the Lord was plea&s;ed, in his good providence, to &s;pirit them up, and call them unto, and accept of their hands pa&s;&s;ive te&s;timonies, while they were incorporate under a civil relation with the heathens, in &s;ubjection to governors, who did not, by open tyranny over|turn their civil liberties; but did only endeavour to eradicate religion, which, at that time, had never become their right by law, while they were &s;cattered&punc; and out of capacity, and never could come to a &s;eparate formed community, by joint concur|rence and corre&s;pondence, to undertake a declared re&s;i&s;tance, while religion was only propagating through the nations, and the Lord did providentially preclude the lea&s;t appearance that might be of propagating of it by any armed and formed force, being the go&s;pel of peace, de&s;igned to &s;ave and not to de&s;troy; yet even then&punc; and in that ca&s;e, there were in&s;tances of chri&s;tians re&s;i&s;ting their enemies, and re&s;cuing of their mini&s;ters, &amp;c. as they are found on record. Fir&s;t. How &s;ome inhabiting Marcota with force re&s;cued Diony&s;ius of Alexandria out of the hands of &s;uch as were carrying him away, about the year of our Lord 255. Second. How about the year 310 the Armenians waged war again&s;t Maximus, who was come again&s;t them with an army, becau&s;e of their religion. Third. About the year 342 the citizens of Athana&s;ius their mini&s;ter, again&s;t G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gorious, and Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ianus the emperor's captain, who came with &s;trong

How about the year 356 the people of Con&s;tantinople did, in like manner, &s;tand to the de|fence of Paulus again&s;t Con&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ius the emperor, and killed his Captain Hermogenes; and afterwards, in great multitudes, they oppo&s;ed the intru&s;ion of the heretick Macedonius. Fifth. How when a wicked edict was &s;ent forth to pull down the churches of &s;uch as were for the clau&s;e of one &s;ub&s;tance, the chri&s;tians that maintained that te&s;timony re&s;i&s;ted the bands of &s;oldiers that were procured at the emperors command, by Macedonius, to force the Mantinians to embrace the Arian here&s;y, but the chri&s;tians at Mantinium kindled with an earne&s;t zeal towards the chri&s;tian religion, went again&s;t the &s;oldiers with chear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ul minds, and val|liant courage, and made a great &s;laughter of them. Sixth. How about the year 387 the people of Ce&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea did defend Ba&s;il their mini&s;ter. Seventh. How for fear of the people, the Lieutenant of the emperor Vallens dur&s;t not execute tho&s;e eighty prie&s;ts who had come to &s;upplicate the emperor, and was commanded to be all killed by him. Eighth. How the inhabitants of Mount Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ia e&s;pou&s;ed By<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">il's quarrel, and a&s;&s;aulted the Lieutenant, and forced his guards to flee. Ninth. How about the year 404, when the emperor had bani&s;hed Chry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;tom, the people flocked together, &s;o that the emperor was nece&s;&s;itated to call him back again from his exile. Tenth. How the people re&s;i&s;ted al&s;o the tran&s;portation of Ambro&s;e by the command of Valentinian the emperor, and chu&s;ed rather to lo&s;e their lives than to &s;uffer their pa&s;tor to be taken away by the &s;oldiers. Eleventh. How the chri&s;tians, oppre&s;&s;ed by Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">atan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s king of Per&s;ia, did flee to the Romans to &s;eek their help, and Theodo&s;ius the emperor is much prai&s;ed for the war; (which, by the bye, fully ju&s;tifies the Americans &s;eeking relief from France, from the cruel ty|ranny of Britain, and of Louis XVI for granting of it, by which conduct of his he has endeared him&s;elf to every good whig, and to all who has a true regard for the rights of mankind; and to add &s;till more to his greatne&s;s and goodne&s;s, if I am rightly in|formed, he tolerates the free exerci&s;e of the prote&s;tant religion throughout his dominion. Who can &s;ay but what God, in his providence, is about by this great revolution to pull down one of the ten horns which has long &s;upported the bea&s;t?) But not to add here&punc; pardon the digre&s;&s;ion, I now return; which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had commenced again&s;t Chra&s;roes king of Per&s;ia upon this induce|ment that the king &s;ought to ruin and extirpate the&s;e chri&s;tians in his dominions that would not renounce the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Third. But when religion was once embraced in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bodied
<PB N="33" REF="017905_0017_0FA37A55A4777AD0">
corporations, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, and became a people's common intere&s;t and liberty, in a capacity to defend it with their lives and other liberties, and when it was propagated thro' the nations, then the Lord did call for other more active te&s;ti|monies in the pre&s;ervation and defence of it, of which we have many in&s;tances in hi&s;tories. About the year 894 the Bohemian chri&s;tians re&s;i&s;ted Drahomica their Queen, who thought to have de&s;troyed them, and to have re&punc;introduced pagani&s;m. About the year 1420 they maintained a long defen&s;ive war again&s;t the government, and the popes legates, under the management of their brave Captain Zizca, which was further pro&s;ecuted after him by the remaining Thaborites; and again in the year 1618, they maintained a defen&s;ive war again&s;t the emperor Ferdinand. Eleventh.

<P>Fourth. If we look into the hi&s;tory of the Walde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es, alias, Walloons, the&s;e con&s;tant oppo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> find ma|ny in&s;tances of their re&s;i&s;tance about the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">94. Very early, while Waldo, from whom they had their name, was alive, they began to defend them&s;elves by arms, after the bloody edict of Al|phon&s;us, king of Arragon; and in the year 1488, they re&s;i&s;t by arms Albert de Capitanei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;ent by Pope Innocent VIII, in Pra|gola and F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">niere, and throughout Pied Mont, wherefor the mo&s;t part the offspring of the old Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">den&s;es had their re&s;idence, where, very evidently, through many &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of ages, they &s;hewed them&s;elves to be the true &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of their worthy pro|genitors, valliant for the truth; that is a mo&s;t famous in&s;tance of their re&s;i&s;tance in oppo&s;ing vigorou&s;ly the Lord of Trinity, in that &s;ame Pied Mont, at which time they &s;o &s;olemnly a&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed their mini&s;ters whether it was lawful or not to defend them&s;elves again&s;t his violence, who did an&s;wer them in the affirmative, and accordingly they did it with wonderful &s;ucce&s;s at that time, and many times afterwards; e&s;pecially it is mu&s;t remarkable how, in in the year 1655, a mo&s;t vigorous d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">en&s;ive war was pro&s;ecuted again&s;t the duke of Savoy, by their captains Ginavel, Jahie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, &amp;c. which was e&s;pou&s;ed by many prote&s;tant princ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</P>
<P>Fifth. If we take a &s;urvey of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ories of the Albi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es, we find many in&s;tances of their defen&s;ive re&s;i&s;ting their oppre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="34" REF="017905_0018_0FA37A5605367130">
&s;uperiors. About the year 1200 they defended them&s;elves again&s;t the Popes legate, and his cro&s;&s;ed &s;oldiers, under the conduct fir&s;t of the Earl of Beziers, and then of the Earl of Foi&s;e, and Earl of Remand, of Tholou&s;e, and where helped by the Engli&s;h, who then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Guienne, bordering upon Thoulou&s;e, which re&s;i&s;tance continued many years.</P>
<P>Sixth. In Spain we find the people of Arragon conte&s;ting with Alph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;us III, and a&s;&s;ociating them&s;elves together again&s;t him; and they tell Pedro III, their king, that if he would not govern by, and according to law, they would pur&s;ue him by arms, about the year 1283, as al&s;o other Spaniards who ro&s;e in arms &s;everal times again&s;t Pedro, the fir&s;t king of Ca&s;tile.</P>
<P>Seventh. It was this that brought the Cantons of Helvetia in|to this &s;tate of freedom, wherein they have continued many years; for about the year 1260, they levied war again&s;t their op|pre&s;&s;ing nobles; and in the year 1308, they joined in covenant to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and in the year 1315&punc; they renewed it at Brunna, in which, at length, the re&s;t of the Cantons joined and formed them&s;elves into a com|mon wealth.</P>
<P>Eighth. If we take a view of the Germans, we will find, at the very commencement of the reformation, as &s;oon as they got the name of prote&s;tants, they re&s;i&s;ted the emperor Charles V&punc; the Duke of Saxon, the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, and the city of Maged|burgh, with the advice of lawyers concluded, "that the laws of empire permitted re&s;i&s;tance of the emperor, in &s;ome ca&s;es; that the times were then, &s;o dangerous, that the very force of con|&s;cience did leave them to arms and to make a league to defend them&s;elves, though Cae&s;ar, or any in his name, &s;hould make war again&s;t them; for &s;ince he attempteth to root out religion, and &s;ub|vert our liberties, he giveth us cau&s;e enough to re&s;i&s;t him with a good con&s;cience." The matter &s;tanding as it doth, we may &s;ay they re&s;i&s;t, as may be &s;hewed, both by &s;acred and profane hi&s;to|ries, and &s;o on, the whole they undertook, and &s;tated the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon the account of religion and liberty.</P>
<P>Ninth. If we but ca&s;t an eye over the hi&s;tory of Holland, we will find how much they are indebted to this practice of defen|&s;ive arms, having thereby recovered both religion and liberty, and e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves into a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tate; we find even in the time of D. de Alvas's per&s;ecution, they began to defend Haerlem, and Valenciennes in Hainault, and went on till under the conduct of William of Na&s;&s;au, Prince of Orange, they de|clared the king of Spain to have fallen from the government of
<PB N="35" REF="017905_0018_0FA37A5605367130">
tho&s;e countries, and &s;o effectually &s;hook off the yoke of ty|ranny.</P>
<P>Tenth. If we turn to the French Hugonots, we will find many in&s;tances among them, and many brave heroes rai&s;ed up to maintain the principles, and pro&s;ecute the practices thereof, of older and later date. The hi&s;tory of the civil wars of France is &s;tored with their trophies, and the memories of Con|de and Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">igni will ever be fragrant. There were many in|&s;tances of re&s;i&s;tance in tho&s;e times, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Eleventh. The many practices of the Hungarians, re&s;i&s;ting the encroachments of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, prove the &s;ame; and when Matthias denied the free exerci&s;e of religion unto the prote&s;tants of Au&s;tria, they took up arms in their own de|fence, and &s;ent a prote&s;tation unto the &s;tates of Hungary, re|quiring their a&s;&s;i&s;tance agreeable to their league.</P>
<P>Twelfth. The Polonians have oftentimes levied war again&s;t their kings, and we are furni&s;hed by Clark in his Martyrol&punc; with a late in&s;tance of their re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the &s;overeign powers at L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a, in Poland, as late as the year 1655.</P>
<P>Thirteenth. The Deans and Swedes have not been &s;lack on their parts, in taking cour&s;e with their Chri&s;tierns, kings of that name, whom they re&s;i&s;ted and puni&s;hed, and generally, wherever the reformation was received, we find this principle e&s;pou&s;ed, and the practice of it pro&s;ecuted; nay there hath been no nation in the world but it will be found they have ei|ther re&s;i&s;ted or killed tyrants.</P>
<P>Fourteenth. The mo&s;t de&s;erving and celebrated monarchs in the world, have e&s;pou&s;ed the quarrel of oppre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects not only &s;uch as Tamerlane, who&s;e ob&s;ervable &s;aying is noted when he advanced again&s;t Bajazet, I go, (&s;ays he) to cha&s;ti&s;e his tyranny, and to deliver the afflicted people; and Philip and Lewis of France, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the barons of England, a|gain&s;t king John; and Charles the great, who upon this ground undertook a war again&s;t the Lombards, in Italy. But even Con&s;tantine the Great hath it recorded, to his great ho|nour, that he employed his power and force again&s;t Licinius, upon no other motive but becau&s;e he bani&s;hed, tortured, and de&s;troyed tho&s;e chri&s;tians in his dominions that would not re|nounce their religion. And queen Elizabeth, of glorious me|mory, is to be highly commended for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Dutch to maintain their religion by force, when they could not enjoy it by favour. And king James Fir&s;t did give public aid to the prote&s;tants in Germany and Bohemia, again&s;t the emperor;
<PB N="36" REF="017905_0019_0FA37A56C31BC6C0">
again&s;t whom al&s;o Gu&s;tavas Adolphus marched, that he might deliver the oppre&s;&s;ed cities from the bondage that Ferdinand had brought them into. Yea poor &s;illy Charles Fir&s;t pretended, at lea&s;t, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the prote&s;tants in France at Ree and Rachel, and though he him&s;elf was re&s;i&s;ted by the parliaments of both kingdoms, yet he did declare in his acts of oblivion and paci|fication, the Scots taking up arms again&s;t him, in defence of their religion and liberties, to be no trea&s;on or rebellion. See Apol. Relat. Sect. 11. page 149; and although the late ty|rant Charles Second condemned all the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ings of the people of Scotland for defence of religion and liberty, which his own tyranny forced them into; yet he ju&s;tified the revolt of Hea|then and Mahometan &s;ubjects, as in the in&s;tance of the young king of Bantam, when by rea&s;on of his tyranny his &s;ubjects revolting and re&s;i&s;ting of him, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;aid Charles Second, fur|ni&s;hed the revolters with ammunition. &amp;c. Indeed many in|&s;tances might be adduced which &s;hews the righteou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch re&s;idances, when the greate&s;t of kings and queens have undertaken the patroni&s;ing of them.</P>
<P>Third. From &s;cripture proofs, the be&s;t of all proofs, I &s;hall endeavour briefly to gather &s;ome of the many that might be pre&s;&s;ed, which being put together to me, &s;eem impregnable. I &s;hall reduce them to the&s;e heads. Fir&s;t. I &s;hall adduce &s;ome practices of the Lord's people, frequently reiterated, ne|ver condemned, always approved, confirming this point. Second. Some &s;evere reprehen&s;ions for their omi&s;&s;ion of this duty in the &s;ea&s;on thereof. Third. Some promi&s;es both of &s;piriting for the duty and of countenancing of it when under|taken. Fourth. Some precepts commanding &s;uch a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">chieve|ments. Fifth. Some prayers, &s;upplicating for them, all which, put together, I think will make a &s;trong argument, for practi|ces of this kind is common in &s;cripture hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. I &s;hall begin at the fir&s;t war, which we find recorded in the world, wherein it &s;eems the godly at fir&s;t &s;uffered &s;ome, but afterwards, by the virtue and val<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of their brethren, they were vindicated, and the victory recovered with great honour. Lot and his family, living in Sodom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">r taken pri&s;oner by Chedarlaon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er and his confederates.

the&s;e &s;ubjects to oppo&s;e that violence; but here is a clear ex|ample of that in Abraham, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Second. When the Lord's people were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Canaan, and forgetting the Lord, did enter into affinity with the&s;e in|terdicted nations, &s;ome of them were left to prove I&s;rael, that the generations of the children of I&s;rael might know to teach them war. Judges iii. 1 2. And when they did evil in the &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ht of the Lord, he &s;old them into the hand of Cu&s;han-ri&s;ha|thaim king of Me&s;opotamia, whom they &s;erved and were &s;ub|ject to full eight years. Ver&s;e 8. But when they humbled them&s;elves, and cried unto the Lord, their rebellion, in &s;ha|king off that yoke, was &s;ucce&s;&s;ful under the conduct of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hniel. Ver&s;e 10. And after a relap&s;e, unto the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ke defection, they be|came &s;ubject to Egl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, king of Moab, whom they &s;erved eigh|teen years. Ver&s;e 14. But attempting the &s;ame remedy by arms, under the conduct of E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ud, they recovered their liberty; and after his death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alling into that &s;in again, which procured the like mi&s;ery, they became &s;ubject to Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in king of Canaan, who twenty years mightily oppre&s;&s;ed them. Judg. iv. 1, 3. But by the Lord's commandment, under the conduct of Deborah and Barak, they rebelled and prevailed. Whence I infer, if the Lord's people, &s;erving a haughty tyrant, may &s;hake off the yoke of their &s;ubjection, then it is duty to defend them&s;elves, and re|&s;i&s;t them, for there is no other way of &s;haking it off; but the&s;e examples prove the former, therefore, &amp;c. Obj. if any &s;hould reply, and cavil, and declare the&s;e were not their own kings, to whom they owed allegiance, but only invading conquerors, whom they might re&s;i&s;t, I an&s;wer, Fir&s;t, Yet they were the &s;ove|reign powers, for the time being, and therefore if the doctrines and principles of both antient and modern to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ies be true and good, they ought, upon no pretence what&s;oever, to be re&s;i&s;ted (O! poor &s;laves, that believes &s;uch doctrines!) and perhaps by compact, they were not their kings, yet by conque&s;t they were, as much as that would make them, and by their own con&s;ent, when they paid them kings due, (viz) tribute. Second, No more are they our kings who attempts to de&s;troy charters&punc; overturn religion, liberty, and law, as the king of Britain and his venal parliament lately did. Witne&s;s the Bo&s;ton charter, &amp;c. I &s;ay to &s;uch we owe no allegiance, no more than I&s;rael of old did to tho&s;e ty|rants, for tyranny is the &s;ame in all ages. Third, I retort that old colewort, twice boiled, who &s;hould be judge whether they were their own lawful kings or not, for they acted as kings, and thought them&s;elves their ab&s;olute Lords, and gave them&s;elves
<PB N="38" REF="017905_0020_0FA37A5783D1E7C0">
out to be &s;uch; and yet we find an approved rebellion again&s;t them. Mr. Gee, in his magi&s;trates original, Chap 8. Sect. 4. Page 268, improves the&s;e in&s;tances to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and adds. "Neither as far as my ob&s;ervation goes, can any imme|diate or extraordinary command of word, for what they &s;o did, be pretended to or pleaded from the text, for many of them, or for any, &s;ave Barak or Gideon."</P>
<P>Third. Yet Gideon's example, though he had an extraordinary call, cannot be pretended as unimo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">able on the matter, for that was ordinary, though the call and manner was extraordinary; he, with the aid of a few m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, did break the yoke of &s;ubjection to Midian. Judg. vi. 7. And having called his brethren out of all Mount Ephraim, into a conjunction with him, in the pur&s;uit of his victory, when he demanded &s;upply of the princes of Succoth, and of the men of Penuel, and they denied it, he &s;erved them as enemies. Whence I conclude, if a &s;mall party may, with God's approbation, deliver them&s;elves and the whole of their commu|nity from the bondage of their oppre&s;&s;ing ma&s;ters, whom they had &s;erved &s;everal years, and may puni&s;h their kings that do not turn out to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and encourage them in that at|tempt, then mu&s;t it be duty to defend them&s;elves again&s;t their op|pre&s;&s;ors, that rule over them, and all ought to concur in it, or el&s;e there would not be ju&s;tice in puni&s;hing them that were de|fective in this work; but we &s;ee the former by this example, therefore, &amp;c. Obj. If it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;aid that Gideon, and the re&s;t of the extraordinary rai&s;ed judges, were magi&s;trates, therefore they might defend and deliver their country, which a private people, that are only &s;ubjects&punc; may not do. I an&s;wer, Fir&s;t&punc; They were &s;ubject to tho&s;e tyrants that oppre&s;&s;ed them, who were then the &s;overeign powers of that time; and yet they &s;hook of that yoke be defen&s;ive arms. Second&punc; They were not then magi&s;trates when they fir&s;t appeared for their countries defence, and deliverance; neither in that did they act as &s;uch, but only as Captains of re|bels in the e&s;teem of them that had power over them. Ju&s;t &s;o has our modern oppre&s;&s;ors and to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ies looked upon all our generals and officers in this grand &s;truggle for American liberty. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, Gideon was no ruler, until that authority was conferred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him after the deliverance. See Judg. viii. 22, &amp;c. Yet he did all this before.</P>
<P>Fourth. When his ba&s;tard Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">melech u&s;urped the govern|ment, and was made king by the men of Shechem, at length, God &s;ending an evil &s;pirit between him and his complices, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him up, not only was he re&s;i&s;ted by the treacherous She|chemites,
<PB N="39" REF="017905_0020_0FA37A5783D1E7C0">
which was their brand and bane, in the righteous judg|ment of God, for their aiding at fir&s;t in killing his brethren. Judg. ix. 23, 24. &amp;c. But al&s;o he was oppo&s;ed by others of the men of I&s;rael, as at Thebez, where he was &s;lain by a woman. Ver&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0, at the end. Whence, if an u&s;urping tyrant acknow|leged as king by the generality, may be di&s;owned by the godly, and threatened with God's vengeance to con&s;ume both him and his complices, that comply with him; and if he may be oppo&s;ed and re&s;i&s;ted, not only by tho&s;e that &s;et him up, but al&s;o by others that were in &s;ubjection to him, and at length be killed by them, without re&s;entment of the re&s;t of the nation, then mo&s;t it cer|tainly be duty for a people who had no hand is the &s;etting up &s;uch a tyrant to defend them&s;elves again&s;t his force; but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> former is true by this example, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fifth. When I&s;rael of old, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell under the tyranny of a Ammon, oppre&s;&s;ing them eighteen years, they did, by re&s;i&s;ting the&s;e &s;u|preme powers, &s;hake off their yoke, under the conduct of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ph|thah; and being challenged &s;harply by the men of Ephraim, who, it &s;eems, claimed the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ero<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ative of making war, and there|fore came to revenge and reduce J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">phthah and his company to or|der, ju&s;t like tories, who are very tenacious of this plea of the Eph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mites, that at lea&s;t, without the nobles of the kingdom, no war is to be made; yet we find Jephthah did not much regard it, but &s;toutly defended him&s;elf, and &s;lew of them 42 000 m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, by their Shibboleth. Judg. xii. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> people then, when que&s;tioned for defending them&s;elves by them that claim a &s;uperiority over them, and &s;hould deliver them, may defend them&s;elve both without them, and again&s;t them, then I &s;ay, it is a people's duty and privilege; but the former is true by this example, there|fore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sixth. They were then made &s;ubject to the Phili&s;tines forty years, whom the men of Judah acknowledged for their rulers, yet Sam&s;on, that rough handed &s;aint, never cea&s;ed from pelting them upon all occa&s;ions; and when challenged for it by the men of Judah &s;aying knowe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t thou not that the Phili&s;tines are ru|lers over us, what is that thou ha&s;t done?

As they did unto me &s;ays he, &s;o have I done unto them. Judg. xv. 11. Hence, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ints may avenge them&s;elves upon them whom the country ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s rulers, and when enab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by God, may do to them as they did to them, then mu&s;t it be a duty for them to defend them&s;elves again&s;t them; but the antecedent is true by this example, therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="017905_0021_0FA37A5843D78928">
Seventh. When Saul, in the pursuit of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, had charged the people with a fooli&s;h oath not to eat any food until the evening, Jonathan his own &s;on ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed but a little honey, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he mu&s;t die! which Saul confirmed with another peremptory oath, God do &s;o to him, and more al&s;o, if he &s;hould not die. Whereupon the people, as re&s;olute on the other hand to &s;ave him, re&s;i&s;ted the rage of Saul, and &s;wore as peremptorily that not one hair of his head &s;hould fall to the ground; &s;o the people re&s;cued Jonathan that he died not. 1 Sam. xiv. 44, 45. Hence if people may covenant, by oath, to re&s;i&s;t the commands and re&s;cue a man from a tyrant's cruelty, then it is duty to defend them&s;elves again&s;t him. The Antecedent is true here.</P>
<P>Eighth. Afterwards, when the manner of the king, pre&s;aged by Samuel, was verified in Saul's degeneration, into many abu|&s;es of government, this privilege of re&s;i&s;tance was not wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">cipated, but maintained by David&punc; defen&s;ive appearance; with his little army, he took Goliah's &s;wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, not for ornament o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> only to fright Saul, but to defend him&s;elf with it, and was Captain fir&s;t to 400 men. 1 Sam xxi. 2.

<P>Tenth. The ten tribes revolted from the hou&s;e of David, when Rehoboam claimed an ab&s;olute power and would not ac|quie&s;ce to the people's ju&s;t conditions. 1 King's xii. 2 Chron. x.

Lex Rex, Que&s;t 32 p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">6.

Chron. xxiii. and when &s;he came and cried out trea&s;on! trea&s;on! they regarded it no, but commanded to kill her and all that help her.

<P>Fifteenth.

<P>Sixteenth. After the return from the Babyloni&s;h captivity, when the Jews &s;et about building the Temple, which they cho&s;e to do them&s;elves, and not admit of any a&s;&s;ociation with enemies; upon their mi&s;information and fal&s;e accu&s;ation, that they were building the rebellious and bad city, and would refu&s;e to pay the king his cu&s;tom, they were &s;traightly di&s;charged by A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">axe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, to proceed in their work, and the inhibition was executed by force and power.

<P>Seventeenth.

<P>Eighteenth. I &s;hall now conclude with one in&s;tance more, which is vindicated by Ju&s;.

E&s;ther iii. 12, 13. Yet the Lord's providence, always propitious to his people, brought it about &s;o that Haman being hanged, and Mordecai advanced, the Jews were called and capacitated as well as nece&s;&s;itated to re|&s;i&s;t that armed authority that decreed to ma&s;&s;acre them, and that by the king's own allowance. E&s;ther ix. When his former decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, it was turned to he contrary, that no man could with&s;tand them. Here they had the allowance of authority to re&s;i&s;t authority, and this was not a gift of a new right by that grant, which they had not before, only it was corroborative of the irradical right to defend them|&s;elves; which is not the donative of kings, and which they had power to exerci&s;e and u&s;e without this, though may be not the &s;ame capacity, for the king's warrant could not make it lawful in point of con&s;cience, if it had not been &s;o before. Hence I argue, if people may have the allowance of well advi&s;ed-authori|ty to re&s;i&s;t the decree and force of unlawful authority, then may people maintain right authority in defending them&s;elves again&s;t the injuries of pretended authority; but by this very in&s;tance we plainly &s;ee, that the Jews had Aha&s;uerus's allowance to re&s;i&s;t the decree and force of his own ill-advi&s;ed authority, though irrever&s;able, and hence we learn, that di&s;tinction in this point is not groundle&s;s between re&s;i&s;ting the authority of &s;u|preme power and the abu&s;es of the &s;ame.</P>

Fir&s;t. In that fore&s;ighted te&s;tament of the patriarch Jacob, in that part of it which concerns God, he prophecies that tribe &s;hall have a lot in the world, an&s;wering his name, and be engaged in many conflicts with oppre&s;&s;ing dominators, who at fir&s;t &s;hould p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">vail over him, but at length God &s;hould &s;o ble&s;s his endea|vours to free him&s;elf from their oppre&s;&s;ions, that he &s;hould over|come.

Gen. x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ix. 19.

But here is a pro|mi&s;e, &amp;c.</P>

In that threatening again&s;t tyrants&punc; &s;hewing how they &s;hall be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t away and burnt up with fire&punc; there is couched a promi&s;e, and al&s;o an implied precept of re&s;i&s;ting them. 2.

<P>Third. When the Lord &s;hall have mercy an Jacob and chu&s;e I&s;rael, it is promi&s;ed. I&s;aiah xiv. 2, 3.

Luke xxii. 36. Now he that hath a pur&s;e, let him take it, and likewi&s;e his &s;crip; and he that hath no &s;word, let him &s;ell his garment and buy one. Before, when he had &s;ent them out upon an extra|ordinary commi&s;&s;ion, as it were to &s;erve their apprentice&s;hip in the work of the go&s;pel, he did not allow them &s;uch &s;olicitous care to provide them&s;elves, becau&s;e he would give them a proof of his &s;ufficiency to &s;u&s;tain and protect them without the ordinary means of their own diligence; but now, when he was about to withdraw his bodily pre&s;ence from them, and would warn them of the many di&s;couragements they were to look for in the pro&s;ecution of their more continued work, which they had a commi&s;&s;ion for, not to be retracted, he would not
<PB N="50" REF="017905_0026_0FA37A5C0307C990">
have them expect provi&s;ion and protection by a cour&s;e of mira|cles, but to provide them&s;elves with means for their &s;u&s;tenance, and al&s;o for their defence again&s;t the violence of men, which chiefly was to be expected from their rulers, who would per&s;e|cute them under the notion of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the laws of the kingdoms and countries. He was not, indeed, to make much u&s;e of them at that time for him&s;elf, who was then to fini&s;h the work of redemption by &s;uffering, only that what was written might be accompli&s;hed in him, he would make &s;o much u&s;e of them as voluntarily to be involved under the cen&s;ure and re|proach of rebellion, being taken among men in arms, that he might be reckoned among tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. Ver&s;e 37. Therefore when they told him they had two &s;words, he &s;aid it is enough. Ver&s;e 38. I think I need not &s;tand long here to confute that im|pertinency of a conceit that the&s;e were &s;piritual &s;words, which indeed de&s;erves no confutation, being fitter to be put among the many delicious de&s;tractions, and other errors of Quakers, than to be numbered among the notions of men of common under&s;tand|ing. Indeed I could hardly be brought to believe they did hold &s;uch an error, if I had not been informed by a per&s;on of credit, who a&s;&s;ured me he had it from the mouth of one of their &s;peak|ers or teachers. O horrid bla&s;phemy! Purcha&s;e the &s;pirit of God, or the &s;word of the &s;pirit, or a &s;piritual &s;word, with the price of an old garment. Surely if this was true, then the pur&s;e and &s;crip mu&s;t be &s;piritual too, and the&s;e bought by &s;elling of old garments; and yet they would be &s;uch &s;piritual &s;words as would cut off carnal ears, and &s;uch as would be both vi&s;ible and &s;en&s;ible, and two of them would be enough. But it does not ad|mit of a doubt, but what they were ordinary and material &s;words, which the Lord did command his followers to provide them&s;elves with for their defence as men, in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, and when they &s;hould be in a capacity to improve them again&s;t their mur|dering per&s;ecutors, again&s;t whom he gives his royal grant of re|&s;i&s;tance, that the world may know his &s;ubjects, though they have more privileges &s;piritual, yet they have no le&s;s human privileges than other men, although at that period of his determined &s;uffer|ing, he would not allow the pre&s;ent u&s;e of them. From hence I argue, that if the Lord's people &s;hould provide them&s;elves with arms of defence, though they &s;hould, by a wicked world, be re|puted &s;inners and the greate&s;t of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors for &s;o doing, then &s;urely they may u&s;e the&s;e arms of defence again&s;t them that per|&s;ecute them; therefore &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fifth. We may infer the &s;ame truth from &s;ome of the pray|ers
<PB N="51" REF="017905_0026_0FA37A5C0307C990">
of the &s;aints, wherein they glory in the con&s;tant expectation of the Lord's &s;trengthening them, and favouring and approving their helpers, and in the experience of the Lord's a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, while in the mean time con&s;titute in a formed appearance of re|&s;i&s;tance. I &s;hall only hint the&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. In that prayer, P&s;al. xliv. 5. They glory in hope, that through the Lord they will pu&s;h down their enemies, &amp;c. Yet then at that time they were under the power of tyrants, which they were re&s;i&s;ting, for Ver&s;e 9. They complain they were put to &s;hame, becau&s;e the Lord went not forth with their armies, and they which hated them &s;poiled them; and for his &s;ake were killed all day long. Hence they plead, that the Lord would a|wake and not forget their affliction and oppre&s;&s;ion; whereby it is evident, they were under the yoke of tyrants, and re&s;i&s;ting ac|cording to their might; which, by whom&s;oever or upon what occa&s;ion &s;oever, the p&s;alm was compiled, &s;hews that no want of &s;ucce&s;s in re&s;i&s;ting tyrants can mar the &s;aints faith in pleading for the Lord's a&s;&s;i&s;tance and approbation of the duty. Hence I argue, that if they that in faith may pray for and boa&s;t of their treading down their enemies, that ri&s;e like tyrants up again&s;t them, they may al&s;o in faith attempt the re&s;i&s;ting them in their own defence. But here the Lord's people did the former; there|fore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Second. We find David, under Saul's per&s;ecution, while h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> had a party of 600 men to defend him&s;elf again&s;t his rage, in the p&s;alms which he compo&s;ed upon that occa&s;ion, not only com|plaining of oppre&s;&s;ors, but encouraging him&s;elf in the faith that God would be with them that a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his attempt to de|fend him&s;elf, and imprecating de&s;truction to Saul and his com|plices. That the Lord would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut them off in his truth and let him &s;ee his de&s;ire upon them. P&s;al. liv. 4, 5. la&s;t ver&s;e, and P&s;al. lvii, 4. and P&s;al&punc; lvii throughout, and P&s;al. cxl. 7, 9. He imprecates again&s;t the head of them that compa&s;&s;ed him about, and of cour&s;e again&s;t Saul. Whence I argue, Fir&s;t. If the Lord's people, conflicting with and encompa&s;&s;ed with oppre&s;&s;ing rulers, as &s;o many lions and dogs, may pray and prai&s;e for the help of tho&s;e that a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their endeavours of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation from them, then may they make u&s;e of their help for their de|fence for which they pray and prai&s;e. But here we &s;ee the Lord's people did the former; therefore they may and ought to do the latter.</P>
<P>Second. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> may pray again&s;t kings, and for pre&s;ervation from them, then may we defend our&s;elves again&s;t them, and en|deavour
<PB N="52" REF="017905_0027_0FA37A5CC3C25B48">
the means of that pre&s;ervation for which we pray? The connection is before cleared, yet here I add, that which will give a di&s;pen&s;ation from our duty of praying for them, will al&s;o di&s;|pen&s;e from the duty of being pa&s;&s;ively &s;ubject to their will, and con&s;equently will allow the defending our&s;elves from their vio|lence. And here we &s;ee tyranny and treachery, and de&s;igned mi&s;chief, will give a di&s;pen&s;ation from our duty of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aying for them, altho' that be duty as indi&s;pen&s;ible a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ubjection. Again if any thing deter us from re&s;i&s;ting of kings, it mu&s;t be re&s;pect to their maje&s;ty and the character of the Lord's anointing upon them. But we &s;ee no re&s;pect to that will deter a believer from praying in faith again&s;t them, therefore no &s;uch re&s;pect will hin|der, but that he may defend him&s;elf again&s;t his violence; and indeed, if we do but con&s;ider it right, if the impre&s;&s;ion of any maje&s;ty God hath put upon kings, &s;hould tie up our hands from any re&s;i&s;tance, it will al&s;o re&s;train from prayer re&s;i&s;tance; for if that impre&s;&s;ion have any force at any time, it mu&s;t be when a man is mo&s;t &s;olemnly &s;tated before God, and &s;peaking to God as a chri&s;tian, rather than when he is acting as a man with a man like him&s;elf; and as prayer re&s;i&s;tance is the mo&s;t formidable and forceable re&s;i&s;tance of any in the world&punc; as this Saul, and our la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e George, and many other tyrants have found, by their wo|ful experience, &s;o it is more re&s;tricted than other re&s;i&s;tance, for we may defend our&s;elves again&s;t many whom we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not pray again&s;t, to wit, our private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, for whom we are command|ed to pray; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no body will deny but we may re&s;i&s;t their vio|lence; and likewi&s;e, we are commanded to pray for kings, when inve&s;ted with God's authority; but when, by their degeneration, we are loo&s;ed from that obligation to pray for them, and allows us to pray again&s;t them, when they turn enemies to God, and oppre&s;&s;ors of his people, as we &s;ee in the prayer of the P&s;almi&s;t, then may we mo&s;t warrantably re&s;i&s;t them by defen&s;ive arms.</P>
<P>Third and la&s;tly. Among the hallelujahs in the end of P&s;alms, there is one calculated for the prevailing time of the church, when the Lord &s;hall take plea&s;ure in his people. In that time of the &s;aints being joyful in glory, when they may glo|ry in the re&s;t and &s;ecurity the Lord will vouch&s;afe upon them, they are prophetically, and very pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hetically, excited to prai&s;e prayer wi&s;e. P&s;al. cxlix. 6. To the end let the high prai&s;es of God be in their mouth, and a two edged &s;word in their hand to bind their kings with chains, to execute upon them the judg|ment written. This honour have all the &s;aints, hallelujah. This was their prai&s;e and honour when they were brought on to execute vengeance on their kings and nobles of Canaan; this
<PB N="53" REF="017905_0027_0FA37A5CC3C25B48">
al&s;o in David's time was the ambition and al&s;o the attainment of the &s;aints in their triumphant victories over many of their op|pre&s;&s;ors round about them. But it looks to a further and more fa|mous executio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of vengeance upon the tyrants of the world, when they have long kept under the church of God, and at length, the Lord &s;hall give his people a capacity to break their yoke, which, whenever it &s;hall be, &s;hall be then great honour. Hence I argue la&s;tly, if it will be the honour of the &s;aints, when the Lord puts them in capacity to execute vengeance upon their ene|mies, though they be kings, nobles&punc; &amp;c. that oppre&s;s them, then it may be their ambition to &s;eek it; at lea&s;t they may re&s;i&s;t them. Thus I think I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hewn from the law of God, the law of nature, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of nations the lawfulne&s;s of the u&s;e of de|fen&s;ive arms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> defend our rights, liberties civil and re|ligious, when attacked by tyrants; at lea&s;t I think it will con|vince all but &s;uch as are determined not to be convinced. E&s;pe|cially, I think it appears clear from &s;cripture practices, reproofs, promi&s;es, precepts, and prayers, this truth has been proven; al|though I allow that other precious truths are more natively de|du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d, yet this great truth by un&s;trained and uncon&s;trained con|&s;equence, may, and is al&s;o, clearly inferred.</P>

<HEAD>A &s;hort Receipt for a Continental Di&s;ea&s;e, The name whereof is the love of Money.</HEAD>
<P>THE holy &s;criptures informs us, that the love of money&punc; is the root of all evil. And this our daily experience doth al&s;o make manife&s;t. It drives people into the commi&s;&s;ion of all evil, to the ruin of them&s;elves and others. How are people dai|ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing each other in &s;ueing and tearing each other limb from limb, in order to handle a little of this tra&s;h, a world of which will not purcha&s;e a &s;park of grace, nor one inch of time, when on a death bed. Paying no regard to the di&s;tre&s;s of the times, nor to the cries of the poor, the needy, widow, and fa|therle&s;s children. Perhaps &s;uch who&s;e fathers have fought, bled, and died by our &s;ides, nobly fighting in our glorious cau&s;e. How doleful the thought, that we who have &s;o nobly joined hand in hand to defeat Briti&s;h cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;hould now devour one another? Which is daily practicing. I &s;hall now give a word of advice to creditors and debtors, which I &s;hall divide into two cla&s;&s;es. Fir&s;t publick creditors and debtors. Secondly private ditto. Publick creditors is our rulers and governors, who have a right, for our good and &s;afety, to demand taxes from us. Gen|tlemen, let me beg of you to be as &s;paring in your demands as po&s;&s;ible. You are not un&s;en&s;ible that the times are hard, and ca&s;h &s;carce. Endeavour to give &s;atisfaction to the commonalty, that what they pay in taxes is faithfully applied to the u&s;es it were paid for. The money is the people's to pay and yours to apply, which ought to be done with the greate&s;t oeconomy. Let no one get rich that handles publick money. I think I have once read of a great general that had &s;erved his country long and faithfully, when he car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e to die all he could call his own was his di&s;h and &s;poon, and was buried by charity. A rare in&s;tance indeed, but a noble one. He prefered the publick's intere&s;t to his own.</P>
<P>You, my countrymen, publick debtors. Gentlemen, plea&s;e to con&s;ider that no war can be carried on, no government kept up, without taxes, and hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> ones too; and con&s;ider what a &s;itua|tion you would &s;oon be in, if there was no government. Could you &s;leep one night in peace? Could yo call any thing your own one day&punc; Therefore if you are wi&s;e you will mo&s;t chear|fully part with &s;ome of your wealth to &s;ecure the re&s;t; for I am confident he is an enemy to him&s;elf and country too, that is back|ward
<PB N="55" REF="017905_0028_0FA37A5D83B70CC0">
in paying his taxes. Con&s;ider that it is not for us common people to be led into all the &s;ecrets of government. Surely we mu&s;t believe that tho&s;e which we have tru&s;ted at the helm of af|fairs does know be&s;t what &s;ums is nece&s;&s;ary to be rai&s;ed from us for our good and protection; and I think we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that our legi&s;lature will not lay any needle&s;s bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">thens upon us; for my own part, I have that confidence in them that I am de|termined to pay my taxes as long as I have a copper left, or can rai&s;e it; for I am &s;ure if the enemy &s;hould overcome, or govern|ment fails, I am gone finally.</P>
<P>You gentlemen that may be called private creditors, let me in|treat of you to make u&s;e of every method to come at your rights and money, be&s;ides law. If it is a matter of di&s;pute &s;ubmit it to reference. If it is clear debt, exerci&s;e patience, bear and forbear with your poor debtors. Let nothing but the utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, let me &s;ay extremity, drive you to di&s;tre&s;s mankind at this dole|ful day. Cau&s;e not the cries of the poor and needy widow, fa|therle&s;s and orphan children, to a&s;cend up to Heaven again&s;t you for di&s;tre&s;&s;ing them in order to obtain ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to lay out in toys, to adorn your and families bodies with. Remember, O remember, a judgment day to come.</P>
<P>And now to you gentlemen debtors. I would have you remem|ber tho&s;e &s;cripture &s;ayings owe no man any thing, pay to all their dues. See that you pay to all their ju&s;t dues, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. If you have not ca&s;h turn out any thing you can po&s;|&s;ibly &s;pare; yea, offer all you have to your creditors; and &s;ure|ly, if they are chri&s;tians, and endowed with humane hearts, if they &s;ee you thus willing to di&s;tre&s;s your&s;elves to pay them, they will nobly refu&s;e it and grant you longer day. U&s;e them well, give them good language, and if po&s;&s;ible deceive them not. Practice indu&s;try and good oeconomy, for a creditor has hawk's eyes; and do not love to &s;ee their debtors &s;truting about in fine rigging at their expence. Above all, remember the golden rule, do to all men as you would have them do to you again.</P>
