<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the de&s;ign of Learning is to render per&s;ons agreeable companions to them&s;elves, and u&s;eful members of &s;ociety; to &s;upport &s;olitude with plea&s;ure, and to pa&s;s through promi&s;cuous temptations with prudence; 'tis pre&s;umed, this compilation will not be unacceptable; being compo&s;ed of pieces &s;elected from the mo&s;t celebrated moral writers in the Engli&s;h language, equally calculated to promote the princi|ples of religion, and to render youth vigilant in di&s;|charging the &s;ocial and relative duties in the &s;everal &s;tations of life; by in&s;tilling into their minds &s;uch maxims of virtue and good-breeding, as tend to eradicate local prejudices and ru&s;ticity of manners; and at the &s;ame time, habituate them to an elegant manner of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves either in Writing or Speaking.</P>
<P>And as the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion made on the minds of youth is the mo&s;t la&s;ting, great care &s;hould be taken to furni&s;h them with &s;uch &s;eeds of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, as may rectify and &s;weeten every part of their future lives; by marking out a proper behaviour both with re&s;pect to them&s;elves and others, and exhibiting every virtue to their view which claims their attenti|on, and every vice which they ought to avoid. In&s;tead of this, we generally &s;ee youth &s;uffered to read romances, which impre&s;s on their minds &s;uch notions of Fairies, Goblins, &amp;c. that exi&s;t only in the imagination, and, being &s;trongly imbibed, take much time to eradicate, and very often baffle all the power of philo&s;ophy. If books abounding with moral in&s;tructions, conveyed in a proper manner, were given in their &s;tead, the frequent reading of them would implant in their minds &s;uch ideas and &s;enti|ments, as would enable them to guard again&s;t tho&s;e prejudices &s;o frequently met with among&s;t the ig|norant.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="020531_0003_0FAFE316BB06E2B8">Nor is it po&s;&s;ible that any per&s;on can &s;peak or write with elegance and propriety, who has not been taught to read well, and in &s;uch books where the &s;en|timents are ju&s;t and the language pure.</P>
<P>An in&s;ipid flatne&s;s and languor is almo&s;t the univer|&s;al fault in reading; often uttering their words &s;o faint and feeble, that they appear neither to feel nor under&s;tand what they read, nor have any de&s;ire it &s;hould be under&s;tood or felt by others. In order to acquire a forcible manner of pronouncing words, let the pupils inure them&s;elves, while reading, to draw in as much air as their lungs can contain with ea&s;e, and to expel it with vehemence in uttering tho&s;e &s;ounds which require an emphatical pronunciation, and to read aloud with the exertion they can com|mand; let all the con&s;onant &s;ounds be expre&s;&s;ed with a full impul&s;e of the breath, and a forcible action of the organs employed in forming them; and all the vowel &s;ounds have a full and bold utterance.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons, and to in&s;pire youth with noble &s;en|timents, ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, to ea&s;e the teacher, and to render a book cheap and convenient for &s;chools, as well as private per&s;ons who have neither time nor opportunity to peru&s;e the works of tho&s;e celebrated authors from whence this Collection is made, was the cau&s;e of the following compilation.</P>
<P>And as &s;peeches in both hou&s;es of parliament, plead|ings at the bar, in&s;tructions in the pulpit, and com|mercial corre&s;pondence, are delivered and carried on in the Engli&s;h Language; the cloathing our thoughts with proper expre&s;&s;ions, and conveying our ideas, either in writing or &s;peaking, agreeably, cannot fail of making an impre&s;&s;ion upon the hearer or reader. For, a man's knowledge is of little u&s;e to the world, when he is not able to convey it properly to others; which is the ca&s;e of many who are endowed with excellent parts, but are either afraid or a&s;hamed of writing, or &s;peaking in public, being con&s;cious of their own deficiency of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves in pro|per terms.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="020531_0004_0FAFE31779F25DA8">In order to remedy the&s;e defects, and to ea&s;e the teacher, I would advi&s;e, that &s;everal young gentlemen read in a cla&s;s, each a &s;entence in this book, (it being divided into &s;mall portions for that purpo&s;e) as often as convenient: and let him who reads be&s;t, be ad|vanced to the head, or have &s;ome pecuniary reward; and every inferior one according to his merit: this will create emulation among them, and facilitate their improvement much more than threats or correc|tions, which &s;tupifies and intimidates them, and often ends in contempt of their teachers, and learning in general. This will draw forth tho&s;e latent abili|ties, which otherwi&s;e might lie dormant for ever.</P>
<P>It may not be improper for the teacher, or &s;ome good reader; to read a &s;entence or two fir&s;t, that the learners may gain the proper empha&s;is, and read without that monotony &s;o painful to a good ear: for they will improve more by imitating a good reader, than any rules that can be laid down to them. When they come to read gracefully, let them &s;tand up in the &s;chool and read aloud, in order to take off that ba&s;hfulne&s;s generally attending tho&s;e who are called upon either to read or &s;peak in public.</P>
<P>The next thing I would recommend, is the En|gli&s;h Grammar, (the be&s;t I know of is Buchanan's Syntax) the knowledge of which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry, as it is the &s;olid foundation upon which all other &s;cience re&s;ts. After they have run over the rules of &s;yntax, the teacher may dictate to them one or more &s;entences in fal&s;e Engli&s;h, which they may correct by their grammar rules, and al&s;o find out the various &s;ignifications of each word in the dictionary; by which means they will &s;oon acquire a copious voca|bulary, and become acquainted not with words only, but with things them&s;elves. Let them get tho&s;e &s;en|tences by heart to &s;peak extempore: which will, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be delivering their own compo&s;itions, and may be repeated as often as convenient. This
<PB N="vi" REF="020531_0005_0FAFE3183B0AF998">
will &s;oon give the young gentlemen an idea of the force, elegance, and beauty of the Engli&s;h language.</P>
<P>The next thing I would gladly recommend, is that of letter-writing, a branch of education, which &s;eems to me of the utmo&s;t utility, and in which mo&s;t of our youth are deficient at their leaving &s;chool; being &s;uffered to form their own &s;tile by chance, or imitate the fir&s;t wretched model that falls in their way, be|fore they know what is faulty, or can reli&s;h the beau|ties of a ju&s;t &s;implicity.</P>
<P>For their improvement in this particular, the teacher may cau&s;e every young gentleman to have a &s;late or paper before him, on Saturdays, and then dictate a letter to them, either of his own compo&s;iti|on, or taken out of &s;ome book, and turn it into fal&s;e Engli&s;h, to exerci&s;e them in the grammar rules if he thinks proper, which they &s;hould all write down, and then correct and tran&s;cribe it fairly in their books.</P>
<P>After the young gentlemen have been accu&s;tomed to this &s;ome time, a &s;uppo&s;ed corre&s;pondence may be fixt between every two of them, and write to one ano|ther under the in&s;pection of the teacher, who may correct and &s;hew their faults when he &s;ees occa&s;ion; by &s;uch a method he will &s;oon find them improve in epi&s;tolary writing. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved with regard to young ladies, who are very often deficient, not only in orthography, but every other part of grammar.</P>
<P>If &s;omething &s;imilar to this method be pur&s;ued, it will &s;oon reflect honour on the teacher, give the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction to judicious parents, and entail upon the &s;cholar a plea&s;ing and la&s;ting advantage.</P>

<HEAD>Pur&s;uit of Knowledge recommended to Youth.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I AM very much concerned when I &s;ee young gentlemen of fortune and quality &s;o wholly &s;et upon plea&s;ure and diver&s;ions, that they neglect all tho&s;e improvements in wi&s;dom and knowledge which may make them ea&s;y to them&s;elves and u&s;eful to the world. The greate&s;t part of our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> youth lo&s;e their figure, and grow out of fa&s;hion, by that time they are five and twenty.</P>
<P N="2">2. As &s;oon as the natural gaiety and amiablene&s;s of the young man wears off, they have nothing left to recommend them, but <HI>lie by</HI> the re&s;t of their lives, among the lumber and refu&s;e of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens indeed, that for want of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">plying them&s;elves in due time to the pur&s;uits of knowledge, they take up a book in their declining years, and grow very hopeful &s;cholars by that time they are three&s;core. I mu&s;t therefore earne&s;tly pre&s;s my readers, who are in the flower of their youth, to labour at tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which may &s;et off their per&s;ons when their bloom is gone, and to <HI>lay in</HI> timely provi&s;ions for manhood and old age. In &s;hort, I would advi&s;e the youth of fifteen to be dre&s;&s;ing up
<PB N="2" REF="020531_0007_0FAFE319BB31B790">
every day the man of fifty; or to con&s;ider how to make him&s;elf venerable at three&s;core.</P>
<P N="3">3. Young men, who are naturally ambitious, would do well to ob&s;erve how the greate&s;t men of antiquity made it their ambition to excel all their cotempora|ries in knowledge. <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> the mo&s;t celebrated in&s;tances of human greatne&s;s, took a particular care to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by their &s;kill in the arts and &s;ciences. We have &s;till extant, &s;everal remains of the former, which ju&s;tify the charac|ter given of him by the learned men of his own age.</P>
<P N="4">4. As for the latter, it is a known &s;aying of his, that he was more obliged to <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who had in|&s;tructed him, than to <HI>Philip,</HI> who had given him life and empire. There is a letter of his recorded by <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Aulus Gellius,</HI> which he wrote to <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> upon hearing that he had publi&s;hed tho&s;e lectures he had given him in private. This letter was written in the following words, at a time when he was in the height of his <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> conque&s;ts:</P>
<P N="5">5. Alexander <HI>to</HI> Ari&s;totle, <HI>Greeting.</HI></P>
<P><Q>YOU have not done well to publi&s;h your books of &s;elect knowledge; for what is there now in which I can &s;urpa&s;s others, if tho&s;e things which I have been in&s;tructed in are communicated to every body? For my own part I declare to you, I would rather excel others in knowledge than power. <HI>Farewel.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="6">6. We &s;ee by this letter, that the love of conque&s;t was but the &s;econd ambition in <HI>Alexander</HI>'s &s;oul. Knowledge is indeed that, which, next to virtue, truly and e&s;&s;entially rai&s;es one man above another. It fini|&s;hes one half of the human &s;oul. It makes being plea|&s;ant to us, fills the mind with entertaining views, and admini&s;ters to it a perpetual &s;eries of gratifications.</P>
<P>It gives ea&s;e to &s;olitude, and graceful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s to re|tirement. It fills a public &s;tation with &s;uitable abi|lities, and adds a lu&s;tre to tho&s;e who are in the po&s;|&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="3" REF="020531_0008_0FAFE31A79278010">7. Learning, by which I mean all u&s;eful know|ledge, whether &s;peculative or practical, is in popular and mixt governments the natural &s;ource of wealth and honour. If we look into mo&s;t of the reigns from the conque&s;t, we &s;hall find, that the favourites of each reign have been tho&s;e who have rai&s;ed them&s;elves. The greate&s;t men are generally the growth of that particular age in which they flouri&s;h.</P>
<P N="8">8. A &s;uperior capacity for bu&s;ine&s;s, and a more exten&s;ive knowledge, are the &s;teps by which a new man often mounts to favour, and out&s;hines the re&s;t of his cotemporaries. But when men are actually born to titles, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould fail of receiving an additional greatne&s;s, if they take care to accompli&s;h them&s;elves for it.</P>
<P N="9">9. The &s;tory of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s choice, does not only in|&s;truct us in that point of hi&s;tory, but furni&s;hes out a very fine moral to us, namely, that he who applies his heart to wi&s;dom, does at the &s;ame time take the mo&s;t proper method for gaining long life, riches and reputation, which are very often not only the re|wards, but the effects of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="10">10. As it is very &s;uitable to my pre&s;ent &s;ubject, I &s;hall fir&s;t of all quote this pa&s;&s;age in the words of &s;a|cred writ, and afterwards mention an allegory, in which this whole pa&s;&s;age is repre&s;ented by a famous <HI>French</HI> Poet; not que&s;tioning but it will be very plea&s;ing to &s;uch of my readers as have a ta&s;te of fine writing.</P>
<P N="11">11. In <HI>Gibeon</HI> the Lord appeared to <HI>Solomon</HI> in a dream by night: and God &s;aid, "A&s;k what I &s;hall give thee." And <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;aid,
<Q>Thou ha&s;t &s;hewed unto thy &s;ervant <HI>David,</HI> my father, great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in uprightne&s;s of heart with thee, and thou ha&s;t kept for him this great kind|ne&s;s, that thou ha&s;t given him a &s;on to &s;it on his throne, as it is this day. And now, O Lord my God, thou ha&s;t made thy &s;ervant King in&s;tead of
<PB N="4" REF="020531_0009_0FAFE31B3A90BCA0">
<HI>David</HI> my father; and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.</Q></P>
<P N="12">12.
<Q>Give therefore thy &s;ervant an under&s;tanding heart to judge thy people, that I may di&s;cern be|tween good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy &s;o great a people?</Q>
And the &s;peech plea&s;ed the Lord, that <HI>Solomon</HI> had a&s;ked this thing. And God &s;aid unto him,
<Q>becau&s;e thou ha&s;t a&s;ked this thing, and ha&s;t not a&s;ked for thy&s;elf long life, nei|ther has a&s;ked riches for thy&s;elf, nor ha&s;t a&s;ked the life of thine enemies, but has a&s;ked for thy&s;elf un|der&s;tanding to di&s;cern judgment: behold I have done according to thy words, &s;o I have given thee a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding heart, &s;o that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee &s;hall any ari&s;e like unto thee.</Q></P>
<P N="13">13.
<Q>And I have al&s;o given thee that which thou ha&s;t not a&s;ked, both riches and honour, &s;o that there &s;hall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my &s;tatutes and my commandments as thy father <HI>David</HI> did walk, then I will lengthen thy days.</Q>
And <HI>Solomon</HI> awoke, and behold it was a dream.&mdash;</P>
<P N="14">14. The <HI>French</HI> poet has &s;hadowed this &s;tory in an allegory, of which he &s;eems to have taken the hint from the fable of the three godde&s;&s;es appearing to <HI>Paris,</HI> or rather from the vi&s;ion of <HI>Hercules,</HI> recorded by <HI>Xenophon,</HI> where <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI> are repre&s;ent|ed as real per&s;ons making their court to the hero with all their &s;everal charms and allurements.</P>
<P N="15">15. Health, wealth, victory and honour are intro|duced &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in their proper emblems and cha|racters, each of them &s;preading her temptations, and recommending her&s;elf to the young monarch's choice. Wi&s;dom enters la&s;t, and &s;o captivates him with her appearance, that he gives him&s;elf up to her. Upon which &s;he informs him, that tho&s;e who appeared be|fore her were nothing but her equipage, and that &s;ince
<PB N="5" REF="020531_0010_0FAFE31C9A920850">
he had placed his heart upon wi&s;dom, health, wealth, victory and honour &s;hould always wait on her as her handmaids.</P>

<HEAD>Directions how to &s;pend our Time.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE all of us complain of the &s;hortne&s;s of time, &s;aith <HI>Seneca,</HI> and yet have much more than we know what to do with. Our lives, &s;ays he, are &s;pent either in doing nothing at all, or in doing no|thing to the purpo&s;e, or in doing nothing that we ought to do: we are always complaining our days are few, and acting as though there would be no end of them. That noble philo&s;opher has de&s;cribed our incon&s;i&s;tency with our&s;elves in this particular, by all tho&s;e various turns of expre&s;&s;ion and thought which are peculiar to his writings.</P>
<P N="2">2. I often con&s;ider mankind as wholly incon&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf in a point that bears &s;ome affinity to the former. Though we &s;eem grieved at the &s;hortne&s;s of life in general, we are wi&s;hing every period of it at an end. The minor longs to be at age, then to be a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, then to make up an e&s;tate, then to arrive at honours, then to retire. Thus, although the whole of life is allowed by every one to be &s;hort, the &s;everal divi&s;ions of it appear long and tedious.</P>
<P N="3">3. We are for lengthening our &s;pan in general, but would fain contract the parts of which it is com|po&s;ed. The u&s;urer would be very well &s;atisfied to have all the time annihilated that lies between the pre&s;ent moment and next quarter day. The politi|cian would be contented to lo&s;e three years in his life, could he place things in the po&s;ture which he fancies they will &s;tand in after &s;uch a revolution of time.</P>
<P N="4">4. The lover would be glad to &s;trike out of his ex|i&s;tence all the moments that are to pa&s;s away before the happy meeting. Thus, as far as our time runs,
<PB N="6" REF="020531_0011_0FAFE31CF83A0B00">
we &s;hould be very glad in mo&s;t parts of our lives, that it ran much fa&s;ter than it does. Several hours of the day hang upon our hands, nay, we wi&s;h away whole years; and travel through time as through a country filled with many wild and empty wa&s;tes, which we would fain hurry over, that we may arrive at tho&s;e &s;everal little &s;ettlements or imaginary points of re&s;t, which are di&s;per&s;ed up and down in it.</P>
<P N="5">5. If we may divide the life of mo&s;t men into twenty parts, we &s;hall find, that at lea&s;t nineteen of them are mere gaps and cha&s;ms, which are neither filled with plea&s;ure nor bu&s;ine&s;s. I do not however include in this calculation the life of tho&s;e men who are in a perpetual hurry of affairs, but of tho&s;e only who are not always engaged in &s;cenes of action; and I hope I &s;hall not do an unacceptable piece of &s;ervice to the&s;e per&s;ons, if I point out to them certain methods for the filling up their empty &s;paces of life. The methods I &s;hall propo&s;e to them are as follow:</P>
<P N="6">6. The fir&s;t is the exerci&s;e of virtue, in the mo&s;t general acceptation of the word. That particular &s;cheme which comprehends the &s;ocial virtues, may give employment to the mo&s;t indu&s;trious temper, and find a man in bu&s;ine&s;s more than the mo&s;t active &s;ta|tion of life. To advi&s;e the ignorant, relieve the nee|dy, comfort the afflicted, are duties that fall in our way almo&s;t every day of our lives.</P>
<P N="7">7. A man has frequent opportunities of mitigating the fiercene&s;s of a party; of doing ju&s;tice to the cha|racter of a de&s;erving man; of &s;oftening the envious, quieting the angry, and rectifying the prejudiced; which are all of them employments &s;uited to a rea|&s;onable nature, and bring great &s;atisfaction to the per&s;on who can bu&s;y him&s;elf in them with di&s;cretion.</P>
<P N="8">8. There is another kind of virtue that may find employment for tho&s;e retired hours in which we are altogether left to our&s;elves and de&s;titute of company and conver&s;ation; I mean that intercour&s;e and com|munication which every rea&s;onable creature ought to maintain with the great Author of his being.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="7" REF="020531_0012_0FAFE31D798E44A8">9. The man who lives under an habitual &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence, keeps up a perpetual chearful|ne&s;s of temper, and enjoys every moment the &s;atisfac|tion of thinking him&s;elf in company with his dear|e&s;t and be&s;t of friends. The time never lies heavy upon him; it is impo&s;&s;ible for him to be alone.</P>
<P N="10">10. His thoughts and pa&s;&s;ions are the mo&s;t bu&s;ied at &s;uch hours when tho&s;e of other men are the mo&s;t unactive: he no &s;ooner &s;teps out of the world but his heart burns with devotion, &s;wells with hope, and triumphs in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of that pre&s;ence which every where &s;urrounds him; or, on the contrary, pours out its fears, its &s;orrows, its apprehen&s;ions, to the great &s;upporter of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="11">11. I have here only con&s;idered the nece&s;&s;ity of a man's being virtuous, that he may have &s;omething to do; but if we con&s;ider further, that the exerci&s;e of virtue is not only an amu&s;ement for the time it la&s;ts, but that its influence extends to tho&s;e parts of our ex|i&s;tence which lie beyond the grave, and that our whole eternity is to take its colour from tho&s;e hours which we here employ in virtue or in vice, the argument re|doubles upon us, for putting in practice this method of pa&s;&s;ing away our time.</P>
<P N="12">12. When a man has but a little &s;tock to improve, and has opportunities of turning it all to good account, what &s;hall we think of him if he &s;uffers nineteen parts of it to lie dead, and perhaps employs even the twentieth to his ruin or di&s;advantage? But becau&s;e the mind cannot be always in its fervour nor &s;trained up to a pitch of virtue, it is nece&s;&s;ary to find out pro|per employments for it in its relaxations.</P>
<P N="13">13. The next method therefore that I would propo&s;e to fill up our time, &s;hould be u&s;eful and innocent di|ver&s;ion. I mu&s;t confe&s;s I think it is below rea&s;onable creatures to be altogether conver&s;ant in &s;uch diver&s;i|ons as are merely innocent, and having nothing el&s;e to recommend them but that there is no hurt in them.</P>
<P N="14">14. Whether any kind of gaming has even thus
<PB N="8" REF="020531_0013_0FAFE31E3B8D21E8">
much to &s;ay for it&s;elf, I &s;hall not determine; but I think it is very wonderful to &s;ee per&s;ons of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e, pa&s;&s;ing away a dozen hours together in &s;huffling and dividing a pack of cards, with no other conver&s;a|tion but what is made up of a few game phra&s;es, and no other ideas but tho&s;e of black or red &s;pots ranged together in different figures. Would not a man laugh to hear any one of his &s;pecies complaining that life is &s;hort?</P>
<P N="15">15. The &s;tage might be made a perpetual &s;ource of the mo&s;t noble and u&s;eful entertainments, were it under proper regulations.</P>
<P>But the mind never unbends it&s;elf &s;o agreeably as in the conver&s;ation of a well-cho&s;en friend. There is indeed no ble&s;&s;ing of life that is any way comparable to the enjoyment of a di&s;creet and virtuous friend. It ea&s;es and unloads the mind, clears and improves the under&s;tanding, engenders thoughts and know|ledge, animates virtue and good re&s;olution, &s;ooths and allays the pa&s;&s;ions, and finds employment for mo&s;t of the vacant hours of life.</P>
<P N="16">16. Next to &s;uch an intimacy with a particular per&s;on, one would endeavour after a more general conver&s;ation with &s;uch as are able to entertain and improve tho&s;e with whom they conver&s;e, which are qualifications that &s;eldom go a&s;under.</P>
<P>There are many other u&s;eful amu&s;ements of life, which one would endeavour to multiply, that one might on all occa&s;ions have recour&s;e to &s;omething rather than &s;uffer the mind to lie idle, or run adrift with any pa&s;&s;ion that chances to ri&s;e in it.</P>
<P N="17">17. A man that has a ta&s;te in mu&s;ic, painting, or architecture, is like one that has another &s;en&s;e when compared with &s;uch as have no reli&s;h of tho&s;e arts. The flori&s;t, the planter, the gardener, the hu&s;band|man, when they are only as accompli&s;hments to the man of fortune, are great reliefs to a country life, and many ways u&s;eful to tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them.</P>
<BIBL>SPECTATOR, No. 93.</BIBL>
<P N="18"><PB N="9" REF="020531_0014_0FAFE31EFB6811A0">18. I WAS ye&s;terday bu&s;y in comparing together the indu&s;try of man with that of other crea|tures; in which I could not but ob&s;erve, that not|with&s;tanding we are obliged by duty to keep our|&s;elves in con&s;tant employ, after the &s;ame manner as inferior animals are prompted to it by in&s;tinct, we fall very &s;hort of them in this particular.</P>
<P N="19">19. We are here the more inexcu&s;able, becau&s;e there is a greater variety of bu&s;ine&s;s to which we may apply our&s;elves. Rea&s;on opens to us a large field of affairs, which other creatures are not capable of. Bea&s;ts of prey, and I believe all other kinds, in their natural &s;tate of being, divide their time between action and re&s;t. They are always at work or a&s;leep. In &s;hort, their awaking hours are wholly taken up in &s;eeking after their food, or in con&s;uming it.</P>
<P N="20">20. The human &s;pecies only, to the great reproach of our natures, are filled with complaints, That the day hangs heavy on them, that they do not know what to do with them&s;elves, that they are at a lo&s;s how to pa&s;s away their time, with many of the like &s;hameful murmurs, which we often find in the mouth of tho&s;e who are &s;tiled rea&s;onable beings.</P>
<P N="21">21. How mon&s;trous are &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions among creatures, who have the labours of the mind, as well as tho&s;e of the body, to furni&s;h them with proper employ|ments; who, be&s;ides the bu&s;ine&s;s of their proper callings and profe&s;&s;ions, can apply them&s;elves to the duties of religion, to meditation, to the reading of u&s;eful books, to di&s;cour&s;e; in a word, who may exer|ci&s;e them&s;elves in the unbounded pur&s;uits of know|ledge and virtue, and every hour of their lives make them&s;elves wi&s;er or better than they were before.</P>
<P N="22">22. After having been taken up for &s;ome time in this cour&s;e of thought, I diverted my&s;elf with a book, according to my u&s;ual cu&s;tom, in order to unbend my mind before I went to &s;leep. The book I made u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion was <HI>Lucian,</HI> where I amu&s;ed my thoughts for about an hour among the dialogues of
<PB N="10" REF="020531_0015_0FAFE31FBB0B7A80">
the dead, which in all probability produced the fol|lowing dream.</P>
<P N="23">23. I was conveyed, methought, into the entrance of the infernal regions, where I &s;aw <HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> one of the judges of the dead, &s;eated in his tribunal. On his left hand &s;tood the keeper of <HI>Erebus,</HI> on his right the keeper of <HI>Ely&s;ium.</HI> I was told he &s;at upon women that day, there being &s;everal of the &s;ex lately arrived, who had not yet their man&s;ions a&s;&s;igned them.</P>
<P N="24">24. I was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear him a&s;k every one of them the &s;ame que&s;tion, namely, What they had been doing? Upon this que&s;tion being propo&s;ed to the whole a&s;&s;embly, they &s;tared upon one another, as no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> knowing what to an&s;wer. He then interrogated each of them &s;eparately. Madam, &s;ays he, to the fir&s;t of them, you have been upon the earth about fifty years: What have you been doing there all this while? Doing, &s;ays &s;he, really I do not know what I have been doing: I de&s;ire I may have time given me to recollect.</P>
<P N="25">25. After about half an hour's pau&s;e, &s;he told him, that &s;he had been playing at crimp; upon which <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> beckoned to the keeper on his left hand, to take her into cu&s;tody. And you, Madam, &s;ays the judge, that look with &s;uch a &s;oft and langui&s;hing air; I think you &s;et out for this place in your nine and twentieth year; what have you been doing all this while? I had a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s on my hands, &s;ays &s;he, being taken up the fir&s;t twelve years of my life, in dre&s;&s;ing a jointed baby, and all the remain|ing part of it in reading plays and romances.</P>
<P N="26">26. Very well, &s;ays he, you have employed your time to good purpo&s;e. Away with her. The next was a plain country woman: Well, mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ays <HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> and what have you been doing? An't plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, &s;ays &s;he, I did not live quite forty years; and in that time brought my hu&s;band &s;even daughters, made him nine thou&s;and chee&s;es,
<PB N="11" REF="020531_0016_0FAFE3207B44D230">
and left my elde&s;t girl with him, to look after his hou&s;e in my ab&s;ence, and who, I may venture to &s;ay, is as pretty a hou&s;ewife as any in the country.</P>
<P N="27">27. <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> &s;miled at the &s;implicity of the good woman, and ordered the keeper of <HI>Ely&s;ium</HI> to take her into his care. And you, fair lady, &s;ays he, what have you been doing the&s;e five and thirty years? I have been doing no hurt, I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;ir, &s;aid &s;he. That is well, &s;ays he, but what good have you been doing? The lady was in great confu&s;ion at this que&s;tion, and not knowing what to an&s;wer, the two keepers leaped out to &s;eize her at the &s;ame time; the one took her by the hand to convey her to <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> the other caught hold of her to carry her away to <HI>Erebus.</HI></P>
<P N="28">28. But <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> ob&s;erving an ingenuous mode&s;ty in her countenance and behaviour, bid them both let her loo&s;e, and &s;et her a&s;ide for a re-examina|tion when he was more at lei&s;ure. An old woman, of a proud and &s;our look, pre&s;ented her&s;elf next at the bar, and being a&s;ked what &s;he had been doing? Truly, &s;ays &s;he, I lived three &s;core and ten years in a very wicked world, and was &s;o angry at the beha|viour of a parcel of young flirts, that I pa&s;t mo&s;t of my la&s;t years in condemning the follies of the times.</P>
<P N="29">29. I was every day blaming the &s;illy conduct of people about me, in order to deter tho&s;e I conver&s;ed with from falling into the like errors and mi&s;carriages. Very well, &s;ays <HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> but did you keep the &s;ame watchful eye over your own actions? Why tru|ly, &s;ays &s;he, I was &s;o taken up with publi&s;hing the faults of others, that I had no time to con&s;ider my own.</P>
<P N="30">30. Madam, &s;ays <HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> be plea&s;ed to file off to the left, and make room for the venerable ma|tron that &s;tands behind you. Old gentlewoman, &s;ays he, I think you are four &s;core? You have heard the que&s;tion, what have you been doing &s;o long in the world? Ah! &s;ir, &s;ays &s;he, I have been doing what I &s;hould not have done, but I had made a firm re&s;olu|tion to have changed my life, if I had not been &s;natch|ed off by an untimely end.</P>
<P N="31"><PB N="12" REF="020531_0017_0FAFE3213B0C45A0">31. Madam, &s;ays he, you will plea&s;e to follow your leader; and &s;pying another of the &s;ame age, interro|gated her in the &s;ame form. To which the matron replied, I have been the wife of a hu&s;band who was as dear to me in his old age as in his youth. I have been a mother, and very happy in my children, whom I endeavoured to bring up in every thing that is good.</P>
<P N="32">32. My elde&s;t &s;on is ble&s;t by the poor, and beloved by every one that knows him. I lived within my own family, and left it much more wealthy than I found it. <HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> who knew the value of the old lady, &s;miled upon her in &s;uch a manner, that the keeper of <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> who knew his office, reached out his hand to her. He no &s;ooner touched her but her wrinkles vani&s;hed, her eyes &s;parkled, her cheeks glow|ed with blu&s;hes, and &s;he appeared in full bloom and beauty.</P>
<P N="33">33. A young woman ob&s;erving that this officer, who conducted the happy to <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> was &s;o great a <HI>beautifier,</HI> longed to be in his hands, &s;o that pre&s;&s;ing through the croud, &s;he was the next that appeared at the bar. And being a&s;ked what &s;he had been doing the five and twenty years that &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed in the world, I have endeavoured, &s;ays &s;he, ever &s;ince I came to years of di&s;cretion, to make my&s;elf lovely, and gain admirers.</P>
<P N="34">34. In order to it I pa&s;s my time in bottling up May-dew, inventing white-wa&s;hes, mixing colours, cutting out patches, con&s;ulting my gla&s;s, &s;uiting my complexion, tearing off my tucker, &s;inking my &s;tays. &mdash;<HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> without hearing her out, gave the &s;ign to take her off. Upon the approach of the keeper of <HI>Erebus</HI> her colour faded, her face was puckered up with wrinkles, and her whole per&s;on lo&s;t in deformity.</P>
<P N="35">35. I was then &s;urpri&s;ed with a di&s;tant &s;ound of a whole troop of females that came forward laughing, &s;inging, and dancing. I was very de&s;irous to know the reception they would meet with, and withal was
<PB N="13" REF="020531_0018_0FAFE321FAB0DB48">
very apprehen&s;ive, that <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> would &s;poil their mirth: but at their nearer approach the noi&s;e grew &s;o very great that it awakened me.</P>
<P N="36">36. Employment of time is a &s;ubject that, from its importance, de&s;erves your be&s;t attention. Mo&s;t young gentlemen have a great deal of time before them, and one hour well employed, in the early part of life, is more valuable and will be of greater u&s;e to you, than perhaps four and twenty, &s;ome years to come.</P>
<P N="37">37. Whatever time you can &s;teal from company and from the &s;tudy of the world (I &s;ay company, for a knowledge of life is be&s;t learned in various compa|nies) employ it in &s;erious reading. Take up &s;ome valuable book, and continue the reading of that book till you have got through it; never burden your mind with more than one thing at a time: and in reading this book don't run it over &s;uperficially, but read every pa&s;&s;age twice over, at lea&s;t do not pa&s;s on to a &s;econd till you thoroughly under&s;tand the fir&s;t, nor quit the book till you are ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject; for unle&s;s you do this, you may read it through, and not remember the contents of it for a week.</P>
<P N="38">38. The books I would particularly recommend, are <HI>Cardinal Retz's maxims, Rochefoucault's moral re|flections, Bruyere's characters, Fontenelle's plurality of worlds, Sir Jo&s;iah Child on trade, Bolingbroke's works</HI>; for &s;tyle, his <HI>Remarks on the Hi&s;tory of England,</HI> under the name of Sir John Oldca&s;tle; <HI>Puffendorff's Jus Gentium,</HI> and <HI>Grotius de Jure Belli et Pacis:</HI> the la&s;t two are well tran&s;lated by <HI>Barbeyrac.</HI> For occa|&s;ional half hours or le&s;s, read the be&s;t works of inven|tion, wit and humour; but never wa&s;te your minutes on trifling authors, either ancient or modern.</P>
<P N="39">39. Any bu&s;ine&s;s you may have to tran&s;act, &s;hould be done the fir&s;t opportunity, and fini&s;hed, if po&s;&s;ible, without interruption; for by deferring it, we may probably fini&s;h it too late, or execute it indifferently. Now, bu&s;ine&s;s of any kind &s;hould never be done by
<PB N="14" REF="020531_0019_0FAFE322BA34AE38">
halves, but every part of it &s;hould be well attended to: for he that does bu&s;ine&s;s ill, had better not do it at all. And, in any point which di&s;cretion bids you pur&s;ue, and which has a manife&s;t utility to recom|mend it, let not difficulties deter you; rather let them animate your indu&s;try. If one method fails, try a &s;econd and a third. Be active, per&s;evere, and you will certainly conquer.</P>
<P N="40">40. Never indulge a lazy di&s;po&s;ition: there are few things but are attended with &s;ome difficulties, and if you are frightened at tho&s;e difficulties, you will not complete any thing. Indolent minds prefer ig|norance to trouble; they look upon mo&s;t things as impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e perhaps they are difficult Even an hour's attention is too laborious for them, and they would rather content them&s;elves with the fir&s;t view of things than take the trouble to look any farther into them. Thus, when they come to talk upon &s;ub|jects to tho&s;e who have &s;tudied them, they betray an unpardonable ignorance, and lay them&s;elves open to an&s;wers that confu&s;e them. Be careful then, that you do not get the appellation of indolent; and, if po&s;&s;ible, avoid the character of frivolous. For,</P>
<P N="41">41. The frivolous mind is bu&s;ied always upon no|thing. It mi&s;takes trifling objects for important ones, and &s;pends that time upon little matters, that &s;hould only be be&s;towed upon great ones. Knick-knacks, butterflies, &s;hells, and &s;uch like, engro&s;s the atten|tion of the frivolous man, and fill up all his time. He &s;tudies the dre&s;s and not the characters of men, and his &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation are no other than the weather, his own dome&s;tic affairs, his &s;ervants, his method of managing his family, the little anecdotes of the neighbourhood, and the fiddle-faddle &s;tories of the day; void of information, void of improvement. The&s;e he relates with empha&s;is, as intere&s;ting mat|ters; in &s;hort he is a male go&s;&s;ip. I appeal to your own feelings now, whether &s;uch things do not le&s;&s;en a man, in the opinion of his acquaintance, and in|&s;tead of attracting e&s;teem, create di&s;gu&s;t?</P>

<P>MODESTY is the citadel of beauty and vir|tue. The fir&s;t of all virtues is innocence; the &s;econd is mode&s;ty.</P>
<P N="1">1. Mode&s;ty is both in its &s;ource, and in its con&s;e|quence, a very great happine&s;s to the fair po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it; it ari&s;es from a fear of di&s;honour, and a good con|&s;cience, and is followed immediately, upon its fir&s;t appearance, with the reward of honour and e&s;teem, paid by all tho&s;e who di&s;cover it in any body living.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is indeed, a virtue in a woman (that might otherwi&s;e be very di&s;agreeable to one) &s;o exqui&s;itely delicate, that it excites in any beholder, of a gene|rous and manly di&s;po&s;ition, almo&s;t all the pa&s;&s;ions, that he would be apt to conceive for the mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart, in variety of circum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="3">3. A woman that is mode&s;t creates in us an awe in her company, a wi&s;h for her welfare, a joy in her be|ing actually happy, a &s;ore and painful &s;orrow if di&s;tre&s;s &s;hould come upon her, a ready and willing heart to give her con&s;olation, and a compa&s;&s;ionate temper to|wards her, in every little accident of life &s;he under|goes; and, to &s;um up all in one word, it cau&s;es &s;uch a kind of angellical love, even to a &s;tranger, as good-natured brothers and &s;i&s;ters u&s;ually bear towards one another.</P>
<P N="4">4. It adds wonderfully to the make of a face: and I have &s;een a pretty well turned forehead, fine &s;et eyes, and, what your poets call, a row of pearl &s;et in coral, &s;hewn by a pretty expan&s;ion of two velvet lips that covered them (that would have tempted any &s;o|ber man living of my own age, to have been a little loo&s;e in his thoughts, and to have enjoyed a painful plea&s;ure amid&s;t his impotency) lo&s;e all their virtue, all their force and efficacy, by having an ugly ca&s;t of

<P N="5">5. At the &s;ame time mode&s;ty will fill up the wrin|kles of old age with glory; make &s;ixty blu&s;h it&s;elf into &s;ixteen; and help a green-&s;ick girl to defeat the &s;atyr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a fal&s;e waggi&s;h lover, who might compare her colour, when &s;he looked like a gho&s;t, to the blow|ing of the ro&s;e-bud, by blu&s;hing her&s;elf into a bloom of beauty; and might make what he meant a reflec|tion, a real compliment, at any hour of the day, in &s;pite of his teeth. It has a prevailing power with me, whenever I find it in the &s;ex.</P>
<P N="6">6. I, who have the common fault of old men, to be very &s;our and humour&s;ome, when I drink my wa|ter gruel in a morning, fell into a more than ordina|ry pet with a maid, whom I call my nur&s;e, from a con&s;tant tenderne&s;s, that I have ob&s;erved her to exer|ci&s;e towards me beyond all my other &s;ervants; I per|ceived her flu&s;h and glow in the face, in a manner which I could plainly di&s;cern proceeded not from an|ger or re&s;entment of my correction, but from a good-natured regret, upon a fear that &s;he had offended her grave old ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="7">7. I was &s;o heartily plea&s;ed, that I ea&s;ed her of the hone&s;t trouble &s;he underwent inwardly for my &s;ake; and, giving her half a crown, I told her it was a for|feit due to her becau&s;e I was out of humour with her without any rea&s;on at all. And as &s;he is &s;o gentle|hearted, I have diligently avoided giving her one har&s;h word ever &s;ince; and I find my own reward in it; for not being &s;o te&s;ty as I u&s;ed, has made me much haler and &s;tronger than I was before.</P>
<P N="8">8. The pretty, and witty, and virtuous <HI>Simplicia,</HI> was, the other day, vi&s;iting with an old aunt of her's, that I verily believed has read the <HI>Atalantis:</HI> &s;he took a &s;tory out there, and dre&s;&s;ed up an old hone&s;t neighbour in the &s;econd-hand cloaths of &s;candal. The young creature hid her face with her fan at every bur&s;t and peal of laughter, and blu&s;hed for her guilty

parent; by which &s;he atoned, methought, for every &s;candal that ran round the beautiful circle.</P>
<P N="9">9. As I was going home to bed that evening, I could not help thinking of her all the way I went. I repre&s;ented her to my&s;elf as &s;hedding holy blood eve|ry time &s;he blu&s;hed, and as being a martyr in the cau&s;e of virtue. And afterwards, when I was putting on my night-cap, I could not drive the thought out of my head, but that I was young enough to have a child by her; and that it would be an addition to the reputation I have in the &s;tudy of wi&s;dom to marry to &s;o much youth and mode&s;ty, even in my old age.</P>
<P N="10">10. I know there have not been wanting many wicked objections again&s;t this virtue; one is grown in&s;ufferably common, The fellow blu&s;hes, he is guilty. I &s;hould &s;ay rather, He blu&s;hes, therefore he is in|nocent. I believe the &s;ame man, that fir&s;t had that wicked imagination of a blu&s;h being the &s;ign of guilt, repre&s;ented good-nature to be folly; and that he him&s;elf, was the mo&s;t inhuman and impudent wretch alive.</P>
<P N="11">11. The author of <HI>Cato,</HI> who is known to be one of the mo&s;t mode&s;t, and mo&s;t ingenious per&s;ons of the age we now live in, has given this virtue a de|licate name, in the tragedy of <HI>Cato,</HI> where the cha|racter of <HI>Marcia</HI> is fir&s;t opened to us. I would have all ladies who have a mind to be thought well-bred, to think &s;eriou&s;ly on this virtue, which he &s;o beauti|fully calls the &s;anctity of manners.</P>
<P N="12">12. Mode&s;ty is a polite accompli&s;hment, and ge|nerally an attendant upon merit. It is engaging to the highe&s;t degree, and wins the hearts of all our acquaintance. On the contrary, none are more di&s;|gu&s;tful in company than the impudent and pre&s;uming.</P>
<P>The man who is, on all occa&s;ions, commending and &s;peaking well of him&s;elf, we naturally di&s;like. On the other hand, he who &s;tudies to conceal his own de&s;erts, who does ju&s;tice to the merit of others, who talks but little of him&s;elf, and that with mode&s;ty
<PB N="18" REF="020531_0023_0FAFE325C1AEAA00">
makes a favourable impre&s;&s;ion on the per&s;ons he is conver&s;ing with, captivates their minds, and gains their e&s;teem.</P>
<P N="13">13. Mode&s;ty, however, widely differs from an aukward ba&s;hfulne&s;s, which is as much to be con|demned as the other is to be applauded. To appear &s;imple is as ill-bred as to be impudent. A young man ought to be able to come into a room and ad|dre&s;s the company without the lea&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment. To be out of countenance when &s;poken to, and not to have an an&s;wer ready, is ridiculous to the la&s;t degree.</P>
<P N="14">14. An aukward country fellow, when he comes into company better than him&s;elf, is exceedingly di&s;|concerted. He knows not what to do with his hands or his hat, but either puts one of them in his pocket, and dangles the other by his &s;ide; or perhaps twirls his hat on his fingers, or fumbles with the button. If &s;poken to he is in a much wor&s;e &s;ituation, he an|&s;wers with the utmo&s;t difficulty, and nearly &s;tammers; whereas a gentleman, who is acquainted with life, enters a room with gracefulne&s;s and a mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance addre&s;&s;es even per&s;ons he does not know, in an ea&s;y and natural manner, and without the lea&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P N="15">15. This is the characteri&s;tic of good-breeding, a very nece&s;&s;ary knowledge in our intercour&s;e with men: for one of inferior parts, with the behaviour of a gentleman, is frequently better received than a man of &s;en&s;e, with the addre&s;s and manners of a clown. Ignorance and vice are the only things we need be a&s;hamed of; &s;teer clear of the&s;e, and you may go into any company you will: not that I would have a young man throw off all dread of appearing abroad, as a fear of offending, or being di&s;e&s;teemed, will make him pre&s;erve a proper decorum.</P>
<P N="16">16. Some per&s;ons, from experiencing of fal&s;e mo|de&s;ty, have run into the other extreme, and acquired the character of impudent. This is as great a fault as the other. A well-bred man keeps him&s;elf with|in
<PB N="19" REF="020531_0024_0FAFE32678FB7E70">
in the two, and &s;teers the middle way. He is ea&s;y and firm in every company; is mode&s;t, but not ba&s;h|ful; &s;teady, but not impudent. He copies the man|ners of the better people, and conforms to their cu&s;|toms with ea&s;e and attention.</P>
<P N="17">17. Till we can pre&s;ent our&s;elves in all companies with coolne&s;s and unconcern, we can never pre&s;ent our&s;elves well: nor will a man ever be &s;uppo&s;ed to have kept good company, or ever be acceptable in &s;uch Company, if he cannot appear there ea&s;y and unembarra&s;&s;ed. A mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance, in every part of life, is the mo&s;t advantageous qualification we can po&s;&s;ibly acquire.</P>
<P N="18">18. In&s;tead of becoming in&s;olent, a man of &s;en&s;e, under a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of merit, is more mode&s;t. He behaves him&s;elf indeed with firmne&s;s, but without the lea&s;t pre&s;umption. The man who is ignorant of his own merit, is no le&s;s a fool than he who is con|&s;tantly di&s;playing it. A man of under&s;tanding avails him&s;elf of his abilities, but never boa&s;ts of them; whereas the timid and ba&s;hful can never pu&s;h him&s;elf in life, be his merit as great as it will; he will be always kept behind by the forward and the bu&s;tling.</P>
<P N="19">19. A man of abilities, and acquainted with life, will &s;tand as firm in defence of his own rights, and pur&s;ue his plans as &s;teadily and unmoved as the mo&s;t impudent man alive; but then he does it with a &s;eem|ing mode&s;ty. Thus, manner is every thing; what is impudence in one is proper a&s;&s;urance only in ano|ther; for firmne&s;s is commendable, but an overbear|ing conduct is di&s;gu&s;tful.</P>
<P N="20">20. Forwardne&s;s being the very rever&s;e of mode&s;ty, follow rather than lead the company; that is, join in di&s;cour&s;e upon their &s;ubjects rather than &s;tart one of your own; if you have parts, you will have opportu|nities enough of &s;hewing them on every topic of con|ver&s;ation, and if you have none, it is better to expo&s;e your&s;elf upon a &s;ubject of other people's, than on one of your own.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="20" REF="020531_0025_0FAFE327D62C8768">21. But be particularly careful not to &s;peak of your&s;elf, if you can help it. An impudent fellow lugs in him&s;elf abruptly upon all occa&s;ions, and is ever the hero of his own &s;tory. Others will colour their arrogance with,
<Q>It may &s;eem &s;trange indeed, that I &s;hould talk in this manner of my&s;elf; it is what I by no means like, and &s;hould never do, if I had not been cruelly and unju&s;tly accu&s;ed; but when my character is attacked, it is a ju&s;tice I owe to my&s;elf to defend it.</Q>
This veil is too thin not to be &s;een through on the fir&s;t in&s;pection.</P>
<P N="22">22. Others again, with more art, will <HI>mode&s;tly</HI> boa&s;t of all the principal virtues, by calling the&s;e virtues weakne&s;&s;es, and &s;aying, they are &s;o unfortu|nate as to fall into tho&s;e weakne&s;&s;es. "I cannot &s;ee per&s;ons &s;uffer," &s;ays one of this ca&s;t, "without relie|ving them; though my circum&s;tances are very unable to afford it."&mdash;
<Q>I cannot avoid &s;peaking truth; though it is often very imprudent;</Q>
and &s;o on.</P>
<P N="23">23. this angling for prai&s;e is &s;o prevailing a prin|ciple, that it frequently &s;toops to the lowe&s;t objects. Men will often boa&s;t of doing that which, if true, would be rather a di&s;grace to them than otherwi&s;e. One man affirms that he rode twenty miles within the hour: 'tis probably a lie; but &s;uppo&s;e he did, what then? He had a good hor&s;e under him, and is a good jockey. Another &s;wears he has often at a &s;itting, drank five or &s;ix bottles to his own &s;hare. Out of re&s;pect to him, I will believe <HI>him</HI> a liar; for I would not wi&s;h to think him a bea&s;t.</P>
<P N="24">24. The&s;e and many more are the follies of idle people, which, while they think they procure them e&s;teem, in reality make them de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>To avoid this contempt, therefore, never &s;peak of your&s;elf at all, unle&s;s nece&s;&s;ity obliges you; and even then, take care to do it in &s;uch a manner, that it may not be con&s;trued into fi&s;hing for applau&s;e. Whatever perfections you may have, be a&s;&s;ured, people will find them out; but whether they do or

not, nobody will take them upon your own word. The le&s;s you &s;ay of your&s;elf, the more the world will give you credit for; and the more you &s;ay the le&s;s they will believe you.</P>

<HEAD>Affectation.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A LATE conver&s;ation which I fell into, gave me an opportunity of ob&s;erving a great deal of beauty in a very hand&s;ome woman, and as much wit in an ingenious man, turned into deformity in the one, and ab&s;urdity in the other, by the mere force of affectation. The fair one had &s;omething in her per&s;on upon which her thoughts were fixed, that &s;he attempted to &s;hew to advantage in every look, word, and ge&s;ture.</P>
<P N="2">2. The gentleman was as diligent to do ju&s;tice to his fine parts, as the lady to her beauteous form: you might &s;ee his imagination on the &s;tretch to find out &s;omething uncommon, and what they call bright, to entertain her; while &s;he writhed her&s;elf into as many different po&s;tures to engage him. When &s;he laughed, her lips were to &s;ever at a greater di&s;tance than ordi|nary to &s;hew her teeth.</P>
<P N="3">3. Her fan was to point to &s;omewhat at a di&s;tance, that in the reach &s;he may di&s;cover the roundne&s;s of her arm; then &s;he is utterly mi&s;taken in what &s;he &s;aw, falls back, &s;miles at her own folly, and is &s;o wholly di&s;compo&s;ed, that her tucker is to be adju&s;ted, her bo&s;om expo&s;ed, and the whole woman put into new airs and graces.</P>
<P N="4">4. While &s;he was doing all this, the gallant had time to think of &s;omething very plea&s;ant to &s;ay next to her, or make &s;ome unkind ob&s;ervation on &s;ome other lady to feed her vanity The&s;e unhappy ef|fects of affectation naturally led me to look into that &s;trange &s;tate of mind, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o generally di&s;colours the behaviour of mo&s;t people we met with.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="22" REF="020531_0027_0FAFE328C03A0390">5. The learned Dr. <HI>Burnet,</HI> in his Theory of the Earth, takes occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, That every thought is attended with con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and repre&s;entativene&s;s; the mind has nothing pre&s;ented to it, but what is immediately followed by a reflection of con&s;cience, which tells you whether that which was &s;o pre&s;ented is graceful or unbecoming.</P>
<P N="6">6. This act of the mind di&s;covers it&s;elf in the ge&s;|ture, by a proper behaviour in tho&s;e who&s;e con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s goes no farther than to direct them in the ju&s;t progre&s;s of their pre&s;ent thought or action; but be|trays an interruption in every &s;econd thought, when the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is employed in too fondly approving a man's own conceptions; which &s;ort of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is what we call affectation.</P>
<P N="7">7. As the love of prai&s;e is implanted in our bo&s;oms as a &s;trong incentive to worthy actions, it is a very difficult ta&s;k to get above a de&s;ire of it for things that &s;hould be wholly indifferent. Women, who&s;e hearts are fixed upon the plea&s;ure they have in the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s that they are the objects of love and admiration, are ever changing the air of their countenances, and altering the attitude of their bodies, to &s;trike the hearts of their beholders with a new &s;en&s;e of their beauty.</P>
<P N="8">8. The dre&s;&s;ing part of our &s;ex, who&s;e minds are the &s;ame with the &s;illier part of the other, are exactly in the like unea&s;y condition to be regarded for a well-tied cravat, an hat cocked with an unu&s;ual bri&s;kne&s;s, a very well-cho&s;en coat, or other in&s;tances of merit, which they are impatient to &s;ee unob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="9">9. But this apparent affectation, ari&s;ing from an ill governed con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, is not &s;o much to be won|dered at in &s;uch loo&s;e and trivial minds as the&s;e. But when you &s;ee it reign in characters of worth and di&s;|tinction, it is what you cannot but lament, not with|out &s;ome indigna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion. It creeps into the heart of the wi&s;e man, as well as that of the coxcomb.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="23" REF="020531_0028_0FAFE32984F72228">10. When you &s;ee a man of &s;en&s;e look about for applau&s;e, and di&s;cover an itching inclination to be commended; lay traps for a little incen&s;e, even from tho&s;e who&s;e opinion he values in nothing but his own favour; who is &s;afe again&s;t this weakne&s;s? or who knows whether he is guilty of it or not? The be&s;t way to get clear of &s;uch a light fondne&s;s for applau&s;e, is, to take all po&s;&s;ible care to throw off the love of it upon occa&s;ions that are not in them&s;elves laudable; but, as it appears, we hope for no prai&s;e from them.</P>
<P N="11">11. Of this nature are all graces in mens per&s;ons, dre&s;s, and bodily deportment; which will naturally be winning and attractive if we think not of them, but lo&s;e their force in proportion to our endeavour to make them &s;uch.</P>
<P>When our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s turns upon the main de&s;ign of life, and our thoughts are employed upon the chief purpo&s;e either in bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure, we &s;hould never betray an affectation, for we cannot be guilty of it: but when we give the pa&s;&s;ion for prai&s;e an un|bridled liberty, our plea&s;ure in little perfections robs us of what is due to us for great virtues and worthy qualities.</P>
<P N="12">12. How many excellent &s;peeches and hone&s;t ac|tions are lo&s;t, for want of being indifferent where we ought! Men are oppre&s;&s;ed with regard to their way of &s;peaking and acting, in&s;tead of having their thoughts bent upon what they &s;hould do or &s;ay; and by that means b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry a capacity for great things, by their fear of &s;ailing in indifferent things. This, perhaps, cannot be called affectation; but it has &s;ome tincture of it, at lea&s;t &s;o far, as that their fear of erring in a thing of no con&s;equence argues they would be too much plea&s;ed in performing it.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is only from a thorough di&s;regard to him&s;elf in &s;uch particulars, that a man can act with a lauda|ble &s;ufficiency; his heart is fixed upon one point in view; and he commits no errors, becau&s;e he thinks nothing an error but what deviates from that intention.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="020531_0029_0FAFE32A3B35AF30">The wild havock affectation makes in that part of the world which &s;hould be mo&s;t polite, is vi&s;ible wherever we turn our eyes: it pu&s;hes men not only into impertinences in conver&s;ation, but al&s;o in their premeditated &s;peeches.</P>

<BIBL>SPECTATOR, Vol. I. No. 38.</BIBL>
<P N="19">19. NATURE does nothing in vain; the Creator of the univer&s;e has appointed every thing to a certain u&s;e and purpo&s;e, and determined it to a &s;ettled cour&s;e and &s;phere of action, from which, if it in the lea&s;t deviates, it becomes unfit to an&s;wer tho&s;e ends for which it was de&s;igned.</P>
<P N="20">20. In like manner it is in the di&s;po&s;itions of &s;oci|ety: the civil oeconomy is formed in a chain as well as the natural; and in either ca&s;e the breach but of one link puts the whole in &s;ome di&s;order. It is, I think, pretty plain, that mo&s;t of the ab&s;urdity and ridicule we meet with in the world, is generally owing to the impertinent affectation of excelling in characters men are not fit for, and for which nature never de&s;igned them.</P>
<P N="21">21. Every man has one or more qualities which may make him u&s;eful both to him&s;elf and others: Nature never fails of pointing them out, and while the infant continues under her guardian&s;hip, &s;he brings him on in his way, and then offers her&s;elf for a guide <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> what remains of the journey; if he pro|ceeds in that cour&s;e, he can hardly mi&s;carry: Nature

makes good her engagements; for as &s;he never pro|mi&s;es what &s;he is not able to perform, &s;o &s;he never fails of performing what &s;he promi&s;es.</P>
<P N="22">22. But the misfortune is, men de&s;pi&s;e what they may be ma&s;ters of, and affect what they are not fit for; they reckon them&s;elves already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of what their genius inclines them to, and &s;o bend all their ambition to excel in what is out of their reach: thus they de&s;troy the u&s;e of their natural talents, in the &s;ame manner as covetous men do their quiet and re|po&s;e; they can enjoy no &s;atisfaction in what they have, becau&s;e of the ab&s;urd inclination they are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with for what they have not.</P>
<P N="23">23. <HI>Cleanthes</HI> had good &s;en&s;e, a great memory, and a con&s;titution capable of the clo&s;e&s;t application: in a word, there was no profe&s;&s;ion in which <HI>Cleanthes</HI> might not have made a very good figure; but this won't &s;a|tisfy him; he takes up an unaccountable fondne&s;s for the character of a fine gentleman; all his thoughts are bent upon this, in&s;tead of attending a di&s;&s;ection, frequenting the courts of ju&s;tice, or &s;tudying the fa|thers.</P>
<P N="24">24. <HI>Cleanthes</HI> reads plays, dances, dre&s;&s;es, and &s;pends his time in drawing-rooms, in&s;tead of being a good lawyer, divine, or phy&s;ician; <HI>Cleanthes</HI> is a down-right coxcomb, and will remain to all that knew him a contemptible example of talents mi&s;ap|plied. It is to this affectation the world owes its whole race of coxcombs: Nature in her whole drama never drew &s;uch a part: &s;he has &s;ometimes made a fool, but a coxcomb is always of a man's own making, by applying his talents otherwi&s;e than nature de&s;ign|ed, who ever bears an high re&s;entment for being put out of her cour&s;e, and never fails of taking revenge on tho&s;e that do &s;o.</P>

<P N="27">27. If men would be content to graft upon nature, and a&s;&s;i&s;t her operations, what mighty effects might we expect? <HI>Tully</HI> would not &s;tand &s;o much alone in oratory, <HI>Virgil</HI> in poetry, or <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in war. To build upon nature, is laying the foundation upon a rock; every thing di&s;po&s;es it&s;elf into order as it were of cour&s;e, and the whole work is half done as &s;oon as undertaken. <HI>Cicero</HI>'s genius inclined him to oratory, <HI>Virgil</HI>'s to follow the train of the Mu&s;es; they piou&s;ly obeyed the admonition, and were rewarded.</P>
<P N="28">28. Had <HI>Virgil</HI> attended the bar, his mode&s;t and ingenuous virtue would &s;urely have made but a very indifferent figure; and <HI>Tully</HI>'s declamatory inclina|tion would have been as u&s;ele&s;s in poetry. Nature, if left to her&s;elf, leads us on in the be&s;t cour&s;e, but will do nothing by compul&s;ion and con&s;traint; and if we are not &s;atisfied to go her way, we are always the greate&s;t &s;ufferers by it.</P>
<P N="29">29. Wherever nature de&s;igns a production, &s;he al|ways di&s;po&s;es &s;eeds proper for it, which are as ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the formation of any moral or in|tellectual exi&s;tence, as they are to the being and growth of plants; and I know not by what fate and folly it is, that men are taught not to reckon him equally ab&s;urd that will write ver&s;es in &s;pite of na|ture, with that gardener that &s;hould undertake to rai&s;e a jonq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il or tulip, without the help of their re|&s;pective &s;eeds.</P>

If <HI>Caelia</HI> would be &s;ilent, her beholders would adore her; if <HI>Iras</HI> would talk, her hearers would ad|mire her; but <HI>Caelia</HI>'s tongue runs ince&s;&s;antly, while <HI>Iras</HI> gives her&s;elf &s;ilent airs and &s;oft langours; &s;o that 'tis difficult to per&s;uade one's &s;elf that <HI>Caelia</HI> has beauty, and <HI>Iras</HI> wit; each neglects her own excel|lence, and is ambitious of the other's character; <HI>Iras</HI> would be thought to have as much beauty as <HI>Caelia,</HI> and <HI>Caelia</HI> as much wit as <HI>Iras.</HI></P>
<P N="32">32. The great misfortune of this affectation is, that men not only lo&s;e a good quality, but al&s;o con|tract a bad one: they not only are unfit for what they were de&s;igned, but they a&s;&s;ign them&s;elves to what they are not fit for; and in&s;tead of making a very good figure one way, make a very ridiculous one another.</P>
<P N="33">33. If <HI>Semanthe</HI> would have been &s;atisfied with her natural complexion, &s;he might &s;till have been cele|brated by the name of the olive beauty; but <HI>Semanthe</HI> has taken up an affectation to white and red, and is now di&s;tingui&s;hed by the character of the lady that paints &s;o well.</P>
<P N="34">34. In a word, could the world be reformed to the obedience of that famed dictate, <HI>Follow nature,</HI> which the oracle of <HI>Delphos</HI> pronounced to <HI>Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ero</HI> when he con&s;ulted what cour&s;e of &s;tudies he &s;hould pur&s;ue, we &s;hould &s;ee almo&s;t every man as eminent in his proper &s;phere as <HI>Tully</HI> was in his, and &s;hould in a very &s;hort time find impertinence and affectation bani&s;hed from among the women, and coxcombs and fal&s;e characters from among the men.</P>

For my part, I could never con&s;ider this pre|po&s;terous repugnancy to nature any otherwi&s;e, than not only as the greate&s;t folly, but al&s;o one of the mo&s;t heinous crimes, &s;ince it is a direct oppo&s;ition to the di&s;po&s;ition of Providence, and (as <HI>Tully</HI> expre&s;&s;es it) like the &s;in of the giants, an actual rebellion again&s;t heaven.</P>

<HEAD>Good Humour and Nature.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A MAN advanced in years that thinks fit to look back upon his former life, and calls that only life which was pa&s;&s;ed with &s;atisfaction and en|joyment, excluding all parts which were not plea&s;ant to him, will find him&s;elf very young, if not in his infancy. Sickne&s;s, ill-humour, and idlene&s;s, will have robbed him of a great &s;hare of that &s;pace we ordinarily call our life.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is therefore the duty of every man that would be true to him&s;elf, to obtain, if po&s;&s;ible, a di&s;po&s;ition to be plea&s;ed, and place him&s;elf in a con&s;tant apti|tude for the &s;atisfactions of his being. In&s;tead of this, you hardly &s;ee a man who is not unea&s;y in proportion to his advancement in the arts of life.</P>
<P N="3">3. An affected delicacy is the common improve|ment we meet with in tho&s;e who pretend to be refined above others: they do not aim at true plea&s;ure them|&s;elves, but turn their thoughts upon ob&s;erving the fal&s;e plea&s;ures of other men. Such people are vale|tudinarians in &s;ociety, and they &s;hould no more come into company than a &s;ick man &s;hould come into the air.</P>
<P N="4">4. If a man is too weak to bear what is a refre&s;h|ment to men in health, he mu&s;t &s;till keep his chamber. When any one in Sir <HI>Roger</HI>'s company complains he is out of order, he immediately calls for &s;ome po&s;&s;et drink for him; for which rea&s;on that &s;ort of people,
<PB N="30" REF="020531_0035_0FAFE32EB90D3D68">
who are ever bewailing their con&s;titutions in other places, are the chearfule&s;t imaginable when he is pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is a wonderful thing that &s;o many, and they not reckoned ab&s;urd, &s;hall entertain tho&s;e with whom they conver&s;e, by giving them the hi&s;tory of their pains and aches; and imagine &s;uch narrations their quota of the conver&s;ation. This is of all other the meane&s;t help to di&s;cour&s;e, and a man mu&s;t not think at all, or think him&s;elf very in&s;ignificant, when he finds an account of his head ach an&s;wered by another a&s;king what news in the la&s;t mail?</P>
<P N="6">6. Mutual good humour is a dre&s;s we ought to ap|pear in wherever we meet, and we &s;hould make no mention of what concerns our&s;elves, without it be of matters wherein our friends ought to rejoice: but in|deed there are crowds of people who put them&s;elves in no method of plea&s;ing them&s;elves or others; &s;uch are tho&s;e whom we u&s;ually call indolent per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="7">7. Indolence is, methinks, an intermediate &s;tate between plea&s;ure and pain, and very much unbeco|ming any part of our life after we are out of the nur&s;e's arms. Such an aver&s;ion to labour creates a con&s;tant wearine&s;s, and one would think &s;hould make exi&s;tence it&s;elf a burden.</P>
<P N="8">8. The indolent man de&s;cends from the dignity of his nature, and makes that being which was ra|tional, merely vegetative; his life con&s;i&s;ts only in the mere increa&s;e and decay of a body, which with relation to the re&s;t of the world, might as well have been uninformed, as the habitation of a rea&s;onable mind.</P>
<P N="9">9. Of this kind is the life of that extraordinary couple <HI>Harry Ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ett</HI> and his lady. <HI>Harry</HI> was in the days of his celibacy one of tho&s;e pert creatures who have much vivacity and little under&s;tanding; Mrs. <HI>Rebecca Quickly,</HI> whom he married, had all that the fire of youth and a lively manner could do to|wards making an agreeable woman.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="31" REF="020531_0036_0FAFE32FB60E5930">10. The&s;e two people of &s;eeming merit fell into each other's arms; and pa&s;&s;ion being &s;ated, and no rea&s;on or good &s;en&s;e in either to &s;ucceed it, their life is now at a &s;tand; their meals are in&s;ipid, and time tedious; their fortune has placed them above care, and their lo&s;s of ta&s;te reduced them below diver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="11">11. When we talk of the&s;e as in&s;tances of inexi&s;t|ence, we do not mean, that in order to live it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary we &s;hould always be in jovial crews, or crown|ed with chaplets of ro&s;es, as the merry fellows among the ancients are de&s;cribed; but it is intended by con&s;idering the&s;e contraries to plea&s;ure, indolence and too much delicacy, to &s;hew that it is prudence to pre&s;erve a di&s;po&s;ition in our&s;elves to receive a certain delight in all we hear and &s;ee.</P>
<P N="12">12. This portable quality of good-humour &s;ea&s;ons all the parts and occurrences we meet with, in &s;uch a manner, that there are no moments lo&s;t; but they all pa&s;s with &s;o much &s;atisfaction, that the heavie&s;t of loads (when it is a load) that of time, is never felt by us.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Varilas</HI> has this quality to the highe&s;t perfecti|on, and communicates it wherever he appears: the &s;ad, the merry, the &s;evere, the melancholy, &s;hew a new chearfulne&s;s when he comes among&s;t them. At the &s;ame time no one can repeat any thing that <HI>Vari|las</HI> has ever &s;aid that de&s;erves repetition; but the man has that innate goodne&s;s of temper, that he is welcome to every body, becau&s;e every man thinks he is &s;o to him.</P>
<P N="14">14. He does not &s;eem to contribute any thing to the mirth of the company; and yet upon reflection you find it all happened by his being there. I thought it was whim&s;ically &s;aid of a gentleman, That if <HI>Varilas</HI> had wit, it would be the be&s;t wit in the world. It is certain, when a well corrected lively imagina|tion and good-breeding are added to a &s;weet di&s;po&s;i|tion, they qualify it to be one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, as well as plea&s;ures of life.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="32" REF="020531_0037_0FAFE33110081C58">15. Men would come into company with ten times the plea&s;ure they do, if they were &s;ure of hearing nothing which &s;hould &s;hock them, as well as expect|ed what would plea&s;e them. When we know every per&s;on that is &s;poken of is repre&s;ented by one who has no ill-will, and every thing that is mentioned de&s;cri|bed by one that is apt to &s;et it in the be&s;t light, the entertainment mu&s;t be delicate, becau&s;e the cook has nothing bought to his hand, but what is the mo&s;t excellent in its kind.</P>
<P N="16">16. Beautiful pictures are the entertainments of pure minds, and deformities of the corrupted. It is a degree towards the life of angels, when we enjoy conver&s;ation wherein there is nothing pre&s;ent but in its excellence; and a degree towards that of daemons, wherein nothing is &s;hewn but in its degeneracy.</P>

<HEAD>Friend&s;hip.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ONE would think that the larger the company is in which we are engaged, the greater vari|ety of thoughts and &s;ubjects would be &s;tarted in di&s;|cour&s;e; but in&s;tead of this, we find that conver&s;ation is never &s;o much &s;traitned and confined as in numerous a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P N="2">2. When a multitude meet together upon any &s;ub|ject of di&s;cour&s;e their debates are taken up chiefly with forms and general po&s;itions; nay, if we come into a more contracted a&s;&s;embly of men and women, the talk generally runs upon the weather, fa&s;hions, news, and the like public topics.</P>
<P N="3">3. In proportion as conver&s;ation gets into clubs and knots of friends, it de&s;cends into particulars, and grows more free and communicative, but the mo&s;t open, in&s;tructive, and unre&s;erved di&s;cour&s;e, is that
<PB N="33" REF="020531_0038_0FAFE331B93A9E98">
which pa&s;&s;es between two per&s;ons who are familiar and intimate friends.</P>
<P N="4">4. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, a man gives a loo&s;e to every pa&s;&s;ion, and every thought that is uppermo&s;t di&s;covers his mo&s;t retired opinions of per&s;ons and things, tries the beauty and &s;trength of his &s;entiments, and expo&s;es his whole &s;oul to the examination of his friend.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Tully</HI> was the fir&s;t who ob&s;erved, that friend&s;hip improves happine&s;s and abates mi&s;ery, by the doub|ling of our joy ond dividing of our grief; a thought in which he hath been followed by all the e&s;&s;ayers upon friend&s;hip, that have written &s;ince his time. Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> has finely de&s;cribed other advantages, or, as he calls them, fruits of friend&s;hip; and indeed there is no &s;ubject of morality which has been better handled and more exhau&s;ted than this.</P>
<P N="6">6. Among the &s;everal fine things which have been &s;poken of, I &s;hall beg leave to quote &s;ome out of a very ancient author, who&s;e book would be regarded by our modern wits as one of the mo&s;t &s;hining tracts of morality that is extant, if it appeared under the name of a <HI>Confucius,</HI> or of any celebrated Grecian philo&s;o|pher: I mean the little Apocryphal Treati&s;e, enti|tled, The Wi&s;dom of the Son of <HI>Sirach.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. How finely has he de&s;cribed the art of making friends, by an obliging and affable behaviour? And laid down that precept which a late exellent author has delivered as his own, 'That we &s;hould have many 'well-wi&s;hers, but few friends.' Sweet language will multiply friends; and a fair-&s;peaking tongue will increa&s;e kind greetings. Be in peace with many, neverthele&s;s have but one coun&s;ellor of a thou&s;and.</P>
<P N="8">8. With what prudence does he caution us in the choice of our friends? And with what &s;trokes of na|ture (I could almo&s;t &s;ay of humour) has he de&s;cribed the behaviour of a treacherous and &s;elf-intere&s;ted friend?
<Q>If thou woulde&s;t get a friend, prove him fir&s;t, and be not ha&s;ty to credit him: for &s;ome man is a friend for his own occa&s;ion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble.</Q></P>
<P N="9"><PB N="34" REF="020531_0039_0FAFE3327B6C6700">9.
<Q>And there is a friend, who being turned to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enmity and &s;trife, will di&s;cover thy reproach.</Q>
Again,
<Q>Some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction: but in thy pro&s;perity he will be as thy&s;elf, and will be bold over thy &s;ervants. If thou be brought low he will be again&s;t thee, and hide him&s;elf from thy face.</Q></P>
<P N="10">10. What can be more &s;trong and pointed than the following ver&s;e? 'Separate thy&s;elf from thine ene|mies, and take heed of thy friends.' In the next words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e particularizes one of tho&s;e fruits of frend|&s;hip which is de&s;cribed at length by the two famous authors above mentioned, and falls into a general elogium of friend&s;hip, which is very ju&s;t as well as ve|ry &s;ublime.</P>
<P N="11">11.
<Q>A faithful friend is a &s;trong defence: and he that hath found &s;uch a one, hath found a trea&s;ure&punc; Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is unvaluable. A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord &s;hall find him. Who&s;o feareth the Lord &s;hall direct his friend&s;hip aright; for as he is, &s;o &s;hall his neigh|bour (that is, his friend) be al&s;o.</Q></P>
<P N="12">12. I do not remember to have met with any &s;ay|ing that has plea&s;ed me more than that of a friend's being the medecine of life, to expre&s;s the efficacy of friend&s;hip in healing the pains and angui&s;h which na|turally cleave to our exi&s;tence in this world; and am wonderfully plea&s;ed with the turn in the la&s;t &s;entence, That a virtuous man &s;hall as a ble&s;&s;ing meet with a friend who is as virtuous as him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="13">13. There is another &s;ay; in the &s;ame author, which would have been very much admired in an heathen writer:
<Q>For&s;ake not an old friend, for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> drink it with plea&s;ure.</Q></P>
<P N="14"><PB N="35" REF="020531_0040_0FAFE33339EFCD68">14. With what &s;trength of allu&s;ion, and force of thought, has he de&s;cribed the breaches and violations of friend&s;hip?
<Q>Who&s;o ca&s;teth a &s;tone at the birds frayeth them away; and he that upbraideth his friend, breaketh friend&s;hip. Tho' thou drawe&s;t a &s;word at a friend, yet de&s;pair not, for there may be a returning to favour: if thou ha&s;t opened thy mouth again&s;t thy friend, fear not, for there may be a reconciliation; except for upbraiding, or pride, or di&s;clo&s;ing of &s;ecrets, or a treacherous wound; for, for the&s;e things, every friend will depart.</Q></P>
<P N="15">15. We may ob&s;erve in this and &s;everal other pre|cepts in this author, tho&s;e little familiar in&s;tances and illu&s;trations which are &s;o much admired in the moral writings of <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Epictetus.</HI> There are very beautiful in&s;tances of this nature in the following pa|ges, which are likewi&s;e written upon the &s;ame &s;ubject:</P>
<P N="16">16.
<Q>Who&s;o di&s;covereth &s;ecrets, lo&s;eth his credit, and &s;hall never find a friend to his mind. Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him; but if thou be|wraye&s;t his &s;ecrets, follow no more after him: for as a man hath de&s;troyed his enemy, &s;o ha&s;t thou lo&s;t the love of thy friend; as one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, &s;o ha&s;t thou let thy friend go, and &s;hall not get him again: follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as a roe e&s;caped out of the &s;nare. As for a wound, it may be bound up, and after reviling, there may be reconciliation; but he that bewrayeth &s;ecrets, is without hope.</Q></P>
<P N="17">17. Among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;everal qualifications of a good friend, this wi&s;e man has very ju&s;tly &s;ingled out con|&s;tancy and faithfulne&s;s as the principal: to the&s;e, others have added virtue, knowledge, di&s;cretion, equality in age and fortune, and as <HI>Cicero</HI> calls it, <HI>morum comitas,</HI> a plea&s;antne&s;s of temper.</P>
<P N="18">18. If I were to give my opinion upon &s;uch an ex|hau&s;ted &s;ubject, I &s;hould join to the&s;e other qualifica|tions a certain aequibility or evenne&s;s of behaviour. A man often contracts a friend&s;hip with one whom per|haps

<P N="19">19. There are &s;everal per&s;ons who in &s;ome certain periods of their lives are inexpre&s;&s;ibly agreeable, and in others as odious&punc; and dete&s;table. <HI>Martial</HI> has gi|ven us a very pretty picture of one of the&s;e &s;pecies in the following epigram:

<L>Ha&s;t &s;o much wit and mirth, and &s;pleen about thee,</L>
<L>There is no living with thee, nor without thee.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P N="20">20. It is very unlucky for a man to be entangled in a friend&s;hip with one, who by the&s;e changes and vici&s;&s;itudes of humour is &s;ometimes amiable, and &s;ometimes odious&punc; and as mo&s;t men are at &s;ome times in an admirable frame and di&s;po&s;ition of mind, it &s;hould be one of the greate&s;t ta&s;ks of wi&s;dom to keep our&s;elves well when we are &s;o, and never to go out of that which is the agreeable part of our character.</P>
<BIBL>SPECTATOR, Vol. I. No. 68.</BIBL>
<P N="21">21.
<Q>Friend&s;hip is a &s;trong and habitual inclina|tion in two per&s;ons to promote the good and happi|ne&s;s of one another.</Q>
Though the plea&s;ures and advantages of friend&s;hip have been largely celebrat|ed by the be&s;t moral writers, and are con&s;idered by all as great ingredients of human happine&s;s, we very rarely meet with the practice of this virtue in the world.</P>
<P N="22">22. Every man is ready to give a long catalogue of tho&s;e virtues and good qualities he expects to find in the per&s;on of a friend, but very few of us are care|ful to cultivate them in our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="020531_0042_0FAFE334B9F00FD0">Love and e&s;teem are the fir&s;t principles of friend|&s;hip, which always is imperfect where either of the&s;e two is wanting.</P>
<P N="23">23. As, on the one hand, we are &s;oon a&s;hamed of loving a man whom we cannot e&s;teem; &s;o on the o|ther, though we are truly &s;en&s;ible of a man's abilities, we can never rai&s;e our&s;elves to the warmths of friend|&s;hip, without an affectionate good-will towards his per&s;on.</P>
<P N="24">24. Friend&s;hip immediately bani&s;hes envy under all its di&s;gui&s;es. A man who can once doubt whether he &s;hould rejoice in his friend's being happier than him&s;elf, may depend upon it, that he is an utter &s;tran|ger to this virtue.</P>
<P N="25">25. There is &s;omething in friend&s;hip &s;o very great and noble, that in tho&s;e fictitious &s;tories which are invented to the honour of any particular per&s;on, the authors have thought it as nece&s;&s;ary to make their hero a friend as a lover. <HI>Achilles</HI> has his <HI>Patroclus,</HI> and, <HI>Aeneas</HI> his <HI>Achates.</HI></P>
<P N="26">26. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e in&s;tances we may ob&s;erve, for the reputation of the &s;ubject I am treating of, that <HI>Greece</HI> was almo&s;t ruined by the hero's love, but was pre&s;erved by his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P N="27">27 The character of <HI>Achates</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts to us an ob|&s;ervation we may often make on the intimacies of great men, who frequently choo&s;e their companions rather for the qualities of the heart, than tho&s;e of the head: and prefer fidelity, in an ea&s;y inoffen&s;ive com|plying temper, to tho&s;e endowments which make a much greater figure among mankind.</P>
<P N="28">28. I do not remember that <HI>Achates,</HI> who is repre|&s;ented as the fir&s;t favourite, either gives his advice, or &s;trikes a blow through the whole <HI>Aeneid.</HI></P>
<P>A friend&s;hip, which makes the lea&s;t noi&s;e, is very often mo&s;t u&s;eful; for which rea&s;on I &s;hould prefer a prudent friend to a zealous one.</P>
<P N="29">29. <HI>Atticus,</HI> one of the be&s;t men of ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> was a very remarkable in&s;tance of what I am here

&s;peaking.

<P N="30">30. During the war between <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Pompey,</HI> he &s;till maintained the &s;ame conduct. After the death of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> he &s;ent money to <HI>Brutus</HI> in his troubles, and did a thou&s;and good offices to <HI>Antony</HI>'s wife and friends, when the party &s;eemed ruined. La&s;tly, even in that bloody war between <HI>Antony</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tus, Atticus,</HI> &s;till kept his place in both their friend&s;hips; in&s;omuch, that the fir&s;t, &s;ays <HI>Cornelius Nepos,</HI> when|ever he was ab&s;ent from <HI>Rome</HI> in any part of the em|pire, writ punctually to him what he was doing, what he read, and whither he intended to go; and the latter gave him con&s;tantly an exact account of all his affairs.</P>
<P N="31">31. A likene&s;s of inclinations in every particular is &s;o far from being requi&s;ite to form a benevolence in two minds towards each other, as it is generally imagined, that I believe we &s;hall find &s;ome of the firme&s;t friend&s;hips to have been contracted between per&s;ons of different humours; the mind being often plea&s;ed with tho&s;e perfections which are new to it, and which it does not find among its own accom|pli&s;hments.</P>
<P N="32">32. Be&s;ides that a man in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upplies his own defects, and fancies him&s;elf at &s;econd-hand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e good qualities and endowments, which are in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him who in the eye of the world is looked on as his other &s;elf.</P>
<P N="33">33. The mo&s;t difficult province in friend&s;hip is the letting a man &s;ee his faults and errors, which &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be &s;o contrived, that he may per|ceive
<PB N="39" REF="020531_0044_0FAFE336396E9B30">
our advice is given him not &s;o much to plea&s;e our&s;elves, as for his own advantage. The reproaches, therefore, of a friend &s;hould always be &s;trictly ju&s;t, and not too frequent.</P>
<P N="34">34. The violent de&s;ire of plea&s;ing in the per&s;on reproved may otherwi&s;e change into a de&s;pair of do|ing it, while he finds him&s;elf cen&s;ured for faults he is not con&s;cious of. A mind that is &s;oftened and huma|nized by friend&s;hip, cannot bear frequent reproaches: either it mu&s;t quite &s;ink under the oppre&s;&s;ion, or abate con&s;iderably of the value and e&s;teem it had for him who be&s;tows them.</P>
<P N="35">35. The proper bu&s;ine&s;s of friend&s;hip is to in&s;pire life and courage; and a &s;oul, thus &s;upported, out-does it&s;elf; whereas if it be unexpectedly deprived of tho&s;e &s;uccours, it droops and langui&s;hes.</P>
<P N="36">36. We are in &s;ome mea&s;ure more inexcu&s;able if we violate our duties to a friend, than to a relation; &s;ince the former ari&s;e from a voluntary choice, the latter from a nece&s;&s;ity, to which we could not give our own con&s;ent.</P>
<P N="37">37. As it has been &s;aid on one &s;ide, that a man ought not to break with a faulty friend, that he may not expo&s;e the weakne&s;s of his choice; it will doubt|le&s;s hold much &s;tronger with re&s;pect to a worthy one, that he may never be upbraided for having lo&s;t &s;o valuable a trea&s;ure which was once in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P N="15">15. I am confident a thou&s;and young people, who would have been ornaments to &s;ociety, have, from fear of &s;candal, never dared to exert them&s;elves in the polite arts of life. Their lives have pa&s;&s;ed away in an odious ru&s;ticity, in &s;pite of great advantages of per&s;on, genius, and fortune.</P>
<P N="16">16. There is a vicious terror of being blamed in &s;ome well-inclined people, and a wicked plea&s;ure in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them in others; both which I recommend to your &s;pectatorial wi&s;dom to animadvert upon; and if you can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ucce&s;sful in it, I need not &s;ay how much you will de&s;erve of the town; but new toa&s;ts will owe to you their beauty, and new wits their fame.</P>
<P N="17">17. Truth and reality have all the advantages of appearance, and many more. If the &s;hew of any thing be good for any thing, I am &s;ure &s;incerity is better: for why does any man di&s;&s;emble, or &s;eem to

be that which he is not, but becau&s;e he thinks it good to have &s;uch a quality as he pretends to? for to counterfeit and di&s;&s;emble, is to put on the appear|ance of &s;ome real excellency.</P>
<P N="18">18. Now the be&s;t way in the world for a man to &s;eem to be any thing, is really to be what he would &s;eem to be. Be&s;ides that, it is many times as trou|ble&s;ome to make good the pretence of a good quali|ty, as to have it; and if a man have it not, it is ten to one but he is di&s;covered to want it, and then all his pains and labour to &s;eem to have it is lo&s;t. There is &s;omething unn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tural in pai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing, which a &s;kilful eye will ea&s;ily di&s;cern from native beauty and com|plexion.</P>
<P N="19">19. It is hard to per&s;onate and act a part long; for where truth is not at the bottom, nature will al|ways be endeavouring to return, and will peep out and betray her&s;elf one time or other. Therefore, if any man think it convenient to &s;eem good, let him be &s;o indeed, and then his goodne&s;s will appear to every body's &s;atisfaction; &s;o that, upon all accounts &s;incerity is true wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="20">20. Particularly as to the affairs of this world, integrity hath many advantages over all the fine and artificial ways of di&s;&s;imulation and deceit; it is much the plainer and ea&s;ier, much the &s;afer and more &s;e|cure way of dealing in the world; it has le&s;s of trou|ble and difficulty, of entanglement and perplexity, of danger and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: it is the &s;horte&s;t and neare&s;t way to our end&punc; carrying us thither in a &s;traight line, and will hold out and la&s;t longe&s;t.</P>

<P N="22">22. Truth is always con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and needs nothing to help it out; it is always near at hand, and &s;its upon our lips, and is ready to drop out before we are aware; whereas a lye is trouble|&s;ome, and &s;ets a man's invention upon the rack, and one trick needs a great many more to make it good.</P>
<P N="23">23. It is like building upon a fal&s;e foundation, which continually &s;tands in need of props to &s;hoar it up, and proves at la&s;t more chargeable, than to have rai&s;ed a &s;ub&s;tantial building at fir&s;t upon a true and &s;olid foundation; for &s;incerity is firm and &s;ub&s;tantial, and there is nothing hollow and un&s;ound in it, and becau&s;e it is plain and open, fears no di&s;covery:</P>
<P N="24">24. Of which the crafty man is always in danger, and when he thinks he walks in the dark, all his pre|tences are &s;o tran&s;parent, that he who runs may read them; he is the la&s;t man that finds him&s;elf to be found out, and whil&s;t he takes it for granted that he makes fools of others, he renders him&s;elf ridiculous.</P>
<P N="25">25. Add to all this, that &s;incerity is the mo&s;t com|pendious wi&s;dom, and an excellent in&s;trument for the &s;peedy di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s; it creates confidence in tho&s;e we have to deal with, &s;aves the labour of many enquiries, and brings things to an i&s;&s;ue in a few words:</P>
<P N="26">26. It is like travelling in a plain beaten road, which commonly brings a man &s;ooner to his journey's end than by-ways, in which men often lo&s;e them&s;elves. In a word, what&s;oever convenience may be thought to be in fal&s;hood and di&s;&s;imulation, it is &s;oon over; but the inconvenience of it is perpetual, becau&s;e it brings a man under an everla&s;ting jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;pi|cion, &s;o that he is not believed when he &s;peaks truth, nor tru&s;ted when perhaps he means hone&s;tly; when a man hath once forfeited the reputation of his inte|grity, he is &s;et fa&s;t, and nothing will then &s;erve his turn, neither truth nor fal&s;hood.</P>
<P N="27"><PB N="45" REF="020531_0050_0FAFE33ABA5136E8">27. And I have often thought, that God hath, in his great wi&s;dom, hid from men of fal&s;e and di&s;hone&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> minds, the wonderful advantages of truth and inte|grity to the pro&s;perity even of our worldly affairs; the&s;e men are &s;o blinded by their covetou&s;ne&s;s an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ambition, that they cannot look beyond a pre&s;ent advantage, nor forbear to &s;eize upon it, though by ways never &s;o indirect; they cannot &s;ee &s;o far, as to the remote con&s;equences of a &s;teady integrity, and the va&s;t benefit and advantages which it will bring a man at la&s;t.</P>
<P N="28">28. Were but this &s;ort of men wi&s;e and clear &s;ighted enough to di&s;cern this, they would be hone&s;t out of very knavery; not out of any love to hone&s;ty and vir|tue, but with a crafty de&s;ign to promote and advance more effectually their own intere&s;ts; and therefore the ju&s;tice of the Divine Providence hath hid this tru|e&s;t point of wi&s;dom from their eyes, that bad men might not be upon equal terms with the ju&s;t and up|right, and &s;erve their own wicked de&s;igns by hone&s;t and lawful means.</P>
<P N="29">29. Indeed if a man were only to deal in the world for a day, and &s;hould never have occa&s;ion to conver&s;e more with mankind, never more need their good opi|nion or good word, it were then no great matter (&s;peaking as to the concernments of this world) if a man &s;pent his reputation all at once, and ventured it at one throw.</P>
<P N="30">30. But if he be to continue in the world, and would have the advantage of conver&s;ation whil&s;t he is in it, let him make u&s;e of truth and &s;incerity in all his words and actions; for nothing but this will la&s;t and hold out to the end; all other arts will fail, but truth and integrity will carry a man through, and bear him out to the la&s;t.</P>
<P N="31">31. When <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> was once a&s;ked, what a man could gain by uttering fal&s;hoods? he replied,

<P N="36">36. The ca&s;ui&s;ts have very diligently di&s;tingui&s;hed lyes into their &s;everal cla&s;&s;es, according to their va|rious degrees of malignity: but they have, I think, generally omitted that which is mo&s;t common, and perhaps, not le&s;s mi&s;chievous; which, &s;ince the mo|rali&s;ts have not given it a name, I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h as the lye of vanity.</P>
<P>To vanity may ju&s;tly be imputed mo&s;t of the fal&s;|hoods, which every man perceives hourly playing upon his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r, and, perhaps, mo&s;t of tho&s;e that are propagated with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P N="37">37. To the lye of commerce, and the lye of malice, the motive is &s;o apparent, that they are &s;eldom neg|ligently or implicitly received: &s;u&s;picion is always watchful over the practices of intere&s;t; and whatever the hope of gain, or de&s;ire of mi&s;chief, can prompt one man to a&s;&s;ert, another is by rea&s;ons equally co|gent incited to refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.

<P N="39">39. It is remarked by Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby,</HI>

<P>Such an accidental advantage, &s;ince it neither im|plies merit, nor confers dignity, one would think &s;hould not be de&s;ired &s;o much as to be counterfeited: yet even this vanity, trifling as it is, produces in|numerable narratives, all equally fal&s;e, but more or le&s;s credible, in proportion to the &s;kill or confidence of the relater.</P>

<P N="43">43.

<P N="1">1. BODILY labour is of two kinds, either that which a man &s;ubmits to for his livelihood, or that which he undergoes for his plea&s;ure. The latter of them generally changes the name of labour for that of exerci&s;e, but differs only from ordinary la|bour as it ri&s;es from another motive.</P>
<P>A country life abounds in both the&s;e kinds of la|bour, and for that rea&s;on gives a man a greater &s;tock of health, and con&s;equently a more perfect enjoyment of him&s;elf, than any other way of life.</P>

This de&s;cription does not on|ly comprehend the bowels, bones, tendons, veins, nerves, and arteries, but every mu&s;cle and every li|gature, which is a compo&s;ition of fibres, that are &s;o many imperceptible tubes or pipes interwoven on all &s;ides with invi&s;ible glands or &s;trainers</P>

agitations, to mix, dige&s;t, and &s;eparate the juices contained in it, as well as to clear and clean&s;e that infinitude of pipes and &s;trainers of which it is com|po&s;ed, and to give their &s;olid parts a more firm and la&s;ting tone. Labour or exerci&s;e ferments the hu|mours, ca&s;ts them into their proper channels, throws off redundancies, and helps nature in tho&s;e &s;ecret di&s;tributions, without which the body cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in its vigour, nor the &s;oul act with chearfulne&s;s.</P>

I have de|&s;cribed in my hundred and fifteenth paper, from the general &s;tructure and mechani&s;m of an human body, how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary exerci&s;e is for its pre&s;erva|tion; I &s;hall in this place recommend another great pre&s;ervative of health, which in many ca&s;es produces the &s;ame effects as exerci&s;e, and may, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, &s;upply its place, where opportunities of exer|ci&s;e are wanting.</P>
<P N="18">18. The pre&s;ervative I am &s;peaking of is tempe|rance, which has tho&s;e particular advantages above all other means of health, that it may be practi&s;ed by all ranks and conditions, at any &s;ea&s;on, or in any

place. It is a kind of regimen into which every man may put him&s;elf, without interruption to bu&s;ine&s;s, ex|pence of money, or lo&s;s of time. If exerci&s;e throws off all &s;uperfluities, temperance prevents them: if exerci&s;e clears the ve&s;&s;els, temperance neither &s;ati|ates nor over-&s;trains them: if exerci&s;e rai&s;es proper ferments in the humours, and promotes the circula|tion of the blood, temperance gives nature her full play, and enables her to exert her&s;elf in all her force and vigour: if exerci&s;e di&s;&s;ipates a growing di&s;tem|per, temperance &s;tarves it.</P>
<P N="19">19. Phy&s;ic, for the mo&s;t part, is nothing el&s;e but the &s;ub&s;titute of exerci&s;e or temperance. Medicines are indeed ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in acute di&s;tempers, that cannot wait the &s;low operations of the&s;e two great in&s;truments of health; but did men live in an habitual cour&s;e of exerci&s;e and temperance, there would be but little occa&s;ion for them. Accordingly we find that tho&s;e parts of the world are the mo&s;t healthy, where they &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the chace; and that men lived longe&s;t when their lives were employed in hunting, and when they had little food be&s;ides what they caught.</P>
<P N="20">20. Bli&s;tering, cupping, bleeding, are &s;eldom of u&s;e to any but to the idle and intemperate; as all tho&s;e inward applications, which are &s;o much in prac|tice among us, are, for the mo&s;t part, nothing el&s;e but expedients to make luxury con&s;i&s;tent with health. The apothecary is perpetually employed in counter|mining the cook and the vintner. It is &s;aid of <HI>Dio|genes,</HI> that meeting a young man who was going to a fea&s;t, he took him up in the &s;treet, and carried him home to his friends, as one who was running into im|minent danger, had he not prevented him.</P>
<P N="21">21. What would that philo&s;opher have &s;aid, had he been pre&s;ent at the gluttony of a modern meal? would not he have thought the ma&s;ter of a family mad, and have begged his &s;ervant to tie down his hands, had he &s;een him devour fowl, fi&s;h, and fle&s;h;
<PB N="61" REF="020531_0066_0FAFE346BAE675F0">
&s;wallow oil and vinegar, wines and &s;pices; throw down &s;alads of twenty different herbs, &s;auces of an hundred ingredients, confections and fruits of num|berle&s;s &s;weets and flavours? What unnatural mo|tions and counter-ferments mu&s;t &s;uch a medley of in|temperance produce in the body? For my part, when I behold a fa&s;hionable table &s;et out in all its magnificence, I fancy, that I &s;ee gouts and drop&s;ies, fevers and lethargies, with other innumerable di&s;tem|pers, lying in ambu&s;cade among the di&s;hes.</P>
<P N="22">22. Nature delights in the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple diet. Every animal, but man, keeps to one di&s;h. Herbs are the food of this &s;pecies, fi&s;h of that, and fle&s;h of a third. Man falls upon every thing that comes in his way; not the &s;malle&s;t fruit or excre|&s;cence of the earth, &s;carce a berry, or a mu&s;hroom, can e&s;cape him.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to lay down any determinate rule for temperance, becau&s;e what is luxury in one may be temperance in another; but there are few that have lived any time in the world, who are not judges of their own con&s;titutions, &s;o far as to know what kinds and what proportions of food do be&s;t agree with them.</P>
<P N="23">23. Were I to con&s;ider my readers as my patients, and to pre&s;cribe &s;uch a kind of temperance as is ac|commodated to all per&s;ons, and &s;uch as is particu|larly &s;uitable to our climate and way of living, I would copy the following rules of a very eminent phy&s;ician. Make your whole repa&s;t out of one di&s;h. If you indulge in a &s;econd, avoid drinking any thing &s;trong till you have fini&s;hed your meal: at the &s;ame time ab&s;tain from all &s;auces, or at lea&s;t &s;uch as are not the mo&s;t plain and &s;imple.</P>
<P N="24">24. A man could not be well-guilty of gluttony, if he &s;tuck to the&s;e few obvious and ea&s;y rules. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, there would be no variety of ta&s;tes to &s;olicit his palate, and occa&s;ion exce&s;s; nor in the &s;e|cond any artificial provocatives to relieve &s;atiety,
<PB N="62" REF="020531_0067_0FAFE3477A06F330">
and create a fal&s;e appetite. Were I to pre&s;cribe a rule for drinking, it &s;hould be formed upon a &s;aying quoted by Sir <HI>William Temple; The fir&s;t gla&s;s for my|&s;elf, the &s;econd for my friends, the third for good hu|mour, and the fourth for my enemies.</HI> But becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible for one who lives in the world to diet him&s;elf always in &s;o philo&s;ophical a manner, I think every man &s;hould have his days of ab&s;tinence, accord|ing as his con&s;titution will permit.</P>
<P N="25">25. The&s;e are great reliefs to nature, as they qua|lify her for &s;truggling with hunger and thir&s;t, when|ever any di&s;temper or duty of life may put her upon &s;uch difficulties; and at the &s;ame time give her an opportunity of extricating her&s;elf from her oppre&s;|&s;ions, and recovering the &s;everal tones and &s;prings of her di&s;tended ve&s;&s;els. Be&s;ides that, ab&s;tinence well-timed often kills a &s;ickne&s;s in embryo, and de&s;troys the fir&s;t &s;eeds of an indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="26">26. It is ob&s;erved by two or three ancient authors, that <HI>Socrates,</HI> notwith&s;tanding he lived in <HI>Athens</HI> dur|ing that great plague, which has made &s;o much noi&s;e through all ages, and has been celebrated at different times by &s;uch eminent hands; I &s;ay, notwith&s;tanding that he lived in the time of this devouring pe&s;tilence, he never caught the lea&s;t infection, which tho&s;e wri|ters unanimou&s;ly a&s;cribe to that uninterrupted tem|perance which he always ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="27">27. And here I cannot but mention an ob&s;ervation which I have often made, upon reading the lives of the philo&s;ophers, and comparing them with any &s;e|ries of kings or great men of the &s;ame number. If we con&s;ider the&s;e ancient &s;ages, a great part of who&s;e philo&s;ophy con&s;i&s;ted in a temperate and ab&s;temious cour&s;e of life, one would think the life of a philo&s;o|pher and the life of a man were of two different dates.

<P N="28"><PB N="63" REF="020531_0068_0FAFE348409AE070">28. But the mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tance of the effi|cacy of temperance towards the procuring of long life, is what we meet with in a little book publi&s;hed by <HI>Lewis Cornaro</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI>; which I the rather mention, becau&s;e it is of undoubted credit, as the late <HI>Venetian</HI> amba&s;&s;ador, who was of the &s;ame fami|ly, atte&s;ted more than once in conver&s;ation, when he re&s;ided in <HI>England.

<P N="29">29 He lived to give a third or fourth edition of it, and after having pa&s;&s;ed his hundredth year, died without pain or agony, and like one who falls a&s;leep.

The mixture of the old man in it is rather a recom|mendation than a di&s;credit to it.</P>

<HEAD>The Duty of Secrecy.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is related by <HI>Quintus Curtius,</HI> that the <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI> always conceived a la&s;ting and invincible contempt of a man who had violated the laws of &s;e|crecy: for they thought, that, however he might be deficient in the qualities requi&s;ite to actual excellence, the negative virtues at lea&s;t were always in his power, and though he perhaps could not &s;peak well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he was to try, it was &s;till ea&s;y for him not to &s;peak.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this opinion of the ea&s;ine&s;s of &s;ecrecy, they &s;eem to have con&s;idered it as oppo&s;ed, not to trea|chery,
<PB N="64" REF="020531_0069_0FAFE348F8E14398">
but loquacity, and to have conceived the man, whom they thus cen&s;ured, not frighted by menaces to reveal, or bribed by promi&s;es to betray, but incited by the mere plea&s;ure of talking, or &s;ome other mo|tive equally trivial, to lay open his heart without re|flection, and to let whatever he knew &s;lip from him, only for want of power to retain it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether, by their &s;ettled and avowed &s;corn of thoughtle&s;s talkers, the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were able to diffu&s;e to any great extent, the virtue of taciturnity, we are hindered by the di&s;tances of tho&s;e times from being able to di&s;cover, there being very few memoirs re|maining of the court of <HI>Per&s;epolis,</HI> nor any di&s;tinct accounts handed down to us of their office-clerks, their ladies of the bed-chamber, their attorneys, their chamber-maids, or their footmen.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the&s;e latter ages, though the old animo&s;ity again&s;t a prattler is &s;till retained, it appears wholly to have lo&s;t its effects upon the conduct of mankind; for &s;ecrets are &s;o &s;eldom kept, that it may with &s;ome rea&s;on be doubted, whether the ancients were not mi&s;taken in their fir&s;t po&s;tulate, whether the quality of retention be &s;o generally be&s;towed, and whether a &s;ecret has not &s;ome &s;ubtile volatility, by which it e&s;|capes almo&s;t imperceptibly at the &s;malle&s;t vent; or &s;ome power of fermentation, by which it expands it|&s;elf &s;o as to bur&s;t the heart that will not give it way.</P>
<P N="5">5. Tho&s;e that &s;tudy either the body or the mind of man, very often find the mo&s;t &s;pecious and plea&s;ing theory falling under the weight of contrary experi|ence; and in&s;tead of gratifying their vanity by in|ferring effects from cau&s;es, they are always reduced at la&s;t to conjecture cau&s;es from effects. That it is ea&s;y to be &s;ecret the &s;peculati&s;t can demon&s;trate in his retreat, and therefore thinks him&s;elf ju&s;tified in placing confidence; the man of the world knows, that, whether difficult or not, it is uncommon, and therefore finds him&s;elf rather inclined to &s;earch after the rea&s;on of this univer&s;al failure in one of the mo&s;t important duties of &s;ociety.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="65" REF="020531_0070_0FAFE34A55B403D8">6. The vanity of being known to be tru&s;ted with a &s;ecret is generally one of the chief motives to di&s;clo&s;e it; for however ab&s;urd it may be thought to boa&s;t an honour, by an act that &s;hews that it was conferred without merit, yet mo&s;t men &s;eem rather inclined to confe&s;s the want of virtue than of importance, and more willingly &s;hew their influence and their power though at the expence of their probity, than glide through life with no other plea&s;ure than the private con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of fidelity: which, while it is pre&s;erved mu&s;t be without prai&s;e, except from the &s;ingle per&s;on who tries and knows it.</P>
<P N="7">7. There are many ways of telling a &s;ecret, by which a man exempts him&s;elf from the reproaches of his con&s;cience, and gratifies his pride without &s;uffer|ing him&s;elf to believe that he impairs his virtue. He tells the private affairs of his patron, or his friend only to tho&s;e from whom he would not conceal his own; he tells them to tho&s;e, who have no temptati|on to betray their tru&s;t, or with a denunciation of a certain forfeiture of his friend&s;hip, if he di&s;covers that they become public.</P>
<P N="8">8. Secrets are very frequently told in the fir&s;t ar|dour of kindne&s;s, or of love, for the &s;ake of proving by &s;o important a &s;acrifice, the &s;incerity of profe&s;&s;i|ons, or the warmth of tenderne&s;s; but with this mo|tive, though it be &s;ometimes &s;trong in it&s;elf, vanity generally concurs, &s;ince every man naturally de&s;ires to be mo&s;t e&s;teemed by tho&s;e whom he loves, or with whom he conver&s;es, with whom he pa&s;&s;es his hours of plea&s;ure, and to whom he retires from bu&s;ine&s;s and from care.</P>
<P N="9">9. When the di&s;covery of &s;ecrets is under con&s;ide|ration, there is always a di&s;tinction carefully to be made between our own and tho&s;e of another, tho&s;e of which we are fully ma&s;ters as they effect only our own intere&s;t, and tho&s;e which are repo&s;ited with us in tru&s;t, and involve the happine&s;s or convenience of &s;uch as we have no right to expo&s;e to hazard by ex|periments

upon their lives, without their con&s;ent. To tell our own &s;ecrets is generally folly, but that fol|ly is without guilt; to communicate tho&s;e with which we are entru&s;ted is always treachery, and treachery for the mo&s;t part combined with folly.</P>
<P N="10">10. There have, indeed, been &s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;tic and irrational zealots for friend&s;hip, who have main|tained, and perhaps believed, that one friend has a right to all that is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another; and that therefore it is a violation of kindne&s;s to exempt any &s;ecret from this boundle&s;s confidence: accordingly a late female mini&s;ter of &s;tate has been &s;hamele&s;s enough to inform the world, that &s;he u&s;ed, when &s;he wanted to extract any thing from her &s;overeign, to remind her of <HI>Montaigne's</HI> rea&s;oning, who has determined, that to tell a &s;ecret to a friend is no breach of fidelity, becau&s;e the number of per&s;ons tru&s;ted is not multipli|ed, a man and his friend being virtually the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="11">11. That &s;uch a fallacy could be impo&s;ed upon any human under&s;tanding, or that an author could have been imagined to advance a po&s;ition &s;o remote from truth and rea&s;on, any otherwi&s;e than as a declaimer, to &s;hew to what extent he could &s;tretch his imagina|tion, and with what &s;trength he could pre&s;s his prin|ciple, would &s;carcely have been credible, had not this lady kindly &s;hewn us how far weakne&s;s may be deluded, or indolence amu&s;ed.</P>
<P N="12">12. But &s;ince it appears, that even this &s;ophi&s;try has been able, with the help of a &s;trong de&s;ire to re|po&s;e in quiet upon the under&s;tanding of another, to mi&s;lead hone&s;t intentions, and an under&s;tanding not contemptible, it may not be &s;uperfluous to remark, that tho&s;e things which are common among friends are only &s;uch as either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in his own right, and can alienate or de&s;troy without injury to any other per&s;on. Without this limitation, confidence mu&s;t run on without end, the &s;econd per&s;on may tell the &s;ecret to the third upon the &s;ame principle as he re|ceived it from the fir&s;t, and the third may hand it

forward to a fourth, till at la&s;t it is told in the round of friend&s;hip to them from whom it was the fir&s;t in|tention chiefly to conceal it.</P>
<P N="13">13. The confidence which <HI>Caius</HI> has of the faith|fulne&s;s of <HI>Titius</HI> is nothing more than an opinion which him&s;elf cannot know to be true, and which <HI>Claudius,</HI> who fir&s;t tells his &s;ecret to <HI>Caius,</HI> may know, at lea&s;t may &s;u&s;pect to be fal&s;e; and therefore the tru&s;t is transferred by <HI>Caius,</HI> if he reveal what has been told him, to one from whom the per&s;on ori|ginally concerned would probably have withheld it; and whatever may be the event, <HI>Caius</HI> has hazarded the happine&s;s of his friend, without nece&s;&s;ity and without permi&s;&s;ion, and has put that tru&s;t in the hand of fortune which was given only to virtue.</P>
<P N="14">14. All the arguments upon which a man who is telling the private affairs of another may ground his confidence in &s;ecurity, he mu&s;t upon reflection know to be uncertain, becau&s;e he finds them without effect upon him&s;elf. When he is imagining that <HI>Titius</HI> will be cautious from a regard to his intere&s;t, his re|putation, or his duty, he ought to reflect that he is him&s;elf at that in&s;tant acting in oppo&s;ition to all the&s;e rea&s;ons, and revealing what intere&s;t, reputation and duty direct him to conceal.</P>
<P N="15">15. Every one feels that he &s;hould con&s;ider the man incapable of tru&s;t, who believed him&s;elf at li|berty to tell whatever he knew to the fir&s;t whom he &s;hould conclude de&s;erving of his confidence: there|fore <HI>Caius,</HI> in admitting <HI>Titius</HI> to the affairs imparted only to him&s;elf, violates his faith, &s;ince he acts con|trary to the intention of <HI>Claudius,</HI> to whom that faith was given. For promi&s;es of friend&s;hip are, like all others, u&s;ele&s;s and vain, unle&s;s they are made in &s;ome known &s;en&s;e, adju&s;ted and acknowledged by both parties.</P>
<P N="16">16. I am not ignorant that many que&s;tions may be &s;tarted relating to the duty of &s;ecrecy, where the af|fairs are of public concern; where &s;ub&s;equent rea&s;ons

may ari&s;e to alter the appearance and nature of the tru&s;t; that the manner in which the &s;ecret was told may change the degree of obligation; and that the principles upon which a man is cho&s;en for a confident may not always equally con&s;train him.</P>
<P N="17">17. But the&s;e &s;cruples, if not too intricate, are of too exten&s;ive con&s;ideration for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, nor are they &s;uch as generally occur in common life; and though ca&s;ui&s;tical knowledge be u&s;eful in proper hands, yet it ought by no means to be carele&s;sly ex|po&s;ed, &s;ince mo&s;t will u&s;e it rather to lull than awaken their own con&s;ciences; and the threads of rea&s;oning, on which truth is &s;u&s;pended, are frequently drawn to &s;uch &s;ubtilty, that common eyes cannot perceive, and common &s;en&s;ibility cannot feel them.</P>
<P N="18">18. The whole doctrine as well as practice of &s;e|crecy is &s;o perplexing and dangerous, that, next to him who is compelled to tru&s;t, I think him unhappy who is cho&s;en to be tru&s;ted; for he is often involved in &s;cruples without the liberty of calling in the help of any other under&s;tanding; he is frequently drawn into guilt, under the appearance of friend&s;hip and hone&s;ty; and &s;ometimes &s;ubjected to &s;u&s;picion by the treachery of others, who are engaged without his knowledge in the &s;ame &s;chemes; for he that has one confident has generally more, and when he is at la&s;t betrayed, is in doubt on whom he &s;hall fix the crime.</P>
<P N="19">19.

<HEAD>Of Chearfulne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I Have always preferred chearfulne&s;s to mirth. The latter I con&s;ider as an act, the former as a habit of the mind. Mirth is &s;hort and tran&s;&s;ient, chearfulne&s;s fixed and permanent. Tho&s;e are often rai&s;ed into the greate&s;t tran&s;ports of mirth, who are &s;ubject to the greate&s;t depre&s;&s;ions of melancholy: on the contrary, chearfulne&s;s, though it does not give the mind &s;uch an exqui&s;ite gladne&s;s, prevents us from falling into any depths of &s;orrow. Mirth is like a fla&s;h of lightning that breaks through a gloom of clouds, and glitters for a moment; chearfulne&s;s keeps up a kind of day-light in the mind, and fills it with a &s;tudy and perpetual &s;erenity.</P>
<P N="2">2. Men of au&s;tere principles look upon mirth as too wanton and di&s;&s;olute for a &s;tate of probation, and as filled with a certain triumph and in&s;olence of heart that is incon&s;i&s;tent with a life which is every moment obnoxious to the greate&s;t dangers. Writers of this complexion have ob&s;erved, that the &s;acred per&s;on who was the great pattern of perfection, was never &s;een to laugh.</P>
<P N="3">3. Chearfulne&s;s of mind is not liable to any of the&s;e exceptions; it is of a &s;erious and compo&s;ed na|ture; it does not throw the mind into a condition im|proper for the pre&s;ent &s;tate of humanity, and is very con&s;picuous in the characters of tho&s;e who are looked upon as the greate&s;t philo&s;ophers among the heathens, as well as among tho&s;e who have been de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed as &s;aints and holy men among Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="4">4. If we con&s;ider chearfulne&s;s in three lights, with regard to our&s;elves, to tho&s;e we conver&s;e with, and to the great Author of our being, it will not a little recommend it&s;elf on each of the&s;e accounts. The man who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this excellent frame of mind, is not only ea&s;y in his thoughts, but a perfect ma&s;ter of all the powers and faculties of the &s;oul: his ima|gination
<PB N="70" REF="020531_0075_0FAFE34D7B265968">
is always clear, and his judgment undi&s;|turbed: his temper is even and unruffled, whether in action or &s;olitude. He comes with a reli&s;h to all tho&s;e goods which nature has provided for him, ta&s;tes all the plea&s;ures of the creation which are poured a|bout him, and does not feel the full weight of tho&s;e accidental evils which may befal him.</P>
<P N="5">5. If we con&s;ider him in relation to the per&s;ons whom he conver&s;es with, it naturally produces love and good will towards him&punc; A chearful mind is not only di&s;po&s;ed to be affable and obliging, but rai&s;es the &s;ame good humour in tho&s;e who come within its influence. A man finds him&s;elf plea&s;ed, he does not know why, with the chearfulne&s;s of his companion: it is like a &s;udden &s;un-&s;hine that awakens a &s;ecret de|light in the mind, without her attending to it. The heart rejoices of its own accord, and naturally flows out into friend&s;hip and benevolence towards the per|&s;on who has &s;o kindly an effect upon it.</P>
<P N="6">6. When I con&s;ider this chearful &s;tate of mind in its third relation, I cannot but look upon it as a con|&s;tant habitual gratitude to the great Author of na|ture. An inward chearfulne&s;s is an implicit prai&s;e and thank&s;giving to Providence under all its di&s;pen|&s;ations. It is a kind of acquie&s;cence in the &s;tate wherein we are placed, and a &s;ecret approbation of the Divine will in his conduct towards man.</P>
<P N="7">7. There are but two things, which, in my opini|on, can rea&s;onably deprive us of this chearfulne&s;s of heart. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is the &s;en&s;e of guilt. A man who lives in a &s;tate of vice and impenitence can have no title to that evenne&s;s and tranquillity of mind which is the health of the &s;oul, and the natural effect of virtue and innocence. Chearfulne&s;s in an ill man de&s;erves a harder name than language can furni&s;h us with, and is many degrees beyond what we commonly call folly o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> madne&s;s.</P>
<P N="8">8. Athei&s;m, by which I mean a di&s;belief of a Su|preme Being, and con&s;equently of a future &s;tate,
<PB N="71" REF="020531_0076_0FAFE34E39767EB8">
under what&s;oever title it &s;helters it&s;elf, may likewi&s;e very rea&s;onably deprive a man of this chearfulne&s;s of temper. There is &s;omething &s;o particularly gloomy and offen&s;ive to human nature in the pro&s;pect of non-exi&s;tence, that I cannot but wonder, with many ex|cellent writers, how it is po&s;&s;ible for a man to outlive the expectation of it. For my own part, I think the being of a God is &s;o little to be doubted, that it is almo&s;t the only truth we are &s;ure of, and &s;uch a truth as we meet with in every object, in every occurrence, and in every thought.</P>
<P N="9">9. If we look into the characters of this tribe of infidels, we generally find they are made up of pride, &s;pleen, and cavil: it is indeed no wonder, that men, who are unea&s;y to them&s;elves, &s;hould be &s;o to the re&s;t of the world; and how is it po&s;&s;ible for a man to be otherwi&s;e than unea&s;y in him&s;elf, who is in danger every moment of lo&s;ing his entire exi&s;tence, and dropping into nothing?</P>
<P N="10">10. The vicious man and Athei&s;t have therefore no pretence to chearfulne&s;s, and would act very un|rea&s;onably, &s;hould they endeavour after it. It is im|po&s;&s;ible for any one to live in good humour, and en|joy his pre&s;ent exi&s;tence, who is apprehen&s;ive either of torment or of annihilation; of being mi&s;erable, or of not being at all.</P>
<P>After having mentioned the&s;e two great principles, which are de&s;tructive of chearfulne&s;s in their own na|ture, as well as in right rea&s;on, I cannot think of any other that ought to bani&s;h this happy temper from a virtuous mind. Pain and &s;ickne&s;s, &s;hame and reproach, poverty and old age, nay death it&s;elf, con|&s;idering the &s;hortne&s;s of their duration, and the ad|vantage we may reap from them, do not de&s;erve the name of evils.</P>
<P N="11">11. A good mind may bear up under them with for|titude, with indolence, and with chearfulne&s;s of heart. &mdash;The to&s;&s;ing of a tempe&s;t does not di&s;compo&s;e him, which he is &s;ure will bring him to a joyful harbour.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="020531_0077_0FAFE34EFAD56AA8">A man who u&s;es his be&s;t endeavours to live accord|ing to the dictates of virtue and right rea&s;on, has two perpetual &s;ources of chearfulne&s;s, in the con&s;i|deration of his own nature, and of that Being on whom he has a dependence.</P>
<P N="12">12. If he looks into him&s;elf, he cannot but rejoice in that exi&s;tence, which is &s;o lately be&s;towed upon him, and which, after millions of ages, will be &s;till new, and &s;till in its beginning. How many &s;elf-congratulations naturally ari&s;e in the mind, when it reflects on this its entrance into eternity, when it takes a view of tho&s;e improveable faculties, which in a few years, and even at its fir&s;t &s;etting out, have made &s;o con&s;iderable a progre&s;s, and which will be &s;till receiving an increa&s;e of perfection, and con&s;e|quently an increa&s;e of happine&s;s?</P>
<P N="13">13. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a being &s;preads a perpetual diffu&s;ion of joy through the &s;oul of a virtuous man, and makes him look upon him&s;elf every moment as more happy than he knows how to conceive.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ource of chearfulne&s;s to a good mind is, its con&s;ideration of that Being on whom we have our dependence, and in whom, though we behold him as yet but in the fir&s;t faint di&s;coveries of his per|fections, we &s;ee every thing that we can imagine as great, glorious, or amiable. We find our&s;elves every where upheld by his goodne&s;s, and &s;urrounded by an immen&s;ity of love and mercy.</P>
<P N="14">14. In &s;hort, we depend upon a Being, who&s;e power qualifies him to make us happy by an infinity of means, who&s;e goodne&s;s and truth engage him to make tho&s;e happy who de&s;ire it of him, and who&s;e unchangeable|ne&s;s will &s;ecure us in this happine&s;s to all eternity.</P>
<P>Such con&s;iderations, which every one &s;hould per|petually cheri&s;h in his thoughts, will bani&s;h from us all that &s;ecret heavine&s;s of heart which unthinking men are &s;ubject to when they lie under no real afflic|tion, all that angui&s;h which we may feel from any evil that actually oppre&s;&s;es us, to which I may like|wi&s;e

<HEAD>On the Advantages of a chearful Temper.</HEAD>
<BIBL>[Spect. No. 387.]</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. CHEARFULNESS is, in the fir&s;t place, the be&s;t promoter of health. Repining and &s;ecret murmurs of heart give imperceptible &s;trokes to tho&s;e delicate fibres of which the vital parts are compo&s;ed, and wear out the machine in&s;en&s;ibly; not to mention tho&s;e violent ferments which they &s;tir up in the blood, and tho&s;e irregular di&s;turbed motions, which they rai&s;e in the animal &s;pirits.</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;carce remember, in my own ob&s;ervation, to have met with many old men, or with &s;uch, who (to u&s;e our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> phra&s;e) <HI>wear well,</HI> that had not at lea&s;t a certain indolence in their humour, if not a more than ordinary gaiety and chearfulne&s;s of heart. The truth of it is, health and chearfulne&s;s mutually beget each other; with this difference, that we &s;el|dom meet with a great degree of health which is not attended with a certain chearfulne&s;s, but very often &s;ee chearfulne&s;s where there is no great degree of health.</P>
<P N="3">3. Chearfulne&s;s bears the &s;ame friendly regard to the mind as to the body: it bani&s;hes all anxious care and di&s;content, &s;ooths and compo&s;es the pa&s;&s;ions, and keeps the &s;oul in a perpetual calm. But, having al|ready touched on this la&s;t con&s;ideration, I &s;hall here take notice, that the world, in which we are placed, is filled with innumerable objects that are proper to rai&s;e and keep alive this happy temper of mind.</P>
<P N="4">4. If we con&s;ider the world in its &s;ub&s;erviency to man, one would think it was made for our u&s;e; but
<PB N="74" REF="020531_0079_0FAFE35078DB0208">
if we con&s;ider it in its natural beauty and harmony, one would be apt to conclude it was made for our plea&s;ure. The &s;un, which is as the great &s;oul of the univer&s;e, and produces all the nece&s;&s;aries of life, has a particular influence in chearing the mind of man, and making the heart glad.</P>
<P N="5">5. Tho&s;e &s;everal living creatures which are made for our &s;ervice or &s;u&s;tenance, at the &s;ame time either fill the woods with their mu&s;ic, furni&s;h us with game, or rai&s;e plea&s;ing ideas in us by the delightfulne&s;s of their appearance. Fountains, lakes, and rivers, are as refre&s;hing to the imagination, as to the &s;oil through which they pa&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">6. There are writers of great di&s;tinction, who have made it an argument for Providence, that the whole earth is covered with green, rather than with any other colour, as being &s;uch a right mixture of light and &s;hade, that it comforts and &s;trengthens the eye in&s;tead of weakening or grieving it. For this rea&s;on, &s;everal painters have a green cloth hanging near them, to ea&s;e the eye upon, after too great an application to their colouring.</P>
<P N="7">7. A famous modern philo&s;opher accounts for it in the following manner; all colours that are more lumi|nous, overpower and di&s;&s;ipate the animal &s;pirits which are employed in &s;ight: on the contrary, tho&s;e that are more ob&s;cure do not give the animal &s;pirits a &s;ufficient exerci&s;e; whereas the rays that produce in us the idea of green, fall upon the eye in &s;uch a due proportion, that they give the animal &s;pirits their proper play, and, by keeping up the &s;truggle in a ju&s;t balance, excite a very plea&s;ing and agreeable &s;en&s;ation. Let the cau&s;e be what it will, the effect is certain; for which rea&s;on, the poets a&s;cribe to this particular colour the epithet of <HI>chearful.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. To con&s;ider further this double end in the works of nature, and how they are, at the &s;ame time, both u&s;eful and entertaining, we find that the mo&s;t impor|tant parts in the vegetable world are tho&s;e which are
<PB N="75" REF="020531_0080_0FAFE351D4897DF8">
the mo&s;t beautiful. The&s;e are the &s;eeds by which the &s;everal races of plants are propagated and conti|nued, and which are always lodged in flowers or blo&s;|&s;oms. Nature &s;eems to hide her principal de&s;ign, and to be indu&s;trious in making the earth gay and delightful, while &s;he is carrying on her great work, and intent upon her own pre&s;ervation. The hu&s;band|man, after the &s;ame manner, is employed in laying out the whole country into a kind of garden or land|&s;kip, and making every thing &s;mile about him, whil&s;t, in reality, he thinks of nothing but of the harve&s;t and increa&s;e which is to ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P N="9">9. We may further ob&s;erve how Providence has taken care to keep up this chearfulne&s;s in the mind of man, by having formed it after &s;uch a manner, as to make it capable of conceiving delight from &s;eve|ral objects which &s;eem to have very little u&s;e in them; as from the wildne&s;s of rocks and de&s;arts, and the like grote&s;que parts of nature. Tho&s;e who are ver&s;ed in philo&s;ophy may &s;till carry this con&s;ideration high|er by ob&s;erving, that, if matter had appeared to us endowed only with tho&s;e real qualities which it actual|ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, it would have made but a very joyle&s;s and uncomfortable figure; and why has Providence given it a power of producing in us &s;uch imaginary quali|ties, as ta&s;tes and colours, &s;ounds and &s;mells, heat and cold, but that man, while he is conver&s;ant in the lower &s;tations of nature, might have his mind cheared and delighted with agreeable &s;en&s;ations? In &s;hort, the whole univer&s;e is a kind of theatre filled with objects that either rai&s;e in us plea&s;ure, amu&s;e|ment, or admiration.</P>
<P N="10">10.

<P>I &s;hall not here mention the &s;everal entertainments of art, with the plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip, books, con|ver&s;ation,

and other accidental diver&s;ions of life, becau&s;e I would only take notice of &s;uch incitements to a chearful temper, as offer them&s;elves to per&s;ons of all ranks and conditions, and which may &s;ufficiently &s;hew us, that Providence did not de&s;ign this world &s;hould be filled with murmurs and repinings, or that the heart of man &s;hould be involved in gloom and me|lancholy.</P>
<P N="11">11. I the more inculcate this chearfulne&s;s of tem|per, as it is a virtue in which our countrymen are ob&s;erved to be more deficient than any other nation. Melancholy is a kind of demon that haunts our i&s;land, and often conveys her&s;elf to us in an ea&s;terly wind. A celebrated <HI>French</HI> noveli&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e who begin their romances with a flowery &s;ea&s;on of the year, enters on his &s;tory thus: <HI>In the gloomy month of</HI> November, <HI>when the people of</HI> England <HI>hang and drown them&s;elves, a di&s;con&s;olate lover walked out into the fields,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="12">12. Every one ought to fence again&s;t the temper of his climate or con&s;titution, and frequently to in|dulge in him&s;elf tho&s;e con&s;iderations which may give him a &s;erenity of mind, and enable him to bear up chearfully again&s;t tho&s;e little evils and misfortunes which are common to human nature, and which, by a right improvement of them, will produce a &s;atiety of joy, and an uninterrupted happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="13">13. At the &s;ame time that I would engage my rea|der to con&s;ider the world in its mo&s;t agreeable lights, I mu&s;t own there are many evils which naturally &s;pring up amid&s;t the entertainments that are provi|ded for us; but the&s;e, if rightly con&s;idered, &s;hould be far from overca&s;ting the mind with &s;orrow, or de&s;troying that chearfulne&s;s of temper which I have been recommending.</P>
<P N="14">14. This inter&s;per&s;ion of evil with good, and pain with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, in the works of nature, is very truly a&s;cribed by Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> in his E&s;&s;ay upon Human Un|der&s;tanding, to a moral rea&s;on, in the following words:</P>

<HEAD>Di&s;cretion.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I HAVE often thought if the minds of men were laid open, we &s;hould &s;ee but little difference between that of the wi&s;e man and that of the fool. There are infinite reveries, numberle&s;s extravagan|cies, and a perpetual train of vanities, which pa&s;s through both. The great difference is, that the fir&s;t knows how to pick and cull his thoughts for conver|&s;ation, by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;ome, and communicating o|thers; whereas the other lets them all indifferently fly out in words. This &s;ort of di&s;cretion, however, has no place in private conver&s;ation between inti|mate friends. On &s;uch occa&s;ions the wi&s;e&s;t men very often talk like the weake&s;t; for indeed the talking with a friend is nothing el&s;e but thinking aloud.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Tully</HI> has therefore very ju&s;tly expo&s;ed a precept delivered by &s;ome ancient writers, that a man &s;hould live with his enemy in &s;uch a manner, as might leave him room to become his friend; and with his friend in &s;uch a manner, that if he became his enemy, it &s;hould not be in his power to hurt him. The fir&s;t part of this rule, which regards our behaviour to|wards an enemy, is indeed very rea&s;onable, as well as prudential; but the latter part of it, which re|gards
<PB N="78" REF="020531_0083_0FAFE35381DA1F00">
our behaviour towards a friend, &s;avours more of cunning than of di&s;cretion, and would cut a man off from the greate&s;t plea&s;ures of life, which are the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eedoms of conver&s;ation with a bo&s;om friend. Be|&s;ides, that when a friend is turned into an enemy, and (as the &s;on of <HI>Sirach</HI> calls him) a betrayer of &s;ecrets, the world is ju&s;t enough to accu&s;e the perfi|diou&s;ne&s;s of the friend, rather than the indi&s;cretion of the per&s;on who confided in him.</P>
<P N="3">3. Di&s;cretion does not only &s;hew it&s;elf in words, but in all the circum&s;tances of action; and is like an under-agent of Providence, to guide and direct us in the ordinary concerns of life.</P>
<P>There are many more &s;hining qualities in the mind of man, but there is none &s;o u&s;eful as di&s;cretion; it is this indeed which gives a value to all the re&s;t, which &s;ets them at work in their proper times and places, and turns them to the advantage of the per|&s;on&punc; who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them. Without it, learning is pedantry, and wit impertinence; virtue it&s;elf looks like weakne&s;s; the be&s;t parts only qualify a man to be more &s;prightly in errors, and active to his own prejudice.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nor does di&s;cretion only make a man the ma&s;|ter of his own parts, but of other men's. The di&s;|creet man finds out the talents of tho&s;e he conver&s;es with, and knows how to apply them to proper u&s;es. Accordingly, if we look into particular communities and divi&s;ions of men, we may ob&s;erve, that it is the di&s;creet man, not the witty, nor the learned, nor the brave, who guides the conver&s;ation, and gives mea|&s;ures to the &s;ociety. A man with great talents, but void of di&s;cretion, is like <HI>Polyphemus</HI> in the fable, &s;trong and blind, endued with an irre&s;i&s;tible force, which, for want of &s;ight, is of no u&s;e to him.</P>
<P N="5">5. Though a man has all other perfections, and wants di&s;cretion, he will be of no great con&s;equence in the world; but if he has this &s;ingle talent in per|fection, and but a common &s;hare of others, he may do what he plea&s;es in his &s;tation of life.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="020531_0084_0FAFE3543B2D4AC0">At the &s;ame time that I think di&s;cretion the mo&s;t u&s;eful talent a man can be ma&s;ter of, I look upon cunning to be the accompli&s;hment of little, mean, ungenerous minds. Di&s;cretion points out the noble&s;t ends to us, and pur&s;ues the mo&s;t proper and laudable methods of attaining them: cunning has only pri|vate &s;elfi&s;h aims, and &s;ticks at nothing which may make them &s;ucceed.</P>
<P N="6">6. Di&s;cretion has large and extended views, and, like a well-formed eye, commands a whole horizon: cunning is a kind of &s;hort-&s;ightedne&s;s, that di&s;covers the minute&s;t objects which are near at hand, but is not able to di&s;cern things at a di&s;tance. Di&s;cretion, the more it is di&s;covered, gives a greater authority to the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it: cunning, when it is once detected, lo&s;es its force, and makes a man in|capable of bringing about even tho&s;e events which he might have done, had he pa&s;&s;ed only for a plain man. Di&s;cretion is the perfection of rea&s;on, and a guide to us in all the duties of life: cunning is a kind of in&s;tinct, that only looks out after our imme|diate intere&s;t and welfare.</P>
<P N="7">7. Di&s;cretion is only found in men of &s;trong &s;en&s;e and good under&s;tandings: cunning is often to be met with in brutes them&s;elves, and in per&s;ons who are but the fewe&s;t removes from them. In &s;hort, cunning is only the mimic of di&s;cretion, and may pa&s;s upon weak men, in the &s;ame manner as vivacity is often mi&s;taken for wit, and gravity for wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>The ca&s;t of mind which is natural to a di&s;creet man, makes him look forward into futurity, and con&s;ider what will be his condition millions of ages hence, as well as what it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="8">8. He knows, that the mi&s;ery or happine&s;s which are re&s;erved for him in another world, lo&s;e nothing of their reality by being placed at &s;o great a di&s;tance from him. The objects do not appear little to him becau&s;e they are remote. He con&s;iders that tho&s;e plea&s;ures and pains which lie hid in eternity, ap|proach

nearer to him every moment, and will be pre&s;ent with him in their full weight and mea&s;ure, as much as tho&s;e pains and plea&s;ures which he feels at this very in&s;tant. For this rea&s;on he is careful to &s;ecure to him&s;elf that which is the proper happine&s;s of his nature, and the ultimate de&s;ign of his being.</P>
<P N="9">9. He carries his thoughts to the end of every ac|tion, and con&s;iders the mo&s;t di&s;tant as well as the mo&s;t immediate effects of it. He &s;uper&s;edes every little pro&s;pect of gain and advantage which offers it|&s;elf here, if he does not find it con&s;i&s;tent with his views of an hereafter. In a word, his hopes are full of immortality, his &s;chemes are large and glo|rious, and his conduct &s;uitable to one who knows his true intere&s;t, and how to pur&s;ue it by proper methods.</P>
<P N="10">10. I have, in this e&s;&s;ay upon di&s;cretion, con&s;idered it both as an accompli&s;hment and as a virtue, and have therefore de&s;cribed it in its full extent; not on|ly as it is conver&s;ant about worldly affairs, but as it regards our whole exi&s;tence; not only as it is the guide of a mortal creature, but as it is in general the director of a rea&s;onable being. It is in this light that di&s;cretion is repre&s;ented by the wi&s;e man, who &s;ometimes mentions it under the name of di&s;|cretion, and &s;ometimes under that of wi&s;dom.</P>

<P N="1">1. THERE is no pa&s;&s;ion which &s;teals into the heart more imperceptibly, and covers it&s;elf under more di&s;gui&s;es, than pride. For my own part, I think if there is any pa&s;&s;ion or vice which I am wholly a &s;tranger to, it is this; though at the &s;ame time, perhaps this very judgment which I form of my&s;elf, proceeds, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, from this corrupt principle.</P>
<P N="2">2. I have been always wonderfully delighted with that &s;entence in holy writ, <HI>Pride was not made for man.</HI> There is not indeed any &s;ingle view of human nature under its pre&s;ent condition, which is not &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h in us all the &s;ecret &s;eeds of pride; and, on the contrary, to &s;ink the &s;oul into the lowe&s;t &s;tate of humility, and what the &s;chool-men call &s;elf-anni|hilation. Pride was not made for man, as he is,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A &s;inful,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. An ignorant,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. A mi&s;erable being.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>There is nothing in his under&s;tanding, in his will, or in his pre&s;ent condition, that can tempt any con|&s;iderate creature to pride or vanity.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e three very rea&s;ons why he &s;hould not be proud, are notwith&s;tanding the rea&s;ons why he is &s;o. Were not he a &s;inful creature, he would not be &s;ub|ject to a pa&s;&s;ion which ri&s;es from the depravity of his nature; were he not an ignorant creature, he would &s;ee that he has nothing to be proud of; and were not the whole &s;pecies mi&s;erable, he would not have tho&s;e wretched objects before his eyes, which are the oc|ca&s;ions
<PB N="82" REF="020531_0087_0FAFE3567ADAC5C0">
of this pa&s;&s;ion&punc; and which make one man va|lue him&s;elf more than another.</P>
<P N="4">4. A wi&s;e man will be contented that his glory be deferred till &s;uch time as he &s;hall be truly glorified; when his under&s;tanding &s;hall be cleared, his will rectified, and his happine&s;s a&s;&s;ured; or in other words, when he &s;hall be neither &s;inful, nor ignorant, nor mi&s;erable.</P>
<P N="5">5. If there be any thing which makes human na|ture appear <HI>ridiculous</HI> to beings of &s;uperior faculties, it mu&s;t be pride. They know &s;o well the vanity of tho&s;e imaginary perfections that &s;well the heart of man, and of tho&s;e little &s;upernumerary advantages, whether in birth, fortune, or title, which one man enjoys above another, that it mu&s;t certainly very much a&s;toni&s;h, if it does not very much divert them, when they &s;ee a mortal puffed up, and valuing him|&s;elf above his neighbours on any of the&s;e accounts, at the &s;ame time that he is obnoxious to all the com|mon calamities of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P N="6">6. To &s;et this thought in its true light, we will fancy, if you plea&s;e, that yonder mole-hill is inha|bited by rea&s;onable creatures, and that every pi&s;mire (his &s;hape and way of life only excepted) is endowed with human pa&s;&s;ions. How &s;hould we &s;mile to hear one give us an account of the pedigrees, di&s;tinctions, and titles that reign among them!</P>
<P N="7">7. Ob&s;erve how the whole &s;warm divide and make way for the pi&s;mire that pa&s;&s;es through them! You mu&s;t under&s;tand he is an emmet of quality, and has better blood in his veins than any pi&s;mire in the mole-hill.&mdash;Don't you &s;ee how &s;en&s;ible he is of it, how &s;low he marches forward, how the whole rabble of ants keep their di&s;tance?</P>
<P N="8">8. Here you may ob&s;erve one placed upon a little eminence, and looking down on a long row of la|bourers. He is the riche&s;t in&s;ect on this &s;ide the hil|lock, he has a walk of half a yard in length, and a quarter of an inch in breadth, he keeps a hundred

menial &s;ervants, and has at lea&s;t fifteen barley-corns in his granary. He is now chiding, and be&s;laving the emmet that &s;tands before him, and who, for all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an di&s;cover, is as good an emmet as him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="9">9. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> here comes an in&s;ect of figure! don't you take notice of a little white &s;traw that he carries in his mouth? That &s;traw, you mu&s;t under&s;tand, he would not part with for the longe&s;t tract about the mole-hill: did you but know what he has undergone to purcha&s;e it! See how the ants of all qualities and conditions &s;warm about him! Should this &s;traw drop out of his mouth, you would &s;ee all this numerous circle of attendants follow the next that took it up, and leave the di&s;carded in&s;ect, or run over his back to come at his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P N="10">10. If now you have a mind to &s;ee all the ladies of the mole-hill, ob&s;erve fir&s;t the pi&s;mire that li&s;tens to the emmet on her left-hand, at the &s;ame time that &s;he &s;eems to turn away her head from him. He tells this poor in&s;ect that &s;he is a godde&s;s, that her eyes are brighter than the &s;un, that life and death are at her di&s;po&s;al. She believes him, and gives her&s;elf a thou&s;and little airs upon it.</P>
<P N="11">11. Mark the vanity of the pi&s;mire on your left-hand. She can &s;carce crawl with age; but you mu&s;t know &s;he values her&s;elf upon her birth; and if you mind, &s;purns at every one that comes within her reach. The little nimble coquette that is running along by the &s;ide of her, is a wit. She has broke many a pi&s;mire's heart. Do but ob&s;erve what a drove of lovers are running after her.</P>
<P N="12">12. We will here fini&s;h this imaginary &s;cene; but fir&s;t of all to draw the parallel clo&s;er, will &s;uppo&s;e, if you plea&s;e, that death comes down upon the mole-hill, in the &s;hape of a cock-&s;parrow, who picks up, without di&s;tinction, the pi&s;mire of quality and his flatterers, the pi&s;mire of &s;ub&s;tance and his day la|bourers, the white &s;traw officer and his &s;ycophants, with all the godde&s;&s;es, wits, and beauties of the mole-hill.</P>

<HEAD>Drunkenne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. NO vices are &s;o incurable as tho&s;e which men are apt to glory in. One would wonder how drunkenne&s;s &s;hould have the good luck to be of this number. <HI>Anarchar&s;is,</HI> being invited to a match of drinking at Corinth, demanded the prize very humourou&s;ly, becau&s;e he was drunk before any of the re&s;t of the company; for, &s;ays he, when we run a race, he who arrives at the gaol fir&s;t, is entitled to the reward:</P>
<P N="2">2. On the contrary, in this thir&s;ty generation, the honour falls upon him who carries off the greate&s;t quantity of liquor, and knocks down the re&s;t of the company. I was the other day with hone&s;t <HI>Will Funnell,</HI> the We&s;t-Saxon, who was reckoning up how much liquor had pa&s;t through him in the la&s;t twenty years of his life, which, according to his computa|tion, amounted to twenty-three hog&s;heads o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> october, four ton of port, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a kilderkin of &s;mall-beer, nine|teen barrels of cyder, and three gla&s;&s;es of champagne; be&s;ides which he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at four hundred bowls of punch, not to mention &s;ips, drams, and whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s with|out number.</P>
<P N="3">3. I que&s;tion not but every reader's memory will &s;ugge&s;t to him &s;everal ambitious young men, who are as vain in this particular as <HI>Will Funnell,</HI> and can boa&s;t of a glorious exploits.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="020531_0090_0FAFE358B9E6F3C8">Our modern philo&s;ophers ob&s;erve, that there is a general decay of moi&s;ture in the globe of the earth. This they chiefly a&s;cribe to the growth of vegetables, which incorporate into their own &s;ub&s;tance many fluid bodies that never return again to their former nature:</P>
<P N="4">4. But with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they ought to throw into their account, tho&s;e innumerable rational beings which fetch their nouri&s;hment chiefly out of liquids; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that men, compared with their fellow-creatures, drink much more than comes to their &s;hare.</P>
<P N="5">5. But however highly this tribe of people may think of them&s;elves, a drunken man is a greater mon&s;ter than any that is to be found among all the creatures which God has made; as indeed there is no character which appears more de&s;picable and de|formed, in the eyes of all rea&s;onable per&s;ons, than that of a drunkard.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Bono&s;us</HI> one of our own countrymen, who was addicted to this vice, having &s;et up for a &s;hare in the Roman empire, and being defeated in a great battle, hanged him&s;elf. When he was &s;een by the army in this melancholy &s;ituation, notwith&s;tanding he had behaved him&s;elf very bravely, the common je&s;t was, that the thing they &s;aw hanging upon the tree before them, was not a man, but a bottle.</P>
<P N="7">7. This vice has very fatal effects on the mind, the body, and fortune of the per&s;on who is devoted to it.</P>
<P>In regard to the mind, it fir&s;t of all di&s;covers every flaw in it. The &s;ober man, by the &s;trength of rea&s;on, may keep under and &s;ubdue every vice or folly to which he is mo&s;t inclined; but wine makes every la|tent &s;eed &s;prout up in the &s;oul, and &s;hew it&s;elf: it gives fury to the pa&s;&s;ions, and force to tho&s;e objects which are apt to produce them.</P>
<P N="8">8. When a young fellow complained to an old phi|lo&s;opher that his wife was not hand&s;ome, Put le&s;s water in your wine, &s;ays the philo&s;opher, and you'll quickly make her &s;o. Wine heightens indifference
<PB N="86" REF="020531_0091_0FAFE35981FFC7A0">
into love, love into jealou&s;y, and jealou&s;y into mad|ne&s;s. It often turns the good-natured man into an idiot, and the choleric into an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. It gives bit|terne&s;s to re&s;entment, it makes vanity in&s;upportable, and di&s;plays every little &s;pot of the &s;oul in its utmo&s;t deformity.</P>
<P N="9">9. Nor does this vice only betray the hidden fault<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a man, and &s;hew them in the mo&s;t odious colours, but often occa&s;ions faults to which he is not naturally &s;ubject. There is more of turn than of truth in a &s;aying of <HI>Seneca,</HI> that drunkenne&s;s does not produce, but di&s;cover faults. Common experience teaches the contrary.</P>
<P N="10">10. Wine throws a man out of him&s;elf, and infu|&s;es qualities into the mind, which &s;he is a &s;tranger to in her &s;ober moments. The per&s;on you conver&s;e with, after the third bottle, is not the &s;ame man who at fir&s;t &s;at down at the table with you. Upon this max|im is founded one of the prettie&s;t &s;ayings I ever met with, which is in&s;cribed to <HI>Publius Syrus, He who je&s;ts upon a man that is drunk, injures the ab&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Thus does drunkenne&s;s act in direct contradic|tion to rea&s;on, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to clear the mind of every vice which is crept into it, and to guard it again&s;t all the approaches of any that endeavour to make its entrance. But be&s;ides the&s;e ill effects which this vice produces in the per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on who is actually under its dominion, it has al&s;o a bad influence on the mind, even in its &s;ober moments, as it in&s;en&s;ibly weakens the under&s;tanding, impaires the memory, and makes tho&s;e faults habitual which are produced by frequent exce&s;&s;es: it wa&s;tes the e&s;tate, bani&s;hes reputation, con&s;umes the body, and renders a man of the bright|e&s;t parts the common je&s;t of an in&s;ignificant clown.</P>
<P N="12">12. A method of &s;pending one's time agreeably is a thing &s;o little &s;tudied, that the common amu&s;ement of our young gentlemen (e&s;pecially of &s;uch as are at a di&s;tance from tho&s;e of the fir&s;t breeding) is drinking. This way o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> entertainment has cu&s;tom on its &s;ide; but
<PB N="87" REF="020531_0092_0FAFE35A38ED3630">
as much as it has prevailed, I believe there have been very few companies that have been guilty of exce&s;s this way, where there have not happened more accidents which make again&s;t, than for the continuance of it.</P>
<P N="13">13. It is very common that events ari&s;e from a de|bauch, which are fatal, and always &s;uch as are di&s;a|greeable. With all a man's rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e about him, his tongue is apt to utter things out of a mere gaiety of heart, which may di&s;plea&s;e his be&s;t friends. Who then would tru&s;t him&s;elf to the power of wine, without &s;aying more again&s;t it, than that it rai&s;es the imagination and depre&s;&s;es the judgment?</P>
<P N="14">14. Were there only this &s;ingle con&s;ideration, that we are le&s;s ma&s;ters of our&s;elves when we drink in the lea&s;t proportion above the exigences of thir&s;t; I &s;ay, were this all that could be objected, it were &s;ufficient to make us abhor this vice. But we may go on to &s;ay, that as he who drinks but a little is not ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, &s;o he who drinks much is a &s;lave to him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="15">15. As for my part, I ever e&s;teemed a drunkard of all vicious per&s;ons the mo&s;t vicious: for if our actions are to be weighed and con&s;idered according to the in|tention of them, what can we think of him who puts him&s;elf into a circum&s;tance wherein he can have no intention at all, but incapacitates him&s;elf for the du|ties and offices of life, by a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all his facul|ties.</P>
<P N="16">16. If a man con&s;iders that he cannot, under the oppre&s;&s;ion of drink, be a friend, a gentleman, a ma&s;ter, or a &s;ubject; that he has &s;o long bani&s;hed him&s;elf from all that is dear, and given up all that is &s;acred to him, he would even then think of a debauch with horror: but when he looks &s;till further, and acknowledges that he is not only expelled out of all the relations of life, but al&s;o liable to offend again&s;t them all, what words can expre&s;s the terror and de|te&s;tation he would have of &s;uch a condition? And yet he owns all this of him&s;elf who &s;ays he was drunk la&s;t night.</P>
<P N="17"><PB N="88" REF="020531_0093_0FAFE35BA992CE98">17. As I have all along per&s;i&s;ted in it, that all the vicious in general are in a &s;tate of death, &s;o I think I may add to the non-exi&s;tence of drunkards, that they died by their own hands. He is certainly as guilty of &s;uicide who peri&s;hes by a &s;low, as he that is di&s;patched by an immediate poi&s;on.</P>
<P N="18">18. In my la&s;t lucubration I propo&s;ed the general u&s;e of water-gruel, and hinted that it might not be ami&s;s at this very &s;ea&s;on: but as there are &s;ome, who&s;e ca&s;es, in regard to their families, will not admit of delay, I have u&s;ed my intere&s;t in &s;everal wards of the city, that the whole&s;ome re&s;torative above-mentioned may be given in tavern-kitchens to all the mornings draught men within the walls when they call for wine before noon.</P>
<P N="19">19. For a further re&s;traint and mark upon &s;uch per&s;ons, I have given orders, that in all the offices where policies are drawn upon lives, it &s;hall be ad|ded to the article which prohibits that the nominee &s;hould cro&s;s the &s;ee, the words, <HI>Provided al&s;o, That the abovementioned,</HI> A. B. <HI>&s;hall not drink before dinner during the term mentioned in this indenture.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. I am not without hopes that by this method I &s;hall bring &s;ome un&s;izeable friends of mine into &s;hape and breadth, as well as others who are languid and con&s;umptive, into health and vigour. Mo&s;t of the &s;elf-murderers whom I yet hinted at, are &s;uch as pre&s;erve a certain regularity in taking their poi&s;on, and make it mix pretty well with their food:</P>
<P N="21">21. But the mo&s;t con&s;picuous of tho&s;e who de&s;troy them&s;elves, are &s;uch as in their youth fall into this &s;ort of debauchery, and contract a certain unea&s;ine&s;s of &s;pirit, which is not to be diverted but by tippling as often as they can fall into company in the day, and conclude with downright drunkenne&s;s at night. The&s;e gentlemen never know the &s;atisfaction of youth, but &s;kip the years of manhood, and are decrepit &s;oon after they are of age.</P>
<P N="22"><PB N="89" REF="020531_0094_0FAFE35BB97D77E0">22. I was godfather to one of the&s;e old fellows. He is now three and thirty, which is the grand cli|macteric of a young drunkard. I went to vi&s;it the crazy wretch this morning, with no other purpo&s;e, but to rally him, under the pain and unea&s;ine&s;s of being &s;ober.</P>
<P>But as our faults are double when they affect others be&s;ides our&s;elves, &s;o this vice is &s;till more odious in a married than a &s;ingle man.</P>
<P N="23">23. He that is the hu&s;band of a woman of honour, and comes home overloaded with wine, is &s;till more contemptible, in proportion to the regard we have to the unhappy con&s;ort of his be&s;tiality. The ima|gination cannot &s;hape to it&s;elf any thing more mon|&s;trous and unnatural, than the familiarities between drunkenne&s;s and cha&s;tity. The wretched <HI>A&s;traea,</HI> who is the perfection of beauty and innocence, has long been thus condemned for life. The romantic tales of virgins devoted to the jaws of mon&s;ters, have nothing in them &s;o terrible, as the gift of <HI>A&s;traea</HI> to that bacchanal.</P>
<P N="24">24. The reflection of &s;uch a match as &s;potle&s;s inno|cence with abandoned lewdne&s;s, is what puts this vice in the wor&s;t figure it can bear with regard to others; but when it is looked upon with re&s;pect only to the drunkard him&s;elf, it has deformities enough to make it di&s;agreeable, which may be &s;ummed up in a word, by allowing, that he who re&s;igns his rea&s;on, is actu|ally guilty of all that he is liable to from the want of rea&s;on.</P>

<P N="3">3. I &s;hould ill de&s;erve the name of <HI>Guardian,</HI> did I not caution all my fair wards again&s;t a practice, which, when it runs to exce&s;s, is the mo&s;t &s;hameful, but one, that the female world can fall into. The ill con&s;equences of it are more than can be contained in this paper. However, that I may proceed in me|thod, I &s;hall con&s;ider them. Fir&s;t, as they relate to the mind. Secondly, as they relate to the body.</P>
<P N="4">4. Could we look into the mind of a female game|&s;ter, we &s;hould &s;ee it full of nothing but trumps and mattadores. Her &s;lumbers are haunted with kings, queens, and knaves. The day lies heavy upon her 'till the play-&s;ea&s;on returns, when for half a dozen hours together, all her faculties are employed in &s;huffling, cutting, dealing and &s;orting out a pack of cards; and no ideas to be di&s;covered in a &s;oul which calls it&s;elf rational, excepting little &s;quare figures of painted and &s;potted paper.</P>
<P N="5">5. Was the under&s;tanding, that divine part in our compo&s;ition, given for &s;uch an u&s;e? Is it thus that

we improve the greate&s;t talent human nature is en|dued with? What would a &s;uperior being think, were he &s;hown this intellectual faculty in a female game|&s;ter, and at the &s;ame time told, that it was by this &s;he was di&s;tingui&s;hed from brutes, and allied to angels?</P>
<P N="6">6. When our women thus fill their imaginations with pips and counters, I cannot wonder at the &s;tory I have lately heard of a new-born child that was marked with the five of clubs.</P>
<P>Their pa&s;&s;ions &s;uffer no le&s;s by this practice than their under&s;tandings and imaginations. What hope and fear, joy and anger, &s;orrow and di&s;content, break out all at once in a fair a&s;&s;embly upon &s;o noble an occa&s;ion as that of turning up a card?</P>
<P N="7">7. Who can con&s;ider, without a &s;ecret indignation, that all tho&s;e affections of the mind which &s;hould be con&s;ecrated to their children, hu&s;bands, and parents, are thus vilely pro&s;tituted and thrown away upon a hand at loo? For my own part, I cannot but be grie|ved, when I &s;ee a fine woman fretting and bleeding inwardly from &s;uch trivial motives: when I behold the face of an angel, agitated and di&s;compo&s;ed by the heart of a fury.</P>
<P N="8">8. Our minds are of &s;uch a make, that they na|turally give them&s;elves up to every diver&s;ion which they are much accu&s;tomed to, and we always find, that play, when followed with a&s;&s;iduity, engro&s;&s;es the whole woman.

out of humour, is angry with every body, di&s;plea&s;ed with all I can do or &s;ay, and in reality for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e &s;he has been throwing away my e&s;tate. What charming bed-fellows and compani|ons for life are men likely to meet with, that chu&s;e their wives out of &s;uch women of vogue and fa&s;hion? What a race of worthies, what patriots, what heroes mu&s;t we expect from mothers of this make?</P>
<P N="11">11. I come in the next place to con&s;ider the ill con&s;equences which gaming has on the bodies of our female adventurers. It is &s;o ordered, that almo&s;t e|very thing which corrupts the &s;oul decays the body. The beauties of the face and mind are generally de|&s;troyed by the &s;ame means. This con&s;ideration &s;hould have a particular weight with the female world, who are de&s;igned to plea&s;e the eye and attract the regards of the other half of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P N="12">12. Now there is nothing that wears out a fine face like the vigils of the card table, and tho&s;e cutting pa&s;&s;ions which naturally attend them. Hollow eyes, haggard looks, and pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e complexions, are the natu|ral indications of a female game&s;ter. Her morning &s;leeps are not able to repair her midnight watchings.</P>
<P N="13">13. I have known a woman carried off half dead from ba&s;&s;et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and have many a time grieved, to &s;ee a per&s;on of quality gliding by me in her chair at two o'clock in the morning, and looking like a &s;pectre amid&s;t a glare of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ambeaux: in &s;hort, I never knew a thorough-paced female game&s;ter hold her beauty two winters together.</P>
<P N="14">14. But there is &s;till another ca&s;e in which the bo|dy is more endangered than in the former. All play-debts mu&s;t be paid in &s;pecie, or by an equivalent. The man that plays beyond his income pawns his e&s;tate; the woman mu&s;t find out &s;omething el&s;e to mortgage when her pin-money is gone. The hu&s;|band has his lands to di&s;po&s;e of, the wife her per&s;on.

<P N="15"><PB N="93" REF="020531_0098_0FAFE35EB9E7CAA0">15.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. AS the ladies are naturally become the imme|diate objects of your care, will you permit a complaint to be in&s;erted in your paper, which is founded upon a matter of fact? They will pardon me, if by laying before you a particular in&s;tance I was lately witne&s;s to of their improper behaviour, I endeavour to expo&s;e a reigning evil, which &s;ubjects them to many &s;hameful imputations.</P>
<P N="2">2. I received la&s;t week a dinner card from a friend, with an intimation that I &s;hould meet &s;ome very a|greeable ladies. At my arrival, I found that the company con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of females, who indeed did me the honour to ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, but quite di&s;concerted me in paying my re&s;pects, by their whi&s;pering each o|ther, and appearing to &s;tifle a laugh. When I was &s;eated, the ladies grouped them&s;elves up in a corner, and entered into a private cabal, &s;eemingly to di&s;|cour&s;e upon points of great &s;ecrecy and importance, but of equal merriment and diver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;ame conduct of keeping clo&s;e to their ranks was ob&s;erved at table, where the ladies &s;eated them&s;elves together. Their conver&s;ation was here
<PB N="94" REF="020531_0099_0FAFE28FCD10C5B8">
al&s;o confined wholly to them&s;elves, and &s;eemed like the my&s;teries of the <HI>Bona Dea,</HI> in which men were forbidden to have any &s;hare. It was a continued laugh and a whi&s;per from the beginning to the end of dinner. A whole &s;entence was &s;carce ever &s;poken aloud.</P>
<P N="4">4. Single words, indeed, now and then broke forth; &s;uch as <HI>odious, horrible, dete&s;table, &s;hocking,</HI> HUMBUG. This la&s;t new-coined expre&s;&s;ion, which is only to be found in the non&s;en&s;ical vocabulary, &s;ounds ab&s;urd and di&s;agreeable, whenever it is pro|nounced; but from the mouth of a lady it is "&s;hock|ing, dete&s;table, horrible and odious."</P>
<P N="5">5. My friend &s;eemed to be in an unea&s;y &s;ituation at his own table; but I was far more mi&s;erable. I was mute, and &s;eldom da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to lift up my eyes from my plate, or turn my head <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o call for &s;mall beer, le&s;t by &s;ome aukward po&s;ture I might draw upon me a whi&s;per or a laugh. <HI>Sancho,</HI> when he was forbid to eat of a delicious banquet &s;et before him, could &s;ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e appear more melancholy.</P>
<P N="6">6. The rueful length of my face might po&s;&s;ibly increa&s;e the mirth of my tormentors: at lea&s;t their joy &s;eemed to ri&s;e in exact proportion with my mi&s;ery. At length, however, the time of my delivery ap|proached. Dinner ended, the ladies made their ex|it in pairs, and went off hand in hand whi&s;pering like the two kings of <HI>Brentford.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Mode&s;t men, Mr. <HI>Town,</HI> are deeply wounded, when they imagine them&s;elves the objects of ridicule or contempt: and the pain is the greater, when it is given by tho&s;e whom they admire, and from whom they are ambitious of receiving any marks of coun|tenance and favour. Yet we mu&s;t allow, that af|fronts are pardonable from ladies, as they are often progno&s;tics of future kindne&s;s.</P>
<P N="8">8. If a lady &s;trikes our cheek, we can very wil|lingly follow the precept of the Go&s;pel, and turn the other cheek to be &s;mitten: even a blow from a fair
<PB N="95" REF="020531_0100_0FAFE29092B36638">
hand conveys plea&s;ure. But this battery of whi&s;pers is again&s;t all legal rights of war; poi&s;oned arrows, and &s;tabs in the dark, are not more repugnant to the general laws of humanity.</P>
<P N="9">9. Modern writers of comedy often introduce a pert witling into their pieces, who is very &s;evere up|on the re&s;t of the company; but all his waggery is &s;poken <HI>a&s;ide.</HI>&mdash;The&s;e gigglers and whi&s;perers &s;eem to be acting the &s;ame part in company, that this arch rogue does in the play. Every word or motion pro|duces a train of whi&s;pers; the dropping of a &s;nuff-box, or &s;pilling the tea, is &s;ure to be accompanied with a titter; and upon the entrance of any one with &s;omething particular in his per&s;on or manner, I have &s;een a whole room in a buzz like a bee-hive.</P>
<P N="10">10. This practice of whi&s;pering, if it is any where allowable, may perhaps be indulged the fair &s;ex at church, where the conver&s;ation can only be carried on by the &s;ecret &s;ymbols of a curt&s;y, an ogle, or a nod. A whi&s;per in this place is very often of great u&s;e, as it &s;erves to convey the mo&s;t &s;ecret intelligence, which a lady would be ready to bur&s;t with&punc; if &s;he could not find vent for it by this kind of auricular confe&s;&s;ion. A piece of &s;candal tran&s;pires in this man|ner from one pew to the other, then pre&s;ently whiz|zes along the channel, from whence it crawls up to the galleries, till at la&s;t the whole church hums with it.</P>
<P N="11">11. It were al&s;o to be wi&s;hed, that the ladies would be plea&s;ed to confine them&s;elves to whi&s;pering, in their <HI>t&ecirc;te-a-t&ecirc;te</HI> conferences at an opera or the play-hou&s;e; which would be a proper deference to the re&s;t of the audience. In <HI>France,</HI> we are told, it is common for the <HI>parterre</HI> to join with the perfor|mers in any favourite air: but we &s;eem to have car|ried this cu&s;tom &s;till further, as the company in our boxes, without concerning them&s;elves in the lea&s;t with the play, are even louder than the players.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="96" REF="020531_0101_0FAFE29142007380">12. The wit and humour of a <HI>Vanbrugh,</HI> or a <HI>Con|gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve,</HI> is frequently interrupted by a brilliant dia|logue between two per&s;ons of fa&s;hion; and a love &s;cene in the &s;ide-box has often been more attended to, than that on the &s;tage. As to their loud bur&s;ts of laughter at the theatre, they may very well be excu|&s;ed, when they are excited by any lively &s;trokes in a comedy: but I have &s;een our ladies titter at the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful &s;cenes in <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> grin over the angui&s;h of a <HI>Monimia</HI> or <HI>Belvidera,</HI> and fairly laugh king <HI>Lear</HI> off the &s;tage.</P>
<P N="13">13. Thus the whole behaviour of the&s;e ladies is in direct contradiction to good-manners. They laugh when they &s;hould cry, are loud when they &s;hould be &s;ilent, and are &s;ilent when their conver&s;ation is de|&s;irable. If a man in a &s;elect company was thus to laugh or whi&s;per me out of countenance, I &s;hould be apt to con&s;true it as an affront, and demand an explanation.</P>
<P N="14">14. As to the ladies, I would de&s;ire them to reflect how much they would &s;uffer, if their own weapons were turned again&s;t them, and the gentlemen &s;hould attack them with the &s;ame arts of laughing and whi&s;pering. But, however free they may be from our re&s;entment, they are &s;till open to ill-natured &s;u&s;|picions. They do not con&s;ider, what &s;trange con|&s;tructions may be put on the&s;e laughs and whi&s;pers.</P>
<P N="15">15. It were, indeed, of little con&s;equence, if we only imagined, that they were taking the reputation of their acquaintance to pieces, or abu&s;ing the com|pany round; but when they indulge them&s;elves in this behaviour, &s;ome perhaps may be led to conclude, that they are di&s;cour&s;ing upon topics, which they are a&s;hamed to &s;peak of in a le&s;s private manner.</P>
<P N="16">16. If the mi&s;conduct, which I have de&s;cribed, had been only to be found, Mr. <HI>Town,</HI> at my friend's ta|ble, I &s;hould not have troubled you with this letter: but the &s;ame kind of ill breeding prevails too often, and in too many places. The gigglers and the whi&s;|perers
<PB N="97" REF="020531_0102_0FAFE2920411E2A8">
are innumerable; they be&s;et us wherever we go; and it is ob&s;ervable, that after a &s;hort murmur of whi&s;pers, out comes the bur&s;t of laughter: like a gun-powder &s;erpent, which, after hi&s;&s;ing about for &s;ome time, goes off in a bounce.</P>
<P N="17">17. Some excu&s;e may perhaps be framed for this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll-timed merriment in the fair &s;ex. <HI>Venus,</HI> the god|de&s;s of beauty, is frequently called the <HI>laughter-loving dame</HI>; and by laughing, our modern ladies may po&s;&s;i|bly imagine, that they render them&s;elves like <HI>Venus.</HI> I have indeed remarked, that the ladies commonly adju&s;t their laugh to their per&s;ons, and are merry in proportion as it &s;ets off their particular charms.</P>
<P N="18">18. One lady is never further moved than to a &s;mile or a &s;imper, becau&s;e nothing el&s;e &s;hews her dim|ples to &s;o much advantage; another, who has a very fine &s;et of teeth, runs into a broad grin; while a third, who is admired for a well turned neck and graceful che&s;t, calls up all her beauties to view by breaking into violent and repeated peals of laughter.</P>
<P N="19">19. I would not be under&s;tood to impo&s;e gravity or too great a re&s;erve on the fair &s;ex. Let them laugh at a feather; but let them declare openly, that it is a feather which occa&s;ions their mirth. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that laughter becomes the young, the gay, and the hand&s;ome: but a whi&s;per is unbecoming at all ages, and in both &s;exes; nor ought it ever to be practi&s;ed, except in the round gallery at St. <HI>Paul's,</HI> or in the famous whi&s;pering place in <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> cathedral, where two whi&s;perers hear each other at the di&s;tance of five-and-twenty yards.</P>

<HEAD>Beauty.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THOUGH the danger of di&s;appointment is always in proportion to the height of ex|pectation, yet I this day claim the attention of the ladies, and profe&s;s to teach an art by which all may obtain what has hitherto been deemed the prerogative of a few: an art by which their predominant pa&s;&s;ion may be gratified, and their conque&s;ts not only extend|ed, but &s;ecured; "The art of being PRETTY."</P>
<P N="2">2. But though my &s;ubject may intere&s;t the ladies, it may, perhaps, offend tho&s;e profound morali&s;ts, who have long &s;ince determined, that beauty ought rather to be de&s;pi&s;ed than de&s;ired; that, like &s;trength, it is a mere natural excellence, the effect of cau&s;es wholly out of our power, and not intended either as the pledge of happine&s;s or the di&s;tinction of merit.</P>
<P N="3">3. To the&s;e gentlemen I &s;hall remark, that beauty is among tho&s;e qualities, which no effort of human wit could ever bring into contempt: it is therefore to be wi&s;hed at lea&s;t, that beauty was in &s;ome degree dependent upon &s;entiment and manners, that &s;o high a privilege might not be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the unworthy, and that human rea&s;on might no longer &s;uffer the mortification of tho&s;e who are compelled to adore an idol, which differs from a &s;tone or a log only by the &s;kill of the artificer: and if they cannot them&s;elves behold beauty with indifference, they mu&s;t, &s;urely, ap|prove an attempt to &s;hew that it merits their regard.</P>
<P N="4">4. I &s;hall, however, principally con&s;ider that &s;pe|cies of beauty which is expre&s;&s;ed in the countenance; for this alone is peculiar to human beings, and is not le&s;s complicated than their nature. In the counte|nance there are but two requi&s;ites to perfect beauty, which are wholly produced by external cau&s;es, co|lour and proportion: and it will appear, that even in common e&s;timation the&s;e are not the chief; but that though there may be beauty without them, yet there cannot be beauty without &s;omething more.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="99" REF="020531_0104_0FAFE293819FD520">5. The fine&s;t features, ranged in the mo&s;t exact &s;ymmetry, and heightened by the mo&s;t blooming complexion, mu&s;t be animated before they can &s;trike; and when they are animated, will generally excite the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions which they expre&s;s. If they are fixed in the dead calm of in&s;en&s;ibility, they will be examined without emotion; and if they do not ex|pre&s;s kindne&s;s, they will be beheld without love.</P>
<P N="6">6. Looks of contempt, di&s;dain, or malevolence, will be reflected, as from a mirror, by every coun|tenance on which they are turned; and if a wanton a&s;pect excites de&s;ire, it is but like that of a &s;avage for his prey, which cannot be gratified without the de&s;truction of its object.</P>
<P N="7">7. Among particular graces the dimple has always been allowed the pre-eminence, and the rea&s;on is evident; dimples are produced by a &s;mile, and a &s;mile is an expre&s;&s;ion of complacency: &s;o the contrac|tion of the brows into a frown, as it is an indication of a contrary temper, has always been deemed a capital defect.</P>
<P N="8">8. The lover is generally at a lo&s;s to define the beauty, by which his pa&s;&s;ion was &s;uddenly and irre|&s;i&s;tibly determined to a particular object; but this could never happen, if it depended upon any known rule of proportion, upon the &s;hape or di&s;po&s;ition of the features, or the colour of the &s;kin: he tells you that it is &s;omething which he cannot fully expre&s;s, &s;omething not fixed in any part, but di&s;fu&s;ed over the whole; he calls it a &s;weetne&s;s, a &s;oftne&s;s, a pla|cid &s;en&s;ibility, or gives it &s;ome other appeliation which connects beauty with &s;entiment, and expre&s;&s;es a charm which is not peculiar to any &s;et o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> features, but is perhaps po&s;&s;ible to all.</P>
<P N="9">9. This beauty, however, does not always con&s;i&s;t in &s;miles, but varies as expre&s;&s;io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of meekne&s;s and kindne&s;s vary with their objects: it is extremely for|cible in the &s;ilent complaint of patient &s;ufferance, the tender &s;olicitude of friend&s;hip, and the glow of
<PB N="100" REF="020531_0105_0FAFE294400AD958">
filial obedience; and in tears, whether of joy, of pity, or of grief, it is almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P N="10">10. This is the charm which captivates without the aid of nature, and without which her utmo&s;t bounty is ineffectual. But it cannot be a&s;&s;umed as a ma&s;k to conceal in&s;en&s;ibility or malevolence; it mu&s;t be the genuine effect of corre&s;ponding &s;entiments, or it will impre&s;s upon the countenance a new and more di&s;gu&s;ting deformity, affectation: it will produce the grin, the &s;imper, the &s;tare, the langui&s;h, the pout, and innumerable other grimaces, that render folly ridiculous, and change pity to contempt.</P>
<P N="11">11. By &s;ome, indeed, this &s;pecies of hypocri&s;y has been practi&s;ed with &s;uch &s;kill as to deceive &s;uper|ficial ob&s;ervers, though it can deceive even the&s;e but for a moment. Looks which do not corre&s;pond with the heart, cannot be a&s;&s;umed without labour, nor continued without pain; the motive to relinqui&s;h them mu&s;t, therefore, &s;oon preponderate, and the a&s;pect and apparel of the vi&s;it will be laid by toge|ther; the &s;miles and langui&s;hments of art will vani&s;h, and the fiercene&s;s of rage, or the gloom of di&s;content will either ob&s;cure or de&s;troy all the elegance of &s;ym|metry and complexion.</P>
<P N="12">12. The artificial a&s;pect is, indeed, as wretched a &s;ub&s;titute for the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;entiment, as the &s;mear of paint for the blu&s;hes of health: it is not on|ly equally tran&s;ient, and equally liable to detection; but as paint leaves the countenance yet more wither|ed and gha&s;tly, the pa&s;&s;ions bur&s;t out with more vio|lence after re&s;traint, the features become more di&s;|torted, and excite more determined aver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="13">13. Beauty, therefore, depends principally upon the mind, and con&s;equently may be influenced by education. It has been remarked, that the predo|minant pa&s;&s;ion may generally be di&s;covered in the countenance; becau&s;e the mu&s;cles by which it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed, being almo&s;t perpetually contracted, lo&s;e their tone, and never totally relax; &s;o that the ex|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="101" REF="020531_0106_0FAFE294FAB0D760">
remains when the pa&s;&s;ion is &s;u&s;pended: thus an angry, a di&s;dainful, a &s;ubtil, and a &s;u&s;picious temper, is di&s;played in characters that are almo&s;t univer&s;ally under&s;tood.</P>
<P N="14">14. It is equally true of the plea&s;ing and the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, that they leave their &s;ignatures upon the countenance when they cea&s;e to act: the prevalence of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions therefore produces a mechanical ef|fect upon the a&s;pect, and gives a turn and ca&s;t to the features which makes a more favourable and forcible impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of others, than any charm produced by mere external cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="15">15. Neither does the beauty which depends upon temper and &s;entiment, equally endanger the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|or; "It is," to u&s;e an ea&s;tern metaphor,
<Q>like the towers of a city, not only an ornament but a de|fence:</Q>
if it excites de&s;ire, it at once controuls and refines it; it repre&s;&s;es with awe, it &s;oftens with delicacy, and it wins to imitation. The love of rea|&s;on and virtue is mingled with the love of beauty; becau&s;e this beauty is little more than the emanation of intellectual excellence, which is not an object of corporeal appetite.</P>
<P N="16">16. As it excites a purer pa&s;&s;ion, it al&s;o more &s;or|cibly engages to fidelity: every man finds him&s;elf more powerfully re&s;trained from giving pain to good|ne&s;s than to bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty; and every look of a countenance in which they are blended&punc; in which beauty is the expre&s;&s;ion of goodne&s;s, is a &s;ilent reproach of the fir&s;t irregular wi&s;h: and the purpo&s;e immediately appears to be di&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous and cruel, by which the tender hope of ineffable affection would be di&s;appointed, the placid confidence of un&s;u&s;pected &s;implicity abu&s;|ed, and the peace even of virtue endangered by the mo&s;t &s;ordid infidelity, and the breach of the &s;trong|e&s;t obligations.</P>
<P N="17">17. But the hope of the hypocrite mu&s;t peri&s;h. When the fictitious beauty has laid by her &s;miles, when the lu&s;tre of her eyes and the bloom of her cheeks have
<PB N="102" REF="020531_0107_0FAFE295C0213400">
lo&s;t their influence with their novelty; what remains but a tyrant dive&s;ted of power, who will never be &s;een without a mixture of indignation and di&s;dain? The only de&s;ire which this object could gratify, will be transferred to another, not only without reluctance, but with triumph.</P>
<P N="18">18. As re&s;entment will &s;ucceed to di&s;appointment, a de&s;ire to mortify will &s;ucceed to a de&s;ire to plea&s;e: and the hu&s;band may be urged to &s;olicit a mi&s;tre&s;s, merely by a remembrance of the beauty of his wife, which la&s;ted only till &s;he was known.</P>
<P>Let it, therefore, be remembred, that none can be di&s;ciples of the Graces, but in the &s;chool of Virtue; and that tho&s;e who wi&s;h to be lovely mu&s;t learn early to be good.</P>
<P N="19">19. A Friend of mine has two daughters, whom I will call <HI>Laetitia</HI> and <HI>Daphn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> The former is one of the greate&s;t beauties of the age in which &s;he lives, the latter no way remarkable for any charms in her per&s;on.

<P N="20">20. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her charms has rendered her in&s;upportably vain and in&s;olent, towards all who have to do with her. <HI>Daphne,</HI> who was almo&s;t twen|ty before one civil thing had ever been &s;aid to her, found her&s;elf obliged to acquire &s;ome accompli&s;h|ments to make up for the want of tho&s;e attractions which &s;he &s;aw in her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P N="21">21. Poor <HI>Daphne</HI> was &s;eldom &s;ubmitted to in a debate wherein &s;he was concerned; her di&s;cour&s;e had nothing to recommend it but the good &s;en&s;e of it, and &s;he was always under a nece&s;&s;ity to have very well con&s;idered what &s;he was to &s;ay before &s;he uttered it;

<P N="22">22. The&s;e cau&s;es have produced &s;uitable effects, and <HI>Laetitia</HI> is as in&s;ipid a companion, as <HI>Daphne</HI> is an agreeable one. <HI>Laetitia,</HI> confident of favour, has &s;tudied no arts to plea&s;e; <HI>Daphne,</HI> de&s;pairing of any inclination towards her per&s;on, has depended only on her merit. <HI>Laetitia</HI> has always &s;omething in her air that is &s;ullen, grave, and di&s;con&s;olate.</P>

As it is an argument of a light mind, to think the wor&s;e of our&s;elves for the imperfections of our per&s;ons, it is equally below us to value our&s;elves upon the advantages of them.</P>
<P N="27">27. The female world &s;eem to be almo&s;t incorrigi|bly gone a&s;tray in this particular; for which rea&s;on, I &s;hall recommend the following extract out of a friend's letter to the profe&s;s'd beauties, who are a people almo&s;t as in&s;ufferable as the profe&s;s'd wits.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Mon&s;ieur St. <HI>Evremont</HI> has concluded one of his e&s;&s;ays with affirming, that the la&s;t &s;ighs of a hand|&s;ome woman are not &s;o much for the lo&s;s of her life, as her beauty.</P>
<P N="28">28.
Perhaps this raillery is pur&s;ued too far, yet it is turned upon a very obvious remark, that wo|man's &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion is for her own beauty, and that &s;he values it as her favourite di&s;tinction. From hence it is that all hearts, which pretend to im|prove or pre&s;erve it, meet with &s;o general a recep|tion among the &s;ex.</P>
<P N="29">29.
To &s;ay nothing of many fal&s;e helps, and contraband wares of beauty, which are daily ven|ded in this great mart, there is not a maiden gen|tlewoman, of a good family in any county of <HI>South Britain,</HI> who has not heard of the virtues of May|dew, or is unfurni&s;hed with &s;ome receipt or other in favour of her complexion; and I have known a phy&s;ician of learning and &s;en&s;e, after eight years &s;tudy in the univer&s;ity, and a cour&s;e of travels into mo&s;t countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> owe the fir&s;t rai&s;ing of his fortune to a co&s;metic wa&s;h.</P>
<P N="30"><PB N="105" REF="020531_0110_0FAFE29800263540">30.
This has given me occa&s;ion to con&s;ider how &s;o univer&s;al a di&s;po&s;ition in womankind, which &s;prings from a laudable motive, the de&s;ire of plea|&s;ing, and proceeds upon an opinion, not altoge|ther groundle&s;s, that nature may be helped by art, may be turned to their advantage. And, me|thinks, it would be an acceptable &s;ervice to take them out of the hands of quacks and pretenders, and to prevent their impo&s;ing upon them&s;elves, by di&s;covering to them the true &s;ecret and art of im|proving beauty.</P>
<P N="31">31.
In order to this, before I touch upon it di|rectly, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to lay down a few pre|liminary maxims, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That no woman can be hand&s;ome by the force of features alone, any more than &s;he can be witty only by the help of &s;peech.</P>
<P>That pride de&s;troys all &s;ymmetry and grace, and affectation is a more terrible enemy to fine faces than the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>That no woman is capable of being beautiful, who is not incapable of being fal&s;e.</P>
<P>And, That what would be odious in a friend, is deformity in a mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P N="32">32.
From the&s;e few principles thus laid down, it will be ea&s;y to prove, that the true art of a&s;&s;i&s;ting beauty con&s;i&s;ts in embelli&s;hing the whole per&s;on by the proper ornaments of virtuous and commenda|ble qualities. By this help alone it is, that tho&s;e who are the favourite work of nature, or, as Mr. <HI>Drydea</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, the porcelain clay of human kind, become animated, and are in a capacity of exerting their charms: and tho&s;e who &s;eem to have been neglected by her, like models wrought in ha&s;te, are capable, in a great mea&s;ure, of fini&s;hing what &s;he has left imperfect.</P>
<P N="33">33.
It is, methinks, a low and degrading idea of that &s;ex, which was created to refine the joys, and &s;often the cares of humanity, by the mo&s;t a|greeable
<PB N="106" REF="020531_0111_0FAFE298B971FE60">
participation, to con&s;ider them merely as objects of &s;ight.&mdash;This is abridging them of their natural extent of power, to put them upon a level with their pictures at the pantheon. How much nobler is the contemplation of beauty heightened by virtue, and commanding our e&s;teem and love, while it draws our ob&s;ervation?</P>
<P N="34">34.
How faint and &s;piritle&s;s are the charms of a coquette; when compared with the real loveline&s;s of <HI>Sophronia</HI>'s innocence, piety, good humour, and truth; virtues which add a new &s;oftne&s;s to her &s;ex, and even beautify her beauty! That agreea|blene&s;s, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have appeared no longer in the mode&s;t virgin, is now pre&s;erved in the tender mother, the prudent friend, and faith|ful wife.</P>
<P N="35">35.
Colours artfully &s;pread upon canvas may en|tertain the eye, but not affect the heart; and &s;he, who takes no care to add to the natural graces of her per&s;on, any excelling qualities, may be allow|ed &s;till to amu&s;e as a picture, but not to triumph as a beauty.</P>
<P>When <HI>Adam</HI> is introduced by <HI>Milton</HI> de&s;cribing <HI>Eve</HI> in paradi&s;e, and relating to the angel the im|pre&s;&s;ions he felt upon &s;eeing her at her fir&s;t creation he does not repre&s;ent her like a <HI>Grecian Venus,</HI> by her &s;hape or features, but by the lu&s;tre of her mind which &s;hone in them, and gave them their power of charming.</P>
<P N="36">36.
<Q><L>Grace was in all her &s;teps, Heav'n in her eye,</L>
<L>In all her ge&s;tures dignity and love:</L></Q></P>
<P>Without this irradiating power, the proude&s;t fair one ought to know, whatever her gla&s;s may tell her to the contrary, that her mo&s;t perfect fea|tures are uninformed and dead.</P>
<P>I cannot better clo&s;e this moral, than by a &s;hort epitaph, written by <HI>Ben John&s;on,</HI> with a &s;pirit which nothing could in&s;pire, but &s;uch an object as I have been de&s;cribing.</P>

<HEAD>Honour.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. EVERY principle that is a motive to good acti|ons, ought to be encouraged, &s;ince men are of &s;o different a make, that the &s;ame principle does not work equally upon all minds. What &s;ome men are prompted to by con&s;cience, duty, or religion, which are only different names for the &s;ame thing, others are prompted to by Honour.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;en&s;e of honour is of &s;o fine and delicate a nature, that it is only to be met with in minds which are naturally noble, or in &s;uch as have been cultiva|ted by great examples, or a refined education. This paper therefore is chiefly de&s;igned for tho&s;e who, by means of any of the&s;e advantages, are, or ought to be, actuated by this glorious principle.</P>
<P N="3">3. But as nothing is more pernicious than a prin|ciple of action, when it is mi&s;under&s;tood, I &s;hall con|&s;ider honour with re&s;pect to three &s;orts of men. Fir&s;t of all, with regard to tho&s;e who have a right notion of it. Secondly, with regard to tho&s;e who have a mi&s;taken notion of it. And thirdly, with regard to tho&s;e who treat it as chimerical, and turn it into ridi|cule.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the fir&s;t place, true honour, though it be a different principle from religion, is that which pro|duces the &s;ame effects. The lines of action, though
<PB N="108" REF="020531_0113_0FAFE29A410F1A58">
drawn from different parts, terminate in the &s;ame point. Religion embraces virtue, as it is enjoined by the laws of God; Honour, as it is graceful and or|namental to human nature.</P>
<P N="5">5. The religious man a <HI>fears,</HI> the man of honour <HI>&s;corns</HI> to do an ill action. The former con&s;iders vice as &s;omething that is beneath him, the other as &s;omething that is offen&s;ive to the Divine Being. The one as what is <HI>unbecoming,</HI> the other as what is <HI>forbidden.</HI> Thus <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;peaks in the natural and genuine language of a man of honour, when he declares that were there no God to &s;ee or puni&s;h vice, he would not commit it, be|cau&s;e it is of &s;o mean, &s;o ba&s;e, and &s;o vile a nature.</P>
<P N="6">6. I &s;hall conclude this head with the de&s;cription of honour in the part of young <HI>Juba.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Honour's a &s;acred tye, the law of kings,</L>
<L>The noble mind's di&s;tingui&s;hing perfection,</L>
<L>That aids and &s;trengthens virtue where it meets her,</L>
<L>And imitates her actions where &s;he is not.</L>
<L>It ought not to be &s;ported with.&mdash;
<BIBL><HI>CATO.</HI></BIBL></L></Q>
<P N="7">7. In the &s;econd place we are to con&s;ider tho&s;e who have mi&s;taken notions of honour, and the&s;e are &s;uch as e&s;tabli&s;h any thing to them&s;elves for a point of ho|nour which is contrary either to the laws of God, or of their country; who think it more honourable to revenge than to forgive an injury; who make no &s;cruple of telling a lie, but would put any man to death who ac|cu&s;es them of it; who are more careful to guard their reputation by their courage than by their virtue.</P>
<P N="8">8. True fortitude is indeed &s;o becoming in human nature, That he who wants it &s;carce de&s;erves the name of a man; but we find &s;everal who &s;o much a|bu&s;e this notion, that they place the whole idea of honour in a kind of brutal courage; by which means we have had many among us who have called them|&s;elves men of honour, that would have been a di&s;grace to a gibbet.</P>
<P N="9">9. In a word, the man who &s;acrifices any duty of a rea&s;onable creature to a prevailing mode of fa&s;hion,
<PB N="109" REF="020531_0114_0FAFE29AFB66F478">
who looks upon any thing as honourable that is di&s;|plea&s;ing to his Maker, or di&s;tructive to &s;ociety, who thinks him&s;elf obliged by this principle to the prac|tice of &s;ome virtues and not of others, is by no means to be reckoned among true men of honour.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Timogenes</HI> was a lively in&s;tance of one actuated by fal&s;e honour. <HI>Timogenes</HI> would &s;mile at a man's je&s;t who ridiculed his Maker, and at the &s;ame time run a man through the body that &s;poke ill of his friend. <HI>Timogenes</HI> would have &s;corned to have be|trayed a &s;ecret, that was intru&s;ted with him, though the fate of his country depended upon the di&s;covery of it.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Timogenes</HI> took away the life of a young fel|low in a duel, for having &s;poken ill of <HI>Belinda,</HI> a la|dy whom he him&s;elf had &s;educed in her youth, and betrayed into want and ignominy. To clo&s;e his cha|racter, <HI>Timogenes,</HI> after having ruined &s;everal poor trade&s;men's families, who had tru&s;ted him, &s;old his e&s;tate to &s;atisfy his creditors; but like a man of ho|nour di&s;po&s;ed of all the money he could make of it, in paying off his play-debts, or to &s;peak in his own language, his debts of honour.</P>
<P N="12">12. In the third place, we are to con&s;ider tho&s;e per&s;ons, who treat this principle as chimerical, and turn it into ridicule. Men who are profe&s;&s;edly of no honour, are of a more profligate and abandoned na|ture, than even tho&s;e who are actuated by fal&s;e no|tions of it, as there is more hope of a heretic than of an athei&s;t, The&s;e &s;ons of infamy con&s;ider honour with old <HI>Syphax,</HI> in the play before mentioned, as a fine imaginary notion, that leads a&s;tray young unex|perienced men, and draws them into real mi&s;chiefs, while they are engaged in the pur&s;uits of a &s;hadow&punc;</P>
<P N="13">13. The&s;e are generally per&s;ons, who, in <HI>Shake&s;|pear</HI>'s phra&s;e, are <HI>worn and huckney'd in the ways of men:</HI> who&s;e imaginations are grown callous, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d have lo&s;t all tho&s;e delicate &s;entiments which are na|tural to minds that are innocent and undepraved.
<PB N="110" REF="020531_0115_0FAFE29BB9EA5310">
Such old battered mi&s;creants ridicule every thing as romantic, that comes in competition with their pre|&s;ent intere&s;t, and treat tho&s;e per&s;ons as vi&s;ionaries who dare &s;tand up in a corrupt age, for what has not its immediate reward joined to it.</P>
<P N="14">14. The talents, intere&s;t, or experience of &s;uch men, make them very often u&s;eful in all parties, and at all times. But whatever wealth and dignities they may arrive at, they ought to con&s;ider, that e|very one &s;tands as a blot in the annals of his country, who arrives at the temple of <HI>honour</HI> by any other way than through that of <HI>virtue.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Human Nature.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. SPECTATOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1
I HAVE always been a very great lover of your &s;peculations, as well in regard to the &s;ubject, as to your manner of treating it. Human nature I always thought the mo&s;t u&s;eful object of human rea&s;on, and to make the con&s;ideration of it plea&s;ant and entertaining, I always thought the be&s;t employment of human wit: other parts of phi|lo&s;ophy may perhaps make us wi&s;er, but this not only an&s;wers that end, but makes us better too.</P>
<P N="2">2.
Hence it was that the oracle pronounced <HI>So|crates</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t of all men living, becau&s;e he ju|diciou&s;ly made choice of human nature for the ob|ject of his thoughts; an enquiry into which as much exceeds all other learning, as it is of more con&s;e|quence to adju&s;t the true nature and mea&s;ures of right and wrong, than to &s;ettle the di&s;tance of the planets, and compute the times of their circumvo|lutions.</P>
<P N="3">3.
One good effect that will immediately ari&s;e from a near ob&s;ervation of human nature, is, that
<PB N="111" REF="020531_0116_0FAFE29C7B7E7FD0">
we &s;hall cea&s;e to wonder at tho&s;e actions which men are u&s;ed to reckon wholly unaccountable; for as nothing is produced without a cau&s;e, &s;o by ob&s;erv|ing the nature and cour&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ions, we &s;hall be able to trace every action from its fir&s;t concep|tion to its death.</P>
<P N="4">4.
We &s;hall no more admire at the proceedings of <HI>Catiline</HI> and <HI>Tiberius,</HI> when we know the one was actuated by a cruel jealou&s;y, the other by a fu|rious ambition; for the actions of men follow their pa&s;&s;ions as naturally as light does heat, or as any other effect flows from its cau&s;e; rea&s;on mu&s;t be employed in adju&s;ting the pa&s;&s;ions, but they mu&s;t ever remain the principles of action.</P>
<P N="5">5.
The &s;trange and ab&s;urd variety that is &s;o ap|parent in men's actions, &s;hows plainly they can ne|ver proceed immediately from rea&s;on; &s;o pure a fountain emits no &s;uch troubled waters: they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e from the pa&s;&s;ions, which are to the mind as the winds to a &s;hip; they only can move it, and they too often de&s;troy it; if fair and gentle, they guide it into the harbour; if contrary and fu|rious, they over&s;et it in the waves.</P>
<P N="6">6.
In the &s;ame manner is the mind a&s;&s;i&s;ted or endangered by the pa&s;&s;ions; rea&s;on mu&s;t then take the place of pilot, and can never fail of &s;ecuring her charge if &s;he be not wanting to her&s;elf; the &s;trength of the pa&s;&s;ions will never be accepted as an excu&s;e for complying with them: they were de|&s;igned for &s;ubjection; and if a man &s;uffers them to get the upper hand, he then betrays the liberty of his own &s;oul.</P>
<P N="7">7.
As nature has framed the &s;everal &s;pecies of beings as it were in a chain, &s;o man &s;eems to be placed as the middle link between angels and brutes: hence he participates both of fle&s;h and &s;pirit by an admirable tye, which in him occa&s;ions perpetual war of pa&s;&s;ions; and as a man inclines to the angelic or brute part of his con&s;titution, he
<PB N="112" REF="020531_0117_0FAFE29D3B6C3438">
is then denominated good or bad, virtuous or wick|ed: if love, mercy, and good-nature prevail, they &s;peak him of the angel; if hatred, cruelty, and envy predominate, they declare his kindred to the brute.</P>
<P N="8">8.
Hence it was that &s;ome ancients imagined, that as men in this life inclined more to the angel or the brute, &s;o after their death they &s;hould tran&s;|migrate into the one or the other: and it would be no unplea&s;ant notion to con&s;ider the &s;everal &s;pecies of brutes, into which we may imagine that tyrants, mi&s;ers, the proud, malicious, and ill-natured, might be changed.</P>
<P N="9">9.
As a con&s;equence of this original, all pa&s;&s;ions are in all men, but appear not in all: con&s;titution, education, cu&s;tom of the country, rea&s;on, and the like cau&s;es may improve or abate the &s;trength of them, but &s;till the &s;eeds remain, which are ever ready to &s;prout forth upon the lea&s;t encouragement.</P>
<P N="10">10.
I have heard a &s;tory of a good religious man, who having been bred with the milk of a goat, was very mode&s;t in public, by a careful reflection he made on his actions, but he frequently had an hour in &s;ecret, wherein he had his fri&s;ks and capers: and if we had an opportunity of examining the re|tirement of the &s;tricte&s;t philo&s;ophers, no doubt but we &s;hould find perpetual returns of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions they &s;o artfully conceal from the public.</P>
<P N="11">11.
I remember <HI>Machiavel</HI> ob&s;erves, that every &s;tate &s;hould entertain a perpetual jealou&s;y of its neighbours, that &s;o it &s;hould never be unprovided when an emergency happens; in like manner &s;hould rea&s;on be perpetually on its guard again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions, and never &s;uffer them to carry on any de&s;ign that may be de&s;tructive of its &s;ecurity; yet at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be careful, that it don't &s;o far break their &s;trength as to render them con|temptible, and con&s;equently it&s;elf unguarded.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="113" REF="020531_0118_0FAFE29DFA8CFF98">12.
The under&s;tanding being of it&s;elf too &s;low and lazy to exert it&s;elf into action, it is nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be put in motion by the gentle gales of pa&s;&s;ions, which may pre&s;erve it from &s;tagnating and corruption; for they are nece&s;&s;ary to the health of the mind, as the circulation of the animal &s;pirits is to the health of the body; they keep it in life, and &s;trength, and vigour; nor is it po&s;&s;ible for the mind to perform its offices without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the&s;e motions are given us with our being; they are little &s;pirits, that are born and die with us; to &s;ome they are mild, ea&s;y and gentle; to others way|ward and unruly; yet never too &s;trong for the reins of rea&s;on, and the guidance of judgment.</P>
<P N="13">13.
We may generally ob&s;erve a pretty nice pro|portion between the &s;trength of rea&s;on and pa&s;&s;ion; the greate&s;t geniu&s;es have commonly the &s;tronge&s;t affections, as, on the other hand, the weaker un|der&s;tandings have generally the weaker pa&s;&s;ions: and 'tis fit the fury of the cour&s;ers &s;hould not be too great for the &s;trength of the charioteer.</P>
<P N="14">14.
Young men, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are not a little unruly, give &s;mall hopes of their ever being con|&s;iderable; the fire of youth will of cour&s;e abate, and is a fault, if it be a fault, that mends every day; but &s;urely, unle&s;s a man has fire in youth, he can hardly have warmth in old age.</P>
<P N="15">15.
We mu&s;t therefore be very cautious, le&s;t while we think to regulate the pa&s;&s;ions, we &s;hould quite extingui&s;h them; which is putting out the light of the &s;oul; for to be without pa&s;&s;ion, or to be hurried away with it, makes a man equally blind. The extraordinary &s;everity u&s;ed in mo&s;t of our &s;chools has this fatal effect; it breaks the &s;pring of the mind, and mo&s;t certainly de&s;troys more good geniu&s;es than it can po&s;&s;ibly improve.</P>
<P N="16">16.
And &s;urely 'tis a mighty mi&s;take that the pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould be &s;o entirely &s;ubdued; for little ir|regularities are &s;ometimes not only to be bore with,
<PB N="114" REF="020531_0119_0FAFE29EBB690F88">
but to be cultivated too, &s;ince they are frequently attended with the greate&s;t perfections. All great geniu&s;es have faults mixed with their virtues, and re&s;emble the flaming bu&s;h which has thorns a|mong&s;t lights.</P>
<P N="17">17.
Since therefore the pa&s;&s;ions are the princi|ples of human actions, we mu&s;t endeavour to ma|nage them &s;o as to retain their vigour, yet keep them under &s;trict command; we mu&s;t govern them rather like free &s;ubjects than &s;laves, left, while we intend to make them obedient, they become abject, and unfit for tho&s;e great purpo&s;es to which they were de&s;igned.</P>
<P N="18">18.
For my part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I could never have any regard to that &s;ect of philo&s;ophers, who &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted upon an ab&s;olute indifference and vacancy from all pa&s;&s;ion; for it &s;eems to me a thing very incon&s;i&s;tent for a man to dive&s;t him&s;elf of hu|manity, in order to acquire tranquillity of mind, and to eradicate the very principles of action, be|cau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible they may produce ill effects.</P>

<HEAD>The Advantages of repre&s;enting <HI>HUMAN NATURE</HI> in its proper Dignity.</HEAD>
<BIBL>TATLER, No. 108.</BIBL>
<P>IT is not to be imagined, how great an effect well-di&s;po&s;ed lights, with proper forms and orders in a&s;&s;emblies, have upon &s;ome tempers. I am &s;ure I feel it in &s;o extraordinary a manner, that I cannot in a day or two get out of my imagination any very beautiful or di&s;agreeable impre&s;&s;ion which I receive
<PB N="115" REF="020531_0120_0FAFE29F7A86A698">
on &s;uch occa&s;ions. For this rea&s;on I frequently look in at the play-hou&s;e, in order to enlarge my thoughts, and warm my mind with &s;ome new ideas, that may be &s;erviceable to me in my lucubrations.</P>
<P N="1">1. In this di&s;po&s;ition I entered the theatre the other day, and placed my&s;elf in a corner of it, very convenient for &s;eeing, without being my&s;elf ob&s;erved. I found the audience hu&s;hed in a very deep attention, and did not que&s;tion but &s;ome noble tragedy was ju&s;t then in its cri&s;is, or that an incident was to be unra|velled which would determine the fate of an hero. While I was in this &s;u&s;pen&s;e, expecting every mo|ment to &s;ee my old friend Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI> appear in all the maje&s;ty of di&s;tre&s;s, to my un&s;peakable amaze|ment, there came up a mon&s;ter with a face between his feet; and as I was looking on, he rai&s;ed him&s;elf on one leg in &s;uch a perpendicular po&s;ture, that the other grew in a direct line above his head.</P>
<P N="2">2. It afterwards twi&s;ted it&s;elf into the motions and wreathings of &s;everal different animals, and after great variety of &s;hapes and transformations went off the &s;tage in the figure of an human creature. The admiration, the applau&s;e, the &s;atisfaction of the au|dience, during this &s;trange entertainment, is not to be expre&s;&s;ed. I was very much out of countenance for my dear countrymen, and looked about with &s;ome apprehen&s;ion, for fear any foreigner &s;hould be pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it po&s;&s;ible (thought I) that human nature can rejoice in its di&s;grace, and take plea&s;ure in &s;eeing its own figure turned to ridicule, and di&s;torted into forms that rai&s;e horror and aver&s;ion? There is &s;ome|thing di&s;ingenuous and immoral in the being able to bear &s;uch a &s;ight. Men of elegant and noble minds are &s;hocked at the &s;eeing characters of per&s;ons who de|&s;erve e&s;teem for their virtue, knowledge, or &s;ervices to their country, placed in wrong lights, and by mi&s;repre&s;entation made the &s;ubject of buffoonery.</P>
<P N="4">4. Such a nice abhorrence is not indeed to be found among the vulgar; but methinks it is wonderful,
<PB N="116" REF="020531_0121_0FAFE2A04062EC38">
that tho&s;e, who have nothing but the outward figure to di&s;tingui&s;h them as men, &s;hould delight in &s;eeing it abu&s;ed, vilified and di&s;graced.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, there is nothing that more plea&s;es me, in all that I read in books, or &s;ee among man|kind, than &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as repre&s;ent human nature in its proper dignity.</P>
<P N="5">5. As man is a creature made up of different ex|tremes, he has &s;omething in him very great and ve|ry mean: a &s;kilful arti&s;t may draw an excellent pic|ture of him in either of the&s;e views. The fine&s;t authors of antiquity have taken him on the more ad|vantageous &s;ide. They cultivate the natural gran|deur of the &s;oul, rai&s;e in her a generous ambition, feed her with hopes of immortality and perfection, and do all they can to widen the partition between the virtuous and the vicious, by making the diffe|rence betwixt them as great as between gods and brutes.</P>
<P N="6">6. In &s;hort, it is impo&s;&s;ible to read a page in <HI>Plato, Tully,</HI> and a thou&s;and other antient morali&s;ts, with|out being a greater and a better man for it. On the contrary, I could never read any of our modi&s;h <HI>French</HI> authors, or tho&s;e of our own country, who are the imitators and admirers of that trifling nation, with|out being for &s;ome time out of humour with my&s;elf, and at every thing about me.</P>
<P N="7">7. Their bu&s;ine&s;s is, to depreciate human nature, and con&s;ider it under its wor&s;t appearances. They give mean interpretations and ba&s;e motives to the worthie&s;t actions: they re&s;olve virtue and vice into con&s;titution. In &s;hort, they endeavour to make no di&s;tinction between man and man, or between the &s;pecies of men and that of brutes. As an in&s;tance of this kind of authors, among many others; let a|ny one examine the celebrated <HI>Rochefoucault,</HI> who is the great philo&s;opher for admini&s;tering of con&s;ola|tion to the idle, the envious, and worthle&s;s part of mankind.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="117" REF="020531_0122_0FAFE2A0FA338170">8. I remember a young gentleman of moderate under&s;tanding, but great vivacity, who, by dipping into many authors of this nature, had got a little &s;mattering of knowledge, ju&s;t enough to make an athei&s;t or a free-thinker, but not a philo&s;opher or a man of &s;en&s;e. With the&s;e accompli&s;hments, he went to vi&s;it his father in the country, who was a plain, rough, hone&s;t man, and wi&s;e though not learned. The &s;on, who took all opportunities to &s;hew his learn|ing, began to e&s;tabli&s;h a new religion in the family, and to enlarge the narrowne&s;s of their country no|tions; in which he &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that he had &s;educed the butler by his table-talk, and &s;taggered his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P N="9">9. The old gentleman began to be alarmed at the &s;chi&s;ms that aro&s;e among his children, but did not yet believe his &s;on's doctrine to be &s;o pernicious as it real<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y was, till one day talking of his &s;etting-dog, the &s;on &s;aid, he did not que&s;tion but <HI>Trey</HI> was as im|mortal as any one of the family; and in the heat of the argument told his father, that for his own part he expected to die like a dog. Upon which, the old man &s;tarting up in a very great pa&s;&s;ion, cried out, Then, &s;irrah, you &s;hall live like one; and taking his cane in his hand, cudgelled him out of his &s;y&s;|tem. This had &s;o good an effect upon him, that he took up from that day, fell to reading good books, and is now a bencher in the <HI>Middle Temple.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. I do not mention this cudgelling part of the &s;tory with a de&s;ign to engage the &s;ecular arm in mat|ters of this nature; but certainly, if it ever exerts it&s;elf in affairs of opinion and &s;peculation, it ought to do it on &s;uch &s;hallow and de&s;picable pretenders to knowledge, who endeavour to give man dark and un|comfortable pro&s;pects of his being, and de&s;troy tho&s;e principles which are the &s;upport, happine&s;s and glory of all public &s;ocieties, as well as private per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="11">11. I think it is one of <HI>Pythagoras</HI>'s golden &s;ay|ings, <HI>that a man &s;hould take care above all things to
<PB N="118" REF="020531_0123_0FAFE2A1C0004650">
have a due re&s;pect for him&s;elf:</HI> and it is certain, that this licentious &s;ort of authors, who are for deprecia|ting mankind, endeavour to di&s;appoint and undo what the mo&s;t refined &s;pirits have been labouring to advance &s;ince the beginning of the world. The ve|ry de&s;ign of dre&s;s, good breeding, outward orna|ments and ceremony, were to lift up human nature, and &s;et it off to advantage. Architecture, painting and &s;tatuary, were invented with the &s;ame de&s;ign; as indeed every art and &s;cience that contributes to the embelli&s;hment of life, and to the wearing off and throwing into &s;hades the mean and low parts of our nature.</P>
<P N="12">12. Poetry carries on this great end more than all the re&s;t, as may be &s;een in the following pa&s;&s;ages ta|ken out of Sir <HI>Francis Bacon's advancement of learning,</HI> which gives a true and better account of this art than all the volumes that were ever written upon it.</P>
<P><Q>Poetry, e&s;pecially heroical, &s;eems to be rai&s;ed altogether from a noble foundation, which makes much for the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nity of man's nature. For &s;eeing this &s;en&s;ible world is in dignity inferior to the &s;oul of man, poe&s;y &s;eems to endow human nature with that which hi&s;tory denies; and to give &s;atisfaction to the mind, with at lea&s;t the &s;hadow of things, where the &s;ub&s;tance cannot be had.</Q></P>
<P N="13">13.
<Q>For if the matter be thoroughly con&s;idered, a &s;trong argument may be drawn from poe&s;y, that a more &s;tately greatne&s;s of things, a more perfect or|der and a more beautiful variety, delights the &s;oul of man than any way can be found in nature &s;ince the fall. Wherefore &s;eeing the acts and events, which are the &s;ubjects of true hi&s;tory, are not of that amplitude as to content the mind of man, poe|&s;y is ready at hand to feign acts more heroical.</Q></P>
<P N="14">14.
<Q>Becau&s;e true hi&s;tory reports the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of bu&s;ine&s;s not proportionable to the merit of virtues and vices, poe&s;y corrects it, and pre&s;ents events and fortunes according to de&s;ert, and according
<PB N="119" REF="020531_0124_0FAFE2A2BB4A7F50">
to the law of Providence: becau&s;e true hi&s;tory, through the frequent &s;atiety and &s;imilitude of things, works a di&s;ta&s;te and mi&s;pri&s;on in the mind of man; poe&s;y cheareth and refre&s;heth the &s;oul, chanting things rare and various, and full of vici&s;&s;itudes.</Q></P>
<P N="15">15.
<Q>So as poe&s;y &s;erveth and conferreth to delect|ation, magnanimity and morality; and therefore it may &s;eem de&s;ervedly to have &s;ome participation of divinene&s;s, becau&s;e it doth rai&s;e the mind, and exalt the &s;pirit with high raptures, proportioning the &s;hews of things to the de&s;ires of the mind, and not &s;ubmitting the mind to things as rea&s;on and hi&s;tory do. And by the&s;e allurements and congru|ities, whereby it cheri&s;heth the &s;oul of man, joined al&s;o with con&s;ort of mu&s;ic, whereby it may more &s;weetly in&s;inuate it&s;elf; it hath won &s;uch acce&s;s, that it hath been in e&s;timation even in rude times, and barbarous nations, when our learning &s;tood excluded</Q></P>
<P N="16">16. But there is nothing which favours and falls in with this natural greatne&s;s and dignity of human nature &s;o much as religion, which does not only pro|mi&s;e the entire refinement of the mind, but the glo|rifying of the body, and the immortality of both.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>Cu&s;tom a &s;econd Nature.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THERE is not a common &s;aying which has a better turn of &s;en&s;e in it than what we of|ten hear in the mouths of the vulgar, that Cu&s;tom is a &s;econd Nature. It is indeed able to form the man anew, and give him inclinations and capacities alto|gether different from tho&s;e he was born with.</P>
<P N="2">2. Dr. Plot, in his hi&s;tory of Stafford&s;hire, tells of an idiot, that chancing to live within the &s;ound of a clock, and always amu&s;ing him&s;elf with count|ing the hour of the day whenever the clock &s;truck;
<PB N="120" REF="020531_0125_0FAFE2A4290A5130">
the clock being &s;poiled by &s;ome accident, the idiot continued to &s;trike and count the hour without the help of it, in the &s;ame manner as he had done when it was entire.</P>
<P N="3">3. Though I dare not vouch for the truth of this &s;tory, it is very certain that cu&s;tom has a mechanical effect upon the body, at the &s;ame time that it has a very extraordinary influence upon the mind.</P>
<P N="4">4. I &s;hall in this paper con&s;ider one very remark|able effect which cu&s;tom has upon human nature; and which, if rightly ob&s;erved, may lead us into very u&s;eful rules of life. What I &s;hall here take no|tice of in cu&s;tom, is its wonderful efficacy in making every thing plea&s;ant to us.</P>
<P N="5">5. A per&s;on who is addicted to play or gaming, though he took but little delight in it at fir&s;t, by de|grees contracts &s;o &s;trong an inclination towards it, and gives him&s;elf up &s;o entirely to it, that it &s;eems the only end of his being. The love of a retired or bu&s;y life will grow upon a man in&s;en&s;ibly, as he is conver&s;ant in the one or the other, till he is utterly unqualified for reli&s;hing that to which he has been for &s;ome time di&s;u&s;ed.</P>
<P N="6">6. Nay, a man may &s;moke or drink, or take &s;nuff, till he is unable to pa&s;s away his time without it; not to mention how our delight in any particular &s;tudy, art, or &s;cience, ri&s;es and improves in proportion to the application which we be&s;tow upon it. Thus what was at fir&s;t an exerci&s;e, becomes at length an enter|tainment. Our employments are changed into di|ver&s;ions. The mind grows fond of tho&s;e actions it is accu&s;tomed to, and is drawn with reluctancy from tho&s;e paths in which it has been u&s;ed to walk.</P>
<P N="7">7. Not only &s;uch actions as were at fir&s;t indifferent to us, but even &s;uch as were painful, will by cu&s;tom and practice become plea&s;ant.</P>
<P N="8">8. Sir Francis Bacon ob&s;erves in his natural philo|&s;ophy, that our ta&s;te is never better plea&s;ed than with tho&s;e things which at fir&s;t created a di&s;gu&s;t in it. He
<PB N="121" REF="020531_0126_0FAFE2A4BA09B250">
gives particular in&s;tances of claret, coffee, and other liquors, which the palate &s;eldom approves upon the fir&s;t ta&s;te; but when it has once got a reli&s;h of them, generally retains it for life. The mind is con&s;tituted after the &s;ame manner, and after having habituated it&s;elf to any particular exerci&s;e or employment, not only lo&s;es its fir&s;t aver&s;ion towards it, but conceives a certain fondne&s;s and affection for it.</P>
<P N="9">9. I have heard one of the greate&s;t geniu&s;es this age has produced, who had been trained up in all the polite &s;tudies of antiquity, a&s;&s;ure me, upon his being obliged to &s;earch into &s;everal rolls and records, that notwith&s;tanding &s;uch an employment was at fir&s;t very dry and irk&s;ome to him, he at la&s;t took an incredible plea&s;ure in it, and preferred it even to the reading of Virgil or Cicero.</P>
<P N="10">10. The reader will ob&s;erve, that I have not here con&s;idered cu&s;tom as it makes things ea&s;y, but as it renders them delightful; and though others have of|ten made the &s;ame reflection, it is po&s;&s;ible they may not have drawn tho&s;e u&s;es from it, with which I in|tend to fill the remaining part of this paper.</P>
<P N="11">11. If we con&s;ider attentively this property of hu|man nature, it may in&s;truct us in very fine moralities. In the fir&s;t place, I would have no man di&s;couraged with that kind of life or &s;eries of actions, in which the choice of others, or his own nece&s;&s;ities may have engaged him. It may perhaps be very di&s;agreeable to him at fir&s;t; but u&s;e and application will certain|ly render it not only le&s;s painful, but plea&s;ing and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P N="12">12. In the &s;econd place, I would recommend to every one the admirable precept which Pythagoras is &s;aid to have given to his di&s;ciples, and which that philo&s;opher mu&s;t have drawn from the ob&s;ervation I have enlarged upon: <HI>Optimum vitae genus eligito, nam con&s;uetudo faciet jucundi&s;&s;imum,</HI> pitch upon that cour&s;e of life which is the mo&s;t excellent, and cu&s;tom will render it the mo&s;t delightful.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="122" REF="020531_0127_0FAFE2A5854DE130">13. Men, who&s;e circum&s;tances will permit them to chu&s;e their own way of life, are inexcu&s;able if they do not pur&s;ue that which their judgment tells them is the mo&s;t laudable. The voice of rea&s;on is more to be regarded than the bent of any pre&s;ent inclination, &s;ince by the rule above-mentioned, inclination will at length come over to rea&s;on, though we can never force rea&s;on to comply with inclination.</P>
<P N="14">14. In the third place, this ob&s;ervation may teach the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ual and irreligious man to overlook tho&s;e hard&s;hips and difficulties, which are apt to di&s;courage him from the pro&s;ecution of a virtuous life. The Gods, &s;aid He&s;iod, have placed labour before virtue; the way to her is at fir&s;t rough and difficult, but grows more &s;mooth and ea&s;y the farther you advance in it. The man who proceeds in it, with &s;teadine&s;s and re|&s;olution, will in a little time find that her ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and that all her paths are peace.</P>
<P N="15">15. To enforce this con&s;ideration, we may further ob&s;erve, that the practice of religion will not only be attended with that plea&s;ure, which naturally accom|panies tho&s;e actions to which we are habituated, but with tho&s;e &s;upernumerary joys of heart, that ri&s;e from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a plea&s;ure, from the &s;atisfaction of acting up to the dictates of rea&s;on, and from the pro&s;pect of an happy immortality.</P>
<P N="16">16. In the fourth place, we may learn from this ob&s;ervation which we have made on the mind of man, to take particular care, when we are once &s;ettled in a regular cour&s;e of life, how we too frequently in|dulge our&s;elves in any of the mo&s;t innocent diver&s;i|ons and entertainments, &s;ince the mind may in&s;en&s;i|bly fall off from the reli&s;h of virtuous actions, and, by degrees, exchange that plea&s;ure which it takes in the performance of its duty, for delights of a much more inferior and unprofitable nature.</P>
<P N="17">17. The la&s;t u&s;e which I &s;hall make of this remark|able property in human nature, of being delighted
<PB N="123" REF="020531_0128_0FAFE2A63AE85280">
with tho&s;e actions to which it is accu&s;tomed, is to &s;hew how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary it is for us to gain habits of virtue in this life, if we would enjoy the plea&s;ures of the next.</P>
<P N="18">18. The &s;tate of bli&s;s we call heaven, will not be capable of affecting tho&s;e minds, which are not thus qualified for it; we mu&s;t in this world gain a reli&s;h of truth and virtue, if we would be able to ta&s;te that knowledge and perfection which are to make us hap|py in the next. The &s;eeds of tho&s;e &s;piritual joys and raptures, which are to ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e up and flouri&s;h in the &s;oul to all eternity, mu&s;t be planted in it, during this its pre&s;ent &s;tate of probation. In &s;hort, heaven is not to be looked upon only as the reward, but as the na|tural effect of a religious life.</P>
<P N="19">19. On the other hand, tho&s;e evil &s;pirits, who, by long cu&s;tom, have contracted in the body, habits of lu&s;t, &s;en&s;uality, malice and revenge, an aver&s;ion to every thing that is good, ju&s;t, or laudable, are na|turally &s;ea&s;oned and prepared for pain and mi&s;ery. Their torments have already taken root in them; they cannot be happy when dive&s;ted of the body, un|le&s;s we may &s;uppo&s;e, that Providence will in a man|ner create them anew, and work a miracle in the rec|tification of their faculties.</P>
<P N="20">20. They may, indeed, ta&s;te a kind of malignant plea&s;ure in tho&s;e actions to which they are accu&s;tom|ed whil&s;t in this life; but when they are removed from all tho&s;e objects which are here apt to gratify them, they will naturally become their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ormen|tors, and cheri&s;h in them&s;elves tho&s;e painful habits of mind which are called in &s;cripture phra&s;e, the worm which never dies.</P>
<P N="21">21. This notion of heaven and hell is &s;o very con|formable to the light of nature, that it was di&s;covered by &s;everal of the mo&s;t exalted heathens. It has been finely improved by many eminent divines of the la&s;t age, as in particular by Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on and Dr. Sherlock; but there is none who has rai&s;ed &s;uch
<PB N="124" REF="020531_0129_0FAFE2A6FB66DD08">
noble &s;peculations upon it as Dr. Scott, in the fir&s;t book of his Chri&s;tian Life, which is one of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t rational &s;chemes of divinity, that is written in our tongue, or any other. That excellent author has &s;hewn how every particular cu&s;tom and habit of virtue will, in its own nature, produce the heaven, or a &s;tate of happine&s;s, in him who &s;hall hereafter practi&s;e it: as on the contrary, how every cu&s;tom or habit of vice will be the natural hell of him in whom it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts.</P>

<P N="1">1. I HAD occa&s;ion to go a few miles out of town, &s;ome days &s;ince, in a &s;tage-coach, where I had for my fellow travellers a dirty beau, and a pretty young Quaker woman. Having no inclination to talk much at that time, I placed my&s;elf backward, with a de&s;ign to &s;urvey them, and pick a &s;peculation out of my two companions. Their different figures were &s;ufficient of them&s;elves to draw my attention.</P>
<P N="2">2. The gentleman was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;uit, the ground whereof had been black, as I perceived from &s;ome few &s;paces that had e&s;caped the powder, which was incorporated with the greate&s;t part of his coat: his perriwig, which co&s;t no &s;mall &s;um, was after &s;o &s;lo|venly a manner ca&s;t over his &s;houlders, that it &s;eem|ed not to have been combed &s;ince the year 1712; his linen, which was not much concealed, was daubed with plain Spani&s;h from the chin to the lowe&s;t button, and the diamond upon his finger (which naturally dreaded the water) put me in mind how it &s;parkled amid&s;t the rubbi&s;h of the mine, where it was fir&s;t di&s;covered.</P>
<P N="3">3. On the other hand, the pretty Quaker appear|ed in all the elegance of cleanline&s;s. Not a &s;peck
<PB N="125" REF="020531_0130_0FAFE2A7B9D3ECB0">
was to be found on her. A clear clean oval face, ju&s;t edged about with little thin plaits of the pure&s;t cam|brick, received great advantages from the &s;hade of her black hood; as did the whitene&s;s of her arms from that &s;ober coloured &s;tuff, in which &s;he had cloathed her&s;elf. The plainne&s;s of her dre&s;s was very well &s;uited to the &s;implicity of her phra&s;es, all which put together, though they could not give me a great opinion of her religion, they did of her in|nocence.</P>
<P N="4">4. This adventure occa&s;ioned my throwing toge|ther a few hints upon <HI>cleanline&s;s,</HI> which I &s;hall con&s;i|der as one of the half virtues, as Ari&s;totle calls them, and &s;hall recommend it under the three following heads: As it is a mark of politene&s;s: as it produces love; and as it bears analogy to purity of mind.</P>
<P N="5">5. Fir&s;t, it is a mark of politene&s;s. It is univer|&s;ally agreed upon, that no one, unadorned with this virtue, can go into company without giving a mani|fe&s;t offence. The ea&s;ier or higher any one's fortune is, this duty ri&s;es proportionably. The different na|tions of the world are as much di&s;tingui&s;hed by their cleanline&s;s, as by their arts and &s;ciences. The more any country is civilized, the more they con&s;ult this part of politene&s;s. We need but compare our ideas of a female Hottentot with an Engli&s;h beauty to be &s;atisfied of the truth of what hath been advanced.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the next place, cleanline&s;s may be &s;aid to be the fo&s;ter-mother of love. Beauty indeed mo&s;t com|monly produces that pa&s;&s;ion in the mind, but clean|line&s;s pre&s;erves it. An indifferent face and per&s;on, kept in perpetual neatne&s;s, hath won many a heart from a pretty &s;lattern. Age it&s;elf is not unamiable, while it is pre&s;erved clean and un&s;ullied: like a piece of metal con&s;tantly kept &s;mooth and bright, we look on it with more plea&s;ure than on a new ve&s;|&s;el that is cankered with ru&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. I might ob&s;erve further, that as cleanline&s;s renders us agreeable to others, &s;o it makes us ea&s;y to
<PB N="126" REF="020531_0131_0FAFE2A884280A88">
our&s;elves; that it is an excellent pre&s;ervative of health: and that &s;everal vices, de&s;tructive both to mind and body, are incon&s;i&s;tent with the habit of it. But the&s;e reflections I &s;hall leave to the lei&s;ure of my readers, and &s;hall ob&s;erve in the third place, that it bears a great analogy with purity of mind, and naturally in&s;pires refined &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="8">8. We find, from experience, that through the prevalence of cu&s;tom, the mo&s;t vicious actions lo&s;e their horror, by being made familiar to us. On the contrary, tho&s;e who live in the neighbourhood of good examples, fly from the fir&s;t appearances of what is &s;hocking. It fares with us much after the &s;ame manner as our ideas. Our &s;en&s;es, which are the inlets to all the images conveyed to the mind, can only tran&s;mit the impre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch things as u|&s;ually &s;urround them. So that pure and un&s;ullied thoughts are naturally &s;ugge&s;ted to the mind, by tho&s;e objects that perpetually encompa&s;s us, when they are beautiful and elegant in their kind.</P>
<P N="9">9. In the Ea&s;t, where the warmth of the climate makes cleanline&s;s more immediately nece&s;&s;ary than in colder countries, it is made one part of their reli|gion: the Jewi&s;h law (and the Mahometan, which in &s;ome things copies after it) is filled with bathings, purifications and other rites of the like nature. Though there is the above-named convenient rea&s;on to be a&s;&s;igned for the&s;e ceremonies, the chief inten|tion undoubtedly was to typify inward purity and cleanline&s;s of heart by tho&s;e outward wa&s;hings.</P>
<P N="10">10. We read &s;everal injunctions of this kind in the book of Deuteronomy, which confirm this truth; and which are but ill accounted for by &s;aying as &s;ome do, that they were only in&s;tituted for convenience in the de&s;ert, which otherways could not have been habit|able for &s;o many years.</P>
<P N="11">11. I &s;hall conclude this e&s;&s;ay, with a &s;tory which I have &s;omewhere read in an account of Mahometan &s;uper&s;tition. A Dervi&s;e of great &s;anctity one morn|ing
<PB N="127" REF="020531_0132_0FAFE2A943FA8248">
had the misfortune as he took up a cry&s;tal cup, which was con&s;ecrated to the prophet, to let it fall upon the ground and da&s;h it in pieces. His &s;on com|ing in &s;ome time after, he &s;tretched out his hand to ble&s;s him, as his manner was every morning; but the youth going out &s;tumbled over the thre&s;hold and broke his arm. As the old man wondered at the&s;e events, a caravan pa&s;&s;ed by in its way from Mecca. The Dervi&s;e approached it to beg a ble&s;&s;ing; but as he &s;troked one of the holy camels, he received a kick from the bea&s;t, that &s;orely brui&s;ed him. His &s;orrow and amazement increa&s;ed upon him, till he recollect|ed that through hurry and inadvertency he had that morning come abroad without wa&s;hing his hands.</P>

<HEAD>The Advantages of a good Education.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I Con&s;ider a human &s;oul without education like marble in the quarry, which &s;hews none of its inherent beauties, until the &s;kill of the poli&s;her fetch|es out the colours, makes the &s;urface &s;hine, and di&s;|covers every ornamental cloud, &s;pot, and vein, that runs through the body of it. Education, after the &s;ame manner, when it works upon a noble mind, draws out to view every latent virtue and perfection, which, without &s;uch helps, are never able to make their appearance.</P>
<P N="2">2. If my reader will give me leave to change the allu&s;ion &s;o &s;oon upon him, I &s;hall make u&s;e of the &s;ame in&s;tance to illu&s;trate the force of education, which Ari&s;totle has brought to explain his doctrine of &s;ub&s;tantial forms, when he tells us that a &s;tatue lies hid in a block of marble; and that the art of the &s;tatuary only clears away the &s;uperfluous matter, and removes the rubbi&s;h. The figure is in the &s;tone, the &s;culptor only finds it. What &s;culpture is to a block of marble, education is to an human &s;oul.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="128" REF="020531_0133_0FAFE2AA0873E120">3. The philo&s;opher, the &s;aint, or the hero, the wi&s;e, the good, or the great man, very often lie hid and concealed in a plebeian, which a proper educati|on might have di&s;interred, and have brought to light. I am therefore much delighted with reading the accounts of &s;avage nations, and with contemplating tho&s;e virtues which are wild and uncultivated; to &s;ee courage exerting it&s;elf in fiercene&s;s, re&s;olution in ob&s;tinacy, wi&s;dom in cunning, patience in &s;ullen|ne&s;s and de&s;pair.</P>
<P N="4">4. Mens pa&s;&s;ions operate variou&s;ly, and appear in different kinds of actions, according as they are more or le&s;s rectified and &s;wayed by rea&s;on. When one hears of negroes, who upon the death of their ma&s;ters, or upon changing their &s;ervice, hang them|&s;elves upon the next tree, as it frequently happens in our American plantations, who can forbear ad|miring their fidelity, though it expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf in &s;o dreadful a manner?</P>
<P N="5">5. What might not that &s;avage greatne&s;s of &s;oul which appears in the&s;e poor wretches on many occa|&s;ions, be rai&s;ed to, were it rightly cultivated? and what colour of excu&s;e can there be for the contempt with which we treat this part of our &s;pecies? that we &s;hould not put them upon the common foot of huma|nity; that we &s;hould only &s;et an in&s;ignificant fine upon the man who murders them; nay, that we &s;hould, as much as in us lies, cut them off from the pro&s;pects of happine&s;s in another world, as well as in this, and deny them that which we look upon as the pro|per means for attaining it.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is therefore an un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ing to be born in tho&s;e parts of the world where wi&s;dom and knowledge flouri&s;h; though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed there are, even in the&s;e parts, &s;everal poor unin&s;tructed per&s;ons, who are but little above the inhabitants of tho&s;e nations of which I have been here &s;peaking; as tho&s;e who have had the advantages of a more libe|ral education, ri&s;e above one another by &s;everal dif|ferent degrees of perfection.</P>

<HEAD>Learning a nece&s;&s;ary Accompli&s;hment in a Woman of Quality or Fortune.</HEAD>
<BIBL>GUARDIAN, No. 155.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. I HAVE often wondered that learning is not thought a proper ingredient in the education of a woman of quality or fortune. Since they have the &s;ame improveable minds as the male part of the &s;pecies, why &s;hould they not be cultivated by the &s;ame method? why &s;hould rea&s;on be left to it&s;elf in one of the &s;exes, and be di&s;ciplined with &s;o much care in the other?</P>
<P N="2">2. There are &s;ome rea&s;ons why learning &s;eems more adapted to the female world than to the male. As in the fir&s;t place, becau&s;e they have more &s;pare time upon their hands, and lead a more &s;edentary life. Their employments are of a dome&s;tic nature, and not like tho&s;e of the other &s;ex, which are often incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;tudy and contemplation.</P>
<P N="3">3. The excellent lady, the lady Lizard, in the &s;pace of one &s;ummer furni&s;hed a gallery with chairs and couches of her own and her daughters working; and at the &s;ame time heard all Dr. Tillot&s;on's &s;er|mons twice over. It is always the cu&s;tom for one of the young ladies to read, while the others are at work; &s;o that the learning of the family is not at all prejudicial to its manufacturers.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="130" REF="020531_0135_0FAFE2AB8959FB60">4. I was mightily plea&s;ed the other day to find them all bu&s;y in pre&s;erving &s;everal fruits of the &s;ea&s;on, with the Sparkler in the mid&s;t of them, reading over 'The plurality of worlds.' It was very enter|taining to me to &s;ee them dividing their &s;peculations between jellies and &s;tars, and making a &s;udden tran|&s;ition from the &s;un to an apricot, or from the Coper|nican &s;y&s;tem to the figure of a chee&s;e cake.</P>
<P N="5">5. A &s;econd rea&s;on why women &s;hould apply them|&s;elves to u&s;eful knowledge rather than men, is be|cau&s;e they have that natural gift of &s;peech in greater perfection. Since they have &s;o excellent a talent, &s;uch a <HI>Copia Verborum,</HI> or plenty of words, it is pity they &s;hould not put it to &s;ome u&s;e. If the female tongue will be in motion, why &s;hould it not be &s;et to go right? Could they di&s;cour&s;e about the &s;pots in the &s;un, it might divert them from publi&s;hing the faults of their neighbours: could they talk of the different a&s;pects and conjunctions of the planets, they need not be at the pains to comment upon oglings and clande&s;tine marriages. In &s;hort, were they fur|ni&s;hed with matters of fact, out of arts and &s;ciences, it would now and then be of great ea&s;e to their in|vention.</P>
<P N="6">6. There is another rea&s;on why tho&s;e, e&s;pecially who are women of quality, &s;hould apply them&s;elves to letters, namely, becau&s;e their hu&s;bands are gene|rally &s;trangers to them. It is great pity there &s;hould be no knowledge in a family. For my own part, I am concerned when I go into a great hou&s;e, where perhaps there is not a &s;ingle per&s;on that can &s;pell, unle&s;s it be by chance the butler, or one of the foot|men. What a figure is the young heir likely to make, who is a dunce both by father and mother's &s;ide?</P>
<P N="7">7. If we look into the hi&s;tories of famous women, we find many eminent philo&s;ophers of this &s;ex. Nay, we find that &s;everal females have di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves in tho&s;e &s;ects of philo&s;ophy which &s;eem almo&s;t
<PB N="131" REF="020531_0136_0FAFE2AC47F097C0">
repugnant to their natures. There have been fa|mous female Pythagoreans, notwith&s;tanding mo&s;t of that philo&s;ophy con&s;i&s;ted in keeping a &s;ecret, and that the di&s;ciple was to hold her tongue five years together.</P>
<P N="8">8. Learning and knowledge are perfections in us, not as we are men, but as we are rea&s;onable creatures, in which order of beings the female world is upon the &s;ame level with the male. We ought to con&s;ider in this particular, not what is the &s;ex, but what is the &s;pecies to which they belong. At lea&s;t, I believe every one will allow me, that a female philo&s;opher is not &s;o ab&s;urd a character and &s;o oppo&s;ite to the &s;ex, as a female game&s;ter; and that it is more irrational for a woman to pa&s;s away half a dozen hours at cards or dice, than in getting up &s;tores of u&s;eful learning.</P>
<P N="9">9. This therefore is another rea&s;on why I would recommend the &s;tudies of knowledge to the female world, that they may not be at a lo&s;s how to employ tho&s;e hours that lie upon their hands.</P>
<P N="10">10. I might al&s;o add this motive to my fair rea|ders, that &s;everal of their &s;ex, who have improved their minds by books and literature, have rai&s;ed them&s;elves to the highe&s;t po&s;ts of honour and fortune. A neighbouring nation may at this time furni&s;h us with a very remarkable in&s;tance of this kind; but I &s;hall conclude this head with the hi&s;tory of Athenais, which is a very &s;ignal example to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="11">11. The emperor Theodo&s;ius being about the age of one and twenty, and de&s;igning to take a wi&s;e, de|&s;ired his &s;i&s;ter Pulcheria and his friend Paulinus to &s;earch his whole empire for a woman of the mo&s;t ex|qui&s;ite beauty and highe&s;t accompli&s;hments. In the mid&s;t of this &s;earch, Athenais, a Grecian virgin, accidentally offered her&s;elf. Her father, who was an eminent philo&s;opher of Athens, and had bred her up in all the learning of that place, at his death left her but a very &s;mall portion, in which al&s;o &s;he &s;uffer|ed great hard&s;hips from the inju&s;tice of her two brothers.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="132" REF="020531_0137_0FAFE2AE67E852E8">12. This forced her upon a journey to Con&s;tanti|nople, where &s;he had a relation who repre&s;ented her ca&s;e to Pulcheria, in order to obtain &s;ome redre&s;s from the emperor. By this means that religious prince&s;s became acquainted with Athenais, whom &s;he found the mo&s;t beautiful woman of her age, and educated under a long cour&s;e of philo&s;ophy in the &s;tricte&s;t virtue, and mo&s;t un&s;potted innocence.</P>
<P N="13">13. Pulcheria was charmed with her conver&s;ation, and immediately made her report to the emperor her brother Theodo&s;ius. The character &s;he gave made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on him, that he de&s;ired his &s;i&s;ter to bring her away immediately to the lodgings of his friend Paulinus, where he found her beauty and her conver&s;ation beyond the highe&s;t idea he had framed of them.</P>
<P N="14">14. His friend Paulinus converted her to Chri&s;ti|anity, and gave her the name of Eudo&s;ia; after which the emperor publicly e&s;pou&s;ed her, and enjoyed all the happine&s;s in his marriage which he promi&s;ed him&s;elf from &s;uch a virtuous and learned bride. She not only forgave the injuries which her two brothers had done her, but rai&s;ed them to great honours; and by &s;everal works of learning, as well as by an exem|plary life, made her&s;elf &s;o dear to the whole empire, that &s;he had many &s;tatues erected to her memory, and is celebrated by the fathers of the church as an ornament of her &s;ex.</P>

<P N="7">7. It is not difficult to a man to &s;ee that a per&s;on has conceived an aver&s;ion to him.

<HEAD>A good Con&s;cience the be&s;t Security again&s;t Calumny and Reproach.</HEAD>

<P N="1">1. A GOOD con&s;cience is to the &s;oul what health is to the body; it pre&s;erves a con&s;tant ea&s;e and &s;erenity within us, and more than countervails all the calamities and afflictions which can po&s;&s;ibly befal us. I know nothing &s;o hard for a generous

mind to get over as calumny and reproach, and can|not find any method of quieting the &s;oul under them, be&s;ides this &s;ingle one, of our being con&s;cious to our|&s;elves that we do not de&s;erve them.</P>
<P N="2">2. I have been always mightily plea&s;ed with that pa&s;&s;age in Don Quixote, where the fanta&s;tical knight is repre&s;ented as loading a gentleman of good &s;en&s;e with prai&s;es and elogiums. Upon which the gentle|man makes this reflection to him&s;elf: how grateful is prai&s;e to human nature!</P>
<P N="3">3. I cannot forbear being &s;ecretly plea&s;ed with the commendations I receive, though I am &s;en&s;ible it is a madman that be&s;tows them on me. In the &s;ame manner, though we are often &s;ure that the cen&s;ures which are pa&s;&s;ed upon us are uttered by tho&s;e who know nothing of us, and have neither means nor abi|lities to form a right judgment of us, we cannot for|bear being grieved at what they &s;ay.</P>
<P N="4">4. In order to heal this infirmity, which is &s;o na|tural to the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of men, I have taken a particular plea&s;ure in ob&s;erving the conduct of the old philo&s;ophers, how they bore them&s;elves up again&s;t the malice and detraction of their enemies.</P>
<P N="5">5. The way to &s;ilence calumny, &s;ays Bias, is to be always exerci&s;ed in &s;uch things as are prai&s;e-worthy. Socrates, after having received &s;entence, told his friends that he had always accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to re|gard truth and not cen&s;ure, and that he was not trou|bled at his condemnation, becau&s;e he knew him&s;elf free from guilt. It was in the &s;ame &s;pirit that he heard the accu&s;ations of his two great adver&s;aries, who had uttered again&s;t him the mo&s;t virulent re|proaches.</P>
<P N="6">6. Anytus and Melitus, &s;ays he, may procure &s;en|tence again&s;t me, but they cannot hurt me. This divine philo&s;opher was &s;o well fortified in his own in|nocence, that he neglected all the impotence of evil tongues which were engaged in his de&s;truction. This was properly the &s;upport of a good con&s;cience, that
<PB N="138" REF="020531_0143_0FAFE2B2445E5CC8">
contradicted the reports which had been rai&s;ed again&s;t him, and cleared him to him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="7">7. Others of the philo&s;ophers rather cho&s;e to re|tort the injury of a &s;mart reply, than thus to di&s;arm it with re&s;pect to them&s;elves. They &s;how that it &s;tung them, though at the &s;ame time they had the addre&s;s to make their aggre&s;&s;ors &s;uffer with them. Of this kind is Ari&s;totle's reply to one who pur&s;ued him with long and bitter invectives. You, &s;ays he, who are u&s;ed to &s;uffer reproaches, utter them with delight; I who have not been u&s;ed to utter them, take no plea|&s;ure in hearing them.</P>
<P N="8">8. Diogenes was &s;till more &s;evere on one who &s;poke ill of him: no body will believe you when you &s;peak ill of me, any more than they would believe me &s;hould I &s;peak well of you.</P>
<P>In the&s;e and many other in&s;tances I could produce, the bitterne&s;s of the an&s;wer &s;ufficiently te&s;tifies the unea&s;ine&s;s of mind the per&s;on was under who made it.</P>
<P N="9">9. I would rather advi&s;e my reader, if he has not in this ca&s;e the &s;ecret con&s;olation, that he de&s;erves no &s;uch reproaches as are ca&s;t upon him, to follow the advice of Epictetus: If any one &s;peaks ill of thee, con&s;ider whether he has truth on his &s;ide; and if &s;o, reform thy&s;elf, that his cen&s;ures may not affect thee.</P>
<P N="10">10. When Anaximander was told that the very boys laughed at his &s;inging: Ay, &s;ays he, then I mu&s;t learn to &s;ing better. But of all the &s;ayings of philo&s;ophers which I have gathered together for my own u&s;e on this occa&s;ion, there are none which carry in them more candour and good &s;en&s;e than the two following ones of Plato.</P>
<P N="11">11. Being told that he had many enemies who &s;poke ill of him: it is no matter, &s;aid he, I will live &s;o that none &s;hall believe them. Hearing at another time, that an intimate friend of his had &s;poken de|tractingly of him: I am &s;ure he would not do it, &s;ays he, if he had not &s;ome rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="139" REF="020531_0144_0FAFE2B306326148">12. This is the &s;ure&s;t as well as the noble&s;t way of drawing the &s;ting out of a reproach, and a true me|thod of preparing a man for that great and only relief again&s;t the pains of calumny, 'a good con&s;cience.'</P>
<P N="13">13. I de&s;igned, in this e&s;&s;ay, to &s;how, that there is no happine&s;s wanting to him who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this excellent frame of mind, and that no per&s;on can be mi&s;erable who is in the enjoyment of it; but I find this &s;ubject &s;o well treated in one of Dr. South's &s;er|mons, that I &s;hall fill this Saturday's paper with a pa&s;&s;age of it, which cannot but make the man's heart burn within him, who reads it with due attention.</P>
<P N="14">14. That admirable author, having &s;hewn the vir|tue of a good con&s;cience, in &s;upporting a man under the greate&s;t trials and difficulties of life, concludes with repre&s;enting its force and efficacy in the hour of death.</P>
<P N="15">15. The third and la&s;t in&s;tance, in which above all others this confidence towards God does mo&s;t emi|nently &s;how and exert it&s;elf, is at the time of death; which &s;urely gives the grand opportunity of trying both the &s;trength and worth of every principle.</P>
<P N="16">16. When a man &s;hall be ju&s;t about to quit the &s;tage of this world, to put off his mortality, and to deliver up his la&s;t accounts to God; at which &s;ad time his memory &s;hall &s;erve him for little el&s;e, but to ter|rify him with a frightful review of his pa&s;t life, and his former extravagancies &s;tripped of all their plea|&s;ure, but retaining their guilt: what is it then that can promi&s;e him a fair pa&s;&s;age into the other world, or a comfortable appearance before his dreadful judge when he is there?</P>
<P N="17">17. Not all the friends and intere&s;ts, all the riches and honours under heaven can &s;peak &s;o much as a word for him, or one word of comfort to him in that condition; they may po&s;&s;ibly reproach, but they can|not relieve him.</P>
<P N="18">18. No, at this di&s;con&s;olate time, when the bu&s;y tempter &s;hall be more than u&s;ually apt to vex and

<P N="19">19. And the te&s;timony of that &s;hall make the com|forts of heaven de&s;cend upon his weary head, like a refre&s;hing dew, or &s;hower upon a parched ground. It &s;hall give him &s;ome lively earne&s;ts, and &s;ecret anti|cipations of his approaching joy. It &s;hall bid his &s;oul go out of the body undauntedly, and lift up his head with confidence before &s;aints and angels. Surely the comfort, which it conveys at this &s;ea&s;on, is &s;ome|thing bigger than the capacities of mortality, mighty and un&s;peakable, and not to be under&s;tood until it comes to be felt.</P>
<P N="20">20. And now who would not quit all the plea&s;ures, and tra&s;h, and trifles, which are apt to captivate the heart of man, and pur&s;ue the great rigours of piety, and au&s;terities of a good life, to purcha&s;e to him&s;elf &s;uch a con&s;cience, as at the hour of death, when all the friend&s;hip in the world &s;hall bid him adieu, and the whole creation turns its back upon him, &s;hall di&s;|mi&s;s the &s;oul and clo&s;e his eyes with that ble&s;&s;ed &s;en|tence, 'Well done thou good and faithful &s;ervant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'</P>

<BIBL>SPECTATOR, No. 574.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. I Was once engaged in di&s;cour&s;e with a Ro&s;icruci|an about the <HI>great &s;ecret.</HI> As this kind of men (I mean tho&s;e of them who are not profe&s;&s;ed cheats) are over-run with enthu&s;ia&s;m and philo&s;ophy, it was very amu&s;ing to hear this religious adept de&s;canting
<PB N="141" REF="020531_0146_0FAFE2B483EB18F8">
on his pretended di&s;covery. He talked of the &s;ecret as of a &s;pirit which lived within an emerald, and converted every thing that was near it to the highe&s;t perfection it is capable of.</P>
<P N="2">2. It gives a lu&s;tre, &s;ays he, to the &s;un, and water to the diamond. It irradiates every metal, and en|riches lead with all the properties of gold. It height|ens &s;moke into flame, flame into light, and light into glory. He further added, that a &s;ingle ray of it di&s;&s;ipates pain, and care, and melancholy, from the per&s;on on whom it falls. In &s;hort, &s;ays he, its pre&s;ence naturally changes every place into a kind of heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3. After he had gone on for &s;ome time in this un|intelligible cant, I found that he jumbled natural and moral ideas together in the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e, and that his great &s;ecret was nothing el&s;e but content.</P>
<P N="4">4. This virtue does indeed produce, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, all tho&s;e effects which the alchymi&s;t u&s;ually a&s;|cribes to what he calls the philo&s;opher's &s;tone; and if it does not bring riches, it does the &s;ame thing, by bani&s;hing the de&s;ire of them. If it cannot remove the di&s;quietudes ari&s;ing out of a man's mind, body, or fortune, it makes him ea&s;y under them. It has indeed a kindly influence on the &s;oul of man, in re&s;|pect of every being to whom he &s;tands related. It extingui&s;hes all murmur, repining and ingratitude towards that Being who has allotted him his part to act in this world. It de&s;troys all inordinate ambition, and every tendency to corruption, with regard to the community wherein he is placed. It gives &s;weet|ne&s;s to his conver&s;ation, and a perpetual &s;erenity to all his thoughts.</P>
<P N="5">5. Among the many methods which might be made u&s;e of for the acquiring of this virtue, I &s;hall only mention the two following. Fir&s;t of all, a man &s;hould always con&s;ider how much he has more than he wants: and &s;econdly, how much more unhappy he might be than he really is.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="142" REF="020531_0147_0FAFE2B58839CDF0">6. Fir&s;t of all, a man &s;hould always con&s;ider how much more he has than he wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. I am wonderfully plea&s;ed with the reply which Ari&s;tippus made to one who condoled him upon the lo&s;s of a farm: 'Why, &s;aid he, I have three farms &s;till, and you have but one; &s;o that I ought rather to be afflicted for you than you for me.' On the contrary, fooli&s;h men are more apt to con&s;ider what they have lo&s;t than what they po&s;&s;e&s;s; and to fix their eyes upon tho&s;e who are richer than them&s;elves, rather than on tho&s;e who are under greater difficulties.</P>
<P N="7">7. All the real plea&s;ures and conveniences of life lie in a narrow compa&s;s; but it is the humour of man|kind to be always looking forward, and &s;training after one who has got the &s;tart of them in wealth and honour. For this rea&s;on, as there are none can be properly called rich, who have not more than they want: there are few rich men in any of the politer na|tions but among the middle &s;ort of people, who keep their wi&s;hes within their fortunes, and have more wealth than they know how to enjoy.</P>
<P N="8">8. Per&s;ons of a higher rank live in a kind of &s;plen|did poverty, and are perpetually wanting, becau&s;e, in&s;tead of acquie&s;cing in the &s;olid plea&s;ures of life, they endeavour to outvy one another in &s;hadows and appearances. Men of &s;en&s;e have at all times beheld with a great deal of mirth this &s;illy game that is play|ing over their heads, and by contracting their de&s;ires enjoy all that &s;ecret &s;atisfaction which others are al|ways in que&s;t of.</P>
<P N="9">9. The truth is, this ridiculous cha&s;e after imagina|ry plea&s;ures cannot be &s;ufficiently expo&s;ed, as it is the great &s;ource of tho&s;e evils which generally undo a na|tion. Let a man's e&s;tate be what it will, he is a poor man, if he does not live within it, and naturally &s;ets him&s;elf to &s;ale to any one that can give him his price.</P>
<P N="10">10. When Pitticus, after the death of his brother, who had left him a good e&s;tate, was offered a greater &s;um of money by the king of Lydia, he thanked
<PB N="143" REF="020531_0148_0FAFE2B7A3EE97D8">
him for his kindne&s;s, but told him he had already more by half than he knew what to do with. In &s;hort, content is equivalent to wealth, and luxury to poverty; or to give the thought a more agreeable turn, 'Content is natural wealth,' &s;ays Socrates; to which I &s;hall add, 'Luxury is artificial poverty.'</P>
<P N="11">11. I &s;hall therefore recommend to the con&s;idera|tion of tho&s;e who are always aiming after &s;uperfluous and imaginary enjoyments, and will not be at the trouble of contracting their de&s;ires, an excellent &s;ay|ing of Bion the philo&s;opher; namely, 'That no man has &s;o much care, as he who endeavours after the mo&s;t happine&s;s.'</P>
<P N="12">12. In the &s;econd place, every one ought to reflect how much more unhappy he might be than he really is. The former con&s;ideration took in all tho&s;e who are &s;ufficiently provided with the means to make them&s;elves ea&s;y; this regards &s;uch as actually lie un|der &s;ome pre&s;&s;ure or misfortune.</P>
<P N="13">13. The&s;e may receive a great alleviation from &s;uch a compari&s;on as the unhappy per&s;on may make between him&s;elf and others, or between the misfor|tunes which he &s;uffers, and greater misfortunes which might have befallen him.</P>
<P N="14">14. I like the &s;tory of the hone&s;t Dutchman, who, upon breaking his leg by a fall from the main-ma&s;t, told the &s;tanders-by, it was a great mercy that it was not his neck. To which, &s;ince I am got into quota|tions, give me leave to add the &s;aying of an old phi|lo&s;opher, who, after having invited &s;ome of his friends to dine with him, was ruffled b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his wife that came into the room in a pa&s;&s;ion, and threw down the table that &s;tood before them; 'Every one, &s;ays he, has his calamity, and he is a happy man that has no greater than this.'</P>
<P N="15">15. We find an in&s;tance to the &s;ame purpo&s;e in the life of Doctor Hammond, written by Bi&s;hop Fell.

u&s;ed to thank God that it was not the &s;tone; and when he had the &s;tone, that he had not both the&s;e di&s;tempers on him at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P N="16">16. I cannot conclude this e&s;&s;ay without ob&s;erving, that there was never any &s;y&s;tem be&s;ides that of Chri&s;|tianity, which could effectually produce in the mind of man the virtue I have been hitherto &s;peaking of. In order to make us content with our pre&s;ent condi|tion, many of the pre&s;ent philo&s;ophers tell us that our di&s;content only hurts our&s;elves, without being a|ble to make an alteration in our circum&s;tances; others, that whatever evil befals us is derived to us by a fatal nece&s;&s;ity, to which the Gods them&s;elves are &s;ubject; while others very gravely tell the man who is mi&s;erable, that it is nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be &s;o to keep up the harmony of the univer&s;e, and that the <HI>&s;cheme</HI> of Providence would be troubled and pervert|ed were he otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="17">17. The&s;e, and the like con&s;iderations, rather &s;i|lence than &s;atisfy a man. They may &s;hew him that his di&s;content is unrea&s;onable, but are by no means &s;ufficient to relieve it. They rather give de&s;pair than con&s;olation. In a word, a man might reply to one of the&s;e comforters, as Augu&s;tus did to his friend who advi&s;ed him not to grieve for the death of a per|&s;on whom he loved, becau&s;e his grief could not fetch him again: 'It is for that very rea&s;on, &s;aid the em|peror, that I grieve.'</P>
<P N="18">18. On the contrary, religion bears a more tender regard to human nature. It pre&s;cribes to a very mi|&s;erable man the means of bettering his condition; nay, it &s;hews him that the bearing of his afflictions as he ought to do, will naturally end in the removal of them: it makes him ea&s;y here, becau&s;e it can make him happy hereafter.</P>
<P N="19">19. Upon the whole, a contented mind is the great|e&s;t ble&s;&s;ing a man can enjoy in this world; and if in the pre&s;ent life his happine&s;s ari&s;es from the &s;ubduing his de&s;ires, it will ari&s;e in the next from the gratifi|cation of them.</P>

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. As I was ruminating on the&s;e two remarks, and &s;eated in my elbow chair, I in&s;en&s;ibly fell a&s;leep; when, on a &s;udden, methought there was a procla|mation made by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> that every mortal &s;hould bring in his griefs and calamities, and throw them together in a heap. There was a large plain ap|pointed for this purpo&s;e. I took my &s;tand in the cen|tre of it, and &s;aw with a great deal of plea&s;ure, the whole human &s;pecies marching one after another, and throwing down their &s;everal loads, which immediate|ly grew up into a prodigious mountain, that &s;eemed to ri&s;e above the clouds.</P>
<P N="3">3. There was a certain lady, of a thin airy &s;hape, who was very active in this &s;olemnity. She carried a magnifying-gla&s;s in one of her hands, and was cloathed in a loo&s;e flowing robe, embroidered with &s;everal figures of fiends and &s;pectres, that di&s;covered them&s;elves in a thou&s;and chimerical &s;hapes, as her garment hovered in the wind.

There were multitudes of lovers &s;addled with very whim&s;ical burthens, compo&s;ed of darts and flames; but what was very odd, though they &s;ighed as if their hearts would break under the&s;e bundles of calamities, they could not per&s;uade them&s;elves to ca&s;t them into the heap, when they came up to it; but, after a few faint efforts, &s;hook their heads and marched away, as heavy laden as they came.</P>

There were very great heaps of red no&s;es, large lips, and ru&s;ty teeth. The truth of it is, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the greate&s;t part of the mountain made up of bodily deformities. Ob&s;erving one advancing towards the heap with a larger cargo than ordinary upon his back, I found upon his near approach, that it was only a natural hump, which he di&s;po&s;ed of with great joy of heart, among this col|lection of human mi&s;eries.</P>
<P N="8">8. There were likewi&s;e di&s;tempers of all &s;orts, though I could not but ob&s;erve, that there were ma|ny more imaginary than real. One little packet I could not but take notice of, which was a complica|tion of the di&s;ea&s;es incident to human nature, and was in the hands of a great many fine people: this was called the &s;pleen. But what mo&s;t of all &s;urpri&s;ed me, was a remark I made, that there was not a &s;ingle vice or folly thrown into the whole heap: at which I was very much a&s;toni&s;hed, having concluded within
<PB N="147" REF="020531_0152_0FAFE2BA82932A18">
my&s;elf, that every one would take this opportunity of getting rid of his pa&s;&s;ions, prejudices and frailties.</P>
<P N="9">9. I took notice in particular of a very profligate fellow, who I did not que&s;tion came laden with his crimes, but upon &s;earching into his bundle, I found, that in&s;tead of throwing his guilt from him, he had only laid down his memory. He was followed by another worthle&s;s rogue, who &s;lung away his mode&s;ty in&s;tead of his ignorance.</P>
<P N="10">10. When the whole race of mankind had thus ca&s;t their burdens, the <HI>phantom</HI> which had been &s;o bu&s;y on this occa&s;ion, &s;eeing me an idle &s;pectator of what pa&s;&s;ed, approached towards me. I grew unea&s;y at her pre&s;ence, when on a &s;udden &s;he laid her magni|fying gla&s;s full before my eyes. I no &s;ooner &s;aw my face in it but was &s;tartled at the &s;hortne&s;s of it, which now appeared to me in its utmo&s;t aggravation.</P>
<P N="11">11. The immoderate breadth of my features made me very much out of humour with my own counte|nance, upon which I threw it from me like a ma&s;k. It happened very luckily, that one who &s;tood by me had ju&s;t before thrown down his vi&s;age, which, it &s;eems, was too long for him. It was indeed extended to a mo&s;t &s;hameful length; I believe the very chin was mode&s;tly &s;peaking, as long as my whole face.</P>
<P N="12">12. We had both of us an opportunity of mend|ing our&s;elves, and all the contributions being now brought in, every man was at liberty to exchange his misfortune for tho&s;e of another per&s;on. But as there aro&s;e many new incidents in the &s;equel of my vi&s;ion, I &s;hall pur&s;ue this &s;ubject further, as the mo|ral which may be drawn from it is applicable to per&s;ons of all degrees and &s;tations in life.</P>
<P N="13">13. I Gave my reader a &s;ight of that mountain of mi&s;eries, which was made up of tho&s;e &s;everal calamities that afflict the minds of men. I &s;aw with un&s;peakable plea&s;ure, the whole &s;pecies th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s delivered from its &s;orrows: though, at the &s;ame time, as we

&s;tood round the heap, and &s;urveyed the &s;everal ma|terials of which it was compo&s;ed, there was &s;carce a mortal, in this va&s;t multitude, who did not di&s;cover what he thought plea&s;ures and ble&s;&s;ings of life; and wondered how the owners of them ever came to look upon them as burthens and grievances.</P>
<P N="14">14. As we were regarding very attentively this confu&s;ion of mi&s;eries, this chaos of calamity, <HI>Jupi|ter</HI> i&s;&s;ued out a &s;econd proclamation, that every one was now at liberty to exchange his affliction, and to return to his habitation with any &s;uch other bundle as &s;hould be delivered to him.</P>
<P N="15">15. Upon this, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ancy</HI> began a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in to be&s;tir her&s;elf, and parcelling out the whole heap, with incredible activity, recommended to every one his particular packet. The hurry and confu&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this time was not to be expre&s;&s;ed. Some ob&s;ervations, which I made upon the occa&s;ion, I &s;hall communicate to the reader. A venerable grey-headed man, who had laid down the colic, and who I found wanted an heir to his e&s;tate, &s;natched up an undutiful &s;on, that had been thrown into the heap by his angry father.</P>
<P N="16">16. The gracele&s;s youth, in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, pulled the old gentleman by the beard, and had like to have knocked his brains out; &s;o that meeting the true father, who came towards him in a fit of the gripes, he begged him to take his &s;on again, and give him back his colic; but they were incapa|ble either of them to recede from the choice they had made.</P>
<P N="17">17. A poor galley-&s;lave, who had thrown down his chains, took up the gout in their &s;tead, but made &s;uch wry faces, that one might ea&s;ily perceive he was no great gainer by the bargain. It was plea&s;ant e|nough to &s;ee the &s;everal exchanges that were made, for &s;ickne&s;s again&s;t poverty, hunger again&s;t want of appetite, and care again&s;t pain.</P>
<P N="18">18. The female world were very bu&s;y among them|&s;elves in bartering for features; one was trucking a

lock of grey hairs for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> carbuncle, another was mak|ing over a &s;hort wai&s;t for a pair of round &s;houlders, and a third cheapening a bad face for a lo&s;t reputa|tion: but on all the&s;e occa&s;ions, there was not one of them who did not think the new blemi&s;h, as &s;oon as &s;he had got it into her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, much more di&s;a|greeable than the old one.</P>
<P N="19">19. I made the &s;ame ob&s;ervation on every other misfortune or calamity, which every one in the a&s;|&s;embly brought upon him&s;elf, in lieu of what he had parted with; whether it be that all the evils which befall us are in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;uited and proportion|ed to our &s;trength, or that every evil b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">omes more &s;upportable by our being accu&s;tomed to it, I &s;hall not determine.</P>
<P N="20">20. I could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot, for my heart, forbear pitying the poor hump-backed gentleman mentioned in the for|mer paper, who went off a very well-&s;haped per&s;on with a &s;tone in his bladder; nor the fine gentleman who had &s;truck up this bargain with him, that limped through a whole a&s;&s;embly of ladies who u&s;ed to ad|mire him, with a pair &s;houlders peeping over his head.</P>
<P N="21">21. I mu&s;t not omit my own paticular adventure. My friend with the long vi&s;age had no &s;ooner taken upon him my &s;hort face, but he made &s;uch a grote&s;que figure in it, that, as I looked upon him, I could not forbear laughing at my &s;elf, in&s;omuch that I put my own face out of countenance. The poor gentleman was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the ridicule, that I found he was a&s;hamed of what he had done: on the other &s;ide I found that I my&s;elf had no great rea&s;on to triumph, for as I went to touch my forehead, I mi&s;&s;ed the place, and clapped my finger upon my upper lip.</P>
<P N="22">22. Be&s;ides, as my no&s;e was exceeding prominent, I gave it two or three unlucky knocks as I was play|ing my hand about my face, and aiming at &s;ome other part of it. I &s;aw two other gentlemen by me, who were in the &s;ame ridiculous circum&s;tances: the&s;e had made a fooli&s;h &s;wap between a couple of thick

bandy legs, and two long trap&s;ticks that had no calfs to them.</P>
<P N="23">23. One of the&s;e looked like a man walking upon &s;tilts, and was &s;o lifted up into the air above his or|dinary height, that his head turned round with it, while the other made &s;uch aukward circles, as he at|tempted to walk, that he &s;carce knew how to move forward upon his new &s;upporters: ob&s;erving him to be a plea&s;ant kind of fellow, I &s;tuck my cane in the ground, and told him I would lay him a bottle of wine, that he did not march up to it on a line that I drew for him, in a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P N="24">24. The heap was at la&s;t di&s;tributed among the two &s;exes, who made a mo&s;t pitious &s;ight, as they wan|dered up and down under the pre&s;&s;ure of their &s;everal burthens. The whole plain was filled with murmurs and complaints, groans and lamentations. <HI>Jupiter</HI> at length, taking compa&s;&s;ion on the poor mortals, or|dered them a &s;econd time to lay down their loads, with a de&s;ign to give every one his own again.</P>
<P N="25">25. They di&s;charged them&s;elves with a great deal of plea&s;ure, after which, the phantom, who had led them into &s;uch gro&s;s delu&s;ions, was commanded to di&s;|appear. There was &s;ent in her &s;tead a godde&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> quite different figure; her motions were &s;teady and compo&s;ed, and her a&s;pect &s;erious, but chearful.

<P N="26">26.

She afterwards returned every man his own proper calamity, and teaching him how to bear it in the mo&s;t commodious manner, he marched off with it contentedly, being very well plea&s;ed that he had not been left to his own choice, as to the kind of evils which fell to his lot.</P>

<HEAD>A Life of Virtue preferable to a Life of Plea|&s;ure, exemplified in the Choice of Hercules.</HEAD>
<BIBL>TATLER, No. 97.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. WHEN Hercules, &s;ays the divine Prodicus, was in that part of his youth, in which it was natural for him to con&s;ider what cour&s;e of life he ought to pur&s;ue, he one day retired into a de&s;ert, where the &s;ilence and &s;olitude of the place very much favoured his meditations.</P>
<P N="2">2. As he was mu&s;ing on his pre&s;ent condition, and very much perplexed in him&s;elf on the &s;tate of life he &s;hould chu&s;e, he &s;aw two women of a larger &s;tature than ordinary approaching towards him. One of them had a very noble air and graceful deportment; her beauty was natural and ea&s;y; her per&s;on clean and un&s;potted; her eyes ca&s;t towards the ground, with an agreeable re&s;erve; her motion and behaviour full of mode&s;ty; and her raiment as white as &s;now.</P>
<P N="3">3. The other had a great deal of health and flo|ridne&s;s in her countenance, which &s;he had helped with an artificial white and red, and endeavoured to appear more graceful than ordinary in her mein, by a mixture of affectation in all her ge&s;tures. She had a wonderful confidence and a&s;&s;urance in her looks, and all the variety of colours in her dre&s;s that &s;he
<PB N="152" REF="020531_0157_0FAFE2BE4956CAF8">
thought were the mo&s;t proper to &s;hew her complexion to an advantage. She ca&s;t her eyes upon her&s;elf, then turned them on tho&s;e that were pre&s;ent to &s;ee how they liked her, and often looked on the figure &s;he made in her own &s;hadow.</P>
<P N="4">4. Upon her nearer approach to Hercules, &s;he &s;tep|ped before the other lady, who came forward with a regular compo&s;ed carriage, and running up to him, acco&s;ted him after the following manner.</P>
<P N="5">5. My dear Hercules, &s;ays &s;he, I find you are very much divided in your own thoughts upon the way of life that you ought to chu&s;e: be my friend, and fol|low me; I will lead you into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of plea|&s;ure and out of the reach of pain, and remove you from all the noi&s;e and di&s;quietude of bu&s;ine&s;s. The affairs of either war or peace &s;hall have no power to di&s;turb you. Your whole employment &s;hall be to make your life ea&s;y, and to entertain every &s;en&s;e with its proper gratifications. Sumptuous tables, beds of ro&s;es, clouds of perfumes, concerts of mu&s;ic, crowds of beauties, are all in readine&s;s to receive you. Come along with me into this region of delights, this world of plea&s;ure, and bid farewell for ever to care, to pain, and to bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hercules, hearing the lady talk after this man|ner, de&s;ired to know her name; to which &s;he an&s;wer|ed, my friends, and tho&s;e who are well acquainted with me, call me Happine&s;s; but my enemies, and tho&s;e who would injure my reputation, have given me the name of Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="7">7. By this time the other lady was come up, who addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to the young hero in a very different manner.</P>
<P>Hercules, &s;ays &s;he, I offer my&s;elf to you, becau&s;e I know you are de&s;cended from the Gods, and give proofs of that de&s;cent by your love to virtue, and ap|plication to the &s;tudies proper to your age. This makes me hope you will gain both for your&s;elf and me an immortal reputation. But before I invite you
<PB N="153" REF="020531_0158_0FAFE2BF047E7B70">
into my &s;ociety and friend&s;hip, I will be open and &s;incere with you, and mu&s;t lay down this as an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed truth, that there is nothing truly valuable which can be purcha&s;ed without pains and labour.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Gods have &s;et a price upon every real and noble plea&s;ure. If you would gain the favour of the Deity, you mu&s;t be at the pains of wor&s;hipping him; if the friend&s;hip of good men, you mu&s;t &s;tudy to o|blige them; if you would be honoured by your coun|try, you mu&s;t take care to &s;erve it. In &s;hort, if you would be eminent in war or peace, you mu&s;t become ma&s;ter of all the qualifications that can make you &s;o. The&s;e are the only terms and conditions upon which I can propo&s;e happine&s;s. The godde&s;s of Plea&s;ure here broke in upon her di&s;cour&s;e:</P>
<P N="9">9. You &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, Hercules, by her own con|fe&s;&s;ion, the way to her plea&s;ure is long and difficult, whereas that which I propo&s;e is &s;hort and ea&s;y. Alas! &s;aid the other lady, who&s;e vi&s;age glowed with a pa&s;|&s;ion made up of &s;corn and pity, what are the plea&s;ures you propo&s;e? To eat before you are hungry, drink before you are thir&s;ty, &s;leep before you are tired, to gratify appetites before they are rai&s;ed, and rai&s;e &s;uch appetites as nature never planted.</P>
<P N="10">10. You never heard the mo&s;t delicious mu&s;ic, which is the prai&s;e of one's &s;elf; nor &s;aw the mo&s;t beautiful object, which is the work of one's own hands. Your votaries pa&s;s away their youth in a dream of mi&s;taken plea&s;ures, while they are hoarding up angui&s;h, torment, and remor&s;e, for old age.</P>
<P N="11">11. As for me, I am a friend of the gods and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> good men, an agreeable companion to the arti&s;an, a hou&s;hold guardian to the fathers of families, a patron and protector of &s;ervants, an a&s;&s;ociate in all true and generous friend&s;hips. The banquets of my votaries are never co&s;tly, but always delicious; for none eat or drink at them who are not invited by hunger and thir&s;t. Their &s;lumbers are &s;ound, and their waking<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> chearful.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="154" REF="020531_0159_0FAFE2C11EDB1028">12. My young men have the plea&s;ure of hearing them&s;elves prai&s;ed by tho&s;e who are in years, and tho&s;e who are in years, of being honoured by tho&s;e who are young. In a word, my followers are favour|ed by the gods, beloved by their acquaintance, e&s;teemed by their country, and, after the clo&s;e of their labours, honoured by po&s;terity.</P>
<P N="13">13. We know by the life of this memorable hero, to which of the&s;e two ladies he gave up his heart; and I believe, every one who reads this, will do him the ju&s;tice to approve his choice.</P>
<P N="14">14. I very much admire the &s;peeches of the&s;e la|dies, as containing in them the chief arguments for a life of virtue, or a life of plea&s;ure, that could en|ter into the thoughts of an heathen: but am parti|cularly plea&s;ed with the different figures he gives the two godde&s;&s;es. Our modern authors have repre&s;ent|ed plea&s;ure or vice with an alluring face, but ending in &s;nakes and mon&s;ters: here &s;he appears in all the charms of beauty, though they are all fal&s;e and bor|rowed; and by that means compo&s;es a vi&s;ion entirely natural and plea&s;ing.</P>
<P N="15">15. I have tran&s;lated this allegory for the benefit of the youth in general; and particularly of tho&s;e who are &s;till in the deplorable &s;tate of non-ex|i&s;tence, and whom I mo&s;t earne&s;tly intreat to come into the world.

<BIBL>SPECTATOR, No. 375.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. I HAVE more than once had occa&s;ion to mention a noble &s;aying of Seneca the philo&s;opher, that a virtuous per&s;on &s;truggling with misfortunes, and ri&s;ing above them, is an object on which the gods them&s;elves may look down with delight. I &s;hall therefore &s;et before my reader a &s;cene of this kind of di&s;tre&s;s in private life, for the &s;peculation of this day.</P>
<P N="2">2. An eminent citizen, who had lived in good fa|&s;hion and credit, was by a train of accidents, and by an unavoidable perplexity in his affairs, reduced to a low condition. There is a mode&s;ty u&s;ually attending faultle&s;s poverty, which made him rather chu&s;e to reduce his manner of living to his pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, than &s;olicit his friends, in order to &s;upport the &s;hew of an e&s;tate, when the &s;ub&s;tance was gone.</P>
<P N="3">3. His wife, who was a woman of &s;en&s;e and virtue, behaved her&s;elf on this occa&s;ion with uncommon de|cency, and never appeared &s;o amiable in his eyes as now. In&s;tead of upbraiding him with the ample for|tune &s;he had brought, or the many great offers &s;he had refu&s;ed for his &s;ake, &s;he redoubled all the in&s;tan|ces of her affection, while her hu&s;band was continu|ally pouring out his heart to her in complaints, that he had ruined the be&s;t woman in the world,</P>
<P N="4">4. He &s;ometimes came home at a time when &s;he did not expect him, and &s;urpri&s;ed her in tears; which &s;he indeavoured to conceal, and always put on an air of chearfulne&s;s to receive him. To le&s;&s;en their ex|pence, their elde&s;t daughter (whom I &s;hall call Aman|da) was &s;ent into the country, to the hou&s;e of an ho|ne&s;t farmer, who had married a &s;ervant of the family: This young woman was apprehen&s;ive of the ruin which was approaching, and had privately engaged a friend in the neighbourhood to give her an account of what pa&s;&s;ed from time to time in her father's affairs.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="156" REF="020531_0161_0FAFE2C20B69DC18">5. Amanda was in the bloom of her youth and beauty, when the lord of the manor, who often called in at the farmer's hou&s;e as he followed his country &s;ports, fell pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her.

<P N="6">6. One day as he called to &s;ee her, he found her in tears over a letter &s;he had ju&s;t received from her friend, which gave an account that her father had been lately &s;tript of every thing by an execution. The lover, who with &s;ome difficulty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound out the cau&s;e of her grief, took this occa&s;ion to make her a propo&s;al.

<P>YOUR father and I have ju&s;t now received a letter from a gentleman who pretends love to you, with a propo&s;al that in&s;ults our misfortunes, and would throw us to a lower degree of mi&s;ery than any thing which is come upon us. How could this bar|barous man think that the tendere&s;t of parents would be tempted to &s;upply their wants, by giving up the be&s;t of children to infamy and ruin? It is a mean and cruel artifice to make this propo&s;al at a time when he thinks our nece&s;&s;ities mu&s;t compel us to any thing; but we will not eat the bread of &s;hame; and there|fore we charge thee not to think of us, but to avoid the &s;nare which is laid for thy virtue. Beware of pitying us: it is not &s;o bad as you have perhaps been told. All things will yet be well, and I &s;hall write my child better news.</P>
<P>I have been interrupted. I know not how I was moved to &s;ay things would mend. As I was going on, I was &s;tartled by the noi&s;e of one that knocked at the door, and had brought us an unexpected &s;upply of a debt which had long been owing. Oh! I will now tell thee all. It is &s;ome days I have lived al|mo&s;t without &s;upport, having conveyed what little money I could rai&s;e to your poor father. Thou wilt weep to think where he is, yet be a&s;&s;ured he will &s;oon be at liberty. That cruel letter would have broke his heart, but I have concealed it from him. I have no companion at pre&s;ent be&s;ides little Fanny, who &s;tands watching my looks as I write, and is crying for her &s;i&s;ter; &s;he &s;ays &s;he is &s;ure you are not well, having di&s;covered that my pre&s;ent trouble is about

you. But do not think I would thus repeat my &s;or|rows to grieve thee. No, it is to intreat thee not to make them in&s;upportable, by adding what would be wor&s;e than all. Let us bear chearfully an afflic|tion, which we have not brought on our&s;elves, and remember there is a power who can better deliver us out of it, than by the lo&s;s of thy innocence.&mdash;Hea|ven pre&s;erve my dear child.</P>

<P N="11">11. The me&s;&s;enger, notwith&s;tanding he promi&s;ed to deliver this letter to Amanda, carried it fir&s;t to his ma&s;ter, who he imagined would be glad to have an opportunity of giving it into her hands him&s;elf. His ma&s;ter was impatient to know the &s;ucce&s;s of his propo&s;al, and therefore broke open the letter pri|vately, to &s;ee the contents.</P>
<P N="12">12. He was not a little moved at &s;o true a picture of virtue in di&s;tre&s;s: but at the &s;ame time was infi|nitely &s;urprized to find his offers rejected. However, he re&s;olved not to &s;uppre&s;s the letter, but carefully &s;ealed it up again, and carried it to Amanda. All his endeavours to &s;ee her were in vain, till &s;he was a&s;&s;ured he brought a letter from her mother. He would not part with it but upon condition that &s;he &s;hould read it without leaving the room.</P>
<P N="13">13. While &s;he was peru&s;ing it, he fixed his eyes on her face with the deepe&s;t attention; her concern gave a new &s;oftne&s;s to her beauty, and when &s;he bur&s;t into tears, he could no longer refrain from bearing a part in her &s;orrow, and telling her, that he too had read the letter, and was re&s;olved to make repa|ration for having been the occa&s;ion of it. My read|er will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the &s;econd epi&s;tle which he now wrote to Amanda's mother.</P>

<P N="14">14. This letter he &s;ent by his &s;teward, and &s;oon after went up to town him&s;elf to complete the gene|rous act he had now re&s;olved on. By his friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, Amanda's father was quickly in a condition of retrieving his perplexed affairs.

<HEAD>The Story of Abdallah and Bal&s;ora.</HEAD>
<BIBL>GUARDIAN, No. 167.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. THE following &s;tory is lately tran&s;lated out of an Arabian manu&s;cript, which I think has very much the turn of an oriental tale; and as it has never before been printed, I que&s;tion not but it will be highly acceptable to my reader.</P>
<P N="2">2. The name of Helim is &s;till famous through all the ea&s;tern parts of the world. He is called among the Per&s;ians, even to this day, Helim, the great phy&s;ician. He was acquainted with all the powers of &s;imples, under&s;tood all the influences of the &s;tars, and knew the &s;ecrets that were engraved on the &s;eal of Solomon the &s;on of David. Helim was al&s;o go|vernor of the Black Palace, and chief of the phy&s;ici|ans to Alnare&s;chin the great king of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P N="3">3. Alnare&s;chin was the mo&s;t dreadful tyrant that ever reigned in this country. He was of a fearful,
<PB N="160" REF="020531_0165_0FAFE2C506825608">
&s;u&s;picious, and cruel nature, having put to death upon very &s;light jealou&s;ies and &s;urmi&s;es five and thir|ty of his queens, and above twenty &s;ons whom he &s;u&s;pected to have con&s;pired again&s;t his life. Being at length wearied with the exerci&s;e of &s;o many cruel|ties in his own family, and fearing le&s;t the whole race of Caliphs &s;hould be entirely lo&s;t, he one day &s;ent for Helim, and &s;poke to him after this manner.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'Helim,' &s;aid he, 'I have long admired thy great wi&s;dom, and retired way of living. I &s;hall now &s;hew thee the entire confidence which I place in thee. I have only two &s;ons remaining, who are as yet but infants. It is my de&s;ign that thou take them home with thee, and educate them as thy own. Train them up in the humble unambitious pur&s;uits of knowledge. By this means &s;hall the line of Caliphs be pre&s;erved, and my children &s;ucceed after me, with|out a&s;piring to my throne whil&s;t I am yet alive.'</P>
<P N="5">5. The words of my lord the king &s;hall be obeyed, &s;aid Helim. After which he bowed, and went out of the king's pre&s;ence. He then received the chil|dren into his own hou&s;e, and from that time bred them up with him in the &s;tudies of knowledge and virtue. The young princes loved and re&s;pected Helim as their father, and made &s;uch improvements under him, that by the age of one and twenty they were in&s;tructed in all the learning of the ea&s;t.</P>
<P N="6">6. The name of the elde&s;t was Ibrahim, and of the younge&s;t Abdallah. They lived together in &s;uch a perfect friend&s;hip, that to this day it is &s;aid of in|timate friends that they live together like Ibrahim and Abdallah. Helim had an only child, who was a girl of a fine &s;oul, and a mo&s;t beautiful per&s;on. Her father omitted nothing in her education, that might make her the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed woman of her age.</P>
<P N="7">7. As the young princes were in a manner exclu|ded from the re&s;t of the world, they frequently con|ver&s;ed with this lovely virgin, who had been brought
<PB N="161" REF="020531_0166_0FAFE2C5BAC132E0">
up by her father in the &s;ame cour&s;e of knowledge and of virtue.</P>
<P N="8">8. Abdallah, who&s;e mind was of a &s;ofter turn than that of his brother, grew by degrees &s;o enamoured of her conver&s;ation, that he did not think he lived, when he was not in company with his beloved Bal&s;ora, for that was the name of the maid. The fame of her beauty was &s;o great, that at length it came to the ears of the king, who, pretending to vi&s;it the young princes his &s;ons, demanded of Helim the &s;ight of Bal&s;ora his fair daughter.</P>
<P N="9">9. The king was &s;o inflamed with her beauty and behaviour, that he &s;ent for Helim the next morning, and told him it was now his de&s;ign to recompen&s;e him for all his faithful &s;ervices; and that in order to it, he intended to make his daughter queen of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P N="10">10. Helim, who knew very well the fate of all tho&s;e unhappy women who had been thus advanced, and could not but be privy to the &s;ecret love which Abdallah bore his daughter, 'Far be it,' &s;ays he, 'from the king of Per&s;ia to contaminate the blood of the Caliphs, and join him&s;elf in marriage with the daughter of his phy&s;ician.'</P>
<P N="11">11. The king, however, was &s;o impatient for &s;uch a bride, that without hearing any excu&s;es, he imme|diately ordered Bal&s;ora to be &s;ent for into his pre|&s;ence, keeping the father with him in order to make her &s;en&s;ible of the honour which he de&s;igned. Bal&s;ora, who was too mode&s;t and humble to think her beauty had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on the king, was a few moments after brought into his pre&s;ence as he had commanded.</P>
<P N="12">12. She appeared in the king's eye as one of the virgins of Paradi&s;e. But upon hearing the honour which he intended her, &s;he fainted away, and fell down as dead at his feet. Helim wept, and after having recovered her out of the trance into which &s;he was fallen, repre&s;ented to the king, that &s;o unex|pected an honour was too great to have been commu|nicated
<PB N="162" REF="020531_0167_0FAFE2C68638DD70">
to her all at once; but that, if he plea&s;ed, he would him&s;elf prepare her for it. The king bid him take his own way, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P N="13">13. Bal&s;ora was conveyed again to her father's hou&s;e, where the thoughts of Abdallah renewed her affliction every moment; in&s;omuch that at length &s;he fell into a raging fever. The king was informed of her condition by tho&s;e that &s;aw her. Helim finding no other means of extricating her from the difficul|ties &s;he was in, after having compo&s;ed her mind, and made her acquainted with his intentions, gave her a certain potion, which he knew would lay her a&s;leep for many hours; and afterward, in all the &s;eeming di&s;tre&s;s of a di&s;con&s;olate father, informed the king &s;he was dead.</P>
<P N="14">14. The king, who never let any &s;entiments of humanity come too near his heart, did not much trouble him&s;elf about the matter; however, for his own reputation, he told the father, that &s;ince it was known through the empire that Bal&s;ora died at a time when he de&s;igned her for his bride, it was his inten|tion that &s;he &s;hould be honoured as &s;uch after her death, that her body &s;hould be laid in the black pa|lace, among tho&s;e of his decea&s;ed queens.</P>
<P N="15">15. In the mean time Abdallah, who had heard of the king's de&s;ign, was not le&s;s afflicted than his be|loved Bal&s;ora. As for the &s;everal circum&s;tances of his di&s;tre&s;s, as al&s;o how the king was informed of an irrecoverable di&s;temper into which he was fallen, they are to be found at length in the Hi&s;tory of Helim.</P>
<P N="16">16. It &s;hall &s;uffice to acquaint the reader, that He|lim, &s;ome days after the &s;uppo&s;ed death of his daugh|ter, gave the prince a potion of the &s;ame nature with which he had laid a&s;leep Bel&s;ora.</P>
<P N="17">17. It is the cu&s;tom among the Per&s;ians, to convey in a private manner the bodies of all the royal fami|ly a little after their death, into the black palace; which is the repo&s;itory of all who are de&s;cended from the Caliphs, or any way allied to them. The chief
<PB N="163" REF="020531_0168_0FAFE2C7403D2458">
phy&s;ician is always governor of the black palace; it being his office to embalm and pre&s;erve the holy fa|mily after they are dead, as well as to take care of them while they are yet living.</P>
<P N="18">18. The black palace is &s;o called from the colour of the building, which is all of the fine&s;t poli&s;hed black marble. There are always burning in it five thou&s;and everla&s;ting lamps. It has al&s;o a hundred folding doors of ebony, which are each of them watched day and night by a hundred negroes, who are to take care that nobody enters be&s;ides the go|vernor.</P>
<P N="19">19. Helim, after having conveyed the body of his daughter into this repo&s;itory, and at the appointed time received her out of the &s;leep into which &s;he was fallen, took care &s;ome time after to bring that of Ab|dallah into the &s;ame place. Bal&s;ora watched over him till &s;uch time as the doze he had taken lo&s;t its effect. Abdallah was not acquainted with Helim's de&s;ign when he gave him this &s;leepy potion.</P>
<P N="20">20. It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the &s;urpri&s;e, the joy, the tran&s;port he was in at his fir&s;t awaking. He fan|cied him&s;elf in the retirement of the ble&s;t, and that the &s;pirit of his dear Bal&s;ora, who he thought was ju&s;t gone before him, was the fir&s;t who came to con|gratulate his arrival. She &s;oon informed him of the place he was in, which, notwith&s;tanding all its hor|rors, appeared to him more &s;weet than the bower of Mahomet, in the company of his Bal&s;ora.</P>
<P N="21">21 Helim, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to be taken up in the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">balming of the bodies, vi&s;ited the place very frequently. His greate&s;t perplexity was how to get the lovers out of it, the gates being watched in &s;uch a manner as I have before related. This con&s;idera|tion did not a little di&s;turb the two interred lovers.</P>
<P N="22">22. At length Helim bethought him&s;elf, that the fir&s;t day of the full moon of the month Tizpa was near at hand. Now it is a received tradition among the Per&s;ians, that the &s;ouls of tho&s;e of the Royal family,
<PB N="164" REF="020531_0169_0FAFE2C803072D50">
who are in a &s;tate of bli&s;s, do, on the fir&s;t full moon after their decea&s;e, pa&s;s through the ea&s;tern gate of the black palace, which is therefore called the gate of Paradi&s;e, in order to take their flight for that happy place.</P>
<P N="23">23. Helim, therefore, having made due prepara|tion for this night, dre&s;&s;ed each of the lovers in a robe of azure &s;ilk, wrought in the fine&s;t looms of Per&s;ia, with a long train of linen whiter than &s;now, that floated on the ground behind them. Upon Ab|dallah's head he fixed a wreath of the greene&s;t myr|tle, and on Bal&s;ora's a garland of the fre&s;he&s;t ro&s;es. Their garments were &s;cented with the riche&s;t per|fumes of Arabia.</P>
<P N="24">24. Having thus prepared every thing, the full moon was no &s;ooner up, and &s;hining in all its bright|ne&s;s, but he privately opened the gate of Paradi&s;e, and &s;hut it after the &s;ame manner, as &s;oon as they had pa&s;&s;ed through it.</P>
<P N="25">25. The band of negroes who were po&s;ted at a lit|tle di&s;tance from the gate, &s;eeing two &s;uch beautiful apparitions, that &s;hewed them&s;elves to advantage by the light of the full moon, and being ravi&s;hed with the odour that flowed from their garments, immedi|ately concluded them to be the gho&s;ts of the two per|&s;ons lately decea&s;ed.</P>
<P N="26">26. They fell upon their faces as they pa&s;&s;ed through the mid&s;t of them, and continued pro&s;trate on the earth until &s;uch time as they were out of &s;ight. They reported the next day what they had &s;een&punc; but this was looked upon by the king him&s;elf, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mo&s;t others, as the compliment that was u&s;ually paid to any of the decea&s;ed of his family.</P>
<P N="27">27. Helim had placed two of his own mules at a|bout a mile's di&s;tance from the black temple, on the &s;pot which they had agreed upon for their rendezvous. Here he met them, and conducted them to one of his own hou&s;es, which was &s;ituated on mount Khacan.</P>
<P N="28"><PB N="165" REF="020531_0170_0FAFE2C8C1621870">28. The air of this mountain was &s;o very health|ful, that Helim had formerly tran&s;ported the king thither, in order to recover him out of a long fit of &s;ickne&s;s, which &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that the king made him a pre&s;ent of the whole mountain, with a beauti|ful hou&s;e and garden that were on the top of it.</P>
<P N="29">29. In this retirement lived Abdallah and Bal&s;ora. They were both &s;o fraught with all kinds of know|ledge, and po&s;&s;e&s;t with &s;o con&s;tant and mutual a pa&s;|&s;ion for each other, that their &s;olitude never lay hea|vy on them.</P>
<P N="30">30. Abdallah applied him&s;elf to tho&s;e arts which were agreeable to his manner of living, and the &s;i|tuation of the place; in&s;omuch that in a few years he converted the whole mountain into a kind of gar|den, and covered every part of it with plantations or &s;pots of flowers. Helim was too good a father to let him want any thing that might conduce to make his retirement plea&s;ant.</P>
<P N="31">31. In about ten years after their abode in this place, the old king died, and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Ibrahim, who, upon the &s;uppo&s;ed death of his brother, had been called to court, and entertained there as heir to the Per&s;ian empire. Though he was &s;ome years incon&s;olable for the death of his brother, Helim dur&s;t not tru&s;t him with the &s;ecret, which he knew would have fatal con&s;equences, &s;hould it by any means come to the knowledge of the old king.</P>
<P N="32">32. Ibrahim was no &s;ooner mounted to the throne, but Helim &s;ought after a proper opportunity of mak|ing a di&s;covery to him, which he knew would be very agreeable to &s;o good natured and generous a prince. It &s;o happened, that before Helim found &s;uch an op|portunity as he de&s;ired, the new king Ibrahim, hav|ing been &s;eparated from his company in a chace, and almo&s;t fainting with heat and thir&s;t, &s;aw him&s;elf at the foot of mount Khacan. He immediately a&s;cend|ed the hill, and coming to Helim's hou&s;e, demanded &s;ome refre&s;hments.</P>
<P N="33"><PB N="166" REF="020531_0171_0FAFE2C9850E8288">33. Helim was very luckily there at that time; and after having &s;et before the king the choice&s;t of wines and fruits, finding him wonderfully plea&s;ed with &s;o &s;ea&s;onable a treat, told him that the be&s;t part of his entertainment was to come. Upon which he opened to him the whole hi&s;tory of what had pa&s;&s;ed. The king was at once a&s;toni&s;hed and tran&s;ported at &s;o &s;trange a relation, and &s;eeing his brother enter the room with Bal&s;ora in his hand, he leaped off from the &s;ofa on which he &s;at, and cried out, 'It is he! it is my Abdallah!' Having &s;aid this, he fell upon his neck, and wept.</P>
<P N="34">34. The whole company, for &s;ome time, remained &s;ilent, and &s;hedding tears of joy. The king at length having kindly reproached Helim for depriving him &s;o long of &s;uch a brother, embraced Bal&s;ora with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, and told her that &s;he &s;hould now be a queen indeed, for that he would immediately make his brother king of all the conquered nations on the other &s;ide the Tigris.</P>
<P N="35">35. He ea&s;ily di&s;covered in the eyes of our two lo|vers, that in&s;tead of being tran&s;ported with the offer, they preferred their pre&s;ent retirement to empire. At their reque&s;t, therefore, he changed his intenti|ons, and made them a pre&s;ent of all the open coun|try as far as they could &s;ee from the top of mount Khacan.</P>
<P N="36">36. Abdallah continuing to extend his former im|provements, beautified this whole pro&s;pect with groves and fountains, gardens and &s;eats of plea&s;ure, until it became the mo&s;t delicious &s;pot of ground with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the empire, and is therefore called the Garden of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P N="37">37. This Caliph, Ibrahim, after a long and happy reign, died without children, and was &s;ucceeded by Abdallah, a &s;on of Abdallah and Bal&s;ora. This was that king Abdallah, who afterwards fixed the Impe|rial re&s;idence upon mou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Khacan, which continues at this time to be the favourite palace of the Per&s;ian empire.</P>

<HEAD>On Ra&s;hne&s;s and Cowardice.</HEAD>
<BIBL>RAMBLER, No. 25.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. THERE are &s;ome vices and errors which, though often fatal to tho&s;e in whom they are found, have yet, by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of man|kind, been con&s;idered as entitled to &s;ome degree of re&s;pect, or have, at lea&s;t, been exempted from con|temptuous infamy, and condemned by the &s;evere&s;t morali&s;ts with pity rather than dete&s;tation.</P>
<P N="2">2. A con&s;tant and invariable example of this ge|neral partiality will be found in the different regard which has always been &s;hewn to ra&s;hne&s;s and cowar|dice; two vices, of which, though they may be con|ceived equally di&s;tant from the middle point, where true fortitude is placed, and may equally injure any public or private intere&s;t, yet the one is never men|tioned without &s;ome kind of veneration, and the other always con&s;idered as a topic of unlimited and licen|tious cen&s;ure, on which all the virulence of reproach may be lawfully exerted.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;ame di&s;tinction is made, by the common &s;uffrage, between profu&s;ion and avarice, and perhaps between many other oppo&s;ite vices; and, as I have found rea&s;on to pay great regard to the voice of the people, in ca&s;es where knowledge has been forced upon them by experience, without long deductions or deep re&s;earches, I am inclined to believe that this di&s;tribution of re&s;pect is not without &s;ome agreement with the nature of things; and that in the faults, which are thus inve&s;ted with extraordinary privile|ges, there are generally &s;ome latent principles of merit, &s;ome po&s;&s;ibilities of future virtue, which may, by degrees, break from ob&s;truction, and by time and opportunity be brought into act.</P>
<P N="4">4. It may be laid down as an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iom, that it is more ea&s;y to take away &s;uperfluities than to &s;upply defects; and therefore, he that is culpable, becau&s;e he has pa&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="168" REF="020531_0173_0FAFE2CC4E79B810">
the middle point of virtue, is always accounted a fairer object of hope, than he who fails by falling &s;hort. The one has all that perfection requires, and more, but the exce&s;s may be ea&s;ily retrenched; the other wants the qualities requi&s;ite to excellence, and who can tell how he &s;hall obtain them?</P>
<P N="5">5. We are certain that the hor&s;e may be taught to keep pace with his fellows, who&s;e fault is that he leaves them behind. We know that a few &s;trokes of the axe will lop a cedar; but what arts of cultivation can elevate a &s;hrub?</P>
<P N="6">6. To walk with circum&s;pection and &s;teadine&s;s in the right path, at an equal di&s;tance between the ex|tremes of error, ought to be the con&s;tant endeavour of every rea&s;onable being; nor can I think tho&s;e teachers of moral wi&s;dom much to be honoured as benefactors to mankind, who are always enlarging upon the difficulty of our duties, and providing ra|ther excu&s;es for vice, than incentives to virtue.</P>
<P N="7">7. But, &s;ince to mo&s;t it will happen often, and to all &s;ometimes, that there will be a deviation towards one &s;ide or the other, we ought always to employ our vigilance, with mo&s;t attention, on that enemy, from which there is the greate&s;t danger, and to &s;tray, if we mu&s;t &s;tray, towards tho&s;e parts from whence we may quickly and ea&s;ily return.</P>
<P N="8">8. Among other oppo&s;ite qualities of the mind, which may become dangerous, though in different degrees, I have often had occa&s;ion to con&s;ider the contrary effects of pre&s;umption and de&s;pondency; of heady confidence, which promi&s;es a victory without conte&s;t, and heartle&s;s pu&s;illanimity, which &s;hrinks back from the thought of great undertakings, con|founds difficulty with impo&s;&s;ibility, and con&s;iders all advancement towards any new attainment as irrever|&s;ibly prohibited.</P>
<P N="9">9. Pre&s;umption will be ea&s;ily corrected. Every experiment will teach caution, and mi&s;carriages will hourly &s;hew, that attempts are not always rewarded
<PB N="169" REF="020531_0174_0FAFE2CCEFB5E5D0">
with &s;ucce&s;s. The mo&s;t precipitate ardour will, in time, be taught the nece&s;&s;ity of methodical grada|tion, and preparatory mea&s;ures; and the mo&s;t dar|ing confidence be convinced that neither merit, nor abilities can command events.</P>
<P N="10">10. It is the advantage of vehemence and activity, that they are always ha&s;tening to their own reforma|tion; becau&s;e they incite us to try whether our ex|pectations are well grounded; and therefore detect the deceits which they are apt to occa&s;ion. But timi|dity is a di&s;ea&s;e of the mind more ob&s;tinate and fatal; for a man once per&s;uaded, that any impediment is in|&s;uperable, has given it, with re&s;pect to him&s;elf, that &s;trength and weight which it had not before.</P>
<P N="11">11. He can &s;carcely &s;trive with vigour and per&s;eve|rance, when he has no hope of gaining the victory; and &s;ince he will never try his &s;trength, can never di&s;cover the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of his fears.</P>
<P N="12">12. There is often to be found in men devoted to literature, a kind of intellectual cowardice, which whoever conver&s;es much among them, may ob&s;erve frequently to depre&s;s the alacrity of enterprize, and, by con&s;equence, to retard the improvement of &s;cience.</P>
<P N="13">13. They have annexed to every &s;pecies of know|ledge, &s;ome chimerical character of terror and inhi|bition, which they tran&s;mit, without much reflection, from one to another; they fir&s;t fright them&s;elves, and then propagate the panic to their &s;cholars and ac|quaintance.</P>
<P N="14">14. One &s;tudy is incon&s;i&s;tent with a lively imagin|ation, another with a &s;olid judgment; one is impro|per in the early parts of life, another requires &s;o much time, that it is not to be attempted at an advanced age; one is dry and contracts the &s;entiments, another is diffu&s;e and over-burdens the memory; one is in&s;uf|ferable to ta&s;te and delicacy, and another wears out life in the &s;tudy of words, and is u&s;ele&s;s to a wi&s;e man, who de&s;ires only the knowledge of things.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="170" REF="020531_0175_0FAFE2CD43772948">15. But of all the bugbears by which the <HI>infant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s barbati,</HI> boys both young and old, have been hither|to frighted from degre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing into new tracts of lear|ning, none has been more mi&s;chievou&s;ly efficacious than an opinion that every kind of knowledge re|quires a peculiar genius, or mental con&s;titution, fra|med for the reception of &s;ome ideas and the exclu&s;ion of others; and that to him who&s;e genius is not adap|ted to the &s;tudy which he pro&s;ecutes, all labour &s;hall be vain and fruitle&s;s, vain as an endeavour to mingle oil and water, or, in the language of chime&s;try, to amalgamate bodies of heterogeneous principles.</P>
<P N="16">16. This opinion we may rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pect to have been propagated, by vanity, beyond the truth. It is natural for tho&s;e who have rai&s;ed a reputation by any &s;cience, to exalt them&s;elves as endowed by heaven with peculiar powers, or marked out by an extraor|dinary de&s;ignation for their profe&s;&s;ion: and to fright competitors away by repre&s;enting the difficulties with which they mu&s;t contend, and the nece&s;&s;ity of quali|ties which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be not generally conferred, and which no man can know, but by experience, whether he enjoys.</P>
<P N="17">17. To this di&s;couragement it may be po&s;&s;ibly an|&s;wered, that &s;ince a genius, whatever it be, is like fire in the flint, only to be produced by colli&s;ion with a proper &s;ubject, it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of every man to try whether his faculties may not happily co-ope|rate with his de&s;ires; and &s;ince they who&s;e proficiency he admires, knew their own force only by the event, he needs but engage in the &s;ame undertaking, with e|qual &s;pirit, and may rea&s;onably hope for equal &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P N="18">18. There is another &s;pecies of fal&s;e intelligence, given by tho&s;e who profe&s;s to &s;hew the way to the &s;ummit of knowledge, of equal tendency to depre&s;s the mind with fal&s;e di&s;tru&s;t of it&s;elf, and weaken it by needle&s;s &s;olicitude and dejection. When a &s;cholar whom they de&s;ire to animate, con&s;ults them at his en|trance on &s;ome new &s;tudy. It is common to make flat|tering repre&s;entations of its plea&s;antne&s;s and facility.</P>
<P N="19"><PB N="171" REF="020531_0176_0FAFE2CE007D6D60">19. Thus they generally attain one of the two ends almo&s;t equally de&s;irable; they either incite his indu&s;try by elevating his hopes, or produce a high opinion of their own abilities, &s;ince they are &s;uppo&s;ed to relate only what they have found, and to have proceeded with no le&s;s ea&s;e than they have promi&s;ed to their followers.</P>
<P N="20">20. The &s;tudent, inflamed by this encouragement, &s;ets forward in the new path, and proceeds a few &s;teps with great alacrity; but he &s;oon finds a&s;perities and intricacies of which he has not been forewarned, and imagining that none ever were &s;o entangled or fatigued before him, &s;inks &s;uddenly into de&s;pair, and de&s;i&s;ts as from an expedition in which fate oppo&s;es him. Thus his terrors are multiplied by his hopes, and he is defeated without re&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e he had no expectation of an enemy.</P>
<P N="21">21. Of the&s;e treacherous in&s;tructors, the one de|&s;troys indu&s;try, by declaring that indu&s;try is vain, the other by repre&s;enting it as needle&s;s; the one cuts away the root of hope, the other rai&s;es it only to be bla&s;ted. The one confines his pupil to the &s;hore, by telling him that his wreck is certain; the other &s;ends him to &s;ea, without preparing him for tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P N="22">22. Fal&s;e hopes and fal&s;e terrors are equally to be avoided. Every man who propo&s;es to grow eminent by learning, &s;hould carry in his mind, at once, the difficulty of excellence, and the force of indu&s;try; and remember that fame is not conferred but as the recompence of labour, and that labour, vigorou&s;ly continued, has not often failed of its reward.</P>

<HEAD>Fortitude founded upon the Fear of God.</HEAD>
<BIBL>GUARDIAN, No. 177.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. LOOKING over the late edition of Mon&s;ieur Boileau's works, I was very much plea&s;ed with the article which he has added to his notes on
<PB N="172" REF="020531_0177_0FAFE2CEC441B8C0">
the tran&s;lation of Longinus. He there tells us, that the &s;ublime in writing ri&s;es either from the noblene&s;s of the thought, the magnificence of the words, or the harmonious and lively turn of the phra&s;e, and that the perfect &s;ublime ri&s;es from all the&s;e three in conjunction together. He produces an in&s;tance of this perfect &s;ublime in four ver&s;es from the Athalia of Mon&s;ieur Racine.</P>
<P N="2">2. When Abner, one of the chief officers of the court, repre&s;ents to Joad the high-prie&s;t, that the queen was incen&s;ed again&s;t him, the high-prie&s;t, not in the lea&s;t terrified at the news, returns this an&s;wer:
<Q><L>Celui qui met un frein &agrave; la fureur des flo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</L>
<L>S&ccedil;ait au&s;&s;i des m&eacute;chans arr&ecirc;ter les complots:</L>
<L>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umis avec re&s;pect &agrave; &s;a volont&eacute; &s;ainte,</L>
<L>Je crains Dieu, cher Abner, &amp; n'ai point d'autre crainte.</L></Q></P>
<P N="3">3. 'He who ruleth the raging of the &s;ea, knows al&s;o how to check the de&s;igns of the ungodly. I &s;ub|mit my&s;elf with reverence to his holy will. O Abner! I fear my God, and I fear none but him.' Such a thought gives no le&s;s a &s;olemnity to human nature, than it does to good writing.</P>
<P N="4">4. This religious fear, when it is produced by ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of a divine power, naturally overlooks all human greatne&s;s that &s;tands in competition with it, and extingui&s;hes every other terror that can &s;ettle it&s;elf in the heart of a man; it le&s;&s;ens and contracts the figure of the mo&s;t exalted per&s;on: it di&s;arms the tyrant and executioner, and repre&s;ents to our minds the mo&s;t enraged and the mo&s;t powerful as altogether harmle&s;s and impotent.</P>
<P N="5">5. There is no true fortitude which is not founded upon this fear, as there is no other principle of &s;o &s;ettled and fixed a nature. Courage that grows from con&s;titution very often for&s;akes a man when he has occa&s;ion for it; and when it is only a kind of in&s;tinct

in the &s;oul, breaks out on all occa&s;ions without judg|ment or di&s;cretion. That courage which proceeds from the &s;en&s;e of our duty, and from the fear of of|fending him that made us, acts always in an uniform manner, and according to the dictates of right rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="6">6. What can the man fear, who takes care in all his actions to plea&s;e a Being that is omnipotent? A Being who is able to cru&s;h all his adver&s;aries? A Being that can divert any misfortune from befalling him, or turn any &s;uch misfortune to his advantage? The per&s;on who lives with this con&s;tant and habitual regard to the great &s;uperintendant of the world, is indeed &s;ure that no real evil can come into his lot.</P>
<P N="7">7. Ble&s;&s;ings may appear under the &s;hape of pains, lo&s;&s;es, and di&s;appointments, but let him have pa|tience, and he will &s;ee them in their proper figures. Dangers may threaten him, but he may re&s;t &s;atisfied that they will either not reach him, or that, if they do, they will be the in&s;truments of good to him. In &s;hort, he may look upon all cro&s;&s;es and accidents, &s;ufferings and afflictions, as means which are made u&s;e of to bring him to happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="8">8. This is even the wor&s;t of that man's condition who&s;e mind is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the habitual fear of which I am now &s;peaking. But it very often hap|pens, that tho&s;e which appear evils in our own eyes, appear al&s;o as &s;uch to him who has human nature un|der his care, in which ca&s;e they are certainly averted from the per&s;on who has made him&s;elf, by this virtue, an object of divine favour.</P>
<P N="9">9. Hi&s;tories are full of in&s;tances of this nature, where men of virtue have had extraordinary e&s;capes out of &s;uch dangers as have enclo&s;ed them, and which have &s;eemed inevitable.</P>
<P N="10">10. There is no example of this kind in pagan hi&s;tory which more plea&s;es me than that which is re|corded in the life of Timoleon. This extraordinary man was famous for referring all his &s;ucce&s;&s;es to Pro|vidence. Cornelius Nepos acquaints us that he had
<PB N="174" REF="020531_0179_0FAFE2D04211E070">
in his hou&s;e a private chapel in which he u&s;ed to pay his devotions to the godde&s;s who repre&s;ented Provi|dence among the heathens. I think no man was ever more di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Deity, whom he blindly wor&s;hipped, than the great per&s;on I am &s;peaking of, in &s;everal occurrences of his life, but particularly in the following one, which I &s;hall relate out of Plutarch.</P>
<P N="11">11. Three per&s;ons had entered into a con&s;piracy to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Timoleon as he was offering up his de|votions in a certain temple. In order to it they took their &s;everal &s;tands in the mo&s;t convenient places for their purpo&s;e. As they were waiting for an oppor|tunity to put their de&s;ign in execution, a &s;tranger having ob&s;erved one of the con&s;pirators, fell upon him and &s;lew him. Upon which the other two, thinking their plot had been di&s;covered, threw them&s;elves at Timoleon's feet, and confe&s;&s;ed the whole matter.</P>
<P N="12">12. This &s;tranger, upon examination, was found to have under&s;tood nothing of the intended a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, but having &s;everal years before had a brother killed by the con&s;pirator, whom he here put to death, and having till now &s;ought in vain for an opportunity of revenge, he chanced to meet the murderer in the temple, who had planted him&s;elf there for the above|mentioned purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="13">13. Plutarch cannot forbear, on this occa&s;ion, &s;peaking with a kind of rapture on the &s;chemes of Providence, which, in this particular, had &s;o con|trived it, that the &s;tranger &s;hould, for &s;o great &s;pace of time, be debarred the means of doing ju&s;tice to his brother, till, by the &s;ame blow that revenged the death of one innocent man, he pre&s;erved the life of another.</P>
<P N="14">14. For my own part, I cannot wonder that a man of Timoleon's religion &s;hould have this intrepidity and firmne&s;s of mind, or that he &s;hould be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by &s;uch a deliverance as I have here related.</P>

<HEAD>The Folly of youthful Extravagance.</HEAD>
<BIBL>RAMBLER, No. 26.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. IT is u&s;ual for men, engaged in the &s;ame pur|&s;uits, to be inqui&s;itive after the conduct and fortune of each other; and, therefore, I &s;uppo&s;e it will not be unplea&s;ing to you, to read an account of the various changes which have appeared in part of a life devoted to literature. My narrative will not exhibit any great variety of events, or extraordinary revolutions; but may perhaps be not le&s;s u&s;eful, be|cau&s;e I &s;hall relate nothing which is not likely to happen to a thou&s;and others.</P>
<P N="2">2. I was born heir to a very &s;mall fortune, and left by my father, whom I cannot remember, to the care of an uncle. He having no children, always treated me as his &s;on, and finding in me tho&s;e qualities which old men ea&s;ily di&s;cover in &s;prightly children when they happen to love them, declared that a ge|nius like mine &s;hould never be lo&s;t for want of cul|tivation.</P>
<P N="3">3. He therefore placed me for the u&s;ual time at a great &s;chool, and then &s;ent me to the univer&s;ity, with a larger allowance than my own patrimony would have afforded, that I might not keep mean company, but learn to become my dignity when I &s;hould be made Lord Chancellor, which he often lamented that the increa&s;e of his infirmities was very likely to preclude him from &s;eeing.</P>
<P N="4">4. This exuberance of money di&s;played it&s;elf in gaiety of appearance, and wantonne&s;s of expence, and introduced me to the acquaintance of tho&s;e whom the &s;ame &s;uperfluity of fortune betrayed to the &s;ame licence and o&s;tentation: young heirs, who plea&s;ed them&s;elves with a remark very frequently in their mouths, that though they were &s;ent by their fathers to the univer&s;ity, they were not under the nece&s;&s;ity of living by their learning.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="176" REF="020531_0181_0FAFE2D1C27F6780">5. Among men of this cla&s;s I ea&s;ily obtained the reputation of a great genius, and was per&s;uaded that, with &s;uch liveline&s;s of imagination, and delicacy of &s;entiment, I &s;hould never be able to &s;ubmit to the drudgery of the law.</P>
<P N="6">6. I therefore gave my&s;elf wholly to the more airy and elegant parts of learning, and was often &s;o much elated with my &s;uperiority to the youths with whom I conver&s;ed, that I began to li&s;ten, with great atten|tion, to tho&s;e who recommended to me a wider and more con&s;picuous theatre; and was particularly touched with an ob&s;ervation made by one of my friends, that it was not by lingering in the univer&s;i|ty that Prior became amba&s;&s;ador, or Addi&s;on &s;ecre|tary of &s;tate.</P>
<P N="7">7. This de&s;ire was hourly increa&s;ed by the &s;olicita|tion of my companions, who, removing one by one to London, as the caprice of their relations allowed them, or the legal di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the hands of their guardians put it in their power, never failed to &s;end an account of the beauty and felicity of the new world, and to remon&s;trate how much was lo&s;t by eve|ry hour's continuance in a place of retirement and con&s;traint.</P>
<P N="8">8. My uncle in the mean time frequently harra&s;&s;ed me with monitory letters, which I &s;ometimes neg|lected to open for a week after I received them, and generally read in a tavern with &s;uch comments as might &s;hew how much I was &s;uperior to in&s;truction or advice. I could not but wonder, how a man confin|ed to the country, and unacquainted with the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of things, &s;hould imagine him&s;elf qualified to in&s;truct a ri&s;ing genius, born to give laws to the age, refine its ta&s;te, and multiply its plea&s;ures.</P>
<P N="9">9. The po&s;tman, however, &s;till continued to bring me new remon&s;trances; for my uncle was very little depre&s;&s;ed by the ridicule and reproach which he never heard. But men of parts have quick re&s;entments; it was impo&s;&s;ible to bear his u&s;urpations for ever; and
<PB N="177" REF="020531_0182_0FAFE2D283C81FD8">
I re&s;olved, once for all, to make him an example to tho&s;e who imagine them&s;elves wi&s;e becau&s;e they are old, and to teach young men, who are too tame un|der repre&s;entation, in what manner grey-bearded in&s;olence ought to be treated.</P>
<P N="10">10. I therefore one evening took my pen in hand, and after having animated my&s;elf with a catch, wrote a general an&s;wer to all his precepts, with &s;uch viva|city of turn, &s;uch elegance of irony, and &s;uch a&s;pe|rity of &s;arca&s;m, that I convul&s;ed a large company with univer&s;al laughter, di&s;turbed the neighbourhood with vociferations of applau&s;e, and five days after|wards was an&s;wered, that I mu&s;t be content to live upon my own e&s;tate.</P>
<P N="11">11. This contraction of my income gave me no di&s;turbance&punc; for a genius like mine was out of the reach of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t. I had friends that would be proud to open the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> pur&s;es at my call, and pro&s;pects of &s;uch advanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t as would &s;oon reconcile my uncle, whom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mature deliberation, I re&s;olved to re|ceive i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> favour, without in&s;i&s;ting on any acknow|ledgment of his offence, when the &s;plendor of my condition &s;hould induce him to wi&s;h for my counte|nance.</P>
<P N="12">12. I therefore went up to London, before I had &s;hewn the alteration of my condition, by any abate|ment of my way of living, and was received by all my academical acquaintance with triumph and con|gratulation. I was immediately introduced among the wits and men of &s;pirit; and, in a &s;hort time, had dive&s;ted my&s;elf of all my &s;cholar's gravity, and ob|tained the reputation of a pretty fellow.</P>
<P N="13">13. You will ea&s;ily believe that I had no great knowledge of the world; yet I had been hindered, by the general di&s;inclination every man feels to con|fe&s;s poverty, from telling to any one the re&s;olution of my uncle, and &s;ome time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;tock of money which I had brought with me, and contri|buted my &s;hare as before to all our entertainments.
<PB N="178" REF="020531_0183_0FAFE2D3437B2CA0">
But my pocket was &s;oon emptied, and I was obliged to a&s;k my friends for a &s;mall &s;um.</P>
<P N="14">14. This was a favour, which we had often reci|procally received from one another; they &s;uppo&s;ed my wants only accidental, and therefore willingly &s;upplied them. In a &s;hort time, I found a nece&s;&s;ity of a&s;king again, and was again treated with the &s;ame civility; but the third time they began to wonder what that old rogue my uncle could mean by &s;ending a gentleman to town without money; and when they gave me what I a&s;ked for, advi&s;ed me to &s;tipulate for more regular remittances.</P>
<P N="15">15. This &s;omewhat di&s;turbed my dream of con&s;tant affluence, but I was three days after completely a|waked; for entering the tavern, where we met every evening, I found the waiters remitted their com|plai&s;ance, and in&s;tead of contending to light me up &s;tairs, &s;uffered me to wait for &s;ome minutes by the bar.</P>
<P N="16">16. When I came to my company, I found them unu&s;ually grave and formal, and one of them took a hint to turn the conver&s;ation upon the mi&s;conduct of young men, and enlarged upon the folly of frequent|ing the company of men of fortune, without being able to &s;upport the expence; an ob&s;ervation which the re&s;t contributed either to enforce by repetition, or to illu&s;trate by examples. Only one of them tried to divert the di&s;cour&s;e, and endeavoured to direct my attention to remote que&s;tions, and common topics.</P>
<P N="17">17. A man guilty of poverty ea&s;ily believes him|&s;elf &s;u&s;pected. I went, however, next morning to breakfa&s;t with him who appeared ignorant of the drift of the conver&s;ation, and by a &s;eries of enqui|ries, drawing &s;till nearer to the point, prevailed on him, not, perhaps, much again&s;t his will, to inform me, that Mr. Da&s;h, who&s;e father was a wealthy at|torney near my native place, had the morning be|fore received an account of my uncle's re&s;entment, and communicated his intelligence with the utmo&s;t indu&s;try of groveling in&s;olence.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="179" REF="020531_0184_0FAFE2D3F9B44B08">18. It was now no longer practicable to con&s;ort with my former friends, unle&s;s I would be content to be u&s;ed as an inferior gue&s;t, who was to pay for his wine by mirth and flattery; a character, which, if I could not e&s;cape it, I re&s;olved to endure only a|mong tho&s;e who had never known me in the pride of plenty.</P>
<P N="19">19. I changed my lodgings, and frequented the coffee-hou&s;es in a different region of the town; where I was very quickly di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;everal young gentlemen of high birth, and large e&s;tates, and be|gan again to amu&s;e my imagination with hopes of preferment, though not quite &s;o confidently as when I had le&s;s experience.</P>
<P N="20">20. The fir&s;t great conque&s;t which this new &s;cene enabled me to gain over my&s;elf was, when I &s;ubmit|ted to confe&s;s to a party, who invited me to an ex|pen&s;ive diver&s;ion, that my revenues were not equal to &s;uch golden plea&s;ures; they would not &s;uffer me, however, to &s;tay behind, and with great reluctance I yielded to be treated. I took that opportunity of re|commending my&s;elf to &s;ome office, or employment, which they unanimou&s;ly promi&s;ed to procure me by their joint intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="21">21. I had now entered into a &s;tate of dependence, and had hopes, or fears, from almo&s;t every man I &s;aw. If it be unhappy to have one patron, what is his mi&s;ery who has &s;o many? I was obliged to com|ply with a thou&s;and caprices, to concur in a thou&s;and follies, and to countenance a thou&s;and errors.

<HEAD>The Mi&s;ery of depending upon the Great.</HEAD>
<BIBL>RAMBLER, No. 27.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. AS it is natural for every man to think him&s;elf of importance, your knowledge of the world will incline you to forgive me, if I imagine your cu|rio&s;ity &s;o much excited by the former part of my nar|ration, as to make you de&s;ire that I &s;hould proceed without any unnece&s;&s;ary arts of connection. I &s;hall, therefore, not keep you longer in &s;uch &s;u&s;pence, as perhaps my performance may not compen&s;ate.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the gay company with which I was now uni|ted, I found tho&s;e allurements and delights, which the friend&s;hip of young men always affords; there was that openne&s;s which naturally produced confidence, that affability which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;oftened depend|ence, and that ardour of profe&s;&s;ion which incited hope.</P>
<P N="3">3. When our hearts were dilated with merriment, promi&s;es were poured out with unlimited profu&s;ion, and life and fortune were but a &s;canty &s;acrifice to friend&s;hip; but when the hour came, at which any effort was to be made, I had generally the vexation to find that my intere&s;t weighed nothing again&s;t the
<PB N="181" REF="020531_0186_0FAFE2D65C376380">
&s;lighte&s;t amu&s;ement, and that every petty avocation was found a &s;ufficient plea for continuing me in un|certainty and want.</P>
<P N="4">4. Their kindne&s;s was indeed &s;incere, when they promi&s;ed they had no intention to deceive; but the &s;ame juvenile warmth which kindled their benevo|lence, gave force in the &s;ame proportion to every other pa&s;&s;ion, and I was forgotten as &s;oon as any new plea&s;ure &s;eized on their attention.</P>
<P N="5">5. Vagrio told me one evening, that all my per|plexities &s;hould be &s;oon at an end, and de&s;ired me from that in&s;tant to throw upon him all care of my fortune, for a po&s;t of con&s;iderable value was that day become vacant, and he knew his intere&s;t &s;ufficient to procure it in the morning. He de&s;ired me to call on him early, that he might be dre&s;&s;ed &s;oon enough to wait on the mini&s;ter before any other application &s;hould be made.</P>
<P N="6">6. I came as he appointed, with all the flame of gratitude, and was told by his &s;ervant, that having found at his lodgings, when he came home, an ac|quaintance who was going to travel, he had been per&s;uaded to accompany him to Dover, and that they had taken po&s;t hor&s;es two hours before day.</P>
<P N="7">7. I was once very near to preferment, by the kindne&s;s of Charinus, who, at my reque&s;t, went to beg a place, which he thought me likely to fill with great reputation, and in which I &s;hould have many opportunities of promoting his intere&s;t in return; and he plea&s;ed him&s;elf with imagining the mutual benefits that we &s;hould confer, and the advances that we &s;hould make by our united &s;trength.</P>
<P N="8">8. Away, therefore, he went, equally warm with friend&s;hip and ambition, and left me to prepare ac|knowledgments again&s;t his return. At length he came back, and told me that he had met in his way a party going to breakfa&s;t in the country, that the ladies importuned him too much to be refu&s;ed, and that having pa&s;&s;ed the morning with them, he was
<PB N="182" REF="020531_0187_0FAFE2D6F9F1B1C8">
come back to dre&s;s him&s;elf for a ball, to which he was invited for the evening.</P>
<P N="9">9. I have &s;uffered &s;everal di&s;appointments from taylors and perriwig-makers, who, by neglecting to perform their work, withh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld my patrons from court; and once failed of an e&s;tabli&s;hment for life by the delay of a &s;ervant, &s;ent to a neighbouring &s;hop to repleni&s;h a &s;nuff-box.</P>
<P N="10">10. At la&s;t I thought my &s;olitude at an end, for an office fell into the gift of Hippodamus's father, who being then in the country, could not very &s;peedily fill it, and who&s;e fondne&s;s would not have &s;uffered him to refu&s;e his &s;on a le&s;s rea&s;onable reque&s;t. Hip|podamus therefore &s;et forward with great expedition, and I expected every hour an account of his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P N="11">11. A long time I waited without any intelligence, but at la&s;t received a letter from Newmarket, by which I was informed, that the races were begun, and I knew the vehemence of his pa&s;&s;ions too well to imagine that he could refu&s;e him&s;elf his favourite a|mu&s;ement.</P>
<P N="12">12. You will not wonder that I was at la&s;t weary of the patronage of young men, e&s;pecially as I found them not generally to promi&s;e much greater fidelity as they advanced in life; for I ob&s;erved that what they gained in &s;teadine&s;s they lo&s;t in benevolence, and grew colder to my intere&s;t as they became more diligent to promote their own.</P>
<P N="13">13. I was convinced that their liberality was only profu&s;ene&s;s, that, as chance directed, they were e|qually generous to vice and virtue, that they were warm, but becau&s;e they were thoughtle&s;s, and count|ed the &s;upport of a friend only among&s;t other gratifi|cations of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="14">14. My re&s;olution was now to ingratiate my&s;elf with men who&s;e reputation was e&s;tabli&s;hed, who&s;e high &s;tations enabled them to prefer me, and who&s;e age exempted them from &s;udden changes of inclina|tion. I was con&s;idered as a man of parts, and there|fore
<PB N="183" REF="020531_0188_0FAFE2D7C05192D0">
ea&s;ily found admi&s;&s;ion to the table of Hilarius, the celebrated orator, renowned equally for the ex|tent of his knowledge, the elegance of his diction, and the acutene&s;s of his wit.</P>
<P N="15">15. Hilarius received me with an appearance of great &s;atisfaction, produced to me all his friends, and directed to me that part of his di&s;cour&s;e in which he mo&s;t endeavoured to di&s;play his imagination. I had now learned my own intere&s;t enough to &s;upply him with opportunities for &s;mart remarks and gay &s;allies, which I never failed to echo and applaud.</P>
<P N="16">16. Thus I was gaining every hour on his affecti|ons, till unfortunately, when the a&s;&s;embly was more &s;plendid than u&s;ual, his de&s;ire of admiration prompt|ed him to turn his raillery upon me. I bore it for &s;ome time with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ucce&s;s encou|raged him to redouble his attacks; at la&s;t my vani|ty prevailed over my prudence; I retorted his irony with &s;uch &s;pirit, that Hilarius, unaccu&s;tomed to re|&s;i&s;tance, was di&s;concerted, and &s;oon found means of convincing me, that his purpo&s;e was not to encourage a rival, but to fo&s;ter a para&s;ite.</P>
<P N="17">17. I was then taken into the familiarity of Argu|tio, a nobleman eminent for judgment and critici&s;m. He had contributed to my reputation, by the prai&s;es which he had often be&s;towed upon my writings, in which he owned that there were proofs of a genius that might ri&s;e to high degrees of excellence, when time, or information, had reduced its exuberance.</P>
<P N="18">18. He therefore required me to con&s;ult him be|fore the publication of any new performance, and commonly propo&s;ed innumerable alterations, with|out &s;ufficient attention to the general de&s;ign, or re|gard to my form of &s;tyle, and mode of imagination.</P>
<P N="19">19. But the&s;e corrections he never failed to pre&s;s as indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, and thought the lea&s;t de|lay of compliance an act of rebellion. The pride of an author made this treatment in&s;ufferable, and I
<PB N="184" REF="020531_0189_0FAFE2D880D8DBA0">
thought any tyranny ea&s;ier to be borne than that which took from me the u&s;e of my under&s;tanding.</P>
<P N="20">20. My next patron was Eutyches the &s;tate&s;man, who was wholly engaged in public affairs, and &s;eem|ed to have no ambition but to be powerful and rich. I found his favour more permanent than that of the others, for there was a certain price at which it might be bought; he allowed nothing to humour or to affection, but was always ready to pay liberally for the &s;ervice he required.</P>
<P N="21">21. His demands were, indeed, very often &s;uch as virtue could not ea&s;ily con&s;ent to gratify; but vir|tue is not to be con&s;ulted when men are to rai&s;e their fortunes by the favour of the great. His mea&s;ures were cen&s;ured; I wrote in his defence, and was re|compen&s;ed with a place, of which the profits were never received by me without the pangs of remem|bering that they were the reward of wickedne&s;s; a reward which nothing but that nece&s;&s;ity, which the con&s;umption of my little e&s;tate in the&s;e wild pur&s;uits had brought upon me, hindered me from throwing back in the face of my corruptor.</P>
<P N="22">22. At this time my uncle died without a will, and I became heir to a &s;mall fortune. I had re&s;olu|tion to throw off the &s;plendor which reproached me to my&s;elf, and retire to an humbler &s;tate, in which I am now endeavouring to recover the dignity of virtue, and hope to make &s;ome reparation for my crimes and follies, by informing others, who may be led after the &s;ame pageants, that they are about to engage in a cour&s;e of life, in which they are to purcha&s;e, by a thou&s;and mi&s;eries, the privilege of repentance.</P>

<HEAD>What it is to &s;ee the World; the Story of Meli&s;&s;a.</HEAD>
<BIBL>RAMBLER, No. 75.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. THE diligence with which you endeavour to cultivate the knowledge of nature, manners, and life, will perhaps incline you to pay &s;ome regard to the ob&s;ervations of one who has been taught to know mankind by unwelcome information, and who&s;e opinions are the re&s;ult, not of &s;olitary conjectures, but of practice and experience.</P>
<P N="2">2. I was born to a large fortune, and bred to the knowledge of tho&s;e arts which are &s;uppo&s;ed to accom|pli&s;h the mind, and adorn the per&s;on of a woman. To the&s;e attainments, which cu&s;tom and education almo&s;t forced upon me, I added &s;ome voluntary ac|qui&s;itions by the u&s;e of books, and the conver&s;ation of that &s;pecies of men whom the ladies generally mention with terror and aver&s;ion under the name of &s;cholars, but whom I have found a harmle&s;s and in|offen&s;ive order of beings, not &s;o much wi&s;er than our&s;elves, but that they may receive as well as com|municate knowledge, and more inclined to degrade their own character by cowardly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, than to overbear or oppre&s;s us with their learning or their wit.</P>
<P N="3">3. From the&s;e men, however, if they are by kind treatment encouraged to talk, &s;omething may be gained, which embelli&s;hed with elegancy, and &s;oft|ened by mode&s;ty, will always add dignity and value to female conver&s;ation; and from my acquaintance with the booki&s;h part of the world, I derived many principles of judgment and maxims of prudence, by which I was enabled to draw upon my&s;elf the general regard in every place of concour&s;e or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="4">4. My opinion was the great rule of approbation, my remarks were remembered by tho&s;e who de&s;ired the &s;econd degree of fame, my mein was &s;tudied, my dre&s;s was imitated, my letters were handed from one
<PB N="186" REF="020531_0191_0FAFE2DA040173A0">
family to another, and read by tho&s;e who copied them as &s;ent to them&s;elves, my vi&s;its were &s;ollicited as honours, and multitudes boa&s;ted of an intimacy with Meli&s;&s;a, who had only &s;een me by accident, who&s;e familiarity had never proceeded beyond the exchange of a compliment, or return of a courte&s;y.</P>
<P N="5">5. I &s;hall make no &s;cruple of confe&s;&s;ing that I was plea&s;ed with this univer&s;al veneration, becau&s;e I al|ways con&s;idered it as paid to my intrin&s;ic qualities and in&s;eparable merit, and very ea&s;y per&s;uaded my|&s;elf, that fortune had no part in my &s;uperiority.</P>
<P N="6">6. When I looked upon my gla&s;s I &s;aw youth and beauty, with health that might give me rea&s;on to hope their continuance: when I examined my mind, I found &s;ome &s;trength of judgment, and fertility of fancy; and was told that every action was grace, and that every accent was per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">7. In this manner my life pa&s;&s;ed like a continual triumph amid&s;t acclamations, and envy, and court|&s;hip, and care&s;&s;es: to plea&s;e Meli&s;&s;a was the general ambition, and every &s;tratagem of artful flattery was practi&s;ed upon me. To be flattered is grateful, e|ven when we know that our prai&s;es are not believed by tho&s;e who pronounce them; for they prove, at lea&s;t, our power, and &s;hew that our favour is valued &s;ince it is purcha&s;ed by the meanne&s;s of fal&s;hood.</P>
<P N="8">8. But, perhaps, the flatterer is not often detect|ed, for an hone&s;t mind is not apt to &s;u&s;pect, and no one exerts the powers of di&s;cernment with much vi|gour when &s;elf love favours the deceit.</P>
<P N="9">9. The number of adorers, and the perpetual di&s;|traction of my thoughts by new &s;chemes of plea&s;ures, prevented me from li&s;tening to any of tho&s;e who croud in multitudes to give girls advice, and kept me un|married and unengaged to my twenty-&s;eventh year, when as I was towering in all the pride of unconte&s;t|ed excellency, with a face yet little impaired, and a mind hourly improving, the failure of a fund, in which my money was placed, reduced me to a frugal
<PB N="187" REF="020531_0192_0FAFE2DAB98CD960">
competency, which allowed a little beyond neatne&s;s and independence.</P>
<P N="10">10. I bore the diminution of my riches without any outrages of &s;orrow, or pu&s;illanimity of dejection. Indeed I did not know how much I had lo&s;t, for ha|ving always heard and thought more of my wit and beauty, than of my fortune, it did not &s;uddenly en|ter my imagination, that Meli&s;&s;a could &s;ink beneath her e&s;tabli&s;hed rank, while her form and her mind continued the &s;ame; that &s;he &s;hould cea&s;e to rai&s;e ad|miration but by cea&s;ing to de&s;erve it, or feel any &s;troke but from the hand of time.</P>
<P N="11">11. It was in my power to have concealed the lo&s;s, and to have married, by continuing the &s;ame appear|ance, with all the credit of my original fortune; but I was not &s;o far &s;unk in my e&s;teem, as to &s;ubmit to the ba&s;ene&s;s of fraud, or to de&s;ire any other recom|mendation than &s;en&s;e and virtue.</P>
<P N="12">12. I therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed my equipage, &s;old tho&s;e ornaments which were become un&s;uitable to my new condition, and appeared among tho&s;e with whom I u&s;ed to conver&s;e with le&s;s glitter, but with equal &s;pirit.</P>
<P N="13">13. I found my&s;elf received at every vi&s;it, with &s;or|row beyond what is naturally felt for calamities in which we have no part, and was entertained with condolence and con&s;olation, &s;o frequently repeated, that my friends plainly con&s;ulted rather their own gratification, than my relief.</P>
<P N="14">14. Some from that time refu&s;ed my acquaintance, and forebore, without any provocation, to repay my vi&s;its; &s;ome vi&s;ited me, but after a longer interval than u&s;ual, and every return was &s;till with more de|lay; nor did any of my female acquaintances fail to introduce the mention of my misfortunes, to compare my pre&s;ent and former condition, to tell me how much it mu&s;t trouble me to want the &s;plendor which I became &s;o well; to look at plea&s;ures, which I had formerly enjoyed, and to &s;ink to a level with tho&s;e by
<PB N="188" REF="020531_0193_0FAFE2DB7B330780">
whom I had been con&s;idered as moving in a higher &s;phere, and who had hitherto approached me with reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which I was now no longer to expect.</P>
<P N="15">15. Ob&s;ervations like the&s;e are commonly nothing better than covert in&s;ults, which &s;erve to give vent to the flatulence of pride, but they are now and then imprudently uttered by hone&s;ty and benevolence, and inflict pain where kindne&s;s is intended; I will, there|fore, &s;o far maintain my antiquated claim to polite|ne&s;s, as to venture the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this rule, that no one ought to remind another of misfortunes of which the &s;ufferer does not complain, and which there are no means propo&s;ed of alleviating.</P>
<P N="16">16. You have no right to excite thoughts which nece&s;&s;arily give pain whenever they return, and which perhaps might not have revived but by ab&s;urd and un&s;ea&s;onable compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="17">17. My endle&s;s train of lovers immediately with|drew, without rai&s;ing any emotions. The greater part had indeed always profe&s;&s;ed to court, as it is termed, upon the &s;quare, had enquired my fortune, and offered &s;ettlements; the&s;e undoubtedly had a right to retire without cen&s;ure, &s;ince they had openly treated for money, as nece&s;&s;ary to their happine&s;s, and who can tell how little they wanted any other portion?</P>
<P N="18">18. I have always thought the clamours of women unrea&s;onable, who imagine them&s;elves injured be|cau&s;e the men who followed them upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of a greater fortune, reject them when they are di&s;|covered to have le&s;s. I have never known any lady, who did not think wealth a title to &s;ome &s;tipulations in her favour; and &s;urely what is claimed by the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of money, is ju&s;tly forfeited by its lo&s;s.</P>
<P N="19">19. She that has once demanded a &s;ettlement has allowed the importance of fortune; and when &s;he cannot &s;hew pecuniary merit, why &s;hould &s;he think her cheapner obliged to purcha&s;e?</P>
<P N="20"><PB N="189" REF="020531_0194_0FAFE2DC3A3D4958">20. My lovers were not all contented with &s;ilent de&s;ertion. Some of them revenged the neglect which they had formerly endured by wanton and &s;uperfluous in&s;ults, and endeavoured to mortify me by paying in my pre&s;ence tho&s;e civilities to other ladies, which were once devoted only to me.</P>
<P N="21">21. But as it had been my rule to treat men ac|cording to the rank of their intellect, I had never &s;uffered any one to wa&s;te is life in &s;u&s;pence who could have employed it to better purpo&s;e, and had there|fore no enemies but coxcombs, who&s;e re&s;entment and re&s;pect were equally below my con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="22">22. The only pain which I have felt from degra|dation, is the lo&s;s of that influence which I have al|ways exerted on the &s;ide of virtue, in the defence of innocence, and the a&s;&s;ertion of truth. I now find my opinions &s;lighted, my &s;entiments critici&s;ed, and my arguments oppo&s;ed by tho&s;e that u&s;ed to li&s;ten to me without reply, and &s;truggle to be fir&s;t in expre&s;|&s;ing their conviction.</P>
<P N="23">23. The female di&s;putants have wholly thrown off my authority, and if I endeavour to enforce my rea|&s;ons by an appeal to the &s;cholars that happen to be pre&s;ent, the wretches are certain to pay their court by &s;acrificing me and my &s;y&s;tem to a finer gown, and I am every hour in&s;ulted with contradiction by cow|ards, who could never find till lately that Meli&s;&s;a was liable to error.</P>
<P N="24">24. There are two per&s;ons only whom I cannot charge with having changed their conduct with my change of fortune. One is an old curate, that has pa&s;&s;ed his life in the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion, with great reputation for his knowledge and piety: the other is a lieutenant of dragoons. The par&s;on made no difficulty in the heighth of my elevation to check me when I was pert, and in&s;truct me when I blunder|ed; and if there is any alteration, he is now more timorous, le&s;t his freedom &s;hould be thought rude|ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="25"><PB N="190" REF="020531_0195_0FAFE2DCFADA92F8">25. The &s;oldier never paid me any particular ad|dre&s;&s;es, but very rigidly ob&s;erved all the rules of po|litene&s;s, which he is now &s;o far from relaxing, that whenever he &s;erves the tea, he ob&s;tinately carries me the fir&s;t di&s;h, in defiance of the frowns and whi&s;pers of the table.</P>
<P N="26">26. This, Mr. Rambler, is <HI>to &s;ee the world.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e that have only known affluence and pro&s;perity, to judge rightly of them&s;elves or o|thers.

<P N="1">1. I WAS ye&s;terday about &s;un-&s;et walking in the open fields, till the night in&s;en&s;ibly fell upon me.

In the &s;ame manner when I con&s;idered that in|finite ho&s;t of &s;tars, or, to &s;peak more philo&s;ophically, of &s;uns, who were then &s;hining upon me, with tho&s;e innumerable &s;ets of planets or worlds, which were moving round their re&s;pective &s;uns; when I &s;till en|larged the idea, and &s;uppo&s;ed another heaven of &s;uns and worlds ri&s;ing &s;till above this which he had di&s;co|vered, and the&s;e &s;till enlightened by a &s;uperior fir|mament of luminaries, which are planted at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that they may appear to the inhabitants of the former as the &s;tars do to us; in &s;hort, while I pur&s;ued this thought, I could not but reflect on that little in&s;ignificant figure which I my&s;elf bore amid&s;t the immen&s;ity of God's works.</P>
<P N="5">5. Were the &s;un, which enlightens this part of the creation, with all the ho&s;t of planetary worlds that move about him, utterly extingui&s;hed and annihilat|ed, they would not be mi&s;&s;ed, more than a grain of &s;and upon the &s;ea-&s;hore. The &s;pace they po&s;&s;e&s;s is &s;o exceedingly little in compari&s;on of the whole, that it would &s;carce make a blank in the creation. The cha&s;m would be imperceptible to an eye, that could take in the whole compa&s;s of nature, and pa&s;s from one end of the creation to the other; as it is po&s;&s;ible there may be &s;uch a &s;en&s;e in our&s;elves hereafter, or in creatures which are at pre&s;ent more exalted than our&s;elves.</P>
<P N="6">6. We &s;ee many &s;tars by the help of gla&s;&s;es, which we do not di&s;cover with our naked eyes; and the finer our tele&s;copes are, the more &s;till are our di&s;coveries.
<PB N="192" REF="020531_0197_0FAFE2DE7A4E48E8">
<HI>Huygenius</HI> carries his thought &s;o far, that he does not think it impo&s;&s;ible there may be &s;tars who&s;e light is not yet travelled down to us, &s;ince their fir&s;t creation. There is no que&s;tion but the univer&s;e has certain bounds &s;et to it; but when we con&s;ider that it is the work of infinite power, prompted by infinite good|ne&s;s, with an infinite &s;pace to exert it&s;elf in, how can our imagination &s;et any bounds to it?</P>
<P N="7">7. To return, therefore, to my fir&s;t thought, I could not but look apon my&s;elf with &s;ecret horror, as a being that was not worth the &s;malle&s;t regard of one who had &s;o great a work under his care and &s;uperin|tendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amid&s;t the immen&s;ity of nature, and lo&s;t among that infinite variety of creatures, which in all probability &s;warm through all the&s;e immea&s;urable regions of matter.</P>
<P>In order to recover my&s;elf from this mortifying thought, I con&s;idered that it took its ri&s;e from tho&s;e narrow conceptions, which we are apt to maintain of the divine nature. We our &s;elves cannot attend to many different objects at the &s;ame time. If we are careful to in&s;pect &s;ome things, we mu&s;t of cour&s;e neg|lect others.</P>
<P N="8">8. This imperfection which we ob&s;erve in our&s;elves is an imperfection that cleaves in &s;ome degree to crea|tures of the highe&s;t capacities, as they are creatures, that is, beings of finite and limited natures. The pre&s;ence of every created being is confined to a cer|tain mea&s;ure of &s;pace, and con&s;equently his ob&s;erva|tion is &s;tinted to a certain number of objects. The &s;phere in which we move, and act, and under&s;tand, is of a wider circumference to one creature than ano|ther, according as we ri&s;e one above another in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="9">9. But the wide&s;t of the&s;e our &s;pheres has its cir|cumference. When therefore we reflect on the di|vine nature, we are &s;o u&s;ed and accu&s;tomed to this imperfection in our&s;elves, that we cannot forbear in &s;ome mea&s;ure a&s;cribing it to him in whom there is
<PB N="193" REF="020531_0198_0FAFE2DF43A77C60">
no &s;hadow of imperfection.&mdash;Our rea&s;on indeed a&s;|&s;ures that his attributes are infinite, but the poorne&s;s of our conceptions is &s;uch that it cannot forbear &s;et|ting bounds to every thing it contemplates, till our rea&s;on comes again to our &s;uccour, and throws down all tho&s;e little prejudices which ri&s;e in us unawares, and are natural to the mind of man.</P>
<P N="10">10. We &s;hall therefore utterly extingui&s;h this me|lancholy thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker in the multiplicity of his works, and the in|finity of tho&s;e objects among which he &s;eems to be ince&s;&s;antly employed, if we con&s;ider, in the fir&s;t place, that he is omnipre&s;ent; and in the &s;econd, that he is omni&s;cient.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider him in his omnipre&s;ence: his being pa&s;&s;es through, actuates and &s;upports the whole frame of nature. His creation and every part of it, is full of him.</P>
<P N="11">11. There is nothing he has made, that is either &s;o di&s;tant, &s;o little, or &s;o incon&s;iderable, which he does not e&s;&s;entially inhabit. His &s;ub&s;tance is within the &s;ub&s;tance of every being, whether material or immaterial, and as intimately pre&s;ent to it, as that being is to it&s;elf&punc; It would be an imperfection in him, were he able to remove o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of one place into another, or to withdraw him&s;elf from any thing he has created, or from any part of that &s;pace which is diffu&s;ed and &s;pread abroad to infinity. In &s;hort, to &s;peak of him in the language of the old philo&s;ophers, he is a being who&s;e centre is every-where, and his circumference no-where.</P>
<P N="12">12. In the &s;econd place, he is omni&s;cient as well as omnipre&s;ent. His omni&s;cience indeed nece&s;&s;arily and naturally flows from his omnipre&s;ence. He can|not but be con&s;cious of every motion that ari&s;es in the whole material world, which he thus e&s;&s;entially pervades; and of every thought that is &s;tirring in the intellectual world, to every part of which he is thus intimately united. Several morali&s;ts have con|&s;idered
<PB N="194" REF="020531_0199_0FAFE22F0D5A1B28">
the creation as the temple of God, which he has built with his own hands, and which is filled with his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P N="13">13. Others have con&s;idered infinite &s;pace as the receptacle, or rather the habitation of the Almighty: but the noble&s;t and mo&s;t exalted way of con&s;idering this infinite &s;pace is that of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> who calls it the <HI>&s;en&s;orium</HI> of the Godhead. Brutes and men have their <HI>&s;en&s;oriola,</HI> or little <HI>&s;en&s;oriums,</HI> by which they apprehend the pre&s;ence and perceive the actions of a few objects that lie contiguous to them. Their knowledge and apprehen&s;ion turn within a very nar|row circle. But as God Almighty cannot but per|ceive and know every thing in which he re&s;ides, in|finite &s;pace gives room to infinite knowledge, and is, as it were, an organ to omni&s;cience.</P>
<P N="14">14. Were the &s;oul &s;eperate from the body, and with one glance of thought &s;hould &s;tart beyond the bounds of the creation; &s;hould it for millions of years continue its progre&s;s through infinite &s;pace with the &s;ame activity, it would &s;till find it&s;elf within the em|braces of its Creator, and encompa&s;&s;ed round with the immen&s;ity of the God-head. While we are in the body he is not le&s;s pre&s;ent with us, becau&s;e he is concealed from us. <HI>Oh that I knew where I might find him!</HI> &s;ays Job. <HI>Behold I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: on the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot be|hold him: he hideth him&s;elf on the right hand that I cannot &s;ee him.</HI> In &s;hort, rea&s;on as well as revelation a&s;&s;ures us, that he cannot be ab&s;ent from us, not|with&s;tanding he is undi&s;covered by us.</P>
<P N="15">15. In this con&s;ideration of God Almighty's om|nipre&s;ence and omni&s;cience, every uncomfortable thought vani&s;hes. He cannot but regard every thing that has being, e&s;pecially &s;uch of his creatures who fear they are not regarded by him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this oc|ca&s;ion;

for, as it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould overlook any of his creatures, &s;o we may be confident that he re|gards, with an eye of mercy, tho&s;e who endeavour to recommend them&s;elves to his notice, and in un|feigned humility of heart think them&s;elves unworthy that he &s;hould be mindful of them.</P>

<P N="1">1. IN your paper of <HI>Friday</HI> the 9th in&s;tant, you had occa&s;ion to con&s;ider the ubiquity of the God|head, and at the &s;ame time to &s;hew, that as he is pre&s;ent to every thing, he cannot but be attentive to every thing, and privy to all the modes and parts of its exi&s;tence; or, in other words, that his omni&s;ci|ence and omnipre&s;ence are coexi&s;tent, and run toge|ther through the whole infinitude of &s;pace.</P>
<P N="2">2. This con&s;ideration might furni&s;h us with many incentive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to devotion, and motives to morality; but as this &s;ubject has been handled by &s;everal excellent writers I &s;hall con&s;ider it in a light wherein I have not &s;een it placed by others.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> How di&s;con&s;olate is the condition of an in|tellectual being who is thus pre&s;ent with his Maker, but at the &s;ame time receives no extraordinary benefit or advantage from this his pre&s;ence!</P>

Every particle of matter is actuated by this Almighty Being which pa&s;&s;es through it. The heavens and the earth, the &s;tars and planets, move and gravitate by virtue of this great principle within them. All the dead parts of nature are invigorated by the pre&s;ence of their Creator, and made capable of exerting their re&s;pective qualities.</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;everal in&s;tincts in the brute creation do likewi&s;e operate and work towards the &s;everal ends which are agreeable to them, by this divine energy. Man only, who does not co-operate with his ho|ly &s;pirit, and is unattentive to his pre&s;ence, re|ceives none of the&s;e advantages from it, which are perfective of his nature, and nece&s;&s;ary to his well-being. The divinity is with him, and in him, and every where about him, but of no advantage to him.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is the &s;ame thing to a man without religion, as if there were no God in the world. It is indeed im|po&s;&s;ible for an infinite Being to remove him&s;elf from any of his creatures; but though he cannot withdraw his e&s;&s;ence from us, which would argue an imperfecti|on in him, he can withdraw from us all the joys and con&s;olations of it. His pre&s;ence may perhaps be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport us in our exi&s;tence; but he may leave this our exi&s;tence to it&s;elf, with regard to our happine&s;s or mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="7">7. For, in this &s;en&s;e, he may ca&s;t us away from his pre&s;ence, and take his holy &s;pirit from us.

<P N="8"><PB N="197" REF="020531_0202_0FAFE2313AF81990">8. We may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that the great Author of Nature will not always be as one, who is indiffer|ent to any of his creatures. Tho&s;e who will not feel him in his love will be &s;ure at length to feel him in his di&s;plea&s;ure. And how dreadful is the condition of that creature, who is only &s;en&s;ible of the being of his Creator by what he &s;uffers from him! He is as e&s;&s;entially pre&s;ent in hell as in heaven; but the inha|bitants of tho&s;e accur&s;ed places behold him only in his wrath, and &s;hrink within the flames to conceal them&s;elves from him.

<P N="9">9. But I &s;hall only con&s;ider the wretchedne&s;s of an intellectual being, who, in this life, lies under the di&s;plea&s;ure of him, that at all times, and in all pla|ces, is intimately united with him. He is able to di&s;quiet the &s;oul, and vex it in all its faculties. He can hinder any of the greate&s;t comforts of life from refre&s;hing us, and give an edge to every one of its &s;lighte&s;t calamities.</P>
<P N="10">10.

<P N="11">11. The ble&s;&s;ed in heaven behold him face to face, that is, are as &s;en&s;ible of his pre&s;ence as we are of the pre&s;ence of any per&s;on whom we look upon with our eyes. There is doubtle&s;s a faculty in &s;pirits, by which they apprehend one another, as our &s;en&s;es do material objects; and there is no que&s;tion but our &s;ouls, when they are di&s;embodied, or placed in glo|rified

bodies, will by this faculty, in what ever &s;pace they re&s;ide, be always &s;en&s;ible of the divine pre&s;ence.</P>
<P N="12">12. We who have this veil of fle&s;h &s;tanding be|tween us and the world of &s;pirits, mu&s;t be content to know the &s;pirit of God is pre&s;ent with us, by the ef|fects which he produceth in us. Our outward &s;en&s;es are too gro&s;s to apprehend him; we may however ta&s;te and &s;ee how gracious he is, by his influence upon our minds, by tho&s;e virtuous thoughts which he awa|kens in us, by tho&s;e &s;ecret comforts and refre&s;hments which he conveys into our &s;ouls, and by tho&s;e ravi&s;h|ing joys and inward &s;atisfactions which are perpetu|ally &s;pringing up, and diffu&s;ing them&s;elves among all the thoughts of good men.</P>
<P N="13">13. He is lodged in our very e&s;&s;ence, and is as a &s;oul within the &s;oul to irradiate its under&s;tanding, rectify its will, purify its pa&s;&s;ions, and enliven all the powers of man. How happy therefore is an intel|lectual being, who by prayer and meditation, by virtue and good works, opens this communication be|tween God and his own &s;oul! Though the whole creation frowns upon him, and all nature looks black about him, he has his light and &s;upport within him, that are able to chear his mind, and bear him up in the mid&s;t of all tho&s;e horrors which encompa&s;s him.</P>
<P N="14">14. He knows that his helper is at hand, and is always nearer to him than any thing el&s;e can be, which is capable of annoying or terrifying him. In the mid&s;t of calumny or contempt, he attends to that Being who whi&s;pers better things within his &s;oul, and whom he looks upon as his defender, his glory, and the lifter up of his head. In his deepe&s;t &s;olitude and retirement, he knows that he is in company with the greate&s;t of beings; and perceives within him&s;elf &s;uch real &s;en&s;ations of his pre&s;ence, as are more de|lightful than any thing that can be met with in the conver&s;ations of his creatures.</P>
<P N="15">15. Even in the hour of death, he con&s;iders the pains of his di&s;&s;olution to be nothing el&s;e but the

<P N="16">16. If we would be thus happy and thus &s;en&s;ible of our Maker's pre&s;ence, from the &s;ecret effects of his mercy and goodne&s;s, we mu&s;t keep &s;uch a watch over all our thoughts, that, in the language of the &s;crip|ture, his &s;oul may have plea&s;ure in us.

<P N="17">17. The light of nature could direct <HI>Seneca</HI> to this doctrine, in a very remarkable pa&s;&s;age among his epi&s;tles; <HI>Sacer ine&s;t in nobis &s;piritus, bonorum malo|rumque cu&s;tos et ob&s;ervator; et quemadmodum nos illum tractamus, ita et ille nos.</HI>

<BIBL>SPECTATOR, No. 580.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. I Con&s;idered in my two la&s;t letters, that awful and tremendous &s;ubject, the ubiquity or omni|pre&s;ence of the Divine Being. I have &s;hewn that he is equally pre&s;ent in all places throughout the whole extent of infinite &s;pace. This doctrine is &s;o agree|able to rea&s;on, that we meet with it in the writings of the enlightened heathens, as I might &s;hew at large, were it not already done by other hands. But
<PB N="200" REF="020531_0205_0FAFE2337B937318">
though the Deity be thus e&s;&s;entially pre&s;ent through all the immen&s;ity of &s;pace, there is one part of it in which he di&s;covers him&s;elf in a mo&s;t tran&s;cendent and vi&s;ible glory.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is that place which is marked out in &s;crip|ture under the different appellations of <HI>Paradi&s;e, the third heaven, the throne of God and the habitation of his glory.</HI> It is here where the glorified body of our Saviour re&s;ides, and where all the cele&s;tial hierar|chies, and the innumerable ho&s;ts of angels, are re|pre&s;ented as perpetually &s;urrounding the &s;eat of God with hallelujahs and hymns of prai&s;e. This is that pre&s;ence of God which &s;ome of the divines call his glorious, and others his maje&s;tic pre&s;ence.</P>
<P N="3">3. He is indeed as e&s;&s;entially pre&s;ent in all other places as in this; but it is here where he re&s;ides in a &s;en&s;ible magnificence, and in the mid&s;t of all tho&s;e &s;plendors which can affect the imagination of created beings.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable that this opinion of God Almighty's pre&s;ence in heaven, whether di&s;covered by the light of nature, or by a general tradition from our fir&s;t parents, prevails among all the nations of the world, what&s;oever different notions they enter|tain of the Godhead.</P>
<P N="4">4. If you look into <HI>Homer,</HI> that is, the mo&s;t antient of the <HI>Greek</HI> writers, you &s;ee the &s;upreme power &s;eat|ed in the heavens, and encompa&s;&s;ed with inferior deities, among whom the mu&s;es are repre&s;ented as &s;inging ince&s;&s;antly about his throne. Who does not here &s;ee the main &s;trokes and outlines of this great truth we are &s;peaking of?</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;ame doctrine is &s;hadowed out in many o|ther heathen authors, though at the &s;ame time, like &s;everal other revealed truths, da&s;hed and adulterated with a mixture of fables and human inventions. But to pa&s;s over the notions of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> tho&s;e more enlightened parts of the pagan world, we find there is &s;carce a people among the late di&s;cover|ed

nations who are not trained up in an opinion that heaven is the habitation of the divinity whom they wor&s;hip.</P>
<P N="6">6. As in <HI>Solomon's</HI> temple there was the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> in which a vi&s;ible glory appeared among the figures of the cherubims, and into which none but the high-prie&s;t him&s;elf was permitted to enter, after having made an atonement for the &s;ins of the peo|ple; &s;o if we con&s;ider this whole creation as one great temple, there is in it the Holy of Holies, into which the high-prie&s;t of our &s;alvation entered, and took his place among angels and archangels, after having made a propitiation for the &s;ins of mankind.</P>
<P N="7">7. With how much &s;kill mu&s;t the throne of God be erected? With what glorious de&s;igns is that habita|tion beautified, which is contrived and built by him who in&s;pired <HI>Hiram</HI> with wi&s;dom? How great mu&s;t be the maje&s;ty of that place, where the whole art of creation has been employed, and where God has cho|&s;en to &s;hew him&s;elf in the mo&s;t magnificent manner? What mu&s;t be the architecture of infinite power un|der the direction of divine wi&s;dom? A &s;pirit cannot but be tran&s;ported after an ineffable manner with the &s;ight of tho&s;e objects, which were made to affect him by that Being who knows the inward frame of a &s;oul, and how to plea&s;e and ravi&s;h it in all its mo&s;t &s;ecret powers and faculties.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is to this maje&s;tic pre&s;ence of God, we may apply tho&s;e beautiful expre&s;&s;ions in holy writ: <HI>Behold even to the moon, and it &s;hineth not; yea the &s;tars are not pure in his &s;ight.</HI> The light of the &s;un, and all the glories of the world in which we live, are but as weak and &s;ickly glimmerings, or rather darkne&s;s it|&s;elf, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e &s;plendors which encom|pa&s;s the throne of God.</P>
<P N="9">9. As the glory of this place is tran&s;cendent be|yond imagination, &s;o probably is the extent of it. There is light behind light, and glory within glory. How far that &s;pace may reach, in which God thus

If he has made the&s;e lower regions of matter &s;o in|conceivably wide and magnificent for the habitation of mortal and peri&s;hable beings, how great may we &s;uppo&s;e the courts of his hou&s;e to be, where he makes his re&s;idence in a more e&s;pecial manner, and di&s;plays him&s;elf in the fulne&s;s of his glory, among an innu|merable company of angels, and &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect!</P>
<P N="10">10. This is certain that our imaginations cannot be rai&s;ed too high, when we think on a place where omnipotence and omni&s;cience have &s;o &s;ignally exerted them&s;elves, becau&s;e that they are able to produce a &s;cene infinitely more great and glorious than what we are able to imagine.</P>
<P N="11">11. It is not impo&s;&s;ible but at the con&s;ummation of all things, the&s;e outward apartments of nature, which are now &s;uited to tho&s;e beings who inhabit them, may be taken in and added to that glorious place of which I am here &s;peaking; and by that means made a proper habitation for beings who are exempt from mortality, and cleared of their imper|fections: for &s;o the &s;cripture &s;eems to intimate when it &s;peaks of new heavens and of a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="12">12. I have only con&s;idered this glorious place with regard to the &s;ight and imagination, though it is highly probable that our other &s;en&s;es may here like|wi&s;e enjoy their highe&s;t gratifications. There is no|thing which more ravi&s;hes and tran&s;ports the &s;oul, than harmony; and we have great rea&s;on to believe, from the de&s;cription of this place in holy &s;cripture, that this is one of the entertainments of it.</P>
<P N="13">13. And if the &s;oul of man can be &s;o wonderfully affected with tho&s;e &s;trains of mu&s;ic, which human art is capable of producing, how much more will it be
<PB N="203" REF="020531_0208_0FAFE235CA03CC08">
rai&s;ed and elevated by tho&s;e, in which is exerted the whole power of harmony! The &s;en&s;es are faculties of the human &s;oul, though they cannot be employed, during this our vital union, without proper in&s;tru|ments in the body.</P>
<P N="14">14. Why therefore &s;hould we exclude the &s;atisfac|tion of the&s;e faculties, which we find by experience are inlets of great plea&s;ure to the &s;oul, from among tho&s;e entertainments which are to make our happi|ne&s;s hereafter? Why &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e that our hear|ing and &s;eeing will not be gratified by tho&s;e objects which are mo&s;t agreeable to them, and which they cannot meet with in the&s;e lower regions of nature; objects, <HI>which neither eye hath &s;een, nor ear heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive!</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. <HI>I knew a man in Chri&s;t</HI> (&s;ays St. Paul, &s;peaking of him&s;elf) <HI>above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body I cannot tell: God knoweth) &s;uch a one caught up to the third heaven. And I knew &s;uch a man (whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth) how that he was caught up into paradi&s;e, and heard un&s;peakable words, which it is not po&s;&s;ible for a man to utter.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. By this is meant that what he heard was &s;o infinitely different from any thing which he had heard in this world, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s it in &s;uch words as might convey a notion of it to his hear|ers.</P>
<P>It is very natural for us to take delight in inqui|ries concerning any foreign country, where we are &s;ome time or other to make our abode; and as we all hope to be admitted into this glorious place, it is both laudable and u&s;eful curio&s;ity, to get what infor|mation we can of it, while we make u&s;e of revelation for our guide.</P>
<P N="17">17. When the&s;e everla&s;ting doors &s;hall be opened to us, we may be &s;ure that the plea&s;ures and beauties of this place will infinitely tran&s;cend our pre&s;ent hopes and expectations, and that the glorious appearance
<PB N="204" REF="020531_0209_0FAFE237F11D5D40">
of the throne of God will ri&s;e infinitely beyond what|ever we are able to conceive of it. We might here entertain our&s;elves with many other &s;peculations on this &s;ubject, from tho&s;e &s;everal hints which we find of it in the holy &s;criptures; as whether they may not be different man&s;ions and apartments of glory, to beings of different natures; whether, as there excel one another in perfection, they are not admitted nearer to the throne of the Almighty, and enjoy greater manife&s;tations of his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P N="18">18. Whether there are not &s;olemn times and occa|&s;ions, when all the multitude of heaven celebrate the pre&s;ence of their Maker, in more extraordinary forms of prai&s;e and adoration; as <HI>Adam,</HI> though he had continued in a &s;tate of innocence, would, in the opinion of our divines, have kept holy the <HI>Sabbath-day,</HI> in a more particular manner than any other of the &s;even. The&s;e, and the like &s;peculations, we may very innocently indulge, &s;o long as we make u&s;e of them to in&s;pire us with a de&s;ire of becoming inha|bitants of this delightful place.</P>
<P N="19">19. I have in this, and in two foregoing letters, treated on the mo&s;t &s;erious &s;ubject that can employ the mind of man, the omnipre&s;ence of the Deity; a &s;ubject which, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;hould never depart from our meditations. We have con&s;idered the Divine Being, as he inhabits infinitude, as he dwells among his works, as he is pre&s;ent to the mind of man, and as he di&s;covers him&s;elf in a more glorious manner among the regions of the ble&s;t. Such a con&s;ideration &s;hould be kept awake in us at all times, and in all places, and po&s;&s;e&s;s our minds with a perpetual awe and reverence.</P>
<P N="20">20. It &s;hould be interwoven with all our thoughts and perceptions, and become one with the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of our own being. It is not to be reflected on in the coldne&s;s of philo&s;ophy, but ought to &s;ink us into the lowe&s;t pro&s;tration before him, who is &s;o a&s;toni&s;h|ingly great, wonderful, and holy.</P>

<HEAD>The pre&s;ent Life to be can&s;idered only as it may conduce to the happine&s;s of a future one.</HEAD>
<BIBL>SPECTATOR, No. 575.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. A Lewd young fellow &s;eeing an aged hermit go by him barefoot, <HI>Father,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>you are in a very mi&s;erable condition, if there is not another world. True, &s;on,</HI> &s;aid the hermit; <HI>but what is thy condition if there is?</HI> Man is a creature de&s;igned for two different &s;tates of being, or rather, for two dif|ferent lives. His fir&s;t life is &s;hort and tran&s;ient; his &s;econd permanent and la&s;ting.</P>
<P N="2">2. The que&s;tion we are all concerned in is this, in which of the&s;e two lives is our chief intere&s;t to make our&s;elves happy? or in other words, whether we &s;hould endeavour to &s;ecure to our&s;elves the plea|&s;ures and gratifications of a life which is uncertain and precarious, and at its utmo&s;t length of a very incon&s;iderable duration; or to &s;ecure to our&s;elves the plea&s;ures of a life that is fixed and &s;ettled, and will never end? Every man, upon the fir&s;t hearing of this que&s;tion, knows very well which &s;ide of it he ought to clo&s;e with.</P>
<P N="3">3. But however right we are in theory, it is plain that in practice we adhere to the wrong &s;ide of the que&s;tion. We make provi&s;ions for this life as though it were never to have an end, and for the other life as though it were never to have a beginning.</P>
<P>Should a &s;pirit of &s;uperior rank, who is a &s;tranger to human nature, accidentally alight upon the earth, and take a &s;urvey of its inhabitants, what would his notions of us be?</P>
<P N="4">4. Would not he think that we were a &s;pecies of beings made for quite different ends and purpo&s;es than what we really are? Mu&s;t not he imagine that we were placed in this world to get riches and ho|nours? Would not he think that it was our duty to
<PB N="206" REF="020531_0211_0FAFE238C337AF48">
toil after wealth, and &s;tation, and title? Nay, would not he believe we were forbidden poverty, by threats of eternal puni&s;hment, and enjoined to pur&s;ue our plea&s;ures under pain of damnation? He would certainly imagine that we were influenced by a &s;cheme of duties quite oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e which are indeed pre&s;cribed to us.</P>
<P N="5">5. And truly, according to &s;uch an imagination, he mu&s;t conclude that we are a &s;pecies of the mo&s;t o|bedient creatures in the univer&s;e; that we are con|&s;tant to our duty; and that we keep a &s;teady eye on the end for which we were &s;ent hither.</P>
<P>But how great would be his a&s;toni&s;hment, when he learnt that we were beings not de&s;igned to exi&s;t in this world above three&s;core and ten years; and that the greate&s;t part of this bu&s;y &s;pecies fall &s;hort even of that age?</P>
<P N="6">6. How would he be lo&s;t in horror and admiration, when he &s;hould know that this &s;et of creatures, who lay out all their endeavours for this life, which &s;carce de&s;erves the name of exi&s;tence, when I &s;ay, he &s;hould know that this &s;et of creatures are to exi&s;t to all eter|nity in another life, for which they make no prepa|rations?</P>
<P N="7">7. Nothing can be a greater di&s;grace to rea&s;on than that men, who are per&s;uaded of the&s;e two dif|ferent &s;tates of being, &s;hould be perpetually employ|ed in providing for a life of three&s;core and ten years, and neglecting to make provi&s;ion for that, which, after many myriads of years, will be &s;till new, and &s;till beginning; e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that our endeavours for making our&s;elves great, or rich, or honourable, or whatever el&s;e we place our happine&s;s in, may, after all, prove un&s;ucce&s;sful; whereas, if we con&s;tantly and &s;incerely endeavour to make our|&s;elves happy in the other life, we are &s;ure that our endeavours will &s;ucceed, and that we &s;hall not be di&s;|appointed of our hope.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="207" REF="020531_0212_0FAFE239846E23D8">8. The following que&s;tion is &s;tarted by one of the &s;choolmen. Suppo&s;ing the whole body of the earth were a great ball or ma&s;s of the fine&s;t &s;and, and that a &s;ingle grain or particle of this &s;and &s;hould be anni|hilated every thou&s;and years. Suppo&s;ing then that you had it in your choice to be happy all the while this prodigious ma&s;s of &s;and was con&s;uming by this &s;low method till there was not a grain of it left, on condition you were to be mi&s;erable for ever after; or &s;uppo&s;ing that you might be happy for ever after, on condition you would be mi&s;erable till the whole ma&s;s of &s;and were thus annihilated at the rate of one &s;and in a thou&s;and years: which of the&s;e two ca&s;es would you make your choice?</P>
<P N="9">9. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed in this ca&s;e, &s;o many thou|&s;ands of years are to the imagination as a kind of eternity, though in reality they do not bear &s;o great a proportion to that duration which is to follow them, as an unit does to the greate&s;t number which you can put together in figures, or as one of tho&s;e &s;ands to the &s;uppo&s;ed heap. Rea&s;on therefore tells us, without any manner of he&s;itation, which would be the better part in this choice.</P>
<P N="10">10. However, as I have before intimated, our rea&s;on might in &s;uch a ca&s;e be &s;o over&s;et by the ima|gination, as to di&s;po&s;e &s;ome per&s;ons to &s;ink under the con&s;ideration of the great length of the fir&s;t part of this duration, and of the great di&s;tance of that &s;e|cond duration, which is to &s;ucceed it. The mind, I &s;ay, might give it&s;elf up to that happine&s;s which is at hand, con&s;idering that it is &s;o very near and that it would la&s;t &s;o very long.</P>
<P N="11">11. But when the choice we actually have before us, is this, whether we will chu&s;e to be happy for the &s;pace of only three&s;core and ten, nay, perhaps of only twenty or ten years; I might &s;ay of only a day or an hour, and mi&s;erable to all eternity; or, on the contrary, mi&s;erable for this &s;hort term of years, and happy for a whole eternity; what words are &s;uffici|ent
<PB N="208" REF="020531_0213_0FAFE23A422CD6C8">
to expre&s;s that folly and want of con&s;ideration which in &s;uch a ca&s;e makes a wrong choice?</P>
<P N="12">12. I hear put the ca&s;e even at the wor&s;t, by &s;up|po&s;ing (what &s;eldom happens) that a cour&s;e of virtue makes us mi&s;erable in this life: but if we &s;uppo&s;e (as it generally happens) that virtue will make us more happy even in this life than a contrary cour&s;e of vice; how can we &s;ufficiently admire the &s;tupidity or madne&s;s of tho&s;e per&s;ons who are capable of ma|king &s;o ab&s;urd a choice?</P>
<P N="13">13. Every wi&s;e man, therefore, will con&s;ider this life only as it may conduce to the happine&s;s of the other, and chearfully &s;acrifice the plea&s;ures of a few years to tho&s;e of an eternity.</P>

<HEAD>On the Immortality of the Soul.</HEAD>
<BIBL>SPECTATOR, No. 111.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. I WAS ye&s;terday walking alone in one of my friend's woods, and lo&s;t my&s;elf in it very agree|ably, as I was running over in my mind the &s;everal arguments that e&s;tabli&s;h this great point, which is the ba&s;is of morality, and the &s;ource of all the plea|&s;ing hopes and &s;ecret joys that can ari&s;e in the heart of a rea&s;onable creature.</P>
<P N="2">2. I con&s;idered tho&s;e &s;everal proofs drawn, Fir&s;t, from the nature of the &s;oul it&s;elf, and particularly its immateriality; which, though not ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the eternity of its duration, has, I think, been evinced to almo&s;t a demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>Secondly, from its pa&s;&s;ions and &s;entiments, as par|ticularly from its love of exi&s;tence, its horror of an|nihilation, and its hopes of immortality, with that &s;ecret &s;atisfaction which it finds in the practice of virtue, and that unea&s;ine&s;s which follows in it upon the commi&s;&s;ion of vice.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="209" REF="020531_0214_0FAFE23B02231A98">3. Thirdly, from the nature of the Supreme Being, who&s;e ju&s;tice, goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom and veracity, are all concerned in this point.</P>
<P>But among the&s;e and other excellent arguments for the immortality of the &s;oul, there is one drawn from the perpetual progre&s;s of the &s;oul to its perfecti|on, without a po&s;&s;ibility of ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not remember to have &s;een opened and improved by others who have written on this &s;ubject, though it &s;eems to me to carry a very great weight with it.</P>
<P N="4">4. How can it enter into the thoughts of man, that the &s;oul which is capable of &s;uch immen&s;e per|fections, and of receiving new improvements to all eternity, &s;hall fall away into nothing almo&s;t as &s;oon as it is created? are &s;uch abilities made for no pur|po&s;e? A brute arrives at a point of perfection that he can never pa&s;s: in a few years he has all the endow|ments he is capable of; and were he to live ten thou|&s;and more, would be the &s;ame thing he is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="5">5. Were a human &s;oul thus at a &s;tand in her ac|compli&s;hments, were her faculties to be full blown, and incapable of farther enlargements, I could ima|gine it might fall away in&s;en&s;ibly, and drop at once into a &s;tate of annihilation.</P>
<P N="6">6. But can we believe a thinking being that is in a perpetual progre&s;s of improvements, and travelling on from perfection to perfection, after having ju&s;t looked abroad into the works of its Creator, and made a few di&s;coveries of his infinite goodne&s;s, wi&s;|dom, and power, mu&s;t peri&s;h at her fir&s;t &s;etting out, and in the very beginning of her enquiries?</P>
<P>A man con&s;idered in his pre&s;ent &s;tate &s;eems only &s;ent into the world to propagate his kind. He pro|vides him&s;elf with a &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and immediately quits his po&s;t to make room for him.</P>

<P N="7">7. He does not &s;eem born to enjoy life, but to de|liver it down to others. This is not &s;urpri&s;ing to con&s;ider in animals, which are formed for our u&s;e, and can fini&s;h their bu&s;ine&s;s in a &s;hort life. The &s;ilk|worm, after having &s;pun her ta&s;k, lays her eggs, and dies. But a man can never have taken in his full mea&s;ure of knowledge, has not time to &s;ubdue his pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;tabli&s;h his &s;oul in virtue, and come up to the perfection of his nature, before he is hurried off the &s;tage.</P>
<P N="8">8. Would an infinitely wi&s;e Being make &s;uch glo|rious creatures for &s;o mean a purpo&s;e? can he delight in the production of &s;uch abortive intelligences, &s;uch &s;hort-lived rea&s;onable beings? would he give us ta|lents that are not to be exerted? capacities that are never to be gratified? How can we find that wi&s;|dom which &s;hines through all his works, in the form|ation of man, without looking on this world as only a nur&s;ery for the next, and believing that the &s;everal generations of rational creatures, which ri&s;e up and di&s;appear in &s;uch quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only to re|ceive their fir&s;t rudiments of exi&s;tence here, and af|terwards to be tran&s;planted into a more friendly climate, where they may &s;pread and flouri&s;h to all eternity?</P>
<P N="9">9. There is not, in my opinion, a more plea&s;ing and triumphant con&s;ideration in religion than this of the perpetual progre&s;s which the &s;oul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever arriving at a period in it. To look upon the &s;oul as going on from &s;trength to &s;trength, to con&s;ider that &s;he is to &s;hine forever with new acce&s;&s;ions of glory, and bright|en to all eternity; that &s;he will be &s;till adding vir|tue to virtue, and knowledge to knowledge; carries in it &s;omething wonderfully agreeable to that ambi|tion which is natural to the mind of man. Nay, it mu&s;t be a pro&s;pect plea&s;ing to God him&s;elf, to &s;ee his
<PB N="211" REF="020531_0216_0FAFE23C888770F0">
creation forever beautifying his eyes, and drawing nearer to him, by greater degrees of re&s;emblance.</P>
<P N="10">10. Methinks this &s;ingle con&s;ideration, of the pro|gre&s;s of a finite &s;pirit to perfection, will be &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h all envy in inferior natures, and all contempt in &s;uperior. That cherubim, which now appears as a God to a human &s;oul, knows very well that the period will come about in eternity, when the human &s;oul &s;hall be as perfect as he him&s;elf now is: nay, when &s;he &s;hall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as &s;he now falls &s;hort of it. It is true, the higher nature &s;till advances, and by that means pre&s;erves his di&s;tance and &s;uperiority in the &s;cale of being; but he knows that, how high &s;oever the &s;tation is of which he &s;tands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at pre&s;ent, the inferior nature will at length mount up to it, and &s;hine forth in the &s;ame degree of glory.</P>
<P N="11">11. With what a&s;toni&s;hment and veneration may we look into our own &s;oul, where there are &s;uch hid|den &s;tores of virtue and knowledge, &s;uch inexhau&s;ted &s;ources of perfection! We know not yet what we &s;hall be, nor will it ever enter into the heart of man to con|ceive the glory that will be always in re&s;erve for him. The &s;oul con&s;idered with its Creator, is like one of tho&s;e mathematical lines that may draw nearer to another for all eternity, without a po&s;&s;ibility of touching it: and can there be a thought &s;o tran&s;port|ing, as to con&s;ider our&s;elves in the&s;e perpetual ap|proaches to him, who is not only the &s;tandard of per|fection, but of happine&s;s!</P>

<P N="1">1. THOUGH there is a great deal of plea&s;ure in contemplating the material world, by which I mean that &s;y&s;tem of bodies into which nature has &s;o
<PB N="212" REF="020531_0217_0FAFE23D45E31098">
curiou&s;ly wrought the ma&s;s of dead matter, with the &s;everal relations which tho&s;e bodies bear to one ano|ther; there is &s;till, methinks, &s;omething more won|derful and &s;urpri&s;ing in contemplations on the world of life, by which I mean all tho&s;e animals with which every part of the univer&s;e is furni&s;hed. The materi|al world is only the &s;hell of the univer&s;e: the world of life are its inhabitants.</P>
<P N="2">2. If we con&s;ider tho&s;e parts of the material world which lie the neare&s;t to us, and are therefore &s;ubject to our ob&s;ervations and enquiries, it is amazing to con&s;ider the infinity of animals with which it is &s;tock|ed. Every part of matter is peopled: every green leaf &s;warms with inhabitants. There is &s;carce a &s;in|gle humour in the body of a man, or of any other animal, in which our gla&s;&s;es do not di&s;cover myriads of living creatures.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;urface of animals is al&s;o covered with o|ther animals, which are in the &s;ame manner the ba&s;is of other animals that live upon it; nay, we find in the mo&s;t &s;olid bodies, as in marble it&s;elf, innumer|able cells and cavities, that are crowded with &s;uch imperceptible inhabitants, as are too little for the naked eye to di&s;cover. On the other hand, if we look into the more bulky parts of nature, we &s;ee the &s;eas, lakes, and rivers, teeming with numberle&s;s kinds of living creatures; we find every mountain and mar&s;h, wilderne&s;s and wood, plentifully &s;tocked with birds and bea&s;ts, and every part of matter af|fording proper nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies for the livelihood of multitudes which inhabit it.</P>
<P N="4">4. The author of the <HI>Plurality of Worlds</HI> draws a very good argument from this con&s;ideration, for the <HI>peopling</HI> of every planet; as indeed it &s;eems very probable from the analogy of rea&s;on, that if no part of matter, which we are acquainted with, lies wa&s;te and u&s;ele&s;s, tho&s;e great bodies, which are at &s;uch a di&s;tance from us, &s;hould not be de&s;ert and unpeo|pled,
<PB N="213" REF="020531_0218_0FAFE23E0279D9A0">
but rather that they &s;hould be furni&s;hed with beings adapted to their re&s;pective &s;ituation.</P>
<P N="5">5. Exi&s;tence is a ble&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e beings only which are endowed with perception, and is in a manner thrown away upon dead matter, any farther than as it is &s;ub&s;ervient to beings which are con&s;cious of their exi&s;tence. Accordingly we find, from the bodies which lie under our ob&s;ervation, that matter is only made as the ba&s;is and &s;upport of animals, and that there is no more of the one, than what is nece&s;&s;ary for the exi&s;tence of the other.</P>
<P N="6">6. Infinite goodne&s;s is of &s;o communicative a na|ture, that it &s;eems to delight in the conferring of exi&s;tence upon every degree of perceptive being. As this is a &s;peculation, which I have often pur&s;ued with great plea&s;ure to my&s;elf, I &s;hall enlarge further up|on it, by con&s;idering that part of the &s;cale of beings which comes within our knowledge.</P>
<P N="7">7. There are &s;ome living creatures which are rai&s;|ed but ju&s;t above dead matter. To mention only that &s;pecies of &s;hell-fi&s;h, which are formed in the fa&s;hion of a cone, that grow to the &s;urface of &s;everal rocks, and immediately die upon their being &s;evered from the place where they grow; there are many other creatures but one remove from the&s;e, which have no other &s;en&s;e be&s;ides that of feeling and ta&s;te. Others have &s;till an additional one of hearing; others of &s;mell; and others of &s;ight.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is wonderful to ob&s;erve, by what a gradual progre&s;s the world of life advances through a prodi|gious variety of &s;pecies, before a creature is formed that is complete in all its &s;en&s;es; and even among the&s;e there is &s;uch a different degree of perfection in the &s;en&s;e which one animal enjoys beyond what ap|pears in another, though the &s;en&s;e in different ani|mals be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame common denomi|nation, it &s;eems almo&s;t of a different nature.</P>
<P N="9">9. If after this we look into the &s;everal perfections of cunning and &s;agacity, or what we generally call
<PB N="214" REF="020531_0219_0FAFE23EC17B8440">
in&s;tinct, we find them ri&s;ing after the &s;ame manner imperceptibly one above another, and receiving ad|ditional improvements, according to the &s;pecies in which they are implanted. This progre&s;s in nature is &s;o very gradual, that the mo&s;t perfect of an infe|rior &s;pecies comes very near to the mo&s;t imperfect of that which is immediately above it.</P>
<P N="10">10. The exuberant and overflowing goodne&s;s of the Supreme Being, who&s;e mercy extends to all his works, is plainly &s;een, as I have before hinted, from his having made &s;o very little matter, at lea&s;t what falls within our knowledge, that does not &s;warm with life: nor is his goodne&s;s le&s;s &s;een in the diver&s;ity, than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he only made one &s;pecies of animals, none of the re&s;t would have enjoyed the happine&s;s of exi&s;tence; he has therefore <HI>&s;pecified</HI> in his creation every degree of life, every capacity of being.</P>
<P N="11">11. The whole cha&s;m of nature, from a plant to a man, is filled up with divers kinds of creatures, ri|&s;ing one over another, by &s;uch a gentle and ea&s;y a&s;|cent, that the little tran&s;itions and deviations from one &s;pecies to another are almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible. This intermediate &s;pace is &s;o well hu&s;banded and managed, that there is &s;carce a degree of perception which does not appear in &s;ome one part of the world of life. Is the goodne&s;s, or wi&s;dom of the Divine Being, more manife&s;ted in this his proceeding?</P>
<P N="12">12. There is a con&s;equence, be&s;ides tho&s;e I have already mentioned, which &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very naturally de|ducible from the foregoing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iderations.

<BIBL>SPECTATOR, No. 120.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. I MUST confe&s;s I am infinitely delighted with tho&s;e &s;peculations of nature which are to be made in a country-life; and as my reading has very much lain among books of natural hi&s;tory, I cannot forbear recollecting, upon this occa&s;ion, the &s;everal remarks which I have met with in authors, and comparing them with what falls under my own ob&s;ervation; the arguments for Providence drawn from the natural hi|&s;tory of animals being, in my opinion, demon&s;tra|tive.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="217" REF="020531_0222_0FAFE242D1B4EDB0">2. The make of every kind of animal is different from that of every other kind; and there is not the lea&s;t turn in the mu&s;cles or twi&s;t in the fibres of any one, which does not render them more proper for that particular animal's way of life than any other ca&s;t or texture of them would have been.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t violent appetites in all creatures are <HI>lu&s;t</HI> and <HI>hunger:</HI> the fir&s;t is a perpetual call upon them to propagate their kind; the latter to pre&s;erve them|&s;elves.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is a&s;toni&s;hing to con&s;ider the different degrees of care that de&s;cend from the parent to the young, &s;o far as is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the leaving a po&s;te|rity. Some creatures ca&s;t their eggs as chance di|rects them, and think of them no farther, as in&s;ects and &s;everal kinds of fi&s;h; others, of a nicer frame, find out proper beds to depo&s;it them in, and there leave them; as the &s;erpent, the crocodile, and o&s;trich; others hatch their eggs and tend the birth, till it is able to &s;hift for it&s;elf.</P>
<P>What can we call the principle which directs every different kind of bird to ob&s;erve a particular plan in the &s;tructure of its ne&s;t, and directs all of the &s;ame &s;pecies to work after the &s;ame model? It cannot be <HI>imitation</HI>; for though you hatch a crow under a hen, and never let it &s;ee any of the works of its own kind, the ne&s;t it makes &s;hall be the &s;ame, to the laying of a &s;tick, with all the other ne&s;ts of the &s;ame &s;pecies. It cannot be <HI>rea&s;on</HI>; for were animals endued with it to as great a degree as man, their buildings would be as different as ours, according to the different conve|niencies that they would propo&s;e to them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="5">5. Is it not remarkable, that the &s;ame temper of weather, which rai&s;es this general warmth in ani|mals, &s;hould cover the trees with leaves, and the fields with gra&s;s, for their &s;ecurity and concealment, and produce &s;uch infinite &s;warms of in&s;ects for the &s;upport and &s;u&s;tenance of their re&s;pective broods?</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="020531_0223_0FAFE243A0ADFF50">Is it not wonderful that the love of the parent &s;hould be &s;o violent while it la&s;ts, and that it &s;hould la&s;t no longer than is nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the young?</P>
<P N="6">6. With what caution does the hen provide her&s;elf a ne&s;t in places unfrequented, and free from noi&s;e and di&s;turbance? When &s;he has laid her eggs in &s;uch a manner that &s;he can cover them, what care does &s;he take in turning them frequently, that all parts may partake of the vital warmth? When &s;he leaves them, to provide for her nece&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;tenance, how punctu|ally does &s;he return before they have time to cool, and become incapable of producing an animal? In the &s;ummer, you &s;ee her giving her&s;elf greater free|doms, and quitting her care for above two hours to|gether; but in winter, when the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on would chill the principles of life, and de&s;troy the young one, &s;he grows more a&s;&s;iduous in her atten|dance, and &s;tays away but half the time.</P>
<P N="7">7. When the birth approaches, with how much nicety and attention does &s;he help the chick to break its pri&s;on? Not to take notice of her covering it from the injuries of the weather, providing it proper nou|ri&s;hment, and teaching it to help it&s;elf; nor to men|tion her for&s;aking the ne&s;t, if after the u&s;ual time of reckoning the young one does not make its appear|ance. A chymical operation could not be followed with greater art or diligence, than is &s;een in the hatching of a chick; though there are many other birds that &s;hew an infinitely greater &s;agacity in all the fore-mentioned particulars.</P>
<P N="8">8. But at the &s;ame time the hen, that has all this &s;eeming ingenuity (which is indeed ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for the propagation of the &s;pecies) con&s;idered in other re&s;pects, is without the lea&s;t glimmerings of thought or common &s;en&s;e. She mi&s;takes a piece of chalk for an egg, and &s;its upon it in the &s;ame man|ner: &s;he is in&s;en&s;ible of any increa&s;e or diminution in the number of tho&s;e &s;he lays: &s;he does not di&s;tingui&s;h

<HEAD>Good Breeding.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. COmplai&s;ance renders a &s;uperior amiable, an equal agreeable, and an inferior acceptable. It &s;mooths di&s;tinction, &s;weetens conver&s;ation, and makes every one in the company plea&s;ed with him|&s;elf. It produces good nature and mutual benevo|lence, encourages the timorous, &s;oothes the turbu|lent, humanizes the fierce, and di&s;tingui&s;hes a &s;oci|ety of civilized per&s;ons from a confu&s;ion of &s;avages. In a word, complai&s;ance is a virtue that blends all orders of men together in a friendly intercour&s;e of words and actions, and is &s;uited to that equality in human nature which every one ought to con&s;ider, &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the order and oeconomy of the world.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="220" REF="020531_0225_0FAFE244CC0C07B8">2. If we could look into the &s;ecret angui&s;h and af|fliction of every man's heart, we &s;hould often find, that more of it ari&s;es from little imaginary di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;uch as checks, frowns, contradictions, expre&s;&s;ions of contempt, and (what <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> reckons among other evils under the &s;un)

<L>"The in&s;olence of office, and the &s;purns</L>

than from the more real pains and calamities of life. The only method to remove the&s;e imaginary di&s;tre&s;&s;es as much as po&s;&s;ible out of human life, would be the univer&s;al practice of &s;uch an ingenious complai&s;ance as I have been here de&s;cribing, which, as it is a vir|tue, may be defined to be a
<Q>con&s;tant endeavour to plea&s;e tho&s;e whom we conver&s;e with, &s;o far as we may do it innocently.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. Good-breeding nece&s;&s;arily implies civility; but civility does not reciprocally imply good-breed|ing. The former has its intrin&s;ic weight and value, which the latter always adorns, and often doubles by its workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>To &s;acrifice one's own &s;elf-love to other people's, is a &s;hort, but I believe, a true definition of civi|lity: to do it with ea&s;e, propriety and grace, is good-breeding. The one is the re&s;ult of good-nature; the other of good &s;en&s;e, joined to experience, ob|&s;ervation, and attention.</P>
<P N="4">4. A ploughman will be civil, if he is good natur|ed, but cannot be well bred. A courtier will be well-bred, though perhaps without good-nature, if he has but good &s;en&s;e. Flattery is the di&s;grace of good-breeding, as brutality often is of truth and &s;incerity. Good-breeding is the middle point between tho&s;e two odious extremes. Ceremony is the &s;uper&s;tition of good-breeding, as well as of religion: but yet, being an out-work to both, &s;hould not be ab&s;olutely demo|li&s;hed. It is always, to a certain degree, to be com|plied
<PB N="221" REF="020531_0226_0FAFE2458AED35F0">
with, though de&s;pi&s;ed by tho&s;e who think, be|cau&s;e admired and re&s;pected by tho&s;e who do not.</P>
<P N="5">5. The mo&s;t perfect degree of good-breeding, as I have already hinted, is only to be acquired by great knowledge of the world, and keeping the be&s;t com|pany. It is not the object of mere &s;peculation, and cannot be exactly defined, as it con&s;i&s;ts in a fitne&s;s, a propriety of words, actions, and even looks, adapt|ed to the infinite variety and combinations of per&s;ons, places, and things. It is a mode, not a &s;ub&s;tance; for what is good-breeding at St. <HI>James</HI>'s would pa&s;s for foppery or banter in a remote village; and the home&s;pun civility of that village would be con&s;idered as brutality at court.</P>
<P N="6">6. A cloi&s;tered pedant may form true notions of civility; but if amid&s;t the cobwebs of his cell he pre|tends to &s;pin a &s;peculative &s;y&s;tem of good-breeding, he will not be le&s;s ab&s;urd than his predece&s;&s;or, who judiciou&s;ly undertook to in&s;truct <HI>Hannibal</HI> in the art of war. The mo&s;t ridiculous and mo&s;t aukward of men are, therefore, the &s;peculatively well-bred monks of all religions and all profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P N="7">7. Good-breeding, like charity, not only covers a multitude of faults, but, to a certain degree, &s;upplies the want of &s;ome virtues. In the common intercour&s;e of life, it acts good-nature, and often does what good-nature will not always do; it keeps both wits and fools within tho&s;e bounds of decency, which the former are too apt to tran&s;gre&s;s, and which the latter never know. Courts are unque&s;tionably the &s;eats of good-breeding, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;o; otherwi&s;e they would be the &s;eats of violence and de&s;olation. There all the pa&s;&s;ions are in their highe&s;t &s;tate of fer|mentation.</P>
<P N="8">8. All pur&s;ue what but few can obtain, and many &s;eek what but one can enjoy. Good-breeding alone re&s;trains their exce&s;&s;es. There, if enemies did not embrace they would &s;tab. There, &s;miles are often put on to conceal tears. There, mutual &s;ervices are

profe&s;&s;ed, while mutual injuries are intended; and there, the guile of the &s;erpent &s;imulates the gentle|ne&s;s of the dove: all this, it is true, at the expence of &s;incerity; but upon the whole, to the advantage of &s;ocial intercour&s;e in general.</P>
<P N="9">9. I would not be mi&s;apprehended, and &s;uppo&s;ed to recommend good-breeding, thus prophaned and pro&s;tituted to the purpo&s;es of guilt and perfidy; but I think I may ju&s;tly infer from it, to what a degree the accompli&s;hment of good-breeding mu&s;t adorn and inforce virtue and truth, when it can thus &s;often the outrages and deformity of vice and fal&s;hood. I am &s;orry to be obliged to confe&s;s, that my native coun|try is not perhaps the &s;eat of the mo&s;t perfect good-breeding, though I really believe, that it yields to none in hearty and &s;incere civility, as far as civility is (and to a certain degree it is) an inferior moral duty of doing as one would be done by.</P>
<P N="10">10. If <HI>France</HI> exceeds us in that particular, the incomparable author of <HI>L' E&s;prit des Loix</HI> accounts for it very impartially, and I believe very truly.
<Q>If my countrymen, &s;ays he, are the be&s;t bred people in the world, it is only becau&s;e they are the vain|e&s;t.</Q>
It is certain that their good-breeding and attention, by flattering the vanity and &s;elf-love of others, repay their own with intere&s;t. It is a gene|ral commerce, u&s;efully carried on by a barter of at|tentions, and often without one grain of &s;olid merit, by way of medium, to make up the balance.</P>
<P N="11">11. It were to be wi&s;hed that good-breeding were in general thought a more e&s;&s;ential part of the edu|cation of our youth, e&s;pecially of di&s;tinction, than at pre&s;ent it &s;eems to be. It might even be &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of &s;ome academical &s;tudies, that take up a great deal of time to very little purpo&s;e; or, at lea&s;t, it might u&s;efully &s;hare &s;ome of tho&s;e many hours, that are &s;o frequently employed upon a coach-box, or in &s;tables. Surely tho&s;e, who by their rank and fortune are called to adorn courts, ought at lea&s;t not to di&s;grace them by their manners.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="223" REF="020531_0228_0FAFE24708CD72D0">12. But I ob&s;erve with concern, that it is the fa|&s;hion for our youth of both &s;exes to brand good-breeding with the name of ceremony and formality. As &s;uch, they ridicule and explode it, and adopt i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its &s;tead, an offen&s;ive carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and inattention, to the diminution, I will venture to &s;ay, even of their own plea&s;ures, if they know what true plea&s;ures are. Love and friend&s;hip nece&s;&s;arily produce&punc; and ju&s;tly authorize familiarity; but then good-breeding mu&s;t mark out its bounds, and &s;ay, thus far &s;halt thou go, and no farther: for I have known many a pa&s;&s;ion and many a friend&s;hip, degraded, weakened, and at la&s;t (if I may u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion) wholly flattened away, by an unguarded and illiberal familiarity.</P>
<P N="13">13. Nor is good-breeding le&s;s the ornament and cement of common &s;ocial life: it connects, it en|dears, and at the &s;ame time that it indulges the ju&s;t liberty, re&s;trains that indecent licentiou&s;ne&s;s of con|ver&s;ation, which alienates and provokes. Great ta|lents make a man famous, great merit makes him re&s;pected, and great learning makes him e&s;teemed; but good-breeding alone can make him beloved.</P>
<P N="14">14. I recommend it in a more particular manner to my country-women, as the greate&s;t ornament to &s;uch of them as have beauty, and the &s;afe&s;t refuge for tho&s;e who have not. It facilitates the victories, de|corates the triumphs, and &s;ecures the conque&s;ts of beauty; or in &s;ome degree atones for the want of it. It almo&s;t deifies a fine woman, and procures re&s;pect at lea&s;t to tho&s;e who have not charms enough to be admired. Upon the whole, though good-breeding cannot, &s;trictly &s;peaking, be called a virtue, yet it is productive of &s;o many good effects, that in my opi|nion it may be ju&s;tly reckoned more than a mere ac|compli&s;hment.</P>

<P>Good-breeding alone can prepo&s;&s;e&s;s people in our favour at fir&s;t &s;ight; more time being nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;cover greater talents. Good-breeding, however, does not con&s;i&s;t in low bows, and formal ceremony; but in an ea&s;y, civil, and re&s;pectful behaviour.</P>
<P N="16">16. Indeed, good-&s;en&s;e, in many ca&s;es, mu&s;t de|termine good-breeding; for what would be civil at one time, and to one per&s;on, would be rude at ano|ther time, and to another per&s;on: there are, howe|ver, &s;ome general rules of good-breeding. As for example: to an&s;wer only yes, or no, to any per&s;on, without adding &s;ir, my lord, or madam, (as it may happen) is always extremely rude; and it is equally &s;o not to give proper attention and a civil an&s;wer, when &s;poken to: &s;uch behaviour convinces the per&s;on who is &s;peaking to us, that we de&s;pi&s;e him, and do not think him worthy of our attention, or an&s;wer.</P>
<P N="17">17. A well-bred per&s;on will take care to an&s;wer with complai&s;ance when he is &s;poken to; will place him&s;elf at the lower end of the table, unle&s;s bid to go higher; will fir&s;t drink to the lady of the hou&s;e, and then to the ma&s;ter; he will not eat aukwardly or dirtily, nor &s;it when others &s;tand; and he will do all this with an air of complai&s;ance, and not with a grave ill-natured look, as if he did it all unwillingly.</P>
<P N="18">18. There is nothing more difficult to attain, or &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s, as perfect good-breeding; which is equally incon&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tiff formality, an im|pertinent forwardne&s;s, and an aukward ba&s;hfulne&s;s. A little ceremony is &s;ometime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nece&s;&s;ary; a certain
<PB N="225" REF="020531_0230_0FAFE248880CBAE0">
degree of firmne&s;s is ab&s;olutely &s;o; and an outward mode&s;ty is extremely becoming.</P>
<P N="19">19. Virtue and learning, like gold, have their in|trin&s;ic value; but, if they are not poli&s;hed, they cer|tainly lo&s;e a great deal of their lu&s;tre: and even po|li&s;hed bra&s;s will pa&s;s upon more people than rough gold. What a number of &s;ins does the chearful, ea&s;y, good-breeding of the French frequently cover!</P>
<P>My Lord Bacon &s;ays,
<Q>that a plea&s;ing figure is a perpetual letter of recommendation.</Q>
It is cer|tainly an agreeable fore-runner of merit, and &s;mooths the way for it.</P>
<P N="20">20. A man of good-breeding &s;hould be acquainted with the forms and particular cu&s;toms of courts. At Vienna, men always make courte&s;ies, in&s;tead of bows, to the Emperor; in France, nobody bows to the King, or ki&s;&s;es his hand; but in Spain and Eng|land, bows are made, and hands are ki&s;&s;ed. Thus every court has &s;ome peculiarity, which tho&s;e who vi&s;it them ought previou&s;ly to inform them&s;elves of, to avoid blunders and aukwardne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="21">21. Very few, &s;carcely any, are wanting in the re&s;pect which they &s;hould &s;hew to tho&s;e whom they acknowledge to be infinitely their &s;uperiors. The man of fa&s;hion, and of the world, expre&s;&s;es it in its fulle&s;t extent; but naturally, ea&s;ily, and without concern: whereas a man, who is not u&s;ed to keep good company, expre&s;&s;es it aukwardly; one &s;ees that he is not u&s;ed to it, and that it co&s;ts him a great deal: but I never &s;aw the wor&s;t-bred man living, guilty of lolling, whi&s;tling, &s;cratching his head, and &s;uch like indecencies, in company that he re&s;pected. In &s;uch companies, therefore, the only point to be at|tended to is, to &s;hew that re&s;pect, which every body means to &s;hew, in an ea&s;y, unembarra&s;&s;ed, and grace|ful manner.</P>
<P N="22">22. In mixed companies, whoever is admitted to make part of them, is, for the time at lea&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ed to be upon a footing of equality with the re&s;t; and
<PB N="226" REF="020531_0231_0FAFE2494998ECA8">
con&s;equently, every one claims, and very ju&s;tly, eve|ry mark of civility and good-breeding. Ea&s;e is al|lowed, but carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and negligence are &s;trictly forbidden. If a man acco&s;ts you, and talks to you ever &s;o dully or frivolou&s;ly; it is wor&s;e than rudene&s;s, it is brutality, to &s;hew him, by a manife&s;t inatten|tion to what he &s;ays, that you think him a fool or a blockhead, and not worth hearing.</P>
<P N="23">23. It is much more &s;o with regard to women; who, of whatever rank they are, are intitled, in con|&s;ideration of their &s;ex, not only to an attentive, but an officious good-breeding from men. Their little wants, likings, di&s;likes, preferences, antipathies, fancies, whims, and even impertinences, mu&s;t be officiou&s;ly attended to, flattered, and, if po&s;&s;ible, gue&s;&s;ed at and anticipated, by a well-bred man. You mu&s;t never u&s;urp to your&s;elf tho&s;e conveniencies and <HI>agr&eacute;mens</HI> which are of common right; &s;uch as the be&s;t places, the be&s;t di&s;hes, &amp;c. but, on the con|trary, always decline them your&s;elf, and offer them to others; who, in their turns, will offer them to you: &s;o that, upon the whole, you will, in your turn, enjoy your &s;hare of common right.</P>
<P N="24">24. The third &s;ort of good-breeding is local, and is variou&s;ly modified, in not only different countries, but in different towns of the &s;ame country. But it mu&s;t be &s;ounded upon the two former &s;orts; they are the matter; to which, in this ca&s;e, fa&s;hion and cu&s;|tom only give the different &s;hapes and impre&s;&s;ions. Whoever has the two fir&s;t &s;orts, will ea&s;ily acquire this third &s;ort of good-breeding, which depends &s;ing|ly upon attention and ob&s;ervation. It is properly the poli&s;h, the lu&s;tre, the la&s;t fini&s;hing &s;trokes of good-breeding. A man of &s;en&s;e, therefore, carefully at|tends to the local manners of the re&s;pective places where he is, and takes for his models tho&s;e per&s;ons whom he ob&s;erves to be at the head of the fa&s;hion and good-breeding.</P>
<P N="25">25. He watches how they addre&s;s them&s;elves to their &s;uperiors, how they acco&s;t their equals, and how
<PB N="227" REF="020531_0232_0FAFE24A080C3610">
they treat their inferiors; and lets none of tho&s;e lit|tle niceties e&s;cape him; which are to good-breeding, what the la&s;t delicate and ma&s;terly touches are to a good picture; and which the vulgar have no notion of, but by which good judges di&s;tingui&s;h the ma&s;ter. He attends even to their airs, dre&s;s, and motions, and imitates them liberally, and not &s;ervilely; he copies, but does not mimic. The&s;e per&s;onal graces are of very great con&s;equence. They anticipate the &s;entiments, before merit can engage the under&s;tand|ing; they captivate the heart, and give ri&s;e, I be|lieve, to the extravagant notions of charms and phil|tres. Their effects were &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, that they were reckoned &s;upernatural.</P>
<P N="26">26. In &s;hort, as it is nece&s;&s;ary to po&s;&s;e&s;s learning, honour, and virtue, to gain the e&s;teem and admira|tion of mankind, &s;o politene&s;s and good-breeding are equally nece&s;&s;ary to render us agreeable in conver&s;a|tion and common life. Great talents are above the generality of the world; who neither po&s;&s;e&s;s them them&s;elves, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are competent judges of them in o|thers: but all are judges of the le&s;&s;er talents, &s;uch as civility, affability, and an agreeable addre&s;s and manner; becau&s;e they feel the good effects of them, as making &s;ociety ea&s;y and agreeable.</P>
<P>To conclude: be a&s;&s;ured that the profounde&s;t learn|ing, without good-breeding, is unwelcome and tire|&s;ome pedantry; that a man who is not perfectly well-bred, is unfit for company, and unwelcome in it; and that a man, who is not well-bred, is full as unfit for bu&s;ine&s;s as for company.</P>
<P>Make, then, good-breeding the great object of your thoughts and actions. Ob&s;erve carefully the behaviour and manners of tho&s;e who are di&s;tingui&s;h|ed by their good-breeding; imitate, nay, endeavour to excel, that you may at lea&s;t reach them; and be convinced that good-breeding is to all worldly qua|lifications, what charity is to all chri&s;tian virtues. Ob&s;erve how it adorns merit, and how often it covers the want of it.</P>

<HEAD>Genteel Carriage.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. NEXT to good-breeding is a genteel manner and carriage, wholly free from tho&s;e ill ha|bits and aukward actions, which many very worthy per&s;ons are addicted to.</P>
<P N="2">2. A genteel manner of behaviour, how trifling &s;oever it may &s;eem, is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence in private life. Men of very inferior parts have been e&s;teemed, merely for their genteel carriage and good-breeding, while &s;en&s;ible men have given di&s;gu&s;t for want of it. There is &s;omething or other that pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es us at fir&s;t &s;ight in favour of a well bred man, and makes us wi&s;h to like him.</P>
<P N="3">3. When an aukward fellow fir&s;t comes into a room, he attempts to bow, and his &s;word, if he wears one, gets between his legs, and nearly throws him down. Confu&s;ed and a&s;hamed, he &s;tumbles to the upper end of the room and &s;eats him&s;elf in the very chair he &s;hould not. He there begins playing with his hat, which he pre&s;ently drops; and recover|ing his hat, he lets fall his cane; and in picking up his cane, down goes hat again: thus 'tis a con&s;ider|able time before he is adju&s;ted.</P>
<P N="4">4. When his tea or coffee is handed to him, he &s;preads his handkerchief upon his knee, &s;calds his mouth, drops either the cup or the &s;aucer, and &s;pills the tea or coffee in his lap. At dinner he is more un|commonly aukward: there he tucks his napkin through a button-hole, which tickles his chin, and occa&s;ions him to make a variety of wry faces; he &s;eats him&s;elf upon the edge of the chair, at &s;o great a di|&s;tance from the table, that he frequently drops his meat between his plate and his mouth; he holds his knife, fork and &s;poon different from other people; eats with his knife, to the manife&s;t danger of his mouth; picks his teeth with his fork, rakes his mouth with his finger, and puts his &s;poon which has been in his throat a dozen times into the di&s;h again.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="229" REF="020531_0234_0FAFE24B831FD9B8">5. If he is to carve he cannot hit the joint, but in labouring to cut through the bone, &s;pla&s;hes the &s;auce over every body's cloaths. He generally daubs him|&s;elf all over, his elbows are in the next per&s;on's plate, and he is up to the knuckles in &s;oup and grea&s;e. If he drinks, it is with his mouth full, interrupting the whole company with "to your good health, Sir," and "my &s;ervice to you;" perhaps coughs in his gla&s;s, and be&s;prinkles the whole table. Further, he has perhaps a number of di&s;agreeable tricks, he &s;nuffs up his no&s;e, picks it with his fingers, blows it, and looks in his handkerchief, crams his hands fir&s;t in his bo&s;om, and next in his breeches.</P>
<P N="6">6. In &s;hort, he neither dre&s;&s;es nor acts like any other per&s;on, but is particularly aukward in every thing he does. All this, I own, has nothing in it cri|minal; but it is &s;uch an offence to good manners and good-breeding, that it is univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed; it makes a man ridiculous in every company, and, of cour&s;e, ought carefully to be avoided by every one who would wi&s;h to plea&s;e.</P>
<P N="7">7. From this picture of the ill-bred man, you will ea&s;ily di&s;cover that of the well-bred; for you may readily judge what you ought to do, when you are told what you ought not to do; a little attention to the manners of tho&s;e who have &s;een the world, will make a proper behaviour habitual and familiar to you.</P>
<P N="8">8. Actions, that would otherwi&s;e be plea&s;ing, fre|quently become ridiculous by your manner of doing them. If a lady drops her fan in company, the wor&s;t bred man would immediately pick it up, and give it to her; the be&s;t-bred man can do no more; but then he does it in a graceful manner, which is &s;ure to plea&s;e, whereas the other would do it &s;o aukward|ly as to be laughed at.</P>
<P N="9">9. You may al&s;o know a well-bred per&s;on by his manner of &s;itting. A&s;hamed and confu&s;ed, the auk|ward man &s;its in his chair &s;tiff and bolt upright,
<PB N="230" REF="020531_0235_0FAFE24C3A9930B0">
whereas the man of fa&s;hion is ea&s;y in every po&s;ition; in&s;tead of lolling or lounging as he &s;its, he leans with elegance, and by varying his attitudes, &s;hews that he has been u&s;ed to good company. Let it be one part of your &s;tudy, then, to learn to &s;et gente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly in different companies, to loll gracefully, where you are authorized to take that liberty, and to &s;it up re&s;|pectfully, where that freedom is not allowable.</P>
<P N="10">10. In &s;hort, you cannot conceive how advantage|ous a graceful carriage and a plea&s;ing addre&s;s are, upon all occa&s;ions; they en&s;nare the affections, &s;teal a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in our favour, and play about the heart till they engage it.</P>
<P>Now to acquire a graceful air, you mu&s;t attend to your dancing; no one can either &s;it, &s;tand, or walk well unle&s;s he dances well. And in learning to dance be particularly attentive to the motion of your arms, for a &s;tiffne&s;s in the wri&s;t will make any man look aukward. If a man walks well, pre&s;ents him&s;elf well in company, wears his hat well, moves his head properly and his arms gracefully, it is almo&s;t all that is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="11">11. There is al&s;o an aukwardne&s;s in &s;peech, that naturally falls under this head, and ought to, and may be guarded again&s;t; &s;uch as forgetting names, and mi&s;taking one name for another; to &s;peak of Mr. What-d'ye-call him, or You-know-who, Mrs. Thingum, What's-her-name, or How-d'ye-call her, is exceedingly aukward and vulgar. 'Tis the &s;ame to addre&s;s people by improper titles, as <HI>&s;ir</HI> for <HI>my lord</HI>; to begin a &s;tory without being able to fini&s;h it, and break off in the middle, with
<Q>I have forgot the re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P N="12">12. Our voice and manner of &s;peaking, too, &s;hould likewi&s;e be attended to. Some will mumble over their words, &s;o as not to be intelligible, and others will &s;peak &s;o fa&s;t as not to be under&s;tood, and in do|ing this, will &s;putter and &s;pit in your face; &s;ome will bawl as if they were &s;peaking to the deaf: others
<PB N="231" REF="020531_0236_0FAFE24DDBF60CF0">
will &s;peak &s;o low as &s;carcely to be heard; and many will put their face &s;o clo&s;e to yours as to offend you with their breath.</P>
<P N="13">13. All the&s;e habits are horrid and di&s;gu&s;tful, but may ea&s;ily be got the better of with care. They are the vulgar characteri&s;tics of a low-bred man, or are proofs that very little pains have been be&s;towed in his education. In &s;hort, an attention to the&s;e little matters is of greater importance than you are aware of; many a &s;en&s;ible man having lo&s;t ground for want of the&s;e little graces, and many a one, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e perfections alone, having made his way through life, that otherwi&s;e would not have been noticed.</P>

<P N="14">14. BUT, as no one can plea&s;e in company, how|ever graceful his air, unle&s;s he be clean and neat in his per&s;on, this qualification comes next to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="15">15. Negligence of one's per&s;on not only implies an un&s;ufferable indolence, but an indifference whe|ther we plea&s;e or not. In others, it betrays an in|&s;olence and affectation, ari&s;ing from a pre&s;umption that they are &s;ure of plea&s;ing, without having re|cour&s;e to tho&s;e means which many are obliged to u&s;e.</P>
<P N="16">16. He who is not thoroughly clean in his per&s;on, will be offen&s;ive to all he conver&s;es with. A parti|cular regard to the cleanne&s;s of your mouth, teeth, hands and nails, is but common decency. A foul mouth and unclean hands are certain marks of vul|garity; the fir&s;t is the cau&s;e of an offen&s;ive breath, which nobody can bear, and the la&s;t is declaratory of dirty work; one may always know a gentleman by the &s;tate of his hands and nails. The fle&s;h at the roots &s;hould be kept back, &s;o as to &s;hew the &s;emicir|cles at the bottom of the nails; the edges of the nails &s;hould never be cut down below the ends of the fin|gers; nor &s;hould they be &s;uffered to grow longer than the fingers.</P>
<P N="17"><PB N="232" REF="020531_0237_0FAFE24E8400DB48">17. When the nails are cut down to the quick, it is a &s;hrewd &s;ign that the man is a mechanic, to whom long nails would be trouble&s;ome, or that he gets his bread by fiddling; and if they are longer than his finger's ends, and encircled with a black rim, it foretells he has been laboriou&s;ly and meanly employ|ed, and too fatigued to clean him&s;elf: a good apo|logy for want of cleanline&s;s in a mechanic, but the greate&s;t di&s;grace that can attend a gentleman.</P>

Be&s;ides a clean &s;hirt and a clean per&s;on are as nece&s;|&s;ary to health, as not to offend other people.

'Tis the &s;ame in common conver&s;ation; he who &s;peaks deliberately, di&s;tinctly and correctly; he who makes u&s;e of the be&s;t words to expre&s;s him&s;elf, and varies his voice according to the nature of the &s;ubject, will always plea&s;e, while the thick or ha&s;ty &s;peak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, he who mumbles out a &s;et of ill cho&s;en words, utters them ungrammatically, or with a dull monotony, will tire and di&s;gu&s;t.

of language, they will neither plea&s;e nor per&s;uade. In common di&s;cour&s;e, even trifles elegant|ly expre&s;&s;ed will be better received than the be&s;t of arguments, home-&s;pun and unadorned.</P>
<P N="29">29. A good way to acquire a graceful utterance, is to read aloud to &s;ome friend every day, and beg of him to &s;et you right, in ca&s;e you read too fa&s;t, do not ob&s;erve the proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tops, lay wrong empha&s;is, or utter your words indi&s;tinctly. You may even read aloud to your&s;elf, where &s;uch a friend is not at hand, and you will find your own ear a good corrector. Take care to open your teeth when you read or &s;peak, and articulate every word di&s;tinctly; which la&s;t cannot be done but by &s;ounding the final letter. But above all endeavour to vary your voice, accord|ing to the matter, and avoid a monotony. By a daily attention to this, it will in a little time become ea&s;y and habitual to you.</P>
<P N="30">30. Pay an attention al&s;o to your looks and your ge&s;ture, when talking even on the mo&s;t trifling &s;ub|jects: things appear very different according as they are expre&s;&s;ed, looked and delivered.</P>
<P>Now, if it is nece&s;&s;ary to attend &s;o particularly to our <HI>manner</HI> of &s;peaking, it is much more &s;o with re|&s;pect to the <HI>matter.</HI> Fine turns of expre&s;&s;ion, a gen|teel and correct &s;tyle, are ornaments as requi&s;ite to common &s;en&s;e, as polite behaviour and an elegant addre&s;s are to common good-manners; they are great a&s;&s;i&s;tants in the point of plea&s;ing. A gentleman, 'tis true, may be known in the meane&s;t garb, but it admits not of a doubt, that he would be better re|ceived into good company genteelly and fa&s;hionably dre&s;&s;ed, than was he to appear in dirt and tatters.</P>
<P N="31">31. Be careful then of your &s;tyle upon all occa&s;ions; whether you write or &s;peak, &s;tudy for the be&s;t words and be&s;t expre&s;&s;ions, even in common conver&s;ation or the mo&s;t familiar letters.

time and u&s;e will render it ea&s;y. It is no &s;uch diffi|cult thing to expre&s;s our&s;elves well on &s;ubjects we are thoroughly acquainted with, if we think before we &s;peak; and no one &s;hould pre&s;ume to do otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P N="32">32. When you have &s;aid a thing, if you did not reflect before, be &s;ure to do it afterwards; con&s;ider with your&s;elf whether you could not have expre&s;&s;ed your&s;elf better; and if you are in doubt of the pro|priety or elegancy of any word, &s;earch for it in &s;ome dictionary, or &s;ome good author, while you remem|ber it; never be &s;paring of your trouble while you wi&s;h to improve, and my word for it, a very little time will make this matter habitual.</P>
<P N="33">33. In order to &s;peak grammatically, and to ex|pre&s;s your&s;elf plea&s;ingly, I would recommend it to you to tran&s;late often any language you are acquaint|ed with into Engli&s;h, and to correct &s;uch tran&s;lation till the words, their order, and the periods, are a|greeable to your own ear.</P>
<P>Vulgari&s;m in language is another di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of bad company and education. Expre&s;&s;ions may be correct in them&s;elves and yet be vulgar, ow|ing to their not being fa&s;hionable; for language as manners are both e&s;tabli&s;hed for the u&s;age of people of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P N="34">34. The conver&s;ation of a low-bred man is filled up with proverbs and hackneyed &s;ayings. In&s;tead of ob&s;erving that ta&s;tes are different, and that mo&s;t men have one peculiar to them&s;elves, he will give you, "What is one man's meat is another man's poi&s;on:" or, "Every one to their liking, as the old woman &s;aid, when &s;he ki&s;&s;ed her cow." He has over &s;ome favourite word, which he lugs in upon all occa&s;ions, right or wrong; &s;uch as <HI>va&s;tly</HI> angry, <HI>va&s;tly</HI> kind; <HI>devili&s;h</HI> ugly, <HI>devili&s;h</HI> hand&s;ome; <HI>immen&s;ely</HI> great, <HI>immen&s;ely</HI> little.</P>
<P N="35">35.

&s;uch a place. He affects to u&s;e hard words, to give him the appearance of a man of learning, but fre|quently mi&s;takes their meaning, and &s;eldom, if ever, pronounces them properly.</P>
<P>All this mu&s;t be avoided, if you would not be &s;up|po&s;ed to have kept company with footmen and hou&s;e|maids. Never have recour&s;e to proverbial or vulgar &s;ayings; u&s;e neither favourite nor hard words, but &s;eek for the mo&s;t elegant; be careful in the manage|ment of them, and depend on it your labour will not be lo&s;t; for nothing is more engaging than a fa&s;hion|able and polite addre&s;s.</P>

no means do, unle&s;s attended with manners and at|tention.</P>
<P>There have been people who have frequented the fir&s;t companies all their life-time, and yet have ne|ver got rid of their natural &s;tiffne&s;s and aukwardne&s;s; but have continued as vulgar as if they were never out of a &s;ervant's hall: this has been owing to care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, and a want of attention to the manners and behaviour of others.</P>
<P N="2">2. There are a great many people likewi&s;e who bu&s;y them&s;elves the whole day, and who in fact do nothing. They have po&s;&s;ibly taken up a book for two or three hours, but from a certain inattention that grows upon them the more it is indulged, know no more of the contents than if they had not looked into it; nay, it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to retain what he reads, unle&s;s he reflects and rea&s;ons upon it as he goes on. When they have thus lounged away an hour or two, they will &s;aunter into compa|ny, without attending to any thing that pa&s;&s;es there; but, if they think at all, are thinking of &s;ome tri|fling matter that ought not to occupy their attention; thence perhaps they go to the play, where they &s;tare at the company and the lights, without attending to the piece, the very thing they went to &s;ee.</P>
<P N="3">3. In this manner they wear away their hours, that might otherwi&s;e be employed to their improve|ment and advantage. This &s;illy &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of thought they would have pa&s;s for <HI>ab&s;ence of mind</HI>&mdash;Ridiculous! &mdash;Wherever you are, let me recommend it to you to pay an attention to all that pa&s;&s;es; ob&s;erve the cha|racters of the per&s;ons you are with, and the &s;ubjects of their conver&s;ation; li&s;ten to every thing that is &s;aid, &s;ee every thing that is done, and (according to the vulgar &s;aying) have your eyes and your ears about you.</P>
<P N="4">4. A continual inattention to matters that occur is the characteri&s;tic of a weak mind; the man who gives way to it is little el&s;e than a trider, a blank in

&s;ociety, which every &s;en&s;ible per&s;on overlooks; &s;ure|ly what is worth doing is worth doing well, and no|thing can be well done if not properly attended to. When I hear a man &s;ay, on being a&s;ked about any thing that was &s;aid or done in his pre&s;ence, "that truly he did not mind it," I am ready to knock the fool down. <HI>Why</HI> did he not mind it?&mdash;What had he el&s;e to do?&mdash;A man of &s;en&s;e and fa&s;hion never makes u&s;e of this paltry plea; he never complains of a treacherous memory, but attends to and remem|bers every thing that is either &s;aid or done.</P>

<HEAD>Ab&s;ence of Mind.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. HAVING mentioned ab&s;ence of mind, let me be more particular concerning it.</P>
<P>What the world calls an ab&s;ent man is generally either a very affected one or a very weak one; but whether weak or affected, he is, in company, a ve|ry di&s;agreeable man. Lo&s;t in thought, or po&s;&s;ibly in no thought at all, he is a &s;tranger to every one pre&s;ent, and to every thing that pa&s;&s;es; he knows not his be&s;t friends, is deficient in every act of good manners, unob&s;ervant of the actions of the compa|ny, and in&s;en&s;ible to his own.</P>
<P N="2">2. His an&s;wers are quite the rever&s;e of what they ought to be; talk to him of one thing, he replies,
<PB N="241" REF="020531_0246_0FAFE25548A6D030">
as of another. He forgets what he &s;aid la&s;t, leaves his hat in one room, his cane in another, and his &s;word in a third; nay, if it was not for his buckles, he would even leave his &s;hoes behind him. Neither his arms nor his legs &s;eem to be a part of his body, and his head is never in a right po&s;ition. He joins not in the general conver&s;ation, except it be by fits and &s;tarts, as if awaking from a dream: I attribute this either to weakne&s;s or affectation.</P>
<P N="3">3. His &s;hallow mind is po&s;&s;ibly not able to attend to more than one thing at a time; or he would be &s;uppo&s;ed wrapt up in the inve&s;tigation of &s;ome very important matter. Such men as Sir I&s;aac Newton or Mr. Locke might occa&s;ionally have &s;ome excu&s;e for ab&s;ence of mind; it might proceed from that in|ten&s;ene&s;s of thought that was nece&s;&s;ary at all times for the &s;cientific &s;ubjects they were &s;tudying; but, for a young man, and a man of the world, who has no &s;uch plea to make, ab&s;ence of mind is a rudene&s;s to the company, and de&s;erves the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ure.</P>
<P N="4">4. However in&s;ignificant a company may be; however trifling their conver&s;ation; while you are with them, do not &s;hew them by any inattention that you think them trifling: that can never be the way to plea&s;e, but rather fall in with their weakne&s;s than otherwi&s;e, for to mortify, or &s;hew the lea&s;t contempt to tho&s;e we are in company with, is the greate&s;t rudene&s;s we can be guilty of, and what few can forgive.</P>
<P N="5">5. I never yet found a man inattentive to the per|&s;on he feared, or the woman he loved; which con|vinces me, that ab&s;ence of mind is to be got the better of, if we think proper to make the trial; and believe me, it is always worth the attempt.</P>
<P>Ab&s;ence of mind is a tacit declaration that tho&s;e we are in company with are not worth attending to; and what can be a greater affront?&mdash;Be&s;ides, can an ab&s;ent man improve by what is &s;aid or done in his pre&s;ence?&mdash;No; he may frequent the be&s;t companies

for years together, and all to no purpo&s;e. In &s;hort, a man is neither fit for bu&s;ine&s;s nor conver&s;ation, un|le&s;s he can attend to the object before him, be that object what it will.</P>

<HEAD>Knowledge of the World.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A Knowledge of the world, by our own experi|ence and ob&s;ervation, is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that without it, we &s;hall act very ab&s;urdly, and frequent|ly give offence, when we do not mean it. All the learning and parts in the world will not &s;ecure us from it. Without an acquaintance with life, a man may &s;ay very good things, but time them &s;o ill, and addre&s;s them &s;o improperly, that he had much better be &s;ilent. Full of him&s;elf and his own bu&s;ine&s;s, and inattentive to the circum&s;tances and &s;ituations of tho&s;e he conver&s;es with, he vents it without the lea&s;t di&s;cretion, &s;ays things that he ought not to &s;ay, con|fu&s;es &s;ome, &s;hocks others, and puts the whole com|pany in pain, le&s;t what he utters next &s;hould prove wor&s;e than the la&s;t. The be&s;t direction I can give you in this matter, is rather to fall in with the con|ver&s;ation of others, than &s;tart a &s;ubject of your own: rather &s;trive to put them more in conceit with them|&s;elves, than to draw their attention to you.</P>
<P N="2">2. A novice in life, he who knows little of man|kind, but what he collects from books, lays it down as a maxim, that mo&s;t men love flattery; in order therefore to plea&s;e, he will flatter: but, how? With|out regard either to circum&s;tances or occa&s;ion. In|&s;tead of tho&s;e delicate touches, tho&s;e &s;oft tints, that &s;erve to heighten the piece, he lays on his colours with a heavy hand, and daubs where he means to adorn; in other words, he will flatter &s;o un|&s;ea&s;onably, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o gro&s;sly, that while he wi&s;hes to plea&s;e, he puts out of countenance
<PB N="243" REF="020531_0248_0FAFE256C0E297D0">
and is &s;ure to offend. On the contrary, a man of the world, one who has made life his &s;tudy, knows the power of flattery as well as he; but, then, he knows how to apply it; he watches the opportunity, and does it indirectly, by inference, compari&s;on and hint.</P>
<P N="3">3. Man is made up of &s;uch a variety of matter, that, to &s;earch him thoroughly, requires time and attention; for, though we are all made of the &s;ame materials, and have all the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, yet, from a difference in their proportion and combination, we vary in our di&s;po&s;itions; what is agreeable to one is di&s;agreeable to another, and what one &s;hall ap|prove, another &s;hall condemn. Rea&s;on is given us to controul the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, but &s;eldom does it. Ap|plication therefore to the rea&s;on of any man will fre|quently prove ineffectual, unle&s;s we endeavour at the &s;ame time to gain his heart.</P>
<P N="4">4. Wherever then you are, &s;earch into the cha|racters of men; find out, if po&s;&s;ible, their foible, their governing pa&s;&s;ion, or their particular merit; take them on their weak &s;ide, and you will generally &s;ucceed; their prevailing vanity you may readily di&s;cover, by ob&s;erving their favourite topic of con|ver&s;ation, for every one talks mo&s;t of what he would be thought mo&s;t to excel in.</P>
<P N="5">5. The time &s;hould al&s;o be judiciou&s;ly made choice of. Every man has his particular times when he may be applied to with &s;ucce&s;s, the <HI>mollia tempora fandi:</HI> but the&s;e times are not all the day long; they mu&s;t be found out, watched, and taken advan|tage of. You could not hope for &s;ucce&s;s in applying to a man about one bu&s;ine&s;s, when he was taken up with another, or when his mind was affected with exce&s;s of grief, anger, or the like.</P>
<P N="6">6. You cannot judge of other men's minds better than by &s;tudying your own; for, though &s;ome men have one foible, and another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as another, yet men, in general, are very much alike Whatever plea|&s;es

or offends you, will, in &s;imilar circum&s;tances, plea&s;e or offend others; if you find your&s;elf hurt when another makes you feel his &s;uperiority, you will cer|tainly, upon the common rule of right, <HI>do as you would be done by,</HI> take care not to let another feel your &s;uperiority, if you have it; e&s;pecially if you wi&s;h to gain his intere&s;t or e&s;teem.</P>
<P N="7">7. If di&s;agreeable in&s;inuations, open contradicti|ons, or oblique &s;neers vex and anger you, would you u&s;e them where you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;hed to plea&s;e? Certainly not. Ob&s;erve then, with care, the operations of your own mind, and you may, in a great mea&s;ure, read all mankind.</P>
<P>I will allow that one b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed up in a cloi&s;ter or col|lege, may rea&s;on well on the &s;tructure of the human mind; he may inve&s;tigate the nature of man, and give a tolerable account of his head, his heart, his pa&s;&s;ions, and his &s;entiments: but at the &s;ame time he may know nothing of him; he has not lived with him, and of cour&s;e can know but little how tho&s;e &s;en|timents or tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions will work; he mu&s;t be igno|rant of the various prejudices, propen&s;ities and antipathies that always bias him and frequently de|termine him.</P>
<P N="8">8. His knowledge is acquired only from theory, which differs widely from practice; and if he forms his judgment from that alone, he mu&s;t be often de|ceived; whereas a man of the world, one who col|lects his knowledge from his own experience and ob&s;ervation, is &s;eldom wrong; he is well acquainted with the operations of the human mind, prys into the heart of man; reads his words, before they are ut|tered; &s;ees his actions, before they are performed; knows what will plea&s;e and what will di&s;plea&s;e, and fore&s;ees the event of mo&s;t things.</P>
<P N="9">9. Labour then to acquire this intuitive know|ledge; attend carefully to the addre&s;s, the arts and manners of tho&s;e acquainted with life, and endeavour to imitate them. Ob&s;erve the means they take, to

gain the favour and conciliate the affections of tho&s;e they a&s;&s;ociate with; pur&s;ue tho&s;e means, and you will &s;oon gain the e&s;teem of all that know you.</P>
<P>How often have we &s;een men governed by per&s;ons very much their inferiors in point of under&s;tanding, and even without their knowing it?

<P>That coolne&s;s of mind and evenne&s;s of countenance, which prevents a di&s;covery of our &s;entiments, by our words, our actions, or our looks, is too nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s unnoticed.</P>

there is but one proper reply, which I hope you will never be obliged to have recour&s;e to.</P>
<P N="17">17. Remember there are but two alternatives for a gentleman; extreme politene&s;s, or the &s;word. If a man openly and de&s;ignedly affronts you, call him out; but, if it does not amount to an open in&s;ult, be outwardly civil; if this does not make him a&s;hamed of his behaviour, it will prejudice every by-&s;tander in your favour, and in&s;tead of being di&s;graced, you will come off with honour. Politene&s;s to tho&s;e we do not re&s;pect, is no more a breach of faith than <HI>your humble &s;ervant</HI> at the bottom of a challenge; they are univer&s;ally under&s;tood to be things of cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="18">18. Wrangling and quarreling are characteri&s;tic of a weak mind: leave that to the women, be <HI>you</HI> always above it. Enter into no &s;harp conte&s;t, and pride your&s;elf in &s;hewing, if po&s;&s;ible, more civi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity to your antagoni&s;t than to any other in the company; this will infallibly bring over all the laughter to your &s;ide, and the per&s;on you are contending with will be very likely to confe&s;s you have behaved very hand&s;omely throughout the whole affair.</P>
<P N="19">19. Experience will teach us that though all men con&s;i&s;t principally of the &s;ame materials, as I before took notice, yet from a difference in their propor|tion, no two men are uniformly the &s;ame: we differ from one another, and we often differ from our&s;elves, that is, we &s;ometimes do things utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the general tenor of our characters. The wi&s;e&s;t man will occa&s;ionally do a weak thing; the mo&s;t ho|ne&s;t man, a wrong thing; the proude&s;t man, a mean thing; and the wor&s;t of men will &s;ometimes do a good thing.</P>
<P N="20">20. On this account, our &s;tudy of mankind &s;hould not be general; we &s;hould take a frequent view of individuals, and though we may upon the whole form a judgment of the man from his prevailing pa&s;&s;ion or his general character, yet it will be prudent not to determine, till we have waited to &s;ee the opera|tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of his &s;ubordinate appetites and humours.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="248" REF="020531_0253_0FAFE25C04E710E0">21. For example; a man's general character may be that of &s;trictly hone&s;t; I would not di&s;pute it, be|cau&s;e I would not be thought envious or malevolent; but I would not rely upon this general character, &s;o as to entru&s;t him with my fortune or my life. Should this hone&s;t man, as is not uncommon, be my rival in power, intere&s;t, or love, he may po&s;&s;ibly do things that in other circum&s;tances he would abhor; and power, intere&s;t, and love, let me tell you, will often put hone&s;ty to the &s;evere&s;t trial, and frequently over|power it. I would then ran&s;ack this hone&s;t man to the bottom, if I wi&s;hed to tru&s;t him, and as I found him, would place my confidence accordingly.</P>
<P N="22">22. One of the great compo&s;itions in our nature is vanity, to which, all men, more or le&s;s, give way. Women have an intolerable &s;hare of it. No flattery, no adulation is too gro&s;s for them; tho&s;e who flatter them mo&s;t plea&s;e them be&s;t, and they are mo&s;t in love with him who pretends to be mo&s;t in love with them: and the lea&s;t &s;light or contempt of them is never for|gotten. It is in &s;ome mea&s;ure the &s;ame with men; they will &s;ooner pardon an injury than an in&s;ult, and are more hurt by contempt than by ill-u&s;age. Though all men do not boa&s;t of &s;uperior talents, though they pretend not to the abilities of a Pope, a Newton, or a Bolingbroke, every one pretends to have common &s;en&s;e, and to di&s;charge his office in life with common decency; to arraign therefore, in any &s;hape, his abi|lities or integrity in the department he holds, is an in&s;ult he will not readily forgive.</P>
<P N="23">23. As I would not have you tru&s;t too implicitly to a man, becau&s;e the world gives him a good character; &s;o I mu&s;t particularly caution you again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;peak well of them&s;elves. In general, &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e who boa&s;t of or affect to have any one virtue above all others, for they are commonly impo&s;tors. There are exceptions, however, to this rule, for we hear of prudes that have been cha&s;te, bullies that have been brave, and &s;aints that have been religious. Confide

only where your own ob&s;ervation &s;hall direct you; ob&s;erve not only what is &s;aid, but how it is &s;aid, and if you have penetration, you may find out the truth better by your eyes than your ears; in &s;hort, never take a character upon common report, but enquire into it your&s;elf; for common report, though it is right in general, may be wrong in particulars.</P>
<P N="24">24. Beware of tho&s;e who, on a &s;light acquaint|ance, make a tender of their friend&s;hip, and &s;eem to place a confidence in you; 'tis ten to one but they deceive and betray you; however do not rudely reject them upon &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition; you may be civil to them, though you do not entru&s;t them. Silly men are apt to &s;olicit your friend&s;hip, and unbo&s;om them|&s;elves upon the fir&s;t acquaintance; &s;uch friends can|not be worth hearing, their friend&s;hip being as &s;len|der as their under&s;tanding; and if they proffer their friend&s;hip with a de&s;ign to make a property of you, they are dangerous acquaintance indeed.</P>
<P N="25">25. Not but the little friend&s;hips of the weak may be of &s;ome u&s;e to you, if you do not return the compli|ment; and it may not be ami&s;s to &s;eem to accept tho&s;e of de&s;igning men, keeping them, as it were, in play, that they may not be openly your enemies; for their enmity is the next dangerous thing to their friend|&s;hip. We may certainly hold their vices in abhor|rence, without being marked out as their per&s;onal enemy. The general rule is to have a real re&s;erve with almo&s;t every one, and a &s;eeming re&s;erve with almo&s;t no one; for it is very di&s;gu&s;ting to &s;eem re|&s;erved, and very dangerous not to be &s;o. Few ob|&s;erve the true medium. Many are ridiculou&s;ly my&s;|terious upon trifles, and many indi&s;creetly commu|nicative of all they know.</P>
<P N="26">26. There is a kind of &s;hort-lived friend&s;hip that takes place among young men, from a connection in their plea&s;ures only; a friend&s;hip too often attended with bad con&s;equences. This companion of your plea&s;ures, young and unexperienced, will probably,
<PB N="250" REF="020531_0255_0FAFE25D821C8AE8">
in the heat of convivial mirth, vow a perpetual friend&s;hip, and unfold him&s;elf to you without the lea&s;t re&s;erve; but new a&s;&s;ociations, change of fortune, or change of place, may &s;oon break this ill timed connection, and an improper u&s;e may be made of it.</P>
<P N="27">27. Be one, if you will, in young companies, and bear your part like others in the &s;ocial fe&s;tivity of youth; nay, tru&s;t them with your innocent frolics, but keep your &s;erious matters to your&s;elf; and if you mu&s;t at any time make <HI>them</HI> known, let it be to &s;ome tried friend of great experience; and that nothing may tempt him to become your rival, let that friend be in a different walk of life from your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Were I to hear a man making &s;trong prote&s;tations, and &s;wearing to the truth of a thing, that is in it&s;elf probable and very likely to be, I &s;hould doubt his veracity; for when he takes &s;uch pains to make me believe it, it cannot be with a good de&s;ign.</P>
<P N="28">28. There is a certain ea&s;ine&s;s or fal&s;e mode&s;ty in mo&s;t young people, that either makes them unwil|ling, or a&s;hamed to refu&s;e any thing that is a&s;ked of them. There is al&s;o an unguarded openne&s;s about them that makes them the ready prey of the artful and de&s;igning. They are ea&s;ily led away by the feigned friend&s;hips of a knave or a fool, and too ra&s;h|ly place a confidence in them, that terminates in their lo&s;s, and frequently in their ruin. Beware, therefore, as I &s;aid before, of the&s;e proffered friend|&s;hips; repay them with compliments, but not with confidence. Never let your vanity make you &s;uppo&s;e that people become your friends upon a &s;light ac|quaintance: for good offices mu&s;t be &s;hewn on both &s;ides to create a friend&s;hip: it will not thrive, unle&s;s its love be mutual; and it requires time to ripen it.</P>
<P N="29">29. There is &s;till among young people another kind of friend&s;hip merely nominal, warm indeed for the time, but fortunately of no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ong continuance. This friend&s;hip takes its ri&s;e from their pur&s;uing the &s;ame cour&s;e of riot and debauchery; their pur&s;es are

open to each other, they tell one another all they know, they embark in the &s;ame quarrels, and &s;tand by each other on all occa&s;ions. I &s;hould rather call this a confederacy again&s;t good morals and good manners, and think it de&s;erves the &s;evere&s;t la&s;h of the law; but they have the impudence to call it friend&s;hip. However, it is often as &s;uddenly di&s;&s;olv|ed as it is ha&s;tily contracted; &s;ome accident di&s;per&s;es them, and they pre&s;ently forget each other, except it is to betray and laugh at their own egregious folly.</P>

<P N="2">2. There are two &s;orts of good company; the one con&s;i&s;ts of per&s;ons of birth, rank, and fa&s;hion; the other of tho&s;e who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome peculiar merit, in any liberal art of &s;cience; as men of let|ters, &amp;c. and a mixture of the&s;e is what I would have under&s;tood by good company; for it is not what particular &s;ets of people &s;hall call them&s;elves, but what the people in general acknowledge to be &s;o, and are the accredited good company of the place.</P>

<P>In this fa&s;hionable good company alone, can you learn the be&s;t manners and the be&s;t language: for, as there is no legal &s;tandard to form them by, 'tis here they are e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be que&s;tioned, whether a man has it always in his power to get into good company: undoubtedly, by de&s;erving it, he has; provided he is in circum&s;tances which enable him to live and ap|pear in the &s;tyle of a gentleman. Knowledge, mo|de&s;ty, and good breeding, will endear him to all that &s;ee him; for without politene&s;s, the &s;cholar is no better than a pedant, the philo&s;opher than a cynic, the &s;oldier than a brute, nor any man than a clown.</P>

<P><PB N="253" REF="020531_0258_0FAFE25FC05DEEE0">The vanity I mean, is that of being the fir&s;t of the company. This pride, though too common, is idle to the la&s;t degree.

Be a&s;&s;ured, were they free from their vices, they would be much more e&s;teemed. In the&s;e mixed characters, the bad part is overlooked, for the &s;ake of the good.</P>

Ab&s;tain then from this &s;illy cu&s;tom, where you find it out of u&s;e; and u&s;e it only at tho&s;e tables where it continues general.</P>
<P N="5">5. A polite manner of refu&s;ing to comply with the &s;olicitations of a company, is al&s;o very nece&s;&s;ary to be learnt; for a young man who &s;eems to have no will of his own, but does every thing that is a&s;ked of him, may be a very good natured fellow, but he is a very &s;illy one. If you are invited to drink, at any man's hou&s;e, more than you think is whole|&s;ome, you may &s;ay, "you wi&s;h you could, but that &s;o little makes you both drunk and &s;ick, that you &s;hall only be bad company by doing it: of cour&s;e, beg to be excu&s;ed."</P>
<P N="6">6. If de&s;ired to play at cards deeper than you would, refu&s;e it ludicrou&s;ly; tell them,
<Q>If you were &s;ure to lo&s;e, you might po&s;&s;ibly &s;it down; but that as fortune may be favourable, you dread the thought of having too much money, ever &s;ince you found what an incumbrance it was to poor Harlequin, and therefore you are re&s;olved never to put your&s;elf in the way of winning more than &s;uch and &s;uch a &s;um a day.</Q>
This light way of declining invitations to vice and folly, is more be|coming a young man than philo&s;ophical or &s;ententi|ous refu&s;als, which would only be laughed at.</P>
<P N="7">7. Now I am on the &s;ubject of cards, mu&s;t not omit mentioning the nece&s;&s;ity of playing them well and genteelly, if you would be thought to have kept good company. I would by no means recommend playing at cards, as a part of your &s;tudy, le&s;t you &s;hould grow too fond of it, and the con&s;equences prove bad. It were better not to know a diamond
<PB N="257" REF="020531_0262_0FAFE262B9F4C2F0">
from a club, than to become a gambler; but, as cu&s;tom has introduced innocent card-playing at mo&s;t friendly meetings, it marks the gentleman to handle them genteelly, and play them well; and as I hope you will play only for &s;mall &s;ums, &s;hould you lo&s;e your money, pray lo&s;e it with temper; or win, receive your winnings without either elation or greedine&s;s.</P>
<P N="8">8. To write well and correct, and in a plea&s;ing &s;tyle, is another part of polite education. Every man who has the u&s;e of his eyes and his right-hand, can write whatever hand he plea&s;es. Nothing is &s;o illi|beral as a &s;chool-boy's &s;crawl. I would not have you learn a &s;tiff formal hand-writing, like that of a &s;chool-ma&s;ter, but a genteel, legible, and liberal hand, and to be able to write quick. As to the cor|rectne&s;s and elegancy of your writing, attention to grammer does the one, and to the be&s;t authors, the other. Epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence &s;hould not be car|ried on in a &s;tudied or affected &s;tyle, but the language &s;hould flow from the pen, as naturally and as ea&s;ily as it would from the mouth. In &s;hort, a letter &s;hould be penned in the &s;ame &s;tyle as you would talk to your friend, if he was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="9">9. If writing well &s;hews the gentleman, much more &s;o does &s;pelling well. It is &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;|&s;ary for a gentleman, or a man of letters, that one fal&s;e &s;pelling may fix a ridicule on him for the re|mainder of his life. Words in books are generally well &s;pelled, according to the orthography of the age; reading therefore with attention will teach every one to &s;pell right. It &s;ometimes happens that words &s;hall be &s;pelled differently by different authors; but, if you &s;pell them upon the authority of one in e&s;timati|on of the public, you will e&s;cape ridicule. Where there is but one way of &s;pelling a word, by your &s;pel|ling it wrong, you will be &s;ure to be laughed at. For a <HI>woman</HI> of a tolerable education would laugh at and de&s;pi&s;e her lover, if he wrote to her, and the
<PB N="258" REF="020531_0263_0FAFE26379A07CB8">
words were ill &s;pelled. Be particularly attentive then to your &s;pelling.</P>
<P N="10">10. There is nothing that a man at his fir&s;t ap|pearance in life ought more to dread than having any ridicule fixed on him. In the e&s;timation even of the mo&s;t rational men, it will le&s;&s;en him, but ruin him with all the re&s;t. Many a man has been undone by a ridiculous nick-name. The cau&s;es of nick-names among well-bred men, are generally the little defects in manner, air, or addre&s;s. To have the appella|tion of ill-bred, aukward, muttering, left-legged, or any other tacked always to your name, would in|jure you more than you are aware of; avoid then the&s;e little defects (and they are ea&s;ily avoided) and you need never fear a nick-name.</P>
<P N="11">11. Some young men are apt to think, that they cannot be complete gentlemen, without becoming men of plea&s;ure. A rake is made up of the meane&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;graceful vices. They all combine to degrade his character, and ruin his health and for|tune. A man of plea&s;ure will refine upon the enjoy|ments of the age, attend them with decency, and partake of them becomingly.</P>
<P N="12">12. Indeed, he is too often le&s;s &s;crupulous than he &s;hould be, and frequently has cau&s;e to repent it. A man of plea&s;ure, at be&s;t, is but a di&s;&s;ipated being, and what the rational part of mankind mu&s;t abhor; I mention it, however, le&s;t, in taking up the man of plea&s;ure, you &s;hould fall into the rake; for of two evils, always chu&s;e the lea&s;t. A di&s;&s;olute, flagiti|ous footman may make as good a rake as a man of the fir&s;t quality. Few men can be men of plea&s;ure; every man may be a rake.</P>
<P N="13">13. There is a certain dignity that &s;hould be pre|&s;erved in all our plea&s;ures; in love, a man may lo&s;e his heart, without lo&s;ing his no&s;e; at table, a man may have a di&s;tingui&s;hed palate, without being a glutton; he may love wine, without being a drunk|ard; he may game without being a gambler, and &s;o on.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="259" REF="020531_0264_0FAFE264D810C058">14. Every virtue has its kindred vice, and every plea&s;ure its neighbouring di&s;grace. Temperance and moderation mark the gentleman; but exce&s;s, the blackguard. Attend carefully, then, to the line that divides them; and remember, &s;top rather a yard &s;hort, then &s;tep an inch beyond it. Weigh the pre&s;ent enjoyment of your plea&s;ures again&s;t the ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of them, and I will leave you to your own determiation.</P>
<P N="15">15. A gentleman has ever &s;ome regard al&s;o to the <HI>choice,</HI> of his amu&s;ements. If at cards, he will not be &s;een at cribbage, all-fours, or putt; or, in &s;ports of excerci&s;e, at &s;kittles, foot-ball, leap-frog, cricket, driving of coaches, &amp;c. but will pre&s;erve a propriety in every part of his conduct; knowing that any imita|tion of the manners of the mob, will unavoidably &s;tamp him with vulgarity. There is another amu&s;e|ment too, which I cannot help calling illiberal, that is, playing upon any mu&s;ical in&s;trument.</P>
<P N="16">16. Mu&s;ic is commonly reckoned one of the libe|ral arts, and undoubtedly is &s;o: but to be piping or fiddling at a concert is degrading to a man of fa&s;hion. If you love mu&s;ic, hear it; pay fiddlers to play to you, but never fiddle your&s;elf. It makes a gentleman ap|pear frivolous and contemptible, leads him frequent|ly into bad company, and wa&s;tes that time which might otherwi&s;e be well employed.</P>
<P N="17">17. Secrecy is another characteri&s;tic of good-breed|ing. Be careful not to tell in one company what you &s;ee or hear in another; much le&s;s to divert the pre|&s;ent company at the expence of the la&s;t. Things apparently indifferent may, when often repeated and told abroad, have much more &s;erious con&s;equences than imagined. In conver&s;ation there is generally a tacit reliance, that what is &s;aid will not be repeat|ed; and a man, though not enjoined to &s;ecrecy, will be excluded company, if found to be a tatler; be|&s;ides, he will draw him&s;elf into a thou&s;and &s;crapes, and every one will be afraid to &s;peak before him.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="260" REF="020531_0265_0FAFE264FB198FF8">18. Pulling out your watch in company una&s;ked, either at home or abroad, is a mark of ill-breeding; if at home, it appears as if you were tired of your company, and wi&s;hed them to be gone; if abroad, as if the hours drag heavily, and you wi&s;hed to be gone your&s;elf. If you want to know the time, with|draw; be&s;ides, as the taking what is called a French leave was introduced, that on one per&s;on's leaving the company the re&s;t might not be di&s;turbed, look|ing at your watch does what that piece of politene&s;s was de&s;igned to prevent; it is a kind of dictating to all pre&s;ent, and telling them it is time, or almo&s;t time, to break up.</P>
<P N="19">19. Among other things, let me caution you a|gain&s;t ever being in a hurry; a man of &s;en&s;e may be in ha&s;te, but he is never in a hurry; convinced that hurry is the &s;ure&s;t way to make him do, what he un|dertakes, ill. To be in a hurry, is a proof that the bu&s;ine&s;s we embark in is too great for us; of cour&s;e, it is the mark of little minds, that are puzzled and perplexed, when they &s;hould be cool and deliberate; they wi&s;h to do every thing at once, and are thus able to do nothing. Be &s;teady then in all your en|gagements; look round you before you begin; and remember that you had better do half of them well, and leave the re&s;t undone, than to do the whole in|differently.</P>
<P N="20">20. From a kind of fal&s;e mode&s;ty, mo&s;t young men are apt to con&s;ider familiarity as unbecoming. For|wardne&s;s I allow is &s;o; but there is a decent famili|arity that is nece&s;&s;ary in the cour&s;e of life. Mere formal vi&s;its, upon formal invitations, are not the thing; they create no connection, nor will they prove of &s;ervice to you; it is the carele&s;s and ea&s;y ingre&s;s and egre&s;s, at all hours, that &s;ecures an acquaintance to our intere&s;t, and this is acquired by a re&s;pectful familiarity entered into, without forfeiting your con|&s;equence.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="261" REF="020531_0266_0FAFE265BA732668">21. In acquiring new acquaintance, be careful not to neglect your old, for a &s;light of this kind is &s;eldom forgiven. If you cannot be with your former ac|quaintance &s;o often as you u&s;ed to be, while you had no others, take care not to give them cau&s;e to think you neglect them; call upon them frequently, though you cannot &s;tay long with them; tell them you are &s;orry to leave them &s;o &s;oon, and nothing &s;hould take you away but certain engagements which good-man|ners oblige you to attend to; for it will be your in|tere&s;t to make all the friends you can, and as few enemies as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P N="22">22. By friends, I would not be under&s;tood to mean confidential ones; but per&s;ons who &s;peak of you re&s;|pectfully, and who, con&s;i&s;tent with their own intere&s;t would wi&s;h to be of &s;ervice to you, and would rather do you good than harm.</P>
<P>Another thing I mu&s;t recommend to you, as cha|racteri&s;tic of a polite education, and of having kept good company, is a graceful manner of conferring favours. The mo&s;t obliging things may be done &s;o aukwardly as to offend, while the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable things may be done &s;o agreeably as to plea&s;e.</P>
<P N="23">23. A few more articles of general advice, and I have done; the fir&s;t is on the &s;ubject of vanity. It is the common failing of youth, and as &s;uch ought to be carefully guarded again&s;t. The vanity I mean, is that which, if given way to, &s;tamps a man a cox|comb, a character he will find a difficulty to get rid of, perhaps as long he lives. Now this vanity &s;hews it&s;elf in a variety of &s;hapes; one man &s;hall pride him&s;elf in taking the lead in all conver&s;ations, and peremptorily deciding upon every &s;ubject; another, de&s;irous of appearing &s;ucce&s;sful among the women, &s;hall in&s;inuate the encouragement he has met with, the conque&s;ts he makes, and perhaps boa&s;ts of fa|vours he never received; if he &s;peaks the truth, he is ungenerous; if fal&s;e, he is a villain; but whether true or fal&s;e, he defeats his own purpo&s;es, over|throws
<PB N="262" REF="020531_0267_0FAFE26682F3AD20">
the reputation he wi&s;hes to erect, and draws upon him&s;elf contempt in the room of re&s;pect.</P>
<P N="24">24. Some men are vain enough to think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey ac|quire con&s;equence by alliance, or by an acquaintance with per&s;ons of di&s;tingui&s;hed character or abilities: hence they are eternally talking of their grand-fa|ther, Lord &s;uch-a-one; their kin&s;man, Sir William &s;uch-a-one; or their intimate friend, Dr. &s;uch-a-one, with whom, perhaps, they are &s;carce acquainted. If they are ever found out (and that they are &s;ure to be, one time or other) they become ridiculous and con|temptible; but even admitting what they &s;ay to be true, what then? A man's intrin&s;ic merit does not ri&s;e from an ennobled alliance, or a reputable ac|quaintance.</P>
<P N="25">25. A rich man never borrows. When angling for prai&s;e, mode&s;ty is the &s;ure&s;t bait. If we would wi&s;h to &s;hine in any particular character, we mu&s;t never affect that character. An affectation of courage will make a man pa&s;s for a bully; an affectation of wit for a coxcomb; and an affectation of &s;en&s;e, for a fool. Not that I would recommend ba&s;hfulne&s;s or timidity; no; I would have every one know his own value, yet not di&s;cover that he knows it, but leave his merit to be found out by others.</P>
<P N="26">26. Another thing worth your attention is, if in company with an inferior, not to let him feel his in|feriority; if he di&s;covers it him&s;elf without your en|deavours, the fault is not yours, and he will not blame you; but if you take pains to mortify him, or to make him feel him&s;elf inferior to you in abili|ties, fortune, or rank, it is an in&s;ult that will not readily be forgiven. In point of abilities, it would be unju&s;t, as they are out of his power; in point of rank or fortune, it is ill-natured and ill-bred.</P>
<P N="27">27. This rule is never more nece&s;&s;ary than at ta|ble, where there cannot be a greater in&s;ult than to help an inferior to a part he di&s;likes, or a part that may be wor&s;e than ordinary, and to take the be&s;t to
<PB N="263" REF="020531_0268_0FAFE2673999AE88">
your&s;elf. If you at any time invite an inferior to your table, you put him, during the time he is there, upon an equality with you, and it is an act of the highe&s;t rudene&s;s to treat him in any re&s;pect &s;lighting|ly. I would rather double my attention to &s;uch a per&s;on, and treat him with additional re&s;pect, le&s;t he &s;hould even &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf neglected.</P>
<P N="28">28. There cannot be a greater &s;avagene&s;s, or cruel|ty, or any thing more degrading to a man of fa&s;hion, than to put upon or take unbecoming liberties with him, who&s;e mode&s;ty, humility, or re&s;pect, will not &s;uffer him to retaliate. True politene&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in making every body happy about you; and as to mor|tify is to render unhappy, it can be nothing but the wor&s;t of breeding. Make it a rule, rather to flatter a per&s;on's vanity than otherwi&s;e; make him, if po&s;|&s;ible, more in love with him&s;elf, and you will be cer|tain to gain his e&s;teem; never tell him any thing he may not like to hear, nor &s;ay things that will put him out of countenance, but let it be your &s;tudy on all oc|ca&s;ions to plea&s;e: this will be making friends in&s;tead of enemies, and be a means of &s;erving your&s;elf in the end.</P>
<P N="29">29. Never be witty at the expence of any one pre|&s;ent, nor gratify that idle inclination which is too &s;trong in mo&s;t young men, I mean, laughing at, or ridiculing the weakne&s;&s;es or infirmities of others, by way of diverting the company, or di&s;playing your own &s;uperiority. Mo&s;t people have their weakne&s;&s;es, their peculiar likings and aver&s;ions. Some cannot bear the &s;ight of a cat; others the &s;mell of chee&s;e, and &s;o on; was you to laugh at the&s;e men for their antipathies, or by de&s;ign or inattention to bring them in their way, you could not in&s;ult them more.</P>
<P N="30">30. You may po&s;&s;ibly thus gain the laugh on your &s;ide for the pre&s;ent, but it will make the per&s;on, per|haps, at who&s;e expence you are merry, your enemy for ever after; and even tho&s;e who laugh with you, will, on a little reflection, fear you, and probably
<PB N="264" REF="020531_0269_0FAFE267FB243A70">
de&s;pi&s;e you: whereas to procure what <HI>one</HI> likes, and to remove what the <HI>other</HI> hates, would &s;hew them that they were objects of your attention, and po&s;&s;ibly make them more your friends than much greater &s;ervices would have done.</P>
<P N="31">31. If you have wit, u&s;e it to plea&s;e, but not to hurt. You may &s;hine, but take care not to &s;corch. In &s;hort, never &s;eem to &s;ee the faults of others. Though among the ma&s;s of men there are, doubtle&s;s, num|bers of fools and knaves, yet were we to tell every one of the&s;e we meet with, that we know them to be &s;o, we &s;hould be in perpetual war. I would dete&s;t the knave and pity the fool, wherever I found him, but I would let neither of them know unnece&s;&s;arily that I did &s;o; as I would not be indu&s;trious to make my|&s;elf enemies. As one mu&s;t plea&s;e others then, in or|der to be plea&s;ed one's-&s;elf; con&s;ider what is agree|able to you mu&s;t be agreeable to them, and conduct your&s;elf accordingly.</P>
<P N="32">32. Whi&s;pering in company is another act of ill-breeding; it &s;eems to in&s;inuate either that the per&s;ons whom we would not wi&s;h &s;hould hear, are unworthy of our confidence, or it may lead them to &s;uppo&s;e we are &s;peaking improperly of them; on both accounts, therefore, ab&s;tain from it.</P>
<P>So pulling out one letter after another, and reading them in company, or cutting or paring one's nails, is unpolite and rude. It &s;eems to &s;ay, we are weary of the conver&s;ation, and are in want of &s;ome amu&s;e|ment to pa&s;s away the time.</P>
<P N="33">33. Humming a tune to our&s;elves, drumming with our fingers on the table, making a noi&s;e with our feet, and &s;uch like, are all breaches of good manners, and indications of our contempt for the per&s;ons pre|&s;ent; therefore they &s;hould not be indulged.</P>
<P>Walking fa&s;t in the &s;treets is a mark of vulgarity, implying hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s; it may appear well in a mechanic or trade&s;man, but &s;uits ill with the charac|ter of a gentleman or a man of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="020531_0270_0FAFE268BB151B58">Staring any per&s;on you meet, full in the face, is an act al&s;o of ill-breeding; it looks as if you &s;aw &s;omething wonderful in his appearance, and is there|fore a tacit reprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="34">34. Eating quick, or very &s;low, at meals, is cha|racteri&s;tic of the vulgar; the fir&s;t infers poverty, that you have not had a good meal for &s;ome time; the la&s;t, if abroad, that you di&s;like your entertainment: if at home, that you are rude enough to &s;et before your friends what you cannot eat your&s;elf. So again, eat|ing your &s;oups with your no&s;e in the plate is vulgar; it has the appearance of being u&s;ed to hard work, and of cour&s;e an un&s;teady hand.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>Dignity of Manners.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A Certain dignity of manners is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to make even the mo&s;t valuable cha|racter either re&s;pected or re&s;pectable in the world.</P>
<P>Hor&s;e-play, romping, frequent and loud fits of laughter, jokes, waggery, and indi&s;criminate fami|liarity, will &s;ink both merit and knowledge into a degree of contempt. They compo&s;e at mo&s;t a merry fellow, and a merry fellow was never yet a re&s;pecta|ble man. Indi&s;criminate familiarity either offends your &s;uperiors, or el&s;e dubs you their dependent and led captain. It gives your inferiors ju&s;t, but trou|ble&s;ome and improper, claims of equality. A joker is near a-kin to a buffoon; and neither of them is the lea&s;t related to wit.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mimicry, the favourite amu&s;ement of little minds, has been ever the contempt of great ones. Never give way to it your&s;elf, nor ever encourage it in others; it is the mo&s;t illiberal of all buffoonery; it is an in&s;ult on the per&s;on you mimic; and in&s;ults, I have often told you, are &s;eldom forgiven.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="020531_0271_0FAFE2697A91FCF0">As to a mimic or a wag, he is little el&s;e than a buffoon, who will di&s;tort his mouth and his eyes to make people laugh. Be a&s;&s;ured, no one per&s;on ever demeaned him&s;elf to plea&s;e the re&s;t, unle&s;s he wi&s;hed to be thought the Merry-Andrew of the company, and whether this character is re&s;pectable, I will leave you to judge.</P>
<P N="3">3. If a man's company is coveted on any other ac|count than his knowledge, his good &s;en&s;e, or his man|ners, he is &s;eldom re&s;pected by tho&s;e who invite him, but made u&s;e of only to entertain. "Let's have &s;uch a one, for he &s;ings a good &s;ong, or he is always jok|ing or laughing;" or, "let's fend for &s;uch a one, for he is a good bottle companion:" the&s;e are de|grading di&s;tinctions, that preclude all re&s;pect and e&s;teem. Whoever is <HI>had</HI> (as the phra&s;e is) for the &s;ake of any qualification, &s;ingly, is merely that thing he <HI>is had</HI> for, is never con&s;idered in any other light, and, of cour&s;e, never properly re&s;pected, let his in|trin&s;ic merits be what they will.</P>
<P N="4">4. You may po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e this dignity of man|ners to border upon pride; but it differs as much from pride, as true courage from blu&s;tering.</P>
<P>To flatter a per&s;on right or wrong, is abject flatte|ry, and to con&s;ent readily to every thing propo&s;ed by a company, be it &s;illy or criminal, is full as degrad|ing, as to di&s;pute warmly upon every &s;ubject, and to contradict upon all occa&s;ions. To pre&s;erve dignity, we &s;hould mode&s;tly a&s;&s;ert our own &s;entiments, though we politely acquie&s;ce in tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>So again, to &s;upport dignity of character, we &s;hould neither be frivolou&s;ly curious about trifles, nor be la|boriou&s;ly intent on little objects that de&s;erve not a moment's attention; for this implies an incapacity in matters of greater importance.</P>
<P>A great deal likewi&s;e depends upon our air, ad|dre&s;s, and expre&s;&s;ions; an aukward addre&s;s and vul|gar expre&s;&s;ions infer either a low turn of mind, or a low education.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="267" REF="020531_0272_0FAFE26A3A5E7970">5. In&s;olent contempt, or low envy, is incompati|ble al&s;o with dignity of manners. Low-bred per&s;ons, fortunately lifted in the world, in fine cloaths and fine equipages, will in&s;olently look down on all tho&s;e who cannot afford to make as good an appearance; and they openly envy tho&s;e who perhaps make a bet|ter. They al&s;o dread the being &s;lighted; of cour&s;e are &s;u&s;picious, and captious; are unea&s;y them&s;elves, and make every body el&s;e &s;o about them.</P>
<P N="6">6. A certain degree of outward &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s in looks and actions gives dignity, while a con&s;tant &s;mirk up|on the face (with that in&s;ipid &s;illy &s;mile, fools have when they would be civil) and whiffling motions, are &s;trong marks of futility.</P>
<P>But above all, a dignity of character is to be ac|quired be&s;t by a certain firmne&s;s in all our actions. A mean, timid, and pa&s;&s;ive complai&s;ance, lets a man down more than he is aware of: but &s;till his firmne&s;s or re&s;olution &s;hould not extend to brutality, but be accompanied with a peculiar and engaging &s;oftne&s;s, or mildne&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. If you di&s;cover any ha&s;tine&s;s in your temper, and find it apt to break out into rough and unguard|ed expre&s;&s;ions, watch it narrowly, and endeavour to curb it; but let no complai&s;ance, no weak de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, no wheedling, urge you to do that which di&s;cretion forbids; but per&s;i&s;t and per&s;evere in all that is right. In your connections and friend&s;hips, you will find this rule of u&s;e to you. Invite and pre|&s;erve attachments, by your firmne&s;s; but labour to keep clear of enemies, by a mildne&s;s of behaviour. Di&s;arm tho&s;e enemies you may unfortunately have, (and few are without them) by a gentlene&s;s of man|ner, but make them feel the &s;teadine&s;s of your ju&s;t re&s;entment; for there is a wide difference between bearing malice and a determined &s;elf-defence; the one is imperious, but the other is prudent and ju&s;ti|fiable.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="268" REF="020531_0273_0FAFE26B0030A138">8. In directing your &s;ervants, or any per&s;on you have a right to command; if you deliver your orders mildly, and in that engaging manner which every gentleman &s;hould &s;tudy to do, you will be chearfully, and con&s;equently, well obeyed: but if tyrannically, you would be very unwillingly &s;erved, if &s;erved at all. A cool, &s;teady determination &s;hould &s;hew that you <HI>will</HI> be obeyed, but a gentlene&s;s in the manner of enforcing that obedience &s;hould make &s;ervice a chearful one. Thus will you be loved without being de&s;pi&s;ed, and feared without being hated.</P>
<P N="9">9. I hope I need not mention vices. A man who has patiently been kicked out of company, may have as good a pretence to courage, as one rendered in|famous by his vices, may to dignity of any kind; however, of &s;uch con&s;equence are appearances, that an outward decency, and an affected dignity of man|ners, will even keep &s;uch a man the longer from &s;ink|ing. If therefore you &s;hould unfortunately have no intrin&s;ic merit of your own, keep up, if po&s;&s;ible, the appearance of it; and the world will po&s;&s;ibly give you credit for the re&s;t. A ver&s;atility of manner is as nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ocial life, as a ver&s;atility of parts in political. This is no way blameable, if not u&s;ed with an ill de&s;ign. We mu&s;t, like the cameleon, then, put on the hue of the per&s;ons we wi&s;h to be well with; and it &s;urely can never be blameable, to endeavour to gain the good-will or affection of any one, if, when obtained, we do not mean to abu&s;e it.</P>

<HEAD>Rules for Conver&s;ation.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. JACK LIZARD was about fifteen when he was fir&s;t entered in the univer&s;ity, and being a youth of a great deal of fire, and a more than ordi|nary application to his &s;tudies, it gave his conver|&s;ation a very particular turn. He had too much &s;pi|rit
<PB N="269" REF="020531_0274_0FAFE26BBB889DA8">
to hold his tongue in company; but at the &s;ame time &s;o little acquaintance with the world, that he did not know how to talk like other people.</P>
<P N="2">2. After a year and a half's &s;tay at the univer&s;ity, he came down among us to pa&s;s away a month or two in the country. The fir&s;t night after his arrival, as we were at &s;upper, we were all of us very much im|proved by <HI>Jack</HI>'s table-talk. He told us, upon the appearance of a di&s;h of wild-fowl, that according to the opinion of &s;ome natural philo&s;ophers, they might be lately come from the moon.</P>
<P N="3">3. Upon which the <HI>Sparkler</HI> bur&s;ting out into a laugh, he in&s;ulted her with &s;everal que&s;tions, rela|ting to the bigne&s;s and di&s;tance of the moon and &s;tars; and after every interrogatory would be winking upon me, and &s;miling at his &s;i&s;ter's ignorance. <HI>Jack</HI> gained his point; for the mother was plea&s;ed, and all the &s;ervants &s;tared at the learning of their young ma&s;ter. <HI>Jack</HI> was &s;o encouraged at this &s;ucce&s;s, that for the fir&s;t week he dealt wholly in paradoxes. It was a common je&s;t with him to pinch one of his &s;i&s;ter's lap-dogs, and afterwards prove he could not feel it.</P>
<P N="4">4. When the girls were &s;orting a &s;et of knots, he would demon&s;trate to them that all the ribbons were of the &s;ame colour; or rather, &s;ays <HI>Jack,</HI> of no co|lour at all. My Lady <HI>Lizard</HI> her&s;elf, though &s;he was not a little plea&s;ed with her &s;on's improvements, was one day almo&s;t angry with him; for having ac|cidentally burnt her fingers as &s;he was lighting her lamp for her tea-pot, in the mid&s;t of her angui&s;h, <HI>Jack</HI> laid hold of the opportunity to in&s;truct her that there was no &s;uch thing as heat in fire. In &s;hort, no day pa&s;&s;ed over our heads, in which <HI>Jack</HI> did not imagine he made the whole family wi&s;er than they were before.</P>
<P N="5">5. That part of his conver&s;ation which gave me the mo&s;t pain, was what pa&s;&s;ed among tho&s;e country gentlemen that came to vi&s;it us. On &s;uch occa&s;ions <HI>Jack</HI> u&s;ually took upon him to be the mouth of the
<PB N="270" REF="020531_0275_0FAFE26C7B738B20">
company; and thinking him&s;elf obliged to be very merry, would entertain us with a great many odd &s;ayings and ab&s;urdities of their college cook. I found this fellow had made a very &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon <HI>Jack's</HI> imagination which he never con&s;idered was not the ca&s;e of the re&s;t of the company, till after many repeated trials he found that his &s;tories &s;eldom made any body laugh but him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="6">6. I all this while looked upon <HI>Jack</HI> as a young tree &s;hooting out into blo&s;&s;oms before its time; the redundancy of which, though it was a little un&s;ea|&s;onable, &s;eemed to foretell an uncommon fruitfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>In order to wear out the vein of pedantry which ran through his conver&s;ation, I took him out with me one evening, and fir&s;t of all in&s;inuated to him this rule, which I had my&s;elf learned from a very great author,
<Q>To think with the wi&s;e, but talk with the vulgar.</Q>
<HI>Jack's</HI> good &s;en&s;e &s;oon made him reflect that he had expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the laughter of the ig|norant by a contrary behaviour; upon which he told me, that he would take care for the future to keep his notions to him&s;elf, and conver&s;e in the common received &s;entiments of mankind.</P>
<P N="7">7. He at the &s;ame time de&s;ired me to give him any other rules of conver&s;ation, which I thought might be for his improvement. I told him I would think of it; and accordingly, as I have a particular affec|tion for the young man, I gave him the next morning the following rules in writing, which may, perhaps, have contributed to make him the agreeable man he now is&punc;</P>
<P N="8">8. The faculty of interchanging our thoughts with one another, or what we expre&s;s by the word conver|&s;ation, has always been repre&s;ented by moral writers, as one of the noble&s;t privileges of rea&s;on, and which more particularly &s;ets mankind above the brute part of the creation</P>
<P>Though nothing &s;o much gains upon the affections <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this extempore eloquence, which we have con&s;tant|ly
<PB N="271" REF="020531_0276_0FAFE26D407A6BD8">
occa&s;ion for, and are obliged to practice every day, we very rarely meet with any who excel in it.</P>
<P N="9">9. The conver&s;ation of mo&s;t men is di&s;agreeable, not &s;o much for want of wit and learning, as of good-breeding and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>It is not in every man's power, perhaps, to have fine parts, &s;ay witty things, or tell a &s;tory agreeably; but every man may be polite if he plea&s;es, at lea&s;t to a certain degree. Politene&s;s has infinitely more power to make us e&s;teemed, and our company &s;ought after, than the mo&s;t extraordinary parts or attain|ments we can be ma&s;ter of. The&s;e &s;eldom fail to cre|ate envy, and envy has always &s;ome ill-will in it.</P>
<P N="10">10. If you re&s;olve to plea&s;e, never &s;peak to gratify any particular vanity or pa&s;&s;ion of your own, but al|ways with a de&s;ign either to divert or inform the com|pany. A man who only aims at one of the&s;e, is al|ways ea&s;y in his di&s;cour&s;e. He is never out of hu|mour at being interrupted, becau&s;e he con&s;iders that tho&s;e who hear him are the be&s;t judges whether what he was &s;aying could either divert or inform them.</P>
<P>A mode&s;t per&s;on &s;eldom fails to gain the good will of tho&s;e he conver&s;es with, becau&s;e nobody envies a a man who does not appear to be plea&s;ed with him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="11">11. We &s;hould talk extremely little of our&s;elves. Indeed what can we &s;ay? It would be as imprudent to di&s;cover faults, as ridiculous to count over our fancied virtues. Our private and dome&s;tic affairs are no le&s;s improper to be introduced in conver&s;ation. What does it concern the company how many hor&s;es you keep in your &s;tables? or whether your &s;ervant is mo&s;t knave or fool?</P>
<P N="12">12. A man may equally affront the company he is in, by engro&s;&s;ing all the talk, or ob&s;erving a con|temptuous &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Conform your&s;elf to the ta&s;te, character, and pre|&s;ent humours of the per&s;ons you conver&s;e with; not but a per&s;on mu&s;t follow his talent in conver&s;ation. Do not force nature; no one ever did it with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="020531_0277_0FAFE26DF9E15648">If you have not a talent for humour, or raillery, or &s;tory-telling, never attempt them.</P>
<P N="13">13. Contain your&s;elf al&s;o within the bounds of what you know; and never talk upon things you are ignorant of, unle&s;s it be with a view to inform your|&s;elf. A per&s;on cannot fail in the ob&s;ervance of this rule, without making him&s;elf ridiculous; and yet how often do we &s;ee it tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed! Some, who on war or politics could talk very well, will be perpe|tually haranguing on works of genius, and the belles-lettres; others who are capable of rea&s;oning, and would make a figure in grave di&s;cour&s;e, will yet con|&s;tantly aim at humour and plea&s;antry, though with the wor&s;t grace imaginable. Hence it is, that we &s;ee a man of merit &s;ometimes appear like a coxcomb, and hear a man of genius talk like a fool.</P>
<P N="14">14. Before you tell a &s;tory, it may be generally not ami&s;s to draw a &s;hort character, and give the company a true idea of the principal per&s;ons concer|ned in it; the beauty of mo&s;t things con&s;i&s;ting not &s;o much in their being &s;aid or done, as in their being &s;aid or done by &s;uch a particular per&s;on, or on &s;uch a particular occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="15">15. Notwith&s;tanding all the advantages of youth, few young people plea&s;e in conver&s;ation; the rea&s;on is, that want of experience makes them po&s;itive, and what they &s;ay, is rather with a de&s;ign to plea&s;e them&s;elves, than any one el&s;e.</P>
<P>It is certain that age it&s;elf &s;hall make many things pa&s;s well enough, which would have been laughed at in the mouth of one much younger.</P>
<P N="16">16. Nothing, however, is more in&s;upportable to men of &s;en&s;e, than an empty formal man who &s;peaks in proverbs, and decides all controver&s;ies with a &s;hort &s;entence. This piece of &s;tupidity is the more in&s;ufferable, as it puts on the air of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Great talents for conver&s;ation requires to be ac|companied with great politene&s;s. He who eclip&s;es others, owes them great civilities; and whatever a
<PB N="273" REF="020531_0278_0FAFE26EB9A49F50">
mi&s;taken vanity may tell us, it is better to plea&s;e in conver&s;ation, than to &s;hine in it.</P>
<P N="17">17. A prudent man will avoid talking much of any particular &s;cience, for which he is remarkably fa|mous. There is not, methinks, an hand&s;omer thing &s;aid of Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> in his whole life, than, that none but his intimate friends ever di&s;covered he was a great poet by his di&s;cour&s;e. Be&s;ides the decency of this rule, it is certainly founded in good policy. A man who talks of any thing he is already famous for, has little to get, but a great deal to lo&s;e.</P>
<P N="18">18. I might add, that he who is &s;ometimes &s;ilent on a &s;ubject where every one is &s;atisfied he would &s;peak well, will often be thought no le&s;s knowing in any other matters, where, perhaps, he is wholly ignorant.</P>
<P>Women are frightened at the name of argument, and are &s;ooner convinced by an happy turn, or wit|ty expre&s;&s;ion, than by demon&s;tration.</P>
<P N="19">19. Whenever you commend, add your rea&s;ons for &s;o doing; it is this which di&s;tingui&s;hes the appro|bation of a man of &s;en&s;e, from the flattery of &s;yco|phants, and admiration of fools.</P>
<P>Raillery is no longer agreeable than while the whole company is plea&s;ed with it. I would lea&s;t of all be under&s;tood to except the per&s;on raillied.</P>
<P N="20">20. Though good-humour, &s;en&s;e, and di&s;cretion can &s;eldom fail to make a man agreeable, it may be no ill-policy &s;ometimes to prepare your&s;elf in a par|ticular manner for conver&s;ation, by looking a little farther than your neighbours into whatever is be|come a reigning &s;ubject. If our armies are be&s;ieging a place of importance abroad, or our Hou&s;e of Com|mons debating a bill of con&s;equence at home, you can hardly fail of being heard with plea&s;ure, if you have nicely informed your&s;elf of the &s;tength, &s;ituati|on, and hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t, or of the rea&s;ons for and again&s;t the latter.</P>
<P N="21"><PB N="274" REF="020531_0279_0FAFE2705E941060">21. It will have the &s;ame effect if when any &s;ingle per&s;on begins to make a noi&s;e in the world, you can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arn &s;ome of the &s;malle&s;t accidents in his life or con|ver&s;ation, which, though they are too fine for the ob&s;ervation of the vulgar, give more &s;atisfaction to men of &s;en&s;e, (as they are the be&s;t openings to a real character) than the recital of his mo&s;t glaring actions. I know but one ill con&s;equence to be feared from this method, namely, that coming full charged into com|pany, you &s;hould re&s;olve to unload, whether an hand|&s;ome opportunity offers it&s;elf or no.</P>
<P N="22">22. The liberal arts, though they may po&s;&s;ibly have le&s;s effect on our external mien and behaviour, make &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind, as is very apt to bend it wholly one way.</P>
<P>The mathematician will take little le&s;s than de|mon&s;tration in the mo&s;t common di&s;cour&s;e, and the &s;choolman is as great a friend to definitions and &s;yl|logi&s;ms. The phy&s;ician and divine are often heard to dictate in private companies with the &s;ame autho|rity which they exerci&s;e over their patients and di&s;|ciples; while the lawyer is putting ca&s;es, and rai&s;ing matter for di&s;putation, out of every thing that oc|curs.</P>
<P N="23">23. Though the a&s;king of que&s;tions may plead for it&s;elf the &s;pecious name of mode&s;ty, and a de&s;ire of information, it affords little plea&s;ure to the re&s;t of the company, who are not troubled with the &s;ame doubts; be&s;ides which, he who a&s;ks a que&s;tion would do well to con&s;ider that he lies wholly at the mercy of another before he receives an an&s;wer.</P>
<P N="24">24. Nothing is more &s;illy than the plea&s;ure &s;ome people take in what they call &s;peaking their minds. A man of this make will &s;ay a rude thing for the mere plea&s;ure of &s;aying it, when an oppo&s;ite behaviour, full as innocent, might have pre&s;erved his friend, or made his fortune.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible for a man to form to him&s;elf as exqui&s;ite a plea&s;ure in complying with the humour
<PB N="275" REF="020531_0280_0FAFE270FA667080">
and &s;entiments of others, as of bringing others over to his own; &s;ince 'tis the certain &s;ign of a &s;uperior genius, that can take and become whatever dre&s;s it plea&s;es.</P>
<P N="25">25. Avoid di&s;putes as much as po&s;&s;ible, in order to appear ea&s;y and well-bred in conver&s;ation. You may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, that it requires more wit, as well as more good-humour, to improve than to contradict the notions of another; but if you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> any time obliged to enter on an argument, give your rea&s;ons with the utmo&s;t coolne&s;s and mode&s;ty, two things which &s;carce ever fail of making an impre&s;&s;ion on the hearers. Be&s;ides, if you are neither dogmatical, nor &s;hew either by your actions or words, that you are full of your&s;elf, all will the more heartily rejoice at your victory; nay, &s;hould you be pinched in your ar|gument, you may make your retreat with a very good grace: you were never po&s;itive, and are now glad to be better informed.</P>
<P N="26">26. This hath made &s;ome approve the Socratical way of rea&s;oning, where, while you &s;carce affirm a|ny thing, you can hardly be caught in an ab&s;urdity; and though po&s;&s;ibly you are endeavouring to bring over another to your opinion, which is firmly fixed, you &s;eem only to de&s;ire information from him.</P>
<P N="27">27. In order to keep that temper, which is &s;o dif|ficult, and yet &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve, you may plea&s;e to con&s;ider, that nothing can be more unju&s;t or ridiculous, than to be angry with another becau&s;e he is not of your opinion. The intere&s;ts, education, and means by which men attain their knowledge, are &s;o very different, that it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould all think alike; and he has at lea&s;t as much rea&s;on to be angry with you, as you with him.</P>
<P N="28">28. Sometimes to keep your&s;elf cool, it may be of &s;ervice to a&s;k your&s;elf fairly, what might have been your opinion, had you all the bia&s;&s;es of education and intere&s;t your adver&s;ary may po&s;&s;ibly have? But if you contend for the honour of victory alone, you may
<PB N="276" REF="020531_0281_0FAFE271BA0875E8">
lay down this as an infallible maxim, That you can|not make a more fal&s;e &s;tep, or give your antagoni&s;ts a greater advantage over you, than by falling into a pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="29">29. When an argument is over, how many weigh|ty rea&s;ons does a man recollect, which his heat and violence made him utterly forget?</P>
<P>It is yet more ab&s;urd to be angry with a man, be|cau&s;e he does not apprehend the force of your rea&s;ons, or give weak ones of his own. If you argue for re|putation; this makes your victory the ea&s;ier; he is certainly in all re&s;pects an object of your pity, rather than anger; and if he cannot comprehend what you do, you ought to thank nature for her favours, who has given you &s;o much the clearer under&s;tanding.</P>
<P N="30">30. You may plea&s;e to add this con&s;ideration, That among your equals no one values your anger, which only preys upon its ma&s;ter; and perhaps you may find it not very con&s;i&s;tent either with prudence or your ea&s;e, to puni&s;h your&s;elf whenever you meet with a fool or a knave.</P>
<P N="31">31. La&s;tly, if you propo&s;e to your&s;elf the true end of argument, which is information, it may be a &s;ea|&s;onable check to your pa&s;&s;ion; for if you &s;earch pure|ly after truth, it will be almo&s;t indifferent to you where you find it. I cannot in this place omit an ob&s;ervation which I have often made, namely, that nothing procures a man more e&s;teem and le&s;s envy from the whole company, than if he choo&s;es the part of moderator, without engaging directly on either &s;ide in a di&s;pute.</P>
<P N="32">32. This gives him the character of impartial, furni&s;hes him an opportunity of &s;itting things to the bottom, &s;hewing his judgment, and of &s;ometimes making hand&s;ome compliments to each of the con|tending parties.</P>
<P>When you have gained a victory, do not pu&s;h it too far; it is &s;ufficient to let the company and your
<PB N="277" REF="020531_0282_0FAFE27280680CB8">
adver&s;ary &s;ee it is in your power, but that you are too generous to make u&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="33">33. I &s;hall only add, that be&s;ides what I have here &s;aid, there is &s;omething which can never be learnt but in the company of the polite. The virtues of men are catching as well as their vices, and your own ob&s;ervations added to the&s;e, will &s;oon di&s;cover what it is that commands attention in one man, and makes you tired and di&s;plea&s;ed with the di&s;cour&s;e of another.</P>

<HEAD>Further Remarks taken from Lord Che&s;ter|field's Letters to his Son.</HEAD>
<P N="34">34. HAVING now given you full and &s;ufficient in&s;tructions for making you well-received in the be&s;t of companies; nothing remains but that I lay before you &s;ome few rules for your conduct in &s;uch company. Many things on this &s;ubject I have mentioned before; but &s;ome few matters remain to be mentioned now.</P>
<P>Talk, then, frequently, but not long together, le&s;t you tire the per&s;ons you are &s;peaking to; for few per&s;ons talk &s;o well upon a &s;ubject, as to keep up the attention of their hearers for any length of time.</P>
<P N="35">35. Avoid telling &s;tories in company, unle&s;s they are very &s;hort indeed, and very applicable to the &s;ubject you are upon; in this ca&s;e relate them in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, without the lea&s;t digre&s;&s;ion, and with &s;ome apology: as that you hate the telling of &s;tories, but the &s;hortne&s;s of it induced you. And, if your &s;tory has any wit in it, be particularly care|ful not to laugh at it your&s;elf. Nothing is more tire|&s;ome and di&s;agreeable than a long tedious narrative; it betrays a go&s;&s;iping di&s;po&s;ition, and great want of imagination; and nothing is more ridiculous than to expre&s;s an approbation of your own &s;tory by a laugh.</P>
<P N="36"><PB N="278" REF="020531_0283_0FAFE2733A1BC350">36. In relating any thing, keep clear of repetiti|ons, or very hackneyed expre&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> or <HI>&s;ays &s;he.</HI> Some people will u&s;e the&s;e &s;o often, as to take off the hearers attention from the &s;tory; as, in an organ out of tune, one pipe &s;hall perhaps &s;ound the whole time we are playing, and confu&s;e the piece, &s;o as not to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P N="37">37. Digre&s;&s;ions, likewi&s;e, &s;hould be guarded a|gain&s;t. A &s;tory is always more agreeable without them. Of this kind are, "<HI>the gentleman I am telling you of, is the &s;on of Sir Thomas&mdash;, who lives in Har|ley-&s;treet;&mdash;you mu&s;t know him &mdash; his brother had a hor&s;e that won the &s;weep&s;takes at the la&s;t Newmarket meeting. &mdash;Zounds! if you don't know him, you know nothing.</HI>" Or, "<HI>He was an upright tall old gentleman, who wore his own long hair; don't you recollect him?</HI>"&mdash;All this is unnece&s;&s;ary; is very tire&s;ome and provoking, and would be an excu&s;e for a man's behaviour, if he was to leave us in the mid&s;t of our narrative.</P>
<P N="38">38. Some people have a trick of holding the per|&s;ons they are &s;peaking to by the button, or the hand, in order to be heard out: con&s;cious, I &s;uppo&s;e, that their tale is tire&s;ome. Pray, never do this; If the per&s;on you &s;peak to is not as willing to hear your &s;tory, as you are to tell it, you had much better break off in the middle: for if you tire them once they will be afraid to li&s;ten to you a &s;econd time.</P>
<P N="39">39. Others have a way of punching the per&s;on they are talking to, in the &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and at the end of every &s;entence, a&s;king him &s;ome que&s;tions as the following: "Wasn't I right in that?"&mdash;"You know, I told you &s;o?&mdash;What's your opinion?" and the like; or perhaps, they will be thru&s;ting him, or jogging him with their elbow. For mercy's &s;ake, never give way to this: it will make your company dreaded.</P>
<P N="40">40. Long talkers are frequently apt to &s;ingle out &s;ome unfortunate man pre&s;ent; generally the mo&s;t &s;ilent one of the company, or probably him who &s;its
<PB N="279" REF="020531_0284_0FAFE274003E1688">
next them. To this man, in a kind of half-whi&s;per, will they run on, for half an hour together. No|thing can be more ill-bred. But, if one of the&s;e unmerciful talkers &s;hould attack you, if you wi&s;h to oblige him, I would recommend the hearing with patience: &s;eem to do &s;o at lea&s;t, for you could not hurt him more than to leave him in the middle of his &s;tory, or di&s;cover any impatience in the cour&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="41">41. Ince&s;&s;ant talkers are very di&s;agreeable com|panions. Nothing can be more rude than to engro&s;s the conver&s;ation to your&s;elf, or to take the words, as it were, out of another man's mouth. Every man in company has an equal claim to bear his part in the conver&s;ation, and to deprive him of it, is not only unju&s;t, but a tacit declaration that he cannot &s;peak &s;o well upon the &s;ubject as your&s;elf; you will therefore take it up. And, what can be more rude? I would as &s;oon forgive a man that &s;hould &s;top my mouth when I was gaping, as take my words from me while I was &s;peaking them. Now, if this be unpardonable, it cannot be le&s;s &s;o.</P>
<P N="42">42. To help out or fore&s;tall the &s;low &s;peaker, as if you alone were rich in expre&s;&s;ions and he were poor. You may take it for granted, every one is vain enough to think he can talk well, though he may mode&s;tly deny it; helping a per&s;on out there|fore in his expre&s;&s;ions, is a correction that will &s;tamp the corrector with impudence and ill-manners.</P>
<P N="43">43. Tho&s;e who contradict others upon all occa&s;i|ons, and make every a&s;&s;ertion a matter of di&s;pute, betray by this behaviour an unacquaintance with good-breeding. He therefore who wi&s;hes to appear amiable, with tho&s;e he conver&s;es with, will be cau|tious of &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e, "That can't be true, &s;ir." "The affair is as I &s;ay." "That mu&s;t be fal&s;e, &s;ir." "If what you &s;ay is true, &amp;c." You may as well tell a man he lies at once, as thus indi|rectly impeach his veracity. It is equally as rude to
<PB N="280" REF="020531_0285_0FAFE274BB7A5950">
be proving every trifling a&s;&s;ertion with a bet or a wager. "I'll bet you fifty of it, and &s;o on." Make it then a con&s;tant rule, in matters of no great impor|tance, complai&s;antly to &s;ubmit your opinion to that of others; for a victory of this kind often co&s;ts a man the lo&s;s of a friend.</P>
<P N="44">44. Giving advice una&s;ked is another piece of rudene&s;s; it is, in effect, declaring our&s;elves wi&s;er than tho&s;e to whom we give it; reproaching them with ignorance and inexperience. It is a freedom that ought not to be taken with any common ac|quaintance, and yet there are tho&s;e who will be of|fended, if their advice is not taken. "Such-a-one," &s;ay they, "is above being advi&s;ed."
<Q>He &s;corns to li&s;ten to my advice;</Q>
as if it were not a mark of greater arrogance to expect every one to &s;ubmit to their opinion than for a man &s;ometimes to follow his own.</P>
<P N="45">45. There is nothing &s;o unpardonably rude, as a &s;eeming inattention to the per&s;on who is &s;peaking to you; though you may meet with it in others, by all means, avoid it your&s;elf. Some ill-bred people, while others are &s;peaking to them, will, in&s;tead of looking at or attending to them, perhaps fix their eyes on the cieling, or &s;ome picture in the room, look out of the window, play with a dog, their watch chain, or their cane, or probably pick their nails or their no&s;es. Nothing betrays a more trifling mind than this; nor can any thing be a greater af|front to the per&s;on &s;peaking; it being a tacit decla|ration, that what he is &s;aying is not worth your at|tention. Con&s;ider with your&s;elf how you would like &s;uch treatment, and, I am per&s;uaded, you will never &s;hew it to others.</P>
<P N="46">46. Surline&s;s or moro&s;ene&s;s is incompatible al&s;o with politene&s;s. Such as, &s;hould any one &s;ay
<Q>he was de&s;ired to pre&s;ent Mr. Such-a-one's re&s;pects to you,</Q>
to reply,
<Q>What the devil have I to do with his re&s;pects?</Q>
&mdash;My Lord enquired after you
<PB N="281" REF="020531_0286_0FAFE2757A500A20">
"lately, and a&s;ked how you did," to an&s;wer,
<Q>if he wi&s;hes to know, let him come and feel my pul&s;e,</Q>
and the like. A good deal of this often is affected; but whether affected or natural, it is al|ways offen&s;ive. A man of this &s;tamp will occa&s;ional|ly be laughed at as an oddity; but in the end, will be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="47">47. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it unnece&s;&s;ary to advi&s;e you to adapt your conver&s;ation to the company you are in. You would not &s;urely &s;tart the &s;ame &s;ubject, and di&s;|cour&s;e of it in the &s;ame manner, with the old and with the young, with an officer, a clergyman, a phi|lo&s;opher, and a woman? no; your good &s;en&s;e will undoubtedly teach you to be &s;erious with the &s;erious, gay with the gay, and to trifle with the triflers.</P>
<P N="48">48. There are certain expre&s;&s;ions which are excee|dingly rude, and yet there are people of liberal edu|cation that &s;ometimes u&s;e them; as
<Q>you don't un|der&s;tand me &s;ir.</Q>
"It is not &s;o."
<Q>You mi&s;|take.</Q>
"You know nothing of the matter, &amp;c." Is it not better to &s;ay?
<Q>I believe I do not expre&s;s my&s;elf &s;o as to be under&s;tood.</Q>
<Q>Let us con&s;i|der it again, whether we take it right or not.</Q>
It is much more polite and amiable to make &s;ome ex|cu&s;e for another, even in ca&s;es where he might ju&s;tly be blamed, and to repre&s;ent the mi&s;take as common to both, rather than charge him with in&s;en&s;ibility or incomprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P N="49">49. If any one &s;hould have promi&s;ed you any thing and not have fulfilled that promi&s;e, it would be very unpolite to tell him, he has forfeited his word; or if the &s;ame per&s;on &s;hould have di&s;appointed you, upon any occa&s;ion, would it not be better to &s;ay,
<Q>you were probably &s;o much engaged, that you forgot my affair,</Q>
or "perhaps it &s;lipped your memory;" rather than, "you thought no more about it," or "you pay very little regard to your word." For, expre&s;&s;ions of this kind leave a &s;ting behind them. They are a kind of provocation and affront, and very often bring on la&s;ting quarrels.</P>
<P N="50"><PB N="282" REF="020531_0287_0FAFE2763A6904A8">50. Be careful not to appear dark and my&s;terious, le&s;t you &s;hould be thought &s;u&s;picious; than which there cannot be a more unamiable character. If you appear my&s;terious and re&s;erved, others will be truly &s;o with you; and in this ca&s;e, there is an end to im|provement, for you will gather no information. Be re&s;erved, but never &s;eem &s;o.</P>
<P N="51">51. There is a fault extremely common with &s;ome people, which I would have you avoid. When their opinion is a&s;ked upon any &s;ubject, they will give it with &s;o apparent a diffidence and timidity, that one cannot, without the utmo&s;t pain, li&s;ten to them; e&s;|pecially if they are known to be men of univer&s;al knowledge. "Your lord&s;hip will pardon me," &s;ays one of this &s;tamp,
<Q>if I &s;hould not be able to &s;peak to the ca&s;e in hand, &s;o well as it might be wi&s;h|ed.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I'll venture to &s;peak of this matter, to the be&s;t of my poor abilities and dullne&s;s of appre|hen&s;ion.</Q>&mdash;<Q>I fear I &s;hall expo&s;e my&s;elf, but in obedience to your lord&s;hip's commands</Q>&mdash;and while they are making the&s;e apologies, they inter|rupt the bu&s;ine&s;s and tire the company.</P>
<P N="52">52. Always look people in the face, when you &s;peak to them, otherwi&s;e you will be thought con|&s;cious of &s;ome guilt; be&s;ides, you lo&s;e the opportuni|ty of reading their countenances; from which you will much better learn the impre&s;&s;ion your di&s;cour&s;e makes upon them, than you can po&s;&s;ibly do from their words; for words are at the will of every one, but the countenance is frequently involuntary.</P>
<P N="53">53. If in &s;peaking to a per&s;on, you are not heard, and &s;hould be de&s;ired to repeat what you &s;aid, do not rai&s;e your voice in the repetition, le&s;t you &s;hould be thought angry, on being obliged to repeat what you had &s;aid before; it was probably owing to the hear|er's inattention.</P>
<P N="54">54. One word only, as to &s;wearing. Tho&s;e who addict them&s;elves to it, and interlard their di&s;cour&s;e with oaths, can never be con&s;idered as gentlemen;
<PB N="283" REF="020531_0288_0FAFE2770762F9D8">
they are generally people of low education, and are unwelcome in what is called good company. It is a vice that has no temptation to plead, but is, in every re&s;pect, as vulgar as it is wicked.</P>
<P N="55">55. Never accu&s;tom your&s;elf to &s;candal, nor li&s;ten to it; for though it may gratify the malevolence of &s;ome people, nine times out of ten it is attended with great di&s;advantages. The very per&s;on you tell it to will, on reflection, entertain a mean opinion of you, and it will often bring you into a very di&s;agree|able &s;ituation. And as there would be no evil &s;peak|ers, if there were no evil hearers, it is in &s;candal a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in robbery; the receiver is as bad as the thief. Be|&s;ides, it will lead people to &s;hun your company, &s;up|po&s;ing that you will &s;peak ill of them to the next ac|quaintance you meet.</P>
<P N="56">56. Carefully avoid talking either of your own or other people's dome&s;tic concerns. By doing the one, you will be thought vain; by entering into the other, you will be con&s;idered as officious. Talking of your|&s;elf is an impertinence to the company; your affairs are nothing to them; be&s;ides, they cannot be kept too &s;ecret. And as to the affairs of others, what are they to you? In talking of matters that no way con|cern you, you are liable to commit blunders, and &s;hould you touch any one in a &s;ore part, you may po&s;|&s;ibly lo&s;e his e&s;teem. Let your conver&s;ation then in mixed companies always be general.</P>
<P N="57">57. Jokes, <HI>bon-mots,</HI> or the little plea&s;antries of one company, will not often bear to be told in ano|ther; they are frequently local, and take their ri&s;e from certain circum&s;tances; a &s;econd company may not be acquainted with the&s;e circum&s;tances, and of cour&s;e your &s;tory may not be under&s;tood, or want ex|plaining; and if after you have prefaced it with, "I will tell you a good thing," the &s;ting &s;hould not be immediately perceived, you will appear exceed|ingly ridiculous, and wi&s;h you had not told it. Never then repeat in one place, what you hear in another.</P>
<P N="58"><PB N="284" REF="020531_0289_0FAFE277C4F8BC50">58. In mo&s;t debates, take up the favourable &s;ide of the que&s;tion; however, let me caution you again&s;t being clamorous, that is, never maintain an argu|ment with heat, though you know your&s;elf right; but offer your &s;entiments mode&s;tly and coolly, and if this does not prevail, give it up, and try to change the &s;ubject by &s;aying &s;omething to this effect;
<Q>I find we &s;hall hardly convince one another, neither is there any nece&s;&s;ity to attempt it; &s;o let us talk of &s;omething el&s;e.</Q></P>
<P N="59">59. Not that I would have you give up your opi|nion always; no, a&s;&s;ert your own &s;entiments, and oppo&s;e tho&s;e of others when wrong, but let your man|ner and voice be gentle and engaging, and yet no ways affected. If you contradict, do it with, <HI>I may be wrong, but&mdash;I won't be po&s;itive, but I really think&mdash; I &s;hould rather &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;if I may be permitted to &s;ay</HI>&mdash; and clo&s;e your di&s;pute with good humour, to &s;hew you are neither di&s;plea&s;ed your&s;elf, nor meant to di&s;plea&s;e the per&s;on you di&s;pute with.</P>
<P N="60">60. Acquaint your&s;elf with the character and &s;itua|tions of the company you go into, before you give a loo&s;e to your tongue; for &s;hould you enlarge on &s;ome virtue, which any one pre&s;ent may notoriou&s;ly want; or &s;hould you condemn &s;ome vice, which any of the company may be particularly addicted to, they will be apt to think your reflections pointed and per|&s;onal, and you will be &s;ure to give offence. This con&s;ideration will naturally lead you, not to &s;uppo&s;e things &s;aid in general, to be levelled at you.</P>
<P N="61">61. Low-bred people, when they happen occa&s;ion|ally to be in good company, imagine them&s;elves to be the &s;ubject of every &s;eparate conver&s;ation. If any part of the company whi&s;pers, it is about them; if they laugh, it is at them; and if any thing is &s;aid which they do not comprehend, they immediately &s;uppo&s;e it is meant of them. This mi&s;take is admir|ably ridiculed in o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f our celebrated comedies.

<P N="62"><PB N="285" REF="020531_0290_0FAFE278896B6080">62. Now, a well-bred per&s;on never thinks him&s;elf di&s;e&s;teemed by the company, or laughed at, unle&s;s their reflections are &s;o gro&s;s, that he cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to mi&s;take them, and his honour obliges him to re&s;ent it in a proper manner; however, be a&s;&s;ured, gentlemen never laugh at or ridicule one another, unle&s;s they are in joke, or on a footing of the great|e&s;t intimacy. If &s;uch a thing &s;hould happen once in an age, from &s;ome pert coxcomb, or &s;ome flippant woman, it is better not to &s;eem to know it, than make the lea&s;t reply.</P>
<P N="63">63. It is a piece of politene&s;s not to interrupt a per&s;on in a &s;tory, whether you have heard it before or not. Nay, if a well-bred man is a&s;ked whether he has heard it, he will an&s;wer no, and let the per|&s;on go on, though he knows it already. Some are fond of telling a &s;tory, becau&s;e they think they tell it well, others pride them&s;elves in being the fir&s;t tel|ler of it, and others are plea&s;ed at being thought en|tru&s;ted with it. Now, all the&s;e per&s;ons you would di&s;appoint by an&s;wering yes: and, as I have told you before, as the greate&s;t proof of politene&s;s is to make every body happy about you, I would never de|prive a per&s;on of any &s;ecret &s;atisfaction of this &s;ort, when I could gratify him by a minute's attention.</P>
<P N="64">64. Be not a&s;hamed of a&s;king que&s;tions, if &s;uch que&s;tions lead to information; always accompany them with &s;ome excu&s;e, and you never will be reckon|ed impertinent. But, abrupt que&s;tions, without &s;ome apology, by all means avoid, as they imply de&s;ign. There is a way of fi&s;hing for facts, which, if done judiciou&s;ly, will an&s;wer every purpo&s;e, &s;uch as tak|ing things you wi&s;h to know for granted; this will perhaps lead &s;ome officious per&s;on to &s;et you right. So again, by &s;aying, you have heard &s;o and &s;o, and &s;ometimes &s;eeming to know more than you do, you will often get at information, which you would lo&s;e by direct que&s;tions, as the&s;e would put people upon their guard, and frequently defeat the very end you aim at.</P>
<P N="65"><PB N="286" REF="020531_0291_0FAFE2794473F420">65. Make it a rule never to reflect on any body of people, for by this means you will create a number of enemies.

<HEAD>The Vi&s;ion of Mirza, exhibiting a Picture of Human Life.</HEAD>
<BIBL>[SPECTATOR, No. 159.</BIBL>
<P>ON the fifth day of the moon, which, according to the cu&s;tom of my forefathers, I always keep holy, after having wa&s;hed my&s;elf, and offered up my morning devotions, I a&s;cended the high hills of Bag|dat, in order to pa&s;s the re&s;t of the day in meditation and prayer. As I was here airing my&s;elf on the tops of the mountains, I fell into a profound contempla|tion on the vanity of human life; and pa&s;&s;ing from one thought to another, Surely, &s;aid I, man is but a &s;hadow, and life a dream.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whil&s;t I was thus mu&s;ing, I ca&s;t my eyes to|wards the &s;ummit of a rock that was not far from me, where I di&s;covered one in the habit of a &s;hepherd, with a little mu&s;ical in&s;trument in his hand. As I looked upon him he applied it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The &s;ound of it was exceeding &s;weet, and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpre&s;&s;ibly melodious, and altogether different from any thing I had ever heard: they put me in mind of tho&s;e heavenly airs that are played to the departed &s;ouls of good men upon their fir&s;t arrival in Paradi&s;e, to wear out the impre&s;&s;ions of the la&s;t ago|nies, and qualify them for the plea&s;ures of that hap|py place. My heart melted away in &s;ecret raptures.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="288" REF="020531_0293_0FAFE27B936B0DD8">3. I had been often told that the rock before me was the haunt of a genius; and that &s;everal had been entertained with that mu&s;ic, who had pa&s;&s;ed by it, but never heard that the mu&s;ician had before made him&s;elf vi&s;ible. When he had rai&s;ed my thoughts by tho&s;e tran&s;porting airs which he played, to ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of his conver&s;ation, as I looked upon him like one a&s;toni&s;hed, he beckoned to me, and by the waving of his hand directed me to approach the place where he &s;at.</P>
<P N="4">4. I drew near with that reverence which is due to a &s;uperior nature; and as my heart was entirely &s;ubdued by the captivating &s;trains I had heard, I fell down at his feet and wept. The genius &s;miled up|on me with a look of compa&s;&s;ion and affability that familiarized him to my imagination, and at once di&s;pelled all the fears and apprehen&s;ions with which I approached him. He lifted me from the ground, and taking me by the hand, Mirza, &s;aid he, I have heard thee in thy &s;oliloquies: follow me.</P>
<P N="5">5. He then led me to the highe&s;t pinnacle of the rock, and placing me on the top of it, ca&s;t thy eyes ea&s;tward, &s;aid he, and tell me what thou &s;ee&s;t. I &s;ee, &s;aid I, a huge valley, and a prodigious tide of water rolling through it. The valley that thou &s;e|e&s;t, &s;aid he, is the vale of mi&s;ery, and the tide of water that thou &s;ee&s;t is part of the great tide of eter|nity.</P>
<P N="6">6. What is the rea&s;on, &s;aid I, that the tide I &s;ee ri&s;es out of a thick mi&s;t at one end, and again lo&s;es it&s;elf in a thick mi&s;t at the other? What thou &s;ee&s;t, &s;aid he, is that portion of eternity which is called time, mea&s;ured out by the &s;un, and reaching from the beginning of the world to its con&s;ummation. Ex|amine now, &s;aid he, this &s;ea that is bounded with darkne&s;s at both ends, and tell me what thou di&s;co|vere&s;t in it. I &s;ee a bridge, &s;aid I, &s;tanding in the mid&s;t of the tide. The bridge thou &s;ee&s;t, &s;aid he, is human life; con&s;ider it attentively.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="289" REF="020531_0294_0FAFE27C41E250A8">7. Upon a more lei&s;urely &s;urvey of it, I found that it con&s;i&s;ted of three&s;core and ten entire arches, with &s;everal broken arches, which, added to tho&s;e that were entire, made up the number about an hundred. As I was counting the arches, the genius told me that this bridge con&s;i&s;ted at fir&s;t of a thou|&s;and arches; but that a great flood &s;wept away the te&s;t, and left the bridge in the ruinous condition I now beheld it: but tell me further, &s;aid he, what thou di&s;covere&s;t on it. I &s;ee multitudes of people pa&s;&s;ing over it, &s;aid I, and a black cloud hanging on each end of it.</P>
<P N="8">8. As I looked more attentively, I &s;aw &s;everal of the pa&s;&s;engers dropping through the bridge, into the great tide that flowed underneath it; and upon fur|ther examination, perceived there were innumerable trap-doors that lay concealed in the bridge, which the pa&s;&s;engers no &s;ooner trod upon, but they fell through them into the tide, and immediately di&s;|appeared. The&s;e hidden pit-falls were &s;et very thick at the entrance of the bridge, &s;o that throngs of people no &s;ooner broke through the cloud, but many of them fell into them. They grew thinner, towards the middle, but multiplied and lay clo&s;er together towards the end of the arches that were entire.</P>
<P N="9">9. There were indeed &s;ome per&s;ons, but their num|ber was very &s;mall, that continued a kind of hob|bling march on the broken arches, but fell through one after another, being quite tired and &s;pent with &s;o long a walk.</P>
<P N="10">10. I pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time in the contemplation of this wonderful &s;tructure, and the great variety of ob|jects which it pre&s;ented. My heart was filled with a deep melancholy to &s;ee &s;everal dropping unexpected|ly in the mid&s;t of mirth and jollity, and catching at every thing that &s;tood by them to &s;ave them&s;elves. Some were looking up towards the heavens in a thoughtful po&s;ture, and in the mid&s;t of a &s;peculation
<PB N="290" REF="020531_0295_0FAFE27D0A98F788">
&s;tumbled and fell out of &s;ight. Multitudes were very bu&s;y in the pur&s;uit of bubbles, that glittered in their eyes and danced before them; but often when they thought them&s;elves within the reach of them, their footing failed and down they &s;unk.</P>
<P N="11">11. In this confu&s;ion of objects, I ob&s;erved &s;ome with &s;cimitars in their hands, and others with urinals, who ran to and fro upon the bridge, thru&s;ting &s;everal per&s;ons on trap-doors which did not &s;eem to lie in their way, and which they might have e&s;caped had they not been thus forced upon them.</P>
<P N="12">12. The genius &s;eeing me indulge my&s;elf in this melancholy pro&s;pect, told me I had dwelt long e|nough upon it: take thine eyes off the bridge, &s;ays he, and tell me if thou &s;ee&s;t any thing thou do&s;t not comprehend. Upon looking up, what mean, &s;aid I, tho&s;e great flights of birds that are perpetually ho|vering about the bridge, and &s;ettling upon it from time to time? I &s;ee vultures, harpies, ravens, cor|morants, and among many other feathered creatures &s;everal little winged boys, that perch in great num|bers upon the middle arches. The&s;e, &s;aid the genius, are envy, avarice, &s;uper&s;tition, de&s;pair, love, with the like cares and pa&s;&s;ions that infe&s;t human life.</P>
<P N="13">13. I here fetched a deep &s;igh: Alas, &s;aid I, man was made in vain! how is he given away to mi&s;ery and mortality! tortured in life, and &s;wallowed up in death! The genius being moved with compa&s;&s;ion towards me, bid me quit &s;o uncomfortable a pro&s;pect. Look no more, &s;aid he, on man in the fir&s;t &s;tage of his exi&s;tence, in his &s;etting out for eternity; but ca&s;t thine eye on that thick mi&s;t into which the tide bears the &s;everal generations of mortals that fall into it.</P>
<P N="14">14. I directed my &s;ight as I was ordered, and (whether or no the good genius &s;trengthened it with any &s;upernatural force, or di&s;&s;ipated part of the mi&s;t that was before too thick for the eye to penetrate) I &s;aw the valley opening at the farther end, and &s;pread|ing forth into an immen&s;e ocean, that had a huge
<PB N="291" REF="020531_0296_0FAFE27DC8A67E28">
rock of adamant running through the mid&s;t of it, and dividing it into two equal parts. The clouds &s;till re&s;t|ed on one half of it, in&s;omuch that I could di&s;cover nothing in it; but the other appeared to me a va&s;t ocean planted with innumerable i&s;lands, that were covered with fruits and flowers, and interwoven with a thou&s;and little &s;hining &s;eas that ran among them.</P>
<P N="15">15. I could &s;ee per&s;ons dre&s;&s;ed in glorious habits with garlands upon their heads, pa&s;&s;ing among the trees, lying down by the &s;ides of fountains, or re&s;t|ing on beds of flowers: and could hear a confu&s;ed harmony of &s;inging birds, falling waters, human voices, and mu&s;ical in&s;truments. Gladne&s;s grew in me at the di&s;covery of &s;o delightful a &s;cene. I wi&s;hed for the wings of an eagle, that I might fly away to tho&s;e happy &s;eats; but the genius told me, there was no pa&s;&s;age to them, except through the gates of death that I &s;aw opening every moment upon the bridge.</P>
<P N="16">16. The i&s;lands, &s;aid he, that lie &s;o fre&s;h and green before thee, and with which the whole face of the ocean appears &s;potted as far as thou can&s;t &s;ee, are more in number than the &s;and on the &s;ea &s;hore; there are myriads of i&s;lands behind tho&s;e which thou here di&s;covere&s;t, reaching further than thine eye, or even thine imagination can extend it&s;elf. The&s;e are the man&s;ions of good men after death, who, according to the degree and kinds of virtue in which they ex|celled, are di&s;tributed among the&s;e &s;everal i&s;lands, which abound with plea&s;ures of different kinds, and degrees, &s;uitable to the reli&s;hes and perfections of tho&s;e who are &s;ettled in them; every i&s;land is a para|di&s;e accommodated to its re&s;pective inhabitants.</P>
<P N="17">17. Are not the&s;e, O Mirza, habitations worth contending for? Does life appear mi&s;erable, that gives thee opportunities of earning &s;uch a reward? Is death to be feared that will convey thee to &s;o hap|py an exi&s;tence? Think not man was made in vain, who has &s;uch an eternity re&s;erved for him. I gazed with inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure on the&s;e happy i&s;lands.
<PB N="292" REF="020531_0297_0FAFE27E8687D060">
At length, &s;aid I, &s;hew me now, I be&s;eech thee, the &s;ecrets that lie hid under tho&s;e dark clouds, which cover the ocean on the other &s;ide of the rock of adamant.</P>
<P N="18">18. The genius making me no an&s;wer, I turned about to addre&s;s my&s;elf to him a &s;econd time, but I found that he had left me; I then turned again to the vi&s;ion which I had been &s;o long contemplating: but in&s;tead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge, and the happy i&s;lands, I &s;aw nothing but the long hollow valley of Bagdat, with oxen, &s;heep and camels grazing upon the &s;ides of it.</P>

<HEAD>Riches not productive of Happine&s;s; the Story of Ortogrul of Ba&s;ra.</HEAD>
<BIBL>[IDLER, No. 99.</BIBL>
<P N="1">1. AS Ortogrul of Ba&s;ra was one day wandering along the &s;treets of Bagdat, mu&s;ing on the varieties of merchandize which the &s;hops offered to his view, and ob&s;erving the different occupations which bu&s;ied the multitudes on every &s;ide, he was awakened from the tranquility of meditation by a croud that ob&s;tructed his pa&s;&s;age. He rai&s;ed his eyes and &s;aw the chief Vi&s;ier, who, having returned from the Divan, was entering his palace.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ortogrul mingled with the attendants, and being &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ome petition for the Vi&s;ier, was permitted to enter. He &s;urveyed the &s;paciou&s;|ne&s;s of the apartments, admired the walls hung with golden tape&s;try, and the floors covered with &s;ilken carpets, and de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;imple neatne&s;s of his own little habitation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Surely, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, this palace is the &s;eat of happine&s;s, where plea&s;ure &s;ucceeds to plea&s;ure, and di&s;content and &s;orrow can have no admi&s;&s;ion. Whatever nature has provided for the delight of
<PB N="293" REF="020531_0298_0FAFE27F4763E820">
&s;en&s;e, is here &s;pread forth to be enjoyed. What can mortals hope or imagine which the ma&s;ter of this palace has not obtained? The di&s;hes of luxury cover his table, the voice of harmony lulls him in his bow|ers; he breathes the fragrance of the groves of Java, and &s;leeps upon the down of the cygnets of Ganges. He &s;peaks and his mandate is obeyed; he wi&s;hes, and his wi&s;h is gratified! all whom he &s;ees obey him, and all whom he hears flatter him.</P>
<P N="4">4. How different, Ortogrul, is thy condition, who art doomed to the perpetual torments of un&s;atisfied de&s;ire, and who ha&s;t no amu&s;ement in thy power that can withhold thee from thy own reflections! They tell thee that thou art wi&s;e, but what does wi&s;dom avail with poverty? None will flatter the poor, and the wi&s;e have very little power of flattering them|&s;elves. That man is &s;urely the mo&s;t wretched of the &s;ons of wretchedne&s;s who lives with his own faults and follies always before him, and who has none to re|concile him to him&s;elf by prai&s;e and veneration. I have long &s;ought content and have not found it; I will from this moment endeavour to be rich.</P>
<P N="5">5. Full of his new re&s;olution, he &s;hut him&s;elf in his chamber for &s;ix months, to deliberate how he &s;hould grow rich; he &s;ometimes propo&s;ed to offer him&s;elf as a coun&s;ellor to one of the kings of India, and &s;ometimes re&s;olved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o dig for diamonds in the mines of Golconda. One day, after &s;ome hours pa&s;&s;ed in violent fluctuation of opinion, &s;leep in&s;en|&s;ibly &s;eized him in his chair; he dreamed that he was ranging a de&s;art country in &s;earch of &s;ome one that might teach him to grow rich; and as he &s;tood on the top of a hill &s;haded with &s;ypre&s;s, in doubt whi|ther to direct his &s;teps, his father appeared on a &s;ud|den &s;tanding before him.</P>
<P N="6">6. Ortogrul, &s;aid the old man, I know thy per|plexity; li&s;ten to thy father; turn thine eye on the oppo&s;ite mountain. Ortogrul looked, and &s;aw a tor|rent tumbling down the rocks, roaring with the noi&s;e
<PB N="294" REF="020531_0299_0FAFE1527A35FA40">
of thunder, and &s;cattering its foam on the impending woods. Now, &s;aid his father, behold the valley that lies between the hills.</P>
<P N="7">7. Ortogrul looked and e&s;pied a little well, out of which i&s;&s;ued a &s;mall rivulet. Tell me now, &s;aid his father, do&s;t thou wi&s;h for &s;udden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the mountain torrent, or for a &s;low and gradual encrea&s;e, re&s;embling the rill gliding from the well? Let me be quickly rich, &s;aid Orto|grul; let the golden &s;tream be quick and violent.</P>
<P N="8">8. Look round thee, &s;aid his father, once again. Ortogrul looked, and perceived the channel of the torrent dry and du&s;ty; but following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake, which the &s;up|ply, &s;low and con&s;tant, kept always full. He waked, and determined to grow rich by &s;ilent profit and per|&s;evering indu&s;try.</P>
<P N="9">9. Having &s;old his patrimony, he engaged in mer|chandize, and in twenty years purcha&s;ed lands on which he rai&s;ed a hou&s;e, equal in &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s to that of the Vi&s;ier, to which he invited all the mini|&s;ters of plea&s;ure, expecting to enjoy all the felicity which he had imagined riches able to afford. Lei|&s;ure &s;oon made him weary of him&s;elf, and he longed to be per&s;uaded that he was great and happy. He was courteous and liberal; he gave all that approach|ed him hopes of plea&s;ing him, and all who &s;hould plea&s;e him hopes of being rewarded. Every art of prai&s;e was tried, and every &s;ource of adulatory fiction was exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P N="10">10. Ortogrul heard his flatterers without delight, becau&s;e he found him&s;elf unable to believe them. His own heart told him its frailties, his own under|&s;tanding reproached him with his faults. How long, &s;aid he, with a deep &s;igh, have I been labouring in vain to ama&s;s wealth which at la&s;t is u&s;ele&s;s! Let no man hereafter wi&s;h to be rich, who is already too wi&s;e to be flattered.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ROMULUS</HI> the founder of <HI>Rome,</HI> after building the city, re&s;olved to &s;ubmit the form of its government to the choice of the people; and therefore, calling the citizens together, he harangued them thus.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF all the &s;trength of cities lay in the height of their ramparts, or the depth of their ditches, we &s;hould have great rea&s;on to be in fear for that which we have now built. Are there in reality any walls too high to be &s;caled by a valiant enemy? And of what u&s;e are ramparts in inte&s;tine divi&s;ions? They may &s;erve for a defence again&s;t &s;udden incur&s;ions from abroad: But it is by courage and prudence chiefly, that the inva&s;ions of foreign enemies are re|pelled; and by unanimity, &s;obriety, and ju&s;tice, that dome&s;tic &s;editions are prevented. Cities fortified by the &s;tronge&s;t bulwarks, have been often &s;een to yield to force from without, or to tumults from within. An exact military di&s;cipline, and a &s;teady ob&s;ervance of civil polity, are the &s;ure&s;t barriers again&s;t the&s;e evils. But there is &s;till another point of great importance to be con&s;idered. The pro&s;perity of &s;ome ri&s;ing colo|nies, and the &s;peedy ruin of others, have in a great mea&s;ure been owing to their form of government. Was there but one manner of ruling &s;tates and cities that could make you happy, the choice would not be difficult; but I have learnt, that of the various forms of government among the Greeks and Barbarians, there are three which are highly extolled by tho&s;e who have experienced them; and yet, that no one of tho&s;e is in all re&s;pects perfect; but each of them has &s;ome innate and incurable defect. Chu&s;e you then in what manner this city &s;hall be governed. Shall it be by one man? Shall it be by a &s;elect num|ber of the wi&s;e&s;t amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g us? or &s;hall the legi&s;lative power be in the people? As for me, I &s;hall &s;ubmit

to whatever form of admini&s;tration you &s;hall plea&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h. As I think my&s;elf not unworthy to com|mand, &s;o neither am I unwilling to obey.

<P>While <HI>Quinctius Capitolinus</HI> and <HI>Agrippa Furius</HI> were Con&s;uls at <HI>Rome,</HI> the differences betwixt the Senate and people ran &s;o high, that the <HI>Aequi</HI> and <HI>Vol&s;ci,</HI> taking advantage of their inte&s;tine di&s;orders, ravaged the country to the very gates of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Tribunes of the people forbad the nece&s;&s;ary levies of troops to oppo&s;e them. <HI>Quinctius,</HI> a Senator of great reputation, well beloved, and now in his fourth con&s;ulate, got the better of this oppo&s;ition by the fol|lowing &s;peech.</P>

<P>THOUGH I am not con&s;cious, O Romans, of any crime by me committed, it is yet with the utmo&s;t &s;hame and confu&s;ion that I appear in your a&s;|&s;embly.

The cour&s;e of our manners in|deed, and the &s;tate of our affairs, have long been &s;uch, that I had no rea&s;on to pre&s;age much good: But could I have imagined, that &s;o great an ignomi|ny wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld have befallen me this year, I would by death or bani&s;hment (if all the other means had fail|ed) have avoided the &s;tation I am now in&punc; What! might Rome then have been taken, if tho&s;e men who were at our gates had not wanted courage for the attempt!&mdash;Rome taken while I was con&s;ul.&mdash;Of ho|nours I had &s;ufficient,&mdash;of life enough,&mdash;more than enough.&mdash;I &s;hould have died in my third con&s;ulate.

The con&s;uls, or you, Romans? If <HI>we</HI> are in the fault, depo&s;e us, or puni&s;h us yet more &s;everely.

<P>IT is but too common, my countrymen, to ob&s;erve a material difference, between the behaviour of tho&s;e, who &s;tand candidates for places of power and tru&s;t, before, and after their obtaining them. They &s;olicit them, in one manner; and execute them, in another. They &s;et out, with a great appearance of activity, humility, and moderation; and they, quick|ly, fall into &s;loth, pride, and avarice.&mdash;It is, un|doubtedly,
<PB N="299" REF="020531_0304_0FAFE156F9A5A508">
no ea&s;y matter, to di&s;charge, to the ge|neral &s;atisfaction, the duty of a &s;upreme commander in trouble&s;ome times. I am, I hope, duly &s;en&s;ible of the importance of the office I propo&s;e to take upon me, for the &s;ervice of my country. To carry on, with effect, an expen&s;ive war, and yet be frugal of the public money; to oblige tho&s;e to &s;erve, whom it may be delicate to offend; to conduct, at the &s;ame time, a complicated variety of operations; to concert mea|&s;ures at home, an&s;werable to the &s;tate of things a|broad; and to gain every valuable end, in &s;pite of oppo&s;ition from the envious, the factious, and the di&s;affected; to do all this, my countrymen, is more difficult, than is generally thought.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the di&s;advantages, which are common to me, with all others in eminent &s;tations, my ca&s;e is, in this re&s;pect, peculiarly hard; that, whereas a commander of Patrician rank, if he is guilty of a neglect, or breach of duty, has his great connections, the antiquity of his family, the important &s;ervices of his ance&s;tors, and the multitudes he has, by power, engaged in his intere&s;t, to &s;creen him from condign puni&s;hment; my whole &s;afety depends upon my&s;elf: which renders it the more indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary for me, to take care that my conduct be clear and unex|ceptionable. Be&s;ides, I am well aware, my country|men, that the eye of the public is upon me; and that, though the impartial, who prefer the real ad|vantage of the commonwealth to all other con&s;idera|tions, favour my preten&s;ions, the Patricians want nothing &s;o much, as an occa&s;ion again&s;t me. It is, therefore, my fixed re&s;olution, to u&s;e my be&s;t endea|vours, that you be not di&s;appointed in me, and that their indirect de&s;igns again&s;t me may be defeated.</P>
<P>I have from my youth, been familiar with toils, and with dangers. I was faithful to your intere&s;ts, my countrymen, when I &s;erved you for no reward, but that of honour. It is not my de&s;ign to betray you, now that you have conferred upon me a place

of profit. You have committed to my conduct, the war again&s;t Jugurtha. The Patricians are offended at this. But, where would be the wi&s;dom of giving &s;uch a command to one of their honourable body? a per&s;on of illu&s;trious birth, of ancient family, of in|numerable &s;tatues, but&mdash;of no experience! What &s;ervice would his long line of dead ance&s;tors, or his multitude of motionle&s;s &s;tatues, do his country in the day of battle? What could &s;uch a general do, but, in his trepidation and inexperience, have recour&s;e to &s;ome inferior commander, for direction in difficulties to which he was not him&s;elf equal? Thus, your Pa|trician general would, in fact, have a general over him; &s;o that, the acting commander would &s;till be a Plebeian. So true is this, my countrymen, that I have, my&s;elf, known tho&s;e, who have been cho&s;en con&s;uls, begin, then, to read the hi&s;tory of their own country, of which, till that time, they were totally ignorant: that is, they fir&s;t obtained the employ|ment, and then bethought them&s;elves of the qualifi|cations nece&s;&s;ary for the proper di&s;charge of it.</P>
<P>I &s;ubmit to your judgment, Romans, on which &s;ide the advantage lies, when a compari&s;on is made be|tween Patrician haughtine&s;s, and Plebeian experi|ence. The very actions, which they have only read, I have partly &s;een, and partly my&s;elf atchieved. What they know by reading, I know by action. They are plea&s;ed to &s;light my mean birth: I de&s;pi&s;e their mean characters. Want of birth and fortune, is the objection again&s;t me: want of per&s;onal worth, again&s;t them. But are not all men of the &s;ame &s;pecies? What can make a difference between one man and another, but the endowments of the mind? For my part, I &s;hall always look upon the brave&s;t man as the noble&s;t man. Suppo&s;e it were enquired of the fathers of &s;uch Patricians as Albinus and Be&s;tia, whether, if they had their choice, they would de&s;ire &s;ons of their character, or of mine&punc; what would they an&s;wer, but that they &s;hould wi&s;h the worthie&s;t to be their &s;ons?
<PB N="301" REF="020531_0306_0FAFE1587ADFE258">
If the Patricians have rea&s;on to de&s;pi&s;e me, let them, likewi&s;e, de&s;pi&s;e their ance&s;tors, who&s;e nobility was the fruit of their virtue. Do they envy the honours be&s;towed upon me? Let them envy, likewi&s;e, my la|bours, my ab&s;tinence, and the dangers I have under|gone for my country, by which I have acquired them. But tho&s;e worthle&s;s men, lead &s;uch a life of inactivity, as if they de&s;pi&s;ed any honours you can be&s;tow; whil&s;t they a&s;pire to honours, as if they had de&s;erved them by the mo&s;t indu&s;trious virtue.

<HEAD>DEMOSTHENES TO THE ATHENIANS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I compare, Athenians, the &s;peeches of &s;ome among&s;t us, with their actions, I am at a lo&s;s to reconcile what I &s;ee, with what I hear. Their prote&s;tations are full of zeal again&s;t the public enemy; but their mea&s;ures are &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent, that all their profe&s;&s;ions become &s;u&s;pected. By confound|ing you with a variety of projects, they perplex your re&s;olutions; and lead you from executing what is in your power, by engaging you in &s;chemes not reduci|ble to practice.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there was a time, when we were power|ful enough, not only to defend our own borders, and protect our allies, but even to invade Philip in his own dominions. Yes, Athenians, there was &s;uch a juncture; I remember it well. But, by neglect of proper opportunities, we are no longer in a &s;ituation to be invaders: it will be well for us, if we can pro|vide for our own defence, and our allies. Never did any conjuncture require &s;o much prudence as this. However, I &s;hould not de&s;pair of &s;ea&s;onable remedies, had I the art to prevail with you to be unanimous in right mea&s;ures. The opportunities, which have &s;o often e&s;caped us, have not been lo&s;t, through igno|rance, or want of judgment; but through negligence, or treachery.&mdash;If I a&s;&s;ume, at this time, more than ordinary liberty of &s;peech, I conjure you to &s;uffer, patiently, tho&s;e truths, which have no other end, but your own good. You have too many rea&s;ons to be &s;en&s;ible, how much you have &s;uffered, by harkening to &s;ycophants. I &s;hall, therefore, be plain, in lay|ing before you the grounds of pa&s;t mi&s;carriages, in order to correct you in your future conduct.</P>
<P>You may remember, it is not above three or four years, &s;ince we had the news of Philip's laying &s;iege to the fortre&s;s of Juno in Thrace. It was, as I think, in October we received this intelligence. We voted an immediate &s;upply of three&s;core talents: forty
<PB N="303" REF="020531_0308_0FAFE159FA382CC0">
men of war were ordered to &s;ea: and &s;o zealous we were, that preferring the nece&s;&s;ities of &s;tate to our very laws, our citizens above the age of five-and-forty years, were commanded to &s;erve. What fol|lowed?&mdash;A whole year was &s;pent idly, without any thing done; and it was but the third month of the following year, a little after the celebration of the fea&s;t of Ceres, that Charedemus &s;et &s;ail, furni&s;hed with no more than five talents, and ten galleys not half-manned.</P>
<P>A rumour was &s;pread, that Philip was &s;ick. That rumour was followed by another, that Philip was dead. And, then, as if all danger died with him, you dropped your preparations: whereas, then, then was your time to pu&s;h, and be active; then was your time to &s;ecure your&s;elves, and confound him at once. Had your re&s;olutions, taken with &s;o much heat, been as warmly &s;econded by action, you had then been as terrible to Philip, as Philip, recovered, is now to you. "To what purpo&s;e, at this time, the&s;e reflec|tions? What is done, cannot be undone." But, by your leave, Athenians, though pa&s;t moments are not to be recalled, pa&s;t errors may be repeated. Have we not, now, a fre&s;h provocation to war? Let the memory of over&s;ights, by which you have &s;uffered &s;o much, in&s;truct you to be more vigilant in the pre&s;ent danger. If the Olynthians are not in&s;tantly &s;uccour|ed, and with your utmo&s;t efforts, you become a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants to Philip, and &s;erve him more effectually, than he can help him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is not, &s;urely, nece&s;&s;ary to warn you, that votes alone, can be of no con&s;equence. Had your re&s;olu|tions, of them&s;elves, the virtue to compa&s;s what you intend, we &s;hould not &s;ee them multiply every day, as they do, and upon every occa&s;ion, with &s;o little effect: nor would Philip be in a condition to brave and affront us in this manner.&mdash;Proceed, then, Athe|nians, to &s;upport your deliberations with vigour. You have heads, capable of advi&s;ing what is be&s;t;
<PB N="304" REF="020531_0309_0FAFE15ABB6BE230">
you have judgment and experience, to di&s;cern what is right; and you have power and opportunity, to execute what you determine. What time &s;o proper for action? What occa&s;ion &s;o happy? And when can you hope for &s;uch another, if this be neglected? Has not Philip, contrary to all treaties, in&s;ulted you in Thrace? Does he not, at this in&s;tant, &s;traiten and invade your confederates, whom you have &s;olemnly &s;worn to protect? Is he not an implacable enemy? a faithle&s;s ally? the u&s;urper of provinces, to which has no title nor pretence? a &s;tranger, a barbarian, a tyrant? and, indeed, what is he not?</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve, I be&s;eech you, men of Athens, how diffe|rent your conduct appears, from the practices of your ance&s;tors. They were friends to truth and plain dealing, and dete&s;ted flattery and &s;ervile compliance. By unanimous con&s;ent, they continued arbiters of all Greece, for the &s;pace of forty-five years, without in|terruption: a public fund, of no le&s;s than ten thou|&s;and talents, was ready for any emergency: they ex|erci&s;ed over the kings of Macedon, that authority which is due to barbarians; obtained both by &s;ea and land, in their own per&s;ons, frequent and &s;ignal vic|tories; and by their noble exploits, tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, an immortal memory of their virtue, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+perior to the reach of malice and detraction. It is to them we owe that great number of public edifices, by which the city of Athens exceeds all the re&s;t of the world, in beauty and magnificence. It is to them we owe &s;o many &s;tately temples, &s;o richly em|belli&s;hed; but, above all, adorned with the &s;poils of vanqui&s;hed enemies. &mdash;But, vi&s;it their own private ha|bitations. Vi&s;it the hou&s;es of Ari&s;tides, Militiades, or any other of tho&s;e patriots of antiquity; you will find nothing, not the lea&s;t mark or ornament, to di&s;|tingui&s;h them from their neighbours. They took part in the government, not to enrich them&s;elves, but the public; they had no &s;chemes or ambition, but for the public; nor knew any intere&s;t, but the
<PB N="305" REF="020531_0310_0FAFE15B7B6B0F40">
public. It was by a clo&s;e and &s;teady application to the general good of their country; by an exemplary piety toward the immortal gods; by a &s;trict faith, and religious hone&s;ty, betwixt man and man; and a moderation, always uniform, and of a piece; they e&s;tabli&s;hed that reputation, which remains to this day, and will la&s;t to utmo&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Such, O men of Athens! were your ance&s;tors: &s;o glorious in the eye of the world; &s;o bountiful and munificent to their country; &s;o &s;paring, &s;o mode&s;t, &s;o &s;elf-denying to them&s;elves. What re&s;emblance can we find, in the pre&s;ent generation, of the&s;e great men? At a time, when your ancient competitors have left you a clear &s;tage; when the Lacedemonians are di&s;abled; the Thebans employed in troubles of their own; when no other &s;tate whatever is in a con|dition to rival or mole&s;t you; in &s;hort, when you are at full liberty; when you have the opportunity and the power to become once more the &s;ole arbiters of Greece; you permit, patiently, whole provinces to be wre&s;ted from you; you lavi&s;h the public money to &s;candalous and ob&s;cure u&s;es; you &s;uffer your allies to peri&s;h in time of peace, whom you pre&s;erved in time of war; and, to &s;um up all, you your&s;elves, by your mercenary court, and &s;ervile re&s;ignation to the will and plea&s;ure of de&s;igning, in&s;idious leaders, abe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, encourage, and &s;trengthen the mo&s;t dangerous and formidable of your enemies.

Have not &s;ome of the&s;e up&s;tarts built private hou&s;es and &s;eats, vying with the mo&s;t &s;umptuous of our public palaces? And how have their fortunes and their power increa&s;|ed, but as the commonwealth has been ruined and impoveri&s;hed!</P>
<P>To what are we to impute the&s;e di&s;orders? and to what cau&s;e a&s;&s;ign the decay of a &s;tate, &s;o powerful and flouri&s;hing in pa&s;t time?&mdash;The rea&s;on is plain. The &s;ervant is now become the ma&s;ter. The magi&s;|trate was then &s;ub&s;ervient to the people: puni&s;hments and rewards, were properties of the people: all ho|nours, dignities, and preferments, were di&s;po&s;ed by the voice and favour of the people. But the magi&s;|trate, now, has u&s;urped the right of the people, and exerci&s;es an arbitrary authority over his ancient and natural lord. You mi&s;erable people! the mean while, without money, without friends; from being the ruler, are become the &s;ervant; from being the ma&s;ter, the dependant; happy that the&s;e governors, into who&s;e hands you have thus re&s;igned your own power, are &s;o good, and &s;o gracious, as to continue your poor allowance to &s;ee plays.</P>
<P>Believe me, Athenians, if, recovering from this lethargy, you would a&s;&s;ume the ancient freedom and &s;pirit of your fathers; if you would be your own &s;ol|diers, and your own commanders, confiding no lon|ger your affairs in foreign or mercenary hands; if you would charge your&s;elves with your own defence, employing abroad, for the public, what you wa&s;te in unprofitable plea&s;ures at home; the world might, once more, behold you making a figure worthy of Athenians.
<Q>You would have us then (you &s;ay) do &s;ervice in our armies, in our own per&s;ons; and for
<PB N="307" REF="020531_0312_0FAFE15CF9B5B650">
&s;o doing, you would have the pen&s;ions we receive in time of peace, accepted as pay in time of war. Is it thus we are to under&s;tand you?</Q>&mdash;Yes, Athe|nians, 'tis my plain meaning. I would make it a &s;tanding rule, that no per&s;on, great or little, &s;hould be the better for the public money, who &s;hould grudge to employ it for the public &s;ervice. Are we in peace? the public is charged with your &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Are we in war, or under a nece&s;&s;ity, as at this time, to enter into a war? let your gratitude oblige you to accept, as pay, in defence of your benefactors, what you re|ceive, in peace, as mere bounty.&mdash;Thus, without any innovation; without altering or aboli&s;hing any thing, but pernicious novelties, introduced for the encour|agement of &s;loth and idlene&s;s; by converting only for the future, the &s;ame funds, for the u&s;e of the &s;er|viceable, which are &s;pent, at pre&s;ent, upon the un|profitable; you may be well &s;erved in your armies; your troops regularly paid; ju&s;tice duly admini&s;ter|ed; the public revenues reformed, and increa&s;ed; and every member of the commonwealth, rendered u&s;eful to his country, according to his age and abi|lity, without any further burden to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>This, O men of Athens! is what my duty prompt|ed me to repre&s;ent to you upon this occa&s;ion.&mdash;May the gods in&s;pire you to determine upon &s;uch mea&s;ures, as may be mo&s;t expedient, for the particular and ge|neral good of our country!</P>

<P>QUintillian &s;ays, that he has included almo&s;t all the duty of &s;cholars in this one piece of advice which he gives them, to love tho&s;e who teach them, as they love the &s;ciences which they learn of them; and to look upon them as fathers, from whom they derive not the life of the body, but that in&s;truction which is in a manner the life of the &s;oul. Indeed this &s;en|timent of affection and re&s;pect &s;uffices to make them apt to learn during the time of their &s;tudies, and

full of gratitude all the re&s;t of their lives. It &s;eems to me to include a great part of what is to be expect|ed from them.</P>
<P>Docility, which con&s;i&s;ts in &s;ubmitting to directi|ons, in readily receiving the in&s;tructions of their ma&s;ters, and reducing them to practice, is properly the virtue of &s;cholars, as that of ma&s;ters is to teach well. The one can do nothing without the other; and as it is not &s;ufficient for a labourer to &s;ow the &s;eed, unle&s;s the earth, after having opened its bo|&s;om to receive it, in a manner hatches, warms, and moi&s;tens it; &s;o likewi&s;e the whole fruit of in&s;truction depends upon a good corre&s;pondence between the ma&s;ters and the &s;cholars.</P>
<P>Gratitude for tho&s;e who have laboured in our edu|cation, is the character of an hone&s;t man, and the mark of a good heart. Who is there among us, &s;ays Cicero, that has been in&s;tructed with any care, that is not highly delighted with the &s;ight, or even the bare remembrance of his preceptors, ma&s;ters, and the place where he was taught and brought up? Seneca exhorts young men to pre&s;erve always a great re&s;pect for their ma&s;ters, to who&s;e care they are in|debted for the amendment of their faults, and for having imbibed &s;entiments of honour and probity. Their exactne&s;s and &s;everity di&s;plea&s;e &s;ometimes, at an age when we are not in a condition to judge of the obligations we owe to them; but when years have ripened our under&s;tanding and judgment, we then di&s;cern that what made us di&s;like them, I mean admonitions, reprimands, and a &s;evere exactne&s;s in re&s;training the pa&s;&s;ions of an imprudent and incon&s;i|derate age, is expre&s;sly the very thing which &s;hould make us e&s;teem and love them. Thus we &s;ee that Marcus Aurelius, one of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t illu&s;tri|ous emperors that Rome ever had, thanked the gods for two things e&s;pecially &mdash;for his having had excel|lent tutors him&s;elf, and that he had found the like for his children.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="020531_0315_0FAFE15F3A8CAD90">Quintillian, after having noted the different cha|racters of the mind in children, draws, in a few words, the image of what he judged to be a perfect &s;cholar; and certainly it is a very amiable one: "For my part," &s;ays he, "I like a child who is encouraged by commendation, is animated by a &s;en&s;e of glory, and weeps when he is outdone. A noble emulation will always keep him in exerci&s;e, a reprimand will touch him to the quick, and honour will &s;erve in&s;tead of a &s;pur. We need not fear that &s;uch a &s;cholar will ever give him&s;elf up to &s;ullenne&s;s." Mihi ille detur puer, quem laus excitet, quem glo|ria juvet, qui virtus fleat. Hic erit alendus ambi|tu: hunc mordebit objurgatio; hunc honor excitabit: in hoc de&s;idiam nunquam verebor.</P>
<P>How great a value &s;oever Quintillian &s;ets upon the talents of the mind, he e&s;teems tho&s;e of the heart far beyond them, and looks upon the others as of no va|lue without them.
