<HEAD>OF THE CHOLERA.</HEAD>
<P>THE chief &s;ymptoms in this di&s;ea&s;e are a vomiting and purging concurring together, or fre|quently alternating with one another. And the eva|cuations both upwards and downwards are manife&s;tly mixed with bile.</P>
<P>From this la&s;t circum&s;tance the di&s;ea&s;e appears to depend upon an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of bile, and its copious effu&s;ion into the alimentary canal.</P>
<P>This effu&s;ion of bile irritates, and excites the motions abovementioned.</P>
<P>When the di&s;ea&s;e begins with violence the &s;pa&s;modic contractions of the inte&s;tines are &s;oon communicated to the abdominal mu&s;cles, and very frequently to tho&s;e of the limbs. In this manner the di&s;ea&s;e frequently in|crea&s;es rapidly in violence, till the &s;trength of the patient is greatly and often &s;uddenly exhau&s;ted, while a coldne&s;s of the extremities, cold &s;weats, and faintings coming on, an end is put to the patient's life, &s;ome|times in the cour&s;e of one day.</P>
<P>In other ca&s;es the di&s;ea&s;e is le&s;s violent, continues for a day or two, and then cea&s;es by degrees; though &s;uch recoveries &s;eldom happen without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of re|medies.</P>
<P>In many ca&s;es of young children a diarrhoea returns after the vomiting has cea&s;ed, and after continuing to harra&s;s the patient for many weeks, proves fatal.</P>
<P>The attack of this di&s;ea&s;e is not preceded or accom|panied with febrile &s;ymptoms, and though during its cour&s;e, both the pul&s;e and re&s;piration are frequent and irregular, yet the&s;e &s;ymptoms are generally &s;o en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irely

removed by the remedies that relieve the &s;pa&s;modic af|fections peculiar to the di&s;ea&s;e, as to leave no ground for &s;uppo&s;ing that it had been accompanied by, or was connected with that a&s;&s;emblage of &s;ymptoms which de|&s;ignate fever.</P>
<P>Dr. Sydenham con&s;idered the appearances of the Cholera in England to be confined to the month of Augu&s;t, and ob&s;erves, that in proportion to the heat of the air, the violence of the di&s;ea&s;e was greater.</P>
<P>In Philadelphia it is mo&s;t prevalent in the month of July, but ca&s;es frequently occur in June and Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances, and from the facts &s;tated by Tropical writers, it appears evident that this di&s;ea&s;e is the effect of a warmer atmo&s;phere inducing a defici|ency of vigour in the &s;everal functions of the human body, and e&s;pecially in the functions of the liver, in con|&s;equence of which, a preternatural &s;ecretion and excre|tion of bile is readily induced by the remote cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The chief of the remote cau&s;es of this di&s;ea&s;e appears to be a &s;udden change in the temperature of the atmo&s;|phere, for it is always mo&s;t prevalent, when after extreme hot and dry weather, a fall of rain has cooled the at|mo&s;phere.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es after the heat of the &s;ea&s;on has given the predi&s;po&s;ition, the di&s;ea&s;e is induced by eating too freely of crude vegetables, and &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as are of difficult dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Emetics of the dra&s;tic kind are very apt to induce this di&s;ea&s;e when employed during the hot &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Though the effu&s;ion of bile into the alimentary canal generally gives ri&s;e to the di&s;ea&s;e at fir&s;t, it often con|tinues after the bile is completely evacuated, owing to the debility and exqui&s;ite irritability, fir&s;t induced by its irritation. This is &s;imilar to what happens after taking an over do&s;e of Tartar emetic; the vomiting often continuing after every particle of the emetic which fir&s;t excited it, has been evacuated.</P>
<P>The pores of the &s;kin being relaxed and enlarged by the &s;ummers' heat, and accommodated to the in|crea&s;ed quantity of per&s;pirable matter, which is deter|mined thither and exhaled, any plethora occa&s;ioned

by a diminution, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of that di&s;charge, mu&s;t load tho&s;e Vi&s;cera in the abdomen who&s;e ordinary &s;e|cretions are mo&s;t languid at that time. The con&s;equence of this dertermination is, a di&s;tention of the ve&s;&s;els of the abdominal vi&s;cera, and of cour&s;e irritation and pain, and this irritation and pain, occa&s;ion an increa&s;e of the internal &s;ecretion, and among the re&s;t, that of the bile.&mdash;</P>
<P>The bile, and the pancreatic fluid, as well as the ga&s;tric fluid, appear to be more acrid in this di&s;ea&s;e than in a &s;tate of health, at lea&s;t experiments prove this to be the ca&s;e with the ga&s;tric fluid; hence the appli|cation of the&s;e, or of any other acrid &s;ub&s;tance to the debilitated and irritable fibres of the &s;tomach and in|te&s;tines, occa&s;ion tho&s;e enormous and irregular mo|tions in their fibres, which have been de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The&s;e contractions &s;ometimes exhibit an appearance of increa&s;ed power, as well as of action, but this ap|pearance is falacious, otherwi&s;e &s;edative or debililating and not &s;timulating remedies would afford relief.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>REMEDIES.</HEAD>
<P>IN every ca&s;e of Cholera, the bilious and other acrid matters &s;hould be immediately diluted, and carried off by large and frequent draughts or camomile tea or warm water, and where the patient will &s;ubmit to them by injections of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as this is accompli&s;hed, or &s;ooner, if the &s;pa&s;ms have begun to affect the limbs, recour&s;e &s;hould be had to the internal u&s;e of opium, which &s;hould be ad|mini&s;tered in a liquid form by the mouth, if the &s;tomach will retain it. To an adult, thirty drops &s;hould be given in a table &s;poonfull of &s;imple peppermint, or cinnamon water, and repeated every hour if retained on the &s;to|mach, till the evacuations and &s;pa&s;ms cea&s;e, but if re|jected, it &s;hould be repeated immediately, after every evacuation. The laudanum &s;hould be proportioned to the patients age and vigor; to a child from one month to a year, from one to &s;ix drops will be proper.</P>
<P>To render the laudanum more certainly effectual: every means &s;hould be employed to re&s;tore the determination
<PB N="4" REF="033591_0004_0FF795E2BA55E238">
to the &s;urface. For this purpo&s;e, when practicable, the patient &s;hould be immer&s;ed in the warm bath, but where that is impracticable, flannel clothes wrung out of hot wa|ter &s;hould be applied to his &s;tomach, abdomen and limbs, as hot as he can conveniently bear, and the application of the&s;e flannel cloths &s;hould be repeated as often as they become cool.</P>
<P>The&s;e failing, from eighty to an hundred drops of Laudanum &s;hould be thrown up the bowels, in a gli&s;ter of chicken broth, rice gruel, or camomile, and fen|nel-&s;eed tea, or any other &s;imple liquid, moderately warm, and &s;hould be repeated every two hours, or after every evacuation, till the &s;ymptoms cea&s;e.</P>
<P>If the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould continue, notwith&s;tanding the judicious application of the remedies which have been directed; Bli&s;tering pla&s;ters, or &s;inapi&s;ms &s;hould be applied to the &s;tomach and in&s;ide of the legs, and the whole of the &s;pine rubbed with mu&s;tard, mixed with the &s;pirits of &s;al vol. ammon. or a mixture of the oil of cloves and volatile &s;pirits; and the patient &s;hould lie between heated blankets, the doors and windows of his chamber being open, for the benefit of pure air.</P>
<P>When the &s;tomach rejects opium in a liquid form, one grain of &s;olid opium may be admini&s;tered every hour, or after every evacuation, to an adult; and a proportion|able quantity, with any agreeable pre&s;erve and aromatic tea to an infant.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;es double flannel cloths &s;prinkled with warm &s;piced brandy, or a mixture of oil of cloves, volatile &s;pirits and brandy, applied to the &s;tomach and bowels, and a common heated flat or &s;moothing iron pa&s;&s;ed over the flannels have afforded &s;peedy relief.</P>
<P>In &s;ome ca&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> al&s;o, aether exhibited in do&s;es of thirty or forty drops in any &s;imple herb tea, and frequently repeated, has al&s;o &s;ucceeded when opium has failed.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e is very liable to return the day following, unle&s;s prevented by having recour&s;e to preventitives: I therefore make it a rule to exhibit ten or fifteen drops of laud. liquid in &s;ome agreeable draughts every twelve hours, for three or four days after the evacuations have cea&s;ed</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="033591_0005_0FF795E61FE4F678">At the &s;ame time the patient &s;hould take a decoction or infu&s;ion of Columbo root, with the addition of a few drops of lavender compound, or a little old brandy four or five times a day, to re&s;tore &s;trength and ea&s;e to the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>The lighte&s;t and mo&s;t grateful food, &s;hould be taken in a &s;mall quantity, at a time.</P>
<P>In general, adult patients &s;oon recover perfectly from this di&s;ea&s;e, if managed agreeably to the preceeding di|rections; but in infants and young children, the diarr|ahoea, with occa&s;ional vomiting, is very apt to continue ob&s;tinate for a great length of time, and in general, proves more fatal to them, than any other di&s;ea&s;e to which they are liable.</P>
<P>The bilious diarrhoea of children, &s;hall therefore be the &s;ubject of the next chapter.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Bilious Diarrhoea of INFANTS, and young CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS di&s;ea&s;e is much more prevalent in populous cities, than in villages or farm hou&s;es of Ameri|ca, and like the Cholera, of which it is frequently the con&s;quence, is confined to the &s;ummer and autumnal &s;ea|&s;ons. It is mo&s;t frequent and violent, during tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons immediately after a &s;udden change of the wind, to a colder quarter, and e&s;pecially after rain, which gives a &s;udden coolne&s;s to the air. This di&s;ea&s;e is confined principally to infants at the brea&s;t and tho&s;e under two years of age: it &s;eldom occurs violently, or proves fatal, after this tender age.</P>
<P>In Philadelphia, more children are annually de&s;troy|ed by this di&s;ea&s;e, than by all the others to which they &s;ubject.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e either returns after the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the Cholera, or comes on &s;uddenly after expo&s;ure to cold,
<PB N="6" REF="033591_0006_0FF795E89A3B5118">
generally in the night, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed from com|mon diarrhoea, by the &s;everity of the griping, and the bilious coloured &s;tools, accompanied with a frequent inclination to puke, particularly a little before the pa|tient has an evacuation by &s;tool, or at the time of &s;uch evacuation.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Diarrhoea ari&s;ing from teething by the pul&s;e, condition of the &s;kin, the &s;trength of the patient, and the a&s;pect of his counte|nance. In the latter, the&s;e differ very little from their natural &s;tate, for &s;everal days after the commencement of the di&s;ea&s;e, whereas in the bilious Diarrhoeaa, the de|bility in mo&s;t ca&s;es, is evident from the commencement. The pul&s;e is weak, low, quick and &s;oft, the &s;kin pale, cold and dry, or cold and moi&s;t, e&s;pecially on the limbs &mdash;the eyes dull, and the countenance contracted, de|pre&s;&s;ed and li&s;tle&s;s.</P>
<P>The internal heat and thir&s;t are great&mdash;the fle&s;h grows daily more relaxed, &s;oft and emaciated, the thir&s;t increa&s;es, the appetite fails; every kind of food is loath|ed and refu&s;ed; no drink but cold water acceptable, and that thrown up &s;oon after it is taken. In the pro|gre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, all the enumerated &s;ymptoms in|crea&s;e, in &s;ome gradually, in others more rapidly. In the wor&s;t and mo&s;t ob&s;tinate ca&s;es, unle&s;s early relieved, the &s;tools become daily more copious, though not al|ways more frequent, and have a cadaverous &s;cent, the debility increa&s;es, every thing taken into the &s;tomach pa&s;&s;es through the bowels undige&s;ted or but little altered from its natural &s;tate; the thir&s;t becomes in&s;atiable, the feet &s;well and become oedematous, the belly &s;wells and grows hard, the mouth becomes affected with &s;uperficial white eruptions and ulcerations, which impedes the &s;wallowing; a lethargy en&s;ues, the &s;kin appears livid, and often &s;potted, and the patient dies.</P>
<P>The duration, as well as violence of this di&s;ea&s;e, is very various, &s;ome recovering in three or four days, others lingering for as many months, and recovering after being reduced to perfect &s;keletons; &s;ome die be|fore the end of the fir&s;t week, others after lingering &s;ix or &s;even, and &s;ome &s;till longer.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="033591_0007_0FF795EA2ADFE420">As this di&s;ea&s;e depends upon &s;imilar cau&s;es, only ope|rating in a le&s;s degree, as the Cholera, that is upon too great a determination to the liver and inte&s;tines, and a want of tone in the extreme ve&s;&s;els, on the external &s;urface of the body, and a general &s;tate of debility in the circulating organs, and is occa&s;ioned by the appli|cation of debilitating powers; it is obvious that the in|dications of cure, and the remedies employed, &s;hould be the &s;ame as tho&s;e employed in the cure of Cholera, on|ly differing in degree, or the proportion in which they are applied, at a time when the patient is in an imper|fect &s;tate of vigour.</P>
<P>An increa&s;ed peri&s;taltic motion of the inte&s;tines, may be con&s;idered as always the chief part in the proxi|mate cau&s;e of dirrahoea, and the di&s;ea&s;e, is diver&s;ified by the different cau&s;es which produce this encrea&s;ed motion.</P>
<P>But in the &s;pecies under con&s;ideration, viz. that in which bile predominates in the evacuations, the increa&s;ed pe|ri&s;taltic motion is occa&s;ioned and continued by the bile, effu&s;ed into, and irritating the inte&s;tines&punc;</P>

and covered with flannel; and if the nights and mornings are con&s;iderably cooler than the re&s;t of the day, which is generally the ca&s;e after the middle of Au|gu&s;t, wor&s;ted &s;tockings or a flannel petticoat long enough to cover the feet, &s;hould be worn con&s;tantly. Small bli&s;tering pla&s;ters applied to the limbs, and repeated occa&s;ionally, frequently afford relie, not only to the fever, but to the diarrhoea.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the diarrhoea and thir&s;t cea&s;e, the cold bath, either by way of &s;hower or immer&s;ion, &s;hould be employed regularly once a-day at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>When the bath can not be conveniently applied in either of the ways ju&s;t mentioned, the whole body may be walked by means of a thick linen cloth, dipt in cold water and brandy, and wiped dry after each wa&s;hing with a warm napkin; this occa&s;ions a glow on the &s;ur|face, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;upplies the place of exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>By the u&s;e of the bath, a proper regulation of diet, and frequent exerci&s;e in the open air, a relap&s;e may be generally prevented during the extreme heats of July and Augu&s;t; but for farther &s;ecurity, as the &s;ea&s;on ad|vances, and the nights and mornings become cold, while the middle of the days continue di&s;tre&s;&s;ingly hot, it will be proper to let the infant wear a flannel &s;hirt, as well as a long flannel petticoat or wor&s;ted &s;tockings. Flannel from its texture repels moi&s;ture, and has the property of retaining heat, whereas linen being &s;mooth and compact, &s;uffers it to e&s;cape immediately: hence flannel cloathing pre&s;erves the warmth on the &s;urface, and thereby prevents morbid determination to the in|ternal vi&s;cera.</P>
<P>Ca&s;es of diarrhoea often occur during the hot &s;ea&s;on, that are not bilious, particularly in June and July. In the&s;e ca&s;es, the alvine evacuations are generally mixed with more or le&s;s mucus; the griping, though more &s;evere is attended with le&s;s &s;ickne&s;s, and le&s;s thir&s;t, and the countenance is always more animated, and the func|tions in general more vigorous.&mdash;Children who&s;e gums are inflamed by teething, are mo&s;t frequently affected with a diarrhoea of this kind; and my ob&s;ervations give me rea&s;on to believe, that the effects of teething, in&s;tead
<PB N="12" REF="033591_0012_0FF795F6AC019C18">
of being the cau&s;e of the bilious diarrhoea, is always a preventative, except the inflammation which the irrita|tion of the teeth occa&s;ion, before they pa&s;s through the gum be &s;o great as to bring on indirect debility.</P>
<P>When therefore the gums begin to appear &s;welled and red in ca&s;es of bilious diarrhoea, it may be con&s;ider|ed a favourable circum&s;tance.&mdash;From this circum&s;tance it is very probable, that mercurial frictions would be beneficial in ca&s;es of bilious diarrhoea, by inducing a &s;imilar &s;welling and inflammation, and a general phlo|gi&s;tic diathe&s;is.</P>
<P>To promote the cure of the diarrhoea muco&s;a which if not cau&s;ed, is often aggravated by the irritation and pain of teething; tho&s;e parts of the gums where the teeth are ready to protrude, &s;hould be cut acro&s;s with a &s;calpel &s;ufficiently deep to prevent any farther irritation from the edge of the tooth.</P>
<P>The irritation and pain occa&s;ioned by teething, ge|nerally renders the &s;tomach liable to be di&s;ordered by every thing the infant takes. When this &s;tate of the &s;tomach is attended with thin watery &s;tools, and no fever, laudanum proportioned to the age of the patient is the mo&s;t certain remedy; but when frequent incli|nation to puke is accompanied, or followed by mucous &s;tools, and &s;ymptoms of more or le&s;s fever, I have ob|&s;erved the following method of treatment to be the mo&s;t efficacious.</P>

<P>When this medicine is intended to carry off acrid, or irritating matter from the inte&s;tines, two, three, or four tea &s;poonfuls, more or le&s;s, adapted to the age of the in|fant, &s;hould be given every hour, till a change in the colour of the &s;tools, render its operation evident. The operation may be promoted, by a &s;imple decoction of bread and water, made palatable with &s;ugar; by &s;ago gruel, or fowl broth, &amp;c. The brea&s;t may al&s;o be allow|ed. An anodyne at night, &s;uited to the age and &s;trength of the little patient is generally found nece&s;&s;ary to pro|cure tranquil and refre&s;hing &s;leep, unle&s;s the complaint be attended with fever of an inflammatory kind.</P>
<P>When the medicine is intended to correct acidity, calcined magne&s;ia is preferable to the common kind, and may be employed in the &s;ame quantity and manner, and when the griping is &s;evere, from half a drop to three drops of tinct. opii. may be added to each do&s;e of the mixture, and given every hour till that &s;ymptom is relieved, and afterwards three times a-day till the eva|cuations are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. When this is accompli&s;hed, tone may be re&s;tored to the &s;tomach, inte&s;tines, and the whole &s;y&s;tem by the u&s;e of tonics, combined with lauda|num, and given in proper do&s;es, and at proper inter|vals.</P>

<P>Dr. Darwin con&s;iders a bath of 96 or 98^o a &s;alutary &s;timulus, which &s;upplies heat rather than produces it, and rather fills the &s;y&s;tem by increa&s;ed ab&s;orption, than empties it by increa&s;ed &s;ecretion; and may hence be employed with advantage in almo&s;t all ca&s;es of debility with cold extremities, perhaps even in ana&s;arca, and at the approach of death in fevers.</P>
<P>Removal to the high grounds of the country before the extreme heat commences, is the be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t the diarrhoea of children, and after the di&s;ea&s;e has taken place, removal to the country is the mo&s;t cer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain means of preventing it from proving mortal.</P>
