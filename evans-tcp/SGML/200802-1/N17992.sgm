<BIBL>Epi&s;tle to the Galatians, IV. 31.</BIBL>
<Q>So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE churches of Galatia con&s;i&s;ted principally of Jewi&s;h converts, who were engaged to incorporate the Mo&s;aic ritual with the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. They boa&s;ted, at the &s;ame time, "We be Abraham's children, and were never in bond|age." With great addre&s;s and pertinency St. Paul reminds them, "Abraham had two &s;ons; one by a bond-maid, the other by a free-woman." The&s;e were emblems of the <HI>two covenants.</HI> I&s;hmael, by Hagar the bond-woman, repre&s;ented the Sinai' co|venant; I&s;aac, by Sarah the free-woman, repre|&s;ented the Abrahamic covenant. The former was local and temporary, founded in worldly promi&s;es, had burthen&s;ome appendages, and only a &s;hadow of heavenly things. The latter was univer&s;al and permanent, a covenant of better hopes, and &s;tripped of that ceremonial which was a yoke of bondage.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle hath de&s;cribed the Chri&s;tian church in di&s;tinction from the Jewi&s;h thus: The Jews un|der Mo&s;es were like an heir in his minority, who is under tutors and governors. The law was a &s;chool|ma&s;ter to bring them to Chri&s;t. He came to re|deem them that were under the law; that they might be no longer &s;ervants, but &s;ons; heirs of full age, heirs of God through Chri&s;t. "Now we, brethren, are the children of promi&s;e, as was I&s;aac," with whom the covenant of better hopes was e&s;tab|li&s;hed.
<PB N="6" REF="023308_0005_0FBEF003475FEC98">
<HI>We are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</HI></P>
<P>The apo&s;tle proceeds: "Stand fa&s;t therefore in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bond|age." The Sinai' covenant was &s;ub&s;ervient to the Abrahamic, till the &s;eed promi&s;ed to Abraham came. When this &s;eed came, that covenant had an&s;wered its purpo&s;e, and gave place to a more lib|eral one. The Jewi&s;h converts acknowledged that this &s;eed was come: But they encroached on the liberty of their fellow-Chri&s;tians, by attempting to compel their ob&s;ervance of the abrogated ordinanc|es of Mo&s;es. This was <HI>falling from grace,</HI> cutting them&s;elves off from the privileges of the children of the free-woman, and de&s;iring again to be in bondage to weak and beggarly rudiments: It was returning to a &s;tate of minority, after the time ap|pointed of the father for their majority and freedom.</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle further acquaints them, that "the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham was come on the GENTILES through Je&s;us Chri&s;t." For the promi&s;e was thus expre&s;&s;ed: "In thee &s;hall all nations be ble&s;&s;ed." There is therefore no difference, under the Chri&s;ti|an in&s;titution, between Jews and other nations. The latter, though by nature in bondage, are made equally free of the family of Chri&s;t as the former. This is the fulfilment of the prediction, "I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved. Where it was &s;aid unto them, Ye are not my people, there &s;hall they be called the children of the living God." The text, though immediately addre&s;&s;ed to Jewi&s;h believers, is equally applicable to believing Gen|tiles. <HI>The&s;e</HI> are not, any more than <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> children of the bond-woman, but of the free. They are "all one in Chri&s;t Je&s;us&mdash;children of God, whether
<PB N="7" REF="023308_0006_0FBEF004EFDEAB50">
Jew or Greek, bond or free, male or female&mdash;If Chri&s;t's, then Abraham's &s;eed, and heirs according to the promi&s;e."</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian freedom, being alike the privilege of converts from Judai&s;m and heatheni&s;m, primarily intends, on the part of the former, the abolition of the encumbered ritual of Mo&s;es; and, on the part of the latter, liberation from idolatrous &s;uper&s;tition, to which they were in &s;ervile &s;ubjection: On the part of both it intends deliverance from the &s;lavery of vicious pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;t appeared, the whole world were &s;unk in ignorance and wickedne&s;s. The Gentiles, <HI>profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be wi&s;e, know not God,</HI> and wor&s;hipped and &s;erved the creature more than the Creator. They were va&s;&s;als to the prince of the power of the air. The Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, ac|companied with the holy Gho&s;t &s;ent down from heaven, called them out of darkne&s;s into marvel|lous light; they were turned from dumb idols, from the power of Satan, from worldly pollutions, to &s;erve the living God. The Jewi&s;h church had corrupted and made void the law of God. Their guides taught for doctrines the commandments of men, perverted to a worldly &s;en&s;e the promi&s;es of &s;piritual redemption, and impo&s;ed a greater burthen of ceremonies than Mo&s;es had enjoined. Chri&s;t removed the vail of Mo&s;es, <HI>con&s;ecrated a new and living way</HI> to God, re&s;cued the precepts of the de|calogue from the glo&s;&s;es of blind and intere&s;ted guides, and di&s;burthened religion of that weight under which it had groaned. His <HI>yoke is ea&s;y,</HI> and <HI>his burthen light. Where the &s;pirit of the Lord is, there is liberty</HI> in the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e. The &s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t removes the dominion of &s;in. His di&s;ciples, made free from &s;in, <HI>walk not after the fle&s;h, but after the &s;pirit. There is no condemnation
<PB N="8" REF="023308_0007_0FBEF009908B4290">
to them.</HI> Thus emancipated, they "wait for the hope of righteou&s;ne&s;s by faith&mdash;the redemption of the body." When made free of the kingdom pro|mi&s;ed them, &s;in and the cur&s;e, pain, &s;orrow, death &s;hall be no more. How glorious this liberty!</P>
<P>Further: Chri&s;tianity is <HI>a rea&s;onable &s;ervice,</HI> and founded in per&s;onal per&s;ua&s;ion. It permits us to "call no man ma&s;ter; for one is our ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;" to whom alone every one mu&s;t &s;tand or fall. His religion is friendly to free enquiry: It directs us to "prove all things"&mdash;to claim the lib|erty of grounding our faith, not on the wi&s;dom of man, but the power of God; and to allow others the &s;ame. Our liberty may not be judged of their con&s;ciences, nor their liberty of our con&s;cience. They who are &s;trong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak; and &s;hould take heed le&s;t by any means their liberty, their improved knowledge in Chri&s;tianity, &s;hould be a &s;tumbling block to unin|formed minds. "U&s;e not liberty for an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h, but by love &s;erve one another. There is one body, and one &s;pirit, and we are called in one hope. One Lord, one faith, one bapti&s;m, one God and Father of all."</P>
<P>How then &s;hould different profe&s;&s;ors, and dif|ferent denominations, endeavour to keep the unity of the &s;pirit in the bond of peace, with all meek|ne&s;s, humility and charity? The body of Chri&s;t is one, and hath many members. The members then "&s;hould have the &s;ame care one for another. If one &s;uffer, all the members &s;hould &s;uffer with it; or if one be honoured, all the members &s;hould re|joice with it." Tho&s;e are <HI>carnal, and walk as men,</HI> who contend for the &s;y&s;tem of this or that man, or body of men. The children of the bond-woman would exclude from the privileges of the Chri&s;ti|an church, and doom to eternal chains, &s;uch as do
<PB N="9" REF="023308_0008_0FBEF00C6E9EFB78">
not embrace the faith or opinions they hold: But the children of the free-woman <HI>have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t.</HI> The &s;implicity and per&s;picuity of this hea|venly in&s;titution, de&s;igned to guide men of common under&s;tanding in the paths of &s;alvation, can derive no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from &s;peculations too high for the ge|nerality of mankind&mdash;too high al&s;o for tho&s;e who exerci&s;e them&s;elves therein.</P>
<P>In going off from one extreme, let us &s;hun the other. "We are called unto liberty:" Should it be an occa&s;ion of infidelity and indifference to all religion, the guilt and &s;hame mu&s;t be aggravated. The real friends of liberty always di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween freedom and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. They know that the mind cannot be free, while blinded by &s;ceptical pride, or immer&s;ed in &s;en&s;uality. Liberty con&s;i&s;ts not in &s;ubverting the foundations of &s;ociety, in be|ing without law. Nor doth it con&s;i&s;t in rea&s;oning again&s;t God, and providence, and revelation. Nor in attempting to explain his nature, his govern|ment, and the &s;ecret things which belong to him.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian liberty &s;uppo&s;eth that we receive the record which God hath given of his Son&mdash;that we be not the &s;ervants of &s;in, but have our fruit unto holine&s;s&mdash;that we abide in our callings.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, The &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity hath the be&s;t a&s;pect on general liberty and the rights of mankind. Would we per&s;uade men to <HI>look, not on</HI> their <HI>own things, but on the things of others,</HI> let us &s;et before them the pattern of Chri&s;t. Was ever grace or liberality like his, "who though he was rich, for our &s;akes become poor, that we through his pover|ty might be rich?" He was "in the form of God,&mdash;but took upon him the form of a &s;ervant." He "came not to be mini&s;tred unto, but to mini&s;ter, and gave his life" to purcha&s;e &s;piritual and eternal redemption for the &s;laves of Satan. Po&s;&s;ibly for a
<PB N="10" REF="023308_0009_0FBEF00DD82F6FD0">
<HI>friend,</HI> or a <HI>good</HI> man, &s;ome might dare to die. But HE died for <HI>enemies,</HI> for the <HI>ungodly.</HI> Is it glorious to die for one's <HI>country?</HI> HE died for all the <HI>world.</HI> Were the &s;ame mind in us, we &s;hould love all man|kind, and do good to all as we have opportunity. They who hate and per&s;ecute us would be the ob|jects of our good wi&s;hes and forgivene&s;s. We &s;hould pray, "Father, forgive them." We &s;hould have compa&s;&s;ion on them, as the good Samaritan had on the Jew whom he found helple&s;s and ready to peri&s;h. Every natural and friendly, every pri|vate and public affection is cheri&s;hed and improved by looking unto Je&s;us. And if we &s;peak of uni|ver&s;al philanthropy, how doth every example fade before his? He is not a&s;hamed to call mankind his brethren. His love to them was &s;tronger than death, when they had forfeited the privileges of children, and might have been con&s;igned, with a|po&s;tat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;pirits, to chains and blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s. They owe all the liberty they have or hope for to his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Where the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t is, there is no envy, &s;trife or confu&s;ion; no di&s;cord and war; no inva|&s;ion of the rights of others, either tho&s;e of individ|uals, or of &s;ocieties and nations; but meekne&s;s, peace, and harmony, joy in the happine&s;s, and commi&s;eration of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others. This &s;pirit doth no ill to others, but all po&s;&s;ible good. Rulers, under its influence, are not oppre&s;&s;ors, but benefactors. Subjects do not re&s;i&s;t lawful authori|ty; but render tribute, cu&s;tom, fear, honour to whom they are due, leading a quiet life in godli|ne&s;s and hone&s;ty. When the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity &s;hall univer&s;ally prevail, as our hope is that it will, nations will "learn war no more; they &s;hall not hurt nor de&s;troy in all God's holy mountain."</P>
<P>Our Lord undertook not to &s;ay what men's per|&s;onal
<PB N="11" REF="023308_0010_0FBEF00F38E2E590">
and civil rights are&mdash;what the prerogatives of princes, or the &s;overeign power of a nation, and what the privileges of &s;ubjects. He left civil di&s;|tinctions among men as he found them. He taught his di&s;ciples to "render to Ce&s;ar the things that are Ce&s;ar's, and to God the things that are God's.</P>
<P>Among other relative duties, his religion parti|cularly requires of <HI>&s;ervants,</HI> that they <HI>be &s;ubject to their ma&s;ters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but al&s;o to the froward: Shewing all good fi|delity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. Let every man wherein he is called, therein abide with God. Let as many &s;er|vants as are under the yoke, account their own ma&s;ters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not bla&s;phemed. And they that have be|lieving ma&s;ters, let them not de&s;pi&s;e them, becau&s;e they are brethren.</HI></P>
<P>Revelation has not informed us, what form of government is be&s;t adapted to an&s;wer the ends of &s;ociety. Every from mu&s;t be &s;ome abridgment of natural liberty. Our being &s;ocial creatures, our dependence on one another, &s;hew that government is the will of the Creator. The original from was probably patriarchal. The theocracy of the Jews was appropriate to them. Monarchy was a &s;ub|ver&s;ion of their con&s;titution. No other form than theirs can be pronounced <HI>divine.</HI> Nations have a right to in&s;titute &s;uch form as they chu&s;e. The government of mo&s;t nations, therefore, hath been mere u&s;urpation. Far from being &s;anctioned by divine authority, we might rather con&s;ider the per|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch government as his greate&s;t &s;courge on mankind.</P>
<P>Relying on the candor which I need from my pre&s;ent auditory, I addre&s;s my&s;elf more particularly to the de&s;ign of our coming together.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="023308_0011_0FBEF010B87FDA18">
A manner of addre&s;s calculated to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions would neither become my &s;tation, nor be re&s;pectful to an audience well acquainted with the rights of men and citizens, educated in principles of liberty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Africans</HI> belong to the families for whom heaven de&s;igned a participation in the ble&s;&s;ing of Abraham. We need not di&s;cu&s;s the que&s;tion, what the &s;tate of tho&s;e, whom the Europeans have en&s;lav|ed, was antecedently to &s;uch their &s;lavery. It is more proper to enquire when and how the African &s;lave-trade commenced&mdash;what nations have engag|ed in it&mdash;in what manner they have carried it on&mdash;what the probable numbers they have reduced to &s;lavery&mdash;in what condition the&s;e &s;laves are held&mdash;and what rea&s;ons are offered in vindication of the trade.</P>
<P>A zeal for the di&s;covery of new territory marked the fifteenth century. The fir&s;t navigations of the Europeans for this purpo&s;e were concerted and di|rected by prince Henry, fourth &s;on of John I. king of Portugal. He was born 1394. His valor in the a&s;&s;ault and capture of the city <HI>Ceuta</HI> in Africa, A. D. 1415, pre&s;aged the fame he afterwards ac|quired. From this period he devoted him&s;elf to naval expeditions for the di&s;covery of unknown countries. The &s;hips he &s;ent out &s;ubjected divers parts of Africa, and the neighbouring i&s;lands, to the dominion of Portugal. After the &s;ucce&s;s in doubling cape <HI>Bojador,</HI> he gave to his father and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors all the lands he had di&s;covered, or might di&s;cover, and applied to pope <HI>Martin</HI> V. to ratify the donation. He engaged, that in all their expeditions the Portugue&s;e &s;hould have mainly in view the exten&s;ion of the Roman church and au|thority of its pontif. Martin granted the prince's reque&s;t. In his bull of ratification, which was a|bout
<PB N="13" REF="023308_0012_0FBEF017226DE760">
the year 1430, it is declared, that "whatever might be di&s;covered from the &s;aid cape to the ut|mo&s;t <HI>India,</HI> &s;hould pertain to the Portugue&s;e' do|minion." Edward, brother to prince Henry, &s;uc|ceeded to the throne of Portugal 1433, on the death of John I. Pope <HI>Eugene</HI> IV. by his bull in 1438, ratified to Edward the grant made by Mar|tin V. A bull of <HI>Nicholas</HI> V. dated January 8, 1454, refers to the afore&s;aid bulls of his predece&s;|&s;ors, Martin and Eugene. It recites the declara|tion prince Henry had made of his atchievements&mdash;"<HI>that for 25 years he had not cea&s;ed to &s;end an|nually almo&s;t an army</HI>" of Portugue&s;e, "with the greate&s;t dangers, labors and charges, in mo&s;t &s;wift &s;hips, to <HI>&s;earch out the &s;ea and maritime provinces towards the &s;outhern parts and antarctic pole"</HI>&mdash;that the&s;e &s;hips "came at length to the province of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome i&s;lands, havens and &s;ea adjoining"&mdash;that "&s;ailing further, war was waged for &s;ome years with the people of tho&s;e parts, and very many i&s;lands near thereunto were &s;ubdued and peaceably po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and &s;till were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, with the adjacent &s;ea"&mdash;that "many <HI>Guineans</HI> and other <HI>negroes</HI> were taken thence by <HI>force,</HI> and &s;ome by <HI>barter.</HI>" The bull de&s;cribes prince Henry as "a true &s;oldier of Chri&s;t, a mo&s;t courageous de|fender and intrepid champion of the faith, a&s;piring from his early youth with his utmo&s;t might to have the glorious name of Chri&s;t publi&s;hed, extolled and revered throughout the world." It recogni&s;eth the exclu&s;ive right of Portugal to the acqui&s;itions and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions afore&s;aid, in virtue of the letters of Mar|tin and Eugene, which granted to the king of Por|tugal and prince Henry "free and ample faculty to <HI>invade, &s;earch out, expugn, vanqui&s;h</HI> and <HI>&s;ubdue</HI> all pagans and enemies of Chri&s;t where&s;oever placed, <HI>and their per&s;ons to reduce to perpetual &s;lavery,</HI> and
<PB N="14" REF="023308_0013_0FBEF01938C20F50">
all their kingdoms, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and goods to <HI>apply</HI> and <HI>appropriate,</HI>" &amp;c. Pope Nicholas's letter then goes on to "decree and declare, the acque&s;ts <HI>al|ready</HI> made, and what <HI>hereafter</HI> &s;hall happen to be acquired, after that they &s;hall be acquired, have pertained, and forever of right do belong and per|tain, to the afore&s;aid king and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and not to any others whatever." It forbids, on the &s;evere&s;t penalties, all Chri&s;tian powers from &s;ettling in the countries di&s;covered by the Portugue&s;e, or any way mole&s;ting them in their expeditions for the di&s;covery and conque&s;t of unknown countries. It &s;peaks of prince Henry's plan and his pro&s;ecu|tion of it as "a mo&s;t <HI>pious</HI> works, and mo&s;t worthy of perpetual remembrance, wherein the glory of God, with the intere&s;t of the commonwealth of the univer&s;al church are concerned."</P>
<P>Thus were prince Henry's views and operations &s;anctioned by the highe&s;t authority at that time ac|knowledged in Chri&s;tendom. A right derived from a &s;ource &s;o venerable was then undi&s;puted. The Roman pontif bound princes at his plea&s;ure; and, as vicar of Chri&s;t, was allowed to have at his di&s;|po&s;al all the kingdoms of the earth. This grant of Nicholas was confirmed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Calixtus III. Augu&s;t 6, 1458.</P>
<P>On the death of Edward, his &s;on Alphon&s;us, then in his minority, &s;ucceeded to the throne of Portugal 1438, and died 1481. Prince Henry died 1460, or 1463. At his death the &s;pirit of di&s;covery lan|gui&s;hed; but revived with the acce&s;&s;ion of John II. &s;on of Alphon&s;us. John, the year after his ac|ce&s;&s;ion, (1482) &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to Edward IV. of England, to acquaint him with the title acquired, by the pope's bull, to the conque&s;ts in Guinea; and reque&s;ted him to di&s;&s;olve a fleet which &s;ome Engli&s;h merchants were fitting for the Guinea trade.

one quarter are negro &s;laves. In the four &s;tates next north of Maryland are 45,401 &s;laves. In New-England 3870. There may have been brought into all the We&s;t-India-I&s;lands, and into the Unit|ed States, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, SEVEN MILLIONS. One million more mu&s;t be allowed for mortality on the pa&s;&s;age. How many have been de&s;troyed in the collection of them in Africa, we cannot ju&s;tly con|jecture. It is judged that Great-Britain &s;u&s;tain the lo&s;s of twice as many &s;eamen in this, as in all their other exten&s;ive trade.</P>
<P>We &s;uppo&s;e, then, that eight millions of &s;laves have been &s;hipped in Africa for the We&s;t-India i&s;lands and the United States; ten millions for South-America; and, perhaps, two millions have been taken and held in &s;lavery in Africa. Great-Britain and the United States have &s;hipped about five millions, France two, Holland and other nati|ons one; though we undertake not to &s;tate the proportion with exactne&s;s. The other twelve mil|lions we &s;et to Portugal. Twenty million &s;laves, at &pound;. 30 &s;terling each, amount to the commercial value of. &pound;. 600,000,000. <HI>Six hundred times ten hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling traffic in the</HI> SOULS OF MEN!!!</P>
<P>By whom hath this commerce been opened, and &s;o long and ardently pur&s;ued? The &s;ubjects of their <HI>mo&s;t faithful, mo&s;t catholic, mo&s;t Chri&s;tian, mo&s;t pro|te&s;tant</HI> maje&s;ties, <HI>defenders of the faith;</HI> and by the citizens of the <HI>mo&s;t republican</HI> States, with the &s;anc|tion of St.<HI>Peter's</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Unprovoked, with|out any pretended injury, <HI>the&s;e</HI> have kindled and kept alive the flame of war through three quarters of the continent of Africa; that is, all the interior as well as maritime parts &s;outh of Senegal and A|by&s;&s;inia. <HI>The&s;e</HI> have taught the Africans to &s;teal, &s;ell and murder one another.

the different tribes make pri&s;oners of each o|ther, or the chiefs &s;eize their own people, and drive them, as herds of cattle, to market. The natives are trepanned by one another, and by the Europe|ans; forced from their flocks, and fields, and ten|dere&s;t connexions. This vile commerce hath depo|pulated the &s;ea-coa&s;t: It mu&s;t now be carried on in the inland parts.</P>
<P>As though it were not &s;ufficient to force the Af|ricans from their country, and every thing dear to them, they are made to travel in irons hundreds of miles through their native &s;oil, through &s;ands and mora&s;&s;es, down to the &s;ea &s;hore; and there &s;towed, as lumber, for tran&s;portation. The cruelty of the captains of the Guinea &s;hips, in many in&s;tances, is not inferior to that of <HI>Clive</HI> or <HI>Ha&s;tings.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ervitude of the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> part of the &s;laves after their arrival, the &s;cantine&s;s of their provi&s;ion and its bad quality, their tyrannical and mercile&s;s di&s;cipline, are well known, and too painful to re|collect. It is a law in Barbadoes, "that if any &s;lave, under puni&s;hment by his ma&s;ter or his order, &s;uffer in <HI>life</HI> or <HI>limb,</HI> no per&s;on &s;hall be liable to any fine for the &s;ame. But if any man &s;hall wan|tonly or cruelly kill his own &s;lave, he &s;hall pay in|to the trea&s;ury &pound;. 15."</P>
<P>With what rea&s;on or truth is it urged, that the condition of the Africans is <HI>meliorated</HI> by their &s;lavery? They, not their ma&s;ters, are the proper judges in this matter. Wretched as you may &s;up|po&s;e their condition was in Africa, the nefarious commerce of foreigners may have been the princi|pal cau&s;e of that wretchedne&s;s. Should foreigners de&s;i&s;t from this commerce, and the holders of &s;laves propo&s;e to tran&s;port them back to Africa, how would their <HI>mouth be filled with laughter, and their tongue with &s;inging?</HI> In&s;tead of thinking their con|dition
<PB N="24" REF="023308_0023_0FBEF03281725898">
meliorated by &s;lavery, they mo&s;t &s;incerely join in that execration on their oppre&s;&s;ors: <HI>Happy &s;hall he be that taketh and da&s;heth thy little ones a|gain&s;t the &s;tones.</HI> The imaginary expectation that death may tran&s;port them to their own country is their chief con&s;olation. Under unlimited power, accu&s;tomed to the mo&s;t inhuman u&s;age, no example of mercy relenting for them being exhibited, no marvel that the language of in&s;urgents is, <HI>Death or conque&s;t.</HI> Their cries will &s;ooner or later reach the ears of him to whom vengeance belongeth.</P>
<P>Will any one &s;ay, that their condition is melior|ated by their being taught the knowledge of GOD and CHRIST? How many of their ma&s;ters are in a &s;tate of brutal ignorance in this re&s;pect? A pari&s;h mini&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Ram&s;ay.</NOTE> in the We&s;t-Indies &s;aith, that he "drew up plain and ea&s;y in&s;tructions for the &s;laves, invited them to attend at particular hours on Lord's-day, appointed hours at home, and exhorted their ma&s;|ters to encourage their attendance. But inconceiv|able was the li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s with which he was heard, and bitter the cen&s;ure heaped on him in return. It was &s;ugge&s;ted, that he aimed to render them inca|pable of being good &s;laves by making them Chri&s;|tians&mdash;Some who approved of the plan, did not think them&s;elves obliged to co-operate: I &s;tood," &s;ays he, "a rebel convict again&s;t the intere&s;t and maje&s;ty of planter&s;hip."</P>
<P>When Archbi&s;hop <HI>Secker</HI> a&s;ked what &s;ucce&s;s the mi&s;&s;ionaries "had in baptizing and converting ne|gro &s;laves? how the catechi&s;t at Coddrington col|lege in Barbadoes proceeded with tho&s;e &s;laves that belonged to the college e&s;tate," and whom he pre|&s;umed had been in&s;tructed in Chri&s;tianity? He was an&s;wered, "I found <HI>one</HI> old negro, who told me he could &s;ay all his catechi&s;m. I a&s;ked him, if he did not find him&s;elf much happier and better &s;ince he

became a Chri&s;tian, than he was before? Why, Sir, &s;aid he, I am old man, and as a driver am not put to common labour; but Chri&s;tian not made for negro in this country. How &s;o? What is your duty towards God? He repeated it. What is your duty towards your neighbor?&mdash;Ah, ma&s;ter, I don't &s;ay that no more. Why &s;o? Becau&s;e, ma&s;ter, I can't &s;ay it from my heart, if I think of white man."</P>
<P>Had African &s;laves the means of Chri&s;tian in|&s;truction, had they been treated with humanity, &s;till the making &s;laves of them hath been no more than <HI>doing evil that good may come.</HI> Chri&s;tianity and hu|manity would rather have dictated the &s;ending books and teachers into Africa, and endeavors for their civilization. Have they been treated as chil|dren of the &s;ame family with our&s;elves? as having the &s;ame Father, who&s;e <HI>tender mercies are over all his works?</HI> as having the &s;ame natural prerogatives with other nations? Or have they been treated as outca&s;ts from humanity?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The committee of the &s;ociety in London, in&s;tituted in 1787, for the purpo&s;e of effecting the abolition of the &s;lave trade, reported to the &s;ociety, January 15, 1788, "that &s;undry &s;pecimens evince that a trade of great national importance might be opened by once e&s;tabli&s;hing the confidence of the natives." The &s;entiments and rea&s;oning of a great commercial writer on this &s;ubject are ju&s;t and forcible.</P>
<P>"If once a turn for indu&s;try and the arts was introduced, [into Africa] a greater quantity of the European produce and manufactures might be ex|ported thither, than to any other country in the whole world. No country is richer in gold and &s;ilver. Here is a prodigious number of elephants, which would not only facilitate the inland intercour&s;es of commerce, but al&s;o, in the teeth of the&s;e notable animals, afford a very beneficial branch of commerce. The fruitful rich lands, every where to be found upon the coa&s;ts and within the country, upon the banks of the rivers near the gold-coa&s;t and the &s;lave-coa&s;t, would produce all the riche&s;t articles of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-India commerce. It is melancholy to ob&s;erve, that a country which has 10,000 miles &s;ea-coa&s;t, and noble, large, deep rivers, &s;hould yet have no navigation; &s;treams penetrating into the very centre of the country, but of no benefit to it; innumerable people, without knowledge of each other, corre&s;pondence, or commerce&mdash;Africa, &s;tored with an inexhau&s;tible trea|&s;ure, and capable, under proper improvements, of producing &s;o many things delightful as well as convenient, &s;eems utterly neglected by tho&s;e who are civilized them&s;elves, and its own inhabitants quite un&s;olicitous of reaping the benefits which nature has provided for them. What it affords in its pre&s;ent rude, unimproved &s;tate, is &s;olely given up to the gain of others, as if not the people only were to be &s;old for &s;laves to their fellow-creatures, but the whole country was captive, and produced its trea&s;ures merely for the u&s;e and benefit of the re&s;t of the world, and not at all for their own. In&s;tead of making &s;laves of the&s;e people, would it not rather become nations, who a&s;&s;ume the name and character of Chri&s;tians, to give them a reli&s;h for the ble&s;&s;ings of life, by extending traffic into their country in the large&s;t extent it will admit of, and introducing among them the more civilized arts and cu&s;toms? While the &s;laving trade continues to be the great object of" other nations, and the&s;e "promote the &s;pirit of butchery and making &s;laves of each other among the negro princes and chiefs, their civilization, and the exten&s;ion of trade into the bowels of the country, will be ob&s;tructed."</P>

The Greeks and Romans, amid&s;t their improve|ments in philo&s;ophy, arts and &s;ciences, e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;lavery as far as they extended their conque&s;ts. Their rage for conque&s;t had the world for its ob|ject. They made war without having received any injury. Captives taken in war were expo&s;ed to &s;ale. And indeed all the ancient nations con&s;ider|ed conque&s;t as a ju&s;t foundation for &s;lavery. Some moderns have undertaken to defend the &s;ame prin|ciple. In an age and country &s;o well acquainted with the rights of men, this kind of rea&s;oning me|rits very little attention. It is, moreover, wholly inapplicable to the ca&s;e of African &s;lavery. What|ever ju&s;t dominion conquerors may claim over the conquered mu&s;t be founded in this, that the latter were the aggre&s;&s;ors. Did the Africans fir&s;t invade the rights of the nations who have carried on the &s;lave trade? or give them a foundation of com|plaint? Were they ever conquered by their foreign invaders?</P>
<P>But the rea&s;oning is not le&s;s unju&s;t than inappli|cable. The objects of a ju&s;t war are the &s;ecurity of national rights, and indemnification for injuries. Superior force may en&s;lave, but gives no right. It is inglorious, &s;avage and brutal to in&s;ult a conquer|ed enemy, and reduce him to the lowe&s;t &s;ervility.</P>

"Thou maye&s;t not," &s;aid God, "con&s;ume them at once, le&s;t the land become de&s;olate, and the bea&s;ts of the field increa&s;e again&s;t thee. By little and little will I drive them out from before thee." Of tho&s;e nations, remain|ing in the land, they might purcha&s;e bond-&s;ervants, and tran&s;mit them as an inheritance to po&s;terity. The Gibeonites, one of the&s;e devoted nations, ob|tained a league of peace with Jo&s;hua, under pre|tence that they were a very remote people. When their &s;tratagem was detected, he &s;aved them alive, becau&s;e of his league; but he made them all bond|men, hewers of wood, and drawers of water. (Lev. 25. 44, 45, 46. Jo&s;hua chap. 9th) When a like warrant can be produced, it will authorize a like practice.</P>
<P>"But I&s;hmael was the &s;on of a bond-woman. His po&s;terity therefore can have no claim to free|dom." This is not a ju&s;t con&s;equence; nor is this objection &s;upported by hi&s;tory. The prophecy con|cerning I&s;hmael was, "He will be a wild man; his hand will be again&s;t every man, and every man's hand again&s;t him." His po&s;terity, the Arabians, have lived in war with the world. The Egyptians, A&s;&s;yrians, Per&s;ians, Greeks, Romans, Tartars and Turks have in vain attempted to &s;ubjugate them. They have been and are free and independent.</P>
<P>That the heathen have no right to any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion on earth, is an article of the Roman faith. The charters of Britain to her late colonies held out the &s;ame language. But is this the language of HIM, who&s;e is "the world, and they that dwell therein?" who "hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth; and deter|mined the bounds of their habitation?" In en&s;lav|ing the <HI>pagans</HI> of Africa, have the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of Eu|rope

<P>Our late warfare was expre&s;sly founded on &s;uch principles as the&s;e: "All men are created equal: They are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; among the&s;e are life, liberty, and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s." Admitting the&s;e ju&s;t principles, we need not puzzle our&s;elves with the que&s;tion, whether a black complexion is a to|ken of God's wrath? If attempts to account for the color of the blacks, by a&s;cribing it to climate, or the &s;tate of &s;ociety, or both, &s;hould not be per|fectly &s;atisfactory, (and perhaps they are not) &s;hall
<PB N="29" REF="023308_0028_0FBEF03DB9930B50">
we therefore conclude, that they did not &s;pring from the &s;ame original parents? How then &s;hall we ac|count either for <HI>their</HI> origin or our <HI>own?</HI> The Mo|&s;aic, which is the only account of the origin of man|kind, doth not inform us what was the complexion of Adam and Eve. If we admit the Mo&s;aic ac|count, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e that the Africans are of a different &s;pecies from us: If we reject it, we have no account whence they or we &s;prang. Let us then receive the Mo&s;aic hi&s;tory of the creation, till ano|ther and better appears. According to that, the Africans are our brethren. And, according to the principles of our religion, they are <HI>children of the free-woman as well as we.</HI> This in&s;tructs us, that <HI>God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, or of nations</HI>&mdash;<HI>hath put no difference between Jew and Greek, barbarian and Scythian.</HI> In Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in whom it was fore|told "all nations &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed," tho&s;e "who &s;ometimes were far off, are brought nigh, and have acce&s;s by one Spirit unto the Father." So that they "are no more &s;trangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the &s;aints, and of the hou&s;hold of God." The heathen will all be given him for his inheritance, and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Why then &s;hould we treat our African brethren as the elder &s;on in the parable treated the younger, offended at the compa&s;&s;ion of their common parent towards him? Why place them in a &s;ituation in|capable of recovery from their lo&s;t &s;tate? their &s;tate of moral death? Did Je&s;us come to redeem us from the wor&s;t bondage? Shall his di&s;ciples then en&s;lave tho&s;e whom he came to redeem from &s;lavery? who are the purcha&s;e of his blood? Is this <HI>doing to others,</HI> as he hath commanded, <HI>what&s;oever we would that</HI> they <HI>&s;hould do to</HI> us? Is it to <HI>love our neighbour as our&s;elves?</HI></P>

On a view of the wretched &s;ervitude of the Afri|cans, &s;ome may &s;u&s;pect, that they mu&s;t have been <HI>&s;inners above all men, becau&s;e they &s;uffer &s;uch things.</HI> This way of rea&s;oning, however common, our Lord has reproved&mdash;particularly in the in&s;tance of the blind man; of tho&s;e who were &s;lain by the fall of the tower in Siloam; and of tho&s;e who&s;e blood Pilate mingled with the public &s;acrifices. All mankind are <HI>the offspring of God.</HI> His govern|ment over them is <HI>parental.</HI> Children may have the fulle&s;t proof that the government of their fa|ther is not capricious and tyrannic, but mo&s;t wi&s;e and kind: At the &s;ame time, they cannot explain many parts of it; but unre&s;ervedly &s;ubmit to his plea&s;ure, having the fulle&s;t confidence in his &s;upe|rior wi&s;dom, his paternal care and affection.</P>
<P>That &s;uch as have been educated in &s;lavi&s;h prin|ciples, ju&s;tify and practi&s;e &s;lavery, may not &s;eem &s;trange. Tho&s;e who profe&s;s to under&s;tand and re|gard the principles of liberty &s;hould cheerfully u|nite to aboli&s;h &s;lavery.</P>
<P>Our middle and northern &s;tates have prohibited any further importation of &s;laves. South-Carolina pa&s;&s;ed a prohibitory act for a limited time. Con|&s;i&s;tently with the federal con&s;titution the traffic may be &s;topped in &s;eventeen years; and a duty often dol|lars may be laid on every &s;lave now imported. By an act of the legi&s;lature of Connecticut, all blacks and mulattoes born within the &s;tate from March 1784, will be manumitted at the age of 25 years. The act of Penn&s;ylvania liberates them at the age of twenty eight years. Such provi&s;ion hath been made for the gradual abolition of &s;lavery in the United States. Could wi&s;dom and philanthropy have advanced further for the time?</P>
<P>In the northern divi&s;ion of the United States, the &s;laves live better than one quarter of the white
<PB N="31" REF="023308_0030_0FBEF0423A41E8F0">
people. Their ma&s;ters are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of property; nor is harder labor required of the &s;laves, than a great part of the ma&s;ters perform them&s;elves. Might the e&s;tate of the ma&s;ters be exempt from the main|tenance of their &s;laves, but very few would he&s;itate to manumit them.</P>
<P>In co-operating with the wi&s;e mea&s;ures and be|nevolent intentions of the legi&s;lature of Connecticut, we &s;hall do as much as can be de&s;ired to ca&s;e the condition of &s;lavery, and extingui&s;h the odious di&s;|tinction. Humane ma&s;ters, requiring no more than is ju&s;t and equal, and affording to their &s;ervants the means of moral and religious in&s;truction, take the only &s;ure cour&s;e to make them faithful. Many re|ceive &s;uch kind treatment, and have &s;uch affection to their ma&s;ters, that they wi&s;h to abide with them. Nor is it to be doubted but many others, who may wi&s;h to be manumitted, would &s;oon repent their choice. Still the term <HI>&s;lave</HI> is odious, be the ma&s;|ter's yoke ever &s;o light. And it is very que&s;tion|able whether any &s;ervant can be <HI>profitable</HI> who is not a <HI>voluntary</HI> one.</P>
<P>The revolution in the United States hath given free cour&s;e to the principles of liberty. One anci|ent kingdom, illuminated by the&s;e principles, and actuated by the &s;pirit of liberty, hath e&s;tabli&s;hed a free con&s;titution. The &s;pirit will &s;pread, and &s;hake the throne of de&s;potic princes. Neither an habit of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to arbitrary rule in church and &s;tate, nor the menaced interference of neighboring king|doms, could prevent, or counterwork, a revolution, propitious in its a&s;pect on the rights of other nati|ons, and of mankind. No combination of Euro|pean potentates can impede the progre&s;s of free|dom. The time is ha&s;tening, when their &s;ubjects will not endure to be told, that no government &s;hall exi&s;t in any nation but &s;uch as provides for the
<PB N="32" REF="023308_0031_0FBEF04556354998">
perpetuation of <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> monarchy, and the tran&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of it to the families in <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The time is ha&s;tening, when no monarch in Europe &s;hall tell his &s;ubjects, <HI>Your &s;ilver and your gold are mine.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent occa&s;ion will be well improved, if we &s;et our&s;elves to bani&s;h <HI>all</HI> &s;lavi&s;h principles, and a&s;&s;ert our liberty as men, citizens and Chri&s;tians. We have all one Father: He will have all his off|&s;pring to be &s;aved. We are di&s;ciples of one ma&s;|ter: He will finally <HI>gather together in one the chil|dren of God.</HI> Let us unite in carrying into effect the purpo&s;e of the Saviour's appearance. This was to give <HI>peace and good will to man,</HI> and thus bring <HI>glory to God on high.</HI></P>
<P>Being "one body in Chri&s;t, and every one mem|bers one of another;" we &s;hould take care "that there be no &s;chi&s;m in the body." They who &s;epa|rate them&s;elves, or &s;eparate others, without cau&s;e, are &s;chi&s;matics. Chri&s;t is not divided. A <HI>religi|ous</HI> party is of all others the mo&s;t odious and dan|gerous. The terms expre&s;s a palpable contradic|tion. The dire effe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s of pro&s;elyting zeal in Ro|mi&s;h, and even in Prote&s;tant, countries would have been prevented, had Chri&s;tian liberty been under|&s;tood, and the exerci&s;e of it permitted.</P>
<P>Whether ignorance or learning, weakne&s;s or craft, have bound the heavie&s;t burthens in religion, we need not enquire. Each of them hath done much in this way in ages pa&s;t. Happily for the pre&s;ent age of light and liberty, the &s;pirit of bigotry and domi|nation cannot encumber and deba&s;e Chri&s;tianity as heretofore. The exerci&s;e of private judgment, an appeal to the &s;criptures, and the cultivation of Chri&s;tian charity and philanthropy, will di&s;play the excellency of our religion.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="023308_0032_0FBEF0472FA9EF50">
To conclude: In vain do we a&s;&s;ert our natural and civil liberty, or contend for the &s;ame liberty in behalf of any of our fellow-creatures, provided we our&s;elves are not made free from the condemnation and dominion of &s;in. If there is &s;uch a thing as &s;lavery, the &s;ervant of &s;in is a &s;lave&mdash;and <HI>&s;elf-made.</HI> The captive, pri&s;oner and &s;lave, in an outward re|&s;pect, may be free in Chri&s;t, free indeed; while he who enjoys full external liberty, may, in regard to his inward man, be under the power of wicked &s;pi|rits: The&s;e enter and dwell in an heart garni&s;hed to receive them. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and no other, &s;aveth from &s;in and wrath. The &s;pirit of life quickeneth tho&s;e who are dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and loo&s;eth tho&s;e whom Satan hath bound. "If we be dead with him, we believe that we &s;hall al&s;o live with him."</P>
<P>The new Jeru&s;alem is free in a more exalted &s;en&s;e than the church on earth. True believers, "&s;ealed with the holy Spirit of promi&s;e, have the <HI>earne&s;t</HI> of their inheritance, until the redemption of the purcha&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion." In that day of com|plete redemption, of glorious liberty, may God of his infinite mercy grant that we may meet all the ran&s;omed of the Lord, with &s;ongs and everla&s;ting joy, &s;aying: "Ble&s;&s;ing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that &s;itteth upon the throne; and unto the lamb who was &s;lain, and hath redeemed us to God by his blood, out of e|very kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation. AMEN."</P>
