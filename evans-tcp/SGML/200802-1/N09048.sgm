<P>THE Religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is friendly to civil Go|vernment, advantageous to every age, prohibits nothing but Immorality; it enjoins Obedience to the King as Supreme, and publi&s;hes on Earth Peace and Good-Will among Men; while the Leaven of the Phari&s;ee aims to fru&s;trate every office of Love, and di&s;unite the World: for which rea&s;on, our High-Prie&s;t and common Redeemer warned his di&s;ciples to take heed and beware of the doc|trines
<PB N="4" REF="011551_0003_0F87253B9DFBBC48">
of tho&s;e men, which &s;upplanted the Power of God|line&s;s, by crying up with zeal Forms and Trifles to ex|piate Wickedne&s;s by Force of Super&s;tition. Chri&s;t up|braided tho&s;e people not barely for their exactne&s;s in tything Mint, Annis, and Cummin, but for neglecting the weightier matters of the Law, Ju&s;tice, Mercy, and Faith; and becau&s;e they had rendered void the Commandments of God, by their Traditions, in legitimizing Hypocri&s;y, inward Impurities, feigned Prayers, and De&s;truction of Widows Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>If we &s;urvey the Character of the Phari&s;ees and Saddu|cees, we &s;hall find them meeting in the two extremes; one judging it&s;elf bound to per&s;ecute all who differ in opinion from a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;tandard; the other, as if born in &s;ome frigid zone&punc; &s;eemed unaffected with the power and charm of Religion, and wholly indifferent about its doctrines, provided they once in &s;even days wore a Jewi&s;h &s;abbatic devotion.&mdash;The radical error of the fir&s;t cla&s;s lies in a con|fident pre&s;umption of their own infallible judgment; there|fore, zealou&s;ly blind, they give the di&s;&s;enters from them liberty to conform or burn. The error of the &s;econd cla&s;s originates from a di&s;tru&s;t of the Divinity of Chri&s;t; hence they live without Faith, and the former without Charity. &mdash;To avoid tho&s;e two dangerous extremes, which have long divided this world, let us copy the behaviour of Chri&s;t towards the various &s;ects among the Jews.</P>
<P>The E&s;&s;enes were numerous, and held many fanta&s;tical opinions, yet we find no reflections made on them; while the Phari&s;ees and Sadducees were &s;everely and ju&s;tly ex|po&s;ed on all occa&s;ions.&mdash;Behold the rea&s;on:</P>
<P>The E&s;&s;enes, though mi&s;taken in many things, were
<PB N="5" REF="011551_0004_0F87253C52C73870">
&s;incere and harmle&s;s, quiet and peaceable, contented and ea&s;y to enjoy their own con&s;ciences, and to let other men alone: they pretended not to be infallible and tumultuous, &s;ought not after the Dictator's Chair, nor the &s;ole govern|ment of the World: they neither planned nor executed mi&s;chief again&s;t the con&s;titution; but were humble, mode&s;t, and obedient to the laws. This good di&s;po&s;ition rendered them capable of being led from their mi&s;taken opinions; while the Phari&s;ees and Sadducees were arrogant and &s;elf-&s;ufficient, in&s;laved captives to their own imagined perfec|tions, too wi&s;e to learn, too &s;anctimonious to receive in|&s;truction; &s;ubtle, &s;ly, crafty, in&s;idious projectors; men who would reign and tyrannize, or by their golden cry of Liberty &s;et the world on fire:&mdash;therefore, of their Hypocri&s;y take heed and beware.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the chapter is pointed out the rea|&s;on of this important and nece&s;&s;ary caution. Tho&s;e two &s;ects had hitherto been at enmity one with the other, like their ma&s;ters Herod and Pilate, yet they became friends in a con&s;piracy again&s;t the "I&s;raelite in whom was no Guile." Having put on a &s;olemn Demurene&s;s, (the common livery of Hypocrites,) and pretending them&s;elves &s;trangers to all the miracles wrought by Chri&s;t, they addre&s;&s;ed him with "Ma&s;ter, we wi&s;h to &s;ee a &s;ign from thee;" and very likely their petition was delivered with a tone, not to find conviction, but as a varni&s;h to their infidelity, as they a&s;ked a &s;ign from heaven which they thought would not be given. Chri&s;t, knowing their de&s;ign, expo&s;ed their fal&s;e preten&s;ions by pronouncing a truth, which for once &s;ilenced a gain&s;aying people, viz. "An adulterous and wicked generation &s;eeketh after a &s;ign from Heaven, and there &s;hall no &s;ign be given to it, but the &s;ign of the Pro|phet

Jonas:" then, turning to his Di&s;ciples, &s;aid, "Take heed and beware of the Arts and Hypocri&s;y of tho&s;e men." Hence we learn, that Men's Principles guide their Actions; that, if the Tree is good, the Fruit will be al&s;o good; and that evil Opinions are productive of evil Practices. As to the Sadducees, they denied the Exi&s;tence of Angels and Spirits, and taught, that Matter was the only Compo&s;ition of the Univer&s;e; they denied al&s;o the Immortality of the Soul, the Re&s;urrection of the Body, and a future Life; they idolized the Letter, and mi&s;took the Spirit, of the Law of Mo&s;es: but the Phari&s;ees held Opinions oppo&s;ite to them, and extolled oral Doctrines equal to the Law and Prophets, whereby their Creed varied every day, and their Devotion was muffled with new Rights and Cere|monies, totally different from their Neighbours. The event was truly melancholy: one Sect had too much Faith, the other had none: one had no Religion, no Cha|rity; the other de&s;pi&s;ed Morality, and depended on Faith. The Leaven or Art of tho&s;e Men was calculated only for this mortal Life, where Temptation is in all its Pomp; it had no Cure for a Sigh, no Balm for a wounded Heart, except what the Law of Mo&s;es, in the Sen&s;e of a provincial Code, afforded. This Leaven induced men to comply with &s;uch Cu&s;toms and Sentiments as were mo&s;t prevalent, in or|der to &s;ecure to them&s;elves temporal Intere&s;t and Dignity: and by it we find they did &s;ucceed; for the High Prie&s;t, and all the Council of the Jews, were of the Leaven. Acts v.1.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e men, by their Conduct, appear to be De&s;cendants of Cain and Nimrod: for the meek Preacher of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;tyles them a Generation of Vipers; and St. Jude calls them filthy Dreamers, empty Clouds, wandering Stars, raging Waves, foaming out their own Shame, de|&s;pi&s;ing

Dominion <HI>in others,</HI> and &s;peaking evil of <HI>Dignities.</HI> A People thus di&s;po&s;ed ought not to be tru&s;ted, &s;eeing that they contemn the Law of Liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free: yet, to the A&s;toni&s;hment of Hi&s;torians, they have too often &s;ecured to them&s;elves the Admiration, if not the Government, of the World, by their in&s;incere and &s;anctimonious Preten&s;ions; while the peaceful, meek, and truly pious men have been neglected and &s;et at nought.</P>
<P>Having thus far pointed out the Character of the Phari|&s;ees and Sadducees, and the great Propriety of the Caution given in the Text, it appears to be the Duty of the Am|ba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, in all Ages and in all Countries, to warn the Multitude again&s;t the Leaven of &s;uch de&s;igning men: for Leaven is no le&s;s infectious now than it was two thou|&s;and years ago; nor is it le&s;s baneful in America, than it has been in Africa, Europe, and A&s;ia. Of old it owned no Superior, nor Equal; therefore would not &s;uffer Chri&s;t to reign. Tho&s;e Sects were ever jealous, and fearful le&s;t they &s;hould lo&s;e <HI>their Liberty of governing:</HI> they were con&s;tant Fautors of Per&s;ecution; for, when they perceived the Pre|valence of the Humility, the Kindne&s;s, and the peaceable Doctrines of Chri&s;t, they artfully alarmed the Multitude with what they them&s;elves had no fear of, viz. "If this Man is let alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans will come in and take away our Place and Na|tion." This patriotic Pretence then &s;ucceeded with the Multitude, who &s;oon preferred Barabbas to their Saviour and Defender <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here is a remarkable Proof that the Vox Populi is not always the Voice of Ju&s;tice.</NOTE>. The Leaven, having killed the Lord of Life, &s;oon &s;pread and pervaded all States and Kingdoms, over|threw
<PB N="8" REF="011551_0007_0F87253E8ED59798">
mighty Kings, and deluged the Earth with human Blood.&mdash;As &s;oon as Chri&s;tianity found its way to the&s;e we&s;tern Climes, the Leaven, infu&s;ing the Lu&s;t of Dominion and Liberty, appeared al&s;o; where, in verity, as in the Ea&s;tern World, it has warred again&s;t the Doctrines of Chri&s;t, and his Law of Liberty, with great Succe&s;s; and Chri&s;tianity, after &s;truggling many years, &s;eems to have lo&s;t its Reputation, and is giving Way to human Policy, and is likely to be bani&s;hed from America, now half-ready to act a Part which will di&s;grace the dead, intail War on our&s;elves, and Mi&s;ery on our Children.</P>
<P>Alas, my native Country! thy be&s;t Days are expiring &mdash;thy glorious Sun of Liberty is &s;etting&mdash;thy Virtue is dying!&mdash;Yet how can I give thee up? Thou ha&s;t been unto me very plea&s;ant; I will therefore &s;eek to do thee good&mdash;I will weep Day and Night for the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of the People, and pray for the Peace of Jeru&s;alem.</P>
<P>I am no Politician, though I have long heard the Cry of Law, Con&s;titution, and Liberty; but if the <HI>Liberi</HI> mean Liberty to wor&s;hip God in the Beauty of Holine&s;s, or ac|cording to the Law of Liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free, then may Heaven maintain their Cau&s;e! But, if they mean by their Cry to hold the King's Protection, without yielding Obedience to his Authority and the Briti&s;h Parliament, I would remind them of the Charters by which we claim a legal Title to our Lands, and the Rights of Engli&s;h Subjects&mdash;Gifts and Privileges made to our Fathers, and us their Heirs, on Condition "of Obe|dience to the Laws of England, which now are or here|after &s;hall be made"&mdash;(Vide Connecticut Charter, dated 1662) &mdash; Words tantamount to the late obnoxious Clau&s;e,
<PB N="9" REF="011551_0008_0F87253FD6742B40">
which a&s;&s;erts the Supremacy of the Briti&s;h Parliament over the Colonies, in all Ca&s;es whatever; a Doctrine owned by our Fathers, and by all even in the pre&s;ent Day, except in the in&s;tance of Taxation; which Exception &s;eems trifling, after granting that our Lives [not our Money] may be taken away by a Briti&s;h Act of Parliament.&mdash;Our Fathers, though led by the great Charm of Liberty, never claimed Inde|pendence on the Crown of England; nor did the I&s;raelites, in the Wilderne&s;s, make them&s;elves a Calf, until Mo&s;es had delivered them out of Egypt, and left them under the Guidance of Aaron <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Canada was taken 1759.</NOTE>. It is wonderful that Princes, in the&s;e la&s;t Ages of the World, have not learned the Science of preventing Evils, from the Hi&s;tory of former Times, e&s;pecially from the Story of the Calf. However, Aaron exculpated him&s;elf by telling Mo&s;es, "Thou knowe&s;t the People, that they are &s;et on Mi&s;chief; for they &s;aid unto me, Make us Gods which &s;hall go before us; for as for this Mo&s;es, the man who brought us up out of the Land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him." Exod. xxxii.</P>
<P>We who are &s;tigmatized with being Sons of I&s;&s;achar, and E&s;&s;enes in Perfection, have a plentiful Crop of Mi&s;ery to gather in, if we credit the Sermons and Declarations of the multiformed Sects of Prote&s;tant-prote&s;ting A&s;&s;o|ciators, who have a&s;&s;umed a &s;elf-con&s;tituted Power of nul|lifying Acts of Parliament and the Statutes of this Colony. How far they have &s;ucceeded in the latter Ca&s;e, we already know; but the former is yet pending on the Concorpora|tion of the Civil Magi&s;trate and the Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Con&s;o|ciations.&mdash;However, as Charity hopes all things, and the

General A&s;&s;embly has adjudged as trea&s;onable the revo|lutional Principles of the Wallingsford A&s;&s;ociators and the Bill-of-Rights-men, who took the Liberty, by help of their &s;trolling Fancies, to abrogate the County Courts, and to pay their hone&s;t Debts, with the Cry of legal Re&s;i&s;tance, we may logically conclude they will not legalize Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Supreme Power of the Nation, after declaring Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t colonial Laws illegal and trea&s;onable.

<P>I have Confidence in you all, that, though &s;ome weak Di&s;ciples may decline our Communion, and go away, yet you will wi&s;ely con&s;ider to whom we &s;hall go, &s;eeing that we have for our Guide the Words of eternal Life.</P>
<P><HI>My Reverend Brethren,</HI> you cannot be unwilling to part with &s;uch Godline&s;s as is worldly Gain, when you con&s;ider the Certainty and Solemnity of a Reckoning-Day, when you mu&s;t give an Account of your Steward&s;hip, either to be ble&s;&s;ed with the Smiles of your Judge, or be ruined

with his Frowns: therefore, let us grow in Grace, and hold fa&s;t the Form of &s;ound Words; let us feed the Lambs, let us feed the Sheep, with the Glories of the everla&s;ting Covenant, and the great My&s;tery of Redemp|tion; let us dwell on the Excellencies of Immanuel, and on moral Virtue; in a word, let us propagate the Doc|trines of the Cro&s;s, and be of good Cheer, &s;eeing that Faith and Per&s;everance have overcome the World.</P>
<P><HI>Let the Prie&s;ts of the Lord, let holy and humble Men of Heart, let all the Children of Men, ble&s;s the Lord, and mag|nify him for ever; becau&s;e the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth, and &s;hall for ever reign!</HI></P>
