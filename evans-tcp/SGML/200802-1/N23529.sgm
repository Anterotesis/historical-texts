<P>FROM the amiable cha|racter I have heard of you, both in this country (where I have re&s;ided many years in the various &s;pheres of life) and in Eu|rope, I am induced to dedicate to you this publication.</P>
<P>When I la&s;t returned to this country, I did my&s;elf the honor to wait upon your Excellency, in September, 1796, before your re&s;ignation of the Pre&s;idency of the United States, and pre&s;ented to you a Poem I compo&s;ed upon the <HI>"Rural and Romantic Scenes of</HI> DOWN HILL," near Colerain, Ireland, the &s;eat of the Earl of Bri&s;tol, and Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;e of Lon|donderry&mdash;for a copy of which, many of the gentlemen of that country gave me a guinea.</P>
<P>Your Excellency was &s;o humane and conde&s;cending, as to countenance my in|tention

of publi&s;hing by &s;ub&s;cription, a Poem, &s;uited to the then pre&s;ent &s;tate of America, for which I obtained above 1200 &s;ub&s;cribers. And your Excellency's con|de&s;cending and polite letter, for tran&s;mit|ting a Poem to you at Mount Vernon, merits By mo&s;t &s;incere gratitude.</P>
<P>The Book now publi&s;hed may be u&s;e|ful to all de&s;criptions of both &s;exes, as the times are indeed alarming, and the art of contentment rendered an e&s;&s;ential &s;tudy of mankind, in pur&s;uit of <HI>real happine&s;s.</HI></P>

<P>A PREFACE, <HI>or Introduction to a book, is generally looked for, as al&s;o &s;ome account of the Author's life character, &amp;c.&mdash;but, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is a more matter of form, and of little con&s;e|quence to the public, I &s;hall limit my&s;elf in that re&s;pect, tru&s;ting, that the production alone, will be a &s;ufficient recommendation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I was born in the North of Ireland, of an Engli&s;h family, and educated in the we&s;tern part of that kingdom, chiefly in the city of Cork, by two of my uncles, clergymen of the Church of England, and early were abroad an apprentice to a merchant in the I&s;land of Tortola, in the We&s;t-Indies; but not enjoying my health there, returned to Ireland, and from thence at an early period of my life came over to America, where I remained about twenty-&s;ix years, in various &s;pheres of life; married reputably in the city of Philadelphia, and after the decea&s;e of my wife, I returned

<HEAD>Of the nece&s;&s;ary Connection between Happi|ne&s;s and Contentment.</HEAD>
<P>GOD, who is e&s;&s;entially happy in him|&s;elf, can receive no acce&s;&s;ion to his felicity by the poor contributions of men. He cannot therefore be &s;uppo&s;ed to have made them upon intuition of increa&s;ing, but communicating his happine&s;s. And this his original de&s;ign is very vi&s;ible in all the parts of his Oeconomy towards them. When lap&s;ed man had counterplotted a|gain&s;t him&s;elf, defeated the purpo&s;e of the Divine goodne&s;s, and plunged his whole nature into the oppo&s;ite &s;tate of endle&s;s mi|&s;ery: he yet reinforced his fir&s;t de&s;ign, and by an expedient as full of wonder as mercy, the death of his Son, recovers him
<PB N="8" REF="031170_0007_0FEB13452BF51128">
to his former capacity of bli&s;s. And that it might not only be a bare capacity, he has added all other methods proper to work upon a rational creature. He has &s;hewn him his danger, &s;et before him in per&s;pective that eternal Tophet, which he is advi&s;ed to &s;hun. On the other &s;ide, he has no le&s;s lively de&s;cribed the heaven|ly Jeru&s;alem, the cele&s;tial Country to which he is to a&s;pire: Nay farther, has levelled his road to it, leads him, not as he did the I&s;raelites through the wilder|ne&s;s, through intricate mazes to puzzle his under&s;tanding; through <HI>a land of drought, wherein were fiery &s;erpents and &s;corpions,</HI> Deut. viii. 15. to di&s;courage and affright him, but has in the Go&s;pel chalked out a plain, a &s;afe, nay a plea&s;ant path. as much &s;uperior both in the ea&s;e of the way, and in the end to which it leads, as Heaven is to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anaan.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By doing this, he has not only &s;e|cured our grand and ultimate happine&s;s, but provided for our intermedial al&s;o.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Chri&s;tian duties which are to car|ry us to heaven, are our refre&s;hment, our viaticum in our journey; his yoke is not to gall and fret us, but an engine by which we may with ea&s;e (and almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly) draw all the clogs and incumbrances of
<PB N="9" REF="031170_0008_0FEB13491DF8D230">
human life. For whether we take Chri&s;|tianity in its whole complex, or in its &s;e|veral and di&s;tinct branches, 'tis certainly the mo&s;t excellent, the mo&s;t compendious art of happy living: Its very ta&s;ks are re|wards, and its precepts are nothing but a divine &s;ort of alchymy, to &s;ublime at once our nature and our plea&s;ures.</P>
<P N="3">3. This may be evidenced in every par|ticular of the evangelical law: But having formerly made &s;ome attempt towards it in another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Decay of Chri&s;tian Piety.</NOTE>tract, I &s;hall not here rea&s;&s;ume the whole &s;ubject. I &s;hall only &s;ingle out one particular precept, wherein happine&s;s is not (as the others) only implied, and mu&s;t be catched at the rebound by con&s;e|quence and event; but in literally expre&s;t, and is the very matter of the duty; I mean the precepts of acquie&s;cence and <HI>Content|ment:</HI> Happine&s;s and this true genuine Contentment, being terms &s;o convertible, that to bid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be content, is but another phra&s;e for bidding us be happy.</P>
<P N="4">4. Temporal enjoyments, &s;uch as are plea&s;ure, wealth, honor, and the re&s;t, tho' they make &s;pacious pretences to the mea|&s;ure of human happine&s;s, are all of them ju&s;tly di&s;carded by the Philo&s;opher in his
<PB N="10" REF="031170_0009_0FEB134AC3EFB890">
Ethicks, upon this one con&s;ideration, that coming from abroad they may be withheld or taken from us: And our tenure being precarious we even for that rea&s;on are unhappy in our mo&s;t de&s;irable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; becau&s;e we &s;till are liable to be &s;o. And therefore he concludes, that felicity mu&s;t be pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the mind and &s;oul; which &s;tands without the reach of fortune: and in the practice of virtue, which in its own nature, and not in its contingent u&s;e, is truly good, and therefore certainly ren|ders the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;uch.</P>
<P N="5">5. But this practice being diffu&s;ed thro' the whole extent of moral duty. <HI>Epictetim</HI> thought he had de&s;erved w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll of human nature, when he drew it up in two &s;hort words, to <HI>&s;u&s;tain</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">:</HI> That is, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear with con&s;tancy adver&s;e events, and with moderation en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y tho&s;e that are pro&s;|perous.

This &s;tate of mind the Greeks expre&s;s by calling its &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, which, we know, properly &s;peaking, is one of the incommu|nicable attributes of the divine nature, and the Stoicks expre&s;sly pretend, that by it

mortal men are enabled to rival their gods; in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> phra&s;e, to make a controver&s;y with <HI>Jupiter</HI> him&s;elf. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the in|&s;olent bla&s;phemy of all independent felici|ty, chri&s;tianity acknowledges a material truth in the a&s;&s;ertion: And St. <HI>Paul</HI> de|clares of him&s;elf, that <HI>having learnt how to want and how to abound, and in whatever &s;tate he happens to be in, therewith to be con|tent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he is able to do all things through Chri&s;t that &s;trengthens him Phil. iv. 11, 12, 13.

<P N="6">6. Which great event comet about not only becau&s;e all good things are eminent|ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the divine nature, and he who by virtue and religion po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es Him, thereby is a full equivalence has every thing; but al&s;o upon human mea&s;ures, and principles of philo&s;ophy. The compen&s;ations addre&s;s to wealth, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rightly ob&s;erved, being not to increa&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but le&s;&s;en de|&s;ires. And if &s;o it will follow, that the contented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an mu&s;t be abundantly pro|vided for, being &s;o entirely &s;atisfied with what he has, as to have no de&s;ires at all. Indeed 'tis truly &s;aid of covetous men, and is equally verified of all who have any de|&s;ire to gratify that they want no le&s;s what they have than what they have not; but the rever&s;e of that paradox is really made

good by <HI>Contentment,</HI> which be&s;tows on men the enjoyment of whatever they have, and al&s;o whatever they have not; and by teaching to want nothing, abundantly &s;e|cures not to want happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="7">7. On the other &s;ide, this one grace being ab&s;ent, it is not in the power of any &s;ucce&s;s or affluence to make life a tolera|ble thing. Let all the materials of earthly happine&s;s be ama&s;t together, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lung up|on one man, they will without Content|ment be but like the fatal prize of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> trea&s;on, who was pre&s;t to death with the weight of her booty. He that has the ele|ments of felicity, and yet cannot form them into &s;atisfaction; is more de&s;perate|ly mi&s;erable than he that wants them: For he who wants them has yet &s;omething to hope for, and thinks if he had them he might be happy; but he who in&s;ignificant|ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them, has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, has not &s;o much as the flattery of an expectation; for he has nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t to de&s;ire, and yet can be as little &s;aid to enjoy.</P>
<P N="8">8. He therefore that would have the ex|tract, the quinte&s;&s;ence of happine&s;s, mu&s;t &s;eek it in Content. All outward acce&s;&s;i|ons are but the dro&s;s and earthly part: this alone is the &s;pirit, which when 'tis once &s;eparated, depends not upon the fate
<PB N="13" REF="031170_0012_0FEB135459EACFB8">
of the other; but pre&s;erves its vigor when that is de&s;troyed. St. <HI>Paul,</HI> whom I before mentioned, is a ready in&s;tance of it, who profe&s;&s;es to be <HI>content in whatever &s;tate:</HI> Contentment being not &s;o in&s;eparately linked to eternal things, but that they may &s;ub&s;i&s;t apart. That tho&s;e are often with|out it we are too &s;ure, and that it may be without them is as certainly true; though by our own default we have not &s;o many examples of it. A heart that rightly com|putes the difference between temporals and eternals, may re&s;olve with the prophet, <HI>Although the fig-tree &s;hall not blo&s;&s;om, neither &s;hall fruit be in the vides; the labor of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">live &s;hall fall, and the fields &s;hall yield no meat; the flock &s;hall be cut off from the fold, and there &s;hall he no herd in the &s;talks; yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my &s;alvation,</HI> Hab. iii. 17, 18. He that has God need not much deplore the want of any thing el&s;e: Nor can he that con&s;iders the plenty and glory of his future &s;tate, be much dejected with the want or abjectne&s;s of his pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="9">9. Yet &s;o indulgent is God to our infir|mities, that knowing how unapt our impa|tient natures are to <HI>walk</HI> only <HI>by faith, and not at all by &s;ight,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Cor. v. 7. he is plea&s;ed to give us fair antepa&s;ts of &s;atisfaction here, di&s;pen&s;es his temporal ble&s;&s;ings, tho'
<PB N="14" REF="031170_0013_0FEB13560142C100">
not equally, yet &s;o univer&s;ally, that he that has lea&s;t, has enough to oblige not only his acquie&s;cence, but his thankfulne&s;s. Though every man has not all his wi&s;hes, yet he has that which is more valuable than that he complains to want: nay which he him&s;elf could wor&s;e &s;pare were it put to his option.</P>
<P N="10">10. And now from &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ure of things, who would not expect that man|kind &s;hould be the cheerfulle&s;t part of the creation? that the <HI>&s;un &s;hould</HI> not more <HI>re|joice to run his cour&s;e,</HI> P&s;al. xix. 5. than man &s;hould to fini&s;h his: That a journey which has &s;o ble&s;&s;ed an end, and &s;uch good accommodation by the way, &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed with all imaginable alacrity, and that we &s;hould live here practicers and learners of the &s;tate of unmixed, intermi|nable joys, to which we a&s;pire. But alas, if we look upon the univer&s;ality of men, we &s;hall find it nothing &s;o, but while all other creatures glad&s;omely follow the order of their creation, take plea&s;ure in tho&s;e things God has a&s;&s;igned for them, we with a &s;ul|len perver&s;ene&s;s quarrel at what we &s;hould enjoy, and in every thing make it our bu|&s;ine&s;s, not to fit it for our u&s;e, but to find out &s;ome concealed quality which may render it unfit. We look in&s;idiou&s;ly upon our ble&s;&s;ings, like men that de&s;igned only
<PB N="15" REF="031170_0014_0FEB1357A50CC590">
to pick a quarrel, and &s;tart a pretence for mutining. From hence it is that man who was de&s;igned the lord of the world, to who&s;e &s;atisfaction all inferior beings were to contribute, is now the unhappie&s;t of the creatures: Nay as if the whole order of the univer&s;e were inverted, he becomes &s;lave to his own va&s;&s;als, courts all the&s;e lit|tle &s;ublunary things with &s;uch pa&s;&s;ion, that if they prove coy and fly his embraces, he is mad and de&s;perate; if they fling them|&s;elves into his arms, he is then glutted and &s;atiated; like Amnon, <HI>he hates more than he loved,</HI> 2 Sam. xiii. 15. and is &s;icker of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, than he was of his de&s;ire.</P>
<P N="11">11. And thus will it ever he, till we can keep our de&s;ires more at home, and not &s;uffer them to ramble after things with|out our reach. That hone&s;t Roman, who from his extraordinary indu&s;try upon his little &s;pot of ground, received &s;uch an in|crea&s;e, as brought him under &s;u&s;picion of witchcraft, is a good example for us. God has placed none of us in &s;o barren a &s;oil, in &s;o forlorn a &s;tate, but there is &s;ome|thing in it which may afford us comfort; let us hu&s;band that to the utmo&s;t, and it is &s;carce imaginable what improvement, even he that appears the mo&s;t mi&s;erable, may make of his condition. But if in a &s;ullen humour we will not cultivate our own
<PB N="16" REF="031170_0015_0FEB135B9E23AED8">
field, becau&s;e we have perhaps more mind to our neighbors, we may thank our&s;elves if we &s;tarve. The de&s;pi&s;ing of what God has already given us, is &s;ure but cold in|vitation to farther bounty. Men are in|deed forced &s;ometimes to reward the mu|tinous; but God is not &s;o to be attacked, nor is it that &s;ort of violence which can e|ver force heaven. The Heathen could &s;ay, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> &s;ent his plagues among the poorer &s;ort of men, becau&s;e they were always repining: And indeed there is &s;o much of truth in the ob&s;ervation, that our impatience and di&s;content at our pre&s;ent condition, is the greate&s;t provocation to God to make it wor&s;e.</P>
<P N="12">12. It mu&s;t therefore be re&s;olved to be very contrary to our intere&s;t, and &s;urely it is no le&s;s to our duty. It is &s;o if we do but own our&s;elves men, for in that is im|plied a &s;ubordination and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to that power which has made us &s;o; and to di&s;pute his management of the world, to make other di&s;tributions of it than what he has done, is to renounce our &s;ubjection, and &s;et up for dominion. But this is yet more intolerable as we are chri&s;tians, it be|ing a &s;pecial part of the evangelical di&s;ci|pline, cheerfully to conform to any condi|tion; <HI>know how to be aba&s;ed, and how to abound, to be full, and to be hungry,</HI> Phil.

<HEAD>Of God's Ab&s;olute Sovereignty.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t propo&s;ition that God is deb|tor to no man, is too clear and apparent to require much of illu&s;tration: For as he is a free agent, and may act as he plea&s;es, &s;o he is the &s;ole proprietary, and can wrongfully detain from none, becau&s;e all original right is in him&s;elf. This has been &s;o much acknowledged by the blinde&s;t hea|thens, that none of them dur&s;t make in&s;o|lent addre&s;&s;es to their gods, challenge any thing of them as of debt, but by &s;acrifices and prayers owned their dependance and wants, and implored &s;upplies. And &s;ure, chri&s;tianity teaches us not to be more &s;au|cy. If tho&s;e deities who owed their very being to their votaries, were yet acknow|ledged to be the &s;pring and &s;ource of all, we can with no pretence deny it to that &s;upren&s;e power, in <HI>whom we live, move, and have our being,</HI> Acts xvii. 28. For if it were merely an act of his choice to give us a being, all his &s;ub&s;equent bounties can have no other original than his own good plea&s;ure. We could put no obligation upon God before we were; and when we began to be, we were his creatures, and &s;o by the mo&s;t indi&s;putable right owe our|&s;elves to him, but can have no antecedent

title on which to claim any thing from him: So that the apo&s;tle might well make the challenge which he doth on God's be|half, <HI>Who hath given any thing unto him, and it &s;hall be recompenced to him again?</HI> Rom. xi. 35.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now ordinary di&s;cretion teaches us, not to be too bold in our expectation from one to whom we can plead no right. It has as little of prudence as mode&s;ty, to pre&s;s impudently upon the bounty of a patron, and does but give him temptation (at lea&s;t pretence) to deny. And if it be thus with men, who po&s;&s;ibly may some|times have an intere&s;t, &s;ometimes a vanity to oblige: it mu&s;t be much more &s;o to|wards God, who cannot be in want of us, and therefore need not buy us: <HI>Our good,</HI> as the P&s;almi&s;t &s;peaks, <HI>extends not to him,</HI> P&s;al. xvi. 2. He has fundamental right in that little we are, which will &s;tand good tho' it &s;hould never be cor|roborated by greater benefits. With what an humble ba&s;hfulne&s;s should we then &s;ue for any thing, who have no ar|gument to invite the lea&s;t donation, be|ing already &s;o pre-engaged, that we can|not mortgage &s;o much as our&s;elves in con|&s;ideration of any new favor? And &s;urely, extravagant hopes do very ill befit people in this condition. We &s;ee the mode&s;ty

of good <HI>Mephibo&s;heth,</HI> tho' he was by a &s;landerous accu&s;ation outed of half the e&s;|tate <HI>David</HI> given him, yet upon a re|flection that he derived it all from his good plea&s;ure, di&s;puted not the &s;entence, but cheerfully re&s;igned to the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ure, from which he received it, &s;aying, <HI>Yea, let him take all,</HI> 2 Sam, xix. 30. A rare example, and fit for imitation, as being adapted to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, not only in that one circum&s;tance of his having re|ceived all from the king, but al&s;o in that of the attainder of his blood: which he confe&s;&s;es in the former part of the 28th ver&s;e, <HI>For all of my father's hou&s;e were but dead men before my Lord.</HI> And alas! may we not &s;ay the very &s;ame? Was not our whole race tainted in our fir&s;t parent? So that if God had not the primary title of va&s;&s;alage, he would in our fall have ac|quired that of confi&s;cation and e&s;cheat. And can we think our&s;elves then in terms to capitulate, and make our own conditi|ons, and expect God &s;hould humour us in all our wild demands?</P>
<P N="3">3. This is indeed to keep up that old rebellion of our progenitor, for that con|&s;i&s;ted in a di&s;content with that portion God had a&s;&s;igned him, and coveting what he had re&s;trained him. Nay indeed it comes up to the height of the devil's propo&s;al,

the attempting <HI>to be as God,</HI> Gen. iii. 5.

This is &s;o mad an in&s;o|lence, that were it po&s;ible to &s;tate a ca&s;e exactly parallel between man and man, it would rai&s;e the indignation of any that but pretended to ingenuity.

<P N="4">4. But as bad as it is, who is there of us, that can in this particular &s;ay, <HI>We have made our hearts clean?</HI> Prov. xx. 9. 'Tis true we make &s;ome formal acknow|ledgment &s;ometimes that we receive all from God's gift: Cu&s;tom teaches us from our infancy, after every meal we eat, to give him thanks (though even that is now thought too much re&s;pect, and begins to be di&s;carded as unfa&s;hionable:) yet &s;ure he cannot be thought to do that in earne&s;t, that has all the time of his eat|ing been grumbling that his table abounds not with &s;uch delicacies as his neigbors. And yet at this rate God knows are mo&s;t of our than&s;kgivings. Indeed we have not &s;o much ordinary civility to God, as we have to men. The common proverb
<PB N="26" REF="031170_0025_0FEB1377F8DBF050">
teaches us, not to pry too curiou&s;ly into the blemi&s;hes of what is given us; but on God's gifts we fit as cen&s;ors, nicely exa|mine every thing which is in any way di&s;|agreeable to our fancies, and as if we dealt with him under the notion of chapmen, di&s;parage it, as <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, buyers u&s;e to do, <HI>It is naught, it is naught &s;aith the buy|er,</HI> Prov. xx. 14.

'Tis true indeed, God's thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor our narrow bowels equal mea&s;ures for the devine com|pa&s;&s;ion; and we experimentally find that his long-&s;uffering infinitely exceeds ours; yet we know he does in the parable of the lord and the &s;ervant, <HI>Matt. xxviii.</HI> declare, that he will proportion his mercy by ours, in that in&s;tance; and we have no promi&s;e that he will not do it in this; nay we have all rea&s;on to expect he &s;hould: For &s;ince his wi&s;dom prompts him to do nothing in vain, and all his bounty to us is de&s;igned to make us happy, when he &s;ees that end utterly fru&s;trated by our di&s;contents, to what purpo&s;e &s;hould he continue that to which we will be never the better for?</P>

A &s;ad and di&s;mal inver&s;ion, yet founded wholly in the want of that cheerful recognition which God expected from them. And if I&s;rael, the lot of his inheritance, that people whom he had &s;ingled out from all the nations of the world, could thus for|feit his favor by unthankfulne&s;s, &s;ure none of us can &s;uppo&s;e we have any &s;urer entail of it.

<P>TO regulate our e&s;timate of tho&s;e things which we either enjoy or &s;uffer, there are three precedent queries to be made: The fir&s;t of their number of plenty, the &s;econd of their weight, the third of their con&s;tan|cy and continuance; for according as they partake more of the&s;e properties, every good is more good, and every evil is more evil.

<P N="2">2. And fir&s;t in part of plenty, the mercies of God are the &s;ource of all our good, are &s;et out to us in holy &s;cripture in the mo&s;t &s;upurlative &s;train.

<HEAD>Of God's general Providence.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN God made the univer&s;e, he intended not only to glorify him&s;elf in one tran&s;ient act of his power, and then leave this great and wonderful production of his, as the <HI>o&s;trich her eggs in the wilderne&s;s,</HI> Lam. iv. 3. but having drawn it out of its fir&s;t chaos, he &s;ecured it from returning thither again, by e&s;tabli&s;hing as a due &s;ymmetry of parts, &s;o al&s;o a regular order of motion: Hence it is that the heavens have their con&s;tant revolutions, the earth its &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of determinate &s;ea&s;ons, ani|mals their alternate cour&s;e of generation and corruption; and by this wi&s;e econo|my, the world after &s;o many thou&s;and years, &s;eems &s;till in its &s;pring and fir&s;t beauty. But it had been in vain to have thus &s;ecured the defection of the crea|tures, if man for who&s;e &s;ake they were made had been excluded from this care. His faculty of rea&s;on would have made him but the more fatal in&s;trument of con|fu&s;ion, and taught him the more com|pendious ways of di&s;turbing the world. <HI>Job</HI> compares him <HI>to the wild a&s;&s;es colt,</HI> Job xi. 12. which takes its range without ad|verting to any thing of the common good.
<PB N="106" REF="031170_0105_0FEB1451E3286D60">
God has therefore doubly hedged in this unruly creature, made a fence of laws about him (both natural and po&s;itive) and be&s;ides has taken him into the common circle of his providence, &s;o that he, as well as the re&s;t of the creation, has his particular &s;tation a&s;&s;igned him; and that not only in reference to other creatures, but him&s;elf; has put a difference between one man and another, ordained &s;everal ranks and cla&s;&s;es of men, and endowed them with &s;pecial and appropriate qualifi|cations for tho&s;e: &s;tations wherein he has &s;et them.</P>
<P N="2">This, as it is a work of infinite wi&s;|dom in God, &s;o it is of un&s;peakable ad|vantage to men. Without this regular di&s;po&s;ure, the world would have been in the &s;ame confu&s;ion which we read of in the ho&s;t of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ianlles, every man's &s;word again&s;t his fellow.</HI> Judg. vii. 22. Nothing but force could determine who &s;hould do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> or enjoy any thing; and even that deci&s;ion al&s;o would have been repeal|able by a greater forces: So that we have all rea&s;on to confe&s;s the utility of that or|der God has &s;et among men; and even he that bears the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;pica|ble place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, is certainly infinitely more happy by contributing to that general har|mony
<PB N="107" REF="031170_0106_0FEB1453892BD2F8">
than he could be in any &s;tate of di&s;cord.</P>
<P N="3">Were this now well con&s;idered, methinks it &s;hould &s;ilence all our complaints, and men &s;hould not be &s;o vehemently con|cerned in what part of the &s;tructure it plea&s;es the great Architect to put them; for every man is to look on him&s;elf only as a &s;mall parcel of tho&s;e materials which God is to put into form. Every &s;tone is not fit for the corner, not every little rafter for the main beam: The wi&s;dom of the Ma&s;ter-builder is alone to determine that. And &s;ure there cannot be a more vile contempt of the divine wi&s;dom than to di&s;pute his choice. Had God wi&s;dom enough to contrive this va&s;t and beautiful fabric, and may he not be tru&s;ted with one of us poor worms? Did he by his <HI>wi&s;dom make the heavens, and by his under|&s;tanding &s;tretch out the clouds;</HI> Prov. iii. 19. and &s;hall he not know where to place a little lump of figured earth? This is cer|tainly the mo&s;t ab&s;urd di&s;tru&s;t imaginable, and yet this is really the true meaning of our repining at the condition he has placed us in.</P>
<P N="4">The truth is, we are &s;o full of our|&s;elves, that we can &s;ee nothing beyond it: Every man expects God &s;hould place him

where he has a mind to be, though by it he di&s;compo&s;e the whole &s;cheme of his providence.

We are apt enough, I am &s;ure, to tax it not only as a weakne&s;s, but inju&s;tice too in a prince, when he indulges any thing to a private favourite to the public di&s;advan|tage; yet &s;o unequal are we, that we murmur at God for not doing that which we murmur at men for doing.</P>

But if all men &s;hould have equal &s;atisfactions, we &s;hould puzzle even Omnipotence it|&s;elf. Every man would be above and &s;u|perior, yet tho&s;e are comparative terms; and if no man were below, no man could be above. So in wealth, mo&s;t men de&s;ire more, but every man does at lea&s;t de&s;ire to keep what he has; how then &s;hall one part of the world be &s;upplied without the diminution of the other, unle&s;s there &s;hould be as miraculous a multiplication of trea&s;ure for a man's avarice, as there was of loaves for their hunger, Matth. xvi. 9.

6. Yet as unrea&s;onable at it is, the mo&s;t of us do betray &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion. No man is di&s;contented that there are lower, as well as higher degrees in the world, that there are poor as well as rich, but all &s;en&s;ible men a&s;&s;ent to the fitne&s;s of it; yet if them&s;elves happen to be &s;et in the lower form, they exclaim as if the whole order of the world were &s;ubverted; which is a palpable indication that they think that Providence which governs others &s;hould &s;erve them, and di&s;tribute to them not what it, but them&s;elves think good. This immoderate &s;elf-love is the &s;pring and root of mo&s;t of our complaints, makes us &s;uch unequal judges in our own con|cerns, and prompts us to put in caveats and exceptions on our own behalf, as <HI>David</HI> did on his &s;on's, <HI>See that thou hurt not the young man Ab&s;alom,</HI> 2 Sam. xviii. 5. as if God were to manage the govern|ment of the world with a particular re|gard to our liking, and were like the an|gels at <HI>Sodom,</HI> Gen. xix. 22. to <HI>do nothing till we had got into Zoar,</HI> had all our de|mands &s;ecured to us.</P>

there were not &s;omething of fraud or in|ju&s;tice, which like a canorous humour, mixt in its very elements and con&s;titution, and eat out its bowels: Or whether &s;ome &s;acrilegious prize, &s;ome coal from the al|tar have not fired his ne&s;t.

&s;ome concealed &s;in of his would not if it were known, incur as great &s;candal. For in that ca&s;e he has in right forfeited his reputation, and God may make the &s;eiz|ure as well by an unju&s;t, as a ju&s;t accu&s;a|tion. Or if his heart accu&s;e him not here, yet let him further reflect, whether; his vain-glorious pur&s;uits of prai&s;e and high conceits of him&s;elf, have not made this an apt and nece&s;&s;ary humiliation for him. Or la&s;tly, let him recollect how he has be|haved him&s;elf towards others in this kind: Whether he has had a ju&s;t tenderne&s;s of his neighbour's fame, or has not rather expo&s;ed and pro&s;tituted it. In the&s;e and many other in&s;tances &s;uch a particular &s;crutiny would (in all probability, di&s;co|ver the affinity and cognation between our guilts and our puni&s;hments, and by mark|ing out the &s;pring and fountain-head, di|rect us how to &s;top or divert the current.

<P N="5">A &s;econd benefit which God de&s;igns us in our afflictions, is the weaning us from the world, to di&s;entangle us from its &s;et|ters

We read in the &s;tory of the deluge that &s;o long as the earth was covered with wa|ters, the very raven was contented to take &s;helter in the ark, but when all was fair and dry, even the dove finally for&s;ook it, Gen. viii. 12. And it is much &s;o with us: The wor&s;t of men will commonly in di&s;tre&s;&s;es have recour&s;e to God (the very heathen mariners in a &s;torm could rebuke <HI>Jonah</HI> for not calling upon his God, Jon. i. 6.) when yet the very be&s;t of us are apt to forget him amid&s;t the blandi&s;hments and in&s;inuations of pro&s;perity. The kind a&s;pects of the world are very enchanting, apt to inveigle and be&s;ot us; and there|fore it is God's care over us, to let us &s;ometimes &s;ee her more averting counte|nance in her frowns and &s;torms; that, as children frighted by &s;ome ugly appear|ance, we may run into the arms of our Father. Alas! were all things exactly &s;itted to our humours here, when &s;hould we think of a remove? and had not death &s;ome harbingers to prepare us for him, what a &s;urpri&s;ing gue&s;t would he be to us? 'Tis &s;toried of <HI>Antigonus,</HI> that &s;eeing a &s;oldier in his camp of &s;o daring a cou|rage, that he always courted the mo&s;t ha|zardous attempts, and ob&s;erving him al&s;o of a very infirm &s;ickly habit, he took a

particular care of him, and by medicines and good attendance recovered him; which no &s;ooner had he done, but the man grew more cautious, and would no longer expo&s;e him&s;elf as formerly, and gave this rea&s;on for it, that now he was healthy, his life was of &s;ome value to him, and not to be hazarded at that &s;ame rate, as when it was only a burden; and &s;hould God cure all our complaints, render us perfectly at ea&s;e, I fear too many of us would be of the &s;oldier's mind, think our lives to good to re&s;ign to him, much more to hazard for him, as our Chri&s;ti|anity in many ca&s;es obliges us. The &s;on of <HI>Syrach</HI> ob&s;erves, how <HI>dreadful death is to a man that is at re&s;t in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that hath abundance of all things, and hath no|thing to vex him;</HI> nay he de&s;cends much lower, and puts in him <HI>who is yet able to receive meat,</HI> Ecclus. xiv. 1. The truth is, we do &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately doat upon the world, that like be&s;otted lovers we can bear a great deal of ill u&s;age, before we quit our pur&s;uit. Any little &s;light favour atones us after multiplied affronts, and we mu&s;t be di&s;ciplined by repeated di&s;ap|pointments, e'er we can withdraw our confidence.

<P N="6">Indeed it is one of the highe&s;t in|&s;tances of God's love, and of his clemen|cy al&s;o, thus to project our reducement. We were all in our bapti&s;m affianced to him, with a particular abrenunciation of the world, &s;o that we cannot without the greate&s;t di&s;loyalty ca&s;t our&s;elves into its embraces; and yet when we have thus <HI>broken the covenant of our God,</HI> God, Prov. ii. 17. he does not pur&s;ue us with a jealous rage, with the &s;everity which an abu&s;ed rivalled kindne&s;s would &s;ugge&s;t; doth not give us a bill of divorce and di&s;claim his rela|tion; but contrives how he may reclaim and bring us back to him&s;elf. The tran|&s;cendency of this lenity God excellently de&s;cribes by the prophet in the ca&s;e of <HI>I&s;|rael, They &s;ay, if a man put away his wife, and &s;he become another man's, &s;hall he return unto her again? but thou ha&s;t played the har|lot with many lovers, yet return unto me &s;aith the Lord?</HI> Jer. iii. 1. And this, though a great height of indulgence, is no more than he daily repeats to us. After we have ba&s;ely adulterated with the world, converted our affections from God to it, he does not give us over, abandon us to our lewd cour&s;e, and con&s;equent ruin; but &s;till invites our return: and le&s;t that

may not &s;erve, he does with a great deal of holy artifice e&s;&s;ay to break that accur&s;|ed league into which we are entered, pulls off the di&s;gui&s;e in which the world court|ed us, and makes us &s;ee it as it is in it&s;elf, a &s;cene of <HI>vanity and vexation of &s;pirit,</HI> Eccles. i. 14.</P>
<P N="7">And as he does this in general, &s;o al&s;o with a particular application to tho&s;e temporal &s;atisfactions wherewith we were mo&s;t tran&s;ported. The things to which we are more indifferent do not &s;o much endanger us; it is tho&s;e upon which we have more vehemently &s;et our hearts, which become our &s;nares, and awake his jealou&s;y; and accordingly we frequently &s;ee that it is in tho&s;e he chu&s;es to cro&s;s us. How often does it happen that tho&s;e which are enamoured of them&s;elves, dote upon their own features, do meet with &s;ome di&s;ea&s;e or accident which bla&s;ts their beauty, withers that fair flower, and makes their winter overtake their &s;pring? So in our friends and relations it is u&s;ually &s;een, we &s;oone&s;t loo&s;e tho&s;e for whom we have the greate&s;t, the mo&s;t immode|rate pa&s;&s;ion. If there be one fondling among our children, it is odds but that is taken away, or made as much the ob|ject of our grief and &s;orrow, as ever it was of our joy and love. When God

&s;ees our hearts &s;o exce&s;&s;ively cleave to any tran&s;itory thing, he knows it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ever them, for whil&s;t we have &s;uch clogs upon us, <HI>our &s;ouls will cleave to the du&s;t,</HI> will not be able to &s;oar up to the highe&s;t Region for which they are de|&s;igned.</P>
<P N="8">In a word, God &s;o loves us, that he removes whatever he &s;ees will ob&s;truct that intimate union which he de&s;ires with us; and &s;ure this is &s;o obliging, that though he &s;hould bid us to our lo&s;s, tho' he could not recompence us for what he takes from us, yet we mu&s;t be very ill-natured if we can be angry at &s;o much kindne&s;s. But when to this is added, that all this is principally, nay, &s;olely de|&s;igned for our advantage, that God takes from us all the&s;e empty delu&s;ory content|ments, merely that he may in&s;tate us in &s;olid and durable joys; we betray as much ignorance of our intere&s;t, as in&s;en&s;ible|ne&s;s of our obligation, if we repine that God makes us &s;o much his care. It is true indeed, the things to which we have &s;o inordinately adhered, do &s;tick &s;o clo&s;e, that they cannot be pulled away without &s;ome pain: yet for our corporal &s;ecurity we can endure the &s;undering of parts that do not only cleave, but grow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o us.

that has a gangrened member, &s;uffers it to be cut off to &s;ave his whole body, and does not revile, but thank and reward the &s;urgeon. Yet where our &s;ouls are con|cerned, and where the things have no native union with us, but are only ce|mented by our pa&s;&s;ions, we are impatient of the method, and think God deals very hardly with us, not to to let us peri&s;h with what we love. The &s;um of all is this, God, though he be abundantly con|de&s;cending, yet he will never &s;toop &s;o low as to &s;hare his intere&s;t in us with the world: If we will devote our&s;elves to it, it is not all our empty forms of &s;ervice will &s;atisfy him; if we cannot divorce our hearts from it, he will divorce him&s;elf eternally from us. And the ca&s;e being thus, we are &s;urely very ill advi&s;ed if we do not contentedly re&s;ign our&s;elves to his me|thods, and cheerfully endure them how &s;harp &s;oever. The only expedient we have for our own ca&s;e, is to &s;horten the cure by giving our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and not by &s;truggling to render it more difficult and painful. Let us entirely &s;urrender our wills to him, and when we have done that, we may without much pain let him take any thing el&s;e. But the more difficult we find it to be di&s;entangled from the world, the greater &s;hould our caution be again&s;t all future engagements to it. If our e&s;cape

<P N="9">A third advantage of affliction is, that it is a mark and &s;ignature of our adoption, witne&s;s of our legitimation. <HI>What &s;on is he</HI> (faith the apo&s;tle) <HI>whom the Father cha&s;ti&s;eth not? but if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be without cha&s;ti&s;ement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye ba&s;tards and not &s;ons,</HI> Heb. xii. 7, 8. <HI>Jacob</HI> clad his darling <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in a party-coloured coat, and God's favour|ites do here wear a livery interwoven with a mixture of dark and gloomy colours; their <HI>long white robes</HI> are laid up for them again&s;t they come to the <HI>marriage of the Lamb,</HI> Rev. xix. 7.

They <HI>that &s;tretch them&s;elves upon their couches, that cat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the mid&s;t of the &s;tall; that chaunt to

Nay &s;o nece&s;&s;ary is our experience towards our commi&s;eration, that we &s;ee it was thought a requi&s;ite accompli&s;hment of our high-prie&s;t (that highe&s;t example of unbound|ed compa&s;&s;ion) and therefore &s;aith the apo&s;tle, <HI>It behoved him in all things to be made like his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high-prie&s;t in things per|taining to God, to make reconciliation for the &s;ins of the people, for in that he him&s;elf hath &s;uffered being tempted, he is able al&s;o to &s;uc|cour them that are tempted,</HI> Heb. ii. 17, 18. But if he who&s;e mere &s;en&s;e of our mi&s;eries brought him down to us, cho&s;e this expe|dient to advance his pity, how nece&s;&s;ary is it to our petrified bowels? And &s;ince God has a&s;&s;igned our mercies to our brethren as the &s;tandard by which he will proportion his to us, it is more ours than their advan|tage to have them enlarged; &s;o that when by making us ta&s;te of their cup, acquaint|ing us with the bitter reli&s;h of their &s;uf|ferings; he prepares us to a chri&s;tian &s;ym|pathy with them, it is but a remoter way of obliging and qualifying us for a more ample portion of his mercy. Nay be&s;ides the profit, there is honour accrues to us by it. Compa&s;&s;ion is one of the be&s;t pro|perties
<PB N="144" REF="031170_0143_0FEB14BAF1D13C20">
of our nature, and we unman our|&s;elves when we put it off; nay more, it is an attribute of the divinity, and the more we advance in it, the clo&s;er ap|proaches we make to him. And there|fore we have all rea&s;on to ble&s;s him for that di&s;cipline by which he promotes us in to excellent, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a grace.</P>
<P N="12">A fifth benefit of affliction, is, that it is an improvement of devotion, &s;ets us with more heartine&s;s to our prayers. Whil&s;t pro&s;perity flows in upon us, we bathe our&s;elves in its &s;treams, but are very apt to forget its &s;ource; &s;o that God is fain to &s;top the current, leave us dry and parched, that our needs may make us do what our gratitude would not, trace our ble&s;&s;ings up to the original &s;pring, and both acknowledge and invoke him as the author of all our good. This effect of afflictions is ob&s;erved by the Prophet, <HI>Lord, in trouble have they vi&s;ited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy cha&s;tening was upon them,</HI> I&s;a. xxvi. 16. And I believe I may appeal to every man's experience, whether his prayers be not more frequent and more hearty too, when he is under &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s. They how importunate are we in our petitions? how profu&s;e in our vows and promi&s;es? &s;aying with <HI>I&s;|rael, Deliver us only we pray thee this day:

and they put away the &s;trange gods from among them, and &s;erved the Lord,</HI> Jud. x. 15, 16. I confe&s;s, it is no good indica|tion of our temper, that we need thus to be put in the pre&s;s e're we will yield any thing; yet &s;ince we are &s;o di&s;ingenuous, it is a mercy in God to adapt his methods to us, to extort when we will not give; and if he can have no free-will-offerings, yet at lea&s;t to exact his tribute. Nor does he de&s;ign the effect of this &s;hould cea&s;e with the calamity that rai&s;ed it, but expects our compelled addre&s;&s;es &s;hould bring us into the way of voluntary ones, and happily en&s;nare us into piety. And indeed herein we are wor&s;e than bruti&s;h if it do not. We think it a barbarous rudene&s;s to engage a man in our affairs, and as &s;oon as we have &s;erved our own turns, never take farther notice of him. Nay indeed the very bea&s;ts may lecture us in this piece of morality, many of them paying a &s;ignal gratitude, where they have received benefits; and &s;hall we not come up at lea&s;t to their pitch! &s;hall not the endearment of our deliverance bring our Deliverer into &s;ome repute and con&s;ideration with us, and make us de&s;ire to keep up an acquaintance and intercour&s;e with him?

remembrance how &s;oon we may need him again, admoni&s;h us not to make our&s;elves &s;trangers to him. God complains of <HI>I&s;rael, Wherefore &s;ay my people, we are Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> we will come no more at thee,</HI> Jer. ii. 31. A very in&s;olent folly to renounce that de|pendance by which alone they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and no le&s;s will it be in any of us if we &s;top our recour&s;e to him becau&s;e we have had advantage by it. We have no a&s;&s;ur|ance that the &s;ame occa&s;ion &s;hall not oc|cur, but with what face can we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that intercour&s;e which in the interval we de&s;pi&s;ed?

<P N="13">Nor is it only our devotion that is thus improved by our di&s;tre&s;&s;es, but ma|ny other graces; our faith, our hope, our patience, our Chri&s;tian &s;ufferance and for|titude. It is no triumph of faith to tru&s;t God for tho&s;e good things which he gives

So al&s;o our patience owes all its opportunities of exerci&s;e to our afflictions, and con&s;equently owes al|&s;o a great part of its being to them, for we know de&s;uetude will lo&s;e habits. What imaginable u&s;e is there of patience, where there is nothing to &s;uffer? In our pro&s;per|ous &s;tate we may indeed employ our tem|perance, our humility, our caution; but patience &s;eems then an u&s;ele&s;s virtue: Nay indeed, for ought we know, may be counterfeit, till adver&s;ity bring it to the te&s;t. And yet this is the mo&s;t glorious accompli&s;hment of a Chri&s;tian, that which mo&s;t eminently conforms him to the image of his Saviour, who&s;e whole life was a perpetual exerci&s;e of this grace; and therefore we love our ea&s;e too well if we are unwilling to buy this pearl at any price.</P>
<P N="14">La&s;tly, Our thankfulne&s;s is (at lea&s;t ought to be) increa&s;ed by our di&s;|tre&s;&s;es. It is very natural for us to reflect with value and e&s;teem upon tho&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings we have lo&s;t, and we too often do
<PB N="148" REF="031170_0147_0FEB14C69D434D70">
it to aggravate our di&s;content: But &s;ure, the mo&s;t rational u&s;e of it is to rai&s;e our thankfulne&s;s for the time wherein we en|joyed them. Nay not only our former enjoyments, but even our pre&s;ent depri|vations de&s;erve our gratitude, if we con&s;ider the happy advantages we may reap from them. If we will perver&s;ely ca&s;t them away, that unworthy contempt pays no &s;cores, for we &s;till &s;tand an&s;werable in God's account for the good he de&s;igned, and we might have had by it, and we be|come liable to a new charge for our ingra|titude in thus <HI>de&s;pi&s;ing the cha&s;ti&s;ement of the Lord,</HI> Heb. xii. 5.</P>
<P N="15">And now if all the&s;e benefits of af|flictions (which are yet but imperfectly re|cited) may be thought worth con&s;idering, it cannot but reconcile us to the &s;harpe&s;t of God's methods; unle&s;s we will own our&s;elves &s;uch mere animals, as to have no other apprehen&s;ions than what our bo|dily &s;en&s;es convey to us.

Yet even in regard of that, our murmur|ings are oft very unju&s;t, for we do many times ignorantly prejudge God's de&s;igns towards us even in temporals, who fre|quently

makes a little tran&s;ient unea&s;ine&s;s, the pa&s;&s;age to &s;ecular felicities. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> when he fled our of <HI>Egypt,</HI> probably little thought that he &s;hould return thither a <HI>God unto Pharaoh,</HI> Exod. iv. 16. and as lit|tle did <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> when he was brought thi|ther a &s;lave, that he was to be a ruler there; yet as di&s;tant as tho&s;e &s;tates were, the divine Providence has &s;o connected them, that the one depends upon the other. And certainly we may often ob&s;erve the like over-ruling hand in our own di&s;tre&s;&s;|es, that tho&s;e events which we have enter|tained with the greate&s;t regret, have in the con&s;equences been very beneficial to us.</P>
<P N="16">To conclude, we have certainly both from &s;peculation and experience, a|bundant matter to calm all our di&s;quiets, to &s;atisfy our di&s;tru&s;ts, and to fix in us an entire re&s;ignation to God's di&s;po&s;als, who has de&s;igns which we cannot penetrate, but none which we need fear, unle&s;s we our&s;elves pervert them.

<HEAD>Of our Misfortunes compared with other Men's.</HEAD>
<P>WE come now to impre&s;s an equally ju&s;t and u&s;eful con&s;ideration, the com|paring of our misfortunes with tho&s;e of other men: and he that does that, will certainly &s;ee &s;o little cau&s;e to think him&s;elf &s;ingular, that he will not find him&s;elf &s;u|perlative in calamity; for there is no man living, that can with rea&s;on affirm him&s;elf to be the very unhappie&s;t man, there be|ing innumerable di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others which he knows not of, and con&s;equently can|not bring them in balance with his own. A multitude of men there are, who&s;e per|&s;ons he knows not, and even of tho&s;e he does, he may be much a &s;tranger to their di&s;tre&s;&s;es; many &s;orrows may lie at the heart of him who carries a &s;miling face, and many a man has been an object of en|vy to tho&s;e who look but on the &s;urface of his &s;tate, who yet to tho&s;e who know his private griefs appears more worthy of compa&s;&s;ion. And &s;ure this confu&s;ed un|certain e&s;timate of other men's afflictions, may divert us from all loud outcries of our own. <HI>Solon</HI> &s;eeing a friend much oppre&s;t with grief, carried him up to a town that

overlooked the city of <HI>Athens,</HI> and &s;hew|ing him all the buildings, &s;aid to him, Con&s;ider how many &s;orrows have, do, and &s;hall in future ages inhabit under all tho&s;e roofs, and do not vex thy&s;elf with tho&s;e inconveniencies which are common to mortality, as if they were only yours. And &s;ure it was good advice, for &s;uffering is al|mo&s;t as in&s;eparable and adjunct of our na|ture, as dying is; yet we do not &s;ee men very apt to embitter their whole lives by the fore&s;ight that they mu&s;t die, but &s;ee|ing it a thing as univer&s;al as inevitable, they are more forward to take up the epi|cure's re&s;olution, <HI>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 32. And why &s;hould we not look upon afflictions al&s;o as the common lot of humanity, and as we take the advantages, &s;o be content to bear the incumbrances of that &s;tate?</P>
<P N="2">But be&s;ides that allowance that is thus to be made for the unknown calamities of o|thers, if we &s;urvey but tho&s;e that lie open &amp; vi&s;ible to us, the mo&s;t of us &s;hall find e|nough to di&s;countenance our complaints.

<P N="3">It will perhaps be &s;aid, that this can|not be univer&s;ally true, for that there mu&s;t in comparative degrees be &s;ome lowe&s;t &s;tate of mi&s;ery; I grant it, but &s;till that &s;tate con&s;i&s;ts not in &s;uch an indivi&s;ible point, that any one per&s;on can have the enclo&s;ure; or if it do, it will be &s;o hard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> any to di&s;cern who that one per&s;on is, that I need to de&s;ire no fairer a compo&s;iti|on, than to have every man &s;u&s;pend his repinings, 'till he can evince his title.

<P N="4">Nay even where the exchange &s;eems more equal, where the afflictions are on both &s;ides &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial, yet a pru|dent man would &s;carce venture upon the barter.

To this purpose it were very well, if he would keep a &s;olemn catalogue of all the boun|ties, protections, and deliverances he has received from God's hand, and every night examine what acce&s;&s;ions that day has brought to the &s;um: And he that did this, would undoubtedly find &s;o many in|citations to gratitude, that all tho&s;e to di&s;|content would be &s;tifled in the croud. And &s;ince acknowledgement of God's mercies is all the tribute he exacts for them, we mu&s;t certainly look on that as an indi&s;pen&s;able duty: And therefore he that finds that God &s;hortens his hand, &s;tops the efflux of his bounty towards

him, &s;hould reflect on him&s;elf whether he be not behind in that homage by which he holds, and have not by his unthankful|ne&s;s <HI>turned away good things from him,</HI> I&s;ai. lix. 1. And if he find it &s;o (as who alas is there that may not!) he cannot &s;ure for &s;hame complain, but mu&s;t in prudence re|inforce his gratitude for what is left, as the be&s;t means to recover what he has lo&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">But his murmurs will yet be more amazingly &s;ilenced, if in the fourth place he compares the good things he enjoys with the ill he has done. Certainly this is a mo&s;t infallible cure for our impatien|cies, the holie&s;t man living being able to accu&s;e him&s;elf of &s;uch &s;ins, as would ac|cording to all human mea&s;ures of equity forfeit all ble&s;&s;ings, and pull down a great|er weight of judgment than the mo&s;t mi|&s;erable groan under. Therefore as be|fore I advi&s;ed to keep a catalogue of be|nefits received, so here it would be of u&s;e to draw up one of &s;ins committed. And doubtle&s;s he that confronts the one with the other, cannot but be a&s;toni&s;hed to find them both &s;o numerous, equally wondering at God's mercy in continuing his ble&s;&s;ings, in de&s;pite of all his provoca|tions, and at his own ba&s;ene&s;s in continu|ing his provocations in de&s;pite of all tho&s;e

ble&s;&s;ings. Indeed it is nothing but our affected ignorance of our demerits, that makes it po&s;&s;ible for us to repine un|der the &s;evere&s;t of God's di&s;pen&s;ations. Would we but ran&s;ack our hearts, and &s;ee all the abominations that lie there, nay would the mo&s;t of us but recollect tho&s;e barefaced crimes which even the world can witne&s;s again&s;t us, we &s;hould find more than enough to balance the heavie&s;t of our pre&s;&s;ures.

firm hopes upon it. All the certainty we have of it, is, that in every condition is has its unea&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that when we court a change we rather &s;eek to vary than end our mi&s;eries. And certainly he that has well impre&s;&s;ed upon his mind the vanity and vexation of the world, cannot be much &s;urpri&s;ed at any thing that befalls him in it.

We are therefore to lay it as an infallible maxim, that in this vale of tears every man mu&s;t meet with &s;orrows and di&s;a&s;ters: And then &s;ure we may take our peculiar with even|ne&s;s of temper, as being but the natural con&s;equent of our being men.

<P N="8">But even where they do not, it in the eighth place de&s;erves however to be con&s;idered how illnatured a thing it is, for any man to think him&s;elf more mi&s;erable becau&s;e another is happy; and yet this is the very thing, by which alone many men have made them&s;elves wretched: For ma|ny have created wants, merely from the envious contemplation of other men's a|bundance. And indeed there is nothing more di&s;ingenuous, or (to go higher) more diabolical. Lucifer was happy enough in his original &s;tate, yet could not think him|&s;elf &s;o, becau&s;e he was <HI>not like the mo&s;t high,</HI> I&s;a. xiv. 14.

And it is much to be doubted, that they who go thus far may complete their parallel, and endea|vor when they have opportunity to un|dermine that happine&s;s they envy. There|fore &s;ince Satan is &s;o apt to impre&s;s his whole image, where he has drawn any li|neament, it concerns us warily to guard our&s;elves, and by a chri&s;tian &s;ympathy with our brethren, <HI>rejoice with them that do rejoice,</HI> Rom. xii. 15. make the com|forts of others an allay, not an improve|ment of our own mi&s;eries.
