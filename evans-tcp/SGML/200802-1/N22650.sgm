<Q>"To be, or not to be, that is the que&s;tion.'</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN Shake&s;peare wrote this line, he had lo&s;t &s;ight of congregated nature; &s;ince, to exi&s;t, or not to exi&s;t, can never be a que&s;tion from exi&s;ting &s;ub|&s;tance.</P>
<P>Was Henry, or was not Henry, may be a que&s;|tion, to which, if the following &s;heets find approba|tion, I may give, in future, the be&s;t an&s;wer I am capable of. If rejected by the few I value, my work is done. I love fame, though I have only heard her whi&s;pers; am &s;en&s;ible &s;he incites towards the wonderful, the great and good; and that au|thors, who affect to de&s;pi&s;e her, are cowards, in&s;in|cere, and guilty of profanation; yet there is va&s;t difference in being her lover and her &s;lave. For me, I confe&s;s my&s;elf not deaf to, nor independent of the voice of the world, except in tho&s;e enraptured moments when bewitching fancy renders me in|&s;en&s;ible to the real dependencies of life. In poe&s;y, I am her &s;lave; in pro&s;e, I wi&s;h her to be mine. In private &s;orrow, &s;he has, through a gloomy pa&s;|&s;age of twenty years, proved my enchanting friend. None may condemn me; nature her&s;elf drew delu|&s;ion in the de&s;art where I was beloved by fancy,
<PB N="iv" REF="029933_0003_0FE35488C9A8F238">
before I was alive to fame, and ta&s;ted more delight than I have &s;ince found in the mid&s;t of proud &s;o|ciety, where favor falls heavily on the heart from the hand of arrogance.</P>
<P>Readers, who are not wearied with the peru&s;al of the&s;e volumes, will wi&s;h Henry had led them a little further. To tho&s;e kind &s;pirits, I would plead the &s;hortne&s;s of life and the abruptne&s;s with which it often ends. The pau&s;e Henry makes in the MS. is not that of death, but &s;udden illne&s;s, and I took the advantage. One of my motives for publi&s;hing the work unfini&s;hed, is, that the world may &s;peak of me as I am, whil&s;t I have power to hear. The clouds that hang over my fortunes intervene be|tween me and the public. I ince&s;&s;antly &s;truggle to di&s;&s;ipate them, feel tho&s;e &s;truggles vain, and &s;hall drop in the effort&mdash;This con&s;olation I &s;hall, how|ever, bear with me to the verge of life, that to tho&s;e who have guided me by the &s;acred and lambent flame of friend&s;hip, my memory will be dear, and that whil&s;t malice feebly breathes, truth will boldly pronounce,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>I&s;le of St. M*****,
<DATE>18th June, 1685, dated from the Ca&s;tle&mdash;at night.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>TORN from the vi&s;ions hope had been flatter|ing me with, I was plunged into this dreary abode. In the fourth room on my left, I &s;aw, by the glim|mering of a lamp, the Marquis D****. He was reading; dejection had robbed his eyes of their brilliancy, his features were fixed by de&s;pair&mdash;I pau&s;ed&mdash;One of the guards, I thought, looked &s;or|rowfully at the Marquis, who, rai&s;ing his eyes to|wards heaven, exclaimed, "O merciful God! how long mu&s;t I bear this thir&s;t?"&mdash;A &s;igh broke from my bo&s;om, but it availed not my friend, I was con|ducted to my cell, and left, in awful &s;ilence, to gloo|my meditation; yet pity, heavenly pity! had touch|ed the &s;tronge&s;t fibre of my heart, and I forgot, for &s;ome moments, I came here to die. After a night of wearine&s;s, I aro&s;e; the &s;un had not gilded the grates of my pri&s;on, nor had the lark indulged her fir&s;t rapture, when the groan of angui&s;h left the bur|thened heart of &s;ome one near me&mdash;I li&s;tened&mdash; &s;ilence en&s;ued, and after an interval of near ten
<PB N="2" REF="029933_0005_0FE354926EDFCD38">
minutes heard a door unlock&mdash;It was the door of the Marquis.</P>
<P>"Deadly draught! Bitter! Bitter to an extreme!" were his words. I felt agony not to be expre&s;&s;ed, grew wild with horror, and knocked loudly on the in&s;ide of the door of my pri&s;on. It was opened by a &s;oldier, in who&s;e countenance were di&s;cernible the tumultuous traits of unfini&s;hed murder.</P>
<P>"What would you have, &s;ir?&mdash;&s;peak quickly&mdash; the commandant would reprove me did he know I obey unnece&s;&s;ary curio&s;ity&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Surely thou could&s;t not do it; (&s;aid I, looking at him with amazement) if he is not yet dead, per|mit me to &s;ee him."</P>
<P>"Whom would you &s;ee?"</P>
<P>"That gentleman in the fourth room."</P>
<P>"He mu&s;t die, &s;ir. Nine days have elap&s;ed &s;ince the <HI>lettre</HI> of death arrived.&mdash;He mu&s;t drink"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Poi&s;on!" (interrupting him.)</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;ir; the draught of &s;leep&mdash;he will feel little pain."</P>
<P>"How long has he been impri&s;oned here?"</P>
<P>"He was here before I came&mdash;I know not his offence&mdash;we only attend to guard-hours; pri&s;oners mu&s;t not conver&s;e with us, nor dare we make en|quiries; if we did, we could do no good, for our own lives are not worth much here."</P>
<P>"O Heaven! (I exclaimed,) is it po&s;&s;ible tho&s;e who boa&s;t the name of chri&s;tian &s;hould thus revel in cruelty!&mdash;Lead me to the Marquis."</P>
<P><PB REF="029933_0006_0FE35497D36875C8">The &s;oldier &s;eemed irre&s;olute; I &s;lipped a pur&s;e into his hand; he was conquered, and left me near the bed of my friend; &s;lumber, innocent as that of infancy, was gathering on his face, he rai&s;ed his heavy eyes towards mine.</P>
<P>"From whence are you come"&mdash;</P>
<P>"Ah, my dear friend! do you not know me?"</P>
<P>"Is it, can it be my dear Henry?"</P>
<P>"Yes, it is that unfortunate victim of de&s;igning power."</P>
<P>"And come you here to &s;eek a grave?"</P>
<P>"My dear Marquis, kings will be obeyed; how long have you lingered here?"</P>
<P>"You may remember the night when I attemp|ted your re&s;cue: I found you noble, and without the tedious enquiries of who or what you were, di&s;in|tere&s;tedly loved you, our intimacy was of &s;hort con|tinuance, I embarked for France the next morning, nor had I time to tell you my real name and quali|ty&mdash;my breath grows &s;hort&mdash;I long to &s;leep&mdash;take tho&s;e papers, conceal them, do not forget me&mdash;I had a &s;i&s;ter."&mdash;</P>
<P>He became lethargic, as he named his &s;i&s;ter. I attempted at fir&s;t to rou&s;e him. Heavy &s;leep ren|dered him motionle&s;s, and I began to think my effort cruel, when the &s;oldier who had li&s;tened at the entrance of a long and gloomy pa&s;&s;age, return|ed; prudence whi&s;pering the danger of his &s;eeing
<PB N="4" REF="029933_0007_0FE3549B79950EF0">
the papers of my friend, I concealed them in my bo&s;om, and hurried to my apartment.</P>
<P>Wherefore are we virtuous! or why are the vo|taries of virtue not more numerous in the world? my friend, my lamented friend, was one of her &s;in|gular adorers: he lived beloved, he dies neglected! Give me, ju&s;t heaven, the opportunity of avenging his fate, and take me to thy mercy! thus I feebly exclaimed, without reflecting that the doors of li|berty were for ever clo&s;ed on me!</P>
<P>Throwing my&s;elf down, I endeavoured to collect my &s;cattered ideas, and to reconcile my mind to the a&s;&s;emblage of mournful circum&s;tances in which I found my&s;elf &s;uddenly enveloped. Sullen are the rigid precepts of proud philo&s;opy! we practice ap|pearances, we are &s;tubborn in concealing our riche&s;t emotions, we a&s;&s;ume above the vulgar, and we even bear with us to the grave the trea&s;ures of the &s;oul! yet, nature freezes at di&s;&s;olution, man is lea&s;t train|ed in deception when he owns him&s;elf unwilling to undergo the great change&mdash;During the hour of &s;leep, fancy, in broken lineaments, brought the Marquis to my view, yielding to the power of death &mdash;Had not its terrors made &s;ick my yielding &s;pirit?</P>
<P>Awakened by &s;ome voices near me, I opened my eyes on two of the guards and a Cordelier.</P>
<P>"Leave me with your pri&s;oner," &s;aid the latter, "I will confe&s;s him. Should his love of truth throw a light on the combinations of France; I have or|ders for &s;ome little indulgence from the King."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="029933_0008_0FE354A12A754EF8">"<HI>Vive le Roi!</HI>" replied the guards, and re&s;pect|fully retired.</P>
<P>"God be with us, my &s;on," &s;aid the good father.</P>
<P>"Eternally! reverend monk."</P>
<P>"Shrift, &s;hrift!"</P>
<P>"I honour my king, love my country, and never conceal the emotions of my &s;oul from my mi&s;tre&s;s or my friend."</P>
<P>"Know you that you are accu&s;ed of con&s;piring again&s;t monarchy, of a&s;&s;ociating with the enemies of the king, and of concealing memorials which immediately concern the &s;tate?"</P>
<P>"Leave me to my fate!" I cried.</P>
<P>"Ra&s;h and ill advi&s;ed youth! reflect on the value of exi&s;tence, &s;port not wantonly with that power who willed thee into being."</P>
<P>"That power, Holy Father, now whi&s;pers here; <HI>I have given thee the energies of nature, pervert them not!</HI>" in pronouncing the&s;e words, I laid my hand on my heart, and Heaven is my witne&s;s, it beat firmly in uni&s;on; the Cordelier pau&s;ed&mdash;I thought he appeared a little a&s;hamed of his mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"The king will ble&s;s thy youth with luxury. and thy age with honour, &s;o thou but yield his foes to ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>"Bid him bani&s;h his mini&s;ters."</P>
<P>"Irreverend and di&s;loyal!"</P>
<P>"Deceived old man!"</P>
<P>"Thou wilt undergo the torture."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="029933_0009_0FE354A55CDE9830">"I expect it."</P>
<P>"Wilt thou not reveal thy friends?"</P>
<P>"Yes, tear my heart from its hold. Thou wilt find their impre&s;&s;ion there&mdash;away!"</P>
<P>The Cordelier looked full in my face, his eyes met mine, and I fancied a languid &s;mile &s;tealing acro&s;s his features; but as he held his cloak over his mouth, I could not di&s;cern, nor was it of mo|ment to me, by what ideas he was animated.</P>
<P>But I &s;oon blu&s;hed at the recollection of my rough manner, concluded it unworthly his re&s;ign|ed and &s;acred character, and began a more gentle apology when he abruptly withdrew.&mdash;My la&s;t mo|ment &s;eemed now to approach&mdash;I pondered &s;eriou&s;|ly on death, my anxions, my curious &s;oul could pierce no further, I was incapable of wi&s;hing for immortality. Love drew me back to the world, while I vainly &s;truggled to look forward to the grave. Lo&s;t in meditating on life's broken pro&s;pects, I &s;tood, with folded arms, leaning again&s;t the wall, when my door was ha&s;tily unlocked, the guards en|tered, and I prepared to follow them to the place of execution.</P>
<P>"How happy you are!" &s;aid one of them.</P>
<P>"Trifle not with my feelings&mdash;lead on."</P>
<P>"The holy Cordelier has procured you the free|dom of the ca&s;tle, but you mu&s;t not pa&s;s the court gate."</P>
<P>They bowed, and left me a&s;toni&s;hed; here has
<PB N="7" REF="029933_0010_0FE354AAACC983E0">
comfort taken one &s;tep for me, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, who knows but &s;he may take another.</P>
<Q><L>Each moment brings event, and on mankind</L>
<L>Unbo&s;oms her deep &s;tore of bli&s;s or woe.</L>
<L>Year follows year &s;o &s;trongly drawn by fate,</L>
<L>We barely view them ere they hurry on</L>
<L>Beyond our ken of &s;oul.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Recovering, I flew to the door of the Marquis, and li&s;tening, heard him breathe&mdash;Joy revi&s;ited my bo&s;om: love and gratitude aro&s;e for the Cordelier, and hope began bu&s;ily to combine her images with|in my late de&s;olated mind. Hope! thou dear, de|lu&s;ive power! how frequently do&s;t thou charm and deceive, yet how eagerly art thou indulged by poor humanity! I now ranged through the awful pa&s;|&s;ages of this tremendous pri&s;on, my ears were &s;alu|ted by varied &s;ounds, but mo&s;tly by &s;ounds of &s;or|row&mdash;the Marquis &s;till breathed in the mo&s;t pro|found &s;leep.</P>
<P>After having wandered back to my &s;olitary cell, I cautiou&s;ly took one of his un&s;ealed papers from my bo&s;om: it was a letter addre&s;&s;ed to the duke of B****, from my late guardian the count de Mar&s;an, a fragment of which ran thus:</P>
<P>"Your intriguing enemy, le chancellor de Tel|lier, not contented with per&s;ecuting you and the unfortunate Henry, has contrived to render many of the noble&s;&s;e &s;u&s;pected. Three were accordingly arre&s;ted ye&s;terday&mdash;remain where you are." Here were names mentioned which where mo&s;t dear to
<PB N="8" REF="029933_0011_0FE354AF4DF837B8">
me; but when the letter was written, or how it was to reach the duke of B**** I could not learn: ideas of pa&s;t happine&s;s now crowded on my me|mory, my imagination grew fervent, and the bars of my pri&s;on &s;eemed to pre&s;s upon my brain! "O my father! mu&s;t I never &s;ee thee more! Where art thou, my long-loved Emily? Ju&s;t heaven! for what my&s;terious purpo&s;e am I pre&s;erved!"&mdash;The haple&s;s Marquis was not in a &s;tate for interrogation, all was a chaos within me, till burthened with wild and improbable conjectures, I yielded to repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Dawn no &s;ooner appeared, than the di&s;mal clank|ing of chains proclaimed the upri&s;ing of the gloomy inhabitants of the ca&s;tle. I again waited at the door of the Marquis, in hope of hearing him breathe: I heard him not; the hour of the morning was yet but early, and I endeavored to con&s;ole my&s;elf. Not knowing a &s;pot within the&s;e walls that could afford me happine&s;s, I was returning to my wretched apartment, when I met the &s;oldier in the pa&s;&s;age who had ye&s;terday admini&s;tered to the thir&s;t of my friend. He held a cup full of a pale liquor, which &s;eemed to congeal, as he &s;tood, with its own &s;om|niferous properties.</P>
<P>"Does the Marquis live?"</P>
<P>"He lives, and has called for more drink. My painful ta&s;k was ye&s;terday but half fini&s;hed, and in this draught lies &s;leep eternal&mdash;Yet, go to him,
<PB N="9" REF="029933_0012_0FE354B603FAA188">
Mon&s;ieur, per&s;uade him to put off the la&s;t hour by refraining; for when he drinks he dies!"</P>
<P>Forgetful of my &s;ituation, I rudely &s;eized the arm of the &s;oldier, &s;tared him wildly in the face, and &s;aw his eyes &s;wimming in tears&mdash;&s;till I gazed with &s;ilent horror.</P>
<P>Ah, Mon&s;ieur! it is not the unhappy Malnor would de&s;troy the Marquis! Deeply do I violate my feelings as a man; but &s;hould I refu&s;e this exe|crable office, I mu&s;t expire on the rack; nor would my death avail your friend. All here, who are &s;up|po&s;ed to be on the part of the &s;tate, are, from ne|ce&s;&s;ity, executioners. Go, reque&s;t him not to drink &mdash;and yet&mdash;if he &s;hould refu&s;e, the little remnant of his life will be mi&s;erable&mdash;He mu&s;t never drink more."</P>
<P>"'Tis too much," &s;aid I eagerly, and from &s;ud|den impul&s;e da&s;hed the cup on the earth.</P>
<P>"What have you done! my life is gone!"</P>
<P>Brought to de&s;peration, I panted with tumul|tuous and varied emotion.</P>
<P>"Give him water that he may revive&mdash;Fly, my good friend?"</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t give him nothing&mdash;I have nothing to give, each victim is allowed but two draughts of pow&s;t. The commandant deals it out: I can pro|cure no more."</P>
<P>"Say thou <HI>ha&s;t</HI> given it him."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="029933_0013_0FE354B98B2A7D70">"And how will that &s;erve?"</P>
<P>"Say he is dead."</P>
<P>"How bury him?"</P>
<P>I was foiled.&mdash;The poor &s;oldier now appeared as one condemned by me: yet I &s;ecretly exulted in the effort of &s;aving my beloved friend. After looking for &s;ome moments at each other, I recollected my|&s;elf &s;o far as to de&s;ire him to be &s;ecret; again gave him gold, and he left me with a &s;igh that indicated more re&s;ignation than remor&s;e. In&s;tead of going to the Marquis, I &s;taggered to my cell. Terror, amaze|ment, and pity con&s;pired to rai&s;e an anarchy in my bo&s;om&mdash;Where, at &s;uch a moment could my &s;pirit find re&s;ource? I kneeled and implored the Ruler of the world. Lo&s;t in fervor, I was found by the generous Cordelier.</P>
<P>"May the Creator hear thee! was his &s;aluta|tion.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e and acco&s;ted him with the pure&s;t affec|tion; his venerable beard concealed half his face, his cowl ob&s;cured his eyes, yet I heard his language with delight.</P>
<P>"O, my father! &s;ave my friend. He who re&s;cu|ed me from death lies in yonder cell, doomed, in a few hours, to tremble in its la&s;t agonies!&mdash;Where &s;hall I lo&s;e my memory, Cordelier? exi&s;tence is becoming a burthen!"</P>
<P>My wild ravings &s;hocked the Cordelier. He re|proved me gently, led my imagination through the
<PB N="11" REF="029933_0014_0FE354BF7919B8B8">
univer&s;e, and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately proved that nature being eternally at work, &s;he mu&s;t de&s;troy equally as &s;he renews; adding, "I know not thy friend&mdash; whoever he is, wilt thou for his &s;ake give up the &s;ecret reformers of the nation?"</P>
<P>"No. I know no reformer; the few friends I have are noble."</P>
<P>"Then he mu&s;t die."</P>
<P>"Die! unfeeling wretch! how dare&s;t thou, how dare thy king &s;port &s;o ea&s;ily with the life of man? Is this thy piety?"</P>
<P>"Be calm, my &s;on; ungoverned pa&s;&s;ion makes virtue unamiable, and if thy &s;tubbornne&s;s is to <HI>thee</HI> a virtue, pre&s;erve it in the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of thy &s;oul, but &s;uffer it not to dwindle into childi&s;h im|patience, which can never profit mankind nor thee."</P>
<P>Strange force of de&s;erved reproof! I blu&s;hed, my confu&s;ion owned the Cordelier ju&s;t, veneration re&s;umed its place, and I mournfully expo&s;tulated, "Ah, my father! to &s;uffer my di&s;traction, you mu&s;t be acquainted with the mind of the dying Marquis D****."</P>
<P>"The Marquis D****!" &s;aid you? "where? O! where is he?"</P>
<P>"In the fourth cell on the left."</P>
<P>"Art thou in this dreadful habitation!"</P>
<P>Perceiving he was fainting, I caught him in my arms.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="029933_0015_0FE354C41E435850">"O my brother!" &s;aid he, with a heavy &s;igh, as I placed him on a low bench, "is it po&s;&s;ible after the troubles we have known I mu&s;t meet thee here!"</P>
<P>I ha&s;tily informed him of the &s;tate of his bro|ther. And found him equally a &s;tranger with my|&s;elf to the cau&s;e of his impri&s;onment. In few words, the Cordelier informed me, that had I been more flexible to his political &s;olicitations, I &s;hould have been an object of his contempt.</P>
<P>"I officiate here in heavenly purpo&s;es, confe&s;s|ing tho&s;e who are to die: in &s;ome future hour you will know me better&mdash;lead me to my brother!" I conducted him forward; to the guards he announ|ced the holy power of the church&mdash;they withdrew &mdash;and we found the Marquis in a heavy &s;leep. The Cordelier fell on his neck, the big tears dropped on the face of the unre&s;i&s;ting &s;leeper, who once rai&s;ed his eyes, met tho&s;e of his brother and fell back from the fraternal embrace. Lethargy hung on his &s;en|&s;es: we could not rouze him, he looked around, rolling his eyes with a vacant glare. It was now the hour when the commandant of the ca&s;tle came to vi&s;it the victims who were &s;oon to die: He ap|proached, attended by the dejected Malnor.</P>
<P>Finely &s;haped, ea&s;y of deportment, and carele&s;s|ly polite, di&s;playing a gold &s;nuff-box in his hand, he directed his enquiries to Malnor.</P>
<P>"The gentleman is not quite gone, you &s;ay,
<PB N="13" REF="029933_0016_0FE354C9AD103588">
Malnor?&mdash;Corderlier, I &s;uppo&s;e you have prepared him?"</P>
<P>"His hands are cold&mdash;but his temples are yet warm."</P>
<P>"Well; let him lie undi&s;turbed."</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of this &s;peech, the fellow took &s;nuff with as much ea&s;e as he would have per|formed the &s;ame action at an opera; I &s;tood &s;ilent|ly enraged. Happily the Cordelier's face was con|cealed, as he was kneeling at the &s;ide of the bed, holding his forehead with both hands, while his tears and &s;ighs were mi&s;taken by the gay comman|dant for devotion. Sanguinary power! by what infernal appellation art thou adorned who can&s;t inure the heart to cruelty! Habit had frozen the feelings of this wretch; who after congratulating Malnor, on the little alteration produced by the draught in the placid countenance of the Marquis, gave orders for his interment at the midnight &s;ucceeding his departure, in the private burial ground.</P>
<P>Malnor, who was con&s;cious of having but half compleated the work of death, trembled at the order, bowed, but made no reply to the obdurate &s;uperior; who by chance looked at me, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf happy on &s;eeing me at the ca&s;tle, and retir|ed (&s;inging an air of Voitures,) to vi&s;it other vic|tims who were under condemnation.</P>

<P>Without heeding me, the Cordelier gazed with agony on the Marquis, then turning to Malnor, feebly articulated,</P>
<P>"Ha&s;t thou a brother?"</P>
<P>The abrupt que&s;tion di&s;compo&s;ed Malnor&mdash; &s;ympathy &s;hone in the tear he endeavored to hide.</P>
<P>"I have a &s;i&s;ter and an aged father," replied, he, "who bewail my lo&s;s, while I am confined here under an accu&s;ation of which I am guiltle&s;s; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he governor has thought proper to prolong my life, for the purpo&s;e of admini&s;tering the fatal po|tion to tho&s;e who are the victims of the &s;tate."</P>
<P>"Wilt thou be my friend?" cried the Corde|lier&mdash;"Art thou po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any means that will revive my brother?"</P>
<P>"To what purpo&s;e would you re&s;tore him," &s;aid Malnor, "heard you not the order of the Superior? Momentary re&s;toration would but in|crea&s;e the pangs of &s;truggling nature."</P>
<P>"Save him but for this night! to-morrow may be the &s;ea&s;on of mercy! I will ha&s;ten to the chan|cellor le Tellier, who is with his &s;on Louvois, on the i&s;land, throw my&s;elf at his feet, and whatever be the crime of the Marquis, the chancellor will &s;urely grant him life, on condition that he &s;e|clude him&s;elf from the world for ever."</P>
<P>The Cordelier waited no reply, but left us ha&s;tily.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="029933_0018_0FE354D3D5371760">Malnor informed me, that the phy&s;ician of the ca&s;tle could furni&s;h antidotes who&s;e &s;trong pow|er would expel the fumes of the chilling poi&s;on; "not," continued he, "that your friend can im|mediately recover, but the weight will gradually de&s;cend from the oppre&s;&s;ed brain, as the &s;tomach feels relief."</P>
<P>"Fly to the phy&s;ician, my good Malnor, buy his &s;ilence with this gold, and let us force this vic|tim to ta&s;te the cordial of life!"</P>
<P>"I go," &s;aid Malnor, "but remember, if the Cordelier brings not his pardon, your friend&s;hip will be cruelty; man, naturally wi&s;hes to die with|out pain: when can the Marquis die with le&s;s?"</P>
<P>Rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy &s;trengthened the max|ims of Malnor; yet, I bad him be &s;wift and leave the event to Heaven. Thirty hours had the Mar|quis lain in a death-like &s;tupor.&mdash;The &s;oldier ha&s;t|ened to find the phy&s;ician, and I waited, with pain|ful anxiety, the Cordelier's return. Too &s;oon he ar|rived, with di&s;traction in his countenance.</P>
<P>"Ah, my friend! I have been received with in&s;olence, the Marquis is pronounced a traitor, and all the indulgence I can obtain is to inter him with his ance&s;tors, in the chapel of St.*****. I kneeled, implored and exhorted the chancellor le Tellier, to beware of de&s;troying the noble &s;ubjects of France; I did not confe&s;s the unfortunate Mar|quis was my brother, &s;ince the lo&s;s of my liberty

But for you, my dear friend, I have brought a habit exactly like my own: Put it on, conceal your face in the cowl, and follow the body of my brother through tho&s;e fatal doors. The decep|tion will not be known. I can loiter in the cell, under pretence of devotion with the pri&s;oners, till the guards are changed, and then pa&s;s unno|ticed."</P>
<P>Malnor returned at this moment, but no phy|&s;ician.</P>
<P>"No, my good Cordelier," &s;aid I, "that brave &s;oldier &s;tands in danger of the rack: give <HI>him</HI> the habit, he may pa&s;s for a Cordelier in following the Marquis, and my anxious &s;oul will &s;tand acquit|ted of his fate."</P>

<P>But the intreaties of the Cordelier were una|vailing: I only reque&s;ted him to conceal him&s;elf in my cell, that two Cordeliers might not at once be &s;een near the Marquis; he obeyed, and Mal|nor ventured the awful cri&s;is; we could now di&s;|cern no pul&s;e, life &s;eemed to have retreated from the object of our cares, while we were contriving to &s;ecure it. Our tears, the la&s;t tribute of affec|tion, fell on his &s;en&s;ele&s;s bo&s;om, and he was con|veyed through the ea&s;tern ai&s;le to the carriage that waited for the &s;olemn purpo&s;e, while Malnor fol|lowed with the certificate of interment in his hand; and fortunately pa&s;&s;ed the guards unque&s;|tioned.</P>
<P>The fear, the danger of Malnor's departure, threw the Cordelier and my&s;elf into &s;ilent &s;tupi|dity, we were nearly breathle&s;s with apprehen|&s;ion&mdash;while every &s;tep, every little noi&s;e, &s;ounded like thunder to our affrighted &s;en&s;es, the Cordelier &s;at him&s;elf down on my little bed, and found &s;ome relief for his troubled heart in a &s;tood of tears; I attempted not to comfort him, a re&s;pectful &s;ilence better &s;uited his exce&s;s of affliction.&mdash;The com|mandant's bell rang, the Cordelier was rouzed to a thought of &s;afety. He embraced, and left me to fulfil his duty with tho&s;e in the di&s;tant parts of the

ca&s;tle, who were penitent from terror, and wi&s;hed for his con&s;olation.</P>
<P>I had been five years a mi&s;erable wanderer in barbarous climes. Dragged from my friends, my father and the woman I adored; on my return could gain no information of tho&s;e beloved objects, and while &s;eeking them in every part of France, was arre&s;ted and thrown into this pri&s;on on the eighteenth of June, as I have above recorded. Though I had known &s;o little of the Cordelier, and of his brother the Marquis, I felt a faint hope, from the letter I had already &s;een, that &s;ome in|formation might at a future period be gained from the former.</P>
<P>Eternal Creator! be thou the guardian of Emily! Whi&s;per the danger of erring youth! ble&s;s her vi|&s;ions with cha&s;te delight, and breathe thy won|drous influence on her &s;oul, gently as air wafts the dew of the morning!</P>
<P>Hourly &s;truggling to forget that charming creature, I &s;ank wearied with each day, and aro&s;e with the dawn to love and de&s;pair. Carried into the intellectual fields of the pa&s;t by the power of memory, I &s;at on my little &s;tone window &s;eat till the clock at midnight &s;truck one&mdash;one, and no more!&mdash;what a warning does it leave on the mind!&mdash;my meditations were broken, I prepared for repo&s;e, when I &s;aw a paper lying on the floor, I eagerly carried my eye to the &s;ub&s;cription, with|out

endearments with which &s;he once &s;oothed me, till tran&s;port threw affliction from my bo&s;om?&mdash; All is this vile Cordelier's&mdash;The dreadful work of &s;educing her once-&s;potle&s;s mind was re&s;erved for him, while I, through every vici&s;&s;itude, have been vainly nur&s;ing her image, till it is become incorporated with my being&mdash;Lovely, faithle&s;s maid! how bitter ha&s;t thou made my remaining hours!</P>
<P>I lamented the di&s;covery&mdash;railed at the Corde|lier, re&s;olved to hate Emily, or, which was more congenial to the violence that raged within me, re&s;olved to make her mine at the expence of my honor; &s;hould chance ever afford me the revenge|ful opportunity. What fanta&s;tic ideas were the&s;e for a man in my &s;ituation! Yet, &s;o does the hu|man mind often amu&s;e it&s;elf with trifles, while labouring under great calamity; I ought to have delivered the papers belonging to the Marquis to his brother. It had been driven from my memory by the di&s;mal events which had filled the preced|ing day. Little regret was now occa&s;ioned by this reflection. The friend&s;hip of the Cordelier no longer gave me plea&s;ure. Love was bani&s;hed from my &s;oul, and vice &s;eized the heart that had en|throned an angel!&mdash;I &s;ickened with ingratitude, I grew impure:&mdash;Wonderful is the mechani&s;m of nature, un&s;earchable the human mind. Love that gives birth to every virtue, to delicacy, &s;entiment,

and the namele&s;s graces that gild the world, left me a prey to the poi&s;oned pa&s;&s;ions of evil, el&s;e how could I hate the Cordelier only becau&s;e he was beloved by Emily?</P>
<P>Morning aro&s;e more joyle&s;s than I had ever known it, and a confu&s;ion of voices poured thro' the pa&s;&s;age&mdash;I &s;at in my cell &s;ullenly daring the wor&s;t, when I heard the name of Malnor ha&s;tily pronounced&mdash;Doors, which I had not heard &s;ound &s;ince my confinement, were now thrown open, and I found, by the increa&s;ing din, that the guards were advancing towards the cell of the departed Marquis. The Governor's voice grew di&s;tinct; he mentioned me, and I fancied my&s;elf a devoted victim to the e&s;cape of Malnor. While I feigned a repo&s;e, my &s;en&s;es could not ta&s;te, the Governor found me reclined on the bed of wretchedne&s;s, ordered the guards to retire and acco&s;ted me po|litely,&mdash;</P>
<P>"Sir, can you command me in any thing that will oblige you?"</P>
<P>"Sir, I have a lively &s;en&s;e of the honor you do me, and thank you mo&s;t &s;incerely," replied I, with a troubled look&mdash;He gazed attentively in my face &mdash;I felt as if Malnor could be &s;een through my eyes, and blu&s;hed at a deception &s;o laudable in it|&s;elf. Had the Governor &s;eized this moment of feel|ing, and boldly dared me with the que&s;tion, I &s;hould firmly have confe&s;&s;ed a conduct which gave me &s;e|cret
<PB N="22" REF="029933_0025_0FE354F5612B8420">
plea&s;ure; but happily that moment pa&s;&s;ed on, and the blu&s;h left my cheek as my emotions &s;ub|&s;ided.</P>
<P>"You are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, Sir, &s;aid the Governor; I am equally &s;o, but for very different rea&s;ons. You will be treated with lenity; I have orders for its being &s;o. The cau&s;e of your confinement is per|haps unknown to you, for the intrigues of the cabinet are inexplicable, and it may afford you but little con&s;olation to know your impri&s;onment will la&s;t <HI>for ever!</HI>"</P>
<P>I &s;huddered at the word.</P>
<P>"I know mankind, am acquainted, well ac|quainted with the pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ince you may de&s;pair of ever returning to the world, I will, from that very de&s;pair, hope for the honour of your confidence; in return, I offer you mine."</P>
<P>What floods of thought came pouring on my &s;oul at this declaration! I could form nothing clear&mdash;All my powers were enveloped by a gloom, through which I could not di&s;cern one ray of hope; enclo&s;ed <HI>for ever!</HI> cut off &s;o &s;uddenly from &s;ocie|ty, and no object to pur&s;ue, who&s;e excellence could lead me progre&s;&s;ively from the black temp|tations forming around! The Governor hoped much from my de&s;pair; he did &s;uppo&s;e I had al|ready prepared my&s;elf for villainy, and that the bani&s;hed Emily had drawn after her my whole train of virtues. His propo&s;al came well-timed&mdash; It was &s;ea&s;onably abrupt, couched in language
<PB N="23" REF="029933_0026_0FE354FAF47D83E8">
frank and ea&s;y, and I exchanged my faith with him, a faith that had no principle for its ba&s;is, a friend&s;hip uncemented by truth. The Governor bargained only with my de&s;pair.</P>
<P>After &s;ome little pau&s;e, he mentioned the e&s;cape of Malnor, adding, "the &s;oldier was poor, I made him u&s;eful from his nece&s;&s;ity, he was by nature too humane for my purpo&s;es, and if I only could be informed how he left the ca&s;tle, I &s;hould not much regret his lo&s;s."</P>
<P>"What was his crime, &s;ir?" &s;aid I with pertur|bation; "Of no magnitude&mdash;Almo&s;t nothing. He was only met conducting a royal fugitive through the woods, who&s;e name and quality we believe him to be a &s;tranger to, but fearing he &s;hould have di&s;cerned too much, we kept him a pri&s;oner."</P>
<P>"Did he never own him&s;elf acquainted with his employer? or did you never put him to the que&s;tion?"</P>
<P>"We &s;trained him a little, but his hone&s;t &s;im|plicity convinced us he was ignorant of &s;aving a man who&s;e exi&s;tence at this moment cau&s;es in|quietude in the bo&s;om of our king&mdash;I &s;hall u&s;e every means to detect him, though he de&s;erves a better fate."</P>
<P>Politely wi&s;hing me a good morning, the Go|vernor withdrew, and left me to the motifying thought, that, Malnor alone could have informed me of my father; and, as if Providence meant
<PB N="24" REF="029933_0027_0FE3550088225620">
to &s;port with me, I had been the in&s;trument of his e&s;cape&mdash;My father! my injured father!&mdash;But what have I to do with tender ideas! Why &s;hould I indulge the &s;oft affections? There exi&s;ts not an object in the univer&s;e who will own it&s;elf in &s;ym|pathy with me. No! I am forgot, de&s;pi&s;ed, re|jected, I have been indulging only the vi&s;ion of love. I have cheri&s;hed only an image while ano|ther po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ub&s;tance. I have cheated my|&s;elf; my force of &s;oul is gone! and I am too en|ervated ever to look up the rugged heights of virtue.</P>
<P>Thus I raved awhile, and to tho&s;e joyle&s;s mur|murs &s;ucceeded confu&s;ed plans of vengeance. "<HI>La&s;t night at the garden gate</HI>" did Emily wait, and not wait, for <HI>me!</HI> Where is the garden gate? Ha&s;tily opening the letter a &s;econd time, I read it over with care, but the &s;ilent me&s;&s;enger had gain|ed no new intelligence. The date was prior to my confinement; and how the letter came into my apartment was with me an undetermined point. It was probable the Cordelier had un|knowingly dropped it; but how could Emily form an a&s;&s;ignation? Why did &s;he not &s;till love me? What had I done? I was only become unfortu|nate!&mdash;Yes&mdash;Heaven cho&s;e to render me unhap|py. Emily cho&s;e the Cordelier &s;hould make her faithle&s;s&mdash;Woman! Woman! why wert thou created! In the great journey of life, man fre|quently pa&s;&s;es by the bli&s;s he had long pur&s;ued;

either he is in&s;en&s;ible to its near approach, or, from &s;ome fatal timidity fears to &s;eize it. There was a time I could have been as favored as this Cordelier, but that hour is gone&mdash;Here am I to remain for ever! The&s;e meditations availed me not, apathy was the &s;ole comfort that offered.</P>
<P>From this period I was treated with re&s;pect by the guards, and with indulgence by the Governor; the latter, in confidence, conducted me into &s;eve|ral apartments of the ca&s;tle, hitherto concealed. Many noble and maje&s;tic forms, who &s;eemed dig|nified by woe, appeared to my view; among others, a ma&s;culine figure caught my attention, his features and his attitude, as I looked at him, &s;uffered no change, all were uniformly re&s;olved.</P>
<Q><L>Mild re&s;ignation, (wi&s;er than de&s;pair,)</L>
<L>Subdu'd the &s;igh, and check'd the fruitle&s;s tear.</L>
<L>Vengeance no longer could his bo&s;om warm,</L>
<L>His pa&s;&s;ions withered in his dauntle&s;s form.</L>
<L>Hope left his heart, yet patience met the rod,</L>
<L>And prov'd the man a particle of God.</L></Q>
<P>We fixed our eyes on each other; our &s;ilence was intere&s;ting to the heart: bowing with that mournful reverence, which is ever due to digni|fied mi&s;ery, I reluctantly followed the Governor. Some apartments, which were &s;ituated on the &s;outh &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, I perceived he did not in|cline I &s;hould enter. Naturally, I wi&s;hed to enter them, &s;o prevalent is the mind to hunger after what it is denied; but, for this time, I was oblig|ed to forego my curio&s;ity, and to be &s;atisfied with
<PB N="26" REF="029933_0029_0FE355087030AB80">
what the Governor cho&s;e to afford. I quietly fol|lowed him, and he led me through a &s;ubterrane|ous pa&s;&s;age, arched, and glittering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, full of unwhole&s;ome droppings. The time was noon, yet &s;o horribly dark was this pa&s;&s;age, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a lamp was kept burning, and feeble was the lu&s;tre it gave.</P>
<P>We &s;topped at the end of this long vault, and my conductor made me ob&s;erve a &s;mall door &s;o finely contrived, and &s;o &s;hadowed by the arti&s;t, that it wore the re&s;emblance of Gothic &s;tone, and appeared but as an entire part of this antient &s;truc|ture. I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed it unperceived, had not the Governor flipped back a private &s;pring, and opened it to awaken my curio&s;ity. We de&s;cended by a flight of &s;teps. The air that met us was cold, damp, and of that &s;ickly kind which bur&s;ts from a newly opened tomb. I began to think the Gover|nor had a de&s;ign upon my life, and re&s;olved, if &s;o, he &s;hould buy it; my &s;urmi&s;e was unju&s;t. Find|ing we had at length reached the floor, and di&s;|cerning no glimp&s;e of day, I enquired in what part of the ca&s;tle we were, and for what purpo&s;e this horrid dungeon was de&s;igned. The Governor in|formed me it was an apartment &s;eldom occupied, and never but by tho&s;e who were under the nece&s;|&s;ity of taking an abrupt leave. While he was &s;peaking, I fancied there was a ru&s;tling noi&s;e be|hind me, I &s;tarted, the Governor &s;miled, a&s;ked me if I was afraid of rats; at the &s;ame moment, re|moving
<PB N="27" REF="029933_0030_0FE3550E707FC968">
&s;ome ma&s;&s;y bars, he threw back the &s;hutter of a little window, or rather hole, which opened on the ocean. It was &s;trongly grated with iron; the &s;pace from the &s;ea, which was not above two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oi&s;es, was formed of &s;olid rock, which &s;erved as a bulwark to the foundations of the ca&s;tle, and again&s;t who&s;e foot the billows continually wa&s;ted their force. Hence could no human voice a&s;cend to &s;ociety: the lamentations of death were but whi&s;pers here, and here might famine perform, unmole&s;ted, her &s;low and awful work.&mdash;When a brave man falls in battle, the glory of his deeds &s;hine through his di&s;a&s;trous fate, and his friends feel a con&s;olation in the retro&s;pect of his conduct&mdash; But <HI>here</HI> oblivion fed in all her native darkne&s;s, and quietly prolonged the horrors of her victim.</P>
<P>Trembling with terror, I ha&s;tened towards the &s;tone &s;tairs by which we had de&s;cended, and left the Governor to replace the window-&s;hutter by him&s;elf, as he be&s;t under&s;tood the work. In hur|rying up the &s;tairs, I &s;aw a &s;mall wire lying in the du&s;t, I caught it up undi&s;covered by the Governor &mdash;it drew a miniature after it, which was ru&s;ted and disfigured, and which, caution, at this mo|ment, not &s;uffering me to look at, I eagerly thru&s;t into my pocket.</P>
<P>The Governor having made the window &s;ecure, I waited for him to lead me through further di&s;|coveries. As I &s;tood on the la&s;t &s;tair, a deep groan I was certain, &s;tole upon my ear; I again de&s;cend|ed
<PB N="28" REF="029933_0031_0FE355126BC53728">
in ha&s;te, fearing the Governor might have hurt him&s;elf with the bar. I met him coming up quite unconcerned, and when I mentioned the circum|&s;tance, was told, with the utmo&s;t <HI>&s;ang froid,</HI> that groans would become more familiar to me as I became a more con&s;tant and peaceful inhabitant of the ca&s;tle. Death is invi&s;ible in his labors, &s;aid I to my&s;elf; &s;ilence may benefit, complainings will not avail me.</P>
<P>"I can lounge no longer with you now," &s;aid the Governor. "Do me the favor of dining with me. If your ta&s;te for plea&s;ure is adapted to mine, you may be happy; if not, you may, with little exertion, create mi&s;ery for your&s;elf.

<P>Thou art a ma&s;ter of the pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;prings of the heart are thine, and knowledge, I fear, hath been bought by thee at an ine&s;timable price!</P>
<P>Reflecting thus, I followed my conductor, who &s;cated me at a &s;plendid table, where luxurious viands and exhilerating wines con&s;pired, for the hour, to chace &s;orrow from the &s;oul. Ea&s;e and charming conviviality &s;at on the brow of the Go|vernor&mdash;At that moment, &s;urrounded by fainting wretches who had no cau&s;e to waft his name to the gates of heaven, he talked of men and things. Ob&s;erving he was in a communicative mood, I re&s;pectfully reque&s;ted him to give me his hi&s;tory &mdash;Smiling, with the utmo&s;t good humour, he re|plied,</P>
<P>"You lay early exactions on my friend&s;hip, but you will find in Dormoud a mind that &s;hrinks from nothing: a mi&s;er creeps cautiou&s;ly through the circles of mankind, ob&s;erves the variety of ac|tion performed by individuals, &s;eeks only one gratification, dallies only with tho&s;e from whom he may cull the golden harve&s;t; and returns laden to his dark chamber, where he gives a loo&s;e to tho&s;e tran&s;ports his trea&s;ure excites; the rapture his own; the heap his univer&s;e&mdash;I am that mi&s;er."</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="029933_0033_0FE3551BD108FE10">"'Tis impo&s;&s;ible!" &s;aid I, while my eyes roved o'er the &s;plendor and magnificence of ta&s;te with which we were &s;urrounded.</P>
<P>"I am that mi&s;er," continued he. "I have de|ceived and laughed at the world from which I have accumulated every hour. My nerve of intel|lect is &s;trong. I have u&s;ed it to one &s;ole purpo&s;e."</P>
<P>"And to what purpo&s;e?"</P>
<P>"Plea&s;ure&mdash;I am a cormorant in plea&s;ure. I know no enjoyment in gold further than it has been exchanged for happy purpo&s;es. Truth, prin|ciple, virtue, all tho&s;e &s;ounds, of which the &s;elf|denying appear to be &s;o fond, I con&s;ider as re|&s;traints for which we need not de&s;ign our&s;elves&mdash; To give happine&s;s to our fellow creatures is all we ought to live for. I, therefore, lulled the artle&s;s, humoured the weak, &s;oothed the langui&s;hment of lovely woman, and thought my&s;elf ju&s;tified; with the&s;e feelings, Mon&s;ieur, I own I might have been ble&s;t, but the ambition of general conque&s;t too &s;oon mingled it&s;elf with my pa&s;&s;ions, and the mo|ment I rai&s;ed my eyes from the humble valley of delight towards its dangerous &s;ummit, I became more and more re&s;tle&s;s through every gradation, and &s;uch mu&s;t be the effect with all who early pur&s;ue plea&s;ure. Too often I found exalted &s;ouls on which I could not act; beings who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a power repul&s;ive to all my machinations; happy in them&s;elves, I could not draw them from re|&s;erve; they noticed me not, or heard me only
<PB N="31" REF="029933_0034_0FE35521A1987E90">
with indications of contempt. Hating the mind that had power thus to rai&s;e it&s;elf above me, I &s;corned to adore it; con&s;equently you may con|ceive me &s;eeking plea&s;ure from weaker objects. My pa&s;&s;ions were high, my form not di&s;agreeable, my education had been fa&s;hionable, I was metho|di&s;ed into addre&s;s, and every rule deemed polite was mine. With the&s;e advantages, I approached the court; here formed by nature for voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s, I expanded my views: I looked on Louis as my equal in the field of gallantry. I ob&s;erved the pageantry of the great, and pronounced it the gilding of hearts like my own. Profu&s;ion, humility with man, and attention to woman, &s;oon procured me acce&s;s to the circles of the highe&s;t fa&s;hion, and Lari&s;&s;a, the charming Lari&s;&s;a, ranked me in the &s;uite of her admirers.</P>
<P>"Hid in elegant gardens, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from court, this beloved favourite of Louis was, on account of the factions gathering over France, too frequently neglected by the Monarch, yet her power was great, her fa&s;cination irre&s;i&s;tible; at lea&s;t I felt it &s;o, and with my u&s;ual beneficence of temper, re&s;olved to alleviate the tender dejec|tion Lari&s;&s;a might feel in the ab&s;ence of the king. Gold &s;he could not be in want of, and &s;trange as my purpo&s;e may &s;eem, I wi&s;hed to gain her through the more gentle avenues of &s;en|timent. This prelude I &s;oon found unnece&s;&s;ary;
<PB N="32" REF="029933_0035_0FE35525A406E680">
Lari&s;&s;a had long for&s;aken, or had never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the angelic delicacy which &s;ecures the mind of man. I rivalled Louis, and was a &s;hort time en|raptured with Lari&s;&s;a.</P>
<P>"The duke of B**** taking me one day a&s;ide, told me I had long engaged his notice.</P>
<P>"I have but one recommendation, my Lord duke," bowing as I recommended my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"What is that Mon&s;ieur Dormoud?"</P>
<P>"Affection for the duke of B****, I will lure his mi&s;tre&s;s to his arms, or kill his enemy, I wear a &s;mile and I wear a &s;word."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Agreed, I will employ you, in return com|mand my intere&s;t with the king."</P>
<P>"On further intimacy, I found the duke had indulged him&s;elf more in the &s;ocial virtues (I mu&s;t u&s;e that word) than in capacious plea&s;ure; he was tender, humane, un&s;u&s;pecting, full of courage and as full of pity. Such a character the world deems amiable, for me it contained materi|als on which I re&s;olved to erect my fabric of ambi|tion. We made long excur&s;ion over the country, and I was walking one day with him near Rochelle, in the fore&s;t of ****, a &s;igh &s;tole from his heart, and he addre&s;&s;ed me in a melancholy tone."</P>
<P>"Mon&s;ieur Dormoud, in the friend&s;hip I have for you, is lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of inequality. I would repo&s;e my cares in your bo&s;om: &s;ated with &s;plen|dor, fatigued with &s;tate, and di&s;turbed by the

<P>"Ah, my friend!

<P>"She he&s;itated as if endeavouring to rouze the powers of memory; I related the &s;ituation in which I found her; relieving her apprehen&s;ion by mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances of honour&mdash;How lovely is woman when unartful! my friends were near, the hounds awakened echo from the hills to pro|claim their approach. I felt for the reputation of the lady; my friends were men of fa&s;hion and gal|lantry, who never took lei&s;ure to reflect, or draw from the blended &s;nare of pa&s;&s;ion and habit that &s;ublime veneration claimed by the un&s;ullied mind. The delicacy of the gentle maid took the alarm; her hor&s;e had not appeared, nor could I quit her to &s;eek him; ha&s;tily ca&s;ting her eyes over the plain, as if wi&s;hing &s;ome other protector, &s;he incoherently a|pologi&s;ed&mdash;and, half breathle&s;s, concluded, "Yon|der, Sir, is a hou&s;e, belonging to my father's ver|derer.

<P>"Unwilling to reveal my rank, I &s;truggled with my emotions; caught her look of gratitude, hung on her voice as &s;he bade me farewell, and &s;etting

<P>"You have power," &s;aid I, "and power alone is &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h every wi&s;h in France."</P>
<P>"The heart mu&s;t be &s;oothed, Dormoud. Love di&s;dains the fetters of power: I would not rudely &s;eize the ble&s;&s;ing, which is only valuable when mutually exchanged."</P>
<P>"I laughed at his &s;cruples, and re&s;olved to be|hold the beauty, of which the duke gave me &s;o in|flaming a picture.&mdash;He re&s;umed.</P>
<P>"Can you procure me, or advi&s;e me how to gain an interview with my fair conqueror?"</P>
<P>"I will think of it, my lord, but am this even|ing engaged."</P>
<P>"With your politic mi&s;tre&s;s, Lari&s;&s;a, I &s;uppo&s;e &mdash;beware Dormoud!&mdash;Should our jealous mo|narch &s;urpri&s;e you, you will never plea&s;e a king's favorite more; and, if proving to you, the ingra|titude, coar&s;ene&s;s, and in&s;en&s;ibility of Lari&s;&s;a, will timely &s;ecure you from &s;o dangerous an amour, I will di&s;play tho&s;e defects in that enchantre&s;s."</P>
<P>"My pride was wounded; to &s;hare her affec|tions with a king, was &s;ecretly my glory; to find her univer&s;al in her objects humbled me.</P>

<P>"Did you obey this &s;ummons, my lord?"</P>
<P>"Call it an invitation," &s;aid the duke, &s;miling at the abruptne&s;s of my que&s;tion, "I perceive you do not wi&s;h for an affirmative; but would Dormoud have refu&s;ed," continued he, with an air of triumph.</P>
<P>"Hate, jealou&s;y, and revenge began to kindle within me; the duke diverted him&s;elf at my ex|pence, rallied, laughed, trifled with my &s;ullenne&s;s, and with the utmo&s;t indifference went on;
<Q><L>Fair without virtue, without peace &s;he's great,</L>

<L>She charms alike the monarch and the fool.</L></Q></P>
<P>"Imagining my&s;elf pointed at, I burned with rage, yet was obliged to be &s;ilent. I had entangled the duke in the web of confidence, but dared not oppo&s;e him; Lari&s;&s;a had en&s;nared the king, while &s;he was rai&s;ing me to a &s;ummit, from which I could look down on powerle&s;s virtue, and often was the

hone&s;t pride of worth in&s;ulted by my contempt. But the duke was yet my &s;uperior&mdash;Politely wi&s;h|ing me a fair evening, he left me. I &s;tole to Lari&s;&s;a. Reclined in her farthe&s;t apartment, adorned but with the loveline&s;s of a di&s;habille, &s;he aro&s;e and welcomed me after the manner of France. All was &s;till, &s;ave &s;oft mu&s;ic in an antichamber, the &s;ounds of which were calculated to melt the &s;oul to the late&s;t ebb of langui&s;hment; and thus di&s;&s;olved with unattended beauty, who could &s;oar beyond the &s;cene? Yet, my a&s;&s;urances and proofs of fidelity and love appeared inadequate to Lari&s;&s;a's affec|tion. I patiently heard her gentle reprovings, felt them ju&s;t, but endeavored to remind her, that mu|tual happine&s;s could only be born of mutual faith, that love alone was the &s;ource of con&s;tancy, and that various pa&s;&s;ions ran round the heart of man in &s;uch regular rotation, that he could not either love or hate, longer than the influence of the then reigning pa&s;&s;ion was dealt to him. Whether the opinion of Lari&s;&s;a varied from my theory; or, whether &s;he wi&s;ely judged that love is not eternal, and that mutual faith dies away, we know not how&mdash;I was at a lo&s;s to determine. I was only cer|tain, that as I &s;at li&s;tening to her chidings, the &s;ound of the mu&s;ic &s;eemed to labour into har&s;hne&s;s and di&s;cordance, not did Lari&s;&s;a her&s;elf appear &s;o attractive as I thought &s;he might, if dre&s;&s;ed by the cooler hand of prudence.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="029933_0041_0FE355412A078968">"Ah, Lari&s;&s;a!" &s;aid I, "with an involuntary peevi&s;hne&s;s, if lovely woman would pre&s;erve her empire, &s;he mu&s;t be virtuous!"</P>
<P>"What malicious daemon could put &s;uch an aukward &s;entence into my mouth at &s;uch a mo|ment? Lari&s;&s;a was fired, &s;he upbraided me with obligations; de&s;pi&s;ed my mercenary pa&s;&s;ion, hated, &s;miled, wept, again &s;oothed me by her &s;oftne&s;s, and was convinced I was her &s;lave."</P>
<P>In &s;pite of my cares I could not help &s;miling at Dormoud's plea&s;antry. He continued&mdash;</P>
<P>"Aye, aye, Mon&s;ieur, we may boa&s;t &s;uprema|ey, rely on our &s;trength, and endeavor to le&s;&s;en woman, but we are her dupes, why?&mdash;becau&s;e her powers are light, delicate, and exqui&s;itely wrought; ours &s;low, obtu&s;e, &s;olid and con&s;iderate; while man is plodding how to creep after event, woman trifles with him, dazzles his judgment, &s;kips over him, and &s;eizes her point with agility&mdash; fools that we are!"</P>

<P>"Aurora now threw her blu&s;hes into the apart|ment of Lari&s;&s;a; they &s;uddenly tinged the cheek of my fair mi&s;tre&s;s, mine caught the glow, and I retired. On pa&s;&s;ing through the garden where the flowers, unheedful of erring man, threw their

Pa&s;&s;ing him with feigned compo&s;ure, I ha&s;tened from a &s;pot where danger was awake; on this &s;ingle moment hung the fate of Lari&s;&s;a. But man was made to go for|ward, not one &s;hall go back through his ye&s;terday.

The duke of B**** was no advocate for Lari&s;&s;a or licentious plea&s;ure; his power was great with the king, and with the think|ing part of France, and often would he impercep|tibly lead the Monarch from the fa&s;cinations of a mi&s;tre&s;s, who, on account of her mean extraction, hated the noble&s;&s;e.

Among the latter cla&s;s was my quondam friend the duke. If I could have loved &s;trong vir|tue under any &s;hape, I &s;hould have admired

<P>"Though I had been ob&s;erved by the king's page in the garden of Lari&s;&s;a, his maje&s;ty never took notice of me as a rival. Perhaps he thought me too contemptible, or, not e&s;teeming Lari&s;&s;a enough to depend on her for happine&s;s, plea&s;ant|ly left us to try how long we could love. After &s;he had &s;et off for le&s;s brilliant &s;cenes, I returned, and continued to promote my intere&s;t at court, by flat|tering tho&s;e I de&s;pi&s;ed, and fawning on tho&s;e who mi&s;took &s;ervility for re&s;pect&punc; But the duke had ir|ritated me. He had a&s;&s;erted that Dormoud was too far currupted ever to be reclaimed by friend|&s;hip or example, and had for &s;ome time avoided me in public. Sen&s;ible that one of us mu&s;t go down the wind of favour, I was not long he&s;itating; my actions wore deeper dye than tho&s;e of the duke. He might have ruined me with truth. Virtue had rendered his &s;oul too dignified to enter into a com|petition with Dormoud, who&s;e mines were work|ing at the foundations of his perfection. In plung|ing him from his heights, truth was not on my &s;ide, cunning and chance gave me &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;Louis had &s;ecrets, the multitude had no right to &s;earch for them, they were the &s;ecrets of nece&s;&s;ity; the duke knew this, was faithful to his monarch, concealed his faults, revered his virtues, and breathed his public fame.</P>

was much con&s;oled by his repeated a&s;&s;everations of future friend&s;hip. Where is the man, who&s;e fancy, grown &s;ick with &s;orrow, will not exaggerate the image of comfort, and rai&s;e her pigmy joy too high for his attachment? It is ever &s;o: imagination is too &s;trong in her colouring. I was revived by Dormoud, and forgot the dreadful &s;entence of impri&s;onment for ever. Why, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, is this man a villain! Why &s;hould he boa&s;tingly violate tho&s;e duties the &s;elf-denying &s;truggle to fulfil!</P>
<P>Dear &s;pirit of refinement, from wherever thou ha&s;t cho&s;en thy pure cele&s;tial dwelling, de&s;cend, touch the coar&s;er powers of Dormoud, and lead thy fair ideas through the corrupted region of his mind! From thee, bright form of innocence, fly the brutal &s;hadows that darken the bo&s;om of man. Thine are the grand, the energetic, the invi&s;ible! Thou art the &s;oul of the world!</P>
<P>But what have I to do with refinement? Have I not lo&s;t Emily? A long fit of ab&s;traction fell on my mind as this que&s;tion, prompted by de&s;pair, &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf&mdash;I &s;at &s;ome moments gazing at the waning candle, and at la&s;t put my hand in my pocket, with an intent to reperu&s;e the fatal note I had found, when, to my a&s;toni&s;hment, I drew forth the picture of my mother!

may appear, I thought the picture varied its looks as the emotions of my &s;oul were impatient or re&s;ign|ed. The filth and ru&s;t it had accumulated in the &s;teps of the dungeon I had vi&s;ited with Dormoud, was in my pocket worn off, and the animated fea|tures &s;poke directly to my heart. "All is over," continued I, walking ha&s;tily, "a few months or weeks, and then!" (throwing my&s;elf down on a &s;o|pha recently prepared for me in this elegant room.) "Here I am to remain <HI>for ever!</HI>&mdash;but how came my mother's dear re&s;emblance to this di&s;mal dwel|ling? Is this an abode for &s;o much beauty?

Where &s;hall I go!"&mdash;Imagination &s;eemed to go out at this la&s;t idea, like an extingui&s;hed flame, and I fell into a &s;udden in&s;en&s;ibility. How long I lay in this &s;woon or &s;lumber, (I know not which) I could not recollect. When I recovered, a coldne&s;s had pervaded my whole frame&mdash;I was &s;piritle&s;s and feeble; all my unavailing though unruly pa&s;&s;ion had &s;ub&s;ided, and I calmly reflected, that life could not in this dreadful &s;cene be of long continuance. That &s;trong &s;ympathy, inherent in man, which makes him feel for others, works upon his own heart in a &s;tate of &s;eclu&s;ion.

here unlamented and unknown, the more agoniz|ing thought that my mother might be &s;omewhere near me, inclined me to devi&s;e &s;ome expedient, by which a knowledge of our fate might reach &s;ociety. For this purpo&s;e, I re&s;olved to throw together &s;ome tran&s;actions of my pa&s;t life, and after en|clo&s;ing the picture, which was encircled by the name of my mother, in the mid&s;t of my little hi&s;|tory, to throw the packet into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The days of my infancy were &s;pent in the fore&s;t of &mdash;, near Rochelle, under the gentle tuition of an harmle&s;s pea&s;ant, who cheerfully &s;aw his flocks grazing round the hills, while his wife, after feeding her poultry, and gathering in their eggs, taught me my primer, and progre&s;&s;ively my bible. "Without reading good books," &s;aid this amiable ru&s;tic, "little ma&s;ter can never know the world." I fancied at la&s;t, my mi&s;tre&s;s improved her&s;elf as rapidly as &s;he taught me. From this humble &s;cene I was &s;oon removed. A chariot, the fir&s;t I had ever &s;een, came one morning to carry me from the humble cot of Jannette Froville, but I was not willing to go. I &s;at down, took my tame kid in my lap, and watched my nur&s;e, as &s;he wandered round the hou&s;e to collect my cloaths. The tears rolled &s;o &s;wiftly through her eyes, &s;he hardly could di&s;cern what &s;he &s;ought: nor did the coachman and &s;ervants appear to me half &s;o manly in their

taudry liveries, as my dear plebeian Froville, who had &s;o often taken me on his knee, and warmed my infant hands in his bo&s;om on a fro&s;ty morning, while he pre&s;&s;ed his ruddy lips to my cheek. "No," &s;aid I, "the chariot &s;hall go back till Jan|nette has done crying."</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t not drive back without you," replied the coachman.</P>
<P>"I would fain &s;tay here till the lambs are wean|ed; be&s;ides, my kid will pine to death."</P>
<P>All my childi&s;h objections were over-ruled. Farmer Froville and his wife Jannette wept and prayed over me, and I was at la&s;t, with much re|luctance, parted from all I then held dear, except my little tame kid, to whom I had given the name of Mayo, and who I earne&s;tly reque&s;ted &s;hould be my companion in the chariot. This was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed elaborately by the &s;ervants; the coachman &s;corned to be the coachman of a kid, and the footman gave a &s;upercilious &s;mile at my idea of his riding behind one; but I re&s;olved to be ma&s;ter in this ca&s;e. I had no &s;en&s;e of ble&s;&s;ings in future, my heart was pal|pitating with its pre&s;ent affections; I had enough to &s;truggle with, without being troubled with the impertinence of the&s;e men, and conquered them only by (what they called) &s;ullen ob&s;tinacy. The chariot rolled away&mdash;my eyes kept in view the hou&s;e of Jannette, where health and innocence had fo&s;tered me; it gradually receded; &s;he waved
<PB N="51" REF="029933_0054_0FE3558B49DD6BD0">
her handkerchief, I &s;aw her no more. The tuft of trees that &s;tood near our orchard, under which our &s;heep had gathered at noon, were rapidly pa&s;|&s;ed by, and Mayo, though he loved me be&s;t, gave a farewell cry to his fleecy companions. Happy! happy &s;cene! Thy joys were many, and thy evils few.</P>
<P>Our journey was long, the &s;ervants were dull; I was melancholy, and my kid, I believe, would rather have been &s;kipping from rock to rock, than &s;hut up with a fellow-traveller, &s;o inimical to his lively nature. Our conductors, however, grew cheerful on entering the capacious domains of their ma&s;ter, of whom they &s;poke with reverence and love, and who&s;e name was count de Mar&s;an. This nobleman was ready to receive me. He threw open the chariot door, caught me in his arms, and would have carried me into his hou&s;e, but I was holding Mayo by a blue ribbon, which was twi&s;t|ed round my hand. Finding him&s;elf tacitly con|demned to carry us both, he applauded my tender|ne&s;s, and &s;et me gently on my feet.</P>
<P>"Jannette Froville told me &s;he was not my mo|ther. Are you my father, that you ki&s;s me &s;o?"</P>
<P>"I am not," &s;aid the gentleman,
<Q>but while I exi&s;t, you &s;hall not want a father.</Q></P>
<P>"And will you provide for little Mayo?"</P>

<P>I was contented.</P>
<P>After being led through the variegated &s;cenes that pre&s;ented them&s;elves in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to my dazzled imagination, taught to ob&s;erve the opening buds of nature, tints of the flower, bark, and paintings in the gallery, I was carre&s;&s;ed, treated with &s;weatmeats, and &s;ent to the fir&s;t &s;chool in Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">helle.

<P>My guardian was a man of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction in France, he di&s;approved much of the con&s;titu|tion of his country, but he was brave, and firm to attachments he had once formed.

<P>Finding my&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of over-hear|ing the conver&s;ation of Emily and her father, I immediately took my hat and &s;trolled down the garden; not that I was unintere&s;ted in any delight my guardian could ta&s;te, but I thought it unmanly to remain within hearing of two per&s;ons, who were pouring out their &s;entiments, uncon&s;cious of my &s;ituation&mdash;delicacy is due to all.

The whole expan&s;e was full of beauty, it waited for the melting touch of a Claude-Loraine, before whom nature ever lay in charming luxuriance.

<P>"Impertinent curio&s;ity, Sir," &s;aid, I, "has no place in my bo&s;om; I feel a nobler &s;entiment. I own I did not expect to meet a man of your de|meanour, but I expected to find affliction, and re|&s;olved to &s;often it."</P>

<P>Seating him&s;elf on the damp gravel, of which the floor of this lonely habitation was compo&s;ed, he was for &s;ome minutes, &s;ilent and forgetful of my pre&s;ence, nor could I obtrude a &s;ingle enquiry on a &s;ubject which affected him &s;o deeply.

Night pa&s;&s;ed away, and dawn pre&s;ented to our view yon huge promontory, which you can with ea&s;e di&s;cern to the we&s;tward, and of which we hoped to gain &s;ome craggy part; but, from its foot runs out, beneath the waters, invi&s;i|ble rocks, unknown to the mo&s;t &s;kilful mariner. There our ve&s;&s;el re&s;igned her violent motion for &s;ome moments&mdash;there, &s;he lay trembling on the waves like a dying bird, and beneath a rude &s;well of water, went down for ever! Cla&s;ping the hen-|coop, I was beat again&s;t the rock&mdash;I knew no more! All was calm when I opened my eyes, as I lay on the beach; no ve&s;&s;el appeared, no compa|nion hailed me&mdash;I gazed around, my eyes felt hea|vily; I was not grateful for exi&s;tence, but looked wi&s;hfully at the remor&s;ele&s;s ocean, which had drank my friends. How vacant is the mind when the objects lately moving around us, are &s;uddenly gone for ever! No prayer, no unavailing murmur e&s;caped my lips; &s;uch is the &s;tupidity of man when bewildered by great extremes. I had &s;at pen&s;ively on the beach for &s;ome hours, the billows left me, and my hen-coop; none of my &s;hip-mates
<PB N="75" REF="029933_0078_0FE35600EDA5F960">
appeared; but my appetite for life, &s;ecurity, and food, gradually awakened, and at length grew acute. Not knowing where to find the latter, I was met by the fi&s;herman, who&s;e cabin is &s;mall, and family numerous; nor would a re&s;idence beneath his roof be compatible with my fortune or his &s;afety. His head might an&s;wer for his friend&s;hip to me. My brother, the duke of B****, if &s;till at Paris, will be &s;ecret and faithful. To him I have written a brief account of my &s;ituation. The fi&s;her|man has ventured in his &s;kiff to convey my letters. I have promi&s;ed to reward him, and only wait his return, when I &s;hall quit my native land for ever. I am now forty years old, and am a &s;tranger to the world!"</P>
<P>I now concluded my unknown friend to be of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank: he wi&s;hed to know my place of re&s;idence, and by what accident I had di&s;cover|ed his retreat.</P>
<P>I related my morning excur&s;ion, begged him to command me, if I could a&s;&s;i&s;t him; and added,</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t leave you, amiable and unfortunate &s;tranger. I am dear to the worthie&s;t of men, and &s;hould feel regret in cau&s;ing him one moment's pain: &s;uffer me to &s;ee you once more! I will not prove obtru&s;ive; but I would encounter many evils to prove my&s;elf de&s;erving your confidence. Say I may again privately vi&s;it you in this comfortle&s;s a&s;ylum, &s;o unworthy its inhabitant."</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="029933_0079_0FE3560346AD7900">A melancholy &s;mile &s;pread it&s;elf over the face of this afflicted reclu&s;e; he replied:</P>
<P>"Go, generous youth! per&s;evere in the path of virtue! you will prove a ble&s;&s;ing to your parents! In three days I expect my hone&s;t fi&s;herman, you may command the interval; I will expect you here."</P>
<P>Rai&s;ing my hand re&s;pectfully to his lips, he bade me adieu. I a&s;cended by his ladder, and ha&s;t|ened back to relieve my guardian, who&s;e alarms at my ab&s;ence, I knew, would be powerful.</P>
<P>Wearied and thoughtful with this day's adven|ture, I at la&s;t got home. Surpri&s;e at my early de|parture in the morning, mixed with joy at my ar|rival, were vi&s;ible in the countenance and manner of my guardian. He que&s;tioned me mildly: I did not think my&s;elf at liberty to declare the concerns of an individual, who had, from true noblene&s;s of &s;oul, confided in me. Emily ran from the garden, where &s;he had been &s;electing a bouquette, and with innocent frankne&s;s, declared her&s;elf happy at my return.</P>
<P>"Here" (&s;aid &s;he, pre&s;enting me the flowers &s;he had culled with ta&s;te) "I offer you the tribute of the day, friend of my father! they mu&s;t one day die! and why not die with you?"</P>
<P>Endeavoring to a&s;&s;ume tranquility of manner, &s;pecious, becau&s;e my heart was not tranquil, I ac|cepted, and placed the fragrant gift in my bo&s;om.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="029933_0080_0FE35609707EBBE0">"I will wear your flowers, and only wi&s;h tho&s;e emblems of beauty could live for ever."</P>
<P>"You are kind: my father informs me, your mind is noble, your principles pure, but why do you fly me? my brothers would not have left me &s;o long; I mu&s;t &s;oon return to my convent, why did you not &s;hew me the irregular charms of this romantic country?</P>

<P>As the pure orb of light draws the vapours from their parent earth, and converts them by his efful|gence into ble&s;&s;ings; &s;o did this charming girl in|corporate my &s;oul with hers, till it became refin|ed even to angui&s;h. Her eyes, full of innocence, were fixed on my face as &s;he repeated tho&s;e lines with enthu&s;ia&s;m; the eyes of her father &s;hone with the tear of fond delight; and he happily relieved my unbecoming &s;ilence, by reque&s;ting Emily to favour him with the author &s;he had quo|ted.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="029933_0081_0FE3560BB5BA3238">"The book is very old, my dear &s;ir, the works of my author have been extant for ages; I &s;at on your bed of violets, I read him there; I gazed on the gaudy tulip, her le&s;&s;on was mine; imagination carried me through the variegated mead. All nature taught me there! In a word, my deare&s;t father, I have been from you &s;o long, and am &s;o lately returned to your bo&s;om, that I could ri&s;e on the clouds, and diffu&s;e the harmony I feel!"</P>
<P>"But the author, Emily, has not &s;o particularly favoured me."</P>
<P>I fancied my guardian meant to be good-natur|edly &s;evere on his cheerful daughter, but &s;he re|plied with quickne&s;s.&mdash;"O yes, my lord, in various ways; &s;olitude is the nur&s;e of contemplation, and fancy is officious in the ab&s;ence of our friends. Whil&s;t I was compo&s;ing tho&s;e few lines in your garden, you, perhaps, were forming &s;erious plans of future happine&s;s, and as it is impo&s;&s;ible for a generous man to exi&s;t merely for him&s;elf, you &s;at in awful &s;olemnity, twirling one thumb over the other, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at the fire, and &s;tudying for the hour, what delicacy you &s;hould provide for my dinner, or what gown would be&s;t &s;uit your dear Emily at a ball."</P>
<P>What fine touches affection wore in this reply! Her father, regarding her with complacency, &s;aid&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="029933_0082_0FE35611D9708320">"My lively girl, your heart is now full, exhila|ted and unre&s;trained: but when you leave your convent for worldly &s;cenes, you will, you mu&s;t, unfortunately, be taught re&s;erve: yet, I charge you, my Emily, never to pur&s;ue the wor&s;t methods of your &s;ex; never practi&s;e re&s;erve till it arrive at deceit, nor poi&s;on your blamele&s;s mind with affec|tation."</P>
<P>"Fear it not, my lord; artifice is not nece&s;&s;ary as the world in general think it, nor is affectation lovely; good manners are due to &s;ociety, artifice en&s;laves its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and affectation is di&s;gu&s;t|ing."</P>
<P>Emily had confu&s;ed my ideas, or had given birth to new images in my labouring mind; I could not conver&s;e collectedly, I &s;at lo&s;t in thought; &s;he was in&s;en&s;ible of my infatuation and of her own power.</P>
<P>"Why are you &s;tudious, &s;ir, why are you not like me; lively, happy, grateful for the happine&s;s you receive, and re&s;igned to tran&s;ient affliction? All will pa&s;s away; my confe&s;&s;or has often enjoin|ed me never to repine at woe, nor exult in the rare vi&s;itation of coy felicity. My father will grieve if you grieve, nor can I be truly ble&s;t&mdash;I pray you be happy with us."</P>
<P>"Surely I need not &s;olicit when Emily im|plores," added my guardian; "the language of

nature excels the fini&s;hed periods of rhetoric, and the &s;en&s;ible mind &s;ets a value on &s;implicity."</P>
<P>"Think me not regardle&s;s of your care, my dear friend," &s;aid I; "nor fancy me obdurate to the gentle, yet keen remon&s;trance of your Emily &mdash;But
<Q><L>Oh! what a world of agony is found</L>

<P>"Beware! Beware of indulging wi&s;hes, the gra|tification of which perhaps ought never to be at|tained; I a&s;k not the cau&s;e of your inquietude. I am certain it will be regulated by, or &s;acrificed to virtue; &s;o will you gain the peace you de&s;erve. I do not wonder at your &s;ilent manner; it is mere|ly the effect of habit, habit of education, and edu|cation of natural nece&s;&s;ity: you have the habits of reflection even externally, becau&s;e you are the child of &s;olitude: but certainly, when the &s;oul ex|pands to ta&s;te the joys of &s;ympathetic friend&s;hip, the clouds of &s;ecret angui&s;h are &s;hook off, as the moon from her pure cheek &s;hakes unwhole&s;ome dews."</P>
<P>I apologi&s;ed to this excellent man!</P>
<P>"We will not be pre&s;&s;ingly impolite," rejoin|ed Emily, "but if you are not engaged, I will fini&s;h the piece of embroidery begun in my con|vent, and you &s;hall read to us: my father has in|vited, for to-morrow, a large party of his mo&s;t va|luable friends; we will try to chear you, and in

<P>I was a&s;hamed of giving pain to minds &s;o noble and attentive&mdash;We turned to lively topics, and my friends were happy. Re&s;olving never to embit|ter their felicity by an ill-timed chagrin, which might be con&s;trued into haughty re&s;erve, I with|drew for the night.</P>
<P>Honour!&mdash;What art thou? Who gave thee be|ing in the mind of man? And why, once wanting thee, is woman lo&s;t? On thy &s;trong and everla&s;t|ing ba&s;e friend&s;hip may erect her noble&s;t &s;truc|ture! From thy altar may faultle&s;s love breathe its flame to Heaven! Sighs of mingled &s;ouls, by ab|&s;ence torn, are ever heard in whi&s;pering echos from thy hallowed &s;hrine! The &s;acrifice once of|fered thee, is incen&s;e purer in an angel's face than all the odours of the balmy ea&s;t! Thou! mild &s;pirit of the good! wilt forbid the charming Em|ily to love a man who knows not his parents; who is perhaps an orphan or foundling, and who&s;e fortunes are undecided;&mdash;nor &s;halt thou be profane! I will not indulge tho&s;e weak affections! I will not entangle her artle&s;s mind in the fa&s;ci|nations of blind unwarrantable love! Oh Emily! be happy! May&s;t thou never be &s;ubdued but by the unequalled ec&s;ta&s;y of loving and of being be|loved;
<PB N="82" REF="029933_0085_0FE356205F7FA110">
whil&s;t honour holds its &s;anction o'er thy beauties. Give me, thou mighty Maker of the human heart, fortitude equal to the&s;e &s;elf-deny|ing torments! Conflicts like the&s;e bring angui&s;h too acute for feeble man!</P>
<P>Thus did I rea&s;on and re&s;olve; and quickly did I forget my rea&s;on and re&s;olutions, when gazing on Emily.</P>
<P>On the following morn, devoted to fe&s;tivity, the halls began to &s;ound, the gates were thrown o|pen, the row of aged oaks, which &s;haded the great walk to my guardian's noble edifice, were plea|&s;ingly adorned with fe&s;toons of wild-flowers, and variegated lamps, intended to &s;hed a coloured lu&s;tre on the coming night.</P>
<P>The equipages were brilliant, vi&s;itants numerous, and each appeared to vie with their generous ho&s;t in polite hilarity.</P>
<P>Among the many, came a gentleman, announ|ced by the name of Rederique, &s;on of a Spani&s;h nobleman. I found, near the conclu&s;ion of the evening, he had not been invited, but had brought recommendations from &s;ome of my guardian's friends at *****. I &s;aw him alight, as I &s;tood at my window; his form was elegant, his dre&s;s &s;uperb, his deportment bold&mdash;How much more en|gaging, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, is thy lively air than this cold de&s;pondency that hangs on me!&mdash;Recollect|ing I &s;hould appear negligent in &s;uffering my guardian to &s;eek me, I left my apartment. The
<PB N="83" REF="029933_0086_0FE35625ECF2BAA8">
company had taken their &s;eats when I entered; Roderique had cho&s;en that next Emily; I &s;at op|po&s;ite to him. He &s;urveyed me attentively; I heeded him not; my langui&s;hing &s;oul was breath|ing its wi&s;hes towards the lovelier object near him: I forgot all around her. Roderique, during the day, endeavoured to engro&s;s the conver&s;ation of Emily. Who would not have felt the &s;ame de|&s;ire? Good humour prevailing, and &s;eparation not thought of, our gue&s;ts began to &s;tudy amu&s;e|ment.&mdash;Religion, politics, and impracticable the|ory employed the mental powers of the old, and the young &s;at down to mu&s;ic. Several ladies play|ed with that facility which harmoni&s;es the mind, and renders it yielding to any impre&s;&s;ion of the moment; but when Emily commanded the trembling &s;trings! &s;ympathetic &s;oftne&s;s enervated the &s;oul: The doors of memory opened to her key, and the image, late forgotten, gently aro&s;e be|fore the object it had once adored! All yielded to the enchantment of Emily, who awakened reflection with its joys and &s;orrows. Roderique grew familiar, pronounced her performance di|vine; declared him&s;elf &s;uperlatively ble&s;t; and looking obliquely at me, pronounced the man a brute who could wear a joyle&s;s countenance while &s;uch beauty and &s;kill united in con&s;oling him&mdash;Emily did not hear, or did not regard him, when he reque&s;ted her to play "The charms of

woman-kind." Re&s;pect and de&s;pair kept me at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>"I will play," &s;aid Emily, "a little piece writ|ten by a friend of mine, who is now in the con|vent, to whom I mu&s;t &s;oon return."&mdash;"Heaven forbid," replied Roderique, with more quickne&s;s than good manners&mdash;"I beg pardon, Mi&s;s! let me not interrupt you, or deprive the company of plea&s;ure only in your power to be&s;tow."</P>
<P>"The lady I mention," continued Emily, ad|dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to me, after &s;ilently bending to Roderique, is one of the lovelie&s;t creatures nature ever formed; but &s;he is full of &s;ecret &s;orrow&mdash; pen&s;ive, like you, my worthy friend."</P>
<P>"With feigned compo&s;ure, I replied; "This gentleman wi&s;hes you to play; on me, the harp of Je&s;&s;e could not have half your power."</P>
<P>"Then I will play, and you &s;hall reward me with a &s;mile, &s;o &s;eldom worn, and &s;o highly prized by my father and me."</P>
<P>She &s;ang and played&mdash;
<Q><L>Here dimly burns the wa&s;ting &s;park of life!</L>
<L>Whil&s;t doom'd to wander through the gloomy &s;hade!</L>
<L>For ever lo&s;t, as gentle Henry's wife;</L>
<L>For ever kneeling to the &s;aints for aid.</L>

<L>Points to his heart &s;till bleeding for my lo&s;s,</L>

<P>Slowly flowed tho&s;e pathetic lines, while &s;ym|pathy melted the hearts of the hearers. A tear glided from the eye of Emily as &s;he &s;ang. I had the audacity &s;ilently to wipe it away; but, &s;ud|denly remembering how much I had re&s;olved, &s;tepped back to my &s;eat.</P>
<P>When the mu&s;ic cea&s;ed, Roderique attempted to lead the conver&s;ation on &s;plendor, fa&s;hion, plea|&s;ure, and beauty. He dully expatiated; his lan|guage boa&s;ted not that conden&s;ed keenne&s;s which could denote him capable of enjoying happine&s;s of any kind in an exqui&s;ite degree. Emily entertained us with many little anecdotes, and de&s;cribed the innocent employments invented by the nuns, to alleviate a life of &s;eclu&s;ion, with &s;o much native eloquence, that trifles were made to charm.</P>
<P>"Yet, do all they can," &s;aid &s;he, "the ince&s;&s;ant gloom habitually forms the mind to views of death, till cheerfulne&s;s almo&s;t appears unnatural: indeed, it is a que&s;tion, whether &s;adne&s;s, through every &s;tate, is not mo&s;t predominant. Cheerfulne&s;s is not born &s;o &s;oon, it &s;eldom vi&s;its us uninvited; every little art in &s;ociety is u&s;ed to prolong its &s;tay; and at la&s;t, it leaves us to &s;it down, with memory, and mourn the pa&s;t. For my part, I would rather be innocently cheerful, than &s;ublimely grave."</P>

her body to the virgin of St. Nicholas, in who&s;e chapel &s;he wi&s;hes to be laid."</P>
<P>Poor poete&s;s! &s;aid I, laying down the book, thy heart is no longer torn by contending pa&s;&s;ions, it cea&s;es to beat; Love and friend&s;hip have quitted it for ever.</P>
<P>Meditating on man, I con&s;idered him as mak|ing a progre&s;s towards perfection, only in tho&s;e intervals, when he feels harmony within, ari&s;ing from the gentler pa&s;&s;ions of his nature, and that rude and violent ideas occa&s;ionally throw him back: and concluded, he is at all times a being more entitled to pity than reproach.</P>
<P>Our family were not yet ri&s;en, except Emily, who had left her apartment, and tripped into her father's park. I ob&s;erved &s;he took a friendly peep at my poor Mayo, who was now indolent from age, and for who&s;e repo&s;e a little cot was erected near the park gate.</P>
<P>Unnoticed, I followed the lively maid, &s;aw her &s;toop, and admire the humid flowerets, and heard her congratulate the lark as the Heaven-loving &s;ong&s;tre&s;s a&s;cended from her downy chamber.</P>
<P>The &s;un had &s;carcely drawn up the grey aether from the vallies; and the &s;hepherd, who was &s;low|ly winding the di&s;tant hill, appeared through a mi&s;t. His hands were folded athwart his bo&s;om, his long hair fell on his &s;houlders, and his faith|full dog crept humbly behind him. Happy clown!
<PB N="97" REF="029933_0100_0FE3566D8D3F1530">
Who would not give their grandeur for thy vacant ea&s;e? He kept his path, approached Emily with ru&s;tic diffidence, and bowed as he pa&s;&s;ed, but the amiable girl would not &s;uffer him to go unwel|comed by her morning offering; &s;he opened her pur&s;e, reque&s;ted him to partake of its contents, and curtified as &s;he left him. For "his eyes lack'd lu&s;tre, and his locks were grey."</P>
<P>Giving her time to advance before me, I que&s;|tioned the venerable pea&s;ant; the man that could claim Emily's attention was worthy mine.</P>
<P>He told me his &s;on was a &s;oldier at ******, that he now lay ill in an ho&s;pital there, and if he could but get him cleared, Anna, he was certain, would recover with gladne&s;s at her brother's return.&mdash; "What ails your Anna? will money or advice relieve her?"</P>
<P>"No, no, &s;ir, &s;he does not much mind money. And, as for advice, &s;he does not care to take it. I I have &s;aid to her, that reading the Bible can hurt no one, but &s;he reads about things I don't under|&s;tand."&mdash;</P>
<P>Why, in a lituation where labour is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, does your daughter wa&s;te her hours?"</P>
<P>This ill-natured que&s;tion di&s;agreed with my under&s;tanding and ta&s;te. I was not illiberal enough to confine &s;pirit to &s;ituation; nature often exalts one above the other, but I was willing to
<PB N="98" REF="029933_0101_0FE35674C524A680">
hear how he would defend his Anna&mdash;He re|plied:</P>
<P>"O, &s;ir, &s;he labours as much as I do, through the day, in &s;pinning, and what not, and reads when &s;he &s;hould take her natural re&s;t&mdash;What is night for, &s;ir, but to &s;leep?"</P>
<P>"Hem!&mdash;to meditate&mdash;and mourn!"&mdash;&s;aid I.</P>
<P>"But there!"&mdash;&s;oftening his voice, "Anna can|not &s;leep!&mdash;there mu&s;t be &s;omething wrong in it. Poor Anna, I hope, will find a better world!"</P>
<P>He drew his hand over his eyes; the &s;uffu&s;ion could not be concealed&mdash;I turned my&s;elf round&mdash;. When a man wi&s;hes to hide his emotions, it is at lea&s;t unrefined to &s;tare at his &s;truggling features. Emily had &s;et me an example of genero&s;ity, I fol|lowed it, the pea&s;ant was grateful in the warm lan|guage of nature, and went on.</P>
<P>The charming girl, with all her enthu&s;ia&s;m for the beauties of nature, was fearful of rang|ing too far to contemplate them&mdash;&s;he turned back, was a little &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing me &s;o near; but, &s;oon recovering that irre&s;i&s;tible ea&s;e, which graced her every movement, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed me with a &s;mile&mdash;</P>

<P>"My father would think your reflection un|kind&mdash;He has taught me candor.

<P>"Our pa&s;&s;ions, Emily, are often dangerous; we are obliged to conceal them, fearing their ef|fects may prove fatal to the cau&s;e of virtue; and, even in this laudable concealment, we may appear in&s;incere."</P>
<P>"Right&mdash;<HI>there</HI> I will allow a virtuous mind to pre&s;cribe for it&s;elf!"</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="029933_0103_0FE35680E7FC05E0">"And while the wounded heart is thus &s;trug|gling and pre&s;cribing for it&s;elf, does it not de&s;erve the con&s;olation, rather than the contempt of &s;ocie|ty? No great good can be attained worthy the &s;a|crifice of truth, but truth is &s;o fine, &s;o exqui&s;ite and rare, &s;he will not &s;ometimes obtrude on the coar&s;er part of mankind; the wi&s;e, through mo|de&s;ty, often conceal her."</P>

<P>"Well, &s;ir, you &s;ay the pa&s;&s;ions are dangerous, I believe they are u&s;eful, and only rebellious when we would give them fal&s;e meanings, or render them &s;ub&s;ervient to poor convenience. The pa&s;&s;ions are the wings of &s;pirit. Cold tranquility the grave of thought. Turn your eyes to my convent! Even there the pa&s;&s;ions reign; but they rove through the mind like murmuring winds through barren and gloomy regions."</P>
<P>"I only mean, Emily, that the chain of rea&s;on &s;hould be thrown on the de&s;ires of the heart."</P>
<P>"Rea&s;on! What is rea&s;on? By what criterion is it e&s;tabli&s;hed? Rea&s;on is cheap, vague; offering

For you, &s;ir, there is no nece&s;&s;ity of torturing or concealing truth, your heart is not capable of a &s;entiment that can di&s;grace you!"</P>
<P>We now perceived my guardian and Roderique &s;trolling round the park; they &s;oon joined us, on an eminence from which the eye wandered over the ocean till it was &s;tayed by the horizon.</P>
<P>The father of Emily, taking her hand, inform|ed us, he had prevailed on his accompli&s;hed gue&s;t (meaning Roderique) to remain a week with him. &mdash;"Rural beauties cannot invite an imagination long &s;oftened by luxurious &s;cenes, and made re&s;t|le&s;s by varied delights, in which the poi&s;ons of the heart are concealed.

ocean, was in the hand of the latter: I reque&s;ted the favor of it, and rai&s;ing it to my eye, immedi|ately di&s;cerned a little &s;kiff or &s;loop, but thinly manned, labouring through the billows&mdash;My heart fluttered. I concluded the wanderer of the main to be the faithful fi&s;herman, &s;o impatiently expect|ed by the fugitive in the rock.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the gentle thrillings of the blood which we &s;o powerfully feel when collateral incident &s;trikes on the image of our trea&s;ured joys. I felt a tran&s;port &s;acred to friend|&s;hip; I concealed that tran&s;port, even from the friends I loved&mdash;Did I value truth the le&s;s?</P>
<P>I re&s;tored my guardian his per&s;pective, and we ha&s;tened home to breakfa&s;t. Roderique was parti|cularly attentive to Emily, her father was kind to all; never did ho&s;pitality &s;mile on a more benig|nant form.</P>
<P>My die was ca&s;t! My wi&s;hes were &s;ilent; but every progre&s;&s;ive moment convinced me that Emily was nece&s;&s;ary to my peace.</P>
<P>Roderique had been given to my attention: he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of making an excur&s;ion round the country; I felt undelighted with the idea of accompanying him, and feigned my&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed. The &s;plendor of the &s;kies, notwith&s;tanding my ex|cu&s;e, tempted our family-party to take a turn through the meadows; and to the care of Emily and her father, did I, for good rea&s;ons, re&s;ign the

envied Roderique. In pa&s;&s;ing the gate, he offered his arm to the amiable maid, &s;he declined it, and accepted that of my guardian. My eyes pur&s;ued them, till they were lo&s;t in the &s;hade of elm trees that grew round the adjacent enclo&s;ure; when, ha&s;tily ordering my hor&s;e, I re&s;olved in&s;tantly to depart for the mi&s;erable cavity of my poor reclu&s;e. I rode threw a narrow lane, with the &s;ole purpo&s;e of avoiding my friends; and at the end of a field, to the right, my hor&s;e's head turned &s;uddenly upon them. They had cro&s;&s;ed the meadow which di|rected to the &s;ame point. I was a little aba&s;hed; Emily &s;miled, and a&s;ked me, "which I had con|quered, my indi&s;po&s;ition, or my love of truth?"</P>
<P>"My indi&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t be conquered by &s;trong|er forces than mine, dear Emily; my love of truth remains; I will convince you of it in &s;ome happier moment; at pre&s;ent, do not condemn me un|heard."&mdash;Adding to this, the u&s;ual compliments of the day, and congratulations on the plea&s;ure of their walk, I rode off.</P>
<P>The heat of the &s;un was forgot, while &s;purred on by impatient friend&s;hip; I &s;oon arrived at the brink of the precipice, where I had fir&s;t &s;een the intere&s;ting &s;tranger. Slipping my hor&s;e's bridle on an oak branch, I roved along the jagged &s;urface of the rock, but &s;aw no guiding mark; and recollect|ed rather late, that I had appointed no hour of return to this &s;olitary &s;cene. Stung by di&s;appoint|ment,
<PB N="104" REF="029933_0107_0FE35695D6AE4E10">
I called aloud; the rock reverberated, but no human voice an&s;wered me; my vexation and my hallooing availed me nothing; I grew &s;pirit|le&s;s, and was remourning, when a dam&s;el appear|ed at a great di&s;tance; &s;he &s;eemed &s;uddenly to have ari&s;en from beneath the &s;hrubbery which cloathed the &s;lanting hills: her hat was in her hand; I ob&s;erved &s;he &s;hook it at me, as one of my feet was in the &s;tirrup, the other on the earth; I left my aukward po&s;ition, again fa&s;tened my bridle to the tree, and received her with that delicacy due to the female character. She &s;miled, curt|&s;ied, and I wi&s;hed her fair weather on her journey.</P>
<P>"I thank you, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he; "but my journey I believe mu&s;t end here, for unle&s;s you be the gen|tleman, I am come to &s;eek one I cannot find, and talk of one I do not know."</P>
<P>Chance may do much for you, my good girl&mdash; from whence or from whom are you &s;ent?"&mdash;</P>

<P>"I am the man; lead me quickly to my friend"&mdash;</P>
<P>Without he&s;itation, the dam&s;el directed me down the declivity, with which &s;he was well ac|quainted. At &s;ome moments &s;he kindly obliged me to re&s;t on her arm, while &s;he fir&s;t de&s;cended the rugged &s;teep; alternately &s;he tru&s;ted her&s;elf to my &s;uperior &s;trength. Holding her in my arms, I <HI>once</HI> involuntarily pre&s;&s;ed her to my bo&s;om; &s;ilence reigned around, the &s;kies them&s;elves were full of beneficence, and creative power! But&mdash; virtue, in the form of Emily, &s;uddenly filled my &s;oul; &s;he checked the dangerous &s;en&s;ation, and it died away.</P>
<P>"If honour con&s;i&s;ts of &s;elf-re&s;traint, then am I honourable," whi&s;pered my &s;pirit to the watchful angels&mdash;Lydia is young, unartful, and wake to the touch of tenderne&s;s. Shame on the man who would &s;teal from her cheek the crim&s;on of inno|cence.&mdash;"</P>
<P>Meditations of this kind officiou&s;ly operated in my bo&s;om as the gentle maid conducted me to her father's hut&mdash;and meditations of this kind only &s;erve to prove that man can forego one ble&s;|&s;ing, while in pur&s;uit of a better.</P>

Some letters lay before him, which I imagined he had been reading, and Lydia twice announced me before he rouzed from his reflective po&s;ture. A gleam of unaffected joy en|livened him as he welcomed me to his embrace.</P>
<P>The fi&s;herman made his appearance; his garb was mean, his habitation homely; yet on his brow &s;at that dignity, which hone&s;ty dares to wear in the pre&s;ence of princes.

<P>"And how will you depart?" replied I.&mdash;</P>
<P>"Here are jewels to a large amount," (&s;aid he,) "in this ca&s;ket, which I had concealed in my belt a few hours before we were &s;urpri&s;ed by the &s;torm: I have al&s;o &s;ome ca&s;h: with this poor fi&s;herman and his family, have I &s;worn to divide my fortune; and I have promi&s;ed to &s;end for them, when once I am in a place of &s;afety&mdash;His children &s;hall be mine."</P>
<P>I began to &s;u&s;pect the charming Lydia had made an impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of this gentleman; for &s;uperlative gratitude generally &s;prings from &s;ecret love&mdash;I was forming fal&s;e ideas.</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;ir, continued he, "I will &s;tudy to cheer his creeping hours of age; and my friend&s;hip &s;hall ble&s;s him, when his &s;trength is no more."</P>
<P>I &s;tooped, under the pretence of fa&s;tening my buckle, but in reality to hide my emotion&mdash; "Why," (my melting heart would have &s;aid,) "mu&s;t I never find a father to relieve, when his health and &s;trength are no more?"</P>
<P>In &s;tooping forward, the miniature I had worn for years round my neck, broke its chain, and fell to the ground. The &s;tranger fir&s;t perceived it,
<PB N="108" REF="029933_0111_0FE356B14E9FF138">
caught it up, and was politely offering it me, when I jocularly que&s;tioned him, "If &s;o much beauty excited not his attention?"</P>
<P>He gazed&mdash;In a moment his &s;oul was lo&s;t in &s;ilent contemplation!&mdash;Pre&s;&s;ing the lovely image to his lips, he bur&s;t into tears, and could only ar|ticulate&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is &s;he!&mdash;my long, long lo&s;t angel!"</P>
<P>Confu&s;ed as I was, prudence at the moment re&s;trained me from calling a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He rai&s;ed his eyes, and exclaimed, with a mournful look, "Where is &s;he? Why have you torn her from me! Speak!&mdash;Tell me &s;he will again be mine!"</P>
<P>I could promi&s;e nothing&mdash;I knew not the ori|ginal.</P>
<P>Suddenly &s;tarting from his &s;eat, where I had &s;upported his reclining head, he walked ha&s;tily the extent of the room for &s;ome minutes. It was a &s;hort traver&s;e, but he was more agitated than the traveller, who is &s;etting out on a long journey, poorly provided.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;uming compo&s;ure, he at length addre&s;&s;ed me:</P>
<P>"How dare you wear this picture?"</P>
<P>"I value it highly, &s;ir; it was given me by the man I mo&s;t love."</P>
<P>"Perhaps the lady loved him too&mdash;but this is not a moment for expo&s;tulation."</P>
<P>His increa&s;ing rage blinded his rea&s;on; in a &s;trong paroxy&s;m he pointed his &s;word at me&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="029933_0112_0FE356B64F520710">"Beware, &s;ir! or you will prove how fallacious are your ideas of honour."</P>
<P>Stung by the &s;alutary hint, he re&s;ted the point of his &s;word on the ground, and &s;tood lo&s;t in &s;ilent de&s;pair.</P>
<P>"O heaven! is this thy care of man?&mdash;Was I not ye&s;terday &s;ufficiently wretched? I did not think it in the power of fate further to heap the mea&s;ure of my woes!&mdash;This day, what am I!&mdash; It is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;She never could love another!&mdash; No matter&mdash;Pardon me, &s;ir, I am wrong&mdash;I am di&s;tracted&mdash;Where will you arm?&mdash;I mu&s;t keep this picture."</P>
<P>"If our ho&s;t can provide me a &s;word, I will do my&s;elf the ju&s;tice of defending a heart as worthy as your own; but not unle&s;s you fir&s;t re&s;tore the prize we fight for."</P>
<P>"It is mine,"&mdash;&s;aid he fiercely&mdash;</P>
<P>"Not without you own it as a theft; and &s;uch an avowal will for ever throw you beneath my no|tice. I will contend with you as a gentleman, not as a robber."</P>
<P>"You are right," (replied he with a melancho|ly air,) "it mu&s;t be your's till I have won it.&mdash; Go! (after pre&s;&s;ing it to his lips) "ine&s;timable jewel! Dear re&s;emblance of all I adore! Why, ah! why art thou in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any but the man

<P>Pronouncing the&s;e words in a re&s;olute tone, he bowed, and re&s;tored me the picture; I placed it in my bo&s;om, and firmly waited that tremendous trial which is formed on &s;avage principles, and de&s;er|vedly de&s;pi&s;ed when the pa&s;&s;ions have &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>I was well aware that the fatal victory we had mutually re&s;olved to gain, mu&s;t, in future, give birth to remo&s;e in the mind of the &s;urvivor: but pu&s;illanimity would have rendered me unworthy the friend&s;hip of this exalted unknown; and &s;o &s;trangely was my heart attached to him, that death from his hand would be in my opinion le&s;s painful than life with the lo&s;s of his e&s;teem.</P>
<P>My antagoni&s;t had, at my reque&s;t, left the apart|ment we were in, to enquire for &s;ome kind of arms. He returned without effecting his purpo&s;e: the unwealthful habitation of our ho&s;t needed no military prowe&s;s to defend it; for over his little all, did quiet Poverty &s;pread her &s;able wing.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed, yet highly raging, the &s;tranger of|fered me his &s;word, on condition I &s;hould re&s;tore him the picture.</P>

<P>Never had my heart &s;u&s;tained &s;uch a moment of &s;oftened angui&s;h. Tearing open his bo&s;om, this too-powerful opponent kneeled, and offered me his &s;word. Pity mixed with my &s;tronger feelings. I lamented the laws of honour which obliged me never to re&s;ign the gift he &s;ued for; and, while I made him under&s;tand me on this cruel point, I rai&s;ed his compa&s;&s;ion, for he &s;eemed well acquain|ted with mental conflict.</P>
<P>"Come with me, my unfortunate friend," (&s;aid I, offering him my hand) come with me to my home; we may there find an explanation of this my&s;tery; you &s;hall, you mu&s;t be convinced, that I have never wronged you."</P>
<P>"I will go!"&mdash;(replied he with wild impa|tience) "Conjecture is the child of uncertainty; the man who yields to it is &s;ometimes heedle&s;sly undone.

<P>"Suffer me to direct you to the top of the mountain," (&s;aid he to his impa&s;&s;ioned gue&s;t,) "though I fear you are returning to perfidy and death; why will you not pur&s;ue your fir&s;t purpo&s;e of going to the duke?&mdash;May heaven protect you!"</P>

<P>We departed, in company with her hone&s;t fa|ther. My hor&s;e (whom I had forgot) was feeding heartily on the brow of the hill. My long ab&s;ence made him impatient and hungry; he had broke his bridle, and hunger, not gratitude, detained him

near the &s;pot where he was left by a thoughtle&s;s ma&s;ter. Here the fi&s;herman took leave of us, and returned to his cabin and his children.</P>
<P>That gloomy &s;ilence which hangs on two objects deeply intere&s;ted, when neither can collect lan|guage equal to his feelings, prevailed with me and my companion, from the moment we left the fi&s;herman till we arrived at the gate of my guar|dian. Emily received us with re&s;trained a&s;toni&s;h|ment, the habit of the &s;tranger made an apology nece&s;&s;ary.

<P>He did not know how far the &s;oul of Emily &s;oared above the gaudy &s;eemings of the world. Compliments, the frivolity of which, the good &s;en&s;e of Emily &s;oon annihilated, were at an end, when my guardian and Roderique entered.

On the &s;econd of April, which, I believe, according to the letter I received from the duke, was about a week before you and your tutor were committed to clo&s;e con|finement, this youth, then an infant, was placed beneath my care. Not having accommodations &s;uited to &s;o tender a babe, my wife being dead, and my children receiving different educations, a di&s;tance from me, I re&s;igned him to the care of one of my tenants. The man was nobly hone&s;t,
<PB N="118" REF="029933_0121_0FE356E462F56AC8">
the woman &s;imple and uncorrupted. With them he grew; the miniature, which has cau&s;ed &s;o much altercation, was &s;ent me by the duke of B****&mdash;I hung it round the neck of Henry; and not daring to reveal the &s;ecret of his birth, only charged him to pre&s;erve it even at the expence of life. How well he has obeyed my injunction you can determine."</P>
<P>"I will not arraign the mercy of Heaven," &s;aid my father; "my &s;on is re&s;tored. Who &s;hall &s;et bounds to everla&s;ting beneficence?&mdash;May I not yet behold her! May not &s;ome dark unfathoma|ble event throw the long-loved beauty into my faithful arms! How the imaginary phantom dances to my tender wi&s;hes!&mdash;but&mdash;I mu&s;t be re|&s;igned."</P>
<P>During this &s;cene of unaffected joy, we had forgot Roderique&mdash;Nature had left no vacuum in our &s;ouls, and affection had clo&s;ed every avenue, through which a mere object of polite civility could enter on our recollection. Whil&s;t our glow|ing &s;entiments were thus undergoing a mutual interchange, Roderique had &s;at him&s;elf down to write, like one who was intent on taking minutes of &s;ome extraordinary occurrence.&mdash;And &s;uch the reader will ere long, perceive was the employ|ment of that gentleman at this intere&s;ting eclair|ci&s;&s;ement.</P>
<P>I had ever prized my&s;elf on being an adept in &s;crutinizing the human heart, and never did my
<PB N="119" REF="029933_0122_0FE356EBC1921980">
vanity &s;o fal&s;ely &s;upport it&s;elf as now. I affected to be wonderfully penetrating, when I told Ro|derique, as he &s;miled at my father, with a kind of triumph, that the genero&s;ity of his mind &s;hone &s;trongly in his features. Roderique ha&s;tily &s;queez|ing the paper, on which he had wrote, thru&s;t it into his pocket, and advanced towards us. I never, till now, had given him credit for goodne&s;s of heart; and was plea&s;ed in pre&s;enting him to my father as an accompli&s;hed nobleman, whom we ranked in the number of our friends.</P>
<P>We had acted inadvertently, but there was no recalling the pa&s;t moment, and we &s;uffered in the &s;equel for our imbecility.</P>
<P>Surely there are &s;ea&s;ons of &s;weet delirium, when the &s;oul feels her&s;elf unu&s;ually enlarged and boun|tiful. Then, if ever, we re&s;emble our Creator; we would eagerly di&s;pen&s;e delight, as we unexpected|ly receive it; while fancy increa&s;es the rapture by throwing agreeable tints on every object around us. My over-flowing heart was immerged in new-born tran&s;port; and my reader will not wonder that Roderique appeared through a plea&s;ing me|dium&mdash;Had I not lately found a father? &s;hame on the man, (&s;aid I to my&s;elf) who &s;u&s;pects a friend, and has not candor to reveal his &s;entiments. What harmony would animate the world, were mortals &s;incere! Thus I arraigned my rectitude, for having beheld Roderique with pa&s;t di&s;like. I was at this moment &s;o very generous as to a&s;cribe that di&s;like to my love for Emily, and re&s;olved in future to be
<PB N="120" REF="029933_0123_0FE347FDD995D5D0">
more ju&s;t in re&s;training my de&s;ires and expanding my friend&s;hip; nor did Roderique, in my opinion, retain his wonted manner; his <HI>hauteur</HI> was chang|ed to ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s; I became &s;ubdued by his at|tention, and was fa&s;tened to his will; in a word, we were friends.</P>
<P>My father, though evidently pining after good unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, was grateful to the kind civilities of my guardian, who&s;e every effort was meant to plea&s;e. In hunting, angling, and rural diver&s;ion we &s;trove to le&s;&s;en the weight of care; but fate had laden my father too heavily! my friend Roderique too &s;eemed lately to have taken up his &s;hare of bu&s;ine&s;s; I never could tempt him from his em|ploy, which was continually writing and receiving letters. I was, therefore, allowed &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to arrange my plans of future happine&s;s. I had but one; and re&s;olved, the fir&s;t opportunity, to a&s;k my father's con&s;ent, that I might marry Emily. Yet, I had not endeavored to engro&s;s the affections of that lovely object; I even &s;ometimes avoided her, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould ob&s;erve the angui&s;h of my &s;oul, pity, and &s;ecretly love me under inau&s;picious influences. Heavens! what would I not have re&s;igned for the knowledge of this one truth!</P>
<P>Thou wilt find, my gentle reader, I am very incon&s;i&s;tent; but we are all &s;o; love and virtue cla&s;hing in thy mind, will make thee feel with me.</P>
<P>Yes, I wi&s;hed Emily's affection to keep pace with mine. I wi&s;hed her to ta&s;te that pure, though vi&s;ionary bli&s;s of loving, without the dull certainty of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing; of voluntarily yielding, with the choice
<PB N="121" REF="029933_0124_0FE356EF8BDC58B0">
of being free; of keeping the reins of her conduct in her own hands, without being a&s;&s;aulted by the wild pa&s;&s;ions of a man, who, at times, could not an&s;wer for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Such was the great pa&s;&s;ion with which I longed to fill the heart of Emily; for this rea&s;on I re&s;olved privately to gain the &s;anction of her father and mine, and to watch the dawning of her gentle wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>To aid this little plan, and throw wider my view of happine&s;s, Roderique one day informed me, he &s;hould &s;oon depart.&mdash;I know not why, but my heart fluttered &s;trangely at this information.</P>
<P>"Are you not unwilling," &s;aid I, "to leave &s;o fine a country. Is here no object, who&s;e charms are powerful enough to detain you?"</P>
<P>What an awkwardne&s;s there was in this que&s;tion; every word of it &s;imply declares.</P>
<P>"None more powerful than your own," re|plied Roderique: "in your conver&s;ation, I have learned the le&s;&s;ons of honour, of truth, and of filial affection: accept my heart, and call me for ever your's."</P>
<P>Still I panted for an avowal of Roderique's &s;en|timents re&s;pecting Emily. I had no right to accu&s;e or complain; I had beheld a trea&s;ure without at|tempting to &s;ecure it, and his privilege was fair as mine. I continued mu&s;ing, as I &s;poke, on the in|&s;en&s;ible vivacity of Roderique, who was &s;o &s;oon to leave us; like a &s;hadow we mu&s;t behold no more.</P>
<P>"My guardian will regret your ab&s;ence&mdash;even
<PB N="122" REF="029933_0125_0FE356F6D6725680">
Emily&mdash;the charming Emily&mdash;" (an ill-timed &s;igh lengthened her name upon my lips)&mdash;"perhaps may mourn."</P>
<P>"Emily is lovely," replied Roderique, with wonderful carele&s;sne&s;s, "but I leave her to you&mdash; pur&s;ue, po&s;&s;e&s;s, be happy, and grow old in all &s;he is capable of communicating. For me, my dear friend, other plea&s;ures wait. I will return to my former &s;cene of gaiety, I will remember you and Emily, and I will flatter my&s;elf with the idea of not being always a &s;tranger to your memory."</P>
<P>Selfi&s;h as I was, Roderique relieved me from the excrutiating pangs of jealou&s;y. In return, I made him warm prote&s;tations of la&s;ting regard. Feeble was my judgment, and officious in &s;elf-de|ception, when I fancied this man capable of di&s;in|tere&s;ted friend&s;hip. Yet, had Emily never exi&s;ted, Roderique might have been le&s;s abandoned.</P>
<P>Our conver&s;ation was prolonged from the park gate, where it began, to the door of my guardian's man&s;ion; in the window of which we e&s;pied the charming maid leaning on her hand. She had &s;tu|diou&s;ly avoided company for &s;ome days; had &s;el|dom left her own apartment; and her father in|formed us &s;he complained of an oppre&s;&s;ion near her heart. "I will invite her to ride with me," &s;aid this indulgent man, "in hopes of di&s;&s;ipating a melancholy I cannot account for."</P>
<P>He accordingly accompanied her over the adja|cent plains; I implored the angel of health to re|&s;tore her native chearfulne&s;s, and retired to my &s;tudy.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="029933_0126_0FE356FC19E48270">I had taken up the orations, &s;aid to have been delivered by the divine Plato, to his di&s;ciples on the promontory of Sunium, and had read a few pages, when I was di&s;turbed by a gentle rap at my door&mdash;it was my father who entered; he &s;aluted me affectionately, and began a conver&s;ation with a &s;erious air.</P>
<P>"The ob&s;curity of this peaceful &s;pot, my dear &s;on, &s;uits my mi&s;erable fortunes; but how long may I, with honour, continue under the kind pro|tection of your guardian, who&s;e life and property may be endangered by his ho&s;pitality to me? While I am a wanderer, and free from chains, Louis trembles for his crown. I am his twin-bro|ther, was born with him in the &s;ame hour, con&s;e|quently, have been a &s;tate pri&s;oner through life, and am now an exile. I &s;eek not the diadem of France; my heart is not &s;o heated by ambition, as by civil commotion, to &s;hed the blood of thou&s;ands; nor would I wi&s;h you to be known through the realm, as the nephew of the king."</P>
<P>My blood &s;eemed to make a full pau&s;e at this declaration; but it pau&s;ed only to revi&s;it my heart with treble force.</P>
<P>"What!&mdash;my noble father! are you content to creep round the world a victim to per&s;ecution, and an alien to &s;ociety?"</P>
<P>"Content is with your mother; if I find her, the dominions of nature will be mine."</P>
<P>"May the Almighty power in re&s;toring her to you, give me the ble&s;&s;ing I have never known!&mdash;
<PB N="124" REF="029933_0127_0FE3570190440C18">
But do not expect to hear me whi&s;tle after the plough, or die undi&s;tingui&s;hed amid&s;t the peaceful plea&s;ures of the&s;e woodlands.&mdash;Bid me go and &s;eek my mother! Bid me ru&s;h into the path of glory; I may learn her de&s;tiny&mdash;I may &s;often yours, I may &s;natch &s;ome laurels from the hand of war; at lea&s;t, my life will not glide away without leaving a proof of my exi&s;tence on the annals of fame."</P>
<P>He an&s;wered.&mdash;"Fame has affliction for her fa|vorite: &s;he &s;ets him up; he veers with her bla&s;t, and riots in her tran&s;ient charms. Soon, much too &s;oon, her minion falls from her fine&s;t height. En|vy receives him in her &s;naky bo&s;om; he looks up, and owns with regret, that no &s;ummit was ever gained on which man can permanently re&s;t."</P>
<P>"But my honour, &s;ir, will oblige me at lea&s;t to leave this &s;cene; at once inactive, inglorious, and dangerous to you, to my guardian, to me, and to&mdash;"</P>
<P>Here my con&s;cious heart arre&s;ted my tongue, before it wildly pronounced the name of her I loved; for, however cold I might appear to be, I too, certainly, at &s;ome moments, feared for Emily and my&s;elf. Be&s;ides, did not a &s;uffering father &s;tand before me, who&s;e wrongs I was impatient to redre&s;s?&mdash;He did, and my whole &s;oul became ex|panded with the grandeur of her own ideas.</P>
<P>My father calmly replied&mdash;"Your ob&s;ervations are ju&s;t, my &s;on; for your &s;ecret con&s;olation pre|&s;erve your honour and your virtue, and barter not either for public fame. Fame can never repay you.
<PB N="125" REF="029933_0128_0FE3570450956068">
I am &s;erious&mdash;If quitting this retreat will &s;ecure your rectitude, you &s;hall with me immediately depart."</P>
<P>During this &s;peech, I felt the power of my father darting to the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of my troubled mind.</P>
<P>He continued&mdash;"Emily has informed me&mdash;"</P>
<P>I &s;tarted.&mdash;"Why are you agitated? why do you turn pale? Be &s;eated, my worthy Henry," politely drawing a chair, this generous fugitive proceeded:</P>
<P>"Ye&s;terday you lamented the dejection of Emi|ly; you were &s;urprized at her avoiding the pre|&s;ence of your&s;elf and Roderique; you know not the cau&s;e, nor do I; the motives of tho&s;e who are all innocence and delicacy may not be imper|tinently &s;crutinized; but &s;he is not happy."</P>
<P>"God forbid, &s;ir!&mdash;who makes her otherwi&s;e? I will not tamely&mdash;pray inform me."&mdash;</P>
<P>My Father &s;miled; and, interrupting me, &s;aid, "I find you are no culprit, Henry, you hourly give me new proofs of exalted purity. Emily has informed me, that &s;he wi&s;hes to cut &s;hort this vi&s;it to her Father, and reque&s;ts me to u&s;e my influence with him, that &s;he may, in three days, depart. In my convent, &s;aid the charming girl, I &s;hall find the peace I have lo&s;t. Here I have met with in&s;o|lence; but &s;hould I reveal the name of him who has offended me, his life would be the expiation; or my dear, my valuable father might fall in the conte&s;t! I therefore intreat you to forward my departure from a &s;pot where my bo&s;om &s;uffers from more cau&s;es than one."</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="029933_0129_0FE3570B00F17098">My Father, towards the conclu&s;ion of this &s;peech, eyed me with fixed regard, while the mantling blood aro&s;e from my heart and &s;pread an hone&s;t anger over my vi&s;age; particles of fire &s;eemed to fly before me.</P>
<P>I only articulated, "what &s;hall I do, &s;ir!&mdash; What would you do? Cha&s;ti&s;e the di&s;turber of my Emily!"</P>
<P>With a mournful look, he turned from me, and walked &s;ilently to the window, while my agitation became extreme. Willingly would I have fallen at his feet, and poured out the &s;entiments of my &s;oul; I had not the power&mdash;by irre&s;i&s;tible reve|rence I was chained to my &s;eat.</P>
<P>My father, &s;till gazing through the window, in a mu&s;ing attitude, and without turning to look at me, &s;aid, in a low voice, "Would you de&s;troy the peace of Emily?"</P>
<P>"Me, Sir!&mdash;I de&s;troy the peace of Emily! O, thou Almighty Power! who ha&s;t formed me to thy will, be thou her &s;trong defender!"</P>
<P>Endeavouring to calm my perturbed &s;pirit, I &s;tood &s;ilent; my father, at length, approaching me with quickne&s;s, &s;aid, affectionately, "Henry! &mdash;My dear Henry! Why will you in vain di&s;tre&s;s me? I a&s;k not your confidence, becau&s;e you ap|pear re&s;olved that I never &s;hall &s;hare it; but, is it impo&s;&s;ible for us to meet on equal terms? I pro|mi&s;e to advi&s;e, not re&s;train you; and will lo&s;e the name of father in that of friend&mdash;Only try to for|get Emily!"</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="029933_0130_0FE35711838A8268">Pre&s;&s;ing his hand to my lips, I exclaimed, "Yes, my father, I &s;ee too plainly you dare not tru&s;t your &s;on; you will not permit me to be the guar|dian of that gentle maid; and yet, Sir, her father once told me, that, to my honour, he could con|fide his child."</P>
<P>"I could tru&s;t her with your <HI>honour,</HI> but not with your AFFECTION."</P>
<P>This was a &s;troke I was not aware of. I fell be|fore him, breathed my guiltle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion in fervent language; and a&s;&s;ured him I had never influenced the mind of Emily by an avowal of my love.</P>
<P>My father was plea&s;ed; he &s;trove to bring me back to tranquility; yet, whil&s;t he talked of rea|&s;on, of prudence, and of proud philo&s;ophy, his eyes were full of tears. I hoped to profit by the tenderne&s;s of the moment; I drew back his me|mory to the image of my mother. He was di&s;turb|ed; his bo&s;om heaved; and I exulted in the idea of having conquered his objections. To whom could I plead with more hope of &s;ucce&s;s?&mdash;Had not my father known the joys and the &s;orrows of unconquerable love?</P>
<P>He was &s;ilent for &s;ome moments. I felt reliev|ed in having unburthened my&s;elf to him, and &s;aw no rea&s;on he could oppo&s;e to my union, yet he appealed to my principles.</P>
<P>"You love Emily?"</P>
<P>"I do, Sir; nor can I blame my&s;elf for adoring an object that in&s;pires me with virtues. Yes, my father! &s;he hangs upon my memory, and vice can offer no temptation where her image is &s;een. I am
<PB N="128" REF="029933_0131_0FE357172F284BD0">
ennobled by love, and will not &s;ink unworthy of my Emily's perfection."</P>
<P>"You &s;ee before you, my dear Henry, in your unfortunate father, an example of &s;elfi&s;h and un|generous pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Ungenerous, Sir!"&mdash;</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t not interrupt me: ungenerous and unju&s;t: I &s;tudied my own happine&s;s, without con|&s;idering the mi&s;eries I was preparing for another. I timely felt my arm too feeble to ward off the &s;hafts my fate was preparing for an innocent ob|ject; yet, like you, I loved; pur&s;ued that love; won a valuable heart to my &s;entiments, and wed|ded it only to angui&s;h: need I &s;ay that your de&s;tiny is equally uncertain? What can you do for Emi|ly! How will you &s;hield her from the &s;torm now impending over your head and mine? Will you not rather render her wretched, by alluring her from a fond father, who deems her his riche&s;t ble&s;&s;ing; and who, without her, may &s;ink com|fortle&s;s into the vale of time?&mdash;But, far be it from me to aggravate our mutual woes&mdash;If Emily loves you, brave all future accidents, and lead her to the altar."</P>
<P>My father waited my reply&mdash;I had none to make; the e&s;&s;ential part was wanting. I was a &s;tranger to the &s;entiments of Emily.&mdash;He wi&s;hed me &s;elf-compo&s;ure; and left to my judgment the picture of his experience, faithfully delineated. How warmly had I painted the hours in per&s;pec|tive! My colouring was too high.</P>

<P>MY Guardian returned with his lovely daugh|ter. I &s;aw them pa&s;s through the court, but &s;ought them not. Hope was extingui&s;hed; I pau&s;ed in &s;ilence on the future; mi&s;ery alone was &s;een. Where could I find an a&s;ylum for afflicted beauty? How defend a wife!&mdash;Filial piety here forbad my indulgence of &s;oft ideas. My exiled Father, my lo&s;t Mother, claimed my exertion, and I re&s;olved to ri&s;e &s;uperior to the dear delirium. "Can I &s;ee him depart alone," &s;aid I, looking wildly at the horizon; "can I lie dreaming of unutterable worlds in the eyes of Emily, whil&s;t he is roving joyle&s;s round the earth? No, I will imitate his virtue, and &s;hare his fate."</P>
<P>Full of my purpo&s;e, I rang for my dinner to be brought into my &s;tudy, and &s;ent back a line by the &s;ervant, in which I reque&s;ted my father to ha&s;ten our departure on the morrow.</P>
<P>"All is now concluded," I exclaimed, with a &s;igh. "Woman, fa&s;cinating woman, &s;hall en&s;lave me no more! I will hurry from the indolence with which &s;he impregnates the very air around

her, and the &s;ounds of war &s;hall awaken me to energy. Yes! I will go to the Duke of B****, and, unknown to my father, will implore his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in a&s;&s;erting our privileges of &s;haring, at lea&s;t, the common freedom of mankind. Mu&s;t we for ever behold the &s;word of Death held over us, merely be|cau&s;e we are the relatives of a King! May we not breathe with liberty? Execrable &s;tate! My father &s;hall be happy! Unerring Mover of eternal life! do thou &s;o direct my youthful ardour as to make it pro|pitious to his clouded fortune: give me war and death, but &s;uffer the gentle rays of peace to fall on his hours!"</P>
<P>Thus, indulging alternately the luxury of rea|ding, and of thought, I remained in my &s;tudy till the approach of evening, when I &s;aw Emily &s;tray|ing negligently down the terrace-walk, towards the opening of the plea&s;ure garden. She &s;ometimes &s;tooped to &s;mell the hyacinth as it grew, and &s;tood meditating on the ro&s;e without plucking it; as &s;he loo&s;ed the beauteous bud from her hold, it &s;eemed to fly back to its parent-branches, as if con&s;cious of the death it had e&s;caped, and plea&s;ed in remaining a little longer in the fragrant family. Again I &s;aw her he&s;itate, with her hands folded, and her head reclined on one &s;houlder, to gaze on the jonquils which had been gathered at noon, and now lay dying, neglected, on the turf. Her white &s;carf waved on the officious wind as &s;he turned the corner of the grove which &s;ecluded her from my &s;ight. My eyes remained for a moment fixed to the point
<PB N="5" REF="029933_0135_0FE3572ACB4FF348">
from whence &s;he had di&s;appeared. What had I now to do in my &s;tudy; My re&s;olves were formed: I had offered up the deare&s;t wi&s;hes of my &s;oul at the altar of my duty; it could be no crime to bid Emily a long farewel&mdash;No! No! My heart was too hone&s;t, and hone&s;tly did it ever obey the feelings of Nature, when tho&s;e feelings were in uni&s;on with the plea&s;ant duties it owed to my fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>I tripped lightly down the &s;tairs, ha&s;tened through the hall, whi&s;pered an adieu to every well known tree, and threw a parting look on each va|riegated blo&s;&s;om.</P>
<P>"Tomorrow," &s;aid I, with a &s;igh, (as I touched a carnation Emily had planted,) "To morrow I leave thee, tender flower. Maye&s;t thou long be cheri&s;hed by the hand that placed thee here, whil&s;t I am becoming roughly inured to &s;avage valour, and a foe to peace!&mdash;Ah! what a contra&s;t! Thou art not capable of de&s;troying, thou art not MAN!"</P>
<P>As I ca&s;t a lingering eye athwart the embroidered parterre, memory ran back to the moment when Emily brought the bouquette, with this innocent apology: 'They mu&s;t <HI>once</HI> die, and why not die with you?'</P>
<P>Dear Emily, "(replied my bu&s;y thought) "Henry mu&s;t die! and why not die with you?"</P>
<P>Rapt with my own ideas, I fancied the Carnation began to &s;hut her richly-tinted beauties.&mdash;"Thou art no niggard, &s;weet flower! Thou ha&s;t a right to mourn, while thy beloved &s;un is &s;tealing to his

<P>Bounteous Creator! Are not all thy tribes in harmony? can Nature vary from her&s;elf? Is &s;he not glowing with univer&s;al love? Are not the minutiae of things eternally moving in her behalf?

<P>Under this kind of rea&s;oning, and full of que&s;|tions, for which I required an&s;wers from &s;ome pow|er &s;tronger than my&s;elf, could my emotions be enough regulated to play with &s;afety round my judgment, while in the pre&s;ence of Emily?

Flowers, and leaves of various kinds formed her only external &s;hields from &s;o ardent a lover; but had &s;he not in|vincible innocence?</P>
<P>Often did I murmur at the &s;hrubbery, who&s;e green trappings waved them&s;elves &s;o bu&s;ily as to conceal her &s;peaking eyes; but as the moments were deli|cious ones, I waited happily the denouement.</P>

<P>"Cruel and unju&s;t are you to your&s;elf and me! Was it po&s;&s;ible you could &s;o lately breathe the name of Henry! could you &s;o tenderly &s;ing of love, while your heart was a &s;tranger to the &s;acred flame?&mdash; You accu&s;e me of ambition to throw me from you."</P>

I left them with reluctance, and beheld them no more.</P>
<P>We rode for &s;ome hours over the wa&s;te; frequent intervals of &s;ilence, he&s;itations, and broken di&s;|cour&s;es, employed us gradually, while trees flocks, vallies, and hills flew behind like emblems of pa&s;&s;ing life.</P>

<P>Lightning, hail, and wind raged &s;uddenly through the fore&s;t: earth caught a momentary ra|diance from the electric matter that darted a|thwart her bo&s;om, while the unbending oak ap|peared as an emblem of un&s;haken fortitude.

<P>In our journey through the fore&s;t, we had di&s;cerned but one little cabin; it was formed of branches of trees, which, being hewn into an equal thickne&s;s, were laid on each other, and plai&s;tered with clay.

How few were the hours of comfort allotted this poor miner! Here we could not &s;helter; but he informed us that a hou&s;e &s;tood, within a mile, in the track towards the old church.

Near the wicker gate &s;tood three cows feeding on dry leaves and hay, mixed with furze, while eleven &s;heep &s;tood, with their lambs at the door of the fold, waiting to be taken in from the beating of the pitile&s;s &s;torm.

<P>We laid him on a mattre&s;s, dried the bloody &s;tream that had mingled it&s;elf with his long hair, and wait|ed with the &s;ilent hope of his &s;oon becoming reani|mated.

<P>After much deliberation, it was re&s;olved, at Emily's reque&s;t, &s;he &s;hould return to her convent: my Father and my&s;elf, in &s;pite of every remon|&s;trance, determined to &s;ee her &s;afe within the &s;acred walls, and to turn acro&s;s the country by a diffe|rent track from that we had at fir&s;t cho&s;en.

We at la&s;t bad poor Nannelle farewell; we had brought &s;orrow to her humble dwelling, but could not take it away: deploring our want of power to repair her ills, we departed and left her to weep.</P>
<P>Oppre&s;&s;ion hangs on woman. Cu&s;tom and law re&s;pecting her, are through the world unju&s;t: Man forms a &s;uperiority on the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of vice; the laws he makes &s;upport him; and he in&s;ults, with impunity, the more delicate &s;ex. Where can woman find a friend? Endued with tenderne&s;s, &s;he often needs &s;upport, but &s;hould her afflicted &s;pirit turn to man, &s;he is undone; he is by nature fal&s;e, and cu&s;|tom makes him cruel; there is but one avenging effect in thus en&s;laving the female mind, which is,
<PB N="52" REF="029933_0182_0FE3627F2A2594D0">
that along the path of time we &s;hall not meet one &s;uitable companion. We are &s;hort-&s;ighted, &s;ullen and re&s;tle&s;s; women, helple&s;s and tender.</P>
<P>Reflections of this kind naturally prevailed in my mind, till we had lo&s;t &s;ight of that late peaceful ha|bitation, where almighty Love might now mourn his victims. As I rode behind the carriage, which held the trea&s;ure of my &s;oul, I endeavoured to calm my bu&s;y memory, and to forget the irretrievable mi&s;eries of the night, in the more plea&s;ing images of my youthful progre&s;s, and the delicate gradations of my infant pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ight of Emily, her attention to my aged Mayo, the bouquette, her well-adapted &s;ong, every little incident came back to form a picture: and at this moment, it in&s;tantly occurred that the Hu&s;|bandman I had met in my Guardian's park was the Father of Anna.&mdash;Haple&s;s Father! Thou &s;halt no more behold the ble&s;&s;ing of thy age! but&mdash;thou &s;halt follow her.</P>
<P>Not caring to indulge this &s;eeming coincidence of circum&s;tance, I tried to whi&s;tle a lively air, as we rode on through the fore&s;t&mdash;It would not do; I became in&s;en&s;ibly mute, for my very &s;oul was un|&s;trung.

The pure had thanked their Creator: the children of guilt had blu&s;hingly &s;tole from her &s;nares, when one of our attendants alighted, rang the great bell of the convent, and Emily was announced. The &s;elf-deny|ing Abbe&s;s appeared, and with her many of the lay

&s;i&s;ters who were the friends of Emily, and who&s;e eyes, I ob&s;erved, &s;pite of my unalterable love, &s;hone with &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure on our goodly company. Why &s;hould they not? my Father was a hand&s;ome man, little more than forty, his form, modelled by the line of beauty; his complexion glowing with her full tints; his large eyes were of melting blue, their fringed curtains a dark-brown, and the animation him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, imperceptibly and &s;uddenly &s;truck tho&s;e who beheld him. My Guardian was full of manly grace, a little older than my Father; his countenance &s;hining with the &s;mile of philanthropy, his whole manner expre&s;&s;ive of the mildne&s;s of virtue. Our attendants were gay, men of vivacity and unmeaning as vivacity generally is; for your humble &s;ervant Henry&mdash;but I care not what Henry is&mdash;this &s;ly Cordelier&mdash;&s;o ble&s;t&mdash;&s;o beloved&mdash;&s;o appointed&mdash;Whither am I going, the&s;e ravings &s;erve me not!&mdash;On a group &s;o inviting could an harmle&s;s maid gaze with aught but delight? &mdash;No&mdash;Cynics may rail, corrupted prudes con|demn, and the old murmuring vi&s;ionary lay down his icy rule. Their labours amount to nothing. Generous Nature dips the &s;punge, and Sympathy wipes out the precepts of cowardly Re&s;erve. True; the blaze of &s;oul was on tho&s;e innocent girls unu&s;u|ally momentary, for here was Nature expiring in the gra&s;p of Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>The Abbe&s;s, from who&s;e cheek in&s;ulted Nature had long withdrawn her ro&s;y hue, deigned, un&s;mi|lingly, to direct us to a hou&s;e on the &s;outh &s;ide of the

Around the window-ca&s;ements, wandered the &s;olitary ja&s;mine hiding as much lead as gla&s;s; up the dark coloured wall crept the ivy, and over the arched door &s;tood the &s;tone figure of a &s;aint; not cut with awe-in&s;pi|ring workman&s;hip to deceive us into veneration, like that in which our cold and ancient patriarchs are im|mortalized&punc; but in health, &s;trength, beauty and comeline&s;s; like the young friar, who left the hou&s;e on our entering it, and who, I was told by the por|ter, often confe&s;&s;ed the good Lady Abbe&s;s. Re|&s;olving not to gue&s;s at any thing, but to take things as they came, I &s;at down. My Father and my Guar|dian walked round the apartment, which was &s;pa|cious, admired the paintings of the canonized, and read the in&s;criptions of the Popes and the Nuns.

<P>The painted ceiling attracted may attention; it was <HI>meant</HI> to be decorated by a winter &s;cene, in which no beauteous bud was &s;een to blow. From the ea&s;t, the effulgent god, peeping above the ho|rizon, &s;trove to throw a ray of genial warmth on the &s;now-drop that early gilded the vale, and &s;eem|ed to await his coming; while Winter from the north, &s;ent forth a torpid breathing; and the &s;now|drop, at his bla&s;t, &s;hut up her beauteous bo&s;om. From tho&s;e devices, &s;o natural to the latitude into which we had entered, my attention was arre&s;ted by the &s;low-paced Lady Abbe&s;s, who came accompanied by a lady to whom Emily ran and expre&s;&s;ed her &s;incere &s;atisfaction at their meeting. My Father too, without the lea&s;t apology, or even a love-&s;ick exclamation, &s;tarted from his place, over-turned the little carved table that &s;tood before him, ran again&s;t me, threw me upon the floor; and there I quietly &s;at gazing, and endeavouring to account for my Father's vigo|rous exertion.</P>
<P>If he &s;hould &s;alute the immaculate Lady Abbe&s;s, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, we are all undone! But my fear was changed into a&s;toni&s;hment, when I &s;aw him cla&s;p the Lady in his arms, who had entered with her, and imprint on her lips the &s;alutation of love. My eyes, in&s;tinctively I believe, rai&s;ed them&s;elves towards Emily, who was that moment gazing on me.</P>

<P><PB N="56" REF="029933_0186_0FE36293CECC8B30">It was too much!&mdash;the heart cannot long bear the forcible beam of an enraptured eye; and Emily in|&s;tantly affected to admire the antique roof, where Winter was repre&s;ented as bla&s;ting the opening year.</P>
<P>"May thy youth know a happier &s;pring! dear maid!" &s;aid I, ri&s;ing from the floor with apparent compo&s;ure. By this time I fancied my Father might have whi&s;pered his bu&s;ine&s;s in the Lady's ear, who, without waiting my advances, threw her arms round me, and &s;unk on my bo&s;om&mdash;</P>
<P>'MY SON!'&mdash;was all &s;he could articulate, in a voice that made me &s;hiver. Rapture &s;uch as angels might feel, ab&s;orbed my whole &s;oul. No language could embody my ideas. I &s;upported my Mother, looked at my Father&mdash;He was &s;ilent, but the big tear of affection rolled down his face.</P>
<P>'My Hu&s;band! my Son! my Henry! Oh what an age is gone, what hours have I known&mdash;but I have found you!&mdash;found you both! we will never more be &s;eparated.'</P>

<P>'I will! I will, my love!, exclaimed my Fa|ther, 'one de&s;tiny &s;urely awaits us, or indulgent heaven would not have given you &s;o unexpectedly to me.'</P>

<P>'What re&s;olves?' replied my Mother, ca&s;ting

<P>'And what good did you promi&s;e your&s;elf, had your labour &s;ucceeded?' replied my Father laconi|cally.</P>
<P>'The greate&s;t good, Sir: that of teaching her &s;oul to win its way to heaven. In &s;hort, that of breaking all &s;ocial ties?'</P>
<P>'Yes&mdash;and of mi&s;taking the grand beauties of order for the burning phantoms of imagination.'</P>

<P>'A&s;k your con&s;cience?'</P>
<P>The tone with which this &s;entence was pronounced, proved that the Abbe&s;s fancied &s;he had gained a point. 'Yes, Madam,' &s;he repeated with a trium|phant &s;mile, 'a&s;k your con&s;cience!'&mdash;</P>

<P>My mother waited the re&s;ult of this harangue, made by my Father in a peremptory manner. The Abbe&s;s was offended&mdash;he perceived it and led her into an adjoining apartment. None of us, I believe, were quite ea&s;y under this &s;hort &s;u&s;pence. We knew &s;uper&s;tition here wore every pontifical terror, and that we had nothing in the world about us but poor rea&s;on. After &s;ome delay, we were, however re|lea&s;ed. For the lately-jarring couple returned to us much better plea&s;ed with each other.

<P>This was not a time for any of us to be inqui&s;itive; it was enough for my affectionate parents that once more they were reciprocally ble&s;&s;ed; and the hi&s;to|ry of their long &s;eparation was mutually re&s;erved for happier hours. My Mother, however, took an opportunity to inform us that &s;he was not known in the convent; that &s;uch precaution had been taken to &s;ave the appearance of force in her &s;eclu&s;ion, none &s;uppo&s;ed but that &s;he came in voluntarily, and all expected &s;he was to take the veil.</P>

<P>Emily had been plea&s;ingly occupied in receiving the congratulation of her friends in the convent; &s;he returned to give us her good night.

pre&s;&s;ure; my breath grew &s;hort, and &s;uffocation began to arre&s;t the current of life! Agony, I be|lieve, is &s;tronger for being &s;udden: even the pains of death become comparatively weak by a long and &s;low gradation: I was young, healthful and had known no wa&s;te of &s;trength. My powers of mind or body had received no &s;hock; and Nature now was ardent in her exertions to avoid di&s;&s;olution. For|cible in my &s;truggling, I by &s;ome means relieved my throat, and could indi&s;tinctly hear human wi&s;|pers; I attempted to &s;peak, and my mouth was immediately gagged, whil&s;t a hoar&s;e voice comman|ded me to 'be pa&s;&s;ive, for my doom was fixed.' A bandage was tied over my eyes, a covering belon|ging to the bed clo&s;ely girted round me, and I was by force conveyed, with horrid &s;ilence, to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arriage.

<P>The carriage, to the bottom of which I was bound for &s;ome hours, went furiou&s;ly on. From its unea|&s;y motion, and the jingle of chains, I &s;uppo&s;ed it to be a kind of cart or waggon; the trampling of many

hor&s;es accompanied it, and the voices of many men kept a continual jargon, the &s;en&s;e of which I did not under&s;tand, becau&s;e my hearing was not &s;uffici|ently clear.

How tediou&s;ly did the hours &s;eem to creep, whil&s;t I lay burning with indignation, and endea|vouring to de&s;pi&s;e death! Sometimes I heard the wheels ru&s;h again&s;t the hedges, in pa&s;&s;ing, as I &s;up|po&s;ed, through narrow lanes; again they would plunge into deep ruts, made apt for impre&s;&s;ion by the late rains; and the recovering jolt always made me &s;en&s;ible of the vehicle's coming out; at other moments the hor&s;es &s;eemed &s;lowly to labour through lengthened mar&s;hes, the heavy mire of which &s;o enfeebled and retarded tho&s;e noble animals, that the la&s;hes of their cruel ma&s;ters lo&s;t their effect.&mdash; During this di&s;mal day, the longe&s;t I thought I had ever known, no refre&s;hment was offered me&mdash;I real|ly began to think my&s;elf forgotten, even by my enemies.

His ideas take no &s;hape, or the formation he tries at &s;wiftly dies. Millions of chimeras floated on my imagina|tion; all were rejected in &s;peedy &s;ucce&s;&s;ion ere they became old enough to take the colour of rea&s;on; yet fancy will be bu&s;y till we are no more.</P>

<P>This dialogue ended;&mdash;as their voices died away, I could di&s;tinctly hear the roaring of the &s;ea. Death throws horror on the imagination of man, from tho&s;e lifele&s;s forms he hourly beholds; the flitting breath departed, our lately &s;miling friends an&s;wer not to our lamentations, heed not our &s;ighs, nor wipe away our tears. It is this eternal in&s;en&s;ibility which pervades the dead&mdash;that &s;hocks our mortal affections, and we tremble at the idea of &s;inking into the &s;ame &s;tate.

<P>In the &s;ea&s;on of childhood, I had accompanied a lad, who&s;e father was tenant to my Guardian, in a walk on the bank of a river.

<P>Jemmy left me to reflection; I had no worldly riches to bequeath; my ideal form, I believed would long be pre&s;erved by Emily, and I lamented in &s;ympathy with my unhappy parents&mdash;All partial formation mu&s;t di&s;&s;olve, though the great-&s;y&s;tem of

Nature &s;hall eternally renovate. Am I not, in the grave, the undoubted property of God?</P>
<P>Arrived at this height of re&s;ignation, I &s;up|ported a &s;u&s;pen&s;e of three weeks-rolling on the &s;ea. The &s;ight of land at la&s;t was proclaimed by one of the crew; and that night, when all was &s;till, except the watch upon deck, the Captain came to me, accompanied only by Jemmy, and &s;ternly orde|red me to be &s;tripped. Poor Jemmy reluctantly obey|ed, without &s;peaking, but the &s;ilent tear that fell on my cheek as he &s;tooped to unbind me was full of pity.</P>
<P>'Wrap &s;omething round him, and &s;tow him away,' &s;aid the Captain, let none of the crew know where he is while Mon&s;ieur Cregney is on board.'&mdash;</P>
<P>'God ble&s;s you, Sir?' replied Jemmy, in a tran&s;|port of plea&s;ure&mdash;'I was afraid, Sir, you were going to order me to throw him over-board.'</P>
<P>'And what difference to you if I had?&mdash;'</P>
<P>The Captain crept to his cabin: I was directed to lie clo&s;ely behind a large coil of cable, and Jemmy covered me with &s;ome of the &s;ails. My only fear now was of &s;uffocation from foulne&s;s of air; however, my chance of life was much greater than it had been on the ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>There is a pith, in &s;ome men, hard to be got at. It &s;eems to peep upon us like a &s;udden light, and &s;hut up again: The manner in which this Captain conducted him&s;elf was &s;ingular, and there is won|drous energy in natural eccentricity. I wi&s;hed to be acquainted with the mind of this man; but cir|cum&s;tances

would not agree to it.&mdash;We were three days making land, during which Jemmy never brought me any refre&s;hment but at midnight, when our anchor was ca&s;t. I was not relieved for the &s;pace of a week: the happy moment came! Mon&s;ieur Cregney, I was informed, had been &s;hewn the bed-clothes in which I had been bound on the night when forcibly torn from the convent; had received a written certificate of my death, and was gone on &s;hore in order to return to France. With a &s;miling countenance, Jemmy led me to the Captain's cabin; I bowed as I entered, he took me by the hand, his heart &s;welled: but he &s;tubbornly broke the &s;igh in its utterance&mdash;'Cheerily lad!

condition of my laying off-&s;hore to receive you. He told me that the King had given his &s;anction to your death, but that I might make money of you after pa&s;&s;ing the Streights. Mon&s;ieur Cregney, how|ever, has enlarged on my fir&s;t compliance, and &s;hewed me an order for your death.&mdash;Mon&s;ieur Cregney believes you are dead, and is upon return|ing to Mar&s;eilles full of that belief.

<P>To Jemmy I pre&s;ent one hundred of the louis-d'|ors, his civility had attached me to him; he &s;wore they &s;hould all be bundled home to his mother and &s;i&s;ters; and if rough virtue has a charm, I &s;ure|ly might be allowed to part reluctantly from this young man.</P>
<P>Captain Murray as we &s;tood on the &s;hore embra|ced me, and with hone&s;t warmth breathed a farwell. 'The billows of life,' (&s;aid he) 'you &s;ee, mu&s;t be &s;tubbornly braved: we are &s;oon wrecked in a crazy bottom: A <HI>good</HI> heart is the be&s;t pilot in a &s;torm; and if Mon&s;ieur Cregney has a heart like mine, he may call on Heaven for its care. If he has not, may he never find &s;ounding even in harbour! &mdash;I may never meet you more!&mdash;but, were you to &s;ee me &s;inking, I know you would venture far to hold up Captain Murray.&mdash;'</P>
<P>His heart heaved&mdash;he &s;hook me by the hand, pre&s;&s;ed it between his own; and after looking in my face &s;ilently for a moment, broke away, &s;ay|ing&mdash;'God ble&s;s you!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="029933_0212_0FE36311A4E35C00">Captain Murray was older than me; he knew more of the world; and of the moments of &s;epa|ration. &mdash;I &s;taggered &s;peechle&s;s as he left me, fol|lowed him with my eyes. He looked back and waved his handkerchief towards an adjacent inn, wiped his cheek, and went on board.&mdash;I never &s;aw him &s;ince.</P>
<P>And now was I left to look around me; no friend to whom I could unbo&s;om my cares, though my heart was heavy. I however &s;oon collected my &s;cattered ideas; and, by the &s;trength of my judg|ment, forced them to obey collateral circum&s;tance. To the inn I withdrew, &s;at my&s;elf down in a private room, and &s;trove to meditate on future plans. The mo&s;t plea&s;ing re&s;olve I could form, was to return to France and &s;eek tho&s;e objects from whom I had been torn. I might go back&mdash;I could not look for|ward to happine&s;s. Captain Murray had, on my being relea&s;ed from confinement, ordered me to be cloathed in one of his &s;uits, con&s;i&s;ting of a fine cotton &s;hirt, red jacket, and white callico trow&s;ers; &s;o di&s;intere&s;ted was this benevolent tar! I could of|fer him nothing&mdash;he had given me all. The only return I made was a note, which I unob&s;erved &s;lip|ped into his pocket, informing him of my name, quality and connections. I did not this from mo|tives of de&s;picable vanity, but I thought if ever we met again I might claim his friend&s;hip from that rich &s;ource of obligation he opened on my grateful &s;oul. At the inn, I enquired for a ve&s;&s;el bound for France, and was informed that an American brig was then
<PB N="83" REF="029933_0213_0FE363171F8EA8B8">
waiting for freight and pa&s;&s;engers, and that her Captain lived in the &s;treet of Saint Dennis, which was but a third &s;treet from the inn. I made no de|lay; ha&s;tened to the hou&s;e, met with the Captain, and agreed to lodge with him till his ve&s;&s;el &s;hould &s;ail. Thus did Heaven &s;eem once more propitious to my fortunes. In reading, writing and diverting my&s;elf with the Captain's family (which con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;en&s;ible mother and three lovely girls) I pa&s;&s;ed my hours. Dome&s;tic peace was here&mdash;placid manner, chearfulne&s;s flowing from a &s;elf-corrected mind, and a continued equanimity of temper in this charm|ing wife, taught her hu&s;band to adore her and made her children a&s;hamed of imperfection. Such happine&s;s, &s;aid I with a &s;igh, would Emily have diffu&s;ed around her!&mdash;Sometimes I would &s;troll down to the ve&s;&s;el, throw my eyes over the &s;ea, and chide the contrary winds: it was to no purpo&s;e; I could not command circum&s;tances to obey my will. The Wedne&s;day following was at la&s;t fixed on for the day of our departure, and the tedious hours had rolled on to the evening preceding that day, when I &s;upped with the Captain in his cabin, toa&s;ted my dear girl, and drank a little too much. I felt not the effect of my conviviality till I came on &s;hore, and had advanced a con&s;iderable way towards home; the hou&s;es were &s;hut up; not an object to be &s;een, and the &s;ilence of the night cau&s;ed me to quicken my &s;tep which was &s;oon arre&s;ted by a young female, who very freely took hold of my arm&mdash;'Venez avec moi,' &s;aid &s;he&mdash;and in a moment forgot the

I looked in her face&mdash; &s;he was beautiful.&mdash;"Take this, and return to vir|tue," &s;aid I&mdash;giving her a con&s;iderable &s;hare of my louis-d'ors, which I took loo&s;ely from my pocket, and throwing her from my arms.&mdash;She &s;tood as if lo&s;t in gratitude, and I went on, &s;omewhat proud of my &s;uperior excellence.</P>
<P>"What are the grand ble&s;&s;ings of life?" &s;aid I to my&s;elf&mdash;"Love and &s;ocial virtue, to be &s;ure.&mdash;" an&s;wering my own que&s;tion with much confidence.</P>

but without attendants, that I might li&s;ten &s;ilently and unnoticed to the opinions of the nation. Whil&s;t I remained with my Guardian, which was only a &s;hort time, I ob&s;erved a deep and deadly melancholy growing on his mind. Such melancholy, I am con|vinced, often &s;ettles into black de&s;pair, which the poor &s;ufferer, &s;elf-deceived, would willingly pro|nounce re&s;ignation. I tried to comfort him, and he &s;trove to appear &s;en&s;ible of my attention.</P>
<P>Alas! we knew but too well the &s;ituation of each other's heart; and in endeavouring to di&s;gui&s;e, we revealed our reciprocal angui&s;h. Unable to &s;upport this mental conflict, I promi&s;ed to write, and tore my&s;elf away.</P>
<P>Neatly dre&s;&s;ed, but unattended, I repaired to eve|ry public place; &s;trolled into every hou&s;e of fa|&s;hionable re&s;ort, mixed with people of every de|&s;cription, and found national di&s;content gnawing at the root of national &s;plendor.</P>
<P>Cardinal Mazarine was dead &s;ince the year 1661; Turenne died in 1678, and the Calvini&s;ts, left by the cruel exce&s;&s;es of the King's &s;oldiery to &s;ecret cabals and feeble murmurs, quitted the kingdom in va&s;t numbers. With the&s;e I was &s;ometimes &s;een, hoping to hear of my per&s;ecuted Father, but find|ing that hope vain, &s;ought the friend&s;hip of the Marquis Louvois, who &s;tood in high favour with the King. Louvois I found intrepid; every &s;pecies of boldne&s;s &s;unk beneath his daring &s;pirit; and his will, &s;upported by his cunning, &s;eemed ab&s;o|lutely to command &s;ucce&s;s. From this man I might
<PB N="93" REF="029933_0223_0FE363456480D558">
have learned much; the &s;prings of political intrigue were coerced in his hand, like the fa&s;ces in the hand of the Roman; but my whole &s;oul revolted &s;ecretly from his in&s;tructions. As a &s;tranger he at fir&s;t politely conver&s;ed with me on common to|pics&mdash;On further intimacy he revealed a part of his plans. I had no right to betray his confidence, but finding him the acting-in&s;trument of court-de&s;ign, I had fully re&s;olved to quit his &s;ociety for ever, and travel on in &s;earch of objects more dear to my &s;ick and langui&s;hing mind. He, however, had the fa&s;cinating addre&s;s to per&s;uade me to ac|company him to this i&s;land. Innocent plea&s;ures, he &s;aid, were his only pur&s;uit; having obtained leave of his &s;overeign to ab&s;ent him&s;elf on account of the weak &s;tate of his health. Horrible delu&s;ion! Here was I arre&s;ted by his command; and here I expect &s;oon to die. The fate of my friend, the Marquis, who re&s;cued me at Carthagena, the groans and complainings I hear every hour within this dreadful pri&s;on; the picture of my unfortunate Mother, and the depraved heart of Dormoud, leave me little hope of prolonged exi&s;tence; while I live, from time to time I will continue my &s;tory.

<P>NIGHT came on, when gazing through the grate of an adjoining apartment, I &s;aw a genteel woman at her devotions; ab&s;orbed by &s;trong curio|&s;ity, I li&s;tened to her &s;ublime &s;upplications, and fancied her voice had, in &s;ome former period, &s;truck on my ear. I could not behold her features; &s;he wore a deep veil; but my &s;oul was borne with hers to the Father of Mercy. The voices of tho&s;e guards who were appointed to go their la&s;t round for the night, broke our heavenly enchantment. The Lady, I could di&s;cern, appeared for a moment ex|tremely di&s;compo&s;ed; &s;tarted from her kneeling po&s;ture, and turned towards the door, as if expect|ing the entrance of the &s;oldiers. But they turned along through another pa&s;&s;age; when &s;he &s;at down, and, leaning on her hand, &s;ighed for re&s;ignation, I prayed &s;he might attain it, and &s;tole from the grate. As I laid my&s;elf on the pillow, my &s;orrow|ful &s;pirit whi&s;pered, <HI>Is &s;he not my Mother?</HI> O how time &s;eems to creep when we load him with &s;u&s;|pence!

ru&s;hed on my mind, agitations of wild nature &s;hook me&mdash;What can I do for her? Dare I own her? May not our dear relation&s;hip cau&s;e her de&s;truction? Can I cla&s;p her to my heart, and in the language of filial love bid her be comforted? Can I for my mother, throw wide the door of liberty,&mdash;O! no! we meet but to die! We meet but to &s;ay how wretched we have lived, and how joyle&s;s we leave a Hu&s;band and a Father.

<P>Wearied at la&s;t by the violence of my emotions, I yielded in&s;en&s;ibly to repo&s;e; and dawn, like an eye in the ea&s;t, had &s;carcely got above its horizon, when Dormoud appeared at the &s;ide of my bed. I had no time to gue&s;s at the purpo&s;e of his vi&s;it. He &s;at down, told me, with his u&s;ual carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, that he was grown too impatient, on account of a pretty woman, to &s;leep late in a morning, and that my a&s;&s;i&s;tance might &s;erve him much.</P>
<P>'Come ri&s;e, and breakfa&s;t with me; our Corde|lier, who is become a plea&s;ant fellow, &s;ince he has gotten the better of the death of the Marquis, will join us. He is to confe&s;s the idol of my &s;oul this morning. I have commanded him to put in a word for me, but I &s;hall hope more from your negociation as a young clever fellow, than from him as a dull, moralizing hypocrite&mdash;allons.'&mdash;This man was as old as my Father.</P>
<P>Am I then become an in&s;trument of vice! Is it po&s;&s;ible for Henry, for <HI>that Henry</HI> once &s;o beloved by the pure&s;t &s;pirit in nature, to &s;educe woman!&mdash;

Yes&mdash;<HI>Emily</HI> is fallen&mdash;why may not <HI>I</HI> give a loo&s;e to wild de&s;ire&mdash;to ba&s;ene&s;s&mdash;to the la&s;t profligacy man can know&mdash;which is that of abetting the hap|pine&s;s of a villain. Woman! woman! what art thou? Enchanting, lovely, faithle&s;s creature!&mdash; Why did&s;t thou beguile me? why cheat me of my youthful hours?&mdash;Ah Emily!&mdash;</P>
<P>Perdition, at this moment, could afford no hor|rors for me.&mdash;I was tired of being virtuous&mdash;I was tired of love.</P>
<P>After much delay and many &s;truggles, I left my chamber, filled with &s;hame. This was to be the day, the fatal day on which I was to be initiated in the my&s;teries of vice&mdash;for Heaven is my witne&s;s, there had not been a deed in the record of my youth which could &s;tamp me a villain, or &s;ting me with repentance. I pau&s;ed on the &s;tair-ca&s;e; re|flected on the female captive&mdash;and, falling again&s;t the wall, with my arms folded acro&s;s my bo&s;om, began &s;eriou&s;ly to think of death; and to weigh the la&s;t pang of nature again&s;t the degrading drudgery of life.&mdash;"<HI>Should it be my Mother!</HI>"</P>
<P>I &s;tarted, and ran down &s;tairs&mdash;The image of my Mother &s;till touched my brain&mdash;I could not dive&s;t my&s;elf of the idea, and ha&s;tened precipitately to the grate, where I had fir&s;t beheld the Lady at her de|votions&mdash;"<HI>&s;hould it be my Mother!</HI>" I again ex|claimed, half breathle&s;s, with terror.&mdash;I will kill Dormoud, by Heaven!</P>
<P>This la&s;t re&s;olve gave a &s;udden compo&s;ure to my late-troubled &s;pirit. I &s;lackened my pace, and
<PB N="97" REF="029933_0227_0FE363C813CF3290">
went gently on tip-toe as I approached the grate. A little black curtain had been let down from the top of the window; but time, and its u&s;efulne&s;s, had much worn the texture of it. One divi&s;ion, in particular, offered me a &s;ight of the charming cap|tive, who&s;e re&s;ignation had endeared her to me&mdash; I put my face down, looked through the curtain and &s;aw her&mdash;not at prayer, but fainting on the bo&s;om of the Cordelier.&mdash;No!&mdash;<HI>It is not my Mo|ther!</HI></P>
<P>Joy, at lea&s;t a kind of ridiculous and exulting mirth, &s;ucceeded my complainings. I not only was convinced that the Lady was no relation of mine, but I was convinced had a better protector than my&s;elf, and that &s;he could tru&s;t much with this holy comforter.</P>
<P>"The Devil may run with this Cordelier," (&s;aid I to my&s;elf) "&s;urely he does what plea&s;es him with the heart of woman! I am glad however, the lady is not my Mother; &s;he would recline on no bo&s;om but that of her hu&s;band, or her &s;on!"</P>
<P>Thus I reflected&mdash;but of what &s;ervice could be my conjectures? I knew not whether this was the lady meant by Dormoud. She was &s;till veiled, and if I could have &s;een her face I was not in a humour to be in love with it; therefore, leaving the Cordelier to fulfil his heavenly office, I went very &s;edately to breakfa&s;t with Dormoud.</P>
<P>The gaiety this man diffu&s;ed around him, lulled every care&mdash;his manner &s;o fa&s;cinated the human mind.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="029933_0228_0FE363537385B280">"Could I di&s;cern virtue through thy native em|belli&s;hments, what a rare piece of workman&s;hip would&s;t thou be!"&mdash;This &s;oliloquy was only whi&s;pered from my heart, as I &s;at conver&s;ing with him.</P>
<P>'When I informed you, that my happine&s;s could be promoted by your a&s;&s;i&s;tance,' &s;aid he, 'I meant you &s;hould prove my negociator with a per|ver&s;e beauty, who is here impri&s;oned only becau&s;e I love&mdash;her &s;oul never entertained a crime! By my contrivance &s;he is here, and here &s;he &s;hall make me happy&mdash;and yet&mdash;when I approach her, Sir, my de&s;ires are cha&s;tened by her un&s;ullied innocence&mdash; I am awed&mdash;&s;he awakens me to a &s;en&s;e of the purity I have lo&s;t; and I leave her, enraged at my own weakne&s;s.'</P>
<P>For my own part, I had no grand idea of the lady's un&s;ullied innocence; for I &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected her to be identically the &s;ame lady who was then confe&s;&s;ing to the Cordelier. True, I had &s;een no|thing incompatible with delicacy, unle&s;s the mo&s;t &s;orrowful tenderne&s;s could be deemed &s;o; but I had &s;een enough to convince me the lady was not in|vulnerable. Dormoud re&s;umed&mdash;</P>
<P>'Till now, as woman varied, varied were my plea&s;ures.&mdash;The vain coquette invited my advances, and trifled with my heart; but, when &s;he thought her&s;elf &s;ecure, I bur&s;t the web of her feigned-indif|ference, added warmth to her &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions, till &s;he di&s;&s;olved in the flame &s;he affected to kindle a|lone for me. My vengeance was ju&s;t; her memory

obtruded, and Dormoud was gone.&mdash;The ambitious beauty, who unportioned, &s;tood up for high marri|age &s;ettlements, held her willing neck to receive my golden fetters. She appealed not to my heart, I de&s;pi&s;ed hers; vi&s;ions of &s;plendor dazzled; I con|tinually waved them before her &s;en&s;es. In&s;en&s;ible to love, &s;he &s;acrificed all to pride, and broke her own enchantment. I left her to weep, but hers were not the tears of wounded affection&mdash;And now what avails my pa&s;t victories?&mdash;I am en&s;nared by one to who&s;e impenetrable &s;oul I can find no avenue! &mdash;&s;he &s;hall!&mdash;&s;he mu&s;t be mine!'</P>
<P>'If the mind of Dormoud may be reclaimed, this object of his love can only boa&s;t the power! Who knows but &s;he has excellence! If &s;o, her at|tractions, in&s;tead of de&s;cending, may draw this man to the zenith of her perfection."</P>
<P>Rea&s;oning thus within my&s;elf, I &s;ecretly re&s;olved to u&s;e my be&s;t efforts with the lady, and gain upon Dormoud to marry rather than de&s;troy her peace.</P>
<P>"I will plead for you, Sir," &s;aid I, "and may the regard you entertain for the lady, recall you to the path of refinement; a path from which you have been hurried by the impetuo&s;ity of youth. You are accompli&s;hed&mdash;the chain of ignorance hangs not on your mental powers; nor can you eternally a|void the whi&s;pers of virtue.&mdash;"</P>
<P>'Cea&s;e!&mdash;Cea&s;e your admonitions! Far! very far beyond your judgment lye the doings of Dor|moud. I have your faith, you have promi&s;ed

<P>There was a time when &s;uch a threat, from &s;uch a man, would have &s;hook me; the roughe&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of my &s;oul would have taken the alarm, and awoke to vengeance; but&mdash;No!&mdash;all was pa&s;t!&mdash;Self ap|peared to have no influence over my de&s;pairing &s;pi|rit. What had I here to live for, after being pro|nounced a captive for ever!&mdash;I was calm, truly un|di&s;turbed by the menaces of Dormoud; yet to do one kind action for him was to tune his &s;hattered thoughts to peace.</P>
<P>Here is but one ob&s;tacle to my wi&s;hes,' continued he, 'which is her hatred, at lea&s;t it is that torpid in&s;en&s;ibility to which &s;he gives the &s;ofter term of virtue. In hourly danger of death, &s;he braves me with a &s;mile of re&s;ignation; but that re&s;ignation is meant to Heaven alone, her haughty &s;oul de&s;pi&s;es me.'&mdash;</P>
<P>"Marry her&mdash;offer no violation to her will, but lead her to the chamber of pure delight. There will delicacy and tender confidence mingle her &s;oul with yours&mdash;Friend&s;hip, love, every high &s;en|&s;ation that &s;wells the human heart; every fine de|pendance that lo&s;es it&s;elf in uni&s;on, will await you with the woman you adore; and who may love, if once &s;he believes &s;he can love in you the image of excellence."</P>
<P>'Marry her!' replied Dormoud, with a ge&s;ture of abhorrence.&mdash;</P>

<P>"May I talk of marriage?&mdash;"</P>
<P>'D&mdash;n it, Sir, how you teize me!&mdash;Try other allurements&mdash;She mu&s;t be mine.&mdash;'</P>
<P>The entrance of the Cordelier checked, in &s;ome degree, the warmth of Dormoud. In a moment he collected him&s;elf, and enquired after the health of his fair pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>'She does not complain,' &s;aid the Cordelier, 'her &s;oul &s;eems to have mounted above every world|ly care, and every mortal infirmity.'</P>
<P>'That is not the &s;tate of mind I wi&s;h you to en|courage, my good Father! I think &s;he may as well &s;oar to heaven from the pillow of delight, as from a river of tears. It is amazing that you gloomy di&s;ciplinarians will, through every age, make the

<P>'The Cordelier blu&s;hed&mdash;I was in pain for him&mdash; He mildly replied&mdash;</P>
<P>'We only wi&s;h to exalt and purify the mind of man, that he may not de&s;pi&s;e him&s;elf. Man is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of powers which him&s;elf cannot define; all he can do is, to endeavour, through the conveyance of &s;ound, to communicate their workings to his fel|low beings; this conveyance he feels inadequate, and, con&s;equently, turns in upon his mind, if vice alone is &s;een; if the &s;en&s;es are predominant; and, in uproar, tearing him within; you will per|ceive his form early relax, his finer faculties grow dim, and all plea&s;ure that is not gro&s;s will, to him, appear unlovely. On the contrary; if early taught that an univer&s;e can only be &s;een by looking back|ward over the realms of &s;pirit, man grows proud of every new di&s;covery in his intellectual world; he will exult with the hope of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;tate &s;uited to his fine, though invi&s;ible powers, and will no longer de&s;pi&s; him&s;elf,&mdash;'</P>
<P>'Very well, good Father, you are exceedingly eloquent on topics which, I am certain, will give you range enough; and &s;o far am I from endea|vouring to oppo&s;e your pious harangue, that I will do all I can to &s;upport it, and you &s;hall draw the conclu&s;ion&mdash;Your pretty mourner is the univer&s;e to me; and, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her, I will a&s;k nothing more to &s;uit my fine, invi&s;ible powers; and un|til

<P>The mu&s;cles of an anchoret would have unbended at this &s;cene.&mdash;The eyes of Dormoud &s;parkled with gaiety, as they were turned up to the Cordelier, who &s;tood gazing on him like one &s;truck with terror and a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash;the momentary pau&s;e ended in a loud laugh of Dormoud; who, taking the Cor|delier's hand, &s;ympathi&s;ed with him in a merry manner&mdash;'And how, my holy Fried,' &s;aid he, could you &s;o ea&s;ily let go the be&s;t end of the argu|ment!'</P>

<P>Perceiving the heart of this lively libertine in|vulnerable, I wi&s;hed to &s;upport the gentle Corde|lier, and interrupted the conver&s;ation, by &s;aying to Dormoud, "If I may advi&s;e, Sir, you &s;hould re&s;t your cau&s;e with the lady, and tru&s;t to her deci|&s;ion."</P>

<P>On other topics we gave our opinions alternately, till the Cordelier took leave, which he did ha&s;tily, and with looks full of trouble. My eyes followed him; I melted with commi&s;eration, and wi&s;hed Dor|moud had treated him with more reverence, though he had lately avoided me.</P>
<P>When alone with Dormoud, he returned to the &s;ubject his imagination &s;welled with. He wi&s;hed me immediately to vi&s;it the lady, to plead with her in his behalf&mdash;'but,' &s;aid he, 'if you can &s;ucceed with her in no other way, tell her I will&mdash;' Here he made a full pau&s;e.</P>

<P>Endeavouring to appear re&s;pectful, I took my &s;eat with aukwardne&s;s enough, I believe, and incohe|rently claimed the lady's indulgence&mdash;She &s;ighed&mdash; deeply &s;ighed!</P>
<P>I could hear her breath flutter in tremulous pau&s;es; her face I was not permitted to behold.</P>
<P>Surely, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, agitation is &s;ympathetic, or we &s;hould not thus mutually feel di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: po|litene&s;s bids me leave her, that &s;he may conquer this &s;urpri&s;e. Hardly knowing what was be&s;t, I &s;ud|denly aro&s;e to be gone, and, bowing low, found courage at la&s;t to &s;ay, "Pardon me, Madam, I meant not to intrude&mdash;my pre&s;ence oppre&s;&s;es you&mdash;I will, if permitted, wait on you at &s;ome more tranquil moment."</P>

<P>I &s;at down again&mdash;The lady, in &s;pite of her ef|forts to conceal it, was &s;till agitated.</P>
<P>"Politene&s;s, Madam, may, in &s;ome degree, be forgot or neglected, when the mind is &s;tubbornly adhering to the fir&s;t good, fir&s;t perfect, and fir&s;t fair. My vi&s;it, however unexpected, or however painful, may be productive of your liberty and happine&s;s.

<P>'What means this &s;olemn prelude, Sir? my &s;itu|ation from you needs no &s;upport: What have you to do with my virtues? Can you judge me, who am accountable only to heaven? When I complain, do you prove a comforter! If you come to fortify my mind again&s;t the fear of death, know I am pre|pared, and have not lei&s;ure to hear you: none can guide me through the unknown gulf, I mu&s;t depart alone; whil&s;t here my &s;orrows are &s;acred, not one of your &s;ex mu&s;t profane them.'</P>
<P>So, &s;o! here is another farce ri&s;ing (thought I.) This lady po&s;itively will not be &s;aved by any man but the Cordelier. O, woman! thy artful re&s;erve never ends.</P>
<P>I was not in a humour to be over credulous; and as I firmly believed the lady was giving me a ta&s;te of the bu&s;kin, I re&s;olved to bring her up to a cli|max, and proceeded in a &s;olemn tone:</P>

<P>"Your marriage with Dormoud!"</P>
<P>I &s;tarted at my own propo&s;ition&mdash;Dormoud had given me no authority to make it, but my love of virtue, I believe, was impul&s;ive. I felt no de&s;ire my&s;elf of &s;educing this defencele&s;s lady, and for|got, at the moment, they were not my own &s;enti|ments I was &s;ent to deliver.</P>

There may be &s;uch a man, Sir, but with &s;uch a man I &s;hould de&s;erve and ta&s;te di&s;honourable mi&s;ery.

<P>'Well, Sir, if you ever were beloved, I think you mu&s;t hold my opinion.'</P>

<P>Her voice altered from its firmne&s;s, as &s;he put tho&s;e que&s;tions, into a tremulous &s;olemnity, as if &s;he feared my avowal of the charges I advanced, and hoped for my recantation. I was &s;truck with more reverence than I had felt on the commence|ment

No, &s;uch imprudence would have hurried on the &s;troke of fate.

You, I believe, have been conver&s;ant with that haughty part of the &s;ex &s;tyled women of virtue; I only with the weak and willing, and my cheap victories are no longer va|lued. But this glorious conque&s;t was re&s;erved for my riper judgment, and over this fair oppo&s;er I will not &s;eem to triumph, but to yield.'&mdash;</P>
<P>"The lady thinks favourably of you&mdash;I will &s;ee her again, and draw forth, if po&s;&s;ible, her &s;ecret re&s;olves; I am in your power, Sir,&mdash;you may com|mand my &s;ervices."</P>

<P>This was new rea&s;oning, and not very congenial to my wi&s;h for freedom. In truth, I grew hourly more involved, and my embarra&s;&s;ments thickened as I laboured to di&s;engage my&s;elf.</P>
<P>'I have,' (re&s;umed the Governor) 'been invited by the Marquis Louvois to &s;pend a day or two with him; the Deputy Rozinelle, will in my ab&s;ence grant your rea&s;onable requi&s;itions: before I depart gain me an amicable interview with my charming mi&s;tre&s;s, I promi&s;e not to make full u&s;e of it&mdash; Shall it be to-morrow?&mdash;I die to &s;ee her!'</P>
<P>To this hot-headed lover, I &s;aid more than I meant to fulfill, and withdrew.</P>
<P>To hear that the Cordelier came from the Ne|therlands, and recommended by the Abbe Doro|vontes, of whom my Father had &s;poken to me, afforded hope of intelligence; I accordingly re&s;olv|ed to regain his attention and friend&s;hip, e&s;pecially as I meant to re&s;ign Emily for ever; my parents were &s;till dear to me.&mdash;The remembrance of them &s;acred; but when I reflected on Emily, pride, re|venge, jealou&s;y and de&s;pair, tore my bo&s;om with their working * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</P>
