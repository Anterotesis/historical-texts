<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS Upon the <HI>Conduct</HI> and <HI>Behaviour</HI> of a <HI>certain Sect,</HI> u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Name of METHODISTS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P>IT does not appear, that any of the Preachers among the Methodi&s;ts have qualified them&s;elves and the Places of their A&s;&s;embling, ac|cording to the Act of <HI>Toleration</HI>; which Act warrants &s;eparate A&s;&s;emblies for the Wor&s;hip of God, that <HI>before</HI> were <HI>unlawful.</HI></P>
<P>The unbounded Licentiou&s;ne&s;s in holding A&s;&s;emblies for Divine Wor&s;hip, both as to Per&s;ons and Places, which had prevailed for &s;ome Years before the Re&s;toration, and of which our Hi&s;tories are full; was a &s;ufficient Warning to the Legi&s;lature, to have a watchful Eye over that Spirit, which had cau&s;ed &s;o much Confu&s;ion in the Kingdom; and parti|cularly in the publick Wor&s;hip of God. And the Methods taken from Time to Time to keep-under that Spirit, and to prevent and &s;uppre&s;s all &s;uch irregular A&s;&s;emblies, are a plain Evidence, that the Government, in tho&s;e Days, &s;aw the mi&s;chievous Con&s;equences of them, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of put|ting early and effectual <HI>Re&s;traints</HI> upon them. And though, at the Revo|lution, the Wi&s;dom of the Nation, <HI>for &s;ome Ea&s;e to</HI> &s;crupulous <HI>Con&s;ciences in the Exerci&s;e of Religion</HI> (as the Words of the Act are) granted an Ex|emption from the Penalties of former Laws, both to Preachers and People; yet it is plain, that they <HI>&s;aw</HI> the mi&s;chievous Con&s;equences of granting that Indulgence, without &s;uch <HI>Conditions</HI> and <HI>Limitations,</HI> as would be a Security to the E&s;tabli&s;hed Government and Religion, again&s;t the Advantages it might <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> give to the Enemies of both.</P>
<P>And therefore the Act of Toleration provides, as to the <HI>People,</HI> that none &s;hall have the Benefit of it, but &s;uch as will take the Oaths to the Govern|ment, and &s;ub&s;cribe the Declaration again&s;t Popery (30 <HI>Car.</HI> II, c. 1;) and as to the <HI>Preachers,</HI> it obliges them, not only to take the &s;aid Oaths and &s;ub|&s;cribe the Declaration, but al&s;o to &s;ub&s;cribe the Thirty-nine Articles of Re|ligion; <HI>tho&s;e</HI> excepted, which relate to <HI>Ceremonies, Homilies,</HI> the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ecra|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and <HI>Infant Bapti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="005515_0006_10184B5E90A3A4C0">II. But now, this new Sect of <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> have broken-thro' all the&s;e Pro|vi&s;ions and Re&s;traints; neither regarding the Penalties of the Laws which &s;tand in full Force again&s;t them, nor embracing the Protection which the Act of <HI>Toleration</HI> might give them in Ca&s;e they comply'd with the Condi|tions of it. And if this be not an open <HI>Defiance</HI> of Government, it is hard to &s;ay what is.</P>
<P>They began with Evening-Meetings at private Hou&s;es; but they have been going on, for &s;ome Time, to open and appoint <HI>publick Places</HI> of Reli|gious Wor&s;hip, with the &s;ame Freedom, as if they were warranted by the Act of <HI>Toleration.</HI> And, not content with that, they have had the Bold|ne&s;s to <HI>preach</HI> in the <HI>Fields</HI> and other open Places, and by publick Adver|ti&s;ements to invite the <HI>Rabble</HI> to be their Hearers; notwith&s;tanding an ex|pre&s;s Declaration in a Statute (22 <HI>Car.</HI> II. c. 1.) again&s;t a&s;&s;embling in a FIELD, by Name. And how big with Mi&s;chief that Practice in particular is, may be abundantly &s;een in the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent Accounts of it in a neighbouring Nation; and may be &s;en&s;ibly felt in our own, when it will be too late to remedy it, if not attended to <HI>in Time.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that in mo&s;t <HI>other</HI> Steps which the Methodi&s;ts take, the Act of <HI>Toleration</HI> would be a Security again&s;t the Penalties of former Laws, if they would but qualify them&s;elves according to the Direction of it; but in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Field-preaching,</HI> it is conceived that it would not &s;ecure them. For that Act not only requires the Qualifications of <HI>Oaths</HI> and <HI>Sub&s;crip|tions</HI> as above, but al&s;o provides, <HI>That no Congregation or A&s;&s;embly for Religious Wor&s;hip &s;hall be there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y permitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r allowed, until the</HI> PLACE <HI>of &s;uch Meeting &s;hall be certified to the Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;e, or to the Archdeacon of the Arch|deaconry, or to the Ju&s;tices of the Peace at their General or Quarter Se&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>And it would be a &s;trange Con&s;truction to give any other Meaning to the Word PLACE in that Clau&s;e of the Act, than a particular <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> opened for Religious Wor&s;hip, and a fix'd Place to be repaired-to by a Congregation of Di&s;&s;enters; in which Sen&s;e it has been univer&s;ally under&s;tood. And indeed the Act of <HI>Toleration</HI> it&s;elf plainly leads to this Meaning, when it forbids a|ny <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> of Per&s;ons, di&s;&s;enting from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to be had <Q>in any PLACE for Religious Wor&s;hip, with the Doors lock'd, barr'd, or bolt|ed.</Q> Nor has it been known, that a Di&s;&s;enting Teacher of any Denomina|tion whatever, has thought him&s;elf warranted, under the Act of <HI>Toleration,</HI> to preach in <HI>Fie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s,</HI> or <HI>Streets.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. But notwith&s;tanding &s;uch open Inroads upon the National Con&s;titu|tion; the&s;e Teachers and their Followe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> affect to be thought Members of the <HI>National</HI> Church, and do accordingly join in <HI>Communion</HI> with it; though in a <HI>Manner</HI> that is very irregular&punc; and contrary to the Directions laid down in
<PB N="5" REF="005515_0007_10184B604A1BB520">
the Rubrick before the <HI>Communion</HI>-Service; which is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Act
of Uniformity. This Rubrick directs, as follows:</P>
<Q><P>So many as intend to be Partakers of the Holy Communion, &s;hall &s;ignify their Names to the Curate, at lea&s;t &s;ome Time the Day before.</P>
<P>And if any of tho&s;e be an open and notorious evil Liver, or have done any Wrong to his Neighbours by Word o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Deed, &s;o that the Congregation is thereby offended; the Curate, having Knowledge thereof, &s;hall call him and adverti&s;e him, that in any wi&s;e he pre&s;ume not to come to the Lord's Table, until he hath openly declared him&s;elf to have truly repented, and amended his former naughty Life, that the Congregation may thereby be &s;atisfied, which before were offended: and that he hath recompen&s;ed the Parties to whom he hath done Wrong, or at lea&s;t declare him&s;elf to be in full Purpo&s;e &s;o to do, as &s;oon as he conveniently may.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Order &s;hall the Curate u&s;e with tho&s;e betwixt whom he per|ceiveth Malice and Hatred to reign; not &s;uffering them to be Partakers of the Lord's Table, until he know them to be reconciled.</P></Q>
<P>It is plain, by the whole Tenor of this Rubrick, that by the Word <HI>Cu|rate,</HI> is meant the proper Mini&s;ter who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the Cure of Souls (according to the u&s;ual Meaning of the Word throughout the Book of Commom-Prayer,) or &s;ome other officiating under him; and that by <HI>Neighbours,</HI> and tho&s;e whom he is to forbid to come to the Lord's Table till they amend their Lives, and till they be reconciled, are meant his <HI>Pari&s;hioners,</HI> overs whom he is placed as their Guide and In&s;tructor, and, as &s;uch, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have Knowledge of their Behaviour, and a Right to interpo&s;e in their Spiritual Concerns.</P>
<P>Upon the like Con&s;iderations of the <HI>Fitne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of every one's receiving the Holy Sacrament with his own Pari&s;hioners, and from the Hands of his own Mini&s;ter, the 28th Canon of our Church requires <HI>the Church-wardens, to mark whether any</HI> Strangers <HI>come often and commonly from other Pari&s;hes to their Church, and to &s;hew the Mini&s;ter of them; le&s;t perhaps they may be admitted to the Lord's Table among others; which they &s;hall forbid, and remit &s;uch home to their own Pari&s;h-Churches and Mini&s;ters, there to re|ceive the Communion with the re&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f their Neighbours.</HI></P>
<P>And the&s;e general Rules, both in the Rubrick and Canon, as they are found|ed upon Rea&s;ons evidently good and wi&s;e in them&s;elves; &s;o are they, in their Effect and Operation, when duly ob&s;erved, the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t Means of pre|&s;erving Order and Regularity in the publick Admini&s;tration of Divine Offic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and of av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iding all that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;igned to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vent.

But though &s;uch Exceptions are al|ways admitted in the Con&s;truction and Application of General Rules&punc; no|thing
<PB N="6" REF="005515_0008_10184B61F994B900">
thing can ju&s;tify either a wilful Neglect, or an open Contempt, of the Rules them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="5">V. But now the&s;e whol&s;om Rules are not only broken-thro', but notori|ou&s;ly <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> by the new Sect of <HI>Methodi&s;ts;</HI> who, leaving their own Pari&s;h-Churches where they are known, come from &s;everal Quarters, in very <HI>great Numbers,</HI> to receive the Communion at <HI>other</HI> Churches, where they are not known; and between whom &amp; the Mini&s;ter there is no Manner of Relation.</P>
<P>This is a Practice which may ju&s;tly be complained of by the Mini&s;ters of the Churches to which they re&s;ort in that irregular Manner; as it puts &s;uch Mini&s;ters under the Difficulty, either of rejecting <HI>great Numbers</HI> as un|known to them, or admini&s;tring the Sacrament to <HI>great Numbers,</HI> of whom they have no Knowledge.</P>
<P N="6">VI. I know but one Thing that can be pleaded in Behalf of this Practice: by &s;uch, I mean, of them as de&s;ire to receive the Communion <HI>every</HI> Lord's Day; and that is, That there is not a <HI>weekly</HI> Communion in their own Pa|ri&s;h-Church. But may not this End be attained in a more quiet and inoffen|&s;ive Way, tho' not &s;trictly regular, if particular Per&s;ons, who are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed &s;hould repair <HI>privately</HI> to the Church <HI>neare&s;t</HI> to their own where the Sacra|ment is admini&s;tred every Lord's Day&punc; having fir&s;t &s;ignify'd their Names to the Mini&s;ter, as the Rubrick directs? Which, &s;urely, no Per&s;on can &s;cru|ple to do, who profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf a Member of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and who, as &s;uch, is obliged to come up, at lea&s;t as near as may be, to the Rules which it pre&s;cribes. But in this Way, our Methodi&s;ts would not have the vain Plea&s;ure of appearing together in a <HI>Body</HI> and as a di&s;tinct <HI>Sect.</HI> And this Sugge&s;tion, that there may be in that Part of their Conduct &s;ome Mix|ture of <HI>Vanity,</HI> will appear to be neither unju&s;t nor uncharitable, if it be con|&s;idered, that though in the Churches of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> there is u&s;u|ally a Sacrament on the <HI>fir&s;t Sunday</HI> of every Month, I doubt it will be found, that however that may le&s;&s;en, it d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es not hinder the Re&s;ort, on <HI>that</HI> Day, to the Churches where they have u&s;ually appeared in a <HI>Body</HI>
on <HI>other</HI> Days.</P>
<P>It appears from the foregoing Ob&s;ervations, that the <HI>Leaders</HI> of the&s;e People would act a far more con&s;i&s;tent and uniform Part, if they would either r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unce C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mmunion with the E&s;tabli&s;hed Church, or oblige them|&s;elves and their Followers to have a great Regard to the <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> of it.</P>

People. It is not ea&s;y to come at a <HI>certain</HI> Knowledge of their <HI>Tenets</HI>; but in their Teachings, they are &s;aid to re&s;t the <HI>Whole</HI> of Religion upon the &s;ingle Point of BELIEVING, and to di&s;claim the <HI>Moral</HI> Law as no Part of the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation. They are al&s;o &s;aid to decry all <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>In Fact, &s;everal of tho&s;e who perform the Offices of Prayer and Preaching in their
A&s;&s;emblies, are common</HI> Mechanicks.</NOTE> <HI>human</HI> Quali|fications for the Mini&s;try, and all <HI>human</HI> Helps and Preparations towards the Conver&s;ion and Conviction of a Sinner; &s;o that they &s;hould &s;eem to re&s;olve all into the <HI>immediate</HI> Teachings and Workings of the Spirit. However, my <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Concern is not with their <HI>Principles,</HI> but with that which is more certain, I mean their <HI>Proceedings</HI>; particularly, their &s;etting up publick Places of A&s;&s;embly, with as much <HI>Openne&s;s</HI> as tho&s;e of our Di&s;&s;enters, which are &s;et up under the Act of Toleration. At fir&s;t, their Numbers were incon&s;iderable; but having been joined by many of our own Methodi&s;ts, (by <HI>&s;ome</HI> of their <HI>Clergy,</HI> and by many more of their <HI>Laity,</HI> who have for&s;aken their fir&s;t Leaders,) they are grown into a con&s;iderable Body, and, both in City and Country, are <HI>multiplying Bands</HI> and Societies in the
<HI>Moravian</HI> Way. Which uncommon Zeal in their Leaders to carry on this Work, may probably proceed from a &s;trange Notion they have got, <HI>That</HI> (in the Words of one of them) <HI>our Saviour is,</HI> NOW, <HI>about gathering his Sheep out of all Nations, out of all Profe&s;&s;ions, out of all Parties, out of
all National Churches; into</HI> little <HI>Flocks which he governs with his</HI> Word <HI>and</HI> Spirit.' <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Part III. <HI>Qu.</HI> 3.</NOTE> A Notion, which mu&s;t be con&s;idered by all &s;ober and unin|fected
Minds, as merely <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;tical</HI>; and it will be great Blindne&s;s in their Followers, if they do not call upon them for Proofs from the Go&s;pel, or from a well atte&s;ted Revelation made to them&s;elves, of what our Saviour, as they pretend, is <HI>now</HI> about to do, and of their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion</HI> to be the authoris'd Doers of it.</P>
<P>There is indeed, a &s;pecial Provi&s;o in the Act of Uniformity, '<HI>That the Penalties of that Act &s;hall not extend to the</HI> Foreigners <HI>or</HI> Aliens <HI>of the Reformed Churches, allowed, or to be allowed, by the King's Maje&s;ty, his Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, in England.</HI> But do the Methodi&s;ts who join them, con&s;ider that them&s;elves are <HI>not</HI> Foreigners and Aliens? Or, do the real <HI>Moravians</HI> con&s;ider, that they hold, for o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght appears, open A&s;&s;emblies contrary to the &s;aid Law, or rather in Defiance of it? Or, being Foreig|ners, do they &s;o far mi&s;take our Con&s;titution, as to think that this is a Coun|try in which Religious A&s;&s;emblies of every Kind may be &s;et up <HI>at Plea&s;ure</HI> without any Regard to the Qualifications and Conditions upon which the Laws have allowed them?</P>
<P>The Country mo&s;t noted for an Indulgence to Religious Per&s;ua&s;ions and A&s;&s;emblies, is HOLLAND; but even there they are put under proper Re|&s;traints and Regulations; &s;uch as the State has thought fit, for its own Se|curity.

<P N="8">VIII.

The particular Members of each Society, having attended the <HI>publick</HI> Duties of the Day together with their Neighbours, as the Laws of Church and State direct, have al&s;o (by private Agreements among them&s;elves) their Evening Meetings, to employ the Remainder of the Day in &s;erious Conver&s;ation, and in Reading good Books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the&s;e Societies, having behaved with Mode&s;ty and Decency, and without any Violation of publick Order and Regularity, have received no Di&s;couragements, but, on the contrary, have been <HI>countenanced</HI> and <HI>encouraged</HI> by the Bi&s;hops and Clergy.

<P N="1"><HI>Query</HI> 1.

But in the &s;ame Journal, <HI>p.</HI> 56. he declares, without Re&s;erve, 'That he looks upon all the World as his Pari&s;h,' and explains his Mean|ing as follows; "In whatever Part of it I am, I judge it meet, right, and my bounden Duty, to declare unto all that are willing to hear, the glad Tidings of Salvation. This is the Work which I know God has call'd me to." Such al&s;o is the Language of Mr. <HI>White|field,</HI> (Journal VII. <HI>p.</HI> 18, 62, 78.) As to an extraordinary Call, I claim none, other|wi&s;e than the Apo&s;tle's Injunction, 'As we have Opportunity, let us do Good unto all Men.'&mdash;"God &s;eems to &s;hew me, it is my Duty to Evangelife, and not to fix in any particular place."&mdash;"I am now free to Evangelife and go whither&s;oever the Lord &s;hall be plea&s;ed to <HI>call</HI> me."</P>
<P>Now, if this <HI>Call</HI> may be pleaded by <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> on the Foot of that <HI>general</HI> Injunction, without any other <HI>Evidences</HI> of an <HI>Apo&s;tolical Mi&s;&s;ion</HI>; what Occa&s;ion had Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> to have Recour&s;e to the Plea of an <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Mi&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>It were well, if he and &s;ome others would remember what the &s;ame Apo&s;tle has &s;aid (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiv.33.) <HI>God is not the Author of</HI> Confu&s;ion (or, as it is in the Margin, <HI>not of</HI> TU|MULT) <HI>but of</HI> Peace, <HI>as in all Churches of the Saints.</HI></P></NOTE> <HI>to the Congregation where he &s;hall be lawfully appointed thereunto.</HI></P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops, indeed, and al&s;o our two Univer&s;ities, have Power to grant Licences to <HI>preach,</HI> of a larger Extent, to &s;uch Clergymen as they judge proper; who, in Virtue thereof, may, if they chu&s;e, <HI>travel</HI> from Place to Place as <HI>Itinerants.</HI> But then the Church has provided in that Ca&s;e (<HI>Can.</HI> 50.) <Q>That neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Mini&s;ter, Church-wardens, nor any other Officers of the Church, &s;hall &s;uffer any Man to preach within their Churches and Chapels, but &s;uch as, by &s;hewing their <HI>Licen&s;e</HI> to preach, &s;hall ap|pear unto them to be &s;ufficiently <HI>authori&s;ed thereunto.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Practice of Licen&s;ing <HI>Itinerant</HI> Preachers was occa&s;ioned by the low Talents of many Incumbents in the more <HI>early</HI> Days of the Reformation; who&s;e Abilities carry'd them no farther than to the Reading of <HI>Homilies.</HI> A Defect, which has long been remedied by a <HI>liberal Education</HI> of &s;uffici|ent Numbers of Per&s;ons for the Mini&s;try, who regularly perform the Of|fice of Preaching, as well as other Duties, in the Pari&s;hes committed to their Care. And if the forementioned Defect did &s;till continue, as, God be thank'd, it does not; it would be ill &s;upply'd by our <HI>modern Itinerants</HI> who make it their <HI>principal</HI> Employ, wherever they go, to in&s;till into the People a few <HI>favourite Tenets</HI> of their own; and this, with &s;uch Diligence and Zeal, as if the Whole of Chri&s;tianity depended upon them, and all Efforts towards the true Chri&s;tian Life, without a Belief of tho&s;e Tenets were vain and ineffectual.</P>

I cannot think &s;uch a way of Proceeding can gain your Lord&s;hips any Credit from the Publick, or any Thanks from the
<PB N="5" REF="005515_0022_10184B8D95E7E518">
other Bi&s;hops who have not intere&s;ted them&s;elves in this Affair, and who, I believe, are more <HI>noble,</HI> than to countenance the Publication of any &s;uch Performance.</P>
<P>It is a weighty Thing with me, my Lords, to have In&s;inuations made, or <HI>Queries</HI> put concerning me, in re&s;pect to my Practice and Doctrine, in &s;uch a Public Manner, by Per&s;ons that are placed at the Head of the Church.&mdash;It is true, your Lord&s;hips have not put the&s;e Queries in <HI>your own Names</HI>; but as the Author has concealed his, and the&s;e Papers are printed by your Lord&s;hips Orders, you have thereby <HI>adopted</HI> them for your own; con&s;equently, I am put under a Nece&s;&s;ity of directing this Letter as I have done. And I can a&s;&s;ure your Lord&s;hips, that with great Deference to the Dignity of your Office, after earne&s;t Prayer, with I tru&s;t &s;ome De|gree of Humility, and unfeigned Simplicity of Heart, I now &s;it down to perform my Promi&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> to give a Candid and Impartial An&s;wer to the fore-mentioned Papers, which were &s;ent me la&s;t Week, (collected into a Pamphlet) by Mr. <HI>Owen</HI>; I &s;uppo&s;e, according to your Lord&s;hips Order.</P>

<P>I Troubled your Lord&s;hips with a Letter &s;ome Time ago&mdash;I now pro|ceed according to my Promi&s;e at the clo&s;e of that, to an&s;wer the re|mainder of the Anonymous Pamphlet entitled, <HI>Ob&s;ervations upon the Conduct and Behaviour of a certain Sect u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Name of Methodi&s;ts.</HI>&mdash; The Author opens the &s;econd Part with this Preface&mdash; <Q>Be&s;ides the many <HI>Irregularities</HI> which are ju&s;tly charged upon the&s;e <HI>Iti|nerant</HI> Preachers as Violations of the Laws of Church and State; it may be proper to enquire, whether the <HI>Doctrines</HI> they teach, or tho&s;e Lengths they run, <HI>beyond</HI> what is practiced among our <HI>religious Societies,</HI> or in any other Chri&s;tian Church; be a Service or a Di&s;&s;ervice to Re|ligion? To which purpo&s;e, the following Queries are &s;ubmitted to Con|&s;ideration</Q> &mdash; It is here taken for granted that the Methodi&s;ts (termed by our Author either out of Contempt, or by way of Periphra&s;is) <HI>the&s;e Itinerant Preachers</HI> are ju&s;tly charged with many <HI>Irregularities,</HI> which amount to Violations of the Laws of Church and <HI>State.</HI> But how has the Author proved, what He here takes for granted? I humbly apprehend not at all &mdash; For has it not appeared in my An&s;wer to the fir&s;t Part of his Ob&s;ervations, that neither the Act of Toleration nor that of <HI>Charles</HI> IId any way affects the Methodi&s;ts, as being Loyal Subjects to His Maje&s;ty King <HI>George,</HI> and Members of the Church of <HI>England</HI>? How then have they been ju&s;tly charged with Violations of the Laws of the State? And has it not been equally made to appear that the Irregularity the Author &s;ays the Methodi&s;ts have been guilty of, in coming to other pari&s;h Churches to receive the Sacrament, is owing to the Negligence of your Lord&s;hip's Clergy
<PB N="4" REF="005515_0034_10184BB0A74EA710">
and Church-wardens? How then have they been ju&s;tly charged with Viola|tions of the Laws of the Church? But may we not &s;uppo&s;e by his &s;peak|ing &s;eemingly &s;o contemptuou&s;ly of <HI>the&s;e Itinerant Preachers,</HI> that Iti|nerant preaching it&s;elf, is one of the&s;e many Irregularities and Violatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the Laws of the <HI>Church at lea&s;t,</HI> if not of the <HI>State,</HI> which according to this Author are ju&s;tly charged upon the&s;e <HI>Itinerant Preachers?</HI> His eighth Query, page 11th (which for Method Sake I would here beg leave to make &s;ome Remarks upon) be&s;peaks as much&mdash;For He therein &s;ubmits it to the Con&s;ideration of the publick <Q>Whether; in a Chri&s;tian Nation, where the In&s;truction and Edification of the People is provided for, by placing Mini&s;ters <HI>in certain Di&s;tricts,</HI> to whom the Care of the Souls within tho&s;e Di&s;tricts is regularly committed; It can be for the Service of Religion, that Itinerant Preachers run up and down from Place to Place and from County to County, drawing after them confu&s;ed Multitudes of Peo|ple? An Evil which our Church has wi&s;ely provided again&s;t, &s;ays our Author, in the Ordination of a Prie&s;t, by expre&s;ly limiting the Exerci&s;e of the Powers conferred upon him, of preaching the Word of God, and admini&s;tring the Holy Sacraments, <HI>to the Congregation where He &s;hall be lawfully appointed thereunto</HI></Q> &mdash; Here indeed is a heinous Irregularity charged upon the&s;e Itinerant Preachers, even a Violation of the Commi&s;&s;ion given them when they were ordained Prie&s;ts; &mdash; But with what Ju&s;tice, I would refer to your Lord&s;hips Con&s;ideration &mdash; For if, the Commi&s;&s;ion given us when Ordained Prie&s;ts, ab&s;olutely prohibits us to preach any where be&s;ides in the Congregation where we &s;hall be lawfully appointed there|unto, will it not prove too much? And has not the Author in endeavour|ing to reproach us, unwarily reproached your Lord&s;hips al&s;o?&mdash;For are not your Lord&s;hips then equally irregular, equally Violators of the Laws of the Church whenever You preach (tho' it be never &s;o &s;eldom) out of your Lord&s;hips re&s;pective Dioce&s;&s;es? And does not this commi&s;&s;ion thus &s;trictly taken, ab&s;olutely forbid any Pre&s;byters what&s;oever preaching any where be|&s;ides in their own particular Congregations? And if &s;o, are not all Mini|&s;ters that exchange Pulpits equally irregular, at lea&s;t as rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly Violators of their Ordination Commi&s;&s;ion as the&s;e Itinerant Preachers?</P>
<P>Our Author in the following Paragraph under the forementioned Query tells us, <Q>that the Bi&s;hops indeed and al&s;o our two Univer&s;ities have power to grant Licences to <HI>preach,</HI> of a larger extent, to &s;uch Clergymen as as they judge proper; who, in virtue thereof may, if they chu&s;e, travel from place to place as <HI>Itinerants</HI> &mdash; But then the Church has provided in that Ca&s;e (<HI>Can.</HI> 50) That neither the Mini&s;ter, Church Wardens, nor any other Officers of the Church &s;hall &s;uffer any Man to preach within the Churches and Chapels, but &s;uch as by &s;howing their <HI>Licence</HI> to preach, &s;hall appear unto them to be &s;ufficiently Authorized there|unto
<PB N="5" REF="005515_0035_10184BB4D2B81570">
unto</Q> &mdash; What the&s;e Licences for Itinerant preaching are to which the Author here refers is not certain &mdash; Does He not &s;eem to mean the Com|mon Licences which Your Lord&s;hips give the Clergy, when they take upon them Holy Orders? Are not the&s;e the Licences which the Church-wardens examine? And what is the end of the&s;e Licences? Was it ever heard be|fore that they were to qualify per&s;ons to be <HI>Itinerant Preachers</HI>? Is not the plain end of them to &s;atisfy the Church-wardens that the per&s;ons that offer their Service have had a regular Ordination and are &s;ufficiently Authori&s;ed to preach? And does not the Author know that the&s;e Licences now are little regarded? Do not our Letters of Orders an&s;wer the &s;ame end to all intents and purpo&s;es? Were they not judged &s;ufficient at our fir&s;t &s;etting out into the Mini&s;try? And after all, what is it that the Mini&s;ters and Church-wardens can do to per&s;ons that have not the&s;e Licences? Why they are not to &s;uffer them to preach <HI>within</HI> their Churches and Chapels? But have they any power, my Lords, to hinder them from preaching <HI>without</HI> their Churches or Chapels? No, ble&s;&s;ed be God their power is limited <HI>within,</HI> Hitherto can they go, and no further &mdash; And therefore &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e Itinerant Preachers tho' they have no Licences, do not preach <HI>within</HI> any Churches or Chapels without the Mini&s;ters or Church-wardens con&s;ent, how are they ju&s;tly charged with Violating a Law of the Church, tho' they &s;hould preach <HI>without</HI> doors to as great Multitudes as &s;hall be inclined to hear them?</P>
<P>He proceeds in the 3d paragraph under this 8th Query to write thus <Q>the practice of licen&s;ing Itinerant Preachers was occa&s;ioned by the low ta|lents of many Incumbents in the more early days of the Reformation? who&s;e Abilities carry'd them no farther than to the reading of <HI>Homilies,</HI> a defect which has long been remedied by a <HI>Liberal Education</HI> of &s;uf|ficient Numbers of Per&s;ons for the Mini&s;try, who regularly perform the Office of <HI>Preaching,</HI> as well as other Duties, in the Pari&s;hes committed to their Care. And if the forementioned Defect did &s;till continue, as God be thanked, it does not; it would be ill &s;upplied by our <HI>Modern</HI> Itinerants, who make it their <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">incipal</HI> employ where ever they go, to in&s;till into the People a few <HI>favourite tenets</HI> of their own; and this, with &s;uch Diligence and Zeal as if the whole of Chri&s;tianity depended upon them, and all Efforts towards the true Chri&s;tian Life, without a Belief of tho&s;e Tenets, were vain and ineffectual.</Q> </P>
<P>But my Lords, what can this Author mean by writing thus? For &s;up|po&s;ing the Practice of Itinerant preaching was primarily occa&s;ioned by the low Talents of many Incumbents in the more <HI>early</HI> Days of the Reformati|on, does it therefore follow, that there can be no other ju&s;t Cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned for Itinerant preaching now? What if the Generality of the pre&s;ent many Incumbents depart from the good old Doctrines that were preached in the
<PB N="6" REF="005515_0036_10184BB7B3A98A48">
more early Days of the Reformation, and notwith&s;tanding their <HI>liberal</HI> E|ducation, make no other U&s;e of their Learning but to explain away the Ar|ticles and Homilies to which they have &s;ub&s;cribed in the grammatical and literal Sen&s;e? Is it not nece&s;&s;ary in order to keep up the Doctrines, and thereby the real Dignity of the Church, that either the Clergy thus dege|nerated, &s;hould be obliged to read the Homilies as formerly, and to preach con&s;i&s;tently therewith, or that tho&s;e who do hold the Doctrines of the Re|formation, &s;hould go about from Place to Place, and from County to County, nay from Pole to Pole, if their Sphere of Action extended &s;o far, to direct poor Souls that are every-where ready to peri&s;h for lack of Know|ledge, into the right Way which leadeth unto Life? That this is the Ca&s;e between the e&s;tabli&s;hed Clergy and the&s;e Itinerant Preachers will appear pre&s;ently; and how then can this Author charge them with making it their <HI>principal</HI> Employ, wherever they go, to in&s;till into the People a few <HI>favou|rite Tenets of their own?</HI> Has the Author follo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed them wherever they have preached, that he a&s;&s;erts this &s;o confidently concerning them?

And may I not take the Freedom of acquainting your Lord&s;hips, that if all the Right Reverend the Bi&s;hops did their Duty, (e&s;pecially my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> who&s;e Dioce&s;s is of &s;uch a va&s;t Extent) they would all of them long &s;ince have commenced Itinerant Preachers too?</P>
<P>But to return to an Examination of the other Part of the Author's Pre|face &mdash;After he has taken it for granted, that many Irregularities are ju&s;tly charged upon the&s;e Itinerant Preachers as <Q>Violations of the Laws of Church and State, He adds, it may be proper to enquire, whether the Doctrines they teach, and tho&s;e Lengths they run beyond what is prac|ti&s;ed among our Religious Societies, or in any other Chri&s;tian Church, be a Service or Di&s;&s;ervice to Religion.</Q> The Religious Societies or any <HI>other</HI> Chri&s;tian Church? What? Does our Author make the Religious Societies a Church? This is going further than the Methodi&s;ts, whom he is plea&s;ed to &s;tile only a <HI>Sect?</HI> But if the Religious Societies, my Lords, be a <HI>Church,</HI> may it not be proper to enquire how their Doctrines or Prac|tices came to be &s;et up as a Rule and Standard for others to go by, &s;o that Per&s;ons doing Service or Di&s;&s;ervice to Religion mu&s;t be judged of accord|ing as they deviate from or adhere to the Religious Societies either in Doctrine or Practice? Or &s;uppo&s;ing the Religious Societies were to be a Standard for others to go by, was it not incumbent on the Author to give the publick a &s;hort Summary &amp; Account of their Doctrines and Practices? For otherwi&s;e how can the World po&s;&s;ibly judge whether the Methodi&s;ts do deviate from them, or if &s;o, whether they do thereby Service or Di&s;|&s;ervice to Religion? Indeed this Author has told us in his fir&s;t Part how the Religious Societies behave on Sundays, but he has no where acquaint|ed us with the Principles they hold, or how they behave on other Days. &mdash; And till he does I will venture to affirm, that unle&s;s the&s;e Itinerants teach other Doctrines than the pre&s;ent Religious Societies generally hold, and run greater Lengths in Chri&s;tianity than the Generality of them it is to be feared now run, they will be in great Danger of never arriving at <HI>the Mark for the Prize of their High-Calling in Chri&s;t Je&s;us their Lord.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>I have been the more particular, my Lord, in the Examination of the Preface, becau&s;e the Author by annexing the&s;e Words, <Q>To which Pur|po&s;e the following Queries are &s;ubmitted to Con&s;ideration,</Q> &s;eems to lay it down as the Ground-work and Foundation of all the &s;ub&s;equent Queries.&mdash; And if the Foundation be &s;o weak and &s;andy, how &s;light and &s;uperficial mu&s;t the Super&s;tructure be?</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e your Lord&s;hips will readily grant that it is the bounden Duty of every regular and fair Writer (e&s;pecially when he is charging others with Irregularities as Violations of the Laws of Church and State) to take Care that he does not violate the Laws of Chri&s;tian Charity &mdash; Or if he puts Queries to the Publick concerning any Per&s;ons, ought he not to take
<PB N="8" REF="005515_0038_10184BBD111BF970">
heed that tho&s;e Queries are founded upon Truth, and that the Charges therein exhibited again&s;t them are really matter of fact? But our Author has notoriou&s;ly neglected this fundamental Rule, and thereby not only ca&s;t a la&s;ting Blot and Odium upon his own Character, if his Name was known, but al&s;o done real Hurt to the Cau&s;e he would defend&mdash; The Query al|ready examined concerning Itinerant preaching, wherein he has charged the Methodi&s;ts with in&s;tilling into People a few favourite <HI>Tenets</HI> of their own, &s;ufficiently Demon&s;trates this &mdash; But this is not all, &s;everal of the other Queries now coming under Con&s;ideration are by no <HI>means</HI> founded upon Truth, and contain Charges again&s;t the&s;e Itinerants, whereby they are as much wronged and unju&s;tly vilified as ever <HI>Stephen</HI> was when the Jews &s;uborned Men which &s;aid, <HI>We have heard him &s;peak bla&s;phemous Words again&s;t Mo&s;es and again&s;t God, this holy Place and the Law.</HI></P>
<P>To prove this we need only examine the two Queries which immediately follow the Preface&mdash;</P>
<P N="1"><HI>Query</HI> 1&s;t.
<Q>Whether Notions in <HI>Religion</HI> may not be <HI>heightened to &s;uch Extremes</HI> as to lead &s;ome into a Di&s;regard of Religion it&s;elf through De&s;|pair of attaining <HI>&s;uch exalted Heights?</HI> And <HI>whether</HI> others, <HI>Who have imbibed tho&s;e Notions, may not be led by them into</HI> a Di&s;regard and <HI>Di&s;|e&s;teem</HI> of the common Duties and Offices of Life, to &s;uch a Degree at lea&s;t as is incon&s;i&s;tent with that Attention to them and that Diligence in them, which Providence has made nece&s;&s;ary to the Well-being of private Families, and publick Societies, and which Chri&s;tianity <HI>does not only</HI> require in all Stations and in all Conditions, but declares at the &s;ame time (<HI>Col.</HI> 3.22. <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> 5.6.) that the performance even of the low<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t Offices in Life, as unto God (<HI>Who&s;e Providence</HI> has placed People in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r &s;everal Stations) is truly Serving Chri&s;t and will not fail of its Reward in the next World.</Q></P>
<P N="2"><HI>Query</HI> 2.
<Q>Whether the Enemy of Mankind may not find his Ac|count in their carrying Chri&s;tianity, which was de&s;igned for a <HI>Rule</HI> to all Stations and all Conditions; to &s;uch Heights as make it fairly practicable by a very few in Compari&s;on, or rather by none?</Q></P>
<P>His 5th and 6th <HI>Queries,</HI> Page the 10th, are like unto them&mdash; The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> run thus, <Q>Whether tho&s;e exalted Strains in Religion, and an Imagination of being already in a State of <HI>Perfection,</HI> are not apt to lead Men to Spi|ritual Pride and to a <HI>Contempt</HI> of their Fellow-Chri&s;tians; while they con|&s;ider them as only going-on in what they account the <HI>low</HI> and <HI>imperfect</HI> Way, (<HI>i. e.</HI> as growing in Grace and Goodne&s;s only <HI>by Degrees,</HI>)</Q> And again, <Q>Whether the &s;ame exalted Strains and Notions do not tend to weaken the <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>civil</HI> Relations among Men, by leading the Inferi|ors, into who&s;e Heads tho&s;e Notions are infu&s;ed, to a Di&s;e&s;teem of their Superiors; while they con&s;ider them as in a much <HI>lower Di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> than
<PB N="9" REF="005515_0039_10184BBFE6770008">
them&s;elves; though tho&s;e Superiours are otherwi&s;e &s;ober and good Men, and regular Attendants on the Ordinances of Religion?</Q></P>
<P>Here again it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e <HI>Itinerant Preachers</HI> either imagine <Q>them&s;elves to be in a State of Perfection, or at lea&s;t teach others to imagine that they are&mdash;And that the Con&s;equences of this is a weak|ning the natural and civil Relations among Men by leading them to a Di&s;e&s;teem of their Fellow-Chri&s;tians, and Superiors who are &s;uppo|&s;ed to be in a lower Di&s;pen&s;ation than them&s;elves?</Q></P>
<P>Heavy Charges my Lords, the&s;e are indeed!&mdash;But what Evidence does our Author produce to prove them? Why really none at all&mdash;For here is no Quotation at the Bottom of either of the&s;e Queries from any of their Writings, &s;o that we cannot tell whether they are levelled again&s;t the&s;e <HI>Itinerate Preachers</HI> in general or any one of them in par|cular&mdash; And therefore the Prebend of St. <HI>Paul's</HI> who has been plea&s;ed to reply to my fir&s;t Letter in Vindication of this Author, has done wrong in affirming, as far as I can recollect, <Q>that under each Query there is &s;ome Quotation either from my Journals or other Writings, whereon it is founded</Q> &mdash; But there is no &s;uch Thing under the&s;e Four wherein &s;uch heavy Charges are included &mdash; And therefore may I not argue, as the Author does upon another Occa&s;ion in his fir&s;t Part, Page 8th, 'till &s;ome Proof does <HI>appear</HI> the <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI> mu&s;t be that he has none?</P>
<P>In the mean while I dare challenge this Author, and the whole World to produce any Pa&s;&s;age out of my Writings wherein I have taught any other Chri&s;tianity than what through the Aids of the Ble&s;&s;ed Spirit is practicable by <HI>all</HI> Per&s;ons <HI>in all</HI> Conditions; or that I ever preached o|therwi&s;e than <Q>that the Performance even of the lowe&s;t Offices of Life <HI>as unto God</HI> who&s;e Providence has placed People in their &s;everal Stations, is truly a <HI>&s;erving of Chri&s;t</HI> and will not fail of its Reward (though not of Debt yet of Grace) in the next World.</Q> Neither did I ever imagine that I had attain'd, or was already perfect, or taught Per&s;ons to imagine that they were &s;o: No, I expect to carry a Body of Sin and Death about with me as long as I live, and confe&s;s from my in|mo&s;t Soul, that I am the chief of Sinners, and le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints: I am &s;o far from thinking an <HI>Imagination</HI> that we are already in a State of Perfection, is only apt to <HI>lead</HI> Men into &s;piritual Pride, that I condemn it as the very Quinte&s;cence and highe&s;t Degree of it.&mdash; And the more we are conformed to the Divine Image, the more I &s;trict believe we &s;hall be in keeping up our natural and civil Relations among Men, in giving all Honour to whom Honour is due, and in Lowline&s;s of Mind e&s;teeming each other better than our&s;elves. And if &s;o, my Lords, may not the Author for thus charging the&s;e <HI>Itinerants</HI> in general <HI>without Di|&s;tinction</HI> be ju&s;tly &s;tiled a <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">beller?</HI> And how will he undertake to prove that any one of the&s;e Itinerant Preachers in particular carries Chri&s;tianity to
<PB N="10" REF="005515_0040_10184BC1D19EA2A8">
any greater Heighth than he him&s;elf does Query 13th, Page 16, where in &s;peaking of the Holy Spirit, he has the&s;e Words, <Q>who&s;e peculiar Office it is, to &s;ea&s;on the Heart with Humility, and to root out of it the <HI>Seeds</HI> (what is that but the very <HI>Inbeing</HI>?) of Pride and vain Glory.</Q></P>
<P>Is he not very irregular in writing thus at Random; nay, does he not hereby him&s;elf openly violate the Laws both of Church and State?</P>
<P>It's true, our Author would appear an Advocate for both, but does not his third Query, page 9th plainly prove him a real Friend to neither; e&s;pecially the latter?

<P>And if both the Article &amp; Homily of the Church of <HI>England</HI> expre&s;ly de|clare that we are ju&s;tified <HI>before</HI> (or in the Sight of) <HI>God,</HI> by <HI>faith,</HI> and <HI>faith only,</HI> how can <Q>a careful and &s;incere Ob&s;ervance of moral duties be a <HI>Con|dition,</HI> my Lords, of our Acceptance with God, and of our being ju&s;tified in his Sight?</Q> And if the Doctrine of being ju&s;tified by <HI>Faith only</HI> be a <HI>whol&s;ome Doctrine,</HI> and <HI>very full of comfort,</HI> how can this Author in the latter Part of this Query now before us, enquire, <Q>whether preaching this Doc|trine, does not naturally lead People to a <HI>Di&s;regard</HI> of tho&s;e, viz. moral

Duties, and a low E&s;teem of them; or rather to think them no Part of the Chri&s;tian Religion?</Q> Does he con&s;ider that in writing thus, he di|rectly &s;ymbolizes with the Infidel, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.1. who is introduced after the Apo|&s;tle had been in&s;i&s;ting at large on this Doctrine of <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> by <HI>Faith</HI> only as &s;peaking like our Author, "<HI>&s;hall we &s;in then that grace may abound</HI>&mdash;"?

<P>To this Query our Author annexes the following Ob&s;ervation &mdash; <Q>The Words of the pious and judicious Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> are very material to this Purpo&s;e <HI>For my part,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I do heartily wi&s;h that by publick Authority it were &s;o ordered, that</HI> no Man, &s;hould <HI>ever</HI> preach or print this Doctrine, that Faith alone, ju&s;tifies, <HI>unle&s;s he joins this together with it,</HI> That univer&s;al Obedience is nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation</Q> &mdash; What Piety and Judgement Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> might be remarkable for I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ow not &mdash; But if by <HI>univer&s;al Obedience being nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation,</HI> He means what our Auther does (or otherwi&s;e this Quotation is nothing to the Purpo&s;e) Ju&s;tification in the Sight of God, then Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s writing after this Manner is a Specimen neither of his Piety or Judgment &mdash; Becau&s;e the quite contrary Doctrine is contained in our Articles and e&s;tabli&s;hed by publick Authority &mdash; So that to wi&s;h for Ju&s;tification by Faith alone to be put down by publick Authority, what is it in Effect but to wi&s;h for the utter Subver&s;ion of the grand Doctrine of the Reformation?

Is this one of the Recreations of <HI>all</HI> Kinds which may be kept within the Bounds of Innocence? Is it not a kind of ca&s;ting Lots? Has it not the Appearance of Evil? Is it not therefore forbidden in the Scriptures? Or if he will not hear the Scriptures will he not hear the Church? And what &s;ays the 75th Canon? <Q>No Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;on &s;hall at any Time, other than for their hone&s;t Nece&s;&s;ities, re&s;ort to any Taverns or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, neither &s;hall they board or lodge in any &s;uch Places. Fur|ther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, they &s;hall not give them&s;elves to any ba&s;e or &s;ervile Labour, or to Drinking or Riot, &s;pending their Time idly by Day or by Night, playing at Dice, <HI>Cards</HI> or Tables, or <HI>any other unlawful Game</HI>: But at all Times convenient, they &s;hall hear or read &s;omewhat of the holy Scriptures, or &s;hall occupy them&s;elves with &s;ome other hone&s;t Study or Exerci&s;e, always doing the Things which &s;hall appertain to Hone&s;ty, and endeavouring to profit the Church of God, having always in Mind that they ought to excel all others in Purity of Life, and &s;hould be Ex|amples to the People to live well and chri&s;tianly, under Pain of eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Cen&s;ures to be inflicted with Severity, according to the Qualities of their Offences.</Q> An excellent Canon this! And may I not argue from it thus? Either this Canon is founded upon the Word of God, or it is not &mdash; If it be not, why is it not abrogated? If it be, why is it not put in Practice? Why do the Clergy encourage frequenting of Taverns, Ale|hou&s;es and Gaming by their own Example? Are not &s;uch Practices in this Canon &s;uppo&s;ed to be quite contrary to the Purity of Life, and Ex|cellency of Example which may be ju&s;tly required from them? And

if &s;uch Things are un&s;eemly in a Clergyman, are they not in a Degree equally un&s;eemly in Laymen who&s;e Priviledge as well as Duty it is to be <HI>holy in all manner of Conver&s;ation and Godline&s;s,</HI> and who are univer&s;ally commanded to <HI>&s;hine as Lights in the World amid&s;t a crooked and perver&s;e Generation?</HI></P>
<P>My Lords, might it not rea&s;onably have been hoped that your Lord&s;hips were too well acquainted with real and inward Religion, to think that a Soul born of God, and made Partaker of a Divine Nature can &s;toop &s;o low, and act &s;o unlike it&s;elf as to &s;eek for Recreation in Gaming? Does not the glorious and plenteous Redemption, that great, inexpre&s;&s;ibly great and pre&s;ent Salvation, which the Great High Prie&s;t and Apo&s;tle of our Profe&s;|&s;ion has purcha&s;ed for us by &s;hedding his dear Heart's Blood, and whereby we are <HI>redeemed from this pre&s;ent evil Worlds,</HI> &s;et us above &s;uch triflng Things as the&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing they were not directly &s;inful? Are not Chri&s;|tians Kings and Prie&s;ts unto God? And is it not as much beneath the Dig|nity of their Heaven-born Spirits to &s;toop to &s;o low an Amu&s;ement as Gaming of any kind, as ever it was beneath the Dignity of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|peror to &s;pend his Time in the Royal Amu&s;ement of catching Flies? &mdash; Does not our Author therefore, my Lords, by writing thus &s;trike at the very Vitals of Religion, and prove too plainly that he is a Stranger to that Power of the dear Redeemer's Re&s;urrection? Need we therefore wonder at his 12th <HI>Query,</HI> Page 12th, which immediately follows the foregoing one? wherein he enquires, <Q>Whether the &s;trong Expre&s;&s;ions which are found in their printed Journals, of <HI>extraordinary Pre&s;ences</HI> of God directing and a&s;&s;i&s;ting them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a more <HI>immediate</HI> Manner, do not need &s;ome Te&s;timonies of a divine Mi&s;&s;ion, to clear them from the Charge of En|thu&s;ia&s;m?</Q> Under this Query our Author has al&s;o mentioned &s;everal Pa&s;|&s;ages of my Journals extracted by my Lord of <HI>London,</HI> in his la&s;t pa&s;toral Letter again&s;t <HI>Luke warmne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> and has al&s;o been at great Pains to extract many more out of my four la&s;t Journals which have been printed &s;ince, and which according to our Author, are <HI>more full of Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, than the three fir&s;t? &mdash; But does not this Author forget that I an&s;wered his Lord&s;hip's Letter, and in that proved, that his Lord&s;hip was mi&s;taken in his Definition of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI>; and that according to his De|finition I was no <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t?</HI> Did I not al&s;o prove, that the Propo&s;itions on which his Lord&s;hip's Quotations were founded were fal&s;e?

he a&s;ks whether the &s;trong Expre&s;&s;ions which are found in their (I &s;uppo&s;e he would have &s;aid <HI>his</HI>) printed Journals, for I find under this Query no Journals re|ferred to but mine, of <HI>extraordinary Pre&s;ences</HI> of God directing &amp; a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in a <HI>more immediate Manner,</HI> do not need &s;ome Te&s;timonies of a Divine Mi&s;|&s;ion, to clear them from the Charge of Enthu&s;ia&s;m? I would a&s;k this Au|thor again, what Te&s;timonies he would have? Can he bring any Proof again&s;t the Matters of Fact recorded in the&s;e Journals&punc; Or will he venture to affirm that I did not feel the Divine Pre&s;ence in an extraordinary Man|ner, that is more at one Time than another?

Did not my Lord of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> (for I mu&s;t again repeat it) give me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Apo&s;tolical one when he &s;aid, "Receive thou the Holy Gho&s;t by the Impo&s;ition of our Hands?"

Or is it not more extraordinary (only indeed that it has been a good while too too common) that the Right Reverend the Bi&s;hops &s;hould take upon them to confer the Holy Gho&s;t, and the Reverend the Clergy, profe&s;s they are inwardly moved by it, and yet charge every Expre&s;|&s;ion they meet with, wherein his ble&s;&s;ed Influences are &s;poke of as felt and experienced, with being downwright Enthu&s;ia&s;m? But what &s;hall we &s;ay? <HI>The natural Man di&s;cerneth not the Things of the Spirit, they are Fooli&s;hne&s;s un|to him, neither can he under&s;tand them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned</HI>&mdash; What if &s;ome of the Expre&s;&s;ions, my Lords, in the Journals are <HI>&s;trong</HI>?
