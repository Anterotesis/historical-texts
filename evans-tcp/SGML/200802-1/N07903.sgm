<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE following di&s;cour&s;e was written for the mo&s;t part at Paris, and &s;erved as an agree|able relaxation from the &s;e|verer &s;tudies in which I was, at that time, engaged. Our travelling together gave me an opportunity of &s;ubmitting the performance to your critical eye, and it affords me a &s;ingular &s;atisfaction to acknowlege, that, in &s;everal parti|culars, it has been greatly amended by your candid and judicious remarks.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="010082_0004_0F7C949A79E3F240">UPON &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this, I &s;hould deem my&s;elf ungrateful indeed, was I to withold the little tribute I have in my power to pay to that genu|ine worth and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip, which I have experienced in you.</P>
<P>SURE I am that a per&s;on of your ami|able di&s;po&s;ition, who&s;e heart glows with the utmo&s;t warmth of &s;ocial affec|tion, who&s;e mind is enriched with the trea&s;ures of ancient and modern learn|ing, and who&s;e ta&s;te has been improved and refined, by an acquaintance and conver&s;ation with men of the fir&s;t rank in life and of the greate&s;t abilities in the learned world, mu&s;t be eminently u&s;e|ful to mankind, and particularly adorn and ble&s;s the land wherein providence calls him to re&s;ide. With great rea&s;on, therefore, may we hope to &s;ee you become a di&s;tingui&s;hed ornament to &s;o|ciety. With great rea&s;on may the place of your nativity claim the advantages which ari&s;e from &s;uch abilities, and
<PB N="v" REF="010082_0005_0F7C949B3505DE28">
from a genius that was formed and nur|tured in her own bo&s;om. Your coun|try has much to expect in waiting the return of a &s;on ble&s;&s;ed with &s;o many u&s;eful endowments; and I well know that, among&s;t your many other virtues, the love of your country prevails too much in your brea&s;t to let her &s;u&s;tain a di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>OPULENCE and genero&s;ity &s;eldom go hand in hand. The gifts of fortune are rarely accompanied with a &s;pirit to em|ploy them in deeds of charity and di&s;|intere&s;ted benevolence.</P>
<P>IT is yours, Sir, to &s;oar above the &s;ordid views of vulgar minds, and en|joy the &s;ublime plea&s;ures of a tender and &s;ympathizing humanity, which al|ways carries its own reward, in the &s;a|tisfacton that flows from the exerci&s;e of &s;o precious a gift of divine bounty.</P>
<P>THERE are no connections in life more honourable than tho&s;e which we form with men of learning and virtue.
<PB N="vi" REF="010082_0006_0F7C949C286CA9D0">
I cannot but congratulate my&s;elf, there|fore, on the &s;trict intimacy with which you have &s;o long indulged me, and, at the &s;ame time, be thankful to you for the advantages it has often procured me in foreign parts.</P>
<P>DURING an ab&s;ence of five years from my country and friends, whil&s;t I was engaged in &s;uch pur&s;uits as were indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to fit me for more exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s in my profe&s;&s;ion, the almo&s;t uninterrupted enjoyment of your company, or corre&s;pondence, con|tributed much to make &s;uch a &s;epara|tion more ea&s;y and &s;upportable. It will always give me un&s;peakable plea&s;ure to reflect upon the variety of &s;cenes through which we have pa&s;&s;ed, and the enter|tainment and improvement we have met with, in vi&s;iting the principal cities and &s;eats of &s;cience in Great-Britain, Holland, France and Italy; places ce|lebrated for the birth or re&s;idence of men of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious genius in the

world, and di&s;tingui&s;hed for the cul|tivation of manners, polite arts and li|terature.</P>
<P>THESE are the &s;everal con&s;iderations that have induced me to pre&s;ent you with this performance. Happy &s;hould I have thought my&s;elf, if a little more lei&s;ure had enabled me to render it &s;ome|what more worthy your notice. Such as it is, however, I reque&s;t you to ac|cept it as a &s;mall te&s;timony of my per&s;onal regard and affection for you. Whatever may be the merit or &s;ucce&s;s of the work it&s;elf, I &s;hall always rejoice that it has given me an opportunity of telling the world, how much I re&s;pect your character, and what an high va|lue I place upon your friend&s;hip.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE delay in publi&s;hing my addre&s;s on the in&s;titution of Medical &s;chools aro&s;e from the indi&s;pen&s;able calls of bu&s;ine&s;s. It has given me an opportunity, however, of hearing the opinion of many people upon the ad|dre&s;s; but more particularly upon what relates to my propo&s;ed method of practi&s;ing phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>MY intention with regard to the latter, having been made known by general conver&s;ations only, I find has been often mi&s;under&s;tood. No wonder then, if, in con&s;equence thereof, it has been &s;ometimes greatly mi&s;repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>THIS has determined me to commit to the pre&s;s the plan of practice by which I de&s;ign to regulate my&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible; and to deliver my &s;en|timents very briefly on the expediency of a regular and di&s;tinct practice in the &s;everal branches of Medi|cine. The public will then be able to judge more
<PB N="ii" REF="010082_0009_0F7C94A0C5B1A058">
clearly of the propriety of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which from a full per&s;ua&s;ion of their great utility, I ven|ture to recommend.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I purpo&s;e to confine my&s;elf, in practice, to tho&s;e ca&s;es which belong mo&s;t immediately to the office of a Phy&s;ician, that I may pre&s;cribe for and attend &s;uch ca&s;es to greater advantage. I &s;hall therefore avoid, all I can, interfering in the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;urgery viz. m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ual operation.</P>
<P>I DO not mean however to refu&s;e to innoculate for the &s;mall-pox, where my patients or their friends object to employ another hand to make the inci&s;ion. This may frequently happen, although there is no more difficulty of art required in it, than in cutting an i&s;&s;ue and in&s;erting a pea, or than in cupping and bleeding.</P>
<P>Secondly, I propo&s;e, in &s;uch ca&s;es as &s;hall be re|quired, to attend in con&s;ultation with other Phy&s;i|cians, on the &s;ame terms as tho&s;e of character enter into con&s;ultation with one another.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I &s;hall give my opinion in writing on the complaints of patients at a di&s;tance from Philadel|phia, whenever the hi&s;tory of the ca&s;e is properly drawn up and tran&s;mitted to me for advice.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="010082_0010_0F7C94A153DCFDD0">Fourthly, In &s;uch ca&s;es of &s;urgery as require con|&s;ultation, or the u&s;e of medicines, I am willing to attend, to pre&s;cribe, con&s;ult, or advi&s;e; but not to perform any operation my&s;elf, or dre&s;s any wound.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IN REGARD TO THE APOTHECARY AND SURGEON.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be proper here to acquaint the public, that, for the better carrying on this plan into execu|tion, Mr. <HI>David Leighton,</HI> a gentleman of abilities and integrity, educated in Great-Britain both in phar|macy and &s;urgery, has accompanied me hither. To him I &s;end to make up my pre&s;criptions. But patients are allowed to choo&s;e any other apothecary to put up their medicines, or what &s;urgeon they plea&s;e for the operative part. What I expect from them is a proper compen&s;ation for my advice and attendance as a phy&s;ician. The medicines and ope|rations are to be con&s;idered as a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate charge. Mr. <HI>Leighton</HI> has imported a large a&s;&s;ortment of medicines, in which no expence has been &s;pared to have every thing of the be&s;t in its kind. They have been prepared with particular care by Me&s;&s;rs <HI>Silvanus</HI> and <HI>Timothy Bevan,</HI> Druggi&s;ts in London, who&s;e known &s;kill and reputation in that bu&s;ine&s;s are too well e&s;tabli&s;hed, both in Great-Britain and Ame|rica, to need further recommendation.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="010082_0011_0F7C94A218071B98">Mr. LEIGHTON will oblige him&s;elf to put up &s;uch pre&s;criptions as are ordered, in the be&s;t manner, and with the utmo&s;t fidelity and care, as well as at the mo&s;t moderate rate.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AS TO FEES.</HEAD>
<P>I always mean that the&s;e &s;hall be moderate, adap|ted to the circum&s;tances of this place, of the patient and the attendance he may require.</P>
<P>As a rule of conduct to &s;uch as are quite unac|quainted with the regular practice of phy&s;ic, let them inform them&s;elves what is the united expence for Medicines and attendance, as charged by the practitioners of eminence in this place. In &s;uch ca&s;es as can be exactly a&s;certained, I &s;hall require no more from them, than they would be obliged to pay to others, as in the ca&s;e of innoculation and attend|ance in the &s;mall pox; allowance being made for the Medicines. The &s;ame rule, as far as it can be ob&s;erv|ed in fevers and other di&s;orders, might be applyed.</P>
<P>PRACTITIONERS in many ca&s;es make an advan|ced charge on their Medicines, &s;o as to include for attendance. This is done to make up for the patients deficiency in fees, than which, when it is will|ful and not the effect of ignorance in the patient, no|thing can be more equitable, or more expedient, ex|cept
<PB N="v" REF="010082_0012_0F7C94A2B939DF30">
charging for attendance under its proper name. For Practitioners mu&s;t be paid for their time and at|tendance, as well as for their Medicines, under what|ever name they make the charge. Indeed the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive practice otherwi&s;e would be in&s;ufficient to &s;up|port a family in a becoming manner, as the greate&s;t part of their time is employed in vi&s;iting the &s;ick. The paying of a phy&s;ician for attendance and the apo|thecary for his Medicines apart is certainly the mo&s;t eligible mode of practice, both to patient and prac|titioner. The apothecary then, who is not obliged to &s;pend his time in vi&s;iting patients, can afford to make up medicines at a rea&s;onable price; and it is as de&s;irable, as ju&s;t in it&s;elf, that patients &s;hould al|low fees for attendance, whatever it may be thought to de&s;erve. They ought to know what it is they really pay for Medicines, and what for phy&s;ical ad|vice and attendance.</P>
<P>NOBODY, I believe, will deny that the practice of rating Medicines, at &s;uch a price as to include the charge for Medicines and attendance, is liable to gro&s;s impo&s;itions on the part of ignorant medica&s;ters, too many of whom &s;warm in every city. Patients who are kept in ignorance of what price Medicines are, con|&s;idered &s;eparately, and what is the value of phy&s;ical &s;kill and attendance, naturally think the original co&s;t of Medicines, which are comparatively cheap, to be very dear, and undervalue the &s;kill of a phy&s;ician,
<PB N="vi" REF="010082_0013_0F7C94A384E91480">
his toil of &s;tudy and his expence of time and money in his education, which have often amounted to very large &s;ums and to many years &s;pent abroad in que&s;t of knowledge, as if they were of no con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>THE levelling of all kind of practicioners &s;o much with illiterate pretenders, who have art enough to gain employ, however ill qualified in that of healing di&s;ea&s;es, has a tendency to deter per&s;ons, otherwi&s;e of ju&s;t and liberal &s;entiments, from putting them|&s;elves to a further expence to gain knowledge, than what is &s;ufficient to make money. This is to make a vile trade of phy&s;ic, in&s;tead of a noble profe&s;&s;ion, which as it certainly is, &s;o it ought to be e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>I HAVE been told more than once, upon rea&s;oninrg on the &s;ubject, that people here are u&s;ed to this me|thod and dont love to change old cu&s;toms. What is it more than to &s;ay,
<Q>"Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur</Q></P>
<P>IF people choo&s;e to be deceived, even let us keep them, in their deception."?</P>
<P>INSTEAD of making a charge of fees, I willingly leave to the patients them&s;elves to give what
<PB N="vii" REF="010082_0014_0F7C94A452B0AB00">
they plea&s;e, upon my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from further atten|dance, or as &s;oon after their recovery as &s;hall be thought convenient, without &s;pecifying any demand, unle&s;s where patients particularly require it. This I look for to prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of making a book charge of fees, which is never done in any liberal profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BY thus leaving the fee in a great mea&s;ure, of wholly, to the free will and circum&s;tances of the patient, a phy&s;ician may be employed by the mid|dling cla&s;s of people as well as the rich.</P>
<P>MANY who have no adequate notion of the true value of attendance, or what rule is ob&s;erved by o|thers, may wi&s;h rather to be directed what fee to pay for attendance, being de&s;irous on one hand, to avoid the appearance of being deficient in genero&s;ity, and on the other hand willing to recompence the phy&s;ician for his care, without unnece&s;&s;ary prodigality. Such per&s;ons, upon intimation of their de&s;ires, it is to be hoped, will always find them&s;elves fully &s;atis|fied in this particular.</P>
<P>AS to attending poor patients gratis, and giving them my be&s;t advice; I &s;hall chearfullv take my &s;hare of that kind of practice with my brethern of the faculty. For I &s;hall always e&s;teem it a favourable cir|cum&s;tance,
<PB N="viii" REF="010082_0015_0F7C94A4F7B14B30">
that puts it in my power to admini&s;ter relief to per&s;ons, who&s;e indigence forbids them to expect it upon any other terms.</P>
<P>THESE articles, I pre&s;ume, will effectually remove the objection which has been mo&s;t &s;trongly urged, viz. that my method of practice would only &s;uit the wealthy; and will prove that the expence to the patient is not greater, on the plan I have adopted, than in the common method of practice.</P>
<P>IT is true that, upon my fir&s;t arrival, I expre&s;&s;ed my de&s;ire of being paid for a certain number of vi|&s;its, at a pi&s;tole the fir&s;t vi&s;it, as a retaining fee, and a dollar for every vi&s;it afterwards.&mdash;It was not my in|tention to require more than one fee per day, although I might wait on the patient oftner, nor yet every day that I vi&s;ited once, where a di&s;ea&s;e of a lingering nature, or requiring particular care, would render my attendance expen&s;ive. A retaining fee I expected to receive from the rich, not from the poor; and had firmly re&s;olved in no ca&s;e to receive more, fees, than &s;ufficient to pay me for the value of my time and trouble of attendance. But for want of &s;uitable opportunities of rendering this better known, I daily found that my good intention was in &s;ome mea&s;ure fru&s;trated.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="010082_0016_0F7C94A5DA6DA3E8">THIS, and the advice of &s;ome judicious friends to endeavour to prevent the ill effects of prejudice, made me re&s;olve to attempt &s;uch an alteration as might be better &s;uited, at this time, to the cu&s;toms and circum&s;tances of the people.</P>
<P>THE preceeding plan I have ever &s;ince con&s;tantly followed, to my entire &s;atisfaction, and I hope to that of my patients. Truth requires of me to acknow|ledge to the public, that I have always found, as far as my practice has hitherto given me an oppor|tunity of judging, that the in&s;inuation, which has been made to deter me from this mode of practice, viz. <HI>that people are too narrow minded here, and &s;how no genero&s;ity to a phy&s;ician, only employing a doctor be|cau&s;e he is cheap or lives near to them,</HI> is utterly ground|le&s;s. In mo&s;t in&s;tances I have found their genero&s;ity has much exceeded my expectations.</P>
<P>ONE article more I have to mention under this head. It may frequently happen, in vi&s;iting my friends and acquaintance who employ me in their fa|milies, that them&s;elves, their children or &s;ervants, may have &s;light complaints, for which they would be glad to have advice, but do not think them of im|portance enough to call in a phy&s;ician, who may ex|pect fees for little ailments. Such per&s;ons may always command my advice in the&s;e ma&s;ters without a fee.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="x" REF="010082_0017_0F7C94A69B81AFE0">
<HEAD>THE NECESSITY OF REGULATING THE PRACTICE OF PHYSIC.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be readily acknowledged by every one that allows him&s;elf to reflect upon it, that &s;ome regulati|on in regard to a Phy&s;icians attendance upon the &s;ick is now become highly requi&s;ite, Formerly, when the city did not occupy much above half the extent, practice was much more manageable than it is at pre&s;ent. Living was then cheap. Within my own memory, every article of expence was le&s;s by almo&s;t one half. So that what &s;uited the circum&s;tances of the place and people then does not &s;uit them now. Yet we may believe the knowledge of Phy&s;ic has been cultivated all along with con&s;iderable appli|cation. A medical education is at lea&s;t become much more expen&s;ive, and a man has little chance, if he keeps free from empirici&s;m, to get a to|lerable living by phy&s;ic now, unle&s;s he has &s;pent &s;ome years in an expen&s;ive education in Europe. Is it not then more equitable to be paid for atten|dance, than to live by advancing the price of me|dicines?</P>
<P>I AM not urging the&s;e as arguments for a more expen&s;ive practice, but for an improvement of it, by &s;eparating phy&s;ic from &s;urgery and pharmacy, which
<PB N="xi" REF="010082_0018_0F7C94A745CE9E38">
I think incompatible with them, at lea&s;t according to the plan of education I have followed, by the ad|vice of &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent and &s;killful judges of medical &s;cience of any in Great Britain.</P>
<P>WHAT rea&s;onable objection can be then offered a|gain&s;t an improvement in the pre&s;ent method of the practice of phy&s;ic, which, to a man in great bu&s;ine&s;s, is by every one allowed to be the mo&s;t &s;lavi&s;h pro|fe&s;&s;ion known in this part of the world.</P>
<P>EVERY mechanic has a certain portion of time allot|ted to him for a relaxation from bu&s;ine&s;s, and for the enjoyment of &s;ocial happine&s;s, Phy&s;icians have next to none, but they are obliged to be at the call of the &s;ick, every hour in the night as well as of the day. Were they born &s;laves to the public and not child|ren? or, for &s;uch a voluntary &s;urrender of their liberty and ea&s;e as is nece&s;&s;ary to practi&s;e con&s;cientiou&s;]y, are they to have no compen&s;ation? Is it thought an unrea&s;onable demand to be paid for a toil&s;ome, but nece&s;&s;ary attendance, amid&s;t objects of the mo&s;t mov|ing di&s;tre&s;s, which deprives them much of the com|pany of their own family and of a number of gra|tifications, which every other profe&s;&s;ion allows of without detriment? Where is the encouragement for a man to bani&s;h him&s;elf from all the endearing tyes of friends and relations, to &s;pend the prime of
<PB N="xii" REF="010082_0019_0F7C94A80296FAA8">
life, and often the bulk of his fortune, to admini&s;ter more &s;killful aid to the calamities of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fel|low mortals, if he is to be con&s;idered as entitled only to the &s;ame gratuity with tho&s;e who employ all their time at home, in getting money, in&s;tead of &s;pending it for the public good? or is he to be al|lowed no more, than if, in acquiring this knowledge, he had been &s;upported at a public expence?&mdash;let unbia&s;&s;ed rea&s;on and ju&s;tice determine.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry that the objections, which have been made to my propo&s;ed method of practice, have laid me under the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity of mentioning the kind of education I have had to qualify me for my profe&s;&s;ion, and to afford me a rea&s;onable expectation of a living from my advice and attendance.</P>
<P>IT is now more than fifteen years &s;ince I began the &s;tudy of medicine in this city, which I have pro&s;ecuted ever &s;ince without interruption. During the fir&s;t &s;ix years I &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip with Dr. JOHN REDMAN, who then did, and &s;tills continues to enjoy a mo&s;t ju&s;tly acquired reputation in this city for &s;uperior knowledge and exten&s;ive practice in phy&s;ic. At the &s;ame time I had an opportunity of being acquainted with the practice of other eminent phy&s;icians in this place, particularly of all the phy|&s;icians
<PB N="xiii" REF="010082_0020_0F7C94A8B497DA18">
to the ho&s;pital, who&s;e pre&s;criptions I put up there above the &s;pace of one year. The term of my apprentice&s;hip being expired, I devoted my&s;elf for four years to a military life, principally with a view to become more &s;killful in my profe&s;&s;ion; being engaged, the whole of that time, in a very exten&s;ive practice in the army, among&s;t di&s;ea&s;es of every kind. The la&s;t five years I have &s;pent in Europe, under the mo&s;t celebrated ma&s;ters in every branch of Medicine, and &s;pared no labour or expence to &s;tore my mind with an exten&s;ive acquaintance in every &s;cience, that rela|ted any way to the duty of a phy&s;ician; having in that time expended, in this pur&s;uit, a &s;um of money, of which the very intere&s;t would prove no contempti|ble income. With what &s;ucce&s;s this has been done others are to judge, and not my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus I have arrived at the middle age of life, in en|deavouring to lay up trea&s;ures of u&s;eful knowledge, before I commence a &s;ettled practice; and yet I have been told, that to expect to gain a &s;upport here by my medical advice and attendance only, without be|coming a &s;urgeon and apothecary too in order to help out, is to forget that I was born an American. I am very happy that my country has always di&s;co|vered too much of a laudable ambition to excell in every branch of polite literature, and has taken too much plea&s;ure in the reputation of her &s;ons, to fill
<PB N="xiv" REF="010082_0021_0F7C94ABB60A2310">
me with apprehen&s;ion that an education in phy&s;ic will be accounted too expen&s;ive, &s;uch as I have thought nece&s;&s;ary to qualify my&s;elf for practi&s;ing my profe&s;&s;ion with ea&s;e of mind to my&s;elf and with benefit to the community.</P>
<P>As far as I can learn, every body approves of my plan for in&s;tituting medical &s;chools, and I have the honour of being appointed a public profe&s;&s;or for teaching, phy&s;ic in the college here. Can any man, the lea&s;t acquainted with the nature of that arduous ta&s;k, once imagine it po&s;&s;ible for me to acquit my&s;elf in that &s;tation, in an honourable or u&s;eful manner, and yet be engaged in one continued round of practice in &s;urgery and pharmacy, as well as phy&s;ic?</P>
<P>To prepare for a cour&s;e of lectures every year re|quires &s;ome lei&s;ure, and a mind undi&s;turbed with too great a variety of pur&s;uits. So that my u&s;efulne&s;s as a profe&s;&s;or makes it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for me to follow that method of practice, which alone appears to be calculated to an&s;wer that end.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quick caren altern&acirc; requie durabile nen e&s;t, Haec reparat virez, fe&s;&s;aque membra novat.</NOTE></P>

<HEAD>ON THE ADVANTAGES OF A SEPARATE AND REGULAR PRACTICE OF PHYSIC, SURGERY AND PHARMACY.</HEAD>
<P>In the more laborious occupation of life, as in building a hou&s;e or a &s;hip, a great variety as well as a great number of artizans are employed, but all in different departments.</P>
<P>IN the le&s;s laborious callings we ob&s;erve the like prudent regulations, thus in making a pipe, a button or a pin, a variety of hands, no le&s;s commonly than five, &s;ix, or &s;even different arti&s;ts unite their indu&s;|try. By this means they fin&s;h more work in a li|mited time, and can afford to &s;ell it at a cheaper rate, than they could, if every individual was employed in all the &s;eparate branches. But each having a par|ticular province a&s;&s;igned to him&s;elf, while all con&s;pire in one uniform plan, they become more &s;killful and dextrous in their re&s;pective parts, and all more u&s;e|fully &s;ub&s;ervient to one end. Are the good qualities of accuracy, di&s;patch and cheapne&s;s, not to &s;peak of the greater perfection of the work, no recommenda|tion to the manner of doing it?</P>
<P>WHY &s;hould the more difficult, but more ingeni|ous and liberal arts, &s;corn to be taught wi&s;dom from their example? Is it ea&s;ier to under&s;tand the
<PB N="xvi" REF="010082_0023_0F7C94AD3504F3C8">
intricate &s;tructure of the animal frame, the work of God, than to learn the con&s;truction of any machine, as a watch or clock, the work of human invention? Or are the &s;prings and movements of the former, &s;o divinely adju&s;ted, more ea&s;ily managed and put to rights when in di&s;order, than the wheels of the lat|ter? or does the pre&s;ervation of this in a &s;ound &s;tate require le&s;s &s;tudy, knowledge, and conduct?</P>
<P>THE human body is certainly one of the mo&s;t com|pound machines in nature. Medicine is one of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t difficult of arts, made up of a number of &s;ciences different from each other. The practice of phy&s;ic requires deliberation, rea&s;oning, judge|ment, and experience. Surgery calls for different powers and qualifications rarely uniting in one man. Are the&s;e then all to be blended with the apothecary, the botani&s;t, and chymi&s;t, which ought to be, and are each of them &s;eparate and di&s;tinct in their very nature? Whil&s;t we labour amid&s;t &s;uch a variety of pur&s;uits, all improvement mu&s;t be at a &s;tand. Where|as, let each cultivate his re&s;pective branch apart, the phy&s;ician, &s;urgeon, apothecary &amp;c. the knowledge of medicine will be then daily improved, and it may be practi&s;ed with greater accuracy and &s;kill as well as a le&s;s expence.</P>
<P>PREJUDICE may here a&s;k, how can a phy&s;ician practi&s;e with advantage, if he does not equally pur|&s;ue
<PB N="xvii" REF="010082_0024_0F7C94ADFB6A6360">
every branch of his profe&s;&s;on? or how &s;hall he know that the Medicines are good, which he orders, if he does hot prepare them him&s;elf?</P>
<P>ANSWER, It is not only expedient, but nece&s;&s;ary that a phy&s;ician &s;hould have a general and exten&s;ive knowledge of the whole art, and be acquainted with the principles of every branch of his profe&s;&s;ion. Thus the general of an army &s;hould be acquainted with every part of military &s;cience, and under&s;tand the whole detail of military duty, from that of colo|nel down to a private centinel. But there is no need that he &s;hould act as a pioneer and dig in a trench. Where a proper &s;ubordination is wanting, there is a perver&s;ion of all practical knowledge. No more then is a phy&s;ician obliged, from his office, to handle a knife with a &s;urgeon; to cull herbs with the bota|ni&s;t; to di&s;till &s;imples with the chymi&s;t; or com|pound drugs with the apothecary. Can he be more &s;ure however that his Medicines are genuine, if he does not collect his own herbs and roots as a botani&s;t, or di&s;till with the chymi&s;t, than he can, if, omitting the&s;e, he &s;hould &s;tick to the plai&s;ter-pan and &s;patula, or the pe&s;tle and mortar?</P>
<P>BUT practitioners in great bu&s;ine&s;s never do, or can do the bu&s;ine&s;s of an apothecary in this place, them&s;elves. They have apprentices for
<PB N="xviii" REF="010082_0025_0F7C94AED48DB030">
the purpo&s;e. After vi&s;iting the &s;ick, do not their apprentices make up their pre&s;criptions? I would a&s;k, is not an apothecary thoroughly acquainted with the art of compounding and making up Medicines as &s;killful in it as an apprentice? Is not a man educa|ted in the profe&s;&s;ion to be tru&s;ted in preference to one who is only learning that bu&s;ine&s;s? or has the ma&s;ter, who may be called from place to place to attend other ca&s;es of &s;urgery, or &s;ee other patients, always time to wait for medicines to be made up under his eye?</P>
<P>THESE queries are ea&s;y enough for every one to decide upon, without being brought up to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic. Will he not therefore do a worthy action, whoever &s;hall &s;teadily apply him&s;elf to remove the difficulties which are in the way of regular practice? Will he not do real &s;ervice to his country and man|kind, for the good effects of which po&s;terity may thank him? Who then would he&s;itate to rank him&s;elf among&s;t the foremo&s;t cla&s;s of tho&s;e who &s;hall be con|cerned in a work of &s;uch real benefit to the public?</P>
<P>HAVING thus fully explained the method I pro|po&s;e for practi&s;ing phy&s;ic in this place, I appeal to the impartial judgment of the public to decide upon the que&s;tion. Is it to be deemed an idle innova|vation, or is it not rather an improvement of practice in Philadelphia, to adopt a plan conformable to what is ob&s;erved in great Britain and all poli&s;hed countries,
<PB N="xix" REF="010082_0026_0F7C94AF79250740">
as far as the circum&s;tances of this place admit? I pro|fe&s;s my&s;elf open to conviction, and &s;hall allow due weight to every rea&s;onable argument that may be op|po&s;ed to my plan. When I am rationally convinced that I have been in an error, I &s;hall readily acknow|ledge and retract my &s;entiments, which I hope, till then, I may be allowed to continue, without being charged with an innovating &s;pirit.</P>
<P>WHAT remains yet to be done is to endeavour to elucidate a few pa&s;&s;ages, which have been thought exceptionable in the di&s;cour&s;e by particular per&s;ons.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome paragraphs, the opinions and practice of the faculty of phy&s;ic in this place have been thought to have been too indi&s;criminately condemned.</P>
<P>FAR be it from me to merit this charge, or to have entertained &s;entiments derogatory from a &s;et of gen|tlemen, many of whom I rank among&s;t my principle friends in the city, and highly e&s;teem for their inte|grity and abilities in their profe&s;&s;ion, to which they do great honour. To have made a nominal di&s;tinc|tion was never my de&s;ign. It cannot therefore in ju&s;tice be imputed to me as a fault to have avoided, all I could, every thing which had the lea&s;t appear|ance of particularity, and to have endeavoured to &s;ugge&s;t an improvement of practice, without aiming at practitioners.</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="010082_0027_0F7C94B053E83CB8">I DOUBT not that every practitioner here of edu|cation, experience and integrity, has pur&s;ued the plan which, in his opinion, was be&s;t &s;uited to the place and people. But as circum&s;tances alter, &s;o does the propriety of particular e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms, which gradually give way to others better &s;uited to tho&s;e changes which happen in a cour&s;e of years. May I not hope to meet with the &s;ame candour that I &s;how to others, and be admitted to act from the &s;ame hone&s;t principles, in recommending what I think an improvement of practice, that I allow tho&s;e who have pur&s;ued a plan different from mine?</P>
<P>WHEREVER there is the lea&s;t appearance of being particular, or wherever I have &s;poken expre&s;sly of the practitioners of this town, it has been in the mo&s;t becoming manner and without the lea&s;t cen&s;ure, well knowing how much I my&s;elf need the indulgence of others.</P>
<P>"Mecum habito et novi quam &s;it mihi curta &s;uppellex."</P>
<P>IN confirmation hereof, I &s;hall adduce a few in&s;tan|ces to which the reader may refer. Thus I have &s;aid, p. 18. "and here we may congratulate our|&s;elves, that in this, and &s;ome of the large neighbour|ing towns, we have a number of &s;killful phy&s;icians
<PB N="xxi" REF="010082_0028_0F7C94B108750618">
and expert &s;urgeons, qualified by genius, education and experience, to take charge of the health of their fellow creatures." And p 30. "The city of Phila|delphia, adorned with a &s;et of eminent practitioner draws to it a great number of pupils, from the neighbouring parts, to learn the arts of phy&s;ic and &s;urgery." Indeed the only part in which I have been particular, and there it was unavoidable, is in &s;peak|ing of the phy&s;icians of the ho&s;pital, which I have done in terms of the highe&s;t re&s;pect. p. 31.</P>
<P>It is true, I have endeavoured, as well as I was able, lo de&s;cribe the mi&s;chievous effects that en&s;ue from ignorance and pre&s;umption, when young men enter upon the practice of Medicine before they are duly in&s;ructed in the important duties of the pro|fe&s;&s;ion, See p. 23. 24.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e urged the nece&s;&s;ity of joining &s;tudy with practice, and availing our&s;elves of the medical di&s;coveries and improvements made by others. On the authority of a very learned &s;ociety, I have al&s;o di&s;|approved of the conduct of tho&s;e, who, from preju|dice affecting a &s;implicity, (which might often mi&s;|lead them) di&s;dain tho&s;e per&s;ons who divide their time between &s;tudy and practice. I have likewi&s;e ad|ded, on the &s;ame authority, that novices enlightened by the di&s;coveries, which the&s;e practitioners &s;hut
<PB N="xxii" REF="010082_0029_0F7C94B1F80840E8">
their eyes again&s;t, would in their turn with rea&s;on de&s;pi&s;e them, when grown old in their errors," &s;ee p. 42 and 47.</P>
<P>BUT I have no where intentionally aimed the &s;haft of cen&s;ure at any one, or attempted the character of a particular man; much le&s;s have I dared to attack indi&s;|criminately a whole body of men. As far as I have en|gaged in painting the errors or faults of any, I have endeavoured to repre&s;ent general actions of men, &s;uch as they are, and not the picture of individuals. Yet, as <HI>Le Sage</HI> has ju&s;tly remarked, there are &s;ome per&s;ons who cannot read, and I &s;ay there are others who can|not hear, without making an application of tho&s;e vici|ous or ridiculous characters which they learn from an author. With him I declare to all who have &s;uch a malicious propen&s;ity, that they are in the wrong to apply the portraits which they may find here exhibit|ted; nor let any reader take for his own what may equally belong to another, otherwi&s;e he will fooli&s;hly expo&s;e him&s;elf, as Phaedrus &s;ays,
<Q>"Stult&eacute; nudabit animi con&s;cientiam."</Q></P>
<P>THE notice I have here given is, I hope, &s;uffici|ent therefore to exculpate me from the groundle&s;s charge of having unju&s;tly reflected upon, or cen&s;ured the conduct of others,</P>
<P><PB N="xxiii" REF="010082_0030_0F7C94B275AAD0B8">SOME, It is &s;aid, have thought, that I have de|&s;cribed the difficulties of attaining to the knowledge of phy&s;ic in too &s;trong terms, and have enumerated &s;o many qualifications as requi&s;ite to acquire any con|&s;iderable knowledge of the medical art, that I rather deter &s;tudents, than encourage them in attempting to compleat their &s;tudics and to become &s;killful in their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e I reply, that I have been far from exag|gerating matters, and have le&s;t much un&s;aid, on purpo&s;e to avoid di&s;couraging their eager pur&s;uit. If we cannot arrive at ab&s;olute perfection in &s;cience, let us not abandon our&s;elves to a criminal indolence, but &s;trive to approach that degree of knowledge which is attainable by indu&s;try, and we cannot fail of being eminently &s;killful in the healing art and highly u&s;eful to mankind.</P>
<P>OTHERS, I am informed, as if they were afraid of engaging in too great an expence, have &s;aid that I have in&s;i&s;ted too much on the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tudents attending lectures in every different branch of medi|cine. They &s;eem to imagine if they hear lectures upon Anatomy only, the branch which I have fir&s;t mentioned in my di&s;cour&s;e, that they can ea&s;ily make them&s;elves matters of all the other branches of medicine by reading. I blu&s;h for tho&s;e who thus
<PB N="xxiv" REF="010082_0031_0F7C94B5AC6451A0">
expo&s;e either their ignorance or their avarice. Why are fhey not equally contented with &s;uch a &s;hare of knowledge in anatomy, as they can gain from books, &s;ince this &s;cience can be better painted to the eye, than &s;ome of the other branches of medicine, which are altogether as nece&s;&s;ary to be known by a phy|&s;ician? Are not anatomical plates and de&s;cripti|ons as intelligible to a &s;tudent, as the philo&s;ophical &s;tudies of chymi&s;try, phy&s;iology, and pathology are, from a mere cour&s;e of reading? or is it of le&s;s con&s;e|quence to gain a &s;y&s;tematic knowledge of the mate|ria medica, or practice of medicine, than of anatomy, which is of no other u&s;e to a phy&s;ician than as it contributes its &s;hare towards explaining what di&s;ea&s;es are? The others furni&s;h him with the means and manner of performing the cure, and require, at lea&s;t, as much labour and explanation as anatomy it&s;elf demands.</P>
<P>THE worthy and learned Doctor Lewis is of opi|nion, "that the medicinal hi&s;tory, or the knowledge of the powers and effects of medicine in the human body, though apparently a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential branch of the healing art, has been far more incuriou&s;ly culti|vated, and &s;till perhaps continues le&s;s cleared from the errors of former ages than any other &s;cience." Another writer on the &s;ame &s;ubject &s;ays, "it is an idle &s;uppo&s;ition to &s;et out upon, that there are the
<PB N="xxv" REF="010082_0032_0F7C94B69A749D10">
works of good chymi&s;ts and good naturali&s;ts extant, and that from tho&s;e a &s;ufficient &s;y&s;tem of information on this important head may be compiled. To com|pile with judgement requires as much knowledge of the &s;ubject as to write well upon it. No man is qua|lified to execute this to advantage, who is not able to have written what he borrows. Even the be&s;t and mo&s;t authentic books on the&s;e &s;ubjects have their er|rors, mo&s;t of them too many; and while he who is him&s;elf defficient in the knowledge of the &s;ubject, can|not but be liable to take in the&s;e with the re&s;t, it is evident what &s;ort of dapendance ought to be placed on his collections."</P>
<P>WHATEVER anatomical &s;kill a man may boa&s;t, yet if he is ignorant of the virtues of Medicines, or of their changes from differently compounding them together, or knows not what are the true indications in the cure, or relief of di&s;ea&s;es, he may value him|&s;elf for expertne&s;s in diffection, but every &s;en&s;ible man will hold him cheap as a phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>NOBODY, who is anxious to be &s;killful in the divine art of healing, will be a niggard of the nece&s;&s;ary trou|ble and expence of rendering him&s;elf intelligent in every thing his profe&s;&s;ion requires he &s;hould know. Whoever is &s;paring of the&s;e has no cau&s;e of complaint, if he is rewarded only according to his merit, unle&s;s
<PB N="xxvi" REF="010082_0033_0F7C94B6F63E2390">
he would invert &s;cripture and the laws of rea&s;on, and ca&s;ting his eyes on tho&s;e who have &s;owed plentifully in knowledge and reaped but little pecuniary ad|vantage from thence, think, from &s;owing &s;par|ingly, he has a better title to expect that his igno|rance &s;hould be rewarded with a bountiful harved.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE TRUSTEES <HI>Of the</HI> COLLEGE, AND THE CITIZENS <HI>Of</HI> PHILADELPHIA.</HEAD>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>THE cultivation of Science, and the progre&s;s of arts have ju&s;tly merited the regard of every age and country. I e&s;teem my&s;elf happy, therefore, that I have an opportunity of delivering my &s;entiments before &s;o candid and learned an audi|ence, upon a &s;ubject which re&s;pects the advance|ement of the mo&s;t u&s;eful knowledge, and the grow|ing credit of this in&s;titution;&mdash;a &s;ubject as import|ant as can well be imagined to employ our &s;erious deliberation, or animate our warme&s;t pur&s;uit.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="010082_0037_0F7C94BA04EB71F8">WHAT I am to propo&s;e is a &s;cheme for tran&s;plant|ing <HI>Medical Science</HI> into this &s;eminary, and for the improvement of every branch of the healing art.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that in a knowledge of the &s;upreme <HI>Being,</HI> and of the duties which we owe to him, con&s;i&s;ts the <HI>&s;ublime</HI> of true philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>THIS is the mo&s;t intere&s;ting pur&s;uit of rational creatures, as it regards the &s;oul and con&s;titutes the highe&s;t happine&s;s.</P>
<P>A KNOWLEDGE of the duties which we owe to &s;o|ciety, re&s;ulting from the relation in which we &s;tand to one another, is an object of the next importance. After this, whatever relates to the welfare of the bo|dy de&s;erves our mo&s;t immediate concern.&mdash;Life, when burdened with di&s;ea&s;e, is but a complication of woes. Health is that choice &s;ea&s;oning which gives a reli&s;h to all our enjoyments. As the end of medical &s;cience is to re&s;tore and pre&s;erve health, the welfare of every individual, of whatever age or &s;ex, is concerned in the improvement of it among&s;t them.</P>
<P>MEDICINE is a &s;cience as important in its object, as it is difficult in the acqui&s;ition. It is very exten|&s;ive in its re&s;earches, and pre&s;uppo&s;es the knowledge of many other &s;ciences. The cultivation of it re|quires
<PB N="3" REF="010082_0038_0F7C94BD80AF79E0">

<P>A THIRST of knowledge and a &s;pirit of inquiry are natural to man. It merits our endeavours to direct the&s;e to worthy objects.

<P><HI>ANATOMY, taken in a general &s;en&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts in know|ing the &s;tructure of the animal body; con&s;idered in parti|cular, it implies a knowledge of the frame and organization of the human body.</HI> It teaches of what kind of &s;ub|&s;tance all the parts are compo&s;ed; it &s;hews their fi|gure, texture, firmne&s;s, connection, and relation to each other.

<P>IT is Anatomy that guides the doubtful &s;tep of the young votary of medicine through an ob&s;cure laby|rinth, where a variety of minute objects pre&s;ent them&s;elves in &s;uch a group as, at fir&s;t, to perplex his imagination. It is Anatomy which unravels the fir&s;t difficulties in his pur&s;uit; it lays open to his view the diver&s;ity of parts, their combination, di&s;|po&s;ition,

&s;ubordination, and movements.

<P>IN &s;hort, Anatomy is to be e&s;teemed one of the principal pillars, on which we are to rai&s;e the &s;upper|&s;tructure of medical &s;cience, as well phy&s;ic as &s;ur|gery.

<P>CAN any one pretend to &s;tile him&s;elf a <HI>Surgeon,</HI> or to perform any operation with &s;afety, if he knows not the &s;tructure of the part he is to operate upon? If he is ignorant of the mu&s;cles which give it mo|tion, or of the nerves which give it &s;en&s;ation, by cut|ting through the tendon of a mu&s;cle, or by dividing &s;ome principal nerve, he may forever deprive the pati|ent of life, or movement in the part. If he knows not the cour&s;e and di&s;tribution of its ve&s;&s;els, he may wound &s;ome con&s;iderable artery, and from the lo&s;s of blood may occa&s;ion dangerous accidents.

<P><PB N="8" REF="010082_0043_0F7C94C29C3D4368">WITH what propriety can any one arrogate to him&s;elf the title of <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> if he is ignorant of Ana|tomy? how &s;hall he be able to di&s;cover the &s;eat of a di&s;ea&s;e, or what chance has he of being in a condi|tion to remedy it? Nor is a &s;uperficial acquaintance with Anatomy &s;ufficient for either Phy&s;ician or Sur|geon. The latter, (that he may not mi&s;take what is natural for a di&s;ea&s;e, and in attempting to relieve an imaginary evil, bring on a real one;) ought to know the &s;malle&s;t hollow or protuberance of a bone; which &s;erve in many in&s;tances to direct him, how far he may operate with &s;afety, as the &s;ituation of the nerves and blood ve&s;&s;els are often to be referred to them.

<P>THE <HI>Materia Medica and Botany may very properly be termed the natural hi&s;tory of medicine,</HI> as from the&s;e branches of &s;cience we derive our knowledge of that part of natural hi&s;tory, which more immediately
<PB N="9" REF="010082_0044_0F7C94C310069D88">
relates to the health giving arts. How worthy of a Phy&s;ician, a Philo&s;opher or a Gentleman, is the knowledge of the different productions of na|ture taken in its full extent? I cannot too earne&s;tly recommend this &s;tudy to young men, to qualify them for every u&s;eful profe&s;&s;ion that is conver&s;ant about natural objects, and e&s;pecially for the &s;tudy of medicine. But it behoves me to &s;peak more parti|cularly of medical natural hi&s;tory, if I may be allowed to adopt that term in the &s;en&s;e I have already u&s;ed it; and fir&s;t of Materia Mediea.</P>
<P><HI>MATERIA MEDICA treats of the natural hi&s;tory, and medical virtues, of all tho&s;e bodies which are employed in diet, or in medicine.</HI> It con&s;iders the changes they undergo when applied to the human body, either internally or externally; and the effects they pro|duce on the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>IT is beyond contradiction an object of great im|portance, to both Phy&s;ician and Surgeon, to be well acquainted with the Materia Medica, as it belongs to this to con&s;ider the nature of aliments, the choice of medicines, and a knowledge of their action in the ve&s;&s;els, and how they pre&s;erve or re&s;tore health.</P>
<P>PHYSIOLOGY, Pathology, Chymi&s;try, the Materia Medica, and indeed the &s;everal branches of medi|cine lend a mutual aid to one another, in a greater or le&s;s degree.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010082_0045_0F7C94C3CAA2ABE8"><HI>BOTANY is a knowlege of the natural hi&s;tory of vegetables.</HI> It may therefore be con&s;idered as part of the Materia Medica, as far at lea&s;t, as it is con|nected with the knowledge of medicine.</P>
<P>BY the Science of Botany we learn to methodize the vegetable part of the creation, and to range ve|getables in different cla&s;&s;es, &s;ubdividing them into a variety of orders, genera, and &s;pecies. Such a &s;y&s;te|matic, or botanic arrangement, as it is called, has taught us this general ob&s;ervation, that all plants of the &s;ame natural order have in a degree &s;ome com|mon virtue. Botany thus le&s;&s;ens the difficulties we mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been at in di&s;covering their me|dical virtues. I need not therefore dwell on the im|portance of this &s;tudy to a Phy&s;ician and a Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P><HI>CHYMISTRY</HI> is either Philo&s;ophic, or Pharma|ceutic. The former con&s;iders the particular pro|perties of bodies, and explains their effects. It is di&s;tingui&s;hed from natural philo&s;ophy, as this latter is only conver&s;ant about the general properties of bodies.</P>
<P><HI>PHARMACEUTIC CHYMISTRY, is that branch of philo&s;phic Chymi&s;try, which regards the particular properties of &s;uch bodies as are appropri|ated to medicine.</HI> It con&s;iders their virtues in a &s;imple &s;tate, or tho&s;e which they acquire by combination,
<PB N="11" REF="010082_0046_0F7C94C475771A70">
and in this has a clo&s;e connection with the Materia Medica.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed but few &s;ub&s;tances which are u&s;ed as Medicines, &s;imply and &s;ingly, in their natu|ral &s;tate; but they are commonly compounded by art. As it belongs to Pharmaceutic Chymi&s;try to treat of the &s;eparation of the parts of medicinal &s;ub&s;tances from one another, and of the new properties ari&s;ing from the compo&s;ition or re&s;olution of tho&s;e bodies, it is manife&s;t that this &s;cience is of e&s;&s;ential u&s;e. What|ever &s;kill we may boa&s;t in inve&s;tigating the nature of a di&s;ea&s;e, or in under&s;tanding the &s;tructure of the body, yet without a knowledge of the in&s;truments which are to be u&s;ed, and of their properties and ac|tion upon the body, whereby they produce a change from &s;ickne&s;s to health, other knowledge avails little in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>THE THEORY of PHYSIC,</HI> more commonly termed Medical In&s;titutions, comprehends under it, the important doctrines of Phy&s;iology and Pathology.</P>
<P><HI>PHYSIOLOGY</HI> teaches the u&s;es of the &s;everal parts in the human body, it treats of all the functi|ons, vital, animal, and natural, in a &s;ound &s;tate. The illu&s;trious <HI>Haller</HI> very properly denominates it <HI>anima|ted Anatomy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="010082_0047_0F7C94C5421DABF8">IT is the application of natural philo&s;ophy to Ana|tomy, and may very well be defined <HI>A philo&s;ophic knowledge of the human body, or a &s;cience of all the conditions ari&s;ing from the &s;tructure of its parts.</HI> It has a foundation both in Anatomy and Philo&s;ophy.&mdash;Anatomy, in a more limited view, con&s;iders the &s;tructure of the dead body only; but Phy&s;iology teaches the functions of the living body. The di&s;|tinction will be more ea&s;ily apprehended from ob&s;erv|ing, that a per&s;on may be a good practical Anato|mi&s;t, and yet be ignorant of Phyf&s;ology; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to be a good Phy&s;iologi&s;t, without be|ing an able Anatomi&s;t.</P>
<P>THE great &s;tock of literature, as well as genius, which is requi&s;ite to become an adept in this &s;cience, and the important nature of the &s;ubject it treats of, point out its dignity and excellency.</P>
<P>AS every di&s;ea&s;e we labour under is a di&s;order of the vital, animal, or natural functions; a thorough acquaintance with the&s;e in their &s;ound &s;tate is implied before we can pretend to under&s;tand their morbid affections, or how to remedy them.</P>
<P>PHYSIOLOGY gives us the cleare&s;t light in the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, which is the grand object of all our inqui|ries in medicine. The &s;tudy of it is mo&s;t entertain|ing, and engages our clo&s;e&s;t attention from the many curious &s;ubjects with which it abounds.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="010082_0048_0F7C94C6155019B8"><HI>PATHOLOGY treats of the vital, animal, and natu|ral functions in a morbid &s;tate, as Phy&s;iology does in a &s;ound healthful condition.</HI> It traces out the &s;eat of di&s;|ea&s;es, examines their cau&s;es and effects, &s;hews their differences, explains their &s;ymptoms, and all the dif|ferent phoenomena, which re&s;ult from various affect|tions of the &s;y&s;tem, it progno&s;ticates the event, and indicates the general method of treatment. In &s;hort, it forms a &s;y&s;tem of precepts in the art of healing. It is the immediate guide to practice, and a very capital part of medical knowledge.</P>
<P>THE &s;malle&s;t reflection is &s;ufficient to di&s;cover the intimate connection of Phy&s;iolgy and Pathology, and the &s;ub&s;erviency of the former to the latter.</P>
<P>LET no man lay claim to the dignified title of <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> who is not thoroughly conver&s;ant in the medical in&s;titutions. Without this know|ledge, we have no better right to take upon us the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, than <HI>a blind man to judge of co|lours, or a deaf man of &s;ounds.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THE PRAXIS, or PRACTICE OF MEDI|CINE, is immediately conver&s;ant about di&s;ea&s;es them|&s;elves, and treats in the mo&s;t particular manner of their nature, &s;pecific difference, their cau&s;es and &s;ymptoms, and e&s;pecially the method of curing them, or alleviating the &s;everity of them when incurable.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="010082_0049_0F7C94C82C4B6E88">THIS part therefore, as it teaches us the univer|&s;al application of the precepts derived from a ju&s;t rea&s;oning and accurate ob&s;ervations made upon di&s;ea&s;es, is unque&s;tionably to be accounted the fi|ni&s;hing part of Medicine.</P>
<P>As the end of our pur&s;uits is more noble than the means, the importance and dignity of practice are therefore evident; and in as far as the knowledge of the other branches are not con&s;idered in &s;ub&s;er|viency to this, they are merely &s;peculative; though they mu&s;t be allowed to afford a &s;peculation of a very &s;ublime nature.</P>
<P>MEDICAL Science is one whole, of which all the branches I have enumerated are the &s;everal parts. They may be con&s;idered as the links of a chain that have a mutual connection with one another. Ana|tomy, Materia Medica, Botany, Chymi&s;try, and the In&s;titutions, are only the ladder by which we are to mount up to practice, A general knowledge, at lea&s;t, in each one of them, is u&s;eful to both Phy&s;ici|an and Surgeon; particularly to the former, who in proportion as he is more intimately acquainted with them all, will become more &s;killful in the heal|ing &s;cience. For, although he confines him&s;elf to his proper province of pre&s;cribing for di&s;ea&s;es, yet ought he to under&s;tand the principles of the entire art, and more e&s;pecially he ought to be very con|ver&s;ant
<PB N="15" REF="010082_0050_0F7C94C906BADAC8">
in practice. Seeing the life and health of mankind is the object of medicine, ignorance of the practice is a grand defect in a Phy&s;ician, and an un|pardonable crime, as attended with irreparable in|juries.</P>
<P>THE great extent of medical &s;cience, which com|prehends under it &s;o many different branches, makes it impo&s;&s;ible to learn it thoroughly without we fo|llow a certain order. Whil&s;t we neglect this, all our ideas are but crude conceptions, a rope of &s;and, without any firm connection. Should the &s;tudent, as chance or whim might direct, &s;ometimes apply him&s;elf to one branch, &s;ometimes to another; or read indi&s;criminately even the be&s;t authors on the differ|rent parts of Medicine; for want of method, all his knowledge would be &s;uperficial; though he might take as much pains as would &s;uffice to make him eminently &s;killful, had he from the beginning pur|&s;ued a well concerted plan. What progre&s;s could we make in Mathematics, if we did not proceed &s;tep by &s;tep, and in a certain order?</P>
<P>THE knowledge of the more intricate and hidden truths of &s;cience are to be developed by degrees. We can only arrive at them by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other more obvious truths, which they are connected with, and which lead us to them by a certain chain of facts, ob&s;ervations, and ju&s;t deductions in a train

of &s;trict rea&s;oning. Medical truths ri&s;e out of one another, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, like the propo&s;itions of Euclid. If we did not under&s;tand the demon&s;tration of the fir&s;t, we &s;hould not be able to percieve the proof of the more intricate ones that follow, which can only be explained by means of them, as a certainty of the latter depends upon the evidence of the former. What would require years of &s;tudy to gain a &s;upper|ficial acquaintance with, if we followed no ju&s;t plan, may be attained within as few months, by pur&s;u|ing a regular &s;y&s;tem; &s;o much does method con|tribute to facilitate our progre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE order which I would recommend in the &s;tudy of Medicine is to begin with Anatomy; then what I have called medical natural Hi&s;tory, viz. The Materia Medica and Botany; Chymi&s;try &s;hould follow; the In&s;titutes come next; and the Study of Practice &s;hould compleat the work.</P>
<P>THUS I have &s;ketched out a general plan of &s;tu|dying Medicine, which it will be of the highe&s;t|con&s;equence for &s;tudents to ob&s;erve. It belongs to the teachers of the &s;everal branches, to give more minute directions with regard to the particular con|duct of each re&s;pective one.

they can receive from the languages, and the liberal arts. Latin and Greek are very nece&s;&s;ary to be known by a Phy&s;ician. The latter contains the rich original trea&s;ures of ancient medical &s;cience, and of the fir&s;t parents of the healing arts. The former contains all the wealth of more modern lite|rature. It is the vehicle of knowledge in which the learned men of every nation in Europe choo&s;e to convey their &s;entiments, and communicate their di&s;coveries to the world. As it is the be&s;t known of the dead languages, it is cho&s;en as the mo&s;t proper one, by the various nations of Europe, for a medium of intercour&s;e among&s;t the learned, that is equally attainable by every one of them Hence it be|comes indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for a Phy&s;ician, who is to derive his knowledge from &s;o many different &s;ources, to be well acquainted with Latin.</P>
<P>THE French language has prevailed much in Eu|rope. The advantages which we may reap from the writings of many eminent men, and of many learned &s;ocieties, which are publi&s;hed in French, make the knowledge of this language very valuable al&s;o to a Phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>AN acquaintance with Mathematics and natural Philo&s;ophy we cannot di&s;pen&s;e with, &s;ince we can go but &s;mall lengths in natural or medical inquiries without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Happy are we to

<P>THERE is no art yet known which may not con|tribute &s;omewhat to the improvement of Medicine; nor is there any one which requires more a&s;&s;i&s;tance than that of Phy&s;ic from every other &s;cience.

They are nece&s;&s;ary to facilitate a pro|gre&s;s in the healing arts; they embelli&s;h the under|&s;tanding, and give many peculiar advantages, unat|tainable without them.</P>
<P>So much being &s;aid of the nature of medical know|ledge, we are the better prepared to form a judg|ment on the &s;ubject propo&s;ed. Let us now take a general view of the &s;tate of Phy&s;ic as hitherto prac|ti&s;ed in America.</P>
<P>AND here we may congratulate our&s;elves, that in this, and &s;ome of the large neighbouring towns, we have a number of &s;killful phy&s;icians and expert &s;urgeons, qualified by genius, education, and expe|rience, to take charge of the health of their fellow

<P>IF, as I before ob&s;erved, it is nece&s;&s;ary that a plan be marked out for directing Students, and that they &s;hould be taught a regular cour&s;e of every di&s;tinct branch of Medicine; the infant &s;tate of the co|lonies, and the want of profe&s;&s;ed teachers, have hi|therto cloged medical pur&s;uits in America with in|numerable ob&s;tacles.</P>

of Edinburgh afford a remarkable in&s;tance. With|in the &s;pace of little more than forty years, the pre|&s;ent profe&s;&s;or&s;hips in Medicine were fir&s;t formed. A few gentlemen from Scotland, then pro&s;ecuting their medical &s;tudies at Leyden, concerted a plan, and undertook, them&s;elves, the important charge of in&s;tituting &s;chools for teaching the various branches of Medicine. They met with countenance and &s;up|port from the patrons of the univer&s;ity, and by the great abilities, a&s;&s;iduity, and experience of tho&s;e gentlemen, and &s;ome few of their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, the re|putation of that place is rai&s;ed to &s;uch a height, that, to their immortal honour, it already rivals, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;es that of every other &s;chool of Phy&s;ic in Europe. The names of Drummond, Dick, Clerk, Rutherford, Sinclair, Al&s;ton, Plummer, Monroe, Whytt, Cullen, Hope, Black, and &s;ome others, are now known wherever the knowledge of Phy&s;ic is cultivated; and they are revered at home as parents and guardians of the healing arts. There is a great re&s;ort of medical &s;tudents at the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, as well from Great-Britain, Ireland, and the We&s;t-Indies, as from the Continents of Eu|rope and America. The&s;e bring to the univer&s;ity and city con&s;iderable advantages, and, in return, car|ry the fame of their learning and their profe&s;&s;ors to every quarter of the globe. Were it nece&s;&s;ary I could ea&s;ily enumerate many &s;imiliar in&s;tances of the

<P>THE city of Philadelphia, adorned with a &s;et of eminent practitioners, draws to it a great number of pupils, from the neighbouring parts, to learn the arts of Phy&s;ic and Surgery. We may rea&s;ona|ably expect, that from the propo&s;ed in&s;titution, the number of &s;tudents, who &s;hali re&s;ort hither to par|take of the&s;e advantages, will be gradually aug|mented.</P>
<P>BESIDES men of great abilities and eminence, un|der whom they may &s;ee private practice, the ho&s;pital of this city is a great per&s;ua&s;ive to determine a concour&s;e of medical &s;tudents to this place. It would be doubly u&s;eful to them, and increa&s;e their motive of repairing here, if they could be fir&s;t pro|perly initiated in the principles of their profe&s;&s;ion, by regular cour&s;es of lectures duly delivered.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="010082_0066_0F7C94D8B84D2D70">THIS noble charity, maintained by the donations of the benevolent at no &s;mall expence, &s;upports a great number of &s;ick of both &s;exes. As there are &s;ix phy&s;icians of the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable &s;kill, inte|grity, and character, who, moved by the tender principles of humanity, have taken upon them the charge of attending the &s;ick gratuitou&s;ly; pupils here meet with &s;uch a number of ca&s;es, both chronic and acute, treated &s;o judiciou&s;ly, and &s;o agreeable to the rules of art, as cannot fail very much to facilitate the knowledge of their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

We may from hence, I think, &s;afely infer, that every thing in their power may be hoped for, to &s;econd the medical in&s;titutions of the college, by uniting with them the advantages of the ho&s;pital, and thus rendering the education of youth in the healing arts as compleat as po&s;&s;ible in this city; to which nothing can contribute more than a cour&s;e of clinical practice and clinical lectures, by phy&s;ici|ans of knowledge and experience.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e who are apprentices to, or under the immediate tu|ition of the ho&s;pital phy&s;icians, every &s;tudent of Medicine in town is admitted to &s;ee their common practice in the ho&s;pital, upon pay|ing a certain &s;um annually during his attendance there. It were to be wi&s;hed that &s;ome of tho&s;e gentlemen, &s;o &s;killful and experienced in the healing arts, enriched with u&s;eful ob&s;ervations, which only time, and an exten&s;ive practice can furni&s;h, would undertake to give a cour&s;e of clinical lectures, in order to explain the ho&s;pital practice; the &s;tudents paying &s;uch rea&s;onable fees to tho&s;e clinical teachers as may be thought adequate to their trouble. This is a &s;tep of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t obvious utility to both ho&s;pital and &s;tudent, con|&s;onant to rea&s;on and the u&s;age of &s;ome of the be&s;t ho&s;pitals in Europe.</P>
<P>From my per&s;onal acquaintance with many of the managers when I attended the ho&s;pital &s;ome years ago, I am per&s;uaded they would readily encourage this plan. Their known benevolence and ardent de&s;ire of contributing all in their power towards the improvement of medical arts, as well as relief of the &s;ick; and thus uniting two of the mo&s;t valuable purpo&s;es of &s;uch a foundation, lead me to think &s;o.</P>
<P>When two &s;uch important in&s;titutions, as a medical college and a well regulated ho&s;pital, contribute mutually to the advantage of each other, all ranks and conditions of people would no doubt mo&s;t chear|fully unite in &s;upport of a common intere&s;t, &s;o beneficial to u&s;eful li|terature, and &s;o advantageous to the province in general.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>I PROPOSE in a few months to employ my&s;elf in giving a cour&s;e of lectures on the Materia Medica, in which the pharmaceutic treatment of medicines, as well as their virtues, will be de&s;cribed, and the
<PB N="36" REF="010082_0071_0F7C94DC744A42D0">
doctrines of the chymical properties of bodies will be con&s;idered, as far as it u&s;eful to give a general idea of Chymi&s;try, and as is con&s;i&s;tent with a cour&s;e of the Materia Medica. Next year I de&s;ign to attempt a cour&s;e of lectures upon the In&s;titutes or Theory of Medicine, which will be illu&s;trated with practical ob&s;ervations. Po&s;&s;ibly in a few years more, per&s;ons duly qualified may offer to undertake full and com|pleat cour&s;es of every branch of medicine; and a plan may be adopted, conformable to that which is followed in the, &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated, &s;chool of phy&s;ic at Edinburgh.</P>
<P>THE regular di&s;tribution of literary honours upon the de&s;erving is a &s;tep, which is neglected in no in|&s;titution that promi&s;es fair to be exten&s;ively u&s;eful. As it is &s;ometimes prejudicial to attempt a &s;cheme entirely out of our reach, &s;o, on the other hand, a too contracted plan often mars the work altogether, or fru&s;trates the great utility which might be derived from a more fini&s;hed model. Let us aim then to di&s;tingui&s;h worth with adequate rewards, and confer due honours on real merit. This will, render the in&s;titution compleat, and give all po&s;&s;ible encouragement to pupils.</P>
<P>As you have hitherto been &s;o careful not to pro|&s;titute the honours of this &s;eminary on any occa&s;ion
<PB N="37" REF="010082_0072_0F7C94DEE9631F90">
by conferring them on the unde&s;erving; and have made degrees in arts not an unmeaning title, but an honourable badge of di&s;tinction, you have given &s;olid reputation to tho&s;e who have been educated here. You have thus conducted them with ecclat to the &s;tudy of the learned profe&s;&s;ions, or u&s;hered them into other u&s;eful &s;pheres of life with lu&s;tre and ad|vantage. The &s;ame regard being had to the higher degrees of literature would increa&s;e the&s;e good ef|fects. In a &s;hort time, every per&s;on would be a&s;hamed to think of pracri&s;ing phy&s;ic, who had not indu&s;tr|ou&s;ly cultivated the be&s;t opportunities of in&s;truction. He would otherwi&s;e be marked out by every in|telligent man, as one who had never been properly initiated in his profe&s;&s;ion, and, con&s;equently, as un|equal to the ta&s;k which he had pre&s;umptuou&s;ly engaged in.</P>
<P>IF the &s;everal parts of the de&s;ign, which I have pointed out as practicable to execute, meet with that attention which they &s;eem to merit, it is not to be doubted that, in a &s;hort time, medicine will put on the form of a regular &s;cience, and be &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated in the College. And &s;uppo&s;ing we are not able to meet with gentlemen already in circum|&s;tances to engage in every part of the work, we may however hope that a laudable ambition, &s;enti|ments of honour, and the intere&s;t of the public weal will prompt &s;ome of the ri&s;ing &s;tudents, a|mong

It is to be hoped that they will avail them&s;elves of every opportunity of improvement by going abroad, and on their re|turn, tran&s;plant hither, to the great emolument of the community, every different branch of knowledge relative to their profe&s;&s;ion. Is it not probable that &s;uch a plan as this laid before them will open the views, &s;pur on the ambition, and allure the indu&s;|try of &s;tudents, &s;o that we may hope to &s;ee, in &s;ome years, a number of gentlemen, natives of America., qualified to fill the mo&s;t difficult and important parts of their profe&s;&s;ion, with u&s;efulnefs and applau&s;e?</P>
<P>IT may perhaps be objected, that the colonies are yet in &s;o infant a &s;tate that any attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h medical &s;chools is premature. It may be imagined, that it will prevent many from going abroad, to ob|tain a more compleat education. Let it be con&s;ider|ed, that every one, who&s;e circum&s;tances allow of this, will have a plan before them, and every incite|ment to render their education as perfect as po&s;|&s;ible, Many who are not in a condition to &s;upport the expence of being educated abroad, by being in&s;tructed here in the fir&s;t elements of their profe&s;|&s;ion, and informed what further remains to be done, have it in their power to fini&s;h their &s;tudies abroad

afterwards with advantage. This cla&s;s perhaps in|cludes the greate&s;t part of medical &s;tudents.</P>
<P>THE &s;aving of money may be thought more nece&s;|&s;ary at this juncture, when the check which our com|merce has received makes it &s;o &s;carce among&s;t us.</P>
<P>SOME there are indeed, and not a few, who can|not by any means afford the expence of cro&s;&s;ing the Atlantic, to pro&s;ecute their &s;tudies abroad. The propo&s;ed in&s;titution will therefore prove highly be|neficial to every cla&s;s of &s;tudents in Medicine.</P>
<P>THERE is a difficulty indeed in the way of the un|dertaking of great weight, which it were to be wi&s;hed could be &s;urmounted; I mean in ca&s;e all the different branches of medicine &s;hould be blended in the prac|tice of any profe&s;&s;or. This evil would call aloud for a remedy. The love of humanity prompts every ingenious man, engaged in that part of medical pur|&s;uits which he likes be&s;t, to pro&s;ecute it with a&s;&s;idui|ty and con&s;tancy. The bounds of life are the only limits to his indu&s;try. He devotes him&s;elf entirely to a toil&s;ome &s;tudy, but which cea&s;es to appear &s;o to him, when the interefts of humanity are the fruits of his labours. There are men fo intent upon im|proving favourite &s;tudies, that a labour of very many years is but a con&s;tant exerci&s;e of the eyes and hands, by which the &s;cience in general is greatly

<P>WHILST Medicine from the greatne&s;s of its object, the pre&s;ervation of the &s;pecies, is one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;ubjects of knowledge to a &s;tate, and at the &s;ame time one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and difficult; we ju&s;t regret that the very different employment of Phy&s;ician, Surgeon, and Apothecary, &s;hould be p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">i&s;cuou&s;ly followed by any one man, however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">at his abilities. They certainly require very differ|ent talents. The infant &s;tate of a place, is &s;ome|times u&s;ed as an argument, not in &s;upport, but as an apology for &s;uch mea&s;ures. The longer we follow any faulty cu&s;tom, the more difficult we find the ta&s;k to break through the &s;hackles of it, even when it en&s;laves us to our greate&s;t detriment.</P>
<P>EVERY mechanic art, and almo&s;t every employ|ment in life, &s;erve as in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons to the prac|ticioners of Medicine. The con&s;truction of a watch, the building of a hou&s;e, may the making of a pin, are &s;triking examples of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. In each of them a number of different arti&s;ts are employ|ed, who confining them&s;elves every one to his own branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, the whole work is more quickly fini&s;hed, and more highly improved. The length, to which human &s;kill may arrive, when thus pro|perly
<PB N="41" REF="010082_0076_0F7C94E1DBC74C30">
directed is amazing. Why then &s;hould we continue to follow &s;uch a variety of different occu|pations as are generally crouded together in the prac|tice of the healing art? The mutual intere&s;t of pa|tient and practitioner &s;eem to require a different pro|cedure. The chief argument alledged for it, viz. that it is le&s;s expen&s;ive, is altogether fallacious, and, un|le&s;s I am much out in my conjectures, it will be found a very difficult ta&s;k to prove the a&s;&s;ertion. But granting it to be truely &s;o, yet when life is the object at &s;take, a notion of cheapening health, and a di&s;paragement of the practitioners &s;kill, argue a &s;ordid mind, and will, in the end, always di&s;cover a mo&s;t mi&s;taken plan of oeconomy.</P>
<P>IF Phy&s;ic, Surgery, and Pharmacy were in different hands, practitioners would then enjoy much more &s;atisfaction in practice. They would commonly be le&s;s burdened with an over hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s, and have an opportunity of &s;tudying the ca&s;es of the &s;ick at more lei&s;ure. Would not this tend to the more &s;peedy relief of di&s;ea&s;es and the perfection of medical &s;cience, as every Phy&s;ician would have more time by &s;tudy, ob&s;ervation, and experience united, to cultivate that knowledge which is the only foundation of practice? "This knowledge, &s;ought out by Philo&s;ophy, drawn from nature and the operation of Medicines, and founded upon the cau&s;es of our complaints, upon ob&s;ervations of their &s;igns and upon die laws of the animal oeconomy, form

<P>WHERE abilities and the love of a profe&s;&s;ion unite, there is the fure&s;t pre&s;age of &s;ucce&s;s. But unhappy is the Phy&s;ician, who has a &s;oul turned to philo&s;ophi|cal inquiries, who loves to &s;earch into the cau&s;es, and inve&s;tigate the phoenomena of di&s;ea&s;es; and yet is at the &s;ame time diverted from the&s;e u&s;eful re&s;earches, by other occupations to which he has an aver&s;ion.

<P>ON the other hand, a &s;pirit of intrepidity and a particular turn of mind carry many beyond the horrors which get the better of others. Fired at the &s;ame time with a like love of humanity, and filled with de&s;ires of relieving the calamities to which external violence, and innumerable ac|cidents both from within and from without &s;ub|ject our lot, they apply them&s;elves with the mo&s;t laudable zeal and a&s;&s;iduity, to improve that e&s;&s;ential

part of the healing art which is capable of giving effectual aid by the painful, but whole&s;ome &s;everity of manual operation.</P>
<P>TO render any per&s;on dextrous in the operations of Surgery, however intrepid he may naturally be, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould practi&s;e them often, and devote him&s;elf to them. This is incon&s;i&s;tent with the occupation of a Phy&s;ician involved in a multi|plicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, and requiring lei&s;ure to &s;tudy the ca&s;es of his patients, who linger under a complica|tion of evils widely different.</P>
<P>IT is to lovers of humanity like the&s;e, &s;o different|ly occupied, that &s;ome owe the movement of their limbs, others the mitigation of ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;es, and others the prolongation and plea&s;ure of their lives.</P>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of Pharmacy is entirely different from either. Free from the cares of both, the Apothecary is to prepare and compound medicines as the Phy&s;ici|an &s;hall direct.

<P>I appeal to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. The common &s;en&s;e of mankind, duly informed, gives its verdict again&s;t a promi&s;cuous profe&s;&s;ion of different occupations. When a country has made &s;ome advances in other arts, and begins to flouri&s;h in knowledge, perhaps not without &s;ome luxury, it is high time that medical &s;cience &s;hould be practi&s;ed with regularity. It would be unpardona|ble in the profe&s;&s;ors to let it remain at a &s;tand, as if they had already attained the &s;ummit of human wi&s;dom. This would curb every laudable attempt to improve polite literature among&s;t the ri&s;ing generation.

the benefits which the STUDENTS of MEDI|CINE will derive from it.</P>
<P>IN a place &s;o remote as Philadelphia from every &s;chool of Phy&s;ic, we cannot expect a very early in|intelligence of all the medical di&s;coveries and im|provements which are made in Europe. In e&s;ta|bli&s;hing medical colleges, the profe&s;&s;ors of each branch will find it incumbent on them to keep up a corre&s;pondence with the learned abroad. They will thus get &s;peedy accounts of every thing new which may relate to their particular provinces. By improve|ing this knowledge, they can diffu&s;e it among&s;t their pupils, and, by their means, more readily propagate it through every part of the country.</P>
<P>THAT this will be of the greate&s;t utility is manife&s;t, if we rely on the authority of the mo&s;t celebrated academicians.

<P>STUDENTS are apt to be di&s;gu&s;ted with any art, when, at their fir&s;t entrance upon it, they find it be|&s;et with difficulties which to them appear un&s;ur|mountable; but when the&s;e begin to clear up, their eager pur&s;uit of knowledge increa&s;es daily with growing plea&s;ure. A regular cour&s;e of in&s;truction prompts them to an eager pur&s;uit of learning: it &s;heds forth conviction upon the mind, and improves the confidence of the diligent; a confidence founded

in&s;truction is to the mind like the rays of light darting through the ob&s;curity of Chaos. It di&s;|pells the clouds that envelope the under&s;tanding, and enables the diligent &s;tudent to penetrate into the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of nature. Thus prepared, he is in a &s;ituation to enrich him&s;elf with tho&s;e trea&s;ures of knowledge which the ob&s;ervers of nature have heaped together for many ages.

<P>As the practice of teaching is requi&s;ite, in or|der to be able to explain the difficulties of any &s;cience, and render the communication of its pre|cepts familiar to others, it is nece&s;&s;ary that per&s;ons &s;hould devote their time very much to it. This can only be done to good purpo&s;e, &s;o that &s;tu|dents may reap ample advantages therefrom, by means of in&s;tituting public profe&s;&s;or&s;hips.</P>
<P>THE bu&s;ine&s;s of a Profe&s;&s;or is to place before &s;tudents in a full light, at their fir&s;t entrance upon any &s;tudy, the true object of that &s;tudy, and to a&s;certain their proper pur&s;uit. In performing this, he fir&s;t ex|plains to them the terms of art, and renders the lan|guage and ideas thereof familiar.

He points out the mi&s;takes which any of them may have run into, and puts them upon

their guard again&s;t &s;uch errors as are apt to mi&s;lead &s;tudents. He &s;upplies the defects of tho&s;e authors, And mentions what new light the late&s;t di&s;qui&s;iti|ons and di&s;coveries have thrown upon every &s;ubject. He thus points out the road which leads to &s;cience, and prevents the young votary from running into a maze of doubts. He confirms his &s;teps, &s;mooths the rugged path he has to tread, a&s;&s;i&s;ts him in climbing the &s;teep a&s;cent, and, before di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, informs him how he is to conduct him&s;elf, in order to reach at length to the &s;ummit of his profe&s;&s;ion.

<P>ANOTHER manifect advantage of public lectures is, that they bring together a number of &s;tu|dents of the &s;ame cla&s;s of knowledge. If the profe&s;&s;or is a man who labours to improve the growing mind, he has it in his power to kindle an ambition in the brea&s;t of his pupils.

on &s;uch literary and medical debates as tend greatly to their mutual improvement.</P>
<P>As to what regards &s;tudents them&s;elves, the&s;e &s;e|veral particulars I am per&s;uaded are &s;ufficient to convince every judicious per&s;on of the nece&s;&s;ity of in&s;tituting, in this &s;eminary, profe&s;&s;or&s;hips in all the branches of the healing arts.</P>
<P>THE great advantage which may be expected to accrue to the SEMINARY it&s;elf, from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of medical &s;chools, is the advancement of the grand de&s;ign of &s;uch a &s;eminary in general, and the im|provement of &s;ome of the mo&s;t u&s;eful branches of literature, that can embelli&s;h any &s;eat of learning. If wi&s;dom and profitable &s;cience are the glory, the ornament, the highe&s;t attainment of humane nature, and give the &s;tronge&s;t evidence of a people being enriched with generous and refined &s;entiments, by which all poli&s;hed nations are ambitious of being di&s;tingui&s;hed; then, mo&s;t certainly, it becomes an object of the fir&s;t con&s;ideration with us to determine, whether the cultivation and patronage of this &s;cience are worthy our mo&s;t ardent pur&s;uits, and whether we &s;hall improve this opportunity which is now put into our hands for that purpo&s;e. It is needle&s;s to in|form you of what con&s;equence it is to take the lead in a de&s;ign fo intere&s;ting, &s;o noble and important.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="010082_0087_0F7C94EC442DD300">THE reputation of every &s;ort of u&s;efull learning mu&s;t be of great benefit to a CITY, as it will draw, from all parts, per&s;ons that have a reli&s;h for litera|ture, who will always prefer a place of education, in which the greate&s;t number of advantages coincide.</P>
<P>THE re&s;ort of &s;trangers to any city for the cultiva|tion of &s;cience mu&s;t give it proportionably a pre-emi|nence over others. An education in any place begets that place an intere&s;t, and as it were naturalizes &s;tran|gers to it. In return for a di&s;pen&s;ation of know|ledge, it collects a tribute of riches as well as of affect|tion from all quarters.</P>
<P>AMONGST the benefits to be derived to the PRO|VINCE from the e&s;tabli&s;hment of medical &s;chools, I cannot pa&s;s over a particular one, which ought to fire the ambition, and animate the indu&s;try of every &s;tudent who has cho&s;en to devote him&s;elf to the cul|tivation of the healing arts.</P>
<P>WE live on a wide extended continent of which but the &s;malle&s;t portion, even of the inhabited part, has yet been explored. The woods, the mountains, the rivers and bowels of the earth afford ample &s;cope for the re&s;earches of the ingenious. In this re&s;pect an American &s;tudent has &s;ome con&s;iderable advantages over tho&s;e of Europe, viz. The mo&s;t ample field lies before us for the improvement of natural hi&s;tory. The countries of Europe have been repeatedly traver&s;ed

by numerous per&s;ons of the highe&s;t genius and learn|ing, intent upon making the &s;tricte&s;t &s;earch into every thing which tho&s;e countries afford; whence there is le&s;s hopes or chance for the &s;tudents who come after them to make new di&s;coveries. This part of the world may be looked upon as offering the riche&s;t mines of natural knowledge yet unriffled, &s;ufficient to gratify the laudable thir&s;t of glory in young in|quirers into nature. The di&s;covery mu&s;t greatly en|rich medical &s;cience, and perpetuate the glory of the authors to late&s;t time.</P>
<P>HOW many plants are there, natives of this &s;oil, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of peculiar virtues? how many fo&s;&s;ils to enrich the cabinets of the curious? how many na|tural &s;ub&s;tances, objects of new trade and commerce to &s;upply materials for various arts, as well as to en|large the bounds of Medicince? what means are &s;o likely to bring them to our knowledge as medical re&s;earches and careful experiments, pro&s;ecuted by tho&s;e in&s;tructed how to make them, and how to pro|fit them&s;elves of the di&s;covery? A &s;pirit of inquiry into the&s;e things would be put on foot as the natu|ral tendency of &s;uch an in&s;titution, and prove the mo&s;t likely mrans of bringing to light the know|ledge of many u&s;eful things, of which we yet remain ignorant, the more readily, as natural hi&s;tory is one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;tudies to prepare a per&s;on

<P>FROM all the&s;e different views, I pre&s;ume none will deny the expediency, and nece&s;&s;ty if I may &s;o &s;ay, as well as the exceeding great benefits of the propo&s;ed in&s;titution to this &s;eminary, city and pro|vince.

<P>SURE I am that you regard the ri&s;ing youth as the growing hopes of the country.

<P>WHILST the &s;tudies of youth are pro&s;ecuted un|der the encouragement and patronage of men di&s;|tingui&s;hed by their literature and worth, they have the highe&s;t motives that can animate the pur&s;uits of a generous mind.
