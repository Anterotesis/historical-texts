<P>IT hath been an Ancient, Laudable, Ce|lebrated Cu&s;tome, on our Anniver&s;ary Elections, (formerly of Governours, but always of A&s;&s;i&s;tants in Govern|ment) to Invocate the Divine Pre&s;ence, and Con&s;ult the Sacred Oracles for Direction in &s;o Weighty an Affair.</P>
<P>By the di&s;po&s;e of Divine Providence, it hath fallen to my Allotment, and at the Plea|&s;ure of tho&s;e Worthy and Honourable Gentle|men, the Repre&s;entatives of this Province, I find my &s;elf expo&s;ed, and have this task put upon me; which I am very &s;en&s;ible, might have been better performed and accepted by

&s;ome other Per&s;on, better acquainted with the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances and &s;tate of Affairs a|mong&s;t us.</P>
<P>But &s;ince it cannot be prevented, that I would crave, is only a candid Interpretation of what may be very plainly, but &s;incerely offered; it not being pre&s;umption, but obedience, that makes me comply in my pre&s;ent offerings, who have rea&s;on to account my &s;elf the weake&s;t &amp; mo&s;t unworthy of my Brethren that mini&s;ter at the Altar.</P>
<P>That which I have to offer to this Great and Honourable, the General A&s;&s;embly of this Province; and in the Audience of the Reve|rend Elders, and all good Chri&s;tians now Con|ven'd: Let it be &s;ome brief and &s;uitable Re|flections on the Divine Providence, in the Lords Conduct of his Church thro' the Wil|derne&s;s of this World, or from one part of the Wilderne&s;s of this World to another.</P>
<P>This is admirably Exemplified in our Text, by the famous In&s;tance of God's Conduct of <HI>I&s;|rael</HI> of Old (the only Church upon Earth, the National Church of the <HI>Jews</HI>) thro' the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> and into, and in the Wilderne&s;s by the Right hand of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> with Gods Glorious Arm (for forty years together) to make him|&s;elf an Everla&s;ting Name.</P>
<P>Which may be improved as a parallel In|&s;tance, and may put us upon a Reflection of Gods Conduct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> People (our Fathers) o|ver a far greater Sea (the va&s;t <HI>Atlantick Oce|an</HI>)

<P>But le&s;t I &s;hould <HI>in ip&s;o limine impingere,</HI> and forget the limits of time alotted; I mu&s;t mind you, that our Text is a brief Compendi|um, or an Abridgement of that Famous Cele|brated Hi&s;tory of Gods Conduct of his Church from <HI>Egypt</HI> thro' the Wilderne&s;s, and in the Wilderne&s;s: In which Conduct, four things are pointed out in our Text.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Divine Power and Providence of God, figuratively &s;et forth by the Metaphor of his Arm, his Glorious Arm; (who led them by the Right hand of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> with his Glorious Arm) the Arm of God in Scripture Language, denotes the Power of God: <HI>Brachium ponitur pro Robore, Fortitudine, Potentia.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3.

<P>You may take up this Doctrine from the words, as the ground of our En&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
<HI>To make Him&s;elf an Everlasting Name, is the prime and ultimate end of Gods Exerting his Glo|rious Arm of Divine Power and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Conducting his Church and People thro' the Wil|derne&s;s of this World; or from one part of the Wilderne&s;s of this World to another.</HI></P>

For Confirmation hereof, I might lead you thro' the whole Hi&s;tory of the Scriptures; wherein we may trace the foot&s;teps of the Won|der Working Providences of God in his Care and Conduct of his Church, and Judgments up|on their Enemies, which have remarks put upon them every where by Gods Holy Prophets; And by way of Imitation in treating the Subject un|der our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration, I might improve their method.</P>
<P>Our Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> in our Text, points out unto us the Ancient way of Preaching in Old Te&s;tament times, which was an Hi&s;torical Narra|tion of Memorable Mercies and Remarkable Judg|ments relating to Gods Church, or his Churches Enemies: Mercies and Judgments were the Texts they Preached on; hence is that of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>I will Sing of Mercy and of Judgment unto thee Oh Lord,</HI> P&s;al. 101. 1.</P>
<P>But let it &s;uffice to Confirm this Doctrine from the particular In&s;tance in our Text, wherein as in a Gla&s;s we may behold the Providence of God, his Wi&s;dom, Glory, Power and Goodne&s;s exerci&s;ed towards his People at all times. Now that there was &s;o much of the Prai&s;e-worthy Excellency and Goodne&s;s of God Di&s;covered in this Conduct of his People, the Scriptures do frequently declare: Hence &s;o many P&s;alms of Prai&s;e made concerning it: After Ages tran&s;mit|ting down to their Children the Glory of God appearing therein.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 106. 1, 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>Prai&s;e ye the Lord &amp;c.

but all this was to make him&s;elf an Everla&s;ting Name: This indeed was the end of all Gods Wonderful Works, both of Creation and of Providence, but e&s;pecially of his Churches pre|&s;ervation, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially of the Glorious Work of Redemption; the foundation whereof was Everla&s;ting Love, and the Top&s;tone &s;hall be laid with &s;houting, Grace Grace unto it, <HI>Zach.</HI> 4. that hereby the Lord might make to him&s;elf an Everla&s;ting Name.</P>
<P N="1">1. To make him&s;elf an Everla&s;ting Name, was the great end of the Works of Creation; therefore God call'd up this great World out of nothing, for this end he fram'd the &s;tately Fabrick of this va&s;t and beautiful Univer&s;e; he hath planted the Heavens, that &s;tately Su|per&s;tructure, that vaulted Roof, and be&s;pangled Canopy over our heads; wherein he hath &s;et a tabernacle for the Sun, and appointed the Ordnances of Heaven, with the influential Con|&s;tellations thereof, and guides <HI>Arcturus</HI> with his Sons, and hath made <HI>Orion,</HI> the <HI>Pleides,</HI> and the Chambers of the South; and all this to make him&s;elf an Everla&s;ting Name: Hence that of the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 19. 1. <HI>The Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament &s;hew|eth his handy-work.</HI> And he hath al&s;o laid the Beams of his Chambers in the Waters, and fixed the Ground&s;els and Foundations of the World, and hangeth the Earth upon nothing, <HI>Job</HI> 26. 7. he &s;tretcheth out the North over the empty place, and the Earth hangs equally poized with its own weight, which made the very Heathen to admire: Hence that of <HI>Ovid,</HI>

<P>This is wonderful, that the va&s;t Globe of the pondrous Earth and Sea, &s;hould thus hang without &s;ome &s;olid thing to uphold it? This makes the Lord an Everla&s;ting Name; who laid the Foundations of the Earth, that it &s;hould not be removed for ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. To make him&s;elf an Everla&s;ting Name, is the end of all Gods wonder-working Provi|dences in the World; ordering all things to his own Glory, and for the good of his Church, &amp; the de&s;truction of all the implacable Adver|&s;aries thereof; as <HI>Pharoah</HI> is a &s;pecial example, yielding to us a fair demon&s;tration of a Re|venging Deity, and of a Divine Neme&s;is.</P>
<P>But to come up to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e from the In&s;tance in our Text, to make a parallel of it, in order to Application, we may Enquire,</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>Wherein was Gods Glorious Arm &s;o Illustrious in his Peoples Conduct thro' the Wil|derne&s;s, as to make him&s;elf an Everla&s;ting Name.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> In general, the &s;um or principal of it is, in that he brought his People <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> by and thro' Travels unto Re&s;t, Troubles unto Peace, Wants unto Supplies, Di&s;tre&s;&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nto Deliverances; yea, through and from

<P>Now in this way of the Lords Di&s;pen&s;ati|on, was made bare the Arm of three of Gods Glorious Attributes; the Glorious Arm of his Power, of his Wi&s;dom, and of his Good|ne&s;s.</P>

So the&s;e Wilderne&s;s Leadings and Salvations are works, wherein Mercy imployes all the Attributes of God, and &s;o Wi&s;dom; in &s;pecial, Wi&s;dom in bringing things about in a mo&s;t wonderful manner when at wits end; making Dejection the way to Exaltation; al&s;o in u&s;ing fit means to do his People good, in doing many things at once; taking vengeance on their Enemies, cha&s;ti&s;ing, humbling his own People Saving in fit &s;ea&s;ons by wonderful ways and means.</P>

<P>The &s;weete&s;t help is help in Di&s;tre&s;s, and then mo&s;t of the goodne&s;s of God is ta&s;ted. A Mercy in the Wilderne&s;s is the &s;weete&s;t Mercy of all.</P>
<P>But more particularly, His Glorious Arm of Divine Goodne&s;s appeared in Leading His People, if we con&s;ider the <HI>Terminus a quo e|ad quem.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. In regard of the Term from which he brought them, <HI>&s;oil.</HI> from <HI>Egypt,</HI> an Hou&s;e of Bondage, a Furnace of Iron, from under Task|ma&s;ters, from out of the Brick-kilns, from the mid&s;t of Idolatry. That he brought them out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> we know how much is &s;poken of in Scripture. Better be in the Wilderne&s;s, than in <HI>Egypt:</HI> Better be &s;erving and following the Lord in a Wilderne&s;s, in a Land that was not &s;own, than &s;erving cruel men, and defiling them&s;elves with the Abominations of <HI>Egypt;</HI> now the Lord led them, and there was no &s;trange God with them. <HI>Egypt</HI> was a Type of the &s;tate of Sin and Mi&s;ery, out of which God leads his own People.</P>
<P N="2">2. In regard of the Term to which he was leading them; namely, to <HI>Canaan,</HI> Re&s;t, that is the end; the Wilderne&s;s is the way to <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> and there they arrive at la&s;t; the hope

of that makes Travel ea&s;ie and &s;weet, the Journeys end makes amends for all; and the enjoyment of it at la&s;t, is the more &s;weet; we &s;ay, <HI>All is well that ends well.</HI></P>
<P>But the Wilderne&s;s, tho' a place of Afflicti|on, was a place of much mercy; they were in the Wilderne&s;s, but God led them there, was with them there, and did great things there for them. Particularly, let me In&s;tance in &s;ome of the &s;pecial Mercies of God in his Glorious Arm of Conduct of his People by the Right hand of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s, which may be of u&s;e in the Application.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Lord &s;et up RELIGION among them, gave them Statutes and Judgments, and Rules to walk by; the Lord gave them his Word, this was a di&s;tingui&s;hing favour: <HI>He &s;hewed his Word unto</HI> Jacob, <HI>his Statutes and his Judgments unto</HI> I&s;rael; <HI>he hath not dealt &s;o with any Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Never had the People of God &s;o much of his Word given to them, as now &s;ince they came into the Wilderne&s;s. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the fir&s;t Writer of Holy Scripture, was given them to be their Leader in the Wilderne&s;s, &amp; to deliver the fir&s;t Scriptures in writing; and it is like he writ not only the four la&s;t, but <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> al&s;o, in the Wilderne&s;s. He acted as an Extraor|dinary Prophet; and then al&s;o by his Mini|&s;try, the Law was given on Mount <HI>Sinai.</HI> In the Wilderne&s;s God gave them both Law &amp; Go&s;pel; the Law was delivered on the Mount,
<PB N="17" REF="001780_0019_0FB82412ACD13888">
and the Go&s;pel was Preached in the Renewing Gods Covenant with them; and in the extra|ordinary Types of the <HI>Brazen Serpent,</HI> which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s lifted up.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>vid.</HI> Par. Prol. in Gen Joh. 3. 14.</NOTE> <HI>And of the Rock, who&s;e waters follow'd them; and of the Manna,</HI> &amp;c. In a word, in the wilderne&s;s God opened his mind and heart to them; now they were alone, he revealed both Law and Go&s;pel in a larger and fuller manner than ever he did before.</P>
<P>Again, the SABBATH had been In&s;tituted from the Beginning, and the Law of it had al|ways been in force, as other Moral Laws, but much neglected and forgotten; therefore God &s;olemnly made it known, and called them to Remember it on Mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> this was his great mercy, to give them the clear Rule of the Sabbath in the Wilderne&s;s, and to reduce them to the careful Ob&s;ervation of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. He &s;et up his TABERNACLE among them in the Wilderne&s;s, he gave them Ordi|nances and In&s;titutions, and Prie&s;ts and Levites to Di&s;pen&s;e all the Ordinances of God to them, according to that <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> Paedagogy; having al&s;o cau&s;ed them to Renew their Covenant with him, their Church-Covenant; for &s;o that is, <HI>Exod.</HI> 19. being a Social Covenant, wherein many People together, did engage them&s;elves to the Lord; thus God brought them near to him, and Set up his Tabernacle among them.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="001780_0020_0FB82413E3D19228">
3. The Lord &s;et up Government among them, Civil Government; he gave them Laws, &s;o al&s;o Magi&s;trates with Power to execute the&s;e Laws. Not only <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> an extraordinary Per&s;on to be King of <HI>Je&s;hurun,</HI> whom the Lord rai&s;ed up to bear their lumber, and to manage the Difficult work of Leading that People as in our Text.

<P>The Lord did not bring them from under their Taskma&s;ters in <HI>Egypt,</HI> into the Wilderne&s;s to turn Libertines, and to do what is Right in their own Eyes, to de&s;pi&s;e to be Ruled by any of their Brethren&mdash;Altho' &s;ome of them ro&s;e up again&s;t that Order and Government the Lord had &s;et them under; but the Lord did &s;olemnly and dreadfully declare him&s;elf again&s;t them, as he will &s;ooner or later &s;how that he will not bear with tho&s;e that refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to Order, either in Church or Common Wealth: And Oh what a Mercy is it to Enjoy Government, this was a

<P N="4">4. In the Lords Conduct of them with his Glo|rious Arm, he delivered them from their Enemies, and gave them peace in the Wilderne&s;s.

<P N="6">6. The Lord wonderfully and mercifully &s;pared them, notwith&s;tanding their Murmuring and ma|nifold Sins and Provocations.

<P>One would wonder that God &s;pared them. And when we read the Story, we Marvel that they &s;hould be &s;o unbelieving, and refractory, and &s;o &s;oon running after one evil or other.

6. The Lord hath &s;pread a Table for us in this Wilderne&s;s and &s;upplyed our wants from year to year, and every year; the year la&s;t pa&s;t, was an eminent In&s;tance of this; in the time of that la&s;ting &s;corching drought, when our Hearts and our Hopes failed us: God did &s;ecretly and unaccountably (I had almo&s;t &s;aid Miraculou&s;ly) Re&s;erve a Ble&s;&s;ing for us, that there was Bread to the &s;ower, a &s;upply for our nece&s;&s;ities; this was the Lords doing, and it is Marvellous in our Eyes, it was Gods Glorious Arm that effected it; Oh let His Everla&s;ting Name be Magnified.</P>
<P>Oh how hath the Lord provided for us from year to year, and &s;ometimes plentifully; this is indeed to rain Bread in a Wilderne&s;s. Oh the Thou&s;ands of poor Creatures among us, who&s;e Loins and Bowels do ble&s;s the Lord! Very Na|ture teaches us Gratitude for this, who el&s;e in their Poverty might have fainted and peri&s;h'd for want of Bread.</P>
<P N="7">7. God hath done all this for us, notwith|&s;tanding our many Sins and Provocations. We have been a &s;inful People. Oh the Lords &s;paring Mercy in the mid&s;t of our Sins, great cry|ing Sins. Prophane&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mong the Wicked, Contentions among the Godly, Errours among others, woful incorrigiblene&s;s in mo&s;t under the Lords dealing, we may apply to our &s;elves tho&s;e words of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78. 40. <HI>How oft have we provoked him in the Wilderne&s;s, and griev'd him in the De&s;art; and yet being full of Compa&s;&s;ion he forgives our Iniquity, and De&s;troys us not.</HI> How many times has he turn'd away his Anger, and has not &s;tirr'd up all his Wrath. We in this Wilderne&s;s can &s;peak this Experi|mentally.</P>

8. God hath heard our Prayers in our &s;traits and plunging difficulties, how often hath he heard Prayers and been found of his People in their Supplications, and how often hath he come in the nick. Oh the many &s;weet returns of Prayer we have had! and God hath made his Arm Glorious for our relief. When we Prayed for Rain, for fair Weather, for removal of Devourers, for Pro|vi&s;ion, for Health, for Peace, for continuance of our Civil and Sanctuary Enjoyments; God hath made his Arm Glorious, and Glorified that Title among us that he is, <HI>A God hearing Prayer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>&V;&s;e</HI> 2. Beware of tho&s;e Sins that may pro|voke the Lord to withdraw the Glorious Arm of his Conduct. I &s;hall hint only at &s;ome that are more obvious.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take heed of de&s;pi&s;ing a Glorious Go&s;pel, or ill treating the Di&s;pen&s;ers of it. When <HI>I&s;rael</HI> mocked the Me&s;&s;engers of God, de&s;pi&s;ed his Words, and mi&s;u&s;ed his Prophets, the Wrath of God aro&s;e again&s;t his People; and there was no Re|medy.</P>
<P>God expects his Mini&s;ters &s;hould find &s;uitable entertainment every where, and that they &s;hould be &s;o provided for, &s;o as to &s;erve the Lord with|out di&s;traction. There are many Town&s;hips and Precincts readily Granted, and &s;upplyed with burning Lamps, which are like to be extingui&s;h'd for want of Oyl to feed them; the Go&s;pel &s;tar|ving in &s;ome Places, and the Di&s;pen&s;ers of it fain to work with their own hands, to admini|&s;ter to their Nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>It would be plea&s;ing to God, and more Credi|ble for our Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, if &s;ome Methods could be taken for Relief in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured that an impoveri&s;h'd &s;tarved Mi|ni&s;try,
<PB N="29" REF="001780_0031_0FB8242B217AE470">
will not only induce the Contempt of the Clergy, but al&s;o introduce a de&s;pi&s;ed Go&s;|pel; and if the Go&s;pel be once de&s;pi&s;ed, God will &s;oon withdraw the Glorious Arm of his Conduct.</P>
<P N="2">2. Take heed of the Sin of Worldline&s;s. This our Saviour cautions again&s;t, <HI>Luke</HI> 12. 15. This eats out the very heart of Religi|on; the &s;weets of the World, eat out the &s;avour of the Go&s;pel; neither the Dread of God is feared, nor the Grace of God prized by the worldly &s;en&s;ual Heart. Oh the &s;trange alteration in the &s;pirits of men! Our Fathers left the World, for the Enjoyment of Reli|gion in this Wilderne&s;s; but the De&s;igns of mo&s;t are Inverted: Mo&s;t in the&s;e days are lea|ving Religion in pur&s;uit of the World. They have that, that contents them in this world; hence they are regardle&s;s of God, and the World to come. Oh! we came hither for Religion, for the Go&s;pel; but the world hath engro&s;s'd our affections, our love, delight, de|&s;ires, our whole thoughts. Oh, take heed of the World! this caution the Lord gave to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of Old, when they had plenty and ful|ne&s;s, Hou&s;es full of all things, and Vineyards, and Olive-trees, <HI>&amp;c. Deut.</HI> 6. 11, 12. Now be|ware le&s;t thou forget the Lord; &s;o Chri&s;t gives caution, take heed of your Farms, Merchan|dize, Yokes of Oxen, and pieces of Ground, left you make light of the Call of the Go&s;pel; the world is full of <HI>Irritamenta malorum;</HI> it

proves a &s;nare to new and flouri&s;hing Plantati|ons; when the world comes in, &amp; they have a plentiful encrea&s;e, they abu&s;e the good Crea|tures of God to Sen&s;uality.</P>
<P>Noah <HI>became an Husbandman, planted a Vine|yard, drank of the wine, and was drunken,</HI> Gen. 9. 20, 21. The things of the World are incen|tives to Lu&s;t.</P>
<P>There is at this day among us, a great out|cry after the World, and after a Medium of Trade, to carry on worldly Intere&s;ts; it's well if our over-reaching after the world in too un|advi&s;ed and bold attempts, have not marr'd our worldly Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>We live in a good Land, did we but walk humbly with our God, keep his Statutes &amp; his Judgments; were we but indu&s;trious &amp; frugal, did we avoid all exce&s;&s;es; <HI>we &s;hould mount up with wings as Eagles, our peace would be like a Ri|ver, and our pro&s;perity like the waves of the Sea; and in&s;tead of lying among the pots, we &s;hould be like</HI> Davids <HI>Dove, who&s;e wings were covered with &s;ilver, and her feathers with yellow gold,</HI> P&s;al. 68. 13.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take heed of the Sin of Pride. It's tho't there is more expended on that one lu&s;t, than goes to the defraying our Publick Charges, ten times told; This Sin is an abomination to the Lord: And &s;ure I am, it is ill-becoming a wil|derne&s;s Condition, to be poor and proud.</P>
<P N="4">4. Take heed of the Sin of Oppre&s;&s;ion. That Sin hath its rounds among us; it is a crying &s;in, I&s;a. 5. 7. <HI>I looked for Judgment, but behold Op|pre&s;&s;ion,

and for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, but behold a Cry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Caution</HI> 5. Take heed of Sen&s;uality and In|temperance, in all the branches of it; Uncha&s;|tity, Gluttony, Drunkenne&s;s, the prevailing Sins of this Land.</P>
<P><HI>Caution</HI> 6. Take heed of the Sin of Murmur|ing and Di&s;content, under our Priviledges and Enjoyments. We are a People for changes &amp; alterations, well if God does not make us &s;mart for it before he's done.</P>
<P N="7">7. Take heed of advancing private Intere&s;ts, under a gilded pretence of promoting a Publick Good. There is too much of Self-intere&s;t, playing its part on Publick Stages.</P>
<P><HI>Caut.</HI> 8. Take heed of the Sins of the tongue, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 10. Oh the mi&s;chief that is done by that one member! that &s;ets on fire the cour&s;e of nature, and is &s;et on fire of Hell; forging, fomenting fal&s;e reports, <HI>&s;peaking evil of Digni|ties, Jude</HI> 8. &s;everely reproved. All Detracti|on is po&s;itively forbidden; <HI>thou &s;halt not rai&s;e a fal&s;e report,</HI> Exod. 33. 1.</P>
<P><HI>U&s;e</HI> 3. Hath the Lord led us &s;o long in this Wilderne&s;s with his Glorious Arm, to make him&s;elf an Everla&s;ting Name. Oh then, let <HI>New-England</HI> be a Name and a Prai&s;e to our God! Oh let us be according to our Profe&s;&s;ion, and our Priviledges! Our Profe&s;&s;ion runs very high. The name of a <HI>New-England</HI> man hath &s;ometime been wont to carry a &s;ound of Sancti|ty along with it. Mo&s;t &s;urely our Obligations are very great, that call us to Holine&s;s. Our

<P>The <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> may Cart the Ark of God, but if <HI>David</HI> do it, wo be to <HI>Uzza, 1 Sam.</HI> 8. 11, 15.
