<P>CONSIDERING the curious Workman&s;hip of God, in the Regularity, comely Proportion and mutual U&s;efulne&s;s of all things, in their Original Frame &amp; Contexture; and how all kinds of Creatures did &s;erve in their &s;everal Places, and accord|ing to their &s;everal Capacities, to &s;hew forth the Glory of Him who gave them their Being, Beauty and Activity; 'tis a wonderful and aba&s;ing Con&s;ideration, to every Contempla|tive

&amp; Serious Soul, that there is now no more Stability and Decency, e&s;pecially in humane Proceedings. But that Darkne&s;s, Di&s;order, Sin and Death, have thus Invaded, and over|run the World. Indeed the World has &s;uf|fered Mi&s;erable Overthrow and Ship wreck; but it is a &s;trange as &s;ad, that nothing will reduce the Children of Men, to that Love &amp; Obedience to their Maker which was Origi|nally founded in their Natures.</P>
<P>When the Lord appeared in his Greatne&s;s on Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> it look't as if men would be afraid to be <HI>bad I&s;raelites</HI>; and in His Graciou&s;|ne&s;s on Mount-<HI>Sion,</HI> as if men would be per|&s;waded to be <HI>&s;trict Chri&s;tians</HI>: but thus it is, Scarcely any thing le&s;s than <HI>Heaven,</HI> will make the Saint Serious; or any thing le&s;s than <HI>Hell,</HI> will make the Sinner Silent. There is and will be Sin in the be&s;t of Saints; and Sinners in the be&s;t Regulated Societies &amp; Churches.</P>
<P>Indeed the Apo&s;tolick was a truly Golden Age; yet in the Churches of Chri&s;t there was Dro&s;s as well as pure Gold; there were Infirm Saints, &amp; bold Sinners Hypocrites &amp; Fal&s;e|hearted, as well as Sound and Sincere Pro|fe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle mentioned in the beginning of this Book, &s;pent great part of his Mini&s;try among the &s;even Churches of the <HI>le&s;&s;er Asia</HI>;

and mo&s;t of them were grown Corrupt &amp; De|fective, when he wrote to them from the I&s;le, where he was Confined, for the Te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This Book in General Contains many Pro|phetick Vi&s;ions; and in them a &s;olemn repre|&s;entation of the pre&s;ent and &s;ucceeding State of the Church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This Epi&s;tle is particularly directed to the Seven Principal Churches of this <HI>Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia,</HI> and the three Fir&s;t Chapters altho' they ex|pre&s;ly mention the&s;e Churches and no others, yet (the number Seven in Scripture Signifying a compleat thing) they Indifferently re&s;pect the Univer&s;al, under &s;uch like circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t part of this Chapter, the Apo&s;tle directs him&s;elf to the Church in <HI>Sardis,</HI> in the Per&s;on of the Angel or Over&s;eer of it. Where we have.</P>
<P N="1">I. A De&s;cription of its State. That altho' it had a <HI>Name to Live,</HI> yet <HI>was really Dead,</HI> or at les&s;t <HI>ready to Die.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. A Remedy pre&s;cribed again&s;t the Di&s;ea&s;e, under which it Laboured. <HI>Be Watchful, &amp;c. Remember therefore, how thou ha&s;t received, and heard, and hold fa&s;t and repent:</HI> To return to their fir&s;t &s;tate, &amp; have recour&s;e to the primi|tive in&s;titution, &amp; form of Doctrine delivered to them by the Apo&s;tles &amp; Apo&s;tolical men.

Doubtle&s;s <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Rule borrowed from hence, is very &s;afe &amp; may be depended upon, viz. <HI>Quicquid primum Illud verum.</HI></P>

<P N="4">4. A Commendation given to &s;ome who had kept them&s;elves from tho&s;e Corruptions, which prevail'd among the re&s;t: together with due Incouragement given to all to return to God. <HI>v.</HI> 4. &amp; 5.</P>
<P>What I would take notice of in the Words read; is a di&s;covery of the Un&s;ound (or a General De&s;cription of the) Condition of the once Gloriou Church of Chri&s;t in <HI>Sardis.</HI> And it is put in mind,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What it was in Name.</HI> Or what it &s;eem'd to be. <HI>Thou ha&s;t a Name that thou live&s;t.</HI> It not only retained its Name of Chri&s;tian Church, and made a Publick Profe&s;&s;ion of the only true Religion in the World, but was Favoured with agreeable Advantages; and &s;o might be yet very con&s;iderable, in the ac|count of &s;uch as took notice of the out&s;ide, or &s;hew, but not of the Power of Religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When it was in Reality: And art Dead.</HI> Not Ab&s;olutely, but Comparatively; for there were a few names in <HI>Sardis</HI> that had not Defiled their Garments. Altho the general|lity

were gone off from God, yet there were &s;ome few that cleaved to him. As for re&s;t altho'they might retain &s;omewhat of the form of Godline&s;s, yet had in a great Mea&s;ure lo&s;t that good Spirit, which had before Influ|enced them, and kept them alive. So that they were now Dead. Or as &s;aid in the next Ver&s;e, <HI>ready to Die.</HI> What ever the World thought' of them, or they of them|&s;elves; altho their Profe&s;&s;ion might be high, and their Advantages con&s;iderable, yet they were evidently and certainly Langui&s;hing.</P>
<P>Hence the Truth which offers it &s;elf to us; &amp; may be In&s;i&s;ted on at this time is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That a People may, &amp; &s;ometimes have a Name to Live; and yet are really in a Dying Condition.</P>
<P>A Man may e&s;teem him&s;elf, &amp; be look't up|on by others as having a healthy &amp; firm Con|&s;titution; when &s;ome fatal Di&s;ea&s;e has Sei&s;ed him in a Vital Part. A Man may nave the Advantage of a fair E&s;tate, and yet be really Poor. And not only a Per&s;on, but a People may &s;eem to be &s;omething, when they are nothing. The Church of the <HI>Laodiceans</HI> &s;aid it was <HI>Rich &amp; increa&s;ed in Goods,</HI> and had <HI>need of nothing.</HI> And yet was <HI>Wretched, &amp; Mi&s;erable, &amp; Poor, &amp; Blind, &amp; Naked.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002123_0008_0FBC1F5E356C54A0">And if we look back to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of Old we &s;hall find, that there was no Nation upon Earth &s;o Favoured; that had &s;uch a Name and privi|ledges: <HI>God did lead his people like a Flock, by the hand of Mo&s;es &amp; Aaron.</HI> P&s;al. 77. ult. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was as a King in the Army; and <HI>Aaron</HI> Mi|ni&s;tered in things that were Typical &amp; Sacred: <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> brought their cau&s;es before GOD; and <HI>Aaron</HI> Offered their Sacrifices to God, and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had Laws, Statutes, Judgments and Or|dinances accordingly: Yet were they a <HI>Proud, Stiff-necked, Murmuring, Unbelieving, Ugrateful &amp; Idolatrous People</HI>; And did Back&s;lide from God, with a perpetual Back&s;liding.</P>
<P><HI>Baalam</HI> in the Twenty-third and Twenty|forth Chapters of <HI>Numbers,</HI> &s;eems to be Tran&s;|ported, at the light of <HI>I&s;raels</HI> Glory &amp; Felicity: And yet in the very next Chapter, we Read of <HI>I&s;rels</HI> Committing Whoredom with the Daughters of <HI>Moab,</HI> and Joyning them&s;elves unto <HI>Baal-peor.</HI></P>

Martyr <HI>Stephen</HI> (after he had given them a &s;hort account how Gods gentlene&s;s had made them great) calls them <HI>Stiff-necked, &amp; Uncir|cumci&s;ed in Heart, and Ears</HI>; Tells them that they did <HI>always Re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t; as their Fathers did &s;o did they.

<P><HI>I&s;rael</HI> indeed did &s;ometimes revive a little; when God rai&s;ed up &s;ome Eminent Reformers of poured out his Wrath upon them in ter|rible manner. Yet their returnings to God were Ordinarily Hypocritical, or Partial, or of no long continuance: For indeed the Body of them were rotten at the Heart, and their Wound Incurable.</P>
<P>In Speaking to the Truth before us, I &s;hall Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">I. When a People may be &s;aid to have a Name to Live.</P>
<P N="2">II. When they may be &s;aid to be in Dy|ing Condition. And,</P>
<P N="3">III. What makes &s;uch a People thus De|cline and Langui&s;h.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="002123_0010_0FBC1FB8E42BBC30">I. <HI>When a People may be &s;aid to have a Name to Live.</HI> Now a People may be &s;aid to have a Name to Live, on the account of the great &s;hew &amp; appearance which they make of Li|ving. Now in this a Peoples real Advantages may be very con&s;iderable. And at this time we &s;hall rather in&s;i&s;t on the Privileges &amp; Ad|vantages which a People Enjoy, than upon the meer Profe&s;&s;ion &amp; &s;hew which they make.</P>
<P>So then People may be &s;aid to have a Name to Live, on the account,</P>
<P N="1">(I.) Of their <HI>Civil.</HI> (2.) Of their <HI>Sacred Intere&s;ts</HI> and Advantages.</P>
<P N="1">[I.] With re&s;pect to their <HI>Civil Advantages</HI> &amp; Priviledges. And this may be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">I. With re&s;pect to the Rules by which a People are Guided. And</P>
<P N="2">2. With re&s;pect to the Rulers by whom they are Governed.</P>
<P N="1">(I.) With re&s;pect to the <HI>Rules</HI> by which a People are Guided. And they are contained in a certain Body of Laws, Compo&s;ed, Altered, &amp; Increa&s;ed, by Per&s;ons of great Wi&s;dom, Fi|delity &amp; Piety ('tis like not without many Serious Prayers to God) &amp; &s;o Accommodated to the State, &amp; Circum&s;tances of that People for whom they are made.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) With re&s;pect to the <HI>Rulers</HI> by whom they are Governed. And they are &s;uch (for
<PB N="9" REF="002123_0011_0FBC1FBB9927C9F0">
'tis &s;uppo&s;ed that nothing hinders except among a People them&s;elves, but that they may have &s;uch to Rule over them if &s;uch there be) as are qualifyed according to the direction of Gods Word.</P>
<P>And &s;o under who&s;e Wi&s;e &amp; Faithful Con|duct, a People may &s;it &s;afely, and Comfortably under their own Vines and Fig-trees: The Feeble, the Simple, the Poor, the Fatherle&s;s &amp; Widow, may Shelter them&s;elves from the Violence and Fury of the Oppre&s;&s;or. Mens Lives, Liberties &amp; Properties may be Secured from the Malignant, Proud and Covetous: Controver&s;ies may be Decided, doubtful Cau&s;es Determined; Good Orders E&s;tabli&s;h|ed, the Vertuous Incouraged, Well-doers Re|warded; Criminals, Prophane and Profligate Per&s;ons Puni&s;hed, and brought to Shame. In a word all things that tend to a Peoples Ad|vancement, may be farthered; and all things that tend to their Ruine and Di&s;&s;olution Suppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Moreover &s;uch Rulers are as a <HI>Fortre&s;s, and Bulwark to Religion.</HI> For &s;uch Incourage, Command, and &s;ee to it, that Mini&s;ters, and Men of all Ranks and Conditions, Wor&s;hip God in a Solemn Manner; that God be Pub|lickly Magnify'd for all his Favours. That Men Humble them&s;elves for their Sins, and

under Gods Judgments. They Di&s;counte|nance and Puni&s;h bold Intruders, &amp; &s;uch as Advance Damnable Doctrines and endeavour to Subvert the E&s;tabli&s;hed Religion; the In|terrupters of Gods Wor&s;hip and Ordinances, the Prophaners of Gods Holy Sabbaths, the Bla&s;phemous, and &s;uch like.</P>
<P N="2">[2.] In re&s;pect to their <HI>Sacred Intere&s;ts,</HI> and Privileges.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P>When they have the True Word of God among them; and that in their own proper Dialect, which they may u&s;e without re&s;traint, and in which they have a &s;ufficient account concerning God, &amp; them&s;elves; of the Works of God in Creation, Providence &amp; Redemption; Precepts to Awaken, Oblige &amp; Guide them; &amp; Promi&s;es to Quicken amp; Encourage them. Or in a Word what&s;oever is nece&s;&s;ary to Furni&s;h men throughly to every good Thought and Affection, Word and Action. Al&s;o when a People have God him&s;elf nigh them, ready to hear their Crys, to Correct their Errors, to Supply their Wants, and to give His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him. Moreover when a People have Gods Mini&s;ters, who Labour to Convince their Con&s;ciences, to &s;tir their Af|fections &amp; Inclinations; e&s;pecially in things that relate to Faith, Repentance and New|Obedience;

do Solemnly Admini&s;ter the Seals of the New Covenant, Reprove Sinners, and cut off the Incorrigible from the Inheri|tance of the Lord.</P>
<P>Now altho' a People &s;o Favoured, may be Langui&s;hing and Dying with re&s;pect to their Spirit and Practice, in things truly amiable; yet the&s;e things put them under great Ad|vantages of moving, toward the Unity of the Faith, &amp; of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the mea&s;ure of the Stature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t, as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;eth it, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.I3.</P>
<P>We may &s;ay concerning &s;uch a People, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> concerning I&s;rael, &mdash; <HI>That the natios which &s;hall hear all the&s;e &s;tatutes, and &s;ay, Surely this great nation is a wi&s;e &amp; under&s;tanding people.

And what nation is there &s;o great, that has &s;tatutes &amp; judgments &s;o righteous</HI> &mdash;? Deut. 4, 6, 7, 8. It was &s;poken of, as a &s;ingular Favour, that God made known <HI>His word unto Jacob, His &s;tatutes and judgments unto I&s;rael.</HI> P&s;al. I47.I9.

As there is a time to ri&s;e, &s;o ordinarily a time to fall. The Wi&s;e man gives us a very apt Figurative De|&s;cription, of the Decline of Humane Strength &amp; Glory; the Decrepit State of the Children of Men, after a con&s;iderable &s;pace of Health, Strength, Beauty and Activity. <HI>In the day when the keepers of the hou&s;e &s;hall tremble, and the &s;trong men &s;hall bow them&s;elves, and the grinders cea&s;e becau&s;e they are few, and tho&s;e that look out of the windows be darkned, And the doors &s;hall be &s;hut in the &s;treets, when the &s;ound of the grinding is low, and he &s;hall ri&s;e up at the voice of the Bird, And all the daughters of mu&s;ick &s;hall be brought low;

Al&s;o when they &s;hall be afraid of that which is high, and fears &s;hall be in the way, and the almond-tree &s;hall flouri&s;h &amp; the gra&s;hopper &s;hall be a burden, and de&s;ire &s;hall fail,</HI> Eccl.

<P>When a People have had their Flouri&s;hing time, and are pa&s;t the Flower of their Age; If Ju&s;tice, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Holine&s;s, Meekne&s;s, Brotherly-kindne&s;s, &amp; Charity, meet with ano|ther manner of Entertainment than hereto|fore; it would be as Wonderful as Comfortable, if &s;uch a People &s;hould again return to the days of their Youth.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the means u&s;ed for a Peoples Re|covery prove Ineffectual.

Thus when a People are come to that pa&s;s, that neither Sickne&s;s, or Health, War or Peace, Scarcity or Plenty, Mercies or Judgments, Corro&s;ives or Leni|tives; the unweared endeavours of the Magi&s;|tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Mini&s;try avail, to a Peoples Con|ver&s;ion;

or &s;o much as to any con&s;iderable degree of Reformation; but a People will run over Law and Go&s;pel, and do that which is right in their own Eyes, in De&s;pite of the Powers above and below; they are like the Ground that Yearly brings forth nothing <HI>but Briers &amp; Thorns</HI>; (Notwith&s;tanding its drink|ing in the rains that come oft upon it) and is therefore Rejected nigh unto Cur&s;ing, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6 8 Or like the Vineyard, which after all that was be&s;towed upon it, brought forth nothing but <HI>Wild Grapes</HI>; and was therefore Condemned to be laid wa&s;te, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 5.6.</P>
<P N="3">3. When a People have no Heart, and &s;o will take no pains to help them&s;elves. Not only refu&s;e, and &s;corn the Help of others, but will do nothing for their own Relief.

<P>If any &s;uch Covet the Honour of being Rulers; they may do Wi&s;ely to con&s;ider, the Burden as well as the Honour of Government: And what an Emperor once &s;aid when he Ob|&s;erved people to gaze on his Purple Robe and Golden Crown, <HI>Did you know what Cares are under them, you would not take them from the Ground to have them.</HI></P>
<P>If Honour be the thing that &s;uch aim at, they &s;hould therewith remember, that they would take but little Plea&s;ure in it, if others &s;hould at this rate attempt to practi&s;e upon them: Yea a Vain-glorious Spirit, can &s;carcely bear the lea&s;t Affront. <HI>Haman</HI> declared, that <HI>the glory of his Riches,</HI> the <HI>multitude of his Chil|dren; and the &s;ingular re&s;pect the King and Queen had &s;hewed him,</HI> (having honoured him above the re&s;t of the Princes) <HI>Availed him nothing.

<P>You will give me leave (<HI>Honourable &amp; Wor|&s;hipful</HI>) Humbly and Submi&s;&s;ively to Be&s;eech You <HI>to do what may be done for this langui&s;hing People that are round about you.</HI> You have for &s;ome time ob&s;erved us to be <HI>ready to Die</HI>; but as yet we are not <HI>quite Dead.</HI></P>

<P>There be many that can do little more than Pray for us; and tho&s;e that are Per&s;ons of con&s;iderable Abilities, are obliged to re&s;train the Improvement of them, within the bounda|ries of their &s;everal Stations: And that which might be very Di&s;orderly, and &s;inful in &s;ome others to do or attempt, may be a great Duty &amp; vertue in Rulers. <HI>GOD is a God of Order,</HI> not of <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI>: And as in a Natural Body, &s;o in a Civil, there be indeed <HI>many Members</HI>; yet all have not the &s;ame, but their <HI>&s;everal Offices.</HI> So that altho' the de&s;ign of an action be good, yet if in the doing of it men break their Ranks, and &s;tep out of their Places, God will not be well Plea&s;ed with them.

Judgment, that they might be able to re&s;train and &s;ubdue tho&s;e hardy Sinners, that will not be reduced by Coun&s;el, Per&s;wa&s;ion, or Ex|ample.</P>
<P>Again; Altho' it may be very di&s;couraging in it &s;elf, to be Concerned with a People of a froward &s;pirit; yet the more trouble&s;om we are grown, the more need have we of your Zeal and united Endeavours for our Amend|ment.</P>
<P>If Rulers at &s;uch a time &s;hould &s;lacken their Hands, good Men in &s;ome pang of Zeal, might be apt to &s;tep out of their Places: And as for the Wicked, they want nothing but an oppor|tunity to thru&s;t them&s;elves into other mens Offices; and put all things into Confu&s;ion. <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> per&s;waded the people, that there was no man deputed to hear them: and then adds, <HI>Oh that I were made a judge in the land, that every man that hath any &s;uit or cau&s;e, would come to me, and I would do him ju&s;tice,</HI> 2 Sam.

<P>And further; It is to be Acknowledged, that you have done many worthy deeds a|mong us, and for us. And altho' there may be ungrateful and ungovernable Spirits among us; yet 'tis to be hoped that there remains very &s;ignificant numbers, that will heartily Submit to your Government, and &s;trengthen your Hands, in all your further endeavours for our good.</P>
<P>Moreover; If you &s;hould recover us, you would have a double portion of the Glory and Comfort of &s;uch a happy Revolution: You &s;hall &s;pend the remains of your days in quiet; after you have &s;een what I doubt not you pre|fer above <HI>your chief Joy.</HI> You &s;hall be highly E&s;teemed; and men every where, &s;hall Ble&s;s God that hath made you the healers of our breaches; yea you &s;hall (by way of Eminency) be had in everla&s;ting Remembrance.</P>
<P>Al&s;o; I may &s;ay, we are a People, many of who&s;e Fathers, were &s;ome of <HI>the be&s;t of Men.</HI> Men of excellent Spirits. We may in a good &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to be <HI>Children of the &s;tock of Abra|ham</HI>:

<P>And may I here add; That when you &s;hall arrive at the plea&s;ant Land, tho&s;e of our Fa|thers that are gone before, &s;hall Embrace you, with exceeding Joy &amp; Thankfulne&s;s for your Care &amp; Kindne&s;s, to their Peri&s;hing Progeny.</P>
<P>Finally; So often as your Inferiours &s;tand before you at the Bar; are you put in mind of the great, and Notable Day: when you &s;hall be plentifully rewarded, for all the good, you have done, or may do, for us.

<P>Both God and Men expect, that the Zeal, Wi&s;dom and Faithfulne&s;s of this venerable
<PB N="37" REF="002123_0039_0FBC1FED5D865980">
Order of men, &s;hould be &s;omewhat Excelling. Such are called the <HI>Salt of the Earth, &amp; Light of the World.</HI> And as they <HI>repre&s;ent CHRIST,</HI> &s;o its expected that they &s;hould <HI>imitate him,</HI> and cleave clo&s;er to him, (e&s;pecially in a De|clining time) than is expected from &s;ome o|thers. CHRIST was Indu&s;trious, Zealous, Holy, Harmle&s;s, and Undefiled; and &s;pent His whole time and life, for the de&s;troying Satans Kingdom, &amp; advancing the Kingdom of God in the World: All his Mini&s;ters &s;hould, and all good Mini&s;ters will labour to be, &amp; do &s;o. Much is expected from tho&s;e that <HI>Profe&s;s Chri&s;t</HI>; but more from &s;uch as <HI>Per&s;onate Him.</HI> It was a very &s;olemn Que&s;tion our SAVIOUR put to the Apo&s;tles, <HI>Will ye al&s;o go away</HI>? Joh. 6.67. Which &s;hews that if all others &s;hould Apo&s;tatize &amp; for&s;ake him, yet he expects that his <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> &s;hould &s;tand by him. Its left upon Record for an everla&s;ting Prai&s;e to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> that they continued with CHRIST in his <HI>Temptations,</HI> Luk. 22.28.</P>
<P>Again; The work of &s;uch men is a work of the greate&s;t Weight and Moment: They are properly &amp; nextly Concerned about the <HI>Souls of Men,</HI> and their <HI>Eternal Salvation.</HI> If a man lo&s;e his Life thro' the neglect of him that hath the charge of it, yet 'tis po&s;&s;ible his Soul may be Saved; or if he lo&s;e his E&s;tate in like man|ner;
<PB N="38" REF="002123_0040_0FBC1FEEE411DF18">
yet 'tis po&s;&s;ible he may recover him&s;elf, and gain another as good or better: But if the Soul be lo&s;t the man is gone forever. All the trea&s;ures in the World cannot make up this Lo&s;s. <HI>It's not thou&s;ands of Rams,</HI> or <HI>ten thou&s;ands of rivers of Oil that can redeem him,</HI> Mic. 6.7. Therefore they that have the charge of Souls, have a concern of Infinite Worth.</P>
<P>Again; Such by rea&s;on of the Nature of their work, are advantaged to be &s;ome of the mo&s;t Spiritual men in the world. Their work is properly Spiritual: they are nece&s;&s;arily, principally, and in a manner intirely, taken up about &s;uch things, as nextly concern, the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, and the Eternal State of men, <HI>They &s;hall teach Jacob thy judgments, and I&s;rael thy law: they &s;hall put incen&s;e before thee, &amp; whole burnt-&s;acrifice upon thine altar,</HI> Deut. 33 I0 Such are under &s;ingular Advantages to know the Will of God; to be Confirmed &amp; E&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the great Doctrines of the Go&s;pel: to know the Greatne&s;s &amp; Cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ainty of mans Mi&s;ery by the Fir&s;t, and of his Felicity and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s by the Second <HI>Adam.</HI> And Chri&s;t &s;eems to have put &s;o much of his Spirit and Power upon Mini&s;ters, as gives them &s;ome peculiar advantages of influence upon the Children of men.</P>
<P>It being thus, its expected that Mini&s;ters be
