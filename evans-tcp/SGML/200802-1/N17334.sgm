<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AGREEABLY to your reque&s;t contained in your letter of the 29th of Augu&s;t, 1789, I have at la&s;t &s;et down to communicate &s;uch facts to you, upon the &s;ubject of migration to this country, as have been the re&s;ult of numerous enquiries and faithful ob&s;ervation. I am aware that this &s;ubject has been handled in a ma&s;terly manner by doctor Franklin, in his excel|lent little pamphlet, entitled "Advice to tho&s;e who would wi&s;h to remove to America," but as that valuable little work is very general, and as many important changes have occurred in the affairs of the united &s;tates &s;ince its publication, I &s;hall endeavour to comply with your wi&s;hes, by adding &s;uch things as have been omitted by the doctor, and &s;hall accommodate them to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our country.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin this letter by mentioning the de&s;criptions of peo|ple, who ought not to come to America.</P>
<P>I. Men of independent fortunes who can exi&s;t only in compa|ny, and who can conver&s;e only upon public amu&s;ements, &s;hould not think of &s;ettling in the united &s;tates. I have known &s;everal men of that character in this country, who have rambled from &s;tate to &s;tate, complaining of the dulne&s;s of each of them, and who have finally returned and renewed their former connexions and plea&s;ures in Europe.</P>
<P>II. Literary men, who have no profe&s;&s;ional pur&s;uits, will often langui&s;h in America, from the want of &s;ociety. Our authors and &s;cholars are generally men of bu&s;ine&s;s, and make their literary pur&s;uits &s;ub&s;ervient to their intere&s;ts. A lounger in book &s;tores, breakfa&s;ting parties for the purpo&s;e of literary conver&s;ation, and long attic evenings, are as yet but little known in this country. Our companies are generally mixed, and conver&s;ation in them is a medley of ideas upon all &s;ubjects. They begin as in England with the weather&mdash;&s;oon run into politics&mdash;now and then diverge into literature&mdash;and commonly conclude with facts relative to commerce, manufactures and agriculture, and the be&s;t means of acquiring and improving an e&s;tate, Men, who are philo&s;o|phers
<PB N="4" REF="022390_0003_0FB86DE04036C770">
or poets, without other pur&s;uits, had better end their days in an old country.</P>
<P>III. The united &s;tates as yet afford but little encouragement to the profe&s;&s;ors of mo&s;t of the fine arts. Painting and &s;culpture flouri&s;h chiefly in wealthy and luxurious countries. Our native American portrait painters who have not &s;ought protection and encouragement in Great Britain, have been obliged to travel occa|&s;ionally from one &s;tate to another in order to &s;upport them&s;elves. The teachers of mu&s;ic have been more fortunate in America. A ta&s;te for this accompli&s;hment prevails very generally in our large cities: and eminent ma&s;ters in that art, who have arrived here &s;ince the peace, have received con&s;iderable &s;ums of money by exerci&s;ing their profe&s;&s;ion among us.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now mention tho&s;e de&s;criptions of people, who may better their condition by coming to America.</P>
<P>I. To the cultivators of the earth the united &s;tates open the fir&s;t a&s;ylum in the world. To in&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s and happine&s;s of an European farmer in our country, it is nece&s;&s;ary to advi&s;e him either to purcha&s;e, or to rent a farm which has undergone &s;ome improvement.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ettling a new tract of land, and that of im|proving a farm, are of a very different nature. The former mu&s;t be effected by the native American, who is accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of the axe and the grubbing hoe, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es almo&s;t ex|clu&s;ively a knowledge of all the peculiar and namele&s;s arts of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation in the woods. I have known many in&s;tances of Europeans who have &s;pent all their ca&s;h in un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts to force a &s;ettlement in the wilderne&s;s, and who have afterwards been expo&s;ed to poverty and di&s;tre&s;s at a great di&s;tance from friends and even neighbours. I would therefore advi&s;e all farmers with moderate capitals, to purcha&s;e or rent improved farms in the old &s;ettlements of our &s;tates. The price and rent of the&s;e farms are different in the different parts of the union. In Penn&s;ylvania, the price of farms is regulated by the quality of the land&mdash;by the value of the improvements which are erected upon it&mdash;by their vicinity to &s;ea ports and navigable water&mdash;and by the good or bad &s;tate of the roads which lead to them. There is a great variety, of cour&s;e, in the price of farms: while &s;ome of them have been &s;old for five guineas&mdash;others have been &s;old at lower prices, down to one guinea, and even half a gui|nea
<PB N="5" REF="022390_0004_0FB86DE1B8F84E08">
per acre, according as they were varied by the above circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>It is not expected that the whole price of a farm &s;hould be paid at the time of purcha&s;ing it. An half, a third, or a fourth, is all that is generally required. Bonds and mortgages are given for the remainder, (and &s;ometimes without intere&s;t) payable in two, three, five, or even ten years.</P>
<P>The value of the&s;e farms has often been doubled and even trebled, in a few years, where the new mode of agriculture has been employed in cultivating them: &s;o that a man with a mo|derate capital, may, in the cour&s;e of fifteen years, become an opulent and independent freeholder.</P>
<P>If, notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid of the difficulties of effect|ing an e&s;tabli&s;hment in the woods, the low price of the new lands &s;hould tempt the European farmer to &s;ettle in them, then let me add, that it can only be done by a&s;&s;ociating him&s;elf in a large company, under the direction of an active and intelligent Ame|rican farmer. To &s;ecure even <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> company of European &s;ettlers from di&s;appointment and want in the woods, it will be nece&s;&s;a|ry to clear a few acres of land the year before, and to &s;ow them with grain, in order to provide &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the company, till they can provide for them&s;elves, by clearing their own farms. The difficulties of e&s;tabli&s;hing this new &s;ettlement, will be fur|ther le&s;&s;ened, if a few cabins, a gri&s;t and a &s;aw mill be erect|ed, at the &s;ame time the preparations are made for the temporary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the company. In this manner, mo&s;t of the fir&s;t &s;ettlements of the New England men have been made in this country. One great advantage, attending this mode of &s;ettling, is, a company may always carry with them a clergyman and a &s;choolma&s;ter, of the &s;ame religion and language with them&s;elves. If a &s;ettler in the woods &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a ta&s;te for rural elegance, he may gratify it without any expen&s;e, by the manner of laying out his farm. He may &s;hade his hou&s;e by means of ancient and venerable fore&s;t-trees. He may leave rows of them &s;tanding, to adorn his lanes and walks&mdash;or clu&s;ters of them on the high grounds of his fields, to &s;hade his cattle. If he &s;hould fix upon any of tho&s;e parts of our we&s;tern country, which are covered with the &s;ugar-tree, he may enclo&s;e a &s;ufficient number of them to &s;upply his family with &s;ugar; and may confer upon them at the &s;ame time the order and beauty of a fine orchard. In this manner, a highly-improved &s;eat may be cut out of the woods
<PB N="6" REF="022390_0005_0FB86DE76F6335D8">
in a few years, which will &s;urpa&s;s both in elegance and value a farm in an old &s;ettlement, which has been for twenty years the &s;ubject of improvements in ta&s;te and agriculture. To con|template a dwelling-hou&s;e&mdash;a barn&mdash;&s;tables&mdash;fields&mdash;meadows&mdash;an orchard&mdash;a garden, &amp;c. which have been produced from ori|ginal creation by the labour of a &s;ingle life, is, I am told, to the proprietor of them, one of the highe&s;t plea&s;ures the mind of man is capable of enjoying. But how much mu&s;t this plea&s;ure be increa&s;ed, when the regularity of art is blended in the pro&s;pect, with the wildne&s;s and antiquity of nature?</P>
<P>It has been remarked in this country, that clearing the land of its woods, &s;ometimes makes a new &s;ettlement unhealthy, by expo&s;ing its damp grounds to the action of the &s;un. To obviate this evil, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ettler either to drain and cultivate his low grounds, as &s;oon as they are cleared, or to leave a body of trees between his dwelling hou&s;e, and the &s;pots from whence the morbid effluvia are derived. The la&s;t of the&s;e methods has, in no in&s;tance that I have heard of, failed of pre&s;erving whole families from &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es as ari&s;e from damp or putrid exhalations.</P>
<P>To country gentlemen, who have been accu&s;tomed to live upon the income of a landed e&s;tate in Europe, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to communicate the following information, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that farms, in con|&s;equence of the unproductive woodland, which is generally con|nected with them, &s;eldom yield more than three or four per cent. a year in ca&s;h, except in the neighbourhood of large cities. Be|&s;ides, from the facility with which money eno may be &s;aved in a few years, to purcha&s;e land in this country, tenants will not accept of long lea&s;es: and hence they are not &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted in the farms they rent, to keep them in repair. If country gentlemen wi&s;h to derive the greate&s;t advantage from laying out their money in lands, they mu&s;t re&s;ide in their vicinity. A capital of five thou&s;and guineas, inve&s;ted in a number of contiguous farms, in an improved part of our country, and cultivated by tenants under the eye and direction of a landlord, would &s;oon yield a greater income than double that &s;um would in mo&s;t parts of Europe. The landlord in this ca&s;e mu&s;t frequently vi&s;it and in|&s;pect the &s;tate of each of his farms: and now and then he mu&s;t &s;top to repair a bridge or a fence in his excur&s;ions through them. He mu&s;t receive all his rents in the produce of the farms. If the tenant find his own &s;tock, he will pay a half of all the grain he
<PB N="7" REF="022390_0006_0FB86DE939E78838">
rai&s;es, and &s;ometimes a certain proportion of vegetables and live &s;tock, to his landlord. The divi&s;ion of the grain is generally made in the field, in &s;heaves or &s;tacks, which are carried home to be thra&s;hed in the barn of the landlord. An e&s;tated gentleman, who can reconcile him&s;elf to this kind of life, may be both hap|py and u&s;eful. He may in&s;truct his tenants by his example, as well as precepts in the new modes of hu&s;bandry: he may teach them the art and advantages of gardening: he may in&s;pire them with habits of &s;obriety, indu&s;try, and economy; and thereby become the father and protector of a dependant and affectionate neighbourhood. After a bu&s;y &s;ummer and autumn, he may pa&s;s his winters in the bo&s;om of &s;ociety, in any of our cities, and in many of our country villages.</P>
<P>But &s;hould he be di&s;inclined to &s;uch exten&s;ive &s;cenes of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, he may confine his purcha&s;es and labours to a &s;ingle farm, and &s;ecure his &s;uperfluous ca&s;h in bonds and mortgages, which will yield him &s;ix per cent.</P>
<P>Under this head, it is proper to mention, that the agricultural life begins to maintain in the united &s;tates, the &s;ame rank that it has long maintained in Great Britain. Many gentlemen of education among us have quitted liberal profe&s;&s;ions, and have proved, by their &s;ucce&s;s in farming, that philo&s;ophy is in no bu|&s;ine&s;s more u&s;eful or profitable, than in agriculture.</P>
<P>II. MECHANICS and MANUFACTURERS, of every de&s;crip|tion, will find certain encouragement in the united &s;tates. During the connexion of this country with Great Britain, we were taught to believe that agriculture and commerce &s;hould be the only pur&s;uits of the Americans: but experiments and reflexion have taught us that our country abounds with re&s;ources for ma|nufactures of all kinds; and that mo&s;t of them may be conduct|ed with great advantage in all the &s;tates. We are already nearly independent of the whole world for iron-work, paper, and malt liquors: and great progre&s;s has been made in the manufactories of gla&s;s, pot-a&s;h, and cloths of all kinds. The commercial habits of our citizens have as yet prevented their employ|ing large capitals in tho&s;e manufactories: but I am per|&s;uaded that if a few European adventurers would embark in them with capitals equal to the demand for tho&s;e manufactures, they would &s;oon find an immen&s;e profit in their &s;peculations. A &s;ingle farmer in the &s;tate of New York, with a capital of five thou&s;and pounds, has cleared one thou&s;and a year by the manu|facture of pot-a&s;h alone.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="022390_0007_0FB86DEC409AD0D0">
Tho&s;e mechanical arts, which are accommodated to the infant and &s;imple &s;tate of a country, will bid faire&s;t to &s;ucceed among us. Every art, connected with cultivating the earth&mdash;building hou&s;es and &s;hips, and feeding and clothing the body, will meet with encouragement in this country. The price of provi&s;ions are &s;o different in the different &s;tates, and even in the different parts of the &s;ame &s;tate, and very &s;o much with the plenty and &s;ecurity of money, that it would be difficult to give you &s;uch an account of them, as would be u&s;eful. I need only remark that the di&s;proportion between the price of labour and of provi&s;ions, is much greater in every part of the united &s;tates, than in any part of Europe: and hence our trade&s;men every where eat meat and butter every day: and mo&s;t of them realize the wi&s;h of Henry IV. of France, for the pea&s;ants of his kingdom, by din|ing not only once, but two or three times, upon poultry, in every week of the year.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ingular fact in the hi&s;tory of the mechanical arts in this country, that the &s;ame arts &s;eldom de&s;cend from father to &s;on. Such are the profits of even the humble&s;t of them, that the &s;ons of mechanics generally ri&s;e from the lower to the more re|&s;pectable occupations: and thus their families gradually a&s;cend to the fir&s;t ranks in &s;ociety among us. The influence, which the pro&s;pects of wealth and con&s;equence have in invigorating in|du&s;try in every line of mechanical bu&s;ine&s;s, is very great. Many of the fir&s;t men in America, are the &s;ons of reputable me|chanics or farmers. But I may go farther, and add, that many men, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves both in the cabinet and field, in the late war, had been mechanics. I know the Briti&s;h offi|cers treated the American cau&s;e with contempt, from this cir|cum&s;tance: but the event of the war &s;hewed, that the confidence of America was not mi&s;placed in that body of citizens.</P>
<P>III. LABOURERS may depend upon con&s;tant employment in the united &s;tates, both in our towns and in the country. When they work by the day, they receive high wages: but the&s;e are &s;eldom continued through the whole year. A labourer receives annually, with his boarding, wa&s;hing, and lodging, from fifteen to eighteen guineas, in the middle &s;tates. It is agreeable to ob&s;erve this cla&s;s of men frequently rai&s;ed by their indu&s;try from their humble &s;tations into the upper ranks of life, in the cour&s;e of twenty or thirty years.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="022390_0008_0FB86DEDF0E545E0">
IV. PERSONS who are willing to indent them&s;elves as &s;ervants for a few years, will find that humble &s;tation no ob&s;tacle to a future e&s;tabli&s;hment in our country. Many men, who came to America in that capacity, are now in affluent circum&s;tances. Their former &s;ituation, where they have behaved well, does not preclude them from forming re&s;pectable connexions in marriage, nor from &s;haring, if otherwi&s;e qualified, in the offices of our country.</P>
<P>V. The united &s;tates continue to afford encouragement to gen|tlemen of the LEARNED PROFESSIONS, provided they be prudent in their deportment, and of &s;ufficient knowledge: for &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of colleges and &s;chools of learning in all our &s;tates, the &s;ame degrees of learning will not &s;ucceed among us, which &s;ucceeded fifty years ago.</P>
<P>Several lawyers and phy&s;icians, who have arrived here &s;ince the peace, are now in good bu&s;ine&s;s: and many clergymen, na|tives of England, Scotland, and Ireland, are comfortably &s;ettled in good pari&s;hes. A mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel in a country place mu&s;t not expect to have all his &s;alary paid in ca&s;h: but he will notwith&s;tanding &s;eldom fail of obtaining a good &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from his congregation. They will furni&s;h his table with a portion of all the live &s;tock they rai&s;e for their own u&s;e: they will &s;hoe his hor&s;es&mdash;repair his implements of hu&s;bandry&mdash;and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in gathering-in his harve&s;ts, and in many other parts of the bu&s;ine&s;s of his farm. From the&s;e aids, with now and then a little ca&s;h, a clergyman may not only live well, but, in the cour&s;e of his life, may accumulate an hand&s;ome e&s;tate for his children. This will more certainly happen, if he can redeem time enough from his parochial duties, and the care of his farm, to teach a &s;chool. The people of America are of all &s;ects: but the great|e&s;t part of them are of independent, pre&s;byterian, epi&s;copal, bap|ti&s;t, and methodi&s;t denominations. The principles held by each of the&s;e &s;ocieties in America, are the &s;ame as tho&s;e which are held by the prote&s;tant churches in Europe, from which they derive their origin.</P>
<P>VI. SCHOOLMASTERS of good capacities and fair characters, may expect to meet with encouragement in the middle and &s;outhern &s;tates. They will &s;ucceed better, if they confine their in&s;tructions to reading, writing, Engli&s;h grammar, and the &s;ci|ences of number and quantity. The&s;e branches of literature are of general nece&s;&s;ity and utility: and of cour&s;e every town&s;hip will
<PB N="10" REF="022390_0009_0FB86DF210E034A8">
furni&s;h &s;cholars enough for the maintenance of a &s;choolma&s;ter. Many young men have ri&s;en by means of the connexions they have formed in this u&s;eful employment, to rank and con&s;equence in the learned profe&s;&s;ions in every part of this country.</P>
<P>From this account of the united &s;tates, you will ea&s;ily perceive, that they are a hot-bed for indu&s;try and genius in almo&s;t every hu|man pur&s;uit. It is inconceivable how many u&s;eful di&s;coveries nece&s;&s;ity has produced within the&s;e few years, in agriculture and manufactures, in our country. The &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity has produced a ver&s;atility of genius among our citizens: hence we frequently meet with men who have exerci&s;ed two or three different occu|pations or profe&s;&s;ions in the cour&s;e of their lives, according to the influence which intere&s;t, accident, or local circum&s;tances have had upon them. I know that the peculiarities, which have been mentioned in the American character, &s;trike a European, who has been accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider man as a creature of habit, formed by long e&s;tabli&s;hed governments, and hereditary cu&s;toms, as &s;o many deviatons from propriety and order. But a wi&s;e man, who knows that national characters ari&s;e from circum&s;tances, will view the&s;e peculiarities without &s;urpri&s;e, and attribute them wholly to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of manners, &s;ociety, and government in America.</P>
<P>From the numerous competitions in every branch of bu&s;ine&s;s in Europe, &s;ucce&s;s in any pur&s;uit, may be looked upon in the &s;ame light as a prize in a lottery. But the ca&s;e is widely different in America. Here there is room enough for every human talent and virtue to expand and flouri&s;h. This is &s;o invariably true, that I believe there is not an in&s;tance to be found, of an in|du&s;trious, frugal, prudent European, with &s;ober manners, who has not been &s;ucce&s;sful in bu&s;ine&s;s, in this country.</P>
<P>As a further inducement to Europeans to tran&s;port them&s;elves acro&s;s the Ocean, I am obliged to mention a fact that does little honour to the native American; and that is, in all competi|tions for bu&s;ine&s;s, where &s;ucce&s;s depends upon indu&s;try, the Eu|ropean is generally preferred. Indeed, &s;uch is the facility with which property is acquired, that where it does not operate as a &s;timulus to promote ambition, it is &s;ometimes accompanied by a relaxation of indu&s;try in proportion to the number of years or generations which interpo&s;e between the founder of an American family and his po&s;terity. This preference of European mechanics ari&s;es likewi&s;e from the improvements in the different arts, which
<PB N="11" REF="022390_0010_0FB86DF48CCAB050">
are from time to time imported by them into our country. To the&s;e facts I am happy in being able to add, that the years of anarchy, which proved &s;o di&s;gu&s;ting to the Europeans who ar|rived among us immediately after the peace, are now at an end, and that the united &s;tates have at la&s;t adopted a national go|vernment which unites with the vigour of monarchy and the &s;tability of ari&s;tocracy, all the freedom of a &s;imple republic. Its influence already in invigorating indu&s;try, and reviving credit, is univer&s;al. There are &s;everal peculiarities in this government, which cannot fail of being agreeable to Europeans, who are di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;ettle in America.</P>
<P N="1">1. The equal &s;hare of power it holds forth to men of every religious &s;ect. As the fir&s;t fruits of this perfection in our go|vernment, we already &s;ee three gentlemen of the Roman catho|lic church, members of the legi&s;lature of the united &s;tates.</P>
<P N="2">2. Birth in America is not required for holding either power or office in the federal government, except that of pre&s;ident of the united &s;tates. In con&s;equence of this principle of ju&s;tice, not only in the national government, but in all our &s;tate con|&s;titutions, we daily &s;ee the natives of Britain, Ireland, and Ger|many, advanced to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable employments in our country.</P>
<P N="3">3. By a late act of congre&s;s, only two years re&s;idence in the united &s;tates are nece&s;&s;ary to entitle foreigners of good cha|racter to all the privileges of citizen&s;hip. Even that &s;hort period of time has been found &s;ufficient to give &s;trangers a vi&s;ible in|tere&s;t in the &s;tability and freedom of our governments.</P>
<P>It is agreeable to ob&s;erve the influence which our republican governments have already had upon the tempers and manners of our citizens. Amu&s;ement is every where giving way to bu&s;ine&s;s: and local politene&s;s is yielding to univer&s;al civility. We differ about forms and modes in politics: but this difference begins to &s;ubmit to the re&s;traints of moral and &s;ocial obligation. Order and tranquility appear to be the natural con&s;equence of a well-balanced republic: for where men can remove the evils of their governments by frequent elections, they will &s;eldom appeal to the le&s;s certain remedies of mobs or arms. It is with &s;ingular plea&s;ure that I can add further, that notwith&s;tanding the viru|lence of our di&s;&s;en&s;ions about independence and the federal go|vernment, there is now &s;carcely a citizen of the united &s;tates, who is not &s;atisfied with both, and who does not believe this country

to be in a happier and &s;afer &s;ituation, than it was, in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing years of its dependence upon Great Britain.</P>
<P>The encouragement held out to European emigrants, is not the &s;ame in all the &s;tates. New England, New York, and New Jer&s;ey, being nearly filled with cultivators of the earth, afford encouragement chiefly to mechanics and labourers. The inha|bitants of New England have far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the inhabitants of the other &s;tates, in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of numerous and profi|table manufacturies. The&s;e wonderful people di&s;cover the &s;ame degrees of indu&s;try in cultivating the arts of peace, that they did of enterprize and per&s;everance, in the late war. They alrea|dy export large quantities of wrought iron, hats, women's &s;hoes, chee&s;e, and linen and woolen cloth. The &s;tate of New York has likewi&s;e di&s;covered a laudable &s;pirit for manufactures and dome&s;tic improvements. European arti&s;ts, therefore, cannot fail of meeting with encouragement in each of the above &s;tates.</P>
<P>Penn&s;ylvania affords an equal a&s;ylum to all the de&s;criptions of people that have been mentioned, under the &s;econd head of this letter. Agriculture, manufactures, and many of the liberal arts &s;eem to vie with each other for preeminence in this &s;tate. Each of them is under the patronage of numerous and re&s;pectable &s;oci|eties. No &s;tate in the union affords greater re&s;ources for &s;hip|building, malt liquors, maple &s;ugar, &s;ail cloth, iron work, woolen and linen cloths, pot-a&s;h, and gla&s;s. Coal, likewi&s;e, abounds on the &s;hores of the Su&s;quehanna, a large river which runs through half the &s;tate. The variety of &s;ects and nations, which compo&s;e the inhabitants of this &s;tate, has hitherto prevented our having any &s;teady traits in our character. We po&s;&s;e&s;s the virtues and weakne&s;&s;es of mo&s;t of the &s;ects and nations of Europe. But this variety has produced &s;uch a colli&s;ion in opinions and intere&s;ts, as has greatly favoured the progre&s;s of genius in every art and &s;cience. We have been accu&s;ed of being factious by our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates. This mu&s;t be a&s;cribed chiefly to our &s;tate con&s;titution, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed by violence in the beginning of the late war, and which was never a&s;&s;ented to by a majority of the peo|ple. But that majority have at length a&s;&s;erted their power. A convention, compo&s;ed of an equal repre&s;entation of the peo|ple, has met and formed a new con&s;titution, which comprehends in it every principle of liberty and ju&s;t government. From the excellency of this con&s;titution&mdash;from the harmony it has re&s;tored to our citizens&mdash;from the central &s;ituation of our &s;tate&mdash;
<PB N="13" REF="022390_0012_0FB86DF78064E808">
from the number and cour&s;es of our rivers&mdash;from the facility with which we are able to draw the re&s;ources of the lakes to the Delaware&mdash;from the wealth of our capital&mdash;and above all, from the indu&s;try and &s;ober habits of our citizens&mdash;there can be no doubt that Penn&s;ylvania will always maintain the fir&s;t rank, for national pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, in the united &s;tates.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance, peculiar in a great degree to Penn|&s;ylvania, which cannot fail of directing the eyes of the inhabi|tants of &s;everal of the European nations to this &s;tate&mdash;and that is, the natives of Britain, Ireland, Germany, France, Switzer|land, and Holland, may here meet with their former fellow &s;ub|jects, and receive from them that welcome and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which are the natural con&s;equences of the tie of country. So &s;trongly does this principle operate in America, that the natives of Ger|many and Ireland have formed them&s;elves into &s;ocieties in the ci|ty of Philadelphia, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of protecting, advi&s;ing, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting their countrymen, as &s;oon as they &s;et their feet upon the &s;hores of Penn&s;ylvania.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that the lands in Penn&s;ylvania are dearer than in &s;ome of our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates. They &s;ell, it is true, for a greater nominal &s;um, than the lands of the neighbouring &s;tates&punc; but in the end, they are much cheaper. The &s;oil is deep, rich, and durable, and from the &s;uperior indu&s;try and &s;kill of our farmers, our lands are more productive than tho&s;e of our neigh|bours; hence their higher price: for the price of lands is always in a ratio to their quality, produce and &s;ituation: hence likewi&s;e, we are able to tell the value of a farm in any part of the &s;tate, by fir&s;t finding out the quantity of grain an acre will produce, and the price of this grain at the neare&s;t mill or &s;tore, mak|ing &s;ome little allowance for the improvements which are con|nected with the farm. This remark is &s;o univer&s;ally true, that a farmer never mi&s;takes the application of it in purcha&s;ing land. There is a certain in&s;tinct, which governs in all purcha&s;es and &s;ales of farms, and which ari&s;es out of the principle I have men|tioned: it is in general as accurate, as if it aro&s;e out of the nice&s;t calculation. It is from an ignorance or neglect of this prin|ciple, that &s;o many of our citizens have migrated to Kentucke, under a delu&s;ive expectation of purcha&s;ing lands cheaper than in the old &s;tates. They are, in fact often much dearer, when you e&s;timate their price by the profit of the grain which is cultivated upon them. For in&s;tance: an acre of land in Kentucke,
<PB N="14" REF="022390_0013_0FB86DFA886A82B0">
which &s;ells for a quarter of a guinea, and yields 30 bu&s;hels of corn, at four pence &s;terling per bu&s;hel, is dearer than land of the &s;ame quality in Penn&s;ylvania, at a guinea per acre, that yields the &s;ame quantity of corn, which can be &s;old at the neare&s;t mill or &s;tore for two &s;hillings &s;terl. per bu&s;hel. To cure this pa&s;&s;ion for mi|grating to the waters of the Ohio, there is but one remedy, and that is, to open the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. This, by rai&s;ing the price of produce, will rai&s;e the value of land &s;o high, as to de&s;troy the balance of attraction to that country. This truth is at pre&s;ent a &s;peculative one; nor do I &s;uppo&s;e it will be reduced to practice, if nations continue to be what they have been, until the waters of the Ohio and Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi have been dyed with the blood of two or three hundred thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The &s;tates to the &s;outhward of Penn&s;ylvania po&s;&s;e&s;s immen&s;e re&s;ources for political happine&s;s: but while they tolerate negro &s;lavery, they can never be an agreeable retreat for an European. This objection applies chiefly to the &s;ea coa&s;ts of tho&s;e &s;tates; for in the we&s;tern parts of them, the land is cultivated chiefly by freemen. The &s;oil and climate of the exten&s;ive we&s;tern country of tho&s;e &s;tates is kind and mild to a very great degree. There Europeans may pro&s;per and be happy.</P>
<P>Thus, &s;ir, have I complied in a few words with your reque&s;t. In communicating many of the facts contained in this letter, I have not con&s;idered you &s;imply as a citizen of London, or a &s;ubject of the crown of Britain. The whole family of mankind, I know are your brethren: and if men be happy, I am &s;ure it is a mat|ter of indifference to you whether they enjoy their happine&s;s on this &s;ide or on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic ocean.</P>
<P>From a review of the facts that have been mentioned, you will perceive that the pre&s;ent is the age of rea&s;on and action in Ameri|ca. To our po&s;terity we mu&s;t bequeath the cultivation of the fine arts and the plea&s;ures of ta&s;te and &s;entiment. The foreigners who have vi&s;ited and de&s;cribed our country, without making allowan|ces for tho&s;e peculiarities which ari&s;e from our pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;oci|ety, have done as little honour to their under&s;tandings, as they have done to human nature. Nor have tho&s;e Europeans di&s;covered more wi&s;dom, who have blended with the American character, the accidental di&s;orders, which were the offspring of our late public commotions. They re&s;embled the &s;welling of the &s;ea, which &s;ucceeds a &s;torm. At pre&s;ent, they have as perfectly &s;ub&s;i|ded as the di&s;orders produced by the civil wars in England, in the la&s;t century.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="022390_0014_0FB86DFE9B5803E8">
It is &s;omewhat remarkable that in every age, great inven|tions and great revolutions in human affairs have taken place in a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to each other. The many curious machines for le&s;&s;ening labour, which have lately been di&s;covered in Europe, will nece&s;&s;arily throw many thou&s;and artificers out of employ|ment. Perhaps the late &s;ucce&s;sful application of the powers of fire and water to mechanical purpo&s;es in your country, was delayed until the pre&s;ent time, only that the &s;anctuary of our na|tional government might be perfectly prepared to receive and protect tho&s;e indu&s;trious bodies of people, who formerly lived by the labour of their hands, and who might otherwi&s;e become a burden to the countries in which they had been deprived of the means of &s;upporting them&s;elves. Perhaps, too, the revolutions, which are now going forward in &s;everal of the governments on the continent of Europe, have occurred at the pre&s;ent juncture for a purpo&s;e equally wi&s;e and benevolent. The fir&s;t effect of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of freedom in tho&s;e countries, will be to pro|mote population, by reducing taxes, di&s;banding &s;tanding armies, and aboli&s;hing the vows and practices of celibacy: for I take it for granted that military in&s;titutions in the time of peace, and mona&s;taries of all kinds, mu&s;t yield to the pre&s;ent force and cultivated &s;tate of human rea&s;on, in tho&s;e countries, which are now the theatres of revolutions in favour of liberty. This increa&s;e of population will require an increa&s;e of territory, which mu&s;t be &s;ought for in the united &s;tates: for it is not probable that men who have once ta&s;ted of the &s;weets of liberty, will ever think of tran&s;porting them&s;elves to any other country. This outlet for &s;upernumerary inhabitants from the nations of Europe, will eventually promote their intere&s;ts and pro&s;perity: for when a country is &s;o much crouded with people, that the price of the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence is beyond the ratio of their indu&s;try, mar|riages are re&s;trained: but when emigration to a certain degree takes place, the balance between the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and indu&s;try is re&s;tored, and population thereby revived. Of the truth of this principle there are many proofs in the old coun|ties of all the American &s;tates. Population has con&s;tantly been advanced in them by the migration of their inhabitants to new or di&s;tant &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all the little &s;y&s;tems of narrow politicians, it is an eternal truth, that univer&s;al happine&s;s is univer&s;al intere&s;t. The divine government of our world would admit of a controver&s;y,

<P>I &s;hall conclude this long letter by the two following re|marks:</P>
<P>I. If freedom, joined with the facility of acquiring the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, have &s;uch an influence upon population&mdash;and if exi&s;tence be a title to happine&s;s&mdash;then think, &s;ir, what an ocean of additional happine&s;s will be created, by the influence which migration to the free and exten&s;ive territories of the united &s;tates will have, upon the numbers of mankind.</P>
<P>II. If wars have been promoted in all ages and countries, by an over proportion of inhabitants to the means of ea&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, then think, &s;ir, what an influence upon the means of &s;up|porting human life, migration to America, and the immen&s;e in|crea&s;e of the productions of the earth, by the late improve|ments in agriculture, will probably have, in le&s;&s;ening the temp|tations and re&s;ources of nations to carry on war. The pro|mi&s;es of heaven are often accompli&s;hed by means in which there is no departure from the common operations of nature. If the events, which have been alluded to, &s;hould contribute in any degree to put an end o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> wars, it will furni&s;h a noble triumph to your &s;ociety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>NOTE.</P><P>The gentleman to whom this letter is addre&s;&s;ed, is of the &s;ociety of the people called quakers.</P></NOTE>, by &s;hewing how much enlightened policy and national happine&s;s are connected with the dictates of chri&s;tianity.</P>
