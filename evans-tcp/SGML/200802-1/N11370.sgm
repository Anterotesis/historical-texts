<P>_THE pulpit is devoted to more important purpo&s;es, than the fate of kingdoms, e|ven the in&s;truction of mankind in the way to everla&s;ting life. But, when ne|ce&s;&s;ity calls, it may with propriety, ad|dre&s;s us on civil liberty; and at once in&s;truct and warm tho&s;e who are willing to hazard their lives, in the defence of the privileges of their country. On this affecting occa&s;ion, when &s;ome pre&s;ent, &s;oon expect to go into the &s;ervice of the colonies, on who&s;e account we are now a&s;&s;embled in the hou&s;e of God, your &s;o|lemn attention is earne&s;tly &s;olicited to the pa&s;&s;age of holy writ, ju&s;t read.</P>
<P>THE text, taken as a detached pa&s;&s;age without a critical regard to its circum&s;tances and connection, may be divided into three branches, each of which will be a di&s;tinct topic of di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<P>To paint the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our native land in colours &s;ufficiently bright, is a ta&s;k to which I own my&s;elf unequal. However, a few words on this &s;ubject, will be pertinent, and not unentertaining to you. Our forefathers purcha&s;ed our invaluable liberties at the expence of their blood and trea&s;ure. To enjoy their religion, their God, and their con&s;ciences, and to tran&s;mit an unembarra&s;&s;ed wor&s;hip, untaxed inheri|tance and fair freedom, with her happy train of nu|merous ble&s;&s;ings, down to future generations; they left their plea&s;ant, native &s;oil, the other &s;ide of the atlantic, relinqui&s;hed friends and near connexions, braved all hard&s;hips and de&s;pi&s;ed all dangers. At the expence of their blood, at the hazard of their fortunes, without the lea&s;t charge to the country from whence they came, by unwearied endeavours and an intrepid &s;pirit, they effected &s;ettlements in the di&s;tant and inho&s;pitable wilds of <HI>America,</HI> then filled with &s;avage barbarians. Propitious heaven &s;miled on their arduous attempts, and crowned their bold enterpri&s;es with unexpected &s;ucce&s;s. How &s;oon did this country after their &s;ettle|ment in it, change its appearance! the huts of &s;avages were converted into the dwellings of chri&s;tians. That dark, blind ignorance, which &s;at brooding over the minds of the aborigines was gradually cha&s;ed away. Now fair &s;cience dawns, and the arts of life are culti|vated diligently and are brought to a tolerable perfec|tion. Where &s;atan was once wor&s;hipped, now the true God is &s;erved. Where &s;uper&s;tition once raged, now the pure&s;t form of wor&s;hip on the face of the earth is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the &s;acred rights of con&s;cience main|tained. In a word, the glorious light of chri&s;tianity has di&s;pelled the dark glooms of pagani&s;m. And as <HI>America</HI> was &s;ought as an a&s;ylum for civil as well as religious freedom, &s;o governments, ve&s;ted with perfect legi&s;latures were erected by <HI>royal leave,</HI> and a friendly
<PB N="5" REF="014382_0005_0F92625CCEECA208">
corre&s;pondence e&s;tabli&s;hed between the colonies and the kingdom from whence they derived their origin. The mutual advantages of this union were great be|yond expectation. From this &s;ource the exceeding increa&s;e of the wealth and fame, &s;trength and naviga|tion of the realm aro&s;e. <HI>America</HI> was peculiarly hap|py under the &s;hadow of the wings, and in the enjoy|ment of the friend&s;hip of <HI>Britain.</HI> Indeed no people more happy, more free, more virtuous could be found where'er the circling &s;un performs its de&s;tined cour&s;e. But alas, &s;hort is the date of human felicity! forgetful of the ties of blood, hardened again&s;t the bonds of ob|ligation, and unfeeling to the &s;entiments of gratitude, the parent &s;tate envies the liberties, ri&s;ing glory, en|crea&s;ing greatne&s;s, and growing riches of the dutiful daughter. On the&s;e &s;he fixes her malignant eye. Over the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ion longs to &s;tretch her iron rod. Fair LIBERTY, offspring of virtue, trembles at the &s;ight of the hated mon&s;ter. De&s;poti&s;m a&s;&s;umes the &s;pecious name of government; would pu&s;h coercive mea&s;ures under the colourable pretence of wi&s;e commercial re|gulations, and calls ab&s;olute &s;ervitude, ju&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to parliament.</P>
<P>ABSURD as are the principles and notions on which the doctrine of arbitrary power is e&s;tabli&s;hed, there have been ever in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> found many to adopt it. The vulgar are liable at all times to be deceived; as they are now by the plau&s;ible argument u&s;ed with them to per&s;uade them, every &s;hilling rai&s;ed by taxes in A|merica will &s;o much lighten their burden; by which artifice the <HI>Premier</HI> has &s;ecured on his &s;ide the landed intere&s;t; and the nation has ever produced a number of bad citizens, who prone to be corrupted, have been the ready tools of wicked mini&s;ters, and the zealous parti&s;ans in a cau&s;e big with the ruin of the &s;tate. It is ju&s;tly remarked by an able writer,
<Q>that there may be a faction for the crown as well as again&s;t it, and con&s;piracies again&s;t freedom as well as again&s;t pre|rogative.</Q>

Whoever attempts to remove the limi|tations nece&s;&s;ary to render monarchy con&s;i&s;tent with liberty, are rebels in the wor&s;t &s;en&s;e, rebels to the laws of their country, the law of nature, the law of rea&s;on, and the law of God. Was the que&s;tion to be put, could there be &s;uch wretches? we &s;hould be ready to an&s;wer, it cannot be. But the Briti&s;h annals have a &s;hameful tale to tell, that &s;uch lovers of arbitrary power have ever exi&s;ted in the &s;tate from the earlie&s;t period of the con&s;titution. They have not only prevented the e&s;tabli&s;hing any regular &s;y&s;tem for &s;ecuring and improving the <HI>liberties</HI> of the &s;ubject and fixing the line of prerogative, but always lye in wait for every opportunity, which the imperfections of the con&s;titution may give them to de&s;troy tho&s;e rights which have been purcha&s;ed by the toil and blood of the mo&s;t exalted individuals who ever adorned humanity. Having carried their de&s;potic plan to enormous lengths, by the influence of bribery at <HI>home,</HI> &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the <HI>pre&s;ent King,</HI> they have taken large &s;trides, in the &s;ame plan, in <HI>America.</HI> Indeed, if we but for a moment look over our land, and glance a reflection on the cruel, unju&s;t, and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures of the mini&s;try at <HI>home,</HI> we &s;hall be &s;truck with horror at the mi&s;chiefs imagined again&s;t us. The &s;um of them all is in the &s;tatute, which declares parliament can of right, make laws to bind us in all ca&s;es whatever. Did ever more arbitrary &s;tatute di&s;grace the annals of the Briti&s;h nation, even in the mo&s;t arbitrary reigns?&mdash; They have undertaken to give and grant our money without our con&s;ent&mdash;they &s;hew no regard for our per|&s;ons or rights.&mdash; But why do I &s;tand to enumerate par|ticulars? No conquered province was ever dealt more hardly by.&mdash;Our precious liberties are invaded&mdash;Our &s;acred charters violated&mdash;Our property taken from us &mdash;foreign troops, the bane of government, quartered among us in times of profound peace.&mdash;The cruel &s;u|per&s;tition of popery e&s;tabli&s;hed, proti&s;tani&s;m only to|lerated,
<PB N="7" REF="014382_0007_0F926262A8B19270">
and a de&s;poti&s;m dangerous to the la&s;t degree to us, erected in a large neighbouring province. Gra|cious God! what mi&s;chiefs are imagined again&s;t us! Never, never did &s;o dark, &s;o gloomy, &s;o alarming, &s;o terrible calamities hang over <HI>America</HI> as the pre&s;ent. Who that is zealous in the cau&s;e of liberty, and attach|ed with a fervent devotion to the civil rights of his country, but mu&s;t weep over her fate? Cruel as are the mi&s;chiefs imagined again&s;t us, fleets and armies are &s;ent over to enforce them.</P>
<P N="2">II. To make them take effect, or to bring us to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, war is begun. "Continually are they ga|thered together for war." Had man continued in a &s;tate of innocence, war had never been known. But now, alas the fatal effects of apo&s;tacy, in every age of the world, and among all nations killing one another hath been taught and practiced by mankind, as a &s;ci|ence. In this &s;tate of &s;in and imperfection, war is ma|ny times, not only ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, but &s;trictly law|ful. It can only be lawful, either con&s;onant to the dic|tates of rea&s;on or permitted by the precepts of chri&s;|&s;tianity, when an inva&s;ion is made upon us. It is true, according to the peaceable maxims of policy in our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's kingdom, we are to love our enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e us, do good to them that hate us, and pray for them who de&s;pitefully u&s;e us. And ac|cording to the apo&s;tles doctrine are to be &s;ubject to the powers that be. From the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages to &s;upport arbitrary principles and to argue again&s;t the lawful|ne&s;s of oppo&s;ing force by force, would be to draw ab|&s;urd and dangerous conclu&s;ions, from the gentle and conde&s;cending laws of the religion of Je&s;us. To draw the &s;word and &s;hed human blood for the &s;ake of conque&s;t, mu&s;t, in the judgment of rea&s;on, be deemed a horrid crime. An offen&s;ive war can therefore never be either nece&s;&s;ary or ju&s;tifiable. To enlarge empire, feed vain glory, exalt pride, reward favourites, &s;upport luxury, and gratify pe&s;tilential ambition, mu&s;t be
<PB N="8" REF="014382_0008_0F926262DBEB4720">
wretched motives in a Prince to engage in a war. And all the blood &s;hed, horrors felt, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es endured, mu&s;t be laid at the doors of the aggre&s;&s;ors. The wretch|es who compo&s;e the army of a tyrant, are a&s;&s;ociated by folly in the &s;ervice of rapine and murder; and that men &s;hould imagine they were de&s;erving of honour by the ma&s;&s;acre of their fellow creatures or fellow &s;ub|jects merely to flatter ambition with a new tittle or to enforce oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, is, perhaps as in&s;crutable a my&s;tery as any that has perplexed rea&s;on, and as gro&s;s an ab&s;urdity as any that has di&s;graced it. It is equally to puni&s;h vice and prevent mi&s;ery, that I wi&s;h always to &s;ee it branded with infamy: For even the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of vice terminate in the angui&s;h of di&s;appointment. As to Alexander, the fruit of all his conque&s;ts was tears, &s;o I wi&s;h not only the tears of di&s;appointment, but the tears of repentance to tho&s;e who want to have <HI>A|merica</HI> &s;acrificed to the lu&s;t of domination. A va&s;t va|riety of weighty and invincible arguments might ea&s;i|ly be produced to prove the iniquity of an offen&s;ive war, for the &s;ake of the acqui&s;ition of honor or additi|on of territory. But to plunder under &s;anction of law, to &s;trip a people of the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, to rai&s;e a re|venue out of the fruits of their hone&s;t indu&s;try, to involve in di&s;tre&s;s, and to reduce them to the hard nece&s;&s;ity of either giving up their liberty, or of appealing to arms is a crime of which words cannot de&s;cribe the blackne&s;s, and which mu&s;t fill us with painful &s;entiments to think humanity is depraved enough to commit. How nearly this is the ca&s;e with us and <HI>Great Britain</HI> is too plain not to be &s;een by all. We have rea&s;oned&mdash;we have remon&s;trated&mdash;we have prayed&mdash;we have even weari|ed the <HI>royal ear</HI> with our cries&mdash;we have per&s;ued every re&s;pectful, every gentle mea&s;ure.&mdash; But all in vain. We mu&s;t be &s;courged into va&s;&s;alage like &s;laves. We have been dragged reluctantly into an unnatural civil war.&mdash; Ho&s;tilities are commenced, and the <HI>kings troops,</HI> the in&s;truments of tyranny, were the aggre&s;&s;ors. Wit|ne&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="014382_0009_0F92626331894640">
the battle at Lexington, &s;hameful in every view, to the Briti&s;h arms! We are reduced to the &s;ad, depre|cated nece&s;&s;ity of defending our rights at the point of the &s;word. We mu&s;t either re&s;i&s;t unto blood or be &s;laves. No other alternative is left us. As our's is then a de|fen&s;ive, it mu&s;t be a righteous war. Should a ruffian meet me on the road, demand my pur&s;e with a dagger at my throat, or pi&s;tol at my brea&s;t, if by any means I could &s;trike him dead, I &s;hould think my&s;elf warranted to do it, by the laws of God and man.</P>
<P>WHEN therefore our money is demanded of us, by the <HI>gentle arguments</HI> of fleets and armies, or with the boyonet at our brea&s;ts, we are warranted by all laws human and divine, to defend our&s;elves by the harde&s;t, &amp; appeal to heaven for the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e. Tame|ly and unre&s;i&s;tingly to give up the liberties, with which God and nature have ble&s;&s;ed us, and which we hold dear as men, and &s;acred as chri&s;tians, mu&s;t be a crime in us. Nay, I may venture to affirm you have no more right to give up your life and liberties, than your neigh|bour has forcibly to take them from you. We may therefore with humble confidence in the mercies of the impartial judge and &s;upreme ruler of the univer&s;e, de|voutly commit our righteous cau&s;e to him, and fervent|ly implore his compa&s;&s;ionate interpo&s;ition for our de|liverance. For,</P>
<P N="3">III. DELIVERANCE is to be &s;ought from the Lord. When David prays, as he does in the text, it is not be|cau&s;e he was a coward; for he was as di&s;tingui&s;hed a warrior as eminent &s;aint. As he appeared in Zion, fervent in devotion, &s;o he proved him&s;elf undaunted in fortitude in the field of battle. His fear of the om|nipotent God, was the be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t an unbe|comeing fear of man. While therefore he complains of the inju&s;tice of his enemies, he implores the merciful interpo&s;ition of heaven for deliverance and is concern|ed to engage the pre&s;ence of the God of battles with him.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014382_0010_0F926263F985CCB0">SEEKING deliverance from the Lord implies a feel|ing &s;en&s;e of our ab&s;olute dependance on&mdash;conviction of the almighty power of&mdash;continued application by prayer to the mercy of God, and repentance of &s;in. To &s;eek deliverance from, is to feel our dependance on God. Mankind are naturally filled with pride and &s;elf-dependance; unwilling to own their &s;ubjec|tion to the di&s;po&s;al of him, who is their Lord and Maker. But the truth is, both as individuals and as a people we are entirely dependant for life, and breath, and being, and all things, upon, and ab&s;olutely at the di&s;po&s;al of a &s;overeign God. Whether we realize it or not, it is true, God could with infinite ea&s;e cut us down and &s;end us to endle&s;s mi&s;ery. It is therefore of great moment to have our minds deeply and &s;eriou&s;|ly impre&s;&s;ed with an habitual conviction of our con|&s;tant dependance on God the great creator and moral governor and &s;upreme law-giver of the univer&s;e, from whom alone we may hope for deliverance, and who ju&s;tly claims from all rational creatures, the highe&s;t e&s;teem, mo&s;t ardent love, and unremitted obedience.</P>
<P>FURTHER, we mu&s;t be convinced <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the almighty power of God, in order to &s;eek acceptably deliverance. The &s;upreme being chu&s;es to have his people acknow|lege his power. When God interpo&s;es in behalf of any, he will have his arm made bare in &s;uch a manner as to convince all it is his, both tho&s;e for whom, and tho&s;e again&s;t whom it is made bare. We mu&s;t then realize his almighty power; believe and re&s;t a&s;&s;ured he can do every thing; that nothing is too hard for omnipotence; that as he made, &s;o he governs the world with unering rectitude; that he can ride forth conquering and to conquer for his people; can &s;trike dead all that oppo&s;e his people, and work deliverance for them by unthought of means; he can turn their adver|&s;ity into pro&s;perity, their affliction into joy, their trou|bles into ble&s;&s;ings, and cut of darkne&s;s bring forth light.</P>
<P>Again, WE mu&s;t continually apply to his mercy
<PB N="11" REF="014382_0011_0F926264B1A82880">
by prayer. God hath in gracious conde&s;cention &s;tyled him&s;elf a prayer hearing God. He permits &s;uch worms of the du&s;t as we are, to approach his &s;acred pre&s;ence; to &s;pread our reque&s;ts before and make known our wants to him through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by who&s;e atone|ment alone our &s;ins can be pardoned &amp; our cries heard. Now the word of God abounds with proofs of the Al|mighty's plea&s;ure to make his power, as it were, tribu|tary to the prayers of his faithful people. Thus the prayer of Jo&s;hua &s;topped the &s;un in his cour&s;e; and that of Elijah, though a man of like pa&s;&s;ions with our|&s;elves opened and &s;hut the &s;prings which water the earth. The prayer of the three children pre&s;erved them in the fiery furnace from being hurt, and that of Daniel from the devouring lions. The time would fail me to mention what we find recorded in &s;cripture of the wonders wrought through the powers of prayer. There is indeed no age without a cloud of witne&s;&s;es of the infaliable efficacy of prayer. Let us then begin, let us per&s;evere in calling upon the Lord for deliver|ance in this dark and alarming day. Real chri&s;tians mu&s;t value prayer, and be con&s;tant and unwearied in it; &s;o will the &s;ame bountiful God, who&s;e ears are e|ver open to the prayers of his faithful people, open in the end, heaven to receive their per&s;ons. He will give them an abundant entrance into that kingdom, where petitions are no more; becau&s;e neither weakne&s;s, nor want, nor fear, nor trial, remain, but all the &s;oul feels is perfect felicity, and all it expre&s;&s;es, perfect prai&s;e.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, WE mu&s;t repent of &s;in, or we do not &s;eek a right for deliverance from the Lord. In true repen|tance, &s;in it&s;elf becomes the greate&s;t burden and object of aver&s;ion; &s;orrow &s;prings from an affecting hum|bling &s;en&s;e of the di&s;honor and injury the penitent feels he has done unto God; not from a &s;elfi&s;h concern for his own &s;afety, but from a regard to God, to which he was before a &s;tranger; from a conviction that his whole
<PB N="12" REF="014382_0012_0F9262659072DC78">
deportment and the ruling tempers of his heart at all times have been evil &amp; de&s;perately wicked. Now the ge|nerality among us &s;eem to be concerned for our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed country, and are ardently de&s;irous to contribute &s;ome|thing to &s;ave it from ruin. They are willing to &s;acri|fice much to the cau&s;e of freedom. But there is one kind of &s;acrifice by which you could do more e&s;|&s;ential &s;ervice to your country, than to give all your goods to feed its &s;uffering poor. A &s;acrifice, in one view, of the cheape&s;t kind. A &s;acrifice which will co&s;t you nothing. Do you a&s;k what it can be? It is the &s;acri|fice of your &s;ins to the cau&s;e of liberty. If you would give up your &s;ins, &s;lay them, and, &s;o to &s;peak, offer them on the altar of liberty as bleeding victims; it will be the be&s;t thing you can do for your country, for liberty, and for your&s;elves.</P>
<P>A &s;hort improvement will clo&s;e the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, from what hath been &s;aid, we &s;ee the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e.&mdash;The ob&s;tinacy and cruelty of our foes have obliged us to appeal from rea&s;on to arms. There is no choice left us but &s;lavery or civil war. England, who&s;e con&s;titution hath been the glo|ry, admiration, and envy of &s;urrounding &s;tates&mdash;Eng|land as famous for arts as for arms&mdash;England, which hath &s;hed the blood of her be&s;t citizens in the glorious cau&s;e of liberty, hath now &s;at down her&s;elf to forge the arbitrary chains. The laws of rea&s;on and &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation will ju&s;tify the mo&s;t &s;trenuous oppo&s;ition, nay duty calls on us to buckle on the harne&s;s &amp; march out into the field and if we mu&s;t give up our liberties, give them up at the point of the &s;word.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, we may with humble confidence implore the merciful interpo&s;ition of Almighty God for our deliverance. All who have an intere&s;t in hea|ven are loudly called upon, to be&s;iege the throne of grace, as con&s;tant and devout &s;upplicants. Every ar|gument that can operate on the human heart, urges to this duty. A fervent attachment to the civil rights

Let us therefore devoutly recommend our bleeding country's righteous cau&s;e, to the pitying eye of a compa&s;&s;ionate God, through a divine Saviour, and piou&s;ly crave his ble&s;&s;ing on our rulers, on the mea&s;ures that may be adopted, for &s;ucce&s;s to our arms, and the divine pre&s;ence to be with tho&s;e, that are going from among us, in this place, into the &s;ervice of the colonies, an addre&s;s to whom will wind up the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>MY FRIENDS,</P>
<P>IT is at your de&s;ire I now addre&s;s you from this &s;a|cred de&s;k; you will therefore allow me to u&s;e the utmo&s;t freedom, and to give you my parting advice with the greate&s;t plaine&s;s. It will be comprehended in the fol|lowing particulars, which I wi&s;h you to remember &amp; by which I wi&s;h you to act.&mdash;Be courageous&mdash;be or|derly&mdash;be &s;ober, and fear the Lord.</P>
<P>Be courageous. Cowardice is as un&s;eemly in a &s;ol|dier, as ignorance is in a &s;tate&s;man As the &s;kill of a pilot in a &s;torm, and the worth of a chri&s;tian in a time of trial, &s;o the valour of a &s;oldier is be&s;t &s;een in a day of battle. You know not how you will feel when called into an engagement, to give back then will brand you with the odious name of a coward. The mo&s;t of you are &s;trangers to the dreadful horrors of battle. An army drawn up in battle array, the roar|ing of cannon, the &s;moke and confu&s;ion, the cries of the wounded, groans of the dying, and all the dreadful horrors of battle are things to which you have not been accu&s;tomed. He is the brave &s;oldier who at &s;uch an awful juncture, has entire &s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and pre|&s;ence of mind. You have every thing to in&s;pire you with undaunted fortitude. You fight not for your daily bread&mdash;not for four-pence &s;terling a day, but for your lives, your property, your native land, your dear|e&s;t friends, your ju&s;t rights, all you hold dear as men and &s;acred as chri&s;tians, your ALL. If the&s;e motives do
<PB N="14" REF="014382_0014_0F92626703B1E858">
not fire your &s;ouls in your country's cau&s;e, what can! Indeed you have every thing before you to rou&s;e up the &s;oldier, warm the man and animate the chri&s;tian. Play the men therefore for your God, your people, and the cities of your God.</P>
<P>BE orderly. Nothing is more beautiful in a &s;oldier than the mo&s;t exact attention, &s;crupulous regard and punctual obedience to order. Orderly troops are in|finitely more likely to gain honor to them&s;elves, victo|ry to their arms, and triumph for their country, than a confu&s;ed rabble. If, in the day of battle, you do not obey &s;trictly orders and keep in ranks, defeat will mo&s;t certainly en&s;ue. Well diciplined and orderly forces, hi&s;tory abundantly evinces, carry the greate&s;t terror with them, and are generally &s;ucce&s;sful. I mu&s;t therefore enjoin upon you, the mo&s;t punctual attention to orders.</P>
<P>BE &s;ober. Temperance and &s;obriety are fine orna|ments to the &s;oldier who&s;e life expo&s;es him to number|le&s;s dangers, throws him in the mid&s;t of temptation and hardens him in the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in. No two profe&s;&s;ions &s;o full of danger, as the &s;ailor and &s;oldier, and none &s;o loo&s;e and wicked. Extravagant mirth, vain levity and univer&s;al forgetfulne&s;s of decency of deportment will &s;it with a very ill grace on tho&s;e, who pretend to &s;acrifice life to the cau&s;e of freedom and their country. As I would not have you lay a&s;ide the man, when you a&s;&s;ume the &s;oldier, &s;o I would not have you forget the duties of religion in the noi&s;e of a camp. Let compa&s;&s;ion, tenderne&s;s, kindne&s;s and benevolence to all, be your companions. Do not imagine you may put on the unfeeling fiercene&s;s of a barbarian, and di|ve&s;t your&s;elves of humanity. Wherever you may be po&s;ted, and in all your marches remember the &s;abbath day to keep it holy. Remember all the duties of de|votion &amp; &s;ink not down into &s;tupid neglect or thought|le&s;s contempt of them. Let it appear that the camp and religion, commonly great &s;trangers to each other,
<PB N="15" REF="014382_0015_0F926267B992E440">
are not incon&s;i&s;tent. With you, in&s;tead of profanity, let there be reverence of divine things; and in&s;tead of oaths and cur&s;es, the cries of prayer.</P>
<P>LASTLY. Fear the Lord. I do not mention this part of the advice, la&s;t in order, becau&s;e it is la&s;t in importance; for it is the one thing needful and of in|finite moment. He that fears God the mo&s;t, will be the lea&s;t likely to fear man; for the fear of God is the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ecurity again&s;t cowardice, and the good man will make the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t &s;oldier; and if you are never to return to your friends, the fear of the Lord will be a &s;ure pa&s;&s;-port to eternal honours. Life, you know, is very uncertain, you are going into dan|ger, and ought &s;olemnly to be reminded of a dying hour. Do not think then when you have on the har|ne&s;s of war, the in&s;truments of death, you are complete|ly equipped. There is another kind of armour of in|finite moment and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, the armour of righteou&s;ne&s;s. Take then, the girdle of truth&mdash;the brea&s;t-plate of righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;the &s;hield of faith&mdash;the helmet of &s;alvation&mdash;and the &s;word of the &s;pirit, and you will be completely armed, prepared to meet your fate, either to conquer, or die in battle.</P>
<P>To conclude. WE wi&s;h you the divine pre&s;ence&mdash;we wi&s;h you the divine ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;we wi&s;h you &s;ucce&s;s, may you be &s;ecured from temptation, pre&s;erved from &s;ick|ne&s;s, &s;hielded from danger, and &s;aved from death. But if we never &s;ee one another's faces again in the land of the living, may we all be &s;o happy as to meet in that world, where there will be no war, nor rumors of war, but where peace &s;erene &s;hall fill every brea&s;t, love divine glow in every heart, and ho&s;anna's exalted &s;ound from every tongue.</P>
