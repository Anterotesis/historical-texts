<OPENER><SALUTE>MR PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY your unanimous vote, to honour with an Eulogium, the di&s;tingui&s;hed charac|ter of the late DR. WILLIAM CULLEN, Profe&s;&s;or of Medicine in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, you have done equal homage to Science and Humanity. This illu&s;trious Phy|&s;ician was the Preceptor of many of us:&mdash;He was moreover a di&s;tingui&s;hed citizen of the republic of Medicine, and a benefactor to Mankind; and although, like the &s;un, he &s;hone in a di&s;tant hemi&s;phere, yet many of the rays of his knowledge have fallen up|on this quarter of the globe. I ri&s;e, there|fore, to mingle your grateful prai&s;es of him, with the numerous offerings of public and private re&s;pect which have been paid to his memory in his native country. Happy will be the effects of &s;uch acts of di&s;tant &s;ympa|thy,
<PB N="4" REF="022862_0004_0FBA9C005C67E190">
if they &s;hould &s;erve to unite the influ|ence of &s;cience with that of commerce, to le&s;&s;en the prejudices of nations again&s;t each other, and thereby to prepare the way for the operation of that divine &s;y&s;tem of morals, who&s;e prerogative alone it is, to teach man|kind that they are brethren, and to make the name of a fellow-creature, in every regi|on of the world, a &s;ignal for brotherly af|fection.</P>
<P>IN executing the ta&s;k you have impo&s;ed upon me, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to &s;uch parts of Dr. Cullen's character as came within the compa&s;s of my own knowledge, during two years re&s;idence in Edinburgh.&mdash;To his fellow citizens in Great Britain, who were more intimately acquainted with him, we mu&s;t re&s;ign the hi&s;tory of his do|me&s;tic character, as well as the detail of all tho&s;e &s;teps which, in early life, led him to his unparalleled height of u&s;efulne&s;s and fame.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great and origi|nal genius. By genius, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, I mean a power in the human mind of di&s;|covering the relation of di&s;tant truths, by the &s;horte&s;t train of intermediate propo&s;itions. This precious gift of Heaven, is compo&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="022862_0005_0FBA9C01D9A2D5F0">
of a vigorous imagination, quick &s;en&s;ibility, a talent for exten&s;ive and accurate ob&s;erva|tion, a faithful memory, and a &s;ound judg|ment. The&s;e faculties were all united in an eminent degree in the mind of Dr. Cul|len. His imagination &s;urveyed all nature at a glance, and, like a camera ob&s;cura, &s;eem|ed to produce in his mind a picture of the whole vi&s;ible creation. His &s;en&s;ibility was &s;o exqui&s;ite, that the &s;malle&s;t portions of truth acted upon it. By means of his talent for ob&s;ervation he collected knowledge from exery thing he heard, &s;aw, or read, and from every per&s;on with whom he conver&s;ed. His memory was the faithful repo&s;itory of all his ideas, and appeared to be alike accu|rate upon all &s;ubjects. Over each of the&s;e faculties of his mind a &s;ound judgment pre|&s;ided, by means of which he di&s;covered the relation of ideas to each other, and there|by produced tho&s;e new combinations which con&s;titute principles in &s;cience. This pro|ce&s;s of the mind has been called invention, and is totally different from a mere capacity of acquiring learning, or collecting know|ledge from the di&s;coveries of others. It e|levates man to a di&s;tant re&s;emblance of his Maker; for the di&s;covery of truth, is the
<PB N="6" REF="022862_0006_0FBA9C0382236CA0">
perception of things as they appear to the Divine Mind.</P>
<P>IN contemplating the human faculties, thus exqui&s;itely formed, and exactly balan|ced, we feel the &s;ame kind of plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from a view of a magnificent palace, or an exten&s;ive and variegated pro&s;|pect; but with this difference, that the plea|&s;ure, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, is as much &s;uperi|or to that which ari&s;es from contemplating the latter objects, as the mind of man is &s;uperior, in its importance, to the mo&s;t fi|ni&s;hed productions of nature or of art.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not only the ge|nius that has been de&s;cribed, but an un|common &s;hare of learning, reading, and knowledge.</P>
<P>HIS learning was of a peculiar and u&s;eful kind&mdash;He appeared to have over&s;tepped the &s;low and tedious forms of the &s;chools, and, by the force of his under&s;tanding, to have &s;eized upon the great ends of learning, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of many of tho&s;e means which were contrived for the u&s;e of le&s;s active minds. He read the ancient Greek and Roman wri|ters only for the &s;ake of the knowledge which they contained, without wa&s;ting any of the efforts of his genius in attempting to imitate
<PB N="7" REF="022862_0007_0FBA9C080626D828">
their &s;tyle. He was intimately acquainted with modern languages, and through their means, with the improvements of medicine in every country in Europe. Such was the facility with which he acquired a language, and &s;o great was his enterpri&s;e in his re|&s;earches in medicine, that I once heard him &s;peak of learning the Arabic, for the &s;ake of reading Avicenna in the original; as if it were a matter of as little difficulty to him, as it was to compo&s;e a lecture, or to vi&s;it a patient.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN'S reading was exten&s;ive, but it was not confined wholly to medicine. He read books upon all &s;ubjects; and he had a peculiar art of extracting &s;omething from all of them which he made &s;ub&s;ervient to his profe&s;&s;ion. He was well acquainted with ancient and modern hi&s;tory, and delighted in the poets, among whom Shake&s;peare was his favourite. The hi&s;tory of our globe, as unfolded by books of geography and travels, was &s;o familiar to him, that a &s;tranger could not conver&s;e with him, without &s;uppo&s;ing that he had not only travelled, but that he had lived every where. His memory had no rubbi&s;h in it. Like a &s;ecretory organ, in the animal body, it rejected every thing in
<PB N="8" REF="022862_0008_0FBA9C0A18F47938">
reading, that could not be applied to &s;ome u&s;eful purpo&s;e. In this he has given the world a mo&s;t valuable le&s;&s;on, for the differ|ence between error and u&s;ele&s;s truth is very &s;mall; and a man is no wi&s;er for knowledge which he cannot apply, than he is rich from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing wealth, which he cannot &s;pend.</P>
<P>DR. CULLEN'S knowledge was minute in every branch of medicine. He was an ac|curate anatomi&s;t, and an ingenious phy&s;iolo|gi&s;t. He enlarged the boundaries, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the utility of Chemi&s;try, and thereby prepared the way for the di&s;coveries and &s;ame of his illu&s;trious pupil Dr. Black. He &s;trip|ped Materia Medica, of mo&s;t of the errors that had been accumulating in it for two thou&s;and years, and reduced it to a &s;imple and practical &s;cience. He was intimately acquainted with all the branches of natural hi&s;tory and phi|lo&s;ophy. He had &s;tudied every ancient and modern &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;ic. He found the &s;y&s;|tem of Dr. Boerhaave univer&s;ally adopted when he accepted a chair in the Univer&s;ity of Edinburgh. This &s;y&s;tem was founded chief|ly on the &s;uppo&s;ed pre&s;ence of certain acrid particles in the fluids, and in the departure of the&s;e, in point of con&s;i&s;tency, from a natu|ral &s;tate. Dr. Cullen's fir&s;t object was to ex|po&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="022862_0009_0FBA9C0B957DB580">
the errors of this pathology; and to teach his pupils to &s;eek for the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es in the &s;olids. Nature is always coy. Ever &s;ince &s;he was driven from the heart, by the di&s;covery of the circulation of the blood, &s;he has concealed her&s;elf in the brain and nerves. Here &s;he has been pur&s;ued by Dr Cullen; and if he has not dragged her to public view, he has left us a clue which mu&s;t in time conduct us to her la&s;t rece&s;s in the human body. Many, however, of the operations of nature in the nervous &s;y&s;tem have been explained by him; and no candid man will ever explain the whole of them, without acknowledging that the foundation of his &s;ucce&s;sful inquiries was laid by the di&s;coveries of Dr Cullen.</P>
<P>HE was intimately acquainted with the hi&s;tories and di&s;tinctions of the di&s;ea&s;es of all countries, ages, &s;tations, occupations, and &s;tates of &s;ociety. While his great object was to explode u&s;ele&s;s remedies, he took pains to increa&s;e the influence of diet, dre&s;s, air, exerci&s;e, and the actions of the mind, in medicine. In a word, he was a great practical phy&s;ician; and he has left behind him as many monuments of his &s;ucce&s;s in
<PB N="10" REF="022862_0010_0FBA9C0DB7BC2488">
curing di&s;ea&s;es, as he has of accuracy and ingenuity in de&s;cribing their &s;ymptoms and explaining their cau&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT his knowledge was not confined wholly to tho&s;e &s;ciences which are intimately connected with medicine. His genius was univer&s;al, as to natural and artificial &s;ubjects. He was minutely acquainted with the prin|ciples and practices of all the liberal, me|chanical, and chemical arts; and trade&s;men were often directed by him to new objects of ob&s;ervation and improvement in their re&s;pective occupations. He delighted in the &s;tudy of agriculture, and contributed much to excite that ta&s;te for agricultural &s;cience, which has of late years &s;o much di&s;|tingui&s;hed the men of genius and lei&s;ure in North-Britain. I have been informed, that he yielded at la&s;t to that pa&s;&s;ion for rural improvements, which is common to all men, and amu&s;ed him&s;elf in the evening of his life by cultivating a farm in the neigh|bourhood of Edinburgh. Happy would it be for the intere&s;ts of agriculture, if phy&s;i|cians in all countries, would imitate Dr. Cullen by an attachment to this noble &s;ci|ence; for their previous &s;tudies are of &s;uch, a nature as frequently to enable them to ar|rive
<PB N="11" REF="022862_0011_0FBA9C0F51816E18">
at improvements in it without experi|ments, and to apply the experiments of o|thers, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and pofitable manner.</P>
<P>DR CULLEN'S publications were few in number compared with his di&s;coveries. They con&s;i&s;t of his Elements of phy&s;iology, his No&s;ologia Methodica, his Fir&s;t Lines of the Practice of Phy&s;ic, an E&s;&s;ay upon the cold produced by Evaporation, publi&s;hed in the &s;econd volume of the Phy&s;ical and Literary E&s;&s;ays of Edinburgh, a Letter to Lord Cath|cart upon the method of recovering per&s;ons &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead from drowning, and a &s;y&s;tem of the Materia Medica. The&s;e are all the works which bear his name; but the fruits of his inquiries are to be found in mo&s;t of the medical publications that have appeared in Great Britain within the la&s;t thirty years. Many of the the&s;es, publi&s;hed in Edinburgh during his life, were the vehicles of his opi|nions or practice in medicine; and few of them contained an important or u&s;eful di&s;co|very, which was not derived from hints thrown out in his lectures.</P>
<P>As a TEACHER of medicine, Dr. Cullen po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many peculiar talents. He min|gled the mo&s;t agreeable eloquence with the
<PB N="12" REF="022862_0012_0FBA9C1444CA5568">
mo&s;t profound di&s;qui&s;itions. He appeared to <HI>lighten</HI> upon every &s;ubject upon which he &s;poke. His language was &s;imple, and his arrangement methodical, by which means he was always intelligible. From the mo|ment he a&s;cended his chair, he commanded the mo&s;t re&s;pectful attention from his pu|pils; in&s;omuch that I never &s;aw one of them di&s;cover a &s;ign of impatience during the time of any of his lectures.</P>
<P>IN the inve&s;tigation of truth, he &s;ometimes ventured into the regions of conjecture. His imagination was a hot-bed of hypothe&s;es, which led him to con&s;tant ob&s;ervation and experiment. The&s;e often proved the &s;eeds of &s;ub&s;equent di&s;coveries. It was thus Sir I&s;aac Newton founded an empire in &s;ci|ence; for mo&s;t of his di&s;coveries were the con&s;equence of preconceived hypothe&s;es. In delivering new opinions, Dr. Cullen pre|&s;erved the &s;tricte&s;t integrity. I have known him more than once, refute the opinions which he had taught the preceding year, even before the fallacy of them had been &s;u&s;pected by any of his pupils. Such in|&s;tances of candor often pa&s;s with the vulgar for in&s;tability; but they are the true&s;t cha|racteri&s;tics of a great mind. To be unchan|geable,
<PB N="13" REF="022862_0013_0FBA9C1550C8CC78">
&s;uppo&s;es perpetual error, or a per|ception of truth without the u&s;e of rea&s;on; but this &s;ublime act of intuition belongs on|ly to the Deity.</P>
<P>THERE was no tincture of credulity in the mind of Dr. Cullen. He taught his pupils the nece&s;&s;ity of acquiring "the &s;low con&s;enting academic doubt." I mention the&s;e words of the poet with peculiar plea|&s;ure, as I find them in my notes of one of his lectures, in which he has delivered rules for judging of the truth of things related as facts; for he frequently remarked, that there were ten fal&s;e facts (if the expre&s;&s;ion can be allowed) to one fal&s;e opinion in medicine. His Materia Medica abounds with proofs of the truth of this part of his character. With how much caution does he admit the efficacy of medicines, as related in books, or as &s;ug|ge&s;ted by his own experience! Who could have expected to have found &s;o much mo|de&s;ty in the writings of a phy&s;ician in the 77th year of his age? But let it be remem|bered, that this phy&s;ician was Dr. Cul|len; and that he always preferred utility to novelty, and loved truth more than fame.</P>
<P>HE took great pains to deliver his pupils from the undue influence which antiquity
<PB N="14" REF="022862_0014_0FBA9C172DEEE940">
and great names are apt to have upon the human mind. He de&s;troyed the &s;uper&s;titi|ous veneration which had been paid for many ages to the names of Hippocrates, Ga|len, and other ancient authors, and in&s;pired his pupils with a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the writings of modern phy&s;icians. His con&s;tant aim was to produce in their minds a change from a pa&s;&s;ive to an active &s;tate; and to force upon them &s;uch habits of thinking, and ob&s;erva|tion, as &s;hould enable them to in&s;truct them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>As he admitted no truth without examin|ation, &s;o he &s;ubmitted to no cu&s;tom in pro|pagating it that was not rea&s;onable. He had a principal &s;hare in the merit of deliver|ing medicine from the fetters of the Latin, and introducing the Engli&s;h language, as the vehicle of public in&s;truction in the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh. Much of the &s;ucce&s;s of the revolution he effected in medicine, I believe, may be a&s;cribed to this circum&s;tance. Per|haps the many improvements which have lately been made in medicine, in the Briti&s;h dominions, may likewi&s;e be a&s;cribed to the pre&s;ent fa&s;hionable cu&s;tom of communicating medical knowledge in the Engli&s;h language. By this means, our &s;cience has excited the
<PB N="15" REF="022862_0015_0FBA9C18578A13C8">
notice and inquiries of ingenious and ob&s;erv|ing men in all profe&s;&s;ions, and thereby a kind of galaxy has been created in the hemi&s;phere of medicine. By a&s;&s;uming an Engli&s;h dre&s;s, it has moreover been prepared more ea&s;ily to a&s;&s;ociate with other &s;ciences; from each of which it has received a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport.</P>
<P>IN his intercour&s;e with his pupils Dr. Cullen was truly kind and affectionate. Ne|ver have I known a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a higher degree tho&s;e qualities which &s;eize up|on every affection of the heart. He knew the rare and happy arts, as circum&s;tances required, of being affable, without being &s;o|ciable; &s;ociable without being familiar; and familiar, without lo&s;ing a particle of re&s;pect. Such was the intere&s;t he took in the health, &s;tudies, and future e&s;tabli&s;hment of all his pupils, that each of them believed that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a pre-eminence in his friend&s;hip; while the equal diffu&s;ion of his kind offices proved that he was the common friend and father of them all. Sometimes he would lay a&s;ide the di&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">, without le&s;&s;ening the dignity of the profe&s;&s;or, and mix with his pupils at his table upon terms of the mo&s;t endearing equality. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions his &s;ocial affections &s;eemed to have an
<PB N="16" REF="022862_0016_0FBA9C1CD43A19C0">
influence upon his mind. Science, &s;enti|ment, and convivial humor, appeared for hours together to &s;trive which &s;hould pre|dominate in his conver&s;ation. I appeal to you, gentlemen, who have &s;hared in the plea|&s;ure which I have de&s;cribed, for the ju&s;tice of the picture which I have drawn of him at his ho&s;pitable table. You will recollect, with me, how agreeably he accommodated him&s;elf to our different capacities and tem|pers; how kindly he di&s;&s;ipated our youth|ful blu&s;hes, by inviting us to a&s;k him que&s;ti|ons; and how much he taught us, by his in|quiries, of the nature of the &s;oil, climate, products, and di&s;ea&s;es of even our own country.</P>
<P>FROM the hi&s;tory that has been given of Dr. Cullen, we &s;hall not be &s;urpri&s;ed at the reputation which he gave to the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, for upwards of thirty years. The city of Edinburgh during his life be|came the very atmo&s;phere of medicine. But let me not here be unju&s;t to the merits of his illu&s;trious colleagues. The names of Whytt, Rutherford, the Monroes, Black, the Gregories, Hope, and Home, will always be dear to the lovers of medical &s;cience. May every healing plant bloom upon the graves
<PB N="17" REF="022862_0017_0FBA9C1F6BFBFAB0">
of tho&s;e of them who are departed! and may tho&s;e who have &s;urvived him, together with their new a&s;&s;ociate, the learned and excel|lent Dr. Duncan, long continue to main|tain the honor, of that ju&s;tly celebrated &s;chool of medicine!</P>
<P>IT remains now that I add a &s;hort ac|count of Dr. Cullen's conduct as a phy&s;ician and a man.</P>
<P>IN his attendance upon his patients, he made their health his fir&s;t object, and there|by confirmed a line between the mechani|cal and liberal profe&s;&s;ions; for while wealth is pur&s;ued by the former, as the end of la|bour, it &s;hould be left by the latter to fol|low the more noble exertions of the mind. So gentle and &s;ympathizing was Dr. Cul|len's manner in a &s;ick room, that pain and di&s;tre&s;s &s;eemed to be &s;u&s;pended in his pre|&s;ence. Hope followed his foot&s;teps, and death appeared frequently to drop his com|mi&s;&s;ion in a combat with his &s;kill. He was compa&s;&s;ionate and charitable to the poor; and from his pupils, who con&s;ulted him in &s;ick|ne&s;s, he con&s;tantly refu&s;ed to receive any pe|cuniary &s;atisfaction for his &s;ervices.</P>
<P>IN his intercour&s;e with the world he ex|hibited the manners of a well-bred gentle|man.
<PB N="18" REF="022862_0018_0FBA9C2097838030">
He exerci&s;ed upon all occa&s;ions the agreeable art, in which true politene&s;s is &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t, of &s;peaking with civility, and li&s;t|ning with attention to to every body. His conver&s;ation was at all times animated, a|greeable, and in&s;tructing. Few per&s;ons went into his company without learning &s;omething; and even a common thought, by pa&s;&s;ing through his mind, received an impre&s;&s;ion, which made it ever afterwards worthy of being pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>HE was a &s;trict oeconomi&s;t of time. He &s;eldom went out of his hou&s;e in his carriage, or a &s;edan chair, without a book in his hand; and he once told me that he frequently em|ployed one of his &s;ons to read to him after he went to bed, that he might not lo&s;e that portion of time which pa&s;&s;es between lying down and falling a&s;leep.</P>
<P>HE was remarkably punctual to all his profe&s;&s;ional engagements. He appeared to con&s;ider time as a &s;pecies of property, which no man had a right to to take from another without his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>IT was by means of his oeconomy and punctuality in the u&s;e of time, that he accompli&s;hed &s;o much in his profe&s;&s;ion. I have read of &s;ome men who have &s;pent more
<PB N="19" REF="022862_0019_0FBA9C221DCBCEC0">
time in their clo&s;ets, and of others who have done more bu&s;ine&s;s; but I have never read, nor heard of a man, who mingled more &s;tu|dy and bu&s;ine&s;s together. He lived by rule, without &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to the &s;lavery of forms. He was always employed, but ne|ver in a hurry; and amid&s;t the numerous and complicated avocations of &s;tudy and bu&s;ine&s;s, he appeared to enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, as if company-keeping and conver&s;ation were the only bu&s;ine&s;s of his life.</P>
<P>I &s;hall mention but one more trait in the character of Dr. Cullen, and that is, that he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by no one &s;ingularity of behaviour from other men. It is true he &s;tood alone; but this &s;ingularity was occa&s;i|oned, not by his quitting the &s;ociety of his fellow-men by walking on their left, or right &s;ide, but by his walking before them. Ec|centricities in behaviour are the offspring of a lively fancy only, but order is in&s;eparably connected with real genius. The actions of the former may be compared to the crooked fla&s;h of di&s;tant lightning, while the latter re&s;embles in its movements the &s;teady revo|lutions of the heavenly bodies.</P>
<P>IN reviewing the character which has been given of Dr. Cullen, I am forced to make a &s;hort
<PB N="20" REF="022862_0020_0FBA9C239528B7B0">
digre&s;&s;ion, while I do homage to the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic by a &s;ingle remark. So great are the ble&s;&s;ings which mankind derive from it, that if every other argument failed to prove the admini&s;tration of a Providence in human affairs, the profe&s;&s;ion of medicine alone would be &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e. Who can think of the talents, virtues, and &s;ervices of Dr. Cullen, without believing that the Creator of the world delights in the happine&s;s of his creatures, and that his ten|der mercies are over all his works!</P>
<P>FOR the information of &s;uch of the mem|bers of our college as have not &s;een Dr. Cul|len, it may not be improper to add the fol|lowing de&s;cription of his per&s;on. He was tall, &s;lender, and had a &s;toop in his &s;houlders; his face was long; his under lip protruded a little beyond the upper; his no&s;e was large, and inclined to a point downwards; his eye, which was of a blue color, was pe|netrating but &s;oft; and over his whole face was diffu&s;ed an air of mildne&s;s and thought, which was &s;trongly characteri&s;tic of the con|&s;tant temper and operations of his mind.</P>
<P>IT plea&s;ed God to prolong his life to a good old age. He lived near 78 years. He lived to &s;hew the different nature of the &s;oul
<PB N="21" REF="022862_0021_0FBA9C2511BD36C8">
and body, by the increa&s;ing vigor of the for|mer, under the gradual decay of the latter. He lived to demon&s;trate how much the du|ration of all the faculties of the mind de|pends upon their con&s;tant exerci&s;e. He liv|ed to teach his brethren by his example, that the obligations to acquire and communicate knowledge, &s;hould cea&s;e only with health or life; and la&s;tly, he lived to reap the fruits of his labors in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive fame; for not only his pupils, and his works, had con|veyed his reputation; but canva&s;s, paper, and clay, had borne even the image of his per&s;on to every quarter of the globe.</P>
<P>THE public papers, as well as private letters, inform us, that he &s;urvived his u&s;efulne&s;s only a few months. He re&s;igned his profe&s;&s;or&s;hip in the autumn of 1789, on account of bodily weakne&s;s, and died in the month of January of the pre&s;ent year; a year fatal to the pride of man; for this year Franklin and Howard, as well as Cullen, have mingled with the du&s;t. During the interval between his re|&s;ignation and his death he received the mo&s;t affectionate marks of public and private re|&s;pect. The city of Edinburgh voted him their thanks, and pre&s;ented him with a piece of plate. This in&s;tance of public gratitude
<PB N="22" REF="022862_0022_0FBA9C2999B26E20">
de&s;erves our particular attention; as it is more common for cities to treat their eminent lite|rary characters with neglect during their lives, and centuries afterwards to contend for the honor of having given them birth. The different medical &s;ocieties of Edinburgh followed him to his chamber with addre&s;&s;es full of gratitude and affection. In mention|ing the&s;e facts, I am led to contemplate the venerable &s;ubject of our prai&s;es in a &s;itu|ation truly &s;olemn and intere&s;ting. How pregnant with in&s;truction is the death-bed of a phy&s;ician, who has &s;pent a long life in ex|ten&s;ive and &s;ucce&s;sful practice! If the &s;or|rows we have relieved are the &s;ure&s;t &s;upport in our own, how great mu&s;t have been the con&s;olation which Dr. Cullen derived, in his la&s;t hours, from a review of his active and u&s;eful life! How many fathers and mo|thers, hu&s;bands and wives, brothers and &s;i&s;|ters, who&s;e tears he had wiped away by a|verting the &s;troke of death from the objects of their affections, mu&s;t have pre&s;ented them|&s;elves to his imagination, and &s;oothed his &s;oul with grateful prayers for his eternal wel|fare! But the retro&s;pect of the &s;ervices he had rendered to his fellow-creatures, was not confined to the limits of his exten&s;ive bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="23" REF="022862_0023_0FBA9C2C96CAB780">
in the city of Edinburgh. While the illu&s;trious actions of mo&s;t men may be view|ed with a naked eye, the atchievments of Dr. Cullen, in the di&s;tant regions of humani|ty and &s;cience, can only be perceived by the help of a tele&s;cope. Let us apply this in|&s;trument to di&s;cover his exploits of benefi|cence in every quarter of the world. He had filled the capitals, and mo&s;t of the towns of Great-Britain and Ireland with eminent phy|&s;icians. Many of his pupils had arrived at the fir&s;t honors in their profe&s;&s;ion in the prin|cipal cities on the continent of Europe. Ma|ny of them had extended the ble&s;&s;ings of his improvements in the principles and practice of medicine, to every Briti&s;h &s;ettlement in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, and to every free &s;tate in America. But the &s;um of his u&s;efulne&s;s did not end here. He had taught the different profe&s;&s;ors in the College of Philadelphia, and in the Univer&s;ity of Penn&s;ylvania, the art of teaching others the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful methods of curing di&s;ea&s;es, and thereby he had con|veyed the benefits of his di&s;coveries into every part of the United States. How great was the ma&s;s of &s;uch accumulated beneficence! and how &s;ublime mu&s;t have been the plea|&s;ure
<PB N="24" REF="022862_0024_0FBA9C2E2BCD39F0">
which the review of it created in his mind! Had it been po&s;&s;ible for the merit of &s;uch exten&s;ive and complicated &s;ervices to mankind to have re&s;cued one mortal from the grave, Dr. Cullen had never died. But the decree of death is univer&s;al, and even the healing art, is finally of no effect in &s;aving the lives of tho&s;e who have exerci&s;ed it with the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s in &s;aving the lives of others.</P>
<P>Dr. CULLEN is now no more. What a blank has been produced by his death in the great volume of Science! Behold! The genius of humanity weeping at his feet, while the genius of medicine lifts up the key, which fell from his hand with his la&s;t breath, and with inexpre&s;&s;ible concern, cries out, "To whom &s;hall I give this in&s;tru|ment? Who now will unlock for me the trea&s;ures of univer&s;al nature?"</P>
<P>VENERABLE Shades, adieu! What tho' thy American pupils were denied the melan|choly plea&s;ure of following thee from thy Profe&s;&s;ors-chair to thy &s;ick-bed, with their effu&s;ions of gratitude, and prai&s;e! What tho' we did not &s;hare in the grief of thy fu|neral ob&s;equies, and though we &s;hall never be|dew with our tears the &s;plendid monument which thy affectionate and grateful Briti&s;h
<PB N="25" REF="022862_0025_0FBA9C2FCCBFA048">
pupils have decreed for thee in the metropo|lis of thy native country; yet the remem|brance of thy talents and virtues, &s;hall be pre&s;erved in each of our bo&s;oms, and never &s;hall we return in triumph from beholding the efficacy of medicine in curing a di&s;ea&s;e, with|out feeling our obligations for the in&s;tructions we have derived from thee!</P>
<P>I repeat it again, Dr. Cullen is now no more&mdash;No more, I mean, a pillar and or|nament of an ancient &s;eat of &s;cience&mdash;no more, the delight and admiration of his pupils&mdash;no more the luminary of medicine to half the globe&mdash;no more, the friend and benefactor of mankind.&mdash;But I would as &s;oon believe that our &s;olar &s;y&s;tem was created only to amu&s;e and peri&s;h like a rocket, as believe that a mind endowed with &s;uch im|men&s;e powers of action and contemplation had cea&s;ed to exi&s;t. Rea&s;on bids us hope that he yet LIVES&mdash;And Revelation ena|bles us to &s;ay, with certainty and confi|dence, that he &s;till LIVES.&mdash;Fain would I lift the curtain which &s;eparates eternity from time, and inquire, what are now his &s;tudies and employments&mdash;But it is not for mortals to pry into the &s;e|crets of the invi&s;ible world.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="022862_0026_0FBA9C3151A44BE0">
SUCH was the man who&s;e memory we have endeavoured to celebrate. He lived for our benefit. It remains only that we im|prove the event of his death in &s;uch a man|ner, that he may die for our benefit likewi&s;e. For this purpo&s;e I &s;hall fini&s;h our Eulogi|um with the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I. LET us learn from the character of Dr. Cullen duly to e&s;timate our profe&s;&s;ion. While A&s;tronomy claims a Newton, and Electricity a Franklin, Medicine has been equally ho|noured by having employed the genius of a Cullen. Whenever therefore we feel our|&s;elves di&s;po&s;ed to relax in our &s;tudies, to u&s;e our profe&s;&s;ion for &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es, or to ne|glect the poor, let us recollect how much we le&s;&s;en the dignity which Dr. Cullen has con|ferred upon our profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>II. BY the death of Dr. Cullen the re|public of medicine has lo&s;t one of its mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed and u&s;eful members. It is incumbent upon us therefore to double our diligence in order to &s;upply the lo&s;s of our in|defatigable fellow-citizen. That phy&s;ician has lived to little purpo&s;e, who does not leave his profe&s;&s;ion in a more improved &s;tate than he found it. Let us remember, that our obliga|tions to add &s;omething to the capital of me|dical
<PB N="27" REF="022862_0027_0FBA9C364617CC98">
knowledge, areequally binding with our obligations to practi&s;e the virtues of integrity and humanity in our intercour&s;e with our pa|tients. Let no u&s;eful fact therefore, however incon&s;iderable it may appear, be kept back from the public eye; for there are mites in &s;cience as well as in charity, and the remote con&s;equences of both are often alike impor|tant and beneficial. Facts are the morality of medicine. They are the &s;ame in all ages and in all countries. They have pre&s;erved the works of the immortal Sydenham from being de&s;troy|ed by their mixture with his ab&s;urd theories; and under all the revolutions in &s;y&s;tems that will probably take place hereafter, the facts which are contained in Dr. Cullen's works, will con&s;titute the be&s;t &s;ecurity for their &s;afe and grateful reception by future ages.</P>
<P>III. HUMAN nature is ever prone to ex|tremes. While we celebrate the prai&s;es of Dr. Cullen, let us take care le&s;t we check a &s;pirit of free inquiry, by too great a regard for his authority in medicine. I well re|member an ob&s;ervation &s;uited to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, which he delivered in his introduc|tion to a cour&s;e of lectures on the in&s;titutes of medicine in the year 1766. After &s;peak|ing
<PB N="28" REF="022862_0028_0FBA9C3710E516A8">
of the long continued and exten&s;ive em|pire of Galen in the &s;chools of phy&s;ic, he &s;aid, <Q>It is a great di&s;advantage to any &s;cience to have been improved by a great man. His authority impo&s;es indolence, timidity, or idolatry upon all who come after him.</Q>&mdash;Let us avoid the&s;e evils in our veneration for Dr. Cullen. To believe in great men, is of|ten as great an ob&s;tacle to the progre&s;s of knowledge, as to believe in witches and con|jurers. It is the image wor&s;hip of &s;cience; for error is as much an attribute of man, as the de&s;ire of happine&s;s; and I think I have ob&s;erved, that the errors of great men partake of the dimen&s;ions of their minds, and are of|ten of a greater magnitude than the errors of men of inferior under&s;tanding. Dr. Brown has proved the imperfection of human geni|us, by extending &s;ome parts of Dr. Cullen's &s;y&s;tem of phy&s;ic, and perhaps by correc|ting &s;ome of its defects. But he has left much to be done by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. He has even bequeathed to them the labor of remo|ving the errors he has introduced into medi|cine by his neglect of an important principle in the animal oeconomy, and by his ignorance of the hi&s;tories and &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;es. Perhaps no &s;y&s;tem of medicine can be per|fect,
<PB N="29" REF="022862_0029_0FBA9C38B3524670">
while there exi&s;ts a &s;ingle di&s;ea&s;e which we do not know, or cannot cure. If this be true, then a complete &s;y&s;tem of medicine can|not be formed, till America has furni&s;hed de&s;criptions and cures of all her peculiar di&s;ea&s;es. The United States have perfected the &s;cience of civil government. The free|dom of our con&s;titutions, by imparting vigor and independence to the mind, is favourable to bold and original thinking upon all &s;ubjects. Let us avail our&s;elves therefore of this politi|cal aid to our re&s;earches, and endeavour to ob|tain hi&s;tories and cures of all our di&s;ea&s;es, that we may thereby contribute our part towards the formation of a complete &s;y&s;tem of medicine. As a religion of &s;ome kind is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to promote morals; &s;o &s;y&s;tems of me|dicine of &s;ome kind, are equally nece&s;&s;ary to produce a regular mode of practice. They are not only nece&s;&s;ary, but unavoidable in medicine; for no phy&s;ician, nay more, no empiric, practi&s;es without them.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent is an age of great improve|ment. While the application of rea&s;on to the &s;ciences of government and religion, is daily meliorating the condition of mankind, it is agreeable to ob&s;erve the influence or me|dicine,
<PB N="30" REF="022862_0030_0FBA9C3A5CBB1270">
in le&s;&s;ening human mi&s;ery, by aba|ting the mortality or violence of many di&s;|ea&s;es. The decrees of heaven appear to be fulfilling by natural means; and if no ancient prophecies had declared it, the late nume|rous di&s;coveries in medicine would authorize us to &s;ay, that the time is approaching, when not only tyranny, di&s;cord and &s;uper&s;tition &s;hall cea&s;e from our world, but when di&s;ea&s;|es &s;hall be unknown, or cea&s;e to be incurable; and when old age &s;hall be the only outlet of human life.</P>
<P>"THUS heavenward all things tend." In that glorious aera, every di&s;covery in me|dicine &s;hall meet with its full reward; and the more abundant gratitude of po&s;terity to the name of Dr. Cullen, &s;hall then bury in oblivion the feeble attempt of this day to comply with your vote to perpetuate his fame.</P>
