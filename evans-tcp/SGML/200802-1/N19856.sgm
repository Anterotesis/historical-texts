<Q>RIGHTEOUSNESS EXALTETH A NATION: BUT SIN IS A RE|PROACH TO ANY PEOPLE.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE great &s;ource of all human know|ledge is experience; and that experience which teaches us practical wi&s;dom, and informs us of the many evils that con&s;tantly wait on life, is acquired chiefly by ob|&s;ervation and reflection. Time, indeed, is continu|ally forcing the in&s;tructions of this &s;age monitor on our notice, and when "length of days" has not made us &s;ufficiently acquainted with her, we fly to the aged that we may learn her coun&s;els; or read them with &s;ufficient certainty, in the mi&s;conduct, di&s;appoint|ment, and mi&s;eries of others.</P>
<P>THE Hi&s;torian makes it his peculiar glory, that by faithfully recording the fates of kingdoms, by delinea|ting the virtues which rai&s;ed &s;ome to magnificence,
<PB N="6" REF="025963_0005_0FCFD8681F1F6C28">
and the vices which brought others gradually to de|&s;truction, he anticipates the future by a true repre|&s;entation of the pa&s;t, and teaches men wi&s;dom by the example of others. But though, from the &s;hort pe|riod of human life, the narrowne&s;s of our views, and the nece&s;&s;ary calls of duty, we are obliged to recur to the experience of tho&s;e who have gone before us, for almo&s;t all our knowledge; yet the few events that happen to our&s;elves, or that fall within the circle of our own ob&s;ervation, make a far more la&s;ting impre&s;|&s;ion on us, and have a much greater influence over the heart.</P>
<P>THE &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, that happen either to nations or individuals, we hear with faint emotion, and often regard them only as they &s;erve to gratify curio&s;ity, and increa&s;e our &s;tore of knowledge. The Hi&s;torian's eloquence, and the Poet's fancy can &s;carcely rai&s;e the tear of &s;ympathy, while they relate, with all the decoration of language, the mi&s;eries of life; and tho&s;e &s;orrows which only the be&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t bo&s;oms feel occa&s;ionally for the calamities of others, are but of &s;hort duration. They vani&s;h quick as the morning dews di&s;&s;olve before the ri&s;ing &s;un, and oft, like them, "leave not a trace behind." But &s;uch calamities and di&s;appointments as befal our&s;elves, are con&s;idered as dear bought experience, and trea&s;ured up in the heart. The&s;e are the coun&s;ellors that will make us wi&s;e and good; unle&s;s in de&s;pite of rea&s;on and of nature, we &s;uffer life to glide away unnoticed, without improvement in knowledge or in virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="025963_0006_0FCFD8B1A36105A8">SERIOUS reflection on what has pa&s;&s;ed, with a con|&s;tant habit of comparing it to the future, &s;eems, in|deed, to be a rule of moral di&s;cipline, natural to the mind of man, and is one of the greate&s;t &s;afeguards of virtue, as well as the be&s;t means of acquiring u&s;eful knowledge. The fluctuating &s;tate of our minds makes it nece&s;&s;ary to take the&s;e retro&s;pective views of life, that we may increa&s;e in prudence, ane e&s;tabli&s;h our|&s;elves in virtue.</P>
<P>UNDER the full per&s;ua&s;ion of the efficacy of this principle, as well as the influence of the Divine Spirit, the Proverbs of Solomon, which have always been e&s;teemed a mo&s;t valuable part of the holy Scriptures, were written. He &s;ays him&s;elf, that they were the fruits of his mo&s;t profound meditations, and of his mo&s;t excellent wi&s;dom. Becau&s;e the Preacher was wi&s;e, he &s;till taught the people knowledge; yea he gave good heed, and &s;ought out, and &s;et in order many Proverbs. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. xii.9.</NOTE> To give the more weight and dig|nity to his precepts, he delivers them not as his own, but as tho&s;e of Wi&s;dom her&s;elf; and in the poetic and dramatic way, introduces her as a divine per&s;on, the favourite offspring and fir&s;t born of God, who dwelt with him before the foundations of the earth were laid, before time and the world was, and who is &s;ent forth from him to guide, and in&s;truct the children of men.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e Proverbs or wi&s;e &s;ayings, we find many excellent rules for the conduct of human life, and for leading men to happine&s;s. But perhaps there is not any thing in the whole book, of greater im|portance
<PB N="8" REF="025963_0007_0FCFD869A0625820">
to us, as members of civil &s;ociety, than the aphori&s;m contained in our text. Righteou&s;ne&s;s ex|alteth a nation, but &s;in is a reproach to any people.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that the word <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> is u&s;ed, in the &s;acred writings, with different degrees of latitude. Sometimes, it is applied in a confined &s;en&s;e, as &s;ignifying that uprightne&s;s, equity and ju&s;tice, which we &s;hould maintain in our treatment of our fellow creatures, by rendering to all their proper dues; and is &s;ynonimous with ju&s;tice. But the word is u&s;ually taken in a more exten&s;ive &s;ignification, as de&s;criptive of goodne&s;s in general. In this &s;en&s;e the righteous man is one, who acts well in all the relations and char|acters in which he is placed; who lives in the prac|tice of piety, benevolence, &s;elf government and uni|ver&s;al goodne&s;s. In this larger meaning, the term is mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed throughout the P&s;alms, the Proverbs and the New Te&s;tament. Thus, To him that &s;oweth righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be a &s;ure reward. As righteou&s;ne&s;s tendeth to life, &s;o he that pur&s;ueth evil, pur&s;ueth it to his own death. It is in this exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, that the word is undoubtedly u&s;ed in our text. A righteous per&s;on is one who maintains an upright, holy and virtuous part through the whole cour&s;e and tenor of his life. He is one, who &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;iders, and &s;teadily di&s;charges the general obligations of pi|ety and goodne&s;s. This, no doubt, will nece&s;&s;arily include in it, his being righteous in the &s;trict and limi|ted &s;ignification of the term. He makes a point of pre&s;erving an exact fidelity and equity in his inter|cour&s;e with mankind. According to the be&s;t of his
<PB N="9" REF="025963_0008_0FCFD8B4CC1039F0">
abilities he renders to his fellow creatures their dues, and treats them in a manner agreeable to the various claims, of one kind and another, which they have upon him. He is true to his engagements, and faithful to his promi&s;es.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, he performs the other offices and duties of the virtuous character. He is not only hone&s;t and equitable, but kind and benevolent. He endeavours to promote the welfare of tho&s;e around him, and to behave, in every re&s;pect, as one who is animated with the principles of affection to his bre|thren of the human nature. He makes it his labour, his delight, to render them happy, &s;o far as the ca|pacity of doing it, which Providence hath put in his power, extends.</P>
<P>NOR, while he is ju&s;t and generous towards men, is he unju&s;t to, or forgetful of, the ever ble&s;&s;ed GOD. He &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;iders his obligations to the greate&s;t and be&s;t of beings, and is &s;olicitous to te&s;tify his &s;en&s;e of them, by all the returns which he is capable of making. Hence he cultivates the deepe&s;t reverence for the &s;acred name of his Maker, and the warme&s;t &s;entiments of devotion towards him. Hence he loves his high Creator and Benefactor, above every object be&s;ide, is truly thankful for the mercies he receives from him, tru&s;ts in his protection and &s;upport, &s;ub|mits to his will, and is obedient to his commands.</P>
<P>EQUALLY intent is the righteous man upon main|taining and cheri&s;hing the per&s;onal virtues. He keeps
<PB N="10" REF="025963_0009_0FCFD86EEDD3C7F0">
him&s;elf in the exerci&s;e of &s;elf government, temperance, moderation, meekne&s;s, humility and contentment. In &s;hort, he endeavours to be found in all the com|mandments and ordinances of the Lord blamele&s;s, and to pre&s;erve all the graces of the &s;piritual life.</P>
<P>SUCH is the righteou&s;ne&s;s the wi&s;e man &s;peaks of as exhibited in practice; and a righteous nation con|&s;i&s;ts of a number of individuals who&s;e character and conduct are &s;uch as we have now briefly delineated.</P>
<P>THE &s;in mentioned in our text, as the reproach of a people, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the oppo&s;ite to this great and good character. When the people com|po&s;ing a nation &s;hew no regard to the eternal rules of equity and ju&s;tice; when true religion decays, and they lo&s;e their reverence for the Divine Being; when they de&s;pi&s;e his in&s;titutions, and profane his &s;abbaths; when they ridicule his word, and indulge them&s;elves in the breach of his commands; when infidelity and vice prevail; when impiety and irreligion mark the character of a people&mdash;then iniquity abounds, and they are under the influence of that &s;in, which is their greate&s;t reproach.</P>
<P>TAKING then the word righteou&s;ne&s;s in the &s;en&s;e we have explained it, to &s;ignify religion and virtue in gen|eral, our text naturally pre&s;ents us with a &s;ubject, which, I flatter my&s;elf, will not be con&s;idered as altogether fo|reign from the de&s;ign of our pre&s;ent a&s;&s;embling, viz. THE HARMONY OF RELIGION AND CIVIL POLI|TY;
<PB N="11" REF="025963_0010_0FCFD86CA093F358">
or, that religion and virtue are the &s;ure&s;t means of promoting national happine&s;s and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>WHEN Solomon a&s;&s;erts that religion or righteou&s;|ne&s;s exalteth a nation, we are not to under&s;tand the propo&s;ition in &s;o &s;trict and ab&s;olute a &s;en&s;e, as that true religion is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>in all its doctrines,</HI> and in all the extent of its precepts, that there have been no in|&s;tances of the pro&s;perity of &s;ocieties, which have not been wholly regulated by it. Some States, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, which have been only partially govern|ed by its maxims, have enjoyed long and glorious ad|vantages upon the theatre of the world; either becau&s;e their fal&s;e religions contained &s;ome principles of recti|tude, in common with the true religion; or, becau&s;e GOD, in order to animate and encourage &s;uch people to the practice of &s;ome virtues, nece&s;&s;ary to the very being of &s;ociety, annexed &s;ucce&s;s to the exerci&s;e of them; or, becau&s;e rectitude was never &s;o fully e&s;tab|li&s;hed upon earth, as to preclude inju&s;tice from en|joying the advantages of virtue, or virtue from &s;uffer|ing the penalties of vice. However this may be, we affirm, that the mo&s;t &s;ure method that a nation can take to &s;upport and exalt it&s;elf, is to follow the laws of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the &s;pirit of religion.</P>
<P>NOR is it a&s;&s;erted in our text, that, in <HI>every par|ticular ca&s;e,</HI> religion is more &s;ucce&s;sful in procuring &s;ome temporary advantage than the violation of it; &s;o that to con&s;ider &s;ociety only in this point of light, and to confine it to this particular ca&s;e, independent|ly of all other circum&s;tances, religion yields the ho|nour
<PB N="12" REF="025963_0011_0FCFD871550EEE20">
of temporary pro&s;perity to inju&s;tice. Some State crimes may have been &s;ucce&s;sful, and have been the &s;teps by which certain nations have acquired worldly glo|ry. And &s;hould we acknowledge that virtue has &s;ome|times been an ob&s;tacle to grandeur, &s;till the truth of the propo&s;ition in our text &s;tands unimpeached&mdash;that if we con&s;ider a nation in every point of light, and in all circum&s;tances, it will be found that the more a &s;ociety practi&s;es virtue, the more pro&s;perity it will enjoy; the more it abandons it&s;elf to vice, the more mi&s;ery it will &s;ooner or later &s;uffer; &s;o that the very vice which contributed to its exaltation, will produce its de&s;truc|tion, and the virtue which &s;eemed at fir&s;t to aba&s;e it, will in the end exalt its glory.</P>
<P>WE ob&s;erve further here, that by a nation's being exalted, the in&s;pired author of our text does not in|tend &s;uch an elevation as worldly heroes, or rather ty|rants, aim at. If, by exalting a nation, is under&s;tood an elevation extending it&s;elf beyond the limits of rectitude; an elevation not directed by ju&s;tice and good faith, con&s;i&s;ting in the acqui&s;itions of wanton and arbitrary power, obliging other nations to &s;ubmit to a yoke of &s;lavery, and thus becoming an execution|er of divine vengeance on all mankind&mdash;we allow, that in this &s;en&s;e, exaltation is not an effect of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. But, by exalting a nation, the wi&s;e man in|tends, whatever promotes the greate&s;t happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of its citizens; its being governed by wi&s;e and whole&s;ome laws, enjoying liberty and equal gov|ernment, negociating &s;ucce&s;sful treaties, attacking its enemies with courage, defending it&s;elf with re&s;olution,
<PB N="13" REF="025963_0012_0FCFD8B9E3CC6208">
enjoying every ble&s;&s;ing conducive to the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of a people; and at the &s;ame time ble&s;&s;ed with the favourable notice and regard of the Divine Being. Such an exaltation is obtained only by righ|teou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN a word, it is not the lot of humanity, that the pro&s;perity of any nation &s;hould be &s;o perfect, as to exclude all untoward circum&s;tances. The meaning of our text mu&s;t be, that the highe&s;t glory, and the mo&s;t perfect happine&s;s, which can be enjoyed by a nation, in a world, where, after all, there mu&s;t be a mixture of adver&s;ity with pro&s;perity, are the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s. No nation was ever yet free from evils and inconveniences of many kinds; and even the mo&s;t virtuous &s;ocieties have been &s;uffered to labour under many &s;traits and difficulties; and it mu&s;t be allowed, that this world will always be to publick bodies what it is to individuals, a place of mi&s;ery and unhappi|ne&s;s; and therefore we mu&s;t under&s;tand our text as a&s;&s;erting only, that the mo&s;t &s;olid happine&s;s, which can be enjoyed here below, has righteou&s;ne&s;s for its cau&s;e. It is the more nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;train it with|in the&s;e limitations, not only becau&s;e they explain the &s;en&s;e of the in&s;pired author, but becau&s;e they &s;erve to preclude &s;uch objections, to unravel &s;uch &s;ophi&s;ms, and to &s;olve &s;uch difficulties, as infidels and libertines have urged again&s;t its truth.</P>
<P>TO prove, then, that religion and virtue are the &s;ure&s;t means of promoting national happine&s;s and pro&s;perity, let us con&s;ider the origin of civil govern|ment, and the motives which induced mankind to
<PB N="14" REF="025963_0013_0FCFD8751E2FE7C0">
unite them&s;elves in &s;ociety. By doing this, we &s;hall perceive that righteou&s;ne&s;s is the only thing that can render nations happy.</P>
<P>EVERY individual has a great variety of wants, and but few, and tho&s;e very limited, faculties to &s;upply them. Every individual of mankind has need of knowledge to inform him, of laws to direct him, of property to &s;upport him, of food to nouri&s;h him, of clothing and covering to defend him again&s;t the in|clemencies of the &s;ea&s;ons. This catalogue of our va|rious and re&s;pective wants might ea&s;ily be enlarged. Similar intere&s;ts form a &s;imilar de&s;ign. Divers men unite them&s;elves together, in order that the indu&s;try of all may &s;upply the wants of each. Hence the origin of &s;ocieties and publick bodies of men.</P>
<P>THE Author of our being has al&s;o given to man a nature fitted for, and di&s;po&s;ed to, &s;ociety. It was not good for man at fir&s;t to be alone; his nature is &s;ocial, having various affections, propen&s;ities and pa&s;|&s;ions, which re&s;pect &s;ociety, and cannot be indulged without a &s;ocial intercour&s;e. The natural principles of benevolence, compa&s;&s;ion, ju&s;tice, and indeed mo&s;t of our natural affections, powerfully incite to, and plainly indicate that man was formed for, &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE &s;ocial affections of our nature, and the de&s;ire of the many conveniences, not to be obtained or en|joyed, without the concurrence of others, probably fir&s;t induced men to a&s;&s;ociate together. But the de|pravity of our nature &s;ince the apo&s;tacy, and the great
<PB N="15" REF="025963_0014_0FCFD8BD7AFCB928">
prevalency of lu&s;ts and corruptions, have obliged man|kind to enter into clo&s;er connexions and combina|tions, for mutual protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thus civil &s;ocieties and governments were formed, and in this way government comes from God, and is his or|dinance. The kingdom is the Lord's, and he is the Governor among the nations. By him kings reign, and princes decree ju&s;tice, even all the judges of the earth.</P>
<P>THE end and de&s;ign of civil &s;ociety and govern|ment, from this view of its origin, mu&s;t be to &s;ecure the rights and properties of its members, and to pro|mote their welfare and happine&s;s; or, in the words of in&s;piration, that men may live quiet and peaceable lives, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to perceive then, that in order to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings propo&s;ed by this a&s;&s;emblage, &s;ome fixed max|ims mu&s;t be laid down, and inviolably obeyed. It is nece&s;&s;ary that all the members of this body &s;hould con&s;ider them&s;elves as naturally equal; that by this idea they may be inclined to afford each other mutual &s;uccour. It is requi&s;ite that they &s;hould be &s;incere to each other, le&s;t deceit &s;hould &s;erve for a veil to con|ceal the &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns of &s;ome from the eyes of the re&s;t. The rigid rules of equity &s;hould be inviolably ob&s;erved, that &s;o they may fulfil the contracts, which they bound them&s;elves to perform, when they were admitted into this &s;ociety. E&s;teem and benevolence ought to give life and action to righteou&s;ne&s;s. It is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, that the happine&s;s of all
<PB N="16" REF="025963_0015_0FCFD878774D8FF0">
&s;hould be preferred before the intere&s;t of an individ|ual; and that in ca&s;es where publick and private in|tere&s;ts cla&s;h, the publick good &s;hould always prevail. Every citizen ought to cultivate his own talents, that he may contribute to the happine&s;s of that &s;ociety, to which he ought to devote him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t &s;incerity and zeal. The&s;e duties are ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary for the welfare and pro&s;perity of &s;ocieties. And what can be more proper to make us ob&s;erve the&s;e rules than religion,&mdash;than righteou&s;ne&s;s? Religion brings us to feel our natural equality; it teaches us that we originate in the &s;ame du&s;t; have the &s;ame GOD for our Creator; are all de&s;cended from the &s;ame fir&s;t Parent; all partake of the &s;ame mi&s;eries, and are all doomed to the &s;ame la&s;t end. Religion teaches us &s;incerity to each other; that the tongue &s;hould be a faithful interpreter of the mind; that we &s;hould &s;peak every man truth with his neighbour; and, that being always in the &s;ight of the GOD of truth, we &s;hould never deviate from the laws of truth. Religion teach|es us that we &s;hould be ju&s;t; that we &s;hould render to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;tom; fear to whom fear; hon|our to whom honour; that what&s;oever we would men &s;hould do unto us, we &s;hould do even &s;o unto them. Religion requires us to be animated with charity,&mdash;to con&s;ider each other as creatures of one GOD, &s;ub|jects of the &s;ame heavenly King, members of one body, and heirs of the &s;ame glory. It requires us to give up our private intere&s;t to the publick good, not to &s;eek our own, but every one another's wealth; it even requires us to lay down our lives for the brethren.
<PB N="17" REF="025963_0016_0FCFD8C173CA1650">
Thus if we con&s;ider nations in the&s;e primitive views, it is righteou&s;ne&s;s alone that exalts them.</P>
<P>WERE we to de&s;cend from the&s;e general principles, and take into view the particular forms of govern|ment, which have been adopted by the various nations upon earth; or rather, which have grown out of parti|cular occa&s;ions and emergencies; from the fluctuat|ing policy of different ages; from the contentions, &s;ucce&s;&s;es, intere&s;ts and opportunities of different orders and parties of men among them (for &s;uch we &s;hall find was the origin of mo&s;t of the particular forms of gov|ernment in the world,) we &s;hall be convinced that each nation has been, more or le&s;s happy, in its own mode of governing, has more or le&s;s prevented the inconveni|ences, to which its form of government is &s;ubject, ac|cording as it has been more or le&s;s attached to religion or righteou&s;ne&s;s. The precepts and the maxims of religion, applied to the&s;e imperfections, would effectu|ally re&s;train all tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es, and preclude tho&s;e evils, from which the mo&s;t perfect forms of government are not entirely free. But the time will not permit us to enter into &s;o particular an inquiry, or to multiply quotations to prove this point.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to ob&s;erve, &s;econdly, that the doctrine of Providence will furni&s;h us with another argument, to prove the truth of our text.</P>
<P>THE conduct of Providence, with regard to publick bodies is very different from that, which prevails in the ca&s;e of individuals. It is a rule in the divine govern|ment,
<PB N="18" REF="025963_0017_0FCFD87B447AF518">
to deal with nations according to their moral character. Perfect ju&s;tice is the invariable rule of his dominion over publick bodies. In regard to individu|als, Providence is involved in darkne&s;s. Many times it &s;eems to condemn virtue, and crown inju&s;tice; to leave innocence to groan in &s;ilence, and to empower guilt to riot, and triumph in publick. The wicked rich man fared &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, while Lazarus de&s;ired, in vain, to be fed with the crumbs that fell from his table. St. Paul was executed on a &s;caf|fold, while Nero reigned on Cae&s;ar's throne.</P>
<P>BUT Providence is directed in a different method, in regard to publick bodies. Pro&s;perity in them is the effect of righteou&s;ne&s;s; publick happine&s;s is the reward of publick virtue; the wi&s;e&s;t nation is u&s;ually the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, and <Q>virtue walks with glory by her &s;ide.</Q> The work of righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be peace, and the effects of righteou&s;ne&s;s, quietne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance forever. On the other hand, the judgments of Heaven are commonly &s;howered down upon a wicked people; he turneth a fruitful land into bar|renne&s;s, for the wickedne&s;s of them that dwell therein.</P>
<P>GOD &s;ometimes, indeed, afflicts the mo&s;t virtuous nations; but he does &s;o with the de&s;ign of purifying them, and of opening new occa&s;ions to be&s;tow larger benefits upon them. He &s;ometimes, indeed, pro&s;pers wicked nations; but their pro&s;perity is an effort of his patience and long &s;uffering; it is to give them time to prevent their de&s;truction, and by his goodne&s;s, to lead them to repentance. But, as before ob&s;erved,
<PB N="19" REF="025963_0018_0FCFD8C2EC806138">
pro&s;perity <HI>u&s;ually</HI> follows righteou&s;ne&s;s in publick bodies; publick happine&s;s is the reward of publick virtue; the wi&s;e&s;t nation is the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, and glory is <HI>generally</HI> connected with virtue. And this conduct of Providence is grounded on this rea&s;on. A day will come when Lazarus will be indemnified, and the rich man puni&s;hed; when St. Paul will be rewarded, and Nero will be confounded. Innocence will be avenged, ju&s;tice &s;atisfied, the maje&s;ty of the laws repaired, and the rights of GOD maintained.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch a retribution is impracticable in regard to publick bodies. A nation cannot then be puni&s;hed as a nation, nor a kingdom as a kingdom. All the dif|ferent forms of government will then be aboli&s;hed. While &s;ome of the human race are put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of glory, others will be covered with &s;hame and confu|&s;ion of face. It &s;eems then, that Providence owes to its own rectitude, tho&s;e times of vengeance, in which it pours all its wrath on wicked nations; &s;ends them them wars, famines, plagues and other cata&s;trophes, of which hi&s;tory gives us &s;o many memorable examples. To place hopes altogether on worldly policy; to pretend to derive advantages from vice, and &s;o to found the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, on the ruins of religion and virtue, is little &s;hort of in&s;ulting Providence. It is to arou&s;e that power again&s;t us, which, &s;ooner or later, over|whelms and confounds vicious &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>BUT if the ob&s;curity of the ways of Providence, which u&s;ually renders doubtful, our rea&s;onings upon the divine conduct, weaken this argument, let us con|&s;ider the declarations of GOD him&s;elf upon this point.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="025963_0019_0FCFD87C61C2AB70">THE whole 28th chapter of Deuteronomy, all the ble&s;&s;ings and cur&s;es pronounced there, fully prove our doctrine. Read the tender complaint, which GOD formerly made concerning the irregularities of his peo|ple. O that they were wi&s;e, that they under&s;tood this, that they would con&s;ider their latter end! How &s;hould one cha&s;e a thou&s;and, and two put ten thou&s;and to flight. Agreeably to this, are the affecting words uttered by the mouth of the P&s;almi&s;t&mdash;O that my peo|ple had hearkened unto me, and I&s;rael had walked in my ways. I &s;hould &s;oon have &s;ubdued their enemies, and turned mine hand again&s;t their adver&s;aries. Their time &s;hould have endured forever. I &s;hould have fed them al&s;o, with the fine&s;t of the wheat, and with ho|ney out of the rock &s;hould I have &s;atisfied them. What noble promi&s;es are made al&s;o by the mini&s;try of I&s;aiah? Thus faith the Lord thy Redeemer, the Holy One of I&s;rael, I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit; which leadeth thee by the way thou &s;hould&s;t go. O that thou had&s;t hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s as the waves of the &s;ea; thy feed al&s;o had been as the &s;and, and thy name &s;hould not have been cut off, nor de&s;troyed before me. Ob|&s;erve al&s;o the terrible threatnings, denounced again&s;t back&s;liding I&s;rael, by the prophet Jeremiah. Though Mo&s;es and Samuel &s;tood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people; ca&s;t them out of my &s;ight, and let them go forth. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, if they &s;ay unto thee, Whither &s;hall we go forth? Then thou &s;halt tell them; Thus faith the Lord, Such as are for death to death, and &s;uch as are for the &s;word to

the &s;word, and &s;uch as are for the famine to the famine, and &s;uch as are for captivity to captivity. Thou ha&s;t for&s;aken me, faith the Lord, thou art gone backward; therefore will I &s;tretch out my hand again&s;t thee, and de&s;troy thee: I am weary of repenting.</P>
<P>NOT to multiply quotations; we find that through the whole hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament, the inter|changeable providences of GOD, towards the Jewi&s;h nation, were always &s;uited to their manners. They were con&s;tantly pro&s;perous or afflicted, according as religion and righteou&s;ne&s;s flouri&s;hed, or declined among them.</P>
<P>NOR was this Providence exerci&s;ed only towards his own people, but he dealt thus with other nations, as their hi&s;tory evinces; and thus the truth of our text is proved by experience. Were we to con&s;ult the ancient hi&s;tory of the Egyptians, the Per&s;ians, or the Romans, who &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them all, we &s;hall find they were by turns exalted, as they re&s;pected righteou&s;ne&s;s, or aba&s;ed, as they neglected it.</P>

The children of the royal family, and of the nobles, were, at an early period of life, put under the tuition of four of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous &s;tate&s;men. The

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Montague's Letters.</NOTE> The Romans founded their &s;y&s;tem of policy upon that be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t principle, the fear of the gods; a firm belief of a divine &s;uperintending Providence, and a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments. Their children were trained up in this belief from tender in|fancy, which took root and grew up with them, by the influence of an excellent education, where they had the benefit of example, as well as precept. Hence we read of no heathen nation in the world, where, both the publick and private duties of religion, were &s;o &s;trictly adhered to, and &s;o &s;crupulou&s;ly ob|&s;erved, as among the Romans. They imputed their good or bad &s;ucce&s;s to the ob&s;ervance of the&s;e duties, and they received publick pro&s;perity, or publick ca|lamities, as ble&s;&s;ings conferred, or puni&s;hments in|flicted, by their gods. Though the ceremonies of their religion ju&s;tly appear to us, in&s;tances of the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and mo&s;t extravagant &s;uper&s;tition, yet, as they were e&s;teemed the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential acts of religion, by the Romans, they mu&s;t con&s;equently carry all the force of a religious principle. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ciero de Harus.

knowledge of the virtues, which con&s;titute &s;ub|&s;tantial grandeur; and as they held errors in religion, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have erred in civil polity.

<P><PB N="32" REF="025963_0031_0FCFD8960B42B0C0">FEW nations have ever enjoyed the opportunity of taking up government upon its fir&s;t principles, and of choo&s;ing that form, which is adapted to their &s;itu|ation, and mo&s;t productive of their publick intere&s;ts and happine&s;s. <Q>The government of the United States,</Q> &s;ays a political writer, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paley.</NOTE> <Q>approaches neare&s;t to the &s;ocial compact, of any that hi&s;tory can fur|ni&s;h.</Q> Upon an impartial examination of our con&s;titution of government, we find it the be&s;t calcu|lated for promoting the happine&s;s, and pre&s;erving the lives, liberty, and property of the citizens, of any yet recorded in hi&s;tory. Liberty is here placed in the cu&s;tody of the people. It wi&s;ely guards again&s;t anar|chy, and confu&s;ion on the one hand, and tyranny, and oppre&s;&s;ion on the other. It is framed upon an extent, not only of civil, but of religious liberty, unexampled, perhaps, in any other country. The &s;acred rights of con&s;cience are &s;o &s;ecured, that <Q>no citizen can be hurt, mole&s;ted, or re&s;trained in his per&s;on, liberty or e&s;tate, for wor&s;hipping GOD, in the manner and &s;ea&s;on, mo&s;t agreeable to the dictates of his con&s;ci|ence, or for his religious profe&s;&s;ion or &s;entiments.</Q> How &s;hould this con&s;ideration endear it to its citi|zens, and induce them to reverence it&mdash;not only calmly to &s;ubmit to it, but to regard it with a vene|ration and affection ri&s;ing even to enthu&s;ia&s;m, like that, which prevailed at Sparta, and at Rome.</P>
<P>HAPPY people, who&s;e lot is fallen to them in plea|&s;ant places, and who have &s;o goodly an heritage. Hap|py people! if we have wi&s;dom and virtue, to improve
<PB N="33" REF="025963_0032_0FCFD89A390DDD90">
aright the advantages we now enjoy. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, who hath vi&s;ited, and redeemed his people who hath called them to liberty, and granted them the ble&s;&s;ing of peace, and of a free government.</P>
<P>ONE other favour, you will permit me to mention, is our national pro&s;perity. One ble&s;&s;ing generally introduces another, and this is the con&s;equence of peace, and a free government. Our &s;words are now turned into plough&s;hares, and our &s;pears into pruning hooks. Our &s;hips, in&s;tead of carrying the engines of de&s;truction, are now fraught with the &s;tores of the merchant, and convey to us, from all quarters of the world, the peculiar trea&s;ures of kings, and the pro|vinces. The riches of the earth, and the abundance of the &s;eas, are profu&s;ely poured into our laps.</P>
<P>BUT are we not, by an abu&s;e of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, in danger of being deprived of them? If, having eaten and become full; having built goodly hou&s;es, and dwelt therin; and having our &s;ilver and our gold, and all that we have, greatly multiplied and increa&s;ed; in&s;tead of being thankful for the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, and tem|perate in the u&s;e of them, we become pre&s;umptuo&s;ly lifted up, and forget the Lord our God; if, while we enjoy the highe&s;t degree of political liberty and pro&s;|perity, we are not a virtuous and religious people, &s;hall we not provoke the Mo&s;t High to withdraw the&s;e fa|vours from us, and <Q>to empty us from ve&s;&s;el to ve&s;|&s;el?</Q> If, in&s;tead of practi&s;ing that righteou&s;ne&s;s, which exalteth a nation, we indulge a &s;pirit of &s;elf ex|altation; what an army of evils will prevail with it?</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="025963_0033_0FCFD89B1C95E2E8">Luxury and exce&s;s &s;uper&s;ede the enjoyment of the things them&s;elves. Oftentation, in a great mea|&s;ure, &s;upplants the true delights of &s;ociety, and an emulous &s;uperiority in pride, and di&s;tinction, contri|butes, materially to the utter annihilation of &s;imple principles, and almo&s;t, cuts a&s;under the cords of gen|uine, &s;entimental friendship, The fate of nations confirms a very ancient doctrine of revelation, that whenever pulick pro&s;perity cau&s;es a forgetfulne&s;s of GOD, a contempt of religion, and increa&s;ing profli|gacy, in the manners of a people, that very pro&s;perity &s;hall de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>WITH this declaration, and with the many exam|ples of its truth, recorded in the page of hi&s;tory, let us exert our&s;elves to perpetuate the great ble&s;&s;ings, and privileges we enjoy, by a contrary demeanor, and a more Chri&s;tian deportment than we have hitherto exerci&s;ed; for the prolongation of our national charter is entirely dependent thereon; and the continuance of national pro&s;perity is &s;olely held, by this conditional tenure, the Lord is with us, while we are with him; if we &s;eek him, he will be found of us, but if we for|&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake us.</P>
<P>NOR are we in le&s;s danger, from the abu&s;e of our civil liberty, than from that of our pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>CIVIL government is, doubtle&s;s, one of the great|e&s;t external ble&s;&s;ings, of which we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. It is our protection from fraud and inju&s;tice&mdash;from ra|pine and violence. It is the &s;ecurity of our lives&mdash;of
<PB N="35" REF="025963_0034_0FCFD89F44C35088">
our property&mdash;of every thing that is dear to us. The abu&s;e of liberty is the greate&s;t of evils, and draws after it, a train of the mo&s;t baneful con&s;equences. When a people mi&s;improve their privileges, and become di&s;|orderly, ungovernable, and factious, they introduce a &s;tate of anarchy, which is wor&s;e than ab&s;olute de&s;|poti&s;m.</P>
<P>No one, of the lea&s;t reflection, can be in&s;en&s;ible, what great advantages that nation enjoys, which is not only in a &s;tate of perfect peace with its neighbours, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es uninterrupted quiet tranquillity at home; which is neither threatened with foreign in&s;ult, nor mole&s;ted by inbred commotions, generaly, &s;peaking far more dangerous than the former; at lea&s;t, when they ri&s;e to any con&s;iderable heighth. It has, indeed, been &s;aid, that <Q>&s;mall di&s;turbances in the &s;tate, do the &s;ame &s;ervice that the winds do in the air, by motion to keep it from &s;tagnation and putrefaction:</Q> But when once the winds are rai&s;ed, no one can tell when they will be laid, or how &s;trong they will grow; and that which was wantonly, or from &s;elfi&s;h views, rai&s;ed, to &s;erve a pre&s;ent turn, may, in time, come to overturn a con&s;titution.</P>
<P>WE are not indeed to &s;uppo&s;e, that every &s;mall in|quietude, every little party or faction, that happens to take place, will be able to accompli&s;h &s;uch extraordi|nary, &s;uch pernicious events; yet, it will not be di&s;|puted, but that they are liable to produce many fatal, and de&s;tructive con&s;equences; which, though nor al|ways immediately apparent, will yet, in time, become

&s;ufficiently manife&s;t, by a general corruption of man|ners, and by breaking loo&s;e from all proper re&s;traint.</P>
<P>AN ingenious writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Federali&s;t.</NOTE> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, "That a dan|gerous ambition oftener lurks behind the &s;pecious ma&s;k of zeal for the rights of the people, than under the forbidden appearance of enthu&s;ia&s;m, for the firm|ne&s;s, and efficiency of government. Hi&s;tory will teach us, that the former has been found a much more cer|tain road to the introduction of de&s;poti&s;m, than the latter; and that of tho&s;e men who have overturned the liberty of republicks, the greate&s;t number have begun their career, by paying an ob&s;equious court to the peo|ple, commencing demagogues, and ending tyrants."</P>
<P>HOW cautious, then, &s;hould we be, while we are zealous for liberty, that we do not de&s;pi&s;e government, and weaken the &s;prings of it, by running into licentiou&s;|ne&s;s. A &s;pirit of faction, of murmuring and di&s;|content, may execite internal di&s;cord, which may ac|compli&s;h that, which external violence was not able to effect, I mean our independence, liberty, and &s;afety.</P>
<P>WE have no rea&s;on to doubt of the virtues, and abilities of tho&s;e, whom our own free choice has made the guardians of our rights, both in the federal and &s;tate governments; we are per&s;uaded, that their up|right and faithful endeavours will be exerted to &s;ecure, and perpetuate the ble&s;&s;ings of peace, and liberty, and to promote the true intere&s;t of this people. While the mea&s;ures of rightou&s;ne&s;s are religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved
<PB N="37" REF="025963_0036_0FCFD8A1E8305C50">
in their admini&s;trations, we are &s;ure, they will be crown|ed with &s;ucce&s;s. For it is by righteou&s;ne&s;s, the throne of government is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the nation is exalted.</P>
<P>WE have the happine&s;s of &s;eeing once more, at the head of this Commonwealth, a Gentleman,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Excellency JOHN HANCOCK, E&s;q.</NOTE> of who&s;e abilities in the arduous and important &s;cience of go|vernment&mdash;of who&s;e patrioti&s;m and love of liberty&mdash;
of who&s;e integrity and upright intentions we have had long experience. That di&s;play of wi&s;dom, fortitude, and magnanimity, joined with the mo&s;t unremitting attention, and per&s;everance, manife&s;ted in the virtuous &s;truggle, to obtain and &s;ecure our independence, mu&s;t place his Excellency in the rank of tho&s;e great and worthy patriots, who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves as the defenders of the rights of mankind: And the many and eminent &s;ervices he has rendered to this Commonwealth, over which he has &s;o often, and &s;o long pre&s;ided; as well as his many publick and private virtues, add a lu&s;tre to his character. We &s;incerely lament, that the di&s;charge of the duties of his high, and important &s;tation, is rendered &s;o difficult and irk|&s;ome, by his Excellency's ill &s;tate of health, and the many bodily infirmities with which he has been long afflicted. May the benevolent Parent of the univer&s;e, who is the health of our countenance, and our GOD, remove the pains and di&s;orders, under which his Ex|cellency labours, re&s;tore and confirm his health, make the remainder of his days happy to him&s;elf, and u&s;eful to the Commonwealth, and finally reward all his &s;er|vices with eternal happine&s;s in his kingdom above.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="025963_0037_0FCFD8A3725C9018">THE patrioti&s;m, firmne&s;s, and inflexible attach|ment to the intere&s;t of his country, manife&s;ted by his Honor, the Lieutenant-Governor,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Honor SAMUEL ADAMS, E&s;q.</NOTE> through a long &s;eries of years, ju&s;tly entitle him to the &s;econd rank in government: And the great unanimity, with which his Excellency and Honor have, &s;o repeatedly, been elected to their re&s;pective honourable &s;tations, by the unbia&s;&s;ed &s;uffrages of their fellow-citizens, is the high|e&s;t atte&s;tation of their merit. To the gracious pro|tection of almighty GOD we commend them both; be&s;eeching him to grant them wi&s;dom from above; and grace to improve their di&s;tingui&s;hed talents, in pro|moting the true intere&s;t of this Commonwealth, and the United States.</P>
<P>THE Gentlemen, who compo&s;e the two branches of the General Court, have, many of them, the &s;atisfaction of reflecting, that their former &s;ervices have proved ac|ceptable to the multitude of their brethren, by their being re-elected into the important department of le|gi&s;lation. In filling up the few vacant &s;eats in the Se|nate, and in choo&s;ing an executive Council, for the en|&s;uing year, which is the fir&s;t object of their concern, they will not be influenced by per&s;onal or intere&s;ted views; but will elect &s;uch out of tho&s;e, who are the &s;ubjects of their choice, as are able men; &s;uch as fear GOD; men of truth, hating covetou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT has indeed been doubted by &s;ome, whether this rule &s;hould, in all ca&s;es, be &s;trictly adhered to; whether a man who is not of this de&s;cription, who is not a man of rigid probity; who does not appear to have the fear
<PB N="39" REF="025963_0038_0FCFD8A662B6A090">
of GOD before his eyes, and to be governed by a &s;acred regard to his laws, may not &s;till, in a political capacity, be entitled to great merit, and be a proper per&s;on to be concerned in guiding the helm of &s;tate. Long expe|rience in civil affairs, it is &s;aid&mdash;a &s;uperior knowledge of the laws&mdash;a facility of &s;peaking and of di&s;patching bu&s;i|ness&mdash;the di&s;covery of arts u&s;eful to government, are qualifications nece&s;&s;ary to promote the good of the &s;tate, which is the main end of all government.</P>
<P>PERHAPS we may allow of the exception, provided there is nothing in the per&s;onal character of &s;uch, from which the &s;tate may apprehend greater danger, or in|convenience, than it can expect good, from their ca|pacity to &s;erve it.</P>
<P>STILL it holds good, that men of probity,&mdash;of vir|tue,&mdash;of religion ought, in all well regulated &s;tates, to be the objects of the people's choice, both from the natural tendency of virtue to promote the happine&s;s of a nation, and from the influence of a good exam|ple; which has, in per&s;ons di&s;tingui&s;hed by the con|fidence of their brethren, a &s;en&s;ible and powerful in|fluence, towards rendering religion and virtue more generally e&s;teemed, and practi&s;ed. This con&s;ideration will have the greater weight, if we reflect, that (as we have &s;hewn) mo&s;t of the flouri&s;hing &s;tates in the world, have owed their origin and increa&s;e to virtue and righteou&s;ne&s;s; &s;o, as the manners of the people grew more di&s;&s;olute and corrupt, they gradually de|clined in power, in wealth, in credit.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="025963_0039_0FCFD8A7FB895540">IT would be going out of my proper &s;phere, and perhaps invading the province of the Chief Magi&s;trate, to enter into a detail of tho&s;e objects, which claim the attention of the General Court, in their pre&s;ent or fu|ture &s;e&s;&s;ions, in the cour&s;e of this year. Their own good &s;en&s;e, their political knowledge, and their per|fect acquaintance with the internal &s;tate of the Com|monwealth, will point out, and lead them to adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures, as pre&s;ent exigencies require.</P>
<P>OUR civil fathers, however, will permit me to re|mind them, that it is righteou&s;ne&s;s only which exalteth a nation; that it can never be good policy to tran&s;gre&s;s the &s;acred rules of ju&s;tice and fidelity; and, that the grand &s;ecret of political wi&s;dom is to maintain a &s;tea|dy and untainted integrity. They will, therefore, for the &s;upport of publick faith and honour, as well as do|me&s;tick tranquillity, pay the &s;tricte&s;t attention to com|mutative ju&s;tice and equity, by a faithful ob&s;ervance and fulfilment of all publick engagements; remem|bering that publick contracts are as binding, as pri|vate ones can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be; and ought to be di&s;|charged with the &s;ame good faith and punctuality; and that no nation can make the lea&s;t preten&s;ion to the character of a righteous one, that does not pay &s;acred regard to its promi&s;es and contracts.</P>
<P>THEY will maintain inviolate, by a &s;trict adherence to its original principles, our happy con&s;titution of government; and, for the purpo&s;es of national hap|pine&s;s and glory, they will &s;upport and &s;trengthen the federal government of the United States, by every

con&s;titutional means in their power; fully per&s;uaded that the continuance of our national government is e&s;&s;ential to our independence, our &s;afety, our very exi&s;tence as an empire.</P>
<P>OUR civil rulers, will think them&s;elves obliged, both in their publick and private &s;tations, to propagate a &s;pirit of indu&s;try, frugality, and &s;obriety, among all ranks of people; to encourage agriculture, commerce and arts; and to promote the intere&s;t of literature and &s;cience; from the &s;tronge&s;t conviction, that igno|rance and liberty are incompatible; that the former is the parent of de&s;poti&s;m, and the nur&s;e of &s;uper&s;tition. In fine, they will do all in their power, that wi&s;dom and knowledge may be the &s;tability of our times&mdash;that all vice and impiety be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and that the people may be allured to the practice of that righteou&s;ne&s;s, which exalteth a nation. In order to this, they will &s;hew, in their own per&s;ons, that they are not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, by paying all due regard to his &s;acred in&s;titutions, and obedience to his laws.</P>
<P>SENSIBLE of the difficulties of their ta&s;k, and of their need of divine aid and &s;upport, we commend them to him, who giveth wi&s;dom to the wi&s;e, and under&s;tanding to the prudent; be&s;eeching him to di|rect and pro&s;per all their con&s;ultations, to the advance|ment of his glory, the good of his church, the &s;afety, honour and welfare of the people of this Common|wealth, and of United America.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="025963_0041_0FCFD8AADF539F70">PERMIT me to conclude, by reminding this whole a&s;&s;embly, that it concerns every one to live in the practice of religion and virtue; not only as the publick pro&s;perity is deeply concerned in it, but as their own per&s;onal happine&s;s, both here and hereafter, ab&s;olutely depends upon it. Godline&s;s is profitable for all things, having the promi&s;e of this life, and of that which is to come. As therefore we wi&s;h the pro&s;perity of our country; as we wi&s;h to enjoy the comforts of the pre|&s;ent world; as we are anxious to meet the approbation of GOD, and to enjoy his favour in heaven; let us be|come the &s;incere di&s;ciples of JESUS CHRIST; let us follow peace with all men, and holine&s;s, without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.
