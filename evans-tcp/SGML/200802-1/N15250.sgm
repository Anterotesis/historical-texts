<P>THESE words contain a divine in&s;truction to the people of I&s;rael, re&s;pecting their &s;tate of pro&s;pe|rity in the promi&s;ed land. The in&s;truction is not typi|cal or merely local, but of a moral and univer&s;al nature. It may therefore with propriety, be applied to all peo|ple in every age, whenever they are in a pro&s;perous &s;tate. With &s;ingular propriety may it be applied to the people of the&s;e United States, who, after the &s;evere di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of unnatural war and civil di&s;cord, are now hap|py in the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and plenty. Let me then reque&s;t the indulgence of this very re&s;pectable auditory, while, in order to apply to our&s;elves the divine caution of our text, I endeavour,</P>
<P>I. To point out &s;ome of tho&s;e evils which, as a peo|ple
<PB N="6" REF="019359_0005_0FAB52550EF03418">
we have rea&s;on to fear in our pre&s;ent national pro&s;|perity.&mdash;And then,</P>
<P>II. To exhibit, in a very conci&s;e manner, that line of conduct which we ought to pur&s;ue, in order to &s;ecure through the divine favour the continuance of tho&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings which we now enjoy.</P>
<P>A political di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the&s;e points, it is per&s;umed will not be expected nor de&s;ired. It is propo&s;ed to con&s;ider them e&s;pecially in a moral and religious view. Indeed never &s;hould it be forgotten that all the mea|&s;ures of civil policy ought to be founded on the great principles of religion; or, at the lea&s;t, to be perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with them: otherwi&s;e they will never be e|&s;teemed, becau&s;e they will be contrary to that moral &s;en&s;e of right and wrong which God has implanted in the brea&s;t of every rational being. But to proceed,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us attend to &s;ome of tho&s;e evils which, as a peo|ple, we have rea&s;on e&s;pecially to fear in our pre&s;ent natio|nal pro&s;perity. That we have been and &s;till are greatly ble&s;&s;ed with national pro&s;perity, I conceive, will not be doubted. We have been often delivered in a mo&s;t &s;ig|nal manner, both from the &s;ecret &s;tratagems and the open a&s;&s;aults of our enemies. Great is the &s;alvation which heaven hath wrought for us in the full re&s;torati|on of the ble&s;&s;ings of peace. <HI>The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.</HI> He hath given us a very exten&s;ive country abounding with the riche&s;t gifts of nature. With &s;ufficient ea&s;e do we procure all the nece&s;&s;aries, together with mo&s;t of the conveniencies and delicacies of life. Could we procure them with more ea&s;e or in greater plenty, we &s;hould not be in &s;o de&s;i|rable a &s;ituation as we are now. A proper view of all our various ble&s;&s;ings will lead us to conclude that we are indeed the mo&s;t highly favoured people under hea|ven. <HI>God hath not dealt &s;o with any other nation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="019359_0006_0FAB525ED74D7828">
But &s;ecurity in happine&s;s is not the lot of humanity. This is equally true of all mankind, whether we con&s;i|der them as individuals or as united in &s;ociety. In the mid&s;t of all our pre&s;ent publick happine&s;s, dangers &s;ur|round us and evils hang over our heads.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t evil by which we are endangerd, and which indeed is the &s;ource of all others, is the want of true religion. It is true, the &s;uperior ble&s;&s;ings which we enjoy are well calculated to promote religion, to promote each of its e&s;&s;ential branches, piety and charity. And &s;uch affects would tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings naturally pro|duce, did we improve them as we ought. But through the perver&s;ene&s;s of our nature there is much danger that we &s;hall u&s;e them for very different purpo&s;es. When we are favoured with a profu&s;ion of earthly good, we are exceedingly prone to &s;et our hearts upon it with an immoderate affection, neglecting our bountiful Cre|ator from whom alone all good is derived. We bathe and bury our&s;elves in the &s;treams, forgetting the foun|tain whence they flow. This is indeed a very di&s;inge|nuous behaviour towards the Father of mercies. It cer|tainly di&s;covers a very &s;ordid di&s;po&s;ition, a depraved and contracted mind. Such a di&s;po&s;ition, however, is but too natural to man in his pre&s;ent degenerate &s;tate.</P>
<P>We are much more inclined to murmur at God's ju&s;|tice in adver&s;ity than to acknowledge his goodne&s;s in pro&s;perity; more ready to view God as the author of evil than as the author of good. In the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the late war, though they were mo&s;t evidently brought up|on us by the in&s;trumentality of men, we were never|thele&s;s much more ready to impute them to the hand of God, than we now are to acknowledge the &s;ame hand in the happine&s;s of peace, and the other rich ble&s;&s;ings of his providence and grace. When our wants are very pre&s;&s;ing, we are willing, or pretend to be willing to ap|ply
<PB N="8" REF="019359_0007_0FAB5262AA098920">
to God for relief. But no &s;ooner is the relief given than we &s;et our hearts upon the gift, and neglect the giver; or rather make u&s;e of his own bounty in order to &s;ight again&s;t him. The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e we are more inclined to love the creature than the Creator, to be <HI>lovers of plea&s;ure rather than lovers of God.</HI> On this account, Mo&s;es with peculiar empha&s;is warns the I&s;raelites to &s;tand on their guard again&s;t &s;uch impiety in the days of their pro&s;perity: <HI>Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God.</HI></P>
<P>If we now attend to matters of fact we &s;hall find no rea&s;on to think more lightly of the dangers before us. The hi&s;tory of the I&s;raelites &s;hews us that they greatly needed the caution which Mo&s;es gave them. Scarcely a pro&s;perous period in their hi&s;tory can be pointed out which was not followed by a decay of piety, and a cor|ruption of morals. This was the ca&s;e &s;oon after their happy &s;ettlement in the land of Can&auml;an. This was the ca&s;e very frequently in the times of their Judges and Kings. And this was eminently the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to their highe&s;t &s;tate of wealth and power under the reign of Solomon. The very great pro&s;perity of this happy reign produced very unhappy effects, even upon that wi&s;e king, as well as upon his court, and his &s;ub|jects. The profligacy of his court may be &s;een in the hi&s;tory of his life: and that the moral &s;tate of his &s;ub|jects was al&s;o exceedingly corrupt, appears from their conduct immediately after his death. Even in the good reign of the pious Hezekiah, ingratitude and irreligion were the con&s;equences of &s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;perity. <HI>He|zekiah rendered not according to the benefit done unto him: for his heart was lifted up; therefore there was wrath upon him, and npon Judah and Jeru&s;alem.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. xxxii. 25.</NOTE> The character of I&s;rael, as drawn in the &s;pirit of prophe&s;y

by Mo&s;es may, with the utmo&s;t propriety, be applied to them in every &s;tage of their pro&s;perity. <HI>They have cor|rupted them&s;elves, their &s;pot is not the &s;pot of his children: they are a perver&s;e and crooked generation. Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fooli&s;h people and unwi&s;e? is he not thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee and e&s;tabli&s;hed thee? But Je&s;hurun waxed fat and kick|ed, thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatne&s;s; then he for&s;ook God which made him, and lightly e&s;teemed the rock of his &s;alvation. They provoked him to jealou&s;y with &s;trange gods, with abomi|nations provoked they him to anger.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii. 5, 6, 15, 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>Nor was this pernicious effect of abu&s;ed pro&s;perity peculiar to the people of I&s;rael. It has, in one degree or another, been common to all people in every age of the world. It has been the ca&s;e even with the Chri&s;ti|an Church. The con&s;equences of outward pro&s;perity have been often more fatal to the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e than tho&s;e of adver&s;ity. Indeed the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and per&s;ecuti|ons of the Church have often produced a very happy effect in the advancement of true Chri&s;tianity. Hence that ob&s;ervation in primitive times: "<HI>The blood of the Martyrs is the &s;eed of the Church.</HI>" But the like happy effect has &s;eldom if ever followed from a &s;tate of exter|nal peace and opulence. The fir&s;t great in&s;tance of &s;ig|nal pro&s;perity granted to the Chri&s;tians in the begin|ning of the fourth Century under Con&s;tantine the great, was &s;oon followed by a great lo&s;s of fervent piety, and a &s;ad corruption both of doctrines and morals. And the &s;ame &s;ad effect has followed from many in&s;tances of their pro&s;perity in &s;ucceeding ages; particularly from the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of many prote&s;tant Churches &s;ince the grand emancipation from the Papal See. Indeed wealth and power have been and &s;till are the great &s;up|porters
<PB N="10" REF="019359_0009_0FAB526419315358">
of that <HI>man of &s;in who oppo&s;eth and exalteth him|&s;elf above all that is called God, or that is wor&s;hipped.</HI></P>
<P>Wealth, with its common attendants, idlene&s;s and plea&s;ure, were the ruin of Sodom and Gomorrah. Be|hold, this was the iniquity of Sodom, pride, fulne&s;s of bread, and abundance of idlene&s;s was in her and in her daughters."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xvi. 49.</NOTE> The&s;e &s;ame things were the ruin of mighty Babylon. "<HI>Thou that art given to plea&s;ures,</HI> &s;aid the prophet, <HI>that dwelle&s;t carele&s;sly, that &s;aye&s;t in thine heart, I am, and none el&s;e be&s;ides me.</HI>"<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xlvii. 8.</NOTE> In what a &s;triking manner were the&s;e words verified in the day of her fall! The &s;ame things brought de&s;truction upon each of the four great monarchies, and upon mo&s;t of the other &s;tates and kingdoms which have fallen, one after another in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages of time. And the very &s;ame things have proved ruinous to individuals with|out number. Surely we have no rea&s;on to <HI>call the proud, happy,</HI> or to look with a covetous eye upon the glare of earthly greatne&s;s. Mi&s;ery lies hid beneath it, and de&s;truction is its u&s;ual attendant.</P>
<P>Since then a pro&s;perous &s;tate has been &s;o often fol|lowed with &s;uch an effect both on public communities, and on individuals, have we not rea&s;on to fear a &s;imilar effect from our national pro&s;perity at the pre&s;ent day? Is it not a &s;ad truth, that &s;ince the commencement of the late war, and e&s;pecially &s;ince the re&s;toration of peace, the holy religion of Je&s;us, that brighte&s;t orna|ment of our world, is, by many le&s;s regarded than it was before? and are not the &s;acred in&s;titutions of the Go&s;pel more neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed? Are not the friends of Chri&s;tianity treated with more di&s;regard? Are not infidelity and profligacy of manners, viewed with le&s;s concern, and by many con&s;idered as matters of trivial con&s;equence? Still, we ought with the highe&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="019359_0010_0FAB5264D6D86F38">
gratitude to acknowledge the &s;overeign grace of Al|mighty God, which has, in &s;ome places, been manife&s;ted in the &s;upport of his own cau&s;e. In &s;everal of our States he has been plea&s;ed to excite in the minds of many individuals, here and there, an unu&s;ual attention to di|vine and eternal things. He &s;aw us unpurified by the furnace of affliction: He &s;aw us di&s;regarding him while he &s;pake to us in the <HI>whirlwind,</HI> the <HI>earthquake,</HI> and the <HI>fire.</HI> Yet has he been plea&s;ed to &s;peak to us not only by the &s;till voice of peace after war, but al&s;o by the omnipo|tent voice of his holy Spirit; inviting us to become the &s;ubjects of the Prince of peace, and making numbers in one place and another, as we tru&s;t, the actual po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors of that peace which the world can neither give nor take away. To his great name be all the glory a&s;crib|ed.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding &s;ome plea&s;ing appearances of true religion, in &s;everal places, we have too much rea&s;on to fear that "<HI>The unthinking many</HI>" are abu&s;ing our pre&s;ent pro&s;perity in &s;uch a manner as to produce a very dif|ferent effect. We have rea&s;on to fear that they are fa&s;t growing into that &s;tate of irreligion which has been no|ticed already. The &s;ymptoms and effects of this evil are already too manife&s;t; and will probably continue and increa&s;e <HI>unto more ungodline&s;s,</HI> unle&s;s vigorous mea|&s;ures be taken to prevent them. Some few of the&s;e evils which may be called &s;ymptoms and effects of ir|religion I beg leave particularly to mention.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, One of them which we have much rea&s;on to lament and fear, is ingratitude, vile ingrati|tude both to God and to man. During the troubles of the late war, how ardently did we wi&s;h for peace? While our lives and liberties were endangered; while our very exi&s;tence as a nation, was in doubt; while we were threatened with all the horrors of a cru&s;hed rebel|lion
<PB N="12" REF="019359_0011_0FAB52659AAB50F8">
and all the vengeance of a very potent enemy peculiarly incen&s;ed again&s;t us; how eagerly did we long after that independence, that e&s;tabli&s;hed liberty and national happine&s;s which we now enjoy? We then &s;aw and felt our need of help from God. While the horrid conte&s;t was long doubtful, we acknowledged that the i&s;&s;ue mu&s;t be determined by the &s;overeign di&s;|po&s;er of events. At &s;ome periods victory and &s;ucce&s;s were &s;o greatly in favour of our enemies, and our own affairs were, in many re&s;pects, &s;o exceedingly embar|ra&s;&s;ed, that the &s;toute&s;t hearts were almo&s;t ready to fail. At &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons there &s;eemed to be no way left but <HI>To &s;tand &s;till and &s;ee the &s;alvation of the Lord.</HI> This &s;alvation we &s;ought of him; nor did we &s;eek in vain. His own arm brought &s;alvation. By a &s;eries of the mo&s;t vi&s;ible interpo&s;itions of his providence, he has made wars to cea&s;e thro' the land, and ble&s;t us with all that our hearts de&s;ired.</P>
<P>But alas! what poor returns have we made to our great Deliverer! Witne&s;s our cold hearts and our irre|ligious lives. How much le&s;s inclined are we to re|turn him &s;incere thanks for the&s;e favours now, than we were to a&s;k them of him in the times of our di&s;tre&s;s? How &s;mall are the emotions of gratitude in our hearts, towards the God of all our &s;alvations! And what little honour do we bring to his name by our lives and con|ver&s;ation! With too much propriety may we apply to our&s;elves the&s;e words of the P&s;almi&s;t: <HI>When he &s;lew them, they &s;ought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their Redeemer. Never|thele&s;s they did flatter him with their mouth and they lied unto him with their tongues. For their heart was not right with him, neither were they &s;tedfa&s;t in his co|venant.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm: 8. 34&mdash;37.</NOTE></P>

Nor have we been guilty of ingratitude towards God only; we have been guilty of the &s;ame evil to|wards man. Although this be a le&s;s evil than the former, it is neverthele&s;s an evil which we ought to condemn and reform. We are certainly under great obligations to tho&s;e who have voluntarily taken an ha|zardous or an expen&s;ive part, in effecting our late happy revolution. They have been, under God, the Saviours of our country. They have been in&s;trumental in ef|fecting one of the mo&s;t happy and intere&s;ting events which have taken place in the pre&s;ent age, or in any other. Their merit is certainly great. Yet after all, are they not too much in the &s;ituation of the <HI>poor wi&s;e man,</HI> mentioned in &s;acred writ, who by his wi&s;dom de|livered from impending danger, the city in which he dwelt, but was neverthele&s;s &s;oon univer&s;ally forgotton? Do we give them that prai&s;e, that re&s;pect, that reward to which they have a ju&s;t claim? That we have not yet afforded that reward which they ju&s;tly claim, can|not be denied. This thought leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. That another particular evil into which we have fallen, and by which we are much endangered, is in|ju&s;tice, inju&s;tice to the be&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;erving friends of our country. Tho&s;e are certainly to be e&s;teemed &s;ome of the mo&s;t de&s;erving friends of the country, who have willingly lent her either their lives or their pro|perty in the late important &s;truggle. To &s;uch per&s;ons we are under obligations not only of gratitude but of ju&s;tice. Their voluntary &s;acrifices have, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, purcha&s;ed for us our lives and fortunes, our liberties, our independence, our peace, and in a great mea&s;ure, all our temporal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Whether all who thus &s;erved their country acted wholly from di&s;intere&s;ted views, is a que&s;tion which we ought not to a&s;k them, and which, with honour, we
<PB N="14" REF="019359_0013_0FAB52671AD268C8">
cannot a&s;k. That many of them acted from the mo&s;t generous and patriotic motives, cannot be doubted by a candid mind. The lea&s;t that we can do for them, ac|cording to &s;trict ju&s;tice, is to afford them a reward e|qual to the full import of our promi&s;es. This, how|ever, with regret be it &s;poken, has not been done. But in lieu of this, many who have generou&s;ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> their property to the country in the &s;ea&s;on of her mo&s;t pre&s;|&s;ing want and danger, have for a long time been una|ble to obtain a &s;ingle farthing either of the principle or of the intere&s;t, though both have been long ju&s;tly due.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the above was written, the author is happy to find that provi&s;ion has been lately made for the payment of &s;ome part of the intere&s;t of our national debt, to which debt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> And whenever any payments of annuities have been attempted, they have been generally, if not univer&s;ally made in a depreciating medium which immediately anni|hilated in their hands a very con&s;iderable part of its nominal value. In a &s;imilar way have we effected mo&s;t of the payments which have been made to our armies. Indeed as to mo&s;t of our public &s;ecurities, there has uni|formly been a wide difference between their real and their nominal value. This is a difference which never ought to have exi&s;ted: a difference manife&s;tly contrary to the nature and claims of ju&s;tice and truth. And af|ter all, the faithful Soldier who has in the face of the greate&s;t di&s;couragements and dangers per&s;evered in the &s;ervice of his country to the clo&s;e of the war, receives a very con&s;iderable part of his pay in a paper medium which he is obliged to &s;ell or barter for one eighth part of its nominal value, one half quarter only of the value for which he receives it.</P>
<P>Gladly would I draw a veil over this part of our na|tional conduct, were it po&s;&s;ible, and could it be done with propriety. But it cannot be done, it ought not to be attempted. The be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t thing which we

can now do with regard to this matter, is, to reprobate our own conduct and reform it for the future. Let us not pretend any longer to excu&s;e our&s;elves by promi&s;|ing and promi&s;ing that we will do ju&s;tice to our credi|tors at &s;ome di&s;tant period of time. Such promi&s;es are ea&s;ily made and commonly of little worth. Nor do they by any means an&s;wer the demands of ju&s;tice pro|vided they &s;hould be hereafter fulfilled. For ju&s;tice requires punctuality with re&s;pect to the time of pay|ment as really as with re&s;pect to the &s;um which is due. A failure in the former of the&s;e points, is often more pernicious than in the latter. Let us no longer plead in ability in our own vindication. I hope indeed this plea may be made in vindication of &s;ome of our pa&s;t defi|ciences, but I fear it can by no means ju&s;tify them all. It is, at be&s;t, but a very di&s;honourable plea becau&s;e it is &s;o often u&s;ed merely as a ma&s;k for inju&s;tice, and always can be u&s;ed in one &s;hape or another by tho&s;e who are unwilling to pay their debts.&mdash;As a people, we are not poor, but rich, and have large re&s;ources of public reve|nue. If we are but willing to do ju&s;tice, and do not needle&s;sly embarra&s;s the hands of government, we &s;hall be under no nece&s;&s;ity of defrauding or injuring our creditors. If we cannot immediately pay them the principle of our debt, we can, at lea&s;t, pay the intere&s;t, and thereby at once place our credit on a more re&s;pect|able footing.</P>
<P>Britain, loaded with a bebt more than thirty times &s;o large as ours, and carrying an annual intere&s;t larger than our whole debt, neverthele&s;s pays the intere&s;t punc|tually, maintains her credit, and can borrow money from her &s;ubjects at plea&s;ure. At the &s;ame time her civil li&s;t and other annual expences are far greater than ours even in proportion to her wealth, and perhaps grea|ter almo&s;t in the &s;ame proportion with her national debt.

<P>Our public inju&s;tice is attended with con&s;equences mo&s;t deplorable and alarming.

It gives too much countenance to the reproach of our enemies who have &s;tigmatized us with the character of a knavi&s;h, faithle&s;s people; covering the mo&s;t iniquitous de&s;igns under the garb of liberty and the cloak of religion. It is hurtful to many literary and religious in&s;titutions; while the monies which were charitably given for their &s;upport are detained and perverted to a very different purpo&s;e. It is attended with great cruelty towards widows and orphans, towards the poor and needy, and many other individuals who have &s;uffered extremely for the want of tho&s;e monies which are their ju&s;t due, and to which they have an indi&s;putable claim.</P>
<P>The cries of &s;uch per&s;ons <HI>enter into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.</HI> Is not this unju&s;t detention of pro|perty, in a particular manner attended with cruelty to the generous Soldier, who has nobly braved fatigues, and dangers, and deaths, for our &s;ake, who has faithfully adhered to our cau&s;e while thou&s;ands de&s;erted it, while thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands of his brethren peri&s;hed around him by the horrors of &s;ickne&s;s and the &s;word, and the far greater horrors of Briti&s;h pri&s;on-&s;hips, and

<P>This public inju&s;tice de&s;troys &s;ome of the mo&s;t im|portant ends of civil &s;ociety; &s;uch as an equal admini&s;|tration of ju&s;tice, and the &s;ecurity of property. It in|volves us in &s;ome of the wor&s;t evils of tyranny and de&s;poti&s;m, while we are flattering our&s;elves with the plea&s;ing names of liberty and independence. It tends to de&s;troy all confidence in the Public, and to create a di&s;tru&s;t of Government. For if &s;uch a flagrant violati|on of ju&s;tice may be practi&s;ed in one in&s;tance, how do we know but the like may be practi&s;ed in many in&s;tan|ces; or what one right have we which is properly &s;e|cured? If the Public, as a body, will allow them&s;elves, in any one in&s;tance, to injure an individual, every mem|ber of the Public is in con&s;tant danger. For who can tell where the injury will fall next? If one part of our property may be detained from us for a long time, con|trary to the plaine&s;t promi&s;es, without our con&s;ent and without any unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity; how can we know but that another part may be &s;oon as unju&s;tly wre&s;ted from us in the very fir&s;t in&s;tance? In either ca&s;e the inju&s;tice is equally real and equally manife&s;t: and which would be the greater evil of the two, can be determined only by concurrent circum&s;tances. If our property mu&s;t be taken or detained without our con&s;ent, what great choice is there as to the mode, whether it be taken by fraud or by force, whether we be robbed by an highwayman or cheated by a knave? In this latter ca&s;e we have often the long pain of repeated di&s;appointments, which does not take place in the former.</P>
<P>Further, is it certain that Government will never a|gain

want the voluntary aid of individuals, aid which &s;he cannot compel them to yield? Should &s;he be a|gain in &s;uch a &s;ituation what encouragement would in|dividuals have to afford the needed aid? Will they not be ready to fear that all State-policy is founded merely on Machiavelian principles, and that public bodies will practi&s;e fraud in order to accompli&s;h their own ends, whenever they can do it with impunity?&mdash;Hone&s;t minds hope that &s;uch fears are groundle&s;s, and that &s;ome public Communities at lea&s;t, as well as &s;ome individuals, mean to make ju&s;tice a rule of conduct. If this be the ca&s;e, let us make it manife&s;t by our own con|duct; if it be not the ca&s;e, let the truth be known, that faithful citizens and hone&s;t men may be no longer de|ceived and duped out of their property. <HI>Heu pietas, heu publica fides!</HI></P>
<P>But the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equence of our public inju&s;tice is &s;till to be mentioned. It has a fatal influ|ence upon the morals of the people at large. It is like the &s;in of Jereboam the &s;on of Nebat; it makes I&s;rael to &s;in, and thereby &s;till further provokes the Lord God of I&s;rael to anger. It is a trite ob&s;ervation and a very ju&s;t one, That example has more influence than pre|cept. And if our public conduct may be adduced by knaves and &s;harpers, as an example and pretext of in|ju&s;tice, will it not have a greater tendency to promote this evil than all our laws will have to prevent it? Too many are there of that &s;mooth-&s;peaking cla&s;s of people, who mean to get their living out of others; who, whenever they can run into debt, con&s;ider it as &s;o much clear gain; becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, they can make ample payment by fair promi&s;es and &s;oft words, by complaints of the &s;carcity of money and the hardne&s;s of the times. Better payment than this they do not wi&s;h to make: <HI>The words of their mouths are &s;moother than butter, but

war is in their heart: Their words are &s;ofter than oil, yet are they drawn &s;words.</HI> To our reproach and our &s;hame, we are already too much inclined to di&s;hone&s;ty. It is already practi&s;ed by too much many to the detriment of the Public, and to the ruin of their own true intere&s;t both temporal and eternal. Too many motives are there already to this accur&s;ed evil, too many are its friends and votaries. For Gods &s;ake let it not have any more. Many even of our religious &s;ocieties have long conducted as if they thought it no evil to violate the mo&s;t explicit and &s;olemn covenants with the mini&s;|ters of religion by withholding from them the &s;tipulated &s;upport. If the religious &s;carcely e&s;cape this evil, what may be expected from the ungodly and profane? <HI>There is,</HI> however, <HI>a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not wa&s;hed from their filthine&s;s.</HI> Let this wi&s;e maxim be remembered by us all, and particu|larly by tho&s;e very religious people who make high pro|fe&s;&s;ions of Chri&s;tianity, and yet at the &s;ame time bid defiance to the plaine&s;t rules of ju&s;tice, and trample un|der foot the mo&s;t &s;acred obligations of truth and plight|ed faith.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another particular evil by which we are endan|gered, is the want of true patrioti&s;m. By true patrio|ti&s;m I mean a real concern for the welfare of our whole country in general. This patrioti&s;m is a branch of that exten&s;ive benevolence which is highly recommended by our holy religion, and is at the &s;ame time mo&s;t evident|ly con&s;entaneous to the dictates of &s;ound rea&s;on. Ge|nuine patrioti&s;m of the be&s;t kind, is peculiar to tho&s;e only who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a principle of true virtue. Some &s;emblances and imitations of this patrioti&s;m are neverthele&s;s to be found in tho&s;e who are not, on the whole, of a truly virtuous character. Yet even the&s;e imitations of pure patrioti&s;m have often proved very beneficial in civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="019359_0019_0FAB5270EB5C7AA8">
While the war la&s;ted our patrioti&s;m was eminent and produced the mo&s;t happy effects. Common dang|er was a common bond of union, cementing us toge|ther. But as this bond has now in &s;ome mea&s;ure cea|&s;ed, there is danger that our union will not be &s;o great as will be nece&s;&s;ary for the general good. There is danger not only that factions will ari&s;e in particular States, but that particular States will attempt to pur&s;ue their own particular intere&s;ts without a due regard to the common good, and perhaps in direct oppo&s;ition to it. But we &s;hould remember that the&s;e States are, by voluntary and &s;olemn agreement united as one nation, one body, of which each particular State is a member. <HI>And the eye cannot &s;ay unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you: but the members &s;hould have the &s;ame care one for another.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 12. 21, and 25.</NOTE> It will doubtle&s;s be nece&s;&s;ary not only that individual per&s;ons, but al&s;o particular States &s;hould of|ten give up, in many ca&s;es, their own particular intere&s;t for the common benefit. To do thus is generous, is wi&s;e, is nece&s;&s;ary for our exi&s;tence as a free and indepen|dent people. Some generous examples of this kind have been given, and it is to be hoped they will be uni|ver&s;ally followed. If we are unwilling to act on this liberal &s;cale we &s;hall be in perpetual danger of that evil which our Saviour points out when he tells us, "<HI>That every kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf cannot &s;tand. but is brought to de&s;olation.</HI>"</P>
<P>It was the want of this exten&s;ive patrioti&s;m that ru|ined the States of Greece. A party &s;pirit, a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y and di&s;cord prevailed among them, and divi&s;i|ons and wars expo&s;ed them for a long time to the in|va&s;ions of the Per&s;ian Empire, and finally &s;ubjugated them all to the Macedonian yoke.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="019359_0020_0FAB5271A039CD38">
If the &s;ame &s;pirit prevail among us we have no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e but it will produce the mo&s;t unhappy con&s;e|quences. Human nature is the &s;ame in every age, and &s;imilar cau&s;es will produce &s;imilar effects. In this view we may &s;ee how much it concerns us to &s;upport our grand bond of union, or, in other words; to main|tain the rights of our honourable Congre&s;s, and even to enlarge their powers, &s;hould this be proved nece&s;&s;a|ry for the general good.&mdash;</P>
<P>That want of patrioti&s;m, of which we &s;peak, produ|ces very different effects in per&s;ons who are in different &s;ituations of life. It is nearly the &s;ame thing with &s;elf|i&s;hne&s;s. It often leads the ambitious and a&s;piring to &s;eek their own promotion by very improper means. It leads them into a mad pur&s;uit of low popularity, to the violation of honour and hone&s;ty and to the neglect of the public good. For not the&s;e things, but popular applau&s;e and their own advancement in office are the objects of their fir&s;t concern. And they &s;ometimes have their reward: but a very contemptible one it is. True popularity or the real e&s;teem of the virtuous and the wi&s;e, procured by a &s;teady cour&s;e of benevolent and virtuous conduct, is well worthy of pur&s;uit and is indeed the greate&s;t earthly good that we can enjoy. This po|pularity is not procured by time-&s;erving, by flattery or any improper compliances. It is &s;eldom if ever gained without a manly oppo&s;ition, in &s;ome ca&s;es at lea&s;t, to popular prejudice and vulgar error The man who can make it appear that he con&s;cienciou&s;ly acts from a vir|tuous principle will command the veneration even of the mo&s;t unprincipled, and of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e him. But the fame of the popular drudge, that fame which is gained by low arts of deceiving the ignorant and a|bu&s;ing their prejudices, to the public detriment, is not only unworthy of a Chri&s;tian, but beneath the character of an hone&s;t man.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="019359_0021_0FAB52725B00F6C0">
This &s;ame &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit, when it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the minds, of the common people, has this bad con&s;equence, a|mong many others, that it &s;ubjects them to an undue in|fluence in the choice of civil rulers. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this &s;pirit, they will not regard the probity or abilities of the candidates for office; but will be very ready to give their voice for tho&s;e to whom they happen to be parti|cularly attached by any private and &s;ini&s;ter motives; for tho&s;e by whom they are mo&s;t humoured in their pre|judices and follies; and e&s;pecially for tho&s;e who mo&s;t loudly exclaim again&s;t the payment of public debts and mo&s;t vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;e taxation however ju&s;t or nece&s;|&s;ary. All &s;uch operations of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, whether in po|pular demagogues or in the people at large, in whate|ver &s;hape they appear, tend ultimately to the public de|triment and to the encouragement of deceit and di&s;ho|ne&s;ty.</P>
<P N="4">4. A fourth evil by which we are threatened is a di&s;|regard of civil Authority. Great is our privilege in choo&s;ing our own rulers, and, by them, of making and executing our own laws. But this privilege we are in great danger of abu&s;ing, for this &s;trange rea&s;on, becau&s;e it is the effect of our own voluntary act. While the peo|ple at large are too ready to yield to this temptation, even rulers them&s;elves are in danger of relaxing too far the reigns of government, thro' fear of di&s;plea&s;ing the people by whom they are cho&s;en to office. But cer|tain it is that no State can be long happy or even an|&s;wer the mo&s;t important ends of civil &s;ociety, unle&s;s go|vernment be revered and the law obeyed. Tyranny and de&s;poti&s;m are undoubtedly very great evils, but greater &s;till are the dangers of anarchy.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e per&s;ons who have the mo&s;t power in their own hands are in the greate&s;t danger of abu&s;ing it. No people on earth have &s;o much power in their own hands
<PB N="23" REF="019359_0022_0FAB52731D0BAB40">
as tho&s;e of the United States. All the powers of go|vernment are at their di&s;po&s;al. We ought therefore to be much on our guard again&s;t the abu&s;e of this power. The abu&s;e of this power may perhaps produce tyranny or ari&s;tocracy; but the proper u&s;e of it will be the be&s;t way to prevent them both. Never let us forget that the dignity of government and the energy of the law, are e&s;&s;ential to the continuance of our public happine&s;s and pro&s;perity. Rea&s;on and experience teach us this le&s;&s;on, while the more &s;pecial voice of God enforces the &s;ame, by commanding <HI>every &s;oul to be &s;ubject to the higher powers.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 13. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">5. I will only add once more, in the fifth place, that we are in much danger of the evils which ari&s;e from luxury and extravagance in our expences. After all that has been &s;aid in favour of foreign trade and fo|reign luxuries, it &s;till remains a demon&s;tration in poli|tics, that when our imports exceed our exports, the cour&s;e of trade is again&s;t us, and we are con&s;tantly growing poor. This, it is to be feared, is our &s;tate at the pre|&s;ent, e&s;pecially on account of tho&s;e very extravagant importations which we have made &s;ince the peace. Our very great con&s;umption of foreign luxuries not only impoveri&s;hes the country to an high degree, but at the &s;ame time, tends directly to enervate both our bodies and our minds, to produce indolence and pride, and to open the door to every temptation and every vice. In this ca&s;e, as well as many others, experience is a faithful teacher. And if we con&s;ult the experience of mankind in every age, and in every part of the world, we &s;hall not find a &s;ingle in&s;tance wherein luxury and extravagance have &s;ub&s;erved the true intere&s;t of a peo|ple. But in&s;tances in which they have proved hurtful and ruinous are to be found in abundance. And to
<PB N="24" REF="019359_0023_0FAB5273D425C6A0">
Republican governments they have proved more fatal than to others. By cultivating indu&s;try, frugality, and a patriotic &s;pirit, Rome extended her conque&s;ts where|ever &s;he plea&s;ed, and was revered as the Arbitre&s;s of kings and the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the world. But by adopting the luxuries of A&s;ia where her arms had proved victo|rious, &s;he &s;oon enfeebled her true Republican &s;pirit and prepared the way for her own ruin. Let not the &s;ame &s;cene be again acted over in America. America has by her noble exertions repelled the force of Britain. But if America per&s;i&s;ts in her pre&s;ent rage after Briti&s;h gew|gaws and foreign luxuries, &s;he mu&s;t expect the fate of Rome, her ancient predece&s;&s;or; or at lea&s;t, that very unhappy con&s;equences will en&s;ue. To prevent the&s;e impending evils we need the exertions not only of the &s;ons, but al&s;o of the daughters of America. Very great are your influence and importance, my fair hearers, in this re&s;pect, as well as in many others. Be a&s;&s;ured that oeconomy and frugality with an elegance of dre&s;s, on the plan of that mode&s;t apparel recommended by St. Peter, would add more grace to your charms and more dignity to your characters than all the tin&s;el of Briti&s;h ornament, or the greate&s;t extravagance of foreign dre&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P>II. It now remains that we exhibit, in a very con|ci&s;e manner that line of conduct which we ought to pur&s;ue in order to &s;ecure, through the divine favour, the continuence of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which at the pre&s;ent we enjoy.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is, I conceive, &s;ufficiently evi|dent that we ought mo&s;t earne&s;tly to endeavour after a reformation of tho&s;e particular evils aforementioned, and at the &s;ame time, to u&s;e the be&s;t means in order to prevent them for the future. We mu&s;t fir&s;t <HI>cea&s;e to do evil</HI> or we &s;hall never <HI>learn to do well.</HI></P>

In the &s;econd place we mu&s;t u&s;e our be&s;t endeavours to promote the practice of virtue and true religion.</P>
<P>I will not indeed pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert, that God's con|duct towards nations under the go&s;pel, is exactly paral|lel to his conduct towards the ancient I&s;raelites. They were under a di&s;pen&s;ation of grace different from ours, and, for a long time under that peculiar kind of civil government which has been called <HI>a Theocracy.</HI> Nati|onal ble&s;&s;ings are not promi&s;ed, and national judge|ments are not threatened under the go&s;pel in like man|ner as they were under the law. The go&s;pel being a more &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation, its ble&s;&s;ings and its cur&s;es are of a more &s;piritual nature, and le&s;s obvious to the view of the world. They are de&s;igned, in a &s;pecial manner, to prepare per&s;ons for the more full retributi|ons of eternity. This we know is the ca&s;e with regard to the ble&s;&s;ings conferred, and the cha&s;ti&s;ements in|flicted on the children of God. And that this is al&s;o the ca&s;e with regard to the judgements inflicted on the man of &s;in and his followers, we are expre&s;sly told: <HI>God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ion, that they &s;hould be|lieve a lie: that they all might be damned.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;. 2. 11, 12.</NOTE> Still, this is certain, that by the con&s;titution of nature which God has e&s;tabli&s;hed, vice tends to the mi&s;ery, and virtue to the happine&s;s not only of individuals, but of public Communities. The practice of religion mu&s;t therefore be con&s;idered as ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to the be&s;t &s;tate of public pro&s;perity, it mu&s;t be &s;o unle&s;s we may expect happine&s;s in direct oppo&s;ition to the con&s;titution of na|ture and of nature's God.

proper means, to pray fervently for the effu&s;ions of the divine Spirit.</P>
<P>Without a divine and &s;upernatural influence, true religion will never prevail. This is a doctrine clearly taught in divine revelation and perfectly con&s;onant to the dictates of rea&s;on. It has been taught even by heathen Philo&s;ophers, &s;uch as Socrates and Plato, Ci|cero and Seneca. It has been acknowledged, in one &s;hape or another, in every nation and in every age. In|deed it may be con&s;idered as a doctrine of natural reli|gion. Nor is there any thing enthu&s;ia&s;tical or unrea|&s;onable in this doctrine, any more than there is in that other great doctrine of natural religion "<HI>That in God we live and move and have our being.</HI>" Divine influ|ence is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary both in the natural and in the moral world. All creatures of every kind, from the mo&s;t exalted Seraph before the eternal throne, to the &s;malle&s;t animal which e&s;capes our &s;ight, are wholly dependent on God. Our &s;ouls and all their powers are in his hand, and he can form and incline them at his plea&s;ure, in full con&s;i&s;tency with our mo&s;t perfect free|dom of action.</P>
<P>That divine influence which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to a pious life we are taught to expect from the operations of the third per&s;on in the holy Trinity. We cannot therefore do a more faithful or important &s;ervice for our country than to pray fervently and per&s;everingly to the Father of mercies, that he would by the energy of the Holy-Gho&s;t, form the hearts of this people to an ho|ly life, and thus "<HI>Purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</HI>"<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the review of our &s;ubject, I think we may ju&s;tly make this reflection: Let us not flatter our&s;elves too

much with an idea of the future pro&s;perity and glory of the&s;e United States.</P>
<P>While we thus flatter our&s;elves, we are in danger of expecting the end without a proper attention to tho&s;e means which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to obtain it. Young States are like young men; exceedingly apt, in imagination, to anticipate and magnify future &s;cenes of happine&s;s and grandeur, which perhaps they will never enjoy. It has lately become very fa&s;hionable to prophe&s;y about the future greatne&s;s of this country; its a&s;toni&s;hing progre&s;s in &s;cience, in wealth, in population and grandeur: to tell of <HI>Lockes</HI> and <HI>Newtons,</HI> of poets, philo&s;ophers and divines greater than have ever yet lived; of towering &s;pires, and &s;pacious domes, of po|pulous towns and cities ri&s;ing thick throughout an em|pire greater than the world has ever &s;een. Such repre|&s;entations may perhaps be beautiful in poetry and de|clamation, but cannot with equal propriety be admit|ted, in an unqualified &s;en&s;e, into &s;erious and didactic pro&s;e. And true indeed it is, Providence has here laid a foundation for a very flouri&s;hing and mighty empire. But although the foundation is laid, the &s;uper&s;tructure is not yet fini&s;hed, nor ever will be, unle&s;s we u&s;e the proper means. And whether we &s;hall u&s;e &s;uch means or not, is a matter of very great uncertainty. Foudati|ons for happine&s;s have been often laid where happine&s;s has never followed This is no le&s;s true of States and Kingdoms than of individual per&s;ons. It is remarkable that many places which were in ancient times, the &s;eats of mighty States aud empires, and might perhaps have continued with increa&s;ing greatne&s;s to the pre&s;ent time, had proper means been u&s;ed, are neverthele&s;s now co|vered with ruin and de&s;olation, or at be&s;t, in a very de|pre&s;&s;ed and mi&s;erable condition. What is become of Nineveh and Babylon, and tho&s;e mighty Empires of
<PB N="28" REF="019359_0027_0FAB528C51FB7848">
which they were the capital cities? What is become of Per&s;epolis, of Antioch, of Jeru&s;alem, of Carthage, of Athens and Sparta? And how wide is the difference between ancient and modern Rome? Had the inha|bitants of &s;uch places, from age to age, known the things of their peace and pur&s;ued them, their glory might have remained to the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>If we abu&s;e the &s;ignal favours which God has grant|ed us, we have no right to expect that he will favour us in the like manner for the future. Although it be po&s;|&s;ible we may be a flouri&s;hing and happy people, it is equally po&s;&s;ible we may be far otherwi&s;e. When we have reached the pinnacle of our hopes, it is often connected with evils far greater than the lo&s;s of that envied height would have been. <HI>The fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;&s;eth away.</HI> The greate&s;t worldly good is often &s;ucceeded by the greate&s;t evil; the greate&s;t happine&s;s by the greate&s;t mi&s;ery. Who would have thought, after the happy e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace between France and Britain, twenty years ago, that the late war be|tween Britain and America, with all its attending hor|rors, could po&s;&s;ibly have taken place &s;o &s;oon?</P>
<P>When <HI>God gave I&s;rael their reque&s;t, but &s;ent leanne&s;s in|to their &s;ouls,</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cvi. 15.</NOTE> the&s;e two things, taken in their connex|ion, were the greate&s;t cur&s;e that could have befallen them. When Jephthah had ended a &s;ucce&s;sful war a|gain&s;t the children of Ammon, and thereby become the &s;aviour of his country, he &s;eemed to have gained the whole de&s;ire of his heart, even all that happine&s;s for which he had mo&s;t ardently wi&s;hed. But this &s;ame e|vent which made him &s;o happy a man was clo&s;ely con|nected with two &s;ore evils which came nearer to his heart and more &s;en&s;ibly affected him, than all his former con|cerns re&s;pecting the Ammonites. It was cannected
<PB N="29" REF="019359_0028_0FAB528C95E5A2F8">
with the mournful affair re&s;pecting his only child, and it was the occa&s;ion of a very bloody civil war in which, be&s;ide others, forty and two thou&s;and Ephraimites were &s;lain with the &s;word. And thus, as in ten thou|&s;and &s;imilar in&s;tances, the occa&s;ion of his greate&s;t hap|pine&s;s was turned into the occa&s;ion of his greate&s;t mi|&s;ery.</P>
<P>So, although we have gained that for which we mo&s;t ardently wi&s;hed, an happy period to the late war, yet we can by no means be certain but that &s;ome far great|er evils are now before us. We may be over-run and ruined both for time and eternity by a torrent of vice and licenciou&s;ne&s;s, with their never-failing attendants, infidelity and athei&s;m. We may be left to de&s;troy our&s;elves by inte&s;tine divi&s;ions and civil wars: or we may be vi&s;ited with &s;uch &s;ickne&s;s and pe&s;tilence as would &s;oon produce a far greater de&s;truction than any war of what kind &s;oever. God has many ways, even in the pre|&s;ent world, to puni&s;h the &s;ins both of individuals and of nations. He has ten thou&s;and arrows in his quiver, and can always direct any or all of them unerring, to the victims of his wrath. No po&s;&s;ible concurrence of circum&s;tances can &s;creen us from the notice of his eye or the power of his hand. Never, never, can we be &s;ecure but in the practice of true virtue and in the fa|vour of God.</P>
<P>From long and general cu&s;tom, it will, I conceive, be expected that I do not clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e without &s;ome of tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es which have been u&s;ual on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It the fir&s;t place, I beg leave, with great veneration to addre&s;s my&s;elf to his Excellency our Governor and Commander in Chief.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="019359_0029_0FAB528D55CADF68">
May it plea&s;e your EXCELLENCY,
It is with great plea&s;ure we behold you at the helm of government in this &s;overeign and independent State. While we &s;ympathize with you under the burdens and difficulties of your very important &s;tation, we cannot but congratulate you on a variety of circum&s;tances which are peculiarly &s;atisfactory. Highly honourable, in many re&s;pects, is the office which your Excellency fills with &s;o much honour. Much dignity is derived to it from its high importance and exten&s;ive utility. It has been rendered honourable by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of worthy and eminent characters, who have filled it from one time to another, and particularly by that very illu&s;trious and immortal character, your immediate predece&s;&s;or in office. Great is the honour of having a place in &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as this, and much greater &s;till the honour of appearing in it, as your Excellencey does, with a venerable dignity. Connecticut can boa&s;t of a number of her &s;ons in the vigour of life, who are equal to the fir&s;t offices in government. Yet, by the &s;uffra|ges of a free and di&s;cerning people, your Excellency, though far advanced in life, has been rai&s;ed to the fir&s;t chair of government. A greater mark of e&s;teem could not have been given; an equal one, probably never was given by this &s;tate or by any other.</P>
<P>Very great is the public e&s;teem for tho&s;e abilities with which the Fountain of wi&s;dom has endowed you, and for that large &s;tore of knowledge which you have ac|quired from a mo&s;t exten&s;ive reading in the various branches both of civil and &s;acred &s;cience. And yet all good men rejoice that you are thus highly e&s;teemed, not merely for your natural or acquired endowments, but more e&s;pecially for the moral virtues and your &s;a|cred regard for the religion of Je&s;us. May your &s;ingular piety and wi&s;dom, your exten&s;ive influence and mo&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="019359_0030_0FAB528E340F58C8">
excellent example, contribute much to prevent tho&s;e public evils by which we are endangered. This effect in &s;ome good mea&s;ure they have already had, God grant they may have, in a &s;till greater degree, the &s;ame happy effect for the future.</P>
<P>We cannot but view your Excellency as a Mo&s;es, a Jo&s;hua or a Samuel, giving the mo&s;t important in|&s;tructions at the clo&s;e of a mo&s;t u&s;eful life. With pain|ful apprehen&s;ion of our great lo&s;s, and yet with joy in the pro&s;pect of your far more exceeding gain, we view you as an Elijah ready to mount the fiery car and a&s;cend to your native heaven, followed with the mo&s;t eager exclamations of your country. "my father, my father, the chariot of I&s;rael and the hor&s;emen thereof."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings ii. 12</NOTE> When|ever that time &s;hall come, mournful to us but joyful to you, may a double portion of your &s;pirit de&s;cend and re&s;t upon your &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office and upon all our ci|vil rulers. May your Excellency have, both while with us and when taken from us, all the peace and joy of that holy religion to which you have &s;o devoutly adhered. May the God of all con&s;olation be your &s;up|port through life and your portion forever. Amen.&mdash;</P>
<P>May I now be permitted to turn my addre&s;s, with great re&s;pect, to the other branches of our honourable Legi&s;lature; to his Honour the Lieutenant Governor, the honourable a&s;&s;i&s;tant Coun&s;ellors, and the very re|&s;pectable Repre&s;entatives of the people.</P>

<P>While pro&s;perity is dangerous to a people in general, it is peculiarly &s;o to tho&s;e who are elevated above the common walks of life. Honour, power and wealth are attended with &s;trong temptations, temptations which in mo&s;t in&s;tances have proved too powerful for man. In|deed

they have been and always will be too powerful for him, unle&s;s when he calls in foreign aid, even the aid of almighty grace. They who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e worldly goods, tho&s;e envied di&s;tinctions, it is to be fear|ed, often have their portion in this life only, and are therefore of all men the mo&s;t mi&s;erable. Hence that ancient objection again&s;t the Saviour when here on earth, "Have any of the rulers, or of the Phari&s;ees believed on him?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vii 48.</NOTE> Hence his own proverbial ob&s;er|vation: "It is ea&s;ier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the king|dom of God."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xix. 24.</NOTE> Hence his que&s;tion to the Jews: "How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and &s;eek not the honour that cometh from God only?"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John v. 44.</NOTE> Hence we read of tho&s;e among the chief rulers who, in &s;pite of conviction, refu&s;ed to con|fe&s;s Chri&s;t, becau&s;e "They loved the prai&s;e of men more than the prai&s;e of God."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">John xii. 43.</NOTE> Hence the ob&s;ervation of St. Paul: "Not many wi&s;e men after the fle&s;h, not many mighty, not many noble are called."<NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor.

<P>Singularly happy has Connecticut been, even from the beginning, in a Legi&s;lature friendly not only to ci|vil liberty but al&s;o to true religion. And this mo&s;t ex|cellent character, we tru&s;t, may with propriety be ap|plied to this pre&s;ent honourable A&s;&s;embly. May all your public mea&s;ures and your whole conduct, be a de|mon&s;trative proof that our hopes are well founded.</P>
<P>In a particular manner, may your vigourous exerti|ons be directed again&s;t tho&s;e evils by which we are
<PB N="33" REF="019359_0032_0FAB528FD5721108">
threatened in our pre&s;ent pro&s;perous &s;ituation. More e&s;pecially, may &s;uch mea&s;ures be adopted as &s;hall be well calculated to re&s;tore public faith, and to free this State, &s;o far as po&s;&s;ible, from the crying guilt of pub|lic inju&s;tice, which will otherwi&s;e be our reproach and perhaps our ruin. In the name of all hone&s;t men, let me pre&s;ume to entreat you, Honoured Fathers, that &s;uch mea&s;ures be not neglected. <HI>The God of I&s;rael &s;aid, the Rock of I&s;rael &s;pake to me, He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of God.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">a Sam xxiii 3.</NOTE> The mea&s;ures nece&s;&s;ary to the exerci&s;e of public ju&s;tice will accord with the judgement of all wi&s;e politicians as well as with the judgement of God and of all good men. Such mea&s;ures may po&s;&s;ibly be burden&s;ome, in &s;ome degree to the people. But weak or wicked we mu&s;t have been if we ever hoped to gain the glorious prize of in|dependence, without bearing burdens and particularly a very con&s;iderable burden of expen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">. The prize which we have gained, well improved, will infinitely more than counterbalance all the expences we have borne or ever need to bear. Every hone&s;t man will gladly bear his proportion of &s;uch burdens, rather than to tran&s;gre&s;s the eternal law of righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth. Every man who has the &s;malle&s;t preten&s;ions to honour or &s;pirit, will willingly bear his proportion, rather than to be guilty of the meanne&s;s, the ba&s;ene&s;s of cruelly defraud|ing the mo&s;t faithful &s;ervants of the Public, in order to &s;ave an incon&s;iderable expence to him&s;elf. Every man who is unwilling to forward tho&s;e mea&s;ures which are nece&s;&s;ary in order to the exerci&s;e of public ju&s;tice, ought to lie under the imputation of &s;hameful ignorance or a more &s;hameful di&s;hone&s;ty. After all, &s;uch mea|&s;ures may perhaps through the weakne&s;s of human na|ture, be unpopular with many and meet with oppo&s;iti|on.
<PB N="34" REF="019359_0033_0FAB52DE9781C2E0">
But &s;hould they be oppo&s;ed by multitudes nu|merous as the army of Xerxes or the more numerous future armies of Gog and Magog, &s;till, while engaged in the cau&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s, we may &s;ay as the prophet did when he and his &s;ervant were &s;urrounded by a migh|ty Syrian ho&s;t: "<HI>Fear not; for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</HI>" All the ho&s;ts of the Lord in heaven and on earth will &s;upport us, while the Lord of ho&s;ts him&s;elf will be on our &s;ide. "<HI>For the righteous Lord loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, his coun|tenance doth behold the upright.</HI>" He has given the &s;tronge&s;t evidence in his word and in his works, parti|cularly in the great work of Redemption, given the &s;tronge&s;t evidence of his unalterable determination to &s;upport the cau&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth. Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s will finally prevail over iniquity, and truth over fal&s;ehood.&mdash;Indeed were we de&s;igned only for the pre&s;ent world, even then the practice of ju&s;tice and the other moral virtues, would undoubtedly be the &s;afe&s;t and the happie&s;t cour&s;e not only for individuals but for States and Kingdoms,</P>
<P>In the executive department of Government, it is greatly to be wi&s;hed not only that impartial ju&s;tice may be admini&s;tered, but that it be done with di&s;patch and with as little expence as may be con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of Government. Unhappy indeed is the ca&s;e when a legal proce&s;s is attended with &s;uch expence, de|lay and other embarra&s;ments that one had better lo&s;e his ju&s;t dues than to recover them by a cour&s;e of law. Not a few in&s;tances of this kind have taken place. Can no mea&s;ures be adopted which may &s;erve to remedy &s;o great an evil?</P>
<P>The Univer&s;ity of this State, the education of youth and the advancement of literature, are kindred objects of &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> importance, that it is pre&s;umed they will

<P>Reverend and worthy Sirs,
Although Chri&s;t's kingdom is not of this world, yet is it perfectly friendly to civil government. It requires us to obey and honour civil rulers, and to conduct our|&s;elves as peaceable and u&s;eful &s;ubjects of the State. By &s;erving God and your generation in this way, much good may be done, and much has been done by the mem|bers of your venerable order. Great was your influ|ence and great your merit in producing the late glori|ous revolution. And although by the temporary lo&s;&s;es which mo&s;t of you have &s;u&s;tained during the arduous conflict and even to the pre&s;ent day, you have doubtle&s;s borne more than your equal proportion of the expences of the war, yet will this burden be con&s;idered as trifling when compared with the peace of a good con&s;cience and the &s;alvation of your country.</P>
<P>Your virtuous exertions are now again greatly need|ed in preventing tho&s;e evils with which we are threat|ened in our pre&s;ent pro&s;perous &s;tate. No order of men have equal advantages with you, to warn the people again&s;t the encroachments of power on the one hand,
<PB N="36" REF="019359_0035_0FAB52F7B4403C68">
and the evils of anarchy on the other; and at the &s;ame time to in&s;truct them in all tho&s;e various duties which they owe to civil rulers and to their country.</P>
<P>Let us however, never forget that civil and &s;ecular affairs ought to be viewed by us as matters of no more than a &s;econdary con&s;ideration. The weightier mat|ters of the law and the go&s;pel ought always to engage our chief attention, our highe&s;t concern.</P>
<P>We are Amba&s;&s;adors for God to a revolted world. In the guilt and wretchedne&s;s of this revolt, we our|&s;elves are per&s;onally involved. Je&s;us in extreme&s;t ago|nies both of body and &s;oul, has died for our &s;alvation. He has gone into heaven to prepare man&s;ions of glory for his faithful followers. Hell from beneath is moving to receive the de&s;pi&s;ers of his grace. Satan and the powers of darkne&s;s, in conjunction with the world and the fle&s;h, are plotting the de&s;truction of men. The people of our charge are daily pa&s;&s;ing the vale of death and receiving the retributions of eternity. The eye of omni&s;cience is continually upon us. <HI>He who walketh in the mid&s;t of the golden candle&s;ticks and holdeth the &s;tars in his right hand,</HI> hath &s;aid, "<HI>All the churches &s;hall know that I am he which &s;earcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you ac|cording to your works.</HI>" <HI>We watch for &s;ouls as tho&s;e who mu&s;t give an account:</HI> If unfaithful, an aggravated doom will be our portion: if faithful, <HI>we are unto God a &s;weet &s;avour of Chri&s;t in them that are &s;aved and in them that peri&s;h. And who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things? What manner of per&s;ons then, ought we to be in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s?</HI> With what fervour and fidelity ought we to preach the pure doctrines of the go&s;pel and the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t?&mdash;Death will &s;oon put an end to our labours. Let us be anima|ted by the promi&s;ed pre&s;ence of our great Lord and
<PB N="37" REF="019359_0036_0FAB52F939AFDA50">
Ma&s;ter and by his voice which now &s;peaks to each one of us in particular, &s;aying "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." Amen.</P>
<P>Let me now conclude with one word to this whole numerous and re&s;pectable Auditory.</P>
<P>Fellow Citizens and fellow Chri&s;tians,
Great are the benefits of good government. But let us not imagine that the&s;e benefits are to be expected by us, unle&s;s, as a people and as individuals, we are willing to perform tho&s;e duties which we owe to our civil rulers and to the Public in general. Un&s;peakably great are the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel. But let us not imagine that mini&s;ters or churches or any power what|ever can force the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings upon us without our con|&s;ent. They are not, they cannot be ours unle&s;s we live as the go&s;pel directs.</P>
<P>We are happy in being now met together in this large A&s;&s;embly and on this great occa&s;ion. But before the next return of this Aniver&s;ary, how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">any, who are now here, will belong to the great congregation of the dead, and be fixed unalterably in their eternal &s;tate! Who, where, now in this a&s;&s;embly are the per&s;ons thus de&s;tined &s;o &s;oon to another world? Perhaps none more likely than the per&s;on &s;peaking, were we to&punc; form our judgement from apparent &s;ymptoms. But if this be the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> with him, he is not alone. Others will al&s;o travel with him the &s;ame dark road of death. And what one individual here pre&s;ent can &s;ay that he is not one of this number? Are we all prepared for our eter|nal &s;tate? In that &s;tate we &s;hall all &s;oon be found, while other bu&s;y mortals, like our&s;elves, will take our places on this &s;tage of life. And never, never &s;hall we all meet together again, till we meet with the a&s;&s;embled Univer&s;e before the tribunal of our final Judge.</P>

may, at that &s;olemn period, be found on the right hand of our Judge, and, by the &s;entence of his mouth, have our portion a&s;&s;igned us with a far greater and more glo|rious a&s;&s;embly than the pre&s;ent; even with <HI>the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t born which are written in heaven; with the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect, with an innumerable company of angels, with Je&s;us the Mediator of the new covenant and with God the Judge of all.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Ble&s;&s;ing and honour and glory and power be unto him that &s;itteth on the throne and unto the Lamb, forever and ever.</HI></P>
