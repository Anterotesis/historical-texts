<P>THE &s;tate of the currency of the Province be|ing a matter of general &s;peculation and di&s;cour&s;e and a very intere&s;ting &s;ubject, I hope the pub|li&s;hing a few thoughts upon it will not be un|&s;erviceable nor liable to cen&s;ure. It is certain that Gold pa&s;&s;es at too high a rate compared with &s;ilver, and it is ex|pected that in a little time &s;ilver will be extremely &s;carce and gold become the only currency; and, it is &s;aid, that gold not being e&s;tabli&s;hed by law cannot be tendered in di&s;|charge of debts, and therefore great oppre&s;&s;ion of debtors and other mi&s;chiefs mu&s;t en&s;ue. Ever &s;ince the &s;ettlement of the money in 1749 there has been a &s;ufficient plenty of &s;ilver and no preference given to it beyond gold un|til the exchange with England turned again&s;t the pro|vince, and the debtor to the merchants in England found him&s;elf obliged to &s;hip money for the di&s;charge of his debts: Upon comparing the prices of the two metals here with their prices in England, it appeared that &s;ilver might be &s;hipped to much greater advantage than gold: This occa&s;ioned a general enquiry after &s;ilver and gave the fir&s;t alarm; for until then, by means of a variety of favourable circum&s;tances, exchange with England for twelve years together had not been above par, and there had been but little money &s;hipped thither; the di&s;proportion in the two metals was incon&s;iderable, between this and other places to which they have been exported; a much greater proportion of &s;ilver than of gold had been imported by means of the grants made by Parliament; and although the unequal rates have not been wholly unob&s;erved yet there has not been any real mi&s;chiefs accrued therefrom. I was in hopes upon my fir&s;t thought that there was not &s;ufficient grounds for this alarm, and that we might go on as well for twelve years to come as we have done in tho&s;e which are pa&s;t, but upon further con&s;ideration I am convinced this cannot be&punc; exchange is above par;

&s;o many people have unfortunately contracted &s;uch large debts in England that, for &s;ometime at lea&s;t, it mu&s;t continue &s;o, and there will inevitably be further and very great exportation of money, and it is ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary &s;omething &s;hould be done to prevent this exportation being made altogether in &s;ilver. In order to judge what is proper it will not be ami&s;s to look back to the time of the exchange of our late depreciating and dete&s;table paper currency. It was then the determination of the government to have a perpetual invariable &s;tandard for the future: Silver alone agreeable to the practice of all other countries was pitched upon for this purpo&s;e, not that the currency of gold was excluded but it was &s;uppo&s;ed it would pa&s;s in that proportion to &s;ilver as it bore in other parts of the world with which we had com|merce: It was thought be&s;t to conform to Queen <HI>Ann</HI>'s proclamation and to e&s;tabli&s;h a currency at the rate of <HI>&s;ix &s;hillings</HI> a milled dollar, for although &s;ilver by the act of the province is made the &s;tandard at 6<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> the ounce, yet at the &s;ame time a milled dollar was allowed to pa&s;s in di&s;charge of contracts at 6<HI>s.</HI> and every body expected by this means to exclude hammered pieces of eight from our currency, and this has been the effect, and in fact &s;ilver is our &s;tandard by law at 6<HI>s.</HI> 10<HI>d.</HI> the ounce, &s;uppo&s;ing a dollar to weigh 17 dwt. 9 grains; Soon after this, &s;everal &s;pecies of gold coins obtained a currency, and to prevent any ill influence upon the &s;tandard it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to fix by law rates for each &s;pecies which they &s;hould not exceed, although they were not made a legal tender at tho&s;e rates. In doing this the government unhappily fell into two mi&s;|takes; they &s;uppo&s;ed a dollar to be worth 4<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI> &s;ter|ling, whereas Spani&s;h &s;ilver being then in London from 5<HI>s.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI>&frac12; to 5<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d</HI> the ounce, a dollar was worth from 4<HI>s.</HI> 7<HI>d</HI> to 4<HI>s.</HI> 7<HI>d.</HI>&frac12;&punc; they likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed the rates at which foreign gold coins pa&s;&s;ed in England to be in a ju&s;t proportion to &s;ilver, whereas they were at lea&s;t 3 per cent. too high, and from the&s;e mi&s;takes we &s;et a half Joannes at 48<HI>s,</HI> which ought to have been but a|bout

46<HI>s.</HI> and had exchange then have been again&s;t us our &s;ilver coin would have gone from us and the gold only remained. It may be proper to ob&s;erve that what|ever is the proportion between gold and &s;ilver bullion, not gold and &s;ilver coins as they are commonly current by tale, in England, the &s;ame mu&s;t be always kept in the colonies, for all we have of both metals except what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in trade will always go to England, and if you &s;et gold too high in the colonies, it will drain you of your &s;ilver, if you &s;et it too low you in effect exclude gold.</P>
<P>Spani&s;h &s;ilver in London by the la&s;t advices was at 5<HI>s.</HI> 9<HI>d</HI> Portugal gold &pound;.4. 0<HI>s.</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> the ounce: Gold is &s;aid to be ri&s;ing. How gold and &s;ilver bullion both can ri&s;e in any con&s;iderable degree in England without affect|ing all the debt and credit of the nation and the cour&s;e of exchange with all other countries is difficult to con|ceive. If this be the ca&s;e the evil is &s;o great that cer|tainly the wi&s;dom of the Parliament will &s;oon provide a remedy; the difficulty of which we in this province know by experience will increa&s;e in portion to the length of time the mi&s;chief is &s;uffered to continue. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this is going beyond my line. All the ob&s;ervation to be made from it which concerns us is that by means of this ri&s;e exchange when at par is no more now than about 120, whereas before it has been accounted 133&frac13;</P>
<P>It appears that gold bullion is now lower in England compared with &s;ilver than it was in 1749, &s;o that in pro|portion to a dollar at 6<HI>s.</HI> or &s;ilver at 6<HI>s</HI> 10<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> a half Joan|nes of full weight is worth no more than 43<HI>s.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> but if according to &s;ome advices gold is worth in England &pound;.4 1<HI>s..</HI> 8<HI>d.</HI> this will bring an half Joannes to 44<HI>s.</HI> If we &s;uppo&s;e a criti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al or accidental demand for &s;ilver bullion for the Ea&s;t-Indies to have rai&s;ed the price 2<HI>d</HI> an ounce extraordinary, then the half Joanne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> may be &s;et at 45<HI>s.</HI> At all events we can never expect a more favourable pro|portion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gold than there was at the time of exchang|ing our paper money, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n as has been ob&s;erved the half Joannes was worth no more than 46<HI>s.</HI> I think every
<PB N="6" REF="009283_0006_10322A2DDED08108">
body mu&s;t &s;ee that this is an unfortunate circum&s;tance at|tending our currency. The que&s;tion is what is to be done to prevent any mi&s;chievous effects? It is &s;aid we mu&s;t make gold a legal tender as well as &s;ilver. I think this propo&s;al is contrary to the principle the government pro|fe&s;&s;ed in 1749, and will be a violation of the public faith. Two metals as gold and &s;ilver cannot be the mea&s;ure both together, and be both a fixed mea&s;ure, becau&s;e they are frequently changing their proportion one to the other, and we therefore &s;ee that in all coun|tries they have one mea&s;ure only, and this generally is &s;ilver, and gold in &s;uch ca&s;e is a commodity as much as copper or other metals. Now if we make gold a tender at the rate it pa&s;&s;es at pre&s;ent, we take the mo&s;t effec|tual method that can be to drive away all our &s;ilver, and there will be no po&s;&s;ible way to prevent it but by rai&s;|ing the rate of &s;ilver to at lea&s;t 7<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> in&s;tead of 6<HI>s.</HI> 10<HI>d.</HI> the ounce; but this is what I have not yet heard any body own they are willing &s;hould be done. If we do not rai&s;e &s;ilver by law, but &s;uffer it to go from us and leave gold alone to be our mea&s;ure, it will be a mea&s;ure in proportion to &s;ilver at 7<HI>s.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> the ounce, and will have the &s;ame ill effects &amp; be the &s;ame violation of the publick faith as if we had rai&s;ed the &s;ilver. I am &s;urprized at the di&s;tinction &s;ome per&s;ons make between publick and private debts. The government owes a large &s;um for which notes are given payable in &s;ilver at a certain rate. This we are told is an expre&s;s promi&s;e of which there mu&s;t be a &s;pecifick performance. The promi&s;e would have been altogether as expre&s;s if it had been for law|ful money: There is no more difference than between a promi&s;e for a crown and a promi&s;e for five &s;hillings. Now all private contracts are under&s;tood to be in lawful money, the government is the guarrantee for the true performance of &s;uch contracts; but if we alter the mea&s;ure we &s;hall prevent &s;uch performance, and it mu&s;t be a whim&s;ical con&s;cience that will be &s;crupulous in the one ca&s;e and not in the other. What pretence can a man have to whom a &s;um of money is due from the
<PB N="7" REF="009283_0007_10322A2BF4AA50A8">
government, which his neighbour will not have, to whom the like &s;um is due from a private per&s;on? Be|&s;ides, if by making gold a tender we drive away the &s;ilver, does it not effectually di&s;able us from paying the public debt in &s;ilver? Shall we then &s;it &s;till and let things take their cour&s;e? This would be as mi&s;chievous as the other propo&s;al: Gold will pa&s;s at the pre&s;ent rates until we are near drained of our &s;ilver, and then it will become the mea&s;ure of our commerce, which it has not yet been: When this is &s;en&s;ibly perceived it's probable that creditors will refu&s;e to receive it, unle&s;s at &s;uch rates as &s;hall be equal in value to lawful mo|ney, and from thence inequality and confu&s;ion in all trade and dealing mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e.</P>
<P>There is one way more in which we may be re|lieved; and although it will be attended with inconve|niences, yet they will be le&s;s than in any other way. We have the example of the Parliament, in the like ca&s;e, at home; and I know of no example which we may more &s;afely follow. Let the Gold coins be reduced to a ju&s;t proportion to Silver, as &s;tated by law &s;o as to make it indifferent to the merchant which he exports: Per|haps reducing the half Johannes from 48<HI>&s;.</HI> to 46<HI>&s;.</HI> and other coins in the &s;ame degree, may be &s;ufficient. It is objected that this will oblige every debtor to pay more than his ju&s;t debt; he received gold at 48<HI>&s;.</HI> and mu&s;t pay it at 46<HI>&s;.</HI></P>
<P>In order to judge of the force of this objection, we mu&s;t con&s;ider what has been the mea&s;ure of all contracts, whether &s;ilver at 6<HI>&s;.</HI> the dollar, and 6<HI>&s;.</HI> 10<HI>d.</HI> the ounce, or gold at 48<HI>&s;.</HI> the half Joannes; if the latter the objec|tion is unan&s;werable; if the former, it has no force. Now I take it &s;ilver alone has been the mea&s;ure, and the gold hitherto has had no more influence upon it than pi&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reens have had, which although of a ba&s;e me|tal, yet have been received and paid without any di&s;|count between them and the purer &s;ilver. And it is cer|tain that the cour&s;e of exchange with all places with which we have commerce, has been governed by our &s;il|ver
<PB N="8" REF="009283_0008_10322A2A70DE6810">
lawful money, and not by our gold; and when we &s;hall have reduced the half Joannes to 46<HI>&s;.</HI> it will take no more of a debtor's e&s;tate to obtain an hundred pounds in gold at 46<HI>&s;.</HI> then it does now at 48<HI>&s;.</HI> the piece, and no debt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> can be hurt, except &s;uch only as at the time of the reduction are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the gold, and we know it is not very common for per&s;ons in debt to keep a great deal of money by them. As for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the gold, reducing the value has the appearance of &s;o far le&s;&s;ening their property. But if this is not done now, it infallibly will be done, &s;ooner or later; for the two &s;hillings, or whatever &s;um it is which we affix to the half Joannes above its ju&s;t value, is a mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> imaginary wealth in the province, as much &s;o as the paper money was when it was current among us, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or will &s;uffer no more in this way than he will do if we permit all our &s;ilver to go away, and gold to become our mea&s;ure, for then the half Joannes will in effect be re|duced, and what now pa&s;&s;es equal to &s;ilver at 6<HI>&s;.</HI> 10<HI>d.</HI> will then lo&s;e all the adventitious value and pa&s;s equal to &s;ilver at 7<HI>&s;.</HI> 4<HI>d.</HI> It is certain that by this reduction there can be no real lo&s;s to the whole province; the &s;ame quantity of gold remains, and an ounce of gold or &s;ilver with a le&s;&s;er price affixed to it is of ju&s;t the &s;ame real value as it is with a greater, and the &s;ole objection of any weight to this propo&s;al is, that we &s;ubject the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to &s;ome inconvenience and perhaps lo&s;s, to which &s;ome future po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors mu&s;t be &s;ubjected, if the pre&s;ent are not. I expect &s;ome per&s;ons will &s;ay this propo&s;al does not go far enough, and we mu&s;t have a &s;cheme which will keep both &s;ilver and gold among us, and then there will be no more need of reducing gold than there has been in times pa&s;t. If any per&s;on can propo&s;e a method of effecting this, I will give up my propo&s;al. This can be done in no other way than by le&s;&s;ening our imports: We &s;hall not do this &s;ufficiently un|til the &s;carcity of money obliges us to it. The plenty of money has produced luxury, luxury naturally tends to poverty, poverty will produce indu&s;try and frugality, and indu&s;try and frugality will le&s;&s;en the proportion of imports to exports and will bring money a|mong us; but before this revolution is fini&s;hed, the mi&s;chiefs we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the di&s;proportionate rates of gold and &s;ilver mu&s;t arrive to us.</P>

<HEAD>CONSIDERATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER re&s;pect is due to the honorable gentleman, who&s;e writing I am con&s;idering, when he is actually in the execution of any one of tho&s;e many high o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">es he with &s;o much dignity &s;u&s;tains: When he conde&s;cendeth to write in a news-paper, to propo&s;e a project and offer rea|&s;ons for it; his projections and his rea&s;onings may be con&s;idered with the &s;ame freedom as tho&s;e of any other &s;ubject. I freely declare, that I look on the project he hath propo&s;ed to be pernicious, and his rea&s;oning in|conclu&s;ive. Such being my &s;entiments, I deem it my duty, and the part of a good citizen, to oppo&s;e my&s;elf to his projection, and to &s;how that the arguments with which he &s;upports it, do not conclude. This I &s;hall do with an hone&s;t freedom: pre&s;erving at the &s;ame time that decent re&s;pect for the honorable gentleman him&s;elf, which his high &s;tations, and great character de|mand, from a per&s;on &s;o much his interior, as the pre|&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">marker.</P>
<P>It is a vulgar error, which hath &s;trangely prevailed long time, that no tender can be made in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">old. This error now &s;eems con&s;ecrated by the authority of a gen|tleman, who&s;e high office denominates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the greate&s;t lawyer in the province. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> I refer to are the&s;e, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> that gold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> being e&s;tabli&s;hed by law cannot be tendered in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of debts"&mdash;and afterwards.

at tho&s;e rates." Afterwards, "It is &s;aid we mu&s;t make gold a <HI>legal</HI> tender, as well as &s;ilver. I think this propo&s;al is contrary to the principles the govern|ment profe&s;&s;ed in 1749 and will be a violation of the public faith." And afterwards, "We therefore &s;ee, that in all countries, they have one mea&s;ure only, and this generally is &s;ilver. And gold in &s;uch ca&s;e is a commodity as much as copper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> or other metals." And afterwards, "I take it &s;ilver alone has been the mea|&s;ure, and that gold hitherto has had no more influence upon it than pi&s;tareens have had, &amp;c."</P>
<P>I conceive the amount of the&s;e, and &s;everal other expre&s;&s;ions, in the writing I am con&s;idering to be this; that we have here, or even in England, no other law|ful money, but of &s;ilver only, that gold is only a com|modity, that a debtor therefore never might in this pro|vince di&s;charge him&s;elf, or prevent the forfeiture of his obligation, by tendring gold coins at the rates &s;et in the law. And that new to make them &s;uch a legal tender would be a violation of the public faith. Tak|ing the&s;e to be the honorable gentleman's po&s;itions, I do humbly but &s;trenuou&s;ly di&s;&s;ent from him in all. And I hold, that ever &s;ince the act of this province, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the rates of gold coins; the gold coins therein &s;pecified, at the rates mentioned in &s;aid act, have been as much the lawful money of this province, and at tho&s;e rates would di&s;charge a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> execution or &s;ave a forfeiture, as well as milled Dollars at <HI>&s;ix &s;hillings</HI> a piece, or other coined &s;ilver at <HI>&s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence</HI> an ounce.

<P>Doubtle&s;s, when I contradict &s;o great authority, it is incumbent on me to produce the authorities and rea&s;ons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which I rely. Let us therefore con&s;ider this matter a little more at large.</P>
<P>I take it, that money is that metal of gold or &s;ilver, which is coined by the authority of the prince, or is
<PB N="11" REF="009283_0011_10322A250AEA4BD8">
made current, and it's rate &s;tated, by his proclamation. I further apprehend it clear, that gold has been nearly in as ancient u&s;e in England for this purpo&s;e as &s;ilver.</P>
<P>To prove this I cite the&s;e authorities. Mirror cited by Ld. Coke, 2d. In&s;t. 576. It was ordained that no King of this realm may change his money or impaire it, or make other money than of gold or &s;ilver, without the a&s;&s;ent of all his counties.</P>
<P>Stat. 25. Edw. 3d. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed by Ld. Coke, 2d In&s;t. 577. Item. It is accorded that the money of gold and &s;ilver, which now is current, &s;hall not be impaired: in weight or alloy; but as &s;oon as good way be found, that the &s;ame be put in the ancient &s;tate as in the &s;terling.</P>
<P>Ld. Coke 1 In&s;tit. 207. "Lawful money of Eng|land, either of gold or &s;ilver, is of two &s;orts, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the Engli&s;h money coined by the King's authority, or foreign coin by proclamation made current within the realm."</P>

<P>Let us now return to our own country, and con&s;ider the ca&s;e as it &s;tands with our&s;elves, re&s;pecting this matter.</P>
<P>His Honor goes back no further in this re&s;earch, than to the times of the exchange of our late depre|ciating, and (as he doth not &s;pare to call it) <HI>dete&s;table</HI> paper currency.

For whatever wi&s;dom and integrity I a&s;cribe to the court that was concerned in that memorable exchange, the year of jubilee, as it hath been often &s;ounded: I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e a matter of that important and in|tere&s;ting nature, as his Honor ju&s;tly repre&s;ents this, to have wholly e&s;caped the ob&s;ervation of our legi&s;lators before this time.</P>
<P>If therefore his Honor will be plea&s;ed to look into the province law 15 Georg. 2d. cap. 2. A. D. 1741. he &s;hall there find a law entitled an act to a&s;certain the value of money, &amp;c. the fir&s;t clau&s;e whereof enacts, that from and after the fir&s;t day of February [then] next, all coined &s;ilver of &s;terling alloy &s;hall be ac|counted paid and taken as lawful money of this pro|vince at the rate of <HI>&s;ix &s;hillings and eight pence</HI> per ounce, and OTHER MONEY in the &s;ame proportion, and no otherwi&s;e.</P>

<P>True it is the legi&s;lature do not there fix the pro|portion between gold and &s;ilver. They however &s;up|po&s;e a proportion and a fixed proportion between them.</P>
<P>If his Honor's dete&s;tation of a paper currency, will permit him to look into the acts for e&s;tabli&s;hing what are called the middle and new tenor bills of credit; he &s;hall find the&s;e mentioning gold, and determining the value of their bills, by gold at a fixed rate, as well as &s;ilver. Which I take to be &s;o many te&s;timonies, and mo&s;t authentic ones too, that they looked on gold indifferently with &s;ilver to be the LAWFUL MONEY of this province. And this holds true, whatever reproach his Honor may ca&s;t on our paper currency: And how|ever fictitious the value, which the bills purported, was.
<PB N="14" REF="009283_0014_10322A1FA5E727D0">
For all the&s;e &s;how plainly that they profe&s;&s;ed to make gold as well as &s;ilver a <HI>&s;tandard.</HI></P>
<P>We will now come with his Honor to the act for redeeming the bills of credit: which it is true menti|oneth only coined &s;ilver, and does not that I can find make any mention of gold. This I take to be a meer over&s;ight at that time, owing to the great perturbation, which the redeeming our paper currency occa&s;ioned, both within doors and without: Or perhaps it was &s;uppo&s;ed that fixing the rate of &s;ilver, the proportion between it and gold being &s;ettled, fixed the rate of other money: ju&s;t as &s;ettling the value of one dollar was &s;ettling the rule for any other number what&s;oever. Or whatever other cau&s;e it was owing to: certain it is (as his Honor &s;ays, and we need not de&s;ire a better witne&s;s) it was not intended to exclude the currency of gold. In truth, if it had been their mo&s;t declared intention &s;o to do: I incline to think it cannot be in the power of the legi&s;lature of this province, by an act of theirs, to exclude the currency of the gold coin, &s;tamped by the authority of the King, or current by his proclamation.</P>
<P>We need not however &s;pend time in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this la&s;t point; becau&s;e before the change of our bills took place, the other act for a&s;certaining the rates of gold coins was made.</P>
<P>The report his Honor makes of this law is this. "To prevent any ill influence on the &s;tandard, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to fix by law rates for each &s;pecies, which they &s;hould not excede, altho' they were not made a tender at tho&s;e rates."</P>
<P>I on the contrary &s;uppo&s;e that the rates of tho&s;e gold coins were &s;ettled as much by that law; made as really lawful money at tho&s;e rates; as ever dollars were made &s;o at the rate of &s;ix &s;hillings a piece by the former law. Thus we differ, our appeal mu&s;t therefore be to the law it&s;elf for a deci&s;ion. But before I pre&s;ent that to the reader, I de&s;ire him only to ob|&s;erve, what a &s;trange repre&s;entation is here made by his

<P>The&s;e gold coins, his Honor &s;aith, obtained a cur|rency among us; rates were fixed which they &s;hould not exceed, yet they were not money at tho&s;e rates.

And a debtor taken in execution mu&s;t be committed to goal for a debt of ten pounds, tho' he hath and tenders to the officer, gold with the image and &s;uper&s;cription of the King of Great-Britain on it, to the amount of five hun|dred pounds.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The &s;heriff perhaps may take it in execution and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> vendue as he may any other commodity.</NOTE> I imagine this con&s;equence is too glar|ing to be &s;eriou&s;ly adopted; and the gentleman will &s;ay that the&s;e gold coins were a render at &s;ome rate: but not at the rates the law fixed. It was &s;uppo&s;ed (the gentle|man &s;aith) it would pa&s;s in that proportion to &s;ilver, as it bore in other parts of the world with which we had commerce." Let us &s;ee if as &s;hocking con&s;equences do not follow from this explication as the former. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, a debtor in the hands of a &s;heriff, on an exe|cution for ten pounds. He hath no &s;ilver to offer; but he hath gold enough. On our pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition the &s;heriff mu&s;t not commit him, if he will pay in gold in proportion to &s;ilver as it bears in other parts of the world with which we have commerce. Who is to judge and determine this, which is needful to be in&s;tantly de|termined, in order to the debtors liberation? Why, to compleat our repre&s;entation; let us &s;uppo&s;e this matter to happen preci&s;ely at the in&s;tant his Honor's projec|tions and propo&s;als are made public.

collect, with certainty from it, that he mu&s;t not accept a Joannes for forty eight &s;hillings. Mean time his pri|&s;oner grows impatient, tenders him all his gold coins, amounting to one hundred pounds &s;terling, and bids him take at his peril. What now &s;hall the &s;heriff do? &s;hall he adventure him&s;elf to decide what his Honor hath left doubtful? &s;hall he determine what proportion gold bears to &s;ilver in other parts of the world with which we have commerce? And does he determine at his own ri&s;que, &s;o that if he determine gold at a lower or higher rate than it really bears to &s;ilver in other parts of the world with which we have commerce, the creditor or debtor re&s;pectively have their action again&s;t him? And &s;hall this que&s;tion which hath &s;o much puzzled the &s;he|riff, puzzle a jury on the action again&s;t the &s;heriff, and be finally determined at the ri&s;que and expence of the &s;heriff? Note here that I do not &s;uppo&s;e the &s;heriff or debtor in this ca&s;e to apply to any lawyer for advice. That body are &s;uppo&s;ed to be acquainted with the laws of their country, but this matter by the &s;uppo&s;ition the law hath not &s;ettled, it hath left it to be defined by the commerce of other countries; which the lawyers by their books and &s;tudy, have no direction to find.</P>

<P><PB N="17" REF="009283_0017_10322A18EC54BD58">
Upon this view I think the ju&s;tice of the &s;econd po|&s;ition I advanced, mu&s;t appear clear to every one, <HI>to wit.</HI> that if tho&s;e &s;pecies of gold coin were not now a legal tender at tho&s;e rates; public ju&s;tice and con&s;cience evi|dently require they &s;hould in the mo&s;t explicit manner be made &s;o. For nothing is more evident than that &s;uch uncertainty and fluctuation in &s;o intere&s;ting an affair, mu&s;t produce endle&s;s confu&s;ion and di&s;order. And I think, it is al&s;o very evident, in fact and experience, that tho&s;e gold coins have ever &s;ince the making of that law pa&s;|&s;ed at the values therein &s;et, and been the mea&s;ure of all contracts, to the full as much as dollars, have been at &s;ix &s;hillings. No man for in&s;tance, at this day, is ho|ne&s;tly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Joannes, whom it hath not co&s;t forty eight &s;hillings. The government it&s;elf, in all its tran&s;actions with its creditors, and with its debtors, hath received and payed it always at that rate, and by its own example taught the &s;ubjects to receive and pay it at the &s;ame. In all the debts that have been contracted by private per&s;ons, &s;ince the year 1750, a Joannes has been hitherto con&s;idered by the creditor, and by the debtor as forty eight &s;hillings. Now if the debtor be compellable to pay, the individual Joannes he borrowed at two &s;hillings le&s;s, than he received it for, and it was reckoned to make up his debt. Alas what have we gained by the year of jubilee? What avails the de&s;truc|tion of our depreciating and dete&s;table paper currency? Where is our perpetual invariable &s;tandard? If god, hard gold, with the image and &s;uper&s;cription of the Briti&s;h Cae&s;ar on it can depreciate as well as old Tenor. Nay, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, are we not in a far wor&s;e &s;itua|tion, with re&s;pect to the public ju&s;tice, than with the mo&s;t dete&s;table of our paper bills? For we had a mea|&s;ure by which to know their depreciatiation. The courts compared the bills with the price of &s;ilver at the time they made up judgment and added as depreciation what|ever that was more than the price at the time of the contracting the debt. This was ea&s;ily known, it was only to &s;end to the gold&s;miths in Bo&s;ton; from them
<PB N="18" REF="009283_0018_103226D64FB368C0">
the courts actually had tables of the ri&s;e of &s;ilver, by which they e&s;timated this depreciation. But in our ca&s;e, where &s;hall they find a table, which &s;hall &s;how them "the proportion gold bears to &s;ilver in other parts of the world with which we have commerce?"</P>
<P>Moreover, No inju&s;tice can be done to creditors, by making the&s;e gold coins, a tender at the rates the go|vernment has &s;et on them. <HI>They</HI> will receive their own, with u&s;ury, whereas infinite inju&s;tice may be done to <HI>debtors,</HI> if either gold coins may be wholly refu&s;ed; or may be accepted only at the creditors price. Where|fore, if public con&s;cience requires, that ju&s;tice be done to all, without inju&s;tice to any; it requires that the&s;e gold coins &s;hould be made money, and a tender at the rates the government have &s;et them by their own law, and univer&s;al practice hath al&s;o confirmed.&mdash;In ca&s;e his Honor is right and they are not already &s;o. Let us now con&s;ider that law, and &s;ee if the opera|tion thereof be not evidently &s;o to make them.</P>
<P>The act is 23d Geor. 2d. chap. 5. and is entitled an act for a&s;certaining the rates at which coined &s;ilver and gold, and Engli&s;h half pence and farthings may pa&s;s within this government.</P>
<P>The preamble, reciting the clau&s;e, in the former law, relating to bargains and contracts payable in &s;ilver, adds, And whereas there is great rea&s;on to apprehend, that many and great inconveniences may ari&s;e in ca&s;e any coined &s;ilver or gold, or Engli&s;h half pence, and farthings &s;hould pa&s;s at any higher rate than in a ju&s;t proportion to Spani&s;h pieces of eight, or coined &s;ilver, at the rates afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Then follows the enacting clau&s;e, that it &s;hall not be lawful to receive or take any of the following coin at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> greater or higher rate than allowed by that act.</P>

<P>Here his Honor &s;aith, they (the gold coins) were not made a tender at tho&s;e rates.

I would a&s;k him, if it were not too bold whether tho&s;e al&s;o are to pa&s;s, in the &s;ame proportion with &s;ilver, they bear in other parts of the world with which we have commerce.</P>
<P>Now I apprehend that this law, e&s;pecially if taken in connection with the former law, 15 Geor. 2d. chap. 2d. makes the&s;e &s;pecies both of gold &amp; &s;ilver coins mo|ney, at the rates there &s;pecified, my rea&s;ons are the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">(1.)

Where the rates of pieces of eight and other coined &s;ilver is &s;tated, and nearly the &s;ame words prohibotary of any per&s;ons accounting at an higher rate as in the law we are now con&s;idering; there comes a provi&s;ion in the&s;e words. <HI>Provided that nothing in this act contained &s;hall extend or be con&s;trued to compel any per&s;on to receive any of the &s;aid &s;pecies of foreign &s;ilver coins at the re&s;pective rates in the &s;aid procla|mation mentioned.</HI> Hereupon this is my argument. This provi&s;o was needful to be put in, otherwi&s;e the procla|mation and the other part of the act would have been taken to be thus compul&s;ory. The operation of law on the former part of the &s;tatute would have made the coins there mentioned money and a legal tender at tho&s;e rates. Now in our law there is no &s;uch provi&s;o, where|fore the operation of the words are as afore&s;aid. This argument is of the more force, as many expre&s;&s;ions in the province law &s;eem to be borrow'd from that &s;ta|tute; the language whereof they adopt in the prohibi|tion, but do not adopt the provi&s;o.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) The province law we are con&s;idering hath ob|tained the royal a&s;&s;ent. And therefore may be looked upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to a proclamation of his Maje&s;ty.
<PB N="21" REF="009283_0021_10322A12E1BBD188">
Now as his Maje&s;ty hath right to &s;ettle the rates at which foreign coins may be current in his dominions. Had he by one proclamation declared that Spani&s;h milled pieces of eight &s;hould be lawful money at &s;ix &s;hillings each, and by a &s;ucceeding one, that &s;uch &s;pe|cies of coin were in a ju&s;t proportion to that, and &s;hould not exceed &s;uch a rate. I believe none could have doubted but that they became lawful money at tho&s;e rates. I add,</P>
<P N="7">(7.) The proportion &s;et in this law between gold and &s;ilver is the exact proportion they bear in the Engli&s;h mint at this day, and according to the la&s;t regulation made thereof by our Sovereign.</P>
<P>Her late Maje&s;ty Queen Ann by her proclamation dated the eighteenth of June 1704, (printed in the la&s;t edition of the provincial perpetual laws page 155) de|clares that &s;he had cau&s;ed a&s;&s;ays to be made by the principal officers of her mint to determine the &s;terling value of &s;everal &s;pecies of foreign coins that pa&s;&s;ed in payment in her dominions in America. Among others her Maje&s;ty mentions the&s;e peices of eight, and the &s;terling value of them, &s;et by her Maje&s;ty in this proclamation is four &s;hillings and &s;ix pence each. His Honor him&s;elf &s;aith, that it was thought be&s;t to conform to this proclamation in the act for exchanging our paper bills. And in truth it is wholly by this th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> all the other &s;pecies of money both gold and &s;ilver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> regulated. Let any one compare them, and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> find them exactly calculated. It is not even &s;ugge&s;t that the &s;terling value of any of the&s;e coins is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rated. A Johannes is worth at lea&s;t 36<HI>&s;.</HI> &s;terling, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o of the re&s;t. This then is the regulation of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|ney; four &s;hillings and &s;ix pence &s;terling is equal to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hillings lawful money of this province. The &s;terling value of a dollar as &s;ettled by her Maje&s;ty is four &s;hil|lings and &s;ix pence. This is the rule the government profe&s;s to go by. Not the accidental price of bullion in the market. And by this rule <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="22" REF="009283_0022_10322A10F22AA2D8">
with which I will not detain the reader will &s;how that the rated values are ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e rea&s;ons and others that might be men|tioned I apprehend the&s;e gold coins to be money at the rates fixed in the law; and therefore I &s;uppo&s;e it would be at the peril of the Sheriff to refu&s;e them at tho&s;e rates, and that he would &s;ubject him&s;elf thereby to the action of the party, who&s;e gold he refu&s;ed. And I have too much confidence in the ju&s;tice of the honour|ble gentleman him&s;elf, to &s;uppo&s;e the extrajudicial opi|nion, he hath given in the news paper, would influence even his own judgment; when the matter came be|fore him in tryal. At the &s;ame time I mu&s;t &s;ay it is great pity that the honourable gentleman &s;hould pub|licly in &s;uch peremptory and &s;trong terms, declare his opinion on a que&s;tion, which in all probability unle&s;s &s;ome new law be made will one day or other come judi|cially before him.</P>
<P>Wherefore I apprehend it highly imports the legi&s;lature of this province, to put this matter out of all po&s;&s;ible doubt, and in words that cannot be winked out of &s;ight, to make the&s;e coins money at their pre&s;ent rates. I will even add that in my opini|on all the di&s;putes that have ever been, between the &s;everal branches of the legi&s;lature of this province, are meer trifles compared with this.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude, without adding that his Honor's propo&s;al, which I take to be, to let &s;ilver remain at the pre&s;ent rate, and to lower the rates of gold&punc; to me ap|pears highly unju&s;t on the principles he him&s;elf lays down&mdash;He &s;ays "that whatever is the proportion between gold and &s;ilver bullion in England the &s;ame mu&s;t be always kept in the colonies." He &s;aith al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat at the exchange of our paper bills &s;ilver was from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 3<HI>d</HI>&frac12; to 5<HI>s</HI> 4<HI>d</HI> &s;terling the ounce; and he &s;aith that &s;ilver by the la&s;t advices was at 5<HI>s</HI> 9<HI>d.</HI> And that gold was at four pounds and eight pence and ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>From the&s;e facts it plainly appears, that both gold and &s;ilver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in England, are of higher value than at the
<PB N="23" REF="009283_0023_10322A0F7054D938">
time of the exchange of our paper bills. Now his Ho|nor's propo&s;al is to let &s;ilver remain with us at this ex|treme low rate and to make gold lower &s;till, that is to &s;ay, the value of Joannes, is really greater than it was, at the time of the exchange afore&s;aid, by the mea&s;ure he him&s;elf propo&s;es to try it by: yet his Honor's project and propo&s;al is to force the debtor to pay it at a le&s;&s;er rate.</P>
<P>In truth, if the mi&s;chiefs his Honor points out are real (about which I pretend not to judge being no merchant) and if the&s;e mi&s;chiefs require any interpo&s;ition at all from the legi&s;lature, I conceive that interpo&s;ition ought rather to be in rai&s;ing the price of dollars than in lower|ing that of gold coins. I have (as I conceive) great authority with me in this. No le&s;s than the honoura|ble &s;uperior court. Every one knows, that as during our paper currency, when &s;ilver was continually ri&s;ing; they in making up judgment&punc; on debts, contracted to be paid in bills of credit, added as depreciation whatever &s;ilver had ri&s;en from the time of contracting the debts: So in the year 1750 and ever &s;ince, in making up judg|ments on debts contracted to be paid in bills of credit in the years 1748 &amp; 1749, in which years &s;ilver was at &pound;. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an ounce, they made &amp; &s;till make an allowance reba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ment or<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As the writer has not the vanity to think the&s;e remarks will cro&s;s the water, it is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to make an apology for u&s;ing this word which hath univer&s;ally obta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is well under&s;tood in this province.</NOTE> appretiation of ten per cent, and deduct that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thereabouts from the principal &s;um expre&s;&s;ed in the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d and then ca&s;t the intere&s;t on the remaining principal.

the market. Really it appears to me that all the facts his Honor points out &s;how plainly that dollars are much under-rated, and that it is from this under-rate of them, not the over-rate of the gold coins, that the di&s;proportion he &s;peaks of ari&s;es. His Honor &s;aith they were e&s;tima|ted too low at the fir&s;t, they were worth at that time from four &s;hillings and &s;even pence to four &s;hillings and &s;even pence half penny &s;terling, and they are worth now five &s;hillings &s;terling. It is their greater worth in England at this day that makes it more profitable to &s;hip them there than gold. If it be &s;aid that by rai&s;ing them eve|ry trader lo&s;es 3 or 4 per cent of his debt, I deny it, he lo&s;es nothing, any more than the creditor to whom bills of credit were payable by contract in the years 1748 &amp; 1749. Both have the real value of their debts made good to them; and neither ought to de&s;ire to have more than <HI>their own</HI> with u&s;ury. I de&s;ire however it may be ob|&s;erved that I do not propo&s;e &s;uch a ri&s;e of &s;ilver. I only &s;ay if one mu&s;t be done, either to rai&s;e &s;ilver, or lower gold, the former is mo&s;t equitable and mo&s;t agreeable to truth, and therefore to be preferred.</P>
<P>In one thing I do agree with his Honor, that there is no difference between the public debts and private ones, re&s;pecting this matter. Money the wi&s;e man &s;aith an&s;wers all things. However particular the obligation may be, the court makes up judgment for lawful money, not for the particular &s;pecies of it that a whim&s;ical cre|ditor may pitch upon. And what&s;oever is money will di&s;charge a debt.&mdash;Let us &s;uppo&s;e for in&s;tance an obli|gation to be made for a thou&s;and Engli&s;h &s;hillings; no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> can think a debtor bound by &s;uch obligation would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> held to a &s;pecifick payment, but that the value of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> paid in any other money would di&s;charge him.&mdash;The like ob&s;ervation holds with re&s;pect to the metals of which money may be made, whether gold or &s;ilver be &s;pecially mentioned. Money an&s;wereth all things.&mdash;Nor will it be any inju&s;tice to the creditors of the go|vernment for them &s;o to con&s;ider it, for it is very cer|tain that the money lent the government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ath been in|differently
<PB N="25" REF="009283_0025_10322A0BE88C43A8">
paid into the trea&s;ury, in gold and &s;ilver, whatever the words of the acts for the loan might ex|pre&s;s.</P>
<P>His Honor propo&s;es an objection to him&s;elf that is of great weight.&mdash;It is that his propo&s;al doth not go far enough, that we mu&s;t have a &s;cheme to keep both gold and &s;ilver among us, and then there will be no more need of reducing gold, than there has been in times pa&s;t. He is &s;o good as to &s;ay, if any per&s;on can pro|po&s;e a method of effecting this he will give up his propo&s;al.</P>
<P>I am &s;o whim&s;ical as to think, that without this &s;cheme be effected, it is very immaterial to provide for any thing el&s;e. And that if we had money of one metal or even of one denomination only, a balance in other countries, which nece&s;&s;arily called for the exportation of it, would produce all the mi&s;chiefs that his Honor points out. It would in reality if not in name rai&s;e the price of that one denomination.</P>
<P>I am al&s;o whim&s;ical enough to &s;uppo&s;e, that it is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us, by our luxury to be reduced to &s;uch extreme poverty as his Honor mentions in order to bring our exports and imports to more equality, and prevent &s;uch an heavy balance again&s;t us.</P>
<P><HI>TRADE</HI> hath made this province what it is,&mdash;hath rai&s;ed it from a wild fore&s;t, to a fair and beautiful co|lony,&mdash;hath enabled it to bear the heavie&s;t wars, with|out &s;inking.&mdash;Let this therefore be &s;till cheri&s;hed.&mdash;Let what remains of it to us be courted to &s;tay.&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it be a&s;&s;ured of the protection of power, and no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> armed to its de&s;truction.

<P>If once this public &s;pirit could prevail, and univer&s;al attention be given to the real intere&s;t of the public, we might rea&s;onably hope, &s;oon to &s;ee our trade on &s;uch a foot, as that none of the mi&s;chiefs his Honor points out would affect us.</P>

<P>THIS &s;ubject may receive an additional light if placed in one other view.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e that when the exchange of our paper was made, our legi&s;lature had adopted a &s;terling cur|rency in&s;tead of our pre&s;ent. As we could not expect to have our currency from the coins of the kingdom, it would have been nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;tated the rate of &s;uch foreign coins as we might &s;uppo&s;e would be cur|rent here. Her Maje&s;ty's regulation afore-mentioned would have fixed the rate of a dollar at four &s;hillings and &s;ix pence, a Johannes would have been 36<HI>f.</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now on this &s;uppo&s;ition all the mi&s;chiefs his Honor points out mu&s;t have happened. There would have been a gain on dollars of &s;ix pence or &s;even pence a piece &s;terling, which would have tempted to the expor|tation of them rather than gold.
