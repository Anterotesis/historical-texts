<P>THE Fal&s;e Narrations, and Odi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us Repre|&s;entations, contained in that Scandalous Book, written by <HI>Robert Calf,</HI> has made our worthy Pa&s;tors Obnoxious (for ought we know) to hard Cen|&s;ures, among an unguided multitude. We have little hopes of convicting any, who are &s;o full fraught|ed with the &V;enome of that Book, as that no Evi|dence will avail, but in &s;pite of all that is hitherto known, will &s;till retain a Belief to the contrary: yet this we hope, that tho&s;e who are not &s;uch grand Ene|mies to Truth, may hereby be &s;atisfyed in tho&s;e things which they have hitherto but doubted of; for want of which knowledge, they have been unable to defend tho&s;e Faithful Servants of Chri&s;t. That is the End of this Book; That tho&s;e who are well wi&s;hers to the Eminent Servants of Chri&s;t, and His Peo|ple, may be able to oppo&s;e all gain&s;ayers, who by their Reproaches, and Slanders, go about to render them Odious to the world; whereby they will be deprived of all their de&s;ired Opportunities to Serve God &amp; his Faithful People.

<P><HI>NEW-ENGLAND</HI> was once a plaee, in which the Feet of them that brought the Good Tidings of the Go&s;pel were beautiful. But there is now &s;prung up a Number, who &s;eem to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of another Spirit: No wonder then if tho&s;e who are Faithful to Chri&s;t and His Intere&s;t, are Reproached and Maligned by them that &s;erve His greate&s;t Enemy. It is an awful Symptom, of &s;ome &s;ad thing near unto <HI>The Churches,</HI> when the mo&s;t Faithful, and Painful I abourers among us <HI>in them,</HI> are bemired and be&s;pattered by Ungodly men. But that God who &s;aid, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye when men Revile you, and Per&s;ecute you, and &s;peak all manner of Evil of you, fal&s;ely for my &s;ake</HI>; will reward them.</P>
<P>There is according to our e&s;teem of it, a Libellous Book lately come unto this Countrey, which Book may truely be called, <HI>A Fire-brand thrown by a Mad-man</HI>; which is writ (with what help we know not) by one <HI>Robert Calef,</HI> who pre&s;umes to call him&s;elf <HI>Merchant of Bo&s;ton</HI>; but we wi&s;h, <HI>Better</HI> Wares were vended, by
<PB N="6" REF="000975_0005_0FAE8C6C2B4D1158">
this <HI>Merchant.</HI> The Book is full as is thought by Good men, of Scurrilous Reflections on the <HI>Government,</HI> as well as the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the Countrey.</P>
<P>And Fir&s;t, for the <HI>Government</HI>; the tenden|cy of the Book is to per&s;wade the People, that the <HI>Judges</HI> of the Land; are the Unju&s;te&s;t, Cruelle&s;t and mo&s;t Blood-thir&s;ty men; <HI>Our Wi&s;e men</HI> (&s;ayes he) <HI>becoming Fools.</HI> What was done by them in the dark time of our Troubles from the <HI>Invi&s;ible World,</HI> all Hone&s;t men believe, they did in Con&s;cience of the <HI>Oath</HI> of God upon them, and they followed unto the be&s;t of their Under&s;tanding, as we are in|formed, the Precedents of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and <HI>other Nations,</HI> on &s;uch a Dark and Doleful occa&s;ion. When they found the matter carried beyond the reach of <HI>Mortals,</HI> they &s;topt; and the Honourable Lieutenant Governour, Coun|cil and A&s;&s;embly of the Province, in a Publick Proclamation for a <HI>Fa&s;t</HI>; called for the Prayers of the Countrey, <HI>That what&s;oever mi&s;takes on either hand have been fallen into, referring to the late Troubles rai&s;ed among us by</HI> Satan, <HI>and his Instruments, through the awful Judgments of God, he would Humble us therefore, and Pardon us.</HI> After that tho&s;e our Honourable Judges (fearing lea&s;t wrong &s;teps might have been taken) had thus &s;et apart a <HI>Day</HI> for &s;olemn Humiliation before the Lord, humbly Implo|ring
<PB N="7" REF="000975_0006_0FAE8C6F8EE52410">
His Pardon for what might have been done ami&s;s; for him to <HI>Repeat that matter,</HI> and &s;et it out with imperfect Relations and odious Aggravations, thereby intending to ren|der the Land, and the Judges obnoxious (tho' all the Learning that he and wi&s;er men than he, pretends unto, is in&s;ufficient to dive to the Bottom of the matter;) and for him to &s;peak as he does of tho&s;e Honourable Per&s;ons, (as you will find in his praeface,) <HI>as men ob&s;tinate in an Error, and involved in the guilt of the Blood &s;hed by Pagans and Papi&s;ts before them:</HI> what &s;hall we think of it, but that 'tis inhumane, and fit for none but a <HI>Servant</HI> of the wor&s;t Ma&s;ter? One would have thought, that the <HI>Fear of God</HI> (if he has any) &s;hould have darted that Scripture into his mind, (while compiling &s;uch a Pam|phlet) Exod. 22.28. <HI>Thou &s;halt not &s;peak Evil of the Ruler of thy People.</HI></P>
<P>But then, for the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI>; we do admire with what face he dares &s;o wilfully to Reproach, and Libel the Servants of Chri&s;t? How dares he affirm (as p. the la&s;t, of his preface) <HI>That the Accu&s;ations from the Spectral &s;ight, being the chief Evidence again&s;t tho&s;e that Suffered, were up|held both by Magi&s;trates and Mini&s;ters, &s;o long as they apprehended them&s;elves in no danger; and then, though they could Defend neither the Doctrine for the Practice, yet none of them have in &s;uch a Publick manner, as the Ca&s;e requires Testified a|gain&s;t

either.</HI> 'Tis well known by tho&s;e who have ever read over the <HI>Wonders of the Invi|&s;ible World, Enchantments Encountred,</HI> p. 6. that the Judgment of the Mini&s;ters was, <HI>That the Daemons might impo&s;e the Shapes of Innocent per|&s;ons in their Spectral Exhibitions.</HI> And it was the advice of the Elders to the Governour and Council, in the beginning of the <HI>Salem</HI> Trou|bles, Expre&s;t in &s;uch words as tho&s;e, <HI>Ench. Enc.</HI> p. 15. <HI>That Pre&s;umptions whereupon per&s;ons may be Committed, and much more Convictions where|upon per&s;ons may be Condemned as guilty of Witch|crafts, ought certainly to be more Con&s;iderable, than barely the Accu&s;ed per&s;ons being Repre&s;ented by a Spectre, unto the afflicted, nor are alterations in the &s;ufferers by a Look, or a Touch of the Accu&s;ed, to be e&s;teemed an Infallible evidence of Guilt, but frequently liable to be abu&s;ed by the Devils Leger|demains.</HI> And a Book Compo&s;ed by the Re|verend Prae&s;ident of the Colledge, was after|wards Publi&s;hed for that purpo&s;e, whereunto, Fourteen Reverend Mini&s;ters &s;et their hands. But this is not all, for the whole Body of the Mini&s;ters in the Countrey are charged, as <HI>Guil|ty of Sacriledge in the highe&s;t Degree, if not Direct Bla&s;phemy, and Diabolical Wickedne&s;s.</HI> [p. 155.] El&s;ewhere he vilely endeavours, to charge them with an Opinion, <HI>That there are more Almighties than one, and that Satan is Almighty, and can do what he plea&s;es,</HI> He in&s;inuates, that our

Reverend Mini&s;ters make the Devil an <HI>Indepen|dent Being,</HI> and (as he &s;ayes) <HI>Con&s;equently a God.</HI> An abominable Charge! Certainly he was altogether unmindful of that Scripture, Deut. 33.11. <HI>Of Levi, he &s;aid, Lord &s;mite thro' the Loins of them that ri&s;e up again&s;t him.</HI> That there &s;hould be any in the mid&s;t of us, that by publi&s;hed Libels go about thus to render the worthy Pa&s;tors of the Flocks of Chri&s;t odious to them, is matter of Grief unto <HI>us</HI>; and no doubt but 'tis &s;o to <HI>all Good men.</HI> It was highly rejoyc|ing to us, when we heard that our <HI>Book-&s;ellers</HI> were &s;o well acquainted with the Integrity of our Pa&s;tors, as not one of them would admit of any of tho&s;e <HI>Libels</HI> to be vended in their &s;hops. And it was our Hope that a <HI>further Te&s;timony</HI> would have been born by others again&s;t &s;uch pernicious attempts to blow up the Religion of God among us. But the doing of a piece of Ju&s;tice to our own Reverend &amp; Faithful Pa&s;tors, whom Satan hath &s;ingled out (by this In&s;tru|ment) <HI>above others</HI> to &s;pit his Venome upon, is that which in a more e&s;pecial manner has obliged us thus to appaer Publickly.

<P>We mu&s;t therefore give this true Te&s;ti|mony of our much E&s;teemed and Beloved Brother, Mr. <HI>Increa&s;e Mather,</HI> That with in|violate Integrity, excellent Prudence, and unfainting Diligence, he hath managed the great bu&s;ine&s;s committed to his Tru&s;t.

His proceedings have been with that Caution and Circum&s;pection, as is cor|re&s;pondent to the weight of his Commi&s;&s;ion; he with Courage, and Con&s;tancy has pur&s;ued the noble &s;cope of his employment, and un|der&s;tanding the true moment of things, has preferred the Fablick Good to the vain con|ceits of &s;ome, that more might have been ob|tained if peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted on; Con&s;idering open oppo&s;ition and &s;ecret arts that have been u&s;ed to fru&s;trate the be&s;t endeavours for the Intere&s;t of <HI>New-England,</HI> the happy i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e things is &s;uperiour to our Expectations.

<P>And when The&s;e, with more Brethren, came to us, with an offer to do, what they have now done, though we could not but heartily Thank them for their Affection to us, [<HI>The Lord give Mercy to them and their Hou&s;es, who were not A&s;hamed of our Cau&s;e</HI>!] Yet we had never permitted them to do it, if it had not been for <HI>This</HI> Con&s;ideration; That albeit there was little Hazard, that the Dirt, of our <HI>Adver&s;aries Book</HI> (which we <HI>bind as a Crown unto us</HI>) would at all &s;o &s;tick as to Damnify our precious opportunities, to Glo|rifie our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in this Countrey, where we have been known from our Child|hood; but the poor man (whom we heartily pity) and his Book, had only made them|&s;elves <HI>Loath&s;ome</HI> to all <HI>Sober People</HI>: Never|thele&s;s the Dirty Book, was carried abroad unto &s;ome of the <HI>I&s;lands,</HI> where it was more needful for us to have our Friends furni&s;hed with our <HI>Vindication</HI>: And we were al&s;o &s;en|&s;ible, That there were many Good men, who would be glad of being informed in many <HI>Particulars,</HI> which are brought now to light.</P>
<P>But even in this matter al&s;o, we were grown &s;omewhat <HI>Cold,</HI> until &s;ome would have
