<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE duties of a &s;oldier obliged the Marquis de Cl&eacute;mire to quit his family and join the army. His Lady retired to her e&s;tate at Champcery, in the re|mote&s;t part of Burgundy, accompanied by the Ba|ronne&s;s her mother, and the Abb&eacute; Fr&eacute;mont, who was tutor to her &s;on Cae&s;ar&punc; a youth of about ten years old. Pulcheria was about &s;even years of age, and her &s;i&s;ter Caroline eighteen months older.</P>
<P>Champcery &s;oon became agreeable to its inhabitants; the children wondered why they were &s;orry to leave Paris; to give variety to their amu&s;ements, the Ba|ronne&s;s and Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, after &s;upper, that is, from half after eight to half after nine, promi&s;ed to relate <HI>Tales for their recreation and in&s;truction:</HI> This gave the children great plea&s;ure, and occa&s;ionally introduced conver&s;ations highly entertaining and in|&s;tructive.</P>
<P>One day, after dinner, Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, having a letter to write, left her children in the hall with the Abb&eacute; during the hour of recreation: in a quarter of an hour, having fini&s;hed her letter, &s;he returned, and perceived Caroline and Pulcheria &s;itting together read|ing in a corner.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="020385_0003_0FAF01BCC4A61040">
What are you reading there, my dears? &s;aid Ma|dame de Cl&eacute;mire.</P>
<P>It is a book, mamma, that Mademoi&s;elle Julien|ne has lent us.</P>
<P>Mademoi&s;elle Julienne, is &s;he capable of directing you in the choice of books! And be&s;ides, ought you to borrow books without informing me?</P>
<P>That's what I told the&s;e young ladies, &s;aid the Abb&eacute;, who was playing at che&s;s, with the Curate, at the other end of the room, but they would not be|lieve me. Ma&s;ter Cae&s;ar is more rational, he is over|looking our game, and reading the <HI>Journal de Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Let me &s;ee what book it is, &s;aid Madame de Cl&eacute;|mire.</P>
<P>It is <HI>Le Prince Percinet,</HI> &amp; <HI>La Prince&s;&s;e Graci|ou&s;e,</HI> mamma.</P>
<P>A Fairy Tale! &s;aid the Baronne&s;s. How can you be plea&s;ed with &s;uch a book?</P>
<P>I &s;ee, mamma, I have done wrong; but I confe&s;s I am fond of fairy tales; they are very amu&s;ing; they are &s;o marvellous, &s;o extraordinary, and have &s;o many changes from cry&s;tal palaces to golden ca&s;tles, that it's quite delighting to read.</P>
<P>But don't you know that all the&s;e miracles are fal&s;e.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, mamma; they are fairy tales.</P>
<P>How does it happen, that this idea does not di&s;|gu&s;t you then?</P>
<P>We own, mamma, the &s;tories you tell us are a thou&s;and times more intere&s;ting. I could hear them for ever, and I &s;hould &s;oon be tired of fairy tales.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="020385_0004_0FAF01BD2AA999B0">
But if you are &s;o fond of the marvellous, you might far better fatisfy that inclination by reading books which are in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>How &s;o, mamma?</P>
<P>It is your ignorance only, that makes you &s;uppo&s;e the marvellous exi&s;ts no where but in fairy-tales. Nature and art afford phaenomena as &s;urpri&s;ing, as the mo&s;t remarkable incidents in <HI>Prince Percinet.</HI></P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, mamma?</P>
<P>I will prove it is; and for that purpo&s;e undertake to write a tale the mo&s;t &s;triking and &s;ingular you e|ver heard; the marvellous of which &s;hall all be true.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar, who had overheard in part the conver&s;ation, left che&s;s and the <HI>Journal de Paris,</HI> and approach|ing Madame de Cl&eacute;mire &s;aid, are you in earne&s;t, mamma?</P>
<P>You &s;hall judge your&s;elf: I mu&s;t have imaginary per&s;ons, and fabulous incidents; but ob&s;erve <HI>the mar|vellous &s;hall all be true:</HI> every thing that &s;hall wear the face of prodigy or enchantment I will take from nature; the events &s;hall be &s;uch as either have hap|pened, or do daily happen at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Well, that now appears incredible.</P>
<P>But I am &s;ure of one thing, mamma; which is, that you will have no chry&s;tal palaces, with pillars of diamond, in your tale.</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ince you defy me to it, I will have chry&s;tal palaces, with pillars of diamond; and what's more, a city all of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>What, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of magic, fairies, and necromancers!</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="020385_0005_0FAF01BDCF955588">
Yes, without magic, fairies, or necromancers; with other events &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>I &s;hall never recover from my amazement&punc; Dear, dear, how impatient I am to hear your tale, mam|ma!</P>
<P>It will take me three weeks at lea&s;t to write it, for I mu&s;t look over &s;everal voyages and works of natural hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>What can you find in tho&s;e in&s;tructive books, things more marvellous than in Prince Percinet? How does it happen then, that fairy tales are not out of fa&s;hion?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e the kind of tales I &s;peak of, require pre|vious knowledge, which is only to be gained by &s;tu|dy.</P>
<P>But how then, mamma, &s;hall we be able to un|der&s;tand your tale?</P>
<P>I will employ no technical terms, and only relate the effects without explaining their cau&s;es; &s;o that if you had not been told it &s;hould be all truth, you would have &s;uppo&s;ed it ab&s;olutely a fairy tale; but you mu&s;t wait three weeks, during which time our evening and morning &s;tories &s;hall all be &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>O dear, O dear, three weeks!</P>
<P>Do your&s;elves ju&s;tice, Caroline and Pulcheria; have I not forbid your ever looking in a book that was not given you, either by me or your grand|mamma.</P>
<P>That is very true, and we de&s;erve a longer pe|nance.</P>
<P>The three weeks being expired, Madame de Cl&eacute;|mire promi&s;ed, in the evening, to read them the tale
<PB N="vii" REF="020385_0006_0FAF01C03087DBD0">
&s;he had written. After &s;upper they ran immediately into the hall, and Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, &s;itting by the &s;ide of a table, took her manu&s;cript from her pocket.</P>
<P>Before I begin, &s;aid &s;he, you ought to recollect, that I have undertaken chiefly to relate extraordinary, yet po&s;&s;ible events; incidents which to you &s;hall ap|pear incredible, but which, however, have, or might have, all happened: in a word, phaenomena, the ex|i&s;tence of which, pa&s;t or pre&s;ent, is well proved. I have only invented the plot of the &s;tory, that is to &s;ay, the &s;ole part which to you &s;hall appear credible; while all that you will think marvellous, all that will recall to your minds your fairy tales, is preci&s;ely true and natural</P>
<P>O, that will be charming!</P>
<P>You will think my <HI>incredible truths,</HI> a thou&s;and times better than your common well confirmed <HI>every day truths.</HI></P>
<P>But what, mamma, mu&s;t we continually believe what we cannot comprehend?</P>
<P>Do not think your&s;elf humbled by that, Cae&s;ar; that is a de&s;tiny common to manhood, as well as to infancy; our capacities are too confined to compre|hend all the truths which are demon&s;trable; and it would be ab&s;urd to affirm a thing does not exi&s;t, be|cau&s;e it is beyond the limits of our under&s;tandings. Let us not adopt errors, but let us not give way to that vain and ridiculous pre&s;umption which rejects, with di&s;dain, and without examination, every thing that rea&s;on cannot conceive.</P>
<P>Well, mamma, you have told us that every thing in your tale is well authenticated; therefore we may
<PB N="viii" REF="020385_0007_0FAF01C140C75F10">
blindly believe and take the facts for granted, and that is as much as I de&s;ire.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to under&s;tand what I hear, mamma; and therefore &s;hall be glad of your explanations.</P>
<P>I will willingly explain whatever I can; but that will not be much. I am not learned: be&s;ides, as I have &s;aid, there is an infinity of phaenomena in exi&s;t|ence, of which the mo&s;t learned men cannot explain the cau&s;es.</P>
<P>And will you interrupt your tale, mamma, at each marvellous circum&s;tance, to give us an explanation?</P>
<P>O no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for, as you may well think, &s;uch interrup|tions would &s;poil my &s;tory. I have written notes, which we will read with attention another time. At pre&s;ent; if you will li&s;ten, I will begin.</P>
<P>Ay, that we will, willingly, dear mamma. So &s;aying, they drew their chairs neare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to Madame de Cl&eacute;mire&punc; who opened her manu&s;cript, and read aloud the following tale:</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALPHONSO, the hero of my hi&s;tory, was born in Portugal. His father, Don Ramirez, en|joyed riches and preferment becau&s;e he was a favor|ite. Born of an ob&s;cure family, but with a &s;ubtile intriguing, and ambitious character he introduced him&s;elf at court, found protectors, formed partizans, and became at la&s;t the idol of his &s;overeign. The young Alphon&s;o was educated at Li&s;bon, in the &s;umptuous palace of his father: an only &s;on to the
<PB N="10" REF="020385_0009_0FAF01C2573C3A18">
riche&s;t and mo&s;t powerful man in the kingdom, adu|lation kneeled at his cradle, accompanied and cor|rupted his youth.</P>
<P>Don Ramirez, occupied by great projects and lit|tle cabals, could not be at the &s;ame time an a&s;&s;iduous courtier and a vigilant father; he was therefore o|bliged to commit the care of his &s;on's education to &s;trangers. Alphon&s;o had teachers of languages, hi|&s;tory, geography, mathematics, mu&s;ic, and drawing, all of whom wondered, or pretended to wonder, at his prodigious capacity and &s;trength of genius. Not|with&s;tanding which, Alphon&s;o learnt little, except to draw flowers, and play a few airs on the guittar.</P>
<P>This was &s;ufficient to charm all the ladies of the Court, e&s;pecially when he gave them to under&s;tand he was al&s;o a profound mathematician, an excellent naturali&s;t, and a great chymi&s;t. Neither did he tell them any thing he did not him&s;elf believe; for his governor, his teachers, his valets, and the croud of complai&s;ant people that paid their court to his father, all declared he was a miracle, &s;o repeatedly, he could not doubt of its being a certain fact.</P>
<P>He not only &s;uppo&s;ed him&s;elf the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ed young man at Court, by his talents, beauty and knowledge, but he likewi&s;e believed his birth to be as illu&s;trious as his fortune Don Ramirez, during his lei&s;ure moments, had invented a li&s;t of his forefathers, as far back as the fabulous times of Lu&s;us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Portugueze were anciently called Lu&s;itanians, from Lu&s;us, or Ly&s;ias, one of their kings, who, accord|ing to the fable, was either the &s;on or companion of Bac|chus.</NOTE>; which
<PB N="11" REF="020385_0010_0FAF01C3130172B0">
genealogy, every body but his &s;on laughed at; the world is not apt to credit old titles, never heard of till the pretended owner is become rich. Alphon&s;o, however, too vain not to be credulous on &s;uch a &s;ub|ject, &s;aw no one &s;uperior to his father, except his &s;o|vereign, and the branches of the royal family; and yet Alphon&s;o, inebriated with pride, full of ignorance, folly, and pre&s;umption, &s;poilt by pomp, flattery, and fortune's favours; Alphon&s;o, I &s;ay, was yet not lo&s;t pa&s;t retrieving: he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage, a feeling heart, and a good under&s;tanding; and the incon&s;tancy of fortune was preparing a le&s;&s;on, that would teach him to know him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As Don Ramirez owed his elevation only to in|trigue, &s;o a new intrigue unexpectedly changed his de&s;tiny; he was di&s;graced and &s;tript of all his em|ployments, ju&s;t as Alphon&s;o was &s;eventeen. This unfore&s;een revolution not only deprived Don Rami|rez of titles that flattered his pride, but al&s;o of a great part of his wealth; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was one of tho&s;e little ambitious people, who equally regret titles and riches: be&s;ides he was in debt, and his di&s;grace made his creditors as pre&s;&s;ing and importunate, as they had been formerly moderate and forbearing; in fine, Don Ramirez &s;aved nothing of all his fortune, except his magnificent palace at Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>It is true, that this palace contained immen&s;e rich|es, in furniture, plate, paintings, and e&s;pecially in di|amonds&punc; all which Don Ramirez only waited for a favourable opportunity to &s;ell, when a dreadful ad|venture happened, which gave the fini&s;hing &s;troke to his misfortunes. He had not yet ventured to tell his
<PB N="12" REF="020385_0011_0FAF01C3E92222D8">
&s;on, that the &s;tate of his affairs forced him to &s;ell his palace, and return in the country. At la&s;t he determined to declare his real &s;ituation, and accord|ingly &s;ent for him one morning, to open his heart to him on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were alone, tell me, Alphon&s;o, &s;aid Don Ramirez, what effect has my di&s;grace and the lo&s;s of my fortune had upon you? I have always thought, my father, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, from having al|ways heard, during your pro&s;perity, that never mi|ni&s;try was &s;o glorious as your's, nor ever mini&s;ter &s;o loved and re&s;pected by a nation: the love of the people, therefore, and the glory you have acquired, ought to con&s;ole you for your unju&s;t di&s;grace. Be|&s;ides, you have many friends, who, no doubt, will all return as u&s;ual, the moment you &s;hall wi&s;h them &s;o to do. Don Nugnez, Don Alvarez, and many others, whom I have met, have all prote&s;ted as much to me; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">everal of them have even told me, that they have only &s;eemed to ab&s;ent them&s;elves, the better to &s;erve you in &s;ecret; add to which, you &s;till have an immen&s;e fortune, and an illu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s birth; and in &s;pite of the &s;nares of envy, will ever remain the fir&s;t peer of the realm.</P>
<P>You are deceived, Alphon&s;o, interrupted Don Ra|mirez; what, are you ignorant that the name of my father was ab&s;olutely unknown?</P>
<P>I know it was replied Alphon&s;o; but I al&s;o know that the old titles which you have re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed in our fa|mily, make it equal to any in the kingdom. You your&s;elf, my father, have deigned to read tho&s;e pre|cious
<PB N="13" REF="020385_0012_0FAF01C753552860">
proofs of honour, which are contained in the ca&s;ket that is locked up in your cabinet.</P>
<P>Don Ramirez li&s;tened and &s;ighed; he had had the ridiculous vanity to purcha&s;e a genealogy, and never &s;ufficiently felt, till his di&s;grace, how &s;uperfluous, unworthy, and contemptible is &s;uch deceit. At la&s;t he &s;aw what flattery till then had hidden, which was, that, except his &s;on, every body knew his birth, and laughed at his &s;illy preten&s;ions. He wi&s;hed to unde|ceive Alphon&s;o, but could not re&s;olve to confe&s;s a fal&s;ity which mu&s;t make him appear &s;o mean.</P>
<P>He was in this mournful perplexity and &s;ilence when he was &s;uddenly &s;taggered, and &s;aw Alphon&s;o reel; the colour for&s;ook his cheeks, and he ro&s;e; &s;ave your|&s;elf, my father, cried Alphon&s;o, &s;upport your&s;elf on my arm, follow&mdash;come&mdash;</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he impetuou&s;ly hurried his father away; at the &s;ame in&s;tant a thou&s;and confu&s;ed cries were heard; they ran towards the &s;tair-ca&s;e, and as they ran, the floor opened beneath the feet of Alphon&s;o, who, that he might not drag his father down to de|&s;truction, quitted the arm of Don Romirez, in&s;tantly &s;unk, and &s;eemed buried in the ruins.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o had the good fortune, however, to be only &s;lightly wounded; he ro&s;e, and found him&s;elf in his father's cabinet: among&s;t the rubbi&s;h which &s;urrounded him, were two ca&s;kets, one containing the jewels of his father, the other, the &s;o much vaunted genealogy. Alphon&s;o did not he&s;itate: willing to &s;ave, amid&s;t this dreadful di&s;a&s;ter, that which appeared to him mo&s;t precious, he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ized the box of titles, and fled into the garden; but recol|lecting
<PB N="14" REF="020385_0013_0FAF01C860991F90">
the danger of his father, was determined, at the hazard of his life, again to enter the hou&s;e, when he heard Don Ramirez calling him at the other end of the garden.</P>
<P>It was not without difficulty they rejoined each other; the earth on which they trod, like the &s;ea a|gitated by a violent tempe&s;t, ro&s;e in mountains, or &s;unk in dreadful vallies beneath Alphon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o's feet. His ear was &s;truck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;ubterranean found, like the roar|ing of waves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> breaking upon the rocks; he &s;taggered, fell, got up, and fell again, and, unable to keep upon his feet, crept on all &s;ours, with great difficulty, towards his father. He &s;aw the earth o|pen on all &s;ides, and forming gulphs, whence i&s;&s;ued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire and flame, which ro&s;e and vani&s;hed in the air; the heavens became dark, the pale and livid lightning pierced through the black clouds that covered them, the deep thunders rolled, and Alphon&s;o beheld the bolts of heaven ready to fall upon his head, and hell opening beneath his feet.</P>
<P>Often when he imagined him&s;elf within a &s;tep of his father, a new &s;hock threw them at a di&s;tance; the &s;weat ran down his face, his cloaths and hair were covered with &s;and and du&s;t: yet, amid&s;t the &s;cene of horrors, he never abandoned his dear ca&s;ket; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he imagined Don Ramirez would receive it with tran&s;port: that idea &s;u&s;tained his courage and his &s;tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gth. At la&s;t he rejoined his father, who re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eived him with open arms, though with an aching heart. Oh my father! cried Alphon&s;o, look, I have &s;aved the ca&s;ket.</P>
<P>The jewels! ha&s;tily interrupted Don Ramirez.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="020385_0014_0FAF01C91CD4A168">
No, no, replied Alphon&s;o; I knew better how to chu&s;e; it is your genealogy.</P>
<P>Don Ramirez, in dreadful con&s;ternation, rai&s;ed his eyes to heaven: I am ju&s;tly puni&s;hed, &s;aid he, for my ridiculous vanity. He could &s;ay no more, his tears interrupted his &s;peech. Alphon&s;o, too much prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and agitated to comprehend the meaning of the&s;e words&punc; continued in his former error, and thought only of &s;aving his father. A moment's calm left them time to con&s;ider the mournful objects that &s;urrounded them.</P>
<P>They &s;at down oppo&s;ite their palace, now half de&s;troyed: that magnificent palace, built within the la&s;t ten years, that palace &s;o new, &s;o rich, &s;o admir|ed, is now only a heap of ruins. He who had be|held the bare walls, the mouldered columns, the gla&s;sle&s;s windows, mu&s;t have believed that time alone could have produced &s;o terrible a revolution! Ages &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy a monument built with &s;o much &s;olidity, and yet the fearful de&s;truction is the work of a few minutes!</P>
<P>The garden too, that ma&s;ter-piece of art and na|ture, is now an unmeaning chaos of du&s;t, mud, and mouldered leaves. In the morning there was &s;een a &s;uperb ca&s;cade, where is it now? In the very &s;pot where an artificial mount was rai&s;ed, at a prodigious expence, gapes a dreadful gulph. What are become of the citron groves, the marble &s;tatues, the va&s;es of alaba&s;ter and of porphyry? A few ve&s;tiges &s;till re|main, a few broken fragments; the re&s;t is &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t!</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="020385_0015_0FAF01C9DE2CF9C0">
Don Ramirez looked at the &s;urrounding di&s;&s;olution; he was &s;itting near a little wood that had ri&s;en be|neath his own eyes; the trees are all torn up by the roots, &s;cattered here and there, buried or extended in the mire: tho&s;e trees, de&s;tined to &s;urvive the hand that planted them, are torn from the bo&s;om of the earth, with as much ea&s;e and rapidity, as the verdure and yielding flowers that grew beneath their &s;hade.</P>
<P>Oh! day of horrors! cried Don Ramirez aloud, loft labours, trea&s;ures interred in this place of terrors; why did not I make a better u&s;e of the money this building and this garden have co&s;t? But the earth|quake is abated (2), let us endeavour to regain the ruins, let us &s;ave my diamonds, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he aro&s;e, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant a new and dreadful &s;hock extended him again upon the ground: the remaining walls tumbled, the rubbi&s;h was ingulfed, and the palace di&s;appeared; a whirl|wind, and cloud of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">moke and du&s;t ro&s;e as it were at his feet; yet, amid&s;t this &s;cene of de&s;olation, Don Ramirez perceived a moment after a band of harden|ed wretches, bearing lighted torches, and creeping towards the ruins of the palace, with an intent, be|fore the la&s;t &s;hock, to pillage (3).</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o wi&s;hed to puni&s;h &s;uch unbridled villainy, and would have ru&s;hed upon them, had not his father caught and retained him in his arms. Oh! my &s;on, &s;aid Don Ramirez, bathing him with a deluge of tears, let us fly from this &s;cene of horrid de&s;truction; we are near the banks of the Tagus, let us &s;eek &s;hel|ter and &s;afety on board the &s;hips.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="020385_0016_0FAF01CA988AF580">
Alphon&s;o gave one arm to his father, held the ca&s;ket in the other, left the garden, and entered one of the public &s;quares: the hou&s;es were all in ruins, overthrown, or con&s;umed, by the flames of a general conflagration. After a thou&s;and fearful ri&s;ks, Don Ramirez and the young Alphon&s;o, at la&s;t, found pro|tection on board a ve&s;&s;el, commanded by the brave and generous Fernandes. The &s;ame Fernandes, who formerly had &s;o much cau&s;e to complain of Don Ra|mirez, but who, in this time of public calamity, &s;aw, only, in an ancient enemy, an unhappy man, to whom his a&s;&s;i&s;tance was become nece&s;&s;ary. He ran to Don Ramirez, embraced and con&s;oled him; for compa&s;&s;ion in great minds is &s;o forcible and &s;o delicate, that it can &s;often woes the mo&s;t cruel. In the mean time, as Fernandes did not once bewail his own &s;ituation, Don Ramirez que&s;tioned him concerning it. You had, &s;aid he, a great fortune, is it not all lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t in this dreadful day?</P>
<P>My hou&s;e at Li&s;bon is con&s;umed.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s is, no doubt, con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>No; the building was &s;mall and &s;imple.</P>
<P>Your jewels and diamonds; are they &s;aved?</P>
<P>I had none.</P>
<P>You had a garden.</P>
<P>Yes; but far removed from Li&s;bon, where I pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of my time; it is in Alentejo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A province of Portugal, between the Tagus and the Guadiana. Evora is the metropolis.</NOTE></P>
<P>I have heard of it, and hope to God the earthquake has not ravaged that province. Is your country-hou&s;e a fine one?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="020385_0017_0FAF01CB524B3658">
No; but it is convenient.</P>
<P>Have not you formed &s;ome advantageous e&s;tabli&s;h|ments there?</P>
<P>Some &s;atisfactory ones; a manufactory, and a ho&s;|pital. (Don Ramirez &s;ighed.)</P>
<P>Is your manufactory profitable?</P>
<P>Yes; it gives &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to a number of workmen, and defrays, in part, the expences at the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>I &s;ee you make a worthy u&s;e of your wealth; hea|ven pre&s;erve it to you. It is, indeed, horrible, to be ruined with a benevolent heart, and to be obliged to relinqui&s;h &s;uch honourable, &s;uch glorious e&s;tabli&s;h|ments.</P>
<P>One &s;hould then find con&s;olation in the remembrance of the good one had formerly done.</P>
<P>Don Ramirez again fetched a profound &s;igh, and bitterly regretted the u&s;e he had made of his fortune; his eyes at la&s;t were opened; but too late, alas! ei|ther for his glory or repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus totally ruined, Don Ramirez received from his &s;overeign, thanks to the &s;olicitations of the noble Fernandes, a &s;mall pen&s;ion, though &s;ufficient to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ord the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. With this he determined to retire to the province of Beira, whither he depart|ed with his &s;on, and &s;ettled in an ob&s;cure, but plea&s;ant retreat, on the agreeable banks of the Mondego; but, followed by deep regret, and ince&s;&s;ant recollection, he found not the tranquillity he &s;ought.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o, devoted to ambition, and nothing abated in pre&s;umption and pride, con&s;oled him&s;elf for the lo&s;s of fortune, by the hope, that in time, he &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h a more brilliant, and far more &s;olid one than
<PB N="19" REF="020385_0018_0FAF01CC40829998">
what his father's had been. He formed a thou&s;and extravagant and chimerical projects, the ab&s;urdity of which his ignorance and vanity did not &s;uffer him to perceive: incapable of reflecting and employing his time in a u&s;eful and rational manner, he pa&s;&s;ed a great part of it in reading romances; the&s;e frivolous and dangerous books heated his imagination, and gave him fal&s;e ideas of men and things.</P>
<P>Not far from the retreat he inhabited, was the famous Fountain of Love; a name it owed to two unfortunate lovers, who, in ancient times, often met on its brinks, drawn thither by an imprudent pa&s;&s;ion. There it was that Don Pedro, and the beautiful, the tender Ines, a thou&s;and times di&s;cour&s;ed of their &s;e|cret loves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such is the tradition. This fountain &s;till exi&s;ts in Portugal, near the Mondego, and is called the Fountain of Love. Camoens, in his beautiful poem of the Lu&s;iad, gives birth to this fountain, from the tears which the nymphs of the Mondego &s;hed at the death of Ines.</NOTE>. Two antique palm-trees over&s;haded the Fountain, united to each other by a flexible gar|land of vine branches and ivy. The water ri&s;es im|petuou&s;ly from a maje&s;tic rock, returns in a ca&s;cade, and forms, upon a bed of &s;hells, a large rivulet, which &s;lowly winds, and gently murmurs, among eternal verdures, &s;hrubs of myrtle, of citron, and the laurel ro&s;e.</P>
<P>Thither Alphon&s;o often went to read and ruminate. One morning, happening to go later than ordinary, he heard, as he drew near the Fountain, two per|&s;ons &s;peaking in an unknown tongue: in one of their voices Alphon&s;o found an inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;weetne&s;s,
<PB N="20" REF="020385_0019_0FAF01CD071E53A0">
which wonderfully excited his curio&s;ity; he hid him|&s;elf, with emotion, behind a myrtle bu&s;h, through the branches of which he di&s;covered an object mo&s;t worthy of fixing his attention; a young nymph, for &s;o &s;he &s;eemed, &s;carce fifteen, of the mo&s;t perfect beauty, was &s;itting on the banks of the Fountain, be&s;ide a man, who appeared to be her father; to him &s;he was li&s;tening with the utmo&s;t attention, and by her looks it was evident he was reciting &s;ome intere&s;t|ing event.</P>
<P>As he proceeded, he often pointed to the palm-trees and the fountain, whence Alphon&s;o &s;uppo&s;ed he was relating the hi&s;tory of the unhappy Ines. The angelic li&s;tener had fixed her eyes upon the unknown relater, and kept a profound &s;ilence; but, from the expre&s;&s;ion of her countenance, her thoughts might ea&s;ily be divined; curio&s;ity, fear, and pity, were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively painted in her eyes; and with &s;o much energy, that Alphon&s;o imagined him&s;elf was hearing a tale that &s;he was telling; he &s;aw her tears, and wept with her the death of Ines. Pre&s;ently her eyes became &s;uddenly dry, her cheeks pale, and terror and indignation &s;ucceeded to pity. Alphon&s;o &s;hud|dered in &s;ympathy, dete&s;ting the exce&s;s to which pa&s;|&s;ion, and a de&s;ire of vengeance had carried the un|fortunate Don Pedro.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of Ines is ended, and yet the &s;tranger continues &s;peaking; no doubt he is making prudent reflections on the danger of the pa&s;&s;ions, and on the criminal and fatal imprudence of a young woman, who, without the con&s;ent of her parents, dared to chu&s;e for and di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="020385_0020_0FAF01CD90BDFAF0">
The beauteous hearer ran to the arms of the &s;tran|ger, with all the expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;tronge&s;t feeling: then turning her gli&s;tening eyes towards that Foun|tain, which had formerly been a witne&s;s of the in|di&s;creet vows of love; &s;he &s;ighed, fell on her knees, rai&s;ed her cla&s;ped and eager hands to heaven, and &s;eemed to promi&s;e the author of her days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n eternal obedience; her beauty, in that attitude, had &s;ome|thing cele&s;tial and angelic.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o could not contain his extatic tran&s;ports; an exclamation e&s;caped aloud, and fearing to be di&s;|covered, he ha&s;tily fled from his hiding-place, full of the idea of what he had &s;een. He followed the fir&s;t path he found, but pre&s;ently awaking from his dream, again returned towards the Fountain. The beaute|ous &s;tranger was gone, and Alphon&s;o contemplated with grief the place where &s;he had &s;at, and thought he &s;till &s;aw her on her knees before her father. The next moment he remembers her ab&s;ence, his heart is oppre&s;&s;ed, his eyes filled with tears, he is plunged in|to a profound and melancholy meditation, when &s;ud|denly he hears a cry of terror, which pierces him to the very heart.</P>
<P>He runs, he flies; but what does he behold! It is the &s;tranger, alone, pale, di&s;hevelled, and flying from a mad bull that pur&s;ues her. Alphon&s;o darts towards her, &s;eizes her in his arms, and bears her off, at the very moment, when, overcome by the ex|ce&s;s of fear, &s;he was fallen, not ten pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es from the furious animal.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o, charged with a burden &s;o precious&punc; ra|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ly turns a&s;ide behind the palm-trees of the Foun|tain,

and bears her &s;en&s;ele&s;s in his arms in &s;afety upon a high rock.</P>
<P>Here he perceived the father of the &s;tranger, run|ning, wild, and, as &s;oon as he &s;aw his daughter in &s;afety, ble&s;&s;ing God and her deliverer. At the &s;ame in&s;tant the bull returned, and bent his cour&s;e towards the father, who had not time to avoid him, or mount the rock. In vain did Alphon&s;o &s;till hold his &s;en&s;e|le&s;s prize in one arm, and extend the other towards her father; the latter cried aloud to him in Portu|gue&s;e, not to abandon his daughter on that danger|ous &s;ummit, and ran him&s;elf immediately behind one of the large&s;t of the palm-trees of the fountain.</P>
<P>The bull endeavoured to pa&s;s between them; the pa&s;&s;age was narrow, he was in full &s;peed, his body became fixed between the trees, and his head and horns entangled in the fe&s;toons of ivy and vine-trees. The &s;tranger &s;eized the advantage of the moment, drew an etwee ca&s;e from his pocket, opened it, took out a pin, and rain it in the back of the bull; but how great was the &s;urprize of Alphon&s;o! when he heard the bull bellow dreadfully, &s;aw him drop, &s;truggle to ri&s;e, again fall down, and, after a few vain efforts, expire.</P>
<P>Nay now, but &s;ure, cried all the children at once, that is not po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Pardon me, &s;aid Madame Cl&eacute;mire, but it is.</P>
<P>What, mamma! cried Caroline; a bull killed by the prick of a pin!</P>

That thorn was not quite &s;o dangerous as the pin of the &s;tranger.</P>

<P>This &s;eems incredible. Shall we find the expla|nation of this prodigy in your notes?</P>

<P>Alphon&s;o, continued Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, was not le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed than you are, at the &s;udden death of the bull; amazement rendered him motionle&s;s, while the &s;tranger a&s;cended the rock, and took his daughter in his arms, ju&s;t as &s;he began to recover the u&s;e of her &s;en&s;es and look around.

<P>The &s;tranger te&s;tified a lively &s;en&s;e of gratitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> the generous protector of his dear Dalinda <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> was the name of his lovely daughter; and while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;poke, Dalinda ca&s;t a tender glance at Alphon&s;o, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> more expre&s;&s;ive than the thanks of her father.

&s;tranger, concerning the manner in which he had been &s;eparated from his daughter: he replied, that he had been culling &s;imples; that Dalinda, occupied after the &s;ame manner, was at &s;ome di&s;tance from him, but not out of &s;ight; that lifting up his head, he had &s;een her running with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s; that &s;he had already got above &s;ix hundred yards from him, and that at the &s;ame moment be perceived the bull pur&s;u|ing her; that he ran after her with all his power, but had &s;tumbled over the &s;tump of an old tree, and fallen.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed his recital, Alphon&s;o a&s;ked if he intended to &s;tay long in Portugal? No, an&s;wered the &s;tranger, we &s;et off immediately for Spain, being de|&s;irous of &s;eeing as much of that kingdom as po&s;&s;ible. This intelligence threw Alphon&s;o into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation! He hung down his head, and was mournfully &s;ilent; the &s;tranger, after again repeating his thanks and gratitude in the mo&s;t affectionate terms, ro&s;e, took his leave, and di&s;appeared with Dalinda.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o remained, &s;ome time, petrified, and &s;carcely &s;eeming to breathe; at la&s;t, coming to him|&s;elf, he flung impetuou&s;ly from the fountain, and flew to find the &s;tranger once again, to a&s;k him a thou&s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">tions, and e&s;pecially to enquire what was his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what his country.

<P>Overcome with fatigue and de&s;pair, he returned once more to the Fountain. As he drew near, he
<PB N="25" REF="020385_0024_0FAF01D21C3BAD28">
&s;aw &s;omething &s;hining in the path, and approaching, found it was a large blue ribbon embroidered with gold, his heart beat, he knew it to be the &s;carfe of Dalinda. It was in that very place that Dalinda, overcome with terror, had fallen &s;en&s;ele&s;s; and there it was that Alphon&s;o, rai&s;ing her in his arms, had untied the ribbon that girded her wai&s;t.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o affected, &s;tooped with tran&s;port and re|&s;pect, to take up a ribbon &s;o precious; the &s;a&s;h of Dalinda was the ce&s;tus of innocence, and the girdle of the graces. He &s;ighed, and vowed for ever to pre&s;erve a pledge &s;o dear to his heart, which he had thus acquired by chance. In the mean time the hours glided away, Alphon&s;o could not tear him&s;elf from the Fountain; and night and darkne&s;s had &s;urprized him, &s;till plunged in his reverie, if Don Ramirez had not come to &s;earch for him him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Don Ramirez had never taken any part in his &s;on's education; had never a&s;ked, nor ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his confidence. Alphon&s;o did not mention his adventure to him; but, on the contrary, carefully concealed the thoughts and emotions of his &s;oul. Devoted to the romantic ideas which &s;educed his imagination, he had only one plea&s;ure, that of pa&s;&s;ing his hours at the Fountain, where he fir&s;t beheld Dalinda; there every thing recalled the object, which rea&s;on ought to have era&s;ed from his memory; here Dalinda, at the knees of her father, was retraced in his fancy; here, in his fixed thoughts, &s;he &s;till lived in all her bloom of beauty, adorned with every charm of inno|nocence and virtue; near this &s;hrubbery, Dalinda owed to him her life; upon that rock &s;he opened her

eyes, and ca&s;t a look of &s;weet thankfulne&s;s upon Al|phon&s;o; beneath the&s;e palm-trees did &s;he &s;it, and that clear water once reflected her &s;eraphic form.</P>
<P>Thus did Alphon&s;o con&s;ume his days, in vain re|grets upon the dangerous brink of this fatal &s;pring. Such does fable paint the wretched Narci&s;&s;us, a feeble victim of in&s;en&s;ate love; and &s;o did Alphon&s;o, pale, dejected, without force, without courage, fix his eyes, drowned in his tears, upon the Fountain of Love. The echoes of this &s;olitary place, which anciently &s;o often re&s;ounded with the name of Ines, repeat at pre&s;ent, only that of Dalinda. Dalinda is carved upon every tree, even on the very palm-trees, on which formerly Ines alone was read. Alphon&s;o &s;ung to his guittar the ver&s;es he had written on Dalinda, and engraved upon the rocks the rhymes that love and melancholy dictated.</P>
<P>The&s;e romantic follies totally occupied him for &s;ome time: but as the plea&s;ures which rea&s;on di&s;ap|proves are never durable, his imagination cooled by degrees, and weari&s;ome di&s;gu&s;t &s;ucceeded enthu&s;i|a&s;m; his &s;ongs and complaints began to cea&s;e, the echoes of the Fountain became mute, and the trees, the &s;treams, and verdure, no longer could in&s;pire him with poetry and profound reveries.</P>
<P>Don Ramirez ob&s;erved the alteration of body and mind which had happened to his &s;on; he que&s;tioned him, and Alphon&s;o confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf di&s;&s;atisfied and con&s;umed with <HI>ennui.</HI> He had not forgot, that the &s;tranger told him he &s;hould remain &s;ome time in Spain; and Alphon&s;o added, he ardently de&s;ired to travel through, and become acquainted with that

country. Don Ramirez, who, for his own part, had none of tho&s;e re&s;ources in him&s;elf, which make men fond of &s;olitude, gladly &s;eized this propo&s;ition, and two days after they departed for Spain.

<P>Alphon&s;o's pa&s;&s;ion for Dalinda was rekindled by this voyage; the hope and the de&s;ire of once more finding her, acquired new force from thoughts, which an enthu&s;ia&s;tic imagination had at fir&s;t produced. He was impatient to arrive at Madrid, thinking he could not fail to meet her in this metropolis, but Don Ra|mirez would ab&s;olutely remain &s;ome time in Catalo|nia, in order to vi&s;it the famous Mont-Serrat; this mountain, compo&s;ed of &s;teep rocks, is &s;o high, that, when arrived on its &s;ummit, the neighbouring moun|tains that &s;urround it, &s;eem &s;o dimini&s;hed, as to look little more than mole-hils; and the views from thence are the mo&s;t maje&s;tic and exten&s;ive po&s;&s;ible<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid you may &s;ee the i&s;lands of Majorca and Mi|norca from this place, which are more than &s;ixty leagues di&s;tant.

<P>At break of day, Don Ramirez and his &s;on began to a&s;cend Mont-Serrat; the a&s;pect of the mountain, might well have made them renounce their de&s;ign; its prodigious elevation, and the enormous and crag|gy rocks which projected on every &s;ide, promi&s;ed no agreeable walk; but in trave&s;ing the&s;e menacing &s;teeps, delicious vallies, meadows, enamelled with a thou&s;and flowers, thickets formed by the &s;imple hand of nature, and ca&s;cades, which throw them&s;elves from the white and &s;toney ridges with animating tumult, give a thou&s;and varieties, and embelli&s;h this &s;olitude, which is become the fortunate refuge of peace and virtue (5).</P>
<P>Don Ramirez, on entering the de&s;ert, met one of the&s;e Hermits reading as he walked. He was &s;truck by his noble and venerable figure; he pa&s;&s;ed near them, and as Don Ramirez was &s;peaking with his &s;on, the Hermit, hearing the Portugue&s;e tongue, took his eyes from his book, and approached the &s;trangers. He told Don Ramirez, how happy he was once more to meet a countryman, and invited them both to re&s;t a while in his hermitage. The propo&s;ition was gratefully accepted, and the venera|ble Reclu&s;e brought them vegetables and fruit.</P>
<P>After the repa&s;t, Alphon&s;o, de&s;irous of continu|ing his walk, left them, telling his father he would

<P>Don Ramirez, then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Her|mit, &s;aid, what revolution, what cruel rever&s;e of for|tune, my father, can have torn you from your native country, and fixed you in this de&s;ert?

<P>No, replied the Hermit, it has been my misfortune to know the world, and the Court.</P>
<P>The&s;e words in&s;pired Don Ramirez with the mo&s;t ardent curio&s;ity, which the Hermit con&s;ented to &s;a|tisfy.</P>
<P>It imports you but little, &s;aid he, to know my name: I have been twelve years an inhabitant of this mountain. By this time they believe in Portugal that I am dead. I have devoted my&s;elf to oblivion, there|fore I will not &s;peak of my family, but in as few words as po&s;&s;ible relate my deplorable &s;tory.</P>
<P>Madame de Cl&eacute;mire was continuing to read, but the Baronne&s;s gave the &s;ignal of retreat; in vain were &s;everal voices at once heard, entreating for one quar|ter of an hour more; the rule was ab&s;olute.</P>
<P>The following evening Madame de Cl&eacute;mire again opened her manu&s;cript, and &s;aid, we left off ye&s;terday where the Hermit was going to recount his hi&s;tory. Don Ramirez li&s;tened; the Hermit &s;ighed, and thus he &s;aid:</P>
<Q><P>My family is one of the mo&s;t ancient in all Por|tugal. I received a good education, inherited a
<PB N="30" REF="020385_0029_0FAF01D7652E1CB8">
tolerable fortune, and by my &s;ucce&s;s in war, ob|tained the e&s;teem and benefactions of my &s;overeign, married a woman whom I loved, became a father, and of cour&s;e became happy.</P>
<P>Such was my &s;ituation when the late King died. This event deprived me of a beloved ma&s;ter, a protector, and a father; for to a faithful &s;ubject a good King is all the&s;e. I retired from Court to an e&s;tate in the country, and dedicated my time &s;olely to the education of my &s;on. This &s;on, the object of a mo&s;t tender affection, was &s;uperior even to my hopes.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was of an age proper to appear at Court, I entru&s;ted him to the care of a relation, &s;ent him to Li&s;bon, and remained in my country &s;olitude. I was now, for the fir&s;t time, &s;eparated from my &s;on, and yet never was happier. I ima|gined his future &s;ucce&s;s, and indulged the fonde&s;t hopes of his ri&s;ing fame.&mdash;Hope, though the mo&s;t uncertain, the mo&s;t deceitful, is yet, perhaps, the greate&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings, and which the heart of a fa|ther only can properly e&s;timate. When our own intere&s;t produces the flattering illu&s;ion, it is mode|rated, enfeebled, or, perhaps, di&s;pelled by fear; but what father ever yet pre&s;cribed bounds to the hopes he conceived of his &s;on; Alas! I thought to have beheld &s;ome of mine realized!</P>
<P>My &s;on &s;et out with the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;s. His name, his family, my &s;ervices, which his pre|&s;ence brought again to remembrance, but e&s;pecial|ly his under&s;tanding, good temper and accompli&s;h|ments, obtained that re&s;pect at Court, which the
<PB N="31" REF="020385_0030_0FAF01D84EBE4EA8">
jealou&s;y of courtiers looked upon as the beginning of favour.</P>
<P>He &s;aw a young lady of Li&s;bon, who, in addi|tion to per&s;onal attraction, talents, and virtue, was of a noble family, and large fortune. My &s;on a&s;pired to her hand, I approved his choice, and this attachment, authorized by my approbation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ixed the &s;hort de&s;tiny of his life. Her parents con&s;ented to an union, by which his happine&s;s would be en&s;ured, but on condition that he obtain|ed a place at Court. My &s;on a&s;ked a place, and he was promi&s;ed one in three months; it was only required he &s;hould keep his &s;ucce&s;s a &s;ecret, for rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned, till the moment of actual po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion; with permi&s;&s;ion, however, to inform the pa|rents of his mi&s;tre&s;s of the event, which he in&s;tantly did.</P>
<P>He was accordingly pre&s;ented to the young lady as her future hu&s;band, and &s;he, at this interview, thus authorized, confe&s;&s;ed an affection for him, which crowned his felicity.</P>
<P>As the marriage was of cour&s;e deferred, till the period when he &s;hould be in actual enjoyment of his promi&s;ed place, he tore him&s;elf from Li&s;bon, and came to tell me all his happine&s;s. I had then the plea&s;ure to hold in my arms, and pre&s;s to my bo&s;om, the child whom I &s;o dearly loved, and whom I con&s;idered as at the &s;ummit of all his wi&s;h|es. Alas! while I &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf the mo&s;t for|tunate of fathers, a Barbarian, a Mon&s;ter, was forming the black plot, which at once deprived me of wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e and &s;on.</P>

My &s;on's natural candour, prevented him from &s;u&s;pecting the probity of a traitor, who only wi&s;h|ed his confidence, that he might ruin him with greater certainty.

He knew his own a&s;cen|dancy over the King; he calumniated my &s;on, and in&s;pired a young and inexperienced Prince with fal&s;e fears; the gift was revoked, the place given to a creature of this unworthy favourite, and my &s;on exiled the Court. By his Maje&s;ty's order, I was fir&s;t informed of this terrible calamity, which forbade my &s;on to quit his country-&s;eat; and my &s;on, at the &s;ame time, received a letter from the young lady he loved, which contained the&s;e few words:</P>

The Hermit &s;topped, he &s;aw Don Ramirez look wildly round, and ri&s;e from his &s;eat.

<P>Don Ramirez again moved, without an&s;wering; and, after a few minutes, a&s;toni&s;hment and terror made him motionle&s;s; then &s;uddenly &s;tarting&mdash;Where am I! cried he, in what a&s;ylum!</P>

<P>Yes!&mdash;I am that wretch, cried Don Ramirez, ca&s;t|ing him&s;elf at the Hermit's feet, who, penetrated with involuntary horror, drew back. Oh! reverend father; continued Don Ramirez, following on his knees, and &s;eizing his ve&s;t, Stop, hear me, holy man!

<P><PB N="36" REF="020385_0035_0FAF01DBDF6FFD28">
No, Ramirez, an&s;wered the Hermit; &s;eek not for that genero&s;ity in the heart of man, which is not in nature; admire not the feeble Alvarez, but acknow|ledge and adore the high hand of heaven.</P>
<P>Thus &s;aying, he held out his arms, and advanced to embrace Don Ramirez, who&s;e tears bedewed the bo&s;om of the virtuous man; that bo&s;om, which for|merly he had &s;o cruelly torn.</P>
<P>A quarter of an hour after this reconciliation, Alphon&s;o returned to the Hermitage. Don Rami|rez took his leave of the Hermit, and quitted the mountain, bearing with him remor&s;e the mo&s;t griev|ous, and apprehen&s;ions the mo&s;t fearful; he could not remove from his mind, the malediction &s;o &s;olemnly pronounced again&s;t him by Alvarez; he &s;aw its ef|fect already in the lo&s;s of his fortune; and notwith|&s;tanding the generous pardon he had received, he felt him&s;elf too guilty not to dread the wrath of hea|ven, and its inju&s;tice towards the injured Alvarez.

<P>Full of the&s;e melancholy thoughts, Don Ramirez became ab&s;ent, &s;ilent, and gloomy; often as he look|ed at his &s;on, would the tears ru&s;h to his eyes: a vague dread would come over him, and an inexplica|ble terror &s;eize his heart. He no longer felt the happine&s;s of being a father.</P>

They left Catalonia, after having vi&s;ited Tarrago|na and Torto&s;a (6), and went to Madrid, where Alphon&s;o vainly hoped once more to meet Dalinda. He learnt, however, from the de&s;cription he gave of her, &s;he had been there; that her father was a Swede, his name Theli&s;mar; that he intended to remain &s;ome time in Spain, and that he had then taken the route to Grenada.</P>
<P>This intelligence, which he had been careful to procure unknown to his father, gave him an ardent de&s;ire to go to Grenada; and Don Ramirez, who every where carried his inquietude with him, readily con&s;ented to leave Madrid &s;ooner than he had intend|ed.</P>
<P>They went fir&s;t to Toledo, where they &s;aw the Alcazar, or ancient Moori&s;h Palace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is al&s;o an Alcazar or Mori&s;can Palace at Seville, but not &s;o beautiful as that of Toledo.</NOTE>; the architec|ture of which, is a mixture of the Roman, Gothic, and Mori&s;can.

This ho&s;pital contains manufactories and drawing-&s;chools. They educate about two hundred children, to whom they give a habit of labour, and a love of virtue. Old men and women likewi&s;e find an a&s;ylum in this ancient palace, thus con&s;ecrated by religion to &s;uffering humanity (7).</P>
<P>After a &s;hort &s;tay at Toledo, our travellers went to Cordova, in their route to wich they cro&s;&s;ed the Sierra-Morena

<P>Don Ramirez &s;taid three days at Cordova, and con|tinued his journey. Alphon&s;o &s;aw not the walls of Grenada without emotion (10); he flattered him&s;elf he &s;hould find Dalinda in that city, but he did not long pre&s;erve that hope. Notwith&s;tanding the cares of love, he was forcibly &s;truck with the delightful &s;ituation of Grenada, the beauty of it's buildings (11), and the antique and curious monuments, the remains of which, at every &s;tep, recall the remembrance of Moori&s;h magnificence. Alphon&s;o vi&s;ited, with rap|ture, the Alhambra and Generalif, and amu&s;ed him|&s;elf in places full of in&s;criptions and ver&s;es, which retraced to his memory the ancient gallantry of Gre|nada's Kings, the Misfortune's of the Abencerages, the per&s;ecutions and triumphs of a virtuous Queen (12), and all the marvellous adventures with which hi&s;tory and romance abound.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="020385_0038_0FAF01DF988E58B0">
Alphon&s;o, however, more and more unea&s;y about Dalinda and her father, &s;oon learnt they had left Grenada almo&s;t a fortnight, and were gone to Cadiz; and that they talked of &s;taying there &s;ix weeks, and afterwards of embarking for the coa&s;t of Africa. This news afflicted him much; he endeavoured not to per|&s;uade his father to go thither, for Don Ramirez had declared Grenada &s;hould be the la&s;t place he would wander to, and that he would afterwards return to Portugal.</P>
<P>The de&s;ire of travelling, of finding Dalinda, the hope of making a great fortune, ambition, love, and e&s;pecially pride, idlene&s;s, and curio&s;ity, in&s;pired the culpable Alphon&s;o, with the imprudent and cruel re|&s;olution of &s;ecretly flying to Cadiz, and abandoning his father. He felt great unea&s;ine&s;s in coming to this determination, but he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;uch &s;alutary remor&s;e which he could not help feeling, and employed all his powers to find &s;pecious rea&s;ons that might excu&s;e, and even dignify this criminal act.</P>
<P>My father, &s;aid he, has lo&s;t his fortune; he has only a &s;mall pen&s;ion, not &s;ufficient for both of us; in taking half his expence away, I &s;hall double his in|come. I feel I am a charge to him; I even perceive my company is not &s;o agreeable to him as formerly; he is become pen&s;ive and &s;ilent, my conver&s;ation fa|tigues, and my pre&s;ence lays him under re&s;traint. Be&s;ides, in &s;eeking to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf, and emerge from ob&s;curity, is it not for him I labour? If I can procure wealth, to him &s;hall it be dedicated.

Such were the reflections of Alphon&s;o, who &s;igh|ed while thus he rea&s;oned, and his cheeks were be|dewed with tears. Had he con&s;ulted his heart, duty, honour, and rea&s;on would &s;oon have re&s;umed their functions; but he endeavoured to deceive him&s;elf, and he &s;ucceeded; without the power, however, of total|ly &s;tifling the voice of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>He had taken care to &s;educe one of the &s;ervants into his de&s;ign, and had con&s;ulted with him on the means of flight. It was agreed that Alphon&s;o &s;hould go off in the evening; that the &s;ervant &s;hould wait for him at the city gate with two hor&s;es, on which they &s;hould ride without &s;topping as far as Loxe, to which place the &s;ervant knew the road.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o had no money. Certain jewels which he happened to have about him on the day of the earthquake had been &s;aved, all of which his father &s;old, except two diamond rings wich he had given his &s;on. One of the&s;e Alphon&s;o privately &s;old for four hundred pia&s;tres (about &s;eventy guineas) which he thought a &s;um &s;ufficient to make the tour of the world, if he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The day fixed for his flight he pretended a violent head-ache, in order to conceal his own anxiety, and induce Don Ramirez to go betimes to bed. Ac|cordingly, about eight o'clock, his father retired. Alphon&s;o's heart was ready to bur&s;t when he bade him good night, and he ran, and &s;hut him&s;elf in his chamber, whither he was pur&s;ued by his remor&s;e.</P>
<P>Bathed in tears, he wrote to his father, to inform him of the motive of his flight, without mentioning what route he &s;hould take, or his pa&s;&s;ion for Dalinda.
<PB N="41" REF="020385_0040_0FAF01E11F019770">
He &s;ealed the letter, and left it on the table, that his father might find it on the morrow; then wrapping him&s;elf in a countryman's cloak, he put on thick-&s;oled clouted &s;hoes, took a &s;taff in his hand, with his pur&s;e, and a pocket-book that contained his other ring, and Dalinda's &s;a&s;h properly concealed, opened a window, leaped into a court-yard, and went out of a private door, of which he had procured the key.

<P>The darkne&s;s of the night would not permit him to travel as fa&s;t as he wi&s;hed, while the fear of be|ing pur&s;ued, the grief of leaving his father, his in|quietude, remor&s;e, and repentance, all &s;tung him to the heart, and in&s;pired him with a certain in&s;ur|mountable terror, which was doubly increa&s;ed by the blackne&s;s of the night.</P>
<P>He had quitted Grenada about two hours, when he was awakened from his gloomy reverie by a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing phaenomenon: &s;urrounded as it were by the deep, the profound ob&s;curity of night, darkne&s;s in an in&s;tant di&s;appeared, and light the mo&s;t radiant, dazzled the a&s;toni&s;hed eyes of Alphon&s;o. He rai&s;|ed his head amazed, and beheld a globe of bright and &s;hining fire in the heavens, precipitating it&s;elf &s;omewhat horizontally towards the earth, and augment|ing as it fell. It exhibited a thou&s;and dazzling co|lours, and left a long train of light that marked its path in the atmo&s;phere. Having traver&s;ed a part of
<PB N="42" REF="020385_0041_0FAF01E1D5957B70">
the horizon, it began to ri&s;e again by degrees, and &s;hot forth on all &s;ides &s;parks, and blazing &s;heaves, that &s;eemed like va&s;t artificial fire-works. At length the enormous ball opened, and &s;ent forth two kind of volcanos, which formed them&s;elves into two pro|digious rainbows, the one of which vani&s;hed in the north, the other in the &s;outh; the fiery globe be|came extinct, and the mo&s;t impenetrable darkne&s;s in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded to day-light the mo&s;t fervent (13).</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o was forcibly and irre&s;i&s;tibly alarmed by this prodigy. All uncommon accidents are ill omens to a troubled con&s;cience. This was highly &s;o to him; his grief and doubts were doubled, he increa&s;ed his pace to get rid of his fears, and galloped the re&s;t of the night without &s;topping.</P>
<P>At day-break his Valet perceived they had lo&s;t their way, and had &s;truck into a cro&s;s road. Alphon|&s;o looked round, and &s;aw a barren mountaneous coun|try covered with rocks. Unable to di&s;cover any beaten track, he alighted, tied his hor&s;e to a tree, and fol|lowed by his Valet, went towards one of the highe&s;t and neare&s;t rocks, hoping to di&s;cover from its &s;um|mit the town of Loxe, from which he imagined they could not be far di&s;tant.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve his country &s;hoes were clouted with hob-nails all over; and his &s;taff, being a pea&s;ant's, had a thick iron ferrule at the end.</P>
<P>Scarcely had Alphon&s;o proceeded twenty paces upon the rock he meant to a&s;cend, when he felt his feet fixed to the &s;tone! he could not lift! he could not &s;tir them! and his &s;taff, too heavy to move,

&s;tood upright, and &s;eemed to take root on this fatal rock (14)!</P>
<P>Oh, my father! cried he, heaven has undertaken to puni&s;h my ingratitude by a new, an unheard of miracle.</P>
<P>He could &s;ay no more. Remor&s;e, a&s;toni&s;hment, terror overwhelmed him; took away what little &s;trength he had left, made him immoveable and mute, cau&s;ed his hair to &s;tand erect, and &s;pread a death-like palene&s;s upon his cheeks.</P>
<P>Oh dear mamma! cried Pulcheria, is he changed to a &s;tatue?</P>
<P>Not entirely, an&s;wered Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, &s;mil|ing; though he him&s;elf dreaded he was, for that i|dea &s;truck him as well as you.</P>
<P>And well it might, mamma. That invincible power that fixed him to the rock, might make him expect wor&s;e.</P>
<P>However, my dear, that invincible power was not &s;upernatural. You remember I told you, the &s;eem|ingly marvellous in my &s;tory &s;hould all be true.</P>
<P>And yet the globe of fire, and the fatal rock, ap|pear &s;o extraordinary! But tell us, dear mamma, what became of poor Alphon&s;o.</P>
<P>He remained petrified with terror in the &s;ituation I have de&s;cribed, when the &s;ky became covered with clouds, the winds howled in the air, and the rain began to &s;hower. But how was the terror, how was the horror of Alphon&s;o increa&s;ed, when he beheld that dreadful rain! When he &s;aw, what he thought millions of huge round drops of blood, in&s;tantly cover the white rocks that &s;urrounded him; felt them

run in &s;treams from his face, hands, and all parts of his body, and viewed rivers of blood de&s;cend on all &s;ides to the green vallies (15)!</P>
<P>Uncommon terror gave uncommon &s;trength. Al|phon&s;o quitted his &s;taff, which remained erect, plant|ed on the rock, and with violent efforts wrenched his feet from the adhe&s;ive &s;tone, and fell almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the &s;and.</P>
<P>His Valet &s;oon after, &s;hocked with the miraculous &s;hower, came running, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted his ma&s;ter. He had been &s;eeking a track which he had di&s;covered, and, as &s;oon as they could &s;ufficiently recover their &s;trength and recollection, they once more mounted their hor&s;es, and left this &s;cene of horrors.</P>
<P>Arrived at Loxe, he &s;taid two or three hours to re|cover, then ordered mules and a guide, and pur&s;ued his journey. He cro&s;&s;ed Mount Ore&s;peda (16), pa&s;|&s;ed the ancient city of Antequerra, and did not &s;top till he came to Malaga. He arrived without any re|markable accident at Cadiz<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In going to Cadiz, it is nece&s;&s;ary to take a boat at Port Sancta-Maria, a pretty town two leagues from Ca|diz.

<P>As he was going up &s;tairs he heard a female &s;ing|ing, and accompanied by the harp. Alphon&s;o trem|bled, and guided by the &s;ound, approached the door of the appartment whence it i&s;&s;ued. It was &s;ure an Angel &s;inging, and the harmony was heavenly! He could not mi&s;take the voice, it went to his heart. Delighted, ravi&s;hed, a&s;toni&s;hed, he ha&s;tily de&s;cend|ed
<PB N="45" REF="020385_0044_0FAF01E4389BAF18">
the &s;tairs, enquired for the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, que&s;tioned him, and learnt his heart had not deceiv|ed him. Dalinda and Theli&s;mar inhabited the hou&s;e whither he had been conducted by chance.</P>
<P>Tran&s;ported with the di&s;covery he went into the court-yard, was &s;hewn which were the windows of his Love, and then went and locked him&s;elf in his own room, that he might enjoy his unexpected feli|city without re&s;traint.</P>
<P>In the afternoon he &s;ent for a guittar, and in the evening, after &s;upper, planting him&s;elf under Dalin|da's window, with a trembling hand he ventured to &s;trike a few arpeggios. The window opened, and fearing to be overheard by Theli&s;mar, who under|&s;tood Portugueze, Alphon&s;o dur&s;t not &s;ing the ver|&s;es he had written on Dalinda at the Fountain of Love; but, in timid accents, and an irre&s;olute voice, he &s;ang the Torments of Ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>In about a quarter of an hour the window was &s;hut, and on the morrow Alphon&s;o again began to &s;ing, but in vain, it opened no more: and this rigour af|flicted him as deeply, as though it had de&s;troyed hopes that had &s;ome foundation.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o formed a thou&s;and projects relative to his pa&s;&s;ion, and executed none of them. He ardently longed once more to &s;ee Dalinda, but never could de|termine to pre&s;ent him&s;elf as an adventurer. His intention, when he left his father, was to offer him|&s;elf as a companion to Theli&s;mar during his travels, not doubting but his knowledge and talents would make this propo&s;ition very acceptable; and &s;uppo&s;ing
<PB N="46" REF="020385_0045_0FAF01E4FB021440">
likewi&s;e that gratitude, for having &s;aved the life of Dalinda, would put his reception out of doubt.</P>
<P>When pa&s;&s;ion forms projects, it is blind to all ob|&s;tacles, will hear no objections; but fearing all rea|&s;ons which may deter it from what it is previou&s;ly determined to do, it never di&s;covers it's own folly and imprudence till they are pa&s;t remedy.</P>
<P>Full of fear, incertitude, and he&s;itation, Alphon&s;o could re&s;olve upon nothing. He had carefully con|cealed him&s;elf from Dalinda and her father, when one night he was informed that Theli&s;mar had prepared every thing for his departure, and that he was to go on board the <HI>Intrepid</HI> at break of day, which ve&s;&s;el was to carry him to C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uta<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A town in Africa, oppo&s;ite Gibraltar.

<P>This intelligence determined the irre&s;olute Alphon|&s;o; he &s;old his remaining ring, went to the captain of the &s;hip, obtained his pa&s;&s;age, got on board before day-break, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his little cabin. He had not been there a quarter of an hour, before he heard the voice of Theli&s;mar, and pre&s;ently afterwards the anchor was weighed, and the ve&s;&s;el &s;et &s;ail.</P>
<P>Before dinner-time, when the pa&s;&s;engers mu&s;t meet at the captain's table, Alphon&s;o collected force enough to de&s;ire a moment's audience of Theli&s;mar, which was immediately granted; and with an anxiety and agitation impo&s;&s;ible to paint he entered the cabin. Theli&s;mar was alone, and turning his head at the creaking of the door, he beheld Alphon&s;o. He could

not forget the deliverer of his daughter; he in&s;tantly ro&s;e, ran to Alphon&s;o, and embraced him with all the warmth of the mo&s;t tender friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Tran&s;ported with joy, Alphon&s;o felt hope &s;pring in his heart! He an&s;wered the que&s;tions of Theli&s;mar, however, with more embara&s;&s;ment than truth. Afraid to confe&s;s his faults, my father, &s;aid he, had former|ly an immen&s;e fortune; but now, with barely what is nece&s;&s;ary, he lives retired on the peaceful banks of the Mondego. He approves my de&s;ire to travel, and hopes, with the education he has be&s;towed on me, I may become known, and acquire fame, and&mdash;</P>
<P>What is your age! And what are your projects in quitting your country, and your father?</P>
<P>I knew, &s;ir, you were in Spain, heard you intend|ed to go to Africa, and flattered my&s;elf you would permit me to follow you as a companion in your tra|vels.</P>
<P>You were not deceived in me; I mean to traver&s;e a great part of the known world; if you will be the a&s;&s;ociate of my labours, I joyfully con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Here Alphon&s;o, at the height of his hopes, em|braced Theli&s;mar with tran&s;port, and &s;wore never to for&s;ake him.</P>
<P>But, continued Theli&s;mar, my travels will not end le&s;s than three or four years at &s;oone&s;t, how do you know your father will con&s;ent to this long ab&s;ence?</P>

<P>Well, if you love &s;tudy, if, as I have no doubt, you po&s;&s;e&s;s noble and virtuous &s;entiments, you &s;hall find in me a faithful friend, and a &s;econd father, hap|py, too happy, if by my cares and affection I may

&s;hew a part of my gratitude. Dalinda owes her life to you, and your empire over me is ab&s;olute.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o blu&s;hed at the name of Dalinda, and too much affected to reply, was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>I have need, added Theli&s;mar, of con&s;olation, and hope to find it in your friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Of con&s;olation! Are you then unhappy?</P>
<P>I am &s;eparated, and for four years, from objects the deare&s;t to my heart! from my wife and daugh|ter!</P>
<P>From Dalinda!</P>
<P>Yes. I dur&s;t not expo&s;e her to the fatigues and dangers I &s;hall undergo. We travelled through a great part of Europe together, I parted from her at Cadiz, and while we are riding towards the Afri|can coa&s;t, &s;he is returning with her mother into Sweden.</P>
<P>Oh heaven! cried Alphon&s;o in angui&s;h; Africa and Sweden! What immen&s;e! what dreadful di&s;|tance between her and&mdash;you! How I pity you!&mdash;</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o could no longer re&s;train his tears, and the conver&s;ation being interrupted by the entrance of the Captain, Alphon&s;o went into his cabbin to hide and a&s;&s;uage the agitation of his heart In de&s;pair to think he mu&s;t be four years ab&s;ent from Dalinda&punc; he yet was in &s;ome mea&s;ure con&s;oled by the friend&s;hip of her father, and determined to neglect nothing, by which it might be confirmed and increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar put &s;everal que&s;tions to him in the e|vening, and a&s;ked if he under&s;tood the elements of any of the &s;ciences?</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="020385_0048_0FAF01E8E1AF3AE0">
Oh yes, an&s;wered Alphon&s;o, with great &s;elf-&s;uffi|ciency. There is nothing I have not been taught.</P>
<P>Do you know any thing of geometry?</P>
<P>I had a mathematical ma&s;ter ten years.</P>
<P>Have you any acquaintance with natural hi&s;tory and philo&s;ophy?</P>
<P>Every thing of that kind is familiar to me: be|&s;ides, I am pa&s;&s;ionately fond of the arts, under&s;tand mu&s;ic, and delight in drawing. I draw <HI>flowers</HI> charm|ingly.</P>
<P>Flowers! Do you love reading?</P>
<P>Very much.</P>
<P>Your language is not rich in good authors; but you know the Latin?</P>
<P>Oh perfectly! as you may imagine, for my teach|ers &s;aid I con&s;trued Virgil and Horace well at ten years old; &s;o that I left the &s;tudy of the cla&s;&s;ics at twelve, and have not looked at them &s;ince, having had other employment.</P>
<P>And I warrant you left mathematics al&s;o &s;oon after?</P>
<P>I did. I then read generally, and &s;oon began to write ver&s;es.</P>
<P>And from a &s;cholar became a wit. The metamor|pho&s;is is not always &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>

<P>Every body who vi&s;ited my father told me &s;o.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o's an&s;wer made Theli&s;mar &s;mile, and he changed the conver&s;ation. Pre&s;ently afterwards the
<PB N="50" REF="020385_0049_0FAF01E952593C30">
youth retired, per&s;uaded he had given Theli&s;mar a high opinion of his knowledge and genius. The next day Alphon&s;o recollected the adventure of the mad bull, killed by the prick of a pin, at the Foun|tain of Love, and a&s;ked Theli&s;mar the meaning of &s;o extraordinary a death.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar replied, he had that very day received from an old friend ju&s;t returned from America, a poi&s;on, &s;o powerful and &s;ubtle, as to produce the ef|fect of which he had been a witne&s;s; that this friend had given him a ca&s;e, which enclo&s;ed the fatal pin that had been dipped in the poi&s;on, and de&s;igning to make an experiment of its power, he happened to have it in his pocket (17).</P>
<P>But what &s;urpri&s;es me, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, is, that I have never heard &s;peak of this poi&s;on.</P>
<P>I do not think that &s;o very &s;urpri&s;ing, replied Theli&s;mar; for, if I am not mi&s;taken, there are ma|ny other extraordinary things of which you have ne|ver heard.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay there are none, an&s;wered Alphon&s;o, but I dare pre&s;ume their number is very limited; for I have had teachers of all forts, and am not igno|rant; add to which, I have read much, and &s;een and remarked more.</P>
<P>What prompted Alphon&s;o to brag with greater confidence was, he &s;uppo&s;ed he might do &s;o without danger of detection; he looked upon Theli&s;mar as a plain man, who had only one pur&s;uit, that of bo|tany, and imagined him to be exceedingly ignorant of every thing el&s;e; in which he was frequently con|firmed,
<PB N="51" REF="020385_0050_0FAF01EA1F70C078">
by the natural re&s;erve and mode&s;ty of The|li&s;mar.</P>
<P>Here Madame de Cl&eacute;mire &s;topped, put up her manu&s;cript, and ended that evening's entertainment.</P>
<P>The next night, at the u&s;ual hour, after having begged her children not to interrupt her any more by their que&s;tions, Madame de Cl&eacute;mire thus continu|ed her narration.</P>
<P>At length they landed at Ceuta, and Theli&s;mar hired a lodging for him&s;elf and Alphon&s;o, at one of the be&s;t hou&s;es they could find.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o's fir&s;t care on his arrival, was to write to his father a long letter, very contrite and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive. In this he made a faithful confe&s;&s;ion of all his proceedings, implored his pardon, and permi&s;&s;ion to follow Theli&s;mar in all his travels; and as the latter intended to &s;tay at Ceuta long enough for Alphon&s;o to receive an an&s;wer, he conjured Don Ra|mirez to fend his orders in&s;tantly, promi&s;ing they &s;hould be obeyed, be they what they might. Not doubting his father had returned to Beira, his letter was directed accordingly.</P>
<P>Something ea&s;ier, after thus in part relieving his con&s;cience, Alphon&s;o fell into his cu&s;tomary habits, &s;ung, played on his guittar, and drew various flow|ers, which he thought ma&s;ter-pieces, and which he con&s;tantly carried to Theli&s;mar, who, he continued to believe, was highly delighted with his talents.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar &s;ent for him one morning, and &s;aid, as I know you are exceedingly fond of mu&s;ic and drawing, I thought I might do you a favour, by bringing you to &s;ee two very extraordinary children.
<PB N="52" REF="020385_0051_0FAF01EAD6DF4920">
One is a little boy, who draws a&s;toni&s;hingly in your &s;tyle, and the other a girl, who plays charmingly on the harp&s;ichord; come and &s;ee them.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he conducted Alphon&s;o into another room, but desired him to &s;top at the door; for, &s;aid he, youth you know is timid; and as you are a connoi&s;&s;eur, you might di&s;turb them were you too near.</P>
<P>Very true, an&s;wered Alphon&s;o; the girl blu&s;hed as we entered.</P>
<P>And can you then ob&s;erve her emotion, added The|li&s;mar?</P>
<P>Oh very plainly; &s;he can hardly breathe, tho' her bo&s;om heaves.</P>
<P>All this pa&s;&s;ed at the far end of the room from the young arti&s;ts, and Alphon&s;o, happy in the &s;uppo&s;i|tion of his own repute, encouraged the mu&s;ician as &s;he played, calling out <HI>bravo! bravo!</HI> with as much pedantry and pride as any other demi-connoi&s;&s;eur, who &s;uppo&s;es a word like that from him confers fame and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>When &s;he had fini&s;hed her &s;onata, the little mu&s;i|cian made a low court&s;ey; Alphon&s;o applauded, and Theli&s;mar advanced.</P>
<P>Come, &s;aid he, now let us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ee the boy draw&mdash;&s;tand there, behind him, and then you will overlook his work with more ea&s;e. Alphon&s;o followed his di|rections, and remarked, it was odd enough the child &s;hould keep his gloves on, and &s;urpri&s;ing enough that he &s;hould de&s;ign from his own invention, without any drawing to copy from.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="020385_0052_0FAF01EC152B8288">
And yet, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, &s;ee how that flower gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, as it were, and is embelli&s;hed beneath his fingers.</P>
<P>Wonderful! cried Alphon&s;o; a&s;toni&s;hingly cor|rect! Courage, my little fellow! There, &s;hade that outline a little; that's it! The little angel! I de|clare I could not do better my&s;elf.</P>
<P>All the&s;e prai&s;es gave no di&s;turbance to the child, who continued his work without remi&s;&s;ion, except removing it, to ob&s;erve it at a di&s;tance occa&s;ionally, and blowing away the light du&s;t of the crayon.</P>
<P>When the flower was fini&s;hed, Alphon&s;o ran di|rectly to ki&s;s the child, and as &s;uddenly &s;tarted back with an interjection of a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Gently, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, laughing, take care le&s;t you &s;hould demoli&s;h the young arti&s;t.</P>
<P>Good heaven! It's a doll! a figure!</P>

<P>I will break my guittar directly, and burn my drawings.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="020385_0053_0FAF01ECFAE68D60">
That would be wrong, an&s;wered Theli&s;mar. We &s;hould be a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee a man pa&s;s his life in&punc; play|ing on the guittar, and de&s;igning flowers; but no one would blame you, when you u&s;e &s;uch things only as recreations, by way of agreeably &s;aving time which would otherwi&s;e be lo&s;t, and without being proud of &s;uch trifling accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>This le&s;&s;on made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon Alphon&s;o; but it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould receive many more, be|fore a thorough reformation could be effected.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar was ready to depart from Ceuta, yet Alphon&s;o had received no letters from his father: imagining, therefore, that Don Ramirez approved his projects, by his not being in any ha&s;te to recall him home, he determined to proceed with Theli&s;mar.</P>
<P>Some days previous to their departure for the Azore I&s;lands, Alphon&s;o, who had ob&s;erved workmen bu&s;y about rai&s;ing a kind of machine in the garden, the u&s;e of which he did not comprehend, learnt that it was done by the order, and under the direction of Thel|i&s;mar, of whom he therefore enquired its u&s;e. The proprietor of this hou&s;e has told me, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, that the lightning has twice, within the&s;e twenty years, fallen upon, and damaged the building, and I have promi&s;ed him it &s;hall do &s;o no more.</P>
<P>And which way can you prevent it?</P>
<P>By means of the thing you have &s;een.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I do not comprehend.</P>
<P>That I can readily believe; and yet it is not the le&s;s true, that the lightning will now fall at the other end of the garden.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="020385_0054_0FAF01ED1D61A310">
Four or five days after, there was a violent thunder|&s;torm; Theli&s;mar went to the window, and pointing with his cane towards a black cloud, which was &s;een over the hou&s;e, look, &s;aid he, to Alphon&s;o, at that cloud, it is going &s;oon to remove from us, and follow the path which I &s;hall direct: I intend that it &s;hall open, and be di&s;per&s;ed at the end of that walk; &s;o &s;aying, Theli&s;mar rai&s;ed his cane towards the &s;ky, while the cloud &s;eemed obedient to his will, and dur&s;t not depart from the path which he pre&s;cribed in the air; at that in&s;tant he had the appearance of an en|chanter, who, by the power of his magic wand, commanded the elements.</P>
<P>Good God! cried Alphon&s;o, what do I behold! You direct the clouds, and they obey, they go to the &s;pot that you ordain.</P>
<P>You &s;ee them a&s;&s;embled, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, and now they &s;hall de&s;cend, and the lightning &s;hall fall not thirty feet from yonder &s;pot. Scarcely had he &s;poken, before the thunder began to roar, and its bolts were di&s;charged exactly as Theli&s;mar pre&s;cribed (18); who then &s;hut his window, and went out of his room, leaving Alphon&s;o petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>The next day Theli&s;mar, in pre&s;ence of Alphon&s;o, read aloud a letter he had received from Dalinda. Alphon&s;o had by this time learnt the Swedi&s;h language, to the &s;tudy of which he had applied with great a&s;&s;iduity, ever &s;ince he had fir&s;t been told Dalinda was a Swede; and &s;ince he had travelled with Theli&s;|mar, his progre&s;s in that language had been a&s;toni&s;h|ing. He was enchanted at the letter of Dalinda, and could not repre&s;s his feelings while he heard it read;
<PB N="56" REF="020385_0055_0FAF01EDD66FBA88">
he found an inconceivable delight in under&s;tanding words traced by the hand of Dalinda; he heard the ingenuous detail of her thoughts and &s;entiments, and imagined he heard her &s;peaking; he obtained a know|ledge of the goodne&s;s of her heart and under&s;tanding, and that knowledge fixed for ever in the bo&s;om of Alphon&s;o the mo&s;t incon&s;tant of all the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o was very de&s;irous of having the letter in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;eeing Dalinda's writing; but Theli&s;mar, after having read, put it in the drawer of his bureau. Alphon&s;o, with his eyes fixed upon this drawer, heard no longer the di&s;cour&s;e of Theli&s;mar, but fell into a profound mu&s;ing; Theli&s;mar therefore took up a book, and Alphon&s;o recollecting him&s;elf, left the room.</P>
<P>In the evening Alphon&s;o returned to the &s;ame chamber, and Theli&s;mar ri&s;ing as he &s;aw him enter, &s;aid, As you know we &s;hall embark to-morrow morning for the Azores<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Azore I&s;lands are &s;ituated between Africa and America, about two hundred leagues from Li&s;bon.

<P>This bureau enclo&s;ed the letter of Dalinda, and the key was not taken out of the drawer: Alphon|&s;o felt a temptation, which at fir&s;t he did not give

way to; he pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired to open the drawer, and once more read the letter. He felt how much &s;uch an action was to be condemned, and yet, &s;aid he, this is not to pry into the &s;ecrets of Theli&s;mar; he has read me the letter, I &s;hall learn nothing new; I only wi&s;h to &s;ee, to contemplate the writing.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, after various &s;truggles, Alphon&s;o &s;tifled his &s;cruples, approached the bureau, and tremblingly took hold of the key; but &s;carcely had he touched it, before he received a &s;troke &s;o violent that he thought his arm was broken Alphon&s;o terrified, &s;tarted back, and fell into an arm chair. Ju&s;t heaven! cried he, what invi&s;ible hand is it that &s;trikes (19)?</P>
<P>The door opened, and Theli&s;mar appeared; what have you done Alphon&s;o! &s;aid he, with a &s;evere tone of voice.</P>
<P>Oh, &s;ir, replied Alphon&s;o, you, who&s;e &s;upernatu|ral art produces &s;o many prodigies, you &s;urely have the power to penetrate my mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts, read them at the bottom of my heart.</P>
<P>I can read nothing there, an&s;wered Theli&s;mar, that can excu&s;e an act like this. Remember Al|phon&s;o, to betray a tru&s;t is unpardonable, and that a &s;econd fault of this kind would for ever deprive you of my e&s;teem. As for the my&s;terious key, cried Theli&s;mar, it is only ho&s;tile to indi&s;cretion; it &s;trikes none but tho&s;e who would turn it without my leave. I now give you my permi&s;&s;ion to open the drawer, which you may do without danger.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o advanced, as he was de&s;ired, towards the bureau, opened the drawer, and cried, yes, Theli&s;mar, I &s;ee that nothing is impo&s;&s;ible to you;

My &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, affection, and gratitude, will, I hope, render me worthy of your cares. So &s;aying, Alphon&s;o, with a tender and re|&s;pectful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ir, drew near to Theli&s;mar, who only an|&s;wered him by holding out his arms, and embracing him with affection.</P>
<P>The next day, after this adventure, Theli&s;mar and his young travelling companion embarked for the A|zores. After a happy voyage, they landed at the i&s;land of St. George<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Twelve leagues from Angra.</NOTE>, where they re&s;ted for &s;ome days.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar lodged in a &s;mall hou&s;e, the a&s;pect of which plea&s;ed him; the owner was a Swede, who had been &s;ix years in the i&s;land. As they had only one agreeable apartment, Theli&s;mar partook his bed-cham|ber with Alphon&s;o, and had a bed made up for him be&s;ide his own. One night as Alphon&s;o and Theli&s;|mar were in a &s;ound &s;leep, they both awakened, and leaped up at the &s;ame moment; they imagined they felt the violent &s;hock of an earthquake, and fled into a &s;mall garden, whither the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, and &s;everal &s;ervants, who had likewi&s;e experienced the &s;ame &s;en&s;ation, ran for refuge; the latter brought flambeaux, for the darkne&s;s of the night was extreme; and in expectation of a di&s;a&s;ter, like that of Li&s;bon, they remained there in great anxiety for the &s;pace of three hours; not having, however, felt the lea&s;t emo|tion during this whole time, they determined then to

return again to the hou&s;e. Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o did not go to bed, but conver&s;ed till day-break.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o, who now no longer hid the name of his father from Theli&s;mar, and who had often related to him the circum&s;tances of the earthquake at Li&s;bon, did not let this occa&s;ion &s;lip; but again gave a pompous de&s;cription of the magnificent palace of Don Rami|rez, and an emphatic enumeration of the jewels and diamonds he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before that cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>When day began to appear, Theli&s;mar and Alphon|&s;o went to the window, whence they had an exten&s;ive, and mo&s;t unu&s;ual pro&s;pect; how great was their a&s;to|ni&s;hment, to &s;ee the hou&s;e they lived in, and the gar|den totally &s;eparated from the land, and forming a &s;mall i&s;land in the mid&s;t of the &s;ea; they &s;huddered at the danger they had been in, and could not con|ceive by what means the hou&s;e, which had been thrown &s;everal fathoms from the main land, could &s;u&s;tain &s;o violent a &s;hock without being de&s;troyed.

<P>As Theli&s;mar was &s;peaking, his chamber-door o|pened, and the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e entered.

with a particular e&s;teem, and I come to beg you will give me letters of recommendation for my &s;on.</P>
<P>You intend to return into your own country then?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;ir.</P>
<P>What accident fir&s;t brought you out of it?</P>
<P>I was born in an humble condition: but, not|with&s;tanding the &s;mallne&s;s of my income, I found the means to give my &s;on a good education, much &s;uperior to my rank of life. This &s;on an&s;wered my expectations and cares &s;o well, that he obtained by his merit, at five and twenty, an honourable and lu|crative employment. Some time after he fell in love with an amiable, rich young woman, and was upon the point of marrying her, when a dreadful accident obliged me to quit my country. There was a rich merchant who lodged in my hou&s;e; this unhappy man was found one morning murdered in his bed, and his coffers broken open and robbed; all his &s;er|vants were taken into cu&s;tody; and I, of my own accord, delivered my&s;elf into the hands of ju&s;tice. The wretch who had committed the crime was my accu&s;er; I had enemies, and the affair took an ill turn. Thanks, however, to the cares and protect|ors of my &s;on, as they had not &s;ufficient proof, I obtained my liberty: but I could not recover my character, I could not endure to live with ignominy, in a land where I had been generally beloved, and determined to become a voluntary exile. I endea|voured to conceal my intentions from my &s;on; but he gue&s;&s;ed them too certainly from my prepa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tions&punc; I &s;old the little I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and &s;ecretly departed by

Con&s;oled by &s;uch ideas, I endeavoured to &s;upport the exce&s;s of my misfortunes. I travelled in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, and at day-break perceived my&s;elf e|&s;corted, as it were, by a &s;tranger galloping on hor&s;e|back at &s;ome di&s;tance from my carriage; I looked out&mdash;but what was my &s;urprize at the &s;ight of my &s;on; it is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s what I felt; I &s;topt, jumped out of my carriage, and was in&s;tantly in my &s;on's arms.

<P>My duty, an&s;wered he.</P>
<P>But what is thy de&s;ign? &s;aid I, bathing him with my tears.</P>

<P>You, &s;ir, are a father, continued the old man, therefore can ea&s;ily imagine how readily I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ed my&s;elf thus &s;upported to my de&s;tiny. We travelled for &s;ome time before we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ixed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> abode here. My &s;on undertook &s;ome branches of commerce in partner|&s;hip, and bought this hou&s;e, where we have lived in a contented mediocrity.</P>
<P>It was my intention here to have ended my days; but the intelligence which I received about two months &s;ince, has made me change this re&s;olution. My in|nocence at length is fully acknowledged; the mon&s;ter, who had been guilty of the murder, having commit|ted new crimes, was apprehended and condemned. Before his death he publicly acquitted me, by con|fe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to be the murderer. We learnt at the &s;ame time, the young lady my &s;on loved was &s;till un|married. This has made me wi&s;h once more to return

to my native land. We intended to have departed in half a year; but the di&s;a&s;ter of la&s;t night, and the lo&s;s of my hou&s;e, which, though not de&s;troyed, is no longer habitable, mu&s;t ha&s;ten my departure. It is therefore I come to a&s;k recommendatory letters of you, &s;ir.</P>
<P>I will give them you with plea&s;ure, an&s;wered The|li&s;mar, with emotion, and &s;uch as I would give a dear friend or brother. Oh, yes; doubt not but our ju&s;t and beneficent &s;overeign will worthily reward the virtue of your &s;on.</P>
<P>Oh, &s;ir! cried the old man, with tears of joy in his eyes, permit me to bring him hither that he may thank you him&s;elf.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he went out without waiting for an an|&s;wer; and Theli&s;mar turning towards Alphon&s;o, &s;aw him mournfully leaning over a chair, and covering his face with his hands. Theli&s;mar perceived he was weeping; wherefore, &s;aid he, would you hide your tears from me? Let them flow freely, they are an honour to your heart.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar was mi&s;taken: he attributed tho&s;e tears to compa&s;&s;ion, which repentance and bitter remor&s;e made flow. How criminal did Alphon&s;o feel, when he compared his own conduct with that of the young man who&s;e hi&s;tory he had ju&s;t heard. This touch|ing recital had torn his very heart, and made painful and afflictive the &s;weete&s;t of all &s;en&s;ations, the ad|miration of virtue.</P>
<P>The old man returned, leading his &s;on by the hand; Theli&s;mar cla&s;ped the young man to his brea&s;t;

renewed the promi&s;es he had made his father, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, penetrated with gratitude and joy.</P>
<P>Several inhabitants of the i&s;land &s;oon arrived in light boats, to inquire the fate of tho&s;e who inhabit|ed the &s;mall hou&s;e, which they had &s;een &s;o &s;uddenly thrown, as it were, into the &s;ea; they told Theli&s;|mar, that all the neighbouring hou&s;es had been de|&s;troyed, while that belonging to Zula&s;ki (for that was the name of the virtuous young man) had been thus miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o went on board the boats, and de&s;ired to be conducted towards that part of the i&s;land which had &s;uffered lea&s;t from the earthquake. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">arce had they made a quarter of a league, before they were petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment, at beholding eighteen i&s;lands newly ri&s;en from the bottom of the ocean (20).</P>
<P>Ye new creations of a ju&s;t and beneficent God! cried Theli&s;mar; ye new born i&s;les, how does your a&s;pect move my heart! Human indu&s;try will &s;oon make you fertile. Oh, may you never be inhabited but by the virtuous!</P>
<P>After having coa&s;ted along &s;ome of the i&s;lands, Theli&s;mar landed, and was received in a hou&s;e where Zula&s;ki came to rejoin him the &s;ame evening. As Zula&s;ki embarked on board a ve&s;&s;el bound for Li&s;bon, in his return to Sweden, Alphon&s;o committed two let|ters to his care; the one for his father, in which was &s;et down their route, and the places they meant to &s;top at, earne&s;tly conjuring him to write, and inform Alphon&s;o of his will and plea&s;ure; the other for a young man, who lived in the province of Beira, whom

<P>Zula&s;ki, after receiving the&s;e letters and tho&s;e of Theli&s;mar, departed without delay; and a few days after, Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o embarked for the Ca|nary I&s;lands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The number of the&s;e i&s;lands is &s;even, <HI>Teneriff, Great Canary, Gom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ra, Palma, Ferro, Lancerrotta, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uerta-Ventura.</HI> Their fir&s;t di&s;covery was &s;trongly conte&s;ted by both the Spainards and Portugueze, each of which nations claimed the exclu&s;ive honour.

&s;ometimes walking, &s;ometimes &s;itting beneath the &s;hade of the plaintain-tree, reading pa&s;&s;ages from O|vid, or Camoen's Lu&s;iad.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o's imagination full of the agreeable ideas of fable, wi&s;hed, before he quitted that charming place, to carve four ver&s;es he had ju&s;t written upon the bark of a tree: he, for this purpo&s;e, went to one much like the pine in appearance, drew his knife, began to cut, and &s;aw the blood follow the wound (21); tempted to &s;uppo&s;e he had wounded a nymph, metamorpho&s;ed to a tree, he recoiled with terror, and the murderous weapon dropt from his hand.

<P>Theli&s;mar pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome days at Laguna, a large and beautiful town, the hou&s;es of which are mo&s;t of them embelli&s;hed by parterres and terraces, inter&s;ected by immen&s;e walks of the orange and lemon trees; its fountains, gardens, and groves, its lake and aqueduct, together with the cool winds by which it is refre&s;hed, render it a delicious habitation.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal other towns, till he came at la&s;t to one called Guimar, where are &s;till found many families, the de&s;cendants of the Guanches, the ancient inhabitants of the&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">es. The&s;e people, though they have renounced the idolatry of their &s;a|vage ance&s;tors, have yet pre&s;erved much of their wild &s;uper&s;tition, and many of their old cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>One day, as Alphon&s;o was walking alone by the environs of Guimar, he &s;trayed thoughtle&s;sly into an unfrequented wood, in which he was &s;oon lo&s;t. In
<PB N="67" REF="020385_0066_0FAF01F9D2991008">
&s;earching his way out, he got entangled in a thicket, which he could &s;carcely make his way through, and which led to a kind of de&s;art, without trees, &s;hrubs, or verdure, a dry plain covered with &s;hells, and bound|ed by a mountain. As he beheld this di&s;mal place, he recollected that Theli&s;mar had more than once ad|vi&s;ed him never to walk in &s;trange places without a guide, but this recollection came too late.</P>
<P>Night drew on, and Alphon&s;o walked a little far|ther; at la&s;t, overcome with fatigue, he &s;topt near a hill, &s;urrounded with briars, underwood, and huge &s;tones, heaped confu&s;edly on each other. In &s;itting down on one of the&s;e &s;tones he de&s;troyed the equili|brium of others, which began to roll with con&s;idera|ble noi&s;e. Alphon&s;o &s;prang from his &s;eat to avoid be|ing hurt, and turning round, he ob&s;erved that the &s;tones, by being removed, had di&s;covered a cavity large enough for a man to enter.</P>
<P>He again drew near, and looking down the cavity, &s;aw, with &s;urprize, &s;teps like a &s;tair-ca&s;e: incited by unconquerable curio&s;ity he entered the &s;ubterranean grotto, and de&s;cended by &s;teps exceedingly &s;teep: when at the bottom he looked upwards, but could no longer &s;ee the light of day. He was inclined to re|a&s;cend, had he not perceived a light very di&s;tinctly at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The &s;ight of this determin|ed him to accompli&s;h an enterprize which promi&s;ed &s;omething extraordinary, and he pur&s;ued his road. He proceeded to a kind of ob&s;cure alley, at the end of which he found a &s;pacious cavern, lighted by lamps &s;u&s;pended from the roof. Alphon&s;o looked round, and &s;aw him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of two hundred dead
<PB N="68" REF="020385_0067_0FAF01FA97DD8328">
bodies, arranged, &s;tanding again&s;t the walls of this dreary vault.</P>
<P>Into what place of death has my temerity brought me? cried Alphon&s;o; it &s;eems to be the cave of Po|lyphemus, or perhaps a robber, &s;till more inhumane, and the dead here, have no doubt been the victims of his mon&s;trous cruelty. Well, if I have not the pru|dence of Uly&s;&s;es, at lea&s;t I have his valour.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o drew his &s;word, and determined to &s;ell his life dearly; he would not attempt to fly, le&s;t he &s;hould be a&s;&s;aulted in the ob&s;cure narrow pa&s;&s;age; he thought he might more ea&s;ily defend him&s;elf in the cavern: be&s;ides, he &s;uppo&s;ed it certain the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins had already clo&s;ed the mouth of the cave. A pro|found &s;ilence, however, reigned in the dreary vault, and Alphon&s;o had time to con&s;ider the di&s;mal and &s;urpri&s;ing objects by which he was environed.</P>
<P>He remarked, that none of the bodies &s;eemed to &s;uffer putrefaction, or &s;ent forth the lea&s;t &s;mell, but that they had all pre&s;erved their features. Alphon|&s;o was lo&s;t in the&s;e reflections, when he thought he heard the trampling of feet; he li&s;tened attentively, and &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed the voices of people &s;peaking in an unknown tongue,</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o would not begin the combat, on a &s;up|po&s;ition that it might not be their intention to attack him, but placed his back again&s;t the wall, hid his &s;word, and was &s;ilent; he &s;oon &s;aw twelve men ap|pear, walking &s;lowly two and two, and cloathed af|ter a &s;trange fa&s;hion. Their peaceable and grave countenances did not announce any thing inimical; but no &s;ooner did they &s;ee Alphon&s;o, than uttering
<PB N="69" REF="020385_0068_0FAF01FB57EE6F30">
&s;hrieks of horror, rage, and indignation blazed in their countenances. They drew the long daggers which they carried at their girdles, and fell in&s;tantly altogether, on Alphon&s;o, who, brandi&s;hing his &s;word, received them with intrepidity,</P>
<P>The combat was ob&s;tinate and bloody; the addre&s;s and valour of Alphon&s;o triumphed over numbers, and though alone again&s;t twelve enraged foes, he was the conqueror. He received two &s;light wounds, but his &s;word was mortal to &s;ome of his adver&s;aries, and the re&s;t fled, terrified and howling.</P>
<P>Once more alone in the cavern, Alphon&s;o tore his handkerchief, applied it to, and bound it on his wounds with his garter: then cutting with his &s;word the thong by which one of the lamps was &s;u&s;pended, he took that lamp, and returned without delay; he again followed the dark alley, arrived at the &s;tair|ca&s;e, ha&s;tily a&s;ceneded, found the cavity, and leapt from this frightful gulph with tran&s;port.</P>
<P>He imagined him&s;elf leaving the gates of hell, and returning again to life, when he breathed the pure air, and once more beheld the &s;tarry heavens. Oh! my father! exclaimed he; Oh! Dalinda! and you dear Theli&s;mar, &s;hall I enjoy the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you once again: you alone make life dear to me, and &s;hould I not pre&s;erve it, &s;ince with life I may perhaps attain what mo&s;t I love?</P>
<P>It was the decline of day when Alphon&s;o enter|ed the cavern, and near midnight when he left it; guided by the brightne&s;s of the moon and &s;tars, Al|phon&s;o fled this fatal cave, and after wandering full three hours, &s;topped, as day began to break, near

He repo&s;ed about three quar|ters of an hour in this wild and &s;olitary place, when the heavens became cloudy, the wind began to ri&s;e, and &s;ome drops of rain to fall; the rain &s;oon cea&s;ed, but the wind continued with redoubled fury. Alphon|&s;o ro&s;e, looked towards the mountain, and &s;aw a &s;ight that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">illed him with a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>On the &s;ummit of the mountain he beheld an e|normous pillar ri&s;e, the colour of which &s;eemed gold towards the ba&s;e, and at the top a beautifully deep violet. This pillar de&s;cended with impetuo&s;ity, from the mountain, breaking and overturning the trees that &s;tood in its way, attracting and engulphing leaves and branches, and tearing up &s;ome by the roots; at the bottom of the mountain it pa&s;&s;ed over a ditch, which it filled with &s;tones and earth; its pa&s;&s;age was marked by deep furrows, and during its dreadful and rapid cour&s;e, it made a noi&s;e like to the bellowing of a bull.</P>
<P>The formidable column directed its way towards the Lake, pumping up the water, and leaving the va&s;t ba&s;on dry; then turning towards the north, it was lo&s;t in a neighbouring fore&s;t (22).</P>
<P>To this phaenomenon &s;ucceded a de&s;tructive hail, the &s;tones of which were enormou&s;ly large; they
<PB N="71" REF="020385_0070_0FAF01FCD0886048">
&s;eemed cut in the form of a &s;tar, and were accompa|nied with long &s;plinters of ice, like the &s;harp blades of poinards (23). Alphon&s;o took refuge under a tree, and pre&s;erved him&s;elf as well as po&s;&s;ible with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t, which he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld at &s;ome di&s;tance from his head, though he received &s;everal wounds on his hands.</P>
<P>The tempe&s;t at length cea&s;ed, the &s;ky became calm, and Alphon&s;o, full of amazement, wounded, brui&s;ed, fami&s;hed, and fatigued, once more pur&s;ued his &s;orrowful way. In about a quarter of an hour, he perceived, with exce&s;&s;ive joy, a human habita|tion; it belonged to a Spaniard, who received him with humanity. Alphon&s;o informed him he had been attacked by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, and learnt in return, he was not more than two leagues and a half from Guimar.</P>
<P>Not in a condition to continue his route on foot, he determined to repo&s;e for a few days, and wrote a letter to Theli&s;mar, which the Spaniard kindly un|dertook to &s;end: After which Alphon&s;o, profiting by the humane offers of his compa&s;&s;ionate ho&s;t, ac|cepted food, &s;uffered him to dre&s;s his wounds, and was put into an excellent bed made up for his re|ception.</P>
<P>After &s;leeping three or four hours, he awoke, ro&s;e, and dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; the fir&s;t per&s;on he met, at leaving the chamber, was Theli&s;mar; he ran to his arms, Theli&s;mar received him with a tenderne&s;s as &s;incere as his heart could wi&s;h. He was going to begin the recital of his adventures, when Theli&s;mar interrupted him, by telling him he would hear no|thing

thing then, but mu&s;t think only of his cure. A carriage waits for us, &s;aid he; come, let us take leave of the generous and ho&s;pitable Spaniard, and return to Guimar.</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this the Spaniard returned, followed by the me&s;&s;enger, who had brought back Alphon&s;o's letter to Theli&s;mar; he gave it to Alphon&s;o, tel|ling him that Theli&s;mar had ju&s;t left Guimar as he got there. How then, &s;aid Alphon&s;o to Theli&s;mar, did you know I was here, if you have not received my letter? Of that I will inform you another time, an&s;wered Theli&s;mar, &s;miling; at pre&s;ent it is time we &s;hould depart.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o turning now towards his ho&s;t, te&s;tified the warme&s;t gratitude; then mounted the carriage with Theli&s;mar, and took the road to Guimar. The|li&s;mar would not allow him to exhau&s;t him&s;elf with &s;peaking, but as &s;oon as they got home, put him to bed, where he &s;lept twelve hours, and awoke in perfect health. Theli&s;mar then de&s;ired an account of what had happened to him. Alphon&s;o began his recital, with informing Theli&s;mar the things he had to relate were &s;o extraordinary and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, he was afraid they might be thought fabulous; and yet Theli&s;mar heard the whole hi&s;tory of the cavern, without &s;eeming to &s;hew the lea&s;t &s;urpri&s;e; which did not fail, however, greatly to excite the admira|tion of Alphon&s;o, and which he could not re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rain from te&s;tifying.</P>
<P>Dear Alphon&s;o, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, had you a little more thought, and a little le&s;s vanity, you had not,
<PB N="73" REF="020385_0072_0FAF01FF13786FA0">
in the fir&s;t place, ran the terrible ri&s;k you &s;peak of, and in the next, it would cea&s;e to &s;urprize you.</P>
<P>I can ea&s;ily imagine, an&s;wered Alphon&s;o, had I been more prudent I had followed your advice, and not have wandered in a &s;trange country without a guide; but which way has my vanity contributed to my a&s;toni&s;hment?</P>
<P>Were it not for that, I repeat, you would not have been in any danger. In every place you have come to yet, I have &s;een you occupied by one &s;ole idea, that of being very de&s;irous to inform and a&s;toni&s;h all the world by the recital of the wonderful things you have &s;een. We have met with many men of merit, Bo|tani&s;ts, A&s;tronomers, Mathematicians, and Mecha|nics, to whom you have &s;poken a great deal, and li&s;tened very little. When you come to a &s;trange country, if you find any per&s;on to whom you can make your&s;elf under&s;tood, you are careful not to a&s;k them a &s;ingle que&s;tion, but very anxious they &s;hould learn all, you can teach them. This kind of folly gives no one an opinion of your great capacity, but deprives you of the fruits of all your travels. If, for example, &s;ince you have been here, in&s;tead of a|mu&s;ing your&s;elf &s;o repeatedly by telling what happen|ed to you at the Azores, you had a&s;ked the people concerning the curious things in their own country, and its ancient inhabitants, you would have known your cavern had nothing miraculous about it, and that to enter it mu&s;t be at the hazard of your life.</P>
<P>Which way, &s;ir?</P>
<P>By being told the cavern is one of the &s;epulchral depo&s;its of the Guanches. The&s;e ancient caves are
<PB N="74" REF="020385_0073_0FAF01FFDF2F69E8">
di&s;per&s;ed in the de&s;arts, and are only known to the Guanches, who carefully conceal the entrance to them. They vi&s;it them only in &s;ecret; and if they find a &s;tranger there, they hold him &s;acrilegious, a victim devoted to death; and from motives of barbarous &s;uper&s;tition, think it their duty to kill him (24).</P>
<P>Well, &s;ir&punc; &s;aid Alphon&s;o, a little piqued, I owe, at lea&s;t, to my ignorance and want of thought, the advantage of having &s;een one of the&s;e curious ca|verns.</P>
<P>I have killed no man in my own defence, an&s;wer|ed Theli&s;mar; I have &s;uffered neither hunger nor thir&s;t; I have not lain in the inclement air, nor have I afflicted my friend by the mo&s;t cruel anxiety; and yet I have, as well as you, been in a &s;epulchral cave of the Gaunches.</P>
<P>Have you! How did you get admittance?</P>
<P>I knew the&s;e caverns exi&s;ted, had a &s;trong de&s;ire to &s;ee them, found an opportunity of effectually &s;erving a Guanch, and prevailed on him to &s;ecretly conduct and &s;hew me one of them.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o had nothing to an&s;wer, but held down his head, and was &s;ilent; recollecting him&s;elf a lit|tle after, he continued thus: I flatter my&s;elf that what I &s;hall farther relate may yet incite your won|der. After quitting the cavern, I ran, at fir&s;t, where chance directed me; coming to the banks of a Lake&mdash;</P>
<P>You need &s;ay no more, interrupted Theli&s;mar, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w the re&s;t.</P>

<P>After drinking the water of the Lake, you ga|thered &s;ome wild fruits, laid down on the gra&s;s, and a dreadful tempe&s;t aro&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>Good heavens! by what magic, what enchant|ment, can you tell all this?</P>
<P>The column de&s;cended from the mountain, the Lake was dried up, and&mdash;</P>
<P>What do I hear! exclaimed Alphon&s;o; conde|&s;cend, &s;ir, to explain this new miracle; who can have told you the&s;e things?</P>
<P>No one; I beheld them all.</P>
<P>Beheld them! where were you?</P>
<P>Here at Guimar, upon my terrace.</P>
<P>That was three leagues di&s;tant from me!</P>
<P>Very true; and yet I repeat it, I &s;aw you all the while.</P>
<P>I can no longer doubt! O Theli&s;mar! you are &s;ome &s;upernatural being!</P>
<P>A man, my dear Alphon&s;o; and by no means one of the wi&s;e&s;t.</P>
<P>Explain then this &s;trange enigma!</P>
<P>A day would not be &s;ufficient; I might ea&s;ily teach you terms and names, and &s;hew you certain effects, but this would be treating you like a child. If you wi&s;h to know cau&s;es, you mu&s;t gain more &s;olid in|&s;truction.</P>
<P>It is what I wi&s;h; in&s;truction, &s;uch as your's, which can make me comprehend your actions.</P>
<P>Well, I will lend you books: and when you have read them with attention, we will conver&s;e together.

I will then begin to unveil &s;ome of tho&s;e my&s;teries at which you are &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>Oh give me tho&s;e precious books; &s;ee with what ardour I will &s;tudy them; how utterly I will reject all other books.</P>
<P>I do not wi&s;h you &s;o to do; but the contrary.

<P>Theli&s;mar then took Alphon&s;o to his clo&s;et, and gave him a few books; when you have read tho&s;e, &s;aid he, I will communicate a trea&s;ure to you, which will fini&s;h the work of in&s;truction. Look at that che&s;t; it contains the trea&s;ure I talk of.</P>

<P>And how may that be, if you always think of Dalinda.</P>

after which he embarked for the Cape d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Verd I&s;lands.

<P>At la&s;t Alphon&s;o, unable longer to endure this con&s;traint, imagined a means to break &s;ilence, which appeared to him &s;ublime.

<P>Of what nature?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t fir&s;t give me your permi&s;&s;ion&mdash;to &s;peak of her&mdash;I only a&s;k to accu&s;e my&s;elf, to repair my fault,</P>

Well, well, let us hear; explain, explain; though I dare engage the fault is not very important.</P>
<P>In my eyes it is; feelings the mo&s;t forcible, the mo&s;t affectionate, on which the de&s;tiny of my life depend.</P>
<P>Come to the point, what have you to tell me?</P>
<P>You know to what exce&s;s I love Dalinda.</P>
<P>Your preface di&s;plea&s;es me, Alphon&s;o.</P>
<P>But it is nece&s;&s;ary; it leads to the confe&s;&s;ion of my fault. The day on which I fir&s;t faw Dalinda, on which I received a new exi&s;tence, after your cru|el departure, overcome and lo&s;t in grief, I wan|dered like one di&s;tracted, &s;eeking in vain &s;ome tra|ces of the cele&s;tial Being I had beheld: conducted at la&s;t by &s;ome &s;ecret charm, I returned, approach|ed the Fountain of Love, where chance, or rather the God of the Fountain, moved by my de&s;pair, gave into my hands a pledge the deare&s;t, the mo&s;t precious.</P>
<P>Dalinda's &s;a&s;h, you mean, interrupted Theli&s;mar, I recollect &s;he lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>Behold it here, cried Alphon&s;o, with empha&s;is, drawing it from his pocket; behold that &s;a&s;h, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ole con&s;olation of an unfortunate lover; I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it without your knowledge; it was wrong; I have not the happy right to keep it; a well founded de|licacy obliges me thus to &s;urrender it.</P>

<P>Artifice!</P>
<P>You blu&s;h, Alphon&s;o, and well you may; but I dare hope, had you &s;ucceeded in deceiving me, your confu&s;ion would have been &s;till greater; had you &s;een me delighted with your candour, your de|licacy, your genero&s;ity, tell me how you would have looked, how you would have behaved, while hear|ing your own fal&s;e prai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es?</P>

<P>And you hoped I &s;hould be your dupe; hoped I &s;hould return the &s;a&s;h.</P>
<P>I was deceived; convinced by fal&s;e rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>No; 'tis now you are deceived; you never were <HI>convinced;</HI> we cannot hide from our&s;elves, what is in its own nature blameable: in vain would &s;pecious rea&s;ons gloze over actions, and call them noble, de|licate, refined; the heart and the con&s;cience give &s;uch rea&s;onings the lie!</P>
<P>What have I done! Oh Theli&s;mar! has this fault, the whole extent of which I now perceive, has it deprived me of your e&s;teem without return?</P>
<P>No; your ingenious manner of acknowledging it; the &s;incerity of your repentance, the neglected education you have received, and your con&s;equent want of reflection, all plead in your excu&s;e. Did I

<P>The concluding &s;entence gave a little &s;atisfaction to Alphon&s;o, who promi&s;ed within him&s;elf to let no occa&s;ion &s;lip of demon&s;trating his reformation to Theli&s;mar.</P>

<P>One night as Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o, with their guides and companions, were rambling in a &s;andy and de&s;art place, they &s;aw a miraculous tree, the height of which did not exceed &s;ixty or &s;eventy feet, while its mon&s;trous trunk was above ninety in circum|ference; its lower branches projected almo&s;t horizon|tally, and as they were prodigiou&s;ly large and long, their own weight bent them almo&s;t to the ground; in&s;omuch that they found beneath this &s;ingle tree, a va&s;t and exten&s;ive kind of grove, which might ea|&s;ily give &s;helter to three or four hundred men (25).</P>

few paces from the tree they beheld a lion, extended on the ground, and &s;eemingly dead. Alphon&s;o was determined to examine the animal nearer, and The|li&s;mar followed. When they came up to him, they found he &s;till breathed, but was without power and motion, and apparently expiring; his jaws were&punc; open, full of pi&s;mires, and bloody.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o pitied the creature, wiped away the in|&s;ects that tormented him with his handkerchief, then taking a bottle of water from his pocket, poured it all down his throat, while Theli&s;mar held the end of a pi&s;tol to the entrance of that terrible jaw, in ca&s;e of a too &s;udden recovery. The lion was greatly re|lieved by the water, and &s;eemed with his langui&s;hing eyes to thank, with great expre&s;&s;ion and gratitude, the compa&s;&s;ionate Alphon&s;o, who did not leave him till he had admini&s;tered every &s;uccour in his power.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o and Theli&s;mar rejoined their &s;mall com|pany, and followed a path that led through &s;ome ex|ce&s;&s;ively high gra&s;s. As Theli&s;mar was walking on before, at the end of the meadow he fell into a kind of pit, and &s;uddenly di&s;appeared. Alphon&s;o ran and &s;aw him &s;itting in the pit. Theli&s;mar &s;aid he had got a &s;prain, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould ri&s;e and walk without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. As Alphon&s;o was going to de&s;cend and take him in his arms, he &s;uddenly heard a dreadful hi&s;&s;ing, and &s;aw a mon&s;trous &s;erpent, at lea&s;t twenty feet long, in the pit, with head erect, making towards Theli&s;mar, who, after an effort to ri&s;e, fell helple&s;s again among the gra&s;s (26).</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o in&s;tantly leaped into the pit, placed him|&s;elf between Theli&s;mar and the &s;erpent, drew his

<P>Theli&s;mar embraced Alphon&s;o; you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ave &s;aved my life, &s;aid he, I could neither defend my&s;elf nor fly; the &s;erpent was coming to attack me, and his bite is mortal. I promi&s;e you, Dalinda &s;hall be informed of this. Alphon&s;o was too much agitated to an&s;wer, but pre&s;&s;ed Theli&s;mar with tran&s;port to his bo&s;om. Gently, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, &s;miling, take care of my right arm, it is broken.</P>
<P>Broken! cried Alphon&s;o; good God!</P>
<P>Had it not, do you think I would not have defend|ed my&s;elf?</P>
<P>And you have not uttered the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of complaint or pain!</P>
<P>You, dear Alphon&s;o, have no right, at lea&s;t, to be &s;urprized at the fortitude of others.</P>
<P>Oh my father! replied Alphon&s;o, I want the for|titude to &s;ee you &s;uffer; come, let us join our com|pany. He then rai&s;ed Theli&s;mar gently on his &s;houlders, and, in &s;pite of all he could &s;ay, carried him, without &s;topping, to where their companions were waiting.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar was obliged to remain in one of the Negro buts, where he was humanely received. He had a &s;urgeon with him, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et his arm, and in a|bout eight or ten days he continued his route.</P>
<P>They came to the country of Foulis. The king of the&s;e &s;avages calls him&s;elf Siratick, and &s;ome tra|vellers give this name to his kingdom. He entertain|ed
<PB N="85" REF="020385_0084_0FAF02099AE796A8">
Theli&s;mar and his companions with great ho&s;pita|lity, and propo&s;ed they &s;hould accompany him to the chace of a lion, which, within a few days, had com|mitted great ravages in his &s;tates.</P>
<P>The king, young, courageous, and de&s;irous to &s;hew the company his valour and addre&s;s, ordered his followers and the &s;trangers to &s;top; and, mount|ed on an excellent hor&s;e, galloped to attack the fu|rious animal, which, perceiving him, leaped to the combat. The Siratick let fly an arrow, and the li|on, wounded, advanced with a dreadful bellow.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o now forgot the orders of the king; he darted like lightning, thinking him in danger, and flew to his &s;uccour: he had drawn his &s;word, and galloping with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed near a tree, again&s;t which, by accident, his &s;word &s;truck, and &s;napped &s;hort in two. Alphon&s;o him&s;elf, &s;ha|ken by the violence of the &s;hock, could hardly keep his &s;eat: his hor&s;e fell, and the &s;ame in&s;tant, the lion &s;eeing a new enemy coming armed, had aban|doned the Siratick, and ru&s;hed towards him; his dreadful claws were in&s;tantly buried in the &s;ides of the hor&s;e, and Alphon&s;o, di&s;armed, and without de|fence, thought his death inevitable. The Negroes, fearing to kill him, dur&s;t not &s;hoot at the animal.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar, the &s;ame moment that Alphon&s;o had galloped to the combat, wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld fain have followed; but the Negroes, already irritated at the young man's di&s;obedience to the orders of their king, an|grily and violently held him, notwith&s;tanding his cries, his fury, and de&s;pair.

<P>But, oh! what &s;urprize! Oh! joy unhoped!</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had the lion beheld the face of Al|phon&s;o, than all his rage was lo&s;t; he crouched to him, and lifting up one of his bloody paws, wound|ed by an arrow, laid it gently on the hand of Al|phon&s;o, and &s;eemed to &s;hew him his hurt, and a&s;k his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o &s;huddered, and remembering the adven|ture of the dying lion, cried, Oh noble animal! I recollect thee: may thy example ever confound in|gratitude, and bring to &s;hame tho&s;e who would e|ra&s;e from their memory the good which others have done them!&mdash;Yes, &s;ince thou ha&s;t &s;o nobly granted me my life, I will &s;ave thine in my turn, and defend thee, be the con&s;equence what it will.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o then &s;taunched the blood of the wound, and tearing his handkerchief, made a bandage which he fa&s;tened round the paw.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar and the &s;avages beheld this &s;pectacle with a&s;toni&s;hment. His chirurgical operations ended, Alphon&s;o ro&s;e; his hor&s;e lay wounded and dying. The lion once more approached him, licked his feet, and care&s;&s;ed him a thou&s;and times. Alphon&s;o re|treated gently: the lion &s;topped, looked after him, then &s;uddenly turned about, directed his cour&s;e to|ward a neighbouring fore&s;t, and di&s;appeared, leaving the &s;pectators of this &s;trange adventure motionle&s;s with amazement (27).</P>

Had you, &s;aid he, a&s;ked the na|ture of this chace, or rather, had you li&s;tened to the account which others gave of it, you would have known the Siratick was in no danger; but that, u&s;ed to the&s;e kind of combats, he waited for the li|on to bury his javelin in his throat; that he would have afterwards leaped off his hor&s;e, and ended him with his &s;abre.</P>
<P>I promi&s;e, my father, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, I will be more attentive another time, and more prudent; at pre&s;ent I have &s;aved the life of my lion, of my gene|rous and noble animal, and I am happy.</P>
<P>Yes, replied Theli&s;mar, but the Siratick is little plea&s;ed with your di&s;regard of his orders; and though your motive was his pre&s;ervation, he will not pardon you, for having robbed him of the honour of the victory; it will be therefore prudent not to &s;tay long in his territories

<P>Accordingly the next morning, Theli&s;mar, Al|phon&s;o, and their followers, quitted Gihorel, and continued their pa&s;&s;age up the Senegal, as far as the village of Embakana, near the frontiers of the king|dom of Galam; they afterwards cro&s;&s;ed the Gambia, traver&s;ed the States of Farim<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Or Saint Domingue.</NOTE>, and, after having travelled a great extent of country, arrived at Gui|nea.</P>

<P>The parrot, the pye, the jay, and various other birds, have the faculty of &s;peech; that is, can learn a few words, but can neither comprehend their mean|ing, nor, con&s;equently, apply them ju&s;tly: be&s;ides, there are many exi&s;ting animals, the conformation of which, both interior and exterior, is perfectly &s;imilar to that of man; they walk like him, and have hands like his, and yet they neither build palaces nor huts; nay, they are even le&s;s indu&s;trious than many other animals.</P>

Your doubt, dear Alphon&s;o, proves how little you have read.</P>

<P>In&s;tead of reading, he fell into a profound reverie: the murmurs of the water, the fre&s;h verdure, the rocks, all retraced a &s;cene which he had not the power to ba|ni&s;h from his mind: it recalled to memory the Fountain of Love; the form of Dalinda was pre&s;ent, he could think of nothing but her, and at la&s;t could not refrain from repeating a name &s;o dear.</P>

The &s;mall caravan of travellers being on their march, Alphon&s;o was walking about two or three hundred yards before the re&s;t. They approached a large pond &s;urrounded by the huts of &s;avages; and Alphon&s;o looking forward thought he &s;aw on the other &s;ide of the pond, a long brick wall built upon the border: not conceiving what could be the u&s;e of this wall, he ha&s;tened forward to examine it; but as he drew near, perceived this imaginary wall had motion.</P>
<P>He then thought, that in&s;tead of a wall, he di|&s;tingui&s;hed warriors clothed in red, and ranged in order of battle; he pre&s;ently after ob&s;erved &s;enti|nels &s;tationed in advance, and &s;oon &s;aw he was di&s;covered; for the moment the &s;entinels perceived him, the alarm was given, and the air re&s;ounded with a noi&s;e much like the &s;ound of a trumpet.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o &s;topped, and while he was deliberating whether he &s;hould proceed or go back, he &s;aw the army begin to move, ri&s;e from the earth, and at la&s;t to fly away.

<P>Alphon&s;o had a gun, and being de&s;irous of taking one of the&s;e extraordinary birds to Theli&s;mar, he fired at the flock and killed one.

<P>Had it not been for the arrival of Theli&s;mar and the other travellers, Alphon&s;o could not have e&s;caped with life; but at &s;ight of them the &s;avages fled, and he came off with a few &s;light wounds, and a &s;evere reprimand from Theli&s;mar, who informed him, that the Negroes held the bird he had killed in &s;uch ve|neration, they would not &s;uffer any one to do it the lea&s;t injury, but thought them&s;elves obliged in con|&s;cience to revenge the death of a creature which they held &s;acred.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o learnt al&s;o from Theli&s;mar, that the noi&s;e which he had compared to the &s;ound of trump|ets, was nothing but the cry of the birds, which is &s;o loud and &s;hrill, that it is heard at more than a quarter of a league di&s;tance (29).</P>

Of all the barbarous people of Africa, the nation which he thought mo&s;t intere&s;ting was that of the Hottentots: their virtues &s;urpa&s;&s;ed their vices: they fulfilled, in their whole extent, the duties of friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality; and their love of ju&s;tice, their courage, benevolence, and cha&s;tity, rendered them far &s;uperior to other &s;a|vages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See l' Abr&eacute;g&eacute; de l' Hi&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> G&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Voyages, Tom III.</NOTE>.</P>

It is remarkable, that among the Hottentots, the education of youth is committed to the mothers, till the age of eighteen, after which the males are re|ceived to the rank of manhood; but before that pe|riod, they have no communication with the men, not even with their own father<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the &s;ame work, and the &s;ame volume.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>During their &s;ojourn among the Hottentots, The|li&s;mar was walking one day with Alphon&s;o: their guide carried a wallet with provi&s;ions, it being their intention to dine during their walk. As they were cro&s;&s;ing the ru&s;tic bridge of a &s;mall river, the guide let the wallet fall, and fearing probably the anger of of the travellers, took to his heels and di&s;appeared. This event was very di&s;agreeable to Alphon&s;o, he be|ing exceedingly hungry.</P>
<P>I am certain, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, I can find my way; but before we walk any farther, let us re&s;t a little under the &s;hade of the&s;e trees. They &s;at down on the gra&s;s, and Alphon&s;o continued to complain of having a great way to go, and nothing to eat, when Theli&s;mar cried &s;ilence, let us li&s;ten. Alphon&s;o pre|&s;ently heard a very &s;hrill cry, which, to his great a|&s;toni&s;hment, Theli&s;mar an&s;wered in a graver tone: then ri&s;ing, &s;aid, Since you are &s;o very hungry, Al|phon&s;o, come with me, and I'll give you a dinner.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar then uttered &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive cries; and Alphon&s;o perceived a green and white bird, which hovered round them. Let us follow this new guide, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, he will recompen&s;e us for the carele&s;&s;|ne&s;s of the other who has run away.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="020385_0096_0FAF0217D29BFE08">
Alphon&s;o knew not what to think, but walked &s;ilently, and looked attentively at the bird, which, in a few minutes went and re&s;ted it&s;elf upon a large hollow tree: Stop, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, the bird will come and &s;eek us, if he has any thing good to di&s;|cover. As he &s;aid, &s;o it happened, the bird &s;eeing they did not approach redoubled his cries, came back to them, then returned to his tree, where he fluttered and perched.</P>
<P>Come, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, he invites us to dinner with &s;o good a grace we cannot refu&s;e him. So &s;aying, he went to the tree, and, to the extreme a|&s;toni&s;hment of Alphon&s;o, found a bee-hive in it full of honey.</P>
<P>While our travellers were eating the honey, the bird, having fled to a neighbouring bu&s;h, appeared greatly intere&s;ted at all that had pa&s;&s;ed; it is but ju&s;t, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, to give him his &s;hare of the booty: Alphon&s;o, therefore, left a &s;poonful of honey upon a leaf, which as &s;oon as they were gone from the tree, the bird came and eat. In the cour&s;e of half an hour, the bird &s;hewed them two other hives; and Alphon&s;o, &s;atiated with honey, merrily conti|nued his route (30).</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar quitted the country of the Hottentots, and embarked for the i&s;land of Madaga&s;car; after wards he journied through all the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Africa; then quitted that part of the world, and after a &s;hort &s;tay in the i&s;land of Socotora, landed in Arabia Felix.

Cairo (33); here he admired the famous Pyramids of Egypt (34), from thence he went to Alexandria, where he found a ve&s;&s;el ready to &s;et &s;ail for the i&s;land of Thera<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An i&s;land of the Archipelago, to the north of Can|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">; it is a part of the i&s;lands called San<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orin, or Santori|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, from Saint Iren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, the patron of them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar, within the la&s;t two months, had &s;eve|ral times read over with Alphon&s;o tran&s;lations of the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey. Alphon&s;o, joyfully leaving the burning and barbarous climates of Africa, was delighted to find him&s;elf once more in Europe, be|neath the azure &s;kies of Greece, in places where all the plea&s;ant fictions of fable may be traced&punc; and a|mong people who&s;e manners Homer had de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Before they left Thera, Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o learnt that the Volcano, which is &s;ituated in that i&s;land, began to give great unea&s;ine&s;s to the inhabi|tants, by appearing to re-kindle, &s;moke, and ca&s;t forth &s;tones.</P>
<P>The next morning our travellers ro&s;e with Auro|ra, and were conducted towards the Volcano; when they were at a league's di&s;tance their guide &s;topt, telling them he thought he heard a very uncommon noi&s;e; our travellers li&s;tened, and heard a kind of bellowing, which &s;eemed to ari&s;e out of the earth&punc; They proceeded, however, about a quarter of a league farther; in proportion as they approached the bellowing increa&s;ed, and was &s;oon accompanied with frightful hi&s;&s;ings; at the &s;ame time they ob|&s;erved,
<PB N="99" REF="020385_0098_0FAF021966EFAE90">
that the &s;moke of the Volcano grew thicker, and became of a deeper red.</P>
<P>Let us return, &s;aid Teeli&s;mar.</P>
<P>Scarcely had he &s;poken, before a horrible noi&s;e was heard; and as they turned their heads to look, while flying towards the &s;ea-coa&s;t, they &s;aw the mountain all on fire, covered with flames, which ro&s;e to the clouds, and ca&s;ting forth on all &s;ides vo|lumes of red hot &s;tones, and blazing matter. The terrified guide, lo&s;ing all recollection, led them a|&s;tray, and took them a road which brought them back towards the Volcano.</P>
<P>As they now &s;tood fronting this fearful mountain, they &s;aw, with horror, torrents of fire running im|petuou&s;ly down its &s;ides, and &s;preading over the plain: the&s;e de&s;tructive rivers burnt, and overthrew every thing that oppo&s;ed their pa&s;&s;age: at their ap|proach the herbs and flowers withered, the leaves grew in&s;tantly yellow, and dropt from the trees; the brooks di&s;appeared, the fountains were dried up, and the birds dropt breathle&s;s from the &s;corched branches.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time va&s;t clouds of hot a&s;hes and cin|ders, burnt white, ob&s;cured the air, and fell like rain upon the earth, breaking the branches, rooting up trees, and rolling, with horrid din, from the moun|tain to the plains, echoing far and near among the re&s;ounding rocks.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o fled from the&s;e de&s;olate places, and after long wandering in unknown paths, came at length to the &s;ea &s;ide; they judged, when at a di&s;tance, by the roaring of the waves, that the &s;ea
<PB N="100" REF="020385_0099_0FAF00D4840A4D40">
was violently agitated. They judged rightly; it was dreadfully tempe&s;tuous, though the air was entirely calm.</P>
<P>They were con&s;idering this phaenomenon with an a&s;toni&s;hment, which was &s;oon redoubled. Suddenly there appeared in the middle of the waves incredible volumes of flames, which, in&s;tantly &s;preading and di&s;&s;ipating in the air, were &s;ucceded by an innumera|ble quantity of burning rocks, that were projected from the deep aby&s;s of the ocean, and rai&s;ed above the waters (35).</P>
<P>The tempe&s;t after this decrea&s;ed, the &s;ea was ap|pea&s;ed, and &s;ome of the I&s;landers who pa&s;&s;ed that way, informed Theli&s;mar that the Volcano no longer vomited flames. When the eruption was ended, Al|phon&s;o and Theli&s;mar returned to their lodgings, and two days after this memorable event left that unhap|py i&s;land.</P>
<P>From hence they went to the i&s;land of Policandro<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of the Cyclades to the &s;outh of Paros and Anti|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aros.</NOTE>, where they found a Swedi&s;h traveller, a former friend of Theli&s;mar's, who offered to accompany and guide them in their walks through the i&s;land. He brought them to his hou&s;e, which he would partake with them; and after &s;upper, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Alphon&s;o, &s;aid, My dwelling you &s;ee is &s;imple, devoid of ornaments; but if you love magnificence, I have the means of gratifying your ta&s;te. I am &s;o happy to &s;ee my old friend once more, that I have formed the project of giving him an entertainment in a palace, the richne&s;s and brilliancy of which may well &s;urprize you.</P>

Frederic, for that was the name of Theli&s;mar's friend, then ro&s;e, called his &s;ervants, who came with torches, and went forth with Alphon&s;o and Theli&s;|mar.</P>
<P>They came in about half an hour to an enormous ma&s;s of rocks. Behold my palace, &s;aid Frederic: the a&s;pect, it's true, is a little wild, but we mu&s;t not always judge from appearances. Stop here a moment, if you plea&s;e, and let the &s;ervants enter fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants then di&s;tributed torches to about a dozen men who had followed them, each of whom lighted his flambeau, and proceeded forward. When Frederic &s;aw them at a certain di&s;tance, he and his company began to follow.</P>
<P>They had not gone above a hundred paces, before they perceived an immen&s;e arcade, and their eyes were immediately dazzled by the &s;plendor of light. Come in, &s;aid Frederic, this is the peri&s;tyle of my pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ace; what think you of it?</P>
<P>The que&s;tion was addre&s;&s;ed to Alphon&s;o, but he was too bu&s;y in con&s;idering the brilliant &s;pectacle before him to reply. The walls of this va&s;t peri&s;tyle &s;eemed covered with gold, rubies, and diamonds; the ceiling decorated with waving garlands, and pendant ornaments of chry&s;tal; nay, the very floor on which they trod, was paved with the &s;ame rich materials (36).</P>
<P>Pardon me, my dear mamma, cried Caroline, for interrupting, but I can hold no longer. Were the&s;e pure diamonds?</P>
<P>No; they only &s;eemed &s;uch; but the re&s;emblance

<P>Well, that is very &s;ingular; and is it true, dear mamma, that &s;uch a palace once exi&s;ted?</P>
<P>It exi&s;ts &s;till.</P>
<P>Oh dear, &s;till!</P>
<P>Yes; in the i&s;land of Policandro.</P>
<P>Oh the charming i&s;land! Will you &s;hew it us to-morrow, mamma, in the map?</P>
<P>Yes; willingly.</P>
<P>Mamma, if you will permit me, my next geogra|phical le&s;&s;on &s;hall be to trace upon the maps all the travels of Alphon&s;o; for I can remember them all perfectly, and &s;o I can all the extraordinary things he has &s;een.</P>
<P>So be it: but in the mean time, let us continue our tale.</P>
<P>Frederic &s;hewed Alphon&s;o how exten&s;ive this &s;u|perb palace was; and after having pa&s;&s;ed more than two hours in examining and contemplating the won|ders before them, they once more returned to the hou&s;e of their ho&s;t.

<P>Theli&s;mar having formerly made the tour of Italy, had no intention of returning thither,; but his friend Frederic, who was going to Reggio, entreated his company; to which Theli&s;mar the more readily con|&s;ented, becau&s;e it was the only part of Italy he had not &s;een.</P>

things &s;o curious and intere&s;ting; but dear mamma, be plea&s;ed to continue your recital.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o began to think like you; the a&s;toni&s;h|ment which &s;o many extraordinary events continually rai&s;ed, excited an ardent curio&s;ity and &s;trong defire of obtaining knowledge; his trifling amu&s;ements no longer plea&s;ed; he became thoughtful, &s;poke with re&s;erve, and li&s;tened with attention; but in propor|tion as his mind became enlightened, he di&s;covered faults in his pa&s;t conduct, every recollection of which made him bitterly repent.</P>
<P>He could not now comprehend, how it was po&s;&s;i|ble he &s;hould have for&s;aken his father. The ob&s;ti|nate &s;ilence of Don Ramirex grievou&s;ly afflicted him; he ardently de&s;ired to arrive at Con&s;tantinople, where he expected to find letters from Portugal: and though he had a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment to The|li&s;mar, though he had almo&s;t a certainty of obtain|ing the hand of Dalinda, he yet determined to quit the former in Turkey, and return to Europe, there to &s;acrifice his hopes and happine&s;s to filial duty, if he received no intelligence from his father.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution plunged him into a &s;tate of melan|choly, of which Theli&s;mar &s;earched in vain the cau&s;e; which he even augmented, in wi&s;hing to di&s;|&s;ipate, by marks of the mo&s;t tender affection. He often &s;poke to Frederic, in his pre&s;ence, of Dalin|da, to drive away his dejection; while the&s;e conver|&s;ations, far from &s;oftening the &s;ecret pangs of Al|phon&s;o, but embittered them the more. Theli&s;mar at la&s;t took leave of Frederic, quitted Reggio, and
<PB N="106" REF="020385_0105_0FAF00D911DC7AB0">
returned to Greece; and travelling through it, came to con&s;tantinople towards the end of April.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o found a letter at Con&s;tantinople from Portugal, which he received with inexpre&s;&s;ible anxi|ety; it was not from Don Ramirez, but informed Alphon&s;o his father had returned to Portugal, had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at Li&s;bon, and had left that city, declaring he was going to undertake a voyage of eighteen months. The letter added, that nobody doubted Don Ramirez had had &s;everal private con|versations with the King, and that the purpo&s;e of his voyage was &s;ome &s;ecret negociations; that they were in great expectations of &s;eeing him once more in office, becau&s;e his &s;ucce&s;&s;or and enemy had been di&s;graced, eight days after his departure.</P>
<P>The gentleman, who wrote an account of all this, ended his letter by &s;aying, he had not &s;een Don Ramirez, as Alphon&s;o had de&s;ired him to do, be|cau&s;e, being on a tour to France, he had not re|turned to Li&s;bon till three weeks after his depar|ture.</P>
<P>From the date of this letter, Alphon&s;o calculated, that his father could not be in Portugal in le&s;s than fifteen or &s;ixteen months, he therefore abandoned his project of returning thither immediately: in fact, having no money, he had no means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in the ab&s;ence of Don Ramirez; and he was pretty certain his travels would be ended, and he &s;hould re|turn to Europe in le&s;s than a year. The &s;ilence of his father deeply afflicted him; but the a&s;&s;urances of his health and &s;afety were great con&s;olations, and he
<PB N="107" REF="020385_0106_0FAF00D9D62908E0">
did not doubt but time and his future conduct, might regain the affections of his father.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o, now le&s;s &s;orrowful, le&s;s ab&s;ent, con|ver&s;ed with Theli&s;mar as formerly; who appeared &s;o &s;atisfied with the change he had remarked in him, that Alphon&s;o thought he might venture to &s;peak of Dalinda. At fir&s;t Theli&s;mar was &s;atisfied with gen|tly reminding him of his promi&s;e; and Alphon&s;o, emboldened by this indulgence, &s;everal times fell in|to the &s;ame error; till, at la&s;t, Theli&s;mar was di&s;|plea&s;ed, and Alphon&s;o was obliged to be &s;ilent, though he &s;till &s;ought occa&s;ions to &s;peak his &s;enti|ments indirectly, and to complain of the re&s;traint impo&s;ed upon him.</P>
<P>Frederic had given Theli&s;mar letters of recom|mendation to one of his friends, a Greek, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a charming hou&s;e on the canal of the Black Sea; this Greek, who&s;e name was Nicandor, was not then at Con&s;tantinople. Alphon&s;o and Theli&s;|mar, therefore, in about a fortnight went to Buyuk-Dairai, a village eight miles from Con&s;tantinople<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;cite of this village is very plea&s;ant.

<P>It was the fir&s;t of May, and ten in the morning, when our two travellers arrived at Buyuk-Dairai.

<PB N="108" REF="020385_0107_0FAF00DACD31AB98">
and ro&s;es, and adorned by a multitude of young Grecian beauties, &s;urrounded by &s;laves magnificently clothed.</P>
<P>This &s;pectable delighted Alphon&s;o; and Thelif|mar, acquainted with the cu&s;toms of Greece, inform|ed him, that it was thus they celebrated every fir&s;t of May; that on this &s;olemn day, young lovers fix|ed coronets of ro&s;es over the doors where their mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es dwelt, and &s;ung their prai&s;es under their win|dows (38).</P>
<P>Alas! &s;aid Alphon&s;o, they are happy, for they are heard. That favour, replied Theli&s;mar, is no proof of their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But what happens when two rivals meet under the &s;ame window, or at the &s;ame door?</P>
<P>They fa&s;ten their coronets on each &s;ide, and &s;ing alternately.</P>
<P>After our travellers had &s;topt &s;ome time in the fir&s;t &s;treet, they continued their way; and Alphon&s;o, perceiving at a di&s;tance a hou&s;e more ornamented with flowers than the re&s;t, &s;aid, certainly that is the habi|tation of &s;ome celebrated beauty; he was confirmed in this opinion, when coming nearer, he beheld two charming young virgins &s;tanding in a large balcony.</P>
<P>The guide informed them this was the hou&s;e of Ni|candor, and they entered; the ma&s;ter came immedi|ately to receive them, and after having read the letter of Frederic, embraced them both affectionately, and te&s;tified the livelie&s;t hopes that they would remain with him &s;ome time. Nicandor and all his family &s;poke French tolerably well: Theli&s;mar under&s;tood that language perfectly, and Alphon&s;o knew &s;ome|thing of it.</P>

Nicandor called his &s;laves, who conducted the tra|vellers into a &s;pacious hall, the walls of which were Parian marble, where a bath was prepared (39).</P>

After this moving ceremony, the two families, united and followed by all their &s;laves, walked to church; this &s;uperb train was preceded by a band of vocal and in|&s;trumental mu&s;ic: after them came the young virgin, &s;upported by her father and mother; her pace was &s;low, timid, and trembling; her down-ca&s;t eyes were evidently wet with tears &s;he vainly endeavoured to re|tain. According to the ancient u&s;age of Greece, the Torch of Hymen was carried before her, and her &s;laves, hu&s;band, parents, and friends clo&s;ed the proce&s;&s;ion, in which order they arrived at church.</P>
<P>After the ceremony, the bride and bridegroom were re-conducted in pomp to their hou&s;e, the front of which was illuminated, and ornamented with flowers and foliage; cups of wine were given to all the gue&s;ts, and the young people received no&s;egays bound with threads of gold, the per&s;on who pre|&s;ented them &s;aying, <HI>Go ye and marry al&s;o.</HI> The&s;e words rou&s;ed the attention of Alphon&s;o, who looked at Theli&s;mar.

<P>Alphon&s;o left this fea&s;t in a &s;orrowful mood; the remembrance of Dalinda, and the fear of never, per|haps, ta&s;ting a happine&s;s &s;uch as he had been a &s;pec|tator of, afflicted him deeply.

Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o every day after their walk, went regularly to the embroidering room, whither Glycera, and the young friends of Zo&euml; al|ways came; Nicandor explained, in a whi&s;per, to the &s;trangers, the &s;ubjects of the tales related by the&s;e young Greeks; and when Zo&euml; &s;poke, Alphon|&s;o became particularly attentive; he often would change places with Nicandor or Theli&s;mar, the better to &s;ee them embroider, and he remained longe&s;t al|ways at the frame of Zo&euml;; he prai&s;ed all their per|formances, but he only looked at that of Zo&euml;; he once more undertook to de&s;ign flowers, and offered every day a new pattern to Zo&euml; for her embroidery; at la&s;t he began continually to vaunt of the manners and cu&s;toms of Greece; and thought Buyuk-Dairai the mo&s;t delightful place he had ever &s;een.</P>
<P>One morning when he was alone with Theli&s;mar, the latter prai&s;ed him highly for his conduct. I am quite enchanted with you, continued he, dear Al|phon&s;o; I &s;ee you begin to acquire a command over your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Do I?</P>
<P>Yes; and I cannot conceal my &s;atisfaction; for the&s;e three weeks pa&s;t you have learnt to hide and overcome that melancholy, at which I was &s;o unea&s;y; you are obliging, amiable, and attentive in compa|ny; and what mu&s;t have co&s;t you more than all the re&s;t, you &s;peak no longer of Dalinda; be a&s;&s;ured I feel the value of this effort.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, Theli&s;mar embraced Alphon&s;o, who &s;uf|fered his embrance with a cold and mournful air, with|out making any reply; a moment's &s;ilence &s;ucceed|ed.

<P>See, continued Theli&s;mar, how fleeting a &s;en&s;a|tion love is, dear Alphon&s;o, when not confirmed by an affectionate and &s;olid friend&s;hip: two large black eyes, an ingenious countenance, a &s;weet &s;mile, and five or &s;ix &s;tories which you did not under&s;tand, have made you, in three weeks, forget the object of that pa&s;&s;ion which you pre&s;ented was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> violent.</P>
<P>It is true, that the young Zo&euml; amu&s;ed and inter|e&s;ted are; it is true, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> my &s;orrows from my mind, and that Dalinda was le&s;s frequently

<P>Do not deceive your&s;elf, Alphon&s;o, you have yet no real attachment to Dalinda, becau&s;e, at pre&s;ent, you know nothing of her but her form.</P>
<P>But that form proclaima a &s;oul &s;o pure, &s;o &s;uperi|or! Be&s;ides, I know Dalinda by her letters, her acquirements, her tenderne&s;s for you! In a word, Dalinda is the daughter of Theli&s;mar, and is not that enough to make her pa&s;&s;ionately beloved?</P>
<P>All that is not a &s;ufficient foundation for a deep and durable attachment, which cannot exi&s;t without mu|tual con&s;idence and friend&s;hip. But let me a&s;k you a que&s;tion concerning Zo&euml;: how has it happened, that you have not perceived the impre&s;&s;ion &s;he has made upon you?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t certainly be a want of reflection.</P>
<P>Imagine then, for a moment, the con&s;equence of wanting &s;uch reflection.

And now, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, I mu&s;t quit my&s;elf of a promi&s;e which I have not forgotten. So &s;aying, he opened a ca&s;ket, took out the fa&s;h of Dalinda, and gave it Alphon&s;o.

<P>Oh Theli&s;mar, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, greatly affected, what a moment have you cho&s;en! And am I per|mitted to receive a pledge &s;o dear in this hou&s;e!</P>

<P>Remember, Alphon&s;o, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, this from a father, is no light, no trifling gift; from this moment our engagement is mutually &s;acred.

<P>Nicandor came and interrupted their conver&s;a|tion, and Alphon&s;o, too much moved to &s;upport the pre&s;ence of a third per&s;on, retired: he wi&s;hed for &s;olitude, that he might indulge, without con&s;traint, the tran&s;ports of his heart. It is needle&s;s to ob&s;erve, that from that day forward he de&s;igned no more patterns for Zo&euml;, paid her no other attentions than

Nicandor related many intere&s;ting particulars of the friend he had lo&s;t; and told how he had renounced the riches and honours which he had a right to ex|pect, that he might yield him&s;elf, without controul, to the delights of friend&s;hip and &s;tudy.</P>
<P>This &s;age, continued Nicandor, who had retired to a plea&s;ant hou&s;e (46) near mine di&s;tributed the greater part of his income to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he con&s;ecrated the rest to the embelli&s;hment of his habitation: his heart was virtuous, and his temper &s;imple; he cultivated his garden him&s;elf, watered his flowers, and bred birds, for which he made an exten&s;ive aviary. Such were his innocent amu&s;e|ments. Beloved by his friends, adored by his &s;laves, he had a &s;i&s;ter worthy of him&s;elf, who lived with him, went with him every where, and who never can forget his lo&s;s.

<P>Theli&s;mar que&s;tioned Nicandor concerning this old man, who an&s;wered his name was Zaphiri.

<P>Nicandor was &s;peaking, when Alphen&s;o and The|i&s;mar felt their blood run cold at the broken accents and dolorous cries they heard: it is the wretched Euphro&s;ine, &s;aid Nicandor. Immediately a woman

<P>Common feelings produce only common effects, while a deep &s;en&s;ibility naturally begets extraordina|ry ideas and actions: thus, for example, if the wo|man, who has intere&s;ted us &s;o much, if Euphro&s;ine had rea&s;on, ta&s;te, and di&s;cernment, as well as &s;uch

&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and if &s;he were then to write, her works would certainly po&s;&s;e&s;s originality, energy, feeling, and truth.</P>
<P>And is it not the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e qualities which con&s;titutes genius?</P>
<P>Undoubtedly! If genius did not originate in the &s;oul, would it be a gift &s;o precious, &s;o de&s;irable, or could it &s;o powerfully excite envy?</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome few more days at Buyuk-Dairai; after which they took leave of Ni|candor and his amiable family, quitted Greece, and entered A&s;ia by Natolia. They &s;taid a little while at Bagdad<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bagdad it a great city, on the ea&s;tern borders of the Tigris; it was taken by the Turks &s;omewhere about 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</NOTE> and Ba&s;&s;ora<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ba&s;&s;ora is a fine city, below the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates; the Turks have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ince 1664: it is 100 leagues from Bagdad.</NOTE>, and &s;topped at the i&s;land of Bahrein, in the Per&s;ian Gulf, where they &s;aw the fa|mous pearl fi&s;hery (48). From thence they departed by &s;ea for the kingdom of Vi&s;apour.</P>
<P>During this voyage Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o were one evening walking the deck, and conver&s;ing on the wonders of nature. I think at pre&s;ent, &s;aid Alphon|&s;o, I know them all.</P>
<P>Dear Alphon&s;o, &s;ince you are &s;o learned, replied Theli&s;mar, explain the meaning of the phaenomenon which at this moment appears; look this way on yon|der waves.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o went to Theli&s;mar, and looking as di|rected, beheld the ve&s;&s;el encircled by fire, to which the total darkne&s;s of the night gave an additional

brilliancy; the &s;urface of the &s;ea was entirely covered with &s;mall &s;parkling &s;tars, and every wave, as it broke, ca&s;t forth a &s;hining light.</P>
<P>The wake of the ve&s;&s;el was of a luminous &s;ilver white, inter&s;per&s;ed with dazzling azure &s;parks (49).</P>
<P>In confe&s;s, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, this is a glorious &s;ight, and ab&s;olutely new to me.</P>
<P>Come let us go to bed, replied Theli&s;mar; and &s;hould you happen to awake in the night, I am per|&s;uaded you will make &s;ome &s;olitary reflections on that pre&s;umption which is but too natural to you, and which per&s;uades you of the extent of your knowledge, when every day proves the contrary.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o made no reply, but embraced Theli&s;mar, and went to bed.</P>
<P>Scarcely had he been a&s;leep half an hour, before there was a noi&s;e in his cabin that awaked him: he had put out his light, and was frightened at opening his eyes, by perceiving fire on the partition oppo&s;ite his bed; he ro&s;e ha&s;tily, and his &s;urprize increa&s;ed at beholding, in large legiable letters of &s;ire, the&s;e words written upon the boards:</P>
<P><HI>Learned Alphon&s;o, your terror is ill &s;ounded, this fire burns not</HI> (50).</P>
<P>A&s;hamed and a&s;toni&s;hed, Alphon&s;o put his hand upon the&s;e fiery characters, and felt no heat: Oh Theli&s;mar! cried he, what &s;urprizes me the mo&s;t is, that you have the art to render the le&s;&s;ons which wound &s;elf-love agreeable. Theli&s;mar immediately appeared, with a light in his hand, &s;miling; and after having explained to him the nature of this &s;eeming fire, re|tired, and Alphon&s;o once more went to &s;leep.</P>

It is al&s;o time that we &s;hould go to &s;leep, inter|rupted the Barronne&s;s, for the evening has been much longer than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The next evening Madame de Cl&eacute;mire again con|tinued her hi&s;tory of Alphon&s;o.</P>
<P>Our travellers being arrived at Vi&s;apour, vi&s;ited the diamond mines (51), and afterwards went to the Court of the great Mogul. Theli&s;mar having obtain|ed an audience of the Emperor, was permitted with Alphon&s;o to &s;ee the Palace. They pa&s;&s;ed through many apartments, and found, in all of them, beau|tiful women, in magnificent habits, armed with lan|ces, who formed the interior guard of the palace. They came to a va&s;t and &s;plendid hall, hung with gold brocade, where the Monarch was &s;itting on a Throne of Mother of Pearl, entirely covered with rubies and emeralds; four Columns, all be&s;pread with diamonds, &s;upported a canopy of &s;ilver, embroidered with &s;apphires, and ornamented with fe&s;toons and pearls; a &s;uperb trophy, compo&s;ed of the Emperor's arms, his quiver, bow, and &s;abre, garni&s;hed with jewels, and connected by a chain of topazes and diamonds, were &s;u&s;pended to one of the columns; the Emperor him&s;elf was in cloth of gold, and in the centre of his turban was a diamond of prodigious brightne&s;s, and &s;o large, that it extended almo&s;t over his whole front: various rows of fine pearl formed his bracelets and collar; and an infinity of precious &s;tones, of various colours, enriched his girdle and his bu&s;kins: before him was a table of ma&s;&s;ive gold, and all the great lords of his court, in mo&s;t &s;umptuous robes, were &s;tanding ranged round his throne.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="020385_0124_0FAF00EA54032370">
Theli&s;mar pre&s;ented to him &s;everal mathematical in&s;truments, of which, by means of an interpreter, he explained the u&s;e. The Emperor &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the pre&s;ents and conver&s;ation of Theli&s;mar; told him, it was his birth-day; that the whole empire ce|lebrated the fe&s;tival, and invited Alphon&s;o and The|li&s;mar to &s;pend the evening in his palace.</P>
<P>Evening came; wine was brought in va&s;es of rock chry&s;tal; every body was &s;eated, fruits were &s;erved in plated of gold; the mu&s;icians entered, and the hall &s;oon re&s;ounded with cymbals and trumpets. The Emperor filled a goblet of wine, and &s;ent it to The|li&s;mar; the goblet was of gold, enriched with the turquoi&s;e, the emerald, and the ruby. When he had drank, the Emperor de&s;ired him to keep the cup and mark of his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>When the repa&s;t was almo&s;t ended, two large ba&s;ons of rubies were brought the Emperor, which he threw among the courtiers, who all &s;crambled for them. Soon after two other ba&s;ons were brought full of gold and &s;ilver almonds, which were thrown, and &s;natched with the &s;ame avidity.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o, as you may well &s;up|po&s;e, &s;at &s;till, a&s;hamed of, and contemning the co|vetou&s;ne&s;s and meanne&s;s of the Mogul lords.</P>
<P>The Emperor al&s;o di&s;tributed pieces of gold-&s;tuff and rich girdles to &s;everal of the mu&s;icians, and &s;ome of the courtiers; after which the drinking began. Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o were the only people who remained &s;ober; the Emperor, unable to &s;it upright, hung his head and fell a&s;leep, and then every body retired.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="020385_0125_0FAF00EB1F30D530">
When Alphon&s;o and Theli&s;mar were alone, The|li&s;mar &s;aid to the former, What do you think of this Court?</P>
<P>I think, replied Alphon&s;o, he is the riche&s;t and mo&s;t magnificent Sovereign upon earth.</P>
<P>And the happie&s;t, and mo&s;t re&s;pectable likewi&s;e?</P>
<P>I know not if he be happy, for I know not if he be loved, if his reign be peaceable and glorious: but I confe&s;s there is nothing augu&s;t in his per&s;on; nothing which enforces reverence. There is not a &s;ingle Prince in Europe, who has &s;o little the air of maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>And yet there is no European Sovereign, who may be any way compared to him for pomp and &s;hew. Gold, pearls, diamonds, and all the A&s;iatic o&s;tenta|tion, do not therefore of them&s;elves impre&s;s any real re&s;pect. What mu&s;t we think then of tho&s;e frivo|lous Europeans, who affix &s;o great and imaginary a value on tho&s;e &s;hining trifles? I wi&s;h the European women, who are riche&s;t in &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and who are &s;ometimes properly enough, by way of deri&s;ion, called queens of diamonds, I wi&s;h they could be tran&s;ported here for twenty-four hours. What would one of them &s;ay, at &s;eeing her&s;elf totally &s;urpa&s;&s;ed in &s;uch bright ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bles, by the very &s;laves of the Emperors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ives.</P>
<P>For my part, an&s;wered Alphon&s;o, blu&s;hing a lit|tle, I &s;hall no more mention the diamonds that my father lo&s;t during the earthquake at Li&s;bon. But pray tell me how it happens, that the great Lords of this Court, who &s;eem &s;o rich, are yet &s;o covet|ous?
<PB N="127" REF="020385_0126_0FAF00ECB0284EE0">
How meanly did they hu&s;tle one another for the gold and jewels the Emperor threw.</P>
<P>Their whole emulation is that of being more &s;u|perbly dre&s;t than others; they only &s;eek to di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves by &s;illy out&s;ide &s;hew; and you &s;ee how much this kind of vanity, carried to exce&s;s, can make men capable of the mo&s;t degrading acts. But to return to the Emperor: you &s;ay you are ig|norant if he be happy; can you &s;uppo&s;e a monarch &s;o ignorant, &s;o deba&s;ed, happy.</P>
<P>If he be good, he may be beloved.</P>
<P>We do not love whom we de&s;pi&s;e; ought he not, for the good of his people, to be well informed, ju&s;t, and e&s;timable. Be&s;ides, this Monarch has no &s;ubjects, they are only &s;laves, and he is a de&s;pot; he exerci&s;es a tyrannical power outwardly, while he is inwardly tormented by all the fears and terrors, which ever were the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of tyrants. The homage paid him is forced; and while adulation of|fers him incen&s;e, hatred is &s;ecretly con&s;piring his de&s;truction; his life is pa&s;t in &s;u&s;picion, or the pu|ni&s;hment of traitors; he is in continual fear of all that approach him; and to complete his mi&s;ery, his very children are &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The next day, Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o went early to the palace; the Mogul was then at war with the Sovereign of Decan, and was going to vi|&s;it the camp where his troops were a&s;&s;embled. His wives were mounted on elephants that waited at their doors: Theli&s;mar counted eighty of the&s;e ani|mals all pompou&s;ty equipped; the little towers they carried were plated with gold, and embelli&s;hed with
<PB N="128" REF="020385_0127_0FAF00ED99F16F08">
mother-of-pearl; the &s;ame metal too formed the bars of their grated windows; a canopy of cloth of &s;ilver, with ta&s;&s;els hung with rubies, covered each tower.</P>
<P>The Emperor was carried in a palanquin of gold and mother-of-pearl, &s;et with pearls and precious &s;tones: many other palanquins followed that of the Emperor, and a va&s;t number of trumpets, drums, and other in&s;truments, mixed among a crowd of officers, richly clothed, who carried rich canopies, and umbrellas, of brocaded gold, hung, with pearls, rubies, and diamonds, led the proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our travellers, after having admired the &s;plender of his camp, quitted the court of the great Mo|gul (52), and went to the kingdom of Siam. Here they &s;aw the famous white elephant &s;o much revered in India: his apartment is magnificent, he is &s;erved kneeling, and in ve&s;&s;els of gold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They have the &s;ame re&s;pect for white elephants at Laos, Pegu, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

<P>There was now but one part of the world un|known to our travellers, America, for which they embarked, and came to California; from thence they went to mexico; and as they were on their route to the town of Tla&s;cala, Theli&s;mar looking at his watch, &s;topt his carriage, and alighted; tel|ling
<PB N="129" REF="020385_0128_0FAF00EEA65508B8">
his &s;ervants to wait, and carefully look to the hor&s;es; for, added he, night will &s;uddenly overtake us.</P>
<P>How! &s;aid Alphon&s;o, laughing, night! not &s;o &s;uddenly, for it is only noon.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar made no reply, but &s;eeking the &s;hade, turned towards &s;ome trees at a little di&s;tance. Al|phon&s;o, as he followed, perceived an animal, the extraordinary figure of which rai&s;ed his attention; it was nineteen or twenty inches long, without rec|koning the tail, which was at lea&s;t twelve, and &s;ca|ly, like a &s;erpent; its ears were like tho&s;e of the &s;mall owl, and its hair erect.</P>
<P>The animal &s;tood &s;till, and Alphon&s;o wi&s;hed to examine it; he ob&s;erved it was waiting for its young, which were running towards it; as they came up, it put them one after another into a bag or pouch beneath its belly, then ran towards the trees.</P>
<P>De&s;irous of ob&s;erving &s;o &s;ingular an animal nearer, and finding that it could not run fa&s;t, Alphon&s;o pur&s;ued it; he had ju&s;t overtaken it when it came to the foot of a tree, up which it ran with &s;urpriz|ing agility, and &s;eizing the end of one of its high|e&s;t branches with its tail, twi&s;ed it round, and there remained &s;u&s;pended, apparently motionle&s;s (53).</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o was going to mount the tree, when he heard on every &s;ide of him a loud crackling, which redoubling, &s;eemed like the di&s;charge of artillery; at the &s;ame in&s;tant he was covered with an innume|rable multitude of &s;mall black grains, darted on him from all parts (54). He ha&s;tily drew back, and
<PB N="130" REF="020385_0129_0FAF00EED6324040">
hid his eyes with his hands, which were con&s;idera|bly hurt by the grains that had &s;truck them.</P>
<P>The pain was &s;o great, that he was obliged to keep them &s;hut for &s;ome minutes, at la&s;t he opened them, but no &s;ooner had he done &s;o, than he cried out, Oh heaven! I am blind! Oh Theli&s;mar! Oh Dalinda! I &s;hall never &s;ee you more.&mdash;Theli&s;mar, Theli&s;mar, where are you?&mdash;Do not abandon the unhappy Alphon&s;o.</P>
<P>As he &s;aid this, he heard pretty near him a bur&s;t of laughter, and knew it was the voice of Theli&s;mar. What then, continued he, does Theli&s;mar in&s;ult my mi&s;ery? No; it is not po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>He then recollected that Theli&s;mar, when he got out of his carriage, had told his &s;ervants that night approached; he began therefore to take courage, and doubt the truth of his blindne&s;s, nothwith&s;tanding the midnight darkne&s;s that &s;urrounded him; he fol|lowed the &s;ound of Theli&s;mar's voice, till he found and &s;eized him in his arms.</P>
<P>I cannot at pre&s;ent, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, &s;erve you as a guide, Alphon&s;o, for I am as blind as you are.</P>
<P>Thanks be to heaven, replied Alphon&s;o, that I am acquitted for the fright only; I find now, that the cau&s;e of my fear is nothing but an eclip&s;e of the &s;un; but I did not think that eclip&s;es ever produced &s;uch total darkne&s;s, nor can I conceive by what art you could foretell, with &s;o much preci&s;ion, the exact mo|ment of this phaenomenon.</P>
<P>While Alphon&s;o was &s;peaking, the &s;un, once more beginning to appear, di&s;&s;ipated the fearful ob&s;curity that had blackened every object; the profound &s;ilence,
<PB N="131" REF="020385_0130_0FAF00EF9E51A860">
the midnight calm, &s;oon cea&s;ed, and nature &s;eemed to revive; the birds, with fre&s;h animation, thinking they &s;ang the return of Aurora, gave notice by their loud and lively warblings, of the birth of day (55).</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o now regained their car|riage, and the eclip&s;e, the animal, and the &s;trange artillery, furni&s;hed our travellers with &s;ubjects for conver&s;ation, which were not exhau&s;ted when they arrived at Tla&s;cala.</P>
<P>Quitting Mexico, Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o em|barked for St. Domingo; here Alphon&s;o flattered him&s;elf he &s;hould find a letter from his father; he was mi&s;taken, but he received news from Portugal, though &s;uch as gave him great affliction.</P>
<P>He learnt, that Don Ramirez had not returned to Portugal; that the public opinion was totally changed concerning his being again taken into favour, and &s;ent on an emba&s;&s;y; mo&s;t people even &s;uppo&s;ed him exiled, but were totally ignorant to what part of the world he he was retired.</P>
<P>This intelligence overwhelmed Alphon&s;o with grief; uncertain now of what might be his father's fate, his remor&s;e became more keen than ever.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar came to &s;eek him, ju&s;t as he was in the mid&s;t of the&s;e melancholy thoughts. I come to tell you, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, you will &s;ee Dalinda much &s;ooner than you hoped; &s;he is at Paris with her mo|ther; they will wait for us there; to-morrow we will depart for Surinam, from thence we will embark for France, whith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> we &s;hall go directly. But in the mean time, added Theli&s;mar, before you &s;ee Dalinda,
<PB N="132" REF="020385_0131_0FAF00F055F58560">
I will &s;hew you a pre&s;ent I have ju&s;t received from her. Here, open this, do you recollect that form?</P>
<P>Heavens! cried Alphon&s;o, it is the portrait of Dalinda! What a wonderful picture! What a &s;trik|ing likene&s;s! How perfect is the painter's art!</P>
<P>This picture will intere&s;t you &s;till more, when you know it is the work of Dalinda her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Dalinda! Has &s;he then every talent as well as e|very charm? Oh permit me once more to look on this precious painting.&mdash;Yes; behold her ange|lic features; look, there is her enchanting &s;mile. How happy, Theli&s;mar, are you in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a trea&s;ure!</P>
<P>And yet I de&s;ire another picture of her; I would have her paint her&s;elf once more, but with her hu&s;|band by her &s;ide; and when, Alphon&s;o, &s;he &s;hall give me that, I promi&s;e you &s;hall have this.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o only replied by tenderly pre&s;&s;ing the hands of Theli&s;mar, and watering them with his tears.</P>
<P>Far from feeling a joy pure and unmixed, he looked upon it as his indi&s;pen&s;able duty to return to Portugal, hoping there to find &s;ome &s;ort of informa|tion concerning his father: he was unalterably de|termined to declare his re&s;olution of going thither to Theli&s;mar; but this re&s;olution was too painful, not to cau&s;e the mo&s;t violent agitations in his mind.</P>
<P>He had never had the courage to confe&s;s a fault, for which he ju&s;tly and bitterly reproached him&s;elf; he wanted the power to tell &s;o dear &agrave; friend he had left Spain clande&s;tinely, without his father's con|&s;ent; and this fir&s;t di&s;&s;imulation, had obliged him

to di&s;gui&s;e the truth in a thou&s;and other in&s;tances: at la&s;t, however, he firmly purpo&s;ed to expiate all his wrongs by his &s;incerity, without re&s;erve, and, if nece&s;&s;ary, by the mo&s;t painful &s;acrifices; and in this di&s;po&s;ition left Saint Domingo. They arrived at Surinam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Surinam is a Dutch colony, of about 30 leagues ex|tent, along the river of Surinam, in Guiana.</NOTE> about du&s;k, and were &s;truck by a mo&s;t brilliant &s;pectacle at their fir&s;t entering that country. The coa&s;t &s;eemed covered with an infinity of chan|deliers, hung without order, at unequal di&s;tances. Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o were admiring this agreea|ble illumination, when they perceived many of the lights were in motion, and advancing towards them.</P>
<P>A moment after they plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed eight or ten men who walked nimbly, though they &s;eemed covered with &s;mall lighted candles; &s;ome on their bonnets, &s;ome on their &s;hoes, and &s;ome on their hands. This vi&s;ion greatly &s;urprized Alphon&s;o, who wanted to come near the&s;e men; but they pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily by, and, as Alphon&s;o did not under&s;tand the language of his guides, he could not &s;atisfy his cu|rio&s;ity.</P>
<P>When they came to the hou&s;e where they were to lodge, they were &s;hewn into a pretty chamber, as clear as day; but, as Alphon&s;o remarked, that the lights were placed in two &s;mall gla&s;s lanterns, he wi&s;hed to &s;ee them nearer: he then di&s;covered, with a&s;toni&s;hment, they were nothing but green flies, of a bright emerald colour, which gave all this light.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="020385_0133_0FAF00F22B9418F0">
We have now an explanation of the thing we wanted, &s;aid Theli&s;mar; the trees being in a conic form, are covered with the&s;e flies, and re&s;emble, at a di&s;tance, girandoles and chandeliers hung in the air; the men we met, had fa&s;tened the&s;e &s;hining in|&s;ects on their bonnets and feet, and carried them in gla&s;s tubes in their hands.</P>
<P>The very &s;ame eveing, Alphon&s;o learnt the&s;e beautiful flies were more than one way u&s;eful. When he was in bed, they were taken from their little lan|terns and let fly about the room, in which he was informed, they would kill the knats, which might otherwi&s;e di&s;turb his re&s;t (56).</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o, however, a prey to inward grief and chagrin, could not clo&s;e his eyes the whole night; he ro&s;e before day-break, determined no longer to defer opening his heart to Theli&s;mar, but to inform him of all his faults, and all his &s;orrows.</P>
<P>He went to walk upon the &s;ea-&s;hore till Theli&s;|mar &s;hould ri&s;e, and after &s;traying a con&s;iderable time, &s;at down at the foot of a tree, where he fell into a vague and painful reverie; pre&s;ently his eyes became heavy, he began to doze, and in a few mo|ments was a&s;leep. He was awaked by a piercing and &s;orrowful cry, and opening his eyes, &s;aw him|&s;elf in the arms of Theli&s;mar, who was bearing him away.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o endeavoured to &s;peak, but could only utter &s;ome broken and plaintive &s;ounds; pale and faint, he could not &s;upport him&s;elf, he wanted even the power of thought. Theli&s;mar laid him down on the gra&s;s, ran towards the &s;ea, filled his hat with

&s;alt-water, and made Alphon&s;o drink it; after which, with the help of &s;ome &s;ervants, he rai&s;ed and took him home.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o came to him&s;elf by degrees. Where am I, &s;aid he, as he felt his &s;trength returning?</P>
<P>Oh my &s;on, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, have I not &s;poken to you of this fatal tree? Have I not told you, that to &s;leep beneath its perfidious &s;hade is to die (57)?</P>
<P>It is true, cried Alphon&s;o, with a langui&s;hing voice, I recollect it now.</P>
<P>Providence be prai&s;ed, you are out of danger; but had not my fears for you brought me where you lay, the very in&s;tant they did, I &s;hould have lo&s;t you, Alphon&s;o.</P>
<P>And do you weep for me, my father? For me! Oh mo&s;t affectionate of friends! be&s;t of benefac|tors! wherefore have you &s;natched me from the arms of death? I had then been regretted by you. The|li&s;mar, while weeping for the mi&s;erable Alphon&s;o, would then have been ignorant of his wor&s;t errors.</P>
<P>What do you mean, Alphon&s;o?</P>
<P>I am overpowered by your favours, penetrated by your bounties; my affection for you is the reigning &s;entiment of my heart, and yet I am the mo&s;t un|fortunate of men.</P>
<P>Heavens! Which way? how?</P>
<P>A &s;ingle word, Theli&s;mar, may make you judge of my &s;ituation; I cannot follow you to France!</P>
<P>And why not?</P>
<P>Sacred duty dictates my return to Portugal: Oh! that by this painful &s;acrifice I could expiate my fault!</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="020385_0135_0FAF00F50D9DE6A0">
What fearful remor&s;e is it that overwhelms you?&mdash;But&mdash;no&mdash;thou art incapable of wickedne&s;s or meane&s;s; &s;peak, be confident, open thy heart to thy friend.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o &s;hed tears of gratitude and joy at hear|ing this, was &s;ilent a few moments, then taking courage, owned, without re&s;erve, how he had de|ceived Theli&s;mar, when he a&s;&s;ured him that Don Ra|mirez approved his travels; related the circum&s;tance of his flight, and painted, in the mo&s;t moving man|ner, his remor&s;e, and uninterrupted inquietude con|cerning the fate of his father.</P>
<P>When he had fini&s;hed his recital, Theli&s;mar, with a &s;oftened heart looked at him, and &s;aid, No, I will not abandon thee; I my&s;elf will conduct thee to Portugal.</P>
<P>The&s;e words in&s;pired Alphon&s;o with gratitude &s;o &s;trong, &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate, he could only expre&s;s it by fal|ling at the feet of his generous friend.</P>
<P>Yes, continued Theli&s;mar, we will find this un|happy father; I will enjoy the plea&s;ure of giving thee again to his arms; for I dare a&s;&s;ure him thou now wilt make him happy. We &s;hall arrive &s;ome|what later in France, but Dalinda will &s;ee thee re|conciled to heaven and thy&s;elf, and honoured with the paternal benediction, Don Ramirez will cer|tainly con&s;ent, without &s;cruple, to your union with Dalinda. My fortune is not immen&s;e, but it is more than &s;ufficient; the ties which attached Don Rami|rez to Portugal, are all broken; it will be no diffi|cult thing to engage him to look on Sweden as his country, and my hou&s;e as his own.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="020385_0136_0FAF00F5F50DB210">
This is too much, &s;aid Alphon&s;o; Oh Theli&s;mar! let me breathe; my heart cannot expre&s;s its feelings towards a benefactor &s;uch as you; gratitude becomes a pa&s;&s;ion; words are weak; I cannot tell you what I think.</P>
<P>This conver&s;ation delivered Alphon&s;o from one part of his troubles; the indulgence and tenderne&s;s of Theli&s;mar a&s;&s;uaged the bitterne&s;s of remor&s;e, and gave birth to the &s;weete&s;t hopes.</P>
<P>Before they quitted Surinam, Theli&s;mar and Al|phon&s;o were invited on a fi&s;hing party, and ro&s;e on the day appointed early in the morning. In their way to the &s;ea-&s;ide, they cro&s;&s;ed a mar&s;h full of ex|traordinary trees; from their flexible branches, bun|dles of filaments hung down, lay upon the ground, took root, grew, and formed other trees, as beau|tiful as tho&s;e to which they were united, and of which they were only &s;hoots, which again multiplied after the &s;ame manner; in&s;omuch that a &s;ingle tree might become the parent &s;tock of a whole fore&s;t.</P>
<P>But what mo&s;t &s;urprized Alphon&s;o was, that the&s;e trees were covered with &s;hell-fi&s;h! A multitude of oy&s;ters were fixed to their branches (58)</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar was explaining the cau&s;e of the&s;e &s;in|gular things, when they arrived on the &s;trand; they went on board, the fi&s;hing began, the net was thrown, and the haul was a good one.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o &s;eeing an exceeding large fi&s;h, very like an eel, went and touched it with a little &s;witch that he had in his hand; no &s;ooner had he done &s;o, than he felt &s;o great a pain in his arm and hand, that he gave a loud cry before he could recollect him&s;elf.
<PB N="138" REF="020385_0137_0FAF00F66025A128">
The fi&s;hermen all began to laugh: and Alphon&s;o, piqued and a&s;toni&s;hed, remained motionle&s;s awhile.</P>
<P>Recovering him&s;elf, he went again to the fi&s;h, and &s;aid, I do not know how the touching this fi&s;h can cau&s;e &s;o violent a &s;hock; but I will &s;hew you at lea&s;t, that though I may be &s;urprized, I am not to be intimidated.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he &s;tooped down and touched the fi&s;h with his hand. He did not cry out this time; but he received &s;o terrible a &s;hock, that if Theli&s;mar had not &s;tepped forward, and catched him in his arms, he would have fallen; and was &s;o &s;tunned by the violence of the &s;troke, that he almo&s;t lo&s;t the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was perfectly recovered, I will &s;hew you, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, a &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing effect produced by this fi&s;h. We are fourteen people in all, let us form a circle, and each hold the other by the hand: I will &s;tand fir&s;t, and you la&s;t; I will touch the fi&s;h with a &s;tick, and, although &s;eparated from me by twelve people, you &s;hall yet feel the fame &s;hock as I.</P>
<P>The experiment was made, and confirmed all that Theli&s;mar had predicted (59).</P>
<P>The day after this adventure, our travellers quit|ted Surinam and America, and embarked for Portu|gal. During the voyage, Theli&s;mar, in return for the confidence Alphon&s;o had placed in him, &s;atisfied a curio&s;ity he had long entertained. Alphon&s;o could not conceive how Theli&s;mar might re&s;olve to quit his country for four years, and tear him&s;elf from a fa|mily &s;o dear to him, for &s;o long a time.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="020385_0138_0FAF00F714F7A530">
Theli&s;mar informed him, that his Sovereign, being the protector of literature and learned men, had engaged him to make this &s;acrifice: the favours of my King, continued he, my love of &s;cience, and the particular delight I take in natural hi&s;tory, have de|termined me to undertake an enterprize, the fatigues of which my friend&s;hip for you has made me chear|fully &s;upport; the care of forming your heart, and enlightening your mind, together with the affection you have in&s;pired me with, alone could &s;often the unea&s;ine&s;s and chagrin I have often felt, and which are in&s;eparable from the feeling mind ab&s;ent from its native home.</P>
<P>After a favourable voyage our travellers landed in Portugal, where all the information that Alphon&s;o could procure, relative to Don Ramirez, was very feeble and in&s;ufficient. They a&s;&s;ured him, that his father had not been &s;een there during the la&s;t two years, and, after an infinity of re&s;earches, Alphon|&s;o was per&s;uaded Don Ramirez was either in En|gland, or in Ru&s;&s;ia. The intere&s;ts of his family re|quired Theli&s;mar &s;hould go to England; this Al|phon&s;o knew: therefore in quitting Portugal he had the con&s;olation to think he &s;hould not &s;tay in France, but follow Theli&s;mar and Dalinda to a land in which he hoped to find his father.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar, as they drew near to France, thought proper to make his young pupil promi&s;e carefully to conceal his love from Dalinda. You will travel with her, &s;aid he; I have told you it is the wi&s;h of my heart to unite, by the mo&s;t holy ties, two objects who are now almo&s;t equally dear to me; but you

cannot, Alphon&s;o, di&s;po&s;e of your&s;elf without a fa|ther's con&s;ent: I have no doubt his con&s;ent will be granted; yet there is a po&s;&s;ibility it may be refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Oh heavens! refu&s;ed!</P>
<P>Were I to pre&s;ent you to Dalinda, as her future hu&s;band, &s;he would look upon you, beyond di&s;pute, with the eye of affection; and, uncertain as we are, would it be right to hazard troubling the repo&s;e of her life?</P>
<P>I trouble her repo&s;e, or trouble your's! though but for a moment? No; let me rather never be|hold her&mdash;but we are &s;o certain of my father's con&s;ent.</P>
<P>And yet, &s;uppo&s;e, through &s;ome unaccountable caprice, he &s;hould refu&s;e.</P>
<P>What, my father pronounce &s;entence of death up|on me!</P>
<P>Either Alphon&s;o, I have lo&s;t the fruits of all my cares, or you will &s;upport this mi&s;fortune with forti|tude. Is it in the power of fate to make us mi&s;era|ble while we are virtuous, and while we po&s;&s;e&s;s a faithful friend?</P>
<P>Oh Theli&s;mar! you &s;hall for ever be the &s;overeign arbitrator of my de&s;tiny. Do you not di&s;po&s;e of my actions, my opinions, my feelings, as you plea&s;e? Oh yes; and the a&s;cendency you have acquired you can never lo&s;e; rea&s;on, virtue, gratitude, and friend|&s;hip confirm your power. I will faithfully follow the law you impo&s;e&mdash;I will &s;ee Dalinda, and be &s;i|lent&mdash;Yet what an effort! But &s;hall I doubt my power to perform what you pre&s;cribe?</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="020385_0140_0FAF00F899526818">
Our travellers came to Bourdeaux, whence they immediately departed; and their carriage breaking down at the di&s;tance of thirty leagues from Paris, they were obliged to &s;top where the accident happen|ed. Theli&s;mar wrote from this place to his wife, informing her he &s;hould certainly be with her the next day by five in the afternoon at late&s;t, and deli|vered the letter to a courier, who departed immedi|ately. Theli&s;mar and his pupil ro&s;e before day|break, got into their carriage, and departed for Pa|ris.</P>
<P>What a charming morning! &s;aid Alphon&s;o, tran&s;|ported and embracing Theli&s;mar, as he beheld the ri&s;ing &s;un; what a fine day! Before it is ended, I &s;hall &s;ee Dalinda.</P>
<P>Remember your promi&s;e, replied Theli&s;mar; I dread le&s;t you &s;hould betray your feelings at this fir&s;t interview.</P>
<P>Oh, I am certain of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Do not be too &s;ure: take my advice; from this moment moderate tho&s;e tran&s;ports; tho&s;e joys which in a few hours mu&s;t be totally concealed; let us &s;peak of &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible?</P>
<P>If you wi&s;h to acquire a command over your pa&s;|&s;ions, accu&s;tom your&s;elf to regulate your imagina|tion at your plea&s;ure, and to bani&s;h any certain train of thoughts, when you wi&s;h &s;o to do.</P>
<P>But provided my conduct be always rational, will it matter what my thoughts are?</P>
<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible to give any marking proofs of fortitude, if we are habitually feeble? He who &s;uf|fers
<PB N="142" REF="020385_0141_0FAF00F9909D2898">
his imagination to have dominion over him, can neither drive from his memory what is dangerous to recollect, nor reject thoughts he ought not to enter|tain; and can &s;uch a per&s;on always be &s;uppo&s;ed ra|tional? The facutly of thinking &s;hould be turned to the improvement of the heart and mind; but we pervert this noble faculty, when we &s;uffer our ima|gination to dwell upon objects beneath, unworthy of, or derogatory to our&s;elves; therefore there is no doubt but the mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts of a wi&s;e man are far more pure and &s;ublime than his words.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o &s;ighed, and for a few moments remain|ed &s;ilent; then, by an effort over him&s;elf, entered again into conver&s;ation. Theli&s;mar &s;poke of their travels, and recapitulated whatever they had &s;een mo&s;t remarkable; di&s;cour&s;ed on the arts, chymi&s;try, botany, and various &s;ubjects of natural hi&s;tory, while Alphon&s;o was in&s;en&s;ibly drawn to li&s;ten with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>How happy you are, &s;aid Alphon&s;o to Theli&s;mar; how exten&s;ive your knowledge, nothing can a&s;to|ni&s;h, nothing is new to you.</P>
<P>How mi&s;taken <HI>you</HI> are, replied Theli&s;mar. The heaven and earth, the univer&s;e, all we &s;ee, all that environs us, is the work of an infinite Being; an eternal book, in which man, till the end of time, &s;hall find &s;ecrets that are impenetrable, objects for ever new, and di&s;cover, through each &s;ucceeding age, my&s;teries the mo&s;t &s;ublime, without ever know|ing them all.</P>
<P>Thus conver&s;ing, they drew near to Paris, when our travellers, almo&s;t equally moved, became thought|ful
<PB N="143" REF="020385_0142_0FAF00FBBB91DCD8">
and &s;ilent; they remained &s;o a con&s;iderable time. At la&s;t Alphon&s;o &s;aid to Theli&s;mar, Will you not own that, at pre&s;ent, you do not chu&s;e your thoughts, but that you are obliged to accept tho&s;e which &s;o forcibly, &s;o naturally pre&s;ent them&s;elves?</P>
<P>As Alphon&s;o was &s;peaking, the po&s;tillion told Theli&s;mar he &s;aw &s;omething which very much &s;ur|prized him in the air. Theli&s;mar looked out, and di&s;covered, above the clouds, towards Paris, a &s;mall round body, opaque and dark, which appeared in motion, and &s;lowly approaching as it were, to meet them.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar a&s;toni&s;hed, looked very attentively at this phaenomenon, and his a&s;toni&s;hment increa&s;ed at beholding the body become larger and luminous. He determined to de&s;cend the better to examine it, and the terrified po&s;tillion had already &s;topt his hor&s;|es. They alighted in a charming meadow, adjoin|ing to Arpajon, &s;ix leagues from Paris; the lumi|nons globe, however, &s;eemed &s;till to increa&s;e in &s;ize.</P>
<P>It is a meteor, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, and much &s;uch a one as I &s;aw in Spain, when I was travelling to Loxe.</P>
<P>It is no meteor, &s;aid Theli&s;mar.</P>
<P>What is it then?</P>
<P>I cannot conceive: it approaches &s;till, and &s;till becomes brighter. Have you your pocket tele&s;cope about you?</P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P>Lend it me&mdash;Theli&s;mar took the tele&s;cope that Alphon&s;o pre&s;ented him, and having adju&s;ted it, looked and cried, it is incredible: I can perceive
<PB N="144" REF="020385_0143_0FAF00FCAA71A960">
underneath this globe a kind of ve&s;&s;el, a &s;mall &s;hip fa&s;tened to it; this is certainly an illu&s;ion&mdash;Here, take your turn to look.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o took the tele&s;cope, and pre&s;ently ex|claimed, good God! I &s;ee a man!</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar began to laugh; you have hit it, &s;aid he, it is Abaris the Scythian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abaris was &s;aid to have received an arrow from Apol|lo, on which he flew through the air.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I am not &s;urprized at your incredulity, &s;aid Al|phon&s;o; for though I am certain I &s;ee it, I do not believe it&mdash;and yet&mdash;why what enchantment is this?&mdash;heavens!&mdash;I now &s;ee two people di|&s;tinctly!</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o rubbed his eyes, and the tele&s;cope dropt from his hands; he looked at Theli&s;mar, who mo|tionle&s;s and fixed in amazement, &s;aid not a word! The globe &s;till kept approaching, and at la&s;t appear|ed almo&s;t over their heads. I can doubt no longer, cried Theli&s;mar: this globe of purple and gold con|tains living beings!&mdash;I &s;ee them!&mdash;Oh inconceivable prodigy! Oh happy triumph of auda|cious genius!</P>
<P>While Theli&s;mar was &s;peaking, the globe hover|ed over his head, maje&s;tically de&s;cended, and they &s;aw in the ve&s;&s;el, &s;u&s;pended to the globe, two cele&s;ti|al figures; they were females: the one had the dig|nity and beauty of Juno or Minerva; the other clothed in white, and crowned with ro&s;es, re&s;embled Aurora, or the charming godde&s;s of &s;pring-time and flowers.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="020385_0144_0FAF00FDCA179A58">
Alphon&s;o flew towards the globe; he was &s;topt by a violent palpitation of the heart; no, cried he the&s;e ravi&s;hing creatures cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e mortal&mdash;they approach&mdash;they come hand in hand&mdash;&s;urely it is Inno|cence and Virtue, de&s;cending from heaven to give back the golden age&mdash;but&mdash;good God&mdash;is it a new delu&s;ion?&mdash;Oh, Dalinda, this young di|vinity, the more to charm us, has taken thy form&mdash;I dare not believe my eyes, and yet my heart can|not deceive me&mdash;Yes, it is &s;he, it is Dalinda her&s;elf!</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o wildly called Theli&s;mar, ju&s;t as the globe and its car touched the earth; while the latter, pale, trembling, petrified with &s;urprize and doubt, looked on it, &s;ent forth a piercing cry, and tran&s;|ported with joy, ran, or rather flew towards them.</P>
<P>The two divinities were not le&s;s eager&punc; they &s;prang, they wept, they &s;unk in his arms.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o, quite be&s;ide him&s;elf, dur&s;t not follow the dictates of his heart; he &s;topped, and the exce&s;s of his feelings obliged him to lean again&s;t a tree, for his trembling legs were unable to &s;upport his bo|dy.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t moments of joy, the magic globe, the car, the miracle, were totally forgotten. The|li&s;mar behold nothing but his wife and daughter, and his curio&s;ity was &s;u&s;pended, &s;uperior to the pow|er of all enchantment. Alphon&s;o, a witne&s;s of his happy meeting, did not ta&s;te a joy unmixed; he con|templated Dalinda with ravi&s;hment; he enjoyed, with tran&s;port, the &s;weet plea&s;ure of under&s;tanding her in her native language, while &s;he &s;poke every thing

that filial affection could in&s;pire to a dear and ten|der father. But this intere&s;ting &s;cene brought to memory Don Ramirez, and all his wrongs; and thus was one &s;ingle &s;ubject of remor&s;e &s;ufficient to poi&s;on all his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Reflection, after a while, having again given birth to &s;urprize and curio&s;ity, Dalinda and her mother were que&s;tioned concerning the miracle they had &s;een. They replied, they had not ventured them&s;elves pa&s;|&s;engers in <HI>the Air Balloon,</HI> had they not fir&s;t &s;een ex|periments which had a&s;&s;ured them of its &s;afety; that knowing the day and hour when Theli&s;mar would ar|rive, and having a favourable wind, they could not re&s;i&s;t their de&s;ire of thus &s;urprizing him, e&s;pecially when it would bring them &s;ooner to his arms; that living in the &s;ame hou&s;e with a philo&s;opher, who had a globe ready prepared, they had &s;eized &s;o favourable an opportunity of flying to meet a hu&s;band and father &s;o dear; they added, as they were hovering over the meadow of Arpajon, they had di&s;tingui&s;hed a carriage and hor&s;es with their tele&s;copes, and con&s;equently had de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar after this went to examine the globe, and his wife gave a &s;hort account of the experiments which had been made at the Muette, and the Tuile|ries. Theli&s;mar &s;elf him&s;elf greatly moved, while &s;he de&s;cribed the general enthu&s;ia&s;m which the&s;e &s;ublime experiments had excited; and the univer&s;al admira|tion with which the whole nation beheld the immor|tal author of that di&s;covery, and the two illu&s;trious philo&s;ophers, who&s;e heroic daring had procured to France a &s;pectacle &s;;o pompom, and &s;o new.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="020385_0146_0FAF00FE98C94E70">
Theli&s;mar likewi&s;e heard with plea&s;ure, that all the truly learned partook in this well-founded national enthu&s;ia&s;m; and Alphon&s;o was a&s;toni&s;hed to find, that envy wanted power to poi&s;on the triumph of the au|thor of this brilliant di&s;covery.</P>
<P>A little reflection, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, will rob you of your &s;urprize; &s;uch lights as may &s;erve to guide men to the things they wi&s;h, are always received with tran&s;port. Suppo&s;e a chymi&s;t, by making a di&s;cove|very, &s;hould open a new career to the learned, and furni&s;h materials for an infinity intere&s;ting &s;pecula|tions, and a multitude of new ideas: would he not thus afford them new means of di&s;tingui&s;hing them|&s;elves, and acquiring glory? From one di&s;covery a thou&s;and others may ari&s;e, while each philo&s;opher is only bu&s;ied in bringing it to perfection, and thence deducing new lights and further fame: thus, far from endeavouring to dimini&s;h the merit of the fir&s;t inven|tion, each employs his talents and his genius to make it more u&s;eful, con&s;equently more glorious.</P>
<P>You give me infinite plea&s;ure, &s;aid Alphon&s;o; there exi&s;ts then a way, in which men may run to|wards the &s;ame goal, may overtake and out&s;trip, yet not hate each other. Oh noble triumph, in which the victor is crowned by the vanqui&s;hed; where the' excellence of an individul is the delight of the whole and becomes to them an inexhu&s;tible &s;ource of fame and fre&s;h &s;ucce&s;s. Oh that men of wit would follow this &s;ublime example!</P>
<P>You wi&s;h a thing impo&s;&s;ible, an&s;wered Theli&s;mar facts cannot be denied: a di&s;covery proved by expe|riment, is beyond critici&s;m, above cen&s;ure; but &s;o

are not works of imagination. An author who writes to the fancy, may ardently de&s;ire to prove his work is good, but cannot do it geometrically; it is in vain that he may affirm it a hundred different ways in his preface, when who&s;oever plea&s;es can affirm the con|trary: thus when he has compo&s;ed a <HI>Chef-d' oeuvre,</HI> ill ta&s;te and malignity may deny his merit, Hence ari&s;e di&s;putes, unju&s;t critici&s;ms, and enmities which di&s;honour literature. The philo&s;opher can write no|thing which de&s;cribes new facts that is not u&s;eful to all other philo&s;ophers; while the wit and talents of the man of polite literature are &s;ub&s;ervient only to his own individual fame.</P>
<P>After this conver&s;ation, they took a turn in the meadows, then entered their carriages, and went for Paris, where they arrived in the evening.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar made no &s;tay in this city, but departed with his family and Alphon&s;o for England. They pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time at London; but not being able to learn any tidings of Don Ramirez they left it, and went to Buxton in Derby&s;hire.</P>
<P>I will conduct you, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, as they were walking out, to a fountain, which, from the fabulous virtues attributed to it, would be much better placed in Sicily or Greece than England. It is pretended, that the &s;pring only flows for con&s;tant hearts; and that any lover, capable of the lea&s;t infidelity, cannot drink of its waters, becau&s;e they &s;top at his approach. It is long &s;ince I heard this old tale, added Theli&s;|mar, the gallantry of which recals to memory the fountain Acadine and the &s;tory of Argyra (60).</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="020385_0148_0FAF01002B316B38">
The guides now &s;poke to Theli&s;mar in Engli&s;h, which language Alphon&s;o did not under&s;tand: they tell me, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, we are not an hundred yards from the fountain; but as the road is full of &s;tones and brambles, they and our &s;ervants will go before and clear the way. Let us &s;it down under the&s;e trees a moment till they call. So &s;aying, Theli&s;mar &s;eat|ed him&s;elf between his wife and daughter, where they had not &s;at long, before the guides returned, and conducted them to the fountain.</P>
<P>I am going, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, &s;miling, to his wife, to prove a fidelity, of which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you have never doubted; be&s;ides, this clear and abundant &s;pring in|vites me to drink; I therefore willingly con&s;ent to &s;ubmit to this proof of perfect con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he approached the &s;pring and drank two or three times. Who, continued he, will, after this, pretend that men are incon&s;tant! You &s;ee&mdash;But come, Alphon&s;o, are not you thir&s;ty?</P>
<P>No, replied Alphon&s;o, laughing: however I will drink.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o drew near, but Theli&s;mar &s;topped him, as he was going to &s;toop, and whi&s;pered, What, have you the audacity to expo&s;e your&s;elf to this proof; have you forgot Greece, and the black-eyed youthful Zo&euml;?</P>
<P>Nay, Theli&s;mar, now you are cruel.</P>
<P>Well, well, &s;ince you have engaged with &s;o much temerity, you mu&s;t go through with it now; you mu&s;t drink.</P>
<P>While this dialogue was pa&s;&s;ing, Dalinda drew near, and Alphon&s;o fearing &s;he might overhear The|li&s;mar's
<PB N="150" REF="020385_0149_0FAF0100DF876940">
jokes, &s;tooped towards the fountain; but as his lips drew near the &s;tream, it in&s;tantly cea&s;ed to flow. Alphon&s;o, aba&s;hed and a&s;toni&s;hed, felt his heart violently beat, and &s;tood like the &s;tatue of &s;ur|prize. Dalinda blu&s;hed and &s;miled, though with an air of &s;ome con&s;traint, while Theli&s;mar &s;ilently, with mi&s;chievous plea&s;ure, looked on; at la&s;t, A way pro|fane mortal, &s;aid he, in a tragic tone, depart from the&s;e &s;acred haunts.</P>
<P>Certainly, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, this cannot be a real fountain.</P>
<P>I prote&s;t, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, it is.</P>
<P>I own it has all the appearance of one. And can you, who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o many other wonderful &s;ecrets, forbid the fountain to flow?</P>
<P>That would indeed be a wonderful &s;ecret.</P>
<P>Yet I have &s;een you do things as &s;urprizing.</P>
<P>This, however, &s;urpa&s;&s;es my power; I a&s;&s;ure you I have no influence over this fountain; the pro|digy at which you &s;eem &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hed, is entire|ly the work of nature. I will endeavour this even|ing to explain the phaenomenon; in the mean time, Alphon&s;o, cede your place to me, for as I have a clear con&s;cience, I dare &s;upply it, unterrified by your di&s;grace; look, and you &s;hall &s;ee the &s;tream flow once more.</P>
<P>As Theli&s;mar approached the &s;pring, it began a|gain impetuou&s;ly to bubble forth its waters; and when the had enjoyed his triumph for a moment, Theli&s;mar took Alphon&s;o under the arm, and quit|ted this miraculous fountain.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="020385_0150_0FAF0101A2025838">
Alphon&s;o was not ignorant enough to believe the fountain was enchanted; and after &s;ome reflection, he nearly divined the cau&s;e of an effect &s;o extraordi|nary; but Theli&s;mar's plea&s;antry had &s;o di&s;concerted him, that he could not recover him&s;elf during the whole walk.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar departed from Buxton, and conducted his wife and daughter to the frontiers of Scotland (61), where they left him to go to Edinburgh. The wife of Theli&s;mar had an ancient relation and bene|factor who lived in that city, and who was very de|&s;irous to &s;ee her once again; while, therefore, they went to Scotland, it was determined that Alphon&s;o and Theli&s;mar &s;hould make a tour to Iceland.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o at parting from Dalinda, acquitted him|&s;elf with a fortitude that even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the hopes of Theli&s;mar; fearing he &s;hould betray him&s;elf, he de|termined &s;carcely to look at her, and pronounced no other kind of farewell but &s;uch as mere politene&s;s re|quired.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was alone with his friend, he uttered his tender plaints, but the prai&s;es of Theli&s;mar &s;oon &s;oftened his chagrin. They embarked and arrived in Iceland, at Skalhot, whence they went to Geizer. The fir&s;t thing they admired in this wild place, was a ca&s;cade of prodigious height; but another, and a newer &s;pectacle, &s;oon drew all their attention: look this way, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, behold the &s;upberb columns of ruby, ivory and cry&s;tal, which cover that immen&s;e plain.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o turned, and over a va&s;t extent of ground, among rocks and gulfs, he &s;aw thrown up into the
<PB N="152" REF="020385_0151_0FAF0103CDBAA218">
air, at equal heights and di&s;tances, innumerable &s;pouts of water, as from prodigious fountains, and of various colours; &s;ome of a bright red, &s;ome of a dazzling white, others of pure and limpid water, but almo&s;t reaching to the very clouds (62).</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o and Theli&s;mar could not be tired with &s;o beautiful, &s;o brilliant a &s;ight. They admired ma|ny other phaenomena in the &s;ame i&s;land, equally cu|rious; and, after having &s;een every thing it contain|ed, of intere&s;ting and uncommon, they re-embarked, and again returned for England, where Alphon&s;o once more &s;aw Dalinda, when the pains of ab&s;ence were forgotten, though the nece&s;&s;ity of hiding it con&s;iderably abated his joy.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar left England with inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfac|tion, and at la&s;t embarked for Sweden. After &s;o many travels, &s;o many perilous voyages, to &s;ee him|&s;elf in his own country, in the mid&s;t of his fa|mily and friends, was a delight not ea&s;ily to be de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Here he had the plea&s;ure to find once more the vir|tuous Zula&s;ki, with whom he had lodged at the Azore I&s;lands, and who&s;e hou&s;e was miraculou&s;ly thrown in|to the &s;ea. Theli&s;mar learnt with joy, that the filial piety of this young man had made him the object of public admiration; that his &s;overeign had heaped be|nefits upon him; that he had found his mi&s;tre&s;s faith|ful, and that he was married, and the happie&s;t of men.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar wi&s;hed to contemplate him in the bo&s;om of his family; he there &s;aw Zula&s;ki, with his father on one &s;ide of him, his wife on the other, and his
<PB N="153" REF="020385_0152_0FAF0103ED7E2610">
child, a beautiful boy, not two years old, on his knees. Oh Zula&s;ki! &s;aid Theli&s;mar, where is hap|pine&s;s that may be compared to your's? The wife you doat on, the child you love, your wealth, your reputation, your plea&s;ures, your felicity, your glory, all, all the effects of your virtues. And your hap|pine&s;s is &s;till the more pure, &s;ince it is too intere&s;t|ing to incite envy. Tho&s;e qualities which are only brilliant, have ever more enemies than admirers; but tho&s;e which are the offspring of the heart, obtain the &s;uffrages of all. You cannot out&s;hine other men, without wounding their pride; whil&s;t you a|&s;toni&s;h them, you often irritate: and whenever you are per&s;onal, you are a&s;&s;uming. Your &s;on too, that tender object of your deare&s;t hopes, what may you not expect from him: &s;ince, to make him worthy of your&s;elf, to make him feel how exten&s;ive are the &s;a|cred duties of nature, you have only to relate your own &s;tory.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o, more than ever a prey to di&s;quietude, concerning the fate of his father, and cheri&s;hing &s;till the fond hope of finding him in Ru&s;&s;ia, told Theli&s;mar he was determined to go to Peter&s;burgh. Ea&s;ily imagining what Alphon&s;o's afflictions mu&s;t be, &s;hould he not find Don Ramirez there, Theli&s;|mar determined not to abandon, but go with him.</P>
<P>At Peter&s;burgh they found Frederic, the old friend of Theli&s;mar, whom they had met in the i&s;land of Policandro: I am de&s;tined, &s;aid Frederic, to &s;hew you, and &s;ee in your company, extraordi|nary things; follow me, and you &s;hall behold a pa|lace of chry&s;tal.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="020385_0153_0FAF0104CA77EE80">
We know, &s;aid Alphon&s;o, that you call a cavern formed by nature a palace. For this time, however, replied Frederic, it is no play of words, but a real palace, built by men, according to the mo&s;t regular rules of architecture.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;urance &s;carcely could per&s;uade Alphon&s;o; therefore, to cure him of his incredulity, Frederic im|mediately took him to the marvellous palace. As &s;oon as they came in &s;ight of it, Alphon&s;o uttered an exclamation of &s;urprize! He &s;aw a real tran&s;pa|rent palace, of beautiful architecture, apparently built of various coloured chry&s;tal.</P>
<P>Go on, &s;aid Frederic, and your amazement will be doubled: look at yonder battery.</P>
<P>What do I behold, cried Alphon&s;o: Cannon too of chry&s;tal.</P>
<P>The concert is going to begin in this inchanted ca&s;tle, continued Frederic, you may go in, if you dare enter a palace which mu&s;t at lea&s;t be the habi|tion of fairies.</P>
<P>I am too much accu&s;tomed to them now, &s;aid Al|phon&s;o, to &s;tand in fear of enchantments.</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he pa&s;&s;ed beneath the brilliant porticoes of the palace; and, led by cele&s;tial harmony, came to a magnificent hall, the walls and columns of which, built of the &s;ame materials with the re&s;t, were, like|wi&s;e, ornamented with garlands and fe&s;toons of ro&s;es; the girandoles of chry&s;tal, which were placed in the angles of the hall, were filled with an infinite number of wax-lights, which being reflected on every &s;ide, produced a mo&s;t dazzling brightne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="020385_0154_0FAF010557BA6EB0">
But what &s;truck Alphon&s;o mo&s;t, was the beauty of the women, which he found a&s;&s;embled in this magic palace. He was in no danger of taking them for fai|ries, they were clothed nearly as Calyp&s;o, or the nymphs of Diana are painted; &s;omething like Are|thu&s;a, or the beauteous Atalanta; their robes were the &s;poils of animals, run down, or vanqui&s;hed at the chace; their mantles, made of the &s;kins of the ermine and the fox, hung from their &s;houlders, fa&s;tened with diamond cla&s;ps; and, in the&s;e &s;upberb habits, their charms effaced the brightne&s;s of the habitation.</P>
<P>Quitting this palace, Alphon&s;o was informed of the nature of the materials with which it was built; it was the ice taken from the river Neva (63).</P>
<P>What, mamma, cried Cae&s;ar, a palace of ice!</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain!</P>
<P>Filled with burning candles too, and yet not melt! How is it po&s;&s;ible to find&punc; ice thick enough for &s;uch a building? Be&s;ides, you &s;aid the palace was of various colours.</P>
<P>My notes will an&s;wer all the&s;e que&s;tions.</P>
<P>Oh dear, cried Pulcheria, how I long to read the&s;e notes!</P>
<P>You had rea&s;on, mamma, to tell us that Fairy Tales are not &s;o miraculous as your's! but pray, dear mamma, continue your &s;tory, we will not interrupt you any more.</P>
<P>It is too late, &s;aid Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, you &s;hall hear the re&s;t to-morrow.</P>
<P>The following evening Madame de Cl&eacute;mire thus continued the Hi&s;tory of Alphon&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="020385_0155_0FAF010619E63BD8">
All the enquiries of Alphon&s;o, relative to his father, were as fruitle&s;s in Ru&s;&s;ia, as they had been in England: overwhelmed with grief, he found, in the affections of a generous benefactor, the &s;ole con|&s;olations he was capable of receiving. Neither duty nor the laws, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, permit you to marry, without the con&s;ent of your father; you mu&s;t, there|fore, dear Alphon&s;o, &s;ubmit to your fate; all that depended upon you, have you done to find him; now then you mu&s;t wait with re&s;ignation, till the age that you are allowed to di&s;po&s;e of your&s;elf; you mu&s;t henceforth be &s;eparated from Dalinda, and &s;ee her no more till you receive her hand. You &s;hall pa&s;s this time in Sweden, in a hou&s;e that appertains to me, and in which I lived before my travels; I will conduct you there, and leave you alone, while I go to Stockholm and join my family. We &s;hall be &s;eparated, but we &s;hall inhabit the &s;ame&punc; country, and with the certitude of being for ever united in two years.</P>
<P>Alas! &s;aid Alphon&s;o, how cruel an exile, how &s;evere a &s;eparation will this be to me!&mdash;If Dalinda only knew my love&mdash;might I but hope her pity&mdash;but I &s;ubmit to my fate; and oh! may the pangs I &s;hall &s;uffer expiate my guilt; may heaven, moved by my repentance, give me back a father who has cau&s;ed me &s;o many tears!</P>

cutting remembrance of my father and my faults, I might &s;upport this rigorous exile with fortitude, but remor&s;e now will be my only companion.</P>
<P>Always pre&s;erve, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, this ju&s;t remor&s;e; but be not vanqui&s;hed by it: indu&s;triou&s;ly employ your&s;elf in bringing that knowledge, the elements of which I have given you, to perfection. I formerly promi&s;ed you a trea&s;ure, the value of which you are now capable of knowing; behold tho&s;e &s;helves, tho&s;e books; behold there, my dear Alphon&s;o, an immor|tal work, which will more exten&s;ively in&s;truct you in the &s;ecrets of nature. I will &s;tay with you a few days, and &s;hew you the neighbourhood; in the&s;e &s;a|vage environs you will find objects worthy to excite your curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The next morning Theli&s;mar and the melancholy Alphon&s;o, were in their carriage by day-break. The|li&s;mar promi&s;ed to &s;hew him &s;omething curious, but Alphon&s;o was too deeply pen&s;ive to hope that any thing might divert his &s;adne&s;s. After they had rode about three miles, they came to a wild de&s;olate place, &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by enormous moun|tains.</P>
<P>Here let us &s;top, &s;aid Theli&s;mar. If I had not known your courage, Alphon&s;o, I would not have brought you to this de&s;ert, for our enterprize will be very perilous. Look here&mdash;do you perceive various gulphs on the other &s;ide of tho&s;e rocks?&mdash;Into the aby&s;s they lead to we mu&s;t de&s;cend.</P>
<P>As Theli&s;mar &s;poke, two men of a fearful a&s;pect approached; they were wrapped in long di&s;mal
<PB N="158" REF="020385_0157_0FAF01079C301080">
garments, with naked arms, and lighted torches in their hands.</P>
<P>The&s;e are our guides, &s;aid Theli&s;mar; here we mu&s;t &s;eparate; we &s;hall &s;oon meet again.</P>
<P>Accordingly he went with one of the men, and Alphon&s;o followed the other, who walked &s;ilently be|fore. When they had gone a little way, Alphon&s;o found him&s;elf on the brink of a pit; he &s;topt, and &s;aw in the mouth of this aby&s;s, a kind of &s;mall bar|rel or ba&s;ket, &s;u&s;pended in the air; into this bark the guide leapt, and Alphon&s;o followed; after which the guide, &s;till keeping the lighted torch in his hand, made his deep hollow voice reverberate down the gulph; and while its &s;ides &s;till &s;hook with the &s;ound, their vehicle began to de&s;cend, and an invi&s;ible hand &s;eemed to precipitate them into the deep bowels of the earth. Alphon&s;o looked upwards at the infinite firmament of heaven, which was an imperceptible point; this point it&s;elf pre&s;ently vani&s;hed, and he only &s;aw his &s;trange attendant, who &s;eemed the very counterpart of the ferocious ferryman of hell.</P>
<P>After travelling thus about a quarter of an hour, Alphon&s;o began to be a&s;toni&s;hed at the length of the way, and the immen&s;e depth they had de&s;cended; when &s;uddenly he heard a noi&s;e, which he pre&s;ently found to be impetuous torrents, da&s;hing and roaring round him, un&s;een, on all &s;ides, and recalling to his imagination the fearful and tumultuous &s;treams of Tartarus.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the vehicle &s;topped, he jumped out; The|li&s;mar came running again to join him, and after walking a little way, Alphon&s;o was &s;urprized by
<PB N="159" REF="020385_0158_0FAF010B47A49AA0">
the &s;udden appearance of light. He advanced, but not far; he &s;tood motionle&s;s with amazement: he found him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of a va&s;t and magnificent hall of &s;ilver, &s;u&s;tained by pillars of the &s;ame metal, round which were four &s;pacious galleries: a brook of limpid water cro&s;&s;ed this hall and the&s;e galleries, while the &s;umptuous edifice was lighted by an infini|ty of lamps and flambeaux. All is &s;hining, all daz|zles in the&s;e &s;ubterranean regions; the lights are re|flected and multiplied by the &s;ilver walls and vaults, and the chry&s;tal waters, which wind along the hall.</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o and Theli&s;mar entered the galleries, where they found crowds of people variou&s;ly employ|ed; farther on Alphon&s;o di&s;covered hou&s;es, &s;aw hor&s;es and carriages pa&s;s and repa&s;s; and, moreo|ver, to his inconceivable a&s;toni&s;hment, perceived a windmill.</P>
<P>What! mamma, interrupted Caroline, a &s;ubter|ranean town of &s;ilver, and in that town hor&s;es, car|riages, and a windmill!</P>
<P>The town exi&s;ts at this moment, exactly as I have de&s;cribed: but let me fini&s;h my tale, my dear, with|out farther interruption.</P>
<P>While Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o were beholding the&s;e wonders, Theli&s;mar &s;huddered, on remarking the lights began to burn blue. He looked up, and &s;aw above his head a kind of whiti&s;h veil: he in&s;tant|ly took Alphon&s;o by the arm, dragged him down, and forced him to lie with his face upon the floor; at the &s;ame moment, a terrible and univer&s;al &s;hriek re&s;ounded through the vaults; the lamps were all ex|tingui&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> and to an illumination the mo&s;t brilliant,

&s;ucceeded darkne&s;s the mo&s;t horrid, which was yet augmented by a profound and utter &s;ilence.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, in a few &s;econds, a noi&s;e was heard like the di&s;charge of a cannon, when in&s;tantly every body ro&s;e, and cried the danger is over; the lamps were re-lighted, and Theli&s;mar turning towards Alphon&s;o, &s;aid, death has pa&s;&s;ed over our heads. Such is the fearful peril to which men are often expo&s;ed, in the&s;e profound deeps which avarice has dug. Alas! the&s;e unhappy people deprived of the cheerful light of day, enjoy not the riches they wre&s;t from the bo&s;om of the earth: mi&s;ery buries them in the&s;e tombs of terror, and, in&s;tead of enjoying the riches that pa&s;s through their hands, they have &s;carce enough to buy them food; their days are con&s;ecrated to the mo&s;t painful labours; their health is de&s;troyed, and their term of wretchedne&s;s is &s;hortened (64).</P>
<P>How much, cried Alphon&s;o, you intere&s;t me in favour of the&s;e unfortunate victims! Poor unhappy creatures! But look, added Alphon&s;o, what is the matter yonder, where that crowd is a&s;&s;embled!</P>
<P>Alphon&s;o ran towards the other end of the gallery, and Theli&s;mar followed: they were told, that one of the workmen, not having put out his light quick e|nough when the mephitic vapour di&s;charged it&s;elf, was wounded, and that they were endeavouring to give him a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Let us run, &s;aid Theli&s;mar, I have a bottle in my pocket, which may be of &s;ervice to him perhaps.</P>
<P>They made their way through the crowd with all the ha&s;te they could; the unfortunate man was laying &s;en&s;ele&s;s extended upon the ground; he is dead, &s;aid

one of his comrades, &s;eeing Theli&s;mar advance. Al|phon&s;o, with a compa&s;&s;ionate heart, drew near; his eyes, dim by tears, were ca&s;t towards the mournful object&mdash;He &s;huddered! &s;tarted back!&mdash;&s;prang again towards him!&mdash;beheld him with di&s;traction in his countenance! his blood froze in his veins! his hair &s;tood an end; and, as if a thunderbolt had &s;truck him, he fell &s;peechle&s;s and lifele&s;s to the earth.</P>
<P>Theli&s;mar flew to the &s;uccour of Alphon&s;o; he gave orders to the people who &s;urrounded the &s;uppo&s;ed dead man, and then had Alphon&s;o carried into another gallery; in about half a quarter of an hour Alphon&s;o gave &s;ome &s;igns of life, and &s;ome time after came more to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Then it was, that the mo&s;t horrible de&s;pair was &s;een in his looks, and disfigured his features&mdash;It is my father, cried he!

Oh God! in what dreadful &s;tate have I found him!&mdash;But he is dead! and do I exi&s;t!&mdash;have I enjoyed the light of heaven, while my father has uttered groans in this place of death and terrors!&mdash;Leave me, continued he, pu&s;hing Theli&s;mar from him, with wild ferocity in his eyes; fly a mon&s;ter unworthy to revi&s;it the day. I renounce happine&s;s, the world, and the ble&s;&s;ed &s;un. This cave &s;hall be my tomb, as it is, alas! that of my mo&s;t wretched father; in death at lea&s;t we &s;hall be united.</P>
<P>During this &s;cene of di&s;traction, Alphon&s;o in vain endeavoured to e&s;cape from the arms of his friend: hold, cried Theli&s;mar, hold Alphon&s;o; knowe&s;t thou

Theli&s;mar and Alphon&s;o immediately left the gal|lery, called their guides, and were drawn out of the pit: they were obliged to return on foot, but they were met half way by the hor&s;es and &s;ervants of Theli&s;mar. Alphon&s;o eagerly que&s;tioned the dome|&s;tics concerning his father, but received only vague and un&s;atisfactory an&s;wers; his doubts and &s;u&s;pi|cions again revived, till his fears became in&s;upport|able.</P>
<P>At la&s;t they got home, and Alphon&s;o in vain en|deavoured to follow Theli&s;mar into the &s;ick man's chamber.

<P>Alphon&s;o, obliged to &s;ubmit, pa&s;&s;ed the day in an|xiety and trouble too violent to be de&s;cribed. Un|able, however, any longer to &s;upport his incertitude, he re&s;olved to hide his intentions from Theli&s;mar, and vi&s;it his father when every body was gone to re&s;t. Accordingly, about midnight, he went to the cham|ber&punc; door of the &s;ick per&s;on, and knowing the bed was placed &s;o that he might enter the chamber with|out being &s;een, he &s;oftly opened the door. With trembling &s;teps he entered the room, and as he en|tered, heard the voice of Don Ramirez; his &s;en&s;a|tions were &s;o &s;trong he could &s;carcely &s;upport him|&s;elf: but, alas! what were his feelings at hearing his father's di&s;cour&s;e, who was raving in a fit of delirium.</P>

<P>Alphon&s;o, unable longer to contain, was going to ca&s;t him&s;elf in his father's arms: but the watchful Theli&s;mar appeared, caught hold of him, and in &s;pite of his cries and re&s;i&s;tance, tore him from the chamber.</P>
<P>A phy&s;ician, whom Theli&s;mar had &s;ent for, came; at fir&s;t he was doubtful; but in a few hours Don Ra|mirez became more calm, his delirium was gone, and the phy&s;ician pronounced him out of danger: the tran&s;ports of Alphon&s;o's joy could now be only equal|led by his late exce&s;s of grief; and as &s;oon as his hopes for his father were confirmed, his tenderne&s;s and obedience to Theli&s;mar returned. During the la&s;t few hours, Theli&s;mar, for the fir&s;t time, had found him unju&s;t, ob&s;tinate, and head&s;trong; but no

&s;ooner was he a&s;&s;ured of his father's &s;afety, than he became more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, rea&s;onable, and tender than ever, towards his benefactor.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Don Ramirez heard he was at the hou&s;e of Theli&s;mar, he in&s;tantly a&s;ked, with an ex|clamation of &s;urprize, for Alphon&s;o; and it was now impo&s;&s;ible any longer to defer the interview: Theli&s;|mar therefore &s;ought for, and brought him into the chamber of Don Ramirez. Alphon&s;o agitated, hop|ing, fearing, bathed in tears, ran and fell on his knees by his father's bed-&s;ide, who&s;e arms were extended to receive him.</P>
<P>Oh my father! cried Alphon&s;o, dear author of my being! Are you given back to me at la&s;t? and will you receive your guilty &s;on again? Ah! &s;urely you read my heart, or you could not: you there behold my repentance, my remor&s;e, my love!&mdash;Yes, my fa|ther, my life hereafter &s;hall be con&s;ecrated to you.

<P>Is it not an illu&s;ion? at la&s;t, &s;aid Don Ramirez, Is it Alphon&s;o? is it my &s;on that I pre&s;s to my bo|&s;om?&mdash;I accu&s;e thee not of thy errors and wretched|ne&s;s, both were equally mine: but heaven is appea&s;ed, and we are again united; again I &s;ee thee, and all my &s;ufferings are repaid.</P>
<P>The weakne&s;s of Don Ramirez would not &s;uffer him to &s;peak any more: he became pale, and his

head, heavy and helple&s;s, dropped on the cheek of his &s;on. Alphon&s;o, terrified, in&s;tantly ran for the phy&s;ician, who brought Don Ramirez to him&s;elf a|gain; but forbade any more &s;uch conver&s;ations for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>This meeting did not forward the recovery of Don Ramirez. However, in a few days he was capable of &s;itting up, and Alphon&s;o then related to him all his adventures. Don Ramirez gave a thou&s;and te&s;ti|monials of his gratitude to Theli&s;mar, and as &s;oon as he was quite well, he al&s;o would relate his hi&s;tory. He confe&s;&s;ed all his faults without re&s;ervation, and the whole circum&s;tance of the hi&s;tory of Alvarez, the virtuous Portugue&s;e hermit, whom he had met with on Mont-Serrat.</P>
<P>When he came to the epocha of the flight of Al|phon&s;o, he thus continued his tale:</P>
<Q><P>The departure of my &s;on grieved me &s;o much the more, ina&s;much as it was impo&s;&s;ible not to look upon it as a ju&s;t puni&s;hment inflicted by hea|ven, and the effect of the imprecations before pronounced again&s;t me by a wretched father. Alas! &s;aid I, how equitable are the decrees of Provi|dence! I made an ill u&s;e of power and fortune, and heaven has deprived me of both. My dete&s;t|ed ambition robbed the unhappy Alvarez of a wife and &s;on; and the wrath divine has, at la&s;t, &s;tripped me of the only comfort which could &s;up|ply the want of the re&s;t; my &s;on, my &s;ole hope, Alphon&s;o abandons me; and though thus arrived at the height of my mi&s;ery, I have not a right

even to complain; Fate has done me no wrong; it is all my own work.</P>
<P>Thus did I weep over my de&s;tiny, and thus was I obliged to admire Omnipotent Ju&s;tice by which I was pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>I learnt, after diligent enquiries, my &s;on had taken the rout to Cadiz. I could not, however, follow him immediately, as was my intention and de&s;ire; detained at Grenada by a violent fe|ver, I was obliged there to remain for &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>Though I could not hope to find my &s;on at Cadiz, I &s;till pre&s;i&s;ted in my de&s;ign of going there, from a &s;uppo&s;ition that I might get farther intelligence. When I came to Loxe I put up at an inn, where, after the de&s;cription I gave of my &s;on, and the an&s;wers of the inn-keeper, I could not doubt of his having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome hours in the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>Fatherly fondne&s;s made me de&s;irous of &s;leeping in his chamber; every part of which I examined with great care and anxiety. I perceived &s;ome Portugue&s;e characters cut on the gla&s;s; I could not mi&s;take the hand of Alphon&s;o, and in a &s;in|gle couplet, I &s;aw the name of Dalinda three times repeated. The &s;ame name was written too upon the walls; the circum&s;tance &s;truck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I entered it in my tablets.</P>
<P>When I came to Cadiz, I enquired both for Alphon&s;o and Dalinda; but they were names totally unknown to every body that heard them. At la&s;t, however, I heard a young Portugue&s;e, who had carefully concealed his name and birth,
<PB N="168" REF="020385_0167_0FAF01131071FDD0">
had pa&s;&s;ed ten days at Cadiz with a young lady, whom it was &s;u&s;pected he had run off with, and that the two fugitives were gone to France, there, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed, to re&s;ide.</P>
<P>I did not doubt but my &s;on was the Portugue&s;e in que&s;tion, and that the young lady was Dalinda, with whom I had di&s;covered Alphon&s;o was in love; I re&s;olved, therefore, to go to France; but it was fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould vi&s;it Li&s;bon, to re|ceive the money due upon my pen&s;ion, and I then departed for Paris.</P>
<P>After much time and many pains &s;pent in &s;earching, I traced at la&s;t the fugitives, concern|ing whom I had heard at Cadiz; and the re&s;ult of all my cares and di&s;coveries was, I found two per&s;ons to whom I was ab&s;olutely unknown. I had hitherto been &s;upported by the hope of find|ing my &s;on; and when I lo&s;t a hope &s;o dear to my heart, I drooped and fell into the mo&s;t me|lancholy &s;tate of de&s;pair. Totally detached from the world, I formed the project of quitting it, never to return, and burying my&s;elf in the &s;ame &s;olitude which the virtuous Alvarez had cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Arrived at Mont-Serrat, I went immediately to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">grotto of Alvarez, but alas! the venerable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man approached the term of his exi&s;tence; I round him on the bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k of the grave.</P>
<P>He received me, however, with that unaltera|ble bounty by which his actions were characteriz|ed; I told him my misfortunes, and he li&s;tened with tenderne&s;s to the recital. May&s;t thou find, &s;aid he, in this peaceable a&s;ylum, comforts that

&s;hall a&s;&s;uage thy griefs; if thou wilt remain in this grotto, thou wilt &s;oon enjoy it without a ri|val; and oh! in abandoning it to thee, would to heaven I could leave thee al&s;o the tranquillity I enjoy.</P>
<P>Such was my reception with Alvarez. With new a&s;toni&s;hment I viewed a virtue &s;o perfect; far from finding that his pre&s;ence augmented my unea&s;ine&s;s and remor&s;e, I found my&s;elf le&s;s agita|ted in his company, received an inexpre&s;&s;ible de|light in li&s;tening to, looking at, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, my affection for him was every in&s;tant redoubled, and I would willingly have prolonged his life at the expence of my own.</P>
<P>I had not at fir&s;t related to him the particulars of my misfortunes; I had only told him, that my &s;on had run from me; that I knew not what was become of him, and that, from &s;ome mi&s;tak|en imformations, I had vainly &s;ought for him in France. Alvarez afterwards begged me to be more preci&s;e; and I then mentioned, among o|ther things, the two Portugue&s;e ver&s;es I had found on the window of the inn, at Loxe.</P>
<P>Scarcely had I pronounced the name of Da|linda, before I was interrupted by Alvarez<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aid he, and look in that che&s;t of drawers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> book, in which, during the&s;e la&s;t ten years, I have written the names of &s;uch &s;trangers as have come to vi&s;it the hermitage. I flew as directed, brought the book, and Alvarez found the following memo|randum.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="020385_0169_0FAF01145CCEAA10">
This twentieth of June, I have received a vi&s;it from a Swedi&s;h family; the father &s;peaks tolerable Portugue&s;e, has charmed me by his knowledge and &s;implicity of manners; he is going to Spain, embarks at Cadiz for Africa, and his name is The|li&s;mar: his daughter is remarkable for her beauty and mode&s;ty. Her father de&s;ired her to &s;hew me &s;ome land&s;capes of her own drawing, and &s;he took a book from her pocket, in which were &s;everal, all de&s;igned after nature, except one, which &s;he had done from memory, and which was certainly the be&s;t and prettie&s;t among them: it was a repre&s;en|tation of the Fountain of Love, in the Province of Beira. The name of this young lady is Dalin|da.</P>
<P>This note cleared up all my doubts, and gave me the fir&s;t joyous &s;en&s;ation I had felt &s;ince I re-returned from France; for though I had &s;till cau&s;e enough to be very unea&s;y, I now had di&s;covered &s;ome certain intelligence, by the help of which I might hope to find my &s;on.</P>
<P>Alvarez farther informed me, Theli&s;mar had &s;aid he intended to travel four years, before he re-returned to Sweden; for which rea&s;on, &s;aid Alva|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> if your &s;on is with him, it will be two years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ger 'ere you &s;ee him again; nor can you hope to hear any thing of Alphon&s;o, except by going to Sweden.</P>
<P>No, Alvarez, &s;aid I, I will not now abandon you in helple&s;s age; you offered an a&s;ylum to your per&s;ecutor, advi&s;ed him, con&s;oled, and deigned to accept his little &s;ervices: &s;uch magnanimity, while

it doubles my repentance, dimini&s;hes the dreadful terrors of my guilt: when Alvarez is no longer angry with me, I hope the avenging God, who pur&s;ues me, will be appea&s;ed&mdash;And yet, alas! I am indebted to religion only for this forgivene&s;s: could your heart be reconciled, and become a part of mine, I &s;hould then hope for heaven's protec|tion.</P>
<P>My eyes were filled with tears as I &s;poke; and Alvarez, with a look of mo&s;t affectionate tender|ne&s;s, an&s;wered, And is it po&s;&s;ible that my friend|&s;hip &s;hould &s;often thy chagrin, and calm the cruel agitation of thy &s;oul!&mdash;W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll&mdash;be &s;atisfied&mdash;I accept thy hand, thy friendly &s;uccours; yes, the hand of Don Ramirez &s;hall clo&s;e the eyes of Alvarez.</P>
<P>The virtuous old man could no longer retain his tears, while I but too forcibly felt what the cutting remembrance mu&s;t be, which then offered it&s;elf to his imagination: at the very moment he a&s;&s;ured me of his friend&s;hip, the unfortunate old man wept for his &s;on.</P>
<P>The night after this conver&s;ation, Alvarez feel|ing him&s;elf more oppre&s;&s;ed than u&s;ual, wi&s;hed to ri&s;e; he leaned on my arm, and went into his gar|den: he &s;at down, the moon's rays &s;hone upon his countenance; and while their &s;ilver light increa&s;ed his palene&s;s, they gave him a mild, an affecting, an augu&s;t &s;erenity; he rai&s;ed his eyes and hands to heaven, and for a few moments, &s;eemed ab&s;orbed in a kind of trance; then afterwards turning to|wards me&mdash;</P>

<P>Within the &s;mall circum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ance of the humble retreat of Alvarez, by the &s;ide of a fountain, and beneath a &s;hade of Olives, I rai&s;ed, with my own hands, the ru&s;tic tomb, in which are depo&s;ited the precious remains of the mo&s;t virtuous of men.</P>
<P>This duty fulfilled, my fir&s;t wi&s;h was to depart for Sweden; but money was nece&s;&s;ary to under|take &s;o long a voyage; and I wrote to Portugal to inform them I was &s;till in exi&s;tence, and was obliged to travel to the north; begging they would &s;o far favour me, as to pay my pen&s;ion two years in advance; my petition was accordingly granted. I went for the la&s;t time to the &s;hade of Olives, where &s;lept the peaceful bones of Al|varez, watered the gra&s;s with my tears, and wept over the flowers that grew around his tomb. Af|ter which I quitted Mont-Serrat and Spain, and took the route to Sweden.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I came to Stockholm, my fir&s;t en|quiry was to know if Theli&s;mar had returned: I learnt he was not expected in le&s;s than a year, that his wife and daughter were not with him, and that they re&s;ided at a country-hou&s;e near Sal&s;eberi&s;t. I was preparing to go thither, when I was in|formed

a per&s;on named Frederic, an intimate friend of Theli&s;mar's, who had travelled with him, was every day expected at Stockholm.</P>
<P>Determined, as &s;oon as I heard this, to &s;ee the per&s;on thus de&s;cribed, I continued &s;ome few months longer at Stockholm: at la&s;t he arrived, I &s;aw him, &s;poke to him without making my&s;elf known, que&s;tioned him concerning Theli&s;mar, and learnt, beyond a doubt, Alphon&s;o &s;till exi&s;ted, and that Providence had graciou&s;ly placed him under the &s;afeguard of Religion and Virtue.</P>
<P>Convinced my &s;on was &s;till alive, I felt more forcibly than ever the unhappine&s;s of having been thus abandoned: alas!

<P>Frederic not being able to tell me where The|li&s;mar then was, I determined to go to Sal&s;ebe|ri&s;t; but I found neither the charming Dalinda, whom I de&s;ired &s;o much to &s;ee, nor her mother there: I was informed they were gone abroad, and were to return to Sal&s;eberi&s;t, with Theli&s;mar.

Don Ramirez ended, and Alphon&s;o, who&s;e tears had more than once interrupted the &s;orrowful tale, threw him&s;elf at his father's feet with every expre&s;|&s;ion, every mark of repentance, gratitude, and af|fection, which the be&s;t and noble&s;t mind could feel. Don Ramirez, at the height of happine&s;s, cla&s;ped his &s;on in his arms, and bathed him with his tears, while Theli&s;mar, in a rapture of &s;ilence, beheld the moving &s;cene.</P>
<P>At la&s;t Alphon&s;o, Don Ramirez, and Theli&s;mar, departed for Stockholm. Alphon&s;o now &s;aw the love|ly Dalinda, and made him&s;elf large amends, for the painful &s;ilence to which he had been &s;o long con|demned: and Dalinda, in learning that &s;he had been five years beloved, learnt al&s;o the power which ho|nour and gratitude had over her lover. Then it was, that Alphon&s;o applauded him&s;elf for having &s;o faith|fully kept his word: by this virtuous effort he had entirely gained the friend&s;hip and heart of Dalinda.</P>
<P>The happy Alphon&s;o received the hand of Dalin|da, and by his virtues and conduct ju&s;tified the choice and affection of the generous Theli&s;mar; the wrongs he had done his father he expiated by an unbounded attachment and&punc; &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and the mo&s;t tender attentions. They lived always in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and it became his glory and felicity to fulfil the exten&s;ive duties of nature, gratitude, and friend|&s;hip. Thus did he con&s;titute the happine&s;s of his father, his benefactor, and his dear Dalinda.</P>

And the conver&s;ation of this evening, as well as the &s;tory, an&s;wered Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, as &s;he ro&s;e from her &s;eat.</P>
<P>Oh, what a pity!&mdash;but the notes?</P>
<P>We will begin to read them to-morrow.</P>
<P>How I <HI>do</HI> long to &s;ee the&s;e notes!</P>
<P>Well you may, they are much more intere&s;ting than my tale; but at pre&s;ent bed is the propere&s;t place.</P>
<P>The next day Madame de Cl&eacute;mire a&s;ked her chil|dren, whether they thought &s;he had fulfilled her promi&s;e, to write a &s;tory as miraculous as a Fairy Tale, the marvellous of which &s;hould yet be true.</P>
<P>Oh yes, mamma, replied Caroline; and &s;ince there are &s;o many extraordinary and curious things in nature, you may be certain we &s;hall not &s;eek the miracles we delight to hear of in Fairy Tales any more.</P>
<P>By reading books which &s;hall in&s;truct you, &s;aid Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, you will learn many other things as &s;urprizing as tho&s;e I have &s;elected. Had I u&s;ed all the extracts I have made, the hi&s;tory of Alphon&s;o would have been in two volumes, and a better work; for, in order to abridge it, I was o|bliged to omit incidents which would have better connected the different parts, as well as an infinity of curious phaenomena. Yet my extracts contain nothing but well avouched facts. I have rejected not only &s;uch as appeared fabulous, but even doubt|ful. Had I been le&s;s &s;crupulous, I &s;hould have told you of a village where all the inhabitants became i|diots

<P>It &s;eems, for example, &s;aid the Abb&eacute; to Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, you might have made &s;omething more of the phaenomena electricity affords, either in the cour&s;e of the &s;tory, or in the notes.</P>
<P>I could do nothing better in that re&s;pect, I a&s;&s;ure you, an&s;wered Madame de Cl&eacute;mire; and that for a very good rea&s;on: I am ignorant of experimental philo&s;ophy, a cour&s;e of which I have gone through, like many others, and, like many others, am not much the wifer.</P>

My dear Abb&eacute;, an&s;wered Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, a woman ought never to &s;uffer a man to add a &s;ingle word to her writings; if &s;he does, the man &s;he con|&s;ults, let him be who he may, will always pa&s;s for the original inventor, and &s;he will be accu&s;ed of put|ting her name to the works of others.

The&s;e, and many other &s;imilar examples, ought, in my opinion, to prevent women from con&s;ulting men concerning their works, and from forming any inti|mate connections with men of letters.</P>
<P>This conclu&s;ion hurt the &s;elf-love of the Abb&eacute;. And &s;o, madam, &s;aid he, with a forced &s;mile, if ever you &s;hould become an author, and print your works, you would not con&s;ult any per&s;on.</P>
<P>Pardon me, replied Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, I &s;hould &s;eek to know the truth, and not vain compliments or flattery.

<P>The Abb&eacute; was piqued, and made no reply; Ma|dame de Cl&eacute;mire, therefore, changed the conver&s;a|tion, and the children returned to the tale they had ju&s;t heard.</P>

<P>A-propos of &s;ingular animals, interrupted Ma|dame de Cl&eacute;mire, I have a number of them in my extracts, which are not mentioned in my tale; one of them I ju&s;t now recollect, do you wi&s;h to hear it de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>O dear, yes mamma, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="020385_0181_0FAF011E443ED678">
Imagine then a hairy mon&s;ter, of a yellow ca&s;t, with eight legs, each of which is armed with two large claws, and each containing a moi&s;t &s;ponge; be&s;ides the&s;e eight legs, this mon&s;ter has &s;omething like two hands, with which it &s;eizes its prey. Ar|gus&punc; like, its head is covered with eyes, for it has eight, which are circularly ranged in front, while two pair of horrible pincers, armed wtih &s;harp claws, &s;eem to i&s;&s;ue from its mouth.</P>
<P>Oh, what a hideous and extraordinary mon&s;ter that is!</P>
<P>There are many others, &s;till more &s;ingular; would you believe nature produces creatures, which are in|crea&s;ed by cutting them; that the &s;ame creature cut into eight, ten, twenty, thirty, or forty parts, is &s;o many times multiplied?</P>

<P>The name of that creature is not difficult to di|vine, &s;aid the Abb&eacute;.</P>
<P>But what is the other, added Pulcheria, can you tell that?</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, &s;aid the Abb&eacute;, that the de&s;cription your mamma has given of it, is ab&s;olutely enigmatical to me.</P>

<P>I what country is this mon&s;ter found, mamma?</P>

<P>A &s;pider! I &s;hould never have thought of a &s;pi|der. How can a &s;pider have eight eyes, a moi&s;t &s;ponge between its claws, and pincers at the &s;ide of its mouth?</P>
<P>Had you ever examined a &s;pider with a micro|&s;cope, you would have perfectly di&s;tingui&s;hed all the&s;e particulars, and you may &s;ee them even with the naked eye on a large &s;pider.</P>
<P>I will a&s;k Augu&s;tin to bring me large &s;piders, for I mu&s;t &s;ee their &s;ponges, pincers, and eight eyes.</P>
<P>And I will read you the natural hi&s;tory of &s;piders, which I am &s;ure will very much amu&s;e you, and in which you will find many extraordinary circum&s;tan|ces.</P>
<P>And what is the name of the other creature, mam|ma, which multiples by being divided?</P>
<P>The fre&s;h water polypus (68).</P>
<P>Oh! I do not know that; it is not to be found in this country; and I think it is much more curious than the &s;pider.</P>

<P>What, mamma, will you &s;end for them from abroad? I am &s;ure you are very good.</P>
<P>You &s;hall have them to-morrow&mdash;the ponds of Champcery are full of them.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="020385_0183_0FAF011F8FECFEF0">
Why, is it po&s;&s;ible? and we not know the name of &s;o extraordinary a creature!</P>
<P>Nature every where abounds with mo&s;t &s;urprizing phaenomena; ignorance is deprived of the plea&s;ure of knowing, of admiring them, while the philo&s;opher finds, at every &s;tep, objects worthy to excite, and to &s;atisfy his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Oh dear mamma! we will a&s;k, we will read, we will buy micro&s;copes, and examine all the in&s;ects of Champcery, and at lea&s;t become acquainted with the curious things around us.</P>
<P>The Abb&eacute; who had been a little vexed with him|&s;elf for not knowing the &s;pider, at la&s;t broke &s;ilence. As your mamma has judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erved, &s;aid he, the tale of Alphon&s;o contains but a &s;mall part of the phaenomena of nature: thus, for example, &s;he has neither mentioned beavers nor elephants.</P>
<P>Perhaps that is, becau&s;e mamma knew we were acquainted with the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e animals, &s;aid Cae&s;ar,</P>
<P>But, continued Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, I have &s;aid nothing of numerous other animals, as &s;ingular and much le&s;s known, &s;uch as the toucan (69) the ka|michi (70) bats (71), &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Abb&eacute;, who was ran&s;acking his memory to find &s;omething miraculous, which Madame de Cl&eacute;|mire had forgot in her tale, proceeded thus. It is certain, &s;aid he, that be&s;ides animals, the vegetable and mineral regions pre&s;ent a crowd of phaenomena, concerning which your mamma could not &s;peak in &s;o &s;hort a work. I think, however, &s;he might have found an advantageous opportunity of mentioning
<PB N="185" REF="020385_0184_0FAF0121E71DBBA0">
the wax-tree (72), the &s;en&s;itive-plant (73), fraxi|nella (74), and the amianthus (75).</P>
<P>After having run over this catalogue with great gravity, the Abb&eacute; ro&s;e and left the room, exceed|ingly well fatisfied with his memory. Pulcheria began to laugh. It is my opinion, &s;aid &s;he, mam|ma, M. Fr&eacute;mont is a little vexed with you.</P>
<P>And if he be, replied Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, why &s;hould you remind me of it? Though he may be too &s;u&s;ceptible, too liable to be out of humour, he is the more excu&s;able, becau&s;e he has never lived among the great; where, while people acquire a &s;upple temper, and a refinement which teaches them to hide their own preten&s;ions, and the little ridiculous exce&s;|&s;es of &s;elf-love, they often lo&s;e &s;incerity, the fir&s;t of virtues. I have more than once reminded you of what you owe to the preceptor of your brother. I have often repeated too, that we are not only for|bidden to make (even confidentially) malignant ob|&s;ervations on tho&s;e with whom we live in intimacy, but that we ought al&s;o to bani&s;h the remembrance of their defects, and reject &s;uch thoughts as would make us recollect their errors.</P>
<P>Pulcheria was greatly affected by this le&s;&s;on; but as &s;he had only &s;aid a ra&s;h word for want of reflec|tion, as &s;he wept without &s;ullenne&s;s, and as &s;he tru|ly repented of her fault, &s;he &s;oon obtained her par|don, and re&s;umed her gaiety.</P>
<P>Eight or ten evenings were &s;pent in reading the notes to the hi&s;tory of Alphon&s;o. When they were ended, Cae&s;ar ob&s;erved there was one of the prodi|gies
<PB N="186" REF="020385_0185_0FAF0122CA561670">
yet unexplained. In the Canary i&s;lands, con|tinued he, after the adventure of the cavern and the Guanches, Alphon&s;o wandered to the borders of a lake, where he &s;aw the miraculous pillar, and the &s;trange hail-&s;torm: but what was more &s;trange, when he returned home, be found Theli&s;mar knew every thing that had happened to him at the lake; nay, that he &s;aw him there, though he was on his own terrace, at two leagues di&s;tance.</P>
<P>True, replied Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, I have not explained this latter miracle in my notes; but come and breakfa&s;t to-morrow morning in the little belvi|dere at the high end of the meadow, and I will &s;hew you Theli&s;mar's &s;ecret.</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition was joyfully accepted by the young family, and the next morning every body a&s;|&s;embled at the place appointed before eight o'clock. Here the children found a large machine, which greatly excited their curio&s;ity: they a&s;ked its name, and were told it was a tele&s;cope.</P>
<P>Sit down on that chair, Caroline, &s;aid Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, and look into this end of the in&s;trument through that gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Dear! dear! what do I &s;ee! cried Caroline; a large hou&s;e not two &s;teps off!</P>
<P>And yet it is a league di&s;tant, &s;aid Madame de Cl&eacute;mire; it is the chateau of M. de Lu&s;anne.</P>
<P>Well, that &s;eems incredible! I can perfectly di|&s;tingui&s;h all the people who pa&s;s and repa&s;s in the court-yard. There! now I &s;ee a &s;ervant feeding the fowls&mdash;and now a cow leading to gra&s;s&mdash;and now a poor woman begging&mdash;and now&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="020385_0186_0FAF0123581BF770">
Nay, nay, interrupted Pulcheria, impatiently, you mu&s;t let me &s;ee a little too, my dear &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Scarcely had Pulcheria taken her &s;eat, before a joyous exclamation broke forth. O mamma, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;ee Sidonia; I am &s;ure it is her, &s;he &s;peaks to the &s;ervants&mdash;I will warrant &s;he has the charge of the court-yard, for &s;he &s;eems to give orders. Oh! that is charming at her age; I wi&s;h I was as old that I might do the &s;ame!&mdash;There, now &s;he &s;toops&mdash;now &s;he ri&s;es&mdash;now &s;he &s;toops again.&mdash;Oh! &s;he is &s;urely collecting the eggs&mdash;ay it is &s;o, for &s;omebody gives her a ba&s;ket&mdash;and now &s;he turns towards the poor beggar-woman.&mdash;Pray Cae&s;ar, continued Pulcheria, permit me to look a little long|er&mdash;Sidonia goes to the old woman&mdash;&s;peaks to her&mdash;makes her come into the court-yard, and &s;it down on a bench&mdash;Sidonia leaves her ba&s;ket with her, and runs&mdash;</P>
<P>Every one in their turn &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid Cae&s;ar.</P>
<P>Nay, one moment brother&mdash;Sidonia comes back, but very gently&mdash;&s;he holds a large bowl in her hands&mdash;I fancy it is milk&mdash;There! &s;he gives it to the old woman!&mdash;Oh how I love that good Sidonia!</P>
<P>So &s;aying, Pulcheria ro&s;e, and Cae&s;ar took her place. Sidonia had left the court-yard, and nothing intere&s;ting was going forward; but he comprehended which way Theli&s;mar might di&s;tinctly &s;ee Alphon&s;o from his terrace, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;tance by which they were &s;eparated.</P>
<P>They &s;poke of nothing all day, but the tele&s;cope and Sidonia. Pulcheria admired the &s;ingular man|ner
<PB N="188" REF="020385_0187_0FAF012421181390">
in which &s;he had di&s;overed the benevolent cha|racter of that young lady. She did not &s;uppo&s;e, continued Pulcheria, that we could &s;ee all that was pa&s;&s;ing in the court-yard.</P>
<P>Chance, added Madame de Cl&eacute;mire, and an infi|nity of unfore&s;een circum&s;tances, every day di&s;cover actions much more &s;ecretly performed. The be&s;t way, therefore, is to act as if all the world looked on; for not only does the Almighty &s;ee and judge every incident of our lives, but accident, curio&s;ity, the indi&s;cretion of &s;ervants, and the treachery of fal&s;e friends, uncea&s;ingly expo&s;e to open day our mo&s;t hidden &s;ecrets.</P>

<P><Q>The Ancients, &s;ays M. de Bomare, knew the load&s;tone would attract iron; and if Pliny may be be|lieved, it was found out by a &s;hepherd, who felt that the nails of his &s;hoes, and the ferrule of his &s;taff, &s;tuck to ae rock of load-&s;tone over which he pa&s;&s;ed; but they knew not its polar direction,</Q></P>
<P>Alphon&s;o, full of ignorance and remor&s;e, and already terrified at the meteor he had &s;een, feeling him&s;elf fixed to the rock, believed it proceeded from the wrath of heaven, as a puni&s;hment for his flight.

<P><Q>The load-&s;tone is ferruginous, and is found in iron-mines; its colour varies with the country where it is found; it has five remarkable properties: 1.

It is &s;uppo&s;ed there is a kind of atmo&s;phere round the load-&s;tone, which forms an active vortex, and is &s;en&s;ibly di&s;|covered by its contrary effects, the one of attracting, the other of repelling iron. The attractive force of the load-&s;tone, ju&s;t taken from the mine, is not great, for which rea&s;on it is obliged to be armed to augment its power.

<P N="29">(29) This bird is called flamingo, or phenicopetra, or becharu; which &s;econd name among the Greeks, &s;ignified the bird of flaming wing, becau&s;e when it flies again&s;t the &s;un, it appears like a firebrand. The plumage, when young, is ro&s;e coloured, and at ten months old, the colour of fire. <Q>Its beak, &s;ays M. de Buffon, is of a very ex|traordinary form, its legs exce&s;&s;ively high, its neck long and dented; its body &s;tands higher, though it is le&s;s than the &s;tork's; and its form, &s;omewhat odd, makes it di&s;tingui&s;hable from that of every other fi&s;hing bird.</Q></P>

<P>The flamingo is certainly a bird of pa&s;&s;age, and are nu|merous at St. Domingo and the Antilles; they fly in &s;ociety, and naturally form them&s;elves into a line, &s;o that at a cer|tain di&s;tance they re&s;emble a brick wall, and, &s;omewhat nearer, &s;oldiers arranged in rank and file.

This &s;cene, which the idea of an enternal adieu rendered but too affecting, became more &s;o, when the &s;i&s;ter, with &s;treaming eyes, attend|ing only to her cau&s;e of grief, rent her garments, and tore her hair up by the root, to &s;trew over the coffin of a brother, whom &s;he was &s;oon no more to &s;ee.

<P N="48">(48) There are two &s;ea&s;ons of pearl fi&s;hing in the year; the fir&s;t in March and April, the &s;econd in Augu&s;t and September; the more rain there falls in the year, the more plentiful are the fi&s;heries. In the opening of the &s;ea&s;on, there appear &s;ometimes 250 barks on the banks. In the larger barks are two divers, in the &s;maller one. Each bark puts off from &s;hore before &s;un-ri&s;e, by a land breeze, which never fails, and returns again by a &s;ea-breeze, that &s;ucceeds it at noon.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the barks are arrived where the fi&s;h lie, and have ca&s;t anchor, each diver binds a &s;tone, &s;ix inches thick, and a foot long, under his body, which is to &s;erve him as balla&s;t, prevent his being driven away by the motion of the water, and enable him to walk more &s;teadily among the waves.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, they tie another very heavy &s;toneto one foot, whereby they are &s;oon &s;unk to the bottom of the &s;ea; and as the oy&s;ters are u&s;ually &s;trongly fa&s;tened to the rocks, they arm their fingers with leathern mittens, to prevent them from being wounded, on &s;craping them violently off; and &s;ome even carry an iron rake for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Each diver carries down with him a large net, in manner of a &s;ack, tied to his neck by a long cold, the
<PB N="221" REF="020385_0220_0FAF09D3DA6EC8E0">
end whereof is fa&s;tened to the &s;ide of the bark. The &s;ack is intended for the reception of the oy&s;ters gathered from the rock, and the cord is to pull up the diver when his bag is full, or when he wants air. In this equipage he preci|pitates him&s;elf above 60 feet under water. As he has no time to lo&s;e there, he is no &s;ooner arrived at the bottom, than he begins to run from &s;ide to &s;ide, &s;ometimes on &s;and, &s;ometimes on a clay earth, and &s;ometimes among the points of rocks, tearing off the oy&s;ters he meets with, and cramming them into his budget.</P>
<P>At whatever depth the divers be, the light is &s;o great, that they ea&s;ily behold what pa&s;&s;es in the &s;ea, with the &s;ame clearne&s;s as on land; and, to their con&s;ternation, they &s;ome|times &s;ee mon&s;trous fi&s;hes, from which all their addre&s;s in mudding the water, &amp;c. will not always &s;ave them, but they become their prey; and of all&punc; the perils of fi&s;hery, this is one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The be&s;t divers will keep under water half an hour, the re&s;t do not &s;tay le&s;s than a quarter; during which time they hold their breath, without the u&s;e of oils, or any other li|quors, only acquiring the habit by long practice. When they find them&s;elves &s;traightened, they pull the rope by which the bag is fa&s;tened, and hold fa&s;t by it with both hands; the people in the bark take the &s;ignal, and heave them up into the air, and unload them of their fi&s;h, which is &s;ometimes 500 oy&s;ters, and &s;ometimes not above 50.</P>
<P>Some of the divers need a moment's re&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ite to recover their breath, others jump in again in&s;tantly, continuing this violent exerci&s;e, without intermi&s;&s;ion, for many hours. They unload their barks on &s;hore, and lay their oy&s;ters in an infinite number of little pits, dug four or five feet &s;quare; then rai&s;e heaps of &s;and over them to the height of a man, which, at a di&s;tance, looks like an army ranged in battle. In this condition they are left, till the rain, wind and &s;un obliges them to open, which &s;oon kills them; upon this the fle&s;h rots and dries, and the pearls, thus di&s;engaged, tum|ble into the pit, upon taking the oy&s;ters out.</P>
<P>After clearing the pits of the gro&s;&s;er filth, they &s;ift the &s;and &s;everal times to &s;eparate the pearls; but what care &s;o|ever they take herein, they always loo&s;e a great many.

<P>Our Fi&s;hermen, &s;ays the author, unanimou&s;ly and inva|riably affirm, that, when they are &s;everal miles from the land, particularly in the hot &s;ummer days, and by their di&s;tance, and the bearings of &s;ome points of land, expect from eighty to a hundred fathoms deep, and do not find but from twenty to thirty, and more e&s;pecially if they find a more than u&s;ual quantity of cod and ling, they judge that the Kraken is at the bottom; but if they find, by their lines, that the water in the &s;ame place &s;till &s;hallows on them, they know he is ri&s;ing to the &s;urface, and row off with the great|e&s;t expedition, till they come into the u&s;ual &s;oundings of the place; when, lying on their oars, in a few minutes the mon&s;ter emerges, and &s;hews him&s;elf &s;ufficiently, though his whole body does not appear. Its back, or upper part, which &s;eems an Engli&s;h mile and an half in circumference, (&s;ome have affirmed more) looks at fir&s;t like a number of &s;mall i&s;lands, &s;urrounded with &s;omething that floats like &s;ea-weeds. At la&s;t, &s;everal bright points, or horns, appear, which grow thicker, the higher they emerge, and &s;ometimes &s;tand up as high and large as the ma&s;ts of middle-&s;ized ve&s;|&s;els. In a &s;hort time it &s;lowly &s;inks, which is thought as dangerous as its ri&s;ing; as it cau&s;es &s;uch a &s;well and whirl|pool, as draws every thing down with it, like that of Male-&s;trom. The Bi&s;hop ju&s;tly regrets the omi&s;&s;ion of, probably, the only opportunity that ever has, or may be pre&s;ented, of &s;urveying it alive, or &s;eeing it entire when dead. This, he informs us, once did occur, on the credit of the Reve|rend Mr. Friis, Mini&s;ter at Nordland, and Vicar of the College for promoting Chri&s;tian Kowledge; who informed him, that in 1680, a Kraken, (perhaps a young and care|le&s;s one, as they generally keep &s;everal leagues from land) came into the waters that run between the rocks and cliffs near Al&s;tahong; where, in turning about, &s;ome of its long

horns caught hold of &s;ome adjoining trees, which it might ea&s;ily have torn up, but that it was al&s;o entangled in &s;ome clifts of the rocks, whence it could not extricate it&s;elf, but putrefied on the &s;pot. Our author has heard of no per&s;on de&s;troyed by the Mon&s;ter, but relates a report of the dan|ger of two fi&s;hermen, who came upon a part of the water, full of the creature's thick &s;limy excrements (which he voids for &s;ome months, as he feeds for &s;ome others); they immediately rowed off, but were not quick enough, in turning, to &s;ave the boat from one of the Kraken's horns, which &s;o cru&s;hed the head of it, that it was with difficulty they &s;aved their lives on the wreck, though the weather was perfectly calm; the Mon&s;ter never appearing at other times. His excrement is &s;aid to be attractive of other fi&s;h, on which he feeds; which expedient was probably nece&s;|&s;ary, on account of his &s;low unwieldy motion, to his &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; as this &s;low motion again may be nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ecurity of &s;hips of the greate&s;t force and burthen, which mu&s;t be overwhelmed on encountering &s;uch an immen&s;e animal, if his velocity was equal to his weight; the Nor|wegians &s;uppo&s;ing, that if his arms, on which he moves, and with which he take his food, were to lay hold of the large&s;t man of war, they would pull it down to the bottom.</P>
<P>In confirmation of the reality of this animal, our learned author cites Debe's de&s;cription of Faroe, for the exi&s;tence of certain i&s;lands, which &s;uddenly appear, and as &s;uddenly vani&s;h. Many &s;eafaring men, he adds, give accounts of &s;uch, particularly the North-Sea; which their &s;uper&s;tition has either attributed to the delu&s;ion of the Devil, or con&s;i|dered as inhabited by evil &s;pirits. But our hone&s;t hi&s;torian, who is not for wronging the devil him&s;elf, &s;uppo&s;es &s;uch mi&s;taken i&s;lands to be nothing but the Kraken, called by &s;ome, the <HI>Sea Trolden</HI> or <HI>Sea Mi&s;chief;</HI> in which opinion he was greatly confirmed, by the following quotation of Dr. Hierne, a learned Swede, from Baron Grippen|hielm; and which is certainly a very remarkable pa&s;&s;age, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>Among the rocks about Stockholm, there is &s;ome|times &s;een a tract of land, which, at other times, di&s;ap|pears, and is &s;een again in another place.

Whether it may be in|tended the Dragon that is in the &s;ea, mentioned I&s;aiah xxvii. 1. we refer to the conjecture of the reader. After paying but a ju&s;t re&s;pect to the moral character, the reve|rend function, and deligent inve&s;tigations of our au|thor, we mu&s;t admit the po&s;&s;ibility of its exi&s;tence, as it Implies no contradiction; though it &s;eems to encounter a general prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Whale's being the large&s;t ani|mal on, or in, our globe; and the eradication of any long prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is attended with &s;omething irk&s;ome to us.

to equal latitudes in the South; the &s;mall number propagated by the Whale, who is viviparous; and by the large&s;t land animals, of whom the Elephant is &s;aid to go near two years with young; all induce us to conclude, from analogy, that this creature is not numerous; which coincides with a pa&s;&s;age in a manu&s;cript, a&s;cribed to Svere, King of Norway, as it is cited by Ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Wormius, in his Mu&s;eum, p. 280, in Latin, which we &s;hall exactly tran&s;|late, <Q>There remains one kind, which they call Haf|gu&s;e, who&s;e magnitude is unknown, as it is &s;eldom &s;een.

<P N="66">(66) Pliny has mentioned an extraordinary effect of oil, in &s;tilling the &s;urface of the water, when it is agitated with waves; and the u&s;e made of it, by the Divers, for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin was led, by an accidental ob&s;ervation made at &s;ea, in 1757, to attend particularly to Pliny's account; and the various information which he afterwards received relating to it, induced him to try &s;ome experiments on the &s;ubject. Standing on the windward &s;ide of a large pond, the &s;urface of which was rendered very rough with the wind, he poured a tea-&s;poonful of oil on the water. This &s;mall quantity produced an in&s;tant calm over a &s;pace of &s;e|veral yards &s;quare, which &s;pread amazingly, and extended it&s;elf gradually, till it reached the Ice-&s;ide, making all that quarter of the pond, perhaps half an acre, as &s;mooth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> looking-gla&s;s, On rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ing this experiment, which con&s;tantly &s;ucceeded, one circum&s;tance &s;truck him with particular &s;urprize; this was the &s;udden, wide, and forci|bly

&s;preading of a drop of oil on the face of the water, which, he adds, "I do not know that any body has con|&s;idered."</P>
<P>When a drop of oil is put on a looking-gla&s;s, or poli&s;hed marble, it &s;preads very little; but on water it in&s;tantly ex|pands into a circle, extending &s;everal feet in diameter, be|coming &s;o thin as to produce the pri&s;matic colours, for a con&s;iderable &s;pace, and beyond them &s;o much thinner as to be invi&s;ible, except in its effects of &s;moothing the waves at a much greater di&s;tance. <Q>It &s;eems &s;ays Dr. Frahklin, as if a mutual repul&s;ion between its particles took place as &s;oon as it touched the water, and a repul&s;ion &s;o &s;trong as to act on other bodies, &s;wimming on the &s;urface, as &s;traws, leaves, &amp;c. forcing them to recede every way from the drop, as from a centre, leaving a large clear &s;pace.</Q> The quantity of this force, and the di&s;tance to which it will operate, the author &s;ays, he has not yet a&s;certained; but he thinks it a curious enquiry, and wi&s;h|es to under&s;tand whence it ari&s;es.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, there is great room to &s;uppo&s;e, (not|with&s;tanding the partial failure of an experiment made at Port&s;mouth, by Dr. Franklin, and others) that &s;eafaring people may derive advantages from u&s;ing oil, on particu|lar occa&s;ions, in order to moderate the violence of the waves, or to le&s;&s;en the &s;urf, which &s;ometimes renders the landing on a lee-&s;hore dangerous or impracticable.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e we are informed, that the captain of a Dutch Ea&s;t-India &s;hip, being overtaken by a &s;torm, found him&s;elf obliged, for greater &s;afety in wearing the &s;hip, to pour oil into the &s;ea, to prevent the waves breaking over her, which had an excellent effect, and &s;ucceeded in pre|&s;erving her.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Cyclopoedia.</HI></BIBL></P>
<P N="67">(67) Spider, a genus of the optera order of in&s;ects. The characters of which are, that they have eight feet and eight eyes; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he mouth is furni&s;hed with two claws; the two palpi are articulated; and the anus is provided with papillae, or nipples, for weaving.

<P>Of the Spider, we have a great number of &s;pecies com|mon among us, which all agree in the general marks and characters.</P>
<P>They all have weapons i&s;&s;uing out of the mouth; but the&s;e are of two kinds, according to the two principal di&s;|tinctions of the Spiders. They con&s;i&s;t, in &s;ome, of two &s;picula, in the manner of a forked hook; this is their &s;truc|ture
<PB N="237" REF="020385_0236_0FAF09E3E301C2F0">
in all the kinds which have eight eyes. In others they are compo&s;ed of two forcipated arms, or are divided into two claws, in the manner of the legs of a crab; the&s;e are the weapons of all tho&s;e Spiders which have only two eyes.</P>
<P>The belly of the Spider is remarkably divided from the head and &s;houlders, &s;o as to adhere only by a thread: this is the ca&s;e in all except the two-eyed kinds; and in the different &s;pecies the body is variou&s;ly painted.</P>
<P>Spiders frequently ca&s;t their &s;kins, which may be found in the webs, perfectly dry and tran&s;parent; and from &s;uch &s;kins the forceps, or claws, for they are always &s;hed with the &s;kins, may ea&s;ier be &s;eparated, and examined with much greater exactne&s;s, than in the common Spider, while living.</P>
<P>The Spider's manner of weaving its web is very wonder|ful. The creature has five little teats, or nipples, near the extremity of the tail: from the&s;e there proceeds a gummy liquor, which adheres to every thing it is pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t; and being drawn out, hardens in&s;tantly in the air, and be|comes a &s;tring or thread &s;trong enough to bear five or &s;ix times the weight of the Spider's body. This thread is com|po&s;ed of &s;everal finer ones, which are drawn out &s;eparate|ly, but unite together at two or three hair-breadths di&s;tance from the creature's body. The&s;e threads are finer or coar|&s;er, according to the bigne&s;s of the Spider that &s;pins them. Mr. Leuwenhoeck has computed, that a hundred of the &s;ingle threads of a full-grown Spider, are not equal to the diameter of the hair of his beard; and, con&s;equently, if the threads and hair be both round, ten thou&s;and &s;uch threads are not bigger than &s;uch a hair. He calculates farther, that when young Spiders fir&s;t begin to &s;pin, four hundred of them are not larger than one which is of a full growth; allowing which, four millions of a young Spider's threads are not &s;o big as the &s;ingle hair of a man's beard.&mdash;<BIBL><HI>Cyclopaedia.</HI></BIBL></P>
<P N="68">(68) Polype, or Polypus, a fre&s;h water in&s;ect, belonging to the genus of HYDRA, in the cla&s;s of <HI>worms,</HI> and order of <HI>Zoophytes,</HI> in the Linnaean Sy&s;tem; which, when cut into a number of &s;eperate pieces, becomes, in a day or two, &s;o many di&s;tinct and &s;eparate animals; each piece having the &s;urpri&s;ing property of producing a head and tail, and the other organs nece&s;&s;ary for life, and all the animal functions.</P>

<P>If the method of this little animal's producing its young be very amazing, its reproduction of the &s;everal parts, when cut off, is much more &s;o.

<P>A thou&s;and other trials, by cutting the animal in differ|ent manners, fir&s;t by M. Trembley, and afterwards, at his reque&s;t, by M.

Mr. Sherwood has, very lately, di&s;covered the &s;mall eels in &s;our pa&s;te, to be each, without exception, full of living young ones.
