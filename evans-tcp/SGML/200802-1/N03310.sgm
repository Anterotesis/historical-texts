<Q>&mdash;<HI>I gave to my Brother</HI> Hanani, <HI>and</HI> Hananiah <HI>the Ruler of the Palace, charge over</HI> Jeru&s;alem: <HI>for he was a faithful Man, &amp; &s;eared God above many.</HI></Q>

<P>_AN excellent Pattern and Example this, (of <HI>Nehe|miah</HI> the princely Gover|nour of <HI>Judah</HI>) for the Imitation of &s;uch as are in Places of &s;uperiour, magi&s;tratical Rule and Power; and worthy to be copied, by all Kings and Princes of the World, and all that in &s;ubordi|nation to them, have the Rule and Government over any People, if they

mean their Welfare and Happine&s;s, or would them|&s;elves &s;it ea&s;y in the Places a&s;&s;ign'd unto them; for that the&s;e excellent Qualities here mention'd are equally &s;erviceable to the Governours of the World them&s;elves, and to all &s;uch as are &s;ubject to their Rule and Authority.</P>
<P>The Words read give us an Account of the ap|pointment of &s;ome to a Place of very con&s;iderable Weight and Tru&s;t, by <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> commi&s;&s;ioned Go|vernour over the returned Captives of <HI>Judah,</HI> by <HI>Artaxerxes</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> which Po&s;t he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olli|cited for, from a Zeal to the Church and People of God; for being of the Stock of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> he &s;ought the Intere&s;t and Welfare of his own People with all his Heart.</P>
<P>He had heard while he remained in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in the execution of an Office of great Dignity in that Court, (being Cup-bearer to the King) by his Bro|ther <HI>Hanani,</HI> mentioned 1 Chap. 2. <HI>v</HI> and one of the&s;e Per&s;ons named in the Text; I &s;ay by him he had heard, That, tho' being return'd to their own Land, they had built the Temple in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> accor|ding to the Royal Mandates of both <HI>Cyrus &amp; D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rius</HI> yet that the Holy City lay &s;till in its Ruins, and the Temple unguarded, and the People therefore in&s;ulted by their envious and inho&s;pitable Adver|&s;aries, who inhabited round about them: He there|fore immediately upon his entring the Govern|ment, &s;ets about the great Work for which he was &s;ent, namely, to rebuild the great City and fortify it, to &s;et up the Gates, the Barrs, and the Locks thereof; that they might, without let or impedi|ment, keep the divine Law, and be &s;ecure in the Wor&s;hip of the Temple of God; that he might re|form
<PB N="3" REF="004026_0006_1003BE3CD8B63F88">
the great Abu&s;es of the Sabbath they had been guilty of, in Buying and Selling on that Holy Day. And in this he was oblig'd to be very re&s;olute and &s;evere, having the Nobles of <HI>Judah</HI> to contend with in the Affair, 13 Chap. 15. and onward: For this excellent Man well con&s;ider'd, That the up|holding the public Wor&s;hip of God in its Purity, and according to the Law, and making a Reform of Vice and Immorality in the Capital of the Coun|try, would have a mighty Influence upon all the People, who all of them a&s;cended there, &s;everal Times in a Year, to attend the Temple Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>In this Regard the Charge over <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which he is &s;aid to conferr upon the&s;e Per&s;ons mention'd in the Text, was a very great Tru&s;t, and if well di&s;|charged, would have an happy Influence over the whole Land.</P>
<P>This great Tru&s;t he commits to <HI>to Hanani his Brother, &amp; to Hananiah,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed here by the Po&s;t he already held under him, and &s;tiled <HI>the Ruler of the Palace.</HI> The Place of his Re&s;idence being ju&s;tly &s;tiled &s;o, for that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pool in Loc.</NOTE> he lived like a royal Governour in great Splendor and Magnificence.</P>
<P>Upon the Expiration of his Commi&s;&s;ion, which was to continue but for a &s;et Time, 2 Chap. 6. <HI>v.</HI> he prepares to return to give an Account to his Ma&s;ter of what he had done; and finds it nece&s;&s;ary to appoint Governours over the City, which he had come on purpo&s;e to rebuild, fortify and re|form.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004026_0007_1003BE409CFA8C70">
This Charge, I &s;ay, he commits to the&s;e two Per&s;ons mention'd in our Text, and gives a very good Rea&s;on for it, <HI>For he was a faithful Man, and feared God above many. HE was,</HI> This <HI>Pronoun</HI> hath doubtle&s;s a <HI>Logical Reference</HI> to both the Per&s;ons here mention'd; but as it is &s;ingular, &s;o can have a <HI>Grammatical Reference</HI> only to one of them, and this 'tis mo&s;t likely was <HI>Hanani</HI> his Brother; becau&s;e <HI>Hananiah</HI> the other, was before, one of his &s;uperior Officers, a &s;ort of <HI>Steward of the Hou&s;hold.</HI> Whereby he had doubtle&s;s had large Experience of his Faith|fulne&s;s and Integrity, and therefore could depend upon him in that Tru&s;t, he now commits to him; be&s;ides as he was a public Officer he mu&s;t have ap|proved him&s;elf to others, and &s;o had an e&s;tabli&s;hed Character in the City, and therefore there was no need to give a Rea&s;on, why he gives to &s;uch a Man as he&punc; this important Charge: But &s;ince <HI>Hanani</HI> the other, was his Brother, Kin&s;man or Relative, it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould give a good Rea&s;on why he committed &s;o great a Tru&s;t to him; le&s;t he &s;hould incurr a Su&s;picion of Partiality to him, on account of his Relation, and therefore he &s;ays, <HI>He was a faithful Man, and feared God above many.</HI></P>
<P>Whence I make this incidental Note, <HI>That when tho&s;e who are in &s;uperiour Place of Power commit any Po&s;t of con&s;iderable Tru&s;t, to &s;uch as are related to them, it is expedient</HI> (with re&s;pect to the Reputation of their own Ju&s;tice and Impartiality) <HI>that &s;uch &s;hould have tho&s;e Qualities that remarkably fit them for that Station.</HI></P>
<P>This Character then, as I &s;aid before, mu&s;t have a <HI>Logical</HI> or <HI>Rational</HI> Reference to both the&s;e Per|&s;ons mention'd, and they were both of them <HI>faith|ful Men that feared God above many.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004026_0008_10039D3B8738D8B0">
The Word here tran&s;lated <HI>Faithful</HI> comes from a <HI>Root</HI> that &s;ignfies to <HI>Nouri&s;h</HI> or <HI>Nur&s;e up,</HI> and is mo&s;t commonly tran&s;lated as in our Text, from the Faith and Tru&s;t that is put in tho&s;e, who have the Care and Charge of an helple&s;s Babe, who cannot &s;upport and defend it &s;elf, nor to any ef|fect complain, of the wrong done unto it; who therefore &s;hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d always be &s;uch as are true, Faith|ful and Steady to their Charge; and &s;uch he com|mitted the Tru&s;t of this City, who were Men of Integrity and Steadine&s;s, as the Word is al&s;o u&s;ed, Exod. 17. 12. were it is &s;aid that <HI>Mo&s;es's Hand were &s;teady:</HI> When therefore this is given as a Charac|ter of the Mind, it denotes a Man that is not variable, a Man not ea&s;ily turn'd from his Purpo&s;e; but of this I &s;hall &s;ay more under the Doctrine.</P>
<P>And as they were Men of Integrity, &s;o they were Men of true Religion, <HI>for they feared God above many.</HI> Religion the whole of it, is frequently expre&s;s'd in the Scripture by &s;ome one particular Grace or Act of Religion, &s;ometimes by <HI>Faith in God,</HI> &s;ometimes by the <HI>Love of God,</HI> &s;o here it is expre&s;s'd by the <HI>Fear of God;</HI> and here the Character given is, <HI>That he feared God above many, </HI> that is, that they (for I have &s;aid the Character belongs to both) not only made a Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and lived in a ge|neral Practice of tho&s;e good Morals required there|by, but from a full and thorough Knowledge of them; he look'd upon them as Men of true inter|nal Religion and vital Piety: From the Words then, as I have thus con&s;ider'd them, I propo&s;e for our Con&s;ideration this Ob&s;ervation as appo&s;ite to the Occa&s;ion of this Day.</P>
<P><HI>That tho&s;e who&s;e Province it is, to de&s;ign others, to Stations of publick Tru&s;t, &s;hould have a principal Regard to their Integrity and Religion.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004026_0009_1003BE4C63E80828">
There are it is true, other Qualities nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch as are inve&s;ted with a public Character, as I &s;hall &s;ay hereafter, but none that we ought to have &s;uch a Regard to, as the&s;e; and therefore I call the&s;e the principal.</P>
<P>And tho' in the choice of this Subject, I vary from many of my Fathers and &s;uperior Brethren, who (before me) have &s;tood in this Desk upon the like Occa&s;ion, in that they have cho&s;en to di&s;cour&s;e of the Apo&s;tacy of this People of God, and drop their Tears over their Immoralities, while they ur|ged all Orders of Men, both Civil and Sacred, to endeavour a Reformation of Manners, rather than to in&s;i&s;t upon any Subject, that had a direct A&s;pect on the Affairs of the Day, and the Duty of the E|lectors to have a peculiar Regard to the Qualities of &s;uch, as are this Day to be con&s;tituted one Branch of the Legi&s;lature. Yet the Rea&s;on (I know) has been, very much, becau&s;e they look'd upon it as an Impropriety, and altogether in vain, to &s;peak of nece&s;&s;ary Qualities, when the Per&s;ons them&s;elves are already fix'd upon, and (in Effect) cho&s;en before this; and that perhaps without any Regard to their Qualities, only that they are &s;uch as will be &s;ure to an&s;wer that Party-Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t they are de|&s;igned for.</P>
<P>When then, thus re&s;olved, they come to hear the Arguments and Exhortations of the Hou&s;e of God, and here pretend to addre&s;s Heaven for their Di|rection in, and a Ble&s;&s;ing upon, their Elections, that they may be proceeded in, with Love and Peace, with Freedom and Uprightne&s;s; which I take for granted to be the original De&s;ign of the&s;e Solem|nities; I &s;ay when they come, thus re&s;olved to car|ry their Point, what&s;oever Animo&s;ities, Heats and Contentions they kindle thereby.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004026_0010_1003BE50F60AEE30">
Or when they neglect the divine Wor&s;hip this Day, in order to attend &s;ome &s;elect <HI>Juncto,</HI> where (without a Tho't of God) they concert the whole Affair; it is no other than a bold Praevarication with God, and &s;uch an impious Collu&s;ion, as gives us a melancholy Pro&s;pect, and bids us fear that God will <HI>take away Wi&s;dom from the wi&s;e, Under&s;tanding from the aged, and lead Coun&s;ellors away &s;poiled.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' we pretend not to In&s;piration, yet we may very well apply to &s;uch, that of the Prophet Jeremy, 42 Chap. 20. ver&s;e, <HI>Ye di&s;&s;embled in your Hearts, when ye &s;ent me to the Lord your God, &s;aying pray for us unto the Lord our God and according to all that the Lord our God &s;hall &s;ay, &s;o declare unto us and we will do it.</HI></P>
<P>If then I am not &s;o &s;anguine as to imagine to per|&s;wade &s;uch, as by the&s;e Practices do in Fact declare as they did, 44 Jer. 16, 17. <HI>As for the Word which thou ha&s;t &s;poken unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee; but we will certainly do what&s;o|ever goeth out of our own Mouth.</HI> Yet &s;urely all are not of this Character; &s;ome I know there are that fear God, and greatly Reverence his Word, and will therefore always think, <HI>Tho&s;e Qualities be&s;t fit a Man for a public Station, which that Word of God plainly di|rects to:</HI> And as they have asked the divine Direc|tion this Day, &s;o will act in the Uprightne&s;s of their Hearts: But if not, yet that of God to his Prophet is my Warrant, and &s;hall be my Direction to go on, 3 Ezek. 11. <HI>Go get thee unto thy People and &s;peak unto them, and tell them, Thus &s;aith the Lord, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</HI> And thus I pro|ceed to the Con&s;ideration of the Ob&s;ervation I have already noted from the Words, <HI>That tho&s;e who&s;e Province it is to de&s;ign others to Stations of publick
<PB N="8" REF="004026_0011_10039D73D8EC2080">
Tru&s;t, &s;hould have a principal Regard to their Integrity and Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Herein are plainly contained the&s;e Propo&s;itions,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Prop. That it is the Province of &s;ome to de&s;ign others to Stations of public Tru&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Prop. That in this De&s;ignation, they &s;hould have a principal Regard to their Integrity and Re|ligion.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. Prop. <HI>That it is the Province of &s;ome to de&s;ign o|thers to Stations of public Tru&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>This Propo&s;ition naturally offers it&s;elf to us in the&s;e two Parts,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A public Station is a place of Tru&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It is the Province of &s;ome to De&s;ign others to the&s;e Stations.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;peak to the&s;e Heads and &s;o to this Pro|po&s;ition in but brief and general Manner.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A public Station is a place of Tru&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And how great is that Tru&s;t! It is true, This Tru&s;t is greater or le&s;s, according to the Degree of the Importance of their &s;everal Stations; but all that is dear to a People, is in general Intru&s;ted with tho&s;e who are in public Stations.</P>
<P>Our Lives and our Intere&s;t our civil Privileges and Immunities, and our Religion too, are all in|tru&s;ted in their Hands; &s;ome <HI>one</HI> or <HI>other</HI> of the&s;e, every Man in a public Station, is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure intru&s;ted with, whether he be in a civil or military Po&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004026_0012_1003BE53B6012A30">
The military Officer hath (e&s;pecially in the Time of War) the Care of our Lives and Intere&s;t too.</P>
<P>By his diligent Watch and Guard it is, that God &s;ometimes draws a Line of Protection round about us, and the Land of unwalled Villages is &s;afe from Fear.</P>
<P>By his Conduct and Bravery it is, that God &s;ome|times gives Conque&s;t and Victory to his People, when they <HI>are of good Courage, and play the Men, for the Cities of their God.</HI></P>
<P>Again, He that in civil Regards is in a public Station, and that con&s;ider'd either as legi&s;lative or executive, hath the Care of our mo&s;t valuable In|tere&s;ts, committed to his Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>The peaceable and quiet Enjoyment of our In|tere&s;t, is intru&s;ted with tho&s;e who are in executive Place of Power: Our civil Peace is put directly in|to their Charge, and much of our Religion is un|der their Guard and Protection.</P>
<P>To them is committed the Di&s;pen&s;ation of that di&s;tributive Ju&s;tice, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the Happi|ne&s;s of any People: and with them it lies to puni&s;h the Breaches, that are from Time to Time made upon that commutative Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to their Trade and Commerce.</P>
<P>Again, Such as are, in a legi&s;lative Con&s;ideration, in a public Station, have an high Tru&s;t committed to them; even our civil Liberties and Privileges, and the Cau&s;e of Religion too. It is the&s;e that prepare the civil Sword which is put into the Hands of the executive Officer, and give it Keenne&s;s and Terror, by the &s;evere Sanctions of tho&s;e whole&s;ome Laws, which from Time to Time are enacted again&s;t Vice and Immorality.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004026_0013_1003BE596F7ED040">
The&s;e have it greatly in their Power to encou|rage Religion and Vertue;</P>
<P>By placing &s;trong Guards about all our religious Enjoyments;</P>
<P>By enacting &s;uch Laws whereby the Wor&s;hip of God may be promoted, and his holy Sabbaths more &s;trictly ob&s;erved; which alas! are highly neglected, tho' the careful Ob&s;ervation of them are found to be the be&s;t Means of &s;ecuring the Religion of a People.</P>
<P>By &s;trengthning the Hands and encouraging the Hearts of &s;uch as are properly the <HI>Mini&s;ters of Re|ligion.</HI></P>
<P>With the&s;e it lies to take Care of the Means of Education; without which we &s;hall &s;oon become an ignorant and a barbarous People</P>
<P>To make our Schools of Learning more effec|tually an&s;wer the Ends of their In&s;titution.</P>
<P>To take Care of our College, that Seminary of Literature and Religion, the early founding of which was one of the greate&s;t Glories of our Fa|thers, and a Proof both of their great Wi&s;dom and Religion.</P>
<P>Again, To the&s;e is committed the Care &amp; Tru&s;t of our valuable, civil Liberties and Privileges; and it is by their loyal and dutiful Behaviour that they are yet continued to us, as it is certainly in their Power, by a froward and unea&s;y Carriage, by Stubborne&s;s and Contumacy, to betray them all; and intirely defeat all the Good that was ever de|&s;ign'd us, by the Royal Indulgence in the valuable Charter, which we (by the Favour of God) yet en|joy. Thus have all tho&s;e who have any Share in the Legi&s;lature, a great Tru&s;t committed to them.</P>
<P>But then,</P>
<P>Our <HI>Commander in Chief</HI> hath all the&s;e valuable Intere&s;ts of the People, committed to his Tru&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004026_0014_1003BE60AEF37860">
As they lie divided among the &s;everal Officers in public Station, either in the military Order, or in the civil Power, either Legi&s;lative or Executive; &s;o is the Tru&s;t of them all united in him.</P>
<P>The Lives and the Intere&s;t, the civil Liberties and Privileges, and the religious Concerns of this whole People, are all under his Care; and it greatly lies with him, as to advance, a&s;&s;i&s;t and encourage them all; &s;o to di&s;hearten and di&s;courage the At|tempts and Endeavours of the mo&s;t zealous Patriot, for the promoting and &s;trengthning the&s;e Intere&s;ts of a People.</P>
<P>Thus I have briefly con&s;ider'd the great Tru&s;t that is committed to &s;uch as are in a public Po&s;t and Station: This is the Matter of Fact.</P>
<P>But then,</P>

<P>I an&s;wer, <HI>He who&s;e Kingdom ruleth over all.</HI> 8 Prov. 15, 16. <HI>By me Kings Reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice, by me Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>And as God hath done this &s;ometimes by a pe|culiar De&s;ignation to &s;uch Station, by the Mouth of &s;ome in&s;pired Per&s;on, as in the Ca&s;es of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> and &s;ome of the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> So is this generally in a providential Way and Manner.</P>
<P>For as Rule and Government is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary in the World, and the Peace, Welfare and Hap|pine&s;s of a People depend upon it; &s;o is it nece&s;|&s;ary to the &s;ecuring Religion and the Glory and Honour of God, and hence he claims it as his Pre|rogative, to appoint over the Children of Men, whom&s;oever he will.</P>

And therefore what Tru&s;t is committed to &s;uch, is committed to them by God; they Govern and Rule for him, and he will expect an Account, and that a &s;evere one, from all Kings, Princes and Go|vernours of the World, from all who have had the&s;e Tru&s;ts in any Regard, committed to them, how they have an&s;wered that Tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Every Kind of Power then and Manner of Rule (as they are very various) is of God; and therefore the Apo&s;tle tells us in that 13 Rom. beg. <HI>There is no Power but of God, the Powers that be, are ordained of God. Who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth the Power, re&s;i&s;teth the Ordinance of God; and they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves Damnation.</HI> Whereby a dutiful and loyal Behaviour towards &s;uch as are in Power, is &s;ecured, from a Con&s;ideration of the Ordination and Ap|pointment of God him&s;elf, by who&s;e Authority they act. And therefore (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>Let every Soul be &s;ubject to the higher Powers.</HI></P>

<P>All Forms of Government originate from the People; that is, God in his Providence hath in|fluenced them; &s;ome to fix upon one Form of Go|vernment, and &s;ome upon another.</P>
<P>While &s;ome re&s;erve the greate&s;t Part of the Power to them&s;elves, others inve&s;t &s;ome of the Nobles and great Families among them with that Tru&s;t; while others chu&s;e to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to a Monarch, and delight in one &s;upream Magi&s;trate or Head over all the E&s;tates of the Realm.</P>

<P>And here it is, as in the Body Natural, &s;ome Members are more honourable &amp; &s;ome are le&s;s &s;o: For as the Offices to be executed among a People are many &amp; various, &s;o is it nece&s;&s;ary, there &s;hould be various Orders and Degrees of Men, &s;uperior and inferiour; and it is the Province of tho&s;e who are in &s;uperior Station, to appoint to Office, &s;uch as are Inferiour, &amp; to act in &s;ubordination to them.</P>
<P>So is it the Province of the King as &s;upream, or becau&s;e he is the &s;upream Magi&s;trate, to appoint others to Office; and this is done in a various Man|ner, either mediately by the Power, with which he hath before inve&s;ted tho&s;e, who are near him and round about his Throne, or immediately and in a direct Manner; &s;o he delegates his Power and Au|thority to the Governours who are &s;ent by him, and &s;et over any People, to repre&s;ent among them his Per&s;on, and to execute in his &s;tead, a great Part of the regal Power: To whom, when they are thus con&s;tituted by him, it belongs to de&s;ign others to Places of Tru&s;t under them.</P>

<P>Here I &s;hall &s;peak of this Quality, not ethically, or as a moral Vertue; becau&s;e I mu&s;t pre&s;ently &s;peak of it, as a Part of the Character of a Man of Reli|gion,

by which all tho&s;e Qualities that are deno|minated by ethical Writers moral Virtues are in|tirely ab&s;orp'd and di&s;appear, as the feeble Light of the Stars, when the Sun ari&s;eth &s;hining in his Strength.</P>
<P>So the dim <HI>Light of Nature</HI> is of little u&s;e to guide us in our Way, when we have the more glorious Beams of the <HI>Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> &s;hining upon our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ath.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall con&s;ider this as a natural Quality: Natural, I mean, in Contradiction not to moral but acquired.</P>
<P>For as Men by their Regard to the Duties of the Religion of our Lord and Saviour, which they profe&s;s, may attain to a great Degree of this En|dowment; &s;o the Di&s;po&s;ition thereto in &s;ome Men, may be &s;uch, that it may be con&s;ider'd as Natural.</P>
<P>By Integrity then I under&s;tand, <HI>That natural Turn of the Mind, which di&s;po&s;es a Man to act &s;teadily and uniformly in all his Conduct, with an hone&s;t Regard to the various Intere&s;ts that are intru&s;ted with him, whether Public or Private.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, as our Nature is corrupt, and intirely deprav'd with Sin by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">all, &s;o <HI>there dwells in us no good Thing;</HI> and there are in us the <HI>Stamina</HI> or Elements of all Sin: But yet there is nothing more evident, than that we are not alike inclin'd to all, but more to &s;ome Sins than others; &s;o are &s;ome Men much le&s;s inclin'd to any Breach upon Truth and Uprightne&s;s, than others</P>
<P>And whether we can give a proper Rea&s;on for this, that &s;hall &s;atisfy us Philo&s;ophically, or not, yet the Fact is evident.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004026_0020_1003BE7777E26580">
And it appears very much to be natural, both, becau&s;e we find this continu'd frequently from Fa|ther to Son. And his Father's Steadine&s;s and In|tegrity, or his In&s;incerity and Turn to Cunning and De&s;ign, is plainly vi&s;ible in the Son that comes after him: And for that, we frequently &s;ee Men remarkable for this Quality, that not only have no Religion, but that &s;carce pretend to any; yet are they &s;uch as from this natural Ca&s;t, we are very ready to tru&s;t and confide in.</P>
<P>This then is a Turn of Mind that is very &s;er|viceable in the World, and of it&s;elf recommends a Man greatly to our Liking and E&s;teem: For tho' this Quality will never &s;erve a Man in &s;piritual Regards, &s;aving, that &s;uch an one is nearer the Kingdom of God than another; yet has it often done excellent Service in the &s;ecular Affairs of the World, and in the civil Societies and Communi|ties of Men: Thus I &s;hall clo&s;e this Head, <HI>What we are here to under&s;tand by Integrity.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>II. <HI>What we are to under&s;tand by Religion.</HI></P>
<P>According to the Expre&s;&s;ion of our Text then, we are lead to &s;ay in general, That the Man of Re|ligion is one that <HI>Fears God and keeps his Command|ments.</HI></P>
<P>As here is doubtle&s;s to be under&s;tood, one that makes a Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and explicitly de|clares his Re&s;olution, for the Service, Honour &amp; Glory of his God, &s;o hereby is not to be under&s;tood the ex|ternal Profe&s;&s;or only, however exact &amp; formal he may

be in this Re&s;pect; but the Man of true vital Religion; the Man who hath the Intere&s;t of Reli|gion at his Heart, as well as upon his Tongue:</P>
<P>The Man that acts from a Principle of divine Grace in the Soul: He who is influenc'd in all his Actions by the Views of another World; who <HI>lives his Life in the World, by the Faith of the Son of God:</HI></P>
<P>Such an one as is not influenc'd in his Duty to God, (I mean in the external Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion) nor in that to his private Nei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bour, his Country or his People, by any little &amp; &s;ini&s;ter Views of worldly Honour or Advantage: But can wait for the pro|mis'd Reward of all his &s;incere, tho' imperfect Actions, till after Death:</P>
<P>Who infinitely prefers his Acceptance with God, and the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Euge</HI> he Hopes for, from the great Judge of all; to all the vain popular Applau&s;e, that can be given by Man:</P>
<P>In a Word, He that makes the Word of God his Rule, by which he acts &s;teadily and uniformly, ac|cording to the Dictates of a pure and upright Con|&s;cience:</P>
<P>This is the Man of Religion, who&s;e Motives, Ends and De&s;igns, in all his Actions, both in public and private Life, are great and noble, right &amp; true.</P>
<P>I proceed,</P>
<P>III. To prove the Propo&s;ition, <HI>That Integrity and Religion &s;hould be principally Regarded by tho&s;e that de|&s;ign others to Places of public Tru&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>And here, The Manner of the Expre&s;&s;ion of this Propo&s;ition implies, That there are other Qualities

requi&s;ite to the proper Execution of &s;uch Tru&s;ts, in relation to which, the&s;e are the principal.</P>
<P>And it is very true, There are other Qualities nece&s;&s;ary, be&s;ides Hone&s;ty and Religion; &s;uch as a good Under&s;tanding, Knowledge and Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>For it is not every hone&s;t and religious Man, hath a Pretence to any one, much le&s;s to all of the&s;e.</P>
<P>And to have &s;uch in Places of public Concern, who are weak &amp; low in their natural or acquired Accompli&s;hments, tends to render the Government ba&s;e and contemptible.</P>
<P>Such then as are in public Stations, ought to be Men of a good Under&s;tanding, Knowledge and Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They &s;hould be Men of a good Under&s;tanding.</HI></P>
<P>Men of good intellectual Powers, that have a Capacity, when they apply them&s;elves to Bu&s;ine&s;s, to under&s;tand the Duties of their Station; that &s;o their Weakne&s;s may not be a Snare to them, while they are lead blindfold by others, and made the Tools of a Party, and become the Property of Men of Trick and De&s;ign.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such as are in public Stations &s;hould be Men of Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>That is &s;uch Knowledge as is proper to the Sta|tions which they &s;u&s;tain: This therefore is various according to the Variety of public Stations in which Men are plac'd.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="004026_0023_10039D6A66056DD0">
Such then as are in &s;uperior public Stations, &s;hould be &s;uch as were the Men of <HI>I&s;&s;achar</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 32.</NOTE>, <HI>Men: that had Under&s;tanding of the Times to know what I&s;rael ought to do.</HI></P>
<P>Such ought therefore to be Men of political Know|ledge; knowing and under&s;tanding in the Laws of their People; and well acquainted with the Con|&s;titution and Intere&s;ts of that civil Polity and Go|vernment, in which they act their Part.</P>
<P>And as the former Head re&s;pects the Faculty, &s;o this doth the Application of that Faculty: And there are many Men of good natural intellectual Powers, who from the Narrowne&s;s of their Cir|cum&s;tances, and the nece&s;&s;ary Diligence in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Callings, have no Time to &s;pend in procuring that Knowledge, whereby they would otherwi&s;e be very fit for public Offices &amp; Stations, according to that of the Son of <HI>Sirach</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ecclus. 38. 24, 25, 33.</NOTE>, <HI>The Wi&s;|dom of a learned Man cometh by Opportunity of Lei&s;ure, and he that hath little Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hall become wi&s;e: But how can he get Wi&s;dom that holdeth the Plough, and that glorieth in the Good, that driveth Oxen and is occupied in their Labours, and who&s;e Talk is of Bullocks. They &s;hall not be &s;ought for in public Coun&s;el, nor &s;it high in the Congregation, they &s;hall not &s;it on the Judges Seat, nor under&s;tand the Sentence of Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Again, Some thro' their Idlene&s;s and Indolence &s;uffer a good Under&s;tanding to lie barren and un|cultivated.</P>
<P>So that a good Under&s;tanding only, doth no way qualify a Man for &s;uch Stations, unle&s;s it be
<PB N="21" REF="004026_0024_1003BE86C07C3CB0">
inform'd and enlightned, with that In&s;truction and Knowledge, proper for the Station he is a&s;&s;ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d to.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Such as are in public Stations, &s;hould be Men of Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>This Head is very different from the former, for that, a Man may be endow'd with great Trea&s;ures of Knowledge, and yet be far from Wi&s;e &amp; Prudent.</P>
<P><HI>Knowledge</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great Number of Ideas, and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> in the proper Appli|cation of them, to our &s;everal Needs and Purpo&s;es in Life: So that, Knowledge doth by no Means certainly imply Wi&s;dom: And <HI>the greate&s;t Clerks are not always the wi&s;e&s;t Men.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, the Man of Knowledge will &s;hine in the beauties of Di&s;cour&s;e; and as mo&s;t Men are apt to judge &s;uperficially, &s;o will they be ready to imagine, that he that can &s;peak &s;o finely, mu&s;t al&s;o be a Man of equal Wi&s;dom: But it is very certain, That <HI>to Talk well and Act wi&s;ely, are very different Talents;</HI> and oftentimes, do not meet in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame Per&s;on (unle&s;s where the Genius is great and &s;u|perior); but frequently, the more remarkable he is for the <HI>one,</HI> the le&s;s &s;o is he for the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>Wi&s;dom and Prudence then are very nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch as are in public Stations; whereby they may under&s;tand how to lead and govern the va|rious Inclinations &amp; Tempers of Men, the various Parties they have to do with (for there will always be &s;uch) and the various Intere&s;ts which &s;uch Par|ties pur&s;ue; &s;o as to bring Good out of Evil, and advance, &s;ometimes, the Intere&s;t of the Public, by &s;uch as mean nothing le&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004026_0025_1003BE8A34E81CF8">
The&s;e Qualities, then, of Under&s;tanding, Know|ledge and Wi&s;dom, are all nece&s;&s;ary to Stations of public Tru&s;t; and yet, the&s;e are not mention'd in our Text: but, rather &s;uch are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ought for as are Men of Integrity and Religion.</P>
<P>And this for &s;everal Rea&s;ons; 1. <HI>Becau&s;e there is not &s;o much need of urging the choice of Men of natural Powers; for that the&s;e Qualities are what Men are ge|nerally apt to look fir&s;t at:</HI> Often imagining, that the Capacity of doing Service, and the Power and Ability to an&s;wer all the demands of the Place they &s;u&s;tain, con&s;titutes them fit and proper Per&s;ons for that Station. 2. <HI>Becau&s;e &s;uch is the Corruption of our Natures, that it is ea&s;ier to find tho&s;e that are fit for a public Station, as to their natural Powers, than &s;uch as are properly qualified by Morals.</HI> And then, Once more; <HI>Becau&s;e a moderate Degree of the&s;e natural Qualities, when they are well bala&s;ted with Integrity and Religion, is much more likely to procure the Welfare and Happine&s;s of a People, than the highe&s;t Degrees of the&s;e natural Powers, when they are without the Moral:</HI> And therefore are Integrity and Religion to be look'd upon as prin|cipal Qualities in tho&s;e, who are de&s;ign'd to any Places of public Tru&s;t. Which Things are &s;ome Proof of the Propo&s;ition. But I proceed to a more direct Proof of it in three Things.</P>
<P>1. <HI>The Examples we have in the Scriptures, of the Care which the good Kings and Governours over the Peo|ple of God have taken in this Regard, are our Directio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> herein.</HI></P>
<P>As we are to yield a &s;trict Obedience to the pro+per Precepts and Directions of the Word of God &s;o are the Examples which we have there record|ed, of holy Men, to have a great Weight with us
<PB N="23" REF="004026_0026_10039D720D29ACB8">
for as the Apo&s;tle tells us,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 15. 4.</NOTE> <HI>What&s;oever Things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning.</HI> And<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 10. 11.</NOTE> <HI>That all the&s;e Things hapned to them for En&s;amples, and are written for our Admonition.</HI></P>
<P>We find then, that tho&s;e that had the Character of good Rulers, have made this their Care, to put &s;uch in Places of Tru&s;t, as were Men of Religion, and a &s;trict Regard to the Law of God. Such is the Example of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who was a King in <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">urun:</HI> For when he &s;et Officers over the People, and gave them that Charge, 1 Deut. 1. 15, and onward, <HI>And I took the Chief of your Trives</HI>&mdash;<HI>and charged them at that Time, &s;aying, hear the Cau&s;es between your Brethren, and judge righteou&s;ly ye &s;hall not re&s;pect Per&s;ons, nor fear the Faces of Men, for the Judgment is God's.</HI> It is hence evident, That tho&s;e who had this Charge, were &s;uch as he e&s;teemed Men of Integrity, and a &s;trict Regard to that Law of God which he put under their Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>So when the good King <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> appointed his Officers to public Tru&s;t, he gave them that Charge, 2 Chron. 19. 6.&mdash;<HI>Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for Man, but for the Lord; wherefore let the Fear of the Lord be upon you.</HI> This being his Charge then, we cannot imagine, but that he took the greate&s;t Care to commit this Tru&s;t, to Men whom he could confide in, that they would an&s;wer the Charge &s;o given them: Even Men of Integrity and Religion.</P>
<P>And &s;uch is the Example we have in our Text of <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> the pious Governour of <HI>Judah,</HI> who regarded the Integrity and religious Fear of God, in the&s;e his Officers, before every other Qualifi|cation; e&s;teeming <HI>that</HI> a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on, why he gave them the Charge of the City of God.</P>

2. <HI>We are directed to this in the Word of God.</HI></P>

<P>When &s;uch as are thus intru&s;ted an&s;wer not to the Importance of their Tru&s;t, it is always a Re|flection upon their Con&s;tituents, and intimates a Deficiency of their Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>As the ultimate and general End of all the Ac|tions of Men, and &s;o of Government, ought to be the Glory of the divine Being, &s;o the next &amp; more immediate End, is the Happine&s;s of the People.</P>
<P>This then ought to be the next and immedi|ate Purpo&s;e of &s;uch as are in Place of &s;uperior Power, and have the Authority of de&s;igning others to Places of public Tru&s;t. And as it is a principal Part of Wi&s;dom to pur&s;ue any End which we pro|po&s;e to our &s;elves, in that Manner that &s;hall be&s;t and mo&s;t certainly attain it; &s;o it is certainly the mo&s;t egregious Folly, to defeat by any of our Ac|tions, that very End, which by &s;uch Actions we profe&s;s to endeavour after: And this (by the way) is the Rea&s;on, why all Sin is Folly.</P>
<P>Now it will doubtle&s;s be univer&s;ally allowed, that they that are in &s;uperior Places of Power, &s;uch as are to give Authority and Power to others, ought to act wi&s;ely: Which, if they de&s;ign the Intere&s;t and Welfare of a People, they do not, when they di&s;|po&s;e of the Offices of public Tru&s;t to &s;uch as are not Men of Integrity and Religion; becau&s;e &s;uch as have no claim to the&s;e Characters, will by no means an&s;wer the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, by &s;uch Con&s;titution and Appointment; for that &s;uch are evidently deficient in tho&s;e valuable Endowments,

which are always nece&s;&s;ary to the Weal and Pro&s;|perity of &s;uch as they govern.</P>

<P>I &s;hall therefore here con&s;ider &s;everal of tho&s;e truly noble Qualities, productive of the public Weal, which are the genuine Effect of Religion: And which therefore it binds a Man to act accor|ding to, what&s;oever public Character he is inve&s;ted with.</P>
<P>And they are &s;uch as the&s;e, 1. Integrity and Uprightne&s;s. 2. Courage &amp; Fortitude. 3. Large|ne&s;s of Heart productive of a public Spirit. 4. Ju&s;|tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s. 5. Liberality, in Oppo|&s;ition to Avarice or a &s;ordid View to a Man's own private Intere&s;t.</P>

<P>I before con&s;ider'd Integrity as it is a Di&s;po&s;ition of the Mind, which is more natural to &s;ome than others. I now con&s;ider it as it is a divine Vertue.</P>
<P>And &s;o,</P>
<P><HI>It is that Habit of the Soul, whereby a Man is always inclin'd to act agreably to his Con&s;cience with every Man.</HI> (For I here con&s;ider this Head, only as it has regard to our Actions toward Man) And &s;o will he that is a Man of Integrity, act in Truth and Sincerity with

<P>Such an one &s;peaks what he means, and his Words truly di&s;clo&s;e the Intent of his Heart: And he ho|ne&s;tly De&s;igns to act according to his Word, and always doth &s;o, unle&s;s unavoidably prevented.

<P>And this Virtue or Grace is the genuine Fruit and Effect of Religion, as it is analogous to one of the Perfections of God, who&s;e Image it is the End and De&s;ign of Religion, to re&s;tore to the Soul; and therefore it demands this Quality of us, accor|ding to one of the Precepts of that divine Law, which the religious Man profe&s;&s;es to be the Rule of his Life, and that he is under the highe&s;t Obli|gations to be obedient unto.</P>

<P>The Man of true Integrity acts always under a Sen&s;e of his Duty to God, for that he can never hope otherwi&s;e to dwell in his Pre&s;ence, according to that of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, 5. 12.

<P>So that he is one that may be depended upon, and Men put an intire Tru&s;t and Confidence in &s;uch a Man, which is an un&s;peakable Advantage in all the Affairs of Life.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Courage is a Quality nece&s;&s;ary to him who is in a Place of public Tru&s;t, which is the genuine Effect of Re|ligion.</HI></P>
<P>The Man of Religion is &s;uch an one as he in our Text, <HI>he fears God,</HI> and for that Rea&s;on he doth not fear Man: He is one of tho&s;e, who hath taken

that Advice of our Lord,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 12. 4, 5.</NOTE> <HI>Be not afraid of them that kill the Body, but fear him, who, after he hath killed, hath Power to ca&s;t both Body and Soul into Hell.</HI> The truly religious Man doth all his Actions as to God, that is, as in his Pre&s;ence, and for his Glory and Honour; and &s;uch an one is ready to &s;uffer in the Cau&s;e of God, or when his Con&s;cience tells him it is his Duty.</P>
<P>And thus Religion influences a fearle&s;s Beha|viour in all Stations of public Life.</P>
<P>This gives Life and Spirit to the Soldier, when <HI>Thou&s;ands fall at his Side, and ten Thou&s;and at his right Hand.</HI></P>

3. <HI>Largene&s;s of Heart is another of tho&s;e Qualities, which is the genuine Effect of Religion, and nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch are in public Stations.</HI></P>
<P>As it is the Tendency of Religion to dilate the Soul, &s;o it is the End and De&s;ign, the Beauty and Excellency of it, to relea&s;e the Mind from that nar|row, contracted State which Sin hath &s;hrunk it into.</P>
<P>True Religion dive&s;ts a Man of <HI>Self,</HI> and gives him a generous and extended Concern for all that are round about him. For this is a natural Effect of true Love to our Nei'bour, that is the di&s;tingui&s;h|ing Mark of genuine Chri&s;tianity: For that our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath given it as an infallible Token whereby all the World might know his Di&s;ciples,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 13. 35.</NOTE> <HI>Hereby &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye Love one another.</HI></P>
<P>This Love, as it is an active Principle, &s;o it doth not centre in it &s;elf. If Charity begins at Home, yet it does not end there: But the Man endowed with this Grace is always active in doing good to o|thers, when he hath an Opportunity: Yea He re|joices to &s;ee all that are round him, in Pro&s;perity; nor envies his Nei'bour, when he ri&s;es above him|&s;elf. He abhors tho&s;e Actions which we ju&s;tly call mean and little, as what are as truly forbidden by the Law of Chri&s;t, as any of tho&s;e Actions which we are more ready to &s;tile &s;inful &amp; immoral: For Actions that are little and mean, are a direct Con|tradiction to Chri&s;tianity; which more than any other Religion, more than any one Set of Princi|ples what&s;oever, tends to enlarge the Heart, and influence to great and excellent Actions: And it is
<PB N="32" REF="004026_0035_1003BEAC74B9ECC0">
certain that he that hath a narrow, &s;elfi&s;h and lit|tle Soul, can never be a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>When, then, the Man in public Station is a Man of Religion too, he will di&s;dain to act from any lit|tle and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er Views: They are no Temptation to him&punc; but he endeavours to an&s;wer the Duties of that Station, let the Event and I&s;&s;ue of &s;uch his Ac|tions be what it will.</P>
<P>And tho' his Honour, Repute and E&s;teem with Men be dear to him, yet when they come in Com|petition with the Honour of God, and the Peace of his own Con&s;cience, they appear to him, as indeed they are, Things of little Value.</P>
<P>And if by his acting in a generous, open and di&s;|intere&s;ted Manner, he plea&s;es neither Party, becau&s;e he has not forwarded according to their Hopes, their little and private De&s;igns; yet a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s that he has acted according to the Obligations of that Religion which he profe&s;&s;es, is &s;uch a Satis|faction to his Mind, that he is little affected with the Re&s;entments which &s;uch his true and generous Behaviour may have rai&s;ed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>This Magnanimity and Expan&s;ion of Heart, as it is nece&s;&s;ary to Men in public Station, &s;o is it the genuine Effect of true Religion; for hence it is that we &s;ometimes &s;ee the Man of mean Extraction, and of the cour&s;er Imployments of low Life, by true Religion attain to that greatne&s;s of Mind, that is often found wanting in &s;uch as are the Sons of Nobles, and have had the mo&s;t open and generous Education So nece&s;&s;arily does Religion enlarge the Soul; according to that of the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;al. 119 32 <HI>I will run the Way of thy Commandments when thou &s;halt enlarge my Heart.</HI></P>

4. <HI>Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s is another nece&s;&s;ary Qua|lification of the Man in public Station, which is the ge|nuine Fruit of Religion.</HI></P>
<P>This Quality, I &s;ay, is nece&s;&s;ary to him that is made, any way, a Ruler over Men; according to that, 2 Sam. 23. 3. <HI>He that ruleth over Men mu&s;t be ju&s;t.</HI> Hence <HI>Job</HI> &s;ays, when &s;peaking of him&s;elf in his judiciary Quality,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job 29. 14.</NOTE> <HI>I put on Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and it clothed me: my Judgment was as a Robe and a Diad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m.</HI> It cover'd him all over as a Garment; it was his Glory and Beauty, and gave a Lu&s;tre as the Jewels of a royal Diadem.</P>
<P>This is perpetually found where there is true Re|ligion, for it is always a Part of the Ba&s;is of it: And that Man's Religion is bottom'd upon the Sand, that hath not this divine Virtue in the Foundation of it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Virtues which the Heathen call'd Moral, and in which lay their highe&s;t Attainments, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour hath made a Part of the Chri&s;tian's Duty, by the Precepts of the Go&s;pel: But then, they are but a low Part of it, and but the ordinary At|tainments of a Chri&s;tian: But however, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Chri&s;tianity, and he can never be a Chri&s;tian that wants them.</P>
<P>So that whatever nece&s;&s;ity there is, of Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s in public Life, the Man of Religion will certainly be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the&s;e Qualities: And we may depend upon a rigorous Impartiality in the Execution of every Office he &s;u&s;tains.</P>

No; but it is impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch an one &s;hould have any Love to God. Such a Soul knows no Fervours of Devo|tion, they are Strangers to his Heart.

<P>The Man of true Religion then, will be ju&s;t his Rever&s;e: who as he has the highe&s;t Regards to the &s;piritual Entertainments of Heaven, which are the Riches of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;o will have but a mean Opinion of tho&s;e of this pre&s;ent Life; and as he is not anxiou&s;ly careful for the&s;e Things, &s;o will he never make any Breach upon his Con&s;cience, for

But this requires a per&s;onal Knowledge,

which indeed is the mo&s;t full and perfect, and al|ways rather to be cho&s;en by &s;uch as communicate to others, any Part of their Rule and Authority: But as this is oftentimes impo&s;&s;ible, &s;o are &s;uch then to be judged of, according to their general Cha|racter.

<P>When, then, there is not this per&s;onal Knowledge, and their Character is various; the next wi&s;e&s;t Thing is to con&s;ider the Qualities of &s;uch as vouch for them For that Men will (generally &s;peaking) recommend &s;uch as are like them&s;elves: And the Man of Integrity and Uprightne&s;s of Heart will &s;eldom &s;ollicite, much le&s;s will be a <HI>Spon&s;or,</HI> for a Man of Fal&s;hood and Deceit. For it is the great|e&s;t Abu&s;e of tho&s;e in Authority, and de&s;erves their highe&s;t Re&s;entment, when Men, from their own lit|tle and private Views and De&s;igns, have the Im|pudence to recommend to any Place of Tru&s;t and Importance, &s;uch unqualified Per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="5">5. If &s;uch as are de&s;ign'd to Places of public Tru&s;t &s;hould be Men of Religion, then <HI>they mu&s;t be &s;uch as have a reverential Regard to the public Wor&s;hip of God.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, a Man may pretend the highe&s;t Reve|rence for the public Wor&s;hip and Honour of God; and, as we have heard, make the mo&s;t exact Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Religion; and yet have none at all: For <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> in Mens Heart, <HI>cometh not with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">b&s;ervation.</HI> Not the keene&s;t Search will di&s;|cover the Hearts of Men, which ly hid to all Crea|tures,

and are di&s;coverable only by him <HI>before whom all Things are naked and open.</HI> But tho' the highe&s;t external Reverence, and the &s;tricte&s;t Profe&s;&s;ion, will not prove Religion in the Heart, yet it will hold negatively, That he that hath no Reverence for the &s;ocial, public Honour of God, is certainly not a Man of true Religion. For as the Man of Religion hath the Honour and Glory of God al|ways near his Heart, &s;o he will certainly endea|vour to advance and promote it by all his Actions: And therefore, as he will gladly Covenant with God, in an explicit Manner, &s;o will he continually wait upon him to do him reverence in his Hou&s;e, <HI>when the Multitudes come up there to keep holy Day.</HI></P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary then, that the Man in a public Station &s;hould be a Man of reverential Regard to the &s;ocial Wor&s;hip &amp; Honour of God in the World: For that, as the Externals of Religion are under his Guard and Protect on &s;o will he be very &s;lack both in promoting and executing the Laws that &s;upport them, when him&s;elf is a Delinquent.</P>
<P>And here, as to our committing the Guard of the Externals of Religion to &s;uch as are of own man|ner of Profe&s;&s;ion, which is tho't by many to be mo&s;t expedient, I &s;ay; That tho' every Man ought to enjoy the Rights of a good Subject, that is one; notwith&s;tanding his particular Sentiments of Re|ligion, where the Principles of that Religion do not tend to the De&s;truction of his Loyalty and O|bedience: And tho' it be abhorrent to chri&s;tian Charity to imagine, true Religion is confin'd to &s;uch as are of our own Mode of Profe&s;&s;ion: Yet, when we think it mo&s;t wi&s;e to choo&s;e rather to commit the Care of the&s;e religious Privileges (which we our &s;elves think tend mo&s;t of all others to advance
<PB N="42" REF="004026_0045_10039DB09AEFD7F0">
Religion in Heart) to &s;uch as are of the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion with our &s;elves, we cannot be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">airly fault|ed by &s;uch as are yet mo&s;t ready to blame us for it, unle&s;s they acknowledge, it would be for the Inte|re&s;t and Welfare of our Nation, that their <HI>Te&s;t</HI> and <HI>Corporation Acts</HI> &s;hould be repeal'd.</P>
<P N="6">6. We learn from what we have heard, <HI>That &s;uch as are in a public Station, &s;hould be Men of good Morals.</HI></P>
<P>As he that profe&s;&s;eth Religion never &s;o exactly, may be without the Religion of the Heart, &s;o it is very certain that he may be &s;o too, that is very exact in his external, moral Behaviour toward Men. But yet, when we have gone this length, when we have had a &s;trict Regard to the Externals of Reli|gion, and the good Life and Morals of him that is to wear a public Character, we can go no further. Then have we done all that God requires of us in that Affair, &s;o far as Religion is concern'd in it; and mu&s;t leave the Event to God.</P>
<P>Such an one as this, our Charity obliges us to think a Man of Religion; and &s;uch an one, whe|ther he be one of true vital Piety or not, yet will generally &s;tand upon the Side of Religion &amp; Vertue.</P>
<P>But the Man of bad Morals is the lea&s;t of all fit for a public Station; for as he that is in &s;uch a Po&s;t, hath both the Religion and the Morals of a People, very much under his Care and Direction, &s;o he needs all po&s;&s;ible Obligations to bind him to di&s;|charge faithfully that Tru&s;t committed to him, be|cau&s;e in the&s;e Intere&s;ts are included all the Happi|ne&s;s and Welfare of any People; &s;o he that hath the Ties of Con&s;cience upon him, lies under the &s;tronge&s;t Bonds po&s;&s;ible, to the Performance of his Duty.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="004026_0046_1003BECFD9C5BF70">
But the immoral Man cannot have the Face to pretend he acts upon a Principle of Con&s;cience, becau&s;e he declares by his general Life, that <HI>he Fears not God, nor Regards Man.</HI></P>
<P>With how ill a Grace mu&s;t he pretend to act up|on a Principle of Integrity and Uprightne&s;s, who is a Man of known Fallacy and Deceit? Is he fit to puni&s;h Prophanity &amp; Irreligion, who&s;e ra&s;h Tongue it&s;elf, often flies in his Maker's Face? Is he a pro|per Per&s;on to puni&s;h Intemperance, who is him&s;elf a Drunkard? Or how can he di&s;courage Lewdne&s;s, who is a Man of in&s;atiable Lu&s;t and Debauchery? And &s;hall he pretend to di&s;countenance Theft, Un|righteou&s;ne&s;s and Inju&s;tice, who is him&s;elf guilty of cheating and defrauding his Nei'bour&punc; or rob|bing the Public, which is the wor&s;t Theft and In|ju&s;tice? Or how can he that is in the Legi&s;lature, have any Zeal in promoting and enacting any whole&s;ome Laws again&s;t the&s;e Vices, when he knows him&s;elf &s;hall be continually liable to the Sanctions of them?</P>
<P N="7">7. And La&s;tly, From what we have heard of na|tural Integrity, we learn, <HI>That that Di&s;po&s;ition will be a valuable Addition to the religious Qualifications we have recommended.</HI></P>
<P>For a Man of &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition will more ea&s;ily, or rather with le&s;s Difficulty, be per&s;waded to act tho&s;e &s;everal Duties, which we have con&s;ider'd as nece&s;&s;ary to a Station of public Tru&s;t; while the Man of a different Bya&s;s, will find it much harder to bind him&s;elf to an uniform Practice of that Cou|rage, Truth and Fidelity, which yet are the pro|per Fruits and Effects of true Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="004026_0047_10039DB921F509F8">
For tho' the De&s;ign and Intent of Religion, be to correct all the Di&s;orders and Depravities of the Soul, yet that Di&s;order and Error that we are na|turally mo&s;t inclin'd unto, or that <HI>Sin which doth</HI> therefore <HI>mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et us,</HI> will be the la&s;t correc|ted; or at lea&s;t, &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition will be always apt to di&s;cover it&s;elf, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, in our Ac|tions, however the Heart may be truly &s;anctified.</P>
<P>So have I &s;ometimes ob&s;erv'd, &s;uch as have not only had a Name for Religion, but &s;uch as by their general Cour&s;e of Life, according to their &s;trict Profe&s;&s;ion, are well intitled to our Charity: yet ha|ving a natural Lurch to Cunning and Intrigue, have &s;ometimes made &s;uch Breaches upon their Uprightne&s;s, as a Man of natural Integrity would have been a&s;ham'd of. And tho' afterwards they them&s;elves were &s;o too, and have had their Souls humbled for it; yet by &s;uch their Di&s;&s;imulation have they not only di&s;honour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d Religion, but great|ly hurt the Cau&s;e they were intru&s;ted with.</P>
<P>But then, tho' Religion teaches and influences, produceth and binds fa&s;t upon us, that Integrity we have been &s;peaking of, yet it is not what the World commonly calls Religion, that doth this. We commonly call him a religious Man, That as he makes Profe&s;&s;ion of it, &s;o his general Life is a|greable to &s;uch his Profe&s;&s;ion; and we can tax him with no Immorality &s;carce, for that as to any Thing we can di&s;cover, he generally <HI>keeps a Con&s;cience void of Offence towards God and towards Man:</HI> This we call a Man of Religion, and we ought to call him &s;o, for we ought to think him &s;o: But if after all this he be not &s;o, as it is certain this may be the Ca&s;e, notwith&s;tanding our &s;evere&s;t Scrutiny, for that true Religion is invi&s;ible, and a Thing of the
<PB N="45" REF="004026_0048_1003BEDB314E5468">
Heart, the Knowledge of which is the Prerogative of God alone? And then, the Actions of &s;uch a Man are not done in Purity of Con&s;cience and from a &s;incere Regard to his Duty toward God: And then, (it is evident) he has not tho&s;e Ties and Obliga|tions upon him, which he had depended upon; and therefore may loo&s;e him&s;elf from all the Bonds of his outward Profe&s;&s;ion, upon &s;ome large &s;ecular Advantage he may have in View.</P>
<P>And &s;uch a Man is certainly le&s;s to be depended upon, than he that hath that natural Inclination to Hone&s;ty &amp; Uprightne&s;s, as we have before de&s;crib'd it. Upon the whole, it is evident, that this natu|ral Di&s;po&s;ition to Uprightne&s;s and Steadine&s;s&punc; will add to our Rea&s;ons for depending upon him that is, be&s;ides, a Man of Religion and Virtue.</P>

<P>And on the other Hand, what Joy do the In|jur'd and Oppre&s;&s;ed conceive from the&s;e Qualities, when they come before him for Judgment: For &s;uch an one acts like <HI>Job,</HI> that perfect and upright Man, when he &s;at in the Seat of Judgment; and like him will have the Satisfaction of an happy Re|flection upon his judicial Actions, as being done in Truth and Uprightne&s;s, when he &s;aith with him,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job 29. 12, 13.</NOTE> <HI>I delivered the Poor that cried, and the Fatherle&s;s, and him that had none to help him.

<P>As &s;uch a Man will have a Zeal for God, &s;o will he manife&s;t it in his public Capacity, by a conti|nual Concern for the Advancement of his Glory, and the perpetual Di&s;countenance of Vice and Im|morality.

Moreover, As it is always the Advantage of the Admini&s;tration, that the &s;everal Branches of the Legi&s;lature &s;hould act freely, without any influen|tial Bya&s;s, from the other Part of it: And as the particular Per&s;ons that compo&s;e this Part of the Legi&s;lature, depend upon the other Two for their Exi&s;tence: That they may neverthele&s;s act inde|pendently and freely, it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould act upon a Principle of Con&s;cience, and therefore &s;hould be Men of Integrity and Religion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, The&s;e Qualities will very much free them from a great deal of Trouble and Unea&s;ine&s;s, which they are always liable to, from the very na|ture of the Con&s;titution of this Government: For that as the other Parts of the Legi&s;lature do not al|ways agree, &s;o the Man of Artifice and In&s;incerity, that more values his Seat at that Board, than the Intere&s;t of his People, will be oftentimes (notwith|&s;tanding all his Art of Di&s;&s;imulation) in the utmo&s;t Perplexity how to act, &s;o as to plea&s;e the one, and not offend the other.</P>
<P>But as the Man of Integrity hath not the&s;e Ends in view, but rather the Satisfaction of his own Con|&s;cience, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> public Actions: He will be at no lo&s;s with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;peak the Sentiments of his Mind freely, &amp; act in the Uprightne&s;s of his Heart; believing it will be his Honour, if he be afterward either <HI>neglected or frown'd upon,</HI> for his Steadine&s;s and Sincerity.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Suffer me, my FATHERS, (for I &s;peak in the Name of God) &s;uffer me to in&s;i&s;t up|on it as your ab&s;olute Duty, and as you will an&s;wer it to the Judge of all the Earth, to appoint to the Offices of public Concern, &s;uch are endowed with tho&s;e Qualities we have &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>

Particularly, That you unite in the &s;tronge&s;t En|deavours, that the Electors this Day may have a peculiar Regard to them; <HI>That the honourable B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rd &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of Men of Integrity and Religion;</HI> who as they have very much the Guard of the royal Prero|gative, as well as the Care of the Intere&s;ts and Pri|vileges of the People, &s;o will have a ju&s;t and up|right Regard to them both: which very much tends to e&s;tabli&s;h the Peace and Quiet of the Admini&s;tra|tion.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 60. 17.</NOTE> <HI>So &s;hall our Officers be Peace, and our Exactors Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 1. 26.</NOTE> <HI>So &s;hall our Judges be as at the fir&s;t, and our Coun&s;ellors as at the beginning, and we called the the City of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, the faithful City.</HI></P>
