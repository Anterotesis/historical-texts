<P>A man &s;hall be commended according to his wi&s;dom.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS proverb &s;tates to us, not only what ought to take place, but what commonly does take place in the affairs of men. A man receives prai&s;es and honours in a mea&s;ure proportioned to the powers of his mind, the knowledge he has acquired, and the di&s;creet u&s;e which he makes of his rea&s;on and talents. Po&s;&s;ibly, in &s;ome in&s;tances, commendation may not, immedi|ately, &s;ucceed the exerci&s;es of wi&s;dom and knowledge; but, in proce&s;s of time, a man's talents and wi&s;dom &s;hall be duly acknowledged, and celebrated. The&s;e prai&s;es are the more valuable, as they are the natural and ju&s;t reward of eminent and profitable attainments.</P>
<P>What I te&s;tify, in &s;uch &s;trong terms, of the &s;uperior excellency and dignity of wi&s;dom, you will not mi&s;|apprehend, nor mi&s;take my words, as though by wi&s;|dom, I intended the mere &s;trength of a man's intellect|ual powers aided and improved by &s;cience and literature. This is obvious, that a man of great original genius and of greater acquired talents in the arts and &s;ciences, may &s;till be a man void of under&s;tanding and di&s;cretion, and to be reprobated for his folly and perver&s;ene&s;s, in the mi&s;application of his powers and attainments.</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom is a moral virtue: It implies a di&s;po&s;ition to turn our di&s;coveries to beneficial purpo&s;es; to pro|mote the intere&s;ts of others, and the purity of our own hearts. Knowledge u&s;efully employed, is alone entitled
<PB N="6" REF="035750_0006_10066395A4E720D8">
to the name of wi&s;dom, and is e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence of it. Wi&s;dom is the knowledge of what is fitting and be&s;t to be done under exi&s;ting relations and circum|&s;tances. It is the di&s;covery of the <HI>fit</HI> and the <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> and the avoiding of the <HI>un&s;uitable</HI> and <HI>injurious.</HI> Wi&s;dom is ever attended with &s;ingular advantages, and of con|&s;equence, how to obtain it, ought to be among our fir&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;olicitious enquiries.</P>
<P>I am, at this time, to give you a lecture upon wi&s;|dom. The occa&s;ion calls your attention to this &s;ubject. Happy &s;hould I be, could I place it to your view, in an advantageous, and inviting point of light. What is wanting, in the execution, your candour will excu&s;e, and your own reflections &s;upply.</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom, is a lucrative and profitable attainment. The man, who, among imperfect men, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t &s;hare of wi&s;dom, and well knew its advantages, has left this te&s;timony in its favour.
<Q>Happy is the man that findeth wi&s;dom, and the man that getteth under&s;tanding. For the merchandize of it is better than the merchandize of &s;ilver, and the gain thereof, than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies: And all the things thou can&s;t de&s;ire, are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her.</Q></P>
<P>We &s;ee men pur&s;uing enjoyment, in ama&s;&s;ing &s;ilver and gold, and rubies; in acquiring titles, honours, and &s;tations of rank and power; &s;eeking happine&s;s in bodily health, and length of days, in the indulgence of plea&s;ure, and the gay &s;cenes of amu&s;ement. Solomon tried all the&s;e various methods of happine&s;s. But, what was the re&s;ult of his experiments? It was, that wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding po&s;&s;e&s;s all the advantages to be obtained by tho&s;e other acqui&s;itions, without any of their con|comitant
<PB N="7" REF="035750_0007_1006639743031E40">
evils. Wi&s;dom &s;ecures the de&s;ired end of human happine&s;s, while other pur&s;uits are empty and fruitle&s;s. Wi&s;dom is the only mean to &s;ecure that en+joyment, which is the perpetual object of human de&s;ire. Wi&s;dom is better than &s;trength, beauty, and comely proportion; than health, long life, amu&s;ement and plea&s;ure: It is better than monies, lands, mortgages and obligations; than rich trappings and &s;plendid wardrobes: It is better than victories and triumphs; than titles, honours, thrones.
<Q>Wi&s;dom is the principal thing, therefore get wi&s;dom, and with all thy getting, get under&s;tanding. Exalt her, and &s;he &s;hall promote thee; &s;he &s;hall bring thee to honour when thou do&s;t embrace her. She &s;hall give to thine head an ornament of grace; a crown of glory &s;hall &s;he deliver to thee.</Q>
Thou &s;halt be com|mended according to thy wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>And why &s;hall men be commended according to their wi&s;dom? For this &s;imple rea&s;on, <HI>that wi&s;dom ren|ders men u&s;eful.</HI> Wi&s;dom is an operative virtue, pro|ducing the mo&s;t &s;alutary effects. Nothing is important, or valuable, in the character of man, which does not render him beneficial to others, either by his example, or by his labours. Wi&s;dom, is the qualification, which enables us to &s;ub&s;erve the intere&s;ts and happine&s;s of our fellow men.</P>
<P>Ignorance and folly, render one in&s;ignificant and contemptible, becau&s;e he is unprofitable and incapable of advancing tho&s;e u&s;eful de&s;igns and enterprizes, on which re&s;t the happine&s;s and glory of &s;ociety. He knows not how to choo&s;e, he is not di&s;po&s;ed to pur&s;ue mea&s;ures for the common good.
<Q>Wi&s;dom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkne&s;s,</Q>
for
<Q>the wi&s;e man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walketh in darkne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>The man of wi&s;dom contemplates his various rela|tions; &s;tudies and learns his own powers; and applies
<PB N="8" REF="035750_0008_1006639A5111C040">
tho&s;e powers to the improvement and well being of his connections and a&s;&s;ociates. As it is his wi&s;h to &s;ee others in an eligible and pro&s;perous &s;ituation, &s;o he has the means and capacity of ameliorating their condition, of a&s;&s;uaging the griefs and augmenting the joys of human life. The higher are his attainments in &s;cience and wi&s;dom, the more exten&s;ive are tho&s;e effects which benefit human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>To the wi&s;e man, mu&s;t we look for tho&s;e in&s;tances of moderation, &s;elf government, cha&s;tity, purity, &s;elf de|nial, placability, and munificence, which exhibit man the example, the ornament, and the admiration of the world. Wi&s;dom teaches to &s;ubdue unruly pa&s;&s;ions and moderate inordinate de&s;ires. This marks the wide di&s;tinction between a continent refined Scipio, and a ferocious brutal Alexander. This di&s;criminates the humane Patriot and Saviour of his country, from the unfeeling conqueror and butcher of his fellow men. This &s;tamps with glory an ADAMS, a WASHINGTON; while folly and madne&s;s &s;tain with infamy a French Directory.</P>
<P>Do the virtuous of every age and country, read with delight the hi&s;tory of Jo&s;eph? Do they propound his example for the imitation of their children and youth? Wi&s;dom has enrolled his name among the worthies of our race, and &s;tamped his reputation with deathle&s;s fame. Was it, that he was the &s;on of his old age, that Jacob loved him? No, it was becau&s;e, as our tran&s;lation &s;hould have copied it from the original Hebrew, "He was as wi&s;e as a Senator." His &s;u|perior wi&s;dom excited the groveling and implacable envy of his fooli&s;h and froward brethren to plunge him into the horrible pit: But the di&s;cerning eye of provi|dence rai&s;ed him thence, exalted him to honour and glory, and led him into Egypt, to &s;ave much people alive. A fore&s;eeing and faithful mind, re&s;cued him from the lewd enticements of an in&s;idious harlot, event|ually
<PB N="9" REF="035750_0009_1006639D48D3FAB0">
&s;et him in the &s;econd chariot of the kingdom, made him a father unto Pharaoh, and the deliverer of God's fami&s;hing heritage.</P>
<P>The omni&s;cient mind, fore&s;eeing the future meek|ne&s;s, fidelity, and wi&s;dom, of his &s;ervant Mo&s;es, pre|pared him for the great and eminent &s;ervices to which he was afterwards rai&s;ed; plucked him from that de&s;truc|tion to which he lay expo&s;ed, in the fens, and among the Crocodiles of Egypt; placed him in the hou&s;e of the devout and pious Jochebed, to be in&s;tructed in the &s;ublime truths of the Hebrew faith; and removed him in maturer age, to the court of Pharaoh, that he might be acquainted with all tho&s;e arts and &s;ciences, for which, the Egyptians were then &s;o famous. Thus was he furni&s;hed with a knowledge of the &s;ublime doctrines of the true religion, and was deeply ver&s;ed in all the wi&s;|dom of human &s;cience. He was
<Q>Learned in all the wi&s;dom of Egypt, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</Q>
Thus, by the fo&s;tering care of his parents, and the attending ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, Mo&s;es, in proce&s;s of time, was magnified as one of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h|ed and u&s;eful characters in the page of hi&s;tory.
<Q>And there aro&s;e not a prophet &s;ince, in I&s;rael, like unto Mo&s;es, whom the Lord knew face to face: In all the &s;igns and wonders, which the Lord &s;ent him to do, in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his &s;ervants, and to all his land: And in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Mo&s;es &s;hewed in the &s;ight of all I&s;rael.</Q></P>
<P>What but unparelleled wi&s;dom, &s;pread abroad the fame of Solomon, into all lands? Princes, from the ut|termo&s;t parts of the earth, came to &s;ee and to hear his wi&s;dom. His own happy &s;ubjects &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to him with emulous duty, and grateful love, when they perceived,
<Q>That the wi&s;dom of God was in him to do judgment.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="035750_0010_1006639F0F85C140">Why was St. Paul exalted to a di&s;tinction and eminence, &s;uperior to all the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tles of the holy Je&s;us? Why was the greater part of the chri&s;tian &s;criptures the production of his pen? Why are his acts and labours peculiarly noticed and celebrated in the in&s;pired oracles? He was crowned with the&s;e honours, in con|&s;equence of that un&s;ual &s;trength of mind, and that re|fined education, which were &s;uperadded to his extraor|dinary purity, and his ardent love to Chri&s;t. His u&s;e|fulne&s;s, and of cour&s;e, his reputation, were abundant|ly increa&s;ed by the force of his genius, and his learned education in the &s;chools of Greece, and at the feet of Gamaliel.</P>
<P>But mo&s;t of all, let our recollection dwell upon the example of the HOLY CHILD JESUS. This was the glory of his infant years, that, as he grew,
<Q>He waxed &s;trong in &s;pirit, filled with wi&s;dom, and the grace of God was upon him.</Q>
So diligent was he to improve and enlarge his mind with truth, that at twelve years of age, he confounded and put to &s;ilence, all the learned &s;cribes and di&s;puters of the Jewi&s;h temple. When he manife&s;ted him&s;elf the in&s;tructor of a peri&s;hing, de|luded world, all men marvelled at his doctrines, &s;ay|ing, "Whence hath this man this wi&s;dom?" And they te&s;tified of him, "Never man &s;pake like this man." This was the glory of Chri&s;t, that he knew how to de|vi&s;e, and was wi&s;e and faithful to accompli&s;h the works of human happine&s;s and &s;alvation; that work which his Father had given him to do. For his wi&s;dom and integrity, in the execution of his tru&s;t, God has highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name which is named in earth or in heaven: He has com|manded all the angels of God to wor&s;hip him, and to honour the Son even as they honour the Father.</P>
<P>In the&s;e illu&s;trious patterns, now &s;et to view, you perceive the beneficial effects, you approve the prai&s;es of wi&s;dom. Are you her progeny? You will cele|brate
<PB N="11" REF="035750_0011_100663A0942FB598">
her prai&s;es&mdash;"For wi&s;dom is ju&s;tified of her c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">dren." Do you emulate the glories of the in&s;truc|tors, the reformers, the benefactors, and the &s;aviours of the world? Write after their copy and you &s;hall participate their fame. Apply your minds to knowl|edge; &s;tudy to be u&s;eful, and you &s;hall, ultimately, wear an unfading crown. You &s;hall erect to your memories, a monument more durable than bra&s;s, a monument which &s;hall outlive the ravages of time.</P>
<P>Do I perceive your minds enflamed with the love of wi&s;dom? Do you appreciate its worth? Do you wi&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s this more than golden trea&s;ure? Let me, in a cur&s;ory and partial manner, point the way in which you may &s;ecure this ine&s;timable prize.</P>
<P>Would you acquire a wi&s;e and an under&s;tanding heart? Then duly e&s;timate your noble part, your in|tellectual and immortal mind. This is the dignity of your natures, the ethereal breath of your omni&s;cient creator. By this are you enabled to think&mdash;to rea&s;on &mdash;to judge&mdash;to act a part worthy of rational, moral, and &s;piritual agents. That attention which too many pay to the mortal body, you mu&s;t pay to the immortal mind.</P>
<P>Re&s;pect your&s;elves as rational beings, fitted for <HI>in|tellectual</HI> pur&s;uits and <HI>angelic</HI> happine&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>To know our&s;elves,</HI> is an e&s;&s;ential branch of wi&s;dom. Without this knowledge, the highe&s;t attainments in the arts and &s;ciences, will leave us in a &s;tate of deplorable weakne&s;s and folly. Man can never be wi&s;e, unle&s;s he knows his own powers, and for what pur&s;uits his genius and &s;ituation in life be&s;t fit him. He has made a happy di&s;covery, who has learned the tendency and force of his own mind, and for what employments in life, the Author of his being has prepared him.</P>
<P>But this di&s;covery is not enough. He mu&s;t cultivate and &s;trengthen his powers by &s;tudy and exerci&s;e. We learn mo&s;t rapidly in the &s;chool of experience. The
<PB N="12" REF="035750_0012_100663A4131E7090">
man, who &s;eldom awakes his mind, by energetic exer|tions, who lets his talents ru&s;t in idlene&s;s, is like Samp|&s;on, &s;leeping in the lap of Delilah. Rou&s;ed, by exertion, the mind feels its &s;trength; brightened, by exerci&s;e, it knows how to direct its force to the be&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>Having di&s;covered in what line we can be mu&s;t u&s;e|ful, prudence will direct us to pur&s;ue that line: And by application to it, we &s;hall not fail of gaining a lauda|ble di&s;tinction, and of being highly u&s;eful to all our con|nexions.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly, you mode&s;tly think, that you are de&s;tined to the inferior attainments of knowledge; to walk in the lower &s;teps of wi&s;dom? But this, in you, may be fal&s;e mode&s;ty. You have not, duly con&s;idered, to what lofty heights, you may ari&s;e, by a cour&s;e of dili|gence, per&s;everance and enterprize. "<HI>Nil de&s;perandum" To de&s;pair of nothing,</HI> &s;hould be the motto of tho&s;e who a&s;pire after wi&s;dom. Prodigies of learning and wi&s;dom have emerged from &s;mall and unpromi&s;ing beginnings.</P>
<P>Fortitude, an inflexible re&s;olution of mind, are e&s;&s;en|tial to the acqui&s;ition of eminent degrees of knowledge. Be not afraid of the labour and expen&s;e of getting wi&s;|dom. It was a proverb of the ancients, "<HI>Veritas in puteo" Truth is in the bottom of a well.</HI> You mu&s;t draw it out, with labour and per&s;everance. Solomon gives a &s;anction to this proverb, when he tells us, that to get wi&s;dom, we mu&s;t <HI>&s;earch for her as for &s;ilver, and dig for her as for hidden trea&s;ure.</HI> The lazy man, the &s;lothful &s;oul, can never be repleni&s;hed with truth and knowledge.</P>
<P>Not only indu&s;try, but order and method are equal|ly requi&s;ite in the pur&s;uit of wi&s;dom. We mu&s;t or|ganize and arrange our &s;tudies, and turn our minds upon &s;ubjects in their due order, and according to their importance, or we mu&s;t de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>To one who a&s;ked that great &s;tate&s;man, pen&s;ionary Dewitt, <HI>How he performed &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;o &s;hort a period?</HI> He replied, <HI>by doing one thing at a time.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="035750_0013_100663A6F9C43D10">Be always doing: Study method and order; lo&s;e no opportunity; keep &s;trait forward, and you will be a&s;|toni&s;hed at your own progre&s;s. You will leave hurry|ing, bu&s;tling, wandering travellers, far behind.</P>
<P>But let us, always, recollect the di&s;tinction between a pur&s;uit of wi&s;dom and the pur&s;uit of knowledge. To improve and enlarge our minds, that we may be u&s;eful and do good to others, is the pur&s;uit of wi&s;dom. But he pur&s;ues knowledge, only, who &s;tudies for amu&s;ement, and &s;eeks tho&s;e &s;howy parts of learning, by which, he may make a blaze, and dazzle the eyes of gaping, ill judging, &s;pectators. But, if you know your&s;elves, your talents, your opportunities, and cir|cum&s;tances, and redeem your time from unprofitable &s;tudies, and from enervating indolence, and apply all your di&s;coveries to &s;ome good account, for the im|provement and felicity of God's creatures, then do you &s;eek, then &s;hall you attain to true and &s;aving wi&s;dom. For this end, no part of human &s;cience is to be neg|lected, by which the purpo&s;e of doing good may be promoted. The art of becoming great and eminent, is, by gaining practical knowledge, the knowledge of doing to others the mo&s;t exten&s;ive benefits.</P>
<P>Our per&s;onal applications to &s;tudy and literature, &s;hould be in order to qualify our&s;elves for u&s;efulne&s;s. Every effort we make, to advance u&s;eful knowledge in &s;ociety, is a mark, no le&s;s of our wi&s;dom, than of our benevolence.</P>
<P>The object of parents, in the education of children, is to enlarge their minds, and direct them into &s;uch a train of rea&s;oning, and to in&s;pire them with &s;uch bene|ficial &s;entiments, as will be&s;t fit them for the active em|ployments of doing good. To &s;tore their minds with u&s;eful ideas, and practical &s;entiments, is to leave them the be&s;t legacy in a parent's gift.</P>
<P>All in&s;titutions of learning, are to be fo&s;tered and encouraged, as they lay the foundations, in the minds
<PB N="14" REF="035750_0014_100663A885E70068">
of youth, of future u&s;efulne&s;s. What youth acquire, in this way, will be a durable inheritance, when wealth and titles decay. While parents &s;leep in the du&s;t, the precious fruits of their care and fore&s;ight, in the good in&s;truction of their children, will be ta&s;ted by &s;ucceed|ing generations.</P>
<P>As, knowledge is e&s;&s;ential to wi&s;dom, and the arts and &s;ciences are handmaids to virtue, and give energy and &s;ucce&s;s to the feelings of benevolence, &s;o, we can|not be too a&s;&s;iduous in acquiring knowledge for our|&s;elves, or in promoting it among tho&s;e with whom we are connected in &s;ociety; e&s;pecially among the youth, the ri&s;ing hope of our country. Is he to be commend|ed, who drinks deep at the fountain of knowledge? How much more worthy of our admiration and grati|tude, is he, who liberally devi&s;es the ways and means of di&s;&s;eminating &s;cience and wi&s;dom, among our numer|ous youth of both &s;exes? He makes provi&s;ion, not only, that the Fathers, but, that the future Mothers of our race, may be richly furni&s;hed to train up their chil|dren to learning and virtue, and to become the Timo|thies, and Pauls, the Mo&s;e&s;es, and Solomons, of &s;uc|ceeding ages.</P>
<P>In plea&s;ing anticipation of the&s;e future benefits to community, do I, now, gratefully, di&s;charge the duties of my appointment, in making an honourable mention of the laudable zeal, of tho&s;e worthy citizens of <HI>Deer|field,</HI> who have made &s;uch copious &s;ub&s;criptions, and donations, for the purpo&s;e of e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;eminary of learning in this place. In aid of their noble exertions, and in an&s;wer to their petitions, the Legi&s;lature of this Commonwealth, have granted a charter of ample privi|leges for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an Academy, by the name of DEERFIELD ACADEMY; and have endowed it with a valuable tract of land, for the encouragement and &s;upport of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035750_0015_100663AA1EEC90A0">The gentlemen, who, by the act of incorporation, are entru&s;ted with the intere&s;ts and government of the Academy, have been enabled, by the munificence and energies of the friends of &s;cience, to erect an elegant building, for the accommodation of tho&s;e numerous youths, who may wi&s;h to tread the paths of truth and virtue, and qualify them&s;elves for future &s;ervice in church and &s;tate. The Tru&s;tees have been mindful of that &s;acred depo&s;it, which the bounty of individuals and of the public, have placed in their hands. They have been diligent to accompli&s;h the wi&s;hes and expectations of the public and of individuals.</P>
<P>Having completed the academic edifice, they have procured an in&s;tructor, for the education of tho&s;e chil|dren, and youth of both &s;exes, who may be committed to his care. Having received ample te&s;timonials of the literary and moral character of this in&s;tructor, the Tru&s;tees do, this day, with au&s;picious hopes, pre&s;ent him to the public, <HI>the fir&s;t Preceptor of Deerfield Acade|my.</HI> As occa&s;ions may require, other able and virtu|ous in&s;tructors, will be provided for teaching the u&s;eful branches of knowledge, and leading the youthful mind to wi&s;dom and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In this the Tru&s;tees are happy, that their wi&s;hes for the pro&s;perity of the in&s;titution are anticipated and ex|ceeded. By the liberality of &s;everal private donors, the foundation of a Library is already laid, which they wi&s;h to &s;ee increa&s;ed by additional favours from muni|ficent and enlarged minds. The improvement of the pupils, would, in this way, be abundantly increa&s;ed, and the intere&s;ts of literature greatly promoted.</P>
<P>A &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s, for &s;o &s;hort a period, has been made, in the collection of rare and valuable curio&s;ities into the Mu&s;eum of the Academy, where the minds of the inqui&s;itive and philo&s;ophical, may be luxuriou&s;ly fed, in contemplating the productions of nature and art.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="035750_0016_100663AF3524C838">Nor have the friends of &s;cience and humanity, been unmindful of the advantages of endowing the in&s;titu|tion with a &s;uitable apparatus, for aiding the enquiries of naturali&s;ts and philo&s;ophers, and for promoting the knowledge of the pupils, in the more &s;ublime parts of learning. Provi&s;ion is made for valuable additions to the pre&s;ent &s;mall beginnings of this infant in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The gentlemen of the Tru&s;t, are deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a feeling and grateful &s;en&s;e of their high obliga|tions to Mr. DAVID WELLS&punc; of Greenfield, Deacon JONATHAN ARMS, and Mrs. ABIGAIL NORTON, for their munificient donations to the Academy, for the purpo&s;e of procuring a philo&s;ophical apparatus. Fol|lowing years &s;hall celebrate this liberality and largene&s;s of heart. Future generations &s;hall reap the harve&s;t of their bounty.&mdash;And new patrons of this happy in&s;titu|tion &s;hall emulate their virtues.</P>
<P>It is, with plea&s;ing confidence expected, that the friends of freedom, of order, of &s;cience, and of reli|gion, will be the friends of Deerfield Academy. It will be the care and felicity of the Tru&s;tees, to merit the approbation and encouragement of &s;uch worthy patrons. They will labour to improve, with oeconomy, the revenues of the corporation&mdash;to impart to youth its many privileges and advantages&mdash;to provide in&s;truc|tors, who, by example&punc; and teaching, &s;hall advance the intere&s;ts of learning&mdash;of liberty&mdash;of &s;ocial order&mdash;of wi&s;dom&mdash;of virtue&mdash;and of chri&s;tianity. They will, humbly, endeavour, when they &s;hall be called off, from this honourable &s;ervice, that this tru&s;t be com|mitted to faithful men. That their labours may be animated, may be wi&s;ely directly, and happily &s;ucceed|ed, may a gracious God give to his &s;ervants, wi&s;e and under&s;tanding hearts. May the Almighty Ruler of the Univer&s;e, ever have the Academy, its officers and members, in his holy keeping.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="035750_0017_100663B0BB8457E8">To draw to a clo&s;e, may this re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly, who now wor&s;hip God in this hou&s;e of prayer, and honor the cau&s;e of literature, by their pre&s;ence, at the con&s;ecration of the Academy, to the purpo&s;es of knowledge and virtue, duly, appreciate their privileges, in this land of liberty, of light, and of chri&s;tian knowl|edge. May they cultivate their own minds with wi&s;|dom and virtue.</P>
<P>Would you, my hearers, be u&s;eful in time, and wi&s;e for eternity? Let me, la&s;t of all, and mo&s;t of all, en|treat you to go to the Babe of Bethlehem, and learn of him, who was meek and lowly, and you &s;hall find re&s;t to your &s;ouls. Go without the gates of Jeru&s;alem, and &s;et under his cro&s;s, where he bore your &s;hame and ex|piated your guilt. There, while you hear the tongues of &s;coffing wits, and bla&s;pheming infidels, deride the doctrines and in&s;ult the griefs of your dying Redeemer, you &s;hall be compelled, in admiration of the my&s;tery of eternal wi&s;dom, to cry out, "Truly, this man was the Son of God." In that Cro&s;s, which was to the Jews, a &s;tumbling block, and to the Greeks, fooli&s;h|ne&s;s, you &s;hall &s;ee and adore the wi&s;dom of God, and the power of God to your &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Do you realize a carele&s;s inattention to the mo&s;t im|portant truths? Do you feel your&s;elves peri&s;hing in your &s;ins? Do you perceive the dark glooms of infi|delity, and the hopele&s;s de&s;pair of modern philo&s;ophy? Do doubts and perplexities accompany your meditations upon the grave? Is all beyond conjecture and uncer|tainty? Look to the &s;ufferer on Calvary; enter the tomb of Jo&s;eph, of Arimathea; hear the earthquake, u&s;hering in the Re&s;urrection of Je&s;us; go to Olivet; &s;tand gazing up to heaven, until you &s;ee the a&s;cending Je&s;us, received out of your &s;ight. The&s;e &s;cenes &s;hall pluck the &s;cales from your eyes; &s;hall di&s;pel your doubts; &s;hall &s;ilence your fears; &s;hall fill you with joy
<PB N="18" REF="035750_0018_100663B299C89218">
un&s;peakable and full of glory.&mdash;For by him, who hath died and ri&s;en again,
<Q>Life and Immortality are brought to light.</Q></P>
<P>With what more &s;alutary exhortation can I conclude this di&s;cour&s;e,
<Q>If any of you lack wi&s;dom, let him a&s;k of God, that giveth to all men, liberally, and upbraideth not, and it &s;hall be given him. Take fa&s;t hold of in&s;truction, let her not go; keep her, for &s;he is thy life.</Q></P>

<HEAD>When returned from the Meeting Hou&s;e, to the Academy, the Rev. <HI>ROGER NEWTON, Pre&s;ident</HI> of the Corpora|tion, delivered the following addre&s;s, introductory of the <HI>Preceptor</HI> into office:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN and FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have now, under the &s;miles of divine providence, arrived to a period which we have been anticipating with plea&s;ure, when we have an opportunity to dedicate this Academy, to the literary and virtuous purpo&s;es, for which it has been erected.&mdash;Upon this occa&s;ion, in the name of the Tru&s;tees, I commit to you, Mr. BROWN|SON, the key of the Academy, and office of Preceptor. And you, &s;ir, being thus introduced into this &s;eminary, in its infancy, to begin the rearing and improvement of it, your &s;ituation is of con&s;equence, to your&s;elf, to the Pupils, and many others. Upon your exertions and &s;ucce&s;s, as a preceptor, we conceive the future en|couragement, and pro&s;perity of this in&s;titution, much depend. It is our ardent wi&s;h, that you may fulfil the plea&s;ing expectations which ari&s;e from the character, under which you come recommended, in teaching and governing the children and youth committed to your care, and in forming their minds and manners; and under your fo&s;tering hand, with the aid and patronage of others, may this in&s;titution flouri&s;h, and for many years to come, afford tho&s;e means of in&s;truction which &s;hall be highly beneficial to individuals, and eventually, to the public.</P>
