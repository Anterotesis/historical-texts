<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE liberties of a country, depend upon the light and information po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the people.</P>
<P>Where the e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of wor&s;hip are wrapt in my&s;tery, there can be no freedom of con&s;cience. Where the principles of government are dark and intricate, there can be no civil liberty. When attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, fair deal|ing, and upright conduct, are not con&s;idered as the only re|putable means for acquiring e&s;tates, there can be no proper and &s;teady incitement to indu&s;try, no &s;olid happine&s;s in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth, or true enjoyment of a competency.</P>
<P>There happens to be a rage in the pre&s;ent day, for ac|quiring property by accident. Some men are &s;uppo&s;ed to have made large fortunes by &s;peculations in the &s;tocks and banks: And they who have not been thus fortunate, can di&s;cover no rea&s;on, why their neighbors &s;hould be thus fa|vorably di&s;tingui&s;hed from them. And too many are ready to lay a&s;ide their ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, to pur&s;ue <HI>chance</HI> as the only godde&s;s worthy of human adoration.</P>
<P>If the following inquiries can have a tendency to cure the evils ari&s;ing from this &s;ource, the Writer will be fully com|pen&s;ated for his trouble.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand the principles of &s;tocks, and banks, it is nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand the nature and u&s;e of money; I have therefore, &s;elected a number of thoughts from the be&s;t wri|ters on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="024829_0003_0FCD66C58D02D368">The hi&s;tory of the Bank of England, I have taken from acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament re&s;pecting it. That of Paris, is taken from Voltaire's works. And the hints re|&s;pecting the other European Banks, are taken from good writers. The whole is attempted with a plain conci&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>Where the mea&s;ures of any government are criticized upon, it is done with a decent re&s;pect, but with the confi|dence of a free citizen.</P>

<HEAD>AN INQUIRY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>POSSESSIONS, however exten&s;ive they may be, are incapable of yielding happine&s;s. The wants of men are, for the mo&s;t part, factitious, and in|crea&s;e in proportion to their acqui&s;itions of property. Neverthele&s;s, by a de&s;ire of dominion over external things, and a thir&s;t for that &s;uperiority which ari&s;es from wealth, we are urged on to exertion. Almo&s;t eve|ry one, who can achieve a fair pro&s;pect, will exert all his ability to gather the fruit of it. This propen&s;ity, has a manife&s;t tendency to the advancement of the pub|lic intere&s;t; and will produce the pro&s;perity of the community, where it is exerted; unle&s;s the public mind is &s;o corrupted, as to embrace wealth, in prefer|ence to virtue, by making property a qualification to the public confidence, &s;uperior to tho&s;e of integrity, indu&s;try, learning, and ability.</P>
<P>EVERY member of civil &s;ociety, has a clear right to gain all the property which vigilance and indu&s;try, reg|ulated
<PB N="6" REF="024829_0005_0FCD66CA011319C8">
by the laws of the &s;tate, can be&s;tow upon him. Every thing he acquires in this way, advances the in|tere&s;t of the public, and &s;hews him to be de&s;erving of applau&s;e. Such a man, is the ju&s;t man &s;poken of in the &s;acred writings. He is not, perhaps, the good man, for whom "one would dare to die;" but he is a character which no one need to fear, and which mu&s;t gain the approbation of his fellow citizens: But the good man, who loves his neighbor as him&s;elf; who wi&s;hes to do good unto all; who relieves the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the poor, in proportion to his ability, and wi&s;hes the pro&s;perity of all men, as he does his own, is another character. Such men are not every where to be found; and where they are &s;een, they are tru&s;ted with caution; becau&s;e their character is frequently counterfeited, for ba&s;e and vile purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>THE divine Author of the human race, has &s;een fit to place us under various, and very different &s;ituations. Some men appear, as if they were formed for &s;ucce&s;sful enterpri&s;e; and others, as if di&s;appointment was given them, as the fruit of every undertaking. This is, no doubt, wi&s;ely ordered by HIM who&s;e plans are incom|prehen&s;ible to us, and who&s;e mea&s;ures are all founded in the mo&s;t perfect wi&s;dom. But the rules and regula|tions, adopted by civil &s;ociety, ought always to be &s;uch, as not to afford to any individual, or particular com|pany of men, an accidental opportunity, or a &s;uperior privilege, for the acquirement of property. Man|kind are naturally emulous, and it is &s;ometimes very
<PB N="7" REF="024829_0006_0FCD66CBCA15FC48">
difficult to find the line where ju&s;tifiable emulation ends; giving place to the deadly, and corro&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>envy.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREVER the laws, or the mea&s;ures of &s;tate policy, give to one man, or one order of men, an exclu&s;ive right to acquire property, or a greater and more advan|tageous opportunity to improve his, or their talents, than is given to all, there is a ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint.</P>
<P>BY a mea&s;ure, which is not founded in perfect equal|ity, a few men may frequently derive great advantages to them&s;elves, and accumulate great wealth; while others, who are fully as de&s;erving as they are, remain under the ordinary advantages ari&s;ing from indu&s;try and frugali|ty. This tends greatly to the di&s;quiet and unhappine&s;s of civil &s;ociety; becau&s;e men, who, before they ob&s;erv|ed &s;uch an undue and unu&s;ual increa&s;e of their neigh|bor's property, were contented with their own po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, become very unea&s;y. They have new and fac|titious wants upon them; and what they before enjoyed as a competency, they now e&s;teem as only the dreadful tokens of inferiority, and the marks of comparative pov|erty. This is clearly wrong in a free and equal gov|ernment. There are &s;ome men, who will live idly, and repine at that pro&s;perity of their neighbor, which is pro|duced by indu&s;try and attention to bu&s;ine&s;s; the&s;e ought to be pitied: but their malady can never be rem|edied by human laws.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="024829_0007_0FCD66CD2DDE7E20">GREAT e&s;tates are not originally acquired, unle&s;s it be by conque&s;t, or by commerce. The conque&s;t of countries, we hope, will no more deluge the world in blood, or be ever more &s;uffered to make the innocent and unoffending inhabitants of newly di&s;covered regions, the unhappy victims of cruel avarice. But commerce is intended to give great and beneficial advantages to mankind. It is the life and &s;upport of civilized &s;tates; and the great medium of communication between the people of different climates. It gives the various na|tions of the terraqueous globe, a friendly intercour&s;e with each other; and will finally, form a chain of con|fidence and friend&s;hip throughout the world. To ha&s;t|en this important and glorious event, nothing is needed but a &s;pirit of commercial enterpri&s;e, conducted with fairne&s;s, and un&s;haken integrity.</P>
<P>COMMERCE had its origin in the &s;uperfluous produce of countries, aided by a prevailing ta&s;te of the inhabit|ants of each particular climate, for the produce of for|eign &s;oils. This important negociation, no doubt, be|gan by exchanging one article for another: a de&s;ire of gain, promoted and &s;upported by a curio&s;ity, exi&s;ting naturally in the bo&s;om of the people of all nations, brought it to that height of perfection where we now contemplate it.</P>
<P>AGRICULTURE, and the arts, pur&s;ued with unabat|ing indu&s;try, mu&s;t give &s;upport to commerce; for, without this, there never can be a &s;uperfluous produce
<PB N="9" REF="024829_0008_0FCD66CEE2F02720">
to export, or an enticing mixture of the arts, with the exported articles of produce, to tempt foreign nations to a con&s;umption of them.</P>
<P>ORIGINALLY, there could be no &s;ettled rule for the mea&s;ure of exchanging one commodity for another, or for appreciating or &s;ettling a fixed value upon the ar|ticles offered in exchange. Their value was founded in the nece&s;&s;ity of the receiver, and the abundance of the deliverer's &s;tock on hand, with the probable pro&s;|pect of plenty, or &s;carcity of the article, and the ex|pen&s;es of pre&s;erving it to a future period. The value of each article was e&s;timated by the eyes, which gave the mea&s;ure of quantity, upon a view of the bulk of the commodity under the power of the transfer. This may be fairly concluded from the practice of uncivilized nations more recently di&s;covered. Recuial, in his hi&s;|tory of the voyages of the Dutch Ea&s;t-India company, a&s;&s;ures us, that in the i&s;land of Formo&s;a, when fir&s;t di&s;|covered, the inhabitants had no other way of traffic; and travellers, who may be relied upon, tell us, that in Ethiopia, the commerce of gold is carried on &s;o at the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>THE exten&s;ion and benefits of commerce, could never have been very great under &s;uch intolerable di&s;|advantages, and clogged with &s;o many embarra&s;&s;ments; it therefore became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to find out &s;omething which would &s;erve as the acknowledged re|pre&s;entative of property, and as the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;tandard
<PB N="10" REF="024829_0009_0FCD66D00EA08D78">
of the value of the articles pa&s;&s;ing in commerce; for there was no way to bring the articles offered in ex|change, to an exact, or even value with each other, and they were not always, or perhaps frequently, capable of being divided without being injured, or de&s;troyed by it.</P>
<P>METALS offered them&s;elves, as the mo&s;t &s;uitable &s;ub|&s;tance for this important purpo&s;e. As they could not be well &s;ubjected to liquid, or lineal mea&s;ure, the u&s;e of weights and balances, were nece&s;&s;arily re&s;orted to. Shells, pieces of particular wood, &s;alt, grains, fruits, and other &s;ub&s;tances, had been u&s;ed as money, or as the agreed repre&s;entative of the articles of commerce, and &s;ome of them are, in various countries, u&s;ed in that way at the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>THESE &s;igns were very inconvenient and trouble&s;ome, and therefore the moment metals were di&s;covered, it was ea&s;ily &s;een that they were well &s;uited to this u&s;e. They were found in all climates where civilization was introduced. Their hardne&s;s and &s;olidity, rai&s;e them, generally, above the accidents to which other kinds of money are liable. They may be divided without di|mini&s;hing their value. Their &s;carcity al&s;o, contributed to rai&s;e their value in the e&s;timation of the world; and the common con&s;ent of commercial people, gave them a currency as the repre&s;entative and mea&s;ure of the va|lue of things in the market.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome countries, their in&s;titution was very ancient. Abraham brought gold and &s;ilver from Egypt; and, ac|cording
<PB N="11" REF="024829_0010_0FCD66D214466A18">
to the account given by Mo&s;es, he returned very rich from that country. And we find, that in tho&s;e days, Abimelech gave Abram one thou&s;and pieces for a tre&s;pa&s;s committed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>WHEN metals were fir&s;t introduced into commerce as money, their value was determined by their weight alone. There was no &s;tamp of public authority upon them, expre&s;&s;ive of their relative value ari&s;ing from their weight and finene&s;s. Abraham gave an hundred &s;hekels of &s;ilver for a &s;epulchre, and weighed them be|fore all the people. In &s;ome countries, where gold and &s;ilver are u&s;ed as money to this day, they are cut in pieces and pa&s;&s;ed by weight. This is practi&s;ed in &s;ome parts of China, in Tonquin, and in Aby&s;&s;inia.</P>
<P>THE weighing metals, as money, where commerce is exten&s;ive, mu&s;t be very inconvenient; and therefore it has become nece&s;&s;ary to fix a &s;ign, or mark, upon each piece, expre&s;&s;ive of its true value, according to its weight and finene&s;s. If this was to be done by each individu|al at his plea&s;ure, there could be no confidence in deal|ing in them; and therefore it has been con&s;idered as the prerogatives of government alone, to fix the &s;tand|ard of alloy, and the weight of all pieces of metal e&s;tabli&s;hed as current money. There is no danger of fraud or deception in this way, for the honor, and al|mo&s;t the exi&s;tence of each nation, depends upon their rectitude on this point.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="024829_0011_0FCD66D349ED1B70">AS antiquarians are much divided in their opinions, re&s;pecting which nation it was who fir&s;t coined money, I &s;hall not attempt to &s;ettle it in this e&s;&s;ay. Herodotus a&s;cribes it to the Lydians, and others to Ithonus the &s;on of Ducaliver. Some &s;ay it was the A&s;&s;yrians; and Diodorus gives it to the Egyptians, becau&s;e he finds that counterfeiting of it in their country, was very early puni&s;hed with the amputation of the hand of the of|fender.</P>
<P>THE practice of coining money, introduced what is called imaginary money, or money of account. There are no pieces of money now, agreeing with our pounds, &s;hillings and pence, or with the French livres, &s;ols and deniers. But this mode of computation is intended to facilitate the &s;tating of accounts, and for keeping them on a regular footing. When money becomes &s;carce, the articles of commerce are lowered proportionably in their price, and they ri&s;e as money grows plenty. But &s;till, the nominal &s;tandard u&s;ed in accounts, is not al|tered. Sometimes, when a nation is involved in a war, and the public debt is too great for the public re&s;ourc|es, the imaginary, or nominal price or value has been rai&s;ed, to the great injury of public or private charact|ers, who are in &s;uch ca&s;es defrauded. Such mea&s;ures are generally evidences of public or private in&s;olvency, and are &s;eldom attempted.</P>
<P>AS coined metals were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the commercial world, as the repre&s;entative &s;ign of the articles of com|merce, if each country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an equal proportion of
<PB N="13" REF="024829_0012_0FCD66D48A38CE58">
money, according to the quantity of property offered for &s;ale in it, there would exi&s;t no other difference of price in the &s;ame article in different countries, except|ing what would ari&s;e from the tran&s;portation of it from one country to another, and from the demand for it in the market. Whereas, at pre&s;ent, the quantity of money exi&s;ting in a country, has a great effect upon the price of every article. Money is always like water, &s;eeking a level; and when it becomes plenty in one country, or place, it is nece&s;&s;arily urged away to another. He therefore, who involves him&s;elf in debt, when money is plenty, is &s;ure of being injured or ruined, if his debt re&s;ts upon him, until it grows &s;carce.</P>
<P>THE burden and ri&s;que of tran&s;porting metals from one place to another, as a general medium of commerce, rendered it nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;elect the mo&s;t valuable of them for that purpo&s;e. If gold and &s;ilver were as plen|ty as other metals, it would be very difficult, if not im|po&s;&s;ible, to rai&s;e their value, &s;eparately, &s;o much above that of the others, as it now is. There is a finene&s;s and beauty in them, which originate and &s;upport a prefer|ence in their favor; but this would not give them the rank they now &s;u&s;tain, if their comparative &s;carcity did not yield a powerful aid in their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE tran&s;porting metals, however precious they may be, from one country to another, for the u&s;e of com|merce, cannot be effected without ri&s;que and expen&s;e. This difficulty, though &s;mall in its appearance, has been &s;ufficient to produce one other &s;ign, or evidence of
<PB N="14" REF="024829_0013_0FCD66D8CEF4A8B8">
wealth, which may be called a &s;econdary repre&s;entative of the articles in commerce. The ideas of a paper me|dium for this purpo&s;e, is of very ancient date.</P>
<P>THE origin of bills of exchange has employed the cu|rious inquirers much in the &s;ame way as they have been employed upon other ancient matters, which had their birth from accident, or nece&s;&s;ity, and which were thought to be of but little con&s;equence, when they were at fir&s;t produced. It is generally agreed, that the Jews, when they were bani&s;hed from France, or the Gibelins, when they were bani&s;hed from Italy, by the faction of the Guelphs, invented this method of exchange to &s;ave their effects from confi&s;cation: thus, by delivering their effects and money to a friend, and taking his bill for a delivery of an equivalent from his effects or credits, in the country where they were to &s;eek an a&s;ylum from per|&s;ecution, they found the means of an invi&s;ible, ea&s;y, and &s;ure mode of procedure, to place their e&s;tates be|yond the reach of the extended hand of tyranny.</P>
<P>THE doctrine of exchange was encouraged by laws made in England, in the reign of Edward the third. When it was abu&s;ed, by being u&s;ed as an engine of op|pre&s;&s;ion, it was prohibited; but the facility it afforded to the then dawning commerce of that country, again revived, and gave it a legal &s;tanding.</P>
<P>THIS idea of exchange, by a paper medium, introduc|ed divers other &s;pecies of paper, as the repre&s;entatives of real money, which a&s;&s;umed a value upon the a&s;&s;ur|ance
<PB N="15" REF="024829_0014_0FCD66D9CB3D8870">
they afforded, of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors having the money on demand; or of the certainty of his receiving it at a future day, with a premium for the u&s;e of it, until it &s;hould be paid.</P>
<P>ONE &s;pecies of this paper, is commonly called <HI>&s;tocks.</HI> This word, generally, means a capital u&s;ed in com|merce, where a number are concerned in a common en|terprize, and have a capital ari&s;ing from their contribu|tions in &s;hares. But the appellation, when applied to the funded credits of a government, is entirely arbitrary, and needs an explanation before it can be under&s;tood: for in this kind of bu&s;ine&s;s, there is no exi&s;ting &s;tock, unle&s;s the plighted public faith may have that appella|tion.</P>
<P>THE foundation of this kind of paper, has lately be|come very familiar to the people of America. The re|public has &s;tood in need of aids and &s;upplies. The individuals, who form the nation, have afforded the&s;e &s;upplies upon the credit and faith of government. The republic cannot, from its re&s;ources, &s;atisfy the demands with real money; they are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of metals in quantities &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, and therefore a rea|&s;onable and equitable u&s;e ought to be engaged, for the delay; and the payment of the debt a&s;&s;ured upon a future day. The premium upon one part of the debt is at &s;ix per cent. per annum, another at three per cent. and on another there is no provi&s;ion yet in actual execution; but a dependence upon the ju&s;tice and re&s;ources of the
<PB N="16" REF="024829_0015_0FCD66DB76F3B7F0">
nation, is &s;uch, as to give the deferred &s;tock a value to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and a ready exchange in the market, for money, at a certain rate of di&s;count.</P>
<P>WHILE the nation of united America, &s;hall be able to pay an annual intere&s;t with punctuality, upon their public debt, and &s;hall convince the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the public &s;ecurities that the public re&s;ources are finally equal to the di&s;charge of the principal, the&s;e evidences of a right to receive money will hold a firm and per|manent value; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or can at all times ex|change them for gold and &s;ilver, becau&s;e there will be at all times men in the country, who will wi&s;h to have a part of their property in the hands of others, from whom they may derive a u&s;e for it, and from whom they may be a&s;&s;ured to receive it again at a fu|ture period.</P>
<P>THIS project has furni&s;hed a large, an active capital, for commerce in this country, and an&s;wers as exten&s;ive a purpo&s;e as to internal commerce, as would be an&s;wer|ed by real money: and &s;o far as foreigners are concern|ed in our public debt, it an&s;wers the purpo&s;es of real money for foreign commerce. Neverthele&s;s, it is a great grievance and burden to the people; becau&s;e, while it an&s;wers &s;ome of the purpo&s;es of real money in com|merce, the people have to pay a certain rate of intere&s;t for it, by which tho&s;e who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pub|lic &s;ecurities, derive great pecuniary advantages from the toil and labors of them, who have none. And though the rate of intere&s;t appears &s;mall, yet it is an in|voluntary
<PB N="17" REF="024829_0016_0FCD66DCC96A2800">
contribution, and deprives the people who pay it, of a great &s;hare of their profits in trade: I can|not therefore agree with tho&s;e who con&s;ider a public debt, as a public benefit.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, there is another con&s;ideration which ought to have weight; it is very po&s;&s;ible that America may be &s;o unfortunate as to be engaged in another war. Large &s;upplies may be called for, by which the exigen|cies of the government may exceed its national re|&s;ources, and the payment of principal and intere&s;t may be nece&s;&s;arily deferred to a future day. Should this ever happen, the &s;tocks will &s;ink in the hands of the proprietors. Stockjobbers will be multiplied, and public &s;ecurities be again made the engines of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion. The tran&s;actions of our own age exhib|it a variety of examples of this kind, and our integrity ought to urge us to every exertion that can have a ten|dency to prevent a repetition of them. It will there|fore certainly be well to u&s;e every means which indu&s;|try, economy, and frugality can point us to, for the &s;inking of our public debt. If there is any thing in the ob&s;ervation, that a public debt is a &s;ecurity to a gov|ernment, it can be only where a government founded on a revolution, is in danger from a counter revolution. Perhaps the idea was introduced into Great-Britain upon the large debt contracted to &s;upport the war which ex|pelled the hou&s;e of Stuarts: If there had been a coun|ter revolution there, the men who had aided William with money, would have lo&s;t their property; it was
<PB N="18" REF="024829_0017_0FCD66E09F36B900">
therefore, in that in&s;tance, their intere&s;t to &s;upport the government under the revolution. We are very apt to borrow maxims from a nation from whom we derive our common language, without examining their origin, or inquiring &s;trictly into their application to the cir|cum&s;tances of our own country.</P>
<P>WHILE there are &s;tocks transferable by their con&s;titu|tion, there will be &s;tockjobbers, or men who will buy and &s;ell &s;tocks for them&s;elves and others. While this bu&s;ine&s;s is conducted with truth, &s;incerity and fairne&s;s, it may be con&s;idered as reputable and honorable; but when in this, or in any other bu&s;ine&s;s, chicane, cunning, deceit and fraud, are adopted as the ordinary means of making a good bargain, the men, who practi&s;e in this way, renouncing the principles of truth, honor and hone&s;ty, are contemptible and dangerous in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IN Europe there are a great number of men who devote them&s;elves to this kind of traffick, and who avail them&s;elves of every art and accident to rob the unwary and nece&s;&s;itous part of the community. News of victories won by armies which had never &s;een an en|emy, of wars raging where nothing but peace prevails, and of treaties of peace between nations which had nev|er con&s;idered of preliminary articles, furni&s;h but a &s;mall part of the vile means u&s;ed to deceive and defraud the le&s;s attentive and more indu&s;trious part of the people.</P>
<P>IN our own country, and at the pre&s;ent day, &s;tock-jobbing has not been carried to &s;uch a height as it has
<PB N="19" REF="024829_0018_0FCD66E20BE68A10">
been in England; but we have no rea&s;on to conclude that all who have concerned them&s;elves in the bu&s;ine&s;s have, in every in&s;tance, taken the &s;ame care of their neighbors' intere&s;t as they have done of their own.</P>
<P>WE have other kinds of paper which we call <HI>bank &s;tock.</HI> It may be well, therefore, to &s;ay &s;omething on the nature of banks in general.</P>
<P>THE word <HI>bank</HI> is derived from the Italian word ban|co, or banca; becau&s;e tho&s;e of that nation who u&s;ed to exerci&s;e them&s;elves in this kind of bu&s;ine&s;s in the pub|lic places of trading cities, &s;eated them&s;elves upon forms with benches to write their letters, count their money, or to draw their bills of exchange. When they failed, and became unable to pay their debts, their benches were broken as a mark of infamy: from which the word bankrupt is derived.</P>
<P>A BANK now &s;ignifies a public office for keeping or circulating money, to be employed in exchanges, di&s;|counts, the loans of government, &amp;c.</P>
<P>BANKS are kept by private men on their own ac|count, or by public bodies incorporated by an act of government for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>PRIVATE bankers are generally men of large proper|ty; their bu&s;ine&s;s is lucrative according to their &s;tocks and reputation. By obtaining a credit, and by creating a confidence in the public mind, they induce men who have their property in ca&s;h, to depo&s;it it in their hands
<PB N="20" REF="024829_0019_0FCD66E38883CB58">
for &s;ecurity; for which the banker gives a paper evi|dence of the property, a&s;&s;uring the punctuality of its being redelivered on demand. This paper being, by its tenor, transferable, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it can immediate|ly, if his banker is known, exchange it for money or for any article in commerce, without any di&s;count or depreciation; and derives all the benefits from it which he could derive from real money, without a liability to tho&s;e accidents which would attend the keeping a large quantity of coin by him. But the value of this paper is founded altogether upon the a&s;&s;urance that the money is ready when called for. While this a&s;&s;urance exi&s;ts, the bill will continue to circulate with all the credit of real &s;pecie; but the moment there ari&s;es a doubt on this point, it falls into a u&s;ele&s;s, worthle&s;s &s;tate.</P>
<P>TWO principal advantages re&s;ult to the banker from &s;uch depo&s;its. Having ready money by him, he can exchange money for private &s;ecurities payable at a &s;hort but future day, receiving a rea&s;onable premium for ad|vancing the ready money. Thus if A, who lives in America, draws a bill of exchange upon B, who lives in Europe, reque&s;ting him to pay to C, or order, one thou&s;and pounds at &s;ixty days after the bill &s;hall be pre&s;ented to him; C, or his a&s;&s;ignee or indor&s;er, pre|&s;ents the bill to B, and gives his acceptance of it; but as C wants the money immediately, he may go to a banker, and if the drawer, acceptor and indor&s;er, or either of them, can be relied on, the banker will pay the money for a rea&s;onable di&s;count or premium, for wait|ing
<PB N="21" REF="024829_0020_0FCD66E749259D20">
the &s;ixty days. If there is any hazard in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s, the premium will be increa&s;ed in proportion to the ri&s;que attending it, and whether it exceeds the legal rate of intere&s;t or not, there is no law to control it: becau&s;e the idea of a hazard upon the principal, takes off the idea of illegal u&s;ury.</P>
<P>THE plan of depo&s;iting money with a banker, nece&s;|&s;arily led to that of rendering bank notes a currency in the medium of trade. From this idea the banker de|rives great advantage, becau&s;e, that by his bu&s;ine&s;s, there is a con&s;tant &s;tream of ca&s;h i&s;&s;uing through his che&s;t; by means of which he is enabled to i&s;&s;ue notes for a much larger &s;um than what he holds as his own private property: and thus by premiums on di&s;counts he accumulates a profit proportioned to the reputation he &s;u&s;tains, and the opinion the public holds of his in|tegrity and re&s;pon&s;ibility. But this opinion depends for its &s;upport altogether on the &s;ecurity he takes for the notes he emits: &s;hould the &s;ecurities he di&s;counts upon, prove in frequent in&s;tances, to be bad, it will de&s;troy his credit, and ruin his bu&s;ine&s;s. The idea he i&s;&s;ues his notes upon is, that the money is at the com|mand of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of them; and the &s;ecurities he takes con&s;titute a part of the &s;tock wherein this a&s;&s;ur|ance is grounded; and in proportion as they fail in their punctuality, the &s;tock fails on which he i&s;&s;ues his notes. It is very extraordinary and curious, to &s;ee how far the men concerned in this kind of bu&s;ine&s;s in England, France and Holland, are capable of deciding in&s;tantly,
<PB N="22" REF="024829_0021_0FCD66E8CD0E0698">
upon the credit of the drawer and acceptor of every bill of exchange offered to them for a di&s;count: it &s;hews al&s;o, in a very convincing manner, what great proficien|cy men can make in a bu&s;ine&s;s to which nature has fit|ted them, and to which alone they pay all their atten|tion.</P>
<P>PUBLIC banks are corporations e&s;tabli&s;hed by legi&s;la|tive authority, with an expectation in the government of deriving certain aids and &s;upplies from them.</P>
<P>THE bank of England, from the nature of its con&s;ti|tution, cannot be con&s;idered as a public national bank, becau&s;e the nation owns no part of the &s;tocks which compo&s;e it, although the public derive great advantag|es from it, by way of loans given upon the di&s;count of certain and fixed annuities. Where there is a national bank the intere&s;t of every con&s;iderable private banker is quite incompatible with it: hence in England, becau&s;e of the national advantages derived from the e&s;tabli&s;h|ed bank, the parliament have laid private bankers under certain re&s;trictions; and, among&s;t others, that contained in a &s;tatute made in the reign of Ann, which provides that there &s;hall be no a&s;&s;ociation of more than &s;ix per|&s;ons, in their private capacity, for the bu&s;ine&s;s of bank|ing. The number of &s;eparate private bankers in that country, is, however, very great; but the &s;ums they di&s;|count are not con&s;iderable enough to interfere with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the public bank, which could not frequent|ly attend to &s;mall di&s;counts without great inconven|ience.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="024829_0022_0FCD66EA48733D10">THE convenience of placing &s;pecie in banks, where it is &s;ecured by &s;trong bars and faithful guards from thieves, and by deep vaults from the ravages of the flames, is found to be &s;o great in commercial countries, that it is univer&s;ally adopted. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of paper which bears a demand for an immediate exchange of gold and &s;ilver, without a po&s;&s;ibility of denial, gives it all the advantages as a circulating credit which the im|agination can conceive of. Such paper embraces all the articles of commerce; and in countries where public faith and private banks are well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the com|mercial opinion, there is but very little real money u&s;ed as the mea&s;ure of trade.</P>
<P>IN a commercial country it is of but very little con|&s;equence to have a bank in credit with the people of the country where it exi&s;ts, unle&s;s it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the faith of foreigners coming there to trade.</P>
<P>PUBLIC banks are of two kinds; tho&s;e of the fir&s;t are wholly in&s;tituted on the public account, and placed un|der the direction of magi&s;trates, or officers of the gov|ernment, who are to take care of the bullion or &s;pecie de|po&s;ited in them for the u&s;e of the proprietors, and by their order to be managed for profit or advantage. Such is the famous bank in Am&s;terdam, which is con|ducted with &s;o much fidelity and exactne&s;s, that one of the magi&s;trates was executed for appropriating a &s;mall &s;um, although he returned it in a &s;hort &s;pace of time, and before the fact was di&s;covered. The regulation of that bank is &s;uch as gives it the highe&s;t public confi|dence,
<PB N="24" REF="024829_0023_0FCD66EEE8AB4910">
by means of which there is &s;carcely an in&s;tance of any money which has once been there depo&s;ited, having been taken out. Convinced, that the money is always ready when demanded, the man who is to re|ceive a payment from another, is contented to appear at the bank, and to be credited the &s;um in bargain, on the bank books; and he again transfers it in the &s;ame way to another; &s;o that the &s;ame &s;um will be pa&s;&s;ed in a thou&s;and payments without being &s;een, weighed or count|ed by any one, excepting him who fir&s;t depo&s;ited it in the bank. Thus millions are negociated in a week, with|out weighing or counting money. This ea&s;y mode of doing bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;upported by an un&s;haken confi|dence, that the money is ready at all times, when call|ed for by the per&s;on in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the paper eviden|tial of its being depo&s;ited. Should this confidence be once brought into doubt, all the authority of a mo&s;t arbitrary government, exerted by a mo&s;t vindictive and independent magi&s;tracy, would not be able to maintain the character of the bank, or to give currrency to its credits for one day.</P>
<P>IT is confidently a&s;&s;erted by writers, that the money depo&s;ited in this bank amounts to three thou&s;and tons of gold, or as &s;ome &s;ay twenty eight millions &s;terling. Sir William Temple, who examined that bank with the prejudice of an incredulous Engli&s;hman, tells us, that <Q>the place where the trea&s;ure of this celebrated bank is lodged, is a great vault under the town hou&s;e, provided with doors, locks, and every other &s;ecurity
<PB N="25" REF="024829_0024_0FCD66F04AE5C3B0">
nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of the contents. And that whoever goes there will di&s;cover a va&s;t trea&s;ure in bars and ingots of &s;ilver plate, and al&s;o an incredi|ble quantity of &s;acks full of metal, &s;aid to be gold and &s;ilver; but as there are none but the Burgoma&s;|ters who have the direction of this bank, and as there are none who keep an account of what is brought in, or carried out, it is impo&s;&s;ible to know, or even to gue&s;s, with exactne&s;s, the proportion there is between the real and imaginary trea&s;ure of it. It does not &s;olely depend upon the effective gold and &s;ilver actually depo&s;ited for its credit, but is &s;upported by the credit of the city and of the &s;tates; of which the funds and revenues are as great as tho&s;e of &s;ome kingdoms.</Q></P>
<P>BY the con&s;titution of this bank and the laws of the &s;tate, all the payments on bills of exchange, and for whole&s;ale goods, are to be made at the bank only, un|le&s;s the &s;um is not &s;o high as three hundred guilders; &s;o that the debtor is obliged to carry his money into the bank, and the creditor is obliged to go there to receive it.</P>
<P>WRITERS &s;ay that the city of Am&s;terdam is &s;upport|ed in the real magnificence in which it appears, by the profits of this in&s;titution, while all the people are fond|ly willing to lodge their money where it will &s;afely re&s;t &s;ecured from every po&s;&s;ible accident, and where they can u&s;e it without the trouble of telling or of weighing it.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="024829_0025_0FCD66F1C87E7428">THIS bank makes no negociable bills, but gives re|ceipts for money depo&s;ited, which are good to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or for the &s;um mentioned, and which may be tran&s;|ferred by certain e&s;tabli&s;hed forms.</P>
<P>THE profits of this bank are immen&s;e, though the &s;ources of them are concealed with the u&s;ual &s;ecre&s;y and &s;ilence of the Dutch people. But it may be ea&s;ily &s;een that they give receipts for depo&s;its, which exi&s;t only in &s;ecurities, and on which they receive unlimited premi|ums for their di&s;counts.</P>
<P>THE bank of Paris was erected upon the &s;cheme of Mr. Law, a Scotchman, in the year 1716; and in its hi&s;tory gives a &s;triking in&s;tance of the impracticability of &s;upporting a paper medium without an unfailing a&s;&s;urance of a ready exchange for &s;pecie.</P>
<P>THIS attempt was made during the regency of the Duke of Orleans, and has been very &s;everely treated by Engli&s;h writers; but the account here given of it is taken from Voltaire's works, and may be relied on.</P>
<P>THERE are two cla&s;&s;es or characters of men who are naturally avaricious; the one is compo&s;ed of them who heap up wealth with an ambitious view to excel their neighbors in point of property; the other of them, who have no regular bounds to their expenditures, and are therefore always &s;treightened in their finances, let their income be what it may. The regent of France was in the latter cla&s;s. His demands for money in his pri|vate
<PB N="27" REF="024829_0026_0FCD66F691078328">
and in his public capacity, were in&s;atiable; a pro|ject, therefore, for affording ample &s;upplies, was very flattering to him.</P>
<P>MR. Law projected his plan upon principles which, if they had been &s;trictly pur&s;ued, would have been an improvement on all the preceding plans in Europe; but he wi&s;hed to flatter the court. He propo&s;ed that he and his a&s;&s;ociates &s;hould &s;upply the funds that &s;hould be admini&s;tered by the authority of the government; and that the bank &s;hould have the appellation of the bank royal. This plan was approved by the council, and was finally adopted.</P>
<P>THE bank thus organized, effected all the purpo&s;es which were expected from it. The quantity of circu|lating medium was exceedingly increa&s;ed. The people had a great facility in the payment of impo&s;ts. Com|merce received new life, and derived new vigor from the aid of the in&s;titution. In the &s;econd year of its ex|i&s;tence, the government ordained that the bank notes &s;hould be received as ca&s;h in every branch of the reve|nue.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of the bank was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing, that in the &s;econd year the government wi&s;hed to be the &s;ole proprietor, as well as the only director of it, and ac|cordingly purcha&s;ed all the &s;tock.</P>
<P>THE power of this government being uncontrola|ble, the plan of urging into circulation a medium by
<PB N="28" REF="024829_0027_0FCD66F7CCB62680">
the voice of &s;overeign authority, without adequate funds for the &s;upport of it, was conceived. The event was &s;uch as might be expected. The bank notes were di&s;|covered to exceed the real &s;pecie depo&s;ited and the funds provided as a con&s;tituent for them, and they therefore depreciated with great rapidity. In the year 1722, they were thrown out of circulation; and one writer ob&s;erves that they were not finally worth the value of the paper on which they were printed. Com|merce in that country received a &s;hock from which it has never been recovered. The finances of the nation became deranged, and the ability of the government was exceedingly di&s;graced.</P>
<P>THERE were men then who made great e&s;tates from the public calamity; and by the &s;plendor of their fortunes intoxicated the people in England and in the Netherlands. Hence aro&s;e the South Sea bubble in Great Britain, divers mad &s;chemes in Holland, and the fa|mous land bank in New-England, which for &s;everal years controled the elections of the province, created incura|able confu&s;ion, and finally ruined a great number of families.</P>
<P>THE emi&s;&s;ion of paper bills of credit in the New-England &s;tates was fir&s;t no other than the anticipation of particular taxes; but as the &s;pecie could not be pro|duced to be exchanged for them at all times when de|manded, they could not avoid a depreciation. This depreciation virtually le&s;&s;ened the quantity of medium, and created a nece&s;&s;ity for a further emi&s;&s;ion; whence
<PB N="29" REF="024829_0028_0FCD66F948EEE938">
it has happened that there never has been an in&s;tance of emitting bills but where they have been redeemed at a depreciated value, if redeemed at all.</P>
<P>NEW-HAMPSHIRE had paper money at all times be|fore the year 1768. The &s;ituation and character of the people were changed for the better, almo&s;t immediately on their having a regular, unfluctuating medium of commerce.</P>
<P>RHODE-ISLAND being more out of the control of the government of the mother country, has always had a paper medium, or a bank without &s;tock. The effects are too ea&s;ily &s;een to need a comment.</P>
<P>THE bank of Genoa is the mo&s;t ancient bank in Eu|rope; the date of its in&s;titution is not certainly known. This bank was fir&s;t con&s;tituted from certain branches of the public revenue, upon which, &s;ums were borrowed during the exigencies of the commonwealth, and which, for a long time, were not violated through any per|plexities. But by their &s;tate being involved in the wars of the la&s;t and pre&s;ent centuries, they exhau&s;ted their trea&s;ury, went beyond their public re&s;ources, and for ever de&s;troyed the credit of their bank. The com|merce of their country died with it. The &s;tate lo&s;t, and has never yet regained its importance.</P>
<P>THESE are not the only in&s;tances which hi&s;tory af|fords of the extreme folly of attempting to &s;upport the credit of a paper repre&s;entative of money by the mere authority of government, without being able to com|mand
<PB N="30" REF="024829_0029_0FCD66FC09DA56C0">
real money, promptly, to &s;upport the credit of it.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of all the &s;tates &s;everally in 1775, and of all conjointly repre&s;ented at that time in Congre&s;s, produced in&s;tances where the mo&s;t determined patriot|i&s;m, &s;truggling for what was ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the foundation of all that could render life and property worthy of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, attempted in vain to &s;upport a paper credit upon the mere authority of law. Severe penalties were annexed to even &s;peaking again&s;t the va|lue of the currency. Very &s;ingular and terrible tribu|nals were in&s;tituted, with &s;ummary and arbitrary pro|ce&s;&s;es, to puni&s;h tho&s;e who dared to con&s;ider the &s;igns of money, which never exi&s;ted, as unequal to gold and &s;ilver; but all was ineffectual, the depreciation became exceedingly rapid. It was with great addre&s;s &s;ugge&s;t|ed, that the money did not fall, but that the articles of commerce ro&s;e in con&s;equence of the war. And the two la&s;t remedies attempted, were &s;topping the auctions and regulating prices by laws. Had the laws of na|ture admitted of paper bills of credit, where there was no real money to exchange for them, being capable of repre&s;enting the money of the world, the&s;e efforts could not have failed of &s;ucce&s;s, more e&s;pecially when the greate&s;t penalty of all was the &s;tigma of a want of pat|rioti&s;m, and the unhappy offender's being held up to the people, by committees, as an enemy to his country's liberty.</P>

<P>IN former times, the idea of improving the public credit, as an active efficient capital, with all the advan|tages of a full, circulating medium, was never conceiv|ed. The kings of the nations in Europe, when pre&s;|&s;ed by the exigencies of the &s;tate, u&s;ed to borrow money on pledging the jewels of the crown, or on mortgag|ing the lands of the royal domain, or by &s;ome other pledges of valuable property.</P>
<P>THE Jews are remarkable for &s;trong traits of nation|al character, but for none more than their ability and adroitne&s;s in managing money.

<P><PB N="32" REF="024829_0031_0FCD66FE90087A18">WHEN William the third, had expelled James from the throne of England, and had, by the war through which that revolution was effected, involved the nation in a heavy debt, he had recour&s;e to the principles, and the practices of the children of I&s;rael for relief. Un|der the exigencies of his affairs, his mini&s;ters introduc|ed plans, which other nations, as well as America, have been glad to imitate. Among&s;t which was that of the famous bank of England. One Mortimer, who wrote in the year 1761, &s;uppo&s;es that William had been initi|ated into the principles of &s;tate banking, at Am&s;terdam, by his friends of that city.</P>
<P>THIS bank was erected in the year 1693, to com|mence in June 1694. The king and queen, by an act of parliament, were empowered to i&s;&s;ue their commi&s;|&s;ion, under the great &s;eal, appointing commi&s;&s;ioners to take &s;ub&s;criptions by any per&s;ons, natives or foreigners, for rai&s;ing one million two hundred thou&s;and pounds: and the parliament agreed to rai&s;e one million five hun|dred thou&s;and pounds upon certain annuities, and to pay the governor and company of the bank one hundred thou&s;and pounds annually. The bank loaned the gov|ernment one million &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds. The one million two hundred thou&s;and pounds was the &s;tock in real money, depo&s;ited by the &s;ub&s;cribers, and the debt due from the government on the above loan, and for which was pledged the faith of parliament upon the above &s;tipulated annuities, con&s;tituted another part of the &s;tock. The bank &s;tock has been increa&s;ed by
<PB N="33" REF="024829_0032_0FCD6700091E1370">
new &s;ub&s;criptions, according to divers acts of parlia|ment, and the charter of the bank continued during the exi&s;tence of the annuities pledged by government for the money borrowed. The la&s;t act of parliament for that purpo&s;e was made in the year 1781, in con&s;idera|tion of a loan of two millions to pay off a debt of the navy department.</P>
<P>THE acts regulating the bank, provide that their debts &s;hall never exceed their capital &s;tock, and that if they &s;hould, at any time, exceed the capital, the indivi|dual members &s;hall be liable, of their own private e&s;tates, for &s;uch exce&s;s. The money lent to the gov|ernment being on the credit of the nation, that credit is con&s;idered as good &s;tock, becau&s;e certain duties are irrepealably pledged; and there can be no rea&s;on to believe that any po&s;&s;ible exigency would induce them to violate their faith in a matter upon which the credit and commerce of their nation &s;o much depends. A failure in that bank would derange the finances of the government, de&s;troy their commerce for a time at lea&s;t, and involve the nation in a great and almo&s;t irretrieva|ble calamity. To prevent this, the parliament guaran|tees the credits of the bank, by providing that their notes or bills, drawn to the amount of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, originally payable by the govern|ment annually, and the increa&s;e of that &s;um, by &s;ub&s;e|quent acts on loans, &s;hall be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the others; and if they &s;hall be demanded at the bank on days of di&s;count, between the hours of nine and twelve
<PB N="34" REF="024829_0033_0FCD67049FD31458">
in the forenoon, and not paid, then, on affidavit being made of the fact, they &s;hall be immediately paid in the exchequer, without any further proce&s;s or delay, and without any other warrant. The &s;ums &s;o paid, are to be charged to the one hundred thou&s;and pounds, and the increa&s;e of it annually payable by the nation to the bank. The other credits are warranted by act of par|liament, providing, that when judgment &s;hall be ren|dered again&s;t the governor and company of the bank, and the money not paid on producing the execution, that the &s;ame &s;hall be brought into the exchequer, and be there di&s;charged by the public trea&s;ury without any further warrant or delay. This provi&s;ion is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the credit of the company, becau&s;e their private e&s;tates are not liable for any thing more than what their debts &s;hall exceed their capital, and their corporate property cannot become at to be taken in ex|ecution.</P>
<P>THE intere&s;t originally allowed by the nation to the bank, was four pounds for the annual loan of one hun|dred pounds; but it was afterwards, on other loans, al|tered to four and an half per cent. on others again to four; and on the loan of 1781 it was reduced to three per cent.</P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee, that this mighty piece of machinery, on which almo&s;t all the national movements of Great-Britain depend, is &s;upported by the certainty which the creditors realize, that they can receive, when they &s;hall call for it, the real money for their paper, evidential of
<PB N="35" REF="024829_0034_0FCD67060AE3DF50">
the depo&s;it. Some of their writers have advanced prin|ciples which no &s;ober man will agree in, that a nation has a right to e&s;tabli&s;h what they plea&s;e for a medium of commerce, and that it is quite immaterial what that medium is compo&s;ed of. If by this a&s;&s;ertion they mean, that a people, by their uncon&s;trained, common con&s;ent, have a right to receive what they plea&s;e in exchange for articles of commerce, they are right; and this me|dium, or mea&s;ure of appreciation, is money to all who receive and can pa&s;s it. But there is no government, however forcible it may be in other matters, which can impo&s;e any thing be&s;ides the precious metals, on the people, as money, for any con&s;iderable time together. The paper of the bank of England is the money of that country, but it is not e&s;tabli&s;hed as &s;uch, by legal au|thority. It was never attempted as a tender for debts, but has re&s;ted on the voluntary con&s;ent of the commer|cial people, as receivable on the idea, that it repre&s;ent|ed money which is at all times ready to be produced.</P>
<P>SOME of their writers be&s;tow the mo&s;t extravagant encomiums on this in&s;titution; while others, who are apparently as patriotic, as learned, and as candid, con|demn it as a bubble which will finally bur&s;t; as an engine of oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty which tends to tyranny, and will finally ruin the nation.</P>
<P>THE bank of the United States of America, is on principles of the &s;ame cla&s;s with tho&s;e on which the bank of England is e&s;tabli&s;hed, but depends upon the credit of the government for a greater proportion of its
<PB N="36" REF="024829_0035_0FCD6707DADF8440">
&s;tock. There is only one quarter part of that &s;tock in real money; the other three quarters are in public &s;e|curities of the public funded debt at &s;ix per cent. in|tere&s;t, and three per cents. at half the nominal value. The value of them &s;ecurities depends upon the a&s;&s;ur|ance of their final payment, and on the punctual pay|ment of the intere&s;t &s;tipulated. Should there be an ex|pectation of a failure in either of the&s;e, the credit of the bank would be proportionably injured; but them &s;ecu|rities are, by the economy of the trea&s;ury, &s;o blended with that of the bank, and that of the bank with the exi&s;tence of the government, that they mu&s;t be the la&s;t pillars which will be &s;uffered to be overturned by a public calamity. Whether it was either fair or nece&s;|&s;ary to give, in the operation of this &s;y&s;tem, particular holders of a part of them kind of public &s;ecurities this great advantage, is not nece&s;&s;ary now to be decided: but the advantages re&s;ulting from a part of the &s;tock, being compo&s;ed of them, is &s;o immen&s;e, that the bank cannot fail of a &s;upport, as far as the proprietors are able to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>SEVEN millions and an half of dollars, three quar|ters of the &s;tock which ari&s;es from the &s;ub&s;cription of individuals, is compo&s;ed of them &s;ecurities; &s;o that this three quarters of the &s;tock, are a loan to government, upon &s;ix per cent. intere&s;t, and the &s;tockholders have a right to i&s;&s;ue bank notes to the full amount of their capi|tal, at the &s;ame rate of intere&s;t, by means whereof the pro|prietors of the bank, have a legal right to receive twelve
<PB N="37" REF="024829_0036_0FCD670908864FE0">
per cent. upon that part of their &s;tock; and this makes a u&s;e of ten and an half on the whole, including the part which con&s;i&s;ts in hard money. Upon this idea, the &s;ub&s;cribers to the bank would have been glad to have &s;unk the intere&s;t to three per cent. if they could not have become &s;ub&s;cribers without. The advantage ari&s;|ing from their having a right to extend their credits to the amount of all the money depo&s;ited for &s;afekeeping; and the determination of the trea&s;ury to depo&s;it all the monies ari&s;ing from the revenue in their hands, is &s;o ex|ceedingly great, that this would have been a good bar|gain on the &s;ide of the &s;tockholders at three per cent. for their &s;ecurities.</P>
<P>THE debts due from the corporation are never to ex|ceed their capital, and the money actually depo&s;ited in the bank for &s;afekeeping. They are not to trade, or to buy or &s;ell any thing but bills of exchange, and &s;ilver and gold; and &s;hould their debts ever exceed ther capi|tal, and the &s;pecie in depo&s;it for &s;afekeeping, in &s;uch ca&s;e the directors who i&s;&s;ue the notes, and all the pro|prietors who &s;hall be then pre&s;ent, and &s;hall not enter their di&s;&s;ent to the mea&s;ure, &s;hall be liable in their per|&s;ons and in their private e&s;tates.</P>
<P>BY the above provi&s;ion, the creditors of the bank are completely &s;ecured, provided that the directors and acting proprietors are either faithful, or of &s;ufficient ability. Should this precaution be inadequate, there are other checks provided, which are able to afford the highe&s;t a&s;&s;urances that can be rai&s;ed on the principles of banking upon public credit.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="024829_0037_0FCD670C3B235FB0">THE officer at the head of the trea&s;ury department, has, by the act of incorporation, full authority to de|mand a &s;tate of the debts, and credits; an account of their &s;tock actually exi&s;ting in effective money, and of the depo&s;its in their hands; moreover, the act provides, that their notes &s;hall be received in the payment of all duties and revenues, in the room of real money. This will give the bank a credit as exten&s;ive as the quantity of money in demand, for all impo&s;ts, exci&s;es and du|ties, and fully guarantees their credit, unle&s;s they &s;hall &s;well it beyond the limits of the revenue. Upon every view of this corporation, we mu&s;t conclude, that while &s;o great a part of their &s;tock &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of public &s;e|curities, and the credit of them &s;hall be fully &s;upport|ed, the advantages of the bank will be exceedingly great to the proprietors. The United States further guarantee the &s;even million and an half of dollars, by allowing them to be in public &s;ecurities. The advantages of this corporation by far exceed any thing of the kind which has heretofore been attempt|ed, excepting the Pari&s;ian bank: that was attempted as a public, this is a private advantage.</P>
<P>THERE can be no wonder that the opening a &s;ub&s;crip|tion, which offered &s;uch immen&s;e and unprecedented profits to the people who &s;hould be lucky enough to be concerned, &s;hould rai&s;e &s;uch a bu&s;tle among the &s;pecu|lators in paper &s;ecurities, and finally afford &s;o much chagrin at the di&s;appointment of the un&s;ucce&s;sful part of the community. If the members of congre&s;s had been
<PB N="39" REF="024829_0038_0FCD670D8CB743A8">
men of like pa&s;&s;ions with the other citizens of America, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame jealou&s;y in regard to private intere&s;t which men generally have in private life, we might have wondered that they &s;hould &s;uffer a few men to em|brace &s;uch extraordinary privileges in exclu&s;ion of all others, and to ravi&s;h very great e&s;tates from the public exigency, which others were as fairly entitled to as they were. Congre&s;s &s;eemed to have been aware of what was to be expected upon opening the &s;ub&s;cription; for they attempted what, perhaps, &s;ome of them thought to be a &s;ure and &s;alutary preventative, by the &s;upplement|ary act. By that it was provided, that no one per&s;on &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe more than thirty &s;hares in one day; but no provi&s;ion was made again&s;t &s;ub&s;cribing in fal&s;e or in unauthorized names. It was clearly evident that the &s;ub&s;cribers would throng on the occa&s;ion; and yet no effectual mea&s;ures were adopted to prevent monopo|ly, frauds and impo&s;itions.</P>
<P>THESE advantages were fore&s;een by nearly all the people; but the members of congre&s;s did not di&s;cern them in their public capacity. The hou&s;e appropriat|ed to receive &s;ub&s;criptions, was, as &s;oon as the au&s;pi|cious day dawned, crouded by an incredible number of people: if a golden mountain had been kindled, emit|ting from its crater a lava of the pure&s;t gold, liquid, yet tangable, the croud would not have been greater, or exhibited more inten&s;e eagerne&s;s to &s;hare in the plunder.</P>
<P>THOSE who appeared on this occa&s;ion, were not all of them patriots, who had &s;aved their country, or the
<PB N="40" REF="024829_0039_0FCD670F09FAAC18">
mo&s;t de&s;erving part of the community of united Amer|ica. The men who had ri&s;qued their lives in the war, or who had parted with their patrimonies or hard earned e&s;tates, to &s;ave the public liberty, &s;tood at a di&s;tance, and with a&s;toni&s;hment beheld the &s;ingular and unexpect|ed phenomenon. The &s;ecurities which they received for their &s;ervices and properties, in the place of gold or &s;ilver, and had &s;old at two &s;hillings and &s;ix pence in the twenty &s;hillings, re&s;umed their pri&s;tine value in the hands of their new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and greatly enlarged their new and unexpected value by the machinery of the American bank.</P>
<P>AS an apology for &s;uch undue advantages to a part of civil &s;ociety, it is &s;aid, that it is of no con&s;equence to the government which of the citizens po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the property. This is not true: a great part of our wants are factitious, ari&s;ing from what we &s;ee in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others; and therefore, when a few men, by an in|equality of operation in the laws of the ruling power, accumulate fortunes, and live in unequalled &s;plendor, it corrupts the ta&s;te of the other part of the communi|ty, and draws their attention from their ordinary means of bu&s;ine&s;s. It produces a &s;pirit of envy, and renders tho&s;e unhappy, who before had been quite contented with their &s;ituation. There are but a &s;mall part of mankind who can look with contentment, like David, on the greatne&s;s of wicked men, and con&s;ole them|&s;elves, that they are only like a green bay tree, which flouri&s;hes for a little time, and then is not to be found.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="024829_0040_0FCD6712C8A21158">GOLD and &s;ilver is the acknowledged repre&s;entative of property of every kind; but paper is the repre&s;enta|tive of nothing but money; and where the money is not actually exi&s;ting, ready to be exchanged for the pa|per, then the paper repre&s;ents nothing but public or private credit, and the credit may be good or bad, ac|cording to a variety of different circum&s;tances, acci|dents and events.</P>
<P>I SHOULD not do ju&s;tice to my readers if I did not tran&s;cribe a page from a pamphlet written by Dr. Price, on the nature of civil liberty, in the year 1776.</P>
<Q><P>SPECIE repre&s;ents &s;ome real value in goods or com|modities; on the contrary, paper repre&s;ents immedi|ately nothing but &s;pecie; it is a promi&s;e or obliga|tion, which the emitter brings him&s;elf under to pay a given &s;um in coin; and it owes its currency to the credit of the emitter, or to an opinion that he is able to make good his engagement, and that the &s;um &s;pe|cified may be received upon being demanded. Paper, therefore, repre&s;ents coin; and coin repre&s;ents real value, that is, the one is a &s;ign of wealth, the other is the &s;ign of that &s;ign. But farther, coin is a univer&s;al &s;ign of wealth, and will procure it every where, it will bear any alarm, and &s;tand any &s;hock; on the contrary, paper, owing its currency to opinion, has only a local and imaginary value. It can &s;tand no &s;hock. It is de&s;troyed by the approach of danger, or even of the &s;u&s;picion of danger. In &s;hort, coin is the ba&s;is of our paper credit, and were it either de&s;troyed, or were only
<PB N="42" REF="024829_0041_0FCD6713E2DAE9A0">
the quantity of it reduced beyond a certain limit, the paper circulation of the kingdom would &s;ink at once.</P>
<P>FROM this account it follows, that, as far as in any circum&s;tances &s;pecie is not to be procured in exchange for paper, it repre&s;ents nothing, and is worth nothing. The &s;pecie of this kingdom is incon&s;iderable, compared with the amount of the paper circulating in it. This is generally believed, and therefore it is natural to in|quire how its currency is &s;upported. The an&s;wer is ea|&s;y: it is &s;upported in the &s;ame manner with other bub|bles. Were all to demand &s;pecie in exchange for their notes, payment could not be made; but at the &s;ame time that this is known, every one tru&s;ts that no alarm will happen while he holds the paper he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; and that if it &s;hould happen he will &s;tand a chance to be fir&s;t paid, and this makes him ea&s;y: but let any event happen that threatens danger, and every one will become diffident. A run will take place, and a bank|ruptcy follow.</P>
<P>THE account I have given of paper circulation, implies, that nothing can be more delicate or hazard|ous; it is an immen&s;e fabric with its head in the clouds, that is continually trembling with every ad|ver&s;e bla&s;t and fluctuation of trade; and which, like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion, may, in a moment, van|i&s;h and leave not a wreck behind.</P>
<P>KING William's wars drained the kingdom of &s;pecie: they &s;unk the revenue and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed the gov|ernment.

In 1694 the bank was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the kingdom was provided with a &s;ub&s;titute for &s;pecie; ever &s;ince that period our paper and taxes have been increa&s;ing together and &s;upporting one another.</P></Q>
<P>IT was expected at that time, that Doctor Price's pamphlet would have had &s;ome tendency to prevent the mini&s;try of Great-Britain from pro&s;ecuting the Ameri|can war: but as we had nothing our&s;elves to depend upon but bills of public credit; and the&s;e too without any &s;pecie, or any public &s;tipulated funds whereon to found them; the argument was &s;tronger again&s;t us, than again&s;t our enemies. We had however, been in &s;ome mea&s;ure u&s;ed to a paper medium, and enthu&s;ia&s;m &s;up|plied the place of faith, and confidence: and whil&s;t the people parted with their property to defend their rights, they con&s;idered all as a nece&s;&s;ary &s;acrifice to liberty.</P>
<P>MANKIND have a natural di&s;inclination to labor and exertion. In a &s;tate of nature, hunger is a &s;timulous to the &s;avage, or he would continue idle and inactive. In &s;ociety, ambition, that natural, and avarice, that arti|ficial pa&s;&s;ion, urge men to exertion; but neverthele&s;s, labor is irk&s;ome, and all they who can devi&s;e &s;ome oth|er method of gratifying their inclinations, and obeying the commands of their pa&s;&s;ions, will mo&s;t certainly do it: hence it is, that we find every one, who can drive a bargain to advantage, for&s;aking the plough to do it.</P>
<P>MONEY is &s;carce or plenty in a country, according to the demand for it. As it repre&s;ents the articles expo&s;ed
<PB N="44" REF="024829_0043_0FCD6716942A3B40">
to commerce, and as commerce increa&s;es in proportion to the quantity of money found to pur&s;ue it with, there can never be a very long &s;pace of time together in which money can be plenty in compari&s;on with the de|mand for it.</P>
<P>THE public &s;ecurities of the United States of Amer|ica were a dead, inactive kind of property, previous to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the con&s;titution of the new govern|ment; they then became at once the object of avarice. They before had an exi&s;tence, as to value, on the &s;len|der hope of having &s;omething done for them at &s;ome di&s;tant future period; and obtained a motion only from the &s;agacity of a few, who happened to be right in their conjectures re&s;pecting the then future events of American financiering. Upon the adoption of the new &s;y&s;tem of government, they a&s;&s;umed all the properties of a ri&s;ing credit, and became an immen&s;e active capital for commerce; but not for &s;uch a commerce as was advantageous to the people; their activity centered in them&s;elves; and while they &s;welled the medium, they created proportionably a demand for more. The ap|parent &s;ucce&s;s of &s;ome &s;peculators, increa&s;ed the num|ber engaged in that kind of traffic, until the great towns and cities were filled with that kind of gentry.</P>
<P>THE plan of the bank &s;till gave a new force to this kind of traffic, for it gave an opportunity to &s;ome part of the community to turn their &s;peculations to immen&s;e and unexpected advantage. While all the public &s;e|curities
<PB N="45" REF="024829_0044_0FCD671809B3DF18">
might be con&s;idered as an active medium, the con&s;titution of the bank gave the proprietors authority to add &s;even millions and an half of dollars to the whole: be&s;ides this, their having authority to i&s;&s;ue notes in proportion to the money actually depo&s;ited for &s;afekeeping, will prevent the dormancy in effect of any real money.</P>
<P>WE owe &s;pecie for all the paper which is now in cir|culation, and yet the &s;pecie in fact in the country, bears no proportion to it. This has been the ca&s;e with us before; for we have once and again crouded the &s;pecie out of the country by floods of paper money, and have pa&s;&s;ed through two or three &s;tates of national bankruptcy with all the calmne&s;s of a company of philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>SOLOMON tells us that the rich have many friends; but our Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, by making others rich, has obtained money; and his reputation derives &s;upport, as well from the greatne&s;s of his character for enterpri&s;e, as from the pecuniary intere&s;t which &s;o many rich men have in the &s;upport of it. But the game he has played is very deep, as well as very &s;plendid, and the whole fabric he has rai&s;ed with &s;o much eclat, may be at once overthrown by a run upon the bank. He will therefore guard, with the utmo&s;t caution, the emitting quality of it; for &s;hould it ever be induced by the exi|gencies of the public, or by any other means, greatly to exceed its capital, he may have to follow Mr. Law to Venice, in order to find an a&s;ylum from the public re|&s;entment. When he &s;hall be removed from office, it

will be difficult to find a &s;ucce&s;&s;or who &s;hall obtain the confidence which he has acquired, and the day of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion will, no doubt, be a day of hazard, expectation and anxiety.</P>
<P>THE bank of the United States mu&s;t be maintained, if it can be done, by the means of credit. But while the bank of England, which owes no more than &s;ixteen millions &s;terling more than its &s;pecie capital &s;tock, has the &s;upport of a nation which has in circulation &s;ixty millions; the bank of the United States, which will owe &s;even, perhaps eleven millions of dollars more than its capital &s;tock in &s;pecie, is &s;upported by a nation in which there is not exi&s;ting more than eight millions of dollars in &s;pecie; its &s;ituation mu&s;t de&s;erve great at|tention, and its economy be taken care of with great circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>THE government of Great-Britain, in order to &s;ecure their bank, are under a nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;training and of regulating even private bankers, while all the govern|ments in united America are vieing with each other in e&s;tabli&s;hing private banks, or banks for the benefit of private companies. In fact, the idea of a paper curren|cy is &s;o familiar with us, that we &s;eem incapable of re|&s;i&s;ting any one temptation that is offered to us for the emi&s;&s;ion of paper bills of credit. If this &s;pirit continues to prevail, according to the ideas and on the principles at pre&s;ent advocated, our bank bills will very &s;oon be on a par with the old continental money. The bank of the United States, on which the honor and &s;afety of
<PB N="47" REF="024829_0046_0FCD671C888964F0">
the nation &s;o effectually depends, will be exceedingly injured, if not rendered in&s;ecure and u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>AMIDST the various &s;chemes which have been adopted for giving a currency to paper bills, that of e&s;tabli&s;hing the corporation called the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bank,</HI> is the one which de&s;erves the mo&s;t attention. When nations have been pre&s;&s;ed with expen&s;ive wars, or other intolerable calamities, they have had recour&s;e to their public credit; in the &s;upport of which, every member of the civil community has been in &s;ome mea|&s;ure intere&s;ted. But the idea of giving a few men a corporate capacity to i&s;&s;ue, regulate, and control the medium of commerce among a great trading peo|ple, was before unprecedented, and &s;erves rather to evince the inattention than the &s;kill of tho&s;e who e&s;tab|li&s;hed it.</P>
<P>THIS plan was conceived in the year 1785, in a time of profound peace, and without any view to &s;ink a pub|lic debt, or to procure a public conveniency; it was an indulgence to a few men in the &s;tate, who happened to a&s;k the legi&s;lature to grant it to them, without the prof|fer of any kind of reward. By means of this authority, the proprietors of that bank have had it in their pow|er to govern the medium of commerce in and about the metropolis of the &s;tate. By emitting large &s;ums they have rai&s;ed the price of public &s;ecurities, and of other articles in the market; and by refu&s;ing again to loan, have brought on an artificial &s;carcity of money, and &s;unk the price of the &s;ame articles; this has given
<PB N="48" REF="024829_0047_0FCD671E08C4E750">
them all the advantages which could be gathered from the mo&s;t enormous monopolies. Trade has been per|plexed by a capricious and un&s;teady medium; great quan|tities of property, more e&s;pecially public &s;ecurities, have been &s;acrificed to a punctuality, to a corporation which never had it in its power to be punctual it&s;elf if there had been a run upon it.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;cribers to this bank, with their a&s;&s;ociates, were incorporated without any limitation of time or credits. Their &s;tock is never to exceed five hundred thou&s;and pounds; but, upon this, they <HI>had</HI> a right to i&s;&s;ue as much paper as they could obtain a market for, and were under no obligation as to the quantity of cap|ital, only that it &s;hould not exceed the &s;um abovemen|tioned; and let them i&s;&s;ue as much as they will, the public, or the holders of their notes, have no remedy again&s;t their private e&s;tates. This is an agreed point, for the &s;hares being transferable in their nature, it is quite impo&s;&s;ible to know who the proprietors are. The act of congre&s;s for e&s;tabli&s;hing the bank of the United States, has provided, that the directors and the proprie|tors actually pre&s;ent, when there &s;hall be an agreement to i&s;&s;ue more than their capital and depo&s;its, &s;hall be held liable in their natural capacity. The &s;ame pro|vi&s;ion is made by parliament re&s;pecting the bank of England; from all which we may conclude, that the proprietors are not liable by law in their natural capa|cities, without &s;uch provi&s;ion; for if they were &s;o lia|ble for all the debts of the corporation, there could be
<PB N="49" REF="024829_0048_0FCD672057AB5768">
no nece&s;&s;ity for the &s;pecial provi&s;ion in the in&s;titution of a bank.</P>
<P>THE notes i&s;&s;ued by the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts' bank are not by force of any law receivable in taxes or revenues, or a tender in any ca&s;e as money; neither are they in any other manner warranted to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors by the gov|ernment. They are i&s;&s;ued under the authority of the government, and yet the &s;tate is not re&s;pon&s;ible for their credit.</P>
<P>THE corporation of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts' bank then amounts to nothing more than an authority delegated to a few men, in exclu&s;ion of all others, to make as much paper money as they &s;hall plea&s;e to i&s;&s;ue, and to draw an intere&s;t upon it from the borrower at &s;ix per cent.</P>
<P>THEY have not failed to improve an authority &s;o very &s;ingular and advantageous, for they have had nearly one million of dollars in circulation at a time, when they had no preten&s;ions to have in their vault more than two hundred thou&s;and dollars. This gave them an intere&s;t of thirty per cent. upon their real money, if they had the &s;um abovementioned actually depo&s;ited in &s;tock, while the re&s;t of the community were under heavy penalties if they &s;hould take more than &s;ix per cent. for the loan of their monies.</P>
<P>THE General Court, in their &s;e&s;&s;ion of the winter 1792, became alarmed at the operation of this bank; but, perhaps, the alarm was given by the men who were intere&s;ted in the northern branch of the American

bank. They &s;ent a committee who inquired, but never explicitly reported upon the credits and debts of that corporation. It &s;eemed to be under&s;tood in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives that it was a matter which ought not to be &s;poken upon, and a bill was pa&s;&s;ed, limitting the i&s;&s;ues of their credits to double their capital.</P>
<P>THIS mea&s;ure was much more extraordinary than the original in&s;titution; becau&s;e that, in 1785, the &s;ubject was new in the country; but the principles of banking had been under a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion in the year 1791, while the American bank was in con&s;ideration; and the Gen|eral Court took up the matter of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts' bank, expre&s;sly, to inquire into and to regulate it; and yet they &s;et it down again upon principles which were never adopted in any other part of the world.</P>
<P>ALL other banks are confined in their credits to the &s;tock actually depo&s;ited, and to the depo&s;its of private individuals; but this bank is allowed to i&s;&s;ue double its capital without any a&s;&s;urance or guarantee from the public, that their credits &s;hall be maintained. Their capital may be five hundred thou&s;and pounds, of con|&s;equence they may have in circulation, and draw inter|e&s;t upon five hundred thou&s;and pounds which does not exi&s;t, upon a paper currency which in fact repre&s;ents nothing, upon a repre&s;entative which has no con&s;titu|ent. Thus they are incorporated with power to make thirty thou&s;and pounds a year, without making any con|&s;ideration for it. The intere&s;t upon their loans they anticipate by taking it at the time of the loan, and thus
<PB N="51" REF="024829_0050_0FCD6723787EEFB8">
rai&s;e a compound intere&s;t, which pays all their charges, and leaves them twelve per cent. upon their capital be|&s;ides. But if this was not the ca&s;e, they are not at &s;o much expen&s;e in loaning, and in collecting the money they loan, as individuals would be at in managing the &s;ame quantity of property.</P>
<P>THEY pretend, that there can be no want of &s;ecurity, becau&s;e, when they i&s;&s;ue their notes, they draw good &s;e|curity from the borrowers. Upon this idea, their notes are &s;o far from being the repre&s;entative of real money, that they are nothing more than the repre&s;entative of the credit of men, with whom the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or has no ac|quaintance, and of who&s;e circum&s;tances he is totally ig|norant.</P>
<P>THESE men have led the government into the di&s;|reputable idea of giving a corporation authority to act as private bankers, without their private e&s;tates be|ing liable for their debts. The notes of private bank|ers are i&s;&s;ued upon the credit of their reputation and private e&s;tates. It is a matter between them and their creditors, and the public have no concern in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s. If they fail, the &s;tate is under no nece&s;&s;ity, by equity or honor, to warrant their credits.</P>
<P>NO doubt, there are &s;ome gentlemen of that corpo|ration, who&s;e honor and con&s;cience would oblige them to pay their dividend, out of their private e&s;tates, if there &s;hould be a failure; but they would not con&s;ider them|&s;elves as held for more than their own &s;hares. And
<PB N="52" REF="024829_0051_0FCD6724C832CCF8">
even this re&s;ource, precarious as it is, may &s;oon fail; for the&s;e men are mortal, and we know not who will hold the &s;hares a few years hence which they now hold.</P>
<P>BY this in&s;titution this company has taken &s;ix per cent. upon nearly all the commerce in and about Bo&s;ton. And what is more extraordinary, they have had it in their power to &s;well and le&s;&s;en the medium of the country when they plea&s;ed, and con&s;equently, to rai&s;e or fall the price of articles in commerce as they &s;aw fit. We have &s;een &s;o much mi&s;ery in our own age, ari&s;ing from the bad economy of paper money, that we are called upon by every principle of honor and ju&s;tice to avoid it in future. If we &s;in again we mu&s;t do it again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t light and the cleare&s;t information.</P>
<P>THE increa&s;e of the number of banks in other &s;tates, is no rea&s;on for their being multiplied in this. We have been long in the habits of a paper medium: in the year 1745 we i&s;&s;ued a large &s;um, which, after a rapid fall, was redeemed at a great depreciation by a grant from the mother country. We were then obliged to prohibit the paper money i&s;&s;ued in the other New-England &s;tates, from being received in this. For this purpo&s;e all per&s;ons elected to any kind of office, and all tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to take an execution for a debt, were obliged, pre|viou&s;ly, to take an oath that they had not taken any bills of credit of the other provinces within this.</P>
<P>IF bank notes are valuable, only as they repre&s;ent &s;pecie ready to be exchanged for them, we ought to be very careful of our conduct re&s;pecting banks.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="024829_0052_0FCD672976EB7E78">THERE is a natural propen&s;ity in mankind to obtain property by art, by accident, and by any thing be&s;ides labor and indu&s;try: when peculiar advantages are pro|po&s;ed from a plan which will gratify them, however prepo&s;terous it may be, or however incompatible with the public intere&s;t, it cannot fail of obtaining votaries. The accumulation of wealth by the proprietors of the American bank, and of tho&s;e who are proprietors of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts' bank, have intoxicated a great part of the community; and it may be well to examine the princi|ples which ought to move the legi&s;lature in this bu&s;ine&s;s. The people of Salem have petitioned for a bank, and have obtained the &s;anction of one branch of the legi&s;la|ture in favor of it. Another bill for e&s;tabli&s;hing a ton|tine has been arre&s;ted in its career, only by a majority of one in the &s;enate. If the Salem people, and the ton|tine a&s;&s;ociation, or either of them, &s;hould finally pre|vail, there are many other people in the &s;tate who have an equal claim with them, and who will openly, and with good rea&s;on, charge the government with grant|ing exclu&s;ive privileges to one &s;et of citizens in prefer|ence to the others, unle&s;s they are indulged in the &s;ame way. The great complaint is, that the favors of the go|vernment are partially be&s;towed, and the advantages of the laws unequally di&s;tributed. The complaint will gain &s;trength by each act of government in this way, until all are benefited to their own &s;atisfaction, or in a way to convince them, that the weakne&s;s of a govern|ment is the de&s;truction of the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="024829_0053_0FCD672ACAF4C770">THE true idea of erecting corporations is to enable them more ea&s;ily and advantageou&s;ly to improve the pro|perty which they have; but the idea of giving them corporate powers to gain money by taking an intere&s;t on a capital which does not exi&s;t, is creating a property for them. It amounts to a gift from the &s;tate, and is quite inadmi&s;&s;ible; yet the propo&s;ed Salem bank, the tontine, and the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts' bank, are all calculated on this idea.</P>
<P>THE creation of banks gains exceedingly in the pub|lic opinion, in the &s;ame way that emi&s;&s;ions of paper mo|ney have heretofore obtained in this &s;tate, obtain now in &s;ome others, and lately in Rhode-I&s;land. But if paper currency is the repre&s;entative of &s;pecie, where is the &s;pecie to be found? The &s;pecie now active in the country bears no proportion to the paper in circula|tion. As the paper increa&s;es, the &s;ilver will grow &s;carce. Our commerce is with foreign countries, who will very &s;oon, if our banks are multiplied, refu&s;e our paper currency, and our mighty bubbles may bur&s;t up|on us.</P>
<P>IT will be doing nothing more than ju&s;tice to this &s;ubject to give the reader Dr. Price's opinion upon it in his own words.</P>
<P><Q>PUBLIC banks are, undoubtedly, attended with great conveniencies; but they al&s;o do great harm: and if their emi&s;&s;ions are not re&s;trained and conducted with great wi&s;dom, they may prove the mo&s;t per|nicious
<PB N="55" REF="024829_0054_0FCD672C4825AD98">
of all in&s;titutions, not only by &s;ub&s;tituting fic|titious for real wealth; by increa&s;ing luxury; by rai&s;|ing the prices of provi&s;ions; by concealing an unfa|vorable balance of trade; and by rendering a kingdom incapable of bearing any internal tumults or external attacks, without the danger of a dreadful convul&s;ion; but particularly by becoming in&s;truments in the hands of mini&s;ters of &s;tate, to increa&s;e their influence, to le&s;|&s;en their dependance on the people, <HI>and to keep</HI> up a delu&s;ive &s;hew of public pro&s;perity, when perhaps ruin is near.</Q></P>
<P>THE plan of a public bank for private emolument is &s;till more dangerous. If it is given to a few only, they will be able to command the markets, monopolize by them&s;elves, or their confidential connections, what arti|cles they plea&s;e, to fix a capricious e&s;timate upon every thing, and unduly to influence all the mea&s;ures of the government. If it is general, then we mu&s;t have a flood of paper medium, which, like our former paper curren|cy, will &s;ink in the hands of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>SINCE the ta&s;te of the public is rai&s;ed in&s;atiably for a bank, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to have one; but it ought to be upon &s;uch a plan as will allow a great number of the people to participate of its advantages, and to be for the good and benefit of all the citizens in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THERE is one objection generally made to this plan, that a paper currency will give us an overflowing medi|um, and finally do great inju&s;tice. There is great
<PB N="56" REF="024829_0055_0FCD672F30CB7868">
weight in this objection; but we are to take mankind as we find them. To contend again&s;t all the follies and weakne&s;s of the people would be but a poor way to govern them. If there is no other bank than the two now in Bo&s;ton, the people, the trade, and the regula|tion of the medium, will be wholly given up to their ca|price and humor. They will emit all the paper which they can lend upon good &s;ecurity, without any regard to the &s;ufferings of the people, and at &s;uch times only as &s;hall tend to their own emolument in another way. They will act in concert, for the proprietors of each are gen|erally intere&s;ted in both banks.</P>
<P>I THEREFORE venture to propo&s;e another bank, in which all the people, as members of the &s;tate, &s;hall be intere&s;ted, and a great number more, as private proprie|tors.</P>
<P>THIS plan ought to originate with the General Court, without any regard to private petitions, or a&s;&s;ociations; for why &s;hould a number of men, merely becau&s;e they a&s;&s;ociate and petition, have &s;uperior or exclu&s;ive privi|leges to gain advantages, alike due to all? Upon the expectations of &s;uch a&s;&s;ociations, &s;peculations have been &s;et on foot, and large &s;ums of money have been made upon a mere &s;porting with the weakne&s;s and conde&s;cen|&s;ion of the government. We are all on the &s;ame grade of privileges, and nothing can induce our repre&s;enta|tives to divide us from our equal rights of free citi|zens.</P>

It is by no means a charter of privilege; if it is, the General Court had no right to grant it, becau&s;e the con&s;titution expre&s;sly provides, that no <HI>exclu&s;ive privilege</HI> &s;hall be granted to any man, or body of men. It is not like an incorporation to build a bridge, or to cut a canal, becau&s;e, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the government grants a property in a river, which belongs to the &s;tate; and in the la&s;t it is only a grant of power to u&s;e the property and &s;oil which they have bought, or may buy of others. But the incorporation of this bank is an open, expre&s;s privilege of taking more intere&s;t for their money than other people have a right to take. If it is not a grant of exclu&s;ive privilege, it is on the &s;ame foot of other legi&s;lative acts, &s;ush as incorporating towns and proprietors, which laws may be repealed at plea&s;ure.

Here was no contract between the&s;e people and the gov|ernment, nor did the latter receive any reward or con|&s;ideration for the grant.</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;ay that there never was any other public bank e&s;tabli&s;hed on principles &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts' bank, I do not take into con&s;ideration the &s;everal banks e&s;tabli&s;hed in America by the legi&s;la|tures of the &s;everal &s;tates. I have not attended to their &s;everal in&s;titutions, and &s;hould not hold my&s;elf obliged to regard them, if their principles are now in the theory of banking. It is one of the defects of free and popu|lar governments, that the ruling power being depend|ent by frequent elections, upon the will of the people, and that people being liable to be influenced by party intere&s;ts, many mea&s;ures obtain which do not tend to the public good. The &s;everal banks in this country may have been obtained by fair means, but yet may, in them&s;elves, be wrong. There is, as Cicero &s;ays, no power on earth capable of making that right in it&s;elf which is naturally pernicious, or to make injury a law|ful act.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to take notice of a mea&s;ure adopted in congre&s;s in December 1781. Robert Morris, E&s;q. had propo&s;ed a plan for a bank of the United States. This bank was e&s;tabli&s;hed by an ordinance, as far as con|gre&s;s had power to do it; but not on principles &s;o ex|ten&s;ive as tho&s;e contained in the plan propo&s;ed. In the plan it was provided that the bank notes &s;hould be received in payment of all taxes and duties in all the
<PB N="59" REF="024829_0058_0FCD6733C9F42C08">
&s;tates: This would have given the proprietors of the bank full power to have emitted a paper currency for the whole union, and to have drawn an intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent. upon the whole annually. Congre&s;s did not in their ordinance, even provide that the bank notes &s;hould be received by the federal trea&s;ury. But the General Court of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in their act pa&s;&s;ed in March 1782, made provi&s;ion that all debts due to the confederated &s;tates &s;hould be receivable in the notes of this company; and that no other bank &s;hould be erect|ed in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THIS company were, by the ordinance of congre&s;s, re&s;tricted as to the quantity of property they &s;hould hold, but not as to the debts they might owe. They therefore might i&s;&s;ue notes to as large an amount as they plea&s;ed; and there was no provi&s;ion for making the directors or proprietors liable in their natural capacities for what &s;hould exceed their capital.</P>
<P>SOME of the &s;tates did not agree to this extraordina|ry attempt for money making; and it is rather difficult to find where it now is, or what was the final &s;ettlement of it.</P>
<P>THAT I may be better under&s;tood in my ideas of a bank for the commonwealth, I take the freedom to mention the outlines of it, without having an idea that the principles offered are perfect, but only hoping to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome u&s;eful thoughts on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;everal rea&s;ons which plead in favor of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="024829_0059_0FCD673651CA88F0">THE commonwealth being a &s;overeign &s;tate, ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s re&s;ources independent of any other &s;tate or government. Should the &s;tate, by an in&s;urrection, or by any accident or adventitious di&s;tre&s;s, be under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of anticipating a tax by the loan of money, a &s;tate bank would be very u&s;eful, and prevent the nece&s;|&s;ity of an application to an office where it might be re|jected.</P>
<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;tate bank will form an inter|e&s;t &s;trongly oppo&s;ed to the incorporation of any other. It will be the be&s;t of all intere&s;ts, the intere&s;t of all the people: and the bank can, from time to time, be ex|tended, when it &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary, by new &s;ub&s;crip|tions; and a proper proportion of the &s;pare &s;pecie may he improved in that way.</P>
<P>THIS method, if there can be any tru&s;t or confidence in the governing power of the commonwealth, will pre|vent the incorporation of a number of banks which otherwi&s;e will be applied for and obtained. It will prevent a flood of paper money which will otherwi&s;e be i&s;&s;ued on the credit of private men, under the &s;anction of the government, without any &s;pecie to be repre&s;ent|ed by it. By this, individuals will be prevented from rai&s;ing or falling the medium of commerce to an&s;wer particular purpo&s;es of &s;peculation; and the mea&s;ure of trade will be rendered permanent, certain and &s;teady.</P>
<P>THERE is a complaint, that money is not plenty enough to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of trade. There never
<PB N="61" REF="024829_0060_0FCD67378AF77308">
was a long time together when this complaint did not exi&s;t. Gold and &s;ilver repre&s;ent all other property; and when they abundantly increa&s;e in a country, the nomi|nal value of every thing which is offered to &s;ale, or compared with them as with the mea&s;ure of real value, will ri&s;e in proportion to their abundance, and there will be &s;till a complaint for money, though &s;ilver and gold &s;hould be as plenty as &s;tones on the earth,</P>
<P>SPAIN experienced a &s;carcity of money when gold and &s;ilver had become as plenty there as lead or any other common metal; and the influx of bullion ruined the nation.</P>
<P>IF our commerce was an interior commerce, paper, &s;hells, iron, bra&s;s, &s;alt, or any thing el&s;e, might do as the &s;ign of wealth; but as the money which we want is to carry on our traffic with other nations, we mu&s;t have tho&s;e &s;igns of wealth for a medium which the world has agreed to receive as &s;uch; and we may i&s;&s;ue paper as frequently as we plea&s;e, but if that paper cannot com|mand the &s;ilver and gold when called for, it mu&s;t de|preciate. Every in&s;tance of depreciation gives a new demand for more emi&s;&s;ions, in the &s;ame manner as if a part was &s;unk or &s;truck out of circulation.</P>
<P>I KNOW that the Engli&s;h writers pretend that there is not in the bank of Am&s;terdam, one quarter part in gold and &s;ilver of the value of the &s;um repre&s;ented by the paper i&s;&s;ued from thence. I doubt the truth of the a&s;|&s;ertion: but if it is true, the people who receive the
<PB N="62" REF="024829_0061_0FCD66C00934B850">
paper believe the real money to be there; and as none but the magi&s;trates have acce&s;s to the books, it cannot be contradicted by evidence. But we live in a coun|try, in an age, and are a people where no &s;uch decep|tion can take place. If we were ignorant enough to be thus practi&s;ed upon, we &s;hould be incapable of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a free government.</P>

<P>THE corporation to never receive a greater premium than &s;ix per cent. for di&s;counts upon notes, or bills of exchange.</P>
<P>NO other bank or corporation for banking to be al|lowed.</P>
<P>NO number of per&s;ons to be allowed to a&s;&s;ociate for the purpo&s;e of banking.</P>
<P>SOME men imagine that banks will always owe more money than their capital &s;tock and the monies depo&s;it|ed for &s;afekeeping; that is, that they will, by conniv|ance of the directors, i&s;&s;ue notes far beyond their pro|perty. But this is a kind of cunning and chicane which never ought to be allowed of. If the bank e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="66" REF="024829_0065_0FCD67430C201488">
in a country, can, without injuring the public, loan more money than they have a right to loan, their capi|tal &s;tock ought to be increa&s;ed by a new &s;ub&s;cription, otherwi&s;e they will draw an intere&s;t on a capital which does not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS will never be the ca&s;e, unle&s;s there is a greater demand for money in trade than there is in agriculture; for banks can never &s;upply the farmers with loans; and if all the &s;pare money is ve&s;ted in bank &s;tocks, there never can be a &s;ufficient quantity in the hands of private per&s;ons to &s;upply tho&s;e who wi&s;h to take on land &s;e|curity.</P>
<P>WITH many prudent and wi&s;e men, it is a que&s;tion far from being &s;ettled, whether an ea&s;y acquirement of mo|ney on loan, is for the advantage of the farmers. Where new lands are purcha&s;ed at a low price, the increa&s;e of their value from their own improvement, and the im|provement and &s;ettlement of the lands round them, may render them able to pay an intere&s;t of &s;ix per cent|um per annum on their purcha&s;e money. But it is very evident, from every calculation, that an old farm will never afford &s;uch an intere&s;t on the purcha&s;e money given for it.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, where money is offered on loan for &s;e|curity by mortgages, there will be frequently moments when farmers, from a variety of inducements, will un|nece&s;&s;arily run in debt and lay the foundation of their own ruin. A &s;on wants a &s;ettlement, or a daughter her
<PB N="67" REF="024829_0066_0FCD674448936388">
portion on marriage; the pride of the family predomi|nates over prudence, the mother urges to a gratifica|tion of the children, and the father, upon the &s;ame mo|tive, or from a wi&s;h of ea&s;e and quiet, complies. The whole are made happy for one year, and then all in|volved in ruin and di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>BANKS are not intended for loaning on land &s;ecuri|ties; and if all the &s;uperfluous money is u&s;ed in banks, the farmers will not obtain any. It will all be u&s;ed in that way if &s;uch enormous and unprecedented advantag|es are offered as we have &s;een in the national and Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts' banks. The only method, therefore, is to have only one bank be&s;ides the branch of the United States' bank: to give the government an intere&s;t in that, by which we &s;hall all be benefited, and to let the advantages be &s;o moderate that there will not be a crowd pre&s;&s;ing to be admitted. By this method, there will be a proper proportion of money improved in banks to facilitate trade, and a proper proportion re|maining to be loaned to farmers by individuals.</P>
<P>THE de&s;tiny of man, is to acquire his bread by toil and labour. But there is almo&s;t a univer&s;al reluctance to a compliance with this decree of our Maker. The wi&s;hes of men, are boundle&s;s as the wide exten&s;ion of eternity: and no place, no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and no acqui&s;i|tions are competent to the factitious wants of the hu|man race. The law which annexes want, &s;ufferings, and di&s;grace, to idlene&s;s, is not more oppo&s;ed to the inclinations of men, than &s;ome others are. There is
<PB N="68" REF="024829_0067_0FCD67467A757FF8">
no time, &s;ea&s;on, climate, or weather, which gives &s;ati&s;|faction to all the &s;ubjects of it, in &s;hort, man is at war with his own nature, and with his natural nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>THERE is &s;omething very in&s;tructive in the fable of Midas, who&s;e avarice urged him to petition, that what|ever he touched might be changed into gold. His wi&s;hes being complied with, he had nothing to eat, drink, or wear, but what was di&s;qualified for tho&s;e u&s;es. People are generally wi&s;hing to turn almo&s;t every &s;ub|&s;tance into money, without con&s;idering, that this would render gold and &s;ilver of as little con&s;equence to the world, as the &s;tones in the &s;treet. In fact, it would bring them to di&s;tre&s;s and de&s;truction, like the man in the fable, if they could obtain the grant of what they wi&s;h.</P>
<P>DR. Robin&s;on gives the world a very &s;triking ac|count of the misfortunes which Spain derived from the exce&s;s of gold and &s;ilver procured from South America. He repre&s;ents that kingdom as the mo&s;t commercial in Europe, when their fleet fir&s;t entered the river de la Pla|ta. But when they had acquired an abundance of the precious metals, they lo&s;t their con&s;equence and pro&s;|perity. <Q>Under the reigns of Ferdinand and I&s;abella, and Charles the Fifth, Spain was one of the mo&s;t in|du&s;trious countries in Europe. Her manufactures in wool, and flax, and &s;ilk, were &s;o exten&s;ive, as not only to furni&s;h what was &s;ufficient for her own con|&s;umption, but to &s;upport a &s;urplus for exportation. In the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, Spain is
<PB N="69" REF="024829_0068_0FCD674816597368">
&s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed above a thou&s;and merchant &s;hips; a number probably far &s;uperior to that of any nation in Europe.</Q></P>
<P>THEN, after de&s;cribing her mode of trade, he goes on to ob&s;erve, that <Q>wealth which flows in with mod|erate increa&s;e, feeds and nouri&s;hes that activity which is nece&s;&s;ary to commerce, and calls it forth into vigor|ous, and well conducted exertions; but when opu|lence pours in &s;uddenly, and with too full a &s;tream, it overturns all &s;ober plans of indu&s;try, and brings along with it a ta&s;te for what is <HI>wild and extravagant, or dar|ing in bu&s;ine&s;s or action.</HI> Such was the great and &s;ud|den augmentation of power and revenue, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of America brought to Spain, and &s;ome &s;ymptoms of its pernicious influence upon the politi|cal operations of that monarchy &s;oon begun to appear. Her flouri&s;hing manufactures, early in the &s;eventeenth century, were fallen into decay. Her fleets, which had been the terror of all Europe, were ruined. Her exten&s;ive foreign commerce was lo&s;t. The trade be|tween different parts of her own dominions was inter|rupted, and the &s;hips which attempted to carry it on were taken and plundered by enemies whom &s;he once de&s;pi&s;ed. Even agriculture, the primary object of indu&s;try in every pro&s;perous &s;tate, was neglected, and one of the mo&s;t fertile countries in Europe hardly rai&s;|ed what was &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of her own in|habitants.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is a mo&s;t &s;olemn le&s;&s;on to nations, and if at|tended
<PB N="70" REF="024829_0069_0FCD674A04DAEB80">
to, will &s;trongly urge them not to wi&s;h an over|grown medium of commerce, even though it &s;hould be compo&s;ed of gold and &s;ilver. But when we &s;ee the people of a country zealou&s;ly engaged in pur&s;uit of an overflowing medium which has no credit beyond cer|tain limits, and there, only from po&s;itive laws, which has no value in its own compo&s;ition, or in the e&s;tima|tion of the world; and which is offered only as the re|pre&s;entative of &s;pecie which does not actually exi&s;t, we may, without breach of candor, conclude, that the ca|lamity of &s;uch a people, and their final cata&s;trophe, as to public pro&s;perity, is founded in, and much accelerated by their own folly and madne&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is a wide difference between the principles of i&s;&s;uing a paper medium on a bank &s;tock, and i&s;&s;uing one on the common ideas and principles heretofore practi&s;ed upon in this country. The one is the repre|&s;entative of money actually depo&s;ited, and ready to be paid when called for, and the other is only the repre|&s;entative of an intention to pay by a future tax, when the people are willing to bear one. The former will always be equal to real money; the latter mu&s;t, as it al|ways has done, undergo a rapid depreciation.</P>
<P>SHOULD the government of the commonwealth erect a bank, they will never do it on the idea of i&s;&s;uing &s;ums larger than their capital &s;tock, and the &s;ums depo&s;ited for &s;afekeeping; becau&s;e, &s;o far as they di&s;pen&s;e with this principle, &s;o far they will in effect make a paper cur|rency upon the principles of public credit alone. While
<PB N="71" REF="024829_0070_0FCD674D6E8600F0">
this is concealed, if a depreciation &s;hall happen, it will not be confe&s;&s;ed, but pretended that demands for &s;pe|cie rai&s;e the price of gold and &s;ilver, and the articles of commerce may ri&s;e in their nominal value, but this ri&s;e will be a&s;cribed to a thou&s;and cau&s;es before it is charg|ed upon the true one.</P>
<P>BUT it will be a&s;ked, what benefit will re&s;ult from banking, if there can be no more money i&s;&s;ued in bills than there is actually depo&s;ited in &s;tock? The an&s;wer I make has been before repeated. The government can|not incorporate a &s;et, or number of men, with a gift of property, but may give them corporate powers to im|prove the property which they have in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or which they may acquire. By an act of incorporation they can loan their money with more ea&s;e, at le&s;s ex|pen&s;e, and with greater &s;ecurity, than they could do it in their private, natural capacities; and the advantages ari&s;ing from depo&s;its for &s;afekeeping, will be what would very lately have been called great enough to induce the undertaking.</P>
<P>THE government, by &s;uch an incorporation, can, from time to time, on all ca&s;es of &s;udden emergency, have aids of money without applying to any other gov|ernment, and by having one bank in which all the peo|ple have an intere&s;t, they will prevent the operation of applications which will otherwi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h a great va|riety of banks under different denominations; for if one a&s;&s;ociation is indulged with corporate powers, why &s;hould not another? And if the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts' bank
<PB N="72" REF="024829_0071_0FCD674EC8BE0598">
has a legal right to i&s;&s;ue one million of pounds lawful money in notes, and to draw &s;ix per centum per annum on that &s;um, when they may not have more than one half of it in their vault, why &s;hould not the a&s;&s;ociations for the tontine, and for the Salem bank, and all others who will a&s;&s;ociate for e&s;tabli&s;hing other funds in money, have the &s;ame privilege? And if the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts' bank has this enormous benefit, why &s;hould the Salem bank be incorporated under privileges inferior to theirs? What have the proprietors of that bank done for the public to purcha&s;e &s;o much preeminence and tho&s;e ex|clu&s;ive privileges? Why &s;hould the re&s;t of the citi|zens be under pains and penalties for taking more than &s;ix pounds for the loan of one hundred pounds for one year, and the&s;e men have a legal right to take twelve for theirs?</P>
<P>THESE are very &s;erious que&s;tions; the public mind la|bors with them, and if even the men intere&s;ted in this extraordinary &s;cheme, can an&s;wer them, it is high time it was done. The public expect a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of them, and are anxiou&s;ly waiting the event.</P>
<P>IF the abundance of the precious metals will forfeit their comparative value in the opinion of the world, how much more will a paper currency, repre&s;enting nothing but a credit, or a promi&s;e of money to be paid at &s;ome future day, lo&s;e its e&s;timated value, when it &s;hall be abundantly increa&s;ed? The gold and &s;ilver torn from the bowels of the earth, are of no more con&s;e|quence to the fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or than the corn or wheat pro|duced
<PB N="73" REF="024829_0072_0FCD6751A28E7750">
by labor is to the hu&s;bandman. The labor at|tending the taking the metals from the mines, and re|fining them, is hardly paid by the produce, unle&s;s the owner employs &s;laves in the &s;ervice; and the&s;e might be as profitably employed in agriculture.</P>
<P>THE idea of the people who want banks, is to &s;pring a mine of wealth without labor. They wi&s;h to draw double the income from their property by creating a bank, than could be obtained in any other way of im|provement. But the con&s;titution of our common|wealth, as well as that of the United States, contains a &s;olemn compact, that no man, or company of men, &s;hall have any legal exclu&s;ive right or privilege; and therefore, if a bank for the commonwealth is erected, the private &s;ub&s;cribers can have no privilege but what &s;hall ari&s;e from the &s;tock actually depo&s;ited, and from the money depo&s;ited for &s;ecurity and &s;afekeeping. The bank, therefore, will be compo&s;ed by proprietors who have &s;pecie which they wi&s;h to employ in that way, and not by men who wi&s;h to accumulate wealth by pe|culiar and exclu&s;ive advantages.</P>
<P>THE idea of a loan of money by banks to farmers upon mortgages of real e&s;tates, is inadmi&s;&s;ible. It was never attempted in any country, excepting in one in|&s;tance; I mean the land bank in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. That bubble was produced by the circulation of Law's &s;cheme in Paris. The intoxication occa&s;ioned by the method in which that plan was managed, made its way into Holland and England, and finally operated in the pro|vince
<PB N="74" REF="024829_0073_0FCD67537B81B808">
of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay. About the year thirty, a company was incorporated for the purpo&s;e, as was o&s;|ten&s;ibly held out, to encourage agriculture and manu|factures. Some of the greate&s;t men in the government were of the corporation, and the influence of it pervad|ed every thing. Elections were governed by it. The legi&s;lature was under its control, and its power was ex|ceeded by nothing but the misfortunes and calamities which were introduced by it. The notes i&s;&s;ued by the company could not be paid, becau&s;e the company had no funds for that purpo&s;e. There were monies due to them on mortgages, but that money could not be col|lected, and therefore the &s;ecurities were &s;old at a di&s;|count, and a rapid depreciation took place. A great variety of acts and laws were made in order to bring this bu&s;ine&s;s to a clo&s;e. The general import of them all was, to levy money from the private e&s;tates of the proprietors, to pay the debts due from the corporation; the la&s;t of the&s;e acts was made in 1759.</P>
<P>AFTER this, Apthorp and Wheelwright were engaged in a contract with, or under others, to &s;upply the Bri|ti&s;h army in America, and i&s;&s;ued notes on their own credit, ari&s;ing from their connection with the Briti&s;h trea&s;ury. But the&s;e very &s;oon began to go under par, and had but a very &s;hort run in commerce; the rea&s;on was very plain: if the money was ready, there was no need of notes; if the money was not ready, then the notes repre&s;ented credit only, and not money.</P>
<P>THERE was &s;omething plau&s;ible in the propo&s;ition of
<PB N="75" REF="024829_0074_0FCD6754F06CF900">
the <HI>tontine</HI> a&s;&s;ociation for loaning money to farmers on mortgages. They were either not &s;incere, or they were ignorant of the principles of banking. If a bank was to i&s;&s;ue no more notes than what would repre&s;ent the &s;pecie on hand, it could not be done on mortgages; becau&s;e, upon banking principles, the gold and &s;ilver is always &s;uppo&s;ed to be ready when called for; but when notes are made repre&s;enting &s;pecie, and yet de|pending upon monies ari&s;ing from mortgages for pay|ment, and delays are great, and an equity of redemp|tion of the lands mortgaged extended to the &s;pace of three years, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport the credit of the bank.</P>
<P>THE tontine a&s;&s;ociation were quite right, however, in making an application; they petitioned for no great|er privileges than had been granted to their fellow citi|zens by this and the general government; and they are unable now to di&s;cover the rea&s;on why one part of the people are thus di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other.</P>
<P>IF there are evils re&s;ulting from the multiplication of banks, and from &s;peculations in public &s;ecurities, tho&s;e evils ought to be avoided. But we are frequently told, that they will cure them&s;elves; the &s;ame may be &s;aid of all other natural, moral, and political evils; and if the argument proves any thing, it will prove that there is no need of providing any checks again&s;t wrong doers. Fevers generally cure them&s;elves by their own rage, if they do not de&s;troy the &s;ubject of them: but we do not conclude from thence, that there is no injury in a fever.

Conflagrations cea&s;e when the city is con&s;umed, but the di&s;tre&s;s of their operations remains in a la&s;ting ca|lamity. Moral evils cure them&s;elves frequently by bringing offenders to the halter; they are neverthele&s;s intolerable, becau&s;e they injure and di&s;tre&s;s the mem|bers of the community where they are perpetrated. The ob&s;ervation, that evils cure them&s;elves, is nigh akin to that of the &s;toics, that there is no evil at all: and not very di&s;tant in relation from the doctrine of univer|&s;al indi&s;criminate happine&s;s, as well to the wicked as to the righteous, in another &s;tate of exi&s;tence. Politi|cal evils cure them&s;elves; but they very frequently de|luge a country in blood in their progre&s;s, and frequent|ly leave a nation overborne with a heavy debt, if the li|berties of the people are pre&s;erved; and the widows and orphans of decea&s;ed patriots and warriors, are for a long time the numerous witne&s;&s;es of the preceding calamity.</P>
<P>OUR old paper money &s;chemes and public debt were evils, and they have cured them&s;elves; but not until they had placed it in the power of one part of the com|munity to make va&s;t e&s;tates upon the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and misfortunes of the other.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;urance that good may come out of evil, is no excu&s;e for doing wrong. Government ought to move uniformly, on fixed, rational, hone&s;t, and regular prin|ciples. It is intended to pre&s;erve the equal rights of all the citizens, and to protect the weak again&s;t the pow|erful, and the poor again&s;t the rich. But the&s;e impor|tant ends can never be accompli&s;hed where the mea|&s;ure
<PB N="77" REF="024829_0076_0FCD67594DFB44F8">
of wealth, and medium of trade, is un&s;teady and ca|pricious, or where the powers of government, by an un|due influence, are made &s;ub&s;ervient to the gratification or emolument of particular a&s;&s;ociations, or of individu+als in the civil community.</P>
<P>WHATEVER apologies may be formed by men in power, &s;atisfactory to their own con&s;ciences, from local &s;ituations, from examples in the &s;ame, or in any other government, or from the pre&s;&s;ure of men pur&s;u|ing their own intere&s;t&punc; yet there will be an hour when the&s;e can form no plea; a day, when what has been right, and what has been wrong, in morals and politics, will appear with an indi&s;putable certainty.</P>
