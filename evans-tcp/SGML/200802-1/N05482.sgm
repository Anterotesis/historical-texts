<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the Sake of Tho&s;e who live at a Di&s;tance and knew not the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>following Tracts,</HI> I would ob&s;erve; That he had his Education at <HI>Harvard-College,</HI> and &s;tudied <HI>Chymi&s;try</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> under his Uncle the Learned Dr. <HI>James Oliver</HI> of <HI>Cambridge;</HI> one of the mo&s;t e&s;teemed <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> in his Day; who had a &s;ingular Help in the Art of Chymi&s;try by the ingenious Dr. <HI>Lodowick</HI> a <HI>Ger|man,</HI> who was al&s;o accounted an excellent <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> and the mo&s;t &s;kilful <HI>Chymi&s;t</HI> that ever came into the&s;e Parts of <HI>Ame|rica.</HI> And Dr. <HI>Williams</HI> lived and practiced in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> with great Succe&s;s and Reputation for near <HI>thirty &s;even</HI> Years, to the Time of his <HI>Death,</HI> which was on <HI>Jan.</HI> 10. 1737, 8, in the 63d Year of his Age.</P>
<P>He was well vers'd in the mo&s;t valued <HI>Authors,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e who wrote on <HI>Experimental Ca&s;es,</HI> carefully comparing them with <HI>his own Ob&s;ervations.</HI> He made the Ca&s;e of his Patients as his own: and where he apprehended Danger, ap|plied him&s;elf with great Concern and Diligence, and &s;eem'd to bear them on his Mind continually. In &s;ome Ca&s;es he has con&s;ulted with Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> and <HI>other principal Phy&s;icians</HI> in <HI>England</HI> for Advice and Help.</P>
<P>In every thing he was exceeding <HI>Cautious;</HI> e&s;pecially in the Preparation of his <HI>more important Medicines</HI> for his own Practice, that he might more &s;urely judge of their Operati|ons: And his e&s;tabli&s;hed Character for Piety, Skill and Cau|tion, made his Patients entirely &s;atisfied in all his Manage|ments.</P>
<P><PB REF="006947_0003_102AD1C55DABFE38">
It was his Method to reduce to <HI>Writing</HI> the <HI>more remarka|ble Ca&s;es</HI> with the various Symptoms occuring, and the Cour&s;e he took; that he might form his own Practice in like Ca&s;es afterwards. And by this Means we are favoured with the <HI>following Tracts;</HI> which appear to be wrote with great Judgment and Conci&s;ene&s;s; tho' without the lea&s;t Thought of their being ever publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The <HI>former</HI> Part &s;eems to have been drawn up for <HI>&s;ome &s;pecial Friend,</HI> by Way of Direction; the <HI>latter</HI> is a <HI>more par|ticular Account</HI> of <HI>his own Practice,</HI> in which the <HI>Pre&s;criptions</HI> are here rendred into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for their being of more exten&s;ive U&s;e.</P>
<P>I hope this will &s;uffice to recommend them to tho&s;e who were not acquainted with him: for as to tho&s;e who knew him, I apprehend it needle&s;s.</P>
<P>In the little Knowledge I have of <HI>Phy&s;ical Authors</HI> and of <HI>this Di&s;temper,</HI> I cannot but judge <HI>the&s;e &s;mall Tracts</HI> of <HI>great Value.</HI> And as my divine and merciful MASTER declared, that He came not to de&s;troy Men's Lives, but to &s;ave them; and in tender Pity to all about Him, and a perfect Con&s;i&s;t|ence with his &s;aving Office, employed his Power to <HI>heal</HI> their <HI>bodily</HI> as well as <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Maladies: I cannot but judge it con&s;i&s;tent with my <HI>Imitation</HI> of Him, to promote the Publi&s;h|ing <HI>this excellent Method</HI> of <HI>Healing,</HI> and recommend it to all around me. And in Hopes of its being a Mean in his Hand of &s;aving the Lives of many, e&s;pecially in our <HI>Coun|try Towns,</HI> as well as in <HI>This</HI> where the <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> have not <HI>now</HI> Time to attend <HI>all</HI> the Sick; I humbly commit it to his &s;overeign Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>

<HEAD>General RULES to be ob&s;erved.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHen the Air is infected</HI> and <HI>Danger ari&s;es</HI> from thence&mdash;</P>

<P><HI>To guard again&s;t the Infection</HI> and <HI>render the Di&s;temper more favourable</HI> when it &s;eizes; Let a <HI>Scruple</HI> of <HI>Brim&s;tone</HI> very finely powder'd be taken twice a Day; fir&s;t in the <HI>Morning,</HI> and about &s;ix o'Clock at <HI>Night,</HI> in a <HI>Spoonful</HI> of <HI>Water;</HI> and drink after it 40 <HI>Drops</HI> of <HI>Elixir Proprietatis</HI> in a Gla&s;s of <HI>Water,</HI> or any generous <HI>Wine;</HI> or where <HI>that</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the <HI>Elixir.</HI></NOTE> can't be ob|tain'd, let a Gla&s;s of <HI>Cyder</HI> with <HI>Rue</HI> and <HI>Gentian</HI> &s;teep'd in it be taken in its Stead.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>When the Symptoms</HI> of the <HI>Small Pox appear</HI> (which are very various, Pains in the Head, Back, Limbs, Stomach, Belly, Sickne&s;s &amp;c. with a Fever, which always accompanies what ever other Symptoms there are.)</P>
<P>If <HI>now</HI> there be any Signs of a <HI>foul Stomach,</HI> or its being <HI>clogg'd with Phlegm;</HI> Let there be a <HI>Vomit</HI> given <HI>as &s;oon as may</HI> be <HI>before the Eruption</HI> or Appearance of the Pock. When it has done working, let &s;omething <HI>Cordial</HI> be given, as <HI>Mint-water</HI> &s;weetned with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron;</HI> or a <HI>Toa&s;t</HI> and <HI>Canary Wine.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006947_0005_102AD1C9F08E9A60">
Let the <HI>Blood</HI> be now well diluted with &s;ome <HI>&s;mall Tea</HI> made of <HI>Baum, Sage,</HI> or <HI>any other temperate Herb;</HI> which let be &s;weetned with <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron,</HI> &amp; given 3 or 4 Times a Day 'till the Pock is all out. <HI>Small Beer</HI> with a <HI>Toa&s;t,</HI> or <HI>Fair Water</HI> with a <HI>Toa&s;t,</HI> may be allowed now and then, if de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P><HI>To bring out the Pock,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary that there be <HI>&s;ome Fever</HI> which mu&s;t carefully be minded: If <HI>too high,</HI> it mu&s;t be <HI>&s;uppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> and nothing mu&s;t be allowed but what is <HI>cooling;</HI> if <HI>too low,</HI> it mu&s;t be <HI>rai&s;ed</HI> by warm <HI>Cordials,</HI> 'till the Heat of the Fle&s;h be &s;omething beyond what is common: but yet great Care mu&s;t be taken that it be not rai&s;ed too high.

<P>If there happen a FLUX, <HI>before Eruption</HI> (or <HI>at any other Time;</HI>) Let it be <HI>immediately &s;top'd</HI> by a <HI>Drahm</HI> of <HI>Dia&s;cordiam</HI> in <HI>Mint-Water;</HI> which may be repeated once in &s;ix Hours, if Need be.</P>

However, if it be <HI>moderate,</HI> it may be &s;erviceable; and therefore <HI>not to be &s;top'd too &s;oon.</HI> The <HI>&s;ame</HI> may be &s;aid of <HI>Bleeding</HI> at the <HI>No&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When the Eruption is over,</HI> which is generally in 3, or 4 Days at farthe&s;t;&mdash;Let the <HI>&s;ame Rules</HI> be ob&s;erved about the <HI>Drink</HI> as before.

<P><HI>If the Pock do not grow and fill</HI> by the <HI>forementioned Regi|men;</HI> Let a <HI>handful of Sheeps-Dung</HI> be &s;teeped in <HI>hot Water</HI> 3 or 4 <HI>Hours,</HI> and then &s;train'd off, and be given to the Quan|tity

<P><HI>If the Throat be &s;ore;</HI> gargle it with <HI>Water</HI> &s;weetned with <HI>Honey</HI> of <HI>Ro&s;es;</HI> or hold in the Mouth a little <HI>Con&s;erve</HI> of <HI>Ro&s;es</HI> made a little tart with <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Vitriol;</HI> or a little <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Black-berries,</HI> or <HI>Srawberries,</HI> or <HI>Mulberries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If the Urine be &s;top'd,</HI> as it many Times is; Let the Per&s;on be rai&s;ed up: and if that do not an&s;wer, let him take a <HI>De|coction</HI> of <HI>Pompion</HI> and <HI>Par&s;ley-Seed</HI> for his <HI>Drink,</HI> 'till he be relieved.</P>
<P>Let the <HI>Food</HI> be <HI>Oatmeal-Caudle, Milk-porrage, Sack-whey;</HI> the one or the other, according as the <HI>Fever</HI> allows.</P>
<P><HI>If there be a Flux or loo&s;e Body;</HI> boil'd <HI>Rice</HI> may be eaten, and the <HI>Water</HI> of it drank: or the white <HI>Decoction</HI> made of <HI>Burnt-Hart&s;horn</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;ket,</HI> of each <HI>an Ounce</HI> boil'd in <HI>two Quarts</HI> of Water, 'till a Pint be con&s;umed; let the <HI>Dregs</HI> be poured out with the re&s;t in a Ve&s;&s;el wherein it is kept; and when it is drank, let it always be <HI>&s;tirred up</HI> 'till it looks <HI>thick</HI> like Milk.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>When they come to turn,</HI> which is on the 7th or 9th Day commonly after Eruption; Let <HI>Cordials</HI> be often given, and a more <HI>cordial Diet</HI> be allowed.</P>
<P><HI>If the Phlegm be tough or vi&s;cid,</HI> and <HI>Rai&s;ing &s;top'd;</HI> Let it be thinned by a little <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Vinegar</HI> made with <HI>Honey;</HI> or a <HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Urine,</HI> made with two <HI>Spoonfuls</HI> of <HI>Urine</HI> and one of Honey, with a little Nutmeg.</P>
<P><HI>If there be any Signs of an approaching Fever upon the Turn|ing of the Pock,</HI> or <HI>the Per&s;on be delirious;</HI> Let there be <HI>&s;trong Attractives</HI> to the <HI>Feet,</HI> and a <HI>Bli&s;ter</HI> to the <HI>Neck,</HI> and <HI>Arms</HI> al&s;o if Need be; which mu&s;t be <HI>kept, running,</HI> 'till the Dan|ger is over.</P>
<P><HI>If the &s;econdary Fever ari&s;es;</HI> it mu&s;t be treated like a <HI>com|mon putrid Fever.</HI> The <HI>Bal&s;am</HI> of <HI>Fennel</HI> in <HI>Fountain</HI> Water excels here.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006947_0007_102AD1CF50EB0248">
<HI>When the Pock is thoroughly turned;</HI> the Body may be kept open with a loo&s;ning Diet of <HI>Plumb-porrage,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>If a Fever ari&s;es or is heightned</HI> for want of a Stool; a <HI>Suppo&s;itor</HI> or <HI>Cli&s;ter</HI> may be us'd of <HI>Milk &amp; Sugar.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Medical Ob&s;ervations on the SMALL-POX. Anno 1730.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Method</HI> I took in treating this Di&s;temper; and which I found <HI>mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful,</HI> was as follows:</P>
<P>I advi&s;ed my <HI>Patients,</HI> for whom I thought I &s;hould be concerned, to <HI>Temperance</HI> in all Things, as the <HI>be&s;t Preparation</HI> for the Small-Pox; and to take <HI>Morning</HI> &amp; <HI>Evening</HI> 20 or 30 <HI>Drops</HI> of <HI>my Small-Pox Drops;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A <HI>Tincture</HI> drawn from <HI>Sulphur,</HI> to which add, <HI>Elixir Pro|prietatis,</HI> &s;o as to make a plea&s;ant Mixture.</NOTE> or where tho&s;e will not go down, 30 or 40 <HI>Drops</HI> of <HI>Elixir Proprietatis</HI> This Me|thod I found in many In&s;tances both this Year &amp; in 1721, <HI>very &s;ucce&s;sful</HI> to render the Di&s;temper <HI>favourable.</HI> Tho&s;e who were <HI>con&s;tant</HI> in taking it, I ob&s;erved <HI>e&s;caped a long Time</HI> before they were &s;eized, and had generally the mo&s;t favourable Sort and <HI>many e&s;caped it altogether</HI> without any Complaint, tho' greatly expo&s;ed. I found al&s;o a <HI>Scruple</HI> of <HI>Flower of Brim&s;tone,</HI> in <HI>Milk</HI> or <HI>any Vehicle,</HI> to an&s;wer this End very well, taken <HI>once,</HI> or <HI>twice a Day.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="stage of illness">
<HEAD>Before the Eruption.</HEAD>
<P>When the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of this Di&s;temper appeared, if they were favourable, I did little or nothing, but advi&s;ed to dilute the Blood with &s;ome <HI>&s;mall Tea</HI> of <HI>Baum,</HI> or <HI>what plea&s;ed the Appetite;</HI> and keep to a Diet of <HI>Water-Gruel</HI> for Food; <HI>Milk</HI> one Part, and <HI>Water</HI> three Parts, boil'd together for Drink; and <HI>wait</HI> for the <HI>Eruption:</HI> which if it <HI>appeared not the third Day.</HI> I endeavoured to promote, with this Mixture,</P>
<P><HI>Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron</HI> 1 Ounce, <HI>Treacle Water</HI> half an Ounce, <HI>Carduus Water</HI> 2 Ounces, mixt, 3 or 4 Spoonfuls for a Do&s;e: To be repeated once in &s;ix Hours; ob&s;erving in the mean time to drink <HI>plentifully</HI> of <HI>&s;mall Tea</HI> or <HI>Milk and Water.</HI></P>
<P>If there were any <HI>Signs of a foul Stomach;</HI> I gave a <HI>Vomit</HI> as <HI>&s;oon as I had Opportunity, before the Eruption:</HI> and I &s;cru|pled not to give it even <HI>when the Eruption was made,</HI> where the <HI>Signs</HI> of <HI>Foulne&s;s</HI> were manife&s;t. For want of the Help
<PB N="6" REF="006947_0009_102AD1D4C460A2D0">
of this, I found great Danger ari&s;ing, and a Nece&s;&s;ity often times to give it, even at the very Height of the Di&s;temper. I never gave any but <HI>Ipecacuanha,</HI> for fear of over-working, and weakning my Patient; who had now a dangerous Di&s;tem|per to go thro', that <HI>required the greate&s;t Strength</HI> to carry him thro'.</P>
<P>If there were <HI>great Fulne&s;s of Blood, Aptne&s;s to Bleed at the No&s;e.</HI> or <HI>Blood</HI> over-heat with <HI>Drinking,</HI> or its Pa&s;&s;ages ob|&s;tructed with taking <HI>Cold;</HI> in the&s;e Ca&s;es I opened a <HI>Vein,</HI> and took away 8 or 10 <HI>Ounces</HI> of <HI>Blood:</HI> This I found a good <HI>Preparatory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In Ca&s;e of Delirium</HI> or <HI>ob&s;tructed Men&s;es;</HI> I cho&s;e to <HI>bleed</HI> in the <HI>Feet.</HI></P>
<P>After the Bleeding was over, I endeavoured to promote a Breathing with &s;ome <HI>&s;mall Tea;</HI> which much facilitated the Eruption.</P>
<P>Sometimes <HI>before the Eruption,</HI> I have found <HI>exce&s;&s;ive Vo|miting:</HI> This I endeavoured to carry off by a <HI>Vomit,</HI> if there appeared any <HI>Symptoms</HI> of <HI>Foulne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Stomach:</HI> if not, I endeavoured to &s;ettle it by an <HI>Anodyne</HI> in &s;ome <HI>Alexiphar|mic Julep,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P><HI>Mint Water, Black Cherry Water,</HI> of each 2 <HI>Oz. Epidemic Water, Syrup</HI> of <HI>Saffron,</HI> of each half an Oz. <HI>Liquid Lauda|num</HI> 15 Drops, more or le&s;s, according to the Age of the Patient; 3 or 4 Spoonfuls for a Do&s;e, and repeated if Occa|&s;ion required. This often an&s;wered the Intention of Nature: which was now &s;trugling with the Malignity fix'd upon the Nerves of the Stomach, and threw it out to the Skin, which was the Thing aimed at.</P>
<P>If there were a <HI>Coma</HI> or <HI>Delirium,</HI> or <HI>Raving,</HI> if there were <HI>no Signs</HI> of <HI>Overfulne&s;s</HI> of the Blood, or Humours of the Body, or Foulne&s;s of <HI>the Stomach;</HI> I now judged the&s;e Symptoms to ari&s;e from the variolous Matter fixed on the <HI>Nerves;</HI> and did little to remove them, but only <HI>diluted</HI> the <HI>Blood,</HI> and gave &s;ome <HI>gentle Alexipharmic:</HI> and if they remained <HI>ob&s;ti|nate.</HI> I applied <HI>Attractives</HI> to the <HI>Feet;</HI> and <HI>Bli&s;ters</HI> to the <HI>Wri&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Ankles;</HI> and if Need required, behind the <HI>Ears:</HI> This I found mo&s;t commonly to &s;ucceed.</P>

<P><HI>Bleeding at the No&s;e</HI> often happened, and that to a very great Degree. This I endeavoured <HI>not to &s;top</HI> 'till it <HI>fainted</HI> the Patient.

I found a <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of ob&s;erving <HI>this Difference</HI> in treating my Patients.

<P>As to the <HI>Confluent</HI>&mdash;I found a Nece&s;&s;ity of watching this carefully and varying as the Symptoms directed.

<P>I &s;aw <HI>no</HI> Need of making the <HI>Inci&s;ions large</HI> or <HI>deep,</HI> or putting <HI>much</HI> of the Matter in; having found upon Trial, the <HI>lea&s;t Inci&s;ions</HI> if deep enough to make the <HI>Blood come,</HI> to an&s;wer as well as the large&s;t; and the very <HI>lea&s;t Part</HI> of Matter to an&s;wer as well as a <HI>great deal.</HI></P>

If the Inci&s;ions are <HI>not</HI> dre&s;&s;ed <HI>twice a Day</HI> at lea&s;t, and &s;ometimes <HI>three Times;</HI> when they come to run much, they are very apt to be <HI>much inflamed;</HI> and I have &s;een a <HI>Morti|fication</HI> &s;oon gather. When the Inci&s;ions do <HI>not</HI> run well; I fear a <HI>trouble&s;ome</HI> and <HI>full Pock,</HI> and have often &s;een many <HI>Swellings</HI> to ari&s;e about the <HI>Arm</HI> e&s;pecially; which if taken in Time would quickly yield to a <HI>Poultice</HI> of <HI>white Bread and Milk</HI> better than any Thing el&s;e; and when <HI>tho&s;e</HI> are gone, <HI>others</HI> to ari&s;e and create much Trouble.</P>
<P>I always ob&s;erved the <HI>Inci&s;ions</HI> to run <HI>much</HI> at the <HI>Turning,</HI> and more <HI>now</HI> than at any Time el&s;e.</P>
<P>I <HI>never</HI> endeavoured to <HI>&s;top</HI> the Running of the <HI>Inci&s;ions</HI> by Re&s;tringents; but continued in the Dre&s;s of <HI>Ba&s;ilicon</HI> or <HI>Liniment: Areaei,</HI> with the <HI>Plai&s;ter</HI> over it; and with <HI>this Dre&s;s</HI> I encouraged them to Dre&s;s, 'till they run exceedingly.</P>
<P>When there appeared a <HI>large Sinus</HI> all round under the Skin; be not forward to cut it, but dre&s;s it carefully by filling it full of <HI>fre&s;h white Break and Milk.</HI> This I have &s;een cure a <HI>very large one,</HI> in which I could carry my Finger clear round half an Inch under the Skin. If it mu&s;t be cut, dre&s;s it with a little <HI>Liniment:</HI> with a <HI>few Grains</HI> of <HI>Mercurius Dulcis,</HI> and wa&s;h it with <HI>Lime Water.</HI></P>
<P>I found the more the <HI>Inci&s;ions run,</HI> the more favourable the Pock and all the Symptoms were. I therefore encou|raged the <HI>Running</HI> as much as I could: but <HI>not</HI> by <HI>corro&s;ive, pungent</HI> Plai&s;ters, as <HI>Hat<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;e</HI> &amp;c; but only by <HI>Ba&s;ilicon, Lini|ment: Areaei, Cabbage-Leaf</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t trouble&s;ome Symptoms of <HI>Fever, Coma,</HI> and <HI>Tumours</HI> in the <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Glandulus Parts,</HI> was in a Negro Girl; who&s;e <HI>Inci&s;ion</HI> run but very <HI>little.</HI> I gave lit|tle or no Medicine, 'till the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of the Small Pox appeared, but <HI>Elixir Proprietatis,</HI> which I order'd to be drank often in Water; and to ab&s;tain from <HI>Meat;</HI> and to live upon a <HI>&s;moothing, diluting Diet.</HI></P>
<P>When I &s;aw the <HI>Spmptoms</HI> of the Small Pox beginning, I was very watchful to ob&s;erve them. If the <HI>Fever, Pains,</HI> and <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> were <HI>favourable;</HI> I cho&s;e to do nothing, but <HI>leave the Work to Nature.</HI> If the <HI>Fever</HI> was <HI>very high;</HI> I cho&s;e to lower it with a <HI>cooling diluting</HI> Diet, of <HI>Milk and Water, Water</HI> with a <HI>Toa&s;t</HI> in it, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="006947_0019_102AD1EC1CC7B0E8">
I <HI>never</HI> yet &s;aw a Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Bleeding</HI> any of my Pa|tients, but <HI>one;</HI> who had taken <HI>cold,</HI> and thereby fix'd a <HI>great Pain</HI> in his <HI>Side.</HI> Neither did I ever ob&s;erve any Advan|tage by <HI>Bleeding,</HI> but the contrary. The <HI>Pock</HI> was <HI>retarded,</HI> and the <HI>Patient</HI> much weakned.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Fever</HI> continued 'till the <HI>third Day</HI> of Complaint, and no <HI>Eruption</HI> appeared; I applied <HI>Bli&s;ters,</HI> which an&s;wered for the mo&s;t Part to draw forth the Pock, and abate the Fever; and if Need required, <HI>Attractives</HI> to the <HI>Feet.</HI> If there were any Signs of <HI>Foulne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Stomach,</HI> I gave a <HI>Vomit</HI> of <HI>Ipecacuanha.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes <HI>Convul&s;ions</HI> aro&s;e in <HI>Children</HI> before the Eruption, which went off them&s;elves, or with <HI>Bli&s;ters &amp; Attractives</HI> to the <HI>Feet.</HI> Sometimes they lay <HI>comatous</HI> and <HI>re&s;tle&s;s,</HI> which I relieved by <HI>Bli&s;ters &amp; Alexipharmic Julep<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> to drive out the Pu&s;tules. When once the <HI>Eruption</HI> was made, the <HI>trouble&s;ome Symptoms</HI> went off for the mo&s;t Part. However I endeavour|ed by &s;ome <HI>gentle Alexipharmic Julep</HI> to forward the Growth and Ripening of the Pock. I found <HI>little Need</HI> of <HI>Anodynes:</HI> tho' if they were <HI>very &s;ore</HI> and <HI>re&s;tle&s;s,</HI> I always gave them. If they were <HI>very full</HI> of the Pock, I treated them in all Re&s;pects as in the <HI>common Small Pox.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>mo&s;t of my Patients</HI> were <HI>very favourably</HI> dealt with: more than 50 out of 65; were &s;itting up and walking about the Room &s;oon after the Eruption was well made.</P>
<P><HI>But one died</HI> that I inoculated: which was a <HI>Child</HI> 8 <HI>Weeks old,</HI> and under the Di&s;advantage of <HI>lo&s;ing a full Brea&s;t,</HI> and put to <HI>one</HI> that was <HI>very di&s;agreable before</HI> to the Child, and <HI>now much more</HI> &s;o by the <HI>Di&s;tre&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> (who was the Mother) not only with <HI>that</HI> Child but with <HI>three more</HI> Chil|dren in the &s;ame Room. The Pock had its Cour&s;e <HI>favoura|bly enough;</HI> appear'd the 9th <HI>Day,</HI> and turned the 15th: but the <HI>Bowels</HI> fill'd daily with <HI>Wind,</HI> for want of proper <HI>Nou|ri&s;hment,</HI> and at length threw the Child into <HI>Convul&s;ions,</HI> of which it died on the 22d. <HI>Two</HI> more were <HI>very full</HI> but <HI>not dangerous. One</HI> had a <HI>flat Pock;</HI> which was al&s;o <HI>full,</HI> and did not turn 'till the <HI>ninth Day;</HI> followed with hard <HI>Tumours</HI> in the <HI>Arms</HI> for many Days, which were all di&s;&s;ipated with the <HI>white Bread Poultice</HI> only.</P>
