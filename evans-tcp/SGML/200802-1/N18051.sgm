Nor is the &s;ubtle air le&s;s obedient to thy power; whether thou wille&s;t it to be a mini&s;ter to our plea&s;ure, or utility.

NOR does thy empire end in &s;ubjects thus inanimate: Its power al&s;o extends through the various race of animals; who, either patiently &s;ubmit to become thy &s;laves, or are &s;ure to find thee an irre&s;i&s;tible foe. The faithful dog, the patient ox, the gene|rous hor&s;e, and the mighty elephant, are content, all, to receive their in&s;tructions from thee, and readily to lend their natural in&s;tincts or &s;trength, to perform tho&s;e offi|ces, which thy occa&s;ions call for.

<HEAD>IN PRAISE OF VIRTUE.</HEAD>
<P N="30">30. VIRTUE is of intrin&s;ic value and good de&s;ert, and of indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation; not the creature of will, but nece&s;&s;ary and im|mutable; not local or temporary, but of equal extent and antiquity with the divine mind; not a mode of &s;en&s;ation, but ever|la&s;ting truth; not dependent on power, but the guide of all power.</P>
<P N="31"><PB N="126" REF="023387_0128_0FBF6822FB864800">31. VIRTUE is the foundation of honor and e&s;teem; and the &s;ource of all beauty, order, and happine&s;s in nature. It is what confers value on all the other endowments and qualities of a rea&s;onable being, to which they ought to be ab&s;olutely &s;ub&s;ervient, and without which the more eminent they are, the more hideous deformities, and the greater cur&s;es they become. The u&s;e of it is not confined to any one &s;tage of our exi&s;tence, or to any particular &s;ituation we may be in, but reaches through all the periods and cir|cum&s;tances of our beings.</P>
<P N="32">32. MANY of the endowments and talents we now po&s;&s;e&s;s, and of which we are too apt to be proud, will cea&s;e entirely with the pre&s;ent &s;tate; but this will be our ornament and dignity in every future &s;tate to which we may be removed. Beauty and wit will die, learning will vani&s;h away, and all the arts of life be &s;oon forgot; but virtue will re|main for ever.</P>
<P N="33">33. THIS unites us to the whole rational creation, and fits us for conver&s;ing with any order of &s;uperior natures, and for a place in any part of God's works. It procures us the approbation and love of all wi&s;e and good beings, and renders them our allies and friends.&mdash;But what is of un&s;peakably greater con&s;equence is, that it makes God our friend, a&s;&s;imilates and unites our minds to his, and
<PB N="127" REF="023387_0129_0FBF682B0F295518">
engages his almighty power in our defence: Superior beings of all ranks are bound by it no le&s;s than our&s;elves. It has the &s;ame au|thority in all worlds that it has in this. The farther any being is advanced in excellence and perfection, the greater is his attachment to it, and the more he is under its influence. To &s;ay no more, it is the law of the whole univer&s;e; it &s;tands fir&s;t in the e&s;timation of the Deity; its original is his nature; and it is the very object that makes him lovely.</P>
<P N="34">34. Such is the importance of virtue&mdash;Of what con&s;equence, therefore, is it, that we practi&s;e it! there is no argument or motive, which is at all fitted to influence a rea&s;on|able mind, which does not call us to this.&mdash; One virtuous di&s;po&s;ition of &s;oul is preferable to the greate&s;t natural accompli&s;hments and abilities, and of more value than all the trea&s;ures of the world. If you are wi&s;e, then &s;tudy virtue, and contemn every thing that can come in competition with it. Remem|ber, that nothing el&s;e de&s;erves one anxious thought or wi&s;h. Remember, that this alone is honor, glory, wealth, and happine&s;s. Se|cure this, and you &s;ecure every thing; lo&s;e this, and all is lo&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>ON GENEROSITY.</HEAD>
<P N="44">44. I CONSIDER a generous mind as the noble&s;t work of the creation, and am per&s;uaded, wherever it re&s;ides no real merit can be wanting. It is, perhaps, the mo&s;t &s;ingular of all the moral endowments: I am &s;ure, at lea&s;t, it is often imputed where it cannot ju&s;tly be claimed. The meane&s;t &s;elf-love, under &s;ome di&s;gui&s;e, frequently pa&s;&s;es upon common ob&s;ervers for this god-like principle; and I have known many a popu|lar action attributed to this motive, when it

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owed from no higher a &s;ource than the &s;ug|ge&s;tions of concealed vanity, good nature; as it hath many features in common with this virtue, is u&s;ually mi&s;taken for it: The former, however, is but the effect, po&s;&s;ibly, of a happy di&s;po&s;ition of the animal &s;tructure, or, as Dryden calls it, of a certain "milki|ne&s;s of blood;" whereas the latter is &s;eated in the mind, and can never &s;ub&s;i&s;t where good &s;en&s;e, and enlarged &s;entiments, have no exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="45">45. IT is entirely founded upon ju&s;tne&s;s of thought, which, perhaps, is the rea&s;on this virtue is &s;o little the characteri&s;tic of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nkind in general; a man who&s;e mind is warped by the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, or contracted by the narrow prejudices of &s;ects or parties, if he does not want hone&s;ty, mu&s;t undoubt|edly want under&s;tanding.

<P N="46">46. IT is the di&s;tingui&s;hing pre-eminence of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, that it cheri&s;hes this elevated principle in one of its noble&s;t exer|tions. Forgivene&s;s of injuries, I confe&s;s, in|deed, has been inculcated by &s;everal of the Heathen morali&s;ts; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> never entered into the e&s;tabli&s;hed ordinances of any religion, until it had the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ction of the great author

of ours. I have often, however, wondered that the ancients, who rai&s;ed &s;o many vir|tues and affections of the mind into divini|ties, &s;hould never have given a place in their temples to genero&s;ity; unle&s;s, perhaps, they included it under the notion of <HI>fides,</HI> or <HI>ho|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI>&punc; But &s;urely &s;he might rea&s;onably have claimed a &s;eparate alter and &s;uperior rites.</P>
<P N="47">47.

True genero&s;ity ri&s;es above the ordinary rules of &s;ocial conduct, and flows with much too full a &s;tream to be com|prehended within the preci&s;e marks of formal precepts. It is a vigorous principle in the &s;oul, which opens and expands all her vir|tues far beyond tho&s;e which are only the forced and unnatural productions of a timed obedience. The man who is influenced &s;ingly by motives of the latter kind, aims no higher than at certain authoritative &s;tandards, with|out ever attempting to reach tho&s;e glo|rious elevations which con&s;titute the only true heori&s;m of the &s;ocial character.</P>

<P N="64">64. LIFE is &s;hort and uncertain; we have not a moment to lo&s;e. Is it prudent to throw away any of our time, in tormenting our&s;elves or others, when we have &s;o little for hone&s;t plea&s;ures? Forgetting our weak|ne&s;s, we &s;tir up mighty enmities, and fly to wound as if we were invulnerable. Where|fore all this bu&s;tle and noi&s;e! The be&s;t u&s;e of a &s;hort life is, to make it agreeable to our&s;elves, and to others. Have you cau&s;e of quarrel with your &s;ervant, your ma&s;ter, your king, your neighbour? Forbear a moment, death is at hand, which makes all equal. What has man to do with wars, tumults, ambu&s;hes? You would de&s;troy your enemy? You lo&s;e your trouble; death will do your bu&s;ine&s;s while you are at re&s;t. And after all, when you have got your revenge, how &s;hort will be your joy, or his pain? While we are among men, let us cultivate humanity, let us not be the cau&s;e of fear nor of pain to one another. Let us de&s;pi&s;e injury, malice, and detraction; and bear with an equal mind &s;uch tran&s;itory evils. While we &s;peak, while we think, death comes up, and clo&s;es the &s;cene.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the <HI>SCRIPTURES</HI> as the <HI>RULE</HI> of <HI>LIFE.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1 AS you advance in years and under|&s;tanding, I hope you will be able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne for your&s;elf the evidences of the chri&s;tian religion; and that you will be con|vinced, on rational grounds, of its divine au|thority. At pre&s;ent &s;uch enquiries would demand more &s;tudy, and greater power of rea&s;oning, than your age admits of.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is your part, therefore, until you are capable of under&s;tanding the proofs, to be|lieve your parents and teachers, that the Holy Scriptures are writings in&s;pired by God, containing a true hi&s;tory of facts, in which we are deeply concerned&mdash;a true recital of the laws given by God to Mo&s;es, and of the precepts of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Savior, de|livered
<PB N="169" REF="023387_0171_0FBF68AB3097AAB0">
from his own mouth to his di&s;ciples, and repeated and enlarged upon in the edi|fying epi&s;tles of his Apo&s;tles&mdash;who were men cho&s;en from among&s;t tho&s;e who had the ad|vantage of conver&s;ing with our Lord, to bear witne&s;s of his miracles and re&s;urrection; and who, after his a&s;cen&s;ion, were a&s;&s;i&s;ted and in&s;pired by the Holy Gho&s;t. This &s;acred volume mu&s;t be the rule of our life. In it you will find all truths nece&s;&s;ary to be be|lieved, and plain and ea&s;y directions for the practice of every duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. YOUR bible, then, mu&s;t be your chief &s;tudy and delight: but as it contains <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">any various kinds of writing, &s;ome parts ob&s;cure and difficult of interpretation, others plain and intelligible to the meane&s;t capacity, I would chiefly recommend to your frequent peru&s;al, &s;uch parts of the &s;acred writings as are mo&s;t adapted to your under&s;tanding, and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for your in&s;truction.</P>
<P N="4">4. OUR Saviour's precepts were &s;poken to the common people among the Jews; and were therefore given in a manner ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, and equally &s;triking and in|&s;tructive to the learned and unlearned; for the mo&s;t ignorant may comprehend them, whil&s;t the wi&s;e&s;t mu&s;t be charmed and awed by the beautiful and maje&s;tic &s;implicity with which they are expre&s;&s;ed. Of the &s;ame kind
<PB N="170" REF="023387_0172_0FBF68B1E2BC49C8">
are the Ten Commandments, delivered by God to Mo&s;es; which, as they were de&s;igned for univer&s;al laws, are worded in the mo&s;t conci&s;e and &s;imple manner, yet with a ma|je&s;ty which commands our utmo&s;t reverence.</P>
<P N="5">5. I THINK you will receive great plea|&s;ure, as well as improvement, from the hi&s;to|rical books of the Old Te&s;tament; provided you read them as an hi&s;tory, in a regular cour&s;e, and keep the thread of it in your mind as you go on. I know of none, true or fictitious, that is equally wonderful, inte|re&s;ting and affecting; or that is told in &s;o &s;hort and &s;imple a manner as this, which is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l hi&s;tories the mo&s;t authentic.</P>
<P N="6">6. I SHALL give you &s;ome brief di|rections concerning the method and cour&s;e I wi&s;h you to pur&s;ue in reading the Holy Scriptures. May you be enabled to make the be&s;t u&s;e of this mo&s;t precious gift of God this &s;acred trea&s;ure of knowledge; may you read the bible, not as a ta&s;k, nor as the dull employment of that day only, in which you were forbidden more lively entertain|ments; but with a &s;incere and ardent de&s;ire of in&s;truction, with that love and delight in God's word, which the Holy P&s;almi&s;t &s;o pa|thetically felt and de&s;cribed, and which is the natural con&s;equence of loving God and virtue.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="171" REF="023387_0173_0FBF68B36BB76FD0">7.

<P N="4">4. THE &s;tory of Abraham's proceeding to &s;acrifice his only &s;on, at the command of God, is affecting in the highe&s;t degree; and &s;ets forth a pattern of unlimited re&s;ignation, that every one ought to imitate in tho&s;e tri|als of obedience under temptation, or of acquie&s;cence under afflicting di&s;pen&s;ations, which fall to their lot. Of this we may be a&s;&s;ured, that our trials will be always pro|portioned to the powers afforded us; if we have not Abraham's &s;trength of mind, nei|ther &s;hall we be called upon to lift the bloody knife again&s;t the bo&s;om of an only child; but, if the almighty arm &s;hould be lifted up again&s;t him, we mu&s;t be ready to re&s;ign him, and all we hold dear, to the divine will.</P>
<P N="5">5. THIS action of Abraham has been cen|&s;ured by &s;ome, who do not attend to the di&s;|tinction between obedience to a &s;pecial com|mand, and the dete&s;tably cruel &s;acrifices of the Heathens, who &s;ometimes voluntarily, and without any divine injunctions, offered up their own children, under the notion of ap|pea&s;ing the anger of their gods. An ab&s;o|lute command from God him&s;elf, as in the ca&s;e of Abraham, entirely alters the moral nature of the action; &s;ince he, and he on|ly,
<PB N="174" REF="023387_0176_0FBF68BE9EDD8128">
has a perfect right over the lives of his creatures, and may appoint whom he will, either Angel or Man, to be his in&s;trument of de&s;truction.</P>
<P N="6">6. THAT it was really the voice of God which pronounced the command, and not a delu&s;ion, might be made certain to Abraham's mind, by means we do not comprehend, but which we know to be within the power of him, who made our &s;ouls as well as bodies, and who can controul and direct every fa|culty of the human mind: and we may be a&s;&s;ured, that if he was plea&s;ed to reveal him|&s;elf &s;o miraculou&s;ly, he would not leave a po&s;&s;ibility of doubting, whether it was a real or an imaginary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation. Thus the &s;acri|fice of Abraham appears to be clear of all &s;uper&s;tition; and remains the noble&s;t in&s;tance of religious faith and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that was ever given by a mere man: we cannot wonder that the ble&s;&s;ings be&s;towed on him, extended to his po&s;terity.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE PROVERBS, ECCLESIAS|TES, SOLOMON's SONG, THE PROPHECIES, AND THE APO|CRYPHA.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE Proverbs and Eccle&s;ia&s;tes are rich &s;tores of wi&s;dom; from which I wi&s;h you to adopt &s;uch maxims as may be of infi|nite u&s;e both to your temporal and eternal intere&s;t. But detached &s;entences are a kind of reading not proper to be continued long at a time; a few of them, well cho&s;en and di|ge&s;ted, will do you much more &s;ervice than to read half a dozen chapters together. In this re&s;pect they are directly oppo&s;ite to the hi&s;torical books, which, if not read in con|tinuation, can hardly be under&s;tood or re|tained to any purpo&s;e.</P>

NEXT follow the prophecies; which, though highly de&s;erving the greate&s;t atten|tion and &s;tudy, I think you had better omit for &s;ome years, and then read them with a good expo&s;ition, as they are much too diffi|cult for you to under&s;tand without a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Dr. Newton on the prophecies will help you much, when ever you undertake this &s;tudy, which you &s;hould by all means do when your under&s;tanding is ripe enough; becau&s;e one of the main proofs of our religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the te&s;timony of the prophecies; and they are very frequently quoted, and referred to in the New-Te&s;tament; be&s;ides, the &s;ublimi|mity of the language and &s;entiments, through all the di&s;advantages of antiquity and tran&s;|lation, mu&s;t in very many pa&s;&s;ages, &s;trike every per&s;on of ta&s;te; and the excellent mo|ral and religious precepts found i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them, mu&s;t be u&s;eful to all.</P>

<PB N="189" REF="023387_0191_0FBF68E962929218">
care to ob&s;erve the chronology regularly, by refering to the index, which &s;upplies the de|ficiencies of this hi&s;tory from Jo&s;ephus's an|tiquities of the Jews. The fir&s;t of Macca|bees carries on the &s;tory until within 195 years of our Lord's circumci&s;ion: the &s;econd book of the &s;ame narrative is written by a different hand, and does not bring the hi&s;tory &s;o for|ward as the fir&s;t; &s;o that it may be entirely omitted, unle&s;s you have the curio&s;ity to read &s;ome particulars of the heroic con&s;tan|cy of the Jews under the tortures inflicted by their heathen conquerors, with a few other things, not mentioned in the fir&s;t book.</P>
<P N="5">5. YOU mu&s;t then connect the hi&s;tory by the help of the index, which will give you brief heads of the changes that happened in the &s;tate of the Jews from this time until the birth of the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>

THE other books of the Apocrypha, though not admitted as of &s;acred authority, have many things well worth your attention; particularly the admirable book called Ec|cle&s;ia&s;ticus, and the book of Wi&s;dom.

<P N="1">1. NEXT follow the Epi&s;tles, which make a very important part of the New Te&s;ta|ment; and you cannot be too much employed in reading them. They contain the mo&s;t excellent precepts and admonitions, and are of particular u&s;e in explaining more at large, &s;eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al doctrines of chri&s;tianity, which we could not &s;o fully comprehend without them.</P>
<P N="2">2. THERE are, indeed, in the Epi&s;tles of St. Paul, many pa&s;&s;ages hard to be under|&s;tood: &s;uch in particular are the fir&s;t eleven chapters to the Romans; the greater part of his Epi&s;tles to the Corinthians and Galatians, and &s;everal chapters of that to the Hebrews. In&s;tead of perplexing your&s;elf with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e more ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, I would wi&s;h you to employ your attention chiefly on tho&s;e that are plain; and to judge of the doctrine taught in the other parts, by com|paring them with what you find in the&s;e. It is through the neglect of this rule, that many have been led to draw the mo&s;t ab&s;urd doc|trines from the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P N="3">3. LET me particularly recommend to your careful peru&s;al, the xii, xiii, xiv, xv, chapters of the epi&s;tle to the Romans. In the xiv chapter, St. Paul has in view, the difference between the Jewi&s;h and Gentile (or

Heathen) converts, at that time: the former were di&s;po&s;ed to look with horror on the latter, for their impiety in not paying the &s;ame regard to the di&s;tinctions of days and meats that they did; and the latter, on the contrary, were inclined to look with con|tempt on the former, for their weakne&s;s and &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P N="4">4. EXCELLENT is the advice which the Apo&s;tle gives to both parties: he exhorts the Jewi&s;h converts not to judge, and the Gentiles not to de&s;pi&s;e; remembering, that the kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink, but righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t&mdash;Endeavor to conform your&s;elf to this advice, to acquire a temper of uni|ver&s;al candor and benevolence; and learn neither to de&s;pi&s;e nor condemn any per&s;ons on account of their particular modes of faith and wor&s;hip: remembering always, that goodne&s;s is confined to no party; that there are wi&s;e and worthy men among all the &s;ects of chri&s;tians; and that to his ma&s;ter, every one mu&s;t &s;tand or fall.</P>
<P N="5">5. I WILL enter no farther into the &s;eve|ral points di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by St. Paul in his various epi&s;tles; mo&s;t of them too intricate for your under&s;tanding at pre&s;ent, and many of them beyond my abilities to &s;tate clearly.

<HEAD>THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE Epi&s;tle of St. James is entirely practical, and exceedingly fine; you cannot &s;tudy it too much. It &s;eems particularly de&s;igned to guard chri&s;tians again&s;t mi&s;un|der&s;tanding &s;ome things in St. Paul's writ|ings, which have been fatally perverted to the encouragement of a dependence on faith alone, without good works. But the more rational commentators will tell you, that by the works of the law, which the Apo&s;tle a&s;|&s;erts to be incapable of ju&s;tifying us, he means not the works of moral righteou&s;ne&s;s, but the ceremonial works of the Mo&s;aic law, on which the Jews laid the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s as nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation. But St. James tells us, that "if any man among us &s;eem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that man's religion

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE redemption of man is one of the mo&s;t glorious works of the Almighty. If the hour of the creation of the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld was great and illu&s;trious; that hour, when, from the dark and formle&s;s ma&s;s, this fair &s;y&s;tem of nature aro&s;e at the divine command; when, "the morning &s;tars &s;ang together, and all the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy;"&mdash;no le&s;s illu&s;trious is the hour of the re&s;toration of the world; the hour, when, from con|demnation, and mi&s;ery, it emerged into hap|pine&s;s and peace. With le&s;s external ma|je&s;ty it was attended, but is, on that account, the more wonderful, that, under an appear|ance &s;o &s;imple, &s;uch great events were covered.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN the hours of Chri&s;t's death, the long &s;eries of prophecies, vi&s;ions, types, and figures, was accompli&s;hed. This was the center in which they all met; this the point towards which they had tended and verged, through|out the cour&s;e of &s;o many generations. You behold the law and the prophets &s;tanding, if we may &s;o &s;peak, at the foot of the cro&s;s, and doing homage. You behold Mo&s;es and Aaron bearing the ark of the covenant; David and Elijah pre&s;enting the oracle of te&s;timony. You behold all the prie&s;ts and &s;acrifices, all the rites and ordinances, all
<PB N="214" REF="023387_0216_0FBF647626BAFA60">
the types and &s;ymbols, a&s;&s;embled together to receive their con&s;ummation. Without the death of Chri&s;t, the wor&s;hip and cere|monies of the law would have remained a pompous, but unmeaning in&s;titution. In the hour when he was crucified, "the book of the &s;even &s;eals" was opened. Every rite a&s;&s;umed its &s;ignificancy; every prediction met its event; every &s;ymbol di&s;played its corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4. WHEN Chri&s;t was &s;uffering on the cro&s;s, we are informed by one of the Evangeli&s;ts, that he &s;aid, I thir&s;t; and they filled a &s;punge with vinegar and put it to his mouth. "Af|ter he had ta&s;ted the vinegar, knowing that all things were now accompli&s;hed, and the &s;cripture fulfilled, he &s;aid, it is fini&s;hed;" that is, this offered draught of vinegar was the la&s;t circum&s;tance predicted by an ancient pro|phet that remained to be fulfilled. The vi|&s;ion and the prophecy are now &s;ealed: the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation is clo&s;ed. "And he bowed his head and gave up the Gho&s;t."&mdash;
<PB N="215" REF="023387_0217_0FBF6479D489E388">
Significantly was the veil of the temple rent in this hour; for the glory then departed from between the Cherubims. The legal high prie&s;t delivered up his urim and thum|mim, his brea&s;t plate, his robes, and his in|cen&s;e; and Chri&s;t &s;tood forth as the great high-prie&s;t of all &s;ucceeding generations. By that one &s;acrifice, which he now offered, he aboli&s;hed &s;acrifices for ever. Altars on which the fire had blazed, for ages, were now to &s;moke no more. Victims were no more to bleed. "Not with the blood of bulls and goats, but with his own blood; he now enter|ed the holy place, there to appear in the pre&s;ence of God for us."</P>
<P N="5">5. THIS was the hour of a&s;&s;ociation and union to all the wor&s;hippers of God. When Chri&s;t &s;aid, "it is fini&s;hed," he threw down the wall of partition which had &s;o long di|vided the Gentile from the Jew. He gather|ed into one all the faithful out of every kin|dred and people. He proclaimed the hour to be come, when the knowledge of the true God &s;hould be no longer confined to one nation, nor his wor&s;hip to one temple; but over all the earth, the wor&s;hippers of the father &s;hould "&s;erve him in &s;pirit and in truth." From that hour, they who dwelt in the "utmo&s;t ends of the earth, &s;trangers to the covenant of promi&s;e, began to be "brought nigh." In that hour the light of

the go&s;pel dawned from a far on the Briti&s;h i&s;lands.</P>
<P N="6">6. THIS was the hour of Chri&s;t's triumph over all the powers of darkne&s;s; the hour in which he overthrew dominions, and thrones, "led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men." The conte&s;t which the kingdom of darkne&s;s had long maintained again&s;t the kingdom of light, was now brought to its cri&s;is. The period was come, when "the &s;eed of the woman &s;hould brui&s;e the head of the &s;erpent." For many ages the mo&s;t gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition had filled the earth.&mdash; "The glory of the incorruptible God was" every where, except in the land of Judea, "changed into images made like to corrup|tible man, and to birds and bea&s;ts, and creeping things." The world, which the Almighty created for him&s;elf, &s;eemed to have become a temple of idols. Even to vices and pa&s;&s;ions altars were rai&s;ed; and, what was entitled religion, was, in effect, a di&s;ci|pline of impurity. In the mid&s;t of this uni|ver&s;al darkne&s;s, Satan had erected his throne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and the learned and poli&s;hed, as well as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;avage nations, bowed down before him.&mdash; But at the hour when Chri&s;t appeared on the cro&s;s, the &s;ignal of his defeat was given.&mdash; His kingdom &s;uddenly departed from him; the reign of idolatry pa&s;&s;ed away&mdash;He was beheld to fall like lightning from heaven."
<PB N="217" REF="023387_0219_0FBF6480A84D5260">
In that hour the foundation of every Pagan temple &s;hook; the &s;tatue of every fal&s;e God tottered on its ba&s;e. The prie&s;t fled from his falling &s;hrine; and the Heathen oracles became dumb for ever.</P>
<P N="7">7. DEATH al&s;o, the la&s;t foe of man, was the victim of this hour. The formidable appearance of the &s;pectre remained, but his dart was taken away; for, in the hour when Chri&s;t expiated guilt, he di&s;armed death, by &s;ecuring the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t&punc;&mdash; When he &s;aid to his penitent fellow-&s;ufferer, "To day thou &s;halt be with me in Paradi&s;e," He announced to all his followers the certain|ty of heavenly bli&s;s. He declared,
<Q>The Cherubims</Q>
to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the
<Q>fla|ming &s;word</Q>
to be &s;heathed, which had been appointed at the fall,
<Q>to keep from man the way of the Tree of Life.</Q>
Faint before this period, had been the hope, and indi&s;tinct the pro&s;pect, which even good men enjoyed of the heavenly kingdom.
<Q>Life and immortality were now brought to light.</Q>
From the hill of Calvary, the fir&s;t clear view was given to the world of the everla&s;ting man&s;ions. Since that hour, they have been the perpetual con&s;olation of believers in Chri&s;t. Under trouble they &s;ooth their minds; amid&s;t temptations they &s;upport their virtue; and in their dying moments enable
