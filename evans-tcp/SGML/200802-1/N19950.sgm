<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I CANT for my life see the necessity of it, said I; there are numbers of books published without pre|faces.</P>
<P>But you do not consider, said my friend, that this book absolutely requires a preface&mdash;it is the adven|tures of a gentleman who possessed a magic ring: and seemingly those adventures are written by himself, but you give no account how they came into your <HI>hands?</HI></P>
<P>Why they came into my hands through my brain, friend, said I.&mdash;These adventures are mere|ly the children of Fancy. I must own that the best part of them originated in facts.</P>
<P>But why do you make your Inquisitor a man? said he.</P>
<P>For a very obvious reason, I replied. A man may be with propriety brought forward in many scenes where it would be the height of improbability to in|troduce a woman.&mdash;I might, to be sure, continued I, have introduced the following pages by saying I had found them in a hackney coach; or met with part of them by accident at a pastry cook's or cheese-monger's, and being interested by the narrative, I sent back for the remainder; or they might have been left in a lodging by some eccentric old gentleman who had lived there for many years; and thinking
<PB N="vi" REF="026108_0004_0FCFAEDD5DA1B568">
the world would be greatly obliged to me for suffer|ing such a valuable manuscript to be printed, I was prevailed on by the earnest entreaties of my friends, to commit it to the hands of the bookseller.</P>
<P>I know, Sir, this is the usual method of ushering these kind of publications into the world&mdash;but, for my own part, I will honestly confess that this work was written solely for my amusement. As to the motives that induced me to publish it, they can be of no consequence for the reader to be informed of, therefore they shall remain a secret.</P>
<P>But sure, said my friend, you will make some apo|logy for attempting to write in the style of the in|imitable Sterne?</P>
<P>Is the person required to make an apology who copies a portrait painted by an eminent master, said<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">; or should he fail of retaining in his copy, the fine strokes, the beautiful and striking expression in the features of the faultless original; is he to tear his picture, or commit it to the flames, because he has not the genius of the artist whose work he co|pied? Or, suppose a man admired his Sovereign's exalted virtues, and with a laudable ambition strov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to imitate them; is he, because he is conscious of not having the abilities to shine in the most eminent degree, not to endeavour to imitate them at all; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to hide from the world the progress he makes?</P>
<P>No, certainly, said my friend; but have you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vanity to suppose that your writings are the least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with that spirit and fire, which are so con|spicuous in the works of your bright original?</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="026108_0005_0FCFAEDBDE8C30C0">
By no means, said I; but I think as the stars shine brightest when neither the sun nor moon are in the firmament, so, perhaps, when the works of Sterne are not at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, the Inquisitor may be read with some small degree of attention, and afford the reader a little amusement; but should Maria or Le Fevre, make their appearance, its weak rays will be extinguished by the tear of sensibility, which the love|lorn virgin and dying soldier would excite.</P>
<P>Then you do not intend to write a preface? said my friend.</P>
<P>Upon my word, I replied, I have begun several, but I never could write one to please me; so I have at last determined to publish it without, and leave it to the readers to form what conjecture they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> concerning how I came possessed of the papers which contained the adventures.</P>
<P>That will never do, said he, shaking his head.</P>
<P>Then prithee, my good friend, said, I, do write a preface for me; for here I have been hammering my pericranium and biting my nails these two hours, without being able to beat out a single sentence, ei|ther introductory or prefatory.</P>
<P>Suppose, said he, you present your readers with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> conversation; it will be better than no preface at all.</P>
<P>It was a lucky thought, and I instantly set about it.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> reader, I here commit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> this offspring of Fancy; my characters are

not pointed at particular persons, except one or two where gratitude involuntarily guided my pen; it was then I delineated the characters of a Lady Allworth, and the family of the amiable sisters at H-m&mdash;rs&mdash;th.</P>
<P>As to those characters which appear in an unamia|ble light, I neither wish or mean for any person to say that this is meant for Mr. or Mrs. such a one; but I would wish every person who may think the character was designed for themselves, to remember that the likeness was accidentally taken, and it is conscience only that makes it appear so striking to their imagination.</P>

<HEAD>THE PETITION.</HEAD>
<P>I SHOULD like to know the certainty of it, said I, putting the petition into my pocket.&mdash;It contained an account of an unfortunate tradesman reduced to want, with a wife and three small children.&mdash;He ask|ed not charity for himself, but them.&mdash;I should like to know the certainty of it, said I&mdash;there are so ma|ny feigned tales of distress, and the world is so full of duplicity, that in following the dictates of huma|nity we often encourage idleness&mdash;Could I but be satisfied of the authenticity of this man's story.

<HEAD>THE WISH.</HEAD>
<P>How happy should I be if some good fairy, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> days of yore, would give me the power of visiting us|seen, the receptacles of the miserable, and the habi|tations
<PB N="10" REF="026108_0008_0FCFAED807B910E8">
of vice and luxury.&mdash;What a satisfaction I should feel in rewarding and supporting merit; or withdrawing the veil, and discovering the hideous as|pect of hypocrisy. Besides, says self-love, I should then have an opportunity of discovering the senti|ments of the world concerning myself. I should find my real friends, and detect my enemies.&mdash;If half my fortune could procure such a power, I would freely give it.</P>
<P>Search your heart, replies a soft voice, and see if it is not an unwarrantable curiosity, rather than a real with to do good, that now inspires you.</P>
<P>It is strange, said I; I hear a voice, but see no person near me; surely I do not dream!</P>
<P>Be not surprised, continued my invisible compa|nion, I am your guardian genius, and have it in my power to comply with your wishes, provided they are corrected by reason.&mdash;Look on that table and you will see a ring, which, when on your finger, will render you invisible; and, as long as humanity, honor, or friendship, leads you to use it, it will con|tribute to your happiness; but whenever you en|deavour to make it subservient to any unworthy pur|pose, it will lead you into innumerable difficul|ties.</P>
<P>I thank<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the kind genius, instantly seized the treasure, put it on my finger, and, eager to try the experiment, walked out.</P>

<P>D&mdash;n the woman, said the wretch, it is money I want: by Heavens I have not five guineas left in the world, and am twice as many hundred in debt. If I do not succeed in this matrimonial scheme, I shall go to limbo.&mdash;There's an old prying cat of a maid|en aunt stands devilishly in the way, or I could easily dupe the old dad.&mdash;As to Melissa herself, she's such a mere simpleton in the ways of the world, that it requires but a small share of art to make her believe almost any thing.</P>
<P>By this time they had reached the house of the intended victim, when finding my ring had the de|sired effect, I entered the house with her betrayer. His companion wished him good morning, and I, without hesitation, followed him up stairs.</P>

<HEAD>THE DRAWING ROOM.</HEAD>
<P>A VENERABLE old man was sitting on a sopha; the hoary ornaments of his head inspired the mind with awe, while the benignity of his countenance encouraged and invited friendship.&mdash;Beside him, reading Thomson's Seasons, sat his daughter, love|ly and blooming as Aurora, when with rosy fingers on a sweet May morn she unbars the gates of light.&mdash;As Cogdie approached, her features were enliven|ed with a glow that plainly told me her heart was not her own; and the cordiality with which her fa|ther received him, evinced the integrity of his own heart, as he suspected not the integrity of another. After the usual compliments, the little party being seated, Cogdie informed the old gentleman that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> prevented the honor of dining with him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> day by a tradesman to whom he owed about thirty pounds, which, as he had not lately received

remittances from his father, he found it inconveni|ent just then to pay; that the man would take no denial, but had threatened to arrest him. I must be obliged to borrow this paltry sum, continued he, till I can write again to my father.&mdash;You shall not be distressed for such a trifle, said the old gentleman, I will lend it you.</P>
<P>He left the room to get the money, when the un|feeling Cogdie made use of that opportunity to per|suade the heedless unsuspecting Melissa to elope.</P>
<P>Thou art worse than a midnight ruffian, said I&mdash;thou art stealing the peace of a man who is at this moment contributing to thine. They had just time to appoint the day, hour, and place of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ndezvous, when Melissa's father returned with the money.&mdash;I had heard enough, and quitted the room as the old gentleman entered.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE REFLECTION.</HEAD>
<P>THAT a man who has a wife and numerous fa|mily of children, and sees them plunged in the deepest distress, should rob to keep them from starv|ing, is not a matter of surprise&mdash;and while stern Justice holds the balance, angel like pity gently turns the scale.&mdash;But that a man in full health and vigour, with strength and abilities to support himself, who has no weeping wife or famished children to urge him to the deed; should cozen and defraud his best friend, debauch the morals of an innocent girl, and plunge her into ruin, only to obtain a larger share of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re, is to me unaccountable. It is an act that makes humanity shrink back aghast: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with frowns ansheaths her sword, and pity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but for the offender's crimes.</P>
<P>I will rescue Melissa, said I&mdash;she may hereafter thank me. The thought filled my mind with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="13" REF="026108_0011_0FCFAED39FCD0590">
usual complacency.&mdash;I enjoyed in idea the satisfac|tion and gratitude of her father, when he beheld his darling rescued from the jaws of destruction.</P>
<P>It was a fine evening in the month of June; so removing the ring from my finger, I stepped into a fruiterer's, purchased a bottle of strawberries, walked into the Park, and seated myself in one of the chairs.&mdash;My mind was at that moment a sort of vacuum, my thoughts unemployed, when casting my eyes upon the paper that covered the strawberries, I per|ceived it was part of a fairy tale, but wrote in an uncommon poetic stile.</P>

<L>FAIR Cynthia now, bright Empress of the night,</L>
<L>Mounted her azure throne with diamond studded;</L>
<L>Her modest face, veil'd in a fleecy cloud,</L>
<L>Which, as it partly hid, heighten'd her beauties.</L>
<L>When fair Alzada, weary and forlorn,</L>

<L>Her lovely head reclin'd upon her hand;</L>
<L>Her eyes were rais'd with fervour toward Heav'n.</L>

<L>The trembling Princess left her mossy feat,</L>

<L>When sudden clouds obscur'd the face of Heav'n;</L>
<L>The thunders roll'd the forked lightnings flash'd,</L>
<L>And all around was horror and amazement;</L>
<L>Alzada sunk in terror to the ground.</L>
<L>A death-like swoon seal'd up each active sense.</L>
<L>The tempest ceas'd. She rais'd her fearful eyes,</L>
<L>And saw before her a fair lofty palace:</L>
<L>The gates were solid brass; and the supporters</L>
<L>Marble, twin'd round with vine leaves wrought in gold.</L>
<L>She enter'd, and was instantly surrounded</L>
<L>By seven young virgins, clad in azure blue,</L>
<L>With alabaster vases in their hands,</L>
<L>Who paid the homage to a princess due.</L>
<L>They shed around her numberless perfumes,</L>
<L>And o'er her threw a robe, of spotless white,</L>
<L>Then led her to a room within the palace,</L>
<L>Where, on a throne of amethyst and gold,</L>
<L>There sat a Monarch of majestic port;</L>
<L>Who, rising, welcom'd the admiring princess,</L>
<L>And plac'd her on a shining throne beside him.</L>
<L>They brought her baskets of the choicest fruits,</L>
<L>And water from the purest limpid stream.</L>
<L>Alzada being refresh'd, rose from her seat,</L>

<P>A CROWD was assembled before the door. For|getting what I came for, friend, said I&mdash;addressing myself to the master of the shop, can you tell me the cause of this bustle?&mdash;It is a very extraordinary one. Sir, he replied.&mdash;A boy about ten years old, going to a shop h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d by to purchase something for his mo|ther was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ollected by a tradesman to whom his fa|ther owed a considerable sum of money, and who had just before employed a bailiff to arrest him.&mdash;The man inquired of the child where his father liv|ed, and upon his refusing to tell, offered him money, and promised him a great many fine things; but finding that plan equally ineffectual, he proceeded to threats. Upon which, the boy burst into tears, and fearing himself upon some steps opposite, declared he would stay there all night rather than give them an opportunity of sending his father to jail.</P>
<P>The boy has the spirit of a Roman, said I.&mdash;How many a man will feel the blush of conscious guilt upon his chee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, when he shall be told of this; for, Oh! shame to humanity and manhood, how many would fell their country through avarice, or betra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it through fear&mdash;While this magnanimous boy re|fuses a bribe, though poverty might induce him to take it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> brave the threats of an inhuman wretch, rather than betray his father, though his childhood might excuse even cowardice.&mdash;I will go and speak to the creditor, said I&mdash;perhaps I may persuade him to drop his design of arresting the poor man, and then I will follow the boy home.</P>

Eighteen pounds, replied the man.</P>
<P>And are you really distressed for the money?</P>
<P>No; thank my prudence for that; I have taken care of the main chance, and not like Heartfree, loved others more than myself.</P>
<P>I fear you have not loved them so well, my friend.</P>
<P>Why no, to be sure! I follow the first law of na|ture, self-preservation.</P>
<P>And why not follow the first rule of Christianity, to do as you would be done by?</P>

<P>Trust to his honor&mdash;oh! you know but little of this world, to talk at that ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e: why this very Heart|free was ruined by trusting to a person's honor.

<P>And for his humanity, said I&mdash;you would reward him with a prison; rob his wife and children of their only comfort, the presence of their father and their friend&mdash;and of what use will it be to you?</P>
<P>I don't know that it will be of much use to <HI>me,</HI> he replied; but it will teach Heartfree to remember himself before others, another time.</P>
<P>The remembrance of what he has done for others, said I, so far from sitting painful on his mind, will smooth the thorny pillow of distress, and make even a prison pleasant; he shall sleep soundly on a bed of straw, and dream of those whose sorrows he has lightened, while you shall feel scorpions on a bed of down: nor shall the sweet restorer of tired nature visit you, unless it be to fright you with some dread|ful vision of prisons and starving wretches.</P>
<P>I turned from him with honest indignation, and calling to the fruiterer, gave him the money to dis|charge the debt.&mdash;I would not trust myself to speak to the man again who could so shamefully <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the laws of humanity.&mdash;The poor boy was weep|ing, his face hid with his hands.

<HEAD>THE FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>As I ascended a narrow winding stair-case, I per|ceived in a small room, the door of which was part|ly open, an elegantly-formed woman, sitting on the side of a wretched bed, on which lay a man, the picture of famine.

<P>My dear boy, cried the fond mother, why do you talk so incoherently? Who has frightened my child? What is the matter with you?</P>
<P>He endeavoured to tell his story with propriety.&mdash;It was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, joy had entirely unconnected his ideas; but he made himself understand.</P>

<HEAD>THE DISCOVERY.</HEAD>
<P>I AM greatly obliged to you said the country gen|tleman, as he sat down to the breakfast table; the invitation you have have given me is very accepta|ble; I have lost the estate I have been so long at law about, for want of sufficient evidence; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I have paid the costs, I shall not have more than two hundred pounds left, with which I mean to purchase an annuity; therefore I shall make your house my home, till I can settle my affairs.</P>

<P>Mr. Woollet summoned up a look of expressive anger and contempt, and fixing his eyes on his false friend, cried. He who can refuse half a guinea to my necessities, shall never share my prosperity.

<HEAD>THE BREAKFAST.</HEAD>
<P>SHE was listening with attention to Heartfree, who was relating the story of last night.

<P>I have made you wait, my Emma, said I&mdash;Heart|free rose from his seat, bowed, and cast down his eyes, while his cheeks were dyed with crimson&mdash;it was a blush neither expressive of guilt no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> shame&mdash;it was a blush occasioned only by the pain a noble heart feels when in a state of despondence.

<P>And shall I never see mamma, then? and must <HI>she</HI> still live in that dark room?</P>
<P>I was willing to try her.&mdash;You shall stay here, Lucy, said I, but you must not see your mamma, nor can I help her living in that little dark room.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="026108_0024_0FCFAEBC7B1ADFE8">

<P>It is a fine place, said she; but if my mamma cannot take a part of these fine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I had rather go home again.</P>

<HEAD>THE LESSON.</HEAD>
<P>IT was about two years after, when my Emma, Harriet, Lucy, and myself, were on a visit to Heart|free.&mdash;His brother had returned from India with a fortune equal to their most sanguine wishes.&mdash;In rural retirement, about twenty miles from London, they lived in complete happiness, having been taught the value of present blessings, by past scenes of sor|row.</P>
<P>It was a night when the contending elements seemed to threaten the earth with dissolution; the forked lightening rived the sturdy oaks; the bursting and almost incessant peals of thunder made all nature tremble. The whirlwind raged, the gleam|ing meteors shewed the distant foaming sea, its proud unsettled waves that seemed to wage war with the black impending sky.&mdash;It was a night of horror. It was a night to make a man remember on what a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ender thread his life depends. The vast universe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but an atom that with one blast from the Creative Power might vanish into air, and leave no trace of planets, earth, or sea, but all again be universal chaos.</P>
<P>It ceased. The moon broke from behind a jetty cloud, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">inged round with silver&mdash;the wind passed gently over the trees and herbage, whose leaves had
<PB N="27" REF="026108_0025_0FCF8D11AC4B0128">
caught the late descending shower, and glittered in the moon beams.</P>
<P>The tempest was dreadful, said I, but it has clear|ed the air of all noxious vapours; and how beauti|ful appears the face of nature, heightened by the re|membrance of the late scene of horror!&mdash;Just so it is with life; none can enjoy the pleasures of pros|perity so well as those who have felt the pangs of adversity.</P>
<P>Our ears were invaded by a groan; it came from the road; we followed the sound, and found a man lying on the ground, bleeding, and almost naked.&mdash;We bore him to the house, his wounds were dressed, and it was judged rest would be his best restorer.</P>
<P>In the morning he was unable to rise. I proposed to Heartfree to visit him; we entered the room, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut back the curtains, and discovered the features of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he inhuman Creditor.&mdash;We paused.&mdash;He endea|voured to turn his face from us, and waving his hand for us to leave him, cried emphatically, Heartfree! thou art revenged.</P>
<P>I should like to know, said Heartfree, when his wounded guest was able to leave his apartment, by what accident you came in that dangerous situation.</P>
<P>I will inform you, he replied:&mdash;About three weeks since, my house was consumed by fire, and with it all my property&mdash;my wife and children were saved, but they were saved from the flames to perish by famine.</P>
<P>His heart was full.&mdash;Heartfree passed his hand a|cross his eyes.&mdash;The man continued.&mdash;Some cha|ritable people made a collection of near fifty pounds, and advised me to go into the country, and purchase <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> little place where my wife and children might be supported by industry.&mdash;To save expences I travelled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and in a late tempest stopt at an ale house <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it should be over.

<PB N="28" REF="026108_0026_0FCFAEBAE6631660">
to accompany me; but before I had proceeded far, they stopped and demanded my money; seeing they had no fire arms, I endeavoured to defend my|self, but they were too powerful; I received a wound in my side and soon grew insensible; the rest you know.&mdash;I return you many thanks for the unme|rited favours I have received; but I must now go back to my poor family, and either starve in obscu|rity, or go to the parish.</P>
<P>You shall do neither, exclaimed Heartfree, look|ing at his own children as he spoke.</P>
<P>Heartfree was a husband and a father in the just sense of the words.&mdash;He was troubled with a short memory, and had entirely forgot that he had ever been harshly treated by the person before him.</P>
<P>You shall do neither, said he, taking out his pock|et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ok, and endeavouring to disperse the drops of humanity that started in his eye: here, giving him a note, here is a trifle; I do not at present want; when you can spare it, repay me; till then you are welcome.</P>
<P>The man could not take it&mdash;astonishment had rendered him motionless.</P>
<P>Heartfree put it on the table, and calling to a ser|vant to get a horse ready for his guest to return to town, wished him a pleasant ride, and left the room.</P>

<P>I HAVE spent the best part of my life, said the old man, in the service of my country.&mdash;At fifty years of age I retired, with no other fortune than a lieutenant's half pay&mdash;it was but scanty, it was but sufficient for the wants of Narcissa, my wife, and self.&mdash;I would tell you that my child was lovely, Sir, but I am old, and a father; both those particulars would lead you to doubt my veracity.

She found herself pregnant, and pressed him to marry her; he said I would not consent to their union, and when out of tenderness I wished to remove her into the country, she thought it was on|ly to take her from him.&mdash;Conscious of her own unhappy situation, she flew to her betrayer&mdash;he for a while behaved with a tolerable degree of tenderness; but he soon threw off the disguise, and turned her out of doors, at the same time informing her that I had taken an oath never to see or assist her.</P>
<P>Heavens! what barbarity, exclaimed Melissa.&mdash;Melissa pitied Olivia, but she felt for herself&mdash;it might have been her situation.&mdash;She desired me to proceed.</P>
<P>I took the fair mourner, said I, into the country, where, in about six weeks, she was delivered of a boy.&mdash;I told her unfortunate tale to Mrs Sidley and her daughter; they pitied her, they determined she should not be lost.

<P>I suppose Miss is married, cried Mrs. Sarah.&mdash;She did not make such an excursion, and with such company, for nothing.</P>
<P>Really, Madam, said I, she is not married; she has taken a little excursion it is true, but she is now at my house, impatiently waiting for a summons to throw herself at her father's feet, and implore his forgiveness.&mdash;The old gentleman called for his hat.</P>
<P>Why surely you will not forgive her, brother? said the churlish aunt.</P>
<P>Not forgive her! exclaimed the father&mdash;I tell you, sister, she shall be forgiven, taken again to my bosom, again share my confidence; nor be driven by my unkindness, and the cold contempt of her own sex, to that vice which I know her soul would shrink from as from death.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sarah muttered something about virtue and propriety, and left the room.</P>
<P>There were three reasons why Mrs. Sarah was so inveterate against her niece; the first was was, she was old, very sallow, rather inclined to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and had a voice something resembling the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> a rook; it was therefore a great mortification <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have a niece so young and lovely.</P>
<P>In the second place, she had formed some design

on Cogdie's heart herself&mdash;no woman can bear a rival in love or dress.</P>
<P>The third, and most potent reason was, she had never been a parent, therefore could not tell the pangs, the yearnings, the fond solicitudes that by turns agitated the heart of Melissa's father.</P>
<P>Come, let us go, my friend, said he, let us go and bring the dear fugitive home.</P>

<P>He was right in making this promise, for nothing is so liable to drive a woman to a second error, as her being subject to continual reproach for the first.</P>

<P>Entirely so.</P>

<P>Nothing more common, I assure you.</P>

<P>Nothing can be more common, Miss, continued he, than for an author to get a quantity of old maga|zines, the older the better, and having picked and culled those stories the most adapted for his purpose, he places them in a little regular order, writes a line here and there, and so offers them to the public as an entire new work.</P>

<HEAD>THE VILLAGE WEDDING.</HEAD>
<P>I NEVER see the simple inhabitants of a village engaged in a scene of mirth, but I long to mingle with them&mdash;I wish to see, feel, and taste, every thing with the same sensations they do.</P>
<P>They were seated round a large table, under the shade of some spreading oaks&mdash;I will partake their diversions, said I, without disturbing them; so I put on my ring, and mixed among the groupe.</P>

<P>Their repast finished, a lad with a pipe and ta|bor, and another with a fiddle, struck up a lively air, when Colin and his Rose led off the dance, with step so light, a countenance so serene, and an air s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|blythe, that I wished myself an humble villager, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Emma a nut-brown maid.</P>

<HEAD>THE RESCUE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD been at the play.</P>
<P>A young creature, in the box adjoining that I sat in, had attracted my notice the whole evening; her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> attention during the performance, shewed she was almost a stranger to those kind of diversions.</P>

they were by no means suitable guardians for her youth and charms.</P>
<P>The one was a young man of fortune, a professed libertine.</P>
<P>The other an old, fat woman, whose looks and gestures bespoke her employment.</P>
<P>I thought I could read in the open countenance of the young lady an unconsciousness of guilt, and a full confidence in the company and protection of her companions&mdash;I was determined to be convinced whether my conjectures were well founded.</P>
<P>When they left the playhouse I put on my ring and followed them; they were set down at the door of an elegant house; the rooms within were superb, the furniture grand, and the servants numerous&mdash;Supper was served up&mdash;they urged the young lady to drink several glasses of wine&mdash;</P>
<P>She complied with reluctance.</P>
<P>I will go and order the coach, said the old woman, and left the room.</P>

<HEAD>THE ACTRESS.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL take a peep behind the scenes, said I, one evening, as I passed the Hay-market Theatre; so, putting on my ring, I entered.</P>
<P>You surprise me, Madam&mdash;not come into the house about his business the nights that you perform? (said a man, addressing himself to Miss&mdash;) pray, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n what has he molested you?</P>
<P>He met me on the stairs, Sir, and it is very dis|tressing to be jostled by such low creatures. I will have the house cleared of such people.</P>
<P>It is a very extraordinary demand, madam&mdash;he is full as necessary in his station as you are in yours&mdash;I fancy, the heroine of a comedy would make but a poor appearance with her hair uncurled and unpowdered; nor would you much admire an hero with a beard of ten or twelve days growth.</P>
<P>I don't understand this insolence, replied she; it is what I am not used to.</P>
<P>Pray, what is all this fuss about? cried a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gentleman&mdash;</P>
<P>Nothing in the world, Sir, but Miss&mdash;and the barber.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="026108_0055_0FCFAE850F124AA8">
It is very ridiculous, said I, talking of the circum|stance a few days after, that a woman whose bread depends upon the smiles of the public, and who, eve|ry night that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he performs, exerts her talents to please taylors, hairdressers, tinners, nay, even chimney|sweepers, when they can raise a shilling to purchase a feat among the Gods. It is the height of folly for such a woman to complain of her feelings being hurt by meeting a barber on her dressing-room stairs.</P>
<P>Call it by its right name, said a person that stood by me, it is pride.</P>
<P>Pride was not made for man, nor woman neither, I'll be sworn; it spoils the finest set of features <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the world, and is more pernicious to a pretty face than paint to a lovely complexion;&mdash;it sits but auk|wardly on a dutchess&mdash;and the queen never uses it.</P>
<P>What Queen? said he&mdash;</P>
<P>Why the British Queen, to be sure, said I.&mdash;</P>
<P>But then you make no distinction, said he, be|tween the conscious dignity of a queen, and the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rt supercilious airs of a favourite actress: if the world were guided by the bright example set from the Bri|tish throne, pride would be entirely abolished.</P>
<P>That would be a heavenly thing, said I; for the annihilation of pride is like the dissolution of the bo|dy, it unfetters the soul, and leaves it free and un|confined to soar above the stars.</P>
<P>I have frequently been engaged in disputes con|cerning women of this profession&mdash;it ours me be|yond all patience to hear people advance an opinion so very contracted and illiberal, as that of supposing no woman can be virtuous who is on the stage&mdash;I know many at this time who are ornaments not on|ly to their profession, but to the sex in general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> even the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I have just mentioned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">generous, humane, and prudent, pride is her only fault.&mdash;Charming woman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I have often said, when I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

with her performance of some amiable character&mdash;conquer but that one foible, and our admiration will rise into veneration.&mdash;I am confident a woman may, if she is so inclined, be as virtuous as Lucrece be|hind the scenes of a theatre. Virtue begets respect wherever she appears; on the contrary, a woman of loose inclination, though she is immured in a con|vent, will find opportunities of doing evil.&mdash;It is a great pity so many women belonging to the stage are thus inclined; but why should we, on account of those that are bad, condemn a Siddons, Brunton, Kemble, or Pope?&mdash;Why should a woman, if she is a good wife, daughter, or mother, be less respect|ed because she has genius to contribute to our a|musement, by bringing before our eyes heroines we have so often read of, and exhibiting characters we so greatly admire?&mdash;for my part, I never judge of a person from their profession or situation in life; it is from their actions I form an idea of their dispo|sition; and as I think genius and merit deserve as much esteem when we meet them in an humble mansion as when they inherit palaces, so are virtue and prudence as valuable an acquisition in an actress, as in the daughter of a peer, and alike to be esteem|ed and respected.</P>

dew drops from the waving grass, even there I would find company, conversation, and amusement.</P>
<P>To a thinking mind, the book of nature is ever open for our perusal; and a soul warmed by sensi|bility and gratitude, reads the divine pages with plea|sure, and contemplates the great source of all with wonder, reverence, and love.</P>
<P>As I wandered along, encouraging these pleasing reflections, I saw an old man buying some stale bread and meat at the window of a mean eating-house; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ood with his back towards me; his coat was dir|ty and torn; his whole appearance was expressive of the most abject poverty.&mdash;Friend, said I, going up to him; perhaps this trifle may procure you a bet|ter meal, putting half a guinea into his hand.</P>
<P>It always gives my heart a pang when I see age and distress combined&mdash;age of itself always brings anguish enough.&mdash;How very insupportable, then, must it be, when there are no comforts, no little in|dulgencies, to compensate for those days of unavoid|able pain.</P>
<P>As I presented my little donation, I looked in the old man's face&mdash;I thought I had seen the features, but could not recollect where.</P>

<P><PB N="60" REF="026108_0058_0FCFAE7C8B5A8E20">
You shall go home with me, said I, calling an hackney coach&mdash;let those take shame to themselves who deny a part of their wealth to merit in distress. I am proud to acknowledge myself the friend of a man of worth, though he should be in the lowest situ|ation. And why, said I, as we drove towards home, why should a man be ashamed of his misfor|tunes? why should poverty call a blush upon the cheek of merit? we did not mark out our own fortunes.</P>
<P>But then the world, the world, Sir, will always scoff and spurn the man humbled by the griping hand of penury: nor is there an object than in general meets with more contempt from the rich and pow|erful, than those who have seen better days, but are reduced by unavoidable misfortunes to a dependence on their smiles.</P>
<P>Strange infatuation! to set themselves in the pride of their hearts, above their fellow creatures; and for what, truly? because a little more yellow dirt has fallen to their share.

<P>AND do you think there are such characters in the world, said the old Lieutenant?</P>
<P>I fear there are too many, friend, said I.</P>
<P>I know not how it was, said he, but I never sus|pected mankind of half the vices and follies I have found in this short month that I have been in Lon|don; and even now I do not think their errors pro|ceed half so much from the badness of their hearts as their heads. I own, continued he, it is our duty to render every service in our power to our fellow creatures, but why should one, because he has a just sense of his duty, and discharges it faithfully, despise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n other because he has not the same feelings. I felt a consciousness of having, in commending bene|volence, sounded my own praise&mdash;it was my turn to be ashamed.&mdash;I felt abashed, and shrunk, as it were, into nothing.&mdash;Oh, man! what a poor weak crea|ture thou art, when even in the moment of discharg|ing thy duty, thy own heart, easily led astray, will vaunt and boast its own superiority.&mdash;The most be|nevolent action in the world looses its intrinsic me|rit, when the man, who performs it says to himself, I am better than my neighbour; I am not hard hearted, nor proud, nor avaricious.</P>
<P>No, cries humility, but you are vain glorious.</P>
<P>I was quite disconcerted, and could not forgive myself.</P>

<HEAD>THE MEETING.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD ordered my servant to supply Mr. Nelson (for that was the name of the old Lieutenant) with every thing necessary for him to appear in at dinner, and then went to seek my Emma.&mdash;I found her in
<PB N="62" REF="026108_0060_0FCF8CFE6EAB20D8">
the garden&mdash;the young lady I had rescued last night was busy in platting a little lock of hair, and placing it in a fanciful manner, to the bottom of a picture which hung round her neck. When she had finish|ed, she glanced her eye towards us, and thinking she was not observed, pressed it several times to her lips. I thought I saw a tear in her eye, but the chaste look, the religious fervour with which she gazed upon the portrait, convinced me it was a tear whose source might be acknowledged without a blush.</P>
<P>She had dropped the picture, and, resting one arm upon a pedestal, seemed attentively watching Harri|et and Lucy, who had dressed a little favourite dog in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cloaths, and was teaching it to dance a minuet.&mdash;The scene was picturesque; and I know not how long I might have contemplated it with si|lent satisfaction, had I not observed Mr. Nelson coming toward me with eager step and anxious eye&punc;</P>
<P>Tell me, who is that? said he, pointing to the young lady&mdash;but that I think 'tis impossible, I should say 'tis my Narcissa.</P>
<P>At the sound of his voice the young lady looked up, and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a few steps, stood in an attitude of wonder and astonishment, till he pronounced the name of Narcissa; when springing like lightning to him, she threw her arms round his neck, and cried, Yes, yes, I am your child.</P>
<P>It would be doing injustice to the rest of the scene, were I to attempt to describe it&mdash;words could not speak the feelings of their hearts&mdash;It was a meeting between a fond father and an affectionate child&mdash;and I leave it to such to judge of their happiness.</P>

<P>How can you ask me that, my child? replied the old man; did you think your mother and myself could sit quietly down when you had been absent from us near a month, and we had never had a sin|gle line from you?</P>
<P>I wrote twice a week, said Narcissa, wiping her eyes&mdash;she could not bear to hear her mother had been distressed.</P>
<P>The old man continued&mdash;</P>
<P>I was too much interested in the safety of my dear girl to be at ease under such disagreeable appearanc|es; so leaving your mother what money I could spare, I sat out to walk to London, but was prevented by this gentleman.&mdash;On my arrival in town I went to the place where the old lady resided, and was told by her servant that you were gone out of town to pass a few weeks&mdash;I walked to the place whither I was directed, but could find no such person&mdash;My lit|tle stock was almost exhausted&mdash;I went again <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the lady's house, and was treated by her servant with in|solence.</P>
<P>Narcissa laid her hand on his shoulder and gave him a look that I am sure would have healed every wound the servant's insolence had given his heart, though they had been a thousand.</P>
<P>Oh! filial love, fair daughter of gratitude, sister to piety, thou first favourite of Heaven, to whom long life and prosperous days are promised, how doth thy angel's face and soothing hand make the paternal evening of life clear and unclouded!&mdash;But I am wan|dering from my story.</P>

<P>Unhappy man, said I, as busy fancy drew out the sad scene.</P>
<P>She held up to my mind's eye a man born to a good inheritance, and surrounded with all the comforts, all the blessings, he desired&mdash;but he was a negro.</P>
<P>He was sitting in his little hut, his jetty compa|nion by his side; one infant at her breast, two others prattling at her knee; she looked, she felt happy.

<P>I left the wife, and followed the poor negro&mdash;he had no comfort but the idea that he should be with his child; that he should have it in his power to ease him if heavy tasks were imposed, to guard him from dangers and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">each him to be resigned and content|ed.&mdash;They arrive at Barbadoes&mdash;they are exposed to sale and allotted to different masters.</P>

<P>I FEAR, said I, as we went forward&mdash;I fear you have not been successful in gaining any permanent settlement&mdash;pray how have you disposed of yourself these last seven years?</P>
<P>I have, he replied, been strangely tossed about, be|held various scenes, tried many different plans, and been unsuccessful in all.</P>
<P>When I left Oxford, I was recommended by a friend of my father's to be preceptor to the only son of a man of large fortune&mdash;he was a sprightly, sensi|ble lad, but exceedingly capricious in his humour, which was owing to his parent's never allowing him to be contradicted. For a month or six weeks we went on very well; my young gentleman was fond of learning, took every thing with surprising facility, and gave me little or n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> trouble in obliging him to attend his book&mdash;but the unbounded applause he re|ceived from his parents, the caresses and indulgences they were continually heaping on him, and the praise every casual guest was obliged to bestow on this darling of the family, soon made him think he was as learned as any of the seven wise men of Gree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, and therefore had no farther need of a preceptor.</P>
<P>When I found he grew careless and neglectful, I thought a little correction might be necessary; but, on trying the experiment, was called by the over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> mother, an inhuman monster; and the father thought his boy had a genius too bright to require such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> methods of proceeding. In short, Sir, having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> power over the child, he soon lost what little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he had at first attained; and I was dismissed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the character of having ruined the boy's genius by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> timed and unmerciful correction.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="026108_0071_0FCFAE67F4D2A4E0">
As I had taken orders, I lived for some time by occasionally reading prayers, or preaching for a vi|car who was very old and infirm, but having a large family, could not well afford to pay a constant cu|rate.&mdash;In the course of this time I became acquaint|ed with a young lady possessed of every virtue that might render her a desirable companion; add to this, she had two hundred pounds in her own possession, and lived with an uncle, who, beside an affluent for|tune, had an excellent living in his gift&mdash;the old in|cumbent of which was in a very declining state of health&mdash;had Maria been poor I should have loved her; but I should never have thought of marrying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the circumstances I then was, as I knew it must involve us both in misery. She was all gen|tleness; and while she thought the sentiment she felt for me was only pity for my precarious, disagreea|ble situation, it by degrees ripened into a tender and lasting affection.&mdash;Her uncle had ever studied her happiness, and thinking it would soon be in his power to settle us both in an easy, desirable living, he encouraged my pretensions, and in a few months made me the husband of Maria.</P>
<P>It would be needless to mention the happiness I enjoyed for eight months with this amiable woman; suffice it to say, I envied not the wealthiest or most oppulent man in Europe. But our happiness was too great to be permanent&mdash;her uncle had ever been a man of sound constitution, and though then in the sixtieth year of his age, gave no signs of infirmity or decay: but, alas! who can depend on so frail a thing as life.&mdash;One morning having waited break|fast till near ten o'clock, surprised at the old gentle|man's lying so long, as he was in general a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> early riser, I tapped at his chamber door, but received no answer. I opened it, and went in, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he had taken his final leave of this world. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my|self
<PB N="76" REF="026108_0072_0FCFAE6612727D08">
extremely shocked; but fearing for Maria, who, at that time was pregnant, I composed myself, and going down, told her, that her uncle being rather in|disposed, desired not to be disturbed.</P>
<P>On pretence of going for an apothecary I went and informed an intimate friend of Maria's with the melancholy affair. We determined she should call and take Maria out, and by various methods keep her from home all day; when in the evening we would, by degrees, acquaint her with the sad tidings&mdash;But all these precautions were vain. During my absence, one of the servants had entered the room, which in my agitated state of mind I had forgot to lock, and instantly alarmed her mistress. At my return I found my poor Maria in an agony of grief, which, however, was happily of no ill consequence to herself or the infant.</P>
<P>When my uncle was buried, we examined his papers, and no will being found, a distant male rela|tion took possession of the whole estate. I removed with my wife from the house; still flattering my|self when the old incumbent died I should have the living; but I was mistaken. In a few months the old man paid the debt of nature, and the living was disposed of to another person.</P>
<P>Our disappointment was very great&mdash;but the two hundred pounds Maria possessed hindered us from being immediately exposed to want, but that sum was gradually decreasing&mdash;beside a child which was born soon after my uncle's decease, Maria pro|mised to make me father of another. At any other time this would have given me great pleasure&mdash;but the unsettled state of my affairs made me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that this poor little infant was coming into a world to inherit nothing but penury.</P>
<P>About this time I was recommended to I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ernoff, whose eldest son was going abroad, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="77" REF="026108_0073_0FCFAE649996DB88">
a governor; however painful it might be to part with Maria, yet the promise of a handsome salary led me to accept the proposal.</P>
<P>I left the dear woman, and set out to make the tour of Europe with my young Lord.&mdash;I had been absent from my native country three years, and found myself highly in favour with the young gen|tleman abroad, and his father at home&mdash;who, to recompense my fidelity to his son, was continually heaping favours on Maria and the children.</P>
<P>We were at Madrid, when my Lord commenced an intrigue with a woman of rank and reputation.&mdash;It was in vain I represented to him the danger|ous consequences that might ensue from such an illi|cit amour.&mdash;The more I remonstrated, the more obstinate he appeared; and unfortunately soon suc|ceeded in ruining the object of his dishonorable pur|suit.</P>
<P>Having obtained every favour from the easy, thoughtless Leonilla, he was preparing to leave Ma|drid.&mdash;She was informed of his design (and the re|venge of a Spanish woman, when injured, being al|ways adequate to the love they once bore their se|ducer) she hired bravoes to dispatch this young no|bleman the night preceding that appointed for our departure.</P>
<P>We had dined out&mdash;and the evening being fine, preferred walking home rather than going in a car|riage.</P>
<P>I perceived two men watch and follow us through every street, till coming to one that was dark and unfrequented, one of the men came up and attempt|ed to stab my Lord.&mdash;I drew my sword, and aiming at the villain's heart, threw myself before the young nobleman, and received the poniard of the second <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in my own bosom.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="026108_0074_0FCFAE634F1BB8B8">
This little scuffle having made some noise, people soon gathered round, when the ruffians finding them|selves disappointed in their aims, made off.&mdash;My Lord thinking a longer stay at Madrid would be dangerous, left me to the care of a surgeon and nurse, and departed next morning for Paris, from whence he proposed returning to England.</P>

<HEAD>THE MOURNER.</HEAD>
<P>MY friend was proceeding in his narrative, when our attention was engaged by the appearance of a woman habited like a pilgrim, but in deep mourn|ing&mdash;such an appearance being uncommon in Eng|land, it naturally excited our curiosity.</P>
<P>We were in Kensington Gardens.&mdash;</P>
<P>The mourner's stature was above the lower size, and there was a certain dignity about her which spoke her of no common rank&mdash;her features had once been lovely; and even now, though pale and marked with grief, there was a something in them that engaged the affections, and insensibly drew the heart towards her.&mdash;She seated herself upon the ground; and resting her elbow on the root of a tree&mdash;her head reclining pensively on her hand&mdash;she plucked up some wild daisies that grew round her&mdash;it amused her for the moment, but recollecting her|self, she cried&mdash;</P>
<P>They will soon die, and I have killed them.</P>
<P>The thought seemed to give her exquisite pain,&mdash;She dropped the daisies on the ground, and burst in|to tears.</P>

That is very true, said she (turning towards me, and laying her hand on my arm) I would fain forget that I was the murderer of an innocent man&mdash;I am trying to expiate my fault by fasting and hard pe|nance. I have come a pilgrimage of many hundred miles on foot, nor rested my weary limbs, but when necessity, obliged me to cross the sea.&mdash;If I could find the woman I have made a widow, and the children I have rendered orphans, I would do something to make their lives happy, and then return home, and devote myself to the Blessed Virgin.</P>
<P>Alas, continued she, still resting on my arm, and laying her other hand on her heart&mdash;alas, you know not what a sad thing it is to be an orphan. I once had a father&mdash;had he lived&mdash;but, poor man, he had been to the wars; and when he returned, he met my mother's corpse just going to the grave.&mdash;He wept not&mdash;he never once complained, but following in silence, saw her interred&mdash;then laid himself down on the cold turf that covered her, and never rose again.</P>
<P>Here she seemed quite lost&mdash;and leaving me ab|ruptly, walked to a retired part of the garden.</P>
<P>I never felt my pity so strongly excited as at this moment.&mdash;The whole tenor of the mourner's dis|course and actions discovered the disorder of her mind.

<P>But come, said I, turning to my friend, finish your recital.&mdash;He attempted to speak, but was forced to stop&mdash;something rose in his throat&mdash;I felt the same in mine&mdash;but what that was, I will leave to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he ima|gination of every reader of sensibility.</P>

<HEAD>THE COURTIER.</HEAD>
<P>MY Lord's departing from Madrid without me, continued my friend, occasioned a report to be spread that I had died of my wounds, and indeed ne|ver was a man nearer the confines of the grave than I was&mdash;but by the care and attention of the people that were about me, I was in six weeks able to go into the country, where I remained above two months in a languid, weak state, during which time I received not one line from my Lord&mdash;as soon as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound myself able to bear the fatigue of travelling, I set forward for England, where I arrived about ten months since, and found my dear Maria in a situa|tion truly deplorable&mdash;The old Earl was dead&punc; and his son daily expected from Paris, where he had made a longer stay than he at first intended&mdash;Maria had been six months without receiving any money on my account, as my Lord had wrote to his father's steward, informing him that I chose to be left at Madrid&mdash;I endeavoured to get employ; and, after many fruitless attempts, at last got a curacy of thirty pounds a year, which is but trifling to support a wife and two children&mdash;I have frequently wrote to my Lord who has been at his seat in Essex ever since his arrival in England; but either has been prevent|ed from answering my letters by a multiplicity of bu|siness, or he does not choose to be troubled with an indigent friend&mdash;Yet I cannot bring myself to think it possible for a human being to be so ungrateful as to turn a deaf ear to the complaint of a man who once saved his life, at the hazard of his own&mdash;He arrived in town three days since; and this day at two o'clock I propose waiting on him, and request|ing his assistance.</P>
<P>We will take an hackney coach, and I will set you down at his door, said I.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="026108_0077_0FCFAFA55BA243B8">
When we arrived within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> yards of the house. I stopped the coach, and getting out, wished my Friend a good morning, and turned down a street only to put on my ring&mdash;when quickening my pace, I was at the Earl's door as soon as he was.</P>
<P>A servant appeared, whose insolent carriage be|spoke the character of his Lord.</P>
<P>You may always judge of a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> demean|or and disposition by the behaviour of his servant, the lower class of mankind always aping the man|ners of their superiors.</P>
<P>After some hesitation, and a few leering, saucy looks at the rusty garb of my friend, he left him standing in the hall, and went up to my Lord.</P>
<P>Having waited full a quarter of an hour, he again made his appearance at the top of the stairs, and reaching his body partly over the ballustrades, called out, You may come up.</P>
<P>I followed him into the chamber of the young Earl&mdash;He was sitting in an easy chair, dressed in a long robe de chambre, a dish of chocolate in one hand and the newspaper in the other;&mdash;his back was partly toward the door;&mdash;and on my friend's being announced, he neither turned his head nor raised his eyes from the paper&mdash;</P>
<P>I have taken the earliest opportunity to wait <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your Lordship, said my friend bowing.</P>
<P>Oh, Mr. Teachum, said my Lord, I am glad to see you&mdash;Set Mr. Teachum a chair&mdash;said he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> servant&mdash;and when did you arrive in England, Mr. Teachum?</P>
<P>I had the honor of informing your Lordship by letter, he replied, about six months since, and of the mistake that was made concerning my salary, which was stopped from the time your Lordship left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="026108_0078_0FCFAFA2CD655A10">
Why, Teachum, said my Lord, lifting up his eyes for the first time from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he piper, and looking at my friend w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">h a sort of surprise, I thought from that time you was free from my service.</P>
<P>Very true, my Lord; but the wound I received in your Lordships service confined me to my apart|ment for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> time; and the attendance I received was very expensive&mdash;I had nothing to depend on but your Lordship's bounty.</P>
<P>Well, I will see and recompense you for your sa|lary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> being stopped&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray how have you lived since your return to Eng|land?</P>
<P>But poorly my Lord; I have but thirty pounds a year.</P>
<P>My Lord again looked up; but it was a look of disbelief.</P>
<P>And how many children have you?</P>
<P>Two, my Lord; a boy and a girl.</P>
<P>Well, I will see and do something for the boy&mdash;and let me think&mdash;yes, there's the living at Wilt|ham, about three hundred a year&mdash;that will just suit you&mdash;call on me again in a day or two; I shall al|ways be glad to see you.</P>
<P>So saying, he got up, and, without farther cere|mony, walked into the next room&mdash;my friend de|parted, and I followed my Lord&mdash;He pulled the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;John, said he to the servant that entered, I desire you will tell the porter never to admit that shab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> parson again; I don't like to be teazed with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from such mean-looking people.</P>
<P>Mr. Bauble waits below, said the servant.</P>
<P>Desire Mr. Bauble to walk up&mdash;and when Miss L'Estrange comes, let me know.</P>
<P>The Jeweller entered, and in a few moments after Miss L'Estrange; whose levity of carriage, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>And is such a man, said I, as I left the house, is such a man as this a peer of the reason? can he, who ought to ornament the nation, thus shamefully dis|grace it!&mdash;Of all the crimes man can commit, in|gratitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> blackest; It argues a depravity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and insensible; it sets a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> creation&mdash;the animal word in gene|ral are grateful, affectionate, and faithful&mdash;But man&mdash;man, whose boasted reason makes him lord over those who act merely from instinct, loses his supe|riority by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olly and ingratitude&mdash;I am certain that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he man who is unmindful of a benefit conferred on him by a brother mortal, is totally destitute of grati|tude toward the great source of his life, health and prosperity.</P>

<HEAD>THE VISIT.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL go and see Teachum, said I, one day, after having recounted his story to my Emma&mdash;She would accompany me&mdash;</P>
<P>Their habitation was small, but every thing about it was neat to excess; there was nothing to be seen that spoke distress; the children were clean; Maria herself, though her attire was plain, appeared the model of elegance&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he was hearing her children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lesson; they stood before her, reading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> a verse from the sacred writings.</P>
<P>Teachum was leaning over the back of her chair, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at his children, with eyes expressive of as
<PB N="84" REF="026108_0080_0FCFAF9C245719C0">
much pleasure, and far more serenity, than the miser who contemplates his hoarded treasure&mdash;</P>
<P>We are come to spend an hour with you, said I, leading my Emma into the room.</P>
<P>Maria was embarrassed; but she was too polite to make unnecessary excuses concerning her dress or apartment&mdash;I always think such apologies are a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of reproof for an untimely visit.</P>
<P>Have you seen my Lord lately? said I.</P>
<P>He is never at home, replied Teachum.</P>
<P>I am sorry for it, said I; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> me, my friend, I think your attendance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> entirely unnecessary, and your hopes from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> fruit|less&mdash;I have taken the liberty of calling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> offer you any service that is in my power, and to beg you will look upon me as your friend. I shall hope to see you often at my house.</P>
<P>And I hope, said Emma, that Mrs. Teachum and my little friends here will always accompany you.</P>
<P>I have been sadly perplexed for these few days, said I, changing the conversation&mdash;I have got a ma|nuscript in my possession written in the Eastern lan|guage; I am certain it contains some extraordinary incidents, but cannot get at the particulars, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lmost entirely unacquainted with the characters it is wrote in.</P>
<P>It is lucky, said Teachum, that you have mention|ed it to me; I ever took great pleasure in studying the Eastern languages, and am a great admirer of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tile; it is simple and elegant, and though we may translate it with tolerable correctness, we can never entirely preserve its native purity&mdash;If you will put the manuscript into my hands I will use my en|deavours to translate it. I have many leisure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in which I amuse myself with my pen.</P>
<P>I was highly pleased with the idea of having the adventures of the poor Indian in my native language
<PB N="85" REF="026108_0081_0FCFAF9A48044EA0">
and desired Teachum to call on me next day; when fearful of paining them by a longer visit, we re|luctantly took our leave.</P>
<P>Emma, at parting, put something into the hand of the girl; and seeing I observed her, she took my hand when we were seated in the carriage&mdash;it was but a trifle, my love, said she; and I had saved it from my own private expences.</P>
<P>Had she just been giving away half my fortune, the look, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> manner in which she pronounced these words, would have instantly obtained forgive|ness.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE METHODIST.</HEAD>
<P>EMMA intended to call on several of her ac|quaintance.&mdash;I hate visits of ceremony&mdash;so alighting from the carriage, I strolled into the fields.</P>
<P>An itinerant preacher was mounted above a listen|ing multitude, bawling out the virtues and excellen|cies of charity, and strongly recommending brother|ly love among the elect&mdash;all his cry was faith and charity; at the same time he declared every one to be in a state of perdition that differed from his sect in their opinion concerning religious matters. I never was partial to people of this persuasion; not that I condemn the whole class&mdash;no, far be it from me to censure a large body of people, because some of the members are hypocrites.&mdash;I have known many people who profess Methodism, humane, charitable, and just; but they were people of enlarged ideas, and liberal education&mdash;the solemn gait&mdash;sanctified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">east eyes&mdash;and tongue ever ready with scrip|ture phrases and quotations, are by no means the signs of genuine piety.&mdash;A chearful, contented disposition&mdash;a heart grateful for every blessing, and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">gued to the all-wise dispensations of Providence
<PB N="86" REF="026108_0082_0FCF8D649E4CB6C0">
&mdash;and an hand ready to bestow on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> part of the blessings we enjoy ourselves;&mdash;the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> results of pure religion&mdash;these are acceptable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the sight of our Creator.</P>
<P>When the preacher had finished his oration, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> descended from the tub on which he had stood; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with his hat in his hand, walked round to his nu|merous congregation, every one warm with the im|pression made by his discourse, readily contribute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> something towards the support of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who was a eloquent in recommending them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the right way to eternal happiness.</P>
<P>The collection that was made must have amply repaid him for the time and breath he had spent in exhorting them to charity.</P>
<P>I should like to know, said I, whether this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> practises the virtue himself, he so strongly recom|mends to others.</P>
<P>I put on my ring and followed him home.</P>
<P>His habitation was at Chelsea&mdash;at his door he was met by a woman decently dressed, but dejected in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> countenance&mdash;her eyes were swolen with tears.</P>
<P>Well said the man, pushing rudely by her, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gone?</P>
<P>He is gone, she replied&mdash;gone for ever.</P>
<P>What, is he dead?</P>
<P>Yes.</P>
<P>And in my house&mdash;why was he not removed to the work house?</P>
<P>Alas, Sir, replied the woman, the parish officer came to take him away; and the exertions he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to rise and dress himself being too much for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> weak frame, he expired as they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to the chair.</P>
<P>And, who will pay for the funeral?</P>
<P>The parish will.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="026108_0083_0FCFAF9920D3A020">
And, do you think he shall go out of this house till I am paid my rent?&mdash;No, no, as he has died here, he shall stay till every farthing owing me is discharg|ed.&mdash;Have you got any money now?</P>
<P>Not one half penny, or a morsel of bread for my poor children&mdash;But I will fell my bed&mdash;it is the last thing I have left, and we will henceforth sleep on straw.</P>
<P>You shall sell nothing&mdash;touch nothing till I am paid.&mdash;What, do you think I am to lose a whole year's rent?</P>
<P>Have you no compassion on a poor widow and six fatherless children? said the woman.</P>
<P>I do not know what business such poor folks have to get children, he replied. Go, go along, woman; I am going to dinner, and cannot be troubled with your whining and complaints.</P>
<P>I took off my ring; and following the poor wo|man up stairs, gave her something to quiet the ap|prehensions her inhuman landlord's discourse had in|spired.</P>
<P>As I passed from the staircase to the street door, I heard this teacher of charity pouring forth a long grace over his meat.</P>
<P>Hypocritical wretch! said I, dost thou think this lip service is acceptable to God?&mdash;Mistaken man, thou art mocking the Lord of the universe.&mdash;Go, divide your meal with the widow and the fatherless&mdash;it is the best way of shewing your gratitude to him who gave it you.</P>
<P>Such men as this, said I, as I left the house are a great deal more prejudicial to society than the pro|fessed libertine. When we see a man neglect all religious duties&mdash;break through all ties moral and divine, we naturally turn from him with horror and detestation.&mdash;But, when a man under the cloak of piety and virtue, who professes a just sense of religi|on,
<PB N="88" REF="026108_0084_0FCFAF969164FCD8">
is discovered to be hard-hearted&mdash;oppressive&mdash;avaricious&mdash;selfish&mdash;in short, living in the private practice of every vice he publicly declaims against; is it not enough to make the generality of the world conclude that religion is no more than a specious mask put on to deceive mankind?</P>
<P>Religion, in her own native simplicity, is truly lovely&mdash;she attracts admiration&mdash;charms the soul by her precepts&mdash;and passing with us through life blunts the points of those arrows of affliction which it is the lot of every mortal to experience.</P>
<P>But, hypocrisy too often puts on her pleasing garb; and, when discovered, leads mankind to think the angel face of piety hides the foul fiend beneath.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE STUDY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Teachum was in my study full half an hour before I came down.&mdash;Well, my friend, said I, as I entered, don't you think I have got a fine parcel of writings?&mdash;Here in this drawer, pointing to one that was partly open, I keep all my heroic poetry&mdash;here is another for plays&mdash;another for odes, son|nets, pastorals, &amp;c.&mdash;What a charming prize these would be to some garreted author; he might sell all this waste paper for at least two pence a pound&mdash;it would then turn to some account, for it might serve to wrap penny worths of tobacco&mdash;light pipes, fires, &amp;c. or, in short, be applied to any other use the possessor might want waste paper for.</P>
<P>What an humiliating idea! said my friend, smil|ing.</P>
<P>Not at all, said I; in following the dictates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> imagination, and employing my pen, I please, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a|muse myself&mdash;but if my writings are not so lucky as to please and amuse others, why should I be mortifi|ed?&mdash;every man has a peculiar taste; and be|tween
<PB N="89" REF="026108_0085_0FCFAF9581EE5AB0">
you and I, my friend, every man has a pecu|liar hobby-horse, on which he frequently mounts, and rides away post haste, without once considering who he may discompose, overturn, or offend in the wild career.</P>
<P>I know one man, who, though possessed of a very moderate fortune, and who has had but a confined education, is so fond of aping the insolent carriage of a Lord, that he is continually distressing his com|panions by affected grimaces, and st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed gestures&mdash;then he speaks in such a pompous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and assumes such an all of consequence, that while he thinks he is received with admiration, every man of sense must laugh at his folly.</P>
<P>Another is fond of displaying his profound learn|ing in the different sciences&mdash;at one time he is a pro|fessor of music&mdash;at another time he studies logic; and when by chance you mention either of those sci|ences, he will run on at least two hours without ei|ther taking breath, or giving you an opportunity to edge in a single word.</P>
<P>These are their hobby horses&mdash;writing is mine. I would not give up the pleasure of writing for any pecuniary gratification that could be offered.</P>
<P>That is, said my friend, because you stand in need of no pecuniary favours; but, ask the poor au|thor, who, in an airy apartment, three stories from she ground, sits invoking the coy muses to assist him in writing something to gain him a few guineas that might serve to satisfy his butcher, baker, &amp;c.&mdash;ask him, my good friend, if he will give up the pleasure of writing, to enjoy a settled salary of sixty pounds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>He might readily promise to do so, said I; but take my word for it, the very first time pen, ink, pa|per, and opportunity sell in his way, he would write
<PB N="90" REF="026108_0086_0FCF8D5C6AB82840">
an eulogium on the man who had thus generously raised him from distress.</P>
<P>Oh, ye sweet tuneful sisters, may ye never forsake my mansion; but when on the wing to visit your favourites&mdash;Burney, Moore, and Inchbald&mdash;stop for a moment, and dart a single ray of your sacred fire upon the humblest of your votaries&mdash;in a sad hour it will enliven me&mdash;in a lonely hour, amuse&mdash;and, when happiness deigns to be my companion, it will increase every pleasure.</P>
<P>But come, said I to Teachum, here is the story I wish you to translate.&mdash;I am going out for a few hours, and shall hope to see it in fair English cha|racters when I come back.&mdash;You shall see part of it at least, said he. So I left him; and mounting my horse which was at the door, rode into Hyde Park.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE FRACAS.</HEAD>
<P>ON my entering the Park, I saw at a distance, a multiplicity of people, some running one way, some another, and all in the utmost confusion.&mdash;I rode up to the place, and the first thing that presented itself to my view, was Miss L'Estrange in a fit; and a few paces from her, a young man laying on the ground, bleeding. By his side knelt the fair mourner whom I had seen in Kensington Gardens&mdash;she was endea|vouring to staunch the blood that issued from his side, with her handkerchief&mdash;it seemed a scene of confusi|on, for no one was paying the least attention to the wounded man but this unhappy woman.</P>
<P>I called my servant, and giving him my horse, raised the young man from the ground; and present|ly perceived it was Lord Ernolf, whom Teachum had attended abroad.</P>
<P>I assisted the fair mourner to bind up his wound with our handkerchiefs, and a servant at that mo|ment
<PB N="91" REF="026108_0087_0FCFAF9392B50448">
arriving with a surgeon and a litter, we lifted him on it, and proceeded to the nearest house&mdash;the surgeon thinking the sooner his wound was dressed the better.</P>
<P>The mourner followed pensively&mdash;often crossing herself, sighing, and weeping bitterly&mdash;no one at|tempted to obstruct her entrance into the house with us.</P>
<P>The wound was dressed, and the surgeon pro|nounced it not dangerous, provided a fever could be prevented.</P>
<P>Lord Ernolf had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ainted through loss of blood; and during the time of his wound being dressed, re|mained in a state of insensibility.</P>
<P>It was judged proper that he should be immedi|ately put to bed; but, when the servant attempted to move him, the mourner came to me and en|treated that she might not be separated from him&mdash;for, indeed Sir, said she, I heartily forgive him&mdash;I do not wish his death now, though once I sought to have assassinated him; but I have since been taught that we should forgive those who injured us. Alas! if it were not for the reflection that I am not at enmi|ty with any mortal breathing, how should I have hope to obtain pardon of my Creator for the heinous, crime I have committed whilst in pursuit of my revenge!</P>
<P>I thought from these few words that this hapless mourner could be no other than poor Leonilla.&mdash;I entreated the people of the house to let her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">main with the wounded nobleman; and attended her up to his chamber, where he was in bed, and just <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> covering his senses.</P>
<P>She approached the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and sitting down on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> took one of his hands&mdash;kissed it, and pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed it to her bosom.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> his languid eyes, and fixed them on her
<PB N="92" REF="026108_0088_0FCF8D59B80B1778">
face&mdash;at first they spoke amazement and terror&mdash;but at last, grief.</P>
<P>Where am I? said he&mdash;am I passing the bounds of mortality; and art thou, blest shade, suffered to conduct me through the gloomy vale?&mdash;I know why you look so mournful&mdash;you died of a broken heart&mdash;but, I shall be punished for my crimes.</P>
<P>Compose yourself, my Lord, said the mourner&mdash;you are in no danger, I hope you may yet live ma|ny years, and be happy.</P>
<P>Do you talk o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> happiness, said he; and do you wish me happy?</P>
<P>I do! I do! So Heaven hear my prayers.</P>
<P>But, tell me, said he, how came you here?&mdash;am I not in England?</P>
<P>She was going to answer&mdash;when I interposed and begged they would both be silent, and consider of what dangerous consequences a violent exertion of spirits might be to the young gentleman. She pro|mised obedience, drew the curtains round the bed, and sat down in an easy chair that stood at the head. A nurse entering, I took that opportunity to go and inquire what had been the cause of this unhappy affair.</P>
<P>The servant who attended Miss L'Estrange and his Lordship in their ride that morning, gave me the following account:</P>
<P>That a strange gentleman rode up to Miss L'Es|trange, and accosting her in a very haughty manner, inquired why she had left him at Paris, and what she had done with a miniature picture which she had taken from his cabinet the morning before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he left him; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Lady pretended not to know him, and complained to my Lord that she was insulted; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which, high words ensued between the strange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Lord Ernolf, when the former, having a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> pistols ready in his pocket, offered one to my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="93" REF="026108_0089_0FCFAF925EAF7BE8">
who being naturally of a warm disposition, took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and before any interposition could be made, they both fired; my Lord's pistol took no effect, but the stranger's wounded him in the manner you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. At the discharge of the pistols Miss L'Estrange faint|ed; but I believe, it was more for fear of the life of the gentleman than my Lord's. I ran as fast as I could for a surgeon.&mdash;</P>
<P>The servant was proceeding in his story when he was called away.</P>
<P>Having gained this intelligence, I determined to go immediately to Miss L'Estrange, who was now become an inmate of Lord Ernolf's house, and see in what manner she behaved, and whether the ser|vant's suspicions were well founded</P>
<P>I repaired immediately to his Lordship's house&mdash;inquired for the lady, but was denied admittance&mdash;a chariot and lour was at the door&mdash;I feared some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> play; and thinking there was no time to be lost, I watched my opportunity, and, putting on my ring, went into the house, and up to the Lady's apartment. I found her sitting on a sopha with a large quantity of jewels, &amp;c. on a table before her; she was busied in packing them up, but often turned and addressed some endearing expressions to an officer who sat be|side her, entreating him never to forsake her again, and telling him what riches she had heaped together since she had lived with Lord Ernolf.</P>
<P>I examined the features of the pretended officer, and in spite of a large black patch which he had over one eye, and his eye-brows and complexion being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ained, I soon discovered it to be the villain Cogdie, who had escaped from the officers of justice as they were conveying him from Gretna Green to London:</P>
<P>I learned from the conversation that passed be|tween Cogdie and Miss L'Estrange, that she was in reality his lawful wife; but, being of a loose dis|position,
<PB N="94" REF="026108_0090_0FCF8D57E9F5D240">
had broken the matrimonial bonds some years since, and visited most of the capitals in Eu|rope with a young nobleman, whose fortune she had ruined, and finding him no longer able to support her extravagance, she had left Paris with Lord Ernolf, with whom she had lived for this twelve-month past.</P>
<P>I found, also, that chance had thrown Cogdie in her way; and that he, seeing her in so prosperous a situation, and being himself at a very low ebb of for|tune, had persuaded her that his passion for her was stronger than ever, and endeavoured to prevail with her to rob the Earl, and decamp with him.&mdash;But L'Estrange was a woman whose avarice was not so easily gratified: she, by feigning the most passionate tenderness for the Earl, had worked upon his temper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill she persuaded him to make a will greatly in her favour; and then the insult, &amp;c. which happened in the Park, was planned and executed by Cogdie. He had marked the pistols; the one he gave to Lord Ernolf was charged only with powder, but that which he retained himself was loaded with ball.</P>
<P>I was greatly at a loss how to act, as I feared to leave the house to procure proper persons to secure Cogdie, lest in the mean time he should escape.</P>
<P>L'Estrange told him he ought to prepare for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light; and giving him several bank notes, some jew|els, and other valuables, stepped into another room and brought out a gown, petticoats, &amp;c. for him to put on.&mdash;I was quite undetermined in what manner to prevent his departure, when L'Estrange recollect|ed there was some more money in a bureau in Lord Ernolf's apartment, which was in a distant part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he house; I followed and seeing her safe in the closet, in which there was no bell, and only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> high window, and that secured with bars; I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the door, locked and bolted it; I then return <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="95" REF="026108_0091_0FCFAF8FE9693628">
haste to the apartment where Cogdie was, and seeing him totally absorbed in the pleasure of contemplating his treasure, fastened both the doors without being observed.</P>
<P>Having succeeded thus far, I left the house with precipitation, and procured proper people to appre|hend them; I returned within half an hour, and de|manded entrance. Though I had been absent so short a time, five minutes longer had been too late; Cogdie and L'Estrange had by their cries alarmed the servant; for each fearing the other intended in|formation against themselves, were in the utmost consternation; and violent were their cries for li|berty&mdash;the servants had burst open the doors, and Cogdie was on the stairs in order to depart when I entered.</P>
<P>I committed them both to the charge of the con|stable; having first cased them of the weighty con|cern of having so much money and jewels to take off. I waited on them to the house of a neighbour|ing justice, made my accusation in proper form, and being certain that apartments in a strong, well-built mansion, would be prepared for their reception till farther inquiry should be made concerning the af|fair, I left them, and returned to the wounded No|blemen; and from thence home.</P>

<HEAD>THE REPARATION.</HEAD>
<P>I THOUGHT you were lost, my love, said Emma, as I entered the parlour about eleven o'clock, and found her seated at supper with Teachum and his Maria.&mdash;In my hurry and confusion in the morn|ing, though I had sent my servant home. I had not sent any message by him: I was therefore not sur|prised at my Emma's exclamation. The adventures of the day had so entirely taken up my mind, that
<PB N="96" REF="026108_0092_0FCFAF8E49C5F7E8">
the East Indian had not once intruded; and even when my friend mentioned having almost completed the translation, I felt no sort of curiosity to see it.&mdash;We will take a walk to-morrow, said I to Teach|um; I have seen Lord Ernolf to-day, and if you like, I will take you to visit him early.</P>
<P>We were at the house where he was before ten o'clock.</P>
<P>As we entered the room without noise, we saw the fair Leonilla in the highest act of devotion; his Lordship was sitting in the bed, supported by pillows, his eyes fixed with a mixture of love and veneration on her face, we were unwilling to disturb them, so drew back behind the curtains. When she had fi|nished her morning orisons&mdash;Oh, my dear Lord! said she, what a relief do you give my almost burst|ing heart, by informing me that your governor is not dead. How severe has the reflection always been, that my rashness had sent a deserving man out of the world; a man who had honor, courage, affection, sufficient to make him value his own life as nothing when the life of his Lord was in danger. It is that cruel idea, and the remembrance of my dear father and mother, that at times deprives me of my reason; but I will be thankful to that good Providence that has taken this mighty load off my heart.</P>
<P>I hope you have provided for Mr. Teachum, said she, after a little pause.</P>
<P>It is a shame to own I have not, said my Lord; but I will endeavour to repair all my errors.</P>
<P>Mr. Teachum is come to see you, my Lord, said I, stopping forward.</P>
<P>Ernolf stretched out his hand, and taking hold of Teachum's, cried, this wound, my good Dr. Teach|um, is an excellent thing.</P>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, replied Teachum, I do not be|lieve any body but yourself thinks so, all your friends regret it.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="026108_0093_0FCF8D5685C74B38">
I rejoice in it, said his Lordship, it makes me feelingly remember my own ingratitude.</P>
<P>Teachum walked to the other end of the room&mdash;he was too much of a Christian to rejoice in the pain of a fellow mortal, though it might be productive of good to himself. After our noble patient's wound was again dressed, he requested Leonilla to inform him why she had left her native country.</P>
<P>She said, that when she found by the rumour then prevailing at Madrid, that Mr. Teachum was killed in defending his Lordship, it lay very heavy at her heart, and she grew melancholy and sickly.&mdash;I ne|ver went to sleep, said she, but I fancied the shade of the innocent man my rashness had murdered, was reproaching me. I thought my mind would be ea|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er after confession, and went to my holy father, confessed my first deviation from duty, my grief, an|ger, revenge, and all its fatal consequences.&mdash;The good father rebuked the spirit of revenge that still was harboured, in my bosom, and taught me that pe|nitence, fasting, and tears, were the only methods to gain the pardon of the Creator for my heinous of|fences&mdash;but alas! Sir, I could not pray&mdash;my mind was in a state of horror, not to be described&mdash;re|morse, love, and rage, by turns tormented my soul; but Heaven offended at my obstinacy and folly&punc; visit|ed me with a dreadful judgment.&mdash;I had a favourite dog which you had given me; on this poor inoffen|sive animal did I vent the various changes of my temper, one moment caressing it, the next using it with the utmost barbarity. My dear mother had ne|ver suspected my dishonour; she wondered o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> so visible in my health and disposition; and frequently chid me for my unkindness to this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> little animal. I fear I used it very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">l; but, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I hardly know what I did, my mind was so disordered.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="026108_0094_0FCFAF8D010D5150">
My dog ran mad, and bit my dear mother; all medical assistance was tried without effect&mdash;she ex|pired in the greatest agony. My father who was on a campaign against the Turks at the time this happened, unfortunately retured the day before my mother was buried&mdash;he was unrepared for the stroke he saw my mother's corpse&mdash;he saw me deprived of my senses.</P>
<P>In my delirium I told him how I had dishonored his house&mdash;It was too much; he was not equal to the mighty load of sorrow, but sunk under it.</P>
<P>Since that, I have wandered about, over barren hills and desert plains, seeking content, but she fled from me as I pursued her. I thought she might dwell with charity; so I divided my portion with the fatherless and the widow; but alas! I could ne|ver find her&mdash;she is buried in the grave with my dear parents!</P>
<P>I saw that the recital of her misfortunes had occasion|ed a return of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">happy malady; so taking her by her hand, I led her into another apartment, and persuaded her to take some repose.</P>
<P>About six weeks after, I had the pleasure of be|stowing her in marriage on the repentant Lord Er|nolf. Teachum performed the ceremony; and his Lord gave him as a marriage portion, the promised living of Wiltham.</P>
<P>Leonilla never after relapsed into her former dis|ordered state of mind. She entreated that Cogdie and his companions might be forgiven. Her Lord complied with her request; and she gave them a sum of money, to prevent poverty being an incen|tive to future vice. But they were too far immerg|ed in all manner of deceit to think of amendment, and soon returned to their old practices.</P>
<P>I cannot help here relating a circumstance tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> happened many years after.&mdash;The son <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="99" REF="026108_0095_0FCFAF899D20E8C0">
brought into the world, the fruit of her unfortunate attachment to Cogdie, as he advanced in years, shew|ed no signs of any of his father's vices in his dispo|sition, except a propensity to gaming.&mdash;This propen|sity he once indulged at a public gaming house, where an old man having won from him a consider|able sum of money, which the young spark imagin|ing was not won by fair play; high words arose, and a challenge was given.</P>
<P>They met, fired, and the old man was wounded.&mdash;The son of Olivia, though hasty in his temper, was generous, humane, and forgiving; he wished not to take the life even of the man who had wrong|ed him.</P>
<P>He had him carried to his lodgings; and finding him in a poor situation, he sent for a surgeon, and supplied him with all the necessaries and comforts of life at his own expence.</P>
<P>A servant in the family who observed the frequent visits of Olivia's son to this mean, obscure lodging, told it as a secret to Olivia's maid, who directly told it to her mistress.</P>
<P>Olivia was then at my house; she had often wish|ed an union might take place between her son and Lucy Heartfree, my fair petitioner. The idea of a secret mistress immediately alarmed her.&mdash;She desir|ed me to go with her to the place the servant had mentioned.</P>
<P>I complied.</P>
<P>When we entered the room, the first object that truck our sight was her son helping a woman to lift an infirm, sickly old man from a chair to the bed; he was, to all appearance, near his end.</P>
<P>The old man no sooner saw us than he breathed a dreadful groan, and fell back in his chair. Olivia was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> agitated&mdash;she applied her salts to his nose.&mdash;He recovered&mdash;he gazed feebly on her. It

<P>Gracious Heaven! cried Olivia&punc; catching hold of her son's hand, it is your father.</P>
<P>My father! said the youth; then I am a par|ricide.</P>
<P>Not so, my son, answered Cogdie; you have only revenged your mother's injuries.&mdash;But, will you for|give me.</P>
<P>May heaven forgive you as freely, said Oli|via.</P>
<P>Her son knelt, and craved forgiveness of his dy|ing father.</P>
<P>It is enough said Cogdie. I forgive, and hope to be forgiven.&mdash;His head sunk on Olivia's shoulder&mdash;he groaned and expired.</P>

<P>I THINK you have never read Mr. Teachum's translation, said Emma, one evening, as I was sit|ting by her, listening to the innocent prattle of Har|riet and her little companion&mdash;I had some months before committed them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o the care of Mrs.&mdash;of Hammersmith.</P>
<P>Though I had always heard the highest character of this lady and her school, yet my dear Harriet, who at this time was at home for the holidays, raised it in my opinion&mdash;Lucy, said he, let us play at school&mdash;you shall be Mrs.&mdash;, and I will be a scho|lar.</P>
<P>You may always judge by the play of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what company, regulations, and conversation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are used to.</P>

Come, Ladies, it is eight o'clock, and not all dressed yet!&mdash;Oh fye! Miss, your face and hands are not washed!&mdash;how indelicate that is!&mdash;well, now we are all ready&mdash;so you must kneel down and say your prayers.</P>
<P>Do you always say your prayers at school, Harri|et? said I.</P>
<P>Oh, yes, Papa; Mrs.&mdash;not only makes us say our prayers, but she says her own prayers with us.</P>
<P>Do you love Mrs.&mdash;, my dear?</P>
<P>Yes, indeed, Papa&mdash;I don't know any body but what does love her, she is so good to us all.</P>
<P>I was so pleased with the account the children gave of this amiable woman, that by means of my ring I frequently visited her unseen&mdash;there was al|ways the same decent regularity observed through the whole house.</P>
<P>She had a relation lived with her&mdash;I would men|tion some acts of humanity which I have seen this relation perform, but I fear to hurt her delicacy&mdash;Yet there is one which will never be erased from my mind. It was the kindness she shewed to a poor young woman who was distressed, calumniated, and beset with dangers&mdash;Yet she knew not the full force of her benevolence; But I, who visited, unseen, the object of her humanity, know, that she drew her from an horrid precipice, from whence she must have soon plunged into the gulf of infamy.</P>

<HEAD>SADI AND ZELIA.</HEAD>
<P>SADI, the son of Mahadan, the rich possessor of a fertile valley, watered by a beautiful river&mdash;who had slaves at his command, and was called by the sons of the East, Sadi the Happy.&mdash;Ah! what avails possessions and treasure?&mdash;and what is terrestrial hap|piness to man?&mdash;It vanisheth like a dream&mdash;it de|parteth like the mist of the morning before the beams of the sun.</P>
<P>Sadi, the once rich and happy, is a slave and wretched.&mdash;Go tell this to the daughters of joy&mdash;sound it in the ears of the sons of pleasure; for pros|perity has hardened their hearts&punc; and made them cal|lous to the feelings of humanity.</P>
<P>Zelia was the fairest among the daughters of Ara|bia; she was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ll, and straight as the pine tree; stately as the young cedar; her skin was like the ripe olive; her eyes, bright stars; her locks were like the polished <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; and her teeth, fair rows of pearl; her lips were the colour of the ruby; and her breath like the breezes blowing from the spicy islands.</P>
<P>I built a bower for my Zelia; I adorned it with beautiful flowers, and planted sweet smelling shrubs around it.</P>
<P>With lofty trees I fenced out the sun beams <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the birds dwelt in their branches.&mdash;In the recess was a silver stream; the osiers and wild flowers hung <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on its banks, and the swans sported on its bosom.</P>

<P>We were the happiest among the happy; in the morning we arose together and worshipped the bright luminary of day.&mdash;We strayed over the fertile valleys&mdash;we sported with the young fawns; or re|tired from the heat, and reposed in the thick shade.</P>
<P>If I was in pain, she would sooth me.&mdash;I listened to her angel voice all day; and at night I reposed on her bosom.</P>
<P>The curtain of night had fallen over us&mdash;the stars shot their beams through the Heavens&mdash;the voice of distress met our ears&mdash;the plaints of sorrow invaded our dwelling&mdash;we went forth from the bower&mdash;we saw a Christian overpowered by his adversary.

<P>THIS is a strange world, said I, laying down the manuscript, and addressing my dear Emma&mdash;</P>
<P>The world, my love, she replied, laying one hand on my shoulder, and with the other wiping away a drop which poor Sadi's story had excited&mdash;the world, my love, in itself is a charming place&mdash;it is the people in it that makes it uncomfortable. Let us view it at first coming from the hands of the Crea|tor; what beauty, what regularity and order! but no sooner was man created, than pride&mdash;ava|rice&mdash;envy&mdash;revenge&mdash;and a long train of e|vils&mdash;</P>
<P>Not forgetting female vanity and curiosity, said I, looking archly at her.&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, my dear, said she, don't attribute all your evils to our sex; for I am certain, that had not Adam, had a little curiosity in his own composition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ne|ver could have been prevailed on to stray from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> duty&mdash;but we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">unning from the subject, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> she.</P>

My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was, that it is the vile disposition of many people in the world, not the world itself, that is so disagreeable to those who are possessed of humani|ty and feeling. What a delightful place it would be, said I, if harmony, peace, and love universally reigned around us; if there was no ingratitude, no revenge, no rapine, murder, theft, or perjury.</P>
<P>It would, said she; but it is not for us to say why are things thus? let us, my love, endeavour to per|form our duty, and, as far as example will go, lead others to do the same; and let us be thankful that the world is not so full of allurements as to prevent our preparing and hoping for a better: for my own part, continued she, passing her arm round my neck, while her lovely countenance beamed with gratitude and love, my cup overflows with blessings; I feel no sorrow except it is when I reflect on the vices or sor|rows of my fellow creatures; yet, I must not expect to pass this life exempt from woe.&mdash;Poor Sadi has had a life of misery, it is true, but shall we arraign the power omnipotent, and say, why was it so?</P>
<P>My dear, Emma, said I, I did not mean to com|plain of the dispensations, of Providence when I said it is a strange world; but does it not appear wonder|ful that a man can so far forget a benefit as to treat his benefactor with cruelty?</P>
<P>It is unaccountable, said she; and yet we hear of it in more instances than one&mdash;what a striking proof of ingratitude is related in Addison's pathetic story on Incle and Yarico&mdash;</P>
<P>Oh, a propos, said I, you never gave me your opi|nion of the opera taken from that story&mdash;</P>
<P>I was greatly pleased with it, she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eplied; I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> author shews great judgment in the manage|ment of his plot; for after having ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ted in our imagination a proper horror for the avarice and in|gratitude of Incle, by contrasting it with the blunt

honesty of Trudge, he makes his hero repent, and, by unexpectedly bringing him to act with honor and humanity towards his kind preserver, leaves no im|pression on the mind of the audience but an entire love and admiration of virtue.</P>
<P>I think the remark extremely just, said I, which Incle makes in the conclusion of the piece&mdash;that, his contracted ideas, and grasping disposition, was chief|ly owing to his education.&mdash;</P>
<P>There is nothing, replied my Emma, which, in my opinion, should be so carefully inculcated in the mind of a child as humanity&mdash;there are many pa|rents who, out of a mistaken fondness for their chil|dren, will suffer them, by way of amusement, to rob birds nests, catch butterflies, &amp;c. and transfix them with pins, and a thousand other whims and fancies which are the height of cruelty; these things by de|grees harden their hearts, and they can afterwards practise cruelty on their fellow creatures without re|pugnance.&mdash;I would always teach my children to be tender even to the smallest insect that has life; if, indeed, they are obnoxious or poisonous, and self-preservation leads us to destroy them, let them be dispatched quick and with as little pain as possible.&mdash;Then opening a volume of our inimitable Shake|speare, she read the following passage in Measure for Measure:

<HEAD>THE REGISTER OFFICE.</HEAD>
<P>I HOPE you will not disappoint me, Madam, said a young woman to an old fat dame, who kept a Register Office for hiring of servants&mdash;I had entered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he house by means of my ring.</P>
<P>The young woman was something below the mid|dle size, her countenance was dejected, and she ap|peared not to be used to servitude.</P>
<P>You had better sit down and rest yourself, my dear, said the old woman.</P>
<P>I will, if you please, replied the other; for it is a long walk from Lambeth.</P>
<P>She entered a little parlour, and sat down; when I learnt from their conversation that the young wo|man, whom I shall henceforth call Mariana, was ap|plying for a place as governess to one or two young ladies, and was promised by the woman who kept the office that she should be recommended to Lady Allworth, who wanted a governess for her two daughters.</P>
<P>It is now six weeks, said Mariana, since I was first proposed to Lady Allworth, and I should be glad to know whether she will have me or no, for my cir|cumstances are such as render it absolutely necessary that I should have some place in a short time&mdash;To|morrow, Mrs. L&mdash;y, I hope you will go with me.</P>
<P>The old woman promised faithfully to attend her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ten o'clock the next morning was appointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her to call.</P>
<P>Then to-morrow I will see thee again, poor, gen|tle Mariana, said I.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="026108_0106_0FCFAF7344364710">
I was by no means pleased with the woman who kept the office; for while Mariana was resting her|self, two young men of fashion came into the room.</P>
<P>I blush to think, that their being young men of fashion rendered me uneasy on the poor girl's ac|count.</P>
<P>There were some very intelligent looks passed be|tween them and the old woman; and immediately on their leaving the room Mariana was invited to dine the ensuing day.</P>
<P>At ten, the next day, Mariana again repaired to the office, and was again disappointed of waiting on Lady Allworth.</P>
<P>I know not what to do, said she, as she left the house; and a tear stole down her cheek&mdash;She had refused the invitation to dinner, and was proceeding with melancholy step<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> towards her home&mdash;I follow|ed her.</P>
<P>When she entered the house she was wet, cold, and hungry; but there was neither fire nor refresh|ment.</P>
<P>She sat down at the end of a long table, and lean|ing her head upon her hands, the tears flowed plen|teously down her pale face&mdash;she looked the picture of dumb despair.</P>
<P>I was thinking of some method to relieve her, when a short, fat old gentleman entered the room.</P>
<P>I read in your face, Mariana, said he, that you have had no success to-day.&mdash;</P>
<P>She shook her head, and asked his advice how to proceed.</P>
<P>I would advise you to go to Lady Allworth your|self&mdash;write a letter, send it up, and wait for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an|swer from her ladyship.</P>
<P>Mariana wiped her eyes, wrote a letter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> proceeded to measure back the weary steps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> before.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="026108_0107_0FCF8D4FB6F941E8">
Poor girl! said I, as I followed her, I should like to know how you were reduced to this situation; but I will not leave you till I see you are likely to get some settlement&mdash;Youth and innocence without friends or money, in such a place as London, must have a hard struggle to keep free from vice; and will find it impossible to keep free from censure.</P>
<P>I wish Lady Allworth may be as much prepos|sessed in your favour as I am&mdash;but perhaps she will not see you; and should she not, you shall not be l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">st for want of a friend.</P>
<P>I do verily believe, that during our walk from Lambeth to St. James's Street, I was almost as much agitated as Mariana herself.</P>
<P>She tapped modestly at the door; but I could see it was humiliating to her.</P>
<P>A servant appeared, and she was instantly admit|ted&mdash;</P>
<P>Will you deliver this to Lady Allworth? said she, presenting the letter.</P>
<P>The servant looked at her with compassion&mdash;I thus translated his looks: this poor girl is come to entreat a favour of my Lady; I will not be the means of her not obtaining it; I wish she may meet with success.</P>
<P>Sir James Allworth, said I, is a benevolent man: he never suffers a petitioner to be treated with rude|ness or disrespect: I can read his humanity in the countenance of his domestic.</P>
<P>I had hardly time for the reflection before Marl|and was desired to walk up stairs&mdash;I perceived that she trembled as she ascended; but had her fears been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> so great, they must all have vanished at the sight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Lady Allworth.</P>

<HEAD>THE DRESSING ROOM.</HEAD>
<P>SHE was an elegant woman, though arrived to an age when the bloom and sprightliness of youth is past; yet her face had a benignity about it that dif|fused itself over all her features, and seemed enliven|ed by a ray of celestial light; her fine black eyes were of that sort that would pierce the inmost reces|ses of a guilty soul, but withal, tempered with so much benevolence, that to the innocent they seemed to beam only with humanity and compassion.&mdash;Her form was majestic, and in her manner was a mix|ture of dignity, ease, and sweetness.</P>
<P>Mariana's countenance brightened up when she saw this lovely woman&mdash;she curtised, and a feint blush tinged her cheeks&mdash;</P>
<P>You are the person who wrote this letter? asked her Ladyship.</P>
<P>Yes, Madam.</P>
<P>Pray, who was it that pretended to recommend you to me?</P>
<P>Mariana informed her.</P>
<P>Good God! cried Lady Allworth; I know no|thing of the woman; I never applied to her for a servant in my life; and should never have thought of applying to an office for a governess.</P>
<P>Mariana turned pale, and with difficulty restrained her tears.</P>
<P>But pray, continued her Ladyship, pray, Ma'am, inform me how you came to apply to an office:&mdash;have you no friends?</P>
<P>But one, Madam, and she is not in a line to re|commend me.</P>

<P>Pray, sit down, Ma'am continued her Ladyship, and, if it is not disagreeable, inform me how you came into such a place as London without friends: I feel myself interested in your behalf, and if it is in my power I will serve you.</P>
<P>Mariana sat down, and with a voice of timidity, accompanied with a look of gratitude, in a few words, acquainted Lady Allworth with her story.</P>
<P>My father, Madam, is an officer in the army; my mother dying while I was yet an infant, my fa|ther married a lady in America, who brought him an ample fortune&mdash;he took me over to America when only eight years old, and we remained there in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">most harmony till the unhappy breach between Great Britain and her Colonies.

<P>Stop a moment, said Lady Allworth&mdash;sit down again&mdash;you must want some refreshment.</P>
<P>A glass of wine and a biscuit was ordered.</P>
<P>Call on me again in a day or two, said her Lady|ship; I will try to do something for you; in the mean time accept of this trifle.</P>
<P>I could not see what she put into her hand; but I am sure it was the manner of the giver, not the gift itself, that sunk so deep into Mariana's heart: it was that which made her exclaim as she left the house&mdash;Dear Lady, when I forget my obligations, to thee, may I cease to live.</P>
<P>Lady Allworth kept her word, and recommended Mariana to a Lady in whose family she remained till ill health obliged her to quit it.</P>
<P>Ye fair daughters of Britain, whose charms are the theme of every tongue, the admiration of every eye, and whose praise is sounded to the most distant kingdoms, learn from the amiable behaviour of a Lady Allworth, how to attain those charms which neither time nor accident can diminish&mdash;the beau|ties of that Lady's person might have rendered her universally admired; but it is the goodness of her heart alone that could create universal love and ve|neration.</P>

at the door&mdash;I had time on my hands, so being rather curious to be present at a female tete-a-tete, I put on my ring, and when the door was opened I entered with the visitor.</P>
<P>She was hardly seated, before, observing the writ|ing apparatus, she says, So my dear Ellen, you are exercising your fertile genius&mdash;you are certainly a charming girl!&mdash;what would I not give to possess such a talent&mdash;pray, may I see your performance, or will you be so obliging as to read it to me?</P>
<P>Ellen took up the paper, threw it on the win|dow, and said, it was only a sonnet not worth look|ing at&mdash;</P>
<P>Oh, you sad girl? how can you mortify me so? I am sure if the sonnet is the production of your own genius it must be delightful&mdash;pray do let me see it.</P>
<P>If it will give you any pleasure, said Ellen, I will read it to you;&mdash;but, I assure you, it is but a trifle&mdash;she took it up and read&mdash;

And when she appear'd upon earth,</L>
<L>Each virtue approvingly smil'd.</L></Q></P>
<P>Oh, 'tis divine! exclaimed the visitor, whose name I found was Greenham;&mdash;pray, my dear El|len, favour me with a copy or it.</P>
<P>Ellen promised to comply with her request.</P>
<P>I wonder, said Mrs. Greenham, why you don't publish your works; it is a thousand pities such charming poems as you in general write should be buried in oblivion.</P>
<P>I sometimes, said Ellen, think I will lay some of my little productions before the impartial public&punc; but I am quite terrified at the idea of exposing my|self to the ridicule of my own sex or the satire of the other.&mdash;</P>
<P>You are too humble, my sweet friend, cries Mrs. Greenham, there is not the least occasion for your fears&mdash;I am certain your works would be universal|ly read and admired; and it will be injustice both to yourself and the world, to deprive them of the grati|fication of perusing them, and yourself of the same you would certainly acquire and undoubtedly de|serve.</P>
<P>It is rather surprising, thought I, that one woman should be so liberal in the praises of another.&mdash;I looked intently in Mrs. Greenham's face; and me-thought I read dissimulation in every feature&mdash;I took an attentive view of Ellen, and plainly discovered that she saw through the thin veil of her visitor's flattery; and though she could not but listen to her with silent civility, she, in her heart, despised her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and ill nature much less than the specious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with which she endeavoured to cover them.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Greenham took her leave, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her; determined to hear in what manner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="117" REF="026108_0113_0FCFAF66ACA4F480">
spoke of Ellen when absent from her. She went immediately home and entertained her husband and several visitors at the expence of the inoffensive El|len.</P>
<P>I found her, said she, scribbling as usual: I praised her extravagantly, and advised her to publish her works&mdash;she said she had some thoughts of it. I wish she would to my heart, for I should like to see her heartily laughed at&mdash;I am sure women have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o business with pens in their hands, they had better mend their cloaths, and look after their family.</P>
<P>And, pray, why not Madam, said an old gentle|man who had listened attentively to this loquacious harangue, why may not a woman if she has leisure and genius, take up her pen to gratify both herself and friends. I am not ashamed to acknowledge that I have perused the productions of some of our female pens, with the highest satisfaction; and am happy when I find any woman has so large a fund of amusement in her own mind. I never heard a woman who was fond of her pen complain of the tediousness of time; nor, did I ever know such a woman extravagantly fond of dress, public amuse|ments, or expensive gaiety; yet, I have seen many women of genius prove themselves excellent mo|thers, wives, and daughters.</P>
<P>But, Sir, replied Mrs. Greenham, the Lady in question only fancies herself possessed of genius; her writings are the most insipid things in nature.</P>
<P>If I could see some of them, said the old gentle|man, I should be a better judge.</P>
<P>Then you shall presently, for I expect she wild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and spend an hour or two with me this even|ing when I can easily prevail with her to shew you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of her pretty scrawls.</P>

<PB N="118" REF="026108_0114_0FCFAF6523065EA0">
and soon began a conversation which led to lite|rary productions.</P>
<P>I know of nobody so clever in this way, said she, as my little friend Ellen here&mdash;do, my dear, oblige the company by reciting some of your poems; or, perhaps, you may have some in your pocket&mdash;I know you always have a treasure there.</P>
<P>Indeed Madam, said Ellen, I only write for a|musement; nor can it be supposed my performan|ces have any merit worthy the attention of this com|pany.</P>
<P>Oh, you are always so diffident&mdash;</P>
<P>It is a sure sign of merit, said the old gentleman&mdash;But, pray Madam, addressing himself to Ellen, do you devote much of your time to your pen?</P>
<P>I am so situated, Sir, she replied, that I am una|voidably obliged to pass many hours entirely by my|self&mdash;In the former part of my life I have been en|gaged in many scenes, the remembrance of which, in these solitary hours, would be extremely painful, were it not for the relaxation and amusement I find in the exercise of my pen&mdash;I have but few acquaint|ance, she continued, and even those few might, by too frequent visits, grow tired of my company. I seldom go out but I meet with some object to en|gage my attention; and often when reflecting on the various scenes around me, I fall into a train of ideas which I feel a sort of pleasure in committing to paper; and in general they serve to occupy the next leisure or solitary hour.</P>
<P>And an excellent way of spending time too, repli|ed the old gentleman.&mdash;I am certain, Madam, you are never less alone than when by yourself.</P>
<P>It is true, Sir, said she, I do find a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> entertainment from this method of employing my|self; but it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> no reason for me to suppose, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="119" REF="026108_0115_0FCFAF63861F90E0">
I am amused in writing, another person should be amused in reading what I have written.</P>
<P>But, I do assure you, said Mrs. Greenham, it will give us all a great deal of satisfaction to hear a little of your performance.&mdash;Now do, Ellen, oblige us.</P>
<P>Ellen was of a temper that could not bear entreat|ies&mdash;she had not power to refuse a request made with any tolerable degree of sincerity and earnest|ness. I am always in pain for people of this dispo|sition; they often do things absolutely disagreeable to themselves, because they have not strength of mind to refuse peremptorily, but do it so faintly, and with such evident marks of pain, that a second or third request always conquers.</P>
<P>I know a young man of this disposition who is intoxicated two or three times a week, though he is not naturally addicted to inebriety, and in gene|ral suffers exceedingly after it, merely because he cannot resist the earnest importunities of his friends.</P>
<P>I know a woman too, who, whenever she goes into a shop, lays out twice as much money as she intended, because the shop-keeper intreats her to have this, and that is so vastly pretty, or amazingly cheap&mdash;and she imperceptibly launches into extra|vagancies which she afterwards heartily repents.&mdash;Now, though such a pliability of temper may be ex|tremely pleasing and agreeable in domestic life, it exposes a person to a thousand inconveniencies, im|proprieties, and irregularities. I would have a man or woman maintain an opinion of their own; and when resolved to refuse a request which they may judge imprudent or improper to grant, refuse it with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> steadiness and dignity as may at once prevent their being teized into an action which their reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> against.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="026108_0116_0FCF8D4BA20CD3D0">
But, this is by way of digression, so I beg pardon, and return.</P>
<P>Ellen, urged by the united requests of the com|pany, and a little female vanity which dwelt in her own bosom, at length complied, and recited in a graceful manner, a short, pathetic tale, written in the elegiac stile, and greatly in the manner of Shen|stone.</P>
<P>The old gentleman bestowed no praises on it, but he honored the recital with a tear, and soon after left the company&mdash;when the inoffensive Ellen be|came a butt for the satire, ridicule, envy, and ill-na|ture of those that remained, and whose tongues had only been restrained by his presence. Yet Mrs. Greenham professed an unbounded friendship for her, and declared there was nothing but what she would freely do to serve her&mdash;but she was a fashi|onable friend.</P>
<P>Friendship is a word universally used, but little understood; there are a number of people who stile themselves friends, who never knew what it was to have an anxious thought for the person for whom they pretend this violent friendship, in the female world in particular. I make no doubt but there are numbers of women who, should they be informed whilst at cards, of the greatest misfortune having befallen one of their most intimate friends, would cry, Poor thing, I am vastly sorry&mdash;I had a great regard for her&mdash;and then inquire what is trumps? or how gows the game? I can divide the world into five distinct classes of friends, for there is hardly any one person breathing but boasts of feeling that exalted attachment for some one or other on their fellow mortals.&mdash;Among the men, is the pro|fessing friend and insidious friend; among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wo|men, the ostentatious, and the envious friend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>They are worse than you imagine, Eliza, said she; we have, besides this bill, several more to pay, which we are equally unable to provide for.&mdash;Mr. Woudbe has professed the warmest friendship for my husband, and I think he will be glad of the op|portunity to convince him it was not merely pro|fessional.</P>
<P>I had by this time purchased my gloves; and be|ing anxious to know how Lavinia would succeed in her undertaking, I just left the shop, put on my ring, and returned.</P>
<P>Lavinia had left the shop, and was in the parlour. A person came in, who from his appearance I would have supposed a man of fashion; yet, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him to be a mechanic&mdash;his affected air and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> spoke him a finished coxcomb&mdash;it was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Mr. Woudbe; he asked for her husband;
<PB N="122" REF="026108_0118_0FCFAF6116D89260">
he was not at home&mdash;he sat down, fell into conver|sation, frequently intimated his fervent wishes for their prosperity, and declared he desired nothing more than an opportunity to convince his worthy friend Ferdinand how much he had his interest and happiness at heart.</P>
<P>Lavinia's eyes beamed pleasure and gratitude; she thought it a favourable, golden opportunity&mdash;she told him her husband's circumstances were embar|rassed, but the loan of eighty or an hundred pounds would set them quite at ease; and they should by in|dustry and oeconomy soon be enabled to repay it.</P>
<P>She pleaded with the most persuasive eloquence; love animated her countenance; an anxious tear glittered in her eye&mdash;but the professing Mr. Woud|be had none of the finer feelings which dignify the man; he loved ostentation, snow, and grandeur; but he had no idea of any pleasure in life superior to that he felt when dressed in a finer coat than his neighbour.&mdash;Two guineas was not too much for a ticket for a ball, but a shilling was extravagantly thrown away in relieving the wants of a distressed fellow-creature.</P>
<P>To such a man, the tearful eye, the anxious coun|tenance alternately red and pale, the trembling frame, and struggling sigh of Lavinia, pleaded in vain; he heard her with indifference; he consoled her in language in which was an equal mixture of pity and contempt; and I was informed by a per|son who knew him, that it was the last visit he ever paid his friend Ferdinand.</P>
<P>This is a sort of friend which the world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with&mdash;professions cost nothing&mdash;give me the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whose heart, alive to every dictate of human<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> stays not till he is asked to do a favour, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> seeks out opportunities to render service <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> kind.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="026108_0119_0FCF8D45CE135520">
Anxious for the fate of Lavinia, a short time af|ter, I made another invisible visit&mdash;when I entered the house, every thing was in confusion; and La|vinia herself looked like Melancholy musing on a scene of woe. I was casting in my own mind fifty different plans to find out the real cause of her dis|tress, and, if possible, relieve it without hurting her feelings, by letting her know that her necessities were discovered by a stranger, when a little man entered the house, whose features, however plain, and, to the generality of the world, uninteresting, immediately prepossessed me in his favour.</P>
<P>Lavinia, said he, I hear you are moving, and am come to see if I can be of any service to you&mdash;where is your husband?</P>
<P>A gush of tears was all she could answer.</P>
<P>Dear girl, do not wee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> said he&mdash;is it pecuniary matters that distress you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> speak Lavinia; will twen|ty or thirty guineas be of any service to you?</P>
<P>She hesitated; but at last confessed that they were greatly distressed for money; and that her husband was obliged to keep out of the way of his creditors.</P>
<P>I will be with you again in a few moments, said he, darting out of the house.</P>
<P>I waited his return.</P>
<P>In less than half an hour he came back, and put a sum of money into Lavinia's hand, which entirely calmed her fears.</P>
<P>Oh! Sir, said she, how shall I ever return this obligation.</P>
<P>By never mentioning it, he replied: let me beg it may be buried in oblivion&mdash;I shall be offended if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I hear it talked of&mdash;it gives me pleasure that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it in my power to serve so worthy a man as your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hand; and restore tranquility to two hearts which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> for love and domestic happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="026108_0120_0FCFAF5A865F4960">
He shook her hand cordially and left her.</P>
<P>How does thy humility exalt thee, my generous friend, said Lavinia, when he was gone; but actions like thine cannot be hid; it would be an injury to mankind to conceal them&mdash;yet it is not an action to be blazoned from the trump of common fame, but gratitude shall snatch a gentler clarion, and tell thy virtues to the listening few who know how to ad|mire and imitate them.</P>
<P>I left her with a heart at ease.</P>
<P>It was the close of the evening&mdash;passing through a public street, I heard the sound of music, and saw a room in an house of entertainment elegantly illu|minated&mdash;I took the advantage of my ring, and went in&mdash;It was an entertainment given at the ex|pence of Mr. Woudbe&mdash;the kind, the friendly, Mr. Woudbe, was lavishing in folly and dissipation a sum which might have lightened the hearts of the miserable, and dried the tear of despondency&mdash;But he could not shew his taste in giving or lending mo|ney&mdash;he could display his elegant fancy by spending it on trifles, or, in reality, throwing it away.</P>

<HEAD>THE ATTORNEY.</HEAD>
<P>YOU must not lose a moment, Sir, said a foot|man, addressing a man in the coffee room, whom I knew to be an attorney&mdash;You must make all possible haste, for my master cannot live three hours.</P>
<P>The attorney was a tall, meagre man; had a great deal of servile politeness and outward sanctity in his manner; yet there was an under designing cast with his eyes, which made me suspect the integrity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> heart.</P>
<P>He is going to make a will, said I&mdash;perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> rich, old miser is at the point of death, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>We were sat down at the door of an handsome house, and I followed Mr. Vellum unseen into the chamber of the sick man.</P>
<P>He appeared to be between the age of forty and fifty; his looks were venerable, but his features were marked by the hand of death&mdash;behind his pillow, supporting his head, sat a lovely girl about fourteen years old, who while she, with her hand, wiped away the sweat which stood upon the forehead of the dying man, bedewed it again with her tears&mdash;At the foot of the bed stood a youth something older than the girl; he leaned against the supporter of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d; the curtain partly hid his face, but the part which was exposed to view, spoke filial love, anxiety and sorrow.</P>
<P>My good friend, Mr. Vellum, said the sick man, feebly stretching out his hand, I am glad you are come: I feel the springs of life almost worn out, and I wish to settle my worldly affairs, that my dear Julietta and Horace may have no trouble from my relations.</P>
<P>You know, Mr. Vellum, I married their mother contrary to the inclination of my father, and on that account, at his decease, found myself possessed of but a small patrimony: willing to provide, not only for the present moment, but also for futurity, I entered into partnership with an eminent merchant, and my success being beyond my hopes, I not only lived in influence, but am enabled to leave my beloved chil|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> sufficient to place them above temptation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them the exalted pleasure of administering to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of their fellow creatures&mdash;I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> so much malignity and envy from my own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, that I think them by no means fit guardi|ans

<P>Mr. Vellum wrote the will, the old gentleman signed it, and two of the servants witnessed it.</P>
<P>Mr. Vellum seemed greatly affected, professed much esteem for the lovely children, and declared the whole study of his life should be to make them hap|py&mdash;he embraced, and pretended to weep over his friend, but methought there was more of joy than sorrow in his tears&mdash;The will in his possession gave him greater satisfaction, than the death of his friend gave him pain.</P>

<P>My dear Horace and Julietta, said he, I am sum|moned from you; early, my children, you are bereft of the love, attention, and advice of a parent, who had no other regard for life than as it contributed to your happiness&mdash;I have but one precept I wish to inculcate and impress upon your minds: deal by all mankind as you wish and expect them to deal by you; let nothing, my children, alienate your affec|tions from each other; and remember to respect your brother and sister mortals, not according to the homage which the mistaken world may think due to wealth and grandeur, but according to their own intrinsic worth and merit.</P>
<P>Horace, respect virtue wherever you find it; nor dare on any account use the wealth of which Heaven has appointed you steward, to corrupt integrity, or pervert innocence; shun the society of the licentious, though dignified with titles; regard not the scoffs of the libertine, but preserve unshaken your integrity to God and man.</P>
<P>Julietta, my beloved girl, fly from the voice of adu|lation; beware of insidious villains, who spread their specious snares for youth and innocence; guard with unceasing vigilance your honor and your fame; yet, my dear girl, exult not in the pride of your own virtue, nor triumph over the wretched fallen of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> be uniformly good; be innocent yourself, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> lament the misery of those who have forfeit|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> that inestimable jewel; pour the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> their bleeding hearts, and learn from their errors to rectify your own.</P>

Impossible, exclaims pretty Miss Biddy, the tradesman's daughter, who just returned from board|ing school, is informed by mamma that she is to have five thousand pounds for her fortune.</P>
<P>Impossible, had I ten more added to that five, I should be the happiest mortal breathing&mdash;and it is quite out of the question to think of ever being poor again.</P>

<P>When a man is alone, and in a thinking mood, his imagination insensibly runs from one thing to another, till he entirely wanders from the subject that first engaged his attention.</P>
<P>Now, this being my case, I had got into such a train of thought on the various kinds of poverty with which the world is infested, that it was with diffi|culty I brought my mind back to Horace and Juli|etta; and, when I did, that devilish suspicion of their guardian's integrity would creep along with them.</P>
<P>Pshaw, said I, what business have I to suspect a man of baseness, to which, perhaps, he may be an entire stranger. I declare, weak mortal as I am, I find sufficient employ in correcting my own errors, without searching out the errors of others.</P>

<P>FOR ever cursed be that detested place, said a wretched daughter of folly, as she passed a tavern in Holborn; and for ever execrated be that night on which I first entered it.</P>

<P>Give me a glass of wine, said she.</P>

<P>I looked in her face&mdash;she was pretty; and I thought her features were not of the sort which never express shame; her eyes were cast down&mdash;I thought I saw a tear steal from them&mdash;I touched her cheek, it was wet, yet she forced a smile&mdash;I took hold of her hand, it was cold, it trembled.</P>
<P>My compassion was strongly excited&mdash;by an invo|luntary motion I drew her hand under my arm, and walked on in silence till we came to another house of entertainment.&mdash;I then gave her something to pro|cure refreshment, and bade her good night.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ANNIE's STORY.</HEAD>
<P>IT was on a fine evening, the latter end of May, when tired with the fatigues of the day, for she was a milliner's apprentice, Annie obtained leave of her mistress to walk out for a little air.&mdash;Her mistress had a shop which she occupied, and frequently vi|sited during the summer season, situated on the banks of the Thames.</P>
<P>Annie strayed toward the water side. Some ve|nerable trees grew on the banks, forming a covert from the sun at noon; and, by their interwoven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ranches, inspiring a sort of pleasing melancholy in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he gray twilight of the evening.</P>
<P>Annie was a sentimental girl&mdash;she loved solitude, poetry, and music.&mdash;With a mind softened by the remembrance of some former occurrences of her life, and spirits calmed, but not depressed, by the solemn silence and serenity of every thing around her, she wandered on, meditating on the happy state of those who were in a situation to enjoy unmolested the darling pleasures of reading, meditation, and friend|ship.</P>
<P>Whether love had any share in her thoughts at that moment, I never could get her to confess&mdash;but, whether a sentimental young woman, wandering in
<PB N="136" REF="026108_0131_0FCFAF4BD5943738">
a solitary walk, and contemplating the works of na|ture, might not naturally enough wish for a bosom friend to participate in her pleasures, and join in an innocent conversation, I leave to my fair readers to determine&mdash;to be sure, she might wish for a female companion; very likely she did; but it is a point I never could determine.</P>
<P>In this shady walk Annie was accosted by Mr. Winlove.</P>
<P>Mr. Winlove was a gentleman of fortune, to whose family Annie had been recommended by a particular friend as an innocent, well-disposed girl&mdash;She frequently visited Mrs. Winlove&mdash;she had re|ceived numberless civilities from her husband&mdash;there could be no harm in walking two or three turns with a married man&mdash;she accepted his proferred arm, and they proceeded together.</P>
<P>I had been wishing for an agreeable companion in this walk, Annie, said he.</P>
<P>Why did you not bring Mrs. Winlove with you?</P>
<P>'Tis a natural question; Annie, but a wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e is not always the most agreeable companion. I am much better pleased with your company than I should be with hers</P>
<P>Annie had been brought up in the strictest prin|ciples of virtue; she had likewise imbibed fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> strange, obsolete notions concerning honor, pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> integrity, and the like. She, therefore, thought it strange that a man should prefer the company of an indifferent person, to that of the woman to whom he had vowed eternal love and constancy.</P>
<P>How can you talk so inconsistently, Mr. Win|love? said she surely my company cannot be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> scrable to that of the woman of your choice.</P>
<P>Do people never many from any other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> than inclination?</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="026108_0132_0FCF8D4014D51588">
I have heard, indeed, said Annie, of marriage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of interest, where avarice, not love, lighted the hy|meneal torch; but I have too good an opinion of Mr. Winlove to think he could be biassed by so sordid a motive.</P>
<P>How I am delighted to find that you entertain so high an opinion of me, my dear creature; and yet it pains me.</P>
<P>Oh, why am I denied the power of bestowing my|self and fortune on a woman every way so amiable.</P>
<P>Annie was going to interrupt him, but he stop|ped her, and proceeded.&mdash;</P>
<P>Be not offended, my sweet angel, you have no idea of the miseries of my situation; drawn into a cursed connection with a woman who has neither beauty, merit, nor accomplishments to render her a desirable companion&mdash;a woman for whom I have not the least tenderness, and whom I married from a mistaken point of honor&mdash;unhappy wretch that I am, I must now daily see you, charming Annie, lovely, amiable, accomplished, yet obliged to earn a subsistence, when nature formed you to move in a sphere more exalted, more suited to your gentle disposition.&mdash;These hands, dear girl, were not form|ed for labour&mdash;he took one hand and pressed it ten|derly to his lips.</P>
<P>Now, however Annie might be inclined to re|prove Mr. Winlove in the beginning of this ad|dress, the latter part of it was so prettily mixed with praises of herself, that she could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell de|termine whether to be pleased or offended&mdash;she therefore continued silent.</P>

<P>It is not to be wondered at that she was delight|ed by the voice of flattery, since she had seldom, from her cradle, been accustomed to any other.</P>
<P>Mr. Winlove was artful; he easily discovered the method by which he might gain the good will of this simple girl; and imperceptibly changed the subject, from admiring the beauties of her person, to commend the graces of her mind.&mdash;He then in|quired into the nature of her studies; commended her taste in the selection of authors; ventured gent|ly to laugh at her ideas of religion; called them superstitious; said she was a novice in the ways of the world, and openly avowed a passion for her.</P>
<P>At first her looks plainly indicated her horror and amazement&mdash;She trembled&mdash;shrunk from him, and telling him she was shocked to find the person she had supposed her friend, was her bitterest ene|my, burst into tears.</P>

<P>Mr. Winlove by degrees led her into a dispute&mdash;Annie was not a match in argument with this in|sidious friend; he was a sophist; he preferred the laws of nature; called religion priestcraft; brought innumerable proofs to convince her that her opini|on was fallacious, and that she was entirely igno|rant of the road to happiness, if she supposed it was to be found by strictly adhering to the musty rules prescribed by the aged and captious, who, unable any longer to enjoy the pleasures of youth, would deprive others of their share.</P>

the coarsest bed, and make the most homely fair delicious.&mdash;Give me love and Strephon, an hum|ble cottage shaded with woodbine; for love will render the retreat delightful!</P>
<P>Charmed with the enchanting scene her busy fan|cy draws, she imagines happiness exists only in a cottage; and that for the love of her dear Stre|phon, she could easily, and without regret, forego all the indulgencies of her father's house; all the advantages of wealth, and solace herself with a brown crust and a pitcher of milk. But then her Strephon will always be near her, ever whispering his love, and studying to promote her felicity: fired with these romantic ideas, she takes the first op|portunity of quitting her home; and without a moment's deliberation, throws herself upon the ho|nor of a man, who, perhaps, had no further regard for her than the hope of sharing her fortune might excite.</P>
<P>Ask this same woman, some few months after, when poverty has visited her dwelling and umask|ed the real designs of her husband, ask her then what love is&mdash;her answer will be, it is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, headstrong passion, whose pleasures exist mercy in imagination; a blind hood-winked deity, who leads on his votaries by promises of everlasting feli|city; and when too late for retreat, discovers his real aspect, and plunges them into inevitable mi|sery.&mdash;Yet this woman's ideas of love were both erroneous&mdash;the reason of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> she had never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> felt the effects of that exalt passion.</P>

you, there is no such thing as love, that it never existed out in romances, plays, and novels.</P>
<P>Then pray, Mr. Inquisitor, what is your opi|nion of love?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>REAL love was born of Beauty, nursed by In|nocence, and its life prolonged by good sense, affa|bility and prudence&mdash;it consists of a strict union of soul and parity of sentiment between two persons of different sexes&mdash;its constant attendants are ho|nor, integrity, candour, humility, good nature, and chearfulness.</P>
<P>A passion of this kind elevates the soul, and in|spires it with fortitude to bear the various vicissi|tudes of life without complaining&mdash;from such a passion proceeds all the endearing ties of nature&mdash;Father, brother, husband, wife, mother, daughter; names, the very sound of which will make every fibre of the heart vibrate with pleasure.</P>
<P>What noble, praise-worthy actions have men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> when animated by the esteem and love of a deserving object; even women have forgot the weakness of their sex, and suffered hardships, com|bated perils, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> even the threats of war, for the sake of a beloved husband.&mdash;It opens the heart to all the gentle virtues which ornament society&mdash;the heart susceptible of love is never callous to the feelings of humanity; he never beholds a distressed object but he immediately wishes to relieve it, not that he feels so much for the person's suffering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for those who may suffer with or for their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> such as a wife, husband, or parent&mdash;It is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which, when inspired by virtue, and guided by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="143" REF="026108_0138_0FCFAF3D4B1D1BA8">
and reason, dignifies mankind&mdash;a passion which ornaments the highest station, and adds new lustre even to the British diadem.</P>
<P>Illustrious pair! whose every action tends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> point the way to real happiness; long long may you reign the pride and blessing of your people&mdash;May your bright example spread throughout the kingdom, till Hymen, led by Love and Honor, shall reign triumphant o'er the British nation.</P>
<P>It is very extraordinary, but I never can finish with the subject I begin upon&mdash;I began a definition of Love, and I ramble immediately to the King and Queen; and how was it possible I could do otherwise when love and harmony was the theme.</P>
<P>My fair country-women, you whose hearts are formed by nature open to every gentle, generous sentiment, beware of Love&mdash;there are many de|ceivers who assume his appearance, and steal un|suspected into the heart, but of all the various shapes it assumes, none is so much to be dreaded as the specious mask of friendship.&mdash;There has been more women lost through platonic love than any other; and the reason is, they are thrown <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> off their guard, and have not the least doubt of the strength of their own virtue, or their lover's honor, till both are forfeited past redemption.</P>
<P>But all this is digressing from Annie's story.</P>

<HEAD>THE SEQUEL.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN she had finished her relation I took her into a hackney coach, and conveyed her home&mdash;candidly told my dear Emma the circumstance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> meeting, and asked her advice in what manner to dispose of the poor girl.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="026108_0139_0FCFAF3BE922C300">
We tried her penitence; found it sincere; and willing to encourage her in virtue, recommended her to the service of a lady whose example confirmed those sentiments which were newly returning to be inmates of Annie's bosom.</P>
<P>I have frequently seen her since, and experience a thousand times more satisfaction in the reflection that I have snatched her from infamy, than the man of pleasure can feel who raises the object of his guilty pursuit from the lowest station, to affluence and grandeur.</P>
<P>That is but a bad comparison neither; the two actions cannot come in competition with each other, since the first elevates human nature, the lat|ter debases it.</P>

Pray, your honor, give me some halfpence, said a boy that ran out of a cottage as the carriage pas|sed.</P>
<P>He was an arch-looking boy, with curly hair, very decently dressed, and ran along by the side of the carriage with surprising agility.&mdash;I threw him out some halfpence; and looking out of the win|dow to observe him pick them up, I saw a young man who had greatly the appearance of a gentle|man, eagerly take the money from the child, and go into the cottage.</P>
<P>I had scarcely mentioned the circumstance to my Emma, before the postillion driving carelessly over a heap of stones, one of the wheels gave way, and down came the coach.</P>
<P>At another time I should undoubtedly have sworn at the postillion, and thrown myself into a violent passion from which I might not have reco|vered the whole day.&mdash;At present, as there was no harm done, the accident only coincided with my wishes, which led me towards the cottage; so helping my Emma out, and taking Harriet in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">me hand and Lucy in the other, we walked into the humble habitation.</P>

<P>THE young man was seated by a woman whose face had never been remarkable for beauty, but was irresistibly charming, over shadowed by melan|choly, and adorned by sensibility&mdash;Her fine au|burn hair she had endeavoured to confine under a small lawn cap, but it had broke from its bandage, and played in wanton ringlets round her face.</P>

A child about three months old was at her breast, and the boy to whom I had given the halfpence, was making boats with bits of wood, and swim|ming them in a pail of water that stood in a cor|ner of the room.</P>
<P>As we entered, the young man glanced his eyes upon his cloaths; his cheeks assumed a sanguine hue.&mdash;They certainly were thread-bare; but what of that? they had once been new, and from what remained we could see they had once been elegant; perhaps it was that very circumstance which dis|tressed him.</P>
<P>Whatever circumstances a person is in, you may always discover by their behaviour whether they have been innured to their situation from child|hood.&mdash;A person who has never known any thing but poverty, shews no other mark of chagrin at the entrance of a stranger than what proceeds from an aukwardness of manner which they ever betray when in the company of their superiors&mdash;and raise that person to the most exalted station, and you will still perceive the same disgusting aukwardness and rusticity.&mdash;So, place a man of education in e|ver so obscure a situation, you will always disco|ver the manners of the gentleman, though obscured by the garb of the beggar.</P>

<P>Could you procure us a little bread and milk, said I, to the young woman.</P>
<P>We have none in the house, Sir, she replied, visibly embarrassed; and it is above two miles to another cottage.</P>
<P>The young man turned pale as ashes.</P>
<P>Give me my money, mother, said the boy, and I will go and buy some.</P>
<P>She hesitated, and the boy proceeded.</P>

<P>Will this relieve you, said I, offering him a few guineas.&mdash;</P>
<P>Though I am almost starving, said he, I feel more anguish than satisfaction at the offer; nor would I accept it but for my wife and chil|dren.</P>

<P>Now, shame upon the world for occasioning this&mdash;were it not that there is greater respect paid to the gilded equipage, glaring liveries, and em|broidered cloaths, than to the poor atom of clay that is attended by all this pomp, a man would ne|ver blush at poverty when it was attended by honor and virtue.</P>
<P>I do not mean hereditary honor, I mean a noble|ness of soul, an elevation of sentiment, an integrity of heart, that would rather bear the laugh of the world for keeping within the strict rules of oecono|my than suffer a tradesman's bill to go unpaid, or a fellow creature to want sustenance.</P>

<P>The modern man of honor is quite a different creature; he must have his pleasures whether he can afford to pay for them or not; he will steal his friend's fortune at the gaming table; debauch his wife, or ensnare his daughter, and then run him through the body by way of reparation.</P>

He thought, no doubt, ten guineas was a very large sum to be put into the hands of a poor author: to deal candidly, I should have been very glad at that time of a fifth part of the sum&mdash;but to proceed&mdash;I was not at all conversant in that sort of read|ing; but finding it absolutely necessary, I borrowed some of the best esteemed modern novels from a li|brary, and began to peruse them with great atten|tion, but there was a sameness in the generality of them that disgusted, and a looseness in the language of others that shocked me.</P>
<P>It is indeed shocking, said I, to see so many reams of paper expended in ushering to the world perni|cious pages, which tend to vitiate the taste and cor|rupt the heart. When the heroine of a novel is represented as flying in the face of filial duty, elop|ing, running into the very lap of danger, braving the authority of her parents, and forgetting the de|corum and delicacy which ought to be the charac|teristic of the female sex, and yet, in the end meets with every blessing, every comfort, she can wish; is it not enough to ruin the weak head and unwary heart, by leading them to think true felicity is to be found by following the bent of their own incli|nations, though never so wayward and opposite to the advice of their friends or the dictates of reason?</P>
<P>Nor can I think that the more modern producti|ons contain a better moral, since the whole merit of the filial obedience is cancelled by the retaining an affection for one man after they have vowed eter|nal fidelity to another.</P>
<P>I would wish the authors of those works to re|flect, that it is the inclinations of the heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ren|ders us guilty as much as the actual communion of a crime; and a woman who strays from her hus|band
<PB N="156" REF="026108_0151_0FCFAF231BECE530">
only in wishes and thoughts, is in reality as culpable as she who actually wounds his honor.</P>
<P>I have very nice notions of conjugal fidelity and filial duty, and earnestly wish that no writings night ever be made public which tend to injure either: they are the foundation on which we may always raise the temple of happiness; they are a crown of glory for the head, a cordial and comforter even to the sorrow-wounded heart.</P>
<P>These virtues are the brightest ornaments the female sex can wear, they make the plainest woman lovely; and, when displayed in an eminent degree, elevate the human soul, and make it little inferior to angels.</P>

<P>I WAS proceeding in this manner, when a love|ly young creature darted out of a little cottage, as we were passing, and seized me by the arm, eagerly desired I would convey her back to her friends.</P>
<P>They say I am mad, said she: but I am not, I have my reason as well as they have; I know I am miserable, and have been so ever since they took my brother from me.&mdash;Oh! cruel to tear him from my arms, to break my very heart strings, and send him away, never, never to return&mdash;he went on the treacherous ocean&mdash;Yes, yes, the sea, the sky, all, all combined with my inhuman guardian to take him from me&mdash;hark! hark! do you not hear the wind?&mdash;See the blue lightning&mdash;the raging waves&mdash;the thunder&mdash;I hear it&mdash;I see the vessel beat the foaming sea&mdash;I see my brother&mdash;see him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> hand&mdash;I cannot come&mdash;I cannot save thee&mdash;the

<P>Alas! my drooping lily, said I, you see nothing; there is no sea near you; this is merely the effect of fancy; your brother, no doubt, is safe, and will one day return to make you happy.</P>
<P>Oh no! said she, crossing her hands upon her bosom, and sitting down upon the ground.&mdash;Oh no! he will never return to me; he will never more sooth and chear his unhappy sister&mdash;but here will I sit on this lone bank and mourn the heavy hour in which he left me&mdash;I'll build a tomb of sea shells, weeds, and corals&mdash;I'll plant around it pale primroses and sickly daffodils, and every day I'll wash it with my tears, and count the hours, and chide dull lagging Time, till his sharp scythe shall cut life's fine-drawn thread, and I may lay me down and sleep with my dear Horace&mdash;</P>
<P>Horace! said I, looking more intently at her&mdash;It was poor Julietta&mdash;then Vellum was a villain.</P>
<P>At the name of Vellum she started from the ground, appeared terrified, looked wildly round her, and uttering a feint exclamation, ran hastily into the cottage.</P>
<P>I bade the author a good night and followed her&mdash;but an old woman, who I found was her only attendant could give me no information concer|ning her; only that she had lost her senses ever since the death of her brother, who was ship|wrecked as he was going abroad to finish his edu|cation, and that she had been sent into the country in hopes that the air would be of service to her.</P>

<HEAD>THE MENDICANT.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH it was near three years since I had been a witness to the sorrow of Julietta, on the death of her father, yet the scene still remained fresh in my memory&mdash;I remembered the doubts I then entertained of Vellum's integrity, and was determined immediately to return to town and search into the mystery of Horace's death, and the shocking privation of Julietta's senses.</P>
<P>When I have once formed a resolution, I am not long in putting it in execution.</P>
<P>The morning after my arrival in town. I de|termined to pay Mr. Vellum an invisible visit.</P>
<P>As I was proceeding through a very public street, I saw a servant, in livery, feeding a fine dog with bits of roast meat, which appeared perfectly fresh and good.&mdash;A poor woman, whose tattered garb spoke extremity of poverty, whose emaciated frame seemed tottering on the verge of eternity, and whose head was sprinkled over with hoary frost, approached the man, and in the humblest manner intreated him to let her pick up a little of the victuals which he had thrown to the animal&mdash;only one bit, Sir, said she, to save me from star|ving&mdash;The servant was silent&mdash;she took it for con|sent, and bent forward to pick up what the dog seemed to refuse.</P>
<P>The servant, who, unmoved, had heard her re|quest, no sooner saw her attempt to gather up the broken scraps, than he stepped eagerly to he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="159" REF="026108_0154_0FCFAF20AF85D138">
snatched them from her, and with sacrilegious hand struck the wretched mortal, whose sex, age, and poverty, should have kept her sacred from in|sult.</P>
<P>Good Heavens! said I, that a man should so far forgot himself.&mdash;What! must the brute crea|tion enjoy ease and plenty, while an unhappy hu|man being wanders through the streets perishing with hunger!&mdash;and what must this poor woman suffer at seeing herself denied the fragments that are rejected by a brute? for the dog had absolutely left a large part of the food that had been given him.</P>
<P>Who does that dog belong to? said I to the servant?</P>
<P>Lord M&mdash;, said he.</P>
<P>Lord M&mdash;, said I, at that instant recollecting the unhappy cottagers&mdash;then why not pay Lord M&mdash;a visit now, as well as at any other time; it will only defer my intended inquiry at Mr. Vellum's a few hours longer.</P>
<P>It was no sooner thought on than determined; and having inquired of the servant in which house his Lordship resided, I put on my ring, ascended the steps, and patiently waited the opening of the door.</P>

<P>I CHOSE to make this visit invisible, that I might be the better able to judge of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and disposition of his Lordship.</P>
<P>Having got admittance into the house unper|ceived, I followed a servant who was going up

stairs with the breakfast apparatus, though it was then 1 o'clock.</P>
<P>On entering a room, I saw a woman in an ele|gant <HI>dishabille,</HI> lolling on a sopha, and turning over an enormous heap of complimentary cards&mdash;She was between forty and fifty&mdash;was finely formed, and had once been handsome, if one might judge from a regular set of features; but at present her skin was shrivelled and yellow, her eyes sunk and languid.</P>
<P>Thomas, said she to the servant, is my Lord stirring?</P>
<P>Yes, my Lady.</P>
<P>Go with my compliments, and I should be glad of his company to breakfast.</P>
<P>In a few moments my Lord entered, threw him|self into an easy chair, yawned, and drawled out the compliments of the morning.</P>
<P>Where were you, my Lord, last night? I was quite surprised at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> seeing you at Lady Black|ace's&mdash;all the world was there.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN Howard had been abruptly informed that his son had forfeited his uncle's favour; had been informed of it in a manner inconsiderate and unfeeling, and then left to himself to reflect at lei|sure on his misfortune.</P>
<P>He sat with one hand resting on the breakfast table, and the other in his bosom, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> con|tracted, and his eyes fixed on the floor&mdash;there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>And what avails it, said I, that this man has ac|cumulated a large fortune?&mdash;of what benefit is wealth to him?&mdash;he had looked upon his son as his greatest treasure&mdash;for these many years has his de|lighted imagination drawn a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> perfect picture of felicity in the idea of beholding this beloved son, and seeing him enjoying the favour of his uncle, and perhaps wedded to some amiable woman, who, to the gifts of birth and fortune, added the gifts of nature, whose beauty created love, and her virtue esteem.</P>

<P>My meditations were interrupted by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, elderly woman, who opened the door, and, advanc|ing to Captain Howard, welcomed him cordially to England.</P>

<P>I felt a curiosity which I could not withstand, and, anxious for the fate of Charles, I followed Captain Howard and Mrs. Watson into another apartment.

<P>Lady M&mdash;was greatly irritated, and sent a mes|sage to Miss Beauchamp, commanding her to quit her house instantly&mdash;Charles followed the poor dis|tressed girl; and before my Lord returned, who was then in the country, prevailed on her to give him a lawful right to protect her.</P>
<P>However ill Miss Beauchamp had been treated, Mr. Howard thought it was his duty to visit his un|cle, and she for his pardon, for the precipitate step he had taken.</P>
<P>They made their appearance the morning after my Lord came to town&mdash;it is unnecessary, and would only be shocking your feelings, to give you an account of the reception they met with; suffice it to say, they were spurned by the haughty pair, and turned with indignity out of the house Lord M&mdash;swearing by all that was holy he would not give them a single farthing to keep them from starving&mdash;they left the house, and I never heard where they were till last summer, when I acciden|tally found them in a mean cottage, which they rented of Lord M&mdash;'s steward&mdash;they went by an assumed name, and Mrs. Howard having bred very fast, and being very weakly, they were reduced to the most abject state of penury.</P>

<HEAD>NATURAL REFLECTION.</HEAD>
<P>IT has often surprised me to find that people who have, with unbounded generosity, educated, cloath|ed, and fostered an infant in childhood, indulging it to an extravagant degree, never suffering it to be contradicted, but bringing it up in ease and luxury, shall, when that infant arrives at years of maturity, when it has attained sense and reason sufficient to enable it to judge what will most conduce to its own happiness, for the most trifling misdemeanor, nay, for only daring to think contrary to its bene|factors, or presuming to choose a companion for itself, spurn from them, with indignity, the object they once cherished, and drive it out defenceless to brave those storms of adversity which the education they have bestowed on it renders it totally unable to combat with&mdash;it has often puzzled me to determine whether such people have ever been actuated by true generosity. Pure philanthropy will lead us rather to study the happiness of a human being, when it is capable of receiving real satisfaction from our kindness. So far from evincing our affection to children by unlimited indulgencies, we are acting with cruelty toward them, since we are laying up a fund of discontent and uneasiness for hereafter.

<P>She looks at them by turns with such maternal tenderness, such anguish of heart, that she seems to say, what will become of you, my sweet chil|dren; how will you pass through life when I am gone.</P>

It was not long before Amelia's charms made a conquest of a gen|tleman of large fortune&mdash;he loved her; and her virtues were so kindly brought forward by Mrs. Ellwin, and her little faults buried in oblivion, that he overlooked her want of fortune, made her his wife, and settled upon her 500l. per annum join|ture. Amelia had not long enjoyed this advance|ment, before Mr. Ellwin, having placed too great a dependance on the honor of a friend, lost a large sum of money; of consequence his payments were not punctual, and he became a bankrupt.</P>
<P>He struggled for some time against his adverse fate, but at length died of a broken heart, and left his wife and lovely daughters no inheritance but poverty.</P>
<P>About this time Amelia became a widow:&mdash;but Amelia was now a fine lady&mdash;she had no time to spend with poor relations, no money to spare to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the distresses of Mrs. Ellwin; though her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cloaths were purchased by that generous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and cost near five hundred pounds, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had never been repaid.</P>

Amelia is now just married again, and flying a|bout in all the gaiety of heart which wealth and splendor can inspire in a giddy mortal; while poor Mrs. Ellwin is sinking under a load of anguish, unpitied and unthought of. Her once blooming, amiable daughters drooping like frost-nipped blos|soms, and neither Friendship, Humanity, nor Gra|titude will reach forth a hand to cheer, revive, or save them.</P>
<P>But I am wandering from my intended route.</P>

<HEAD>THE SUICIDES.</HEAD>
<P>AS I approached Mr. Vellum's house an hearse and six mourning coaches drove from the door.</P>
<P>Perhaps, said I, the guardian is gone to give an account of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> guardianship&mdash;and a very black <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fear it will be&mdash;however I will go in; perhaps I may learn something concerning the death of Horace, or gain some intelligence which may be serviceable to the hapless Julietta.</P>
<P>I put on my ring, and a servant opening the door soon afterwards, I entered unperceived.</P>
<P>I went into several rooms before I found any bo|dy likely to give me any satisfaction by their con|versation. At length I entered a chamber, where, on an embroidered sopha, lay Mr. Vellum sur|rounded by magnificence&mdash;but, good Heavens! how changed from the man he once was&mdash;his face was ghastly pale, his eyes sunk, yet their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was so quick and fiery that they gave him the ap|pearance of a fiend rather than an human being.</P>
<P>Opposite to him, in a pensive posture, sat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> woman in a deep mourning habit; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="173" REF="026108_0168_0FCFAF039DBD3C48">
partly concealed with her handkerchief, but the part that appeared bore such evident marks of sor|row, that a savage must have felt his heart moved with pity at the sight.</P>
<P>He is gone, gone for ever, cried Vellum, starting from the sopha, and catching hold of the young lady's hand&mdash;he is gone, Hester, and you know not half the anguish of my soul.</P>
<P>My dear father, said she, why will you give way to unavailing sorrow? the kind Power who lent him to you has but re-called his own&mdash;it is the lot of mortality&mdash;then, why my father, why will you offend your Creator by repining at his divine will?</P>
<P>O, Hester, you do not know the dreadful cir|cumstances of your brother's death&mdash;alas! my child, he rushed unbidden into the presence of his Maker with multitudes of unrepented crime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon his head.</P>
<P>Did he destroy himself? cried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of woe changing into that of inexpressible horror.&mdash;Oh! what could tempt him to the dreadful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">?</P>
<P>Hester, my beloved daughter, I was his murder|er, I was the cause of the horrid act.</P>

<P>Hester, said he, with a look of horrid firmness, I will unfold to you a tale which it is proper you should know; I may not long continue with you.&mdash;I have been guilty of deeds which will make your tender heart shudder to acknowledge me as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;On! cursed avarice, it was that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to stain my soul with murder, and to ruin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> my darling son.&mdash;For him and for thee

I would have gained an empire, though I had waded to it through oceans of human blood: but to lead him by vile persuasions to agree to, and execute the accursed plot, and plunge himself, for sordid ore, to the lowest abyss of hell.&mdash;Oh! it is more than I can bear to think of&mdash;my soul is at this moment suffering all the tortures of the damned&mdash;scorpions, flames, and furies hang about me&mdash;Hora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, dear murdered youth, well may you smile to see my tor|tures.</P>
<P>Was Horace murdered! Oh! inhuman wretch, cried Hester&mdash;then where is my sweet Julietta? have you murdered her too?</P>
<P>I hope she still lives, said Vellum; and may your gentle friendship recall her wandering reason, for my cruelty has bereaved her of her senses; and if she is alive, she is a poor, distressed lunatic.</P>
<P>Gracious Heaven! cried Hester, bursting into a flood of tears, and leaning her head upon the elbow of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>The lovely girl, continued her father, is in a mi|serable cottage, on one of her own estates, in Wilt|shire, where I have employed an old woman to watch her, and, by harsh treatment, prevent her re|turning to reason.</P>
<P>As to Horace he is no more.&mdash;When I sent him abroad, as I said, for education, your brother went with him&mdash;we laid the shocking plot before the vessel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed; and one night as they were walking the deck together, your brother pushed Horace in|to the sea&mdash;the vessel was sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing before the wind, and he was lost in a moment.</P>

<P>Oh! thou detested, wretched old man, continued he, drawing me forcibly towards him, thou art ig|norant what a task thou hast yet to perform: Go, lose not a moment, but use every method to restore that injured angel Julietta to her senses&mdash;give her back her fortune&mdash;and do thou retire to some de|sert&mdash;fast, pray, and lay upon the cold ground&mdash;years and years spent in supplication will hardly gain that pardon you so much need.&mdash;There is! there is! an hereafter&mdash;I feel it now rush on my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> soul.&mdash;You do not know how hard it is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> plunge at once into eternity.&mdash;Oh! murder, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cannot be forgiven.</P>

<P>Hester gladly retired.</P>
<P>I saw from the agitation of her features, though she could not but pity the distresses of her father's mind, it was impossible for her any longer to love him.</P>
<P>That task is over, said Vellum, as she shut the door&mdash;now, what remains?&mdash;to pray for pardon.&mdash;Pardon for what?&mdash;Murder.

<P>I thought I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> could gain no farther intelligence&mdash;and my spirits being greatly depressed by the occur|rences of the day, I departed; determining in a few days to pay the gentle, unfortunate Hester another visit.</P>

<HEAD>THE WIFE.</HEAD>
<P>I WISH to go to Mrs. Melbourne's assembly, next week, if agreeable to you, my dear, said a wo|man, who was walking through the park with a man whose appearance spoke him the gentleman.</P>
<P>She was a pretty-looking person; her counte|nance was open and engaging, and there was a mild air of tender melancholy diffused over it.</P>
<P>She led by the hand a beautiful girl, about four or five years old; and a smiling boy, seemingly a year or two older, was skipping, with steps as light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> innocent heart, before them&mdash;that man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> surely be happy.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="026108_0173_0FCFAEF847C1B3D8">
I examined his countenance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> scrutinizing eye, and me thought I read in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and in|attention; nay, he even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> in the com|pany of his wife and lovely children.</P>
<P>&mdash;I should like to go to Mrs. Melbourne's as|sembly, said she, putting her hand under his arm, and giving him a look of tenderness&mdash;it was a look I know not well how to describe; it was a mix|ture of affection and gentle solicitude; it was that kind of look my Emma ever assumes when she has any little favour to ask, and it always carries with it such persuasive eloquence, that for my soul I could not refuse, though she were to request the half of my fortune.</P>
<P>You want new cloaths too, I suppose, said he, rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">lily.</P>
<P>I thought you might make it convenient to let me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thy half-years stipend, said she, mildly; and you know, my dear, I never exceed it.</P>
<P>Very well, Madam, I hear enough of your eco|nomy, said he, withdrawing his arm in anger; but I tell you I have no money for myself, and there|fore cannot let you have any.&mdash;I do not see why you should go to Mrs. Melbourne's; you may find employment and amusement too in nursing your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">home is the fittest place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> women.</P>

<P>There, now, make a merit of staying at home to oblige me, when you cannot go because I will not give you money to lavish in finery. The educati|on of your children costs me so much that I intend for the future to reduce your allowance to half what it used to be.</P>

<P>By this time they were arrived at Spring Gar|dens, where an handsome chariot was waiting.</P>
<P>I am engaged out this evening, said he, handing her into the carriage.</P>
<P>Shall I see you at supper? said she, again assum|ing the look of solicitude; but it was far more anx|ious than the former.</P>
<P>No&mdash;perhaps I shall not return all night, said he; and immediately left her without even the common form of civility.</P>
<P>Drive on, said she, to the coachman; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the carriage moved, I saw her apply her handkerchief to her eyes.</P>

<P>These reflections had passed with such rapidity through my brain, that Mr. Selby was still in sight.&mdash;I will follow thee, said I, and see what has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> to charm thee from so sweet, so gentle a companion.</P>

Having got my ring on, I quickened my pace, and soon overtook him.</P>
<P>He proceeded to May Fair; when knocking at the door of a large house, a servant in a showey li|very opened it; when, taking the advantage of my invisibility, I entered, and followed him through a magnificent suite of rooms into a drawing room.</P>

<HEAD>THE MISTRESS.</HEAD>
<P>SHE was an elegant-formed woman, rather a|bove the middle size; her features were regular, and her complexion would have been dazzling, had it not been for an immoderate quantity of rouge which she had laid on her face, which, in reality, required no art to make it lovely; her eyes were dark, lively, and piercing; and her hair, which was bright as golden thread, hung in wanton ringlets round her face and neck; her dress was studiedly negligent, being only a white muslin robe with small silver sprigs; it was fastened round her slen|der waist with a velvet zone, ornamented with pearl; she was seated by a table on which sat a lit|tle French dog, which she was caressing as we en|tered.</P>
<P>My charming Lassonia, said he, running to her with eagerness, how tedious have the hours passed that kept me from you!</P>
<P>No doubt they have, said she, coldly evading his offered embrace; when you have made it two hours later than you promised.</P>
<P>My dearest love, I could not avoid it, said he; business of importance&mdash;</P>

<P>My Angel, my dear Lassonia, said he, catching her hands, you surely do not mean to leave me; hear me but one word; I should have been here much sooner had I not overtaken my wife and children in the park, and she begun teazing me for money.</P>
<P>And you gave it her? said she, with precipita|tion.</P>
<P>No, my charmer, I have not given it to her, I have reserved it for you; there is not a wish my Lassonia can form but shall be immediately com|plied with&mdash;Emily had set her heart upon going to Mrs. Melbourne's assembly; but I knew my ador|ed girl intended to be there, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> did not wish to meet her; so I have desired her not to go.</P>
<P>And have you brought me your wife's diamonds? said she.</P>
<P>No&mdash;but you shall have some, more valuable than those&mdash;we will go out now, and you shall chuse them at any price you please.</P>
<P>What, I suppose, said she, with a look of con|tempt, your wife refused to part with them; and you, a poor, tame-spirited husband, dared not con|tradict her; but I will have her jewels or none, so take your choice, Sir, either bring me the <HI>meek, du|tiful</HI> Emily's diamonds, or never see me more.</P>
<P>What a pity it is, said I, as I stood contemplat|ing this scene, what a pity so lovely a form should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> so vile a heart; that woman appears a mas|terpiece

of nature, and yet draw aside that beaute|ous veil, and there is such foul deformity within, that we shrink with horror and disgust from the very object which at first view filled us with admi|ration.</P>
<P>I am unwilling to refuse you any thing, my sweet girl, said he; but indeed I do not know how to get the jewels; I have no plausible pretext to ask for them.</P>
<P>And is this your boasted love? said she, this the fidelity, the fervent passion you have so repeatedly sworn? am I to be denied so trifling a gratificati|on because you cannot bear a few tears from that proud minx your wife? have I not sacrificed every thing for you? relinquished reputation, honor, friends; and is this the return? this the gratitude I am to meet with? you would sooner break my heart than comply with the smallest of my wishes.</P>
<P>During these reproaches she had vented her pas|sion by tears.</P>
<P>Do not thus distress yourself, my dearest crea|ture, said Selby; you cut me to the soul by your reproaches; come, dry up your tears, and tell me in what can I oblige you?</P>
<P>Go and bring me Emily's diamonds this evening, said she.</P>
<P>I came to spend the night with you, my love, then do not send me from you; let us go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ut and purchase some other trinkets.</P>
<P>I will have nothing but the diamonds! exclaim|ed she, in an agony of passion; which reminded me of Othello in his jealous fury raving for the fa|tal handkerchief.</P>
<P>At length the infatuated Selby, finding it was in vain to attempt to sooth her, and being, as he said,
<PB N="183" REF="026108_0178_0FCFAFC8D34B7BD0">
unable to live without her, actually promised to go home and fetch the jewels for which she expressed such a desire.</P>
<P>I was determined to go with him, and hastily stepping down stairs before him, stepped unper|ceived into a hackney coach which he had sent for, and was waiting for him at the door&mdash;a short time brought us to Gower street.</P>

<HEAD>THE RECEPTION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is kind indeed, my love, said Mrs. Sel|by, meeting him with a smile as he entered the parlour; I was afraid you would not have re|turned so soon.</P>
<P>Pshaw, said he, throwing himself into a chair; I do not suppose you will be so pleased when I tell you the business which brought me home.</P>
<P>If it is any thing which will make you uneasy, my dear, said she, I shall certainly regret it; but if it only concerns myself I shall regret nothing which gives me the extatic pleasure of your com|pany.</P>

<P><PB N="184" REF="026108_0179_0FCFAFC39B9DC360">
Make no inquiries, said he, but consider if you can form any plan to relieve me.</P>
<P>How much do you want my love?</P>
<P>About two thousand pounds.</P>
<P>I dare say my father will lend you such a trifle, rather than you should be distressed.</P>
<P>So, Madam, said he, you would advise me to apply to your father, and make my misfortunes the talk of the town.&mdash;You say you love me, Emily.</P>
<P>Heaven knows I do most fervently.</P>
<P>Then to prove it, bring me your jewels, they will procure me the money I want.</P>
<P>You cannot raise so large a sum without my mother's also; and I should not wish to part with them.</P>
<P>A very pretty declaration indeed. Madam; you value your mother's memory more than your hus|band's peace of mind.</P>
<P>Oh! do not say so harsh a word, said she; I will bring the jewels&mdash;had I the universe at my command it would be of no value to me when put in competition with your happiness.</P>
<P>She left the room, and soon returned with the jewels.</P>
<P>Here they are, said she; would to Heaven eve|ry desire which you form may be as easily ob|tained.</P>
<P>He looked them over.</P>
<P>These are not all, said he&mdash;</P>
<P>A blush of confusion passed over the pale face of the trembling Emily.</P>

<P>I must have all, said he, impatiently.</P>
<P>The afflicted wife drew from her throbbing bo|som a miniature picture set with diamonds, and a small, but valuable locket, emblamatical of love and peace; he took them from her&mdash;</P>
<P>Leave me the picture, said she&mdash;take the dia|monds; but, for pity's sake, take not that dear, first pledge of your love.&mdash;The picture will not enhance the value to any but me.</P>
<P>I cannot stay to take it out, said he, putting the jewels into his pocket, and giving the poor, weep|ing Emily a slight kiss; he snatched up his hat and instantly returned to the vile Lassonia.</P>
<P>I had been too much disgusted with that wo|man's behaviour to entertain a thought of returning with him, therefore, taking off my ring, when I left the house, I walked toward home.</P>

<HEAD>THE INFORMATION.</HEAD>
<P>BEING at the play with a friend some months after, I observed Lassonia in a box opposite to that in which I sat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with the very jewels which Selby had obtained from his affectionate wife.</P>
<P>Who that sees that woman, said I to my friend, but would think her the loveliest work of creation.</P>
<P>I have been admiring her for some time, said he; can you give me any information concerning her? I have seen her once before, and am quite captivat|ed with her beauty; if her mind is equal to her person, I could freely devote my life to such a wo|man.</P>

There is no more comparison between her mind and her form, said an old gentleman, in a black coat and a snug round wig, who sat just behind us&mdash;there is no more comparison between them, said he, than there is between an angel of Light and a dae|mon of Hell.</P>
<P>Do you know her, Sir, said my friend, turning hastily round.</P>
<P>I do, young man, said he; and to guard you from the effects of her pernicious charms, if you will sup with me after the play, I will tell you a tale that shall make you hate her.</P>
<P>When the play was over we adjourned to a ta|vern, and after supper our new friend gave us the history of Lassonia.</P>
<P>Miss Freeman and Miss Eldridge, said he, were the daughters of two opulent tradesmen; their fa|thers were united in the closest bonds of amity. Emily Freeman and Lassonia Eldridge were play|mates in infancy, educated at the same school, and contracted for each other the affection of sister.&mdash;Emily had just entered her sixteenth year, when she was called from school to attend an excellent mo|ther, who was hastily advancing to that "bourne from whence no traveller returns." Lassonia would not be separated from her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on this trying oc|casion, and Mrs. Freeman soon after paying the debt of nature, she was retained by Mr. Freeman as a companion, whose vivacity would prevent Emily from too frequently musing on her recent loss.</P>
<P>Mr. Selby became acquainted with the lovely friends before Emily had attained her eighteenth year&mdash;her sense and penetration charmed him; and her person, having then all the attractions of bloom|ing
<PB N="187" REF="026108_0182_0FCFAFBF33093368">
youth, he declared himself her lover&mdash;he fre|quently laughed and romped with Lassonia, but ne|ver entertained a thought of love, as her conduct in general was so flighty, and her conversation so trifling, that though it was impossible to avoid ad|miring her beauty, she had not one requisite cal|culation to create esteem.</P>
<P>About this time Mr. Eldridge was taken ill&mdash;the physicians feared a consumption, and advised a journey to Montpelier&mdash;Lassonia accompanied her father, and during their absence Emily gave her hand to Mr. Selby. Mr. Eldridge recovered his health, and they revisited England; when, no men|tion being made of Lassonia's returning to Mrs. Selby, she continued with her father to superintend his family. Two years passed on in delightful harmony between Mr. and Mrs. Selby, in which time she presented him with a boy and a girl. During that period the father of Lassonia died in|solvent, and she was reduced to the necessity of go|ing to service, as there was not the least provision for her future subsistence.</P>
<P>It was then the generous, disinterested Emily of|fered her an asylum in her house, appointed her an apartment, a servant to attend her, and supplied her with cloaths and money from her own private purse.</P>
<P>Lassonia had not long been an inmate in the house of her friend, before, envious of her felicity, she determined to imbitter it by alienating the af|fection of Selby from his truly amiable wife&mdash;Selby was young, and fond of variety; his passion for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was greatly abated by possession, and though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> almost venerated her for her virtues, the charms of her faithless friend enflamed his heart, and he
<PB N="188" REF="026108_0183_0FCFAFBE19EEBBA0">
eagerly caught at the frequent opportunities which she intentionally gave him to plead his passion.</P>
<P>Lassonia is a proud woman; her situation was irksome, though every favour from Emily was con|ferred in so delicate a manner that an indifferent spectator would have imagined her the person obliged.</P>
<P>She was likewise an artful woman; she soon gained such an ascendancy over Selby, that while Emily scarcely dared to hint her wishes, Lassonia demanded with authority, and gained every desire. Yet of so gentle, unsuspicious, a temper was Mrs. Selby, and so great a confidence did she place in the honor of her friend and her husband, that though Lassonia remained in the family near a twelve|month after her connection with Selby, she never once thought such a thing could happen. She fre|quently lamented to her treacherous friend the al|teration in her husband's behaviour, but she never suspected her as the cause of her uneasiness.</P>
<P>But Lassonia now found it necessary to remove from Mrs. Selby's, to prevent her shame from be|coming public; she told Emily that she was dis|tressed at being so great an incumbrance to her, and that having an opportunity of going abroad with a lady, who wanted a companion, she would em|brace it, and endeavour to contribute to her own support. By this conduct she laid a plan to pre|vent returning to the family, which she predeter|mined not to do before she left it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Selby loaded her with obligations at part|ing. She retired to a small house about twenty miles from town which Selby had provided for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> reception, and where she remained three years, Selby spending great part of his time with her.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="026108_0184_0FCFAFBC0D8C3F18">
About six months since the came to town, as|sumed the name of Green, took an elegant house, and set up a carriage. Mrs. Selby hearing of her arrival, and supposing she was married, requested me, who at that time was ignorant of the cir|cumstances I have now related, to go with her and pay Lassonia a morning visit.</P>
<P>We were shewn into the drawing room by a servant, who informed us his misterss would be down in a few minutes, but that she was then dres|sing.</P>
<P>How agreeably surprised my dear Lassonia will be, said Emily, to find I am the lady who wanted to speak with her&mdash;for she had sent up no name.</P>
<P>We were chatting on indifferent subjects, when a child ran into the room, crying, I will have pa|pa's picture; I won't break it indeed; a maid fol|lowing him in; he ran to Emily, whose arms were extended to receive him, and throwing the picture into her lap, judge her feelings when she saw the portrait of Mr. Selby, which she had given him but two days before with the greatest regret, ima|gining him in want of money. Her feelings, over|powered her, and she fell lifeless on the floor. The cries of the servant alarmed the family, and Lasso|nia, thinking some misfortune had happened to her child, rushed into the room followed by Selby himself.</P>
<P>It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> impossible to describe the scene that ensued on the recovery of Emily&mdash;Lassonia raved, Mrs. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> wept, and Selby appeared motionless as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>As soon as Emily was able to walk, I took her hand and led her to the carriage. Upon her re|turn
<PB N="190" REF="026108_0185_0FCF8D76977E3C88">
home, her fainting fits returned; the passed a night of inconceivable distress, for Selby never came near her; and in the morning she was in a violent fever. I then went in pursuit of the perfi|dious husband; but as the suffering saint desired, forbore to reproach him.</P>
<P>I found him, and he returned with me to her.</P>
<P>She beheld him approach with a faint smile&mdash;It is kind, my Selby, said she, to come and receive the parting sigh of her who has so long been a barrier to your happiness; indeed I did not know, or I never would have visited my happy rival&mdash;I never thought your love was divided, and the certainty of it came so sudden upon my heart, that weak and unpre|pared as it was, it could not bear the shock&mdash;take care of my children, said she, adieu my love; my heart may break, but my tongue will never re|proach you.</P>
<P>Her disorder hourly increased; a delirium en|sued; and before the next morning she breathed her last, invoking blessings on the head of her faithless husband and treacherous friend.</P>

<HEAD>THE ARREST.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL go and pay the disconsolate Hester a vi|sit, said I, one morning as I was rambling near Chelsea. I bent my steps toward her habitation; but had not proceeded far before I observed a young man, whose dress had formerly been genteel, but was now shabby in the extreme; his hair had once been dressed, but it might have been some three weeks or a month since; his coat was <HI>de couleur de puce,</HI> but much the worse for wear, as the elbows discovered a very fine, but dirty, shirt; his once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> waistcoat was threadbare and greasy, his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> loose and ragged at the knees; a pair of dirty silk stockings, ornamented with here and there
<PB N="194" REF="026108_0189_0FCFAFB485309148">
a hole, hung in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lovenly manner about his legs; and the sable fril of his shirt, that peeped from his breast, was trimmed with the finest edging&mdash;That man has once been a coxcomb, said I; for I al|ways judge when I see the remains of finery put on carelessly or disfigured with dirt, that the wearer has formerly been extravagant in his dress.</P>
<P>I approached the tattered beau in order to take a view of his person, when I discovered the features of my old acquaintance Mr. Woudbe.</P>
<P>And this is the end of ignorant pride, ostentati|on, and folly, said I&mdash;no doubt you would now be glad of a friend to administer to those wants which henceforth you will learn to pity in others&mdash;but I fear your conduct has been such that you have no friends to apply to.</P>
<P>The thought was scarcely passed before two dis|agreeable looking fellows came up, and shewing the trembling Woudbe a bit of parchment, he was forced to surrender himself their prisoner.</P>
<P>Just at that time a young man of fashion passing, and recollecting Woudbe, accosted him with heigh! Jack, what! come to this already! I thought you would have held it out a little longer&mdash;ha! ha! what a rueful figure!&mdash;all out at the elbows eh!</P>
<P>A truce with your sneers, Sir, said Woudbe, as|suming an air of importance, I stand in need of twenty pounds immediately&mdash;you have frequently made me offers of service; lend me that sum, and I shall be obliged to you.</P>
<P>Ah! Jack, said the other, that air and manner won't do now, it did very well while the <HI>l'argent</HI> lasted, and you was a gentleman at large; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you are again plain Jack 'Woudbe, the Cabinet|maker; you must learn to bow, cringe, and mind
<PB N="195" REF="026108_0190_0FCFAFB3AF67F898">
your business&mdash;I am sorry it goes so hard with you; but depend upon it, this will always be the case with young men of trifling fortunes, who ape the manners, and launch into extravagancies, which are only becoming their superiors&mdash;I would lend you the money with all my heart, but I know you have no way to repay it, and are too proud to go to work; therefore you had better submit to your fate with a good grace.</P>
<P>The poor crest fallen Woudbe walked away with his disagreeable companions, and the stranger ad|dressed himself to me&mdash;that young man, Sir, said he, was the son of an industrious tradesman, who by strict attention to business, scraped together a|bout three or four thousand pounds; at his death this money was left for his only son, who was then getting a little education at a cheap school in the country.</P>
<P>When fifteen years old, he was apprenticed to a capital Cabinet-maker; a very handsome premium was given with him, but he was too much of the gentleman to attend to business, and when he came of age he assumed the dress and manners of a man of fashion; expensive amusements, treats, balls, and the retinue of dissipation and folly were eagerly attended to&mdash;but this would not last long; it is now over; and even if he makes friends to get from his present confinement, I know of no method he can pursue for future subsistence.</P>
<P>Such young men as these, said I, by their folly are often involved in difficulties, which, in hopes of extricating themselves from, they hurry to the gaming table, and finding their expectations frus|trated there also, as the last resource, betake them|selves to a black crape, a good horse, and a pistol.
<PB N="196" REF="026108_0191_0FCFAFB144557B58">
&mdash;How careful should parents and guardians be to instil into the minds of youth of narrow fortunes, meekness, humility, and industry! the least tenden|cy to thoughtless extravagance, in either sex ought to be severely chastised; since pride, and a passion for expensive pleasures, which they have no lauda|ble method to obtain, has hurried thousands into actions which imbitter the last hours of life with poverty, shame, and remorse.</P>
<P>As I finished these remarks, I looked up, ex|pecting an answer from my companion; but whe|ther my discourse was too grave, or whether it touched his feelings, or whether some other cause had occasioned him to leave me, I know not, but he was gone; and on my turning round to look for him, I saw he was hastily proceeding towards town.</P>
<P>How easy it is, said I, for a man to blame a conduct in others which he is eagerly pursuing himself; perhaps a few years may reduce that young man to the same situation in which he now smiles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> see Woudbe&mdash;experience is undoubtedly best when purchased; but Woudbe has, I fear, paid an exorbitant price for his.</P>
<P>I was now opposite Vellum's house.</P>

<HEAD>THE RETRIBUTION.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING entered, by means of my ring, I pro|ceeded unseen to Hester's apartment&mdash;she was greatly altered since the death of her father s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ckly langour had taken possession of her features she looked anxious and fatigued.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="026108_0192_0FCF8D687720EA40">
I wonder Harper is not returned, said she to a young woman who was with her: I hope the dear Julietta is not worse.</P>
<P>She had hardly pronounced the words, before a post chaise stopped at the door, and, in a few mo|ments, the injured orphan entered, leaning on the arm of an elderly woman; an universal trembling seized on Hester when she beheld the ravages which sickness and ill usage had made on the form of her lovely friend: she led her to a sopha, dropped on her knees before her, and, gazing at her with a look that spoke the keen anguish of her soul, took her thin hands in hers, and burst into tears.</P>
<P>Do you not know me, my sweet friend? said she, after a long and affecting silence; will you not speak to me, Julietta?</P>
<P>Hester, said she, bowing her head forward, and leaning her cheek upon that of her weeping friend, Hester, why are you so sorrowful? and why are you dressed in black? are <HI>you</HI> an orphan, Hester?</P>
<P>Oh! had it pleased Heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I had been, cried Hester, earnestly, rather than you, dear, injured an|gel, had been reduced to this hapless state.</P>
<P>Alas! said Julietta, why would you wish to be an orphan, to have a cruel guardian, to lose your brother, to eat dry bread and drink cold water, and lie upon a wretched bed of straw? you could not bear it, dear Hester; you would die of a broken heart&mdash;for my part, I am used to it; I can bear it very well; then let me return to my little hut a|gain&mdash;if my guardian knew I had left it, he would be very angry.</P>
<P>And have you suffered all this? cried Hester, weeping bitterly. Oh! Julietta, you never shall return to that sad place again; your cruel guardian is dead.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="026108_0193_0FCFAFAF8C24A098">
Dead! cried Julietta, raising her hands and eyes in a supplicating manner; then Heaven have mer|cy on him.</P>
<P>And what do you think of the poor girl's case? said Hester, as she re-entered the room with Dr. M&mdash;, after they had persuaded Julietta to go to bed.</P>
<P>The doctor gave her great hopes that kind and affectionate treatment would soon entirely restore her reason, which he imagined was already begin|ning to return.</P>
<P>Could I but see that happy day, said she, and de|liver her fortune into her own hands, I should have no farther business in this world.</P>
<P>How so, my young friend? said the Doctor, with a look of surprise; I think you have a great deal of business in the world yet; why sure, with all your goodness and accomplishments, you would not shut yourself up in a convent?</P>
<P>Why no, said she; I am not a sufficient convert to the catholic religion to imagine it absolutely ne|cessary to shut ourselves up within the walls of a prison to avoid the temptations of the world; but, I think, a person may in solitude better practise those virtues so necessary to our well doing hereaf|ter, than in the noise and hurry of the more busy scenes of life.&mdash;By solitude, I do not mean to re|tire to a desert, and shut myself from the converse and society of my fellow creatures; I mean a calm retirement, far from folly and dissipation, where I may consult my own heart on the propriety and equity of all my actions, without incurring the sneers and ridicule of the world. As to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which my poor unhappy father hoarded, it does not belong to me; it is the property of the widow and the fatherless.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="026108_0194_0FCFAFAE09DE0BF8">
Here her tears interrupted her.</P>
<P>After this declaration, Doctor, she continued, you will not be surprised at my resolution of retir|ing from the gay scenes of life; and, I flatter my|self, I shall in time regain that serenity of mind a series of uncommon trials have robbed me of.</P>
<P>The Doctor was too much affected to reply; he pressed her hand, struggled hard to suppress a ri|sing tear, and making a hasty bow, left the room.</P>
<P>A few weeks restored Julietta to reason, health and spirits; when Hester, having resigned her for|tune to her own care, and made ample retribution of those sums her father had appropriated to his own use, during the insanity of his ward, retired to a village, in a county far distant from London, and spent the remainder of her life in administering to the wants of the helpless and distressed.</P>
<P>Her friendship for Julietta ceased but with her life; and many summers has that amiable girl spent with her uniting in every action of benevo|lence, and shedding peace and plenty around the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the villagers adored them while living, and mourn|ed with unaffected sorrow when deprived by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of their benefactresses.</P>

<HEAD>THE CITY HEIRESS.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL have the most elegant that is to be had, Mamma, cried a young lady, as she came out of a carriage, and ran into a milliner's shop, which I had entered to buy some little presents for Harriet and Lucy.</P>
<P>Do not let me detain you from waiting on the ladies, said I to the mistress of the shop, for I was
<PB N="200" REF="026108_0195_0FCFAFAAF817CD60">
willing to see to what lengths this girl's extrava|gance would take her.</P>
<P>I want a bouquet, Mrs. Frippery, said she; come, shew me some of the handsomest you have.</P>
<P>The counter was in an instant overspread with roses, carnations, lilies, jessamine, and other flow|ers innumerable; it looked like the temple of Flo|ra; but I should by no means have taken the young lady for the divinity of the place, as she was a little swarthy figure, with small black eyes, a good deal marked with the small pox, and something inclined to be crooked.&mdash;Nature might have made her real|ly so; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her stay-maker had found out a method, in a great measure, to hide the defect; her hair was dressed to the extremity of the fashion; her bonnet, which was large, and loaded with trim|ming, placed on the left side of her head <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a train of rich satin swept the ground as she walked; the prominence of her handkerchief almost hid her chin; and her cheeks wore the tints of some of the best rouge.&mdash;It is astonishing, said I, as I sat look|ing at her, that a woman to whom nature has not been lavish in personal attractions, should take such pains by their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">utre</HI> manner of dressing, entirely to obscure the few charms with which they are en|dued, and make their defects conspicuous.</P>
<P>I was roused from these reflections by the La|dy's bidding five guineas for as many flowers.</P>
<P>But really, Mrs. Frippery, said she, have you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> none more elegant?</P>
<P>Why, my dear Miss, said the woman, I have one, but it is positively bespoke by the Dutchess of Melvin, and it likewise comes rather high:&mdash;it cannot go out of my shop under seven guineas&mdash;though there are not more flowers in it than in the one you have chosen.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="026108_0196_0FCFAFA94AD2ACF8">
The flowers were produced, the Lady insisted on having them, and the money was paid.</P>
<P>It is a doubt with me, said I, whether the poor mortal whose industry and ingenuity formed those pretty ornaments, scarcely earns more than enough to support nature; and yet this thoughtless girl has paid seven guineas for them, merely because they were bespoke by the Dutchess of Melvin.</P>
<P>Just as the Ladies were about leaving the shop, a smart man, dressed like an officer, whose lan|guage spoke him hibernian, desired to look at some point ruffles; he advanced to the counter at which the young Lady sat, and while he seemed busy at looking at the ruffles, took an opportunity to slip a letter into her hand unperceived by her mother.&mdash;I shall again have recourse to my ring, said I, for if I am not mistaken, that man is a fortune-hunter.</P>
<P>That young Lady, said Mrs. Frippery, as they drove from the door, is the only child of Alderman Fig&mdash;she is heiress to a vast fortune.</P>
<P>Two fat old gentlemen passing just then, she in|formed me that one of them was Mr. Fig himself.</P>
