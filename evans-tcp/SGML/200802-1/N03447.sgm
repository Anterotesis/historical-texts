<P>Wi&s;dom is better than Weapons of War.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THO' it is the want of Wi&s;dom, in the divine &s;en&s;e of it, that hath introduced Arms, or <HI>weapons of War</HI> into the world, for there are no wars where wi&s;dom &s;hines and reigns in perfection; and there had been no <HI>Wars</HI> in the&s;e lower Regions, where all things were created in beau|tiful Order and Harmony, had not Man unhappily re|volted from his Allegiance to his Maker, and lo&s;t the <HI>knowledge</HI> of Him who is the fountain and Centre of all Righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; &mdash;yet not|with&s;tanding, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, and the Condition to which Man is now &s;ubjected, Arms are very needful and very con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, and they are mutually &s;ub&s;ervient.</P>
<P>If Men mu&s;t be dive&s;ted of <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> which is their greate&s;t Excellency, in order to their becoming warri|ours, or if handling <HI>weapons of War</HI> were incon&s;i&s;tent with wi&s;dom, they would &s;urely ill become the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and as ill, the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of CHRIST to &s;ay any thing in their behalf; for <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> &s;hould be <HI>ju&s;tified of all her Children.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004210_0004_100401BE3729C7C8">When the wi&s;e Man (as in the <HI>Text)</HI> compares <HI>Wi&s;|dom</HI> with <HI>weapons of War,</HI> and gives the former the preference, it is not with de&s;ign to di&s;parage them, (for he honours them in the very compari&s;on) but his de&s;ign is to <HI>commend Wi&s;dom</HI>; and it would be but a &s;lender Commendation, if the thing to which it is compared were not good, or of but <HI>little worth</HI> and &s;ignificancy.</P>
<P>This Aphori&s;m of <HI>Solomon</HI> is grounded on his ob&s;er|vation and Experience, from the notable In&s;tance he mentions, v. 13,&mdash;15. <HI>This wi&s;dom have I &s;een under the Sun, and it &s;eem'd great unto me: There was a little City, and few Men in it; and there came a great King again&s;t it and be&s;ieged it, and built great Bulwarks again&s;t it; now there was found in it a poor wi&s;e Man, and he by his wi&s;dom delivered the City.</HI> &mdash; This has been thought by &s;ome, a <HI>Parable,</HI> but it &s;eems more proba|ble to have been a Ca&s;e in fact, in &s;ome Neighbouring Country, of a poor Man who by &s;ome wi&s;e Coun&s;el was the happy means of &s;aving a City when be&s;ieged by a numerous Army of a potent King, (like the Woman of <HI>Abel,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 20.16.)&mdash;<Q>But &s;uch was their Ingratitude, that the poor Man is forgotten, no notice taken, nor recompence made him, nor honour put upon him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Henry.</NOTE>.</Q> But yet the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> was u&s;eful and excellent: It mu&s;t and ever will be &s;o, which makes a Man a ble&s;&s;ing to his <HI>City,</HI> his <HI>Country.&mdash; Wi&s;dom is better than &s;trength.</HI>&mdash; For that may be effected by <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> which cannot be accompli&s;h'd by <HI>&s;trength.</HI>&mdash; It is <HI>better than weapons of War,</HI>&mdash;whether offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, for without wi&s;dom there can be no right u&s;e of them, nor will any Succe&s;s be likely to attend them. Even in the mid&s;t of Arms, the mo&s;t notable atchievements and victories have been obtained by <HI>wi&s;e &s;tratagems.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004210_0005_10042247E69CB460">&mdash;The words are a di&s;tinct <HI>Propo&s;ition,</HI> and need not to be ca&s;t into any other form of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> or if you will plea&s;e to have them rather, thus,</P>
<P>Doct. That <HI>tho' weapons of War are good and u&s;eful unto Men, yet Wi&s;dom is more u&s;eful and excellent.</HI></P>
<P>In the handling of them, I propo&s;e to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">I. That <HI>weapons of War are good and &s;erviceable unto Men,</HI> in the pre&s;ent State of things.</P>
<P N="2">II. &mdash; The <HI>preference or &s;uperiour excellency of Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. To Con&s;ider, <HI>&s;omething of the u&s;efulne&s;s and benefit of weapons of War.</HI>&mdash; And by them I under&s;tand any regular <HI>Military Force, Arms, Forts, Ca&s;tles</HI> or other warlike preparations.</P>
<P>When I a&s;&s;ert the u&s;efulne&s;s and benefit of weapons of War, the <HI>lawfulne&s;s</HI> of them is implied; and this may al&s;o be very ju&s;tly a&s;&s;erted: Notwith&s;tanding it has been (I am well aware) di&s;puted and denied by <HI>Socinus</HI> and his Followers, and is, at this Day, by &s;ome <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> who have drank in this, with a confu&s;ed medley of other Errors; thro' a mi&s;under&s;tanding or perver&s;ion of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>None indeed can deny but that <HI>Wars and Fightings came from the Lu&s;ts of Men.</HI> (Jam. 4.1.) And that if <HI>Adam</HI> had retained the Rectitude of his primitive State, in which he had the beautiful Image of God his Maker in&s;tamp'd upon him, in <HI>Knowledge, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s,</HI> with an e&s;tabli&s;h'd <HI>Rule and Dominion,</HI> given him by his munificent Creator, <HI>over all Creatures in this lower world</HI>; there would have been no occa|&s;ion for Armies and Battles. As the Creatures would have continued in their &s;ubjection to their Lord, &s;o Mankind being ju&s;t and holy, mu&s;t needs have con|tinued in <HI>perfect amity</HI>; there would have been no Jars nor di&s;cords in the <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>moral</HI> world. But alas!

How &s;oon do we read of the unhappy fruit of that fatal Revolt? <HI>Brother again&s;t Brother</HI>! proud and di&s;con|tented <HI>Cain</HI> &s;hedding the blood of <HI>righteous Abel!</HI> And how has this world been ever &s;ince, almo&s;t a Theatre of tragical Scenes, of <HI>Wars, De&s;olations and De&s;tructions,</HI> thro' the wickedne&s;s of them that dwell therein?

<P>The lawfulne&s;s of <HI>weapons of War,</HI> and the benefit of well appointed Arms, di&s;ciplined and &s;kilful Soldiers, has been well &s;hew'd from this De&s;k,&mdash;Let it &s;uffice therefore, now to &s;ugge&s;t,</P>

<P>And long before, in the Story of <HI>Abraham,</HI> we find that he had more than Three Hundred Servants, <HI>Train'd Soldiers of his Hou&s;e,</HI> expert and ready for the bu&s;ine&s;s, at an Hour's warning, (<HI>Gen.</HI> 14.14.)

<P>Whether <HI>this</HI> be the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> intended by <HI>Solomon</HI> in the Sentence before us, I will not di&s;pute; for whether it was by any &s;ubtle <HI>Stratagem of War,</HI> now &s;ea&s;onably devi&s;ed, or <HI>wi&s;e Treaty</HI> with this powerful King, that occa&s;ion'd his <HI>Rai&s;ing the Siege</HI>; or whether it was by his Piety, Faith and Prayers,&mdash;we are left at uncer|tainty.

They may be very de&s;titute of civil Policy, and be deficient in many points of humane Prudence. But they have &s;uch apprehen&s;i|ons of the Divine Perfections, of the <HI>Glory of God in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as that they unfeignedly em|brace Him as their Portion and <HI>everla&s;ting Happine&s;s.</HI> They <HI>devote</HI> them&s;elves to Him, and make it their prin|cipal Care to obey and plea&s;e Him, as mo&s;t worthy of the highe&s;t Honour from all the principles of <HI>Ju&s;tice, Love and Gratitude.</HI> And it is their prevailing Con|cern and De&s;ire, as their highe&s;t good, that they may have &s;uch a clear Knowledge of God as &s;hall perfect their Natures and make them conformable to his moral Excellencies, that they may be for ever with Chri&s;t and behold his Glory!</P>
<P>This is the beginning of Wi&s;dom, (the <HI>chiefe&s;t Wi&s;|dom</HI>) when Men know and fear God and give <HI>Glory unto Him.</HI> This Knowledge of the <HI>Holy is their Under|&s;tanding.</HI> This is the Wi&s;dom of the highe&s;t <HI>Intelligen|cies,</HI> and this is their Glory;&mdash; the Glory of the highe&s;t <HI>Seraphs,</HI> that they know and reverence and love the mo&s;t perfect Being, the Author of their Beings, and of <HI>all Good.</HI></P>
<P>This is the &s;uperiour Wi&s;dom and Excellency of Man, in every Character and Station, and gives the precedency to them that have it. It gives <HI>an Ornament of Grace to their Head, and a Crown of Glory doth it deliver them.</HI></P>

This is indeed a <HI>lovely Sight!</HI> The <HI>Holy Angels</HI> will be pleas'd to behold &s;uch, and will be <HI>mini&s;tring Spirits</HI> to &s;uch here on Earth, and gladly guard their <HI>Heaven-born Souls</HI> whether departing in War or Peace, and convey them through the <HI>Regions of the Prince of Darkne&s;s,</HI> unhurt, untouch'd: and will make you their Companions among&s;t the bright and <HI>Heavenly Ho&s;ts.</HI> And you &s;hall come again with them in the <HI>Great Day,</HI> (which the <HI>Church-Triumphant</HI> as well as <HI>Militant</HI> waits for!) the Day of that <HI>Grand Ma&s;ter</HI> of all the <HI>Coele&s;tial Armies,</HI> when the flaming <HI>Chariots</HI> of the Great King will be <HI>Ten Thou&s;and times Ten Thou|&s;and.</HI></P>
<P>O who will not wi&s;h them&s;elves of that Glorious Army, under the Conduct and Protection of <HI>the Captain</HI> of our Salvation? when the <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> &s;hall &s;ound the Alarm to all the World, and his mighty Voice &s;hall be heard in the <HI>&s;ilent Tombs</HI> and in the great <HI>Deeps,</HI> and the <HI>Dead</HI> &s;hall come forth, the glorious <HI>Army of Mar|tyrs,</HI> and all that in Faith have laid down their Lives in the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and who have <HI>re&s;i&s;ted unto Blood, &s;triving again&s;t Sin.</HI> And they &s;hall be gloriou&s;ly <HI>ar|rayed,</HI>&mdash;there they &s;hall receive the (<HI>Corona triumphalis)</HI> the <HI>Crown of Glory,</HI> which the Righteous Judge hath laid up, not for that <HI>Chri&s;tian Hero</HI> only, the great Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> but for <HI>all who have fought the good Fight, and fini&s;hed</HI> well <HI>their Cour&s;e.</HI> (2 Tim. 4.7, 8.) It is &s;urely the be&s;t Wi&s;dom to make this your Choice, and to take the Cour&s;e that leads to this Felicity.</P>
<P>To Conclude, This is what concerns us all as <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans,</HI> who are, in the <HI>Sacred Oracles,</HI> frequently con&s;i|der'd as <HI>Soldiers,</HI> who have our &s;piritual warfare to accompli&s;h. There we are directed to <HI>put on the Ar|mour of Light,</HI> (Rom. 13.12.) i. e. to be well fur|ni&s;h'd
<PB N="31" REF="004210_0033_100423AB98690600">
with the be&s;t of Knowledge and &s;piritual Wi&s;|dom. This will be our <HI>Defence</HI> again&s;t <HI>Sin and Tempta|tion,</HI> as it will &s;hew us the evil and mi&s;chief of Sin, the excellency and benefit of Obedience. This will help us to regulate our <HI>di&s;orderly Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> to &s;ubdue our <HI>Lu&s;ts</HI> and <HI>walk circum&s;pectly (exactly)</HI> in every Relation and Condition; as it leads us to the &s;piritual <HI>Armoury,</HI> the <HI>Word of God,</HI> and e&s;pecially as it leads us to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and to derive Strength from Him who is <HI>&s;tronger than the &s;trong Man armed,</HI> and who has <HI>overcome the World,</HI> and bid us therefore <HI>not to fear.</HI> This will teach us to &s;et his Example before us, and to keep in our View the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t Motives</HI> and Arguments to all Duty,&mdash; the <HI>Glory</HI> and Honour of Him under who&s;e <HI>Banner we are enli&s;ted,</HI> and the <HI>bli&s;sful Rewards</HI> of perfect Knowledge and Holine&s;s, and the <HI>fulne&s;s of Joys which are in his Pre&s;ence for ever.</HI></P>
<P>O let us then labour earne&s;tly after this Wi&s;dom, <HI>humbly &s;eeking</HI> to the ble&s;&s;ed Author of it in the diligent improvement of <HI>all appointed Means,</HI> and grow and <HI>increa&s;e therein</HI>; we may then expect the gracious Con|duct of the Glorious <HI>Head of the Church,</HI> the <HI>Leader and Commander of his People,</HI> and that we &s;hall be car|ried through the Difficulties of our pre&s;ent warfare, and be <HI>more than Conquerers through Him who hath loved us,</HI>&mdash;and may depend upon that great and &s;urprizing <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of his, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.21. <HI>To him that overcometh will I grant to &s;it down with me on my Throne, even as I al&s;o overcame, and am &s;et down with my Father on his Throne.</HI> Amen.</P>
