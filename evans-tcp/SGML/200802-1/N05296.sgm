<Q>If the Foundations be de&s;troyed, what can the Righteous do?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is evidently agreeable to the will of God, the Sovereign Ruler of the World, that men whom He has made &s;ociable Crea|tures, &s;hould live in Communities, and enjoy the Benefits and Advantages that are pe|culiar to the <HI>Social</HI> Life. This cannot po&s;&s;ibly be effected without erecting &amp; &s;upporting Civil Government: For men in a State of <HI>Anarchy,</HI> &s;uch a State wherein every One does <HI>that which is right in his own Eyes;</HI> or rather that which gratifies his irregular Appetites without con&s;i|dering whether it be Right, or Wrong, or regar|ding how much it infringes the Right, or affects the Happine&s;s of others, are &s;o far from enjoy|ing the proper Advantages of Society, that a wi&s;e man would chu&s;e the mo&s;t retired Solitude rather than &s;uch Company.</P>
<P>THE Nature of Government requires that there be men of different Orders, &s;ome ve&s;ted with Authority to command and others under Obligations to obey; or that there be Rulers &amp; Subjects in every Community. Different Forms
<PB N="2" REF="006692_0005_1029A759803CAF28">
of Civil Government have all along obtained in the World, and probably will do &s;o to the End of Time. And after all the Di&s;putes which particular Species of it is in it &s;elf mo&s;t perfect and excellent, it mu&s;t be owned that there is that Difference, perhaps in the very Con&s;titu|tion and Genius of different Nations, or certain|ly in their Condition and Circum&s;tances as ren|ders one Form of Government mo&s;t &s;uitable to one Nation, and be&s;t adapted to promote it's Happine&s;s; while another Form &s;hall be&s;t an|&s;wer the great Ends of Government with a diffe|rent People. It has not plea&s;ed God to inter|po&s;e in this Ca&s;e, by in&s;tituting one Form of Civil Government and obliging all Nations to &s;ubmit to it; and therefore though Govern|ment in general mu&s;t be owned as a Divine In&s;titution, yet no one particular Species of it as oppo&s;ed to another, can ju&s;tly claim the Honour of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by a &s;trictly <HI>Divine Right.</HI> Whether we con&s;ult the Light of Nature or Revelation; we &s;hall find Rea&s;on to conclude that all regular Forms of Civil Admini&s;tration, &s;o far as they an&s;wer the Intentions of Govern|ment, are equally agreeable to the Will of God. And perhaps, if our Views were &s;ufficiently ex|tended, we &s;hould &s;ee that the Good of the whole World is be&s;t promoted, and the Grand Scheme of Divine Providence in the Govern|ment of it, mo&s;t effectually carried on, while
<PB N="3" REF="006692_0006_1029A75D04306EF8">
diver&s;e Nations are under different Forms of Civil Government.</P>
<P>PUBLIC Happine&s;s is the original De&s;ign and great End of Civil Government. The magi&s;trate under all Forms of Government, is according to the Intention of his Office, <HI>God's mini&s;ter attending continually upon this very Thing.</HI> If we con&s;ider the magi&s;trate's Autho|rity as derived from God; we cannot Doubt that this is the End for which it is given. A man mu&s;t certainly have very ab&s;urd Notions of the Divine Being, if he can per&s;uade him&s;elf that God, in appointing Civil Government, aimed at nothing higher than aggrandizing Rulers; and it would be bla&s;phemous to &s;up|po&s;e that his Intention was, to give &s;ome men a Right to gratify their Pride and Ambition, their Cruelty, Lu&s;t, or Revenge at the Ex|pence of the public Happine&s;s of a whole Nation. It is evidently much more agreeable to our natural Conceptions of God, as well as to the expre&s;s Revelations He has made of Him|&s;elf, to &s;uppo&s;e Him, as the indulgent Parent of mankind, aiming at and providing for their public Welfare in appointing Civil Govern|ment, than to con&s;ider Him as the Patron of Tyranny, Cruelty and Oppre&s;&s;ion, and of their genuine Con&s;equences, Public De&s;olation and univer&s;al mi&s;ery. And it requires but a little Reflection to be convinced, that Civil Govern|ment
<PB N="4" REF="006692_0007_1029A76052E0CF38">
is wi&s;ely &s;uited to promote it's great De|&s;ign in &s;ecuring the public Happine&s;s of Hu|man Society.</P>
<P>GOD will forever have the Glory of all his wi&s;e and gracious Appointments for the Wel|fare of his Creatures; but men through their own Folly and Wickedne&s;s may mi&s;s of the Advantage de&s;igned them. Civil Government may, and too often does fail of an&s;wering it's End; and public Happine&s;s is not effectually &s;ecured even by this excellent method which infinite wi&s;dom has provided for that Purpo&s;e. This &s;ometimes happens through the weakne&s;s or wickedne&s;s of Rulers, and &s;ometimes through the Folly and madne&s;s of Subjects, And who|ever are the blameable Cau&s;es of unhinging a Government, and preventing its an&s;wering its De&s;ign, the effect will be very pernicious, and men of all Sorts will &s;ooner or later &s;uffer under it; tho' <HI>the Righteous,</HI> men of hone&s;t Intentions and peaceable Di&s;po&s;itions, will ordinarily be the fir&s;t and deepe&s;t Sufferers.</P>
<P>THIS is beautifully expre&s;&s;ed in the words I have cho&s;en for the Subject of our pre&s;ent meditations, <HI>If the Foundations be de&s;troyed, what can the Righteous do?</HI> In which words Civil Government is &s;poken of as the <HI>Foundation</HI> of the Safety, Security and Happine&s;s of men con&s;idered as formed into Society, the Ca&s;e of <HI>the&s;e Foundation's being de&s;troyed</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed,
<PB N="5" REF="006692_0008_1029A7639EF4D1E8">
and upon this Suppo&s;ition the Que&s;tion is put, <HI>What can the Righteous do?</HI> That this is the Sen&s;e of the words &s;eems plain from the Con|text. The P&s;almi&s;t here flies to God &amp; tru&s;ts in Him for Protection in a Time of Danger. <HI>In the Lord put I my Tru&s;t; how &s;ay ye to my Soul, Flee as a Bird to your mountain?</HI> ver. 1. The Danger he was in is thus expre&s;&s;ed, <HI>for lo, the wicked bend their Bow, they make ready their Arrow upon the String; that they may privily &s;hoot at the upright in Heart.</HI> ver. 2. In this Ca&s;e it was the Duty, and it ought to have the Care of the Civil Magi&s;trate to re&s;train the wicked and protect the upright: But the Government was too weak to do this; or el&s;e they who had the Admini&s;tration of it, were negligent of the Duty of their Office, and would not interpo&s;e in the Ca&s;e; or perhaps the Ma|gi&s;trate him&s;elf who ought to have defended the innocent, was the very man who in this Ca&s;e attempted to de&s;troy him. King <HI>Saul,</HI> who &s;ought <HI>David's</HI> Life <HI>as when one doth hunt a Partridge in the Mountains</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xxvi. 20.</NOTE>, may be inten|ded by <HI>the wicked</HI> man who had <HI>bent his Bow,</HI> and <HI>made ready his Arrow upon the String</HI> to <HI>&s;hoot at the upright in Heart.</HI> Thus the Power of the magi&s;trate, which was originally de&s;igned for the Protection of the innocent, was &s;o per|verted
<PB N="6" REF="006692_0009_1029A765238C43F8">
as to be u&s;ed as the means of his De|&s;truction; or at lea&s;t was not &s;o exerted as to afford him Safety and Protection. This State of Things the P&s;almi&s;t de&s;cribes by the Expre&s;|&s;ion of the <HI>Foundations being de&s;troyed,</HI> and in the&s;e Circum&s;tances he demands, <HI>what can the Righteous do?</HI> which Que&s;tion plainly repre|&s;ents men of this Character as expo&s;ed to pecu|liar Difficulties in &s;uch a State of Things as is here mentioned.</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing from the&s;e words on the pre|&s;ent Occa&s;ion, my De&s;ign is, to con&s;ider &s;ome of the principal Things on the Account of which Civil Government is &s;tiled the Foundati|on of Social Security and Happine&s;s; and un|der each of the&s;e Heads, I &s;hall mention &s;ome of the mo&s;t obvious Ways in which this Foun|dation may be de&s;troyed, and point out the &s;pecial Difficulties of the righteous in the &s;eve|ral Ca&s;es that will come under Con&s;ideration. Wherefore,</P>
<P>I. CIVIL Government is the Foundation of Social Happine&s;s as it is de&s;igned and &s;uited to render men &s;afe, ea&s;y and &s;ecure in their <HI>Per|&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are many Things relating to men's Per&s;ons, of &s;uch a Nature and Importance that they cannot be <HI>happy,</HI> nor indeed &s;o much as <HI>comfortable</HI> without having &s;ome Security for the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and Enjoyment of them.
<PB N="7" REF="006692_0010_1029A76A2557C0E0">
Of this kind are Life, Liberty, Reputation, Ea&s;e and the like: He that enjoys the&s;e has a Value for them; and in Proportion to his E&s;teem of them, will be his unea&s;ine&s;s when he finds him|&s;elf in&s;ecure in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, or in Dan|ger of loo&s;ing them. Social Happine&s;s cannot be enjoyed unle&s;s men have &s;ome rea&s;onable Security with Regard to the&s;e per&s;onal Things; nor are there any advantages ari&s;ing from So|ciety that can ballance a Want of Security with re&s;pect to &s;ome of them. What rea&s;onable man would not chu&s;e to be de&s;titute of all the Bene|fits of the Social Life, rather than to live among a Company of lawle&s;s <HI>Banditti,</HI> Robbers or Pi|rates; any one of which might on the lea&s;t Provocation, or even without any Provocation at all, in&s;ult and abu&s;e, beat, wound, or torture him, or even take away his Life? What Ad|vantage re&s;ulting from Society can be named, that would make amends for this con&s;tant and imminent Danger of being ill-treated &amp; abu&s;ed&punc; put to the mo&s;t excruciating Tortures, or de|prived of Limbs and even of Life it &s;elf?</P>
<P>LIBERTY, or a Freedom from unnece&s;&s;ary and burthen&s;ome Confinements, Re&s;traints or Impri&s;onment, is what men are <HI>naturally,</HI> and indeed very <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> de&s;irous of. The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it gives a &s;weet and plea&s;ant Reli&s;h to Life and the Enjoyments of it, and the want of this renders them all ta&s;tele&s;s if not nau&s;eous. A
<PB N="8" REF="006692_0011_1029A773072EB6F0">
wi&s;e and good man, one who does not de&s;ire to <HI>u&s;e Liberty for a Cloke of maliciou&s;ne&s;s</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 16.</NOTE>, will readily con&s;ent to all <HI>rea&s;onable Re&s;traints,</HI> that is, to all &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary to the Peace and welfare of the Community of which he is a mem|ber: But unnece&s;&s;ary and unrea&s;onable Abridg|ments of Liberty are very grievous; and the total Lo&s;s of it, or <HI>ab&s;olute Slavery</HI> is to a gene|rous Mind next to, (if not wor&s;e than) the Lo&s;s of Life it &s;elf.</P>
<P>A GOOD NAME is what men in general are with very good Rea&s;on fond of, for it really is <HI>better than precious Ointment:</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eccl. vii. 1.</NOTE> But tho&s;e who have the be&s;t Right to it are u&s;ually the mo&s;t tender of it, while profligate Per&s;ons are &s;ome|times &s;o abandoned as to have no &s;en&s;e of Shame, no Fear of Infamy, nor any Regard to their Reputation in the world. A good Con&s;cience, a Sen&s;e of Innocence, an Expectation of being acquitted and approved in the Day when God &s;hall judge the Secrets of men, will do a great deal towards &s;upporting and comforting the up|right under a Load of calumny and Defamati|on: But even this inward Satisfaction, though &s;o greatly de&s;ireable, is not &s;ufficient to <HI>Social</HI> Happine&s;s. A man who is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this, though he has Peace in his own mind, yet con|&s;idered as a member of Society, is by obloquy

and Defamation, laid under many Di&s;advantages, and rendred le&s;s happy as well as le&s;s u&s;eful than he would otherwi&s;e be.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT is de&s;igned and &s;uited to defend men in the Enjoyment of the&s;e per&s;onal Rights, which are &s;o e&s;&s;ential to Social Happi|ne&s;s. Laws are made to curb the unruly Pa|&s;&s;ions of men, and prevent their wounding the Per&s;ons or Reputations of their Neighbours, their depriving them of Life, Ea&s;e or Liberty. The Magi&s;trate has ju&s;t Authority, to puni&s;h the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the&s;e whol&s;ome Laws, and to proportion the Puni&s;hment to the Injury done, and to the nece&s;&s;ary Intention of deterring others from doing the like. A &s;trict and impartial Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice in the&s;e Ca&s;es, is the greate&s;t Political Security again&s;t the Perpetration and Increa&s;e of Crimes of this Kind; and con&s;equently tends to render every Member of the Community &s;ecure and &s;afe in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Life and Liberty, Reputation and Ea&s;e. And Civil Government con&s;idered as intended and adapted to protect men in the&s;e Re&s;pects, de&s;erves to be called the Foundation of Social Happine&s;s; and, when duly admi|ni&s;ter'd, it is a very firm and &s;olid Foundation.</P>
<P>BUT this Foundation, &s;olid as it is, may yet be de&s;troyed; and all the Confidence and Secu|rity built upon it, may end in Di&s;appointment and Ruin. A particular Government may per|haps
<PB N="10" REF="006692_0013_1029A77D18A1B1D0">
be e&s;&s;entially wrong, in its very Forma|tion, by being built upon &s;uch Maxims as are diametrically oppo&s;ite to the Nature, and &s;ub|ver&s;ive of the original De&s;ign of Society, or incon&s;i&s;tent with public and Social Happine&s;s. Or a Government originally well formed, may by a gradual and perhaps an imperceptible De|parture from its original Principles, in Length of Time, become quite the Rever&s;e of what it at fir&s;t was. Magi&s;trates may degenerate into Tyrants; a mild and Legal Government may corrupt and turn into mere Arbitrarine&s;s and De&s;poti&s;m: or, on the other Hand, the Admi|ni&s;tration may become weak, and &s;o incapable of an&s;wering its Intention; the Magi&s;trate may loo&s;e his Influence and Authority, and the Laws may become contemptible in the Eyes of the People. This may ari&s;e from a general Re|mi&s;ne&s;s in the Execution of them, which if con|tinued for any Length of Time, &s;eldom fails of producing this fatal Effect: Or it may proceed from the Prevalence of a di&s;contented, factious and mutinous &s;pirit in the People, which &s;ome times ri&s;es to &s;uch an Height that the Magi|&s;trate has not Strength to repel and &s;ubdue it. In the&s;e Ca&s;es it is evident that the Foundation of Social Happine&s;s is de&s;troyed; for in &s;uch Circum&s;tances no Man has a proper Security for his Ea&s;e or Liberty, his Reputation or even his Life.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="006692_0014_1029A77E9E249938">
TYRANNY, whether natural to the Con&s;titu|tion of a Government or owing to Corruption in the Admini&s;tration, is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with Social Happine&s;s. The Subjects in an arbitrary Government have indeed <HI>&s;ome</HI> Se|curity again&s;t being a&s;&s;aulted, abu&s;ed, defamed or murdered by their Fellow-Subjects; but even this is not &s;o &s;trong as public Happine&s;s requires it &s;hould be, becau&s;e arbitrary Rulers &s;u&s;pend the Execution of the Laws at their Plea&s;ure, and that even of tho&s;e Laws the re|gular Execution of which is mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the Security even of the Lives of their Subjects. And then Subjects in &s;uch Govern|ments, have no Security at all, even of Life it|&s;elf, again&s;t their Rulers. Every man has a <HI>Right</HI> to his own Life by the Law of Nature; and when men enter into Society they are &s;o far from giving up this Right, that it mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed the &s;ecuring it to them was one of the principal Rea&s;ons of men's forming them&s;elves into Communities. If any man doubts this, he need only a&s;k him&s;elf whether he would, on any Con&s;ideration, join with a Society in which it &s;hould be a fundamental Article, that any one man, or any Number of men &s;hould have a Right to take away his Life when they plea&s;ed? A man may forfeit his Life, and when he has done &s;o the magi&s;trate may ju&s;tly take it away: But without &s;uch Forfeiture made, the
<PB N="12" REF="006692_0015_1029A78759AF64C8">
magi&s;trate has no more Right to take away the Life of a Subject, than one private Per&s;on has to take away the Life of another. Murther committed with all the Solemnities of a legal Tryal &amp; Execution, is the wor&s;t Kind of mur|ther; The innocent man &s;uffers mo&s;t in this way, as his Reputation is murthered as well as his Per&s;on: and tho&s;e who in this method &s;hed innocent Blood, contract an aggravated Guilt as they make the Authority of the magi&s;trate which was given on Purpo&s;e to pro|tect the innocent, the very means of his De|&s;truction. This I take to be the meaning of that Speech of Chri&s;t to <HI>Pilate, Thou could&s;t have no Power at all again&s;t me, except it were given thee from above:</HI> Therefore <HI>he that deli|vered me unto thee hath</HI> the greater Sin. John xix. 11. and &s;o <HI>Confinement</HI> or an Abridg|ment of that Liberty which the Intentions and Laws of Society allow to men in general; <HI>Infa|my,</HI> and the Infliction of Corporal <HI>Pain</HI> are to be con&s;idered as <HI>Puni&s;hments;</HI> and as &s;uch they &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Guilt</HI> in the Subjects of them: And when the&s;e are inflicted on any Man not con|victed of a Crime that de&s;erves them, he has an Injury done him. And when Magi&s;trates without regarding the Rules of di&s;tributive Ju&s;tice, act in an arbitrary, Tyrannical Manner, and treat the innocents as if they were guilty, the Di&s;tinction between Right and Wrong, and
<PB N="13" REF="006692_0016_1029A78924E3F070">
&s;o the Foundation of Society and public Hap|pine&s;s and Security is de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e is much the &s;ame when the Ma|gi&s;trate wants Power, as when he wants the Will to protect the Innocent, and puni&s;h the Guilty. Tyranny and Anarchy, like Fire and Fro&s;t, tho' contrary in their Natures, are in many In&s;tan|ces much alike in their Effects. A factious, ungovernable Di&s;po&s;ition in the People does as effectually de&s;troy the Foundations of public Happine&s;s, as Tyranny in the Rulers: And a man has no more &s;ecurity of his Life or any of the Enjoyments of it, when the Execution of the Laws is prevented by the mutinous Temper of the People, than he would have if the Laws were Su&s;pended by the arbitrary Will of tyran|nical Governors.</P>
<P><HI>IF the Foundations be de&s;troyed</HI> in either of the&s;e Ways, <HI>What can the Righteous do?</HI> While the authority of the Magi&s;trate is rightly directed, duly exerci&s;ed, &amp; properly reverenced and &s;ubmitted to, every Member of the Com|munity has the highe&s;t Political Security again&s;t per&s;onal Injuries and Abu&s;es: But when the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice is perverted, and the Ends of Government render'd impractible, ei|ther by Corruption and Tyranny in the Rulers or by Ob&s;tinacy a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Ungovernablene&s;s in the People, no man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> proper Security in the&s;e Re&s;pects; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> is liable to the greate&s;t

In the&s;e Circum&s;tances wicked Men may for a while pre&s;erve them|&s;elves; they can <HI>cringe</HI> and <HI>fawn;</HI> they have no Re&s;traints of Con&s;cience to prevent their flat|terring a Tyrant, or &s;acrificing the Liberties of their Country, and the Happine&s;s of their Fel|low-Subjects to his lawle&s;s Will; or even their yielding them&s;elves to him, and becoming the criminal In&s;truments in his Hands of entailing Mi&s;ery on Generations yet unborn.

But now the Righ|teous who&s;e Con&s;ciences re&s;train them from u&s;ing &s;uch wicked Arts, they who religiou&s;ly adhere to the Con&s;titution and Intere&s;ts of their Country, and will neither &s;acrifice the ju&s;t Li|berties of the People to Rulers of an arbitrary Di&s;po&s;ition, nor give up the legal Authority of

<P>II. CIVIL Government is the Foundation of Social Happine&s;s as it is de&s;igned and &s;uited to &s;ecure Men in their <HI>Rights</HI> &amp; <HI>Properties,</HI> by a due admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice in all <HI>Civil Cau&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>SOCIAL Happine&s;s requires that men be &s;ecured in their civil Rights and Properties, as well as in their Per&s;ons; and this is one great De&s;ign of Government. Property is prior to all Humane Laws and Con&s;titutions. God has <HI>given the Earth to the Children of men</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al cxv. 16.</NOTE>; and if by the <HI>original Grant</HI> every one of them has an equal Right to every particular Thing, while it continues meerly in the State wherein Nature produced it, yet when any one man has by his own Labour rendred it better, more &s;uitable to the U&s;es of Human Life and therefore more va|luable, he has now a better Right to it, than any other man has; and being in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he cannot ju&s;tly be turned out by one who has not &s;o good a Title as he him&s;elf has. But Properties and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions would be very pre|carious
<PB N="16" REF="006692_0019_1029A794F977B738">
Things in a State of Nature, they need the Sanctions of Government and Laws to ren|der them in any mea&s;ure &s;ecure and &s;afe; and the obtaining this Security was no doubt one great Rea&s;on that induced men to combine in regular Societies, and e&s;tabli&s;h Government. For in a State of Nature, though no man had a Right to di&s;turb the Happine&s;s, or take away the Property of another, yet the &s;tronger would prey upon and devour the weaker: And when any Di&s;putes aro&s;e concerning Property, there being no Per&s;ons authorized to judge &amp; deter|mine between the Parties, every man was Judge in his own Cau&s;e; and would put his Judg|ment in Execution in &s;uch a manner as would be&s;t an&s;wer his End, either by Force or Fraud. A State of Nature is a State of War; and in all the Controver&s;ies that might ari&s;e in it, there was no Appeal but to the Sword.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT is excellently &s;uited to re|medy this Evil, and to &s;ecure and defend men in the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Rights and Pro|perties. This can no otherwi&s;e be done but by a due Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice in Civil Cau&s;es; and therefore it is <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to Society that Judg|es be appointed, and that they have &s;ufficient Authority to carry their Judgments into Exe|cution, by obliging even the mo&s;t &s;tubborn and refractory to &s;ubmit to it. And as the whole Force of the Community is to be applied, when
<PB N="17" REF="006692_0020_1029A7982F89B550">
nece&s;&s;ary, to execute Legal Judgments, every man in a well con&s;tituted Government, has the highe&s;t Political Security for the Enjoyment of his Property, for all his Fellow-Subjects are en|gaged to defend him therein, with their united Force and Strength.</P>
<P>IN this View of the Ca&s;e the Foundations may be de&s;troyed &s;everal ways, as, when good Laws are not provided, or Judges not appoint|ed to execute them; when Corruption and Bribery prevail, and Judgment is bought and &s;old; or when through the weakne&s;s of the Admini&s;tration, or the Strength of Factions, a righteous Judgment cannot be carried into Execution, and &s;o Ju&s;tice cannot be done. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible for &s;ome of the&s;e Things to ari&s;e to &s;uch an Height as ab&s;olutely to di&s;&s;olve a Go|vernment, and reduce a People to a mere State of Nature, and &s;o to deprive them wholly of the Advantages that ari&s;e from Society: and every Degree of them affects the Foundation of public Happine&s;s, as it weakens the Security which every Man in Social Life ought to have, for the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Property or E|&s;tate.</P>
<P>THE Righteous will be expo&s;ed to peculiar Difficulties in this Ca&s;e as well as the former. For &s;uch being under the Re&s;traints of Religion &amp; Con&s;cience, cannot bribe a Judge, nor corrupt a Jury, nor &s;uborn an Evidence; nor on the

other Hand can they join with the mutinous, promote Riots, or rai&s;e a Mob to protect them. But they who are under no &s;uch Re&s;traints will readily u&s;e the&s;e &amp; &s;uch like wicked Arts; and by them, when the Foundations are thus de|&s;troyed, they too often not only Defend them|&s;elves, but oppre&s;s &amp; ruin their innocent Neigh|bours.</P>
<P>III. CIVIL Government is the Foundation of Social Happine&s;s, as it is appointed &amp; &s;uited to promote the Practice of all tho&s;e Virtues which conduce to render a Community &s;afe, flouri&s;hing and happy; and to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e Vices which tend to de&s;troy or hurt it.</P>

Sin of any Kind when connived at and encouraged, brings public Guilt; public Guilt de&s;erves public Judgments; and it may rea&s;onably be expected, that the Sovereign Ru|ler of the World will manife&s;t the Holine&s;s of his Nature, and di&s;cover the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his moral Government, by rendering a wicked and debauched Community a mi&s;erable one. Indeed it can hardly be otherwi&s;e, in the Na|ture of Things, where &s;ome particular Sorts of Vice prevail, and become general. Some Vices are in their own Nature de&s;tructive of public

Happine&s;s; &s;uch, for In&s;tance, are <HI>Idlene&s;s, Ex|travagance, Intemperance,</HI> and <HI>the Neglect</HI> of pro|per Care for the <HI>Education</HI> and In&s;truction of <HI>the ri&s;ing Generation.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY Member of a Community is obliged to contribute, in his Station, to the good of the whole, and every indu&s;trious, frugal Man does &s;o; he &s;erves him&s;elf, and he &s;erves the Public at the &s;ame Time. Whatever any man gains by hone&s;t Labour, is ju&s;t &s;o much gained to the Society of which he is a Member: And on the contrary Idlene&s;s in particular Per&s;ons is preju|dicial to the Public; there is at lea&s;t the Lo&s;s of what the Community might have been bene|fitted by their Labour. And then as <HI>he that is &s;lothful in his work is Brother to him that is a great Wa&s;ter</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xviii. 9.</NOTE>, and Lazine&s;s is the Parent of Poverty and Want, Idlene&s;s tends to hurt the Public by increa&s;ing the Number of Beggars, or that of Thieves and Robbers.</P>
<P>EXTRAVAGANCE as it tends to impove|ri&s;h particular Per&s;ons &amp; Families, has the &s;ame evil A&s;pect upon public Happine&s;s as Idlene&s;s has; and be&s;ides this, it impoveri&s;hes a Com|munity as it turns the Balance of Trade again&s;t them, and &s;o obliges them to &s;end to other Coun|tries what ought to &s;erve as a Medium of Trade among them&s;elves, and reduces them to the mi|&s;erable

The Difficul|ties which this brings on and continues, are at pre&s;ent &s;o publickly known, and &s;o generally felt, that I need not &s;pend Time in de&s;cribing them. There is no one Kind of Extravagance &s;o pernicious in its Nature &amp; Con&s;equences as an intemperate u&s;e of &s;trong Drink.

Not only &s;o, but it is productive of Brawls, Riots &amp; Quarrels, which too often produce Fighting, &amp; i&s;&s;ue in wounds &amp; Blood, <HI>Who hath Wo? who hath Sorrow? who hath Contentions? who hath Bablings? who hath Wounds-?-They that tarry long at the Wine, they that go to &s;eek mixt Wine</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 29, 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE Vices tend to the pre&s;ent &amp; imme|diate De&s;truction of Social Happine&s;s, and the Neglect of proper Care for the In&s;truction and Education of Youth, does as certainly tend to entail public Mi&s;ery on Po&s;terity. Ignorance

<P>GOVERNMENT is the Foundation of So|cial Happine&s;s as it is de&s;igned to prevent &s;uch Things as are detrimental to it, and to promote tho&s;e Things which tend to advance &amp; perpe|tuate it.

The Magi&s;trate's Authority capacitates him for erecting and &s;upporting Schools &amp; Colleges, and for ordering &amp; regu|lating them, and the Circum&s;tances relating to them &s;o as effectually to promote the good De|&s;igns of their In&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE Foundations may be de&s;troyed by Care|le&s;sne&s;s and Indifference with Regard to the&s;e Things. When no Encouragement is given to Learning, Ingenuity, Frugality &amp; Diligence, nor any Thing done to di&s;countenance &amp; pre|vent Idlene&s;s, Extravagance &amp; Intemperance; when Laws are not provided, or, if made, not executed to prevent tho&s;e vicious Practices which directly tend to procure public Mi&s;ery, or to encourage tho&s;e virtuous, amiable &amp; u&s;eful Things which promote the Happine&s;s of Hu|man Society, then are the Foundation, in this View of Things de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>IN this Ca&s;e vicious Per&s;ons, &s;uch e&s;pecially as are addicted to the particular Vices that have been now mentioned, will think them&s;elves hap|py. They may be as idle, extravagant and in|temperate as they plea&s;e; they may gratify their

Corruptions, at the Expence of their E&s;tates, their Health and their Lives; they may bring their Families to Poverty, and leave them a Burthen to the Public; they may indulge them|&s;elves in Drunkenne&s;s and Rioting, to the Di&s;|turbance of the Quiet and Peace of the Neigh|bourhood, and to the Prejudice of the public Happine&s;s of Society; they may do all this without any one to puni&s;h them, or make them a&s;hamed: And this the&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures call Freedom, Liberty and Happine&s;s. But <HI>What can the Righteous</HI> now <HI>do?</HI> The mo&s;t valuable members of Society mu&s;t, in &s;uch Cir|cum&s;tances, bear a very heavy Burthen: The Public mu&s;t be &s;upported by laying &s;evere Tax|es on u&s;eful Arts and painful Labour, that the luxurious and intemperate, u&s;ele&s;s and even hurtful Members of the Community, may gra|tify their Corruptions at the cheaper Rate.

I will add but one Thing more.</P>
<P>IV. CIVIL Government is the Foundation of Social Happine&s;s as it is de&s;ign'd and adapt|ed to encourage and promote Religion, and to

protect &amp; &s;ecure Men in the Exerci&s;e of their Spiritual or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Rights &amp; Privileges.</P>
<P>NATURAL Religion is e&s;&s;ential to Society; Morality is as indi&s;pen&s;ibly necece&s;&s;ary to the Political Happine&s;s of Communities as it is to the Eternal Happine&s;s of particular Per&s;ons. Were the Practice of the &s;tricte&s;t &amp; mo&s;t exal|ted Morality, &s;uch an one as the Go&s;pel pre|&s;cribes &amp; requires, univer&s;ally to prevail in any Community, it would con&s;titute a &s;ort of Hea|ven upon Earth: And on the contrary, where it is wholly di&s;regarded, where Vice &amp; Wicked|ne&s;s of every Kind maintain an unre&s;trained Do|minion, there is properly an Hell upon Earth. In the intermediate States between the univer&s;al Practi&s;e of Virtue and the uncontrouled Preva|lence of Vice, a Society is happy or mi&s;erable in Proportion as it approaches to one or the other of the&s;e Conditions.</P>
<P>IF the Matter be con&s;idered in this Light, I &s;uppo&s;e no rea&s;onable Man will deny that Reli|gion is an e&s;pecial Object of the Civil Magi&s;|trate's Concern. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary to the Happi|ne&s;s of Society, and to the Security of every Member of it, that the Belief of the Being, and Perfections, and Providence of God &s;hould be kept up; that men &s;hould be acquainted with the Doctrin of the Immortality of the Soul, and of a future &amp; eternal State of Happine&s;s or Mi|&s;ery; that men &s;hould look upon them&s;elves as
<PB N="25" REF="006692_0028_1029A7B2E2B0DFE8">
accountable Creatures, and expect the great and awful Day when they mu&s;t &s;tand before the Tribunal of God, the Sovereign and univer&s;al Judge, to give account of the Actions done in the Fle&s;h, whether they have been good, or whether they have been evil. The firm Belief of &s;uch Things as the&s;e is &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to Social Happine&s;s, that he de&s;erves to be e&s;teemed an Enemy to mankind, who endea|vours to weaken the Evidence, or le&s;&s;en the Importance of them. For without a Belief of the&s;e Things, what &s;hall re&s;train men from in|juring, oppre&s;&s;ing, or even de&s;troying one an|other, when they have, as they frequently will have, opportunity of doing &s;o without any great Danger of being detected &amp; puni&s;hed by the Magi&s;trate? And if a &s;en&s;e of the&s;e Things be taken away, or much weaken'd, what Secu|rity can we po&s;&s;ibly have for the Truth of what men declare under the mo&s;t &s;olemn Oathes? It mu&s;t therefore be allowed, that whatever is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep up the Belief &amp; Practice of na|tural Religion, belongs properly to the Province of the Civil Magi&s;trate; and that his Authority cannot be exerted in a way more agreeable to the Will of God, from whom all Authority pro|ceeds, or indeed more conducive to the De&s;ign of Magi&s;tracy, which is Social Happine&s;s, than when u&s;ed to promote &amp; encourage the&s;e Things, and to puni&s;h and &s;uppre&s;s whatever is contrary to them.</P>

THE Chri&s;tian In&s;titution con&s;idered as &s;uch, or as di&s;tingui&s;hed from natural Religion, is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Sub&s;i&s;tance of Civil Society. This is evident &s;ince there were Go|vernments in the World, and &s;ome of them &s;o wi&s;ely formed and &s;o ju&s;tly admini&s;ter'd, that Social Happine&s;s was tolerably provided for, be|fore men were favoured with the Chri&s;tian Re|velation.

If the Magi&s;trate countenances &amp; &s;upports one Party in oppre&s;&s;ing &amp; per&s;ecuting another, the Con&s;equence will be, that they arrive at a greater &amp; more irreconcila|ble Di&s;tance from each other; Animo&s;ities and Quarrels may be expected; and, when the Par|ties are near equal in Numbers &amp; Strength, a

Civil War is too often the Effect. But when the Magi&s;trate protects all peaceable Subjects in their Religious as well as Civil Rights, and &s;uf|fers no one to oppre&s;s or di&s;turb another, they are mo&s;t likely to act the Part of good Subjects toward their Rulers, and that of good Neigh|bours toward one another: And this is the mo&s;t probable Way to bring men to unite in Judg|ment as well as Affection.</P>
<P>'TIS indeed po&s;&s;ible for men to u&s;e this <HI>Li|berty as a Cloak of Maliciou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> they may in Preaching or even in Prayer u&s;e &s;editious or trea&s;onable Expre&s;&s;ions, they may revile the Ru|lers of their People, contemn &amp; di&s;parage the good Laws of their Country, or &s;lander &amp; abu&s;e their Neighbours. When ever they do &s;o, they are beyond all doubt ju&s;tly puni&s;hable by the Civil Magi&s;trate, and the Peace &amp; Happine&s;s of Hu|man Society do &s;omtimes make it nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould be puni&s;hed with &s;everity. There is nothing in this at all incon&s;i&s;tent with Liberty of Con&s;cience; for my Right to wor&s;hip God according to the Dictates of my own Con&s;ci|ence does by no means include a Right to de|&s;troy the public Happine&s;s of Civil Society, by &s;ubverting the Government of it; nor does it in the lea&s;t Degree authorize me to revile my Su|periors, or to defame &amp; abu&s;e any Man.

<P>PRINCIPLES and Practices which don't affect Civil Society, and &s;o cannot be &s;aid to have any <HI>Political</HI> Evil in them, may yet be evil in a Religious or <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Sen&s;e, and &s;o may ju&s;tly expo&s;e Men to Church Cen&s;ures: But then the&s;e Cen&s;ures ought not to have Civil Puni&s;hments annexed to them; becau&s;e it is only Political Evil that de&s;erves Political Puni&s;h|ment.

Cen&s;ure, cannot, I think, be reconciled to the&s;e Precepts. But neither the&s;e nor any other Texts of Scripture that I know of require the Civil Magi&s;trate to annex temporal Pains and Penalties to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ures.</P>
<P>WHILE the Civil Magi&s;trate continued Hea|then, the Church had as much Right to cen&s;ure its own members as it has now; and while its Cen&s;ures were admini&s;tred agreeable to the Will and Command of Chri&s;t, &amp; with a Dependance on Him to &s;ucceed them, they be&s;t an&s;wered the Intentions for which they were in&s;tituted. But when the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire became Chri&s;tian, 'twas pretended that it belonged to the Magi&s;trate to &s;trengthen the Hands of the Church by annex|ing Civil Puni&s;hments to her Cen&s;ures. When this Point was once gained, the Party that could by any means ingratiate it &s;elf with the Empe|ror, was &s;ure to per&s;ecute all the Re&s;t. They all had their Turns of Suffering, and they that thus <HI>took the Sword</HI> did many of them <HI>peri&s;h by the Sword: Con&s;tantine</HI> the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Em|peror, bani&s;hed the <HI>Arians,</HI> and his Son did the &s;ame by the <HI>Orthodox.</HI></P>
<P>IT was at fir&s;t pretended that this belonged to the Civil Magi&s;trate by virtue of his being <HI>a nur&s;ing Father</HI> to the Church; and 'twas &s;aid that <HI>mild</HI> &amp; <HI>moderate</HI> Puni&s;hments were all that were de&s;ired, or proper to be u&s;ed in this Ca&s;e: But in Proce&s;s of Time the Magi&s;trate was de|graded

from the honourable Character of a <HI>nur|&s;ing Father</HI> into the mean and ignoble one of a mere <HI>Executioner.</HI> In &s;ome Countries which call them&s;elves Chri&s;tian, the Civil Magi&s;trate is at this Day obliged, under the Penalty of Ex|communication, which with them includes a For|feiture of his Temporal Dominion, to inflict <HI>Ca|pital Puni&s;hments</HI> of the mo&s;t <HI>cruel</HI> &amp; <HI>barbarous</HI> Kind, upon all that are condemned by the Church for Here&s;y.

<P>WHEN the Foundations are de&s;troyed by the Civil Magi&s;trate's neglecting to countenance and encourage Religion, or to protect men in the peaceable Exerci&s;e of their Religious Rights; and e&s;pecially when he joins with one Party to per&s;ecute &amp; de&s;troy all that di&s;&s;ent from them, 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee that the Righteous will be bro't under peculiar Difficulties, and be the greate&s;t Sufferers. A man of no Religion can comply with the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion, how corrupt &s;o|ever it be; He that believes nothing can profe&s;s any Thing; he that makes Con&s;cience of no|thing can conform to any Thing; and he that
<PB N="34" REF="006692_0037_1029A7CD2F6CE650">
cares not whether he wor&s;hips God at all, will not be very &s;olicitous about the manner or modes of Wor&s;hip. Thus the irreligious Part of man|kind can ea&s;ily e&s;cape Per&s;ecution in the&s;e Ca&s;es: But the Righteous, they who make Con&s;cience of what they do, cannot &s;ub&s;cribe Articles of Faith which they e&s;teem fal&s;e or unfound, nor profe&s;s what they do not believe; they cannot conform to what they judge corrupt &amp; &s;inful, though e&s;tabli&s;hed by the highe&s;t Human Au|thority; nor dare they neglect to attend &s;uch Wor&s;hip &amp; Ordinances as they find God has in|&s;tituted, even tho' the Laws of their Country &s;hould make it penal to attend them. Thus Men of Hone&s;ty &amp; Sincerity, &s;uch as really en|deavour to &s;erve &amp; plea&s;e God, and to obtain his Favour to eternal Life, are the Men that will &s;uffer when the Foundations of common Secu|rity and Safety are thus de&s;troyed.</P>

<P>I. WITH all the Defference due to the Cha|racter of Magi&s;tracy, and yet with the Freedom that becomes a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, I would addre&s;s the Honorable the GOVERNOR, the DEPUTY-GOVERNOR, &amp; ASSISTANTS of this Colony, with the REPRESENTA|TIVES <HI>of the Free-men</HI> of the &s;ame, now a&s;&s;em|bled in a <HI>general Court of Election.</HI></P>

<HI>My honoured Fathers,</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE been endeavouring, tho' in a weak and imperfect Manner, to repre&s;ent the De&s;ign and U&s;efulne&s;s, and con&s;equently the Dignity &amp; Importance of that Office which Divine Provi|dence has placed you in. My De&s;ign herein has been to promote &s;uch a Direction &amp; Exer|ci&s;e of the Authority you are ve&s;ted with, as is agreeable to the wi&s;e &amp; benevolent De&s;igns of God in the In&s;titution of Civil Government; &s;uch an one as &s;hall render you eminent Bene|factors to the People of this Colony, and the dignified In&s;truments of promoting Public Peace and Social Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing of greater Importance to Men in any Office, than frequently calling to Mind the original De&s;ign and great End of the Office they &s;u&s;tain. This naturally &s;ugge&s;ts to their Thoughts what are the peculiar Duties in|cumbent on them, what the great God expects and requires of them, and how they mu&s;t con|duct them&s;elves at pre&s;ent, if they would at la&s;t be able to give their Accounts with Joy. In this View the Practice of preaching on this Oc|ca&s;ion which I &s;uppo&s;e has been continued from the very Beginning of this Government, appears very rea&s;onable &amp; proper. For though it will frequently happen (as I am very &s;en&s;ible it does this Day in particular) that the Preacher &s;hall have le&s;s acquaintance with the Nature &amp; Me|thods

of Government than a great Part of his Hearers, yet being obliged to apply his mind with &s;ome clo&s;e Attention to the Subject he di&s;|cour&s;es upon, he may perhaps &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome Things, which though known, would not o|therwi&s;e have been &s;o di&s;tinctly thought of, and &s;o one who cannot Pretend to in&s;truct you, may yet <HI>&s;tir up your minds by way of Remem|brance.</HI></P>
<P>GOVERNMENT is the Foundation of the Peace and Happine&s;s of men con&s;idered as for|med into Civil Society; it is &s;o in the gracious De&s;ign of God, and it will be &s;o in the Event, at lea&s;t in all ordinary Ca&s;es, if it be &s;uitably Conducted and Admini&s;tred. The two great Things nece&s;&s;ary to this Purpo&s;e, are, the enacting wi&s;e &amp; righteous Laws, and the admi|ni&s;tring Ju&s;tice according to them, both in Civil and Criminal Cau&s;es, with a &s;teady &amp; impartial Hand. The&s;e both belong to your Province, as you are a&s;&s;embled this Day not only in your Legi&s;lative Capacity, but al&s;o to appoint &s;uch executive Officers to whom the Admini&s;tration of Law &amp; Ju&s;tice is to be committed. Allow me to &s;ay that both God &amp; man expect that in both the&s;e important Branches of your Authority you keep the great &amp; original De&s;ign of Govern|ment in a near View, and &s;incerely aim at pro|moting the Public Welfare of His Maje&s;ty's Subjec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> under your immediate Government.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="006692_0040_1029A7D8C57CC518">
THE happy Con&s;titution of this Government is &s;uch, that I cannot think it needful to caution you again&s;t carrying the Civil Authority of the Magi&s;trate too high, or fixing a Tyrannical Ad|mini&s;tration upon us: Since you are Members of the &s;ame Society with us, and hold your Seats in the Admini&s;tration over us by the annual Choice of the Community. I wi&s;h I could &s;ay there was as little Danger of having the Foundations of our Public Peace &amp; Social Hap|pine&s;s de&s;troyed, or even &s;haken, by Popular Di&s;content and Unea&s;ine&s;s. This I take to be the peculiar Danger in Elective Governments. It will frequently happen that &s;uch Mea&s;ures as are nece&s;&s;ary, or highly conducive to Public Good, &s;hall be very unpopular. People in general cannot be thought &s;ufficiently &s;killed in the Nature of Government, or enough acquain|ted with public Affairs to know what Mea&s;ures are proper to be taken in a great variety of Ca|&s;es that frequently happen. And though, if let alone, they will not ordinarily be de&s;irous of a Change of Government, &s;o long as the Admi|ni&s;tration is &s;teady, uniform, and impartial, and the good Ends of Government are in a comfor|table Degree an&s;wered; Yet it mu&s;t be owned that it is too ea&s;y for crafty&punc; de&s;igning Men to work upon them, to propagate a &s;pirit of Un|ea&s;ine&s;s &amp; Di&s;affection, and &s;o to lead a Society into Parties. In this Ca&s;e the Magi&s;trate who
<PB N="38" REF="006692_0041_1029A7DA849825C0">
e&s;pou&s;es an unpopular Mea&s;ure, tho' it be in it &s;elf ever &s;o ju&s;t &amp; rea&s;onable, and even nece&s;&s;ary, incurs the Danger of being left out at the next E|lection. In &s;uch Circum&s;tances the Security of this Colony depends very much upon the Re&s;o|lution &amp; Virtue of its Magi&s;trates. Should &s;uch a Ca&s;e happen, we tru&s;t that you, our Political Fathers, will approve your &s;elves the firm and immoveable Foundations of our Happine&s;s, by &s;teadily pur&s;uing what in your Wi&s;dom you judge our true Intere&s;t, even though it &s;hould happen to be again&s;t the prevailing Opinion of the People. For it certainly becomes you as Fathers of your Country, not to humour &amp; in|dulge us to our Hurt, but by a wi&s;e, righteous, and mild Admini&s;tration to promote our Good.</P>
<P>THE Things that have been mentioned as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Social Happine&s;s, &s;uch as the Secu|ring men in their Per&s;ons &amp; Properties, the pro|moting &s;uch Things as tend to the Public Good, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing whatever is contrary thereto, the countenancing &amp; encouraging Religion &amp; pro|tecting men in the quiet Enjoyment of Religious Rights &amp; Privileges, de&s;erve your &s;erious Con&s;i|deration &amp; con&s;tant Attention. For without the&s;e Things the Intentions of Government can|not be an&s;wered, and a &s;light Attention or Indif|ference with regard to any one of them will greatly endanger, if not certainly de&s;troy the Foundations of Public Peace &amp; Social Happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="006692_0042_1029A7DC06536280">
PERMIT me to recommend it as a Thing worthy of your mo&s;t &s;erious Con&s;ideration, whether nothing further can be done to reform mens Morals, &amp; to put a &s;top to the Growth of Inju&s;tice and Profanene&s;s, Idlene&s;s and Extrava|gance, Intemperance, and Uncleanne&s;s, which are &s;o vi&s;ibly increa&s;ing upon us, and do &s;o aw|fully threaten to be our Ruin. We have good Laws again&s;t &s;uch Vices as the&s;e; but it de&s;erves to be con&s;idered whether there is not &s;ome fur|ther Provi&s;ion wanting to carry them into &s;uch a vigorous &amp; &s;teady Execution, as the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Things &s;eems plainly to require. Penal Laws are de&s;igned to procure Public Safety; Offenders are to be puni&s;hed that others may hear and fear, and &s;o be re&s;trained from &s;uch Practices as are incon&s;i&s;tent with the Safety and Happine&s;s of Human Society. If therefore the Laws again&s;t <HI>Theft</HI> &amp; <HI>Burglary</HI> (for In&s;tance) &s;erve no higher Purpo&s;e than to help the Owner in recovering Goods Stolen from him, which 'tis generally known is too often the Ca&s;e; though it cannot be &s;aid that the&s;e Laws do no Good at all, yet it is plain that they do not an&s;wer the proper Intention of Penal Laws, nor afford that Security to the Public which Social Happine&s;s evidently requires. And indeed Penal Laws in general, if they are not put in Execution, do ra|ther hinder than promote the Good of the Pub|lic, as they inure People to a Di&s;regard to the
<PB N="40" REF="006692_0043_1029A7E44814C190">
Law, and a Contempt of the Authority of Ru|lers.</P>
<P>IF the Rea&s;on of &s;o general a Remi&s;ne&s;s in the Execution of Penal Laws be inquired into, perhaps it will be found very much owing to our Executive Officers acting &s;o much Singly, and not meeting in a Body as is practi&s;ed in o|ther Governments. It is not to be wonder'd at if a &s;ingle <HI>Grand-Juryman,</HI> or a &s;ingle <HI>Ju&s;tice of the Peace,</HI> &s;hould in many Ca&s;es be ignorant of the Duty of his Office, or at a Lo&s;s with Re|gard to the Method and Forms in which he ought to proceed: Nor even, if in &s;ome Ca&s;es he &s;hould be intimidated, and afraid to proceed again&s;t &s;ome particular Offenders. Whereas if they were regularly to meet in a Body, and act conjunctly, one would in&s;truct &amp; encourage an|other; they would thus be under much greater Advantages for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing vicious &amp; de&s;tructive Practices, and there would be much le&s;s Danger of encouraging Wickedne&s;s by &s;uffering Offen|ders to go unpuni&s;hed. If I am rightly infor|med this is the only Government within the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions; in which the <HI>Ju&s;tices</HI> and <HI>Grand-Jury</HI> of a County do not &s;tatedly meet in their Se&s;&s;ions of the Peace: And perhaps if they did &s;o with us, it would be as uncommon to &s;ee an open Tran&s;gre&s;&s;or of the Laws of his Country e&s;cape with Impunity, as it now is to &s;ee &s;uch an one pro&s;ecuted to Effect.</P>

<P>THE great De&s;ign of that &s;acred Office we &s;u&s;tain, is to promote the Glory of God, by advancing the Intentions of redeeming Wi&s;dom and Grace in the eternal Salvation of men. It is of infinite Con&s;equence that we keep this in our View, and that our Conduct in Public and Private, be directed and influenced by a &s;teady and con&s;tant Regard to it. The <HI>Foundations</HI> we are principally concerned with, are tho&s;e <HI>of Repentance from dead Works, &amp; of Faith towards God.</HI> That the&s;e may be laid deep and firm in the Hearts of men, and &s;o as to bear the Su|per&s;tructure of an holy &amp; religious Life, we mu&s;t endeavour to awaken carele&s;s &amp; &s;tupid Sinners, who are &s;leeping on the Brink of eternal Ruin, and to warn them <HI>to flee from the wrath to come;</HI> and we mu&s;t direct the weary and heavy laden Sinner to Je&s;us who is <HI>the Way, the Truth, &amp; the Life,</HI> and but by whom <HI>no man cometh unto the Father.</HI> Having led our Hearers to Chri&s;t both for Righteou&s;ne&s;s to ju&s;tify their Per&s;ons, &amp; for Grace to renew &amp; &s;anctify their Natures, and to furni&s;h their Souls with the Principles of Evan|gelical &amp; acceptable Obedience; we are on this Foundation to build all the Virtues &amp; Duties of

the Chri&s;tian Life. We mu&s;t explain all the Du|ties of the Moral Law, in that Latitude &amp; Extent wherein they are inculcated in the Go&s;pel; and we mu&s;t inforce the Ob&s;ervation of them by &s;et|ting tho&s;e exalted and powerful Obligations to Holine&s;s and practical Religion which are pecu|liarly Evangelical, in the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t af|fecting Light we are capable of.</P>
<P>'TIS no &s;mall or incon&s;iderable Part of our Work to explain &amp; inforce Relative Duties, or the Virtues which are peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary &amp; con|ducive to Social Happine&s;s. Religion never ap|pears in a more amiabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Light than when it di&s;|po&s;es men to a ready &amp; chearful Performance of relative &amp; &s;ocial Duties. When they that before were &s;tubborn &amp; di&s;obedient to their Superiors in Civil, Sacred, or Dome&s;tic Relations, and con|tinually ready to join with the turbulent &amp; facti|ous, in fomenting Unea&s;ine&s;s &amp; promoting Con|tentions, become &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &amp; obedient, ready to pay all proper Regards to tho&s;e who are &s;et o|ver them, and &s;tudious to promote the &s;ame Temper in all they conver&s;e with; when they that once were proud, haughty &amp; in&s;olent to their Inferiors, become humble, affable and gentle; when &s;uch as formerly were cruel, malicious, re|vengeful &amp; implacable, become kind, meek, cha|ritable &amp; forgiving; when, I &s;ay, &s;uch a Change as this appears in a man's Temper &amp; Conduct, upon his profe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian, 'tis

hardly po&s;&s;ible for an Infidel to doubt the Di|vine Original of the Go&s;pel. But when nothing like this appears on Men's making the highe&s;t Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, and even boa&s;ting of their Experiences of a work of Grace on their own Souls; and e&s;pecially when the vi&s;ible Change is the very Rever&s;e of this, what can be expected but that the &s;acred Name of God &s;hould be bla&s;|phemed, and the Minds of many filled with un|conquerable Prejudices again&s;t all &s;erious Reli|gion? And when a righteous GOD <HI>maketh Inqui|&s;ition for Blood,</HI> He will <HI>remember</HI> and take ven|geance of Per&s;ons of this Character, for in their <HI>Skirts</HI> will be <HI>found Blood,</HI> even the Blood of Religion it &s;elf.</P>
<P>'TIS our Duty, my Fathers &amp; Brethren, to in|gage our Hearers to adorn the Doctrin of God their Saviour by the Di&s;charge of Social Duties, and in a particular Manner of tho&s;e they owe to their Civil Rulers, the Di&s;charge of which is, as we have heard, &s;o very nece&s;&s;ary to render Go|vernment a &s;olid &amp; durable Foundation of Pub|lic Peace &amp; Happine&s;s. The in&s;pired Apo&s;tles thought this a matter of &s;o great Importance that they frequently mention it, and in&s;i&s;t upon it in their Epi&s;tles: Nor did they think it enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o in&s;ert it in their Epi&s;tles to the Churches, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they left it in Charge to Mini&s;ters to preach upon the&s;e Duties. <HI>Put them in mind</HI> (&s;ays St. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Titus</HI>) <HI>to be &s;ubject to Principalities &amp; Powers,</HI>

<P>OUR Lord &amp; Ma&s;ter, who&s;e we are &amp; whom it ought to be our highe&s;t Ambition to imitate and &s;erve, di&s;covered the greate&s;t Love to Man|kind that the World ever heard of; &s;uch Love as is the object of the Admiration &amp; A&s;toni&s;h|ment of the Angelic World, and the delightful Subject of tho&s;e Prai&s;es which are &s;ung in Sera|phic Strains in the Temple above. This led Him to pity &amp; relieve them under the Mi&s;eries of the pre&s;ent Life, as well as to provide for their future &amp; eternal Happine&s;s. The Prophet ele|gantly de&s;cribes Him as <HI>bearing our Griefs,</HI> and <HI>carrying</HI> away our <HI>Sorrows,</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. liii, 4.</NOTE> and tho' this ulti|mately refers to his Sufferings for our Salvati|on, yet the Evangeli&s;t &s;peaks of this Prophecy as being in &s;ome &s;en&s;e <HI>fulfilled</HI> when Je&s;us <HI>ca&s;t out</HI> evil <HI>Spirits, and healed all that were Sick</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth viii, 16. 17.</NOTE>.

<P>BUT it is more than Time that I &s;hould,</P>
<P>III. IN the la&s;t Place, apply what has been &s;aid in an Addre&s;s to this numerous A&s;&s;embly. And this I mu&s;t do in a few Words.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee, my Brethren, what abundant Rea&s;on we have to be thankful to God for the Appoint|ment of Civil Government, and for ca&s;ting our Lot under &s;o equitable a Con&s;titution &amp; &s;o righ|teous &amp; mild an Admini&s;tration; that we enjoy &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing Privileges, &amp; that the Founda|tions of our public Peace &amp; Happine&s;s do as yet &s;tand &s;o firm &amp; &s;ecure. It becomes us at all times to maintain &amp; expre&s;s a thankful Sen&s;e of the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing Favours of Heaven, &amp; e&s;pecially &s;hould we do &s;o, when as at this Day, we are favoured with the Return of an <HI>Anniver&s;ary</HI> E|LECTION. It is a Time of Joy with us, and it becomes us to <HI>rejoice in the Lord,</HI> and triumph in the God of our Salvation. Thankfulne&s;s to God for the&s;e Favours, if it be &s;incere, will pro|duce
<PB N="50" REF="006692_0053_1029A801D52187D8">
in us great Carefulne&s;s that we do not by any means abu&s;e and forfeit our Privileges; &amp; it will prevent tho&s;e Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es, Di&s;contents &amp; Divi&s;ions, which, if indulged, may ju&s;tly pro|voke a holy God to deprive us of them, and to turn this, which has for &s;o long a Time been a Day of Gladne&s;s and Rejoicing, into a Day of Lamentation and Mourning.</P>
<P>THOUGH Government is de&s;igned and &s;uited to &s;ecure Public Happine&s;s, and though Magi|&s;trates wi&s;ely &amp; faithfully endeavour to promote the great de&s;ign of their Office, &amp; continually at|tend to this very Thing; yet it will be in the Pow|er of the People to defeat the De&s;ign, and render them&s;elves &amp; their Po&s;terity mi&s;erable after all. They take the direct way to Ruin, when they in|dulge groundle&s;s Jealou&s;ies of their Rulers, and &s;pread idle Reports to the Di&s;advantage of their Characters, when they join with the Di&s;contented &amp; Unea&s;y, &amp; by their Clamours, Animo&s;ities &amp; Divi&s;ions di&s;hearten their Rulers, weaken the Ad|mini&s;tration of Government, and render it le&s;s capable of producing its &s;alutary Effects. Peo|ple contribute to their own Mi&s;ery when they indulge them&s;elves in Idlene&s;s, Extravagance, Intemperance &amp; the like vicious Practices, which as we have &s;een tend to de&s;troy the public Peace and Happine&s;s of Human Society.</P>
<P>I MUST add, that People really help to de|&s;troy the Foundations of their own Happine&s;s,
<PB N="51" REF="006692_0054_1029A8051F76E6B0">
when from a re&s;tle&s;s &amp; unea&s;y Spirit, they are con|tinually &amp; without any ju&s;t Rea&s;on endeavouring a Change of the principal Per&s;ons in the Admi|ni&s;tration of Government. I know the Freemen of this Colony have the Right of chu&s;ing their own Rulers annually, and I acknowlege it is a great Privilege, &s;uch an one as if wi&s;ely improv|ed, will greatly conduce to the perpetuating our Pro&s;perity &amp; Happine&s;s. But then it mu&s;t be granted, on the other Hand, that it is capable of being abu&s;ed to the great Detriment of Public Happine&s;s. If the Freemen of this Colony &s;hould ever admit it as a Principle, or make it the Rule in giving their Votes, that a Magi&s;trate of known Ability &amp; approved Faithfulne&s;s is to be laid a|&s;ide, merely becau&s;e he cannot be brought to con|&s;ent to &s;uch Mea&s;ures as he e&s;teems prejudicial to his Country, tho' they happen to be popular, what is this but in Effect &s;aying that neither Wi&s;|dom nor Fidelity are of any u&s;e in a Magi&s;trate? For he that has neither of them, can Vote accor|ding to the Humour or Prejudices of the People, and in many Ca&s;es is more likely to do &s;o than he that has them both. And &s;urely a Principle which would render the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Qualifi|cations in a Magi&s;trate u&s;ele&s;s, mu&s;t tend to de|&s;troy the Foundations of public Happine&s;s, and therefore ought not to be admitted, or acted upon.</P>
<P>To conclude, Let us all endeavour, in our &s;everal Stations, faithfully to Di&s;charge the Duties
<PB N="52" REF="006692_0055_1029A80A2FA55788">
incumbent on us, and wi&s;ely to improve the advantages put into our Hands for promoting the Glory of Divine goodne&s;s both in the tem|poral and eternal Happine&s;s of men. To quick|en us to the greater Activity &amp; Diligence in &s;er|ving our Generation according to the will of God, let us con&s;ider that all our abilities &amp; op|portunities for u&s;efulne&s;s are Talents commit|ted to our Tru&s;t by our Great Lord, &amp; Ma&s;ter, and that the Improvement of them mu&s;t at la&s;t be accounted for to Him. Let us call to mind that neither the highe&s;t pitch of Grandure and Authority nor the lowe&s;t State of Meanne&s;s &amp; Ob&s;curity will exempt any Per&s;on from being called to a &s;trict Account. Let us think before|hand of the great and awful Day, when <HI>the dead both &s;mall and great</HI> &s;hall &s;tand before the Judg|ment Seat of Chri&s;t, and remember that we who this Day appear before God in his Hou&s;e, as men of &s;uch different Orders &amp; Degrees as are &s;uited to the pre&s;ent State of Things, &s;hall pro|bably never meet again in one A&s;&s;embly, till that important &amp; deci&s;ive Day when all the&s;e Di&s;tin|ctions &s;hall vani&s;h, and we &s;hall all &s;tand upon a Level at the Bar of a righteous Judge <HI>that every one may receive the Things done in his Body, ac|cording to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, <HI>the Lord grant unto us</HI> all <HI>that</HI> we <HI>may find mercy of the Lord in that Day.</HI> AMEN.</P>
