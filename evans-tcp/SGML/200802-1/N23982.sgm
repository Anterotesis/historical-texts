<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of this Collection has long de&s;ired from the pre&s;s, &s;ome judicious work, adapted to the meridian of the UNITED STATES; directing the choice of a companion for life: delineating and enforcing the du|ties and moral plea&s;ures of the conjugal &s;tate; and de|picting, in &s;triking colours, the foibles and vices, which are its di&s;grace and bane.</P>
<P>Among the di&s;tingui&s;hing ble&s;&s;ings of a benign PROV|IDENCE which claim our national gratitude, the condi|tion of &s;ociety, as it re&s;pects the two &s;exes, appears of the fir&s;t magnitude.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An appo&s;ite and valuable Note offers it&s;elf from the learn|ed and philo&s;ophic PRIESTLEY.
<Q>The &s;ources of general hap|pine&s;s in a &s;tate, mu&s;t not always be looked for in &s;uch &s;trik|ing circum&s;tances, as government, religion, laws, arts, and commerce, though an attention to the&s;e be allowed to be the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential in a well-regulated &s;tate. Allowing the&s;e re|qui&s;ites to pro&s;perity to be in the be&s;t condition imaginable, we mu&s;t wait till we have taken a nearer view of a people, in private and dome&s;tic life, before we can ju&s;tly pronounce, whether they really enjoy their &s;ituation. <HI>We mu&s;t not infer, that becau&s;e men's liberty and property are &s;ecure, and in a way of being advanced, that therefore they are happy.</HI> We mu&s;t al&s;o in|&s;pect their prevailing manners and cu&s;toms, con&s;ider the terms upon which common acquaintance live and conver&s;e together, and <HI>particularly in what manner the two &s;exes behave to one another.</HI> Other objects of attention are &s;uch, as may more properly be &s;aid to guard again&s;t unhappine&s;s. The&s;e are the things which actually impart the chief plea&s;ures that &s;weeten the cup of life, which diffu&s;e a &s;pirit of cheerfulne&s;s over &s;ociety, and give a reli&s;h to all the advantages of it.</Q>
&mdash;<HI>Lect. on Hi&s;t.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>In this &s;eque&s;tered happy region, "Marriage," which generally has love for its ba&s;is,
<Q>is honourable in all;</Q>
and the &s;exes have not yet learnt, from the ex|ample
<PB N="vi" REF="031725_0005_0FEE1D69B1CAFA90">
of the elder world, to cheri&s;h illiberal &s;entiments of each other.</P>
<P>Here is no invidious di&s;tinction of patricians and ple|beians, fixing an unnatural barrier between kindred &s;ouls; and prompting to the gratification of family pride by &s;plendid, rather than virtuous and affectionate alliances. The female mind is, probably, no where, &s;o generally cultivated, and adorned with that knowledge and &s;enti|ment, which qualify for the conjugal, and parental rela|tions. The RIGHTS OF WOMEN, as well as OF MEN, are acknowledged; and (a few in&s;tances excepted, in which the application of <HI>American</HI> or <HI>Republican</HI> to the title of <HI>Hu&s;band</HI> is a mere &s;oleci&s;m) they are care&s;&s;ed as the fir&s;t and deare&s;t friends of their partners. The ne|ce&s;&s;ary means of &s;upporting dome&s;tic life, are the reward of indu&s;try to every cla&s;s of our citizens: which invites to the early and general e&s;tabli&s;hment of the matrimo|nial union.</P>
<P>When, therefore, we con&s;ider the a&s;pect, which this union has upon the hi&s;tory of human life, and the hap|pine&s;s or mi&s;ery in&s;eparable from it; the due regulation of our choice mu&s;t be e&s;teemed of high moment.</P>
<P>The very numerous and uninformed pupils in the &s;chool of matrimony, require the advice of &s;ome friend|ly PRECEPTOR; who, taught by per&s;onal ob&s;ervation, and the &s;entiments of others well-&s;killed in the knowl|edge of mankind, may prevent a precipitate &s;tep in &s;uch an important in&s;tance; and teach the mo&s;t probable method of acquiring permanent felicity in the married &s;tate. Neither does the condition of per&s;ons, already united in the hymeneal bonds, preclude the aid of &s;uch a PRECEPTOR, or, at lea&s;t, impartial SPECTATOR, in preventing or correcting errors, and di&s;charging the va|rious conjugal and parental offices, with fidelity and ever|growing delight.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="031725_0006_0FEE1D6D10719458">To promote the&s;e great objects, is the de&s;ign and tendency of the &s;ub&s;equent Work, being chiefly a Col|lection from the mo&s;t celebrated Writers ancient and modern.</P>
<P>Much has been read upon the &s;ubjects here di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and much rejected, as too local, and totally inapplicable to the &s;tate of &s;ociety in the AMERICAN REPUBLIC; or as deviating from the delicacy and dignity of virtu|ous attachment. The author acknowledges his obliga|tions to the Engli&s;h MATRIMONIAL PRECEPTOR for the origin of his plan, and for many valuable Numbers previou&s;ly collected, which he has adopted, with nece&s;|&s;ary amendments. Two or three in&s;tances excepted, he has de&s;ignedly omitted &s;electing from the SPECTA|TOR, which &s;upplied the materials for nearly a fourth part of that work; becau&s;e it is in mo&s;t hands. The extracts from CICERO's and PLINY's epi&s;tles are pre|&s;ented, in the pre&s;ent Collection, from the elegant and unrivalled tran&s;lation of MELMOTH. A few obvious re|marks of the Compiler are inter&s;per&s;ed with tho&s;e of the periodical and other writers, which enrich his volume. In &s;electing from the&s;e writers, around who&s;e brow an impartial and enlightened public has agreed to entwine the merited laurel, and who therefore need not a par|ticular eulogy; variety connected with in&s;truction and entertainment has been &s;edulou&s;ly &s;ought.</P>
<P>Many &s;evere animadver&s;ions, which have been ap|plied indi&s;criminately by Europeans to the female world, have been here omitted or &s;oftened; becau&s;e the AME|RICAN SPECTATOR contemplates a very &s;mall part of his countrywomen, as involved in their cen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">res.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Even the gentle Mrs. GRIFFITH &s;peaks of

A &s;imilar regard to propriety and truth has led him to pa&s;s by general cen&s;ures of his own &s;ex.</P>
<P>The arrangement has not been ha&s;tily executed; but has been the &s;ubject of mature and frequent reflection and revi&s;ion. The &s;tricte&s;t delicacy has been main|tained through the whole.</P>
<P>The Work has been attempted, from an ardent de&s;ire of promoting the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of &s;ociety in the na|tive country of its Author. He flatters him&s;elf, that, aided by &s;uch re&s;pectable authority, he may &s;ucce&s;sfully teach not a few of his own &s;ex, THE ART OF MAKING THEMSELVES AND THEIR COMPANIONS HAPPY. He hopes to contribute to the improvement and felicity of the FAIR SEX, for whom he early imbibed a very re|&s;pectful attachment, and to which he profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf indebted for the DEAREST SOLACE of his life.</P>
<P>The execution of this plan has been completed at the in&s;tance, and &s;anctioned by the approbation, of &s;everal amiable and judicious friends of each &s;ex. Amu&s;ement and in&s;truction truly e&s;timable, pre&s;ent them&s;elves from the pages of a CICERO, a PLINY, a PLUTARCH among the ancients; of an ADDISON, a STEELE, a JOHNSON, a HAWKESWORTH, a FORDYCE, an AIKIN, and others among the moderns, eminent in the walks of literature and of life. It is de&s;igned for the humbler as well as the more elevated ranks, for the country as well as the city. It may be equally &s;erviceable to the Readers &s;cat|tered along the frequented coa&s;ts of the ATLANTIC, or to tho&s;e &s;eated by the &s;treams of the PENOBSCOT, the MERRIMAC, the CONNECTICUT, the HUDSON, the DELAWARE, the OHIO, the POTOMAC, the TENNESSE, the ROANOKE, the SANTEE, or the SAVANNAH.</P>
<P>An impartial public will determine concerning the u&s;e|fulne&s;s of the de&s;ign, or the judiciou&s;ne&s;s of the execution.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN di&s;charging the office of MATRIMONIAL PRE|CEPTOR, I con&s;ider it as a duty incumbent upon me, to vindicate the FEMALE SEX again&s;t the indi&s;criminate a&s;per&s;ions of illiberality. Incongruous would be the at|tempt, of recommending an indi&s;&s;oluble union with that &s;ex, whil&s;t they were viewed unworthy of our confidence or complacence.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="031725_0013_0FEE1D868A7DA370">A favourable opinion of their moral and mental accom|pli&s;hments, will naturally produce an honourable attach|ment in the gentlemen, who would &s;eek their approbation, not by adulation and folly, but by the manly virtues. Im|perfection, we acknowledge, is &s;tamped upon the daugh|ters, as well as the &s;ons of Adam. It is one de&s;ign of this work, to exhibit and correct the errors, to which they are expo&s;ed. But it is a &s;entiment, &s;upported by per&s;onal ob|&s;ervation, and the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authorities, that, in a comparative e&s;timate of the two &s;exes, the &s;cale will <HI>greatly</HI> preponderate in their favour.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent letter of the cla&s;&s;ical MELMOTH pre&s;ents a ju&s;t repre&s;entation of the &s;ubject. It &s;eems calculated to lead my gentle readers to the cultivation of every female excellence, that will render them ornaments of &s;ociety in &s;ingle life, and qualify them for di&s;tingui&s;hed u&s;efulne&s;s and rational enjoyment in the conjugal or parental relations.</P>
<P>"It &s;eems evident, that there are certain moral bounda|ries, which nature has drawn between the two &s;exes; and that neither of them can pa&s;s over the limits of the other, without equally deviating from the beauty and decorum of their re&s;pective characters. Boadicea in armour is, to me at lea&s;t, as extravagant a &s;ight, as Achilles in petticoats.</P>
<P>"In determining, therefore, the comparative merit of the two &s;exes, it is no derogation from female excellency, that it differs in kind from that which di&s;tingui&s;hes the male part of our &s;pecies. And if it generally &s;hall be found, (what, upon an impartial inquiry, I believe, will mo&s;t cer|tainly be found) that women fill up their appointed circle of action with greater regularity and dignity, than men; the claim of preference cannot ju&s;tly be decided in our fa|vour. In the prudential and economical parts of life, I think it undeniable that they ri&s;e far above us. And if true fortitude of mind is be&s;t di&s;covered by a cheerful re|&s;ignation to the mea&s;ures of Providence, we &s;hall not find rea&s;on, perhaps, to claim that mo&s;t &s;ingular of the human virtues as our peculiar privilege. There are numbers of the other &s;ex, who, from the natural delicacy of their con|&s;titution, pa&s;s through one continued &s;cene of &s;uffering,
<PB N="15" REF="031725_0014_0FEE1D881302CE58">
from their cradles to their graves, with a firmne&s;s of re&s;o|lution, that would de&s;erve &s;o many &s;tatues to be erected to their memories, if heroi&s;m were not e&s;timated more by the &s;plendor than the merit of actions.</P>
<P>"But whatever real difference there may be between the moral or intellectual powers of the male and female mind; nature does not &s;eem to have marked the di&s;tinction &s;o &s;trongly as our vanity is willing to imagine: and after all, perhaps, education will be found to con&s;titute the principal &s;uperiority. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, at lea&s;t, that in this article we have every advantage over the &s;ofter &s;ex, that art and indu&s;try can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ecure to us. The mo&s;t animating examples of Greece and Rome are &s;et before us, as early as we are capable of any ob&s;ervation; and the noble&s;t compo&s;itions of the ancients are given into our hands, almo&s;t as &s;oon as we have &s;trength to hold them: whil&s;t the employments of the other &s;ex, at the &s;ame peri|od of life, are generally the rever&s;e of every thing that can open and enlarge their minds, or fill them with ju&s;t and rational notions. The truth of it is, female education is &s;o much wor&s;e than none, as it is better to leave the mind to its natural and unin&s;tructed &s;ugge&s;tions, than to lead it into fal&s;e pur&s;uits, and contract its views, by turning them upon the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t trifling objects.</P>
<P>"We &s;eem, indeed, by the manner in which we &s;uffer the youth of that &s;ex to be trained, to con&s;ider women agreeably to the opinion of certain Mahometan doctors, and treat them as if we believed they have no &s;ouls: why el&s;e are they
<Q><L>Bred only and completed to the ta&s;te</L>

<L>To dre&s;s, and troul the tongue, and roll the eye?</L>
<BIBL>MILTON.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>"This &s;trange neglect of cultivating the female mind can hardly be allowed as good policy, when it is con&s;idered how much the intere&s;t of &s;ociety is concerned in the recti|tude of their under&s;tandings. That &s;ea&s;on of every man's life, which is mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions,
<PB N="16" REF="031725_0015_0FEE1D8B7B0C16C0">
is nece&s;&s;arily under female direction; as there are few in|&s;tances, perhaps, in which that &s;ex is not one of the &s;ecret &s;prings, which regulates the mo&s;t important movements of private or public tran&s;actions. What CATO ob&s;erved of his countrymen is in one re&s;pect true of every nation un|der the &s;un&mdash;'The Romans,' &s;aid he, 'govern the world, but it is the women that govern the Romans.' Let not, however, a certain pretended Cato of your acquaintance take occa&s;ion from this maxim to in&s;ult a &s;econd time that innocence he has &s;o often injured: for I will tell him another maxim as true as the former, That there are cir|cum&s;tances where no woman has power enough to con|trol a man of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>"If it be true, then, (as true beyond all peradventure it is) that female influence is thus exten&s;ive; nothing, cer|tainly, can be of greater importance, than to give it a proper tendency, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a well-directed edu|cation. Far am I from recommending any attempts to render women learned, yet &s;urely it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be rai&s;ed above ignorance. Such a general tincture of the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;ciences, as may &s;erve to free the mind from vulgar prejudices, and give it a reli&s;h for the rational ex|erci&s;e of its powers, might very ju&s;tly enter into the plan of female erudition. That &s;ex might be taught to turn the cour&s;e of their reflections into a proper channel, with|out any danger of rendering them too elevated for the fem|inine duties of life. In a word, I WOULD HAVE THEM CONSIDERED AS DESIGNED BY PROVIDENCE FOR USE AS WELL AS SHEW, AND TRAINED UP NOT ONLY AS WOMEN, BUT AS RATIONAL CREATURES. <HI>Adieu.</HI>"</P>

<P>IT may be a&s;&s;erted to the honour of Marriage, that it has few adver&s;aries among Men either di&s;tingui&s;hed for their abilities, or eminent for their virtue. Tho&s;e who have a&s;&s;umed the province of attacking it, of over|turning the con&s;titution of the world, of encountering the authority of the wi&s;e&s;t legi&s;lators, from whom it has re|ceived the highe&s;t &s;anction of human wi&s;dom; and &s;ub|verting the maxims of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tates, in which it has been dignified with honours, and promoted with immunities; tho&s;e who have undertaken the ta&s;k of contending with rea&s;on and experience, with Earth and with Heaven, are men who &s;eem generally not &s;elected by nature for great attempts, or difficult undertakings. They are, for the mo&s;t part, &s;uch as owe not their determina|tions to their arguments, but their arguments to their de|terminations; di&s;putants heated, not with zeal for the right, but with the rage of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and impatience of re&s;traint. And perhaps to the &s;ober, the under&s;tand|ing, and the pious, it may be &s;ufficient to remark, that Marriage and Religion have the &s;ame enemies.</P>
<P>That an in&s;titution de&s;igned only for the promotion of happine&s;s, and for the relief of the di&s;appointments, anx|ieties, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which we are &s;ubject in our pre&s;ent &s;tate, does not always produce the effects, for which it was appointed; that it &s;ometimes conden&s;es the gloom, which it was intended to di&s;pel, and increa&s;es the weight, which was expected to be made lighter by it; mu&s;t, how|ever unwillingly, be yet acknowledged.</P>
<P>It is to be con&s;idered, to what cau&s;es effects &s;o unex|pected and unplea&s;ing, &s;o contrary to the end of the in&s;ti|tution, and &s;o unlikely to ari&s;e from it, are to be attribu|ted; it is nece&s;&s;ary to inquire, whether tho&s;e who are thus
<PB N="18" REF="031725_0017_0FEE1D9411EC41C0">
unhappy, are to impute their mi&s;ery to any other cau&s;e, than their own folly, and to the neglect of tho&s;e duties, which prudence and religion equally require.</P>
<P>That nothing but vice or folly ob&s;tructs the happine&s;s of a married life, may be made evident by examining,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Nature and End of Marriage.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Means by which that End is to be attained.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Nature and End of Marriage.</P>
<P>The vow of marriage may be con&s;idered as a vow of perpetual and indi&s;&s;oluble Friend&s;hip; Friend&s;hip which no change of fortune, nor any alteration of external cir|cum&s;tances can be allowed to interrupt or weaken. After the commencement of this &s;tate there remain no longer any &s;eparate intere&s;ts; the two individuals become united, and are therefore to enjoy the &s;ame felicity, and &s;uffer the &s;ame misfortunes; to have the &s;ame friends and the &s;ame enemies, the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s and the &s;ame di&s;appointments.</P>
<P>It has long been ob&s;erved, that friend&s;hip is to be con|fined to one, or that, to u&s;e the words of the axiom, <HI>He that hath friends, hath no friend.</HI> That ardour of kind|ne&s;s, that unbounded confidence, that un&s;u&s;pecting &s;ecurity, which friend&s;hip requires, cannot be extended beyond a &s;ingle object. A divided affection may be termed benev|olence, but can hardly ri&s;e to friend&s;hip; for the narrow limits of the human mind allow it not inten&s;ely to con|template more than one idea.</P>
<P>It is remarked, that <HI>Friend&s;hip among&s;t equals is the mo&s;t la&s;ting;</HI> and perhaps there are few cau&s;es to which more unhappy marriages are to be a&s;cribed, than a di&s;proportion between the original condition of the two per&s;ons. Dif|ference of condition makes difference of education; and difference of education produces differences of habits, &s;en|timents, and inclinations. Thence ari&s;e contrary views, and oppo&s;ite &s;chemes, of which the frequent, though not nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences, are debates, di&s;gu&s;t, alienation, and &s;ettled hatred.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="031725_0018_0FEE1D95997EA838">Strict friend&s;hip is <HI>to have the &s;ame de&s;ires and aver&s;ions.</HI> Whoever is to choo&s;e a friend is to con&s;ider fir&s;t the re|&s;emblance, or the di&s;&s;imilitude of tempers. How nece&s;|&s;ary this caution is to be urged as preparatory to mar|riage, the mi&s;ery of tho&s;e who neglect it &s;ufficiently evinces. To enumerate all the varieties of di&s;po&s;ition, to which it may on this occa&s;ion be convenient to attend, would be a tedious ta&s;k; but it is at lea&s;t proper to enforce on this head one precept, which was never yet broken without fatal con&s;equences, <HI>Let the Religion of the Man and Woman be the &s;ame.</HI> How can he be happy, who &s;ees the per&s;on mo&s;t dear to him in a &s;tate of dangerous error, and ignorant of tho&s;e &s;acred truths, which are nece&s;&s;ary to the approbation of GOD, and to future felic|ity? If they previou&s;ly &s;tipulate for the free enjoyment of their own opinion; the education of children will &s;oon make it nece&s;&s;ary to determine, which of the two opinions &s;hall be tran&s;mitted to their po&s;terity; and how can either con&s;ent to train up in error and delu&s;ion tho&s;e from whom they expect the highe&s;t &s;atisfactions, and the only comforts of declining life?</P>
<P>On account of this conformity of notions it is, that equality of condition is chiefly eligible; for as Friend&s;hip, &s;o Marriage either finds or makes an equality. No di&s;|advantage of birth or fortune ought to impede the exalta|tion of virtue and of wi&s;dom; for with marriage begins union, and union obliterates all di&s;tinctions. It may in|deed become the per&s;on who received the benefit, to re|member it, that gratitude may heighten affection; but the per&s;on who conferred it ought to forget it, becau&s;e, if it was de&s;erved, it cannot be mentioned without in|ju&s;tice, nor if unde&s;erved, without imprudence. All reproaches of this kind mu&s;t be either retractions of a good action, or proclamations of our own weakne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Friends,</HI> &s;ays the proverbial ob&s;ervation, <HI>have every thing in common.</HI> This is likewi&s;e implied in the marriage-covenant. Matrimony admits of no &s;eparate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, nor incommunicable intere&s;ts. This rule, like all others, has been often broken by low views and &s;ordid &s;tipula|tions;
<PB N="20" REF="031725_0019_0FEE1D9721D8A470">
but, like all other precepts, founded on rea&s;on and truth, it has received a new confirmation from almo&s;t every breach of it; and tho&s;e parents, who&s;e age had no better effect upon their under&s;tanding, than to fill them with avarice and &s;tratagem, have brought mi&s;ery and ruin on their children, by the means which they weakly imag|ined conducive to their happine&s;s.</P>
<P>There is yet another precept equally relating to Friend|&s;hip and to Marriage; a precept which, in either ca&s;e, can never be too &s;trongly inculcated, or too &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved; <HI>Contract friend&s;hip only with the good.</HI> Virtue is the fir&s;t quality to be con&s;idered in the choice of a friend, and yet more in a fixed and irrevocable choice. This maxim &s;urely requires no comment, nor any vindication; it is equally clear and certain, obvious to the &s;uperficial, and inconte&s;table by the mo&s;t accurate examiner. To dwell upon it is therefore &s;uperfluous; for, though often neglected, it never was denied. Every man will, without he&s;itation, confe&s;s, that it is ab&s;urd to tru&s;t a known de|ceiver, or voluntarily to depend for quiet and for happine&s;s upon in&s;olence, cruelty, and oppre&s;&s;ion. Thus Marriage appears to differ from Friend&s;hip chiefly in the degree of its efficacy, and the authority of its in&s;titution. It was appointed by GOD him&s;elf, as nece&s;&s;ary to happine&s;s, even in a &s;tate of innocence; and the relation produced by it, was declared more powerful than that of birth. <HI>Therefore &s;hall a man leave his father and his mother, and &s;hall cleave unto his Wife.</HI> But as notwith&s;tanding its conformity to human nature, it &s;ometimes fails to produce the effects in|tended, it is nece&s;&s;ary to inquire,</P>
<P>Secondly, By what Means the End of Marriage is to be attained.</P>
<P>As it appears by examining the natural &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, that the greate&s;t and the &s;malle&s;t bodies are inve&s;ted with the &s;ame properties, and moved by the &s;ame laws; &s;o a &s;urvey of the moral world will inform us, that greater or le&s;s &s;ocieties are to be made happy by the &s;ame means; and that however relations may be varied, or cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="21" REF="031725_0020_0FEE1DA005A3FC28">
changed, Virtue, and Virtue alone, is the pa|rent of felicity. We can only, in whatever &s;tate we may be placed, &s;ecure our&s;elves from di&s;quiet and from mi&s;ery, by a re&s;olute attention to truth and rea&s;on. Without this, it is in vain that a man choo&s;es a friend, or cleaves to a wife. If pa&s;&s;ion be &s;uffered to prevail over right, and the duties of our &s;tate are broken through, or neglected, for the &s;ake of gratifying our anger, our pride, or our revenge, the union of hearts will quickly be di&s;&s;olved, and kindne&s;s will give way to re&s;entment and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>The duties, by the practice of which a married life is to be made happy, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of friend&s;hip, but exalted to higher perfection. Love mu&s;t be more ar|dent, and confidence without limits. It is therefore ne|ce&s;&s;ary on each part to de&s;erve that confidence by the mo&s;t un&s;haken fidelity, and to pre&s;erve their love unextingui&s;hed by continual acts of tenderne&s;s; not only to dete&s;t all real, but &s;eeming offences; and to avoid &s;u&s;picion and guilt, with almo&s;t equal &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>But &s;ince the frailty of our nature is &s;uch, that we can|not hope from each other an unvaried rectitude of conduct, or an uninterrupted cour&s;e of wi&s;dom or virtue; as folly will &s;ometimes intrude upon an unguarded hour; and temptations, by frequent attacks, will &s;ometimes prevail; one of the chief acts of love is, readily to forgive errors, and overlook defects. Neglect is to be reclaimed by kind|ne&s;s, and perver&s;ene&s;s &s;oftened by compliance. Sudden &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion are patiently to be borne, and the calm moments of recollection &s;ilently expected. For if one of|fence be made a plea for another; if anger be to be op|po&s;ed with anger, and reproach retorted for reproach, either the conte&s;t mu&s;t be continued forever, or one mu&s;t at la&s;t be obliged by violence to do what might have been at fir&s;t done, not only more gracefully, but with more advantage.</P>
<P>Religion, which &s;ubdues every baneful appetite and pa&s;|&s;ion, and in&s;pires the mo&s;t &s;incere affection towards the friend of our bo&s;om, is then the ba&s;is of happine&s;s, and
<PB N="22" REF="031725_0021_0FED37F9B566DE30">
the operating power which makes every good in&s;titution valid and efficacious. And he who &s;hall attempt to attain happine&s;s by the means which GOD has ordained, &s;hall &s;urely find the highe&s;t degree of &s;atisfaction that our pre&s;|ent &s;tate allows; if, in his choice, he pays the fir&s;t regard to virtue, and regulates his conduct by the precepts of religion.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THOUGH the danger of di&s;appointment is always in proportion to the height of expectation, yet I now claim the attention of the ladies, and profe&s;s to teach an art by which all may obtain what has hitherto been deemed the prerogative of a few; an art by which their predominant pa&s;&s;ion may be gratified, and their conque&s;ts not only extended but &s;ecured; "the art of being PRETTY."</P>
<P>But though my &s;ubject may intere&s;t the ladies, it may, perhaps, offend tho&s;e profound morali&s;ts, who have long &s;ince determined, that BEAUTY ought rather to be de&s;|pi&s;ed than de&s;ired; that, like &s;trength, it is a mere natural excellence, the effect of cau&s;es wholly out of our power, and not intended either as the pledge of happine&s;s or the di&s;tinction of merit.</P>
<P>To the&s;e gentlemen I &s;hall remark, that beauty is among tho&s;e qualities, which no effort of human wit could ever bring into contempt; it is, therefore, to be wi&s;hed at lea&s;t, that beauty was in &s;ome degree dependent upon SENTIMENT and MANNERS, that &s;o high a privi|lege might not be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the unworthy, and that human rea&s;on might no longer &s;uffer the mortification of tho&s;e who are compelled to adore an idol, which differs from a &s;tone or a log only by the &s;kill of the artificer: and if they cannot them&s;elves behold beauty with indiffer|ence, they mu&s;t, &s;urely, approve an attempt to &s;hew that it merits their regard.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, principally con&s;ider that &s;pecies of beauty which is expre&s;&s;ed in the countenance; for this alone is peculiar to human beings, and is not le&s;s compli|cated than their nature. In the countenance there are but two requi&s;ites to perfect BEAUTY, which are wholly
<PB N="24" REF="031725_0023_0FEE1DAA2B3DDEB8">
produced by external cau&s;es, colour and proportion: and it will appear that even in common e&s;timation the&s;e are not the chief; but that though there may be beauty without them, yet there cannot be beauty without &s;omething more.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t features, ranged in the mo&s;t exact &s;ymmetry, and heightened by the mo&s;t blooming complexion, mu&s;t be animated before they can &s;trike; and when they are animated, will generally excite the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions which they expre&s;s. If they are fixed in the dead calm of in|&s;en&s;ibility, they will be examined without emotion; and if they do not expre&s;s kindne&s;s, they will be beheld with|out love. Looks of contempt, di&s;dain, or malevolence, will be reflected, as from a mirror, by every countenance on which they are turned; and if a wanton a&s;pect excites de&s;ire, it is but like that of a &s;avage for his prey, which cannot be gratified without the de&s;truction of its object.</P>
<P>Among particular graces the dimple has always been allowed the pre-eminence, and the rea&s;on is evident; dim|ples are produced by a &s;mile, and a &s;mile is an expre&s;&s;ion of complacency: &s;o the contraction of the brows into a frown, as it is an indication of a contrary temper, has always been deemed a capital defect.</P>
<P>The lover is generally at a lo&s;s to define the beauty, by which his pa&s;&s;ion was &s;uddenly and irre&s;i&s;tibly determined to a particular object; but this could never happen, if it depended upon any known rule of proportion, upon the &s;hape or the di&s;po&s;ition of features, or the colour of the &s;kin: he tells you that it is &s;omething which he can|not fully expre&s;s, &s;omething not fixed in any feature but diffu&s;ed over all; he calls it a &s;weetne&s;s, a &s;oftne&s;s, a placid &s;en&s;ibility, or gives it &s;ome other appellation which connects beauty with SENTIMENT, and expre&s;&s;es a charm which is not peculiar to any &s;et of features, but is per|haps po&s;&s;ible to all.</P>
<P>This beauty, however, does not always con&s;i&s;t in &s;miles, but varies as expre&s;&s;ions of meekne&s;s and kindne&s;s vary with their objects: it is extremely forcible in the &s;ilent complaint of patient &s;ufferance, the tender &s;olicitude of friend&s;hip, and the glow of filial obedience; and in tears, whether of joy, of pity, or of grief, it is almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="031725_0024_0FEE1DABB462D3E0">This is the charm which captivates without the aid of nature, and without which her utmo&s;t bounty is ineffec|tual. But it cannot be a&s;&s;umed as a ma&s;k to conceal in|&s;en&s;ibility or malevolence; it mu&s;t be the genuine effect of corre&s;ponding &s;entiments, or it will impre&s;s upon the countenance a new and more di&s;gu&s;ting deformity, AF|FECTATION: it will produce the grin, the &s;imper, the &s;tare, the langui&s;h, the pout, and innumerable other gri|maces, that render folly ridiculous, and change pity to contempt. By &s;ome, indeed, this &s;pecies of hypocri&s;y has been practi&s;ed with &s;uch &s;kill as to deceive &s;uperficial ob&s;ervers, though it can deceive even the&s;e but for a mo|ment. Looks which do not corre&s;pond with the heart, cannot be a&s;&s;umed without labour, nor continued without pain; the motive to relinqui&s;h them, mu&s;t, therefore, &s;oon preponderate, and the a&s;pect and apparel of the vi&s;it will be laid by together; the &s;miles and the langui&s;hments of art will vani&s;h; and the fiercene&s;s of rage, or the gloom of di&s;content, will either ob&s;cure or de&s;troy all the ele|gance of &s;ymmetry and complexion.</P>
<P>The artificial a&s;pect is, indeed, as wretched a &s;ub&s;titute for the expre&s;&s;ion of &s;entiment, as the &s;mear of paint for the blu&s;hes of health: it is not only equally tran&s;ient, and equally liable to detection; but as paint leaves the countenance yet more withered and gha&s;tly, the pa&s;&s;ions bur&s;t out with more violence after re&s;traint, the features be|come more di&s;torted, and excite more determined aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Beauty, therefore, depends principally upon the mind, and con&s;equently may be influenced by education. It has been remarked, that the predominant pa&s;&s;ion may gen|erally be di&s;covered in the countenance; becau&s;e the mu&s;cles by which it is expre&s;&s;ed, being almo&s;t perpetually contracted, lo&s;e their tone, and never totally relax; &s;o that the expre&s;&s;ion remains, when the pa&s;&s;ion is &s;u&s;pended: thus an angry, a di&s;dainful, a &s;ubtil, or a &s;u&s;picious tem|per, is di&s;played in characters that are almo&s;t univer&s;ally under&s;tood. It is equally true of the plea&s;ing and the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, that they leave their &s;ignatures upon the counte|nance when they cea&s;e to act: the prevalence of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, therefore, produces a mechanical effect upon the
<PB N="26" REF="031725_0025_0FEE1DAD40050910">
a&s;pect, and gives a turn and ca&s;t to the features, which make a more favourable and forcible impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of others, than any charm produced by mere external cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Neither does the beauty which depends upon tem|per and &s;entiment equally endanger the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: "It is," to u&s;e an ea&s;tern metaphor, "like the towers of a city, not only an ornament but a defence:" if it excites de&s;ire, it at once controls and refines it; it repre&s;&s;es with awe, it &s;oftens with delicacy, and it wins to imitation. The love of rea&s;on and of virtue is mingled with the love of beauty; becau&s;e this beauty is little more than the emanation of intellectual excellence, which is not an ob|ject of corporeal appetite. As it excites a purer pa&s;&s;ion, it al&s;o more forcibly engages to fidelity: every man finds him&s;elf more powerfully re&s;trained from giving pain to goodne&s;s, than to beauty; and every look of a counte|nance in which they are blended, in which beauty is the expre&s;&s;ion of goodne&s;s, is a &s;ilent reproach of the fir&s;t irregular wi&s;h; and the purpo&s;e immediately appears to be di&s;ingenuous and cruel, by which the tender hope of ineffable affection would be di&s;appointed, the placid con|fidence of un&s;u&s;pecting &s;implicity abu&s;ed, and the peace even of virtue endangered by the mo&s;t &s;ordid infidelity, and the breach of the &s;tronge&s;t obligations.</P>
<P>But the hope of the hypocrite mu&s;t peri&s;h. When the factitious beauty has laid by her &s;miles, when the lu&s;tre of her eyes and the bloom of her cheeks have lo&s;t their influence with their novelty; what remains but a tyrant dive&s;ted of power, who will never be &s;een without a mix|ture of indignation and di&s;dain? The only de&s;ire which this object could gratify, will be transferred to another, not only without reluctance but with triumph. As re|&s;entment will &s;ucceed to di&s;appointment, a de&s;ire to mor|tify will &s;ucceed to a de&s;ire to plea&s;e; and the hu&s;band may be urged to &s;olicit a mi&s;tre&s;s, merely by a remem|brance of the beauty of his wife, which la&s;ted only till &s;he was known.</P>
<P>Let it, therefore, be remembered, that none can be di&s;ciples of the GRACES, but in the &s;chool of VIRTUE; and that tho&s;e who wi&s;h to be LOVELY, mu&s;t learn early to be GOOD.</P>

<P>THOUGH I devote this lucubration to the ladies, yet there are &s;ome parts of it which I hope will not be wholly u&s;ele&s;s to the gentlemen&punc; and, perhaps, both may expect to be addre&s;&s;ed upon a &s;ubject, which to both is of equal importance.</P>
<P>It has been univer&s;ally allowed, and with great rea&s;on, that between per&s;ons who marry there &s;hould be &s;ome degree of equality, with re&s;pect to age and condition. Tho&s;e who violate a known truth, de&s;erve the infelicity they incur: I &s;hall, therefore, only labour to pre&s;erve innocence by detecting error.</P>
<P>With &s;ome ladies it is a maxim, that "the be&s;t hu&s;|band is a reformed RAKE;" a maxim which they have probably derived from comedies and novels, in which &s;uch a hu&s;band is commonly the reward of female merit. But the belief of this maxim is an inconte&s;table proof, that with the true character of a RAKE the ladies are wholly unacquainted. "They have," indeed, "heard of a wild young gentleman, who would rake about the town, and take up his lodging at a bagnio; who had told many a girl a pretty &s;tory, that was fool enough to be|lieve him; and had a right to many a child that did not call him father: but that in &s;ome of the&s;e frolics he thought no harm, and for others he had &s;ufficiently &s;uffer|ed." But let the ADVENTURER be believed, the&s;e are words of dreadful import, and &s;hould always be thus under&s;tood&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="031725_0027_0FEE1DB7A9415338">"To rake about town and lodge at a bagnio, is to a&s;&s;ociate with the vile&s;t and mo&s;t abandoned of human beings; it is to become familiar with bla&s;phemy and lewdne&s;s, and frequently to &s;port with the mo&s;t deplora|ble mi&s;ery: to tell pretty &s;tories to credulous girls, is to deceive the &s;implicity of innocence by cunning and fal&s;e|hood: to be the father of a namele&s;s progeny, is to de|&s;ert tho&s;e, who&s;e tears only can implore the protection, to which of all others they have the &s;tronge&s;t and the tender|e&s;t claim; it is more than to be a man without affection, it is to be a brute without in&s;tinct. To think no harm in &s;ome of the&s;e frolics, is to have worn out all &s;en&s;ibility of the difference between right and wrong; and to have &s;uf|fered for others, is to have a body contaminated with di&s;|ea&s;es, which in &s;ome degree are certainly tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity."</P>
<P>It is to be hoped, that the mere exhibition of this picture, will be &s;ufficient to deter the ladies from preclud|ing happine&s;s by marrying the original; and from di&s;|couraging virtue, by making vice nece&s;&s;ary to the charac|ter which they prefer.</P>
<P>But they frequently act upon another principle, which, though not equally fatal and ab&s;urd, may yet produce great infelicity.</P>
<P>When the RAKE is excluded, it will be generally &s;up|po&s;ed, that &s;uperior intellectual abilities ought always to determine the choice. "A man of fine &s;en&s;e" is, in|deed, a character of great dignity; and the ladies have always been advi&s;ed to prefer this to every other, as it includes a capacity to be&s;tow "that refined, exalted, and permanent felicity, which alone is worthy of a rational being." But I think it probable, that this advice, how|ever &s;pecious, has been often given for no other rea&s;on, than becau&s;e to give it flattered the vanity of the writer, who fondly believed he was drawing his own character and exciting the envy and admiration of his readers. This advice, however, the ladies univer&s;ally affect to ap|prove, and probably for a &s;imilar rea&s;on; &s;ince every one imagines, that to hold intellectual excellence in high e&s;ti|mation, is to demon&s;trate that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="031725_0028_0FEE1DB931517D00">As he that would per&s;uade, &s;hould be &s;crupulou&s;ly careful not to offend, I will not in&s;inuate that there are any ladies, by whom the peculiar beauties of an exalted under&s;tanding cannot be di&s;cerned; and who have not, therefore, a capacity for half the plea&s;ure which it can be&s;tow. And yet I think there is another excellence which is much more e&s;&s;ential to conjugal felicity, GOOD NATURE.</P>
<P>I know that GOOD NATURE has, like SOCRATES, been ridiculed in the habit of FOLLY; and that FOLLY has been dignified by the name of GOOD NATURE. But by GOOD NATURE, I do not mean that flexible imbecility of mind which complies with every reque&s;t, and inclines a man at once to accompany an acquaintance to a brothel at the expen&s;e of his health, and to keep an equipage for a wife at the expen&s;e of his e&s;tate. Per&s;ons of this di&s;po&s;ition have &s;eldom more benevolence than fortitude, and frequently perpetrate deliberate cruelty.</P>
<P>In true GOOD NATURE, there is neither the acrimony of &s;pleen, nor the &s;ullenne&s;s of malice; it is neither clam|orous nor fretful, neither ea&s;y to be offended, nor impa|tient to revenge; it is a tender &s;en&s;ibility, a participation of the pains and plea&s;ures of others; and is, therefore, a forcible and con&s;tant motive, to communicate happine&s;s and alleviate mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>As human nature is, from whatever cau&s;e, in a &s;tate of great imperfection, it is &s;urely to be de&s;ired, that a per&s;on whom it is mo&s;t our intere&s;t to plea&s;e, &s;hould not &s;ee more of this imperfection than we do our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I &s;hall perhaps be told, that "a man of &s;en&s;e can never u&s;e a woman ill." The latter part of this propo|&s;ition is a phra&s;e of very exten&s;ive and various &s;ignifica|tion: whether a man of &s;en&s;e "can u&s;e a woman ill," I will not inquire; but I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, that he may make her extremely wretched.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of keen penetration and great delicacy of &s;en|timent, as they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be more frequently of|fended than others, &s;o, as a puni&s;hment for the offence, they can inflict more exqui&s;ite pain, becau&s;e they can wound with more poignant reproach: and by him, whom
<PB N="30" REF="031725_0029_0FEE1DBAB8F442E0">
GOOD NATURE does not re&s;train from retaliating the pain that he feels, the offence, whether voluntary or not, will always be thus puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>If this puni&s;hment is &s;uffered with &s;ilence, confu&s;ion, and tears, it is po&s;&s;ible that the tyrant may relent; but this, like the remor&s;e of a murderer, is too late: the dread of incurring the &s;ame angui&s;h by a like fault, will &s;ub&s;ti|tute for the &s;mile of cheerfulne&s;s, that &s;un&s;hine of beauty, the glooms of doubt, &s;olicitude, and anxiety: the offence will notwith&s;tanding be again repeated; the puni&s;hment, the di&s;tre&s;s, and the remor&s;e, will again return; becau&s;e error is involuntary, and anger is not re&s;trained. If the reproach is retorted, and, whether it was de&s;erved, be|comes the &s;ubject of debate, the con&s;equences are yet more dreadful: after a vain attempt to &s;hew an incon|gruity, which can no more be perceived than &s;ounds by the deaf, the hu&s;band will be in&s;ulted for cau&s;ele&s;s and capricious di&s;plea&s;ure, and the wife for folly, perver&s;ene&s;s, and ob&s;tinacy. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, what will become of "the refined, the exalted, and the permanent felicity, which alone is worthy of rea&s;onable beings, and which elevated genius only can be&s;tow?"</P>
<P>That this conduct is by a man of &s;en&s;e known to be wrong, I am content to allow: but it mu&s;t al&s;o be granted, that the di&s;cernment of wrong is not always a propen&s;ity to right; and that if pain was never inflicted, but when it was known to produce &s;alutary effects, mankind would be much more happy than they are.</P>
<P>GOOD NATURE, therefore, if intellectual excellence cannot atone for the want of it, mu&s;t be admitted as the highe&s;t per&s;onal merit. If, without it, wi&s;dom is not kind; without it, folly mu&s;t be brutal. Let it, therefore, be once more repeated, "The quality mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to conjugal felicity, is GOOD NATURE." And &s;urely, whatever accidental difference there may happen to be in the conceptions or judgment of a hu&s;band and wife, if neither can give pain or plea&s;ure without feeling it them|&s;elves, it is ea&s;y to perceive, which &s;en&s;ation they will concur to produce.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="031725_0030_0FEE1DBC449D9078">It may now be expected, that I &s;hould give &s;ome gen|eral rules, by which the ladies may di&s;cover the di&s;po&s;i|tion of tho&s;e, by whom they are addre&s;&s;ed: but it is extremely difficult, to detect malevolence amid&s;t the a&s;&s;i|duities of court&s;hip, and to di&s;tingui&s;h the man under that almo&s;t in&s;crutable di&s;gui&s;e the lover. GOOD NATURE, however, is not indicated by the ful&s;ome fawning of a perpetual grin, the loud laughter which almo&s;t antici|pates the je&s;t, or the con&s;tant echo of every &s;entiment; neither is it &s;afe to tru&s;t the appearance of profu&s;e liberal|ity, or bu&s;y officiou&s;ne&s;s. Let it rather be remarked, how the lover is affected by incidents, in which the lady is not concerned; what is his behaviour to his immedi|ate dependants, and whether they approach him with a &s;lavi&s;h timidity, or with the cheerful reverence of volun|tary &s;ervitude. Is he ever merry at the expen&s;e of an|other; or does he ever attempt thus to excite mirth in his mi&s;tre&s;s? Does he mention the ab&s;ent with candour, and behave to tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent with a manly com|placency? By a diligent attendance to the&s;e circum|&s;tances, perhaps a probable judgment may be formed of his character.</P>
<P>To conclude with a general remark; GOOD NATURE is not of le&s;s importance to our&s;elves, than to others. The moro&s;e and petulant fir&s;t feel the angui&s;h that they give: reproach, revilings, and invective, are but the over|flowings of their own infelicity, and are con&s;tantly again forced back upon their &s;ource. Sweetne&s;s of temper is not, indeed, an acquired but a natural excellence; and therefore, to recommend it to tho&s;e who have it not, may be deemed rather an in&s;ult than advice. But let that which in happier natures is in&s;tinct, in the&s;e be rea&s;on; let them pur&s;ue the &s;ame conduct, impelled by a nobler motive. As the &s;ourne&s;s of the crab enhances the value of the graft, &s;o that which on its parent plant is GOOD NATURE, will on a le&s;s kindly &s;tock be improved into VIRTUE. No action by which others receive plea&s;ure or pain, is indifferent: the &s;acred rule, "Do that to others which ye would that others &s;hould do to you," extends to every deed; and "every word &s;hall be brought into judgment."</P>

<P>THE ladies, to whom I lately addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome thoughts upon the choice of a hu&s;band, I &s;hall now con&s;ider as married: and as I am very far from think|ing, that they may now &s;it down in negligent &s;ecurity, and remit at once their a&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uity and circum&s;pection, I &s;hall warn them of &s;ome opinions of which this conduct is the con&s;equence, detect &s;ome errors by which the gen|eral intention of good nature may be di&s;appointed, and endeavour to put them upon their guard again&s;t &s;ome pro|pen&s;ities by which it may be overborne.</P>
<P>It is now nece&s;&s;ary to remind them, that the pa&s;&s;ion which is &s;uppo&s;ed to animate the lover, the pa&s;&s;ion which is repre&s;ented by flames and darts, which &s;wells the bo&s;om with perpetual rapture, and neither changes its object nor
<PB N="33" REF="031725_0032_0FEE1DC886DB0910">
lo&s;es its ardour, exi&s;ts only in poetry and romance. The real pa&s;&s;ion which wit and folly have thus concurred to di&s;gui&s;e, is &s;ubject to di&s;gu&s;t and &s;atiety, is excited by novelty, and frequently extingui&s;hed by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But there is an e&s;teem which is meliorated by love, and a love that is elevated by e&s;teem; a kind of mixed affection peculiar to mankind, as beings compounded of in&s;tinct and rea&s;on, or, in other words, of body and mind. This is that &s;pecies of affection, upon which the &s;upreme or peculiar happine&s;s of marriage depends, and which can &s;carce be pre&s;erved without a con&s;tant attention and per|petual efforts.</P>
<P>As love without e&s;teem, is volatile and capricious; e&s;teem without love, is languid and cold. I am afraid that many men, who&s;e wives have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their e&s;teem, have yet lavi&s;hed their fortune and their fondne&s;s upon a mi&s;tre&s;s; and that the love of others, however ardent, has been quickly alienated, becau&s;e it was not dignified and &s;upported by e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Though good nature does indeed participate the pains and the plea&s;ures of others, and may, therefore, be con|&s;idered as a con&s;tant and forcible motive to communicate happine&s;s and alleviate mi&s;ery; yet it is at be&s;t but the imperfect excellence of imperfect beings, who&s;e immedi|ate gratifications are often &s;elfi&s;h, and &s;uch as folly or vice render incompatible with the true happine&s;s of the indi|vidual, and of each other.</P>
<P>As there is not, perhaps, upon earth any couple, who&s;e natural di&s;po&s;itions and reli&s;h of life are &s;o perfectly &s;im|ilar, as that their wills con&s;tantly coincide; &s;o it mu&s;t &s;ometimes happen, that the immediate plea&s;ure of indulg|ing oppo&s;ite inclinations, will be greater than a participa|tion of that plea&s;ure, which would ari&s;e to the other, if this indulgence &s;hould be forborne: but as to forbear this indulgence can never fail to conciliate e&s;teem, it &s;hould always be con&s;idered as a means of happine&s;s, and rather as an advantage than a lo&s;s; e&s;pecially if it be true, that the indulgence it&s;elf, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, never gives the plea&s;ure that it promi&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="031725_0033_0FEE1DCA0FC50878">Mrs. CHARLOTTE SPRIGHTLY, the wife of a young merchant, was dre&s;&s;ing for an a&s;&s;embly a few nights ago, when her hu&s;band came in. "My dear CHARLOTTE," &s;ays he, "I am &s;orry that you are going out to-night&punc; for my cou&s;in George is ju&s;t arrived from the Ea&s;t-Indies: I have invited him to &s;up; and as he has never &s;een you, I promi&s;ed him your company." "Nay, dear HARRY," replied the lady, "do not a&s;k me to &s;tay at home to|night; you know I am fond of dancing; and now my fancy is &s;et upon going, I am &s;ure you will not di&s;appoint me." Mr. SPRIGHTLY, who was truly good-natured, would not urge her to &s;tay; for to &s;tay with apparent reluctance, would not have gratified his wi&s;h. She per|ceived that he was &s;ecretly di&s;plea&s;ed; however, away &s;he went. But as &s;he had not le&s;s good-nature than her hu&s;band, &s;he &s;uffered &s;o much pain by reflecting on the pain &s;he had given him, that &s;he often wi&s;hed her&s;elf at home. Thus &s;he offended the delicacy of his affection, by preferring a dance to the quiet of his mind; and for|feited part of the e&s;teem, which was due to that very good-nature by which &s;he lo&s;t the enjoyment of the night.</P>
<P>In this in&s;tance, the pain inflicted upon the hu&s;band was accidental to the private gratification propo&s;ed by the wife. But there is a pa&s;&s;ion very different both from malice and rage, to the gratification of which, the pain of another is &s;ometimes e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary. This pa&s;&s;ion, which though its effects are often directly oppo&s;ite to good-nature, is yet perhaps predominant in every brea&s;t and indulged at whatever ri&s;que, is VANITY.</P>
<P>To a gratification of vanity, at the expen&s;e of recipro|cal e&s;teem, the wife is certainly under much &s;tronger temptation than the hu&s;band: and I warn the ladies again&s;t it, not only with more zeal, but with greater hope of &s;ucce&s;s; becau&s;e tho&s;e only who have &s;uperior natural abilities, or have received uncommon advantages from ed|ucation, have it in their power.</P>
<P>Succe&s;sfully to rally a wife, confers no honour upon a hu&s;band; the attempt is regarded rather as an in&s;ult than a conte&s;t; it is exulting in a ma&s;culine &s;trength to whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="35" REF="031725_0034_0FEE1DCB98378238">
&s;he makes no preten&s;ions, and brandi&s;hing weapons which &s;he is not &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;kill to wield.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;ons, to confute or to ridicule a hu&s;|band with an apparent &s;uperiority of knowledge or of wit, affords all the parade of triumph to a wife; it is to be &s;trong where weakne&s;s is no reproach, and to conquer when it would not have been di&s;honourable to fly. But the&s;e circum&s;tances, which increa&s;e the force of the temptation, will be found to afford proportionate motives to re&s;i&s;t it; whatever adds to the glory of the victor, adds equally to the di&s;honour of the vanqui&s;hed; and that which can exalt a wife only by degrading a hu&s;band, will appear upon the whole not to be worth the acqui&s;ition, even though it could be made without changing fondne&s;s to re&s;entment, or provoking jealou&s;y by an implication of contempt. If the ladies do not perceive the force of this argument, I earne&s;tly reque&s;t that they would for once tru&s;t implicitly to my judgment; a reque&s;t which, how|ever extraordinary, is not unrea&s;onable; becau&s;e in this in&s;tance the very vanity which hides truth from them, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily di&s;cover it to me.</P>
<P>But if good-nature is &s;ufficiently vigorous to &s;ecur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the e&s;teem of rea&s;on, it may yet be too negligent to gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ify the delicacy of love: it mu&s;t, therefore, not only be &s;teady, but watchful and a&s;&s;iduous; beauty mu&s;t &s;uffer no diminution by inelegance, but every charm mu&s;t contrib|ute to keep the heart which it contributed to win; what|ever would have been concealed as a defect from the lover, mu&s;t with yet greater diligence be concealed from the hu&s;band. The mo&s;t intimate and tender familiarity, cannot &s;urely be &s;uppo&s;ed to exclude decorum; and there is a delicacy in every mind which is di&s;gu&s;ted at the breach of it, though every mind is not &s;ufficiently atten|tive to avoid giving an offence which it has often received.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this paper, as I did my la&s;t on the &s;ame &s;ubject, with a general remark. As they who po&s;|&s;e&s;s le&s;s than they expected cannot be happy; to expa|tiate in chimerical pro&s;pects of felicity is to in&s;ure the angui&s;h of di&s;appointment, and to lo&s;e the power of enjoy|ing
<PB N="36" REF="031725_0035_0FEE1DCD207A0A88">
whatever may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Let not youth, therefore, imagine, that with all the advantages of nature and edu|cation, marriage will be a con&s;tant reciprocation of delight, over which externals will have little influence, and which time will rather change than de&s;troy. There is no per|petual &s;ource of delight but HOPE: &s;o imperfect is the utmo&s;t temporal happine&s;s, that to po&s;&s;e&s;s it all, is to lo&s;e it. We enjoy that which is before us; but when nothing more is po&s;&s;ible, all that is attained is in&s;ipid. Such is the condition of this life: but let us not, therefore, think it of no value; for to be placed in this life, is to be a can|didate for a BETTER.</P>

<P>ALMOST every man is, or has been, or at lea&s;t thinks that he is or has been, a Lover. I have lately taken a &s;urvey of the numerous tribe of <HI>Enamoratos;</HI> and, after having ob&s;erved the various &s;hapes they wear, think I may &s;afely pronounce, that though all profe&s;s to have been in love, there are very few, who are really ca|pable of it.</P>
<P>It is a maxim of Rochefoucault, that 'many men would never have been in love, if they had never heard of love.' The ju&s;tice of this remark is equal to its &s;hrewd|ne&s;s. The ridiculous prate of a family has frequently great influence on young minds, who learn to love, as they do every thing el&s;e, by imitation. Young creatures, almo&s;t mere children, have been con&s;umed with this &s;econd-hand flame.</P>
<P>That va&s;t heap of volumes, filled with love, and &s;uffi|cient in number to make a library, are great inflamers, and &s;eldom fail to produce that kind of pa&s;&s;ion de&s;cribed by Rochefoucault. The young &s;tudent reads of the emotions of love, till he imagines, that he feels them throbbing and fluttering in his little brea&s;t; as valetudinarians &s;tudy the hi&s;tory of a di&s;ea&s;e, till they fancy them&s;elves affected with every &s;ymptom of it. For this rea&s;on I am always &s;orry to &s;ee any of this tra&s;h in the hands of young people; and I am obliged to con&s;ider many romances and novels as no better than bawds, or arrant pimps.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="031725_0037_0FEE1DD78EB5F208">Platoni&s;m, which dotes on the mind alone of its mi&s;|tre&s;s, and would fain &s;ee her naked &s;oul dive&s;ted of its material incumbrances, is in the&s;e days very &s;carce; and there is another cla&s;s, infinitely more numerous, whom we may ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;h by the title of Epicureans. The principles of this &s;ect are diametrically oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of the Platonics. They think no more of the &s;oul of their mi&s;tre&s;s than a Mu&s;&s;ulman, but are in raptures with her per&s;on. A lover of this &s;ort is in perpetual ec&s;tacies: his pa&s;&s;ion is &s;o violent, that he even &s;corches you with his flame; and he runs over the perfections of his mi&s;tre&s;s in the &s;ame &s;tyle that a jockey prai&s;es his hor&s;e: 'Such limbs! &s;uch eyes! &s;uch a neck and brea&s;t! &s;uch&mdash;oh, &s;he's a rare piece!' Their ideas go no farther than mere external accompli&s;hments; and as their wounds may be &s;aid to be only &s;kin-deep, we cannot allow their brea&s;ts to be &s;mitten with love, though perhaps they may rankle with a much gro&s;&s;er pa&s;&s;ion. Yet it mu&s;t be owned, that noth|ing is more common, than for gentlemen of this ca&s;t to be involved in what is called a love-match: but then it is owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e with the marriage of Sir John Brute, who &s;ays&mdash;'I married my wife becau&s;e I wanted to lie with her, and &s;he would not let me.'</P>
<P>Other gentlemen, of a gay di&s;po&s;ition and warm con|&s;titution, who go in the catalogue for Lovers, are adorers of almo&s;t every woman they &s;ee. The flame of love is as ea&s;ily kindled in them, as the &s;parks are &s;truck out of a flint; and it al&s;o expires as &s;oon. A lover of this &s;ort dances one day with a lady at a ball, and lo&s;es his heart to her in a minuet; the next, another carries it off in the Mall; and the next day perhaps he goes out of town, and lodges it in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the country beauties &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, till at la&s;t he brings it back to town with him, and pre&s;ents it to the fir&s;t woman he meets. This cla&s;s is very numerous; but ought by no means to hold a place among the tribe of true Lovers, &s;ince a gentleman, who is thus in love with every body, may fairly be &s;aid not to be in love at all.</P>
<P>Love is univer&s;ally allowed to be whim&s;ical; and, if whim be the e&s;&s;ence of love, none can be accounted truer
<PB N="39" REF="031725_0038_0FEE1DD9172E3828">
Lovers than tho&s;e who admire their mi&s;tre&s;s for &s;ome particular charm, which enchains them, though it would &s;ingly never captivate any body el&s;e. Some gentlemen have been won by a pair of fine arms; others have been held fa&s;t by an even white &s;et of teeth; and I know a very good &s;cholar, who was en&s;nared by a &s;et of golden tre&s;&s;es, becau&s;e it was the ta&s;te of the ancients, and the true cla&s;&s;ical hair. Tho&s;e ladies, who&s;e lovers are &s;uch piece-meal admirers, are in perpetual danger of lo&s;ing them. A ra&s;h, or a pimple may abate their affection. All tho&s;e, the object of who&s;e adoration is merely a pretty face, or a fine per&s;on, are in the power of the like accidents; and the &s;mall pox has occa&s;ioned many a poor lady the lo&s;s of her beauty and her lover at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>But, after all the&s;e &s;purious <HI>Enamoratos,</HI> there are &s;ome few, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion is &s;incere and well founded. True genuine Love is always built upon e&s;teem: not that I would mean, that a man can rea&s;on and argue him&s;elf into love; but that a con&s;tant intercour&s;e with an amia|ble woman will lead him into a contemplation of her ex|cellent qualities, which will in&s;en&s;ibly win his heart, before he is him&s;elf aware of it, and beget tho&s;e hopes and fears, which are the natural attendants on a true pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Love has been de&s;cribed ten thou&s;and times: but that I may be &s;ure that the little picture I would draw of it is taken from nature, I will conclude this paper with the &s;tory of hone&s;t Will Ea&s;y and his amiable Wife.</P>
<P>Will Ea&s;y and Mi&s;s &mdash; became very early ac|quainted; and, from being familiarly intimate with the whole family, Will might almo&s;t be &s;aid to live there. Will and the lady were both univer&s;ally allowed to have &s;en&s;e, and their frequent conver&s;ations together gave them undoubted proofs of the goodne&s;s of each other's di&s;po&s;i|tion. They delighted in the company, and admired the perfections of each other, and gave a thou&s;and little indi|cations of a growing pa&s;&s;ion, not unob&s;erved by others, even whil&s;t it was yet unknown and un&s;u&s;pected by them|&s;elves. However, after &s;ome time, Will, by mutual agreement, demanded the lady of her father in marriage.
<PB N="40" REF="031725_0039_0FEE1DDAA06DB648">
But, alas! 'the cour&s;e of true love never yet run &s;mooth: the ill-judged ambition of a parent induced the father, out of mere love to his daughter, to refu&s;e her hand to the only man in the world with whom &s;he could live happily, becau&s;e he imagined, that he might, as the phra&s;e is, do <HI>better</HI> for her. But love, grounded on ju&s;t principles, is not ea&s;ily &s;haken; and, as it appeared that their mutual pa&s;&s;ion had taken too deep root ever to be extirpated, the father at la&s;t, reluctantly, half con&s;ented to their union. They enjoy a genteel competency; and Will, by his in|tegrity and abilities, is an honour to a learned profe&s;&s;ion, and a ble&s;&s;ing to his wife; who&s;e greate&s;t prai&s;e is, that her virtues de&s;erve &s;uch a hu&s;band. She is plea&s;ed with having left 'dre&s;s to dutche&s;&s;es;' he con&s;iders her happi|ne&s;s as his main intere&s;t; and their example every day gives fre&s;h conviction to the father, that where two per|&s;ons of &s;trong &s;en&s;e and good hearts conceive a reciprocal affection for each other, their pa&s;&s;ion is genuine and la&s;ting, and their union is perhaps the true&s;t &s;tate of happine&s;s under the &s;un.</P>

<P>THOUGH I &s;hall not as yet vouch&s;afe to let the reader &s;o far into my &s;ecrets, as to inform him, whether I am married or &s;ingle, it may not be ami&s;s to acquaint him, that, &s;uppo&s;ing I &s;till remain a bachelor, it has not been the fault of my friends or relations. On the contrary, as &s;oon as I was what they call &s;ettled in the world, they were &s;o a&s;&s;iduous in looking out a wife for me, that nothing was required on my part but immedi|ately to fall in love with the lady they had pitched upon; and could I have complied with their &s;everal choices, I &s;hould have been married at the &s;ame time to a tall and a &s;hort, a plump and a &s;lender, a young and an old woman; one with a great deal of money, and another with none at all: each of whom was &s;everally recommended by them as the propere&s;t per&s;on in the world for me.</P>
<P>I know not how it happens, but it is notorious, that mo&s;t people take a plea&s;ure in making matches; either thinking matrimony to be a &s;tate of bli&s;s, into which they would charitably call all their friends and acquaintances; or perhaps &s;truggling in the toils, they are de&s;irous of drawing others into the net that en&s;nared them.

<P>As we cann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t in&s;ure happine&s;s to our friends, at the &s;ame time that we help them to hu&s;bands and wives, one would imagine, that few would care to run the hazard of be&s;towing mi&s;ery, where they meant a kindne&s;s. I know

a good-natured lady, who has officiou&s;ly brought upon her|&s;elf the ill-will and the cur&s;es of many of her deare&s;t and mo&s;t intimate friends on that very account. She has a &s;i&s;ter, for whom &s;he has provided a mo&s;t excellent hu&s;|band, who has &s;hewn his affection for her by &s;pending her whole fortune upon his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es: another near re|lation, having by her means, &s;natched up a rich widow, the bridegroom was arre&s;ted for her debts within a week after marriage: and it co&s;t her a whole twelvemonth to bring two doting lovers of her acquaintance together, who parted beds before the honey-moon was expired.</P>
<P>But if our friends will thus conde&s;cend to be match|makers from a &s;pirit of benevolence, and for our own ad|vantage only; there are others, who have taken up the profe&s;&s;ion from le&s;s di&s;intere&s;ted motives; who bring beauty and fortune to market, and traffic in all the accom|pli&s;hments that can make the married &s;tate happy. I have known many droll accidents happen from the mi&s;takes of the&s;e mercenary per&s;ons; and remember one in particular, which I &s;hall here &s;et down for the entertainment of my read<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>A careful old gentleman came to town in order to marry his &s;on, and was recommended by one of the&s;e couplers to a twenty thou&s;and pounder. He accordingly put on his be&s;t wig, be&s;t beaver, and gold-buttoned coat, and went to pay his re&s;pects to the lady's mother. He told her, that he had not the plea&s;ure of being known to her; but as his &s;on's quiet depended upon it, he had taken the liberty of waiting on her: in &s;hort, he immediately broke the matter to her, and informed her, that his boy had &s;een her daughter at church, and was violently in love with her; concluding, that he would do very hand|&s;omely for the lad, and would make it worth her while to have him. The old lady thanked him for the honour he intended her family; but &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, to be &s;ure, as he appeared to be a prudent and &s;en&s;ible gentleman, he would expect a fortune an&s;werable. 'Say nothing of that, &s;ay nothing of that,' interrupted the Don: 'I have heard&mdash;but if it was le&s;s, it &s;hould not break any &s;quares between us.'&mdash;'Pray, Sir, how much does the world &s;ay?'
<PB N="43" REF="031725_0042_0FEE1DE6936218E0">
replied the lady. 'Why, Madam, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he has not le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and pounds.'&mdash;'Not &s;o much, Sir,' &s;aid the old lady very gravely.&mdash;'Well, Madam, I &s;up|po&s;e then it may be nineteen, or&mdash;or&mdash;only eighteen thou&s;and pounds.'&mdash;'<HI>Not &s;o much, Sir.</HI>'&mdash;'Well, well, perhaps not: but&mdash;if it was only &s;eventeen thou&s;and.'&mdash; 'No, Sir.'&mdash;'Or &s;ixteen.'&mdash;'No.'&mdash;'Or (we mu&s;t make allowances) perhaps but fifteen thou&s;and.'&mdash;'Not &s;o much, Sir.' Here en&s;ued a profound &s;ilence for near a minute; when the old gentleman, rubbing his forehead&mdash; 'Well, Madam, we mu&s;t come to &s;ome conclu&s;ion.

<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that Jealou&s;y is not the predominant pa&s;&s;ion among the ladies of America; and I would hope that few of them have occa&s;ion to doubt the con&s;tan|cy of their hu&s;bands. But as &s;ome &s;olitary individuals may &s;uffer it to rankle in their bo&s;oms, and this work is devoted to univer&s;al improvement, to check every vice, and to encourage every virtue relating to the married &s;tate; as this pa&s;&s;ion is the &s;ource of much dome&s;tic wretchedne&s;s, and bani&s;hes every plea&s;ure; I have thought it proper to devote a paper to this &s;ubject. Its aim is, to eradicate this baneful evil from every brea&s;t, which may have imprudently fo&s;tered it. I &s;hall accordingly pre&s;ent to the reader's view a humourous epi&s;tle&punc; which is happily calculated to exhibit it in a ridiculous light; and which, by a change of &s;ex, may be pointed at any gentleman, who may cheri&s;h an unfounded jealou&s;y for the virtuous friend of his bo&s;om.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are told, that in Spain it is the cu&s;tom for hu&s;|bands never to let their wives go abroad without a watch|ful old woman to attend them; and in Turkey it is the fa&s;hion to lock up their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es under the guard of a tru&s;ty eunuch: but I never knew that in any country the men were put under the &s;ame re&s;trictions. Alas! Sir, my wife is to me a very Duenna: &s;he is as careful of me, as the Kei&s;ler Aga, or Chief Eunuch, is of the Grand Seignior's favourite Sultana: and whether &s;he believes, that I am in love with every woman, or that every woman is in love with me, &s;he will never tru&s;t me out of her &s;ight; but &s;ticks as clo&s;e to me, as if &s;he really was, without a figure, bone of my bone, and fle&s;h of my fle&s;h.
<PB N="45" REF="031725_0044_0FEE1DF0F3828218">
I am never &s;uffered to &s;tir abroad without her, le&s;t I &s;hould go a&s;tray; and at home &s;he follows me up and down the hou&s;e, like a child in leading &s;trings: nay, if I do but &s;tep out of the room on any ordinary occa&s;ion, &s;he is &s;o afraid I &s;hould give her the &s;lip, that &s;he always &s;creams after me, 'My dear, you are not going out;' though, for bet|ter &s;ecurity, &s;he generally locks up my hat and cane, to|gether with her own gloves and cloak, that one may not &s;tir out without the other.</P>
<P>I cannot flatter my&s;elf, that I am hand&s;omer or better made than other men: nor has &s;he, in my eyes at lea&s;t, fewer charms than other women; and yet &s;he is &s;o very doubtful of my con&s;tancy, that I cannot &s;peak, or even pay the com|pliment of my hat, to any young lady, though in public, without giving new alarms to her jealou&s;y. Such an one, &s;he is &s;ure from her flaunting airs, is a kept madam; an|other is no better than &s;he &s;hould be; and &s;he &s;aw another tip me the wink, or give me a nod, as a mark of &s;ome pri|vate a&s;&s;ignation between us. A nun, Sir, might as &s;oon force her way into a convent of monks, as any young wom|an get admittance into our hou&s;e: &s;he has therefore af|fronted all her acquaintances of her own &s;ex, that are not, or might not have been, the grandmothers of many genera|tions; and is at home to nobody but maiden ladies in the bloom of three&s;core, and beauties of the early part of this century.</P>
<P>She tru&s;ted me one evening out of doors to &s;hare an en|tertainment abroad with &s;ome male friends; but we had &s;carcely di&s;patched the fir&s;t cour&s;e, before word was brought, that my boy was come with a lanthorn to light me home. I &s;ent him back with orders to call in an hour; when pre&s;ently after the maid was di&s;patched, with notice that my dear was gone to bed very ill, and wanted me di|rectly. I was preparing to obey the &s;ummons; when, to our great &s;urpri&s;e, the &s;ick lady her&s;elf bolted into the room, complained of my cruel heart, and fell into a fit, from which &s;he did not recover, till the coach had &s;et us down at our own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t my wife is thus cautious, that I &s;hould not be led a&s;tray even by my own &s;ex when abroad, &s;he takes par|ticular
<PB N="46" REF="031725_0045_0FEE1DF27B3CF290">
care, that I may not &s;tumble on temptation at home. It was &s;ome time after our marriage, before &s;he could find maids for her purpo&s;e. One was too pert an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;y; another went too fine; another was an impudent forward young baggage. At pre&s;ent our hou&s;ehold is made up of a &s;et of beautiful mon&s;ters. My lady's own waiting wom|an has a mo&s;t inviting hump back, and is &s;o charmingly paralytic, that &s;he &s;hakes all over, like a Chine&s;e figure; the hou&s;e-maid &s;quints mo&s;t delightfully with one &s;olitary eye, which weeps continually for the lo&s;s of its fellow; and the cook, be&s;ide a mo&s;t captivating red face and protu|berant wai&s;t, has a mo&s;t graceful hobble in her gait, occa|&s;ioned by one leg being &s;horter than the other.</P>
<P>I need not tell you, that I mu&s;t never write a letter, but my wife mu&s;t &s;ee the contents, before it is done up; and that I never dare to open one, till &s;he has broken the &s;eal, or read it, till &s;he has fir&s;t run it over. Every rap at the door from the po&s;t-man makes her tremble; and I have known her ready to bur&s;t with &s;pleen at &s;eeing a &s;uper|&s;cription, written in a fair Italian hand, though perhaps it only comes from my aunt in the country.</P>
<P>About a month ago &s;he found a my&s;terious paper in my coat pocket, which awakened all her mi&s;tru&s;t. This &s;u&s;picious manu&s;cript was drawn up in hieroglyphics; which, as &s;he could not interpret, &s;he immediately concluded to be a billet|doux from &s;ome na&s;ty creature, whom I &s;ecretly maintained in a corner of the town; and that we corre&s;ponded together, in cypher. This terrible paper, Sir, was in truth no other than a bill from my black&s;mith in the country, who, never having learnt to write, expre&s;&s;ed his meaning by characters of his own invention. Thus, if he had mended a &s;pade, he charged it to my account, by drawing&punc; as well as he could, the figure of a &s;pade, and adding at a little di&s;tance &s;ix perpendicular lines, to &s;ignify &s;ix pence; or, if he had repaired a plough, he &s;ketched out that al&s;o in the &s;ame kind of rough draught, and annexed to it four curve lines, to denote four &s;hillings. This matter I explained to my wife as fully as po&s;&s;ible, but very little to her &s;atisfaction. It is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to quiet her &s;u&s;picions: &s;he is perpetually reproaching me with my private trull, nay,
<PB N="47" REF="031725_0046_0FEE1DF40725C1F8">
upbraids me on this account before &s;trangers; and it was but la&s;t week, that &s;he put me to inconceivable confu&s;ion before a whole room of company, by telling them, that I was in love with a black&s;mith.</P>
<P>Jealou&s;y, Sir, it is &s;aid, is a &s;ign of love. It may be &s;o: but it is a &s;pecies of love, which is attended with all the malevolent properties of hate: nay, I will venture to &s;ay, that many a wife hates her hu&s;band mo&s;t heartily, without cau&s;ing him half that unea&s;ine&s;s, which my loving con&s;ort's &s;u&s;picious temper creates to me. Her jealous whims di&s;turb me the more, becau&s;e I am naturally of an even mind and calm di&s;po&s;ition: and one of the chief ble&s;&s;ings I promi&s;ed my&s;elf in matrimony was, to enjoy the &s;weets of dome&s;tic tranquillity. I loved my wife pa&s;|&s;ionately; but I mu&s;t own, that the&s;e perpetual attacks upon my peace make me regard her with le&s;s and le&s;s tenderne&s;s every day; and, though there is not a woman in the world that I would prefer to my wife, yet I am apt to think, that &s;uch violent &s;u&s;picions, without a cau&s;e, have often created real matter for jealou&s;y.</P>

<P>DECENCY and health require a due attention to cleanline&s;s. They who widely deviate from its laws, cannot engage our plea&s;ed attention. We &s;hun tho&s;e per&s;ons, or dwellings, which pre&s;ent to the eye a pro&s;pect more di&s;gu&s;ting, (becau&s;e the effect of a culpable inatten|tion, and indicative of want of delicacy,) than the incura|ble deformities of nature.</P>
<P>Neatne&s;s and cleanline&s;s are nece&s;&s;ary ornaments of the female &s;ex; and the Wife can hardly expect to in&s;pire her hu&s;band with a con&s;tant attachment to her per&s;on and hou&s;e, if, by her neglect, they generally exhibit a &s;qualid and disfigured a&s;pect. I believe, that the ladies of the UNITED STATES are not generally deficient in their atten|tion to either. But they will permit me to remind them, that they are expo&s;ed to the danger of injuring the purity and &s;weetne&s;s of their di&s;po&s;itions, by an exce&s;s of atten|tion to the latter. It is at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible, that an anxious &s;olicitude to avoid every appearance of &s;oil in their furni|ture and rooms, may produce an irritability of temper, even towards the friend of their bo&s;om, or their &s;miling off|&s;pring, when they unde&s;ignedly tre&s;pa&s;s a little on the rigid laws of neatne&s;s. They will not condemn me as an advo|cate for uncleanline&s;s, when I &s;ay, that an angry counte|nance or expre&s;&s;ions of &s;everity are far more di&s;gu&s;ting than any &s;tain, which di&s;appears before the applying hand of indu&s;try; and that it is of greater moment, to &s;ecure the approbation of a hu&s;band and the affections of their happy children, than to enjoy the applau&s;e of a momentary vi&s;itant, for exhibiting the tokens of a nice attention to the dre&s;s of their apartments. To impre&s;s the idea &s;till more forcibly on tho&s;e few, who may cheri&s;h the fault, which

we wi&s;h to eradicate; to re&s;tore and perpetuate dome&s;tic tranquillity, that bright jewel of the married life; I &s;ub|join the following letter from a corre&s;pondent.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM married to a lady of a very nice and delicate di&s;po&s;ition, who is cried up by all the good women of her acquaintance, for being the Neate&s;t Body in her hou&s;e they ever knew.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that a due regard to neatne&s;s and cleanline&s;s is as nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved in our habitations as our per&s;ons: yet I do not like to have my hou&s;e ren|dered u&s;ele&s;s to me under the pretence of keeping it clean.</P>
<P>For my own part, I cannot &s;ee the difference between having an hou&s;e, that is always dirty, and an hou&s;e that is always to be cleaned. I could very willingly com|pound to be wa&s;hed out of my home once in the week: but my wife is &s;o very notable, that the &s;ame clean&s;ing work mu&s;t be repeated every day in the week. All the morning long I am &s;ure to be entertained with the dome&s;tic concert of &s;crubbing the floors, &s;couring the irons, and beating the carpets; and I am con&s;tantly hunted from room to room, whil&s;t one is to be du&s;ted, another dry-rubbed, another wa&s;hed, and another run over with a dry mop. Thus, indeed, I may be &s;aid to live in continual dirtine&s;s, that my hou&s;e may be clean; for, during the&s;e nice operations, every apartment is &s;towed with &s;oap, brick-du&s;t, &s;and, &s;crubbing-bru&s;hes, hair-brooms, rag-mops, and di&s;h-clouts.</P>
<P>You may &s;uppo&s;e, that the greate&s;t care is taken to pre|vent the lea&s;t &s;peck of dirt from &s;oiling the floors. For this rea&s;on all that come to our hou&s;e (be&s;ide the ceremo|ny of &s;craping at the door) are obliged to rub their &s;hoes for half an hour on a large ragged mat at the entrance; and then they mu&s;t &s;traddle their way along &s;everal le&s;s mats, ranged at due di&s;tances from each other in the pa&s;&s;age, and (like boys at play) come into the room with an hop, a &s;tep, and a jump. The like caution is u&s;ed by all the family. I my&s;elf am &s;carce allowed to &s;tir a &s;tep without &s;lippers; my wife creeps on tip-toe up and down
<PB N="50" REF="031725_0049_0FEE1DFFF0E87A30">
&s;tairs; the maid-&s;ervants are continually &s;tumping below in clogs or pattens; and the footman is obliged to &s;neak about the hou&s;e bare-footed, as if he came with a &s;ly de|&s;ign to &s;teal &s;omething.</P>
<P>This extraordinary &s;olicitude in my wife for the clean|line&s;s of her rooms, and the care and pre&s;ervation of her furniture, makes my hou&s;e entirely u&s;ele&s;s, and takes away all that ea&s;e and familiarity, which is the chief com|fort of one's own home. I mu&s;t drink out of an earthen mug, though a great quantity of plate is con&s;tantly di&s;|played on the &s;ide-board; whil&s;t all the furniture, except when we have company, is done up in paper, as if the family, to whom it belongs, were gone into the country. In a word, Sir, any thing that is decent and cleanly is too good to be u&s;ed, for fear it &s;hould be dirtied; and I live with every convenience at hand, without the power of en|joying one of them. I have elegant apartments, but am al|mo&s;t afraid to enter them; I have plate, china, and the mo&s;t genteel furniture, but mu&s;t not u&s;e them; which is as ridiculous an ab&s;urdity, and almo&s;t as great an hard&s;hip, as if I had hands without the power of moving them; the organs of &s;ight, &s;mell, ta&s;te, without being &s;uffered to exert them; and feet without being permitted to walk. Thus, Sir, this extravagant pa&s;&s;ion for cleanline&s;s keeps the family in a perpetual &s;tate of muck and dirt; and, whil&s;t we are &s;urrounded with all nece&s;&s;aries, &s;ubjects us to every inconvenience. But what makes it &s;till a greater grievance is, that it has been the ridiculous cau&s;e of many other misfortunes. I have &s;ometimes created her anger by lit|tering the room with throwing my garters on a chair, or hanging my peruke on one of the gilt &s;conces. Having once unluckily &s;pilt a bottle of ink on one of the be&s;t car|pets, &s;he was irreconcileable for a month; and I had &s;carcely brought her to temper again, when I mo&s;t unfortu|nately run again&s;t the footman, who was entering with the dinner, and threw down a leg of pork and pea&s;e-pud|ding on the parlour floor. This &s;uperabundant neatne&s;s did once al&s;o very nearly occa&s;ion my death; for whil&s;t I lay ill of a fever, my delicate wife, thinking it would refre&s;h me, ordered my bed-chamber to be mopped: and
<PB N="51" REF="031725_0050_0FEE1E01786729C8">
the &s;ame &s;crupulous nicety was al&s;o the mean of our lo&s;ing a very con&s;iderable addition to our fortune.</P>
<P>A rich old uncle, on whom we had great dependence, came to town la&s;t &s;ummer on purpo&s;e to pay us a vi&s;it: but, though he had rode above fifty miles that day, he was obliged to &s;tand in the pa&s;&s;age till his boots were pull|ed off, for fear of &s;oiling the Turkey-carpet. After &s;up|per the old gentleman, as was his con&s;tant practice, de&s;ir|ed to have his pipe: but this, to be &s;ure, could by no means be allowed, as the filthy &s;tench of the tobacco would never be gotten out of the furniture again; and it was with much ado that my wife would even &s;uffer him to go and &s;moke in the kitchen. We had no room to lodge him in, except a garret with bare walls; becau&s;e the Chints bed-chamber was, indeed, too nice for a dirty country &s;quire. The&s;e &s;lights very much chagrined my good uncle: but he had not been with us above a day or two, before my wife and he came to an open quarrel on the following occa&s;ion. It happened, that he had brought a favourite pointer with him, who at his fir&s;t coming was immediately locked up in the coal-hole: but the dog, hav|ing found means to e&s;cape, had crept &s;lyly up &s;tairs, and had very calmly &s;tretched him&s;elf out upon a crim&s;on dam|a&s;k &s;ofa. My wife not only &s;entenced him to the di&s;ci|pline of the whip, but in&s;i&s;ted upon having the criminal hanged up afterwards; when the ma&s;ter interpo&s;ing in his behalf, it produced &s;uch high words between them, that my uncle ordered his hor&s;e, and &s;wore he would never darken our doors again, as long as he breathed. He went home, and about two months after died: but as he could not forgive the ill treatment which both he and his dog had met with at our hou&s;e, he had altered his will, which before he had made entirely in our favour.</P>

<P>All the&s;e inconveniencies are incident to love; reproaches, jeal|ou&s;ies, quarrels, reconcilements, war, and then peace.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE marquis of HALLIFAX, in his "advice to a daughter," has in&s;tructed a wife how to behave her&s;elf towards a fal&s;e, an intemperate, a choleric, a &s;ul|len, a covetous or a &s;illy hu&s;band, but has not &s;poken one word of a jealous hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Jealou&s;y is that pain which a man feels from the appre|hen&s;ion that he is not equally beloved by the per&s;on whom he entirely loves. Now, becau&s;e our inward pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations can never make them&s;elves vi&s;ible, it is impo&s;|&s;ible for a jealous man to be thoroughly cured of his &s;u&s;|picions. His thoughts hang at be&s;t in a &s;tate of doubtful|ne&s;s and uncertainty; and are never capable of receiving any &s;atisfaction on the advantageous &s;ide; &s;o that his in|quiries are mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful when they di&s;cover nothing: his plea&s;ure ari&s;es from his di&s;appointments, and his life is &s;pent in pur&s;uit of a &s;ecret that de&s;troys his happine&s;s if he chance to find it.</P>
<P>An ardent love is always a &s;trong ingredient in this pa&s;&s;ion; for the &s;ame affection which &s;tirs up the jealous man's de&s;ires, and gives the party beloved &s;o beautiful a figure in his imagination, makes him believe &s;he kindles the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion in others, and appears as amiable to all beholders. And as jealou&s;y thus ari&s;es from an extraor|dinary love, it is of &s;o delicate a nature, that it &s;corns to take up with any thing le&s;s than an equal return of love. Not the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of affection, the &s;ofte&s;t and mo&s;t tender hypocri&s;y, are able to give any &s;atisfaction, where we are not per&s;uaded that the affection is real, and the &s;atisfaction mutual: for the jealous man wi&s;hes him&s;elf
<PB N="53" REF="031725_0052_0FEE1E0A0C184488">
a kind of deity to the per&s;on he loves; he would be the only plea&s;ure of her &s;en&s;es, the employment of her thoughts; and is angry at every thing &s;he admires, or takes delight in, be&s;ides him&s;elf.</P>
<P>PHAEDRIA's reque&s;t to his mi&s;tre&s;s, upon his leaving her for three days, is inimitably beautiful and natural.</P>

<P>"When you are in company with that &s;oldier, behave as if you were ab&s;ent; but continue to love me by day and by night: want me; dream of me; expect me; think of me; wi&s;h for me; delight in me; be wholly with me; in &s;hort, be my very &s;oul, as I am yours."</P>
<P>The jealous man's di&s;ea&s;e is of &s;o malignant a nature, that it converts all it takes into its own nouri&s;hment. A cool behaviour &s;ets him on the rack, and is interpreted as an in&s;tance of aver&s;ion or indifference; a fond one rai&s;es his &s;u&s;picions, and looks too much like di&s;&s;imulation and artifice. If the per&s;on he loves be cheerful, her thoughts mu&s;t be employed on another; and if &s;ad, &s;he is certainly thinking on him&s;elf. In &s;hort, there is no word or ge&s;ture &s;o in&s;ignificant but it gives him new hints, feeds his &s;u&s;|picions, and furni&s;hes him with fre&s;h matters of di&s;covery: &s;o that if we con&s;ider the effects of this pa&s;&s;ion, one would rather think it proceeded from an inveterate hatred than an exce&s;&s;ive love; for certainly none can meet with more di&s;quietude and unea&s;ine&s;s than a &s;u&s;pected wife, if we except the jealous hu&s;band.</P>
<P>But the great unhappine&s;s of this pa&s;&s;ion is, that it nat|urally tends to alienate the affection which it is &s;o &s;olicit|ous to engro&s;s; and that for the&s;e two rea&s;ons, becau&s;e it lays too great a con&s;traint on the words and actions of the &s;u&s;pected per&s;on, and at the &s;ame time &s;hews you have no honourable opinion of her; both of which are &s;trong motives to aver&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="031725_0053_0FEE1E0D66931388">Nor is this the wor&s;t effect of jealou&s;y; for it often draws after it a more fatal train of con&s;equences, and makes the per&s;on you &s;u&s;pect, guilty of the very crimes you are &s;o much afraid of. It is very natural for &s;uch who are treated ill and upbraided fal&s;ely, to find out an intimate friend that will hear their complaints, condole their &s;ufferings, and endeavour to &s;o the and a&s;&s;uage their &s;ecret re&s;entments. Be&s;ides, jealou&s;y puts a woman often in mind of an ill thing that &s;he would not otherwi&s;e per|haps have thought of, and fills her imagination with &s;uch an unlucky idea, as in time grows familiar, excites de&s;ire, and lo&s;es all the &s;hame and horror which might at fir&s;t attend it. Nor is it a wonder if &s;he who &s;uffers wrong|fully in a man's opinion of her, and has therefore nothing to forfeit in his e&s;teem, re&s;olves to give him rea&s;on for his &s;u&s;picions, and to enjoy the plea&s;ure of the crime, &s;ince &s;he mu&s;t undergo the ignominy. Such probably were the con&s;iderations that directed the wi&s;e man in his advice to a hu&s;band; "Be not jealous over the wife of thy bo&s;om; and teach her not an evil le&s;&s;on again&s;t thy&s;elf." ECCLUS.</P>
<P>And here, among the other torments which this pa&s;&s;ion produces, we may u&s;ually ob&s;erve that none are greater mourners than jealous men, when the per&s;on who pro|voked their jealou&s;y is taken from them. Then it is that their love breaks out furiou&s;ly, and throws off all the mixtures of &s;u&s;picion which choaked and &s;mothered it be|fore. The beautiful parts of the character ri&s;e uppermo&s;t in the jealous hu&s;band's memory, and upbraid him with the ill u&s;age of &s;o divine a creature as was once in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; whil&s;t all the little imperfections, that were be|fore &s;o unea&s;y to him, wear off from his remembrance, and &s;hew them&s;elves no more.</P>
<P>We may &s;ee by what has been &s;aid, that jealou&s;y takes the deepe&s;t root in men of amorous di&s;po&s;itions, and of the&s;e we may find three kinds who are mo&s;t over-run with it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t are tho&s;e who are con&s;cious to them&s;elves of an infirmity, whether it be weakne&s;s, old age, deformity, ignorance, or the like. The&s;e men are &s;o well acquainted with the unamiable part of them&s;elves, that they have not
<PB N="55" REF="031725_0054_0FEE1E0EEEF0CCC8">
the confidence to think they are really beloved; and are &s;o di&s;tru&s;tful of their own merits, that all fondne&s;s to|wards them puts them out of countenance, and looks like a je&s;t upon their per&s;ons. They grow &s;u&s;picious on their fir&s;t looking in a gla&s;s, and are &s;tung with jealou&s;y at the &s;ight of a wrinkle. A hand&s;ome fellow immediately alarms them, and every thing that looks young or gay turns their thoughts upon their wives.</P>
<P>A &s;econd &s;ort of men, who are mo&s;t liable to this pa&s;|&s;ion, are tho&s;e of cunning, wary, and di&s;tru&s;tful tempers. It is a fault very ju&s;tly found in hi&s;tories compo&s;ed by politicians, that they leave nothing to chance or humour, but are &s;till deriving every action from &s;ome plot and con|trivance, for drawing up a perpetual &s;cheme of cau&s;es and events, and pre&s;erving a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence between the camp and the council-table. And thus it happens in the affairs of love with men of too refined a thought. They put a con&s;truction on a look, and find out a de&s;ign in a &s;mile; they give new &s;en&s;es and &s;ignifications to words and actions, and are ever tormenting them&s;elves with fancies of their own rai&s;ing. They generally act in a di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves, and therefore mi&s;take all outward &s;hows and appearances for hypocri&s;y in others: &s;o that I believe no men &s;ee le&s;s of the truth and reality of things than the&s;e great refiners upon incidents, who are &s;o won|derfully &s;ubtle and over-wife in their conceptions.</P>
<P>Now what the&s;e men fancy they know of women by reflection, your lewd and vicious men believe they have learned by experience. They have &s;een the poor hu&s;band &s;o mi&s;led by tricks and artifices, and in the mid&s;t of his inquiries &s;o lo&s;t and bewildered in a crooked intrigue, that they &s;till &s;u&s;pect an under-plot in every female action; and e&s;pecially where they &s;ee any re&s;emblance in the be|haviour of two per&s;ons, are apt to fancy it proceeds from the &s;ame de&s;ign in both. The&s;e men therefore bear hard upon the &s;u&s;pected party, pur&s;ue her clo&s;e through all her turnings and windings, and are too well acquainted with the chace, to be flung off by any fal&s;e &s;teps or doubles; be&s;ides, their acquaintance and conver&s;ation has lain wholly among the vicious part of womankind, and there|fore
<PB N="56" REF="031725_0055_0FEE1E125500C908">
it is no wonder they cen&s;ure all alike, and look upon the whole &s;ex as a &s;pecies of impo&s;tors. But if, notwith|&s;tanding their private experience, they can get over the&s;e prejudices, and entertain a favourable opinion of &s;ome WOMEN; yet their own loo&s;e de&s;ires will &s;tir up new &s;u&s;|picions from another &s;ide, and make them believe all MEN &s;ubject to the &s;ame inclinations with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>After this frightful account of jealou&s;y, and the per&s;ons who are mo&s;t &s;ubject to it, it will be but fair to &s;hew by what means the pa&s;&s;ion may be be&s;t allayed, and tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with it &s;et at ea&s;e. Other faults indeed are not under the wife's juri&s;diction, and &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, e&s;cape her ob&s;ervation; but jealou&s;y calls upon her par|ticularly for its cure, and de&s;erves all her art and applica|tion in the attempt; be&s;ides, &s;he has this for her encour|agement, that her endeavours will be always plea&s;ing, and that &s;he will &s;till find the affection of her hu&s;band ri&s;ing towards her, in proportion as his doubts and &s;u&s;picions vani&s;h; for, as we have &s;een all along, there is &s;o great a mixture of love in jealou&s;y, as is well worth the &s;eparating.</P>

<P>HAVING in my la&s;t paper di&s;covered the nature of jealou&s;y, and pointed out the per&s;ons who are mo&s;t &s;ubject to it, I mu&s;t here apply my&s;elf to tho&s;e ladies who de&s;ire to live well with a jealous hu&s;band, and to ea&s;e his mind of its unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t rule I &s;hall propo&s;e to be ob&s;erved, is, that you never &s;eem to di&s;like in another what the jealous man is him&s;elf guilty of, or to admire any thing in which he him&s;elf does not excel. A jealous man is very quick in his applications; he knows how to find a double edge in an invective, and to draw a &s;atire on him&s;elf out of a pan|egyric on another. He does not trouble him&s;elf to con|&s;ider the per&s;on, but to direct the character; and is &s;ecretly plea&s;ed or confounded as he finds more or le&s;s of him&s;elf in it. The commendation of any thing in another &s;tirs up his jealou&s;y, as it &s;hews you have a value for oth|ers be&s;ides him&s;elf; but the commendation of that which he him&s;elf wants, inflames him more, as it &s;hews that in &s;ome re&s;pects you prefer others before him. Jealou&s;y is admirably de&s;cribed in this view by HORACE in his ode to LYDIA.</P>

<P>The jealous man is not indeed angry if you di&s;like an|other; but if you find tho&s;e faults which are to be found in his own character, you di&s;cover not only your di&s;like of another, but of him&s;elf. In &s;hort, he is &s;o de&s;irous of engro&s;&s;ing all your love, that he is grieved at the want of any charm, which he believes has power to rai&s;e it; and if he finds by your cen&s;ures on others, that he is not &s;o agreeable in your opinion as he might be, he naturally concludes you could love him better if he had other qual|ifications, and that by con&s;equence your affection does not ri&s;e &s;o high as he thinks it ought. If therefore his tem|per be grave or &s;ullen, you mu&s;t not be too much plea&s;ed with a je&s;t, or tran&s;ported with any thing that is gay and diverting. If his beauty be none of the be&s;t, you mu&s;t be a profe&s;&s;ed admirer of prudence, or any other quality he is ma&s;ter of, or at lea&s;t vain enough to think he is.</P>

A jealous hu&s;band has a particular aver&s;ion to winks and whi&s;pers, and if he does not &s;ee to the bottom of every thing, will be &s;ure to go beyond it in his fears and &s;u&s;picions.

kept out of a &s;ecret, will believe there is more in it than there &s;hould be. And here it is of great concern, that you pre&s;erve the character of your &s;incerity uniform and of a piece; for if he once finds a fal&s;e glo&s;s put upon any &s;ingle action, he quickly &s;u&s;pects all the re&s;t; his working imagination immediately takes a fal&s;e hint, and runs off with it into &s;everal remote con&s;equences, till he has proved very ingenious in working out his own mi&s;ery.</P>

There are many who take a kind of barbarous plea&s;ure in the jealou&s;y of tho&s;e who love them, that in&s;ult over an aching heart, and triumph in the charms which are able to excite &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<P>But the&s;e often carry the humour &s;o far, till their affect|ed coldne&s;s and indifference quite kills all the fondne&s;s of a lover, and are then &s;ure to meet in their turn with all the contempt and &s;corn that is due to &s;o in&s;olent a beha|viour. On the contrary, it is very probable a melancholy dejected carriage, the u&s;ual effect of injured innocence, may &s;often the jealous hu&s;band into pity, make him &s;en&s;i|ble of the wrong he does you, and work out of his mind all tho&s;e fears and &s;u&s;picions that make you both unhappy. At lea&s;t it will have this good effect, that he will keep his jealou&s;y to him&s;elf, and repine in private; either becau&s;e he is &s;en&s;ible it is a weakne&s;s, and will therefore hide it from your knowledge, or becau&s;e he will be apt to fear &s;ome ill effect it may produce, in cooling your love towards him, or diverting it to another.</P>
<P>There is &s;till another &s;ecret that can never fail, if you can once get it believed, and which is often practi&s;ed by women of greater cunning than virtue: this is to change &s;ides for a while with the jealous man, and to turn his own pa&s;&s;ion upon him&s;elf; to take &s;ome occa&s;ion of grow|ing
<PB N="60" REF="031725_0059_0FEE1E1E12063648">
jealous of him, and to follow the example he him&s;elf hath &s;et you. This counterfeited jealou&s;y will bring him a great deal of plea&s;ure, if he thinks it real; for he knows experimentally how much love goes along with this pa&s;|&s;ion, and will, be&s;ides, feel &s;omething like the &s;atisfaction of revenge, in &s;eeing you undergo all his tortures. But this, indeed, is an artifice &s;o difficult, and at the &s;ame time &s;o di&s;ingenuous, that it ought never to be put in prac|tice, but by &s;uch as have &s;kill enough to cover the deceit, and innocence to render it excu&s;able.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this e&s;&s;ay with the &s;tory of HEROD and MARIAMNE, as I have collected it out of JOSEPHUS; which may &s;erve almo&s;t as an example to whatever can be &s;aid on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>MARIAMNE had all the charms that beauty, birth, wit and youth could give a woman, and HEROD all the love that &s;uch charms are able to rai&s;e in a warm and amorous di&s;po&s;ition. In the mid&s;t of all this his fondne&s;s for MA|RIAMNE, he put her brother to death, as he did her father not many years after. The barbarity of the action was repre&s;ented to MARK ANTONY, who immediately &s;um|moned HEROD into Egypt, to an&s;wer to the crime that was there laid to his charge. HEROD attributed the &s;um|mons to ANTONY'S de&s;ire of MARIAMNE, whom, there|fore, before his departure, he gave into the cu&s;tody of his uncle JOSEPH, with private orders to put her to death, if any &s;uch violence was offered to him&s;elf. This JOSEPH was much delighted with MARIAMNE's conver&s;ation, and endeavoured, with all his art and rhetoric, to &s;et out the exce&s;s of HEROD's pa&s;&s;ion for her; but when he found her &s;till cold and incredulous, he incon&s;iderately told her, as a certain in&s;tance of her lord's affection, the private orders he had left behind him; which plainly &s;hewed, according to JOSEPH's interpretation, that he could nei|ther live nor die without her. This barbarous in&s;tance of a wild unrea&s;onable pa&s;&s;ion quite put out for a time tho&s;e little remains of affection &s;he had for her lord. Her thoughts were &s;o wholly taken up with the cruelty of his orders, that &s;he could not con&s;ider the kindne&s;s that pro|duced them, and therefore repre&s;ented him in her imag|ination,
<PB N="61" REF="031725_0060_0FEE1E26E89461C8">
rather under the frightful idea of a murderer than a lover. HEROD was at length acquitted and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by MARK ANTONY, when his &s;oul was all in flames for his MARIAMNE; but before their meeting, he was not a little alarmed at the report he had heard of his uncle's conver&s;ation and familiarity with her in his ab&s;ence. This, therefore, was the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e he entertained her with, in which &s;he found it no ea&s;y matter to quiet his &s;u&s;pi|cions. But at la&s;t he appeared &s;o well &s;atisfied of her in|nocence, that from reproaches and wranglings he fell to tears and embraces. Both of them wept very tenderly at their reconciliation, and HEROD poured out his whole &s;oul to her in the warme&s;t prote&s;tations of love and con|&s;tancy; when amid&s;t all his &s;ighs and langui&s;hings &s;he a&s;ked him, whether the private orders he left with his uncle JOSEPH were an in&s;tance of &s;uch an inflamed affec|tion. The jealous king was immediately rou&s;ed at &s;o unexpected a que&s;tion, and concluded his uncle mu&s;t have been too familiar with her, before he would have di&s;covered &s;uch a &s;ecret. In &s;hort, he put his uncle to death, and very difficulty prevailed on him&s;elf to &s;pare MARIAMNE.</P>
<P>After this he was forced on a &s;econd journey into Egypt, when he committed his lady to the care of SO|HEMUS, with the &s;ame private orders he had before given his uncle, if any mi&s;chief befel him&s;elf. In the mean time, MARIAMNE &s;o won upon SONEMUS by her pre&s;ents and obliging conver&s;ation, that &s;he drew all the &s;ecret from him, with which HEROD had intru&s;ted him; &s;o that after his return, when he flew to her with all the tran&s;ports of joy and love, &s;he received him coldly with &s;ighs and tears, and all the marks of indifference and aver&s;ion. This re|ception &s;o &s;tirred up his indignation, that he had certainly &s;lain her with his own hands, had not he feared he him|&s;elf &s;hould have become the greater &s;ufferer by it. It was not long after this, when he had another violent return of love upon him: MARIAMNE was therefore &s;ent for to him, whom he endeavoured to &s;often and reconcile with all po&s;&s;ible conjugal care&s;&s;es and endearments; but &s;he de|clined his embraces, and an&s;wered all his fondne&s;s with
<PB N="62" REF="031725_0061_0FEE1E2870B10AC8">
bitter invectives for the death of her father and her broth|er. This behaviour &s;o incen&s;ed HEROD, that he very hardly refrained from &s;triking her; when in the heat of their quarrel, there came in a witne&s;s, &s;uborned by &s;ome of MARIAMNE's enemies, who accu&s;ed her to the king of a de&s;ign to poi&s;on him. HEROD was now prepared to hear any thing to her prejudice, and immediately ordered her &s;ervant to be &s;tretched upon the rack; who, in the ex|tremity of his tortures, confe&s;&s;ed, that his mi&s;tre&s;s's aver|&s;ion to the king aro&s;e from &s;omething SOHEMUS had told her; but as for any de&s;ign of poi&s;oning, he utterly di&s;own|ed the lea&s;t knowledge of it. This confe&s;&s;ion quickly proved fatal to SOHEMUS, who now lay under the &s;ame &s;u&s;picions and &s;entence that JOSEPH had &s;uffered before him on the like occa&s;ion. Nor would HEROD re&s;t here, but accu&s;ed her with great vehemence of a de&s;ign upon his life, and by his authority with the judges, had her pub|lickly condemned and executed. HEROD &s;oon after her death grew melancholy and dejected; he retired from the public admini&s;tration of affairs into a &s;olitary fore&s;t, and there abandoned him&s;elf to all the black con&s;iderations, which naturally ari&s;e from a pa&s;&s;ion made up of love, re|mor&s;e, pity and de&s;pair. He u&s;ed to rave for his MARI|AMNE, and to call upon her in his di&s;tracted fits; and in all probability would &s;oon have followed her, had not his thoughts been &s;ea&s;onably called off from &s;o &s;ad an object by public &s;torms, which, at that time, very nearly threat|ened him.</P>

<P>THE many misfortunes ari&s;ing to interrupt the joys and de&s;troy the peace of conjugal felicity, generally proceed from our not duly weighing beforehand, in what the comforts and conveniencies of matrimony con&s;i&s;t. In order to &s;ecure, as far as human prudence is capable, hap|pine&s;s in a wedded &s;tate, it is fir&s;t to be mutually con&s;ider|ed, whether the mind of the party we are about to engage with in this important affair, is formed on the principles of virtue; without which the duties of conjugal affection and friend&s;hip can never long &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="64" REF="031725_0063_0FEE1E2B83FF25C8">2dly, That riches are not to be looked upon as the only incitement to &s;uch an engagement; becau&s;e, when wealth is merely the motive, la&s;ting felicity is not to be expected.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, That the charms of a good face, without the beauties of that better part, the mind, &s;hould not bewitch us &s;o far, as to entail mi&s;ery and di&s;quietudes as long as life endures; which is too frequently the ca&s;e, when appetite is fated.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, It &s;hould be the mutual re&s;olution of tho&s;e, who are about to enter into that &s;tate, or are already engaged in it, to confine them&s;elves, according to their &s;tation in life, to &s;uch &s;ort of plea&s;ures only, which their circum|&s;tances will admit of, and which are con&s;i&s;tent with the duty of rea&s;onable and virtuous beings. A contrary be|haviour will be attended with dreadful con&s;equences, whereas the conduct abovementioned will lead us to real happine&s;s. The following &s;tory may &s;erve to illu&s;trate the truth of what is here advanced.</P>
<P>EUGENIO was a young gentleman, from the nature of his education addicted to gaiety and expen&s;e; which he &s;upported by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of good &s;en&s;e and a plentiful for|tune, without injuring his reputation or e&s;tate. Having no family of his own, he made a vi&s;it to a friend, with a de&s;ign of pa&s;&s;ing the &s;ummer with him in the country. SOPHRONIA happened to be there at the &s;ame time, by the invitation of the lady of the hou&s;e, with whom &s;he had always been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ducated. Her per&s;on was nothing remarka|ble, but a &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition and a good natural under&s;tand|ing made her conver&s;ation agreeable. Upon his fir&s;t ar|rival, EUGENIO was too well bred not to &s;hew a particu|lar civility to one &s;o much re&s;pected by the family; and SOPHRONIA knew how to return it by a &s;uitable behaviour. They had not been long acquainted, before the &s;pright|line&s;s of his conver&s;ation, and the amiable innocence of hers, begot a mutual de&s;ire of rendering them&s;elves agree|able to each other. EUGENIO's education had been too ingenuous to harbour a wi&s;h that was di&s;honourable; and SOPHRONIA willingly encouraged a virtuous inclination, that would be &s;o much for her advantage. She knew he
<PB N="65" REF="031725_0064_0FEE1E345EA14B18">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no ill qualities, and thought he would ea&s;ily be weaned from his love of &s;how and expen&s;e, by a more &s;ettled way of life. But his de&s;ire to live &s;plendidly got the better of his pa&s;&s;ion: he would not throw him&s;elf away upon one, who had but three thou&s;and pounds for her portion; &s;o determined to return immediately to Lon|don, and obliterate his fondne&s;s by the diver&s;ions of the town.</P>
<P>THEANA came up about the &s;ame time, to &s;pend the winter with her aunt. She was the only daughter of a gentleman of fortune, by who&s;e death &s;he was lately come into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of above fifteen thou&s;and pounds. She was determined never to marry a man, who could not &s;up|port her in the magnificence that &s;uch a fortune might ex|pect; and for that rea&s;on only had refu&s;ed EUPHORBUS, a young gentleman bred up to a profe&s;&s;ion, in which his natural abilities, joined to a &s;teady application, promi&s;ed him the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. They had long been acquainted, and &s;o perfectly agreeable to each other, that EUPHORBUS had ju&s;t rea&s;on to hope he &s;hould prevail over her de&s;ire of grandeur, which was her only foible. But that pa&s;&s;ion was predominant: &s;he was afraid it &s;hould be &s;aid &s;he had acted imprudently, and that &s;he &s;hould not be able to with&s;tand the reflections of the world, for having only one footman behind a chariot and pair, when &s;he might have had half a dozen powdered valets attending her coach and &s;ix.</P>
<P>Upon her coming to London, EUGENIO made his ad|dre&s;&s;es to her among the re&s;t; and as his fortune enabled him to make a &s;uitable &s;ettlement, preliminaries were &s;oon agreed on. Before they had been ten times together, the lawyers were bribed not to be dilatory. Several thou&s;ands were expended in plate and jewels. The gay livery and gilded car proclaimed them the happie&s;t couple of the &s;ea|&s;on. But they &s;oon found that happine&s;s did not con&s;i&s;t in &s;how. Little contrarieties of temper were the cau&s;es of continual differences; which, in le&s;s than two years, aro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that they were, in a manner, parted. To avoid the unea&s;ine&s;s of home, EUGENIO publickly indulged him&s;elf in his amours; and THEANA was only more pri|vate. His money was thrown away at hazard; hers as
<PB N="66" REF="031725_0065_0FEE1E35E74F0CA0">
religiou&s;ly devoted to quadrille. He was regardle&s;s of the education of his &s;ons, becau&s;e he was not &s;ure they were his own; &s;he in&s;tructed her daughters in nothing but cards and romances.</P>
<P>But it is time to make &s;ome inquiry after the other two. The next winter after her di&s;appointment, SOPHRONIA came to London with her female friend. EUPHORBUS accidentally fell into her company. Frequent meetings created an acquaintance; that acquaintance increa&s;ed grad|ually into a mutual e&s;teem; which, as it was not founded on intere&s;t, but a thorough knowledge of each other, they had good rea&s;on to believe would continue. With this pro&s;pect they married. The &s;mallne&s;s of their fortune was compen&s;ated by tenderne&s;s and economy. The de|&s;ire of providing for his children made him double his ap|plication to his profe&s;&s;ion; and &s;he was in the mean time as agreeably entertained in taking care of their education. He was daily adding to their fortune, &s;he to their virtue. In the decline of life they retired to a country-hou&s;e and e&s;tate, which his profe&s;&s;ion and her economy had enabled them to buy of EUGENIO, who&s;e extravagance and ill management had obliged him to &s;ell part of his e&s;tate, as &s;oon as a booby &s;on was old enough to be bribed to cut off the entail: there, in the words of AGAMEMNON,
<Q><L>They know a pa&s;&s;ion &s;till more deeply charming</L>
<L>Than fever'd youth e'er felt; and that is love,</L>
<L>By long experience mellow'd into friend&s;hip.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus are EUPHORBUS and SOPHRONIA, by a marriage founded on good &s;en&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of happine&s;s, riches, and reputation, which EUGENIO and THEANA have lo&s;t by the contrary means.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MANY writers &s;eem to have admitted, as an incon|te&s;ted principle, that "marriage is generally un|happy:" but I know not whether it becomes a man who profe&s;&s;es to think for him&s;elf, and forms his opinions from his own ob&s;ervations, to follow the crowd implicitly, and receive maxims without recalling them to new examina|tion, e&s;pecially when they compri&s;e &s;o great a complica|tion, and include &s;uch variety of circum&s;tances. As I have an equal right with others to give my opinion of the objects about me, and a better title to determine concern|ing that &s;tate which I have tried, than many who talk of it without experience, I am unwilling to be re&s;trained by mere authority from advancing, what, I believe, an accu|rate view of the world will confirm, that marriage is not commonly unhappy, otherwi&s;e than as life is unhappy; and that mo&s;t of tho&s;e who complain of connubial mi&s;e|ries, have as much &s;atisfaction as their nature would have admitted, or their conduct procured in any other condition.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, common to hear both &s;exes repine at their condition, relate the happine&s;s of their earlier years, blame the folly and ra&s;hne&s;s of their own choice, and warn tho&s;e whom they &s;ee coming into the world again&s;t the &s;ame pre|cipitance and infatuation. But it is to be remembered, that the days which they &s;o much wi&s;h to call back, are the days not only of celibacy, but of youth, the days of nov|elty and improvement, of ardour and of hope, of health and vigour of body, of gaiety and lightne&s;s of heart. It
<PB N="68" REF="031725_0067_0FEE1E38F842E0B8">
is not ea&s;y to unite life with any circum&s;tances in which youth will not be delightful; and I am afraid that wheth|er married, or unmarried, we &s;hall find the ve&s;ture of ter|re&s;trial exi&s;tence more heavy and cumbrous, the longer it is worn.</P>
<P>That both cen&s;ure them&s;elves for the indi&s;cretion of their choice, is not a &s;ufficient proof that they have cho&s;en ill, &s;ince we &s;ee the &s;ame di&s;content at every other part of life which we cannot change. Conver&s;e with almo&s;t any man, grown old in a profe&s;&s;ion, and you will find him re|gretting that he did not enter into &s;ome way of life, to which he too late finds his genius better adapted, or in which he di&s;covers that wealth and honour are more ea&s;ily attained. The merchant, &s;ays Horace, envies the &s;oldier, and the &s;oldier recounts the felicity of the merchant; the lawyer, when his clients hara&s;s him, calls out for the quiet of the countryman; and the countryman, when bu&s;i|ne&s;s calls him to town, exclaims that there is no happine&s;s but in public life. Every man recounts the mi&s;eries of his own &s;tation, and always thinks tho&s;e of any other le&s;s, becau&s;e he has not felt them. Thus the married prai&s;e the ea&s;e and freedom of a &s;ingle life, and the &s;ingle fly to marriage from the wearine&s;s of &s;olitude. From all our ob&s;ervations we may collect with certainty, that mi&s;ery is the lot of man, but cannot di&s;cover in what particular &s;tate it will find mo&s;t alleviations; or whether all external ap|pendages are not, as we u&s;e them well or ill, the cau&s;es either of pain or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Whoever feels great pain naturally hopes for ea&s;e from change of po&s;ture; he changes it, and finds him&s;elf equally tormented: and of the &s;ame kind are the expedi|ents by which we endeavour to obviate or elude tho&s;e un|ea&s;ine&s;&s;es to which mortality will always be &s;ubject. It is, however, not likely that the marriage &s;tate is eminently mi&s;|erable, &s;ince we &s;ee &s;uch numbers, whom the death of their partners has &s;et free from it, entering it again.</P>
<P>Wives and hu&s;bands are, indeed, too frequently com|plaining of each other; and there would be rea&s;on for imagining that in numerous in&s;tances there was perver&s;e|ne&s;s, or oppre&s;&s;ion, beyond human &s;ufferance, did we not
<PB N="69" REF="031725_0068_0FEE1E41E19E75E8">
know how readily &s;ome minds bur&s;t out into reproaches and lamentations, and how naturally every animal revenges his pain upon tho&s;e who happen to be near, without any nice examination of its cau&s;e. We are always willing to fancy our&s;elves within a little of happine&s;s, and when, with repeated efforts, we cannot reach it, per&s;uade our|&s;elves that it is intercepted by an ill-paired mate, &s;ince, if we could find any other ob&s;tacle, it would be our own fault that it was not removed.</P>
<P>Anatomi&s;ts have often remarked, that though our di&s;|ea&s;es are &s;ufficiently numerous and &s;evere, yet when we inquire into the &s;tructure of the body, the tenderne&s;s of &s;ome parts, the minutene&s;s of others, and the immen&s;e multiplicity of animal motions that mu&s;t concur to the healthful and vigorous exerci&s;e of all our powers, there appears rea&s;on to wonder rather that we are pre&s;erved &s;o long, than that we peri&s;h &s;o &s;oon, and that our frame &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts for a &s;ingle day, or hour, without di&s;order, rather than that it &s;hould be broken or ob&s;tructed by violence of accidents, or length of time.</P>
<P>The &s;ame reflection ri&s;es in my mind, when I ob&s;erve the manner in which marriage is &s;ometimes contracted. When I &s;ee the avaricious and crafty taking companions to their tables and their beds, without any inquiry but af|ter farms and money; or the giddy and thoughtle&s;s uniting for life to tho&s;e whom they have only &s;een by the light of tapers at a ball; when parents make contracts for their children, without inquiring after their con&s;ent; when &s;ome marry for heirs to di&s;appoint their brothers, and others throw them&s;elves into the arms of tho&s;e whom they do not love, becau&s;e they have found them&s;elves rejected where they were more &s;olicitous to plea&s;e; when &s;ome marry becau&s;e their &s;ervants cheat them, &s;ome becau&s;e they &s;quander their own money, &s;ome becau&s;e their hou&s;es are pe&s;tered with company, &s;ome becau&s;e they will live like other people, and &s;ome only becau&s;e they are &s;ick of them|&s;elves, I am not &s;o much inclined to wonder that marriage is &s;ometimes unhappy, as that it appears generally &s;o little loaded with calamity; and cannot but conclude, that &s;oci|ety has &s;omething in it&s;elf eminently agreeable to human

nature, when I find its plea&s;ures &s;o great, that even the ill choice of a companion can hardly overbalance them.</P>
<P>By the ancient cu&s;tom of the Mu&s;covites, the men and women never &s;aw each other, till they were united beyond the power of parting. It may be &s;u&s;pected that by this method many un&s;uitable matches were produced, and many tempers a&s;&s;ociated that were very little qualified to give plea&s;ure to each other. Yet, perhaps, among a people &s;o little delicate, where the paucity of objects, and the uniform|ity of life gave no opportunity for imagination to interpo&s;e its objections, there was not &s;o much danger of capricious di&s;like; and whil&s;t they felt neither cold nor hunger, they might live quietly together, without any thought of the defects of one another.</P>
<P>Among us, whom knowledge has made nice and afflu|ence wanton, there are, indeed, more cautions requi&s;ite to &s;ecure tranquillity; and yet if we ob&s;erve the manner in which tho&s;e conver&s;e, who have &s;ingled out each other for marriage, we &s;hall, perhaps, think that the Ruffians lo&s;t little by their re&s;traint. For the whole endeavour of both parties, during the time of court&s;hip, is to hinder them&s;elves from being known, and to di&s;gui&s;e their natural temper and real de&s;ires, in hypocritical imitation, &s;tudied compliance, and continued affectation. From the time that their love is avowed, neither &s;ees the other, but in a ma&s;k, and the cheat is managed often on both &s;ides with &s;o much art, and di&s;covered afterwards with &s;o much abruptne&s;s, that each has rea&s;on to think there has been &s;ome transformation on the wedding-night, and that by a &s;trange impo&s;ture one has been courted, and another mar|ried.</P>
<P>All, therefore, who come with matrimonial complaints, concerning their behaviour in the time of court&s;hip, are to be informed, that they are neither to wonder nor repine, that a contract begun with fraud has ended in di&s;ap|pointment.</P>

<HEAD>A RECENT and valuable Collection of Letters from a Father to his Son on various topics, relative to literature, and the conduct of life, offers to my readers a judicious and excellent Letter ON THE CHOICE OF A WIFE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is no &s;pecies of advice, which &s;eems to come with more peculiar propriety from parents to chil|dren, than that which re&s;pects the marriage &s;tate; for it is a matter, in which the fir&s;t mu&s;t have acquired &s;ome ex|perience, and the la&s;t cannot. At the &s;ame time, it is found to be that, in which advice produces the lea&s;t effect. For this, various cau&s;es may be a&s;&s;igned; of which, no doubt, the principal is, that pa&s;&s;ion commonly takes this affair under its management, and excludes rea&s;on from her &s;hare of the deliberation. I am inclined to think, however, that the neglect, with which admonitions on this head are treated, is not unfrequently owing to the manner in which they are given, which is often too general, too formal, and with too little accommodation to the feelings of young per&s;ons. If, in de&s;canting a little on this &s;ubject, I can avoid the&s;e errors, I flatter my&s;elf, you are capable of be&s;towing &s;ome unforced attention to what an affection|ate de&s;ire of promoting your happine&s;s, in &s;o e&s;&s;ential a point, may prompt.</P>
<P>The difference of opinion between &s;ons and fathers in the matrimonial choice, may be &s;tated in a &s;ingle po&s;ition&mdash; that the former have in their minds the fir&s;t month of marriage, the latter, the whole of its duration. Perhaps you will, and with ju&s;tice, deny, that this is the difference between us two, and will a&s;&s;ert, that you as well as I, in
<PB N="72" REF="031725_0071_0FEE1E467863F578">
thinking of this connexion, reflect on its la&s;ting con&s;e|quences. So much the better! We are then agreed as to the mode in which it is to be con&s;idered, and I have the advantage of you only in experience and more exten|&s;ive ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I need to &s;ay little as to the &s;hare, that per&s;onal charms ought to have in fixing a choice of this kind. Whil&s;t I readily admit, that it is de&s;irable, that the object, on which the eyes are mo&s;t frequently to dwell for a whole life, &s;hould be an agreeable one; you will probably as free|ly acknowledge, that more than this is of too fanciful and fugitive a nature, to come into the computation of permanent enjoyment. Perhaps in this matter I might look more narrowly for you, than you would for your&s;elf, and require a &s;uitablene&s;s of years and vigour of con&s;titu|tion, which might continue this advantage to a period that you do not yet contemplate. But dropping this part of the &s;ubject, let us proceed to con&s;ider the two main points, on which the happine&s;s to be expected from a female a&s;&s;ociate in life mu&s;t depend&mdash;her qualifications as a <HI>companion,</HI> and as a <HI>helper.</HI></P>
<P>Were you engaged to make a voyage round the world, on the condition of &s;haring a cabin with an unknown me&s;&s;mate, how &s;olicitous would you be, to di&s;cover his character and di&s;po&s;ition before you &s;et &s;ail! If, on in|quiry, he &s;hould prove to be a per&s;on of good &s;en&s;e and cultivated manners, and e&s;pecially of a temper inclined to plea&s;e and be plea&s;ed, how fortunate would you think your&s;elf! But if, in addition to this, his ta&s;tes, &s;tudies, and opinions, &s;hould be found conformable to yours, your &s;atisfaction would be complete. You could not doubt, that the circum&s;tance, which brought you together, would lay the foundation of an intimate and delightful friend&s;hip. On the other hand, if he were repre&s;ented, by tho&s;e who thoroughly knew him, as weak, ignorant, ob&s;tinate and quarrel&s;ome, of manners and di&s;po&s;itions totally oppo&s;ite to your own, you would probably rather give up your project, than &s;ubmit to live &s;o many months confined with &s;uch an a&s;&s;ociate.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="031725_0072_0FEE1E49E82849E8">Apply this compari&s;on to the dome&s;tic companion of the voyage of life&mdash;the intimate of all hours&mdash;the partaker of all fortunes&mdash;the &s;harer in pain and plea&s;ure&mdash;the moth|er and in&s;tructre&s;s of your offspring. Are you not &s;truck with a &s;en&s;e of the infinite con&s;equence it mu&s;t be of to you, what are the qualities of the heart and under&s;tanding of one who &s;tands in this relation; and of the compara|tive in&s;ignificance of external charms and ornamental ac|compli&s;hments? But as it is &s;carcely probable, that all you would wi&s;h in the&s;e particulars can be obtained, it is of importance to a&s;certain, which qualities are the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, that you may make the be&s;t compromi&s;e in your power. Now, ta&s;tes, manners, and opinions, being things not original, but acquired, cannot be of &s;o much con&s;e|quence as the fundamental properties of good &s;en&s;e, and good temper.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e, a wife, who loves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hu&s;band, will fa&s;h|ion her&s;elf in the others according to what &s;he perceives to be his inclination; and if, after all, a con&s;iderable diver&s;ity remain between them in &s;uch points, this is not incompatible with dome&s;tic comfort. But &s;en&s;e and temper can never be di&s;pen&s;ed with in the companion for life: they form the ba&s;is on which the whole edifice of happine&s;s is to be rai&s;ed. As both are ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential, it is needle&s;s to inquire which is &s;o in the highe&s;t degree. Fortunately, they are oftener met with together than &s;eparate; for the ju&s;t and rea&s;onable e&s;timation of things which true good &s;en&s;e in&s;pires, almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produces that equanimity and moderation of &s;pirit, in which good temper properly con&s;i&s;ts. There is, indeed, a kind of thoughtle&s;s good nature, which is not unfrequently coupled with weakne&s;s of under&s;tanding; but having no power of &s;elf-direction, its operations are capricious, and no reliance can be placed on it in promoting &s;olid felicity. When, however, this ea&s;y humour appears with the attractions of youth and beauty, there is &s;ome danger le&s;t even men of &s;en&s;e &s;hould overlook the defects of a &s;hallow capacity, e&s;pecially if they have entertained the too common notion, that women are no better than play things, de&s;igned rather for the amu&s;ement of their lords and ma&s;ters, than for the more &s;erious pur|po&s;es
<PB N="74" REF="031725_0073_0FEE1E52C0F8B3F8">
of life. But no man ever married a fool without &s;e|verely repenting it; for though the pretty trifler may have &s;erved well enough for the hour of dalliance and gaiety, yet when folly a&s;&s;umes the reins of dome&s;tic, and e&s;pecially of parental control, &s;he will give a perpetual heart-ache to a con&s;iderate partner.</P>
<P>On the other hand, there are to be met with in&s;tances of con&s;iderable powers of the under&s;tanding, combined with waywardne&s;s of temper, &s;ufficient to de&s;troy all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mfort of life. Malignity is &s;ometimes joined with wit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ghtine&s;s and caprice with talents, &s;ourne&s;s and &s;u&s;picion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th &s;agacity, and cold re&s;erve with judgment. But all the&s;e being in them&s;elves unamiable qualities, it is le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them. They generally render even beauty unattractive; and no charm but that of fortune is able to overcome the repugnance they excite. How much more fatal than even folly they are to all dome&s;tic felicity, you have probably already &s;een enough of the matrimonial &s;tate to judge.</P>
<P>Many of the qualities, which fit a woman for a com|panion, al&s;o adapt her for the office of a <HI>helper;</HI> but many additional ones are requi&s;ite. The original purpo&s;e for which this &s;ex was created, is &s;aid, you know, to have been, providing man with a <HI>help-mate;</HI> yet it is, perhaps, that notion of a wife which lea&s;t occupies the imagination in the &s;ea&s;on of court&s;hip. Be a&s;&s;ured, however, that as an office for life, its importance &s;tands extremely high to one, who&s;e &s;ituation does not place him above the want of &s;uch aid; and fitne&s;s for it &s;hould make a leading con&s;id|eration in his choice. Romantic ideas of dome&s;tic felicity will infallibly in time give way to that true &s;tate of things which will &s;hew, that a large part of it mu&s;t ari&s;e from well-ordered affairs, and an accumulation of petty comforts and conveniencies. A clean and quiet fire-&s;ide, regular and agreeable meals, decent apparel, a hou&s;e managed with order and economy, ready for the reception of a friend or the accommodation of a &s;tranger, a &s;kilful as well as affec|tionate nur&s;e in time of &s;ickne&s;s&mdash;all the&s;e things compo&s;e a very con&s;iderable part of what the nuptial &s;tate was de|&s;igned to afford us; and without them, no charms of per|&s;on
<PB N="75" REF="031725_0074_0FEE1E544D897C10">
or under&s;tanding will long continue to be&s;tow delight. The arts of hou&s;ewifery &s;hould be regarded as <HI>profe&s;&s;ional</HI> to the woman who intends to become a wife; and to &s;elect one for that &s;tation who is de&s;titute of them, or di&s;inclined to exerci&s;e them, however otherwi&s;e accompli&s;hed, is as ab&s;urd, as it would be to choo&s;e for your lawyer, or phy&s;i|cian, a man who excelled in every thing rather than in law, or phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>Let me remark, too, that knowledge and good-will are not the only requi&s;ites for the office of a helper. It demands a certain energy both of body and mind which is le&s;s fre|quently met with among the females of the pre&s;ent age than might be wi&s;hed. How much&s;oever infirm and delicate health may intere&s;t the feelings, it is certainly an unde&s;ira|ble attendant on a connexion for life. Nothing can be more contrary to the qualification of a help-mate, than a condition which con&s;tantly requires that a&s;&s;i&s;tance which it never can impart. It is, I am &s;ure, the farthe&s;t thing from my intention, to harden your heart again&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of pity, or &s;lacken tho&s;e &s;ervices of affectionate kindne&s;s, by which you may &s;often the calamitous lot of the mo&s;t amia|ble and de&s;erving of the &s;pecies. But a matrimonial choice is a choice for your own benefit, by which you are to obtain additional &s;ources of happine&s;s; and it would be mere folly, in their &s;tead voluntarily to take upon you new incumbrances and di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Akin to an unnerved frame of body, is that &s;hrinking timidity of mind, and exce&s;&s;ive nicety of feeling, which is too much encouraged under the notion of female delicacy. That this is carried beyond all rea&s;onable bounds in modern education, can &s;carcely be doubted by one, who con&s;iders what exertions of fortitude and &s;elf-command are continually required in the cour&s;e of female duty. One who views &s;ociety clo&s;ely, in its inte|rior as well as exterior, will know, that occa&s;ions of alarm, &s;uffering and di&s;gu&s;t, come much more frequently in the way of women than of men. To them belong all offices about the weak, the &s;ick, and the dying. When the hou&s;e becomes a &s;cene of wretchedne&s;s from any cau&s;e, the man often runs abroad, the woman mu&s;t &s;tay at home, and face the wor&s;t. All this takes place in cultivated &s;ociety, and
<PB N="76" REF="031725_0075_0FEE1E55D570E440">
in cla&s;&s;es of life rai&s;ed above the common level. In the &s;avage &s;tate, and in the lower conditions, women are com|pelled to undergo even the mo&s;t laborious, as well as the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable ta&s;ks. If nature, then, has made them &s;o weak in temper and con&s;titution as many &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he has not &s;uited means to ends with the fore&s;ight we generally di&s;cover in her plans.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s my&s;elf decidedly of the opinion of tho&s;e, who would rather form the two &s;exes to a re&s;emblance of char|acter, than contra&s;t them. Virtue, wi&s;dom, pre&s;ence of mind, patience, vigour, capacity, application, are not <HI>&s;exual</HI> qualities; they belong to mankind&mdash;to all who have duties to perform and evils to endure. It is &s;urely a mo&s;t de|grading idea of the female &s;ex, that they mu&s;t owe their in|fluence to trick and fine&s;&s;e, to counterfeit, or real weakne&s;s. They are too e&s;&s;ential to our happine&s;s to need &s;uch arts; too much of the plea&s;ure and the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world de|pends upon them, to give rea&s;on for apprehen&s;ion, that we &s;hall cea&s;e to join partner&s;hip with them. Let them aim at excelling in the qualities peculiarly adapted to the parts they have to act, and they may be excu&s;ed from affected languor and coquetry. We &s;hall not think them le&s;s ami|able for being our be&s;t helpers.</P>
<P>Having thus endeavoured to give you ju&s;t ideas of the principal requi&s;ites in a wife, e&s;pecially in a wife for one in your condition, I have done all that lies within the com|pa&s;s of an advi&s;er. From the influence of pa&s;&s;ion I can|not guard you: I can only deprecate its power. It may be more to the purpo&s;e, to di&s;&s;uade you from <HI>ha&s;ty engage|ments,</HI> becau&s;e in making them, a per&s;on of any re&s;olution is not to be regarded as merely pa&s;&s;ive. Though the head has lo&s;t its rule over the heart, it may retain its command of the hand. And &s;urely if we are to pau&s;e before any action, it &s;hould be before one, on which "all the colour of remaining life" depends. Your rea&s;on mu&s;t be con|vinced, that to form a &s;olid judgment of &s;o many qualities as are requi&s;ite in the conjugal union, is no affair of days and weeks, of ca&s;ual vi&s;its and public exhibitions. Study your object at <HI>home</HI>&mdash;&s;ee her tried in her proper depart|ment. Let the progre&s;s be, liking, approving, loving, and
<PB N="77" REF="031725_0076_0FEE1E575CDB15C0">
la&s;tly, declaring; and may you, after the experience of as many years as I have had, be as happily convinced, that a choice &s;o formed is not likely to deceive!</P>
<P>You may think it &s;trange, that I have not touched on a con&s;ideration, which generally takes the lead in parental e&s;timates of matrimonial views&mdash;that of <HI>fortune.</HI> But I have been treating on the <HI>woman</HI> only, not on any thing extraneous to her. Fortune acquired with a wife, is the &s;ame thing as fortune got any other way. It has its value, and certainly no &s;mall one, in procuring the de&s;irable com|forts of life; and to ru&s;h into a &s;tate, in which wants will be greatly increa&s;ed without a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of being able to &s;upply tho&s;e wants, is an act, not merely of care|le&s;sne&s;s, but of downright folly. But with re&s;pect to the &s;ources, whence their &s;upply is to be &s;ought, that is a par|ticular inquiry to each individual; and I do not think &s;o ill of your prudence, as to apprehend that you will not give it all the attention its importance demands. Another con&s;ideration, that of the <HI>family connexions</HI> formed by mar|riage, is of a &s;imilar kind. Its great importance cannot be doubted; but it is an affair to be determined on by the dictates of common prudence, ju&s;t as in forming tho&s;e connexions after any other mode; though, indeed, in no other can they be formed equally &s;trong. One who is ma&s;ter of his deliberations, may be tru&s;ted to decide the&s;e points, as well as any others that occur in the practice of life. That your deci&s;ions may always &s;hew you to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a due power of &s;elf-direction, is the earne&s;t wi&s;h of</P>

<HEAD>A Letter to a Lady on the Choice of a Hu&s;band.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU do me great honour in your application to me on this important occa&s;ion; I &s;hall therefore talk to you with the tenderne&s;s of a father, in gratitude for your giving me the authority of one. You do not &s;eem to make any great di&s;tinction between your two lovers as to their per&s;ons; the whole que&s;tion lies upon their circum&s;tances and behaviour: If the one is le&s;s re&s;pectful becau&s;e he is rich, and the other more ob&s;equious becau&s;e he is not &s;o, they are in that point moved by the &s;ame principle, the con|&s;ideration of fortune; and you mu&s;t place them in each other's circum&s;tances, before you can judge of their incli|nation. To avoid confu&s;ion in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this point, I will call the richer man STREPHON, and the other FLORIO. If you believe FLORIO with STREPHON's e&s;tate would be|have him&s;elf as he does now, FLORIO is certainly your man: but if you think STREPHON, were he in FLORIO's condition, would be as ob&s;equious as FLORIO is now, you ought for your own &s;ake to choo&s;e STREPHON; for where the men are equal, there is no doubt riches ought to be a rea&s;on for preference. After this manner, I would have you ab&s;tract them from their circum&s;tances; for you are to take it for granted, that he who is very humble only becau&s;e he is poor, is the very &s;ame man in nature with him who is haughty becau&s;e he is rich.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="031725_0078_0FEE1E61B5FE9DD8">When you have gone thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> far, as to con&s;ider the figure they make towards you; you will plea&s;e, Madam, next to con&s;ider the appearance you make towards them. If they are men of di&s;cernment, they can ob&s;erve the motives of your heart; and FLORIO can &s;ee when he is di&s;regarded only upon account of fortune, which makes you to him a mercenary creature: and you are &s;till the &s;ame thing to STREPHON, in taking him for his wealth only: you are therefore to con&s;ider whether you had rather confer than receive an obligation.</P>
<P>The marriage life is always an in&s;ipid, a vexatious, or an happy condition. The fir&s;t is, when two people of no genius or ta&s;te for them&s;elves meet together, upon &s;uch a &s;ettlement as has been thought rea&s;onable by parents and conveyancers, from an exact valuation of the land and ca&s;h of both parties: in this ca&s;e the young lady's per&s;on is no more regarded than the hou&s;e and improvements in pur|cha&s;e of an e&s;tate; but &s;he goes with her fortune, rather than her fortune with her. The&s;e make up the crowd or vulgar of the rich, and fill up the lumber of human race, without beneficence to tho&s;e below them or re&s;pect towards tho&s;e above them; and lead a de&s;picable, independent and u&s;ele&s;s life, without &s;en&s;e of the laws of kindne&s;s, good nature, mutual offices, and the elegant &s;atisfactions which flow from rea&s;on and virtue.</P>
<P>The vexatious life ari&s;es from a conjunction of two peo|ple of quick ta&s;te and re&s;entment, put together for rea&s;ons well known to their friends, in which e&s;pecial care is taken to avoid (what they think the chief of evils) poverty, and in&s;ure to them riches, with every evil be&s;ides. The&s;e good people live in a con&s;tant con&s;traint before company, and too great familiarity alone: when they are within ob|&s;ervation, they fret at each other's carriage and behaviour; when alone, they revile each other's per&s;on and conduct: in company they are in a purgatory, when only together in an hell.</P>
<P>The happy marriage is where two per&s;ons meet and voluntarily make choice of each other, without principally regarding or neglecting the circum&s;tances of fortune or beauty. The&s;e may &s;till love in &s;pite of adver&s;ity or &s;ick|ne&s;s;

the former we may in &s;ome mea&s;ure defend our&s;elves from; the other is the portion of our very make. When you have a true notion of this &s;ort of pa&s;&s;ion, your humour of living great will vani&s;h out of your imagination, and you will find love has nothing to do with &s;tate. Solitude, with the per&s;on beloved, has a plea&s;ure beyond &s;how or pomp. You are therefore to con&s;ider which of your lovers will like you be&s;t undre&s;&s;ed, which will bear with you mo&s;t when out of humour; and your way to this is to a&s;k your&s;elf, which you value mo&s;t for his own &s;ake; and by that judge which gives the greater in&s;tances of his valuing you for your&s;elf only.</P>
<P>After you have expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;en&s;e of the humble ap|proach of FLORIO, and a little di&s;dain at STREPHON's a&s;|&s;urance in his addre&s;s, you cry out, "What an unexcep|tionable hu&s;band could I make out of both!" It would therefore, methinks, be a good way to determine your&s;elf: take him in whom what you like is not transferable to an|other; for if you choo&s;e otherwi&s;e, there is no hopes your hu&s;band will ever have what you liked in his rival: but in|trin&s;ic qualities in one man may very probably purcha&s;e every thing that is adventitious in another. In plainer terms; he whom you take for his per&s;onal perfections, will &s;ooner arrive at the gifts of fortune, than he whom you take for the &s;ake of his fortune attain to per&s;onal per|fections. If STREPHON is not as accompli&s;hed and agree|able as FLORIO, marriage to you will never make him &s;o: but marriage to you may make FLORIO as rich as STRE|PHON: therefore, to make a &s;ure purcha&s;e, employ for|tune upon certainties, but do not &s;acrifice certainties to for|tune.</P>

<P>LOVE is a term &s;o very vague and indi&s;criminate, as it is generally applied, that it would be extremely difficult to inve&s;tigate its nature from its effects, in any other ca&s;e but that of marriage; as the modes, perhaps, of feeling, or at lea&s;t of expre&s;&s;ing it, vary, according to the temper, manner, or &s;ituation of each individual who ei|ther feels or feigns the pa&s;&s;ion. But conjugal affection is by no means &s;ubject to &s;uch equivocal appearances; it is tenderne&s;s heightened by pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;trengthened by e&s;teem; tending to promote the happine&s;s of its object here and hereafter.</P>
<P>Such an elevated &s;tate of happine&s;s as mu&s;t re&s;ult from the affection I have de&s;cribed, when mutual, mu&s;t &s;urely be the acm&eacute; of human felicity. But, as the point of perfection is that of declen&s;ion al&s;o, it will require much pains, (but they are plea&s;ing ones,) to make the ever-turning wheel of &s;ublunary bli&s;s keep &s;teady to the &s;ummit it has reached, or, at lea&s;t, to prevent its rolling down the rugged precipice, where jealou&s;y, di&s;gu&s;t and grief have marked the horrid road.</P>
<P>The di&s;appointments of human life mu&s;t ever be pro|portioned to the extravagance of our expectations. Too great an ardour to be ble&s;&s;ed, is frequently the &s;ource of mi&s;ery. A life of tran&s;port is not the lot of mortals. Whil&s;t we accept, we &s;hould cha&s;ti&s;e our joys, "le&s;t whil&s;t we cla&s;p we kill them."</P>
<P>That concord of &s;ouls which con&s;titutes the happine&s;s of marriage, like a full concert, requires all <HI>the parts obliged</HI> to fill their &s;everal &s;tations in perfect time and place;
<PB N="82" REF="031725_0081_0FEE1E6BD2717F20">
for though the heart may lead the band, and &s;et out in per|fect harmony, one jarring note de&s;troys the rapturous &s;train, and turns the whole to di&s;cord. For this rea&s;on I con&s;ider a parity of under&s;tanding and temper as nece&s;&s;ary towards forming an happy marriage.</P>
<P>But grant the&s;e circum&s;tances all conjoin and make the union perfect, my fair readers &s;hould remember, that &s;atiety &s;ucceeds to rapture, as &s;ure as night to day. Be it your province, then, to keep your hu&s;band's heart from &s;inking into the incurable di&s;ea&s;e of ta&s;tele&s;s apathy. Do not rely too much upon your per&s;onal charms, however great, to pre&s;erve the conque&s;t they may have gained. The kind|ne&s;s of your attention to the bent of his genius and incli|nations will awaken his regard; and gratitude will &s;trength|en his affection, imperceptibly even to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our fir&s;t Parent ju&s;tifies his fondne&s;s for Eve, to Ra|phael, upon this principle:</P>
<LG>
<L>"Neither her out&s;ide formed &s;o fair, &amp;c.</L>
<L>So much delights me, as tho&s;e graceful acts,</L>
<L>Tho&s;e thou&s;and decencies, that daily flow</L>
<L>From all her words and actions mixed with love,</L>
<L>And &s;weet compliance, which declare unfeigned</L>
<L>Union of mind, or in us both one &s;oul;</L>
<L>Harmony to behold in wedded pair,</L>
<L>More grateful than harmonious &s;ound to the ear."</L>
</LG>
<P>To &s;ecure the affections of a hu&s;band already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed in their favour; let the ladies but exert the &s;ame tal|ents, with the &s;ame de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, which they &s;hewed before marriage, and I venture to pronounce, that they will &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Every man ought to be the principal object of attention in his family; of cour&s;e he &s;hould feel him&s;elf happier at home than in any other place. It is, doubtle&s;s, the great bu&s;ine&s;s of a woman's life, to render his home plea&s;ing to her hu&s;band; he will then delight in her &s;ociety, and not &s;eek abroad for alien amu&s;ements. A hu&s;band may, po&s;|&s;ibly, in his daily excur&s;ions, &s;ee many women whom he thinks hand&s;omer than his wife; but it is generally her
<PB N="83" REF="031725_0082_0FEE1E6D59FFDE58">
fault, if he meet with one whom he thinks more amiable. A de&s;ire of plea&s;ing very rarely fails of its effect; but in a wife that de&s;ire mu&s;t be managed with the nice&s;t delica|cy; it &s;hould appear rather in the re&s;ult, than in the de|&s;ign; "not obvious, not obtru&s;ive." The&s;e little atten|tions are the be&s;t &s;upplement to our great duties, and ren|der the commerce of life delightful. Like an elegant de&s;|&s;ert, they complete the fea&s;t, and leave not a wi&s;h un&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>We have hitherto looked only on the plea&s;ing &s;ide of the tape&s;try, and &s;een Marriage in its mo&s;t favourable light. Let us now turn the canvas, and take a view of its defects.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, then, (what I think the wor&s;t of all &s;ituations,) an amiable young woman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the tender|e&s;t affection for her hu&s;band, whil&s;t he, from the depravity and incon&s;tancy of his nature, has withdrawn his love from her, and perhaps be&s;towed it on &s;ome unworthy object, to whom he devotes his time and fortune. In &s;uch a &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s, what line &s;hall our neglected wife pur&s;ue? The fir&s;t &s;tep that I would recommend to her, is, that of entering into a &s;erious, &s;trict, and impartial review of her own conduct, even to the minutiae of her dre&s;s, and the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of her looks, from the fir&s;t of her acquaintance with her hu&s;band. If, after &s;uch examination, &s;he cannot di&s;|cover any fault in her manners that might have given of|fence, or created di&s;gu&s;t, let her &s;teadily pur&s;ue the &s;ame behaviour &s;he has hitherto practi&s;ed; for, if that be totally free from error, it is impo&s;&s;ible that any alteration can give an additional efficacy to it. For to re&s;ent, or to retaliate, neither her duty, nor her religion will permit.</P>
<P>"To carry &s;miles upon the face, when di&s;content &s;its brooding at the heart," is, I confe&s;s, one of the mo&s;t diffi|cult ta&s;ks that can po&s;&s;ibly be impo&s;ed on an ingenuous and feeling &s;oul. But a thorough conviction that it is her pro|vince to endeavour to recal the wanderer back, for his own happine&s;s, as well as hers, and a certainty that there are no other means of accompli&s;hing &s;o de&s;irable an end, will enable her to pur&s;ue this arduous undertaking, till either her heart &s;hall rejoice in its &s;ucce&s;s, or, from reiter|ated di&s;appointments, become indifferent to the worthle&s;s object of its former e&s;teem and attention.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="031725_0083_0FEE1E6EE1C96618">Granting the la&s;t to be the ca&s;e, &s;he has a right to ex|pect the good opinion of the world will attend her conduct: but a higher and more certain reward awaits it; &s;elf-ap|probation, ari&s;ing from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having fulfilled her duty, and an a&s;&s;urance of having e&s;&s;ayed the only method that was likely to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s; for never yet was love recalled by lamentations, or upbraidings. The fir&s;t may &s;ometimes, perhaps, create pity, but oftener begets contempt; and the latter never did, nor can produce any pa&s;&s;ion but in&s;tant rage, or cool determined hate.</P>
<P>Recollection may furni&s;h to my fair Readers many in|&s;tances, where patient &s;ufferings have been rewarded with returning love; but I think there is &s;carcely one to be met with, where female violence has ever conquered male out|rage; or where di&s;&s;ipation and coquetry, though they may have alarmed the pride, ever reclaimed the alienated affec|tions of a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>True love, like true virtue, &s;hrinks not on the fir&s;t at|tack; it will bear many &s;hocks before it be entirely van|qui&s;hed. As it contends not for victory, but for the prize; it will not di&s;play it&s;elf in the vain arts of elocution, but in the more powerful eloquence of action; it will leave nothing undone, that can prove its &s;incerity; but it will not boa&s;t, even to its object, of what it has done; much le&s;s will it vaunt its merits to any other confidant, or com|plain to the world of the unkind return it has experienced.</P>
<P>There is &s;uch a variety of circum&s;tances which may di&s;turb the happine&s;s of the marriage &s;tate, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;pecify them all; but as a virtuous woman will con&s;ider the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band's affection as the greate&s;t calamity that can befal her, her duty and prudence will, before the evil happens, upon every occa&s;ion &s;upply rules of conduct to her&s;elf; and the reliance &s;he will nece&s;&s;a|rily have upon the tenderne&s;s of his attachment to her, joined to the &s;incerity of hers to him, will &s;upport her through every difficulty, which accident, misfortune, or even imprudence, may have brought upon them. She will &s;ay, with Prior's Emma,

<P>This is the natural language of conjugal affection, this the fulfilling of the marriage vow, where &s;elf is lo&s;t in a &s;till dearer object, where tenderne&s;s is heightened by di&s;|tre&s;s, and attachment cemented even by the tears of &s;or|row.

<P>IT has been ju&s;tly remarked, that a parity of temper is one of the principal requi&s;ites in matrimonial happi|ne&s;s; and yet it is po&s;&s;ible, that too great a &s;imilarity of di&s;po&s;ition may, in &s;ome ca&s;es, render both parties wretch|ed. For in&s;tance, if two per&s;ons of a gay and carele&s;s turn of mind &s;hould happen to be united, both will think them&s;elves entitled to pur&s;ue their joint, or &s;eparate amu&s;e|ments, without being encumbered with any attention to dome&s;tic economy, till even the nece&s;&s;ary means for their &s;upport may be irretrievably lavi&s;hed away.</P>
<P>Again, &s;hould two per&s;ons of a &s;aturnine complexion be joined in the indi&s;&s;oluble bond of marriage, the natural gloomine&s;s of their di&s;po&s;itions will be increa&s;ed by each other's conver&s;e; melancholy will become habitual, and care be heightened by de&s;pondency.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Not minds of melancholy &s;train,</L>
<L>Still &s;ilent, or that &s;till complain,</L>
<L>Can the dear bondage ble&s;s;</L>
<L>As well may heavenly concerts &s;pring</L>

<L>In bands of cheerful wedlock dwell,</L>
<L>With firebrands tied between."</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="87" REF="031725_0086_0FEE1E7AC930C0B0">From the&s;e examples it is obvious, that a &s;imilitude of di&s;po&s;itions alone, though a &s;trong incentive to affection, will not always in&s;ure matrimonial felicity. And yet I am perfectly convinced, that wherever there is any mate|rial difference of &s;entiments, or manners, there never was, nor will be, a happy marriage. We naturally admire tho&s;e we love, and as naturally imitate what we admire. The &s;imilarity that ari&s;es from conformity, and a de&s;ire to plea&s;e, has a &s;uperior charm to that which is m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ely com|plexional. To adopt the &s;entiments of a per&s;on is the mo&s;t delicate proof of approbation and e&s;teem; and per|haps the compliment is valued by our &s;elf love, in propor|tion to the &s;acrifice which has been made of an oppo&s;ite way of thinking.</P>
<P>That conformity of manners, as far as religion and rea&s;on will permit, is one of the indi&s;pen&s;able duties of a wife, will not, I believe, be denied by any one. But there are ladies, who have an art of letting their <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ion</HI> appear too &s;trongly in the act, as if &s;ubmitting to the impo&s;itions of a tyrant, rather than cheerfully fulfilling the obligation they had entered into at the altar&mdash;to <HI>love, honour,</HI> and <HI>obey.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame words, or actions, expre&s;&s;ed or performed in a gracious or ungracious manner, may produce effects as different as Love, and Hate. I would, therefore, recom|mend it to the candidates for happine&s;s in the marriage &s;tate, to <HI>&s;acrifice to the Graces,</HI> in their conjugal demeanor, as &s;incerely as they do at their toilets; for good breeding is as nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of dome&s;tic harmony, as it can po&s;&s;ibly be to the general intercour&s;e and commerce of life.</P>
<P>SOLOMON, in his de&s;cription of a virtuous woman, has furni&s;hed us with the fine&s;t idea that ever was given, of a wife's addre&s;s to her hu&s;band. "She openeth her mouth with wi&s;dom, and in her tongue is the law of kind|ne&s;s." And &s;urely there exi&s;ts not a being, under the form of man, who could reject &s;uch an addre&s;s with &s;corn or in&s;olence. Ladies &s;hould, however, take par|ticular care to <HI>time</HI> their conver&s;ation with their hu&s;bands, and neither idly obtrude upon their &s;erious hours of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, or retirement, nor ha&s;tily mi&s;take that re&s;erve or gloom,
<PB N="88" REF="031725_0087_0FEE1E8002CF15F0">
which may ari&s;e from difficulties in their affairs, abroad, for ill temper, or di&s;gu&s;t, at home.</P>
<P>It is the duty of a wife, not only to regulate her own Temper towards her hu&s;band, but al&s;o to pay &s;uch an atten|tion to his, as may prevent it from ever appearing in a di&s;a|greeable light. By &s;tudiou&s;ly ob&s;erving the proper &s;ea&s;ons for the different &s;ubjects, on which &s;he may have occa&s;ion to addre&s;s him, &s;he may, imperceptibly to him, and almo&s;t to her&s;elf, obtain the power of guiding his concurrence, or denial.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;ible and virtuous woman, pur&s;uing &s;uch a line of conduct for the mutual advantage of her hu&s;t and and fam|ily, without any &s;elfi&s;h views, of which only little minds are capable, comes neare&s;t to the idea that mortals are taught to conceive of a Guardian Angel, who, un&s;een, di|rects our doubtful choice to what is be&s;t, and leads our err|ing &s;teps into the paths of happine&s;s and peace.</P>
<P>I have hitherto con&s;idered this great article of Temper only in one point of view, merely as it relates to the collo|quial intercour&s;e between a wedded pair. I come now to &s;hew, that its influence is univer&s;ally exten&s;ive; and that it is one of the main &s;prings which guides, or deranges the hu|man machine, through every &s;tation and &s;ituation of life. An unmarried woman is very rarely &s;aid to be ill temper|ed; and yet there are &s;uch prodigies in nature as <HI>young</HI> vixens, who, however they may conceal their ill humour from their lovers and general acquaintances, will &s;urely be|tray it to their parents, inmates, and &s;ervants. "A little lump leaveneth the whole," and a peevi&s;h maiden will in|fallibly make a cro&s;s wife; for, when once a &s;ourne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition becomes habitual, there is no alkaline in na|ture &s;ufficiently powerful to correct the heart-burnings and bitterne&s;s of a di&s;&s;atisfied Temper. A per&s;on &s;o affected, like one infected with the plague, nece&s;&s;arily &s;preads the contagion of di&s;content around her. Her parents lament the badne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition; her other relations and connex|ions are &s;en&s;ible of aver&s;ion, in&s;tead of affection, towards her; and her &s;ervants regret, that the irk&s;omene&s;s of &s;ervi|tude is aggravated by receiving their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from a ty|rant, whom they can neither plea&s;e, re&s;pect, nor love.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="031725_0088_0FEE1E8189F8CF88">As gravity, which is &s;ometimes but another name for dulne&s;s, has been frequently mi&s;taken for wi&s;dom, &s;o is cheerfulne&s;s often accepted for good humour. But that &s;pecies of cheerfulne&s;s which we meet with in &s;ociety, that laughs in the eye, and lights up the countenance, generally proceeds, rather from an ebullition of the &s;pirits, than a de|&s;igned and con&s;i&s;tent exertion of our powers to plea&s;e; and is more frequently the re&s;ult of a lively than a placid di&s;po&s;ition. As it flows from an accidental cau&s;e, its effects mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be precarious; it is, therefore, &s;ubject to cau&s;ele&s;s and &s;udden dejection, to which habitual good hu|mour is by no means liable.</P>
<P>Di&s;tinct as the&s;e two qualities are, they have yet one prop|erty common to both, and at the &s;ame time different from what can be imputed to any other happy endowment; which is, that they are mo&s;t meritorious where they are lea&s;t nat|ural. An ideot may be con&s;titutionally good humoured, and a villain be cheerful, from a glow of health or a flow of &s;pirits; but that &s;pecies of good humour which is the re&s;ult of &s;en&s;e, virtue, and gratitude to Providence, will be vniform in its appearance, and con&s;i&s;tent in its manners: it will not, like an April day, lower and &s;hine in the &s;ame moment; nor, like the flaming heats of July, will the brightne&s;s of the meridian &s;un foretel the approaching thun|der; but clear, calm and undi&s;turbed, &s;hall it &s;hine on even to its late&s;t hour.</P>
<P>Such a ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate of mind mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily communi|cate the happine&s;s it feels to all around it. "Like the &s;mooth &s;tream, it reflects every object in its ju&s;t proportion, and in its faire&s;t colours; whil&s;t the turbulent and ruffled &s;pirit, like troubled waters, renders back the images of things di&s;torted and broken, and communicates to them all that di&s;ordered motion, which ari&s;es &s;olely from its own agitation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Blair.</NOTE></P>
<P>This beautiful &s;imile has a double claim to female atten|tion; for rage, jealou&s;y, or any other ungentle pa&s;&s;ion, de|form the faire&s;t face almo&s;t as much as they degrade the mind, and can "un&s;ex the lovelie&s;t of the lovely kind, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en from the top to toe."</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="031725_0089_0FEE1E8503A18CD8">But there is a higher and &s;tronger motive than I have yet mentioned for "po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our &s;ouls in gentlene&s;s," if we pre&s;ume to call our&s;elves Chri&s;tians. Shall the di&s;ci|ple of a &s;uffering Saviour dare to re&s;ent with furious out|rage the real, or imaginary injuries &s;he may receive? Or can &s;he kneel before the throne of mercy, and &s;upplicate the GOD of peace and good-will to man, for pardon or protection, whil&s;t her heart is agitated with a &s;pirit of mal|ice or revenge towards a fellow-creature, frail as her wretched &s;elf? This were an in&s;ult upon piety, a mockery of devotion!</P>
<P>We are a&s;&s;ured, that GOD rejects the proud, and that an humble and a contrite heart is precious in his &s;ight. Shall we then ca&s;t away the heart-felt tran&s;port of thinking our|&s;elves under the guidance and protection of an Almighty Providence, to &s;acrifice to Moloch? and give away the birth-right of the redeemed, for the &s;ad privilege of tortur|ing our&s;elves? For Providence has wi&s;ely ordained, that all the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions of the human brea&s;t &s;hould prey upon their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Peace never dwelt with envy, rage, or hate.</P>
<P>As marriage, among Chri&s;tians, is of divine in&s;titution, all married per&s;ons &s;hould con&s;ider a proper conduct to|wards each other, as the fulfilling of a religious duty. To promote harmony, peace, order, and happine&s;s in their families, is the mutual and undoubted obligation both of man and wife. This rule once e&s;tabli&s;hed and reduced to practice, even libertines will own, that marriage is the happie&s;t &s;tate on earth; but when the fiends of di&s;cord, rage, confu&s;ion, and mi&s;ery, u&s;urp the place of <HI>tho&s;e</HI> dear hou&s;ehold gods, their very oppo&s;ites, we mu&s;t agree with Dr. Tillot&s;on, and own, that &s;uch a &s;tate is but "a le&s;s hell, in pa&s;&s;age to the greater."</P>
<P>Be it your care then, my gentle and much intere&s;ted Readers, to rever&s;e this &s;ad idea, and by the mildne&s;s of your manners, and the &s;weetne&s;s of your tempers, render the marriage &s;tate a le&s;s heaven, in pa&s;&s;age to the greater.</P>

<P>IN the variety of cour&s;es which the generality of mankind pur&s;ue for the attainment of happine&s;s, it is not a lit|tle &s;urpri&s;ing, that &s;o many of them &s;hould be inattentive in one of the mo&s;t material<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">points, that can po&s;&s;ibly in&s;ure it. The point I mean is, that union of the &s;exes, which, properly concluded, is the foundation of felicity to indi|viduals, and of &s;ecurity to the public. Nature has given every parent the power of directing the inclinations of their children, but allows of no unrea&s;onable authority to force them; and &s;uch as have a &s;en&s;ible concern for the happine&s;s of their offspring &s;hould be particularly careful, that a reciprocal pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the parties, be|fore they con&s;ented to an inviolable union. The ill-di|rected tenderne&s;s of parental affection has often been pro|ductive of the mo&s;t unhappy con&s;equences; and many a father has made his children mi&s;erable for life, by an er|roneous &s;olicitude for their welfare, and by making a pro|vi&s;ion for their happine&s;s which was not in the lea&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial, and for which they had not, in all probability, any manner of occa&s;ion.

<P>I AM the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men; and notwith&s;tand|ing it might be more prudent to conceal the cau&s;e of my affliction, I find an inclination to di&s;clo&s;e it in this public manner too &s;trongly to be re&s;i&s;ted. I am a young fellow of five and twenty, neither deformed in my per&s;on, nor, I hope, unhappy in my temper: my fortune is ea&s;y, my education liberal; and, I &s;uppo&s;e, I am as well calculated to pa&s;s in a crowd as the generality of my acquaintance.</P>
<P>About twelve months ago I fell pa&s;&s;ionately in love with a young lady, who&s;e beauty and merit entitled her
<PB N="92" REF="031725_0091_0FEE1E8BBB998D98">
to a rank much more exalted than I could rai&s;e her to, though &s;he was much my inferior in point of fortune. She was at that time courted by a young gentleman in the law; and matters had actually gone &s;o far, that a day was appointed for the &s;olemnization of the nuptials. All this I was very well informed of; yet, impetuou&s;ly hurried by the violence of my pa&s;&s;ion, I di&s;clo&s;ed it to the father. He was a man of the world&mdash;my circum&s;tances were much better than his intended &s;on-in-law's; and he paid a le&s;s attention to the happine&s;s, than he &s;hewed for the advancement of his daughter. Why &s;hould I take up your time, Sir? Maria's match with her former lover was immediately broken off; and the unhappy young lady, who never pre&s;umed to di&s;obey her father's com|mands, was torn from the man of her heart, and married to one &s;he could never love.</P>
<P>I was in hope, Sir, that a little time, and a tender be|haviour on my &s;ide, as a man never loved more fondly than my&s;elf, would have utterly era&s;ed Mr. Bridgegrove from the bo&s;om of my wife, and placed me in his &s;tead. But had I not been be&s;otted with my love, I might have ea&s;ily known, that a laudable impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind of a &s;en&s;ible woman is never to be eradicated: no, it is utter|ly impo&s;&s;ible. When a young raw girl, indeed, entertains &s;omething like a regard for a man, without knowing the rea&s;on of her e&s;teem, it is nothing but a &s;truggle of de&s;ire; or, more properly &s;peaking, the wheyine&s;s of inclination, which, in a little time, &s;he laughs at her&s;elf, and, as &s;he grows in under&s;tanding, ea&s;ily &s;kims off. But, where a woman of &s;en&s;e has placed her affections on a man of merit, the pa&s;&s;ion is never to be era&s;ed; the more &s;he ponders on his worth, the more rea&s;on &s;he has to love him; and &s;he can never cea&s;e to think of his perfections, till &s;he is wholly dive&s;ted of thought.</P>
<P>Unhappily for me, this was the ca&s;e. Mr. Bridgegrove, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole heart of Maria, and, in reality, de&s;erv|ed it: he is, perhaps, the mo&s;t amiable of men, and, poor fellow, loves her to di&s;traction.</P>
<P>I have been now married ten months, and have, I flatter my&s;elf, expre&s;&s;ed every act of tenderne&s;s proper
<PB N="93" REF="031725_0092_0FEE1E90F00672E8">
for the lover or the hu&s;band to no purpo&s;e. My wife be|haves with the utmo&s;t complai&s;ance, is uncommonly &s;olic|itous to plea&s;e; but this conduct is the effect of her good &s;en&s;e, and not the con&s;equence of her love. The little endearing intercour&s;es between hu&s;band and wife are &s;uf|fered, not enjoyed; if I complain of her coldne&s;s, &s;he a&s;&s;umes an air more gay, and affects to be plea&s;ed, though I &s;ee the &s;tarting tear ju&s;t bur&s;ting from her eye, and know the grief that rankles at her heart. Nay, the more I ca|re&s;s, the more mi&s;erable &s;he is made; and I &s;ee her gen|erou&s;ly lamenting that &s;he cannot place her heart upon the man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es her hand, and is not utterly unworthy of her e&s;teem. O! Sir, he mu&s;t have no delicacy, no feel|ing, that can bear a circum&s;tance like this unmoved. How am I frequently torn to madne&s;s with reflection, even when I have her fa&s;tened to my bo&s;om, to think her whole &s;oul is at that very moment running on another man. In her &s;leep &s;he frequently throws one of her fine arms round my neck, and pronounces the name of Bridge|grove in a manner that di&s;tracts me.</P>
<P>Our little boy, (for &s;he is lately brought to bed) in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing, is another &s;ource of anxiety to us both. I overheard her, ye&s;terday morning, weeping over the child, and crying&mdash;'My &s;weet boy, poor Bridgegrove &s;hould have been your father.'&mdash;Can any &s;ituation be &s;o afflicting as mine?&mdash;I have made the mo&s;t amiable of women for|ever wretched, and torn a worthy young fellow from the mi&s;tre&s;s of his heart. I have brought all my &s;orrows on my&s;elf, with the di&s;tre&s;sful con&s;ideration of having no right to complain. I de&s;erve to be mi&s;erable. The man, who would meanly hope to be happy in marriage, by &s;acrificing the inclination of the woman he loves, and ungenerou&s;ly lo&s;es every regard to her wi&s;hes, whil&s;t he endeavours to gratify his own, has no preten&s;ion to felicity. Had I never obtained the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Maria, I &s;hould not have been half &s;o wretched as I am now: time, and another object would, perhaps, have enabled me to bear her lo&s;s: &mdash;but now, ma&s;ter of her per&s;on, to find another in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart, and to know, that there is one whom &s;he holds con&s;iderably dearer than my&s;elf, are con|&s;iderations
<PB N="94" REF="031725_0093_0FEE1E92777B2FA0">
ab&s;olutely in&s;upportable. I cannot dwell any longer on the &s;ubject: I &s;hall therefore conclude with an advice to my own &s;ex, never to marry a woman, who&s;e heart they know is engaged, nor to take a pitiful advan|tage of a father's authority in oppo&s;ition to her inclination. If &s;he be a good woman, &s;he can never forget her fir&s;t choice, and if &s;he be bad, will inevitably bring &s;hame and &s;candal on the &s;econd.</P>

<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent letter from a female corre&s;pondent &s;trongly marks her good &s;en&s;e and virtue, exhibits a ju&s;t e&s;timation of female dignity, and merits the particu|lar attention of the young and inexperienced among my fair readers. Conviction and reformation may po&s;&s;ibly follow its peru&s;al among &s;ome of my own &s;ex, who are guilty of addre&s;&s;ing the vanity of women, to gain a com|pliance with their infamous wi&s;hes.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"GREAT an oppo&s;ition as there &s;eems between van|ity and meanne&s;s, yet, if we take but ever &s;o cur&s;ory a view of the world, we &s;hall find them to be pretty general companions, and &s;carcely meet a &s;ingle in&s;tance, in which there can be di&s;covered any &s;hadow of exception. Among my own &s;ex particularly, Sir, vanity is the parent of &s;o many meanne&s;&s;es, that I am actually &s;urpri&s;ed, when we endeavour to give our&s;elves the mo&s;t con&s;equence, that we never perceive how we forfeit all the dignity we ju&s;t be|fore po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and in the ridiculous attempt of arrogating our own importance, leave our&s;elves, in &s;hort, without any real importance at all.</P>
<P>"This is never more the ca&s;e, Sir, than when we li&s;ten to the &s;olicitations of your &s;ex; and for the &s;ake of a de&s;|picable compliment to our teeth or complexion, overlook the unpardonable affront which it generally conveys, and take no notice of the very poor opinion it in&s;inuates, both for the purity of our hearts, and the goodne&s;s of our un|der&s;tandings. We &s;uffer the mo&s;t illiberal addre&s;&s;es to be paid us, if they are but &s;oftened with the words Angel and Godde&s;s; and admit a de&s;igning villain as often as he plea&s;es into our pre&s;ence, though we know our ruin and di&s;grace are the only objects of his pur&s;uit, if he but prai&s;es the colour of our hair, and tells us that we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="96" REF="031725_0095_0FEE1E9D1DE8F798">
of finer eyes than the re&s;t of our acquaintances. In &s;hort, Sir, we are willing a man &s;hould think there is a probabil|ity of our launching into infamy and pro&s;titution, for the &s;ake of hearing our per&s;ons commended; and perfectly reconciled, whil&s;t he treats us on a footing with the hand|&s;ome&s;t women he may know, to his thinking, that in time he &s;hall number us with the very wor&s;t.</P>
<P>"A woman, Sir, whenever &s;he is told of her beauty with a grave face, &s;hould fir&s;t of all con&s;ider the purpo&s;e for which &s;he may be addre&s;&s;ed in this manner, and reflect upon the motive which may actuate the per&s;on who pro|fe&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;o &s;en&s;ible of her perfections. Nothing is more dangerous than to &s;uffer continued repetitions of this &s;tyle; it gradually becomes more and more plea&s;ing to the ear; and there is, be&s;ides, too natural a promptitude in the female mind to think favourably of tho&s;e who &s;eem to think pa&s;&s;ionately of us. A language of this nature, therefore, &s;hould be highly alarming to our ears; for many a woman, who thought her&s;elf impregnable, has, in a length of time, grown &s;o enamoured of her own prai&s;e, that &s;he could not po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t without the per&s;on who admini&s;tered it, and has at la&s;t &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion; when, had &s;he fir&s;t of all capitulated on terms, &s;he might have in&s;i&s;ted on the very be&s;t.</P>
<P>"Let us only reduce the general tendency of modern ad|dre&s;&s;es into plain Engli&s;h, and a&s;k the mo&s;t indi&s;creet of the &s;ex, if they can, in their con&s;cience, di&s;cover them to be a jot better than this&mdash;'Madam, I look upon you as a fool, and one whom I have a &s;trong inclination to make a &s;trumpet; for which rea&s;on I intend to talk continually of your charms, and, by &s;acrificing in that manner to your vanity, I have no doubt but, in a few days, I &s;hall bring you to an utter di&s;regard of morality and virtue, to an ab|&s;olute contempt of all the laudable &s;entiments which you have been imbibing &s;o many years, and a total indifference for your own reputation, and the honour of your &s;ex. As I think your wickedne&s;s equal to your folly, I beg, when I mention the word <HI>Beauty,</HI> that you will prefer the grati|fication of the man, who is your greate&s;t enemy, to the peace of tho&s;e who are your unalterable friends; nor he&s;i|tate
<PB N="97" REF="031725_0096_0FEE1E9EA6F8E5F0">
a moment to break the heart of a parent that tenderly loves you, to plea&s;e an infamous &s;coundrel who labours for your everla&s;ting di&s;grace. In &s;hort, Madam, I expect, in return for a paltry compliment to your per&s;on, that you &s;cruple not to endure continual &s;hame in this world, nor &s;hrink at hazarding your eternal happine&s;s in the next; but run at once to plunge a dagger into the brea&s;t of your father, and hurl an impious defiance at the very throne of your GOD.'</P>
<P>"I had my&s;elf, Sir, lately two or three lovers, who kindly &s;aid very pretty things to my per&s;on; and, would you be|lieve it, that one of them was a married man?&mdash;This gen|tleman came one day with all the ea&s;y impudence in life, and, with as much compo&s;ure as if he had been really per|forming a meritorious action, threw him&s;elf at my feet, and &s;wore he could not live unle&s;s I pitied him. Had I a dagger, I believe I &s;hould have &s;tuck it in the villain's heart: however, a&s;&s;uming all the anger that I po&s;&s;ibly could, in a face not naturally the mo&s;t placid, I men|tioned &s;ome thoughts of paying a vi&s;it to his wife, which effectually bani&s;hed him from my pre&s;ence, without doing the &s;malle&s;t injury to his health, or di&s;turbing in the lea&s;t the u&s;ual &s;erenity of his temper.</P>
<P>"A gentleman of family and fortune next told me, that I was the mo&s;t angelic piece of fle&s;h and blood he had ever beheld; and &s;olicited, in good earne&s;t, that I would ble&s;s him with my favourable opinion; but I had no &s;oon|er talked of &s;ome of the privileges which a Wife would naturally expect, than the truly honourable lover &s;neaked in&s;tantly off, excu&s;ing him&s;elf on account of a treaty then in agitation with Mi&s;s Betty Squander.</P>
<P>"What you men think of us, I know not; nor indeed can I conceive what we women in general conceive of our&s;elves; but of this I am ab&s;olutely certain, that whil&s;t we continue &s;o intolerably vain, we mu&s;t be liable to an infinity of meanne&s;&s;es; and that the &s;ure&s;t way for any woman to be undone, and to lo&s;e all chance of obtaining a virtuous worthy companion in the nuptial &s;tate, is to think there is nobody comparable to her&s;elf."</P>

<P>THERE is a &s;entiment in Mr. Coleman's comedy of the Jealous Wife, with which I am not a little plea&s;ed, as it is no le&s;s an indication of a benevolent heart than a &s;ound under&s;tanding. <HI>Harriot</HI> reproaching young <HI>Oakley</HI> on account of his extraordinary attachment to the bottle; the lover, &s;en&s;ibly &s;truck with the ju&s;tice of the reproof, exclaims, that "were all ladies alike attentive to the morals of their admirers, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rtine would be an un|common character."</P>
<P>If we take but ever &s;o &s;light a view of the &s;exes, we &s;hall find the behaviour of the one to depend &s;o entirely upon the opinion of the other, that was either to &s;et about a reformation, the amendment of both would be ea&s;ily effected; and tho&s;e virtues would be immediately cultiva|ted through the prevalence of fa&s;hion, which neither the force of conviction, the dread of temporary misfortune, nor the terrors of everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, are now &s;ufficient to &s;teal upon our practice, even whil&s;t they engage our veneration.</P>
<P>As the ladies in general are more affected by the prev|alence of immorality than the men, it often &s;urpri&s;es me, that they do not endeavour to look tho&s;e vices out of coun|tenance among our &s;ex, which are &s;o frequently fatal to their own tranquillity. A man, through the e&s;tabli&s;hment of cu&s;tom, con&s;iders it as infamous to marry a pro&s;titute, to connect him&s;elf with a drunkard, or to pay his addre&s;&s;es to a woman, who&s;e lips are continually fraught with in|decency or execration. Though accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to the midnight exce&s;&s;es of the &s;tew, yet, when he fixes for
<PB N="99" REF="031725_0098_0FEE1EA1B7FE84B8">
life, he inquires into the character of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and pro&s;ecutes his &s;uit in proportion as &s;he is eminent for her virtues. Whereas the lady, though bred up all her life in the &s;tricte&s;t delicacy, often expre&s;&s;es no repugnance what|&s;oever to venture with the mo&s;t public betrayer of inno|cence, the mo&s;t open enemy of mankind, and the mo&s;t daring defier of his GOD.</P>
<P>What, however, is mo&s;t extraordinary on the&s;e occa&s;ions, is the facility with which a father u&s;ually contracts his daughter to a libertine; as if, becau&s;e cu&s;tom did not in|volve her in the infamy of his character, his habitual pro|pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y to vice mu&s;t not nece&s;&s;arily endanger her happine&s;s. For my own part, I am &s;hocked when I &s;ee a parent le&s;s regardful of a daughter's felicity than attentive to the welfare of a &s;on. Is there a father, who would per&s;uade his &s;on into a marriage with a pro&s;titute profe&s;&s;ed? I hope not. Why, then, is his daughter &s;o relentle&s;sly &s;acrificed to a libertine? Is there not as much danger for the one to be mi&s;erable with her hu&s;band, as the other to be wretch|ed with his wife? And &s;ince the natural claim to paternal indulgence is equal between each, mu&s;t it not be highly in|equitable to treat the fir&s;t with &s;uch an exce&s;s of partiality?</P>
<P>I am in&s;en&s;ibly led into this &s;ubject from a peru&s;al of &s;ome &s;ermons, addre&s;&s;ed to young women. In one of the Author's di&s;cour&s;es, where female virtue is the object of con&s;ideration, he gives &s;o admirable a le&s;&s;on to the &s;ex, on account of this unhappy approbation with which the very be&s;t women &s;o frequently honour a profligate lover, that I cannot but tran&s;cribe it for the benefit of my amia|ble readers.</P>
<P>"HOW common is it to &s;ee young ladies, who pa&s;s for women of reputation, admitting into their company in public places, and that with vi&s;ible tokens of civility and plea&s;ure, men, notorious for herding with creatures of in|famous name! What a defiance to the laws of piety, pru|dence, character, decorum! what an in&s;ult, in effect, to every man and woman of virtue in the world! what a palpable encouragement to vice and di&s;honour! what a de&s;perate pulling down, in appearance, and with their own
<PB N="100" REF="031725_0099_0FEE1EEC010060D0">
hands, of the only partition that divides them from the mo&s;t profligate of their &s;ex! Between the bold, and the abandoned woman there may &s;till remain, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch behaviour, a di&s;tinction in the world's eye; but we &s;cruple not to declare, that religion, purity, delicacy, make none.</P>
<P>"To return from this digre&s;&s;ion, if it be one, we will al|low it po&s;&s;ible to put ca&s;es wherein no particular rules of di&s;covery, no determinate modes of judgment, will enable a young woman, by her own una&s;&s;i&s;ted &s;kill, to di&s;cern the dangers that lie in her way. But can a young woman be ju&s;tly excu&s;ed, or can &s;he fairly excu&s;e her&s;elf, if, where all is at &s;take, &s;he calls not in the joint aid of wi&s;e &s;u&s;pi|cion, friendly coun&s;el, and grave experience, together with prayers for GOD's protection more than ordinarily fervent?</P>
<P>"But, methinks, I hear &s;ome of you a&s;k, with an air of earne&s;t curio&s;ity&mdash;"Do not reformed rakes, then, make the be&s;t of hu&s;bands?&mdash;I am &s;orry for the que&s;tion; I am doubly &s;orry, whenever it is &s;tarted by a virtuous woman. I will not wound the ear of mode&s;ty by drawing minutely the character of a rake; but give me leave to an&s;wer your inquiry, by a&s;king a que&s;tion or two in my turn.</P>
<P>"In the fir&s;t place, we will &s;uppo&s;e a man of this char|acter actually reformed, &s;o far as to treat the woman he marries with every mark of tenderne&s;s, e&s;teem, fidelity; and that he gives up forever his old companions, at lea&s;t as to any cho&s;en intimacy, or preference of their company to hers. We grant it po&s;&s;ible; we rejoice when it hap|pens. It is certainly the be&s;t atonement that can be made for his former conduct. But now let me a&s;k you, or rather let me de&s;ire you to a&s;k your own hearts, without any regard to the opinions of the world, which is the mo&s;t de&s;irable on the &s;core of &s;entiment, on the &s;core of that re&s;pect which you owe to your&s;elves, to your friends, to your &s;ex, to order, rectitude, and honour; the pure un|exhau&s;ted affection of a man, who has not by intemperance and debauchery corrupted his principles, impaired his con|&s;titution, en&s;laved him&s;elf to appetite, &s;ubmitted to &s;hare with the vile&s;t and meane&s;t of mankind the mercenary
<PB N="101" REF="031725_0100_0FEE1EACCFBACF48">
embraces of harlots, contributed to embolden guilt, to harden vice, to render the retreat from a life of &s;candal and mi&s;ery more hopele&s;s; who never laid &s;nares for beauty, never betrayed the innocence that tru&s;ted him, never abandoned any fond creature to want and de&s;pair, never hurt the reputation of a woman, never di&s;turbed the peace of families, or defied the laws of his country, or &s;et at naught the prohibition of his GOD;&mdash;which, I &s;ay, is mo&s;t de&s;irable, the affection of &s;uch a man, or that of him, who has probably done all this, who has certainly done a great part of it, and who has nothing now to offer you, but the &s;hattered remains of his health, and of his heart? How any of you may feel on this &s;ubject, I can|not &s;ay. But if, judging as a man, I believed, what I have often heard, that the generality of women would prefer the latter, I know not any thing that could &s;ink them &s;o low in my e&s;teem.</P>
<P>"That he who has been formerly a rake may after all prove a tolerable good hu&s;band, as the world goes, I have &s;aid already that I do not di&s;pute. But I would a&s;k, in the next place, is this commonly to be expected? Is there no danger, that &s;uch a man will be tempted, by the power of long habits, to return to his old ways? or that the in|&s;atiable love of variety, which he has indulged &s;o freely, will &s;ome time or other lead him a&s;tray from the fine&s;t woman in the world? Will not the very idea of re&s;traint, which he could never brook whil&s;t &s;ingle, make him only the more impatient of it when married? Will he have the better opinion of his wife's virtue, that he has chiefly con|ver&s;ed with women who had none, and with men among whom it was a favourite &s;y&s;tem, that the &s;ex are all alike? &mdash;But it is a painful topic. Let the women who are &s;o connected make the be&s;t of their condition; and let us go on to &s;omething el&s;e."</P>

<P>THE Author of this Collection is happy to believe, that the &s;entiments of the E&s;&s;ay contained in this Num|ber are directed again&s;t a very &s;mall portion of the &s;ons of COLUMBIA. Few of us have imbibed, or profe&s;&s;ed to ad|vocate, that irrational prejudice again&s;t the matrimonial &s;tate which is prevalent among the European votaries of plea&s;ure. In the UNITED STATES, more ju&s;t and hon|ourable ideas of the female &s;ex, and of conjugal life, are probably cheri&s;hed among all ranks of the citizens, than in any other region of the globe.</P>
<P>But as there are a few of this cla&s;s &s;cattered among us, he would recommend to their &s;erious peru&s;al the &s;ub&s;e|quent ob&s;ervations, highly momentous to their per&s;onal happine&s;s, and the pre&s;ervation of &s;ocial order; and he ardently hopes, that they will not be read without pro|ducing an immediate conviction and renunciation of their error, and re&s;toring them to the path of virtue and peace.</P>
<P>"IT is a privilege with the greate&s;t number of tho&s;e people, who entertain a high notion of their own wit, to rail forever at the only in&s;titution, upon which the happi|ne&s;s of &s;ociety is founded; and to pour out an ince&s;&s;ant torrent of ridicule upon poor matrimony, though they owe their own exi&s;tence to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that &s;acred or|dinance. The motive, indeed, which the generality of our libertines a&s;&s;ign for this aver&s;ion from marriage is, that the ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e is a re&s;traint upon all their other enjoyments; and that the moment a man devotes him&s;elf to one woman, that moment he is obliged, not only to alter the
<PB N="103" REF="031725_0102_0FEE1EB1EEF1FD78">
former tenor of his conduct, but to put up with every pet|ulance of the lady's temper, however unrea&s;onable &s;he may be in her reque&s;ts, or however arbitrary &s;he may be in the exerci&s;e of her authority.</P>
<P>"For my own part, I have yet &s;een but few women who rule with an improper authority over their hu&s;bands; nor can I entertain any high notions of the man's under&s;tanding, who once makes it a doubt, whether or not he &s;hould be able to maintain that connubial pre-eminence in his own family, which he receives from the hand of rea&s;on, and the cu&s;tom of his country. If he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es but a dawn of &s;en&s;e, the object of his choice will be &s;uch, as can give him no cau&s;e to apprehend any turbulence of di&s;po&s;ition; and if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es but a dawn of &s;pirit, he will alway have it in his power to prevent any di&s;agreeable exertion of it, even in ca&s;e he &s;hould be unhappily deceived.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ante&s;t argument of all, however, is the nece&s;&s;i|ty which a married man is under of for&s;aking all tho&s;e en|joyments, which, whil&s;t he was a bachelor, created the principal part of his felicity. Yet, &s;urely, if tho&s;e enjoy|ments are repugnant to rea&s;on, the &s;ooner he for&s;akes them the better, &s;ince it never can be too early a period to regain the paths of di&s;cretion and virtue; and if they are not oppo&s;ite to the dictates of prudence, he mu&s;t be a very pu&s;illanimous fellow indeed, who could once dream of giv|ing them up., In fact, tho&s;e men are always for finding fault with the poor women, who are con&s;cious of imper|fections in them&s;elves; whereas men of &s;en&s;e, being deter|mined to proceed upon a rational plan, are con&s;tantly de|&s;irous of doing ju&s;tice to the merit of the ladies, and never prepo&s;terou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;e, that they are de&s;titute either of benevolence or under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>"The general run of our libertines, though they are much too &s;en&s;ible, and much too &s;pirited to put up with any impropriety in the behaviour of a worthy woman, nev|erthele&s;s &s;ubmit with the greate&s;t cheerfulne&s;s imaginable to any treatment which a woman of the town thinks prop|er to give them, and ble&s;s their &s;tars with a kind of rap|ture, that they are not hu&s;bands. This is, in plain En|gli&s;h, they rejoice that they are not obliged by the laws

of their country to bear a merited reproach from the lips of a de&s;erving wife, though the narrowne&s;s of their minds, and the ba&s;ene&s;s of their &s;pirits can induce them &s;o readily to put up with the mo&s;t impudent airs of a de&s;picable &s;trumpet, and to crouch with an infamous &s;ervility at her feet.</P>
<P>"Sam Squander is a melancholy proof of this a&s;&s;ertion. Sam, at the age of twenty, came into an affluent fortune, and launched into all the licentious di&s;&s;ipations, which gen|erally captivate young men of opulent circum&s;tances. Fearful that his plea&s;ures, if folly and vice may be called plea&s;ures, would be manacled by the &s;ilken bands of wed|lock, he declared him&s;elf an early enemy to marriage; and has continued to a late hour, without even wi&s;hing to ta&s;te the &s;weets of a dome&s;tic felicity. Yet, though aver&s;e from an honourable connexion with the &s;ex, he could not exi&s;t without &s;ome feminine attachment.</P>
<P>"Attentive therefore to the mere gratifications of &s;en&s;e, he &s;ingled out a favourite nymph of ea&s;y virtue, took her publickly to his hou&s;e, and has cohabited with her now above thirty years. A more ungovernable termagant prob|ably never lived; yet Sam is quite happy he is not marri|ed. She has more than once been detected in an amour with his footman; but what of that? Sam put up with it; &s;he was not his wife. If &s;he throws a gla&s;s at his head, which is &s;ometimes the ca&s;e, or confines him within doors for a fortnight, it is no matter. Sam is &s;till happy, and laughs at any of his acquaintances who go home at twelve o'clock, for fear of making their wives unea&s;y by a longer ab&s;ence from their families. One thing, indeed, makes him mi&s;e|rable. He has two &s;ons by this infamous woman, of whom he is pa&s;&s;ionately fond; and the reflection, that his e&s;tate mu&s;t go into another line for want of a legitimate offspring, is a circum&s;tance which renders him con&s;tantly unhappy, even in his fortunate &s;tate of bachelor&s;hip: &s;o that I believe, if the truth were known, Sam is &s;ecretly of opinion with me, that a good wife is the fir&s;t of all the hu|man felicities; and that the greate&s;t of all fools is he, who puts up with the numberle&s;s vices of a profligate woman, through a fear of meeting &s;ome natural imperfections in a woman of intrin&s;ic merit and character.</P>

<P>I CONTEMPLATE, with the mixed emotions of plea&s;ure and awe, the period of wedding. The mo|ment approaches, in which two rational beings are to have their union cemented by ties, indi&s;&s;oluble except by the &s;troke of death.</P>
<P>A pure friend&s;hip, a &s;incere affection are nece&s;&s;ary pre|paratives for the endearing relation. The reciprocal gift of the hand is indicative of a mutual exchange of kindred &s;ouls, impelled to each other by virtuous love. If the love be not virtuous; if mere per&s;onal beauty, worldly emol|ument, or the gro&s;&s;er pa&s;&s;ions, excite to enter upon the connubial &s;tate, its bli&s;s will be tran&s;ient, and vanity will be in&s;cribed on the future pro&s;pects of life.</P>
<P>I have long cheri&s;hed an exalted idea of the purity of the female mind, where it has been poli&s;hed and refined by a &s;uitable education. I believe, that the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ofter &s;ex towards their lovers is generally pure and cha&s;te. I am per&s;uaded, that a virtuous woman offers a degree of violence to the delicacy of her own feelings, by con|&s;enting to be the property, even of the mo&s;t meritorious hu&s;|band. It mu&s;t, then, be ungenerous to wound her mode&s;|ty by any indecencies of &s;peech upon the occa&s;ion of her marriage. An innocent hilarity may ju&s;tly prevail among the company a&s;&s;embled at its celebration. Every friendly bo&s;om mu&s;t beat with joy, at the idea of the enlargement of human happine&s;s. But <HI>double entendres</HI> and every &s;pecies of loo&s;e language &s;hould be invariably excluded, as offering an

<P>The &s;ub&s;equent hi&s;tory of the nuptials of a young gen|tleman of &s;entiment and an amiable lady, as contained in that ingenious periodical work, THE BABLER, offers it|&s;elf as a very in&s;tructive commentary on our &s;ubject; and I hope, that it will have a &s;alutary effect on the mind of every reader.</P>
<P>"MY favourite nephew. Harry had for &s;ome time conceived a pa&s;&s;ion for Mi&s;s Cornelia Marchmont, whom I e&s;teem as the ab&s;tract of every mental perfection, and every per&s;onal accompli&s;hment. He came to me, not long &s;ince, with an air of the greate&s;t tran&s;port, and informed me, that Mi&s;s Marchmont had ble&s;&s;ed him with the ac|knowledgement of a reciprocal e&s;teem, and that I was the per&s;on, whom &s;he had pitched upon, to open a negociation between the two families.</P>
<P>"As I do not know any young lady exi&s;ting who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a greater &s;hare of my e&s;teem than Mi&s;s Marchmont, nor ever &s;aw a per&s;on &s;o immediately calculated to make my nephew happy, I &s;hook him cordially by the hand, wi&s;hed him joy from the bottom of my heart, and in&s;tant|ly &s;et out to my &s;i&s;ter, his mother. Luckily, on my en|trance, I found Mr. Marchmont, Cornelia's father, chatting with her at the parlour fire; and, as he and I have been intimately acquainted for many years, I opened the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of my errand without any ceremony, and this the more e&s;pecially, becau&s;e I knew neither could have any rea&s;onable objection to the match. Every thing turned out as I expected; both were rejoiced at the affection be|tween the young people; and there being no mighty mat|ters to retard the celebration of the nuptials, I thought it be&s;t to make &s;hort work of the affair, and accordingly fix|ed the wedding at an early day. The propo&s;ition being approved by the parent of each, I retired to make Harry happy with the intelligence; and in pur&s;uance of the agree|ment, I &s;aw him ble&s;&s;ed with one of the worthie&s;t as well as &s;weete&s;t girls in the univer&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="031725_0106_0FEE1EC1926077C0">As I look upon a wedding to be one of the mo&s;t impor|tant calls which either of the &s;exes have in their whole lives for the exertion of an extraordinary delicacy, I was not a little attentive to the behaviour of my two favourites; and it gave me great plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve, upon the whole, that Harry's behaviour was manly, tender, and re&s;pectful, without deviating into that ful&s;ome di&s;agreeable fondne&s;s, of which even men of the be&s;t &s;en&s;e are often guilty, when they have ju&s;t obtained the woman of their heart. As to Cornelia, I never &s;aw a young creature in her &s;ituation conduct her&s;elf with more propriety: to all the dignity of con&s;cious virtue, &s;he joined all the ineffable &s;weetne&s;s of an engaging timidity; and, though &s;he &s;eemed proud of the man, whom &s;he had ju&s;t preferred to all the world, yet &s;he had too much &s;en&s;ibility not to feel &s;ome amiable terrors, at &s;o awful an alteration in her circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>"After the performance of the ceremony, at which a large company was pre&s;ent, Harry judiciou&s;ly propo&s;ed an unremitting round of amu&s;ements, which entirely employ|ed the attention even of the mo&s;t volatile, and prevented the circulation of tho&s;e indelicate ambiguities, with which occa&s;ions of this kind are frequently di&s;graced. So that our mirth was, as it ought to be, mingled with good &s;en&s;e and manners; and of cour&s;e the harmony could be little liable to interruption, whil&s;t that harmony was regulated by rea&s;on and civility.</P>
<P>"I have been often &s;hocked, at the &s;olemnization of a marriage, to &s;ee the ridiculous, I had almo&s;t &s;aid the prof|ligate, levity with which people have approached the altar of the Divine Being, and je&s;ted with one another at the in&s;tant of &s;upplicating a ble&s;&s;ing from his hand.</P>
<P>"One would imagine, that if the friends of the married couple had even no veneration for the Deity, they would at lea&s;t have &s;ome little &s;hare of politene&s;s; and be actu|ated by a tender concern for the feelings of the lady, if they felt no awe what&s;oever in the pre&s;ence of their GOD. A woman of any &s;en&s;ibility, on her wedding, mu&s;t natur|ally be in circum&s;tances &s;ufficiently embarra&s;&s;ed, without hearing any illiberal plea&s;antries from the company to en|hance the difficulties of her &s;ituation. When &s;he con|&s;iders,
<PB N="108" REF="031725_0107_0FEE1EC3199AD328">
that the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of her life materially depends upon the choice which &s;he has then made, &s;he has cau&s;e enough for terror; and when &s;he con&s;iders the priv|ilege which is &s;hortly to be claimed by the object of that choice; when &s;he con&s;iders, that the delicate re&s;erve, in which &s;he has all her life been brought up, is in an in&s;tant to be &s;acrificed to his inclination; I &s;ay, when all the&s;e things are con&s;idered, nothing can be more in&s;olent, or indeed more cruel, than to aggravate her di&s;tre&s;s by the practice of any improper jocularities.</P>
<P>"People, I am &s;en&s;ible, are &s;trangely attached to old cu&s;toms; but every cu&s;tom &s;hould be aboli&s;hed, which is in the lea&s;t repugnant to rea&s;on and civility; on which account I flatter my&s;elf the reader will give a proper at|tention to this &s;ubject, and correct the error of which I have here been &s;peaking, as far as he is able, in the circuit of his acquaintance."</P>

<P>IT is much to be regretted, that &s;o few married per&s;ons have their mutual attachment <HI>&s;trengthened,</HI> by the lap&s;e of time and the intercour&s;e of years. Such in&s;tances, however, would not be rare, if tho&s;e who &s;u&s;tain this in|timate relation aimed, through life, to plea&s;e, and to cher|i&s;h and di&s;play the gentle virtues which adorn humanity. Beauty, youth, or riches, unaccompanied with the&s;e vir|tues, have not the power of preventing tho&s;e indecent &s;al|lies of the mind, which, at certain unguarded &s;ea&s;ons, too &s;ucce&s;sfully di&s;play them&s;elves, to the extinction of the finer feelings of love and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The hu&s;band and the wife mu&s;t endeavour to appear mutually amiable, with the &s;ame &s;edulity, which they manife&s;t to gain the e&s;teem of others. Their &s;ituation requires mutual conde&s;cen&s;ions, and a temper, which &s;hall ri&s;e &s;uperior to every pa&s;&s;ion or &s;entiment, ho&s;tile to conjugal union. They &s;hould e&s;teem them&s;elves as friends embarked, in one common indi&s;&s;oluble inter|e&s;t, on a &s;ea liable to tempe&s;ts; through which, how|ever, their fragile bark, by mutual unremitted atten|tions, may be &s;afely conducted to the port of peace. Such voyagers will a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly divide and mitigate the labours and fatigues to which adver&s;e &s;torms expo&s;e them, and enjoy, with innocent hilarity, and glowing gratitude to Heaven, the gentler breezes, and enlivening pro&s;pects of their pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>We venerate, we readily applaud the hallowed affection of &s;uch mortals. We prize their company and conver&s;e. Every benevolent bo&s;om &s;hares their bli&s;s by &s;ympathy. The language of &s;uch congenial &s;ouls is more gladdening than the &s;ofte&s;t &s;trains of mu&s;ic to tho&s;e, who have learnt
<PB N="110" REF="031725_0109_0FEE1ECBE77931B0">
to "rejoice with them that rejoice." For readers of this generous cla&s;s I have provided a rich &s;entimental fea&s;t in an epi&s;tolary addre&s;s, written by the celebrated Author of Fitzo&s;borne's Letters, and directed to his CLEORA, on the &s;ixth anniver&s;ary of their nuptials.</P>
<P>"THOUGH it was not po&s;&s;ible for me to celebrate with you, as u&s;ual, that happy anniver&s;ary which we have &s;o many rea&s;ons to commemorate; yet I could not &s;uffer &s;o joyful a fe&s;tival to pa&s;s by me without a thou&s;and tender reflections. I took plea&s;ure in tracing back that &s;tream to its ri&s;e, which has coloured all my &s;ucceeding days with happine&s;s; as my Cleora, perhaps, was at that very in&s;tant running over in her own mind tho&s;e many moments of calm &s;atisfaction, which &s;he has derived from the &s;ame &s;ource.</P>

The truth, believe me, is; though both the company and the &s;cene wherein I am engaged are extremely agreeable, yet I find a vacancy in my happine&s;s, which none but you can fill up. Surely tho&s;e who have recommended the&s;e little &s;eparations as nece&s;&s;ary to revive the languor of the married &s;tate, have ill under&s;tood its mo&s;t refined gratifications: THERE IS NO SATIETY IN THE MUTUAL EXCHANGE OF TENDER OFFICES.</P>
<P>"There &s;eems to have been a time, when a happine&s;s of this kind was con&s;idered as the highe&s;t glory, as well as the &s;upreme bli&s;s of human life. I remember, when I was in Italy, to have &s;een &s;everal conjugal in&s;criptions up|on the &s;epulchral monuments of ancient Rome, which, in&s;tead of running out into a pompous panegyric upon the virtues of the decea&s;ed, mentioned &s;ingly, as the mo&s;t &s;ig|nificant of encomiums, how many years the parties had lived together in full and uninterrupted harmony. The Romans, indeed, in this, as in many other in&s;tances, af|ford the mo&s;t remarkable examples; and it is an ob|&s;ervation of one of their writers, that, notwith&s;tanding di|vorces might very ea&s;ily be obtained among them, their re|public had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted many centuries before there was a &s;ingle in&s;tance of that privilege ever having been exerted.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, my Cleora, however unfa&s;hionable I may appear in the pre&s;ent generation, I might have been kept in countenance in a former, and by tho&s;e too, who had as much true gallantry and good &s;en&s;e as one u&s;ually meets with in this. But affections which are founded in truth and na|ture &s;tand not in need of precedent to &s;upport them; and I e&s;teem it my honour no le&s;s than my happine&s;s, that I am, &amp;c."</P>
<P>To this epi&s;tle of the amiable Melmoth, I &s;hall &s;ubjoin a &s;hort account, taken from the Scots Magazine of 1768, of an attachment uncommonly tender, between the Bi&s;hop of Lucon in France, who flouri&s;hed about the middle of the pre&s;ent century, and a Madame de Rouvraie. Though the laws of the Romi&s;h church forbad their marriage,
<PB N="113" REF="031725_0112_0FEE1ED25C955260">
yet the hi&s;tory of their affection may be viewed as con|genial with the leading &s;entiments of this Number; and as pre&s;enting a bright pattern of pure con&s;tant love to per&s;ons, who find no impediment to the mo&s;t intimate relation.</P>
<P>"THE bi&s;hopric of Lu&ccedil;on is near Rochfort, and one of tho&s;e, which, being di&s;tant from the metropolis, may be called a rich one, as, in proportion to the revenue, all provi&s;ion is &s;o amazingly cheap. I take the liberty to mention this as my rea&s;on why his Lord&s;hip was able to do &s;uch munificent acts in his life-time.</P>
<P>"From his taking the gown he had a &s;incere affection for Madame de Rouvraie, who was of a very noble family, but one among the almo&s;t innumerable in&s;tances in France, of high blood, without the proper means to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>"The Abb&eacute; Didoyard, though with no income at fir&s;t, but what his genius and abilities, joined to uncommon in|du&s;try, could produce, ever &s;upported her as a gentle|woman. He taught mu&s;ic, to &s;ing, to paint in crayons and water-colours, be&s;ide giving lectures in the different &s;ciences; and all to repleni&s;h the pur&s;e of Madame de Rouvraie.</P>
<P>"He now obtained an advancement in the church; &s;he of cour&s;e advanced with him: but he took care always to board her in &s;uch pious and regular families, that envy it&s;elf (and that quicke&s;t of all, the envy of her own &s;ex) never could fix a &s;tain on his or her character.</P>

independent, and having early declared that he was an enemy to tran&s;lations, he &s;et him&s;elf down quietly on this provi&s;ion; and Madame de Rouvraie appeared with that rank and lu&s;tre her merits &s;o well de&s;erved.</P>
<P>"He built an elegant &s;eat for her within a league of his palace, and fixed it in the middle of a &s;pacious park.

<P>"A few months before the unfortunate expedition to Rochfort, the Bi&s;hop died, and many of the Engli&s;h officers, then pri&s;oners, were witne&s;&s;es of the univer&s;al grief which &s;pread all over that country, for the lo&s;s of the mo&s;t pious Chri&s;tian, &s;incere friend, good pa&s;tor, and fine gentleman that ever France, or any other country, has produced.</P>

<Q><L>Our thoughtle&s;s &s;ex is caught by outward form,</L>
<L>And empty noi&s;e, and loves it&s;elf in man.</L>
<BIBL>DRYDEN.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, to which the frailty and weakne&s;s of man &s;ubject him, there is not any that extends &s;uch a boundle&s;s and de&s;potic empire over the whole &s;pecies as that of Love. The meek, the mild, and the humble are &s;trangers to envy, anger, and ambition; but neither the malicious, the choleric, or the proud can &s;ay, their hearts have been always free from the power of love. This has &s;ubdued the exalted minds of the mo&s;t a&s;piring tyrants, and has melted the mo&s;t &s;anguine complexion into an effeminate &s;oftne&s;s. An undaunted hero has been known to tremble, when he approached the fair; and the mighty Hercules let fall his club at a woman's feet. The &s;cholar, the &s;tate&s;man, and the &s;oldier have all been lov|ers; and the mo&s;t ignorant &s;wain has neglected both his flocks and pipe to woo Daphne or Sylvia.</P>
<P>But though love be a pa&s;&s;ion thus common to all, yet how widely do its votaries differ in their manner of addre&s;s! The plea&s;ing enjoyment of the admired object is what they all pur&s;ue; and yet few agree in the &s;ame methods of obtaining their ends, or accompli&s;hing their de&s;ires. Eve|ry lover has his particular whim, and each re&s;olves to fol|low his own way.</P>
<P>But of all the arts which have been practi&s;ed by the men on the other &s;ex, I have not ob&s;erved any kind of addre&s;s, which has been &s;o generally &s;ucce&s;sful as flattery. Whether it be, that, by making a woman in love with her&s;elf, you thereby engage her to love the per&s;on who makes her &s;o; (as, who would not be fond of the cau&s;e which produces &s;o agreeable an effect?) or whether her partiality and &s;elf-love does the more readily induce her to believe, that all the prai&s;e given is really due to her merit; or whatever other rea&s;on may be a&s;&s;igned for this
<PB N="117" REF="031725_0116_0FEE1EDFFAC8FEF8">
weakne&s;s; I &s;hall not now inquire. This, like a &s;ubtle poi&s;on, in&s;inuates it&s;elf almo&s;t into every female. Like a delicious cordial, it meets with an acceptance and appro|bation too univer&s;al; whil&s;t &s;incerity and plain-deal|ing are treated as nau&s;eous and di&s;gu&s;tful phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be &s;aid, that we love the trea&s;on, and yet hate the traitor. But &s;he mu&s;t be a woman of uncom|mon virtues and qualifications, who can &s;o nicely di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the gift, and the giver, as to refu&s;e the one, and yet receive the other. Few of the &s;ex think flattery a vice, and therefore they cannot be per&s;uaded to di&s;like a lover for being a courtier. Though they may be con|&s;cious of &s;ome of their own imperfections, yet if their ad|mirers be not quick-&s;ighted enough to di&s;cern them, they are willing to impute their blindne&s;s to their love, nay, though &s;ome defects be gro&s;sly vi&s;ible even to the lover; yet if he will compliment his mi&s;tre&s;s with that which &s;he really wants, I dare appeal to the whole &s;ex, whether, in many in&s;tances, &s;uch incen&s;e or the offerer of it be one jot nearer the lo&s;ing of their favour, and whether they are not too generally delighted with both the delu&s;ion and the de|ceiver. But if they really believe them&s;elves as amiable as the flatterer repre&s;ents them, then, in point of gratitude they conclude them&s;elves obliged to think kindly of their bene|factor. I &s;hall conclude this paper with a &s;tory, which I know to be fact.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Witwou'd</HI> was a young gentlewoman of good ex|traction, and an hand&s;ome fortune. She was exactly &s;hap|ed, and very pretty. She dre&s;&s;ed and danced genteely, and &s;ung &s;weetly. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e advantages, &s;he had a predominant attachment to the reputation of a wit. She fancied that &s;he had as much wit as &s;he wanted, (though indeed &s;he wanted more than ever &s;he will have) and this conceit made her fond of &s;cribbling and &s;hewing her follies that way, as taking great delight in applau&s;e.</P>
<P>My friend <HI>Meanwell</HI> is a gentleman of good &s;en&s;e and a &s;ound judgment: he is a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to flattery, and is of opinion, that to commend without ju&s;t grounds, is to rob the meritorious of that, which only of right belongs to them. He &s;ays, a compliment is a modi&s;h lie; and declares, that he
<PB N="118" REF="031725_0117_0FEE1EE52DB95668">
would not be guilty of &s;o much ba&s;ene&s;s as to cry up a beauti|ful fool for wit, not even in her own hearing, though he were &s;ure to have his fal&s;ehood rewarded by the enjoyment of his mi&s;tre&s;s. Unmerited applau&s;e is to him an argument of want of judgment, or of in&s;incerity; and he re&s;olves, that he will never attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h another's reputation at the expen&s;e of his own. With the&s;e hone&s;t u&s;ele&s;s qualities he has made long but fruitle&s;s court&s;hip to young Mi&s;s Witwou'd.</P>
<P><HI>Ned Courtly</HI> is a new but violent pretender to the &s;ame lady. Ned is a &s;hallow well-dre&s;&s;ed coxcomb. He was bred genteely, and is of a graceful and confident behaviour, tempered with civility. The &s;hallow thing can wait at a di&s;tance, look at her, and then with a &s;mile approach her, and &s;ay&mdash;'You are divinely pretty.' He is al&s;o remark|ably happy in particular di&s;coveries; and whenever he renews a vi&s;it to his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he is &s;ure to be pre&s;ented with &s;ome additional charm, which would forever have lain concealed, had not Ned mo&s;t luckily have explored it. Ned quickly perceived Mi&s;s Witwou'd's weak &s;ide, and carefully watched all opportunities of making his advan|tage of it. Mi&s;s grows enamoured of Ned's company, and begins to de&s;pi&s;e Meanwell as an unpoli&s;hed clown. She likes Ned as &s;he likes her gla&s;s, and for the &s;ame rea|&s;on, that it always &s;hews her her beauties; and &s;he takes as much plea&s;ure in hearing him, injudiciou&s;ly as he does it, give her al&s;o the beauties of her mind, as &s;he does to &s;ee the gla&s;s reflect tho&s;e of her body. One evening, lately, Meanwell had the honour of &s;upping with her. The cloth being taken away, &s;he delivered him a copy of ver&s;es, which &s;he &s;aid had been the product of her lei&s;ure hours, and de&s;ired the opinion of &s;o good a judge. My friend had the patience to read them twice over, found nothing extra|ordinary in them, and &s;milingly returned them with a &s;ilent bow. He was ju&s;t about to &s;peak his mind impartially, when in came <HI>Ned Courtly.</HI> He peru&s;ed and hummed them over in a &s;eeming rapture; looked at the lady, and then at the paper, for almo&s;t half an hour, in full admira|tion; and then, with a better air than ever critic &s;poke, he pronounced, that the author of tho&s;e ver&s;es had Congreve's
<PB N="119" REF="031725_0118_0FEE1EE8A0E40B40">
wit, and Waller's &s;oftne&s;s, and that there was nothing &s;o completely perfect in all their works.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence was, Meanwell was di&s;carded, becau&s;e he would be rigidly hone&s;t in trifles; and Ned made his mi&s;tre&s;s his wife, becau&s;e, in &s;pite of nature, he allowed her to be a poete&s;s; or perhaps very ju&s;tly, becau&s;e he re|ally thinks her &s;o.</P>

<P>TO my female readers, particularly to tho&s;e who are ju&s;t entering, or have newly entered, into the conjugal &s;tate, I commend the peru&s;al of a letter addre&s;&s;ed by a la|dy to her young friend, upon her marriage.</P>
<P>"I ADDRESS my&s;elf &s;ingly to you, my dear Ger|trude, becau&s;e the delicacy of your pre&s;ent &s;ituation de|mands my &s;erious attention, and calls up all my tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>"I am inexpre&s;&s;ibly plea&s;ed, to find you have made choice of &s;o worthy a man as Mr. Fitzgerald and that your parents approve the object of your &s;election. I think you have acted like a woman of &s;en&s;e and prudence, and I make no doubt, but you will pre&s;erve the &s;ame propriety of conduct when a wife, as has evidently characterized you whil&s;t &s;ingle. I admire that real delicacy, which impelled you to give an immediate di&s;mi&s;&s;ion to all tho&s;e pretenders, who &s;olicited your hand without being able to influence your heart in their favour. There cannot be a more de&s;|picable pa&s;&s;ion, than that in&s;atiable thir&s;t for admiration, which leads a woman to encourage indi&s;criminately the forward advances of every coxcomb, who &s;hall pay her the incen&s;e of flattery; and to be continually &s;preading her lures to attract adulation, however in her heart &s;he may de&s;pi&s;e the per&s;on who offers it.</P>
<P>"I am &s;en&s;ible my dear Gertrude will pardon me, if, anxious for her future happine&s;s, I venture to give her my advice and opinion for the pre&s;ervation of her felicity in the married &s;tate.</P>
<P>"It has often been remarked, that a heart is much ea&s;ier gained than kept; and, believe me, it is a very judicious ob&s;ervation. There requires more care, attention, and &s;oli|citude, from the wife to the hu&s;band, than from the mi&s;tre&s;s to the adoring lover. The lover being but &s;eldom with you, &s;ees you only in part. It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, you would neither appear before him in a &s;latternly dre&s;s, or with
<PB N="121" REF="031725_0120_0FEE1EF1315D0238">
a peevi&s;h a&s;pect. Your clothes will be always put on with neatne&s;s, and your face dre&s;&s;ed in &s;miles. On the con|trary, the hu&s;band, being always in your company, has an opportunity of di&s;covering every little defect or blemi&s;h in your per&s;on, manners, or di&s;po&s;ition; and the chief &s;tudy of a wife &s;hould be, to guard again&s;t every thing that might create di&s;ta&s;te, or excite di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>"In the fir&s;t place, let me recommend a mo&s;t &s;crupu|lous regard to delicacy and neatne&s;s. Many young women fooli&s;hly imagine, as &s;oon as they are married, they have a right to under&s;tand and laugh at an indelicate allu&s;ion. But from this fault the native purity of your mind will, I am certain, pre&s;erve you; &s;ince nothing but extreme ignorance or levity could lead any woman to li&s;ten, with apparent plea&s;ure, to an improper tale, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ill-timed je&s;t. There are too many men, yea, even among tho&s;e who call them&s;elves gentlemen, who will not &s;cruple to &s;hock a woman's ears with conver&s;ation of this kind. But the look of marked di&s;approbation and &s;ilent contempt, will never fail to &s;ilence them, unle&s;s they are either brutes or fools; and to &s;uch there is no fear of your being expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The next thing is, neatne&s;s in your per&s;on and dre&s;s, and an equanimi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of temper, to be pre&s;erved towards your hu&s;band, and your &s;ervants. Nothing degrades a gentle|woman more, than her &s;uffering her temper to be &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar ruffled, as to u&s;e improper language to her dependants; nor can any thing be more di&s;gu&s;ting to a man of &s;en&s;e, than to &s;ee his wife give way to &s;udden &s;tarts of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"To every friend and relation of your hu&s;band, &s;hew a polite a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion, and marked preference. Shew him, that to be related to, or e&s;teemed by him, is a &s;ufficient claim upon your regard. Whatever be his errors, confine the knowledge of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to your own bo&s;om; and endeavour, by the milde&s;t per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ions, to lead him to the path of recti|tude. Di&s;cretion mu&s;t direct you as to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">per &s;ea&s;on to offer your advice and opinions; &s;ince m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in general are &s;o tenacious of their prerogative, that they &s;tart from every thing, which has the lea&s;t appearance of control or oppo&s;ition.

<P>"Above all things never &s;uffer any per&s;on to &s;peak di&s;|re&s;pectfully of him in your pre&s;ence; and guard your heart from the lea&s;t approach of jealou&s;y.

Never permit any man, however clothed with the ma&s;k of friend|&s;hip, to treat you with familiarity. There are many free|doms, which to a girl may be perfectly innocent, and yet become crimes when offered to, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ived by a married woman.

familiarity; nor can any thing be more ridiculous, than to &s;ee the mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, perhaps the mother of four or five children, affecting a giddy flirting carriage, that would be hardly excu&s;able in a girl of &s;ixteen. It may, in &s;ome in&s;tances, proceed from an innocent gaiety of heart; but it hardly ever fails of degenerating into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vity and imprudence; always lays a woman open to in&s;ult, of which &s;he cannot complain, becau&s;e &s;he evidently invited it; and too often ends in the total lo&s;s of honour, happine&s;s, and reputation.

<P>"THE news that you were &s;afe in bed, and mother to a daughter, my dear Gertrude, does, believe me, give as much &s;atisfaction to my heart, as any &s;ublunary plea&s;ure po&s;&s;ibly can.

<P>"Let not a too great fondne&s;s prompt you, by extreme indulgence, to enervate the faculties of her &s;oul, or pervert her di&s;po&s;ition, and thus render her totally unfit to bear the many inconveniencies and cro&s;&s;es, &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily meet with in her pa&s;&s;age through life.

Do not be too anxious to have your child prai&s;ed for an early progre&s;s in her education; a young mind &s;hould not be loaded, it &s;poils the memory, and oft|en occa&s;ions a di&s;like to &s;tudy in more advanced life; be|&s;ides, children accu&s;tomed to hear them&s;elves commended, are apt to think them&s;elves &s;ufficiently wi&s;e and accom|pli&s;hed, before their education is well b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gun.</P>
<P>"Do n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> encourage in her a love of finery, or &s;uffer her to be told &s;he is hand&s;ome; they will both be very pernicious to her future tranquillity.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="031725_0124_0FEE1F00859B97B8">"There is one thing, which parents are very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt, not on|ly to do them&s;elves, but to &s;uffer their &s;ervants to do the &s;ame, that is, when any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le ma&s;ter vi&s;its at the hou&s;e nearly of Mile's age, &s;he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ld, that he is her little hu&s;|band, and that &s;he mu&s;t hold up her head and behave like a woman, or &s;he will never be married. Thus is the idea of love and lovers introduced into her little heart, before &s;he is capable of under&s;tanding when the word means. This is, to me, the mo&s;t fooli&s;h conduct in the world, and nothing would offend me &s;o &s;oon, as having &s;uch ridiculous things &s;aid to any child, in who&s;e education and future pro&s;pects I was at all concerned. Teach her the differ|ence between right and wrong; and convince her rea&s;on, by pointing out the real way to promote her own happi|ne&s;s, and merit the regard and e&s;teem of her friends.</P>
<P>"Do not introduce your girl too early into public cir|cles, it will give her a ta&s;te for di&s;&s;ipation. In proper time let her partake, in moderation, of all the innocent amu&s;ements of the metropolis, &s;o as to prevent the bad ef|fects of curio&s;ity ungratified; but at the &s;ame time accu&s;|tom her to find re&s;ources within her&s;elf, which may, at all times, enable her to bani&s;h that mon&s;ter <HI>Ennui.</HI></P>
<P>"Tru&s;t not the cultivation of her mental faculties, or the forming of her moral character, to any one but your&s;elf. As &s;he advances towards womanhood, make her your friend and companion: let the di&s;tance between mother and daughter be forgotten; and, by treating her with a degree of confidence, encourage her, to make your bo&s;om the repo&s;itory of all her &s;ecrets, and be ready to ap|ply to your better judgment to direct all her actions.</P>
<P>"I am certain, there would not be half the imprudencies committed by girls in general, if they were not kept at &s;uch an awful di&s;tance by their mothers; that, fearing either ridicule or reproof they dare not intru&s;t them with their little plans and di&s;appointments. Relying, therefore, on the advice of &s;ome one as inexperienced as them&s;elves, or to the &s;ugge&s;tions of their own &s;imple hearts, they in|volve them&s;elves in troubles, which endanger their peace of mind, and ruin their reputation: but &s;o it will ever be, whil&s;t mothers forget they have ever been girls them&s;elves,

and make no allowance for the volatility of youth, and the innocent impul&s;es of a heart unburthened by the cares of the world.</P>
<P>"There is yet another &s;ubject, which dwells &s;till nearer my heart, the nece&s;&s;ity of giving your child a proper &s;en&s;e of the high advantages of early piety. Example, my dear friend, mu&s;t accompany and enforce your rational, &s;criptural in&s;tructions, mu&s;t teach her the true principles of the Chri&s;|tian Religion. Let her &s;ee you in the act of devotion: let her curio&s;ity be awakened, and then, as you an&s;wer her que&s;tions, endeavour to lead her by degrees to love, adore and wor&s;hip the Almighty Giver of all good. Convince her of her dependence on his bounty for food, raiment, and all the ble&s;&s;ings of life. Teach her to place her whole confidence in his mercy, to receive even the &s;malle&s;t ble&s;&s;|ing with gratitude, and to bow under the heavie&s;t affliction with patience and humility.</P>
<P>"But above all things, mind that your example does not <HI>contradict</HI> your precept. What confidence can a child place in the religion of its parent, when the parent lives in direct oppo&s;ition to the precepts of that religion?</P>
<P>"Our duty is plainly marked, and &s;o ea&s;y, that, when we do not perform it, we take more pains to court mi&s;ery, than would &s;uffice to make us truly happy. What can be more ea&s;ily comprehended, even by the meane&s;t un|der&s;tanding! "Do ju&s;tly, love mercy, and walk humbly." "Love thy Creator above all things, and thy neighbour as thy&s;elf." "Forgive, as you hope to be forgiven." And remember, that "with the &s;ame mea&s;ure you mete, the like &s;hall be given you again."</P>
<P>"God pre&s;erve and ble&s;s you! May peace reign in your heart, and true piety direct your actions! May you &s;o pa&s;s through this tran&s;itory life, as not to dread the ap|proach of the me&s;&s;enger, who &s;hall convey you to eternal re&s;t!</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT has often been a &s;olid grief to me, when I have re|flected on this glorious nation, which is the &s;cene of public happine&s;s and liberty, that there are &s;till crowds of private tyrants, again&s;t whom there neither is any law in being, nor can there be invented any by the wit of man. The&s;e cruel men are ill-natured hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>SYLVIA was neither in fortune, birth or education below the gentleman whom &s;he has married. Her per&s;on, her age, and her character, are al&s;o &s;uch as he can make no exception to. But &s;o it is, that from the moment the marriage ceremony was over, the ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s of a lover was turned into the haughtine&s;s of a ma&s;ter. All the kind endearments which &s;he u&s;es to plea&s;e him, are at be&s;t but &s;o many in&s;tances of her duty. This in&s;olence takes away that &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, which does not only excite to vir|tue, but al&s;o rewards it. It abates the fire of a free and generous love, and imbitters all the plea&s;ures of a &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>An affliction of this &s;ort is the greate&s;t that can happen in human life; and I know but one con&s;olation in it (if that be a con&s;olation) that the calamity is a pretty general one. There is nothing &s;o common as for men to enter into marriage, without &s;o much as expecting to be happy in it. They &s;eem to propo&s;e to them&s;elves a few holidays in the beginning of it; after which they are to return at be&s;t to the u&s;ual cour&s;e of their life, and, for aught they
<PB N="128" REF="031725_0127_0FEE1F051E9BDC78">
know, to con&s;tant mi&s;ery and unea&s;ine&s;s. From this fal&s;e &s;en&s;e of the &s;tate they are going into, proceeds the imme|diate coldne&s;s and indifference, or hatred and aver&s;ion, which attend ordinary marriages, or rather bargains to cohabit.</P>
<P>The humour of affecting a &s;uperior carriage, generally ri&s;es from a fal&s;e notion of the weakne&s;s of a female un|der&s;tanding in general, or an over-weening opinion that we have of our own: for when it proceeds from a natural ruggedne&s;s and brutality of temper, it is altogether incor|rigible, and not to be amended by admonition. Sir FRAN|CIS BACON, as I remember, lays it down as a maxim, that no marriage can be happy, in which the wife has no opinion of her hu&s;band's wi&s;dom; but without offence to &s;o great an authority, I may venture to &s;ay, that a &s;ullen wi&s;e man is as bad as a good-natured fool. Knowledge, &s;oftened with complacency and good breeding, will make a man equally beloved and re&s;pected; but when joined with a &s;evere, di&s;tant and un&s;ociable temper, it creates rather fear than love.</P>
<P>PLINY, one of the greate&s;t as well as the mo&s;t learned men, was al&s;o one of the be&s;t hu&s;bands in the whole Ro|man empire. The following letters were written by him to his wife CALPHURNIA, at a time when &s;he was at a di&s;tance from him, and are full of conjugal tenderne&s;s.</P>

<P>PROFANE wits, in&s;tead of correcting the vices of the age, do all they can to inflame them. Mar|riage has been one of the common topics of ridicule in which every &s;tage-&s;cribbler hath found his account; for whenever there is an occa&s;ion for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p, an impertinent je&s;t upon matrimony is &s;ure to rai&s;e it. A kind hu&s;band hath, in con&s;equence, been looked upon as a clown; and a good wife as a dome&s;tic animal, unfit for the company or con|ver&s;ation of the beau monde. In &s;hort, &s;eparate beds, &s;i|lent tables, and &s;olitary homes, have been introduced, more particularly in the European world, by your men of wit and plea&s;ure of the age.</P>
<P>As I always mean to &s;tem the torrents of prejudice and vice, I &s;hall take particular care to put an hone&s;t father of a family in countenance, and endeavour to remove all the evils out of that &s;tate of life, which is either the mo&s;t hap|py or the mo&s;t mi&s;erable, in which a man can be placed. I have &s;hewn in my la&s;t paper, that PLINY, who was a man of the greate&s;t genius, as well as of the fir&s;t quality of his age, did not think it below him, to be a kind hu&s;|band, and to treat his wife as a friend, companion, and coun&s;ellor.

VENUS was proud of an oppor|tunity of obliging &s;o great a godde&s;s, and therefore made her a pre&s;ent of the Ce&s;tus which &s;he u&s;ed to wear about her own wai&s;t, with advice to hide it in her bo&s;om, till &s;he had accompli&s;hed her intention. This Ce&s;tus was a tine parti-coloured girdle, which, as HOMER tells us, had all the attractions of the &s;ex wrought into it. The four principal figures in the embroidery were love, de&s;ire, fond|ne&s;s of &s;peech, and conver&s;ation, filled with that &s;weetne&s;s and complacency which, &s;ays the poet, in&s;en&s;ibly &s;teal away the hearts of the wi&s;e&s;t men.</P>

The poet then repre&s;ents him in &s;o great an ardour, that (without going up to the hou&s;e which had been built by the hands of VULCAN, according to JUNO's direction) he threw a golden cloud over their heads, as they &s;at upon the top of mount IDA, while the earth beneath them &s;prung up in lotu&s;es, &s;affrons, hyacinths, and a bed of the &s;ofte&s;t flowers for their repo&s;e.</P>

<P>THE impo&s;ition of hone&s;t names and words upon im|proper &s;ubjects, has made &s;o regular a confu&s;ion among us, that we are apt to &s;it down with our errors, well enough &s;atisfied with the methods we are fallen into, without attempting to deliver our&s;elves from the tyranny under which we are reduced by &s;uch innovations. Of all the laudable motives of human life, none has &s;uffered &s;o much in this kind as love; under which revered name, a brutal de&s;ire called lu&s;t is frequently concealed and admit|ted; though they differ as much as a matron from a pro&s;|titute, or a companion from a buffoon.</P>
<P>The figures which the ancient mythologi&s;ts and poets put upon love and lu&s;t in their writings, are very in&s;truct|ive. Love is a beauteous blind child, adorned with a quiver and a bow, which he plays with and &s;hoots around him, without de&s;ign or direction; to intimate to us, that the per&s;on beloved has no intention to give us the anxieties we meet with; but that the beauties of a worthy object are like the charms of a lovely infant: they cannot but attract your concern and fondne&s;s, though the child &s;o re|garded is as in&s;en&s;ible of the value you put upon it, as it is that it de&s;erves your benevolence. On the other &s;ide, the &s;ages figured lu&s;t in the form of a &s;atyr; of &s;hape part human, part be&s;tial; to &s;ignify, that the followers of it
<PB N="138" REF="031725_0137_0FEE1F2A8D6E9940">
pro&s;titute the rea&s;on of a man to pur&s;ue the appetites of a bea&s;t. This &s;atyr is made to haunt the paths and cov|erts of the wood nymphs and &s;hepherde&s;&s;es, to lurk on the banks of rivulets, and watch the purling &s;treams (as the re&s;orts of retired virgins) to &s;how, that lawle&s;s de&s;ire tends chiefly to prey upon innocence; and has &s;omething &s;o unnatural in it, that it hates its own make, and &s;huns the object it loved, as &s;oon as it has made it like it&s;elf. Love therefore is a child, that complains and bewails its inability to help it&s;elf, and weeps for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, without an immediate reflection or knowledge of the food it wants; lu&s;t a watchful thief, which &s;eizes its prey, and lays &s;nares for its own relief; and its principal object being innocence, it never robs but it murders at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>From this idea of a Cupid and a &s;atyr, we may &s;ettle our notion of the&s;e different de&s;ires, and accordingly rank their followers. ASPASIA mu&s;t therefore be allowed to be the fir&s;t of the beauteous order of love, who&s;e unaffected freedom and con&s;cious innocence give her the attendance of the graces in all her actions. That awful di&s;tance which we bear towards her in all our thoughts of her, and that cheerful familiarity with which we approach her, are certain in&s;tances of her being the true object of love. In this accompli&s;hed lady love is the con&s;tant effect, becau&s;e it is never the de&s;ign. Yet, though her mien carries much more invitation than command, to behold her is an imme|diate check to loo&s;e behaviour; and to love her is a lib|eral education: for, it being the nature of all to love to create an imitation of the beloved per&s;on in the lover, a regard for ASPASIA naturally produces decency of man|ners, and good conduct of life in her admirers. If there|fore the giggling LEUCIPPE could but &s;ee her train of fops a&s;&s;embled, and ASPASIA move by them, &s;he would be mortified at the veneration with which &s;he is beheld even by LEUCIPPE's own unthinking equipage, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have long ago taken leave of their under&s;tandings.</P>
<P>As charity is e&s;teemed a conjunction of the good qual|ities nece&s;&s;ary to a virtuous man, &s;o love is the happy com|po&s;ition of all the accompli&s;hments that make a fine gen|tl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

and &s;uch as have the beauteous boy for their in|&s;pirer, have a &s;implicity of behaviour, and a certain even|ne&s;s of de&s;ire, which burns like the lamp of life in their bo&s;oms; while they who are in&s;tigated by the &s;atyr are ever tortured by jealou&s;ies of the object of their wi&s;hes, often de&s;ire what they &s;corn, and as often con&s;ciou&s;ly and knowingly embrace where they are mutually indifferent.</P>
<P>AMANDA, the wife of FLORIO, lives in the continual enjoyment of new in&s;tances of her hu&s;band's friend&s;hip, and &s;ees it the end of all his ambition to make her life one &s;eries of plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction; and AMANDA's reli&s;h of the goods of life is all that makes them plea&s;ing to FLORIO: they behave them&s;elves to each other, when pre&s;ent, with a certain apparent benevolence, which tran&s;|ports above rapture; and they think of each other in ab|&s;ence, with a confidence unknown to the highe&s;t friend|&s;hip: their &s;atisfactions are doubled, their &s;orrows le&s;&s;ened by participation.</P>
<P>He does not under&s;tand either vice or virtue who will not allow, that life without the rules of morality, is a way|ward unea&s;y being, with &s;natches only of plea&s;ure; but under the regulation of virtue, a rea&s;onable and uniform habit of enjoyment. There is in a play of old HAYWOOD, a &s;peech at the end of an act, which touches this point with much &s;pirit. He makes a married man, upon &s;ome endearing occa&s;ion, look at his &s;pou&s;e with an air of fond|ne&s;s, and fall into the following reflection on his condition.</P>

<P>YOU mu&s;t know, that I am married to one of the mo&s;t agreeable women in the world, have an unabating pa&s;&s;ion for my wife, and every rea&s;on to imagine her &s;entiments are equally tender for me: there is nothing of con&s;equence but what we continually &s;tudy to oblige each other in; yet, at the &s;ame time, there are a thou&s;and little trifles in which we are always &s;ure to di&s;agree, and which are not only an endle&s;s &s;ource of di&s;quiet to our&s;elves, but of unea&s;ine&s;s to our whole family.</P>
<P>La&s;t night, for in&s;tance, Sir, after &s;upper, I acquainted Nancy that a vintner, who owed me a hundred pounds for &s;ome Li&s;bon, (for you mu&s;t know I am a wine-merchant) had failed, and that there was little probability of expecting two and &s;ixpence from the &s;ale of all his effects. I further|more informed her, that I was much to blame in the affair, and that I had tru&s;ted this man contrary to the advice of an intimate friend, who was perfectly conver&s;ant with his circum&s;tances. My wife, in&s;tead of reprehending me for indi&s;cretion, as the generality of her &s;ex would have done in the &s;ame ca&s;e, made u&s;e of every argument in her power to di&s;&s;ipate my chagrin; told me, the mo&s;t careful were un|able now and then to avoid an error, and bid me con&s;ole my&s;elf under my lo&s;s, by thanking Providence that I had not been a &s;ufferer in double the &s;um. I was greatly charm|ed
<PB N="143" REF="031725_0142_0FEE1F399504DC00">
with this di&s;po&s;ition in Mrs. Mountain, and expre&s;&s;ed my &s;en&s;ibility of it in a manner with which &s;he &s;eemed ex|ceedingly plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>After all this, would you imagine, Sir, that a mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tance &s;hould make us part beds for that night? My favourite liquor is a gla&s;s of punch, and it happens to be my wife's too: making a little as we were alone, I unluckily &s;queezed the pulp of the lemon into the bowl; upon which &s;he immediately exclaimed, with &s;ome warmth&mdash;'Lord, my dear, you have &s;poiled the punch!' 'No, my love,' replied I, 'the pulp gives it a fine flavour; and be&s;ides, you know I am very fond of it.' 'Ay, but,' &s;ays &s;he, 'you are &s;en&s;ible I cannot abide it.' 'Then, my dear,' returned I, 'it is an ea&s;y matter to avoid putting any into your gla&s;s.' 'Lord! Mr. Mountain, I have &s;poken to you a thou&s;and times about this very circum&s;tance; I be|lieve in my con&s;cience, you do it on purpo&s;e to give me di&s;gu&s;t.'</P>
<P>Here, Sir, we began a conte&s;t; &s;everity produced &s;e|verity, till at la&s;t I ordered a bed to be made for my&s;elf; and poor Nancy retired to her own with her eyes &s;wimming in tears.</P>
<P>For the whole night neither of us (for I judge of her by my&s;elf) had a &s;ingle wink of &s;leep; we tumbled and to&s;&s;ed, canva&s;&s;ed the matter fifty ways in our minds, and at la&s;t concluded, that we were both in the wrong. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, when we met at breakfa&s;t, but an hour ago, neither of us would conde&s;cend to &s;peak fir&s;t; we affected a re&s;entment of countenance that was utterly foreign to our hearts, and endeavoured to keep up the ap|pearance of an unremitting anger, when we both of us long|ed to be reconciled, and had the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate inclination to be plea&s;ed. Breakfa&s;t was over before we exchanged a &s;yllable. When the &s;ervant had left the room, I prepar|ed to go out, and had ju&s;t got to the parlour-door, when poor Nancy, unable to hold it out any longer, cried, in a tone of irre&s;i&s;tible &s;oftne&s;s, 'And will you go out without &s;peaking a word?' Here our whole ridiculous quarrel was at an end: I turned to her with all the fondne&s;s I could po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume, and held her in my arms for &s;ome moments;
<PB N="144" REF="031725_0143_0FEE1F3B1D847520">
whil&s;t &s;he, returning the fervour of the embrace, bur&s;t into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>It is inconceivable to think, Sir, how contemptible the&s;e little differences have made us in the eyes of our own &s;er|vants. Whenever they &s;ee us cool towards one another, they titter and laugh, and &s;ay the poor things will &s;oon ki&s;s and make it up again. It was no longer ago than la&s;t week, that I overheard my ra&s;cal of a coachman tell one of his fellow &s;ervants, that his ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s were nothing better than an overgrown boy and girl, and that he fancied a little of his hor&s;ewhip would be of great &s;er|vice to both of them.</P>
<P>It is very odd, Sir, that people who really love one another and are not wholly de&s;titute of under&s;tanding, &s;hould give way to &s;uch re&s;entment in the mere&s;t trifles, who, in the mo&s;t important circum&s;tances of life, are above feeling the &s;malle&s;t re&s;entment, or entertaining the minute&s;t di&s;e&s;teem. Many is the time, Sir, I have found fault with my wife for &s;tirring the fire, when her &s;pending fifty pounds has not given me the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s; and many a time has &s;he fallen out with me, if, in cutting up a fowl, I happened to &s;pla&s;h ever &s;o &s;mall a drop of gravy on the table-cloth, though &s;he has felt no di&s;compo&s;ure in life, if I &s;poiled a rich &s;ilk, or dirted a fine head-dre&s;s. This morning, how|ever, we have agreed, as a mean of keeping our&s;elves from pa&s;&s;ions of this nature for the future, to &s;end you the fore|going account; and if it &s;hould turn out any way &s;ervicea|ble to others, as I hope it will, I &s;hall have a double rea&s;on to &s;ign my&s;elf your mo&s;t humble &s;ervant,</P>

<P>The &s;econd cour&s;e was now called for; and among a variety of other di&s;hes, a fine turkey was placed before the widow. My friend begged his mi&s;tre&s;s to help him to a part of the turkey. The widow, plea&s;ed with an opportu|nity of &s;howing her &s;kill in carving, (an art upon which it &s;eems &s;he piqued her&s;elf) began to cut it up by fir&s;t taking off the leg.

When I die of age, I know of &s;ome that will quake for fear; if the leg does not come off, take the turkey to your&s;elf.'&mdash;'Madam,' replied my friend, 'I do not care a farthing whether the leg or the wing comes off; if you are for the leg fir&s;t, why, you &s;hall have the argument, even though it be as I &s;ay.'&mdash;'As for the matter of that,' cries the widow, 'I do not care a &s;ig, whether you are for the leg off or on; and, friend, for the future, keep your di&s;tance.'&mdash; 'O,' replied the other, 'that is ea&s;ily done, it is only remov|ing to the other end of the table; and &s;o, Madam, your mo&s;t obedient humble &s;ervant.'</P>

<P>IT is very commonly ob&s;erved, that the mo&s;t &s;mart pangs which we meet with are in the beginning of wedlock, which proceed from ignorance of each other's humour, and want of prudence to make allowances for a change from the mo&s;t careful re&s;pect to the mo&s;t unbound|ed familiarity. Hence it ari&s;es, that trifles are commonly occa&s;ions of the greate&s;t anxiety; for contradiction being a thing wholly unu&s;ual between a new married couple, the &s;malle&s;t in&s;tance of it is taken for the highe&s;t injury; and it very &s;eldom happens that the man is &s;low enough in a&s;|&s;uming the character of an hu&s;band, or the woman quick enough in conde&s;cending to that of a wife. It immedi|ately follows, that they think they have all the time of their court&s;hip been talking in ma&s;ks to each other, and therefore begin to act like di&s;appointed people. PHILAN|DER finds DELIA ill-natured and impertinent, and DELIA PHILANDER &s;urly and incon&s;tant.</P>
<P>I have known a fond couple quarrel in the very honey moon, about cutting up a tart: nay, I could name two, who, after having had &s;even children, fell out and parted beds upon the boiling of a leg of mutton. My very next neighbours have not &s;poken to one another the&s;e three days, becau&s;e they differed in their opinions, whether the clock &s;hould &s;tand by the window or over the chimney.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e indeed who begin this cour&s;e of life without jars at their &s;etting out arrive within a few months at a pitch of benevolence and affection, of which the mo&s;t perfect friend&s;hip is but a faint re&s;emblance. As in the unfortu|nate marriage, the mo&s;t minute and indifferent things are objects of the &s;harpe&s;t re&s;entment; &s;o in a happy one,
<PB N="147" REF="031725_0146_0FEE1F4716D5DB10">
they are occa&s;ions of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction. For what does not oblige in one we love? what does not offend in tho&s;e we di&s;like? For the&s;e rea&s;ons I take it for a rule, that in marriage, the chief bu&s;ine&s;s is to ac|quire a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of each other. They &s;hould con&s;ider one another's words and actions with a &s;ecret indulgence: there &s;hould be always an inward fondne&s;s pleading for each other, &s;uch as may add new beauties to every thing that is excellent, give charms to what is indif|ferent, and cover every thing that is defective. For want of this kind propen&s;ity and bias of mind, the married pair often take things ill of each other, which no one el&s;e would notice in either of them.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, that I may do ju&s;tice to this excel|lent in&s;titution, I mu&s;t own there are un&s;peakable plea&s;ures which are as little con&s;idered in the computation of the advantages of marriages, as others are in the u&s;ual &s;urvey that is made of its misfortunes.</P>
<P>LOVEMORE and his wife live together in the happy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of each other's hearts, and by that mean have no indifferent moments, but their whole life is one continued &s;cene of delight. Their pa&s;&s;ion for each other communi|cates a certain &s;atisfaction, like that which they them&s;elves are in, to all that approach them. When &s;he enters the place where he is, you &s;ee a plea&s;ure which he cannot conceal, nor he nor any one el&s;e de&s;cribe. In &s;o con|&s;ummate an affection, the very pre&s;ence of the per&s;on be|loved, has the effect of the mo&s;t agreeable conver&s;ation. Whether they have matter to talk of or not, they enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, and at the &s;ame time the freedom of &s;olitude. Their ordinary life is to be preferred to the happie&s;t moments of other lovers. In a word, they have each of them great merit, live in the e&s;teem of all who know them, and &s;eem but to comply with the opinions of their friends in the ju&s;t value they have for each other.</P>

<P>AMONG the many advantages ari&s;ing from cultivated &s;entiment, one of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t truly valuable, is that delicate complacency of mind, which leads us to con&s;ult the feelings of tho&s;e with whom we live, by &s;hew|ing a di&s;po&s;ition to gratify them as far as in our power, and by avoiding whatever has a contrary tendency. They mu&s;t, indeed, have attended little to what pa&s;&s;es in the world, who do not know the importance of this di&s;po&s;i|tion; who have not ob&s;erved, that the want of it often poi&s;ons the dome&s;tic happine&s;s of families, who&s;e felicity every other circum&s;tance concurs to promote. Among the letters lately received from my corre&s;pondents, are two, which, as they afford a lively picture of the bad con|&s;equences re&s;ulting from the neglect of this complacency, I &s;hall here lay before my readers.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY father was a merchant of &s;ome eminence, who gave me a good education, and a fortune of &s;everal thou|&s;and pounds. With the&s;e advantages, a tolerable per&s;on, and I think not an unamiable temper, I was not long arrived at womanhood, before I found my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many admirers. Among others was <HI>Mr. Gold,</HI> a gentle|man of a very re&s;pectable character, who had &s;ome con|nections in trade with my father. To him, being a young man of a good figure, and of very open and obliging man|ners, I &s;oon gave the preference; and we were according|ly married with the univer&s;al approbation of my friends.</P>
<P>We have now lived together above three years, and I have brought him two boys and a girl, all very fine chil|dren. I go little abroad, attend to nothing &s;o much as the economy of our family, am as obliging as po&s;&s;ible to all my hu&s;band's friends, and &s;tudy in every particular to be a kind and dutiful wife. Mr. Gold's reputation and &s;ucce&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s daily increa&s;es, and he is, in the main,
<PB N="149" REF="031725_0148_0FEE1F51919DA4C0">
a kind and attentive hu&s;band; yet I find him &s;o particu|lar in his temper, and &s;o often out of humour about trifles, that, in &s;pite of all tho&s;e comfortable circum&s;tances, I am perfectly unhappy.</P>
<P>At one time he finds fault with the di&s;hes at table; at another, with the choice of my maid-&s;ervants; &s;ometimes he is di&s;plea&s;ed with the trimming of my gown, &s;ometimse with the &s;hape of my cloak, or the figure of my head|dre&s;s; and &s;hould I chance to give an opinion on any &s;ubject which is not perfectly to his mind, he probably looks out of humour at the time, and he is &s;ure to chide me about it when we are by our&s;elves.</P>
<P>It is of no con&s;equence, whether I have been right or wrong in any of the&s;e particulars. If I &s;ay a word in defence of my choice or opinion, it is &s;ure to make mat|ters wor&s;e, and I am only called a fool for my pains; or, if I expre&s;s my wonder that he &s;hould give him&s;elf unea&s;i|ne&s;s about &s;uch trifles, he an&s;wers, &s;ullenly, that, to be &s;ure, every thing is a trifle, in which I choo&s;e to di&s;o|blige him.</P>
<P>In a word, Mr. Gold will allow me to have no mind but his: and, unle&s;s I can &s;ee with his eyes, hear with his ears, and ta&s;te with his palate, (none of which I can very ea&s;ily bring my&s;elf to do, as you mu&s;t know all of them are &s;omewhat particular,) I &s;ee no pro&s;pect of our &s;ituation changing for the better; and what makes our pre&s;ent one doubly provoking is, that, but for this unfor|tunate weakne&s;s, Mr. Gold, who is, in other re&s;pects, a very worthy man, would make one of the be&s;t of hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>Pray tell me, Sir, what I &s;hould do in this &s;ituation; or take your own way of letting my hu&s;band &s;ee his weak|ne&s;s, the reformation of which would be the greate&s;t of all earthly ble&s;&s;ings to</P>

<P>I WAS bred a merchant; by my &s;ucce&s;s in trade I am now in affluent circum&s;tances, and I have rea&s;on to think, that I am &s;o with an unblemi&s;hed character.</P>
<P>Some years ago I married the daughter of a re&s;pecta|ble citizen, who brought a comfortable addition to my fortune; and, as &s;he had been virtuou&s;ly educated, and &s;eemed cheerful and good-tempered; as I was my&s;elf naturally of a dome&s;tic turn, and re&s;olved to make a good hu&s;band, I thought we bade fair for being happy in each other.</P>
<P>But, though I mu&s;t do my &s;pou&s;e the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that &s;he is di&s;creet and prudent, attentive to the affairs of her family, a careful and fond mother to her children, and, in many re&s;pects, an affectionate and dutiful wife; yet one foible in her temper de&s;troys the effect of all the&s;e good qualities. She is &s;o much attached to her own opinions in every trifle, &s;o impatient of contradiction in them, and withal &s;o ready to di&s;pute mine, that, if I di&s;approve of her ta&s;te or &s;entiments, in any one particular, or &s;eem di&s;|&s;atisfied, when &s;he di&s;approves of my ta&s;te or &s;entiments, it is the certain &s;ource of a quarrel; and, whil&s;t we per|fectly agree as to our general plan of life, and every e&s;&s;en|tial circum&s;tance of our dome&s;tic economy, this &s;illy fancy that I mu&s;t eat, dre&s;s, think, and &s;peak, preci&s;ely as &s;he would have me, whil&s;t &s;he will not accommodate her&s;elf to me in the mo&s;t trifling of the&s;e particulars, gives me perpetual unea&s;ine&s;s.

<P>I am &s;ure, this foible of my poor wife will appear to you, Sir, in its proper light; your making it appear &s;o to her, may be the mean of alleviating our mutual di&s;tre&s;s; for, to tell you the truth, I believe &s;he is almo&s;t as great a &s;ufferer as I am.

<P>On comparing the&s;e two letters, it is evident that, from the want of that complacency mentioned in the beginning of this paper, the very &s;en&s;ibility of temper, and &s;trength of affection, which, under its influence, would have made this good couple happy, has had a quite contrary effect. The &s;ource of the di&s;quiet they complain of, is nothing el&s;e than the want of that re&s;pect for the ta&s;te, feelings, and opinions of each other, which con&s;titutes the di&s;po&s;i|tion I have recommended above, and which, &s;o far from being incon&s;i&s;tent with a rea&s;onable de&s;ire of reforming each other in the&s;e particulars, is the mo&s;t probable mean of accompli&s;hing it.</P>
<P>Nor is the ca&s;e of Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Gold</HI> &s;ingular in this re&s;pect. Dome&s;tic quarrels generally originate from the want of this pliancy of di&s;po&s;ition, which people &s;eem, very ab&s;urdly, to &s;uppo&s;e may be di&s;pen&s;ed with in trifles. I have known a man, who would have parted with half his e&s;tate to &s;erve a friend, to whom he would not have yielded a hair's breadth in an argument. But the &s;maller virtues mu&s;t be attended to as well as the greater; the manners as well as the duties of life. They form a &s;ort of <HI>Pocket-Coin,</HI> which, though it does not enter into great and important tran&s;actions, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for com|mon and ordinary intercour&s;e.</P>

<P>THE mutual complaints of Mr. and Mrs. Gold, which have been communicated in my la&s;t paper, together with &s;ome complaints of &s;imilar family di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which I have received from other corre&s;pondents, often remind me of the happy effects, which my friends <HI>Horatio</HI> and <HI>Emilia</HI> have experienced from an oppo&s;ite temper and conduct.</P>
<P>Horatio, though he obtained a very liberal education, lived till the age of twenty-five almo&s;t entirely in the country. The &s;mall fortune which he inherited from his father being about this time increa&s;ed by his &s;ucceeding to a di&s;tant relation; he married the young and beautiful Emilia. He had become warmly attached to her, not &s;o much on account of her beauty, as from an expre&s;&s;ion of a &s;weet, though lively temper, which marked her coun|tenance. This, when admitted to a more intimate ac|quaintance, in &s;ome vi&s;its which he paid to the capital, he found to be ju&s;tified by her conver&s;ation and manners.</P>
<P>Emilia's father was addicted to plea&s;ure and expen&s;e, and her mother, though more accompli&s;hed, of a &s;imilar di&s;po&s;ition. In their family &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to a life of more than ordinary gaiety.</P>
<P>Though Horatio felt, in all its extent, that pa&s;&s;ion which is not very favourable to a ju&s;t e&s;timation of charac|ter, yet the&s;e circum&s;tances had not e&s;caped his notice. He failed not to ob&s;erve, that Emilia had acquired a &s;tronger attachment to the plea&s;ures of a town life, than was either right in it&s;elf, or agreeable to that preference for dome&s;tic &s;ociety, and the quiet of a country life, which he had always felt, and which he &s;till wi&s;hed to gratify.</P>
<P>However, in&s;tead of acquainting Emilia with his ta&s;te in the&s;e particulars, he judged it better to let her enjoy that &s;tyle of life to which &s;he had been accu&s;tomed, not doubting, from the natural good &s;en&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s of her
<PB N="153" REF="031725_0152_0FEE1F5F00613AA0">
di&s;po&s;ition, that her own ta&s;te might be gradually corrected, and that as his &s;hould, from time to time, fall under her ob&s;ervation, it might contribute to the change.</P>
<P>He took up, therefore, his re&s;idence in town; and though Emilia went into company, and frequented public places more than he could wi&s;h, yet he complied with her inclination in the&s;e in&s;tances, partook of her amu&s;ements when he was not nece&s;&s;arily engaged, and, when he did &s;o, carefully avoided betraying that indifference or di&s;gu&s;t which he often felt.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Horatio, however, gave way to the ta&s;te of Emilia, he never lo&s;t the inclination, nor neglected the means of reforming it.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the gaiety to which &s;he had been accu&s;tomed, Emilia had early formed a ta&s;te for the elegant writers of the pre&s;ent age; and the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility and delicacy of mind, which led her to admire them, made her no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the beauties of a poli&s;hed and refined conver&s;a|tion. It was this, which had fir&s;t gained the affections of Horatio; it was to this he tru&s;ted for effecting the reforma|tion he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>He was very a&s;&s;iduous, therefore, to cultivate and en|courage this literary ta&s;te in Emilia. He frequently took occa&s;ion to turn the conver&s;ation to &s;ubjects of litera|ture, and to dwell on the beauties, or mention the &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages of this or that author; and would often engage Emilia in a fine poem, an affecting tragedy, or an intere&s;t|ing novel, when, but for that circum&s;tance, &s;he would have been exhau&s;ting her &s;pirits at a ball, or wa&s;ting the night at cards.</P>
<P>Nor was he le&s;s &s;tudious in forming her ta&s;te for com|pany than for books. Though he had never aimed at an exten&s;ive acquaintance, Horatio enjoyed the friend&s;hip of &s;everal per&s;ons of both &s;exes endued with tho&s;e elegant manners, and that delicate and cultivated under&s;tanding, which render conver&s;ation at once agreeable and in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e friends he frequently formed parties at his hou&s;e. Emilia, who had the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition to oblige, which &s;he on all occa&s;ions experienced from him, was happy to indulge his inclinations in this particular; and, as &s;he
<PB N="154" REF="031725_0153_0FEE1F6089975668">
was well qualified for bearing a part in their conver&s;ation, which had charms of which her mind was highly &s;en&s;ible, the&s;e parties gradually became more and more agreeable to her.</P>
<P>In this manner her books, the conver&s;ation of &s;elect companies, and the care of her children, which &s;oon be|came a mo&s;t endearing office to her tender and feeling heart, furni&s;hed her with a variety of dome&s;tic occupations. As the&s;e gradually led her to go le&s;s into mixed company and public amu&s;ements, &s;he began to lo&s;e her habitual rel|i&s;h for them. As &s;he ea&s;ily ob&s;erved how agreeable this change was to the ta&s;te of Horatio, that circum&s;tance gave her mind more and more a dome&s;tic turn.</P>
<P>The &s;ame delicacy, from which he at fir&s;t gave way to her ta&s;te for company and public amu&s;ements, made him avoid &s;hewing that preference, which he entertained for a country life.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time he was entirely &s;ilent on the &s;ubject. Though he now and then made excur&s;ions to the country, yet it was only occa&s;ionally upon nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s. Emilia could not but ob&s;erve, that the manner in which he pa&s;&s;ed his time there, in adding to the beauties of his place, and in an ea&s;y intercour&s;e with a few neighbours, was highly agreeable to him. Yet he never expre&s;&s;ed an inclination of fixing his general re&s;idence in the country, or even of her accompanying him in his occa&s;ional vi&s;it at Ro&s;edale. His vi&s;its became, however, gradually more frequent; and, as they generally continued for &s;ome weeks, tho&s;e little ab&s;ences gave a &s;ort of pain to Emilia, to whom no &s;ociety was now &s;o agreeable as that of Ho|ratio. She became, therefore, de&s;irous of accompanying him to the country.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t vi&s;its were &s;hort, and at con&s;iderable inter|vals; but as he omitted no means of rendering them agreeable to her, &s;he &s;eldom left it without regret, and was often the fir&s;t to propo&s;e their return. At length Emilia, who now ob&s;erved, that her hu&s;band was no where &s;o happy as in the country, and had her&s;elf come to feel the &s;ame predilection for the calm cheerfulne&s;s and innocent amu&s;ements of a country life, took occa&s;ion to
<PB N="155" REF="031725_0154_0FEE1F621109C930">
acquaint him with this change in her &s;entiments, and to expre&s;s the &s;ame inclination which, &s;he was per&s;uaded, he entertained&punc; of abandoning a town life, and fixing their con&s;tant re&s;idence at Ro&s;edale.</P>
<P>A propo&s;al &s;o agreeable to him was readily complied with; and they have ever &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed their time in that delightful retreat, occupied with the education of their children, the improvement of their place, and the &s;ociety of a few friends; equally happy in them&s;elves, and belov|ed by all around them. Thus has Horatio, the gentle|ne&s;s of who&s;e mind is equal to the &s;trength of his under|&s;tanding, by a prudent as well as delicate complacency, gradually effected that change, which an oppo&s;ite con|duct might have failed to produce, and which, at the &s;ame time, would probably have been the &s;ource of mutual cha|grin, and rendered both him and his wife unhappy.</P>
<P>Nor was the reformation &s;olely on her part. By lead|ing him to partake in company and amu&s;ements, &s;he be|came the mean of correcting the natural re&s;erve of his manner: and as the example of his plain though animated conver&s;ation led her to moderate the vivacity and &s;pright|line&s;s of hers, which &s;ometimes approached towards levity; &s;o her vivacity communicated an agreeable gaiety and cheerfulne&s;s to the di&s;cour&s;e of Horatio.</P>
<P>If, in the above account, I have pointed out more &s;trongly the effects of complacency in Horatio than in Emilia, it ought to be remembered, that this virtue is much more rarely &s;een in the one &s;ex than in the other. A certain pride, which always requires much di&s;cipline, and often the rod of di&s;appointment and adver&s;ity, to &s;ub|due, attends the firmne&s;s of men, and makes it, generally, much more difficult for them to acquire this complacency of temper.</P>
<P>If men truly po&s;&s;e&s;s that &s;uperiority of under&s;tanding over women, which &s;ome of them &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e, &s;urely this u&s;e of it is equally ungenerous and imprudent. They would, I imagine, &s;hew that &s;uperiority much more effectu|ally, in endeavouring to imitate the amiable gentlene&s;s of the female character, and to acquire, from a &s;en&s;e of its propriety, a virtue, for which, it mu&s;t be allowed, that
<PB N="156" REF="031725_0155_0FEE1F6398773AB8">
the other &s;ex is more indebted to their original con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>If women, as we &s;ometimes allege, are too apt to con|nect the idea of pride, and hardne&s;s of manners, with that of knowledge and ability, and, on that account, often &s;hew a preference to more &s;uperficial accompli&s;hments; the men, who value them&s;elves for knowledge and abili|ties, ought to look into their own conduct for the cau&s;e. Imitating then the behaviour of Horatio, they &s;hould aim to &s;hew, that a man's feelings need not be the le&s;s delicate for being under the direction of a &s;ound judgment; and that he, who be&s;t knows the female character, and will put the highe&s;t value on its excellence, is al&s;o the mo&s;t likely to make allowance for a difference of ta&s;te, and to bear with tho&s;e little weakne&s;&s;es, with which he knows all human excellence to be often accompanied.</P>

<P>IT has been ob&s;erved, that the world is generally ju&s;t in the opinions which it forms of the characters of the different per&s;ons, who appear on the &s;tage of life; that few have been held high in the e&s;timation of the public, who have not de&s;erved it; and that in&s;tances as rarely oc|cur of its cen&s;ure mi&s;applied, as of its applau&s;e mi&s;placed. But though this remark, it mu&s;t be allowed, is true in the general, yet experience teaches that it cannot be admitted without exceptions; and that the truly virtuous and de&s;erv|ing, particularly in the private walks of life, may often pa&s;s unnoticed, whil&s;t the le&s;s worthy may become the objects of favour.</P>
<P><HI>Cleora</HI> was married at an early period of life. Gaily educated, and thoughtle&s;s in di&s;po&s;ition, &s;he was incapable of any &s;trong attachment. She married <HI>Lothario,</HI> becau&s;e he was a man of the <HI>ton,</HI> dre&s;&s;ed well, kept good company, and profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf her humble admirer. He married her, becau&s;e &s;he was reckoned pretty, danced well, was a toa&s;t, and was as much in the fa&s;hion as he was. As they went together without affection, &s;o neither of them allowed their love to be trouble&s;ome to the other. Plea&s;ure, di&s;|&s;ipation, &s;how, was the ta&s;te of both. Lothario was &s;ome|times at home, and in his wife's company; but then it was only in a crowd, and amid&s;t a variety of gue&s;ts. Abroad they &s;ometimes met at dinner and &s;upper parties; but as frequently their parties were not the &s;ame, and their amu&s;ements lay in different quarters.</P>
<P>Such a life of di&s;&s;ipation could not be &s;upported without great expen&s;e. Though Lothario was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con|&s;iderable land-e&s;tate, yet when he &s;ucceeded to it, it was much encumbered with debt; and that debt was now great|ly increa&s;ed by his own extravagance. Every year made a new bond or mortgage nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Cleora knew all this; but &s;he allowed it not to make any impre&s;&s;ion on her mind. It was too &s;erious a &s;ubject,
<PB N="158" REF="031725_0157_0FEE1F6FD1E8ABC8">
to be &s;uffered to intrude it&s;elf in the mid&s;t of her enjoy|ments. The mother of a numerous family, &s;he is equally inattentive with Lothario, to giving them proper habits and impre&s;&s;ions. The boys neglecting every u&s;eful branch of &s;tudy, by a &s;trange combination are both beaux and blackguards. At public places they are reckoned fa&s;hion|able, whil&s;t, at the &s;ame time, in their private amu&s;ements, they value them&s;elves on their coar&s;ene&s;s and intemperance. The daughters are now come to the age of women; but Cleora has no other object as to them, than to increa&s;e their fondne&s;s for public places and late hours: devoted to the&s;e her&s;elf, &s;he makes her daughters the pretext for her own indulgencies.</P>
<P>Thus Cleora, if &s;he were to think, if &s;he were to &s;top her cour&s;e of di&s;&s;ipation for a moment, would &s;ee bank|ruptcy at hand, and her children, if not her&s;elf and hu&s;|band, reduced to want; her children brought up without education, and initiated in nothing but the ways of idle|ne&s;s and folly. With all this, Cleora retains a good char|acter in the world: her cheerfulne&s;s, her gaiety, make her a favourite wherever &s;he goes. "'Tis a pity," it is &s;ometimes &s;aid, "that her hu&s;band was not more atten|tive to her and her children; but it is not her fault. She is indeed to be commended for &s;ubmitting with &s;o much ea&s;e to her fate; one would never di&s;cover that &s;he was married to Lothario." Such is the general character which Cleora bears; and if any one expre&s;&s;es a hint to the contrary, it is con&s;idered as the remark of a per&s;on willing to be cen&s;orious.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I contra&s;t with Cleora the conduct of <HI>Aure|lia?</HI> She al&s;o married young, before &s;he had learned to feel and judge for her&s;elf, and at a time when &s;he was entirely given up to the direction and di&s;po&s;al of her pa|rents. It has unfortunately been the fate of &s;ome of the be&s;t of women, to become the wives of men in many re|&s;pects their inferiors, both in under&s;tanding and in charac|ter. Amid&s;t the chances of life, the intricacies of &s;itua|tion, or from the deception of minds who&s;e very virtues betray their caution, this will &s;ometimes happen.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="031725_0158_0FEE1F715B302CB0"><HI>Cleanthes,</HI> the hu&s;band of Aurelia, is of a character very &s;imilar to that of Cleora's hu&s;band, Lothario, and on many accounts an unfortunate match for Aurelia. But Cleanthes being reputed to be a man of fortune, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a good addre&s;s, and <HI>believed</HI> to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good nature, it was the fate of Aurelia to be joined to him for life. Tho&s;e habits of thoughtle&s;sne&s;s and extravagance, howev|er, which Cleanthes had acquired before marriage, never for&s;ook him: he even became indifferent and negligent of Aurelia, and a fine family of children which &s;he brought him. Intemperate in his plea&s;ures, and inordinate in his expen&s;e, he plunged headlong into every fa&s;hionable folly, into every &s;pecies of di&s;&s;ipation. Aurelia felt much angui&s;h at this conduct of her hu&s;band. She endeavoured, by every gentle method in her power, to reclaim him, and to gain his mind to virtue and dome&s;tic enjoyment. All her ef|forts proved ineffectual. Cleanthes was not yet, however, &s;o lo&s;t as not to feel, at times, the reproaches of his con|&s;cience; but, in&s;tead of aiming to remove, he tried to avoid them. In this &s;ituation, Aurelia was like another con&s;cience: the reflection on her quiet and gentle virtues was like a mirror, that did but &s;hew him his own ugline&s;s; and, frightened at the &s;ight, he only thought how to e&s;cape it. Thus abandoned by him&s;elf, thus having for&s;aken Au|relia, and every better feeling, he has gone more and more headlong into vice&mdash;intemperance has become his companion, and expen&s;e much beyond his income has attended it.</P>
<P>What a &s;ituation for Aurelia! With a mind fitted for every dome&s;tic enjoyment, &s;he &s;ees her hu&s;band a prey to folly and extravagance, ruining his fortune, and dead to every proper &s;entiment. One only comfort remains&mdash;the plea&s;ure &s;he receives from her children. Her only &s;on, who promi&s;es to be all a parent could wi&s;h, has been placed at a di&s;tant academy; and a rich uncle, who has no children of his own, has adopted him as his &s;on. Her three daugh|ters live with her&s;elf, and her great object is, to educate and in&s;truct them; and in this &s;he is well rewarded, by the appearance of their promi&s;ing virtues, and the di&s;play of their opening talents.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="031725_0159_0FEE1F72E2AA0DD0">With all the&s;e amiable parts of Aurelia's conduct, ju&s;tice is not done her in the opinion of the world. Her virtues are unknown, or pa&s;s unnoticed. It is frequently &s;aid, that "Cleanthes is a good fellow&mdash;Pity he had not a wife of a le&s;s grave di&s;po&s;ition, more &s;uited to his ta&s;te. If he had, he might have been le&s;s expen&s;ive, and his plea&s;ures been more fixed at home." It was but the other evening, that, making a cour&s;e of vi&s;its, I called at a hou&s;e, where I found Cleora engaged in deep play, and her elde&s;t daugh|ter &s;itting by her, attending to the game. At that moment Lothario happened to come into the room. He drew a chair near &s;ome ladies at another table, and gave a nod of indifference to his daughter. "La! Sir," &s;aid Mi&s;s, "we did not look for you; we thought you were at Mr.&mdash;." Her mother gave one look behind; a&s;ked her partner, if &s;he had not held the king; and then de&s;ired her to &s;et up two by honours and the odd trick.</P>
<P>The &s;ame evening I called at the hou&s;e of Cleanthes. Him I found abroad, but Aurelia was at home. I was &s;hewn into the room, where &s;he was, &s;eated with her three girls around her. On the table lay &s;everal books, among which were the <HI>Spectator,</HI> the <HI>Man of Feeling,</HI> and the <HI>The|atre of Education.</HI> She her&s;elf was bu&s;y with her needle; and her two younge&s;t girls were occupied in the &s;ame man|ner, under her direction. The elde&s;t was employed in read|ing. When I entered the room, one of the girls took me by the hand, and kindly welcomed me. "I thought, how|ever," &s;aid &s;he, with a mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive look, "it had been papa; my mamma expected him." A tear &s;tarted into Au|relia's eye. She &s;oon, however, re&s;umed her cheerfulne&s;s; and I remained for a con&s;iderable time in this dome&s;tic par|ty, receiving a plea&s;ure, which I cannot de&s;cribe, in the con|ver&s;ation of Aurelia, the amiablene&s;s and propriety of her conduct, her behaviour to her children, and theirs to her.</P>
<P>When I came home, I could not help reflecting on the different characters of Aurelia and Cleora, placed in &s;itu|ations not di&s;&s;imilar; one drawing from her very want of feeling and of duty, the &s;uffrage of the world! the other, from the very exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted virtue, &s;uf|fering its neglect, and incurring its cen&s;ure! Yet with all

her afflictions and all her &s;orrows, who would not rather wi&s;h to be the &s;uffering and virtuous Aurelia, than the gay and thoughtle&s;s Cleora? The one may enjoy the di&s;&s;ipation of the world, and the good liking of its votaries; but the other mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s that approbation from her own mind, which infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;es all the external enjoyments, which the world is able to be&s;tow.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the peru&s;al of hi&s;tory, or of the more limited pictures which biography pre&s;ents to us, there is no reader who does not take a warm intere&s;t in every thing that regards a truly de&s;erving character; who does not feel a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure in tho&s;e in&s;tances where the benevolent purpo&s;es of &s;uch a per&s;on have been attended with &s;ucce&s;s, or his virtuous actions followed by reward. This approbation paid to virtue is a tribute of the heart, which is given with ea&s;e, which is be&s;towed even with plea&s;ure. But in life it&s;elf, it is unhappily found, that virtue has not the &s;ame concomitant approbation.</P>
<P>This contra&s;t of opinions is never &s;o perceptible, as when, on the death of a per&s;on, who was well known to us, we compare the idea we formed of his character when alive, with that which we now entertain of him. His excellencies and defects are now more impartially e&s;tima|ted. On the former, the memory dwells with peculiar &s;ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">faction, and indulges a melancholy plea&s;ure, in be&s;tow|ing its tribute of approbation. On the latter, we kindly throw the veil of charitable alleviation: we reflect on our own imbecility; we find apologies for another in the weakne&s;s of our own nature, and impute the error of the individual to the imperfection of the &s;pecies.</P>
<P>But above all, &s;hould it happen, that the per&s;on thus removed by death was one, who had approved him&s;elf our friend, and who&s;e kind affections we had repeatedly ex|perienced; the difference we now perceive in our e&s;timate of &s;uch a character, is apt to &s;trike the mind with the mo&s;t
<PB N="163" REF="031725_0162_0FEE1F80A0353188">
forcible conviction of our own unworthine&s;s. Memory is indu&s;trious to torment us with numberle&s;s in&s;tances of merit we have overlooked, of kindne&s;s we have not re|turned, of &s;ervices repaid with cold neglect. The injury we have done is aggravated by the reflection, that it can|not be repaired; for he who&s;e life was perhaps embittered by our ingratitude, is now in&s;en&s;ible to our contrition.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir! the man who now writes to you bears wit|ne&s;s him&s;elf to the mi&s;ery of that feeling, which he de|&s;cribes. He, who now addre&s;&s;es you, was once ble&s;&s;ed with the affection of the be&s;t, the mo&s;t amiable of women. When I married my Maria, engaged to her by that e&s;teem, which an acquaintance almo&s;t from infancy had produced, I knew not half her worth. The &s;ituation in which &s;he was now placed, brought to my view many points of ex|cellence, which before were undi&s;covered. Mu&s;t I own to my &s;hame, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this trea&s;ure dimini&s;hed its value? Fool that I was! I knew not my own hap|pine&s;s, till I had forever lo&s;t it. Six years were the &s;hort period of our union. Would to Heaven that term were yet to live again! I loved Maria. Severely as I am now di&s;po&s;ed to review my pa&s;t conduct, I cannot re|proach my&s;elf with a failure in affection. But what hu|man being could have been in&s;en&s;ible to loveline&s;s, to worth, to tenderne&s;s like hers! Poor was that affection, which often preferred the mo&s;t trivial &s;elfi&s;h gratification to her wi&s;hes or reque&s;ts; and of &s;mall value was that re|gard, which a &s;udden gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion could, at times, en|tirely obliterate.</P>
<P>It was my character, Sir, as that of many, to &s;ee the path of duty and propriety, but to have the weakne&s;s to be forever deviating from it. Educated in a re&s;pectable &s;phere of life, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a narrow income, which with &s;trict economy was barely &s;ufficient to maintain with de|cency, that &s;tation which we occupied, it was the care of my Maria to &s;uperintend her&s;elf the minute&s;t article of our dome&s;tic concerns, and thus to retrench a variety of the ordinary expen&s;es of a family, from her own perfect &s;kill in every u&s;eful accompli&s;hment of her &s;ex. Though fond of &s;ociety, and formed to &s;hine in it; though not in|&s;en&s;ible
<PB N="164" REF="031725_0163_0FEE1F8227370060">
to admiration; (and what woman with her graces of per&s;on could have been in&s;en&s;ible to it?) though po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the becoming pride of appearing among her equals with equal advantages of dre&s;s and ornament; &s;he &s;paringly indulged in gratifications, which ill accorded with our limit|ed fortune. She weighed with admirable di&s;cretion the greater again&s;t the le&s;s duties of life, and made no &s;cruple to &s;acrifice the one, when they interfered ever &s;o little with the performances of the other.</P>
<P>Shall I own, that to me, thoughtle&s;s, extravagant and vain, the conduct of this excellent woman appeared often|er to merit blame than approbation! Regardle&s;s of con|&s;equences, and carele&s;s of the future whil&s;t I enjoyed the pre&s;ent, I cen&s;ured that moderation, which was a continu|al reproach to my own profu&s;ene&s;s. Incapable of imitat|ing her example, I denied that it was meritorious; and what in her was real magnanimity, I, with equal weak|ne&s;s and ingratitude, attributed to poorne&s;s of &s;pirit. How &s;hall I de&s;cribe to you, Sir, her mild and gentle demean|our, the patience with which &s;he bore the mo&s;t unmerited reproofs, the tender &s;olicitude and endearing efforts which &s;he u&s;ed, to wean me from tho&s;e ruinous indulgencies, to which vanity or appetite was continually prompting me! Too often were the&s;e efforts repaid by me with &s;plenetic indifference, or checked at once by &s;arca&s;m or by anger.</P>
<P>It is but a poor alleviation of the angui&s;h I feel from the&s;e reflections, to remember, that, even whil&s;t my Maria lived, the e&s;teem which I &s;incerely felt for her virtues, the affection which I really bore her, and the &s;en&s;e I had of her tenderne&s;s, wrung my heart at times with the deep|e&s;t remor&s;e, and prompted me to atone for my inju&s;tice, by the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s and regard. Many a time, Sir, in tho&s;e tranquil moments, when no wayward inclination or peevi&s;h humour overpowered my better feel|ings, have I firmly re&s;olved, that my future conduct &s;hould make ample reparation for the offences of the pa&s;t. Nor were the&s;e re&s;olutions altogether fruitle&s;s; for whil&s;t un|der the influence of this &s;alutary conviction of my errors, I have &s;o far amended them as to feel for a time a genuine reli&s;h for calm and dome&s;tic happine&s;s. But how &s;hort
<PB N="165" REF="031725_0164_0FEE1F83AEA8A038">
the dawning of amendment! A new temptation pre&s;ent|ed it&s;elf, and my weak re&s;olution yielded to the force of returning pa&s;&s;ion. With my former errors I re&s;umed the de&s;picable pride of ju&s;tifying them, and every deviation from duty was aggravated by har&s;hne&s;s and ill humour.</P>
<P>Ever offending, and ever purpo&s;ing to atone for my of|fences, I have now irretrievably lo&s;t the opportunity. That be&s;t of women is now no more. I have received her late&s;t breath, and heard her la&s;t &s;upplication, which was a prayer to Heaven to pour its ble&s;&s;ings on the mo&s;t unworthy of men.</P>

<P>THAT logic, ethics, phy&s;ics, and metaphy&s;ics, &s;hould be exalted to the dignity of arts or &s;ciences, excites no &s;urpri&s;e; but that the art of managing a hou&s;e and fami|ly &s;hould be placed on a level with them, appears rather wonderful. Yet it is certain that Economics were taught as a &s;chola&s;tic &s;cience by the ancient philo&s;ophers; and there &s;till remains a very curious book, in which Xenophon has recorded the doctrines of Socrates on the &s;ubject of economy. At fir&s;t &s;ight one is apt to imagine, that phi|lo&s;ophy has departed from her province, when &s;he enters on dome&s;tic management; and that it would be ridiculous to &s;end a hou&s;ekeeper to Socrates for the improvement of good hou&s;ewifery; yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that there is in the work of Xenophon nothing of impertinence, but a great deal of good &s;en&s;e mo&s;t elegantly expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the air of &s;uperiority which is a&s;&s;umed by logic, phy&s;ics, and metaphy&s;ics, yet, con&s;idering the influ|ence on human happine&s;s, the greate&s;t value &s;hould be placed on economics; for the others, as they are treated in the &s;chools, are little more than &s;peculations, and have but a very limited influence either on the regulation or the enjoyment of life. But the true <HI>pater familias,</HI> or ma&s;ter of a family, is one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters in &s;o|ciety; and the &s;cience which directs his conduct, or re|forms his mi&s;takes, is entitled to peculiar e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Much of the mi&s;ery which prevails in the world, is ju&s;tly to be imputed to the want of economy. But the word, economy, is u&s;ually mi&s;under&s;tood. It is confined in its meaning to par&s;imony, though it undoubtedly com|prehends every thing which relates to the conduct of a family. Frugality is indeed a very con&s;iderable part of it; but not the whole. It is the judicious government of a little community inhabiting one hou&s;e, and u&s;ually allied by all the &s;oft bands of affinity and con&s;anguinity. The
<PB N="167" REF="031725_0166_0FEE1F8C3AB812F0">
per&s;on who executes &s;uch a government, &s;hould be emi|nently, furni&s;hed with prudence and benevolence.</P>
<P>The rage for fa&s;hionable levities, which has pervaded even the lower ranks, is &s;ingularly adver&s;e to the knowl|edge and the virtues which dome&s;tic life demands. Dre&s;s occupies the greater part both of the time and attention of many; and the con&s;equence is, too often, ruin in polite life, bankruptcy in the commercial, and mi&s;ery and di&s;grace to all.</P>
<P>It might be attended with great advantage to the com|munity, and to the happine&s;s of particular per&s;ons, if &s;ome part of the time and attention be&s;towed on the ornamental parts of education, were transferred to tho&s;e arts, which teach the prudent management of dome&s;tic concerns. The care of children in the age of infancy requires con&s;iderable &s;kill as well as tenderne&s;s; and how &s;hould &s;he know how to enter upon it, who&s;e whole time has been &s;pent in learn|ing the polite accompli&s;hments, which, though they add much to gracefulne&s;s, make no preten&s;ions to utility? She mu&s;t be guided entirely by &s;ervants, nur&s;es, and medical practitioners; but &s;urely it would be &s;afer and plea&s;anter to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch a &s;kill, as &s;hould prevent her from lying en|tirely at the mercy of ignorance, vanity, officiou&s;ne&s;s, and pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>As to mu&s;ic, which &s;ome ladies &s;pend &s;o much time in learning, it is well known that they &s;eldom practi&s;e it, when they have entered into the married &s;tate. Many other feminine accompli&s;hments there are, which cea&s;e to attract attention, when once their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors are engaged in the care of a family. It is therefore probable, that the time con&s;umed in the acqui&s;ition of things, which are con|fe&s;&s;edly of no u&s;e to them, might be employed in acquiring &s;uch knowledge as would enable them to contribute great|ly to the happine&s;s of the man, to whom they &s;hould give their hands and hearts, and of the children which might be the pledges of their conjugal love.</P>
<P>I by no means refer them to Xenophon or Socrates for in&s;truction in dome&s;tic management. Their own parents &s;hould communicate the re&s;ult of their experience and ob|&s;ervation on the &s;ubject. Above all, they &s;hould in&s;pire
<PB N="168" REF="031725_0167_0FEE1F8F97676CB0">
them with a love of home, and the plea&s;ures and virtues of an affectionate family a&s;&s;ociation. Some men, who appear to be in&s;en&s;ible to female charms, allege in excu&s;e for their not &s;oliciting &s;ome lady in marriage, that &s;uch are the ex|pen&s;ive manners, dre&s;s, and amu&s;ements of the fa&s;hionable part of the &s;ex, &s;o little their &s;kill in conducting a family, and &s;uch their ignorance of economy, that to be married is often to be ruined even in the mid&s;t of affluence. The viciou&s;ne&s;s of too many among the &s;ex enables vicious men to gratify their de&s;ires at a &s;mall expen&s;e. Few are wil|ling to incur the danger of di&s;&s;ipating their fortunes in &s;up|porting a woman, who can contribute nothing to the allevi|ation of their cares by dome&s;tic prudence and di&s;creet economy.</P>
<P>In every view it appears mo&s;t clearly, that nothing would contribute more to the happine&s;s of females, and in|deed of men and families in general, than a cultivation of that uno&s;tentatious knowledge, which is in hourly reque&s;t, and without which there can be little permanent &s;ecurity in the mo&s;t exalted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ank, and mo&s;t abundant affluence.

<HEAD>A letter to a very good-natured lady, that is married to a very ill-natured man.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE now and then ob&s;erved, my deare&s;t cou&s;in, (through all your cares and endeavours to conceal it) that there are &s;ome few rufflings that happen between you and your hu&s;band; and which, I fear, mu&s;t make &s;ome moments pa&s;s with more unea&s;ine&s;s to you, than a woman of &s;o much goodne&s;s de&s;erves. The friend&s;hip that has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;o long between our families, and the great affec|tion I have for you, make this give me more pain than it may perhaps give even to your&s;elf; for I know the &s;teadine&s;s of your mind, and the prudence you have in alleviating every thing that would di&s;turb a le&s;s &s;ettled temper; and make &s;ome wives fly out into violences, that would render them ridiculous as well as wretched. But as an indifferent &s;tander-by may &s;ee more than the be&s;t game&s;ter, when engaged deep in a difficult party, I &s;hall venture to give you &s;ome of my &s;entiments, in hopes that they may &s;till more awaken your own, or at lea&s;t be im|proved by your reflections upon them.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;hed, that all married people would lay this down for their fir&s;t and great principle; that they can never be happy in them&s;elves, unle&s;s they are well with their partners. Their connexions, views, and inter|e&s;ts are naturally &s;o united, that the one cannot be happy, if the other is mi&s;erable. In &s;o &s;trict an union, if you are not well with one another, what can you do to avoid being mi&s;erable? You mu&s;t either be perpetually hunting after rea&s;ons to fly from your own hou&s;e; or el&s;e you mu&s;t &s;it

jarring together, like a couple of bad in&s;truments that are almo&s;t always out of tune.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary thing then for a married woman, to make her&s;elf happy, is to endeavour to plea&s;e her hu&s;band; and one comfort is, that the very endeavouring to plea&s;e, goes a great way towards obtaining its end. Complacency as naturally begets kindne&s;s, as a di&s;obliging behaviour does aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Tis not enough to avoid doing or &s;aying any thing that you know would be di&s;agreeable to your hu&s;band; but one &s;hould be inclined to do or &s;ay every thing that is likely to be agreeable to him. A woman that thoroughly con|&s;iders this, and puts it in practice, can &s;carcely ever fail of making both her hu&s;band and her&s;elf happy.</P>
<P>One con&s;iderable help and advantage that you have to|wards this, is the being &s;o thoroughly acquainted with one another's tempers and inclinations. There is a good deal of opportunity for this (if your match was not huddled up with that ha&s;te which &s;ome people are in, for &s;ettling the mo&s;t important &s;tep in their whole lives) during the time of court&s;hip; and u&s;ually much more after: the&s;e two lights are &s;o very different, that between them you may &s;ee into the whole character of a man, how far he is ready to &s;ubmit, and how far to domineer. With a proper ob&s;er|vation, you may come, in time, to di&s;cover every bent of his temper, and to open all the more hidden folds of his heart. Now, when one is well aware of every thing that may di&s;plea&s;e, it is ea&s;y to avoid it; and, when one knows what is plea&s;ing, &s;carcely any thing can be wanting but the will to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I would particularly de&s;ire you to look on nothing, that may di&s;plea&s;e, as a trifle. However unimportant the thing may be in it&s;elf, the di&s;plea&s;ing and di&s;agreeing is a &s;erious evil; and married people differ much oftener about trifles than about things of weight. Let either hu&s;bands or wives recollect a little, and I fear they will find what I &s;ay to be more true than they might at fir&s;t imagine it to have been.</P>
<P>The be&s;t way for a married woman to carry her point often, is to yield &s;ometimes. Yielding in a married

woman, is as u&s;eful as flying is to an unmarried one; for both of the&s;e methods mo&s;t naturally obtain what they &s;eem to avoid. And if a woman has any vanity (as ev|ery human creature has more or le&s;s of it in their compo|&s;ition) I think that pa&s;&s;ion might be gratified this way, as well as any other; for, to get the better of one's &s;elf is, at lea&s;t, as glorious as to get the better of any other per&s;on whatever; and you would, be&s;ides, have the inward &s;atis|faction of con&s;idering, that, in all &s;uch ca&s;es, you do not yield out of cowardice, but prudence; and that you en|joyed the &s;uperiority of knowing what you ought to do, much better than the ob&s;tinate man, who &s;eems outwardly to have carried his point, when in reality you have carried yours.</P>
<P>I do not mean by this, to &s;et you on a life of artifice and di&s;&s;imulation. I rather think that &s;uch methods as the&s;e, and &s;uch a &s;cheme of plea&s;ing, would, in time, grow plea&s;ing to your&s;elf; and that it would be the mo&s;t likely of any, either to introduce or increa&s;e a real mutual love and good-will between you and your hu&s;band&mdash; But how, my dear cou&s;in, have I thus forgotten my&s;elf, for a page or two together! and whil&s;t I am writing to you, have real|ly written a letter for the world. For you, I dare &s;ay, have no occa&s;ion for my rules; and have thought over every thing that I have &s;aid long before I &s;et pen to paper. You will, however, forgive one who wi&s;hes you as well as he does him&s;elf; and who would mo&s;t extremely re|joice to &s;ee that &s;erenity of mind, which all the world thinks to be in you, and all tho&s;e virtues and excellencies which I know to be in you, unruffled by any di&s;turbances, and cleared even from every little cloud that may hang over them.

<P>FAMILY divi&s;ions frequently &s;pring from very im|material accidents, which gather &s;trength by repe|tition, till they are augmented in &s;o formidable a manner, as to &s;weep before them all the dome&s;tic virtues, and aboli&s;h all the amiable tenderne&s;s, for which woman was origi|nally intended by the Divine Creator. I have been a fre|quent &s;pectator of &s;uch &s;cenes of infelicity. Where I was in mo&s;t expectation of finding the cele&s;tial &s;eeds of connu|bial happine&s;s flouri&s;hing in exqui&s;ite beauty, there have I been the mo&s;t di&s;appointed. In&s;tead of beholding a para|di&s;e, I have found nothing but a garden of noxious weeds; which occa&s;ions me to make the following ob&s;ervations: for the&s;e may be u&s;eful to &s;ociety, as, by holding up the mirror of inadvertency, they may affright her with her own deformity.</P>
<P><HI>Lorenzo</HI> and <HI>Violetta</HI> have been married upwards of three years: they were equally matched, both in re&s;pect of for|tune and age; the one being &s;ufficient for the purcha&s;e, and the other for the enjoyment of the plea&s;ures of life. For &s;ome time, after the celebration of their nuptials, they entertained a reciprocal affection. She was all fondne&s;s,
<PB N="173" REF="031725_0172_0FEE1FA0896912A8">
he all indulgence. But their intimacy, in&s;tead of increa&s;|ing, dimini&s;hed their mutual regard. Her beauty, the more it was familiar to his eye, grew the le&s;s attractive to his heart; and his conver&s;ation grew le&s;s engaging, the more &s;he partook of the natural levity of her &s;ex. He renewed his Bacchanalian acquaintance, &s;he found more plea&s;ure in di&s;charging her vi&s;its than her dome&s;tic offices: in fine, both became di&s;intentionally indifferent; their meals were irregular, their conver&s;ation little; till at la&s;t, their affec|tion &s;eemed to be dwindled away to nothing but a ceremo|nious complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>Nature was &s;oon more predominant than the ties of gen|tility or the rules of decency. Their tempers were per|petually bur&s;ting from the formality of re&s;erve: trivial ac|cidents gave alternate unea&s;ine&s;s to one or the other; which were productive of &s;uch di&s;putes as often terminated in a &s;hyne&s;s for two or three days together. Though they were both &s;o far e&s;tranged from the lambent flame of love, yet their di&s;agreement frequently exhibited a convic|tion of their hone&s;ty, by a reconciliation which ju&s;t &s;erved to blow up the dormant embers of affection; though &s;till they were continually manife&s;ting the difference of their tempers. They were both ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ionate; he was &s;ometimes ill-natured, whil&s;t &s;he was too apt to conceive what he never intended. They were both &s;en&s;ible of their folly, yet they &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their ob&s;tinacy; if he &s;poke warm, &s;he reddened with the glow of anger; if he was de|&s;irous of tranquillity, &s;he grew turbulent. The vanity of pedigree and the o&s;tentation of fortune were often bandied backwards and forwards; this u&s;hered in indecency from him, and left her abandoned to a mi&s;guided pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Reiterated quarrels aggravated their imprudence: he frequently &s;wore, &s;he railed, and blows en&s;ued. She felt the effects of his violence, he bore the marks of her fury. When their pa&s;&s;ion abated, &s;he &s;at pen&s;ively venting the gu&s;hing &s;orrows from her eyes; he grew mollified, and af|ter innumerable care&s;&s;es, re-compo&s;ed her agitated &s;pirits. The quarrel renewed their tenderne&s;s; they gently up|braided them&s;elves, confe&s;&s;ed their folly, re&s;olved to op|po&s;e the excur&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion, and for &s;ome time lived
<PB N="174" REF="031725_0173_0FEE1FA210A638E8">
with all the appearance of a durable felicity. But when pa&s;&s;ion has once got the head, rea&s;on vainly attempts to guide the rein. Though Lorenzo and Violetta, on the repetition of every quarrel, became &s;en&s;ible of their &s;moth|ered affection, yet they never endeavoured to light up the extingui&s;hed lamp of HYMEN. They continued their in|temperate &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and were at la&s;t &s;o habituated to &s;uch an ignomi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;tom, as to give an unbounded loo&s;e to their pa&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> company, till they are now become the de|ri&s;ion of all their acquaintances.</P>
<P>As I have a regard for Lorenzo, I have taken an op|portunity of expatiating with him upon his &s;candalous indi&s;|cretion; he acknowledges his imprudence, profe&s;&s;es the &s;tronge&s;t affection for his wife, and &s;olemnly avows his fi|delity to the nuptial bed. Violetta is al&s;o &s;en&s;ible of her erroneous behaviour, e&s;teems her hu&s;band, and wears the throne of cha&s;tity on her brow. They are equally con|&s;cious of their fault, are equally &s;orry for it, and &s;eem equally de&s;irous of correcting it; but they are &s;o ab&s;olutely devoted to the &s;torms of pa&s;&s;ion, as to be equally incapable of executing tho&s;e &s;alutary re&s;olutions, which they are thor|oughly &s;en&s;ible can alone give plea&s;ure to the bridal bed, happine&s;s to the prime of life, and comfort to the declen&s;ion of age.</P>
<P>What a melancholy reflection is this! That two per&s;ons, once united by the &s;ilken band of love, &s;hould &s;o di&s;own its empire, for the gratification of &s;ome ridiculous humour, is mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing! that two per&s;ons, who could &s;o ea&s;ily enjoy the beatitudes of life, &s;hould &s;o voluntarily bani&s;h them&s;elves from the flowery road of happine&s;s, is amazing! but their conduct &s;erves only to evince this golden maxim, "That rea&s;on is the be&s;t gift of nature;" for without her &s;acred influence, monarchs in their palaces are le&s;s happy than pea&s;ants in their cottages.</P>

<P>AS the attainment of happine&s;s is the grand &s;pring of human action, I have been often &s;urpri&s;ed at that inattention, &s;o apparent in the generality of mankind, to the mo&s;t important concern in their lives, the choice of a wife; a choice, on which not only their pre&s;ent welfare, but even their everla&s;ting felicity may depend. Indeed, if we may judge from the &s;light regard paid to an object of &s;o much moment, we may &s;uppo&s;e it commonly under|&s;tood to be a trivial point, in which little or no reflection is requi&s;ite; or that fortune and beauty were in them&s;elves whatever was e&s;&s;ential to the happine&s;s of the conjugal &s;tate. But let tho&s;e, who, in the ardour of unreflecting youth, form &s;uch gay vi&s;ions of &s;plendid enjoyments, and everla&s;ting pa&s;&s;ion, con&s;ider,&mdash;that there are requi&s;ites of a nobler kind, without which, when it may be too late, they may find them&s;elves involved in irretrievable ruin.</P>
<P>What melancholy hi&s;tories have been recorded, where manly virtue has been united to a fortune and to mi&s;ery; blooming loveline&s;s &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of avarice; or unthinking youth, &s;mitten by exterior charms alone, in&s;tead of the attracting graces of mode&s;ty, &s;entiment, and di&s;|cretion, has become a voluntary victim to in&s;ipid, if not to meretricious beauty! I would not be under&s;tood, however, as though I apprehended, that beauty and fortune are of no e&s;timation. The former, when united to piety, virtue, and good &s;en&s;e, can be flighted by tho&s;e only who are devoid of any ideas of whatever is lovely and excellent in nature; and fortune, or at lea&s;t a competence, is ab&s;o|lutely
<PB N="176" REF="031725_0175_0FEE1FA51FBC0600">
nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince without it the highe&s;t degree of vir|tue, and the mo&s;t enchanting graces, will be in&s;ufficient to in&s;ure happine&s;s in the conjugal union:
<Q><L>"Let rea&s;on teach what pa&s;&s;ion fain would hide,</L>
<L>That Hymen's bands by prudence &s;hould be ty'd.</L>
<L>Venus in vain the wedded pair would crown,</L>
<L>If angry fortune on their union frown:</L>
<L>Soon will the flatt'ring dream of bli&s;s be o'er,</L>
<L>And cloy'd imagination cheat no more;</L>
<L>Then waking to the &s;en&s;e of la&s;ting pain,</L>
<L>With mutual tears the nuptial couch they &s;tain;</L>
<L>And that fond love, which &s;hould afford relief,</L>
<L>Does but increa&s;e the angui&s;h of their grief;</L>
<L>Whil&s;t both could ea&s;ier their own &s;orrows bear,</L>
<L>Than the &s;ad knowledge of each other's care."</L>
<BIBL>LYTTLETON.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Certainly no prudent per&s;on ought to engage in the married &s;tate without a &s;ufficiency of means for a comfort|able &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. That lover cannot regard his mi&s;tre&s;s with virtuous pa&s;&s;ion, who would involve her in all the po&s;&s;ible con&s;equences of reciprocal poverty. True love never forgets the happine&s;s of its object; for when this cea&s;es to be regarded, it is not the generous tenderne&s;s of love, but the unthinking wildne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations, however, cannot obviate the ju&s;t complaints, which may be made again&s;t tho&s;e matches, in which beauty, or fortune only are regarded "Beauty," &s;ays Lord Kaimes, "is a dangerous property, tending to corrupt the mind of a wife, though it &s;oon lo&s;es its influ|ence over the hu&s;band. A figure agreeable and engaging, which in&s;pires affection without the ebriety of love, is a much &s;afer choice. The graces lo&s;e not their influence like beauty. At the end of thirty years, a virtuous wom|an, who makes an agreeable companion, charms her hu&s;|band perhaps more than at fir&s;t. The compari&s;on of love to fire holds good in one re&s;pect, that the fiercer it burns, the &s;ooner it is extingui&s;hed."</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="031725_0176_0FEE1FAFE7D67C80">It is unque&s;tionably true, that happine&s;s in the married &s;tate depends not on riches, nor on beauty, but on virtue, good &s;en&s;e, and &s;weetne&s;s of temper. A young man who has him&s;elf a &s;ufficient fortune, &s;hould not always look for an equivalent of that kind in the object of his love. "Who can find a virtuous woman," &s;ays Solomon, "for her price is far above rubies?" The important object of his inquiry is, not whether &s;he has riches, but whether &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es tho&s;e qualifications, which naturally form the amiable wife and the exemplary mother? In like manner, would a parent conduct his daughter to a wi&s;e and ju|dicous choice of a hu&s;band, he will not &s;o much recom|mend the nece&s;&s;ity of a fortune, as of virtuous conduct, good temper, di&s;cretion, regularity, and indu&s;try. With the&s;e, a hu&s;band, if he be of a reputable profe&s;&s;ion, may improve the fortune of his wife, and render it of much greater advantage to each other, than the mo&s;t ample equivalent in money, with the rever&s;e of the&s;e qualities.</P>
<P>On the contrary, where intere&s;t pervades the bo&s;om, and is the &s;ole motive to union, what can more naturally be expected than unhappy matches? Without a certain con|geniality of &s;entiment, independent of the adventitious circum&s;tances of beauty, or fortune, the connubial &s;tate is the very oppo&s;ite of a heaven. Home becomes di&s;agree|able, where there is a diver&s;ity of ta&s;te, temper, and wi&s;h|es; or where tho&s;e mental re&s;ources are wanting which invite to conver&s;ation, and render it delightful and endear|ing. The &s;cenes of wretchedne&s;s, in&s;eparable from &s;uch a &s;tate, mu&s;t be obvious to every mind.</P>
<P>We turn with plea&s;ure to the exqui&s;ite happine&s;s, which is the re&s;ult of a virtuous choice. Home is then delight|ful, and every moment is replete with &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>But without dwelling longer on this charming theme, permit me to a&s;k, Who would &s;acrifice the enjoyment of &s;uch felicity, for wealth?&mdash;What weakne&s;s of mind does it betray, to forfeit "the matchle&s;s joys of virtuous love," for the ideal plea&s;ures of affluence!</P>

<P>OF all the plea&s;ures that endear human life, there are none more worthy the attention of a rational crea|ture, than tho&s;e that flow from the mutual return of con|jugal love. Our great poet MILTON, after he has de|&s;cribed the nuptial bower of ADAM and EVE in Para|di&s;e, thus calls upon that bli&s;sful &s;tate.</P>
<Q><L>Hail, wedded love! my&s;terious law, true &s;ource.</L>
<L>Of human offspring, &s;ole propriety</L>
<L>In Paradi&s;e, of all things common el&s;e.</L>
<L>By thee adulterous lu&s;t was driven from men,</L>
<L>Among the be&s;tial herds to range; by thee</L>
<L>(Founded in rea&s;on, loyal, ju&s;t and pure)</L>
<L>Relations dear, and all the charities</L>
<L>Of father, &s;on and brother fir&s;t were known.</L>
<L>&mdash;Perpetual fountain of dome&s;tic bli&s;s!&mdash;</L>
<L>Here love his golden &s;hafts employs; here lights</L>
<L>His con&s;tant lamp, and waves his purple wings.</L></Q>
<P>In this &s;cene the loo&s;er pa&s;&s;ions of youth are con&s;olidat|ed into a &s;ettled affection: for the lawful object of love unites every care in it&s;elf; and makes even tho&s;e thoughts that were painful before, become delightful. When two minds are thus engaged by the ties of reciprocal &s;incerity, each alternately receives and communicates a tran&s;port, that is inconceivable to all but tho&s;e that are in this &s;itua|tion: from hence ari&s;es that heart-ennobling &s;olicitude for one another's welfare, that tender &s;ympathy that alleviates affliction, and that participated plea&s;ure which heightens pro&s;perity and joy it&s;elf. This is a full completion of the ble&s;&s;ings of humanity! for if rea&s;on and &s;ociety are the characteri&s;tics, which di&s;tingui&s;h us from other animals, an excellence in the&s;e two great privileges of man, which centres in wedlock, mu&s;t rai&s;e us in happine&s;s above the
<PB N="179" REF="031725_0178_0FEE1FB2F5CFB9F0">
re&s;t of our &s;pecies. It is here that the noble&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, of which the human &s;oul is &s;u&s;ceptible, join together, virtuous love and friend&s;hip; the one &s;upplying it with a con&s;tant rapture, and the other regulating it by the rules of rea&s;on. I would not be under&s;tood to be &s;peaking here of tho&s;e un|natural and di&s;proportionable matches that are daily made upon worldly views, where intere&s;t or lu&s;t are the only motives; I mean that &s;uch only enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing, who are conducted by HYMEN through his own realms of in|nocence and &s;incerity.</P>
<P>A gentleman who is very happy in a beautiful friend, and is a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;t for the married &s;tate, told me the following &s;tory of an Italian pair, who were famous for their unalterable con&s;tancy and affection. There lived at Genoa a young nobleman named MARINI, who had a large e&s;tate in the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica, whither he went every five or &s;ix years to regulate his affairs. At the age of five and twenty he was married to a beautiful lady, the daughter of a Venetian &s;enator, named MONIMIA, who had refu&s;ed the greate&s;t matches in Italy, to prefer the fortunate MARINI. As their marriage was founded upon a mutual e&s;teem, their pa&s;&s;ion increa&s;ed in&s;tead of dimin|i&s;hing by enjoyment, till they became an example of con|jugal duty to all who knew them. They had lived many years in this uninterrupted &s;tate of felicity, when MARINI was obliged to make a voyage to Cor&s;ica, which was then di&s;turbed by a rebellious in&s;urrection, in order to &s;ecure his patrimony, by encouraging his dependants to &s;tand firm in the defence of their country. But the greate&s;t afflic|tion, and which ab&s;orbed all the re&s;t, was his being nece&s;|&s;itated to part for a while from MONIMIA, who, being then far advanced in a &s;tate of pregnancy, was unable to go with him as u&s;ual. When the fatal time of &s;eparation was come, they embraced with the utmo&s;t grief, and the warme&s;t prayers to Heaven for one another's &s;afety. As &s;oon as this afflicting &s;cene was over, MARINI embarked, and having a fair wind, arrived &s;afe at Ba&s;tia in a few hours. The &s;ucce&s;s of the rebels being &s;topped, and the affairs of the i&s;land a little &s;ettled again, our lover began to prepare for his return to Genoa; but as he was walk|ing
<PB N="180" REF="031725_0179_0FEE1FB480FE4D90">
one day by the harbour where the &s;hips of burthen lay, he heard two &s;ailors, who were ju&s;t arrived, talking of the death of a Genoe&s;e nobleman's wife then ab&s;ent from the republic. This ca&s;ual circum&s;tance greatly alarmed him, and excited his curio&s;ity to li&s;ten farther to their conver&s;ation, when, after a little pau&s;e, he heard one of them mention the name of his dear MONIMIA. At the&s;e words, his &s;urpri&s;e and affliction were &s;o great, that he had not power to follow the mariners to &s;atisfy his doubt, but in&s;tantly &s;wooned away, and when he recovered, found him&s;elf &s;urrounded by his own &s;ervants lamenting over him. At the &s;ame time that this happened to MA|RINI, &s;omething of the &s;ame nature equally di&s;tre&s;&s;ed MO|NIMIA; for an imperfect account came to Genoa by the captain of a Venetian ve&s;&s;el, that a gentleman named MARINI had been &s;urpri&s;ed near Ba&s;tia by a remaining party of rebels, and that he and all his attendants were killed by them. The&s;e two accounts involved our unfor|tunate pair in the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; they immediately took &s;hipping in order to be convinced of what they &s;o much dreaded to know; the one for Cor&s;ica, the other for Ge|noa. They were both &s;ailed, when a violent &s;torm aro&s;e, which drove their ve&s;&s;els upon a little i&s;land in the Medi|terranean. MARINI's &s;hip landed fir&s;t, where, whil&s;t the re&s;t of the crew were refre&s;hing them&s;elves, the incon&s;ola|ble widower, as he thought him&s;elf, wandered with one &s;ervant only into a little wood, that was near the &s;ea|&s;hore, to give a loo&s;e to his immoderate grief.

Their bodies were conveyed to Italy, and were interred with all the &s;olemnity and magnificence due to their quality and eminent virtues.</P>

<HEAD>The temple of HYMEN. A VISION.</HEAD>
<P>A FEW days ago I had an account of the marriage of a friend. When occurrences of this nature make an impre&s;&s;ion upon the mind, it is in&s;en&s;ibly betrayed into little animadver&s;ions upon them. This was my c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e in an extraordinary manner: for having mu&s;ed &s;ome time on this incident, I fell into an ea&s;y &s;lumber, when fancy re|a&s;&s;umed the &s;ubject, and &s;allied out in the following ex|cur&s;ion.</P>
<P>Methought I was in an in&s;tant placed on the boundaries of a &s;pacious plain; in the centre of which was pre&s;ented to the eye a large temple con&s;ecrated to HYMEN, the god of marriage. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from me I ob&s;erved a giddy crowd of both &s;exes, who were making toward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the building, in order to celebrate the ceremony of the god. There was &s;huffled in among them a demon, who&s;e form was &s;o peculiar, and who&s;e &s;way with the multitude &s;o uni|ver&s;al, that I &s;hall give my reader a particular de&s;cription of him. It &s;eems the name of this fury was LUST; in the upper part of his body he carried the likene&s;s of a hu|man figure, from the middle downwards he bore the re|&s;emblance of a goat, his eyes were turgid, &s;parkling and in|flamed, his complexion was very irregular, attended with the mo&s;t &s;udden tran&s;itions from a &s;anguine red to a livid palene&s;s, and a tremor frequently &s;eized every member. Clo&s;e followed him DISTASTE with a &s;ickly countenance, and &s;upercilious eye; and REMORSE with his hat flapped over his face, and a worm gnawing his vitals. I was much &s;hocked at the&s;e mon&s;trous appearances, and the more &s;o, to ob&s;erve how readily my fellow creatures gave in to the impious &s;ugge&s;tions of the demon. But my &s;urpri&s;e was &s;omewhat abated on a nearer approach; for I took notice that his breath was of &s;uch a malignant nature, that all
<PB N="182" REF="031725_0181_0FEE1FBEE7615450">
tho&s;e who ra&s;hly advance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> within its influence, were pre&s;|ently intoxicated and deprived of their rea&s;on.</P>
<P>I was in &s;uch a con&s;ternation at this di&s;covery, that I he&s;itated for a while, whether I &s;hould enter into conver|&s;ation with the blithe adventurers beforementioned. In the mid&s;t of my &s;u&s;pen&s;e there came towards us a grave old gentleman of a &s;teady and compo&s;ed a&s;pect, who&s;e name was DELIBERATION. He was one of the principal agents belonging to the temple, and &s;o high in the god's e&s;teem, that HYMEN was very rarely known to give his benedic|tion at the conclu&s;ion of the ceremony to any couple, who were not u&s;hered into his pre&s;ence by this venerable offi|cer. Upon his joining the company (to the majority of which I found he was a perfect &s;tranger) there was ex|pre&s;&s;ed an univer&s;al unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;content; and many of them indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided all conver&s;ation with him. But it was very remarkable that all tho&s;e who thus impru|dently turned their backs on this valuable monitor, in their return from the temple, were &s;eized by one or both of the melancholy attendants of the fury.</P>
<P>At my entrance into the building I ob&s;erved the deity marching at a &s;mall di&s;tance towards it. The fir&s;t in the proce&s;&s;ion was LOVE, in the form of a CUPID, who was continually practi&s;ing a thou&s;and little arts and graces, to draw upon him the &s;miles of the god; and by the tender regards which HYMEN ca&s;t upon the child, I found he was a very great favourite.</P>
<P>The god followed next, holding in his hand a flaming torch, which &s;hone the brighter, the longer it burned; he approached us, &s;upported by VIRTUE, a lady of the mo&s;t engaging form that I ever beheld. She was cloathed in a white refulgent garment, and her head was encircled with glory.</P>
<P>The next attendant was BEAUTY, arrayed in the mo&s;t gorgeous apparel, and full of her&s;elf, even to di&s;traction. She was handed along by YOUTH, a gay &s;tripling, wearing a chaplet of flowers on his head and wings on his &s;houlders.</P>
<P>Then appeared WEALTH, in the figure of an old man meanly attired: his eyes were the eyes of a hawk, and his
<PB N="183" REF="031725_0182_0FEE1FC06E554460">
fingers curved and pointed inwards, like the talons of raven; he was noi&s;y, impudent and pre&s;uming.</P>
<P>The retinue was clo&s;ed by FANCY, ever varying her fea|tures and dre&s;s; and what was very extraordinary, me|thought &s;he charmed in all.</P>
<P>The deity, immediately after his entrance into the tem|ple, a&s;cended his throne; and &s;at with his head gently re|clined on VIRTUE'S bo&s;om. LOVE and BEAUTY took their &s;tation on the right hand: and on the left were di&s;|po&s;ed WEALTH and FANCY.</P>
<P>The god quickly proceeded to the celebration of the nuptial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ites; but there was &s;uch a confu&s;ed &s;ound of &s;ighs and laughter, that I could not give the atten|tion which was requi&s;ite, in order to pre&s;ent my rea|der with the &s;everal circum&s;tances that occurred: only I took notice, that many of the matches were &s;o very une|qual, that the god yoked them with reluctance, and but half con&s;ented to his own in&s;titution.</P>
<P>After the ceremony was over, &s;ilence was proclaimed in court, for HYMEN was determined to decide a conte&s;t, which had been of long &s;tanding, between the per&s;onages that attended the altar. Upon this declaration, the whole multitude divided, and according to the particular impul&s;es of their pa&s;&s;ions, took the party of the &s;everal competitors. The young had ranged them&s;elves on the right hand of the throne, whil&s;t others of more advanced years had po&s;ted them&s;elves behind the di&s;putants on the left.</P>
<P>LOVE began with entering his complaint again&s;t WEALTH, &s;etting forth that his antagoni&s;t had &s;educed large numbers to his &s;entiments; that, as to him&s;elf, his intere&s;t very vi&s;ibly declined every day, to the great prejudice of that &s;tate, in which the gods had de&s;igned him the pre|eminence. While he was pur&s;uing his arguments with great warmth, POVERTY &s;tepped forth from amid&s;t the crowd, and &s;tared the young plaintiff full in the face, who was &s;o frightened at his &s;orrowful countenance, that he fluttered his pinions in order for flight: when WEALTH, ri&s;ing up, addre&s;&s;ed the judge with &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity of his pre&s;ence to make the married &s;tate replete with hap|pine&s;s, as it was originally intended by its in&s;titutor; to|gether
<PB N="184" REF="031725_0183_0FEE1FC1F5B6FDE8">
with many other arguments, which, if they had been delivered with the &s;ame mode&s;ty as force, could not have failed of creating a multitude of converts to his &s;ide. This his &s;peech was followed with a thunder of applau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rom the company behind. Upon which incident the old man beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to triumph, and to reinforce his di&s;cour&s;es when through the violence of his emotions, his garment flew open, and betrayed to view CARES in the form of vultures hanging at his brea&s;t. Hereupon LOVE &s;tood up, and would fain have rea&s;&s;umed his cau&s;e. But HY|MEN, who well knew that the pre&s;ence of both was of the utmo&s;t importance in the performance of his in&s;titution; and impartially weighing what was urged by each of them, put an end to the contention, by propo&s;ing the union of their families, which was immediately acceded to. No &s;ooner were their hands joined, as the &s;ignal of their con&s;ent|ing to the god's propo&s;al, but LOVE immediately lighted up new &s;miles in his face, and appeared infinitely more charm|ing than before. But the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing change was wrought in the old man; his talons fell off in &s;cales from his fingers, his eyes lo&s;t all their former fiercene&s;s, and the har&s;h linea|ments of his countenance were at once &s;oftened into all the &s;weetne&s;s of humanity. LOVE approached him, and gently &s;troking his bo&s;om, &s;tilled the hi&s;&s;ing of the &s;erpents, and a&s;&s;uaged the &s;everity of his pain. This di&s;pute being amica|bly adju&s;ted, BEAUTY next advanced, and, after playing over many airs of affection, put on a langui&s;hing look, and li&s;ped out a mournful accu&s;ation al&s;o again&s;t WEALTH, intimat|ing his u&s;urpation over her, and the like. Scarcely had &s;he uttered three &s;entences, before there made up to her a gri&s;ly wight, who&s;e hair was covered with a hoary fro&s;t, his face plowed with furrows, and down his cheeks di&s;tilled a &s;cald|ing rheum. When the young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ady thus &s;aw AGE limp|ing towards her, &s;he appeared in all the agonies of thought; the ro&s;es fell from her cheeks, and &s;he &s;unk down into a &s;woon. HYMEN under&s;tanding the temper of the girl, that &s;he was proud and imperious, fond of government, and yet incapable of directing, dive&s;ted her of a large &s;hare of power, by di&s;po&s;ing of her frontier towns to FANCY,
<PB N="185" REF="031725_0184_0FEE1FC381E42180">
who now acts with unlimited authority; nor admits any to pay their addre&s;&s;es to the gay virgin, without a prior inter|view with her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The remainder of my dream being a confu&s;ed number of ideas, without order or arrangement, I &s;hall forbear to in&s;ert, in mercy to my reader.</P>

O CLEORA! you are not to be told, that inward peace of mind is the true and only &s;ource of happine&s;s: the good things of this world may improve and extend it, but are too weak to lay the foun|dation of it.

<P>WHEN you read of the marriage of your corre&s;|pondents HYMENAEUS and TRANQUILLA, we tru&s;t you will join your wi&s;hes to tho&s;e of their other friends, for the happy event of an union in which caprice and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s had &s;o little part.</P>
<P>There is at lea&s;t this rea&s;on why we &s;hould be le&s;s de|ceived in our connubial hopes than many others who enter into the &s;ame &s;tate, that we have allowed our&s;elves to form no unrea&s;onable expectations, nor vitiated our fancies in the &s;oft hours of court&s;hip, with vi&s;ions of felicity which human power cannot be&s;tow, or of perfection which human virtue cannot attain. That impartiality with which we always endeavoured to in&s;pect the manners of tho&s;e with whom we conver&s;ed, has not been &s;o much overpowered by our pa&s;|&s;ion, but that we have di&s;covered &s;ome faults and weakne&s;&s;|es in each other; and joined our hands in conviction, that as there are &s;ome advantages to be enjoyed in marriage, there are &s;ome inconveniences likewi&s;e to be endured, and that, together with confederate intellects and auxiliar vir|tues, we mu&s;t find different opinions and oppo&s;ite incli|nations.</P>
<P>We did not pa&s;s the weeks of court&s;hip like tho&s;e who con&s;ider them&s;elves as taking the la&s;t draught of plea&s;ure, and therefore re&s;olve not to quit the bowl without a &s;urfeit;
<PB N="189" REF="031725_0188_0FEE1FD2C180FE98">
or who know them&s;elves about to &s;et happine&s;s to hazard, and endeavour to lo&s;e their &s;en&s;e of danger in the ebriety of perpetual amu&s;ement, and whirl round the gulph before they &s;ink.</P>
<P>We rejoice in the reflection, that we have &s;tores of novelty yet unexhau&s;ted, which may be opened when repletion &s;hall call for change; and gratifications yet un|ta&s;ted, by which life, when it &s;hall become vapid or bitter, may be re&s;tored to its former &s;weetne&s;s and &s;prightline&s;s, and again irritate the appetite, and again &s;parkle in the cup.</P>
<P>Our life will, perhaps, be le&s;s ta&s;tele&s;s than that of tho&s;e whom the de&s;potic authority or avarice of parents unites almo&s;t without their con&s;ent in their early years, when they have accumulated no fund of reflection, nor collected any materials for mutual entertainment. Such we have often &s;een ri&s;ing in the morning to cards, and retiring in the afternoon to do&s;e; who&s;e happine&s;s was celebrated by their neighbours, becau&s;e they happened to grow rich by avarice, and to be kept quiet by in&s;en&s;ibility, and agreed to eat and &s;leep together.</P>
<P>We have both mingled with the world, and are therefore no &s;trangers to the faults and virtues, the de&s;igns and com|petitions, the hopes and fears of our cotemporaries. We have both amu&s;ed our lei&s;ure with books, and can therefore recount the events of former times, or cite the dictates of ancient wi&s;dom. Every occurrence furni&s;hes us with &s;ome hint which one or the other can improve; and if it &s;hould happen that both memory and imagination fail us, we can retire to no idle or unimproving &s;olitude.</P>
<P>Though our characters, beheld at a di&s;tance, exhibit this general re&s;emblance, yet a nearer in&s;pection di&s;covers &s;uch a di&s;&s;imilitude of our habitudes and &s;entiments, as leaves each &s;ome peculiar advantages, and affords that "concordia di&s;cors," that &s;uitable di&s;agreement, which is always nece&s;&s;ary to intellectual harmony. There may be a total diver&s;ity of ideas which admits no participation of the &s;ame delight; and there may likewi&s;e be &s;uch a con|formity of notions, as leaves neither any thing to add to the deci&s;ions of the other. With &s;uch contrariety there can be no peace, with &s;uch &s;imilarity there can be no plea&s;ure. Our rea&s;onings, though often formed upon dif|ferent
<PB N="190" REF="031725_0189_0FEE1FD7FA0E6570">
views, terminate generally in the &s;ame conclu&s;ion. Our thoughts like rivulets i&s;&s;uing from di&s;tant &s;prings, each impregnated in its cour&s;e with various mixtures, and tinged by infu&s;ions unknown to the other, yet at la&s;t ea&s;ily unite into one &s;tream, and purify them&s;elves by the gentle effer|ve&s;cence of contrary qualities.</P>
<P>The&s;e benefits we receive in a greater degree as we conver&s;e without re&s;erve, becau&s;e we have nothing to con|ceal. We have no debts to be paid by imperceptible de|ductions from our avowed expen&s;es, no habits to be indulg|ed by the private connivance of a favoured &s;ervant, no private interviews with needy relations, no intelligence with &s;pies placed upon each other. We con&s;idered mar|riage as the mo&s;t &s;olemn league of perpetual friend&s;hip, a &s;tate from which artifice and concealment are to be ban|i&s;hed forever, and in which every act of di&s;&s;imulation is a breach of faith.</P>
<P>The impetuous vivacity of youth, and that ardour of de&s;ire which the fir&s;t &s;ight of plea&s;ure naturally produces, has long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;ed to hurry us into irregularity and vehe|mence, and experience has &s;hewn us that gratifications are too valuable to be &s;acrificed to complai&s;ance. We have long thought it convenient to re&s;t from the fatigue of plea&s;ure, and now only continue that cour&s;e of life into which we had before entered, confirmed in our choice by mutual approbation, &s;upported in our re&s;olution by mu|tual encouragement, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in our efforts by mutual exhortation.</P>
<P>Such, Sir, is our pro&s;pect of life; a pro&s;pect which, as it is beheld with more attention, &s;eems to open more ex|ten&s;ive happine&s;s, and &s;preads by degrees into the boundle&s;s regions of eternity. But if all our prudence has been vain, if we are doomed to give another in&s;tance of the uncer|tainty of human di&s;cernment, we &s;hall comfort our&s;elves amid&s;t our di&s;appointments, that we were not betrayed but by &s;uch delu&s;ions as caution could not e&s;cape, &s;ince we &s;ought happine&s;s only in the arms of virtue.

<P>WHEN a marriage is completed, that takes ri&s;e from good &s;en&s;e, inclination and equality of age, dignity and fortune, the joy is diffu&s;ed through every branch of the family. The parents, the relations, the friends, ta&s;te the &s;weet effects of the happy union, and the whole &s;cene is a repre&s;entation of heaven as near as the &s;tate of mortality can come up to it; but when we turn our eyes towards the other &s;ide of matrimony, to|wards the black, the melancholy, and the tempe&s;tuous part of it, the objects are too hideous to be looked at, and the &s;ubject too di&s;mal to be delinea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who lay a&s;ide the vain de&s;ire of wealth, equipage and honours, and make virtue the main article in their treaty of marriage, take the mo&s;t proper methods to &s;ecure mutual felicity, and are generally ble&s;&s;ed with unenvied and unprecarious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oys. Too few indeed are the in&s;tances of dome&s;tic happine&s;s; and many per&s;ons of fa&s;hion think they an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of matrimony, if they can be well bred enough to keep conjugal di&s;cord within the cold decencies of a malicious civility.</P>
<P>I am perfectly convinced that nothing hinders the con|&s;tant agreement of per&s;ons in the conjugal &s;tate but vanity, a &s;ecret inclination to in&s;i&s;t upon what they think their dignity of merit, and an inward expectation of &s;uch an over mea&s;ure of deference and regard, as an&s;wers to their extravagant fal&s;e &s;cale, and which nobody can pay, becau&s;e nobody but them&s;elves can tell exactly to what pitch it amounts.</P>
<P>It cannot be conceived by tho&s;e who are involved in libertine pur&s;uits, the &s;weet &s;atisfactions that mu&s;t ari&s;e
<PB N="192" REF="031725_0191_0FEE1FE0A206A1E0">
from the union of two per&s;ons, who have left all the world, to procure delight for each other by all the methods which rea&s;on, urged by duty, forwarded by pa&s;&s;ion, can intimate to the heart. Such a pair give charms to virtue, and make plea&s;ant the ways of innocence. A deviation from the rules of &s;uch a commerce would be courting pain; for &s;uch a life is as much to be preferred to any thing that can be communicated by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">iminal &s;atisfactions, to &s;peak of it in the milde&s;t terms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;obriety and elegant conver&s;ation are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> intemperance and rioting.</P>
<P>He is a very unhappy man who does not re&s;erve the mo&s;t pure and kind affections of his heart for the marriage bed&punc; he will otherwi&s;e be reduced to this melancholy circum&s;tance, that he gave his mi&s;tre&s;s that kind of affec|tion which was proper for his wife, and has not for his wife either that, or the u&s;ual tenderne&s;s which men be&s;tow upon their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Married per&s;ons are both more warm in their love, and more hearty in their hatred, than any others what&s;oever. Mutual favours and obligations, which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be greater here than in any other &s;tate, naturally beget an inten&s;e affection in generous minds. As, on the con|trary, per&s;ons who have be&s;towed &s;uch favours have a par|ticular bitterne&s;s in their re&s;entments, when they think them&s;elves ill treated by tho&s;e of whom they have de&s;erv|ed &s;o much.</P>
<P>IF MARRIED PEOPLE RECEIVED EVERY TOKEN OF REGARD, AND ALL THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE NE|CESSARY TO MUTUAL HAPPINESS, AS FAVOURS, NOT AS DUTIES, AND APPEARED GRATEFUL INSTEAD OF SILENTLY CONTENTED, IT WOULD PRESERVE THE DESIRE OF OBLIGING, AND GIVE A SPIRIT TO EVERY DUTY.</P>
<P>It perhaps requires more virtues to make a good hu&s;|band or wife, than to fini&s;h the mo&s;t &s;hining character whatever.</P>
<P>Di&s;cretion &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and accordingly we find that the be&s;t hu&s;bands have been mo&s;t famous for their wi&s;dom. HOMER, who has drawn a perfect pattern of a prudent man, to render it the more complete, has cele|brated
<PB N="193" REF="031725_0192_0FEE1FE22A5B6A10">
him for the ju&s;t returns of fidelity and truth to his PENELOPE; in&s;omuch that he refu&s;ed the care&s;&s;es of a godde&s;s for her &s;ake; and, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of a pa|gan author, "Vetulam &s;uam praetulit immortalitati," his old woman was dearer to him than immortality.</P>
<P>Virtue is the next nece&s;&s;ary qualification for this do|me&s;tic character, as it naturally produces con&s;tancy and mutual e&s;teem. Thus BRUTUS and PORTIA were more remarkable for virtue and affection than any others of the age in which they lived.</P>
<P>Good nature is a third nece&s;&s;ary ingredient in a mar|riage &s;tate, without which it would inevitably &s;our on ma|ny occa&s;ions. When greatne&s;s of mind is joined with this amiable quality, it attracts the admiration and e&s;teem of all who behold it. Thus CAESAR, not more remarka|ble for his fortune and valour than for his humanity, &s;tole into the hearts of the Roman people, when breaking through the cu&s;tom, he pronounced an oration at the fu|neral of his fir&s;t wife.</P>
<P>Good nature is in&s;ufficient, unle&s;s it be &s;teady and uni|form, and accompanied with an evenne&s;s of temper, which is above all things to be pre&s;erved in this friend&s;hip con|tracted for life. A man mu&s;t be ea&s;y within him&s;elf, be|fore he can be &s;o to others. SOCRATES and MARCUS AURELIUS are in&s;tances of men, who by the &s;trength of philo&s;ophy having entirely compo&s;ed their minds and regu|lated their pa&s;&s;ions, are celebrated for good hu&s;bands, not|with&s;tanding the fir&s;t was yoked with XANTIPPE, and the other with FAUSTINIA.</P>
<P>IF THE WEDDED PAIR WOULD BUT HABITUATE THEMSELVES FOR THE FIRST YEAR TO BEAR WITH ONE ANOTHER'S FAULTS, THE DIFFICULTY WOULD BE PRETTY WELL CONQUERED. This mutual &s;weetne&s;s of temper and complacency was finely recommended in the nuptial ceremonies among the heathens, who, when they &s;acrificed to JUNO at that &s;olemnity, always tore out the gall from the entrails of the victim, and ca&s;t it behind the altar.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THOSE who would live happily in the marriage &s;tate &s;hould never enter into it without loving and being beloved, and &s;hould render this love genuine and durable by founding it on virtue. If it has no object but beauty, a graceful air, or the bloom of youth, it will be as frail as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e fleeting advantages, and like them too will &s;oon vani&s;h; but if it is fixed by the perfections of the mind, it will then &s;tand the te&s;t of time.</P>
<P>A marriage contracted without tenderne&s;s is a kind of rape; for to po&s;&s;e&s;s, when the mind does not con&s;ent, is to violate the law of nature. The gifts of HYMEN ought only to be di&s;pen&s;ed by the hands of LOVE; and whoev|er receives them from another is no better than an u&s;urper.</P>
<P>Vicious habits, capricious humours, and oppo&s;ite opin|ions di&s;turb the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed love. Thus a niggardly avaricious hu&s;band will conceive a di&s;gu&s;t for that wife, who thinking more nobly, imagines &s;he ought to regulate her expen&s;es by their joint income. On the contrary, a prodigal will de&s;pi&s;e his wife merely for being a good economi&s;t.</P>
<P>Marriage is the highe&s;t &s;tate of friend&s;hip: if happy, it le&s;&s;ens our cares by dividing them, at the &s;ame time that it doubles our &s;atisfactions by mutual participation. It is a &s;tate which ought not to be entered into with indifference on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>In unequal marriages, tho&s;e frequently incur cen&s;ure who more happily yoked might be entitled to prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Hu&s;bands and wives, who live together in a good un|der&s;tanding, give to &s;trangers an almo&s;t u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erring proof of the goodne&s;s of their hearts.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="031725_0194_0FEE1FE8E29DFBF8">When we choo&s;e our companions for life, if we hope to keep both them and our&s;elves in good humour to the la&s;t &s;tage of it, we mu&s;t be extremely careful in the choice we make, as well as the conduct on our own part. When the per&s;ons to whom we join our&s;elves can &s;tand an examination and bear the &s;crutiny, when they mend upon our acquaint|ance with them, and di&s;cover new beauties the more we &s;earch into their characters, our love will naturally ri&s;e in proportion to the knowledge of their perfections.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e there are very few po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch accom|pli&s;hments of body and mind, we ought to look after tho&s;e qualifications both in our&s;elves and others which are indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary towards this happy union, and which are in the power of every one to acquire, or at lea&s;t to cul|tivate and improve. The&s;e, in my opinion, are cheerful|ne&s;s and con&s;tancy. A cheerful temper joined with inno|cence, will make beauty attractive, knowledge delightful, and wit good natured. It will lighten &s;ickne&s;s, poverty, and affliction; convert ignorance into an amiable &s;implici|ty, and render deformity it&s;elf agreeable.</P>
<P>Con&s;tancy is natural to per&s;ons of even tempers and uniform di&s;po&s;itions; and may be acquired by tho&s;e of the greate&s;t ficklene&s;s, violence, and pa&s;&s;ion, who con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly the terms of union upon which they came togeth|er; the mutual intere&s;t in which they are engaged, with all the motives that ought to incite their tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion towards tho&s;e who have their dependence upon them, and are embarked with them for life in the &s;ame &s;tate of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Con&s;tancy, when it grows in the mind upon con&s;idera|tions of this nature, becomes a moral virtue, and a kind of good nature that is not &s;ubject to any change of health, age, fortune, or any of tho&s;e accidents which are apt to un&s;ettle the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions, that are founded rather in con&s;titu|tion than in rea&s;on. Where &s;uch a con&s;tancy as this is wanting, the mo&s;t inflamed pa&s;&s;ion may fall away into coldne&s;s and indifference, and the mo&s;t melting tenderne&s;s degenerate into hatred and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>In order to acquire the right of demanding love, en|deavour to de&s;erve it: after an union of twenty years be as

attentive to plea&s;e, and as careful to avoid offence, as if you were now endeavouring to in&s;pire that pa&s;&s;ion: for there is as great an advantage in keeping a heart, as in fir&s;t con|quering it. I dare an&s;wer for the happine&s;s of that union, where love, honour, and a mutual conde&s;cen&s;ion perpetual|ly reign; but the tie will be greatly weakened by the want of any of the&s;e three requi&s;ites; and if the fir&s;t be wanting, it will be totally de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><HI>Agathocles</HI> and <HI>Cali&s;ta</HI> are completely happy, becau&s;e they are both the friends of virtue. They love each other on this account; their love therefore will la&s;t as long as their virtue, and the continuance of that is &s;ecured by their union; for nothing can &s;ecure our per&s;everance in the paths of wi&s;dom &s;o effectually, as having a beloved and loving example before us. Their felicity can never be di&s;turbed but by tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters and misfortunes, from which their mutual tenderne&s;s cannot &s;helter them. But &s;uppo&s;ing that the&s;e &s;hould fall to their &s;hare, they would then only partake of the common lot of mankind. Tho&s;e who have never ta&s;ted the delights of love are equally ex|po&s;ed to di&s;appointment, and the lover is at lea&s;t a gainer with re&s;pect to tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which are of great account in the e&s;timation of the value of life. Add to this, that love tends to dimini&s;h the &s;en&s;e of their misfortunes; it has the peculiar virtue of rendering the &s;ufferings of two well-paired hearts le&s;s acute, and their delights more exqui&s;ite. It would &s;eem as if by communicating their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, each felt but half their weight, whil&s;t, on the contrary, their &s;at|isfactions are increa&s;ed by participation. As a &s;quadron of hor&s;e is conquered with more difficulty in proportion to its clo&s;ene&s;s, &s;o the happy pair re&s;i&s;t the attacks of trouble and adver&s;ity with &s;o much more &s;trength, as they are more firmly united.</P>

<P>HOW mon&s;trous is the brutal figure &s;ome hu&s;bands make, who, when lovers, were the poore&s;t and mo&s;t abject of &s;laves! When they &s;hould be defenders, they are tyrants; and when it is rea&s;onable for them to be provok|ed, they are &s;tupidly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive. How contemptible is their unmanly weakne&s;s! a moro&s;e and re&s;tle&s;s peevi&s;hne&s;s makes up the behaviour they expect to charm by. They contract a &s;urly &s;our habit from the di&s;appointments they meet with in life; and in&s;tead of &s;oftening the edge of af|fliction towards the woman who is bound to &s;hare their &s;ufferings, they double them on their head, from whom, in honour and con&s;cience they ought to ward off &s;orrow by a noble &s;weetne&s;s and endearing tenderne&s;s in their whole behaviour.</P>
<P>Particular circum&s;tances, and ca&s;t of temper, mu&s;t teach a man the probability of mighty unea&s;ine&s;&s;es in the mar|riage &s;tate (for &s;ome there are, unque&s;tionably, who&s;e very di&s;po&s;itions are &s;trangely aver&s;e to conjugal friend&s;hip:) but no one, I believe, is by his own natural complexion prompted to teaze and torment another, for no rea&s;on but being nearly allied to him; and can there be any thing more ba&s;e, or &s;erve to &s;ink a man &s;o much below his own di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic rea&s;on, than returning evil for good in &s;o open a manner, as that of treating a helple&s;s creature with unkindne&s;s, who has &s;o good an opinion of him, as to believe what he &s;aid relating to one of the great|e&s;t

concerns of life, by delivering her happine&s;s in this world to his care and protection? Mu&s;t not that man be abandoned even to all manner of humanity, who can de|ceive a woman with appearances of affection and kindne&s;s, for no other end but to torment her with more ea&s;e and authority? Is any thing more unlike a gentleman, than when his honour is engaged for the performing his promi&s;|es, becau&s;e nothing but that can oblige him to it, to be|come afterwards fal&s;e to his word, and be alone the oc|ca&s;ion of mi&s;eries to one who&s;e happine&s;s he but lately pre|tended was dearer to him than his own? Ought &s;uch a one to be tru&s;ted in his common affairs? or treated but as one who&s;e hone&s;ty con&s;i&s;ted only in his incapacity of being otherwi&s;e?</P>
<P>There is one cau&s;e of this u&s;age no le&s;s ab&s;urd than com|mon, which takes place among the more unthinking men, and that is the de&s;ire to appear to their friends free and at liberty, without tho&s;e trammels they have &s;o much ridicul|ed. To avoid this, they fly into the other extreme, and grow tyrants that they may &s;eem ma&s;ters. Becau&s;e an uncontrollable command of their actions is a certain &s;ign of entire dominion, they won't &s;o much as recede from the government even in one mu&s;cle of their faces. A kind look, they believe, would be fawning, and a civil an|&s;wer yielding the &s;uperiority. To this we mu&s;t attribute an au&s;terity they betray in every action: what but this can put a man out of humour in his wife's company, though he is &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hedly plea&s;ant every where el&s;e? The bitterne&s;s of his replies, and the &s;everity of his frowns to the tendere&s;t of wives, clearly demon&s;trate, that an ill-grounded fear of being thought too &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, is at the bottom of this (as I am willing to call it) affected moro&s;ene&s;s: but if it be &s;uch, put on only to convince his ac|quaintance of his entire dominion, let him take care of the con&s;equence, which will be certain and wor&s;e than the pre&s;ent evil: his &s;eeming indifference will by degrees grow into real contempt, and if it doth not wholly alienate the affections of his wife forever from him, make both him and her more mi&s;erable than if it really did &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="031725_0198_0FEE1FF8432655E0">However incon&s;i&s;tent it may appear, to be thought a well-bred per&s;on has no &s;mall &s;hare in this clowni&s;h beha|viour: but if this &s;ort of hu&s;bands would be convinced, that to be civil at lea&s;t is not beneath the character of a gentleman; nor that even tender affection towards one who would make it reciprocal, betrays any &s;oftne&s;s of ef|feminacy that the mo&s;t ma&s;culine di&s;po&s;ition need be a&s;ham|ed of; would they be &s;atisfied of the genero&s;ity of volun|tary civility, and the greatne&s;s of &s;oul that is con&s;picuous in benevolence without immediate obligations; the married condition would be a far more ea&s;y and comfortable one than it generally is. The hu&s;band would be no where &s;o well &s;atisfied as in his own hou&s;e, nor the wife &s;o plea&s;ant as in the company of her hu&s;band. A de&s;ire of being agreeable in the lover, would be increa&s;ed in the hu&s;band; and the mi&s;tre&s;s would be more amiable by becoming the wife. In &s;hort, men in general would be much better humoured than they are, did they not &s;o frequently exerci&s;e the wor&s;t turns of their temper where they ought to exert the be&s;t.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to ob&s;erve how ea&s;ily men get into a habit of being lea&s;t agreeable where they are mo&s;t obliged to be &s;o. Some men are &s;o unmerciful as to move jealou&s;y in their wives, and not care whether they are &s;o or not; they are ever out of humour in their company, but the plea&s;ant|e&s;t men in the world every where el&s;e; the greate&s;t &s;lovens at home, but the mo&s;t exactly dre&s;&s;ed in all other places. I would recommend to &s;uch men a more regular behaviour than to give the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite torments to tho&s;e who love them; nay, who&s;e torment would be abated if they did not love them.</P>
<P><HI>Amabilis</HI> is one who practi&s;es all the parts of a fine gen|tleman in the duty of a hu&s;band: when he was a bache|lor, much bu&s;ine&s;s made him negligent in his habit, but now there is no young lover &s;o nice in the care of his per|&s;on. One who a&s;ked him why he was &s;o long wa&s;hing his mouth, and &s;o delicate in the choice and wearing of his linen, was an&s;wered, "Becau&s;e there is a woman of merit obliged to receive me kindly, and I think it incumbent on me to make her inclination go along with her duty."</P>

<P><HI>Tom Whiffle</HI> married a wife by the command of his father, becau&s;e the match was on &s;ome particular accounts convenient to the family affairs.

She knew that her new hu&s;band was not the object of her love, but did not imme|diately know how much he de&s;erved to be hated. As her education had been carefully virtuous and her principles untainted, &s;he con&s;idered a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly the merits of her &s;pou&s;e, and endeavoured to find &s;omething amiable in a man, to whom virtue did not permit her to be any longer indifferent. She mi&s;took, &s;o great was her &s;implicity and inexperience, the tran&s;ports of the fir&s;t enjoyment for the pledges of mutual tenderne&s;s and future happine&s;s. He begins very &s;oon to con&s;ider her as an incumbrance, and is ea&s;ily di&s;gu&s;ted at her per&s;on, which novelty at fir&s;t only recommended; and from thence begins to quarrel with her fondne&s;s and e&s;teem for him, becau&s;e they take from him all pretence of hating her. She is frightened and alarmed at &s;o &s;trange and unrea&s;onable a &s;ourne&s;s of tem|per; &s;he is loth to believe or under&s;tand it; but his in|humanity grows too plain to be mi&s;taken any longer. She contents her&s;elf, however, in the mid&s;t of her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her own virtue; a &s;ublime and noble &s;atisfaction! She is grieved for her hu&s;band, but does not hate him; &s;he is le&s;s &s;een abroad and le&s;s vi&s;ited at home; applies her&s;elf to the concerns of her family, and a &s;tricter guard over her actions; &s;till meets her hu&s;|band even with a &s;mile, and &s;uffers her&s;elf to be hourly in|&s;ulted by the follies which he brings home with him, with|out breaking out into the ju&s;te&s;t rage and reproaches. With what words can I &s;ufficiently applaud &s;uch charming di&s;cretion, or how exclaim again&s;t the ill-di&s;cerning world, who are &s;ilent in her prai&s;e, whil&s;t they extol the hu&s;band

<P>This conduct &s;eldom fails of being attended with &s;uc|ce&s;s, and yet mo&s;t women neglect it: for being accu&s;tom|ed to the affiduity and complai&s;ance of a man during his court&s;hip, they per&s;uade them&s;elves, that the quality of a hu&s;band will le&s;&s;en nothing of that attention &s;o flattering to their &s;elf-love. They affect, in the very beginning of their union, to ob&s;erve no other rule for their actions but their whims and caprices, of which they would make their hu&s;bands the &s;laves, in order to pre&s;erve a &s;overeign|ty, which they have too often pu&s;hed even to de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>A good wife is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing and the mo&s;t valua|ble po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that Heaven, in this life, can be&s;tow: &s;he
<PB N="203" REF="031725_0202_0FEE20025E149B78">
makes the cares of the world &s;it ea&s;y, and adds a &s;weet|ne&s;s to its plea&s;ures: &s;he is a man's be&s;t companion in pro&s;perity, and his only friend in adver&s;ity; the carefulle&s;t pre&s;erver of his health, and the kinde&s;t attendant on his &s;ickne&s;s; a faithful advi&s;er in di&s;tre&s;s, a comforter in afflic|tion, and a prudent manager of all his dome&s;tic affairs.</P>
<P>The principal views of a good wife in adorning her per&s;on, &s;hould be to pre&s;erve her hu&s;band's affection and to do credit to his choice.</P>
<P>A married woman &s;hould not be de&s;irous of attracting the eyes of any man, but tho&s;e of her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>If a woman would have the world re&s;pect her hu&s;band, &s;he mu&s;t &s;et the example her&s;elf. Whil&s;t the wife gives the lea&s;t room to &s;u&s;pect that &s;he de&s;pi&s;es her hu&s;band, &s;he will find that &s;he &s;ubjects her&s;elf to double contempt, if he re&s;ents it not; and if he does, how can &s;he be hap|py? If they differ, &s;he will be apt to make by-&s;tanders judges over her. They perhaps may remember when &s;he is willing to forget, and her fame will be the &s;port of tho&s;e beneath her, as well in under&s;tanding as in degree.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce a family in this bu&s;y talking town, who&s;e mo&s;t &s;ecret affairs are not perfectly known; nay, though it be ever &s;o improper that they &s;hould be &s;o. The wife is too often at the bottom; &s;he entru&s;ts &s;ome bo&s;om friend, not remembering that the breach of confi|dence is as much in that, as if &s;he had revealed it to a thou&s;and: and 'tis from this dear friend a thou&s;and know it. A prudent woman will be upon her guard in the &s;tricte&s;t manner again&s;t the&s;e confidences, remembering that the mo&s;t important of all concerns, the e&s;teem and good opinion of her hu&s;band, depend upon her &s;ilence; and that nothing of all this is upon her whom &s;he is entru&s;t|ing, nothing more than an in&s;ignificant promi&s;e to an in|different per&s;on.</P>
<P>To a full mind there is no relief like the having a bo|&s;om friend, to whom it may in &s;afety unload its inmo&s;t weight. Where is the hu&s;band to look for this friend, if not in his wife? And why &s;hould &s;he rob him of the ad|vantage? Why will &s;he give him an occa&s;ion, for this may be the event, to &s;eek friend&s;hip and fidelity in &s;ome
<PB N="204" REF="031725_0203_0FEE2003E4A09A28">
other brea&s;t? The&s;e little points the morali&s;ts have di&s;re|garded, as trivial and below their con&s;ideration; yet triv|ial as they are, it is on them that all the colour of our lives depends. Tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e trifles, find them&s;elves often undone by them.</P>
<P>A good wife will not content her&s;elf that her conduct is unblameable, &s;he will endeavour to make it meritorious; and will lay a claim to the gratitude as well as the ac|knowledgments of the hu&s;band's heart, and to the applau&s;e as well as the approbation of her own.</P>
<P>It is common for the dread of one extreme to drive people of weak minds upon the oppo&s;ite. There is not any part of the conduct of a wife &s;o e&s;&s;ential as this. The point to be aimed at by her is the middle &s;tate between neglect and impertinence; the one is not more mi&s;chievous than the other is tire&s;ome.</P>
<P>Happy is the man who meets a wi&s;e that is not &s;tupidly &s;ilent, nor always prattling non&s;en&s;e; who&s;e mind is en|riched with all u&s;eful knowledge, and who has a ta&s;te for polite literature. A woman thus accompli&s;hed will be al|ways drawing &s;entences and maxims of virtue from the mo&s;t judicious authors. She will be mi&s;tre&s;s of her&s;elf in all changes of fortune, neither blown up in pro&s;perity, nor broken with adver&s;ity. She will be a cheerful and good-humoured friend, and an agreeable companion for life. Whatever company he is engaged in, he will long to be at home, and retire with delight from the &s;ociety of men in|to the bo&s;om of one who is dear, &s;o knowing, and &s;o amiable: he will wa&s;te with plea&s;ure whole days and nights in her company, and be ever finding out new beau|ties in her conver&s;ation: &s;he will keep his mind in per|petual &s;erenity, re&s;train its mirth from being di&s;&s;olute, and prevent its melancholy from being painful.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG the duties between the hu&s;band and the wife, the fir&s;t is affection. The pre&s;erving this is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of all concerns; for this being the band of all the union, on this depends the happine&s;s that &s;hall attend it; and that will not only be lo&s;t by the neglect of it, but will be more and more complete in proportion as the attention to this concern is more and more inviolable.</P>
<P>The love which marriage authori&s;es, and which it &s;hould in&s;pire, is not a flight of idle fancy, wild, irregular, and uncertain: it mu&s;t be firm, perfect, and inviolable; it mu&s;t be the fruit of con&s;ideration as well as of imagination; and it mu&s;t be known as a virtue as well as a compliance.</P>
<P>The writers on morality have &s;aid among their cautions again&s;t di&s;quiet in the married life, that the hu&s;band and wife &s;hould never be both angry together, that when one is out of temper the other &s;hould be &s;ilent: but this is talking in the general; it is right, it is wi&s;e, and it was perhaps as much as a reclu&s;e locked up in his &s;tudy could
<PB N="206" REF="031725_0205_0FEE200E5C258160">
arrive to know; but tho&s;e who live among the world are acquainted with a thou&s;and delicacies unknown to tho&s;e remote ob&s;ervers. There is a manner in doing things in which almo&s;t as much virtue con&s;i&s;ts as in the doing them; and it is not &s;ufficient that people are told what they are to do, unle&s;s they are informed in what way they are to do it.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible that a man can love the per&s;on whom he does not e&s;teem; at lea&s;t that love which a wife is to expect from the hu&s;band cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. The fir&s;t te&s;timony he u&s;ually gives of his e&s;teem is the con&s;id|ing in her, and revealing to her all his &s;ecrets. This is done in confidence, and the tru&s;t ought never to be vio|lated; although he &s;ays nothing, he means it &s;hould be &s;o; and he may pardon, but never can forget the violation of it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who love truly have but one heart between them; their thoughts, their cares, their concerns are in common; confidence is the natural offspring of affection, and he who loves tenderly can keep no &s;ecret.</P>
<P>It would be hard to &s;ay, perhaps, whether more fami|lies have had their peace di&s;turbed by the unaffectionate re&s;erve in the hu&s;band, or by the idle talking of the wife; whether more have been &s;acrifices to the not intru&s;ting of a &s;ecret, or to the divulging of it; but this is certain, that the offence on the one part is le&s;s than on the other, and that the one may be with rea&s;on pardoned and re&s;pected afterwards, but the other cannot.</P>
<P>There is no occa&s;ion of &s;o much reputation to a wom|an, be her quality what it will, &s;o great, as the &s;aying that her family is regular and well governed: and let me add, that there is no fortune &s;o moderate that will not &s;erve to make an appearance, nor is there any &s;o great as to &s;upport a ju&s;t appearance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ng without it. The peculiar in&s;tructions on &s;uch a head as this, can only be &s;uited to the peculiar circum&s;tances of the per&s;ons to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed: nay, and the caution is more &s;trict only to tho&s;e peculiari|ties of temper and di&s;po&s;ition, under which both are to enjoy tho&s;e circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="031725_0206_0FEE200FE2B5D958">Tho&s;e who are not ea&s;y at home, will never ta&s;te enjoy|ment any where el&s;e. To be ea&s;y is to be regular; let a good wife &s;et out with a principle of never neglecting any thing at the time when it is proper to con&s;ider it, and &s;he will never be perplexed and prevented with the multiplic|ity of concerns. The&s;e things offer &s;ingly and they are ea&s;ily di&s;patched; it is the neglecting them that accumu|lates them; and while &s;he looks on a confu&s;ed number, without knowing which to begin with, &s;he lets alone all.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o common as for people to be plundered by their &s;ervants. Of all things that are ea&s;y to be gone through at fir&s;t, accounts of this kind are the ea&s;ie&s;t; of all others, when they are neglected, they become the mo&s;t confu&s;ed, di&s;plea&s;ing, and impracticable. You recollect the circum&s;tances when a thing is recent, but you forget them after the time is elap&s;ed. You expect the expen&s;e of a few days in articles that you remember; you are a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;um when you have forgotten the things it concerns: but this is not all; your &s;ervants will &s;oon per|ceive whether you in&s;pect their accounts, and whether you do it regularly; they will know all the profit that may be made of your forgetfulne&s;s, and will not part with any portion of the advantage. I do not pretend to &s;ay that all the care in the world can prevent them from im|po&s;ing on you, but you cannot &s;uffer much while you take the caution of examining them often; whereas, if they &s;ee you remi&s;s, they will undoubtedly &s;ucceed in their at|tempts to defraud you.</P>
<P>What makes a remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in this article the more unpar|donable, is that there is nothing &s;o ea&s;y. Parts and tal|ents are required in many &s;cenes of life, but this is in the power of every one, and yet almo&s;t all neglect it. Meth|od and order will render things, even di&s;agreeable in their nature, ea&s;y and plea&s;ant. Employment not only gives plea&s;ure to the moments devoted to it, but gives a reli&s;h for tho&s;e which &s;ucceed.</P>

<P>MATRIMONY ought to be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t important &s;tep a man can take in private life, as it is that upon which his fortune, his credit and his peace mu&s;t depend. A happy marriage is the &s;ource of every kind of felicity, and on the other hand an unhappy mar|riage is of all others the greate&s;t misfortune. A man who lives cheerfully in his family, who loves and is belov|ed by his wife, who &s;ees his children with the fondne&s;s of a parent, and conducts his dome&s;tic affairs with the wi&s;|dom of a legi&s;lator, beholds a well regulated &s;tate in his own hou&s;e, of which him&s;elf is the head. But where di&s;|cord and di&s;&s;en&s;ion reign, where economy is wanting, and union is no more, the hu&s;band and the wife are alike un|happy; their private follies &s;oon become public, their er|rors are the prattle of the day, and their mi&s;carriages the topic of every conver&s;ation. An evil more grievous than this neither is in the power of chance, nor can be feigned by imagination.</P>
<P>In the choice of a wife, a man ought to con&s;ult his rea|&s;on always, and never his pa&s;&s;ions; not that I mean to exclude love, or more properly affection, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible that any marriage &s;hould be happy; but I would have this tenderne&s;s ari&s;e from reflection and not from accident; for beauty, that commonly gives ri&s;e to ha&s;ty inclination, is a very &s;mall ingredient among the nu|merous qualities that enter into the compo&s;ition of a good
<PB N="209" REF="031725_0208_0FEE2012F39DAB38">
wife. Among the&s;e I reckon mode&s;ty in countenance and carriage, a great fund of good &s;en&s;e, a &s;weetne&s;s of temper, equally removed from giddine&s;s and languor, a &s;incere di&s;po&s;ition to make the happine&s;s of her hu&s;band her principal &s;tudy, the management of her family her con&s;tant bu&s;ine&s;s, and the education of her children her con&s;tant delight.</P>
<P>A young woman of a good family, commonly &s;peaking, appears what &s;he ought to be; and therefore to know what &s;he really is, is an affair that requires time and attention; every thing is to be con&s;idered, her looks, her con&s;titu|tion, her dre&s;s, in a word the mo&s;t trivial of her actions are to be &s;canned, in order to form a right idea of her mind. To facilitate this di&s;covery two points are to be ob&s;erved; the fir&s;t is, the character of the parents, and the next, the lady's education. Example of every kind is a powerful thing, but that of parents is much more &s;o: if a father or mother are full of pride, vanity, or fondne&s;s for plea&s;ure, if they are remarkable for incon&s;tancy of mind or corruption of manners, it mu&s;t be an admirable genius indeed that can enable a young woman to e&s;cape the infection. Education is al&s;o a thing of very great con&s;equence, and what cannot be looked after with too much caution. To read, to write, to &s;ing, to dance, and to work a little with the needle, is the common road of female education. What wonder then that a per&s;on thus brought up, &s;hould be &s;o unfit for the conver&s;ation of a man of &s;en&s;e, for the partner of his joys and cares, or to &s;hare with him in the government of his family?</P>
<P>But the&s;e remarks are to be made in time: to enter into &s;uch inquiries, and to make a right u&s;e of them, with regard to her inclinations, a great deal of rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e are requi&s;ite: yet after all, perfection is not to be ex|pected; &s;he has the mo&s;t of it who has the fewe&s;t faults. The&s;e two are to be inquired after before marriage, that they may be borne with patience afterwards. In re&s;pect of the&s;e, a man mu&s;t judge for him&s;elf, according to the qualities of his own mind, and that degree of command which he has over his own pa&s;&s;ions. In&s;tead of this delay, this caution, mo&s;t people ru&s;h ha&s;tily into the &s;tate, and
<PB N="210" REF="031725_0209_0FEE201BCE806700">
di&s;cover none of its inconveniencies, till they are forced to it by experience: then they grow unea&s;y, fretful, impa|tient, and give a loo&s;e to their re&s;entment; they are per|petually reproving, chiding, and giving marks of their di&s;|plea&s;ure. Such methods &s;eldom are, indeed hardly can be, attended with &s;ucce&s;s; they forget that mildne&s;s, in|dulgence, and complai&s;ance, though they are virtues that make no great &s;how, are virtues neverthele&s;s, and peculiar|ly nece&s;&s;ary to the marriage &s;tate, which is &s;eldom happier than where both parties &s;trictly adhere to decency and decorum.</P>
<P>There are however a number of unhappy marriages in which the parties have no &s;hare, but are mere victims to the folly of their parents. The bargain perhaps was &s;truck before they &s;aw each other. What an indignity is this to human nature! The fir&s;t con&s;ideration in &s;uch ca&s;es is the fortune, and in this a few thou&s;ands, more or le&s;s, bring people together or keep them a&s;under. Whil&s;t parents love money &s;o much, they ought not to wonder if after marriage their children love one another &s;o little. But &s;o it is that luxury has obtained an univer&s;al empire, and money is thought nece&s;&s;ary to maintain it. Yet this too is a mi&s;take, for luxury is a gulph that will &s;wallow the riches of Peru. But &s;uppo&s;e it was not &s;o, is not a middle &s;tate, with honour, credit, and peace, better than immen&s;e riches with di&s;order, di&s;cord, and di&s;quiet? Will money cure the maladies either of body or mind, or is it po&s;&s;ible to enjoy riches if peace be wanting? Let a woman bring ever &s;o great a fortune, if &s;he bring ill humours too, &s;he will make a man mi&s;erable; and if &s;he is extravagant, &s;he will make him poor. The&s;e are things we &s;ee every day, but we never find a day to con&s;ider them.</P>
<P>It is this luxury, this vanity, this divinity which all the world adores, that exacts from a new married couple the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s offerings. To keep up a fooli&s;h cu&s;tom, people are made unhappy for their lives. This divinity is ingenious in &s;educing; &s;he be&s;tows upon the&s;e offerings the &s;pecious names of decency, genero&s;ity, marks of love and re&s;pect for the fair bride: but I, who make no &s;ecret

of my impiety towards this godde&s;s, &s;ay plainly, that they are highly extravagant. The &s;uperfluous expen&s;es, and luxury in general, frequently hinder per&s;ons of both &s;exes from entering into a &s;tate which nature in&s;pires, rea&s;on demands, and religion authori&s;es.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT di&s;tre&s;s finds &s;ome con&s;olation from revealing its misfortunes, is a trite ob&s;ervation, which per|haps is in no in&s;tance more &s;trongly felt, than where we have our&s;elves to blame for our calamities. There is &s;omething in making a confe&s;&s;ion, though but on paper, (even if it &s;hould never be communicated to any one) which unloads the mind of a weight, that bears it down in &s;ecret; and though it cannot pluck the thorn from memory, has certainly the effect of blunting its poignan|cy. Suffer me then, Sir, to tell you, or to write as if I were telling you, how unhappy I am, and by what means I have become &s;o.</P>
<P>I was left by my father at the age of thirteen, the eld|e&s;t of two daughters, under the charge of one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of mothers. Our circum&s;tances were affluent, our &s;ociety re&s;pectable, and our education, from its very commencement, had been attended to with care, and provided for with the utmo&s;t liberality. No in&s;truc|tion was neglected, no accompli&s;hment unattended to. In attaining the&s;e, my &s;i&s;ter was not quite &s;o fortunate as I. Born, as I have often been told, with uncommon quick|ne&s;s of parts, I found no difficulty of ma&s;tering the &s;tudies that were taught me, or of acquiring the embelli&s;hments it was wi&s;hed I &s;hould acquire. My &s;i&s;ter was often de|ficient in the one, and awkward at the other. She po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, however, a &s;ound, plain under&s;tanding, and an ex|cellent temper. My &s;uperiority never excited envy in her, and I think never vanity in me. We loved each other mo&s;t &s;incerely; and after &s;ome years had blunted the grief, which my mother felt for her hu&s;band's death, there were, I believe, few happier families than ours.</P>
<P>Though our affections were cordial, however, our di&s;|po&s;itions were very different. My &s;i&s;ter was content to
<PB N="213" REF="031725_0212_0FEE20240EE50CA0">
think as other people thought, and to feel as other peo|ple felt; &s;he rarely ventured to &s;peculate in opinion, or to &s;oar in fancy. I was often tempted to reject, if not to de&s;pi&s;e, the common opinions of mankind, and to create to my&s;elf a warm, and, I am afraid, a vi&s;ionary picture of happine&s;s, ari&s;ing from a highly refined &s;en&s;ibility. My mother was at pains to combat the&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;tic ideas, and to repre&s;ent the danger of indulging in them. From a de&s;ire, perhaps, of overcoming that tendency towards them which &s;he perceived in me, her di&s;cour&s;e, when we were alone, almo&s;t con&s;tantly turned on this &s;ubject. As &s;he always allowed us the liberty of argument with her, I &s;tood up in tho&s;e conver&s;ations the warm defender of my own maxims, in contradiction to tho&s;e prudent ones which &s;he recommended. Hers, I am per&s;uaded, admitted of better rea&s;oning; but my cau&s;e gave greater room for el|oquence. All my little talents were exerted in the con|te&s;t: and I have often &s;ince thought, that my mother had from nature a bent to my &s;ide of the que&s;tion, which all her wi&s;dom and experience had not been able to over|come; that though &s;he con&s;tantly applauded the prudent &s;y&s;tem of my &s;i&s;ter, &s;he was in truth rather partial to mine, and vain of that ability, with which I defended it. How|ever that might be, I my&s;elf always ro&s;e from the di&s;pute more and more convinced of the ju&s;tne&s;s of my own opin|ions, and proud of that &s;uperiority, which I thought they conferred on me.</P>
<P>We had not long attained a marriageable age, when we found our&s;elves &s;urrounded with tho&s;e, whom the world terms admirers. Our mother's benevolence and &s;weet|ne&s;s of temper inclined her to &s;ociety, and we were too innocent for prudery. We had therefore a number of vi&s;itors of the other &s;ex, many of whom were &s;o particu|lar in their attentions, that women who wi&s;hed to boa&s;t of conque&s;ts, would have called them lovers. With us they did not always a&s;&s;ume that title; my &s;i&s;ter was too pru|dent, and I was too nice, ea&s;ily to believe a man a lover.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e, however, were two gentlemen, who&s;e attachment was declared to me in terms too &s;trong to be mi&s;under&s;tood. <HI>Florio</HI>'s per&s;on was univer&s;ally allowed
<PB N="214" REF="031725_0213_0FEE202767281410">
to be hand&s;ome; many, of whom I was one, thought it elegant. With external accompli&s;hments his education had furni&s;hed him, his manner was ea&s;y and unembarra&s;&s;|ed; &s;ome called it a&s;&s;uming, I thought it natural. His conver&s;ation was full of the language of &s;en&s;ibility; in my idea it &s;poke a mind replete with &s;en&s;ibility it&s;elf. Other people &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected him of &s;hallowne&s;s and affecta|tion; I prai&s;ed him for avoiding the pedantry of knowl|edge, and the ru&s;ticity of men proud of its acquirements.</P>
<P><HI>Alcander</HI> was the only &s;on of a particular friend of my mother, and therefore on a very intimate footing in our family. My mother, with whom he was a favourite, di&s;|covered in him a great fund of good &s;en&s;e and of u&s;eful knowledge. I was &s;truck with the inelegance of his ap|pearance and addre&s;s, and the want of refinement in his &s;entiments and conver&s;ation. His goodne&s;s and candour were often the topics of my mother's commendation; I remarked his want of di&s;cernment, and the coldne&s;s of his attachments and aver&s;ions. My mother often repeated her own eulogiums of Alcander, and the critici&s;ms of the world on Florio; I always heard her with a determined oppo&s;ition of &s;entiment, and therefore ro&s;e from the con|ver&s;ation more aver&s;e from the fir&s;t, and more attached to the latter. Alcander, after per&s;i&s;ting for &s;ome time un|der a very marked di&s;inclination to him, gave up the pur|&s;uit; but as he &s;till continued his vi&s;its to the family, par|ticularly during any occa&s;ional ab&s;ence of mine, he tran&s;|ferred by degrees his affections to my &s;i&s;ter. When he had cea&s;ed to be my lover, I was willing to be very much his friend. My mother had always &s;hewn her partiality in his favour; my &s;i&s;ter was won by his virtues, and, after &s;ome time, became his wife.</P>
<P>Florio's &s;uit to me was oppo&s;ed by my mother with rather more vehemence than was natural to her. She oft|en in&s;i&s;ted on the infatuation, as &s;he called it, of that decep|tion I was under with regard to him; a deception, of which, &s;he predicted, I &s;hould one day be convinced. Her oppo&s;ition, however, though it over-ruled my con|duct, never overcame my attachment. I would not be his without the con&s;ent of my mother; but my affection it
<PB N="215" REF="031725_0214_0FEE2028EDB9BFE0">
was not in her power to &s;hake. Her love for me over|came her re&s;olution; and at la&s;t &s;he gave, however unwil|lingly, my hand to Florio.</P>
<P>I was now the happie&s;t of women. The &s;cenes of con|jugal tenderne&s;s and dome&s;tic happine&s;s, which I had often pictured, I thought now realized in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a man, who, I had taught my&s;elf to believe, was to love me forever, and was him&s;elf every thing I ought to love; and I often looked with a degree of pity on the &s;ituation of my &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e happine&s;s (for &s;he called it happine&s;s) with Alcan|der was of a kind &s;o inferior to mine.</P>
<P>How long this la&s;ted I cannot exactly &s;ay. I fear I begun to be unhappy, long before I could allow my&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to believe it. I have often wept alone at the coldne&s;s and neglect of Florio, when, on meeting him, a few words of &s;eeming tenderne&s;s and affection, made me again reproach my doubts of his love, and think my own &s;ituation the mo&s;t enviable of any. Alas! he drove me from this la&s;t &s;trong hold, in which my affection for him had entrenched it&s;elf. It is now three years, &s;ince he has treated me in &s;uch a manner, as to leave me no apology for his treat|ment. During the la&s;t, my mother's death has dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed me of one of the few comforts I had left. From my mother I carefully concealed my di&s;tre&s;s; but I believe in vain. She lived to gue&s;s at my mi&s;ery; and I fear her &s;en&s;e of it added to the pre&s;&s;ure of that di&s;ea&s;e, which brought her to her grave.</P>
<P>After the lo&s;s of my hu&s;band's love, it is little to talk of my di&s;appointment in his talents and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">compli&s;hments. It was long, however, before I allowed my&s;elf to &s;ee de+fects, which le&s;s penetration than I have been flattered with po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, had long before di&s;covered. My mother had often, before our marriage, expre&s;&s;ed her &s;urpri&s;e, that one of my abilities &s;hould be &s;o deceived as not to &s;ee his inferiority. I believe, that it is by the&s;e abilities, that the deception is aided. They are able to form a picture, to which more ordinary minds are unequal; and in the weakne&s;s of their ra&s;h attachment they find the likene&s;s where they wi&s;h to find it.&mdash;</P>

<P>Dignity and gravity are the peculiar excellencies of the men, and befitting their character, as they are formed for public life, and a &s;phere of action which requires greatne&s;s of mind, &s;trength and firmne&s;s of re&s;olution, a cooler &s;train of pa&s;&s;ion, and more inten&s;e application of thought; whereas decency is the proper characteri&s;tic and charm of a woman, as &s;uited to that &s;ofter economy and more pri|vate life for which &s;he was de&s;tined. This con&s;i&s;ts in a certain elegant propriety and delicacy of manner, &s;o well &s;uited to the character of her in whom it prevails, and &s;o di&s;creetly adapted to per&s;ons, times and places, as to re|flect a full image of female &s;oftne&s;s and mode&s;ty. Some of its principal features are a mildne&s;s of nature, which is prone to plea&s;e and yield to others, and arrogates to it&s;elf nothing that is not due to it; a mode&s;t re&s;erve, which guards again&s;t an affected &s;hyne&s;s on the one hand, and indecent liberties on the other; an elegant tenderne&s;s, which is di&s;po&s;ed to compa&s;&s;ion and is &s;en&s;ible to friend|&s;hip, yet is guided by judgment in its mea&s;ure and the choice of its objects; an high &s;en&s;e of decorum, which teaches her in every circum&s;tance what to grant and what to refu&s;e, when to &s;peak and when to be &s;ilent, to main|tain the re&s;pect due to the &s;ex without pride or di&s;dain, and court the e&s;teem of others without artifice or o&s;tenta|tion; not feigning pa&s;&s;ions &s;he has not, nor indi&s;creetly di&s;covering or artfully di&s;gui&s;ing tho&s;e &s;he has, much le&s;s boa&s;ting an in&s;en&s;ibility to which &s;he is a &s;tranger; and above all, a quick feeling of every thing that is fair, hon|ourable, humane, and faithful, with an irreconcilable aver&s;ion from whatever is unbecoming the honour and dig|nity of woman. Such are the charms of decency.</P>
<P>How &s;hocking it appears to &s;ee women forward in con|ver&s;ation, vain and arrogant, rough and boi&s;terous in their behaviour, or el&s;e artificial and full of di&s;gui&s;e! but when|ever we di&s;cover a levity and wantonne&s;s, then we look

<P>SPHRONILLA is a medley of noi&s;e and non&s;en&s;e, light as air, and as &s;ubject to &s;torms too; a perfect virago in her gait and behaviour, always in a flutter, eternally prattling, &s;oon fond, yet &s;oon di&s;gu&s;ted, and plays the ty|rant every where with all the in&s;olence of beauty, height|ened by a fortune which &s;he thinks places her above cen|&s;ure; covetous of prai&s;e, yet indifferent who be&s;tows it; often a &s;lattern in dre&s;s; regardle&s;s in company of the di&s;|tinctions of per&s;ons and things; and can &s;acrifice any de|cency of life to her plea&s;ure or pique.</P>
<P>But what a different creature, and how lovely is the mode&s;t CLORINDA! Tenderly &s;en&s;ible of her own digni|ty and character, yet always willing to attend and to do ju&s;tice to the merit of others; frank without being for|ward, and cautious rather then re&s;erved; apt to di&s;tru&s;t her own opinion, but mo&s;t ready to li&s;ten to that of oth|ers; better plea&s;ed to hear than &s;peak, but when &s;he opens her mouth, calm and gentle as the breath of even|ing; &s;u&s;ceptible of the mo&s;t tender &s;entiments, yet &s;edate and &s;teady in governing them; in&s;inuating, but without the lea&s;t artifice; a &s;trict ob&s;erver of the minute&s;t deco|rums of life, that have the lea&s;t connexion with virtue and female delicacy, joining the di&s;cretion of the matron to the mode&s;ty of the virgin.</P>
<P>What a different figure do the&s;e ladies make in the opinion of the world, and how differently are they receiv|ed! The one draws the eyes and ob&s;ervation of all upon her, but it is in order to cen&s;ure and expo&s;e her the more effectually. Mo&s;t people are afraid of her, and &s;hun her as they would do a hurricane or a viper. Tho&s;e who do not dread, de&s;pi&s;e and laugh at her. Her noi&s;e and fortune make her heard, where her &s;entiments would gain neither attention nor re&s;pect: none e&s;teem her; tho&s;e who profe&s;s it do it only to her&s;elf, or for &s;ome pri|vate views. The men hate a creature who affects to be &s;o like them&s;elves; and the women de&s;pi&s;e her, becau&s;e &s;he is &s;o unlike what a woman ought to be. How differ|ent is the treatment of the other!

<P>WHEN man arrives to a certain age, he becomes &s;en&s;ible of a peculiar &s;ympathy and tenderne&s;s to|wards the other &s;ex; the charms of beauty engage his at|tention, and call forth new and &s;ofter di&s;po&s;itions than he has yet felt. The many amiable qualities exhibited by a fair out&s;ide, or by the mild allurement of female man|ners, or which the prejudiced &s;pectator without much rea|&s;on &s;uppo&s;es tho&s;e to include, with &s;everal other circum|&s;tances, both natural and accidental, point his view and affection to a particular object, and of cour&s;e contract that general rambling regard, which was lo&s;t and u&s;ele&s;s among the undi&s;tingui&s;hed crowd, into a peculiar and permanent attachment to one woman, which ordinarily terminates in the mo&s;t important, venerable, and delightful connexion in life.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the brute creation is very different from that of human creatures: the former are clothed and gener|ally armed by their &s;tructure, ea&s;ily find what is nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and &s;oon attain their vigour and matu|rity; &s;o that they need the care and aid of their parents

but a &s;hort while: and therefore we &s;ee that nature has a&s;&s;igned to them vagrant and tran&s;ient amours. The con|nexion being purely natural, and formed merely for prop|agating and rearing their offspring, no &s;ooner is that end an&s;wered, than the connexion di&s;&s;olves of cour&s;e. But the human race are of a more tender and defencele&s;s con|&s;titution: their infancy and non-age continue longer; they advance &s;lowly to &s;trength of body, and maturity of rea|&s;on; they need con&s;tant attention, and a long &s;eries of cares and labours, to train them up to decency, virtue, and the various arts of life. Nature has therefore pro|vided them with the mo&s;t affectionate and anxious tutors, to aid their weakne&s;s, to &s;upply their wants, and to accom|pli&s;h them in tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary arts; even their own parents, on whom &s;he has devolved this mighty charge, rendered agreeable by the mo&s;t alluring and powerful of all ties, parental affection. But unle&s;s both concur in this grateful ta&s;k, and continue their joint labours, till they have reared up and planted out their young colony, it mu&s;t become a prey to every rude invader, and the purpo&s;e of nature, in the original union of the human pair, mu&s;t be defeated. Therefore our &s;tructure as well as condition is an evident indication, that the human &s;exes are de&s;tined for a more intimate, for a moral and la&s;ting union. It appears like|wi&s;e, that the principal end of marriage is not to propa|gate and nur&s;e up an offspring, but to educate and form MINDS for the great duties, and exten&s;ive de&s;tinations of life. Society mu&s;t be &s;upplied from this original nur&s;ery with u&s;eful members, and its faire&s;t ornaments and &s;up|ports. But how &s;hall the young plants be guarded again&s;t the inclemencies of the air and &s;ea&s;ons, cultivated and rai&s;ed to maturity, if men, like brutes, indulge to vagrant and promi&s;cuous amours?</P>
<P>The mind is apt to be di&s;&s;ipated in its views, and its acts of friend&s;hip and humanity; unle&s;s the former be di|rected to a particular object, and the latter employed in a particular province. When men once give way to this di&s;&s;ipation, there is no &s;topping their career; they grow in&s;en&s;ible to moral attractions, and by ob&s;tructing or im|pairing the decent and regular exerci&s;e of the tender and
<PB N="223" REF="031725_0222_0FEE2045A16D3870">
generous feelings of the human heart, they in time become unqualified for, or aver&s;e from, the forming a moral union of &s;ouls, which is the cement of &s;ociety and the &s;ource of the pure&s;t dome&s;tic joys: whereas a rational, undepraved LOVE, and its fair companion, MARRIAGE, collect a man's views, guide his heart to its proper object, and by confin|ing his affection to that object, do really enlarge its influ|ence and u&s;e. Be&s;ides, it is but too evident from the con|duct of mankind, that the common ties of humanity are too feeble to engage and intere&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions of the gen|erality, in the affairs of &s;ociety. The connexions of neighbourhood, acquaintance, and general intercour&s;e, are too wide a field of action for many; and tho&s;e of a public or community are &s;o for more; and in which they "either care not, or know not how," to exert them|&s;elves. Therefore nature, ever wi&s;e and benevolent, by implanting that &s;trong &s;ympathy, which reigns between the individuals of each &s;ex, and by urging them to form a particular moral connexion, the &s;pring of many dome&s;tic endearments, has mea&s;ured out to each pair a particular &s;phere of action, proportioned to their views, and adapted to their re&s;pective capacities. Be&s;ides, by intere&s;ting them deeply in the concerns of their own little circle, &s;he has connected them more clo&s;ely with &s;ociety, which is compo&s;ed of particular families, and bound them down to their good behaviour, in that particular community to which they belong. This moral connexion is marriage, and this &s;phere of action is a family.</P>
<P>The minds of both &s;exes are as much formed one for the other, by a temperament peculiar to each, as their per|&s;ons. The &s;trength, firmne&s;s, courage, gravity and digni|ty of the man, tally to the &s;oftne&s;s, delicacy, tenderne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, elegance of ta&s;te, and decency of conver&s;ation, of the woman. The male mind is formed to defend, delib|erate, fore&s;ee, contrive and advi&s;e; the female one to confide, imagine, apprehend, comply and execute: there|fore the proper temperament of the&s;e different &s;exes of minds, makes a fine moral union; and the well-propor|tioned oppo&s;ition of different or contrary qualities, like a due mixture of di&s;cords in a compo&s;ition of mu&s;ic, &s;wells
<PB N="224" REF="031725_0223_0FEE204729C3E500">
the harmony of &s;ociety more, than if they were all uni&s;ons to each other. And this union of moral &s;exes, if we may expre&s;s it &s;o, is evidently more conducive to the im|provement of each, than if they lived apart: for the man not only protects and advi&s;es, but communicates vigour and re&s;olution to the woman. She in her turn &s;oftens, refines and poli&s;hes him: in her &s;ociety he finds repo&s;e from action and care; in her friend&s;hip, the ferment into which his pa&s;&s;ions were wrought by the hurry and di&s;trac|tion of public life, &s;ub&s;ides and &s;ettles into a calm; and a thou&s;and namele&s;s graces and decencies, that flow from her words and actions, form him for a more mild and el|egant deportment. His conver&s;ation and example, on the other hand, enlarge her views, rai&s;e her &s;entiments, &s;u&s;tain her re&s;olutions, and free her from a thou&s;and f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars and inquietudes, to which her more feeble con&s;titution &s;ub|jects her.</P>
<P>Of the conjugal alliance the following are the natural laws. Fir&s;t, Mutual fidelity to the marriage bed. Di&s;|loyalty defeats the very end of marriage, di&s;&s;olves the nat|ural cement of the relation, weakens the moral tie, the chief &s;trength of which lies in the reciprocation of affec|tion, and, by making the offspring uncertain, dimini&s;hes the care and attachment nece&s;&s;ary to their education.</P>
<P N="2">2. A con&s;piration of coun&s;els and endeavours to pro|mote the common intere&s;t of the family, and to educate their common offspring. In order to ob&s;erve the&s;e laws, it is nece&s;&s;ary to cultivate, both before and during the mar|riage &s;tate, the &s;tricte&s;t decency and cha&s;tity of manners, and a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of what becomes their re&s;pective char|acters.</P>

<P>THE connexion of parents with their children, is a natural con&s;equence of the matrimonial connexion; and the duties which they owe them, re&s;ult as naturally from that connexion. The feeble &s;tate of children, &s;ub|ject to &s;o many wants and dangers, requires their ince&s;&s;ant care and attention; their ignorant and uncultivated minds demand their continual in&s;truction and culture. Had hu|man creatures come into the world with the the full &s;trength of men, and the weakne&s;s of rea&s;on and vehe|mence of pa&s;&s;ions which prevail in children, they would have been too &s;trong, or too &s;tubborn, to have &s;ubmitted to the government and in&s;truction of their parents. But, as they were de&s;igned for a progre&s;&s;ion in knowledge and virtue, it was proper that the growth of their bodies &s;hould keep pace with that of their minds, le&s;t the purpo&s;es of that progre&s;&s;ion &s;hould have been defeated. Among oth|er admirable purpo&s;es which this gradual expan&s;ion of their outward as well as inward &s;tructure &s;erves, this is one, that it affords ample &s;cope to the exerci&s;e of many tender and generous affections, which fill up the dome&s;tic life with a beautiful variety of duties and enjoyments: and are of cour&s;e a noble di&s;cipline of the heart, and an hardy kind of education for the more honourable and important duties of public life.</P>
<P>The above mentioned weak and ignorant &s;tate of chil|dren, &s;eems plainly to inve&s;t their parents with &s;uch au|thority and power as is nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;upport, protec|tion, and education; but that authority and power can be
<PB N="227" REF="031725_0226_0FEE20531AC66690">
con&s;trued to extend no farther than is nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer tho&s;e ends, and to la&s;t no longer than that weakne&s;s and ignorance continue: therefore the foundation or rea&s;on of the authority and power cea&s;ing, they cea&s;e of cour&s;e. Whatever power or authority then it may be nece&s;&s;ary or lawful for parents to exerci&s;e, during the non-age of their children; to a&s;&s;ume or u&s;urp the &s;ame when they have attained the maturity or full exerci&s;e of their &s;trength and rea&s;on, would be tyrannical and unju&s;t. From hence it is evident, that parents have no right to puni&s;h the per&s;ons of their children more &s;everely than the nature of their ward&s;hip requires; much le&s;s to invade their lives, to en|croach upon their liberty, or transfer them as their prop|erty to any ma&s;ter what&s;oever. But if any parent &s;hould be &s;o unju&s;t and inhuman, as to con&s;ider and treat them like his other goods and chattels, &s;urely, whenever they dare, they may re&s;i&s;t; and whenever they can, &s;hake off that inhuman and unnatural yoke, and be free with that liberty, with which GOD and nature inve&s;ted them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t cla&s;s of duties which parents owe their chil|dren re&s;pect their natural life, and the&s;e comprehend pro|tection, nurture, provi&s;ion, introducing them into the world in a manner &s;uitable to their rank and fortune, and the like.</P>
<P>The &s;econd order of duties regards the intellectual and moral life of their children, or their education in &s;uch arts and accompli&s;hments as are nece&s;&s;ary to qualify them for performing the duties they owe to them&s;elves, and to oth|ers. As this was found to be the principal de&s;ign of the matrimonial alliance, &s;o the fulfilling that de&s;ign is the mo&s;t important and dignified of all the parental duties. In order therefore to fit the child for acting his part wi&s;ely and worthily as a man, as a citizen, and a creature of GOD, both parents ought to combine thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> joint wi&s;dom, authority, and power, and each apart to em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">loy tho&s;e tal|ents which are the peculiar excellency and ornament of their re&s;pective &s;ex.

moral powers of his child: his imagination and the manner of tho&s;e exertions are the peculiar province of the latter. The former &s;hould advi&s;e, protect, command; and by his experience, ma&s;culine vigour, and that &s;uperior authority which is commonly a&s;cribed to his &s;ex, brace and &s;trength|en his pupil for active life, for gravity, integrity, and firm|ne&s;s in &s;uffering; the bu&s;ine&s;s of the latter is to bend and &s;often her male pupil by the charms of her conver&s;ation, and the &s;oftne&s;s and decency of her manners, for &s;ocial life, for politene&s;s of ta&s;te, and the elegant decorums and enjoyments of humanity; and to improve and refine the tenderne&s;s and mode&s;ty of her female pupil, and form her to all tho&s;e mild dome&s;tic virtues, which are the peculiar characteri&s;tics and ornaments of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>To conduct the opening minds of their &s;weet charge through the &s;everal periods of their progre&s;s, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in each period in throwing out the latent &s;eeds of rea&s;on and ingenuity, and in gaining fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ions of light and virtue; and at length, with all the&s;e advantages, to pro|duce the young adventurers upon the great theatre of hu|man life, to act their &s;everal parts in the &s;ight of their friends, of &s;ociety, and mankind! How gloriou&s;ly does Heaven reward the ta&s;k, when the parents behold tho&s;e dear images and repre&s;entatives of them&s;elves, inheriting their virtues as well as fortunes, &s;u&s;taining their re&s;pective characters gracefully and worthily, and giving them the agreeable pro&s;pect of tran&s;mitting their name, with grow|ing honour and advantage, to a race yet unborn!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>With plea&s;ure I annex in a note a few lines, written by a much valued friend, and addre&s;&s;ed, during ab&s;ence, to ONE OF THE MOST AMIABLE OF HER SEX.

<HEAD>CONJUGAL PRECEPTS. Tran&s;lated from PLUTARCH.</HEAD>
<P>THE ancients always placed together the &s;tatues of VENUS and MERCURY, to &s;ignify that the plea&s;ures of matrimony con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in &s;weetne&s;s of conver&s;ation: they joined al&s;o the GRACES and SEDULA, the godde&s;s of eloquence, to intimate that the married couple were to act only by per&s;ua&s;ion, and to forbear the impetuo&s;ities of tyranny and contention.</P>
<P>It very much behoves tho&s;e who are newly married, to avoid the fir&s;t occa&s;ions of di&s;cord and di&s;&s;en&s;ion: they &s;hould con&s;ider, that ve&s;&s;els when ju&s;t made, are liable to be brui&s;ed and thrown out of &s;hape by &s;light accidents; but when once &s;ettled and hardened by time, they will endure the &s;evere&s;t &s;hocks.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who rather choo&s;e to be the mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of &s;en&s;ele&s;s cuckolds, than the obedient wives of di&s;creet and &s;ober hu&s;bands, re&s;emble tho&s;e per&s;ons who choo&s;e rather to fol|low the directions of a purblind and ignorant guide, than of one that &s;ees clearly and knows every &s;tep of the way. They will not believe that PASIPHAE, the con&s;ort of a prince, could ever be enamoured of a bull; and yet they abandon the &s;ociety of their own hu&s;bands, men of wi&s;dom, temperance and gravity, and fly to the embraces of riot and debauchery.</P>
<P>Some men, when they are about to ride, being unable through infirmity, or unwilling through lazine&s;s, to mount into their &s;addles, teach their hor&s;es to fall upon their knees, and receive their riders in that po&s;ture. In like
<PB N="231" REF="031725_0230_0FEE206088147F28">
manner, there are &s;ome men, who, having married young ladies, not le&s;s con&s;iderable for their birth than their for|tune, take little care to improve the advantages of &s;uch a &s;plendid conjunction, but endeavour to degrade their wives to the condition of &s;laves, and glory in dome&s;tic tyranny. But it is more becoming a man to u&s;e the reins of gov|ernment with the &s;ame regard to the quality and dignity of the woman, as to the &s;tature of the hor&s;e.</P>
<P>A woman ought to di&s;play the charms of her virtue, and the &s;weetne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, in her hu&s;band's pre&s;|ence; but to retire, in his ab&s;ence, to &s;ilence and re&s;erv|edne&s;s at home.</P>
<P>If ki&s;&s;ing and care&s;&s;ing in the &s;ight of others, be &s;o un|&s;eemly (as it really is) how much more indecent is it to rail and &s;cold at each other in the company of &s;trangers? If lawful familiarity between man and wife is not to be allowed but in their retirements, can the bitter inter|changes of incon&s;iderate pa&s;&s;ion be thought an entertain|ment, proper for an audience no way concerned in them?</P>
<P>HELEN was covetous, PARIS luxurious; on the con|trary, ULYSSES was prudent, PENELOPE cha&s;te: happy therefore were the nuptials of the latter, but tho&s;e of the former brought a &s;eries of mi&s;eries both upon the Trojans and the Greeks.</P>
<P>King PHILIP was &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately fond of a fair The&s;&s;a|lian lady, that his queen OLYMPIAS &s;u&s;pected &s;he u&s;ed &s;ome private arts of fa&s;cination; and therefore endeavour|ed to get the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;orcere&s;s into her power. But when &s;he had viewed her well, examined her beauty, be|held the graces of her deportment, and found by her di&s;|cour&s;e that &s;he was a per&s;on of noble de&s;cent and educa|tion; hence vain &s;u&s;picions, hence vainer calumnies, &s;aid &s;he to her, for I find that the charms you make u&s;e of are in your own power: certainly therefore a lawful wife &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es the common qualifications for obtaining happine&s;s, when without the advantages of her wealth, her per&s;on or her birth, &s;he makes it her whole &s;tudy to win her hu&s;|band's affections by her virtue and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>That is ornament which adorns; and that adorns a woman which renders her mo&s;t de&s;erving: an honour
<PB N="232" REF="031725_0231_0FEE20620F898DE8">
conferred upon her, not by the lu&s;tre of gold or emeralds or diamonds, but by the real embelli&s;hments of gravity, di&s;cretion, humility and mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>Women who honour and &s;ubmit to their hu&s;bands, procure honour and re&s;pect to them&s;elves; but when they &s;trive to get the ma&s;tery, they become a reproach not on|ly to them&s;elves, but to tho&s;e who are &s;o ignominiou&s;ly hen-pecked. However, it behoves an hu&s;band to control his wife, not as a ma&s;ter does his va&s;&s;al, but as the &s;oul governs the body, with the gentle hand of mutual friend|&s;hip and reciprocal affection. For as the &s;oul commands the body, without being &s;ubject to its plea&s;ures and inordi|nate de&s;ires; in like manner a man &s;hould &s;o exerci&s;e his authority over his wife, as to &s;often it with complai&s;ance and kind requital for her affectionate &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>An hu&s;band &s;hould bear a greater re&s;pect to his wife, than to all other women in the world; for the nuptial chamber ought to be a &s;chool of honour and cha&s;tity, not of incontinency and wantonne&s;s. He who allows him&s;elf to ta&s;te tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which he denies his wife, acts like a man who would enjoin his wife to oppo&s;e tho&s;e enemies to which he has already &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>Prudent wives, when their hu&s;bands rant and foam in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;hould not exa&s;perate them by oppo&s;i|tion, but check their own loquacity: if indeed they grumble out their di&s;contents in a &s;ulky humour, they may then try by &s;oothing language and per&s;ua&s;ive argu|ments to calm their pa&s;&s;ions, and rectify their errors.</P>
<P>Sallies of pa&s;&s;ionate anger and keen reproaches &s;hould be bani&s;hed from the hou&s;ehold of the nuptial dwelling. Though a certain kind of au&s;terity becomes the mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, yet it &s;hould be like the &s;harpne&s;s of wine, profitable and delightful; not like that of aloes, biting and ungrateful to the palate.</P>
<P>As the hu&s;band ought to &s;ympathize in the joys and &s;or|rows of the wife, &s;o it is equally the duty of the wife to be &s;en&s;ible of the plea&s;ures and anxieties of the hu&s;band; for, as knots are fa&s;tened by knitting the bows of a thread together, &s;o the ligaments of conjugal &s;ociety may be &s;trengthened by the mutual interchange of kindne&s;s and affection. Community of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions is chiefly requi&s;ite
<PB N="233" REF="031725_0232_0FEE20656A344688">
among married couples, who &s;hould endeavour to mix and incorporate their purcha&s;es and di&s;bur&s;ements into one &s;ub|&s;tance, neither of them pretending to claim a right to partic|ular expen&s;es, but counting all in&s;eparably peculiar to both.</P>
<P>As a looking gla&s;s, though &s;et in a frame of gold, en|riched with the mo&s;t &s;parkling gems, is entirely u&s;ele&s;s, if it does not give back the exact &s;imilitude of the image it receives; &s;o a wealthy portion cea&s;es to be profitable, if the conditions, the temper, the humour of the wife, are not conformable to the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the hu&s;band, and if he does not &s;ee the virtues of his own mind repre|&s;ented in hers.</P>
<P>PLATO, when he ob&s;erved the moro&s;ene&s;s of XENOC|RATES, who was otherwi&s;e a per&s;on of great virtue and integrity, admoni&s;hed him to &s;acrifice to the graces. In like manner, I am of opinion, that it behoves a woman of moderation to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the graces in her behaviour towards her hu&s;band, in order to make their &s;ociety reciprocally harmonious, and to pre&s;erve her from being wa&s;pi&s;hly proud from an extravagant opinion of her fidelity and virtue.</P>
<P>It becomes not a frugal woman, to be negligent of a decent neatne&s;s; nor out of an awful re&s;pect to her hu&s;|band, to refrain from complacency in conver&s;ation. As the rigid di&s;po&s;ition renders her hone&s;ty irk&s;ome, &s;o her hou&s;ewifery becomes unplea&s;ing by &s;lutti&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>PHIDIAS made the &s;tatue of VENUS at ELIS with one foot upon a tortoi&s;e, to &s;ignify two great duties of a vir|tuous woman, viz. to &s;tay at home, and be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>The orator GORGIAS in a full a&s;&s;embly of the Grecians, who re&s;orted from all parts to the olympic games, exhort|ing them to live in peace, unity and concord with each other; MELANTHIAS cried out, This man, who pretends to give us advice and preaches in public nothing but the love of union, is not able in his own family to keep his wife and his maid from being together perpetually by the ears, and yet there are only three per&s;ons in the hou&s;e. GORGIAS, it &s;eems, had a kindne&s;s for his &s;ervant which made her mi&s;tre&s;s jealous. It therefore behoves that man to keep his family in exqui&s;ite order, who will undertake to regulate the conduct of his friends or the public.</P>

<P>HEAVEN be&s;towed upon man the finer feelings of the &s;oul, with a view to augment his happine&s;s, and to render his &s;ituation in life the more plea&s;ant; yet, in con|&s;equence of tho&s;e erroneous notions which re&s;inements in &s;ociety engender, the&s;e very feelings are the cau&s;e of the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to which human nature is &s;ubjected. To &s;uch a weak and fallible creature as man, the &s;ym|pathetic endearments ari&s;ing from reciprocal affections are nece&s;&s;ary, before his mind can experience the highe&s;t de|gree of gratification, of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible. In times of di&s;tre&s;s, he &s;eeks for &s;ome &s;ympathetic bo&s;om, that &s;hall take plea&s;ure in admini&s;tering the balm of comfort; and when the heart exults with joy, it feels a dreary want, until it can find &s;ome one, who will participate with him in that peculiar bli&s;s. Every emotion of the heart proves, that man was not made to be alone; and that, if ever he hopes to attain to happine&s;s, it can never be found in &s;oli|tude, far le&s;s in the company of tho&s;e, who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, de&s;ires, and modes of thinking, are not of a nature conge|nial to his own.</P>
<P>The&s;e are truths that will readily be admitted by every one, who is young and unhackneyed in the ways of men; but as age approaches, the&s;e &s;ympathetic affections &s;eem to &s;ub&s;ide: the plea&s;ures of &s;ocial intercour&s;e dimini&s;h; and the love of wealth and power acquire dominion in their &s;tead.

<P>Nor is this propen&s;ity confined to one country, or to one &s;et of people on the globe; but it extends its influence, to a greater or le&s;s degree, to all nations that can a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the proud name of <HI>civilized.</HI> Among &s;uch people, laws have ever been contrived, which, by a &s;tern inflexibility, overpower the voice of nature, and make man &s;ubmit to her imperious decrees.

<P>"IN this capital (Rome) we have ju&s;t now witne&s;&s;ed an event, which has drawn tears from every body here.

Oppre&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t cruel de&s;pair, &s;he thus wrote to him: "I find my&s;elf under the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of renouncing tho&s;e &s;weet and &s;acred bands, which till now have held our hearts firmly united; but I re&s;ign my&s;elf with le&s;s repugnance, from the con&s;idera|tion, that it will be the means of terminating that long and &s;evere captivity, which you have &s;uffered for my &s;ake.

Since you love the mother, remember the daughter which &s;he has given to you, and take care of her, when you know that I no longer exi&s;t; for the grief, which this &s;eparation cau&s;es to me, is &s;o bitter, &s;o penetrating, and ab&s;orbs in &s;uch a manner the faculties of my &s;oul, that I want &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t it.

This way of thinking, I prote&s;t, does not ari&s;e from di&s;appointed love; but, on the contrary, from my never having &s;een any one man, who has been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e accompli&s;hments, which I think nece&s;&s;ary for an hu&s;band.</P>
<P>I proceed now to give you a de&s;cription of one, whom, notwith&s;tanding my pre&s;ent humour, I would willingly marry, and reward with a fortune of ten thou&s;and pounds. To &s;ilence the preten&s;ions of tho&s;e, who may &s;uppo&s;e, that I am ea&s;ily to be carried off, here follows the de&s;cription of the only man in the world that I will con&s;ent to mar|ry; and whom I &s;hall beg leave to entitle.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>THE MAID'S HUSBAND.</HEAD>
<P>HE mu&s;t have a per&s;on graceful and engaging. The features of his face mu&s;t be regular; and, though regular, agreeable; which as yet I hardly remember to have &s;een, having generally ob&s;erved, that where nature is mo&s;t ex|act, &s;he is lea&s;t engaging&punc; His eyes mu&s;t be lively, &s;park|ling, and affecting; and over the whole face there mu&s;t be a clear complexion, health, cheerfulne&s;s, and &s;en&s;ibility. His &s;tature mu&s;t be inclining to the tall; his motion ea&s;y and genteel, free from the &s;hort pert trip of the affected beau, or the haughty tragic &s;tep of the mo&s;t &s;olemn fop. His behaviour &s;erious, but natural; neither too open, nor too re&s;erved. His look, his laugh, his &s;peech, and his
<PB N="238" REF="031725_0237_0FEE2079EDE4FA48">
whole manner mu&s;t be ju&s;t without affectation, and free without levity.</P>
<P>Thus much for his per&s;on. I now come to the endow|ments of his mind; without which, grace, beauty, and agreeablene&s;s mu&s;t avail him nothing. His genius mu&s;t be fanciful; his knowledge exten&s;ive. Men, as well as books, mu&s;t have been his &s;tudy. Learning, freedom, and gallantry mu&s;t be &s;o blended in him, as to make him always the improving friend, the gay companion, and the entertaining lover. In conver&s;ation he mu&s;t &s;ay nothing with &s;tudy, nor yet any thing at random. His thoughts mu&s;t flow from him naturally, yet not without that delica|cy of expre&s;&s;ion, which is nece&s;&s;ary to give them a genteel turn. To the talents of his mind let me add (if I may be allowed the di&s;tinction) the qualities of his &s;oul. He mu&s;t be generous without prodigality; humane without weakne&s;s; ju&s;t without &s;everity; and fond without folly. To his wife he mu&s;t be endearing; to his children affec|tionate; to his friends warm; and to mankind benevolent. Nature and rea&s;on mu&s;t join their powers, and to the openne&s;s of the heart add the virtue of economy; making him careful without avarice, and giving him a kind of un|concernedne&s;s without negligence. With love he mu&s;t have re&s;pect; and by a continued compliance always win upon the inclination. He mu&s;t take care to retain his conque&s;t by the means he gained it, and eternally look and &s;peak with the &s;ame de&s;ires and affections, though with greater freedom.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved by experienced people, that the &s;oul contracts a &s;ort of blindne&s;s by loving; but the man I am &s;peaking of mu&s;t derive his &s;entiments from rea&s;on; and the pa&s;&s;ion, which in others is looked on as the mark of folly, be in him the true effect of judgment.</P>
<P>To the&s;e qualities I mu&s;t add that charm, which is to be con&s;idered before all the re&s;t, though hard to be met with in this libertine age, Religion. He mu&s;t be devout without &s;uper&s;tition, and pious without melancholy: far from that infirmity, which makes men uncharitable bigots, infu&s;ing into their hearts a moro&s;e contempt of the world, and an antipathy even to its innocent plea&s;ures. He
<PB N="239" REF="031725_0238_0FEE207B74A537F8">
mu&s;t not be &s;uch a lover of &s;ociety as to mix with the a&s;|&s;emblies of knaves and blockheads, nor yet of an opinion that he ough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to retire from mankind to &s;eek GOD in the horror of &s;olitude: on the contrary, he mu&s;t think that the ALMIGHTY is to be found among men, where his goodne&s;s is mo&s;t active, and his providence mo&s;t employed. There it is that Religion mu&s;t enlighten, and rea&s;on regu|late his conduct, both in the cares of &s;alvation, and the duties of life.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a man, a woman mu&s;t enjoy tho&s;e plea&s;ures in marriage, which none but fools would ridicule. Her hu&s;band would be always the &s;ame, and always plea&s;ing. Other wives are glad, if they can now and then find with their hu&s;bands one agreeable hour; but with this a di&s;a|greeable minute will be impo&s;&s;ible. On whatever occa|&s;ions we &s;hould &s;ee or &s;peak to each other, it mu&s;t be with mutual plea&s;ure, and a&s;&s;ured &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, let your dre&s;&s;ing, &s;cribbling, hand&s;ome young fellows, whether of town or country, of the law, of trade, or of whatever honourable vocation, who would be glad of a woman of five and twenty, not di&s;agreeable in her per&s;on, and with ten thou&s;and pounds in her pocket, read this character; and if any of them will a&s;&s;ert and prove it to belong to him&s;elf, my heart, hand, and fortune are at his &s;ervice. But I believe, Sir, that, in&s;tead of a man, I have been de&s;cribing a mon&s;ter of the imagination; a thing that neither is, was, nor ever will be: I am there|fore re&s;igned to my condition; and can think, without re|pining, of dying a maid, (and I hope an old one) &s;ince I am not to expect a hu&s;band to the wi&s;hes of, Sir, your humble &s;ervant and corre&s;pondent,</P>

<P>Though I doubt not but my fair corre&s;pondent is thor|oughly de&s;erving of the hu&s;band &s;he knows &s;o well how to de&s;cribe, yet I could wi&s;h, for her own &s;ake, as well as for the &s;ake of &s;ome happy man, that &s;he had added a qualify|ing po&s;t&s;cript to her letter, &s;ignifying, that &s;he was willing to make &s;ome little abatement in her demands.

up conveniency for a pro&s;pect, or pro&s;pect for conveniency. In this manner &s;hould a lady act in the choice of an hu&s;|band. If &s;he &s;ets her heart upon a Face, &s;he mu&s;t have no di&s;like to a coxcomb; or if &s;he falls in love with a Mind, a &s;loven &s;hould appear charming; for the odds are again&s;t her, that the hand&s;ome man is the one, and the man of knowledge the other.</P>
<P>Exclu&s;ive of my&s;elf, I know of no &s;uch character as the lady has de&s;cribed: nor dare I &s;ay a word of my own per&s;on and accompli&s;hments, being unfortunately near &s;ev|enty, and a married man.

<P>But before I take leave of my ingenious corre&s;pondent, I promi&s;e her to give notice of the fir&s;t Maid's Hu&s;band that falls within my knowledge; and if &s;he plea&s;es to &s;ig|nify where and when &s;he will be waited upon by any &s;uch gentleman, her commands &s;hall be executed with the nice&s;t punctuality.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE two following relations (one of them of ancient, the other of modern date) afford an in&s;tructive example in each &s;ex, and in the oppo&s;ite extremes of life, of virtue triumphing over &s;trong temptation. They powerfully recommend that purity of di&s;po&s;ition, that &s;uperiority to vicious allurement, which commands univer&s;al re&s;pect; and without which the gay and inexperienced &s;eek in vain for happine&s;s from unhallowed gratifications.</P>
<P>The in&s;tance of the Roman General will &s;hew young men, how great a conqueror appears in governing that lit|tle empire, man. And, whil&s;t it tends to repre&s;s every wanton appetite, it may &s;erve to in&s;pire tho&s;e cha&s;te and re&s;pectful &s;entiments towards the female &s;ex, which alone will in&s;ure the &s;weets of "friend&s;hip" with woman, "&s;oft|ened into love."</P>
<P>The &s;tory of AMANDA will confirm my female readers in their re&s;olution to guard their virtue with more than ve&s;tal con&s;tancy; and will exhibit poverty, with an un|&s;tained &s;oul, as infinitely preferable to the mo&s;t &s;plendid allurements of vice. It will di&s;cover the additional charms, reflected upon the per&s;on of the virtuous fair, even in the eye of the man of plea&s;ure, whil&s;t &s;he rejects his &s;olicitations. It may convince unprincipled men, of the ba&s;ene&s;s and cruelty of &s;tabbing the peace of humble or depre&s;&s;ed families, by alluring from the path of honour their hitherto innocent children; or may prove a &s;tronger &s;ecurity to &s;uch again&s;t their golden &s;nares.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="242" REF="031725_0241_0FEE2081E10B3E68">1. SCIPIO the younger, when only twenty-four years of age, was appointed by the Roman Republic to the command of the army again&s;t the Spaniards. His wi&s;|dom and valour would have done honour to the mo&s;t ex|perienced general. Determined to &s;trike an important blow, he formed a de&s;ign of be&s;ieging Carthagena, then the capital of the Carthaginian empire in Spain. His mea&s;ures were &s;o judiciou&s;ly concerted, and with &s;o much courage and intrepidity pur&s;ued, both by &s;ea and land, that notwith&s;tanding a bold and vigorous defence, the capital was taken by &s;torm. The plunder was immen&s;e. Ten thou&s;and freemen were made pri&s;oners; and above three hundred more, of both &s;exes, were received as ho&s;|tages. One of the latter, a very ancient lady of rank, the wife of Mandonius, watching her opportunity, came out of the crowd, and, throwing her&s;elf at the conqueror's feet, conjured him, with tears in her eyes, to recommend to tho&s;e who had the ladies in their keeping, to have re|gard to their &s;ex and birth.</P>
<P>SCIPIO, who did not under&s;tand her meaning at fir&s;t, a&s;&s;ured her, that he had given orders that they &s;hould not want for any thing. But the lady replied, "The&s;e con|veniencies are not what affect us. In the condition to which fortune hath reduced us, with what ought we not to be contented! I have many other apprehen&s;ions, when I con&s;ider, on one &s;ide, the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of war; and, on the other, the youth and beauty of the prince&s;&s;es which you &s;ee here before us; for as for me, my age protects me from all fear in this re&s;pect." She had with her the daughters of Indibilis, and &s;everal other ladies of high rank, all in the flower of youth, who con&s;idered her as their mother.</P>
<P>SCIPIO then comprehending what the &s;ubject of her fear was, "My own glory, (&s;ays he) and that of the Ro|man people, are concerned in not &s;uffering, that virtue, which ought always to be re&s;pected wherever we find it, &s;hould be expo&s;ed in my camp to a treatment unworthy of it. But you give me a new motive for being more &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in my care of it, in the virtuous &s;olicitude you &s;hew in
<PB N="243" REF="031725_0242_0FEE208AC15D4610">
thinking only of the pre&s;ervation of your honour, in the mid&s;t of &s;o many other objects of fear."</P>
<P>After this conver&s;ation, he committed the care of the ladies to &s;ome officers of experienced prudence, &s;trictly commanding, that they &s;hould treat them with all the re|&s;pect they could pay to the mothers, wives, and daughters of their allies and particular friends.</P>
<P>It was not long before SCIPIO's integrity and virtue were put to the trial. Being retired in his camp, &s;ome of his officers brought him a young virgin of &s;uch exqui&s;ite beauty, that &s;he drew upon her the eyes and admiration of every body. The young conqueror &s;tarted from his &s;eat with confu&s;ion and &s;urpri&s;e; and, like one thunder-&s;truck, &s;eemed to be robbed of that pre&s;ence of mind and &s;elf-po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in a general, and for which SCIPIO was remarkably famous. In a few moments, having ral|lied his &s;traggling &s;pirits, he inquired of the beautiful cap|tive, in the mo&s;t civil and polite manner, concerning her country, birth, and connexions; and, finding that &s;he was contracted to a Celtiberian prince named ALLUCIUS, he ordered both him and the captive's parents to be &s;ent for.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h prince no &s;ooner appeared in his pre&s;ence, than, even before he &s;poke to the father and mother, he took him a&s;ide; and to remove the anxiety he might be in on account of the young lady, he addre&s;&s;ed him in the&s;e words: "You and I are young, which admits of my &s;peak|ing to you with more liberty. Tho&s;e who brought me your future &s;pou&s;e, a&s;&s;ured me, at the &s;ame time, that you loved her with extreme tenderne&s;s: and her beauty left me no room to doubt it. Upon which reflecting, that if, like you, I had though on making an engagement, and were not wholly engro&s;&s;ed with the affairs of my country, I &s;hould de&s;ire, that &s;o honourable and legitimate a pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould find favour; I think my&s;elf happy in the pre&s;ent conjuncture to do you this &s;ervice. Though the fortune of war has made me your ma&s;ter, I de&s;ire to be your friend. Here is your wife: take her, and may the gods ble&s;s you with her. One thing, however, I would have you be fully a&s;&s;ured of, that &s;he has been among&s;t us, as &s;he would have been in the hou&s;e of her father and mother.
<PB N="244" REF="031725_0243_0FEE208C47D71C50">
FAR BE IT FROM SCIPIO TO PURCHASE A LOOSE AND MOMENTARY PLEASURE AT THE EXPENSE OF VIRTUE, HONOUR, AND THE HAPPINESS OF AN HON|EST MAN. No: I have kept her for you, in order to make you a pre&s;ent worthy of you and of me. The only gratitude I require of you for this ine&s;timable gift is, that you would be a friend to the Roman people."</P>
<P>ALLUCIUS's heart was too full to make him any an|&s;wer: but throwing him&s;elf at the general's feet, he wept aloud. The captive fell into the &s;ame po&s;ture; and re|mained &s;o, till the father bur&s;t out into the following words: "Oh! divine SCIPIO! the gods have given you more than human virtue! Oh! glorious leader! Oh! wondrous youth! does not that obliged virgin give you, whil&s;t &s;he prays to the gods for your pro&s;perity, rapture above all the tran&s;ports you could have reaped from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her injured per&s;on?" The relations of the young lady had brought with them a very con&s;iderable &s;um for her ran&s;om: but, when they &s;aw that &s;he was re|&s;tored to them in &s;o generous and godlike a manner, they entreated the conqueror, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, to accept that &s;um as a pre&s;ent; and declared, by his complying, that new favour would complete their joy and gratitude. SCIPIO, not being able to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch warm and earne&s;t &s;o|licitations, told them that he accepted the gift, and order|ed it to be laid at his feet: then addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to ALLUCIUS, "I add," &s;ays he, "to the portion which you are to receive from your father-in-law this &s;um; which I de&s;ire you to accept as a marriage-pre&s;ent."</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider, that SCIPIO was at this time in the prime of life, unmarried, and under no re&s;traint, we cannot but acknowledge, that the conque&s;t he made of him&s;elf was far more glorious than that of the Carthaginian empire: and though his treatment of this captive prince was not more delicate and generous than what might ju&s;tly be expected from a per&s;on endowed with rea&s;on and reflection; yet, con&s;idering how few there are in his circum&s;tances who would have acted as he did, we cannot but applaud his conduct, and propo&s;e him as a &s;uitable example to future ages.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="031725_0244_0FEE208DCF47F8D8">Nor was his virtue unrewarded. The young prince, charmed with the liberality and politene&s;s of SCIPIO, went into his country, to publi&s;h the prai&s;es of &s;o gener|ous a victor. He cried out, in the tran&s;ports of his grati|tude, "That there was come into Spain a young hero like the gods; who conquered all things le&s;s by the force of his arms, than the charms of his virtue and the great|ne&s;s of his beneficence." Upon this report all Celtiberia &s;ubmitted to the Romans; and ALLUCIUS returned in a &s;hout to SCIPIO, at the head of fourteen hundred cho&s;en hor&s;e, to facilitate his future conque&s;ts. To render the marks of his gratitude &s;till more durable, ALLUCIUS cau&s;ed the action we have ju&s;t related to be engraven on a &s;ilver &s;hield, which he pre&s;ented to SCIPIO; a pre&s;ent infinitely more e&s;timable and glorious than all his trea&s;ures and tri|umphs. This buckler, which SCIPIO carried with him when he returned to Rome, was lo&s;t, in pa&s;&s;ing the Rhone, with part of the baggage. It continued in that river till the year 1665, when &s;ome fi&s;hermen found it. It was lately in the royal cabinet of France.</P>
<P N="2">2. AN eminent citizen, who had lived in good fa&s;hion and credit, was, by a train of accidents, and by an una|voidable perplexity in his affairs, reduced to a low condi|tion. There is a mode&s;ty u&s;ually attending faultle&s;s pov|erty, which made him rather choo&s;e to reduce his manner of living to his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, than &s;olicit his friends, in order to &s;upport the &s;hew of an e&s;tate when the &s;ub&s;tance was gone. His wife, who was a woman of &s;en&s;e and virtue, behaved her&s;elf on this occa&s;ion with uncom|mon decency, and never appeared &s;o amiable in his eyes as now. In&s;tead of upbraiding him with the ample fortune &s;he had brought, or the many great offers &s;he had refu&s;ed for his &s;ake, &s;he redoubled all the in&s;tances of her affection, whil&s;t her hu&s;band was continually pouring out his heart to her in complaints, that he had ruined the be&s;t woman in the world. He &s;ometimes came home at a time when &s;he did not expect him, and &s;urpri&s;ed her in tears, which &s;he endeavoured to conceal, and always put on an air of cheerfulne&s;s to receive him. To le&s;&s;en their expen&s;e, their elde&s;t daughter (whom I &s;hall call Amanda) was &s;ent into

the country to the hou&s;e of an hone&s;t farmer, who had married a &s;ervant of the family. This young woman was apprehen&s;ive of the ruin which was approaching, and had privately engaged a friend in the neighbourhood to give her an account of what pa&s;&s;ed from time to time in her father's affairs. Amanda was in the bloom of her youth and beauty, when the lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of the manor, who often called in at the farmer's hou&s;e as he followed his country &s;ports, fell pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her. He was a man of great genero&s;ity, but from a loo&s;e education had contracted a hearty aver&s;ion to marriage. He therefore entertained a de&s;ign upon Amanda's virtue, which at pre&s;ent he thought fit to keep private. The innocent creature, who never &s;u&s;pected his intentions, was plea&s;ed with his per&s;on; and, having ob&s;erved his growing pa&s;&s;ion for her, hoped, by &s;o advantageous a match, &s;he might quickly be in a capacity of &s;upporting her impoveri&s;hed relations. One day, as he called to &s;ee her, he found her in tears over a letter &s;he had ju&s;t received from her friend, which gave an account that her father had lately been &s;tripped of every thing by an execution. The lover, who, with &s;ome difficulty, found out the cau&s;e of her grief, took this occa&s;ion to make her a propo&s;al. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s Aman|da's confu&s;ion, when &s;he found his preten&s;ions were not honourable. She was now de&s;erted of all her hopes, and had no power to &s;peak; but, ru&s;hing from him in the ut|mo&s;t di&s;turbance, locked her&s;elf up in her chamber. He immediately di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to her father with the following letter:

<P>YOUR father and I have ju&s;t now received a letter from a gentleman who pretends love to you, with a propo|&s;al that in&s;ults our misfortunes, and would throw us into a lower degree of mi&s;ery than any thing which is come upon us. How could this barbarous man think that the ten|dere&s;t of parents would be tempted to &s;upply their want by giving up the be&s;t of children to infamy and ruin? It is a mean and cruel artifice to make this propo&s;al, at a time when he thinks our nece&s;&s;ities mu&s;t compel us to any thing; but we will not eat the bread of &s;hame; and there|fore we charge thee not to think of us, but to avoid the &s;nare which is laid for thy virtue.

<P>The me&s;&s;enger, notwith&s;tanding he promi&s;ed to deliver this letter to Amanda, carried it fir&s;t to his ma&s;ter, who he imagined would be glad to have an opportunity of giving it into her hands him&s;elf. His ma&s;ter was impatient to know the &s;ucce&s;s of his propo&s;al, and therefore broke open the letter privately to &s;ee the contents. He was not a little moved at &s;o true a picture of virtue in di&s;tre&s;s; but at the &s;ame time was infinitely &s;urpri&s;ed to find his offers rejected. However, he re&s;olved not to &s;uppre&s;s the let|ter, but carefully &s;ealed it up again, and carried it to Amanda. All his endeavours to &s;ee her were in vain, till &s;he was a&s;&s;ured he brought a letter from her mother. He would not part with it but upon conditions that &s;he &s;hould read it without leaving the room. While &s;he was peru&s;ing it, he fixed his eyes on her face with the deepe&s;t atten|tion: her concern gave a new &s;oftne&s;s to her beauty, and when &s;he bur&s;t into tears, he could no longer refrain from bearing a part in her &s;orrow, and telling her that he too had read the letter, and was re&s;olved to make repara|tion for having been the occa&s;ion of it. My reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee the &s;econd epi&s;tle which he now wrote to Amanda's mother.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM full of &s;hame, and will never forgive my&s;elf, if I have not your pardon for what I lately wrote. It was far from my intention to add trouble to the afflicted; nor could any thing, but my being a &s;tranger to you, have betrayed me into a fault, for which, if I live, I &s;hall en|deavour to make you amends as a &s;on. You cannot be unhappy while Amanda is your daughter; nor &s;hall be, if any thing can prevent it which is in the power of, Madam,</P>

<P>I HAVE re&s;erved, till towards the clo&s;e of this work, a &s;ubject which claims the fixed and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate con|&s;ideration of the younger and inexperienced part of my female readers, e&s;pecially of young heire&s;&s;es, who&s;e num|ber ri&s;es in proportion to the population and wealth of the&s;e STATES. A paternal &s;olicitude for their mo&s;t pre|cious intere&s;ts prompts me as their MENTOR to whi&s;per in their ear &s;ome momentous cautions, confirmed to my view by melancholy facts, and on which <HI>the all of</HI> their future <HI>life</HI> may depend. The ob&s;ervations which follow, may perhaps be received with le&s;s prejudice, when I a&s;|&s;ure them, that their MENTOR is a MINERVA, concealed beneath the form of the AMERICAN SPECTATOR, and does but echo the language of an e&s;timable member of their own &s;ex.</P>
<P>OF all the en&s;naring pa&s;&s;ions to which our hearts are apt to give way, the pa&s;&s;ion of LOVE is one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="251" REF="031725_0250_0FEE20A3CF2B9350">
dangerous, and therefore ought to be carefully guarded again&s;t; as on the prudent choice we make depends the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of our future lives. To form an en|gagement at a very early age, is to run a very great hazard of meeting a di&s;appointment. To carry on a clan|de&s;tine acquaintance with any one, however &s;uperior in birth or fortune, is to degrade our character, and to ren|der our virtue &s;u&s;pected. If any man makes profe&s;&s;ions of love to a young woman, and endeavours to prevail upon her to conceal it from her parents, &s;he may depend upon his profe&s;&s;ions not being &s;incere, and that he has &s;ome bad de&s;ign, which he fears the eye of experience will di&s;cover, and by &s;o doing defeat his di&s;honourable purpo&s;e. If the inclinations are mutual, and &s;ituations equal, &s;ecrecy cannot be nece&s;&s;ary; if, on the contrary, any impediments to an union appear, &s;ufficient to prevent its being brought about with the mutual con&s;ent of friends, it can an&s;wer no other purpo&s;e than to entail mi&s;ery on the youthful parties, by continuing a connexion which mu&s;t end in di&s;appointment and wretchedne&s;s. Never then, my fair readers, li&s;ten to the &s;ecret tale: attend not to the delu&s;ive flatterer, who would by his in&s;inuating ad|dre&s;s prevail upon you to &s;acrifice your duty to the grati|fication of his love, vanity or de&s;igns: and be a&s;&s;ured, the man who would wi&s;h you to be a di&s;obedient daughter, has not the proper value for you which he pretends. And what rea&s;on has &s;uch an one to &s;uppo&s;e that the woman, who would give up her fir&s;t of moral duties, would not as ea&s;ily be prevailed upon to depart from every other? At lea&s;t he would have ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that an undutiful and ungrateful daughter would never make an obedient and faithful wife.</P>
<P>To &s;ee the ill effects of forming imprudent connexions, we need not look far into the world: and it is not to be doubted, but many unhappy marriages owe their greate&s;t mi&s;eries to the unguarded conduct of the parties, previous to their being united. For, however the lover may flat|ter, and pretend to admire the frankne&s;s and genero&s;ity of his mi&s;tre&s;s, for complying with any improper reque&s;ts; however grateful he may appear, for her running the
<PB N="252" REF="031725_0251_0FEE20A5569F07E8">
hazard of di&s;obliging her parents or friends, &s;he may de|pend on being afterwards reproached by the hu&s;band, for the very conduct which was prai&s;ed by the lover. Too often the &s;ource of matrimonial di&s;cord originates from this cau&s;e. Then will their own hearts, in the utmo&s;t bitterne&s;s of angui&s;h, more keenly feel the&s;e reproaches; becau&s;e their con&s;cience will inform them they are but too ju&s;tly de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Until you, my fair readers, know a little of the world, dare not to li&s;ten to the tongue of the flatterer. Be not de&s;irous of being thought to have made captives, le&s;t you your&s;elves become the &s;lave; guard your heart with cau|tion again&s;t the delu&s;ive voice of Love; nor &s;uffer your affections to be engaged, till you are convinced the object of your choice is worthy to po&s;&s;e&s;s the undivided heart of a prudent and virtuous young woman. If you &s;hould by chance meet with an agreeable youth, who you think will captivate your heart, in &s;pite of your utmo&s;t endeavours to detain the unguarded fugitive; if you are not well con|vinced, by the honour of his conduct, you have been as ar|rant a thief as your lover, bani&s;h him forever from your mi&s;guided imagination. It is ea&s;y to conquer a di&s;ea&s;e in its beginning; but if we permit it to gain &s;trength, before we attempt its cure, the be&s;t advice and mo&s;t powerful remedies may fail to effect its removal.</P>
<P>It is an unfortunate and a mi&s;taken notion, which many young people cheri&s;h, that if they marry the fir&s;t object of their tender affection, they mu&s;t be happy.&mdash;Alas! hap|pine&s;s depends on &s;o many concurrent circum&s;tances, that, believe me, the utmo&s;t prudence will not at all times &s;e|cure the prize. The pa&s;&s;ion of Love mu&s;t be reciprocal, or it cannot produce happine&s;s; and, even then, mode&s;ty, good &s;en&s;e, &s;en&s;ibility, and judgment, are requi&s;ite on both &s;ides, to in&s;ure it for any length of time. Friends mu&s;t give their unreluctant con&s;ent, and circum&s;tances mu&s;t be ea&s;y, to render the married life a &s;cene of harmony and contentment: for, however the ridiculous and romantic notions, to be found in many of our modern novels, may &s;erve to mi&s;lead the mind, and involve it in a labyrinth of error, be a&s;&s;ured, love and poverty &s;eldom agree; nor
<PB N="253" REF="031725_0252_0FEE20A8B25E60F0">
are &s;cenes of fa&s;hionable di&s;&s;ipation more congenial to Love. A competence is as nece&s;&s;ary to our happine&s;s as virtue and prudence to our peace of mind, when we retire into our&s;elves, in order to examine our own hearts. How often have we known the fond lover, who fled with &s;uch eagerne&s;s to Gretna-Green, to &s;ecure the prize he pre|tended to adore, &s;oon after his return, prove a carele&s;s, unkind, and incon&s;tant hu&s;band; whil&s;t his equally mi&s;|guided and imprudent companion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, proved her&s;elf a modern wife!</P>
<P>Many &s;ad tragedies has Love produced in the world from many different and &s;ad cau&s;es. The following &s;tory will more &s;trikingly illu&s;trate my pre&s;ent &s;ubject than any farther arguments which I could u&s;e. May it have its due weight, and the mi&s;eries occa&s;ioned by the errors of the parties prevent any one from daring to follow their ex|amples!</P>
<P>HARRIET Darnly was the daughter of a reputable mer|cer, who lived in London, and who had a numerous family. Unfortunately for Harriet, who was a very lovely, but a very vain and weak girl, &s;he had two thou&s;and pounds left her by an uncle, which was to be hers when &s;he arrived to the age of twenty-one. Mr. Darnly had, at the time this legacy was left Harriet, an apprentice, of the name of Henley. This young man, who had every advantage of figure to captivate, was tired of the drudgery of the &s;hop, and heartily weary of confinement. He had long wi&s;hed to purcha&s;e a commi&s;&s;ion in the army. Harriet beheld Edward Henley, unknown to her parents, with tender partiality, and had given every encouragement to his hopes. The attentions which his vanity more than his affection had led him to pay her, unhappily obtained her love. She would take every opportunity of &s;itting in the &s;hop, and gave him every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that an of|fer of his heart would not be unacceptable.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was it known that Harriet's uncle had left her &s;o con&s;iderable a legacy, than he took the earlie&s;t op|portunity of making a declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion. The unguarded fair one too ea&s;ily di&s;covered to her artful lover
<PB N="254" REF="031725_0253_0FEE20AFB0585F90">
the progre&s;s he had already made in gaining her affections; and knowing that Mr. Darnly had with too much rea&s;on been offended with his carele&s;s inattention to bu&s;ine&s;s, prevailed upon the unhappy girl not to di&s;clo&s;e to any one the conque&s;t &s;he had made, till, by the regularity and &s;teadine&s;s of his future conduct, he had effected a perfect reconciliation with her father, and per&s;uaded his own to make proper propo&s;als.</P>
<P>Engaged in a clande&s;tine acquaintance with one equally gay as worthle&s;s, Harriet was led from one &s;tep of impru|dence to another, and granted her lover &s;uch frequent interviews, that to marry was become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. To Gretna-Green they went: the lady wanted only a few weeks of being of age. As &s;oon as &s;he was &s;o, her prof|ligate hu&s;band demanded her fortune, bought a commi&s;|&s;ion, and, when he had &s;pent what remained, by his regi|ment being ordered abroad, left his wife and child, which, at his departure, was only two months old, to all the hor|rors of unprotected mi&s;ery and threatening poverty.</P>
<P>Mr. Darnly, at the interpo&s;ition of &s;ome friends, was, with &s;ome difficulty, prevailed upon to permit his once darling daughter to return to her paternal home, and to receive her with &s;ome degree of affection; but as neither he, nor her mother, could ever bring them&s;elves entirely to forget the deceit &s;he practi&s;ed with them to her own undoing, and as her brothers and &s;i&s;ters now looked upon her with an eye of jealous envy, &s;he is frequently obliged to bear reproaches, which her own heart, con|&s;cious of having but too well de&s;erved them, knows not how to &s;upport.&mdash;Whil&s;t &s;he &s;ees her &s;i&s;ters ea&s;y, gay and happy, her brothers cheerful and content, &s;he feels the mi&s;ery of her own &s;ituation with redoubled angui&s;h, and when &s;he looks on her little girl, often trembles le&s;t &s;he, like her&s;elf, &s;hould fall a victim to her own imprudence.</P>
<P>The worthle&s;s cau&s;e of her having &s;trayed from the paths of prudence, and di&s;regarded the calls of duty, lives abroad, on the income of that fortune which was given to make her happy, and never had the humanity to &s;end her a &s;ingle line, or to make any inquiries after the poor victim of his ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="031725_0254_0FEE20B13A12AB30">Be warned, fair daughters of innocence, by the wretch|ed Harriet. Attempt not to deceive your parents. Let her example prevail upon you to believe, the mo&s;t flatter|ing appearances may conceal depravity, and that the prot|e&s;tations of a clande&s;tine lover are &s;eldom meant but to betray.</P>

<P>BEAUTY is a captivating, but fading flower, which often leads its youthful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors into many dangers, many di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Happy is it for tho&s;e who are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for their outward charms, that they are &s;heltered under the parental roof! Happy for them that the watch|ful eye regards them with rigid circum&s;pection. Few, in the early periods of life, are in&s;en&s;ible to flattery, or deaf to the voice of adulation. Beware of the flatterer: be not deceived by fair &s;peeches. Be a&s;&s;ured, the man who wi&s;hes to render you vain of your outward charms, has a mean opinion of your &s;en&s;e and mental qualifications. Remember, too, that a young girl, vain of her beauty, and who&s;e chief &s;tudy and employment is the decoration of her per&s;on, is a mo&s;t contemptible character; and that the more you are di&s;tingui&s;hed for the charms of your face and the graces of your form, the more you are expo&s;ed to cen&s;ure and to danger. The ro&s;e is torn from its parent &s;tem in all its pride of beauty; the je&s;&s;amine is &s;carcely permitted to blo&s;&s;om before it is plucked, and no &s;ooner are their beauties faded, than the mercile&s;s hand which was eager to obtain them throws them away with con|tempt; whil&s;t the primro&s;e, the humble violet, the lily of
<PB N="257" REF="031725_0256_0FEE20B9C4D964E0">
the valley, and the &s;now-drop, le&s;s expo&s;ed to ob&s;ervation, e&s;cape unhurt, and uninjured by the &s;poiler's hand.</P>
<P>Learn, fair daughters of Beauty, from the lily to court the friendly &s;hade; and from the primro&s;e be convinced, that your be&s;t &s;ecurity may be found in retirement. If you wi&s;h to be admired, be &s;eldom &s;een; and if you are de&s;irous of having a &s;incere lover in your train, let virtue, mode&s;ty and &s;weetne&s;s be the only lures you make u&s;e of to en&s;nare. You may then, perhaps, by your good quali|ties, retain the heart which was at fir&s;t a captive to your beauties; and when time has robbed you of the graces and the innocent cheerfulne&s;s of youth, &s;ecure a &s;incere and tender friend to con&s;ole you in the hours of affliction, and watch over you when deprived of tho&s;e charms that fir&s;t made him &s;olicitous to obtain your love.</P>
<P>Repine not, my young readers, though your virtues be concealed in a homely form. If you have &s;ecured the virtues of the mind, you need not envy others the beauties of the face. And ye, who are decorated with every out|ward grace, be not vain of &s;uch fading externals; but tremble, le&s;t they &s;hould tempt the de&s;igning to lead you into error.</P>
<Q><L>Had you le&s;s beauteous been, you'd known le&s;s care;</L>
<L>Ladies are happie&s;t moderately fair.</L>
<BIBL>ETHEREGE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Neglect not, then, in the giddy hours of youth, to make your mind a fit companion for the mo&s;t lovely form. Per|&s;onal charms may plea&s;e for a moment; but the more la&s;t|ing beauties of an improved under&s;tanding and intelligent mind can never tire. We are &s;oon weary of looking at a picture, though executed in the mo&s;t ma&s;terly &s;tyle: and the woman who has only beauty to recommend her, has but little chance of meeting a lover who will not grow in|different to a mere portrait, particularly when its colours are faded by the &s;ubduing hand of time. Then it is that mode&s;ty and &s;weetne&s;s of temper are to be particularly ob|&s;erved; and the lo&s;s of beauty will not be regretted even by the man they fir&s;t made your captive.</P>

<P>A LIVELY imagination is, if I may u&s;e Shake&s;peare's expre&s;&s;ion, great Nature's &s;econd cour&s;e; for, not content to have enjoyed the intellectual plea&s;ures immedi|ately ari&s;ing from the beauty of external objects, or the tran&s;ient &s;cenes of life, it frequently, when they have van|i&s;hed and di&s;appeared, makes fond excur&s;ions after them again; and even in our &s;leep, it will occa&s;ionally recal the objects of our waking reflection, and from thence receive livelier &s;en&s;ations, than were perhaps occa&s;ioned by the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. Though there are many fanta&s;tic circum|&s;tances in the&s;e night-thoughts, if I may be &s;o allowed to call our dreams, yet on the&s;e occa&s;ions, we &s;ometimes find our&s;elves pre&s;ented with agreeable vi&s;ions, and, amid&s;t the wilde&s;t vagaries of fancy, we can often trace &s;omething like ju&s;t rea&s;oning, and a real picture of life. As I take this to have been the ca&s;e with me a few nights &s;ince, I &s;hall make no apology for pre&s;enting my readers with my dream.</P>
<P>I found my&s;elf, on a &s;udden, near a large intricate wood, which I had the curio&s;ity to enter. A whim&s;ical band of hope and fear, joy and grief, pain and plea&s;ure hovered over our heads. Tender angui&s;h, &s;oft de&s;ire, plea&s;ing agony, were all intermixed, and in their motley livery formed a many coloured group. Cupid made vio|lent work with his darts and flames, and nothing was to be heard but tinkling rills, falling fountains, and love-&s;ick &s;ighs, by which the a&s;pen leaves were perpetually kept in ru&s;tling tremor. The god of love had by him a pro|digious quantity of arrows, differently feathered, according
<PB N="260" REF="031725_0259_0FEE20C03171AF30">
to the various effects, of which they were to be productive. This circum&s;tance called to my mind a beautiful pa&s;&s;age in a poem by Doctor Parnell.</P>
<Q><L>And ev'ry dart can boa&s;t a kind,</L>
<L>Which &s;uits each proper turn of mind.</L>
<L>From the tow'ring eagle's plume</L>
<L>The gen'rous hearts accept their doom.</L>
<L>Shot by the peacock's painted eye</L>
<L>The vain and airy lovers die.</L>
<L>For careful dames and frugal men</L>
<L>The &s;hafts are &s;peckled by the hen.</L>
<L>The pyes and parrots deck the darts,</L>
<L>When prattling wins the panting hearts.</L>
<L>When from the voice the pa&s;&s;ions &s;pring,</L>
<L>The warbling finch affords a wing:</L>
<L>Together, by the &s;parrow &s;tung,</L>
<L>Down fall the wanton and the young;</L>
<L>And fledg'd by gee&s;e the weapons fly,</L>
<L>When others love they know not why.</L></Q>
<P>It was not unplea&s;ant to ob&s;erve the variety of impre&s;|&s;ions that were occa&s;ioned in both &s;exes by this &s;trange flight of arrows. Men I perceived in clo&s;e pur&s;uit of blooming virgins, merely from the impul&s;e of vanity; and I &s;aw &s;everal nymphs running with the utmo&s;t precipitation, from their lovers; though by their manner of looking back, and the ru&s;tling they made in the trees, there was room for conjecture that they did not de&s;ire entirely to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ing as the &s;en&s;ations of love are, I could ob&s;erve that very unhappy effects were often the con&s;equences. Many there were who&s;e mien &s;poke a dejection of &s;pirits, and they were frequently driven to &s;uch extremes, that they laid violent hands on their own lives. As I travelled on, I &s;aw &s;everal hanging on boughs of trees; and on the waters, which were &s;welled with tears, and ruffled with &s;ighs, floated many a pallid corp&s;e; in their countenances

<P>From this &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, I turned away as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and was relieved from my unea&s;ine&s;s, by the &s;ight of a few, who &s;eemed to be happy in their pa&s;&s;ion; who&s;e hearts felt a mutual warmth, and who&s;e eyes were brightened into gladne&s;s. They walked arm in arm down the flowery meads, interchanging mutual glances of affec|tion; though ever and anon &s;ucceeded anger, &s;u&s;picion, open war, and peace again. In the centre of the wood, &s;tood a temple &s;acred to Virtue, where all, who were de|&s;irous of leading a life of happine&s;s, were directed to bend their cour&s;e, in order there to be united together in bands of cha&s;te affection. I was &s;orry to find that &s;ome of the ladies had not re&s;olution to per&s;evere in this path: wheth|er it was owing to loo&s;e de&s;ires of &s;educing temptation, I cannot decide; certain it is, they tired in their journey, and &s;tepped a&s;ide with their paramours to &s;eque&s;tered bowers; whence they were afterwards di&s;carded into the thorny parts of the wood, for the remainder of their days; but even of the&s;e, a few there were, who, after their di|gre&s;&s;ion, &s;till found means to be introduced into the tem|ple; whither they were however pur&s;ued by an old hag, called Scandal, who never yet has been known to let them entirely efface the remembrance of their error.</P>
<P>The ladies who kept on a due cour&s;e, never failed to lead the men in captivity after them to the temple, whence, after a &s;hort ceremony, they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in pairs, to commence the road of life. Three different paths were opened to their choice, and a guide &s;tood at each entrance to receive them. The fir&s;t was of a cold di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate temper, who took every thing alike, and his name was Indifference. The &s;econd had eyes of a green|i&s;h ca&s;t, and he &s;eemed to loathe the food, which he not|with&s;tanding eagerly followed; this per&s;onage was called Jealou&s;y. And the third, by an openne&s;s of countenance, a &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of quick &s;en&s;ibility and cordial affection, was known to be Friend&s;hip. Too many gave them&s;elves up to Indifference, and in&s;tantly an inattention to each other's wants &s;ucceeded in their brea&s;ts; the men betook
<PB N="262" REF="031725_0261_0FEE20C8C3CF9218">
them&s;elves to midnight &s;houts and revelry, and the fair to parties of tea, and routs, by which means every &s;park of love was &s;oon extingui&s;hed, and the gratification of their own &s;eparate inclinations was their only &s;tudy.</P>
<P>The walks of Jealou&s;y were craggy, dangerous, and &s;teep, full of thorns, briars, and brambles. In the heart, where before gladne&s;s and joy revelled &s;ecure, aro&s;e anxi|ety, di&s;tru&s;t, and perturbation of &s;pirit. The di&s;tempered fancy &s;tarted at &s;cenes of its own creation, and, in a fit of madne&s;s, hurried many a tortured wretch down the preci|pice of fate, or let fall its vengeance on its neighbour. What was ob&s;ervable in this part was, that though &s;ome|times there were the appearances, the real foot&s;teps of guilt could no where be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The very &s;mall number under the guidance of Friend|&s;hip enjoyed a pure heart-felt tranquillity; and the fierce de&s;ire and impatient wi&s;h, which had formerly actuated their minds, having now &s;ub&s;ided, a &s;teady and uniform flame &s;ucceeded, not unlike the mild refre&s;hing air of a placid evening, after the fervour of an hot &s;ummer's day. Glad &s;um ro&s;e over their heads, and kindly nights lulled them in each other's arms. A &s;miling race grew up around them, and the culture of their young and tender minds afforded a plea&s;ing employment; they journeyed on through life, ble&s;&s;ed with the &s;un&s;hine of the &s;oul, till, at length, the ea&s;y di&s;&s;olution of Nature put a period to all human felicity.</P>
<P>Here I could not help exclaiming with the poet;
<Q><L>O grant me thus to live, and thus to die!</L>
<L>Who &s;prung from kings, &s;hall know le&s;s joy than I.</L></Q></P>
<P>The whole &s;cene appeared &s;o completely happy, that I began to feel &s;ome approaches towards envy; which &s;o di&s;compo&s;ed my &s;pirits, that I was in&s;tantly awaked, and the ideal pro&s;pect vani&s;hed into air.</P>

<HEAD>CONJUGAL AND DOMESTIC HAPPINESS.</HEAD>
<P>I WONDER, &s;aid Leander to Eugenio, why the matrimonial and dome&s;tic &s;tate, which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of human beings, and to which the &s;exes are &s;o naturally and &s;o &s;trongly inclined, &s;hould prove the &s;ource of &s;o much di&s;&s;atisfaction and unhappine&s;s. Why is it, my friend, that a union &s;o endearing as that between hu&s;band and wife, and a circle &s;o connected and intere&s;t|ing as that of a family, &s;hould neverthele&s;s fail of produ|cing its de&s;irable and de&s;igned effects, and, with all its pro|mi&s;ing ingredients of happine&s;s, &s;hould be able to make &s;o few of tho&s;e happy, who form and compo&s;e it?</P>
<P>The fault, &s;aid Eugenio, is not in the original in&s;titu|tion, nor in the &s;tate it&s;elf, but in the parties who enter into it. This world, indeed, is not the re&s;idence of felici|ty; and man is too imperfect and depraved to find in any &s;tate a felicity that is uninterrupted and permanent. But &s;ome plea&s;ures, rational and manly plea&s;ures, there are in every condition of life, and in every relation. In the matrimonial and parental connexion, provi&s;ion is made, by our benevolent Creator, for enjoyments more nume|rous, and more refined, than in any other; and it is hu|man folly and perver&s;ene&s;s alone which blights and dimin|i&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s them.</P>
<P>Be &s;o good then, &s;aid Leander, as to favour me with your directions and advice in this affair; to point out the errors to be &s;hunned, and the &s;teps to be taken, that when|ever I ri&s;e to the conjugal and patriarchal dignity, I may not &s;ink in perpetual gloom and wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>The grand &s;ecret of happine&s;s in any &s;tate we have the choice of, replied Eugenio, is to enter it with deliberation, with a wi&s;e &s;election of a&s;&s;ociates, with a re&s;olution to per|form the duties of it, to do our part to lighten the evils
<PB N="264" REF="031725_0263_0FEE20CBD48693E0">
of it, and on the whole to make the be&s;t of it. Was the nuptial and dome&s;tic &s;tate entered into with &s;uch precau|tions and intentions, it would be found, as our Supreme Parent de&s;igned it, and as the &s;tate it&s;elf is fitted to be, a mo&s;t de&s;irable, dignified and delightful &s;tate, productive of more rational and &s;entimental &s;atisfactions than any other. To enter without judgment or forethought into the mo&s;t important connexion; to choo&s;e at random, or as fancy or pa&s;&s;ion &s;hall dictate, a partner for life, a bo&s;om friend and companion, is by no means &s;etting out wi&s;ely, or lay|ing a &s;ure foundation for happine&s;s. And &s;hould &s;uch as &s;et out in this manner, drag their exi&s;tence painfully along, and find the garland of matrimony, &s;o ha&s;tily gathered, entwined with nettles as well as ro&s;es, and even with &s;er|pents among the flowers, they will have no rea&s;on to con|demn the &s;tate, but their own imprudence.</P>
<P>Where there is a nece&s;&s;ary union of per&s;ons, of cares and of intere&s;ts, there a union of hearts and affections is indi&s;pen&s;able. This &s;hews that the exerci&s;e of judgment and deliberation is requi&s;ite to matrimonial and do|me&s;tic happine&s;s. For a congeniality of nature, a &s;imi|larity of ta&s;te, and a cordiality of affection, which are all e&s;&s;ential ingredients in the compo&s;ition of nuptial felicity, are too delicate flowers to bloom on every bu&s;h, or to be gathered by an undi&s;tingui&s;hing hand. As a &s;erene &s;atis|faction re&s;ults from the &s;teady performance of duty and the con&s;tant exerci&s;e of mutual tenderne&s;s, &s;o negligence, coldne&s;s and unfaithfulne&s;s, will inevitably incur blame and produce unea&s;ine&s;s. Vain therefore is the hope of conju|gal and dome&s;tic endearment, or tranquillity, where there is the want of conjugal or dome&s;tic affection and duty.</P>
<P>That there is a nece&s;&s;ary intermixture of troubles with joys in the dome&s;tic life, is readily acknowledged: And &s;o there is in every condition. But it is the part of manly wi&s;dom to palliate the evils which cannot be cured; it is the part of patience to bear without complaining the evils which cannot be palliated; and it is the part of religion to annihilate &s;maller evils, and to turn every evil into a good. With &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, qualifications and aids as the&s;e, hu&s;bands and wives, parents and children, will be happy
<PB N="265" REF="031725_0264_0FEE20D4D381D5E0">
in one another, and con&s;titute a happy family. Let a man then who is &s;etting out in life, and wi&s;hes to lay a founda|tion for dome&s;tic peace and enjoyment, choo&s;e a partner who will be likely to harmonize with him in all the laudable pur&s;uits of his &s;tation, and in all the joys and &s;orrows of which his hone&s;t and feeling heart may be &s;en&s;ible, and let him form the re&s;olution which a renowned I&s;raeliti&s;h gen|eral and &s;tate&s;man formed of old, and every one will al|low that he makes a hopeful beginning.</P>
<P>For my part, I cannot figure to my&s;elf a &s;cene more plea&s;ing among human beings, than a family cemented by the endearing &s;ympathies of nature, and united &s;till more &s;trongly by the tenderne&s;s of a cultivated affection and e&s;teem, and all under the governing influence of prudence and religion. The happy pair who are the heads of &s;uch a family, experience the mo&s;t delightful &s;en&s;ations in viewing the innocence and the improvements of their ri&s;ing offspring, and in contemplating their future u&s;efulne&s;s and pro&s;perity. And the children of &s;uch a family, both loving and duti|ful, enjoy the livelie&s;t &s;atisfaction in &s;eeing and making one another, and their parents, happy.</P>
<P>True indeed it is, that neither &s;ympathy, nor union, nor innocence, nor virtue, nor religion, will &s;hield a family from the inroads of misfortune, from the attacks of di&s;ea&s;e, or from the depredations of death. But a family, where harmony prevails, tenderne&s;s endears, and religion pre&s;ides, is in the be&s;t preparation to receive, and in the be&s;t di&s;po|&s;ition to bear, the mo&s;t painful allotments.</P>

<HEAD>Letter to a young Gentleman upon his Mar|riage.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I RECEIVED the news of your marriage with infinite delight, and hope that the &s;incerity with which I wi&s;h your happine&s;s, may excu&s;e the liberty I take, in giving you a few rules, whereby more certainly to obtain it. I &s;ee you &s;mile at my wrong-headed kindne&s;s, and, reflecting on the charms of your bride, cry out in a rapture, that you are happy enough without my rules. I know you are; but after one of the forty years, which I hope you will pa&s;s plea&s;ingly together, are over, this letter may come in turn, and rules for felicity may not be found unnece&s;&s;ary, however &s;ome of them may appear impracticable.</P>
<P>When your pre&s;ent violence of pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub&s;ides, however, and a more cool and tranquil affection takes its place, be not ha&s;ty to cen&s;ure your&s;elf as indifferent, or to lament your&s;elf as unhappy; you have lo&s;t that only which it was impo&s;&s;ible to retain, and it were gracele&s;s, amid the plea&s;ures of a pro&s;perous &s;ummer, to regret the blo&s;&s;oms of a tran&s;ient &s;pring. Neither unwarily condemn your bride's in&s;ipidity, till you have recollected, that no object, however &s;ublime, no &s;ounds, however charming, can con|tinue to tran&s;port us with delight, when they no longer &s;trike us with novelty. The &s;kill to renovate the powers of plea&s;ing is &s;aid indeed to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;ome women in an eminent degree, but the artifices of maturity are &s;el|dom &s;een to adorn the innocence of youth; you have made your choice, and ought to approve it.</P>
<P>Satiety follows quick upon the heels of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and to be happy, we mu&s;t always have &s;omething in view. The per&s;on of your lady is already all your own, and will not grow more plea&s;ing in your eyes I doubt, though the re&s;t
<PB N="267" REF="031725_0266_0FED37FEF9DDA4F8">
of your &s;ex will think her hand&s;omer for the&s;e dozen years. Turn therefore all your attention to her mind, which will daily g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow brighter by poli&s;hing. Study &s;ome ea&s;y &s;cience together, and acquire a &s;imilarity of ta&s;tes, while you enjoy a community of plea&s;ures. You will, by this means, have many images in common, and be freed from the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eparating, to find amu&s;ement; noth|ing is &s;o dangerous to wedded love, as the po&s;&s;ibility of either being happy out of the company of the other; en|deavour therefore to cement the pre&s;ent intimacy on every &s;ide; let your wife never be kept ignorant of your income, your expen&s;es, your friend&s;hips, or aver&s;ions; let her know your very faults, but make them amiable by your virtues; con&s;ider all concealment as a breach of fidelity; let her never have any thing to find out in your character, and re|member, that, from the moment one of the partners turns &s;py upon the other, they have commenced a &s;tate of ho&s;|tility.</P>
<P>Seek not for happine&s;s in &s;ingularity; and dread a re|finement of wi&s;dom as a deviation into folly. Li&s;ten not to tho&s;e &s;ages who advi&s;e you always to &s;corn the coun&s;el of a woman, and if you comply with her reque&s;ts, pro|nounce you to be wife-ridden.</P>
<P>With regard to expen&s;e, I can only ob&s;erve, that the money laid out in the purcha&s;e of di&s;tinction is &s;eldom or ever profitably employed. We live in an age, when &s;plendid furniture and glittering equipage are grown too common, to catch the notice of the meane&s;t &s;pectator, and for the greater ones, they only regard our wa&s;teful folly with &s;ilent contempt, or open indignation. This may perhaps be a di&s;plea&s;ing reflection, but the following con&s;id|eration ought to make amends. The age we live in pays, I think, peculiar attention to the higher di&s;tinctions of wit, knowledge, and virtue, to which we may more &s;afely, more cheaply, and more honourably a&s;pire.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, that the per&s;on of your lady would not grow more plea&s;ing to you, but pray let her never &s;u&s;pect that it grows le&s;s &s;o: that a woman will pardon an affront to her under&s;tanding much &s;ooner than one to her per&s;on, is well known; nor will any of us contradict the a&s;&s;ertion. All

our attainments, all our are arts employed to gain and keep the heart of man; and what mortification can exceed the di&s;appointment, if the end be not obtained! There is no reproof, however pointed, no puni&s;hment, however &s;evere, that a woman of &s;pirit will not prefer to neglect; and if &s;he can endure it without complaint, it only proves, that &s;he mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> make her&s;elf amends by the attention of others, for the &s;lights of her hu&s;band. For this, and for every rea&s;on, it behoves a married man not to let his politene&s;s fail, though his ardour may abate, but to retain, at lea&s;t, that general civility towards his own lady, which he is &s;o willing to pay to every other, and not &s;hew a wife of eigh|teen or twenty years old, that every man in company can treat her with more complai&s;ance, than he, who &s;o often vowed to her eternal fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is not my opinion, that a young woman &s;hould be in|dulged in every wild wi&s;h of her gay heart or giddy head, but contradiction may be &s;oftened by dome&s;tic kindne&s;s, and quiet plea&s;ures &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of noi&s;y ones. Public amu&s;ements, <HI>if they be not &s;o expen&s;ive</HI> as is &s;ome|times imagined, tend to alienate the minds of married peo|ple from each other. A well-cho&s;en &s;ociety of friends and acquaintance, more eminent for virtue and good &s;en&s;e, than for gaiety and &s;plendor, where the conver&s;ation of the day may afford comment for the evening, &s;eems the mo&s;t rational plea&s;ure this great town can afford.</P>
<P>The bane of married happine&s;s among many city men has been, that, finding them&s;elves unfit for polite life, they transferred their vanity to their ladies, dre&s;&s;ed them up gaily, and &s;ent them out gallanting, while the good man was to regale with port wine or rum-punch, perhaps among mean companions, after the compting-hou&s;e was &s;hut; this practice produced the ridicule thrown on them in all our comedies and novels &s;ince commerce began to pro&s;per. But now that I am &s;o near the &s;ubject, a word or two on jealou&s;y may not be ami&s;s; for though not a failing of the pre&s;ent age's growth, yet the &s;eeds of it are too certainly &s;own in every warm bo&s;om for us to neglect it as a fault of no con&s;equence. If you are ever tempted to be jealous, watch your wife narrowly, but never
<PB N="269" REF="031725_0268_0FEE20DD1241B4C0">
teaze her: tell her your jealou&s;y, but conceal your &s;u&s;|picion; let her, in &s;hort, be &s;atisfied that it is only your odd temper, and even trouble&s;ome attachment, that makes you follow her; but let her not dream that you ever doubted &s;eriou&s;ly of her virtue, even for a moment. If &s;he is di&s;po&s;ed towards jealou&s;y of you, let me be&s;eech you to be always explicit with her, and never my&s;terious: be above delighting in her pain, of all things,&mdash;nor do your bu&s;ine&s;s, nor pay your vi&s;its, with an air of concealment, when all you are doing might as well be proclaimed per|haps in the pari&s;h ve&s;try. But I will hope better than this of your tenderne&s;s and of your virtue, and will relea&s;e you from a lecture you have &s;o very little need of, unle&s;s your extreme youth, and uncommon regard, will excu&s;e it. And now, farewel; make my kinde&s;t compliments to your wife, and be happy in proportion as happine&s;s is wi&s;hed you, by, dear Sir, &amp;c.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Tale which occupies this paper coincides with the original plan of rendering the MATRIMO|NIAL PRECEPTOR <HI>various,</HI> and <HI>exten&s;ively beneficial.</HI> The Author hopes, that it may lead affluent parents to determine, never to &s;acrifice the feelings or the felicity of their children at the &s;hrine of avarice, or pride; and <HI>ever</HI> to prefer <HI>mental worth,</HI> in introducing them to the matri|monial &s;tate. When a character like PLOMER has gained the heart of an amiable young lady, who nobly prefers me|rit to fortune; may &s;he find in tho&s;e who have the direc|tion of her hand, a readine&s;s to gratify her honourable pa&s;&s;ion; and hear from their lips the generous accents of a HARTLEY, "YOUR HAPPINESS IS OURS, AND WHAT|EVER GIVES JOY TO YOU IS TO US AN EQUAL BLES|SING!"</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>THE MAID OF THE HAMLET. A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>LAURA was one of the &s;ix daughters of Mr. Hart|ley, who re&s;ided in a &s;mall village in the county of Here|ford, on an e&s;tate which he inherited from his ance&s;tors. Laura was the elde&s;t child; and from her birth had been the favourate of a maiden aunt, who left the whole of her property to her infant niece. The amount of the old lady's per&s;onal e&s;tate was very con&s;iderable; and that of her real, formed an income of five hundred pounds a year. The re&s;idence of this relative was at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the village; and, being &s;urrounded by a few &s;cattered cottages, was denominated the Hamlet. Hence the heir to her fortunes acquired the appellation of&mdash;"<HI>The Maid of the Hamlet.</HI>"</P>
<P>When Laura had attained her eighteenth year, &s;he found her&s;elf &s;urrounded by a numerous levee of admirers:
<PB N="271" REF="031725_0270_0FEE20E3C7524098">
&s;ome of whom paid their court with a view of &s;haring the e&s;tabli&s;hment which her departed relative had provided her: others were actuated by le&s;s intere&s;ted motives; but none had effected the &s;malle&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on her heart.</P>
<P>Among the circle of her acquaintance was admitted the only &s;on of the curate of the village: a youth of mode&s;t mien, and una&s;&s;uming manners. Vincent Plomer had a heart &s;u&s;ceptible of the mo&s;t tender &s;en&s;ations; can it then be wondered at, that the united efforts of worth and beau|ty, which were eminently con&s;picuous in the mind and per&s;on of the fair Laura, &s;hould kindle in his brea&s;t the ardent flame of love? Such, indeed, were their effects on the humble Vincent; yet dare he not reveal the &s;ecret of his fondne&s;s. With much concern, his aged father &s;aw the alteration which was daily making in his con&s;titution: frequently would he urge him to di&s;clo&s;e the cau&s;e of the grief that preyed on his mind, and drained from his cheek the bloom of health. Still he denied that he was unhap|py; and &s;trove, by a forced cheerfulne&s;s, to convince his friends of their mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Vincent, during his re&s;idence at the Univer&s;ity, among his numerous &s;tudies, had made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the &s;cience of Mu&s;ic, of which he was always pa&s;&s;ionately fond. He played on &s;everal in&s;truments; but his favour|ite one was the German-flute, his execution on which was exqui&s;itely fine.</P>
<P>Laura, who was al&s;o much attached to mu&s;ic, would frequently importune Vincent to play her &s;ome of the mo&s;t favourite airs then in vogue; and the plea&s;ure he received in obeying the wi&s;hes of a woman whom he loved, was too great to be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Calling accidentally in one of her evening walks at the par&s;onage, &s;he di&s;covered Vincent in his &s;tudy, &s;itting at a table with a pencil in his hand, in the attitude of drawing. So attentive was he on the &s;ubject before him, that he heard not the entrance of Laura; who, cro&s;&s;ing the room with &s;oft and wary &s;tep, peeped over his &s;houlder, and be|held an admirable likene&s;s of her&s;elf nearly in a fini&s;hed &s;tate.</P>
<P>The thought, which &s;he had long cheri&s;hed, that he en|tertained a fond regard for the original, at this moment re|curred
<PB N="272" REF="031725_0271_0FEE20E54DD100A8">
to her mind with increa&s;ed force; and &s;he con|cluded, that the concealment of his pa&s;&s;ion was the cau&s;e of his declining health and dejected &s;pirits. Retreating a few paces from his chair, &s;he &s;aluted the attentive arti&s;t, who in&s;tantly ro&s;e; and, by his embarra&s;&s;ed addre&s;s, con|firmed the &s;u&s;picion &s;he had imbibed.</P>
<P>To the eyes of Laura, the features of Vincent were more than u&s;ually pale and languid. She intimated her thoughts of the vi&s;ible decline there appeared in his con|&s;titution; ob&s;erved, that the alteration could only be at|tributed to &s;ome hidden cau&s;e, which preyed on his mind; and lamented the error he committed in denying his friends the privilege of partaking in his &s;orrows, and admini&s;tering to his griefs.</P>
<P>Vincent thanked her for the concern &s;he expre&s;&s;ed for his happine&s;s; and a&s;&s;ured her that he &s;hould ever retain a due &s;en&s;e of the friend&s;hip and e&s;teem with which &s;he honoured him.</P>
<P>"Come, come, Vincent," &s;aid Laura, with a &s;mile of bewitching &s;weetne&s;s, "make me your confidante. I will not betray the tru&s;t, on my honour. Say, has not &s;ome girl got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your heart? and is not love the &s;ource of your unea&s;ine&s;s?"</P>
<P>Vincent &s;ighed heavily; and, taking up his flute, played, in the mo&s;t pathetic manner&mdash;
"How &s;weet the love that meets return!"</P>
<P>His fair auditor li&s;tened with the mo&s;t profound atten|tion to the melancholy cadence of this favourite air; and Vincent, ca&s;ting a glance on the attentive beauty, &s;aw the tears of &s;en&s;ibility gli&s;tening in her lovely eyes. It was a favourable omen. A beam of joy darted through his frame; the dawn of hope ro&s;e in his lorn bo&s;om; and though it did not remove, it in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;&s;ipated, the gloom of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>"What favoured object, Madam," &s;aid Vincent, per|ceiving Laura deeply ab&s;orbed in thought, "has the hap|pine&s;s to engage your attention?" The lucid drop &s;till trembled in her eye, and an involuntary &s;igh e&s;caped her bo&s;om. "Has my too officious care," re&s;umed the anx|ious

youth, "to oblige the lovely Laura, waked in her mind the remembrance of &s;ome painful incident? Does &s;he in &s;ilence mourn the pangs of unrequited love? It can|not be! Such worth, &s;uch beauty, the colde&s;t heart&mdash;"</P>
<P>The unexpected entrance of his father checked the rap|turous Vincent, and barred the progre&s;s of a conver&s;ation which promi&s;ed to be very intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>Mr. Plomer, after paying his re&s;pects to Laura, ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Vincent&mdash;who had taken the opportu|nity which his father's conver&s;ation with Mi&s;s Hartley afforded, to recover him&s;elf from the embarra&s;&s;ment he &s;elf at this &s;udden and unexpected interruption&mdash;"I have ju&s;t received a letter," &s;aid Mr. Plomer, "from my college friend, who informs me, that he has obtained a curacy for you &s;ome &s;hort di&s;tance from Cambridge. I therefore would have you, my &s;on, return to the Univer&s;ity; and, at the en&s;uing ordination, receive the nece&s;&s;ary qualifications for accepting the office he has generou&s;ly employed his intere&s;t to procure."</P>
<P>"Your wi&s;hes, Sir," returned Vincent, "to me are ab&s;olute commands. Little preparation," added he, "will be nece&s;&s;ary for my journey: I will therefore take my departure in the morning."</P>
<P>"In the morning, Sir?" with eagerne&s;s, a&s;ked Laura.</P>
<P>"No, Vincent!" &s;aid Mr. Plomer; "important as the bu&s;ine&s;s is, it requires not the di&s;patch you propo&s;e. A few days will be nece&s;&s;ary to take leave of your friends, who&s;e partiality and e&s;teem a&s;k a more liberal return than the time you have fixed will enable you to pay."</P>
<P>Vincent bowed a&s;&s;ent; and, after a &s;hort conver&s;ation, but ill &s;upported on the part of the young people, Laura ro&s;e to take her leave. Vincent &s;olicited permi&s;&s;ion to at|tend her home; and the plea&s;ure which Laura experienced in his company, would not permit her to decline his po|litene&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;uperior merits of Vincent&mdash;ab&s;tracted from his per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, which, though not &s;trictly me|riting the proud di&s;tinction of beauty, were particularly &s;triking and engaging&mdash;had long attracted the attention of Mi&s;s Hartley; and if, on a &s;trict examination of her heart,
<PB N="274" REF="031725_0273_0FEE20EFA8EB9DD0">
&s;he could acquit it of the charge of love, &s;he certainly che|ri&s;hed a regard for him, not very much differing in nature from that tender pa&s;&s;ion. It is true, that &s;he had, with be|coming prudence, re&s;i&s;ted the advances of the &s;miling deity, and in a great mea&s;ure &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the wi&s;hes of her heart, aware that many ob&s;tacles would occur to prevent her union with the &s;on of a poor and humble curate.</P>
<P>Mr. Hartley, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many excellent qualities, was a man of no little pride; and thought too much of his family de&s;cent, which boa&s;ted &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characters in the annals of hi&s;tory, either as &s;tate&s;men, warriors, or eminent divines, to be ea&s;ily prevailed on to be&s;tow his daughter on one who&s;e only boa&s;t was intrin&s;ic merit. A poor and boot|le&s;s recommendation in the pre&s;ent age of refined &s;enti|ment!</P>
<P>But to return to our lovers&mdash;for &s;uch, from this mo|ment, the reader may con&s;ider them&mdash;&s;lowly pacing a grove of firs, through which their road to the hamlet lay; where we &s;hall find them lo&s;t in deep reflection, and pro|found &s;ilence, &s;ave when the half-&s;mothered &s;igh from either brea&s;t forced its painful pa&s;&s;age. At length, the trembling youth, &s;ummoning all his courage, ventured to addre&s;s the thoughtful maid&mdash;</P>
<P>"A few &s;hort hours," &s;aid he, in a melancholy tone of voice, "and I &s;hall no more enjoy the conver&s;e of each &s;ocial friend; nor&mdash;what is bli&s;s &s;till greater far than the&s;e&mdash;with Laura &s;tray through fields, where Summer &s;preads her lovely blo&s;&s;oms to the wondering eye, and blu&s;hing Flora exhales her balmy-&s;weets. Yet &s;hall re|membrance often dwell, enraptured, on each bli&s;s which, in the&s;e &s;ecluded &s;hades, my bo&s;om knew; and fancy, from the wreck of time, revive each plea&s;ing &s;cene.

<P>"And am I, Vincent, &s;o dear to you? Will you, in ab&s;ence, hold me in your thoughts?" inquired the blu&s;h|ing maid.</P>
<P>"Come along, Jack!" &s;aid a rough voice, behind him. "This is <HI>&s;he</HI> we are looking for."</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="031725_0274_0FEE20F13036AAA8">The a&s;toni&s;hed lovers turned, to learn from whence the threatening &s;ounds proceeded: and behold two men, with crapes over their faces, advancing towards them.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the ruffians had reached the a&s;toni&s;hed pair, one of them &s;eized Vincent by the arm; and, pointing a pi&s;tol to his brea&s;t, menaced him with in&s;tant death, if he dared to &s;tir or &s;peak. His companion, in the mean time, laid hold of Laura; who, &s;inking from his gra&s;p, fell lifele&s;s to the ground. The &s;ight of the maid, whom he tenderly loved, in this perilous &s;ituation, rouzed the in|dignant &s;pirit of the a&s;toni&s;hed Vincent; and, &s;natching the pi&s;tol which the villain pointed at his brea&s;t, he lodged its contents in his body, and brought him to the ground. His companion, &s;eeing him fall, hurried from this &s;cene of death; fir&s;t di&s;charging his pi&s;tol at Vincent, who unfor|tunately received the ball in his left &s;houlder.</P>
<P>Vincent's whole attention was now directed to the faint|ing Laura, who &s;oon revived from this tran&s;itory &s;tate of death; and the fir&s;t object that met her returning &s;en&s;es was her gallant lover.</P>
<P>"Ha&s;ten with me, my dear Laura," &s;aid he, "from this &s;cene of horror! Let us &s;eek your father's man&s;ion, where only we &s;hall be &s;afe; for &s;till I fear danger &s;urrounds us. This weapon," continued he, &s;natching a &s;word from the fallen villain's &s;ide, who lay weltering in his blood, and heaving deadly groans, "will be our &s;ure defence, &s;hould the mon&s;ter who has e&s;caped, return to execute his horrid purpo&s;e."</P>
<P>Without waiting her reply, he rai&s;ed the trembling beauty from the ground, and hurried her out of the grove. Fear lent them &s;trength, and added &s;wiftne&s;s to their &s;teps. Ju&s;t as they had reached the lawn that fronted the hou&s;e of Mr. Hartley, the wounded lover found his &s;trength exhau&s;ted; and, leaning on his &s;word, &s;aid&mdash;"I can no farther, Laura! Here mu&s;t I lay me down, till my wa&s;ted &s;trength returns. A few &s;hort paces, and you will reach a place where danger has no dwelling. Fly, then!" ad|ded he, throwing him&s;elf on the ground; "and, ere too late, &s;end me &s;ome friendly help."</P>
<P>The perturbed &s;tate of Laura's mind from the rude
<PB N="276" REF="031725_0275_0FEE20F2B6BBA478">
treatment of the ruffians, had prevented her from di&s;cover|ing the &s;ituation of her deliverer; and, till this moment, &s;he was a &s;tranger to his being wounded. Swift as the winged arrow &s;peeds its rapid flight, the lovely mourner bounded over the lawn; and, meeting her father at the entrance of the hou&s;e&mdash;who, beholding from a window her unu&s;ual ha&s;te, came to inquire the cau&s;e&mdash;ru&s;hed into his arms; and, with wildne&s;s in her looks, and a trembling voice, informed him of Vincent's &s;ituation, and urged him to ha&s;ten to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mr. Hartley called his &s;ervants, and proceeded to the bottom of the lawn; where they found the brave youth &s;o faint, through lo&s;s of blood, as to be totally incapable of &s;peaking. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his attendants, Mr. Hartley conveyed him to his hou&s;e; and, having laid him on a bed, di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger for the &s;urgeon of the village. Every po&s;&s;ible care was taken of the unfortunate youth. The ball was extracted without much difficulty; and his &s;urrounding friends had the happine&s;s to hear the &s;urgeon pronounce his wound remote from danger.</P>
<P>And now Mr. Hartley, having received the particulars of the accident which occa&s;ioned the wound of his young friend, &s;ent a &s;ervant to the par&s;onage, de&s;iring the pre|&s;ence of Mr. Plomer; while him&s;elf, attended by the &s;ur|geon and a &s;ervant, directed his &s;teps to the fatal &s;pot, to learn from the fallen ruffian, if yet alive, the cau&s;e of the outrage committed again&s;t his daughter, and by whom he was engaged; for he &s;u&s;pected that he had been hired to effect the diabolical purpo&s;e of &s;ome unknown villain.</P>
<P>They found the poor wretch in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility; and, having conveyed him to a neighbouring cottage, ad|mini&s;tered &s;ome cordials to his relief. After a length of time, he &s;eemed to revive; but all he could articulate was, "Sir William!" and &s;hortly after expired.</P>
<P>The&s;e words, however, afforded &s;ufficient information for Mr. Hartley to conclude that they had been hired by Sir William Ayliffe, to &s;ecure the per&s;on of his daughter, that by one efficient &s;troke of villany he might revenge the di&s;appointment he had received from Laura's rejection of his hand: and this conclu&s;ion &s;eemed to be ju&s;tified by Sir
<PB N="277" REF="031725_0276_0FEE20F44292A930">
William's &s;udden flight from this part of the country; which could only be attributed to the failure of his pro|jected &s;cheme, and the fear of exemplary puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>For &s;everal weeks Vincent was clo&s;ely confined to his bed; and his friends experienced much anxiety at his &s;ituation. A variety of pa&s;&s;ions agitated his mind, and retarded the progre&s;s of his recovery. The fair Laura, too, &s;uffered much from the &s;tate of uncertainty in which &s;he was involved. The ro&s;es in her cheek each day di&s;|clo&s;ed a fainter blu&s;h: her &s;pirits for&s;ook her; and her anxious parents frequently di&s;covered her in tears. Mr. Hartley readily divined the cau&s;e of her unea&s;ine&s;s, and charged her with the partiality &s;he bore the humble Vin|cent. She &s;ought not to elude the que&s;tion, but frankly owned her love.</P>
<P>"I confe&s;s," &s;aid Mr. Hartley, "I did expect you would have &s;elected a man of equal birth and fortune with your&s;elf, to a&s;&s;ociate with in the marriage &s;tate. One of greater merit, I am per&s;uaded, you could not have cho&s;en than our young friend; and I cannot but think he well de|&s;erves your love. I have ob&s;erved," continued he, "that an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion on his part is the chief, and, perhaps, only ob&s;tacle to his recovery; and that a &s;imilar attach|ment on that of yours is the &s;ource of your pre&s;ent un|ea&s;ine&s;s and declining health. It would, indeed, be the very height of ingratitude in us, Laura, not to e&s;teem that valour, but for which you might at this moment have been deprived of life, and I in fruitle&s;s grief mourned your lo&s;s. Go, then, my child," added he, "the glad&s;ome me&s;&s;en|ger of joy; remove from his mind the clouds of uncer|tainty; and tell him you are his forever.</P>
<P>Laura in&s;tantly threw her&s;elf on her knees; and, &s;natch|ing her father's hand, carried it to her lips&mdash;"And will you, will you, my dear father, make the generous Vincent happy? Will you ea&s;e the fears that rack his tortured mind? Oh, matchle&s;s conde&s;cen&s;ion! How &s;hall I repay &s;uch unbounded goodne&s;s!"</P>
<P>"Ri&s;e, my dear Laura," &s;aid Mr. Hartley, wiping from his eye the &s;tarting tear of paternal love: "your happine&s;s is mine; and whatever gives joy to you, is to me an equal ble&s;&s;ing."</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="031725_0277_0FEE20F972ACB7A0">The grateful Laura impatiently &s;ought the chamber of her de&s;ponding lover; and removed from his mind each fearful doubt, each lingering trace of wretchedne&s;s.</P>

<P>The grateful pa&s;tor received the intelligence of Mr. Hartley's con&s;ent to the union of his &s;on with the wealthy Laura, with tears of joy. To &s;ee his only child advanced to wealth and honour, rai&s;ed from the painful &s;tate of low dependence, to ea&s;e and affluence, blotted from his memory his former &s;ufferings; relieved him from the tender fears he entertained for his fate; and warmed his &s;oul with grat|itude to the beneficent Ruler of the world.

<P>"DOMESTIC life, like all other external goods, is not nece&s;&s;arily and of it&s;elf, but only in particular combinations and certain circum&s;tances, a real advantage and a &s;ource of actual felicity. Home is but too frequently rendered the &s;eat of tire&s;omene&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t; the &s;cene of low and ungoverned pa&s;&s;ions; the abode of vexation, of various di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and of malicious petulance; not &s;eldom an actual place of torment. This is always more or le&s;s the ca&s;e, where wi&s;dom and virtue are not admitted of the party, and do not animate its bu&s;ine&s;&s;es and plea&s;|ures. Where wi&s;dom and virtue dwell, where intelligent and good per&s;ons live together, there only dwell peace, &s;atisfaction, and joy: the&s;e alone render either a cottage or a palace the receptacle of plea&s;ure; by their means is any family, whether great or &s;mall, rendered capable of happi|ne&s;s. For only the intelligent and good can tell, what &s;olid happine&s;s implies; none but they have either the ta&s;te or &s;entiment proper for it. They alone e&s;timate things by their real value, and know how to enjoy, above all things, what is real, and beautiful, and good; un|e&s;teemed

and unknown as they may be in the great world, and among &s;uch as are not di&s;po&s;ed to the more delicate &s;en&s;ations. To them, a word that overflows from the ful|ne&s;s of the heart; a look that indicates the &s;oul; an incon&s;iderable but harmle&s;s action; an unimportant kind|ne&s;s, but performed from real affection; a calm and &s;ilent &s;entiment of friend&s;hip; a free effu&s;ion of a per&s;on's re|flections and feelings into the bo&s;om of his own family; is of more worth, than the reiterated prote&s;tations of civ|ility and regard, than all the flattering encomiums and blandi&s;hments, than all the friendly miens and ge&s;tures, than all the &s;plendid entertainments, in which the glory and happine&s;s of the generality of large companies con|&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>"Wherever dome&s;tic happine&s;s is found, it &s;hews us per|&s;ons who are connected together by real, intrin&s;ic love and friend&s;hip, who live entirely by each other, and who &s;eek their happine&s;s, their honour, and their force, in the mutual union of their hearts. Only to per&s;ons of this de&s;cription can and mu&s;t every thing be of importance which each has, &s;ays, does, and enjoys; how he is inclined; and whatever befals him. They alone know how to con&s;ider their mutual advantages with unerring complacency, and ob&s;erve the infirmities and failings of each other without di&s;plea&s;ure; to reprehend the deviations of a third with inoffen&s;ive gentlene&s;s; under&s;tand the looks of each; and to prevent the wants and wi&s;hes of all; mutually to com|ply with the de&s;igns of each other; to harmonize with the feelings of the re&s;t; and to rejoice heartily in all the &s;ucce&s;&s;es, even the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable, that happen to each other. Wherever frigidity of temper, untractablene&s;s, jealou&s;y, and envy prevail, there no real happine&s;s is po&s;&s;i|ble, in the narrow circle of daily intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>"Dome&s;tic happine&s;s gives &s;cope to a ta&s;te for truth, for nature, for a noble &s;implicity, and &s;erene repo&s;e; in oppo|&s;ition to error and art, to &s;tudied and forced plea&s;ures, and the more o&s;tentatious and poignant diver&s;ions. That pure and generous ta&s;te alone can give any value to the joys of do|me&s;tic life; and, to &s;uch as under&s;tand and enjoy it, render all its concerns important, and delightful as the &s;ources of &s;atisfaction and plea&s;ure. For, in this ca&s;e, they ari&s;e, not &s;o

much from the object, as from the eye that beholds them, and the heart that feels them; not &s;o much from the im|portance of the tran&s;actions and events them&s;elves, as from the natural and &s;pontaneous manner in which they ari&s;e, and the plea&s;ing intere&s;t taken in them. To per&s;ons of a &s;ound judgment and an uncorrupted heart, the cheerful countenance of the &s;pou&s;e, the li&s;ping of the infants, the mirthful &s;ports of the children, the &s;ight of rea&s;on in its bud and in its blo&s;&s;om; to them the earne&s;t curio&s;ity of one, the innocent vivacity of another, the growth and improve|ment of a third, the contentedne&s;s of all, is a &s;cene far pref|erable, with all its privacy and &s;implicity, to any other, however intricately conducted, or &s;plendidly performed. The &s;ilent and placid exi&s;tence, in a &s;ociety of open affec|tion, of unre&s;trained and unobtru&s;ive benevolence and love, is, to hearts that are able to melt, a kind of exi&s;tence which they would not exchange, for any of tho&s;e that are &s;o much prized and envied by the multitude.</P>
<P>"What a happine&s;s flows to &s;uch, more particularly, from the &s;uperintendence of their tender offspring! The Deity hath provided, that when the fir&s;t enchanting links of mutual affection and parental love have united us, we &s;hould be more endeared to each other, by every in&s;tance of care and affection in the education of our children. Nothing &s;o effectually charms the mind into a &s;ettled e&s;teem, as concurrence in an employment, &s;o beneficent, &s;o delightful, as the care or education of our own offspring. This is a work of &s;o much importance, and requiring &s;o much time, that it contributes more than any thing to|wards perpetuating our union. The nece&s;&s;ary duties to one child, are &s;ucceeded by the nece&s;&s;ary duties to another; until we have transferred, as it were, our whole &s;ouls into our offspring; pa&s;&s;ionately love each other again in our &s;everal images or repre&s;entatives; and live only to make our&s;elves happy, through the happine&s;s of our chil|dren. It is thus we may be &s;aid to be renewed; or to be made young again. We view the progre&s;s of an infant mind, the &s;ources and growth of its affections, with more plea&s;ure than is experie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed by it&s;elf.

of life; we forget our infirmities, we imagine our&s;elves in love again, becau&s;e our children are enamoured; and we become fathers and mothers a &s;econd time, when they a&s;&s;ume tho&s;e happy denominations. Compare, if you can, the events of what is called a life of plea&s;ure, with &s;uch as the&s;e.

<P>Apprehending an intimate connexion, between the vari|ous views of conjugal and dome&s;tic life depicted in the&s;e pages, and the happine&s;s of MILLIONS, of the <HI>ri&s;ing</HI> and <HI>ri&s;en</HI> generations of COLUMBIA; I have complied, not without he&s;itancy, with the call of my friends, to attempt the offi|cial duties of a MATRIMONIAL SPECTATOR and PRE|CEPTOR, for the benefit of our COMMON DEAR COUNTRY. To the patronage or cen&s;ure of that COUNTRY the work is now &s;ubmitted; with a &s;incere de&s;ire, that it may ri&s;e to fame, or &s;ink to ob&s;curity, as her impartial voice &s;hall determine.</P>
<P>With an ardent wi&s;h for the intellectual improvement, and happy union of the two &s;exes; I retire (as I have entered) <HI>incognito,</HI> from the &s;cene.</P>
<P>I know not how to clo&s;e this Work, and to take leave of my candid readers, or (&s;hall I &s;ay?) pupils, better, than by pre&s;enting them with the &s;entiments of a gentle|man of di&s;tingui&s;hed mental worth; who has long been one of the BRIGHTEST PATTERNS OF CONJUGAL VIR|TUE, in our NEW WORLD. They exhibit the grand ba&s;is of a happy union; and a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the advantages and di&s;advantages of the married &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING lived long; travelled much; &s;een matri|mony in all its forms, and &s;tages; ob&s;ervation and expe|rience have &s;tamped this truth with infallible certainty:&mdash; A CONSTANT DESIRE TO MAKE OUR COMPANION HAPPY, IS THE SOUL OF CONJUGAL FELICITY. This comprehends the e&s;&s;ence of love, and applies to all ages, all times, all circum&s;tances; it is every thing. This con|&s;titutes the balm, the flowers, all the &s;weets, and the &s;un|&s;hine of life. Where this is wanting, there is form with|out &s;pirit, &s;hadow without &s;ub&s;tance, "&s;ounding bra&s;s, and tinkling cymbal."</P>
<P>If we blot ten thou&s;and pages in giving rules and max|ims, and rea&s;oning about it and about it, the quinte&s;&s;ence of all is expre&s;&s;ed in one line. This truth is confirmed by the adage, "Love begets love;" which is founded in the experience of ages, and &s;anctioned by the rea&s;on of all mankind.</P>
<P>Human nature is formed to feel, and to be influenced by its &s;en&s;ations. The mo&s;t perver&s;e are affected, in &s;ome degree, by the kind attentions of others. In this way only can the meek and innocent wife control the ferocious hu&s;band, or reduce him to the path of virtue. Thus on|ly can the unprotected dome&s;tic reform or mollify the un|ruly pa&s;&s;ions of a tyrannical &s;uperior. Love, benevolence is the <HI>divine</HI> in&s;trument, by which the weak mu&s;t govern the &s;trong, the virtuous the wicked. Its charms influence all minds; and the per&s;on, whom it does not &s;often or reclaim, is lo&s;t forever. In any event, the good &s;hall not lo&s;e their reward: the con&s;cious endeavour to make others wi&s;e, virtuous, and happy, will in&s;til its balm into the benevolent mind, and repay its labour by the &s;ecret charm of &s;elf-approbation. Such is the con&s;titution of the hu|man mind, by the beneficent appointment of HEAVEN.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the <HI>advantages,</HI> and <HI>di&s;advantages</HI> of the married &s;tate, they merit our deliberate attention, ere we enter into it, to know where the balance will fall.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="031725_0283_0FEE210F89E1EC28">There is a dark, and a bright &s;ide; or, in other words, &s;ome portion of &s;hade to every thing in human life. That which is mo&s;t luminous on the whole, claims our choice. In order to form a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the means of happine&s;s, we mu&s;t &s;tudy the con&s;titution of nature, and of man; for no plan will &s;ucceed, which is oppo&s;ed by t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> con&s;titution. Taking this for the fir&s;t principle, then ob&s;erve the &s;ub&s;e|quent <HI>diamond</HI> maxim, which is more precious than rubies.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Let the be&s;t cour&s;e of life your choice invite,</L>
<L>"And cu&s;tom &s;oon will turn it to delight."</L>
</LG>
<P>What &s;ome call the dark &s;ide, or tax of matrimony, is, <HI>the cares, and expen&s;es of a family&mdash;multiplying one's &s;elf into many marks for misfortune, &s;ickne&s;s, and death&mdash;lo&s;s of liberty, by increa&s;ing one's ties&mdash;hazard of ill-temper, or want of excel|lence in the per&s;on with whom we form the indi&s;&s;oluble union; and the like ri&s;k in offspring.</HI> All the&s;e certainly have their weight in the &s;cale: therefore, to act rationally, they mu&s;t be outweighed by pro&s;pects of happine&s;s, before we make the experiment of the conjugal life.</P>
<P>As to <HI>cares</HI> and <HI>expen&s;es,</HI> they increa&s;e the exertion of our faculties, and thus more often enlarge, than dimini&s;h our plea&s;ure. We were made for action, not for indolence; and from pur&s;uits, which have for their object the intere&s;t of tho&s;e we love, the mo&s;t refined enjoyment re&s;ults. This con&s;titutes a &s;ublime portion of human felicity, without which life would be a barren exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The &s;econd objection is un&s;upported by rea&s;on and ex|perience; becau&s;e without &s;uch a multiplication of friends, we cannot increa&s;e our deare&s;t delights. No one objects to riches, becau&s;e they add to his cares, and his chances for lo&s;s. The ab&s;ence of evil will not &s;atisfy any one: all want po&s;itive good; and for the enjoyment of it, we cheerfully take the ri&s;k of lo&s;ing it.</P>
<P>As to <HI>lo&s;s of liberty by increa&s;ing one's ties;</HI> we always in|tend, and very frequently gain by the lo&s;s. It is only an exchange, as in a pure republic; we give part of our rights to the control of others, for the &s;ame power over their rights. We cannot exi&s;t in &s;ociety without an exchange
<PB N="285" REF="031725_0284_0FEE21111148DDA0">
of rights in &s;ome degree: it is a mean of promoting indi|vidual and general happine&s;s.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fourth objection, it is to be re|membered, that we cannot take one &s;tep in life, which promi&s;es good, free from the po&s;&s;ibility of evil. If the chances be in favour of a pur&s;uit, it is deemed wi&s;e. In this, as in every other ca&s;e, we rea&s;on, and follow where happine&s;s &s;eems to lie. When per&s;ons arrive at the period of life for important action, and look around the world for happine&s;s; hazard and uncertainty attend every object, and darkne&s;s re&s;ts on all things future. Their nature power|fully inclines them to pur&s;uit. Taking, then, rea&s;on and vir|tue for their guides, they &s;hould &s;elect tho&s;e objects, which afford the faire&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s. Hope, the cor|dial of exi&s;tence, animates the various pur&s;uits through the whole journey of life, and often &s;trews with flowers the untrodden path. Marriage enlarges the field of hope; it &s;eems to in&s;ure a kind of immortality. In offspring our morning-&s;tar ari&s;es, before our evening &s;un declines. This prevents a total eclip&s;e, and enlightens our whole exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>In fact, all the wants and wi&s;hes, the pa&s;&s;ions and &s;en|&s;ibilities of humanity, which con&s;titute delight, find their object in the matrimonial circle.</P>
<P>When too we contemplate the brevity of life, and look forwards to that world, whence no traveller returns; we may anticipate the enlargement, even of eternal felicity, in &s;eeing our po&s;terity from age to age a&s;cend, to people the realms of light, and embrace us with &s;eraphic love. This idea is natural, and there is nothing in rea&s;on or rev|elation again&s;t the plea&s;ing conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>TO IMITATE THE PARENT OF THE UNIVERSE, BY COMMUNICATING FELICITY, GIVES BACK THE MOST DIVINE PLEASURE, WHICH THE HUMAN MIND CAN FEEL; AND TO COMMUNICATE TO THOSE WE LOVE, IS THE SUBLIME OF EXISTENCE. The mind ri&s;es in bli&s;s, whil&s;t it dwells on the idea. The heart palpitates in an energy of rapture.</P>
<P>Happy Americans! who&s;e free government, and fertile regions invite to Marriage, and promi&s;e the full reward of love. Here the corrupt maxims of the old world are lit|tle
<PB N="286" REF="031725_0285_0FEE211478AD5E70">
known. Here Love is the loan for love; and the pure principle of per&s;onal e&s;teem forms the union between the &s;exes. Here mutual affection ri&s;es &s;uperior to fortune, and gives dome&s;tic felicity, unknown where avarice, am|bition, or vicious plea&s;ure rule the heart.</P>
<P>Here Indu&s;try, crowned by the ble&s;&s;ing of benignant Heaven, &s;upplies the wants of all; and the blooming youth are &s;een in every dwelling, &s;miling around their parents, like blo&s;&s;oms on a fruitful tree. Health glows on the cheek, innocence and contentment &s;parkle in the eye, and the voice of Nature tells the traveller, "HAPPINESS DWELLS HERE."</P>
