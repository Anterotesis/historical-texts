<Q>SURELY THE WRATH OF MAN SHALL PRAISE THEE: THE REMAINDER OF WRATH SHALT THOU RESTRAIN.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN all the events of the world, the wi&s;e and good direction of God is to be acknowledg|ed and adored. The voice of rea&s;on accords with the voice of revelation, in proclaiming him the di&s;po&s;er and governor, as well as the contriv|er and former, of the &s;y&s;tem which we behold. The &s;tupendous and minute, the beneficial and de&s;tructive operations and effects of natural ob|jects, call our reverent attention to him, as their great fir&s;t cau&s;e. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and intere&s;ting changes of the moral and religious, the political and &s;ocial a&s;pect of mankind, refer us to him, as their almighty and all-wi&s;e &s;uperintendent. In
<PB N="6" REF="028932_0004_0FDD70336C5B9F10">
&s;urveying the&s;e occurrences, we ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s a firm conviction, that God has not for&s;aken any part of his world, nor left to chance the condi|tion of any one of his creatures; that he pre&s;ides, in every place and period, to guide by his wi&s;|dom, ble&s;s by his goodne&s;s, enliven by his ener|gy, and control by his power. In all our re|flections on this admini&s;tration of the univer&s;e, we ought to entertain a full per&s;ua&s;ion, that he permits nothing unfit to be permitted, and effects nothing unfit to be effected; that he connects and regulates events, apparently mo&s;t di&s;connec|ted and irregular; and &s;o over-rules and di&s;po&s;es them, that confu&s;ion i&s;&s;ues in order, tumult in tranquillity, and &s;uffering in enjoyment. By &s;uch a perpetual and devout acknowledgment of the Supreme Being in all that takes place, we &s;how a becoming &s;en&s;e of his authority, and learn his nature and perfections, the rules of his gov|ernment, and the duty and intere&s;t of his ration|al offspring. Our hearts are impre&s;&s;ed with rev|erence and humility, and expanded with admira|tion and joy. The murmurs of di&s;content are hu&s;hed; the alarms of fear are quieted; the gloom, which often gathers over this di&s;ordered &s;tate, is di&s;per&s;ed; and lu&s;tre is &s;hed upon the face of the world.</P>
<P>In contemplating the wicked pa&s;&s;ions and con|duct of mankind, we derive con&s;olation and im|provement
<PB N="7" REF="028932_0005_0FDD7034EE3481A8">
from the doctrine of a wi&s;e and be|nevolent Providence. When we &s;ee that their heart is &s;et in them to do evil, and the work of violence is in their hand, a dark veil is drawn over the divine proceedings, and men &s;eem to ex|i&s;t, that they may deform the world, and afflict each other. But the&s;e gloomy appearances van|i&s;h, and light breaks forth, when the declaration of the &s;acred volume is fully con&s;idered and be|lieved: SURELY THE WRATH OF MAN SHALL PRAISE GOD: THE REMAINDER OF WRATH SHALL HE RESTRAIN. The pride and &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s of men are &s;ubject to his control and direc|tion, and converted to purpo&s;es of benevolence and wi&s;dom. Their di&s;regard and contempt of his perfections, laws, and government, and their hatred, oppre&s;&s;ion, and abu&s;e of one another, ever have been, are, and will be &s;uperintended by Al|mighty God, rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to his glory and the general good, and limited, in their de|gree and extent, according to his appointment.</P>
<P>This doctrine of an overruling Providence, a&s;&s;erted in the text, might be particularly appli|ed to all the moral di&s;orders in human nature and human &s;ociety: but it will be more &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion to take a more confined range, and illu&s;trate it with re&s;pect to the di&s;po&s;ition to war ever found in mankind; its &s;ources, operation,
<PB N="8" REF="028932_0006_0FDD703963B3F808">
and effects. We &s;hudder with horror and &s;igh with grief, when we con&s;ider the &s;tate of ho&s;tili|ty, to which &s;ocieties have been incident from their formation; in con&s;equence of which the &s;word has been the mea&s;ure of ju&s;tice, and the weak have been the prey of the &s;trong; man, de&s;igned for a ble&s;&s;ing, has often proved a cur&s;e to man, and killing and de&s;troying been &s;tudied as indi&s;pen&s;able arts, and pur&s;ued as glorious em|ployments. But our feelings will not be de&s;titute of relief, nor our minds of in&s;truction, in the contemplation of this melancholy picture of hu|man depravity, folly, and mi&s;ery, if we have a &s;ettled belief in a pre&s;iding Deity, and &s;ee a ra|tional pro&s;pect of the gradual re&s;traint and ulti|mate termination of the violence of men.</P>
<P>In order to furni&s;h this relief and in&s;truction from the&s;e &s;ources, it will be attempted in the following part of this di&s;cour&s;e,</P>
<P>I. To &s;how in what re&s;pect war is an evil.</P>
<P>II. To prove, though it be in many re&s;pects an evil, yet that it is, under the conduct of di|vine Providence, in known and unknown ways, made productive of good.</P>
<P>III. To repre&s;ent, that as, by the influence of chri&s;tianity, of arts and civilization, the hor|rors of war have been mitigated; &s;o we have rea&s;on to believe, that, by the increa&s;e of this
<PB N="9" REF="028932_0007_0FDD703E01F55BA8">
influence, and the progre&s;s of knowledge and liberty, a period will be put to contentions by force, and the world be ble&s;&s;ed with univer&s;al and perpetual peace.</P>
<P>The&s;e topics being &s;lightly di&s;cu&s;sed, an ap|plication of the di&s;cour&s;e to the &s;tate of our country and the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, will be &s;ub|joined.</P>
<P>I. In what re&s;pects is war an evil?</P>
<P>War is an evil in re&s;pect to its cau&s;es, effects, and extent. What are its CAUSES, but odious and di&s;graceful pa&s;&s;ions; ungoverned ambition, avarice, pride and revenge? In &s;elf-defence do a people often arm, commence and pro&s;ecute war: their motive is ju&s;t&punc; and their conduct prai&s;e-worthy. But as the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-de|fence is created by the intended or actual inva|&s;ion of their rights; the inordinate pa&s;&s;ions, the unju&s;t claims, the violent proceedings of the in|vader, are &s;trictly the cau&s;e of every &s;uch war; and in no ca&s;e, except in that of involuntary mi&s;|take, which is rare, could there be a re&s;ort to arms by two powers, were not one di&s;po&s;ed to injure the other, and compa&s;s an end by the vi|olation of his rights. To extend territory and commerce, and increa&s;e power; to keep what they have no right to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and gain what they have no right to pur&s;ue; to gratify re&s;entment, build up a faction, or e&s;tabli&s;h the tyrannical
<PB N="10" REF="028932_0008_0FDD703ED90E2B58">
claims of family connexions; to feed a pa&s;&s;ion for ideal glory, or vent a turbulent and re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit; are aggre&s;&s;ors in wars prompted to &s;acri|fice the lives, and lay wa&s;te the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of them&s;elves and their adver&s;aries. Actuated by the&s;e unju&s;tifiable and unworthy views, do &s;ov|ereigns and nations begin or compel tho&s;e, whom they in&s;ult and oppre&s;s, to begin conte&s;ts, which, maintained with blood and rapine, give a horrid and mournful a&s;pect to human affairs. Since per&s;ecutions on account of religion have been of|ten carried on with &s;hocking cruelty and im|men&s;e de&s;truction, it may be thought by &s;ome that religion &s;hould be mentioned among the cau&s;es of war. But little attention is requi&s;ite, to convince a candid mind, that it has not much conduced to this calamity; for there have been few <HI>con&s;cientious</HI> per&s;ecutors;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paley's Evidences, Part iii. ch. vii.</NOTE> the greate&s;t num|ber have acted from the lu&s;t of gain and domin|ion, like tyrants and conquerors in general. The wars called religious have been commonly politi|cal, and a de&s;ire of gaining and keeping influence, not of promoting piety, has originated and main|tained them.</P>
<P>What mingled grief and indignation are exci|ted in our bo&s;oms by the con&s;ideration of the&s;e cau&s;es of war? Mo&s;t of them pa&s;&s;ions, which di&s;grace our nature, de&s;troy our tranquility, and
<PB N="11" REF="028932_0009_0FDD7044B22F5210">
ally us to brutal and infernal beings; all of them, how in&s;ufficient, alas! to ju&s;tify the production of &s;uch complicated and exten&s;ive mi&s;ery! Ye princes and &s;tate&s;men! who, appointed by Pro|vidence the protectors, become the de&s;troyers of mankind, who wade to empire through blood, and water your conque&s;ts with the tears of mil|lions: ye popular leaders! who employ your art and eloquence, to deceive and inflame the multitude; and to compa&s;s your views of faction or ambition, plunge your country into unnece&s;&s;ary and de&s;olating war; pau&s;e in your mad ca|reer, con&s;ider the enormity of your conduct, and know, that if &s;ecure from the avenging arm of man, ye cannot e&s;cape the tribunal of Eternal Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>To e&s;timate its evil, from the CAUSES, we proceed to the EFFECTS of war. Lives de&s;troy|ed, which are the flower and &s;trength of a nation, and the &s;oul of indu&s;try; cities, the &s;eats of op|ulence and &s;plendor, laid in ruins; fertile and plea&s;ant fields changed to dreary tracts of de&s;o|lation; inhabitants diverted from their u&s;eful employments; the channels of commerce ob|&s;tructed or &s;topped; the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence rendered difficult or impo&s;&s;ible to be obtained; enormous public exactions; and dimini&s;hed or exhau&s;ted re&s;ources; form one a&s;&s;emblage of its calamities. See it next mingle bitterne&s;s in the
<PB N="12" REF="028932_0010_0FDD704590DDDF00">
cup of dome&s;tic joy; &s;ow hatred and di&s;&s;en&s;ion in the bo&s;om of families; di&s;&s;olve the ties, and wound the &s;en&s;ibilities of nature; rob the aged parent of his &s;olace, the affectionate wife of her companion, the helple&s;s child of its &s;upporter. But its civil and dome&s;tic are outweighed by its moral evils. By the collection of men into ar|mies, and the nature of military life, they are rendered di&s;&s;olute in principles and manners. By the interruption of legal proceedings, ini|quity, being &s;ecure from detection and puni&s;h|ment, abounds; and by the fluctuation of pro|perty, and the violation of public and private contracts attendant on war, the &s;entiments and habits of ju&s;tice are un&s;ettled. The perpetual exerci&s;e of the ho&s;tile pa&s;&s;ions, creates a temper of hatred and revenge; and familiarity with &s;cenes of blood, imparts a ferocious and cruel ca&s;t to the character. La&s;tly, in con&s;equence of this &s;tate of di&s;union and ho&s;tility in which na|tions exi&s;t, the rights of all, except the &s;tronge&s;t, are in&s;ecure; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are un&s;table, and inter|cour&s;e is damped by an ever wakeful jealou&s;y. Peace, not &s;uper&s;eding a con&s;tant readine&s;s for war, is &s;carce le&s;s expen&s;ive than war it&s;elf; the vindication of rights often cau&s;es more lo&s;s than their &s;urrender; entering into treaties is almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s, whil&s;t there is no &s;ecurity for their ob|&s;ervance; avoiding contentions of our own en|&s;ures
<PB N="13" REF="028932_0011_0FDD7046E0EEADE8">
not tranquillity, whil&s;t we are expo&s;ed to the frequent nece&s;&s;ity of taking part in the con|tentions of others. The energy of nations is expended in the defence, rather than the im|provement of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and the ble&s;&s;ings be&s;towed on them by God and nature are unu&s;ed or wa&s;ted.</P>
<P>The EXTENT of war is as great, as its CAUS|ES and EFFECTS are de&s;tructive. In what pe|riod has it not &s;ounded its alarms? In what re|gion has it not &s;pread its de&s;olations? From the fir&s;t age to the pre&s;ent, from the northern to the &s;outhern zone, from the rude pagan of America to the poli&s;hed chri&s;tian of Europe, the re&s;ort to force has prevailed. At this moment we behold the greate&s;t portion of the civilized world in ho&s;|tile commotion, and the ancient continent a field of battle.</P>
<P>Such is the picture of di&s;tre&s;s and ruin, which war in general pre&s;ents. Is the mind oppre&s;&s;ed with gloom and horror on beholding it? Let it be cheered and in&s;tructed by con&s;idering, what is the &s;econd topic of di&s;cour&s;e,</P>
<P>II. That though war be in many re&s;pects an evil, yet it is, under the conduct of divine Pro|vidence, in known and unknown ways, made productive of good.</P>
<P>God's &s;uperintendence over human affairs is declared in the &s;criptures in various and pointed
<PB N="13" REF="028932_0012_0FDD704E2C5AB0C8">
terms. "Of him, through him, and to him, are all things. Shall there be evil in the city and the Lord hath not done it? Who ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom &s;o|ever he will; putteth down one and &s;etteth up another; maketh peace and createth evil;" who &s;aith to the wrathful tyrant, "I will put my hook in thy no&s;e, and my bridle in thy lips; for this cau&s;e have I rai&s;ed thee up, to &s;how in thee my power." Let not out inability to compre|hend the manner, induce us to doubt the reality of this divine admini&s;tration. Who will pre|&s;ume to deny that the Almighty Lord of the univer&s;e is both able and di&s;po&s;ed to exerci&s;e it? He is able, becau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es univer&s;al knowl|edge, perfect wi&s;dom, and infinite power. En|dowed with the&s;e perfections, he may, by ori|ginally e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch laws in the natural and moral world, as would produce the preci&s;e ef|fects, and no other, which he choo&s;es to have occur, or by occa&s;ional interpo&s;itions, regulate all events. Is it objected that the freedom of the human will proves the events depending on that will incapable of regulation? We reply that this faculty is the gift of God, to whom, when he be&s;towed it, all its po&s;&s;ible operations were known; therefore it operates nothing which he did not determine to admit into his world. Be&s;ides, how entirely may be control its determinations,
<PB N="15" REF="028932_0013_0FDD704F2DFE8D28"> without de&s;troying its freedom. If a wi&s;e man, by addre&s;ing motives to the mind of a per&s;on, can in many in&s;tances preci&s;ely influence his con|duct, without infringing his agency; we mu&s;t a&s;cribe a &s;imilar power in far higher mea&s;ure to God, the being, who&s;e under&s;tanding is infinite, and who&s;e pre&s;ence is univer&s;al; who has acce&s;s to the mo&s;t delicate &s;prings and latent move|ments of our &s;ouls; and holds all nature in his hand, from a planet to an atom, from a &s;y&s;tem to a worm. To prove that he is di&s;po&s;ed, as well as able, to conduct the affairs of his world, if it be not irreverent to talk of proving &s;o bright a truth, we need only ob&s;erve, that God made the world for &s;ome end; and unle&s;s he control occurrences, this end may be fru&s;trated; and that he is good, delighting in the happine&s;s of his creatures; therefore does not re&s;ign them to chance, nor bind them in fate; but limits and guides actions and events, as the purpo&s;es of goodne&s;s dictate.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;ured, therefore, that the commencement, the continuance, and the termination of war, the mo&s;t unju&s;t and cruel, is in all ca&s;es under the conduct of divine Providence; we are al&s;o a&s;&s;ur|ed, that evil as it is, in unknown as well as known ways, it is made productive of good. By ab&s;tract rea&s;onings, on the character of God, by the prevailing tendency of his works, and by
<PB N="16" REF="028932_0014_0FDD70554739CEC8">
the di&s;coveries of revelation, we are compelled to believe that the Author of the univer&s;e is good, as well as powerful and wi&s;e. Therefore, &s;eeing he is a perfect being, a perfect &s;y&s;tem will be produced by him; and no events be directed or permitted to take place in it, which are not con&s;i&s;tent with the greate&s;t good of the whole. Though we di&s;cern not how natural and moral evil is rendered &s;ub|&s;ervient to good; yet we ought not to doubt it; nor deny that that is the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible &s;y&s;tems, in which much evil is mingled; whil&s;t we &s;ee it evidently an&s;wering important ends, e&s;&s;en|tial to a &s;tate of moral di&s;cipline, giving &s;cope to great and improving exertion, and often i&s;&s;uing in enjoyment. This rea&s;oning on evil in general, mu&s;t be applied to the evil of war in particular. When ready to inquire, why war has been &s;uf|fered to rage in every period, clime and nation, why the weak and inoffen&s;ive have been &s;ubject|ed to the inju&s;tice and violence of the powerful and ambitious, and have been forced to &s;eek ref|uge from the calamities of oppre&s;&s;ion in the ca|lamities of re&s;i&s;tance; let us reflect on that di|vine admini&s;tration, which in numberle&s;s undi&s;|cernible methods, brings order and happine&s;s out of this di&s;order and mi&s;ery; let us reflect on that human ignorance, which forbids cen&s;ure, complaint, or di&s;tru&s;t; and let our reliance on this almighty and benevolent &s;uperintendence be
<PB N="17" REF="028932_0015_0FDD7055B3E04DD0">
&s;trengthened by con&s;idering &s;ome in&s;tances, in which good is made to re&s;ult from war, howev|er unju&s;tifiable may be its authors, or de&s;tructive its general and direct effects.</P>
<P>In &s;acred hi&s;tory, we behold the violence and ho&s;tility of man, from the fir&s;t unnatural mur|der to the crucifixion of the Saviour in&s;tument|al of important purpo&s;es, by di&s;playing the di|vine perfections; by rewarding the good, pun|i&s;hing the bad and reclaiming the devious; by aiding and accompli&s;hing the di&s;pen&s;ations of heaven for the in&s;truction and &s;alvation of man|kind.</P>
<P>Viewing &s;ociety in the gla&s;s of general hi&s;tory, we find this de&s;troying &s;courge in &s;everal re|&s;pects a ble&s;&s;ing to man, as it relates to the im|provement of his character and condition, to lib|erty and &s;cience.</P>
<P>It rou&s;es men in the &s;avage &s;tate from their &s;tupidity. Their intellect buried under the gro&s;&s;|ne&s;s of appetite, and their powers exerted only at the calls of &s;en&s;e, they naturally &s;ink into brutal &s;elf-indulgence, and li&s;tle&s;s inaction. The de&s;ire of a better &s;tate, it is ob&s;erved, has le&s;s influence in exciting human efforts than the fear of a wor&s;e. Therefore, impending danger, aided by &s;trong de&s;ires of revenge and glory, kindles the ardor, and &s;timulates the activity of barbarians, when nothing el&s;e would do it. They

are thus pre&s;erved from the degradation of a mere animal life; their faculties are invigorated by exerci&s;e; for purpo&s;es of offence and defence they invent and employ arts, from which, ex|tended and advanced, peace derives its conven|ience, and life its mo&s;t valuable improvements.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prie&s;tley's lectures on hi&s;tory.</NOTE></P>
<P>War calls forth &s;ome of the noble&s;t and be&s;t energies of the &s;oul, for which the calm of peace does not afford &s;uch favorable opportunities. The magnanimity, which contemns difficulty, the courage which defies danger, the humanity which relents over a vanqui&s;hed foe, the ingenuity which devi&s;es and the vigor which executes, are brought into illu&s;trious di&s;play in military con|te&s;ts; and &s;pread a glory over the character of the warrior.</P>
<P>To the violent attempts of tyrants to retard and cru&s;h liberty, are we to a&s;cribe in &s;ome in|&s;tances its rapid progre&s;s and complete trtumph. The cruel oppre&s;&s;ion or wanton de&s;truction of one or more a&s;&s;erters of it has, by intere&s;ting pub|lic compa&s;&s;ion in their favor, increa&s;ed the ad|herents of their cau&s;e; and by rou&s;ing the gen|eral indignation, in&s;pirited the united re&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ufferers, and effected the &s;udden over|throw of u&s;urpation and de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>Truth, e&s;pecially religious truth, mu&s;t be ac|knowledged to have been in &s;ome mea&s;ure pro|moted

by the violence of its enemies. The un|relenting per&s;ecution of the fir&s;t teachers of chri&s;|tianity, by warming their zeal and animating their exertions; by putting it in their power to give convincing proof of their &s;incerity by extra|ordinary patience and re&s;olution; and by awaking &s;ympathy with them as injured per&s;ons, contri|buted indirectly to extend and e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;y&s;|tem.</P>
<P>What con&s;olation have we amid the horror and execration of war, and what gratitude and tru&s;t are due to the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er, when we con&s;ider &s;ome of the advantages flowing to &s;ci|ence and art from this unexpected &s;ource. Hi&s;|tory &s;hows that public commotions, by obliging men of learning to retreat from the &s;eat of war in|to quiet countries, have brought to them valua|ble acce&s;&s;ions of knowledge; that barbarous nations conquered by civilized, have received arts with ma&s;ters; that by conque&s;t a communica|tion has been opened between regions before &s;ep|arated from each other; and the empire of com|merce and refinement been greatly enlarged. But in another view it has been ob&s;erved to &s;erve the cau&s;e of human improvement. A military con|te&s;t, particularly of a free people in defence of freedom, creates a ferment of mind, &s;ets the facul|ties to work, expands the views, and invigorates the active principles. Hence in a time of public

To this &s;ource they are un|avoidably traced, becau&s;e they naturally flowed from it; they exi&s;ted with it; and they are not found, where it has not reached. This religion was not without its influence even on the barbar|ous invaders of the Roman empire, after their &s;ettlement in it. It laid &s;ome re&s;traint on the ferocity of private quarrels in the dark ages; and it mingled its gentlene&s;s and humanity, with barbarian fiercene&s;s and cruelty, in chivalry. So much re&s;pect to its principles do the pre&s;ent na|tions of Chri&s;tendom render, as to acknowledge the unlawfulne&s;s of offen&s;ive war, by prefacing their declarations of ho&s;tilities with arguments to &s;how, that they are not the aggre&s;&s;ors.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Winthrop's Sy&s;tematic Arrangement of Prophecies.</NOTE> In bat|tle all are commonly &s;pared who cea&s;e to re&s;i&s;t.

<P>The advancement of ARTS has concurred with the principles of our benign religion in le&s;&s;ening the evils of war, by opening another field for en|terpri&s;e than the performance of martial exploits, &s;oftening the character, and creating in men &s;uch an incapacity for war or aver&s;ion to it, that the number de&s;tined to arms in modern, bears no pro|portion to that of ancient times.</P>

By a compari&s;on of the pa&s;t with the pre&s;ent, it appears probable that human affairs are grad|dually advancing to perfection. Though they have &s;eemed to revolve, alternately a&s;cending to a certain point of elevation; and returning to a corre&s;pondent point of depre&s;&s;ion; and it may be &s;uppo&s;ed will continue revolving in this manner to the end of time; yet evident is it, that the ef|fect of every total revolution has been a better State than exi&s;ted before it; that the &s;econd point of elevation has been higher than the fir&s;t; the third, than the &s;econd. The Grecian glory was brighter than the Per&s;ian; the Roman, brighter than the Grecian; and the glory of this age exceeds that of the brighe&s;t preceding. In learning and arts, in government and religion, in per&s;onal liberty and &s;ecurity, in convenience and agreeablene&s;s of living, and in mildne&s;s and hu|manity of manners, in all that exalts and ble&s;&s;es &s;ociety, our &s;uperiority to the greate&s;t and happi|e&s;t nations of antiquity is &s;triking and inconte&s;t|able. None can deny the greater humanity di&s;|played in the conduct of modern wars. As wi&s;e and benevolent principles have prevailed to mi|tigate, why may they not further prevail to ter|minate our ho&s;tilities? As one &s;tep has been tak|en from the &s;tate of nature by the &s;ocial &s;tate of individuals, why may not another &s;tep be taken by the &s;ocial State of nations? It is agreed that

it would promote their true intere&s;t to &s;ub&s;titute arbitration for the appeal to arms, when di&s;putes are to be decided; to cultivate each his own ter|itory, maintain commerce free, and direct their energy to the arts of peace. It may be thought that they will not apprehend or pur&s;ue this in|tere&s;t hereafter, becau&s;e they have not apprehend|ed or pur&s;ued it heretofore. Why have they not always di&s;cerned and &s;ought it? Becau&s;e kings, and the minions of kings, the mo&s;t ignorant and profligate of their &s;pecies, have managed the con|concerns of civilized &s;tates, who, &s;trangers to the maxims of &s;ound policy and equity, influenced by contracted views, weak thir&s;t for dominion, or mi&s;taken honor, have refu&s;ed to concur in any pacific &s;y&s;tem; becau&s;e the people, &s;hrouded, in ignorance, and chained in &s;ervitude, have neither known nor a&s;&s;erted their rights, and could be controled by de&s;pots and deluded by de|magogues.</P>
<P>But a new era is commencing in human af|fairs, and new features are forming in the human character.

equal rights, and that government is formed &s;ole|ly to &s;ecure them. With this progre&s;s of KNOW|LEDGE will be joined the equal progre&s;s of her in&s;eparable companion, LIBERTY. It is e&s;tab|li&s;hed in our country, it is, we tru&s;t, beginning to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in more than one country in Europe. Whil&s;t the contention of the greate&s;t nation of the old world for this invaluable ble&s;|&s;ing is marked by all the atrocities and di&s;orders, which can be expect to en&s;ue, from the intoxi|cation of freedom, the removal of accu&s;tomed re&s;traints, and the re&s;entment and de&s;pair excit|ed by a wanton and combined inva&s;ion of the enemies of their cau&s;e among a numerous people, hardened by oppre&s;&s;ion, untaught in fir&s;t princi|ples, and deba&s;ed and corrupted by the foul vices of athei&s;m and &s;uper&s;tition; whil&s;t it is di&s;|graced by outrages, at which rea&s;on and religion weep, and humanity recoils, it is maintained with an undaunted re&s;olution, and a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s en|ergy, which encourage the hope of its happy i&s;&s;ue in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a free government. This &s;pirit will probably run on and kindle the flames of re&s;i&s;tance in every country en&s;laved, and and introduce a new order of things. If the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical oppre&s;&s;ors of the earth, alarm|ed at the &s;preading contagion, add double weight to the chains of their &s;ubjects, their intemperate tyranny will &s;erve only to force a quicker con|viction

The hope in&s;pired by the&s;e con&s;iderations is rai&s;ed to a&s;&s;urance by the evidence furni&s;hed by rea&s;on and the &s;acred predictions, that chri&s;tiani|ty will be finally embraced by all mankind. Tho&s;e who&s;e faith and expectation re&s;t on this &s;y&s;tem, as on the rock of ages, cannot be per|&s;uaded, triumphant as unbelief may be, that it will fail of its ju&s;t influence over mankind in due time.

By no means: for men have been hitherto from various cau&s;es more incapaci|tated and more indi&s;po&s;ed to receive it, than we tru&s;t they will be in future.

The&s;e point our enraptured view to a time, when "Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall have the heathen for his in|heritance and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

Among nations, warmed by that charity, which &s;eeketh not her own, and em|braces all men as brethren; and guided by that equity, which renders to all their dues; di&s;putes as injuries will be rare; and when they ari&s;e, will be peaceably adju&s;ted by acknowledged principles or a common tribunal. The efforts, now expended in the defence, will be employed in the improvement of countries; and the gifts of nature, now unu&s;ed or de&s;troyed, will be made to yield all their re&s;ources to public and private happine&s;s.
