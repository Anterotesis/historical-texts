<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>'TIS</HI> the duty of every one to do what he can, in a rational friendly manner, to promote the public good and prevent public calamity. For a man to withhold what he thinks would be of public utility, is either not to be friendly or not to be faithful. Where there are vices or prejudices and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, 'tis not likely that every truth can be properly exhibited, and urged, without offending &s;ome.</P>
<P>My aim in the following di&s;cour&s;e has been to &s;peak plainly, without fear, with|out partiality, without ill-will to any; with hearty benevolence to the public, not as plea&s;ing man, but God who tries the heart. If &s;ome things in the &s;ermon &s;hould offend a number, I &s;hall not be di&s;appointed, and if the publication &s;hall be u&s;eful to any, may God have the glory.</P>

<HEAD>A SERMON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE are called upon by our civil rulers to &s;et apart this day for fa&s;ting and prayer. We are called upon by tho&s;e who have the management or lead in our public affairs&mdash;who be&s;t know, and have the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive view of, things in the&s;e United States. We have rea&s;on to ble&s;s God that tho&s;e who go foremo&s;t in affairs of &s;tate will call upon us to apply to God, yea will lead us to the throne of grace for divine aid. The proclamation points out various particulars that we ought to bear in mind this day. I might take the &s;everal things in the proclamation as &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e; and I &s;hall pay a due regard to what is there &s;aid: but I &s;hall mention &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which I think we may properly have in view this day, and which if you plea&s;e you may con&s;ider as my text.</P>
<P>Jer. xxx. 11. <HI>Though I make a full end of all nations whither I have &s;cattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in mea&s;ure, and will not leave thee altogether unpuni&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>I&s;ai. lviii. 6. <HI>Is not this the fa&s;t that I have cho|&s;en; to loo&s;e the bands of wickedne&s;s, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free, and that ye break every yoke?</HI></P>
<P>Rom. ii. 1, 3. <HI>Thou art inexcu&s;able, O man, who|&s;oever thou art that judge&s;t: for wherein thou judge&s;t another thou condemne&s;t thy&s;elf; for thou that judge&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="016296_0004_0F9C1E71DC79A470">
do&s;t the &s;ame thing.&mdash;And thinke&s;t thou this, O man, that judge&s;t them that do &s;uch things, and do&s;t the &s;ame, that thou &s;halt e&s;cape the judgment of God?</HI></P>
<P>Deut. xxx. 9 <HI>The Lord will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers, if thou &s;halt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments and &s;tatutes, and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul.</HI></P>
<P>The great and glorious God, who made and governs the world, has an intuitive view of all things in Heaven, earth and hell. He has &s;een from the fir&s;t how our American troubles came on, and how they have proceeded. He permits the Briti&s;h court to oppre&s;s us, and has excited our re|&s;entment; excites us to &s;tand for our liberties civil and religious. We have a great and wi&s;e, an holy and ju&s;t, yet merciful God to apply to. When we con&s;ider our &s;infulne&s;s we &s;ee our need of his infi|nite mercy, and implore it. When we view our conte&s;t with Britain we appeal to the ju&s;tice of God with courage and confidence. By Britain we are abu&s;ed, oppre&s;&s;ed, mo&s;t cruelly treated: We have been forced into this war. Liberty and other com|mon rights of mankind we de&s;ired. The&s;e were denied. The mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to unrea&s;onable terms has been urged upon us. We cannot &s;o meanly, &s;o ba&s;ely &s;ubmit. We are contending for liberty. Our cau&s;e is ju&s;t&mdash;is glorious; more glo|rious than to contend for a kingdom. A cau&s;e on which we may hope for a divine ble&s;&s;ing. Though our contention with Great-Britain is &s;o glorious, yet have we rea&s;on to be humbled and aba&s;ed before
<PB N="5" REF="016296_0005_0F9C1E72A231F7A0">
God. We have rea&s;on to be humble and mourn for the many &s;ins, the many vices that prevail among us. God has a controver&s;y with us: How very different from that of Great-Britain! God mo&s;t righteou&s;ly contends and corrects us for our &s;ins: in this ca&s;e we have rea&s;on to &s;ubmit, repent, and reform. Britain contends and threatens ruin; in this ca&s;e we ju&s;tly vindicate our&s;elves, and ought mo&s;t vigorou&s;ly to exert our&s;elves in a proper de|fence. I have always had the firme&s;t belief that we &s;hould prevail in our conte&s;t with Britain. But I have always thought, and often told you, that God would &s;courge us for our &s;ins. <HI>What &s;on is there whom the father cha&s;tens not?</HI> 'Tis common for God to correct his people when working deliver|ance for them. Thus he often treated I&s;rael in the days of the judges. God often makes u&s;e of the wor&s;t of in&s;truments to correct his own people, while he calls upon them to repent and reform. God corrects us by Britain, and loudly calls upon us to repent; while the cruelty of our enemies, and the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, is not forgot before him. While I am obliged to point out many crying &s;ins among us, I cannot help animating you from the con&s;ideration that we are engaged in a glorious cau&s;e: We are nobly contending for the good of millions yet unborn. In this cau&s;e I would have you encouraged and emboldened, though I mu&s;t lead your thoughts to &s;ome di&s;agreeable &s;ubjects. There are &s;ins, great and aggravated &s;ins among us. God is angry and contending with us. We are this day called upon by our rulers to fa&s;t and pray&mdash;to confe&s;s and for&s;ake our &s;ins. 'Tis my
<PB N="6" REF="016296_0006_0F9C1E735B691ED0">
duty to point out the &s;ins that abound, that are mo&s;t provoking to God, for which he maintains a con|trover&s;y with us, and which we &s;hould &s;incerely bewail and &s;peedily for&s;ake. I &s;hould be unworthy to occupy the place of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, if through fear, &s;loth, or any thing el&s;e I &s;hould neglect to do this. And if while thus endeavouring to keep a good con&s;cience, I &s;hould be obliged to point out &s;ome deficiency in our rulers them&s;elves, I &s;hould act in character as a mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and a friend to my country. The &s;ins or vices which in my view are mo&s;t prevalent among us, and which 'tis proper I &s;hould this day point out, and which call for reformation, are &s;uch as the&s;e:</P>
<P>Infidelity, profane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, neglect and contempt of religion; &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, avarice, and extortion; &s;upporting and encouraging &s;lavery; criminal languor and negligence in defence of our civil and &s;acred rights.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Infidelity, profane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, neglect and contempt of religion.</HI>&mdash;I put all the&s;e together becau&s;e they are breaches of the fir&s;t table of the law. They are more immediately again&s;t God him&s;elf. Sins again&s;t God are in their own nature the greate&s;t &s;ins. The greate&s;t command, as our &s;aviour &s;hews us, is to love or &s;how a proper regard to God. The breach of the greate&s;t command mu&s;t be the greate&s;t &s;in, for &s;in is the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law. In the Jewi&s;h &s;tate &s;ins again&s;t God immedi+ately were ordered to be puni&s;hed with death; and mo&s;t rea&s;onably, becau&s;e that &s;tate was a theocracy; God was their king: And &s;in again&s;t him was high
<PB N="7" REF="016296_0007_0F9C1E74599E45F8">
trea&s;on, was de&s;pi&s;ing and oppo&s;ing the chief ma|gi&s;trate. And though God does not now require us to puni&s;h tho&s;e &s;ins in the &s;ame manner; yet he, the moral governor of the world, is highly of|fended, and will &s;ooner or later enter into judgment for &s;uch iniquity, and will puni&s;h tho&s;e &s;tates where &s;uch &s;ins abound. <HI>The &s;in of infidelity,</HI> is great and mo&s;t ungrateful. To deny and reject the holy &s;criptures, which is the voice of God &s;peaking from heaven to us; to treat it as a forgery and impo&s;ture; to renounce and bla&s;pheme the Saviour who has died for our good, mu&s;t be very wicked and pro|voking, when 'tis con&s;idered with what clear light and evidence the &s;cripture is conveyed to us; by its own internal excellency, mo&s;t agreeable to the divine perfections; by the wonderful and exact ful|filment of ancient and undeniable prophecy and predictions; and by a multitude of the mo&s;t won|derful and inconte&s;table miracles. The &s;in of in|fidelity mu&s;t appear dreadful when we con&s;ider the worth of immortal &s;ouls; an eternity of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery before us; when we con&s;ider how much Je&s;us Chri&s;t has done and &s;uffered for us; when we con&s;ider how God has di&s;tingui&s;hed us from the heathen, and given us a happy opportunity to &s;e|cure our eternal felicity. This dreadful &s;in does awfully abound in our land; but, ble&s;&s;ed be God, I tru&s;t I may &s;ay not among our rulers: Therefore it does not &s;o much expo&s;e us to national or public judgments as if the leaders of the people counte|nanced it.</P>
<P><HI>Profane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing.</HI>&mdash;What &s;hall I &s;ay? I need not inform any that it exceedingly
<PB N="8" REF="016296_0008_0F9C1E79D7A803D8">
abounds. Shall I &s;ay this is le&s;s criminal than in|fidelity? probably in &s;ome inadvertent in&s;tances it may be. Infidelity is the more deliberate &s;in: But to affront God to his face by profaning his &s;acred name is &s;hocking. To defy, and at the &s;ame time imprecate the vengeance of the omnipotent, is mo&s;t wicked and ab&s;urd. To dare the power and ju&s;tice of God, and call for damnation on them&s;elves and others, is folly and wickedne&s;s beyond what I am able to expre&s;s. God him&s;elf has declared that <HI>he will not hold them guiltle&s;s who take his name in vain.</HI> No &s;in has le&s;s temptation; no &s;in is le&s;s excu&s;able; &s;carce any &s;in &s;hews a more hardened and impeni|tent heart. What an amazing increa&s;e of this &s;in in our land in a few years! What an increa&s;e of it in our army &s;ince it was fir&s;t con&s;tituted! Then profane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing was forbid under proper penalties: See the rules and articles of the Congre&s;s for regulating the army. Not only was that vice forbid, but for a time &s;ome con&s;iderable regard was &s;hown to tho&s;e articles. But, alas! how little thought of and regarded now, not only by the common &s;oldiers, but by &s;ome, may I not &s;ay many, of the officers them&s;elves. Not only in our army, but through our land, God is daily af|fronted and provoked by many thou&s;ands who in that impious manner &s;et their mouths again&s;t the Heavens.</P>
<P><HI>Neglect and contempt of religion, or things &s;acred.</HI> &mdash;The day that God requires us to &s;et apart to him&s;elf is di&s;regarded and profaned. He that has a right to di&s;po&s;e of all our time, allows us &s;ix days in &s;even for our own employments and re|creations,
<PB N="9" REF="016296_0009_0F9C1E7B2AD70A80">
and requires us to devote one to him&s;elf. How ungrateful and wicked to rob him of this! and yet how common. Not only the &s;abbath, but religious people and religious exerci&s;es are treated with contempt. The hou&s;e of God, and the wor|&s;hip of God are de&s;pi&s;ed. The man that con&s;cien|tiou&s;ly &s;cruples to comply with fa&s;hionable vices is &s;hunned, is treated with a &s;neer if not hooted at. Oh! how valuable, rather invaluable are the means of grace. If we have immortal &s;ouls, if God has opened a way for our &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, what an un&s;peakable privilege is it to have a day and &s;ea&s;on of grace; and what a provocation to have all that God has done for us neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed. By the work of redemption God de&s;igned chiefly to di&s;play and illu&s;trate his perfections in our world; and by our compliance with the methods of his grace, and a cordial obedience to his law, we glo|rify him. How provoking then to di&s;regard all that God has done for us, and treat religion with contempt. God has di&s;tingui&s;hed us from the heathen, and may we not fear that by de&s;pi&s;ing our privilege God may &s;ay of us as of I&s;rael of old. Amos iii. 2. <HI>You only have I known of all the family of the earth, therefore will I puni&s;h you for all your iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Selfi&s;hne&s;s, avarice, and extortion abound, and cry to Heaven again&s;t us.</HI>&mdash;The &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s I mean is that which is oppo&s;ite to public &s;piritedne&s;s and general benevolence. This is really the root of all the vices in the world; more immediately of tho&s;e which hurt our fellow creatures. A &s;elfi&s;h per&s;on will promote his own private intere&s;t at the expence
<PB N="10" REF="016296_0010_0F9C1E7D1267CAC0">
of the public. He will injure and oppre&s;s others to advance him&s;elf, if he thinks he can do it with impunity. This narrow &s;ordid di&s;po&s;ition has abundantly appeared of late, at a time when we have all had the loude&s;t calls to deny &s;elf, and ex|ert our&s;elves for the common good. But in&s;tead of a public &s;pirit which &s;hould have been the mov|ing principle in us all, there has in many appeared the mo&s;t in&s;atiable avarice, and a greedy gra&s;ping at every thing within their reach; endeavouring, at the expence of the public, to draw every thing po&s;&s;ible into the narrow circle of &s;elf. Hence the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s barefaced extortion; taking ad|vantage of others nece&s;&s;ity; demanding a mo&s;t exorbitant price for the commodities of life, e&s;pe|cially the mo&s;t &s;carce and nece&s;&s;ary articles. If we do not endeavour in &s;ome good mea&s;ure to do as we would be done by, and con&s;ider our neighbours with whom we deal, as being a part of the &s;ame body with our&s;elves, and to be advantaged as well as our&s;elves, we are not fit to be members of civil &s;ociety. God with indignation beholds our &s;elfi&s;h, avaricious, oppre&s;&s;ive practice: And we may well &s;uppo&s;e that for this, among other evils, he corrects us by continuing the war upon us. What &s;ays the &s;cripture, 1 The&s;. iv. 6. <HI>That no man go beyond or defraud his brother in any matter, becau&s;e that the Lord is the avenger of all &s;uch.</HI> Our continuing in this &s;elfi&s;h, unfriendly, cruel practice, under the rod of God, while his judgments are abroad in the land, is an aggravation of our &s;in; and &s;hews a perver&s;e, incorrigible di&s;po&s;ition, and is an im|plicit ju&s;tification of our&s;elves in our evil ways.
<PB N="11" REF="016296_0011_0F9C1E7DCFF5C120">
'Tis an aggravation of the &s;in of oppre&s;&s;ion, and extortion at this time, that 'tis practi&s;ing the &s;ame thing that we &s;o loudly complain of in the conduct of Great-Britain toward us. Britain would have been at peace with us could they have extorted from us every thing which they thought proper. And tho&s;e among us who act upon the principle of getting what they can from others by taking ad|vantage of their wants and weakne&s;s, are practi&s;ing the &s;ame thing which we are now oppo&s;ing in Great-Britain, and which is the ground of that cruel war which this country is now, and has &s;o long a time been bleeding under. The&s;e extorti|oners and oppre&s;&s;ors among our&s;elves, would, if cir|cum&s;tances concurred and favoured, act as cruelly as the Briti&s;h mini&s;try has done. God &s;ees and weighs the conduct of our Briti&s;h oppre&s;&s;ors, and the conduct of extortioners among our&s;elves. His judgments will &s;ooner or later, in this world or the next, mo&s;t dreadfully overtake the guilty. Let us, let the inhabitants of the land fear and take warn|ing; repent and reform that we may not continue under the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, and fall under &s;till heavier judgments. The &s;elfi&s;h &s;ordid di&s;po&s;ition that I have mentioned has no doubt produced that criminal languor and negligence in the defence of our civil and &s;acred rights which the <HI>proclamation</HI> mentions. Are we not too remi&s;s in carrying on the war? Does it not proceed from a &s;elfi&s;h con|tracted principle? Are we not too fearful of ex|pending our property in the public cau&s;e? Is there not a too general di&s;po&s;ition to &s;hrink away from the employment or expence of the war, hoping it
<PB N="12" REF="016296_0012_0F9C1E7E8F736DD8">
will &s;ucceed well, and end well, without our mo&s;t vigorous exertion? But &s;urely we are every way called upon to exert our&s;elves in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t. The importance of the cau&s;e calls upon us; the danger ari&s;ing from remi&s;&s;ne&s;s calls upon us; our fellow creatures &s;uffering in pri&s;ons and other con|finements calls upon us; our religion and civil li|berty are at &s;take; yea, our all is at &s;take: If we do not &s;ucceed we are undone. And &s;hall we at &s;uch a time as this, by a mean felfi&s;hne&s;s, avarice, and extortion, not only &s;hrink back from &s;o good and great a cau&s;e, but even &s;uck the blood, and tear out the bowels of our country. Our extortion really tends to this.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Supporting and encouraging &s;lavery, is one of the great and crying evils among us.</HI>&mdash;Can it be believed that a people contending for liberty &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, be promoting and &s;upporting &s;lavery? What foreign nation can believe that we who &s;o loudly complain of Britain's attempts to oppre&s;s and en&s;lave us, are, at the &s;ame time, vo|luntarily holding multitudes of fellow creatures in abject &s;lavery; and that while we are abundantly declaring that we e&s;teem liberty the greate&s;t of all earthly ble&s;&s;ings? I cannot but think, and mu&s;t declare my &s;entiments, that the encouraging and &s;upporting negro &s;lavery is a crying &s;in in our land. In our conte&s;t with Britain how much has been &s;aid and publi&s;hed in favour of liberty? In what horrid colours has oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery been painted by us? And is it not as great a &s;in for us to practi&s;e it as for Britain? <HI>Thou that &s;aye&s;t a man &s;hould not &s;teal, do&s;t thou &s;teal?</HI> Is not the hard yoke of &s;lavery
<PB N="13" REF="016296_0013_0F9C1E7F61454DB0">
felt by negroes as well as by white people? Are they not fond of liberty as well as others of the human race? Is not freedom the natural unaliena|ble right of all? What &s;ay the Congre&s;s in their declaration of independency? "We hold the&s;e truths to be &s;elf-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among the&s;e are life, liberty, and the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s: that to &s;ecure the&s;e rights governments are in&s;tituted."&mdash; Thus the Congre&s;s. If liberty is one of the na|tural and unalienable rights of all men, as doubt|le&s;s it is; if 'tis &s;elf-evident, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;o clear that it needs not proof, how unju&s;t, how inhuman, for Britons, or Americans, not only to attempt, but actually to violate this right? Britain is attempting to violate it; we in America have a long time been in the actual violation of it. I have ob&s;erved that &s;ins again&s;t God directly, are, in their own nature, the greate&s;t &s;ins; yet there may be &s;ome particular &s;ins again&s;t fellow creatures (which are al&s;o &s;ins again&s;t God) e&s;pecially cruelty, &s;o circum&s;tanced, and &s;o aggravated, as to be the mo&s;t crying &s;ins of a particular people. Thus the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of Dama&s;cus, Gaza, Tyre, Edom, Moab, and Am|mon, for which God entered into judgment, and would not turn away their puni&s;hment, were cru|elty to fellow creatures; becau&s;e they <HI>thre&s;hed Gilead with in&s;truments of iron, carried away the whole captivity to deliver them to their enemies, pur|&s;ued with the &s;word, ca&s;t off pity, ript up the women with child, and burnt the bones of kings into lime.</HI> Amos fir&s;t and &s;econd chapters. And I cannot but
<PB N="14" REF="016296_0014_0F9C1E801145A568">
think our practi&s;ing and patronizing negro &s;lavery, is the mo&s;t crying &s;in in our land. And that on this account, more than any one particular thing, God maintains his controver&s;y with us. The rea|&s;ons why I think &s;o are two: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e 'tis a mo&s;t cruel, inhuman, unnatural &s;in, mo&s;t directly contrary to the whole law of God comprehended in love, to love our neighbour as our&s;elf, and do as we would be done by. The &s;laves have never for|feited their right to freedom; 'tis as the Congre&s;s &s;ay, a natural right, and an unalienable one. And if 'tis taken away, 'tis violently taken. The Apo&s;tle Paul ranks <HI>men &s;tealers</HI> (which is the &s;in we are guilty of by the negro &s;lavery) <HI>with murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, whore-mongers, defilers of them&s;elves with mankind, liars, perjured per&s;ons, &amp;c.</HI> 1 Tim. i. 9. Secondly, becau&s;e 'tis openly and avowedly doing that which we are con|tending again&s;t with our Briti&s;h enemies, and look upon &s;o unju&s;t and cruel in them. The whole of the pre&s;ent war, and all our &s;truggles under it, and our &s;ufferings and hard&s;hips by it, are to oppo&s;e and &s;hun that from others, which we are tolerating and practi&s;ing our&s;elves, and that in a greater de|gree than our enemies are attempting. If we were not blinded by &s;inful &s;elf-intere&s;t, and criminal partiality, we could not but &s;ee and feel the force of the Apo&s;tles rea&s;oning in Rom. 2. <HI>Thou art in|excu&s;able, O man; for wherein thou judge&s;t another thou condemne&s;t thy &s;elf; for thou that judge&s;t do&s;t the &s;ame thing. And thinke&s;t thou this, O man, that judge&s;t them which do &s;uch things, and do&s;t the &s;ame, that thou &s;halt e&s;cape the judgment of God. Thou

Thou that ab|horre&s;t idols, do&s;t thou commit &s;acrilege? Thou that make&s;t thy boa&s;t of the law, through breaking the law di&s;honoure&s;t thou God?</HI> The&s;e words &s;hew that we cannot expect to e&s;cape the judgments of heaven unle&s;s we reform and are more con&s;i&s;tent. We are condemned out of our own mouth, and by our own practice. How often has it been &s;aid in our day that liberty is the greate&s;t human ble&s;&s;ing; and that 'tis oppre&s;&s;ive and cruel to deprive us of it? How oft has it been &s;aid that &s;lavery is more to be dreaded than death? On how many liberty poles; on how many garments and ornaments worn pub|licly, have been in&s;cribed the&s;e emphatical words, <HI>Liberty or Death!</HI> How mu&s;t the&s;e words &s;ound in the ears of tho&s;e that are held in &s;lavery by us? How mu&s;t they &s;ound in the ears of all impartial per&s;ons? E&s;pecially how mu&s;t they appear to the great governor of the world, who is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, but will judge all per&s;ons by the law of liberty and equity? I am per&s;uaded the&s;e united American States mu&s;t, and will groan under the afflicting hand of God, till we reform in this mat|ter. And our ca&s;e looks the darker in this re&s;pect, that 'tis an evil which the legi&s;lature might remove. Sins and vices, that creep in among people, while laws and magi&s;trates are generally again&s;t them, are not &s;o threatning to a &s;tate; but if the political head is &s;ick, and the heart faint, the danger is greater. How ju&s;tly might God &s;ay to us this day, as to I&s;rael of old, <HI>Is this the fea&s;t that I have cho|&s;en?

The cau&s;e of Britain is mo&s;t unju&s;t, and our conte&s;t with them is mo&s;t righteous. But however we may be free from Bri|ti&s;h oppre&s;&s;ion, I venture to &s;ay, we &s;hall have inward convul&s;ions, contentions, oppre&s;&s;ions, and various calamities, &s;o that our liberty will be un|comfortable, till we wa&s;h our hands from the guilt of negro &s;lavery. And our neglecting to reform in this matter may protract the war to a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing length, though we &s;hall &s;ucceed in the end. And now how righteous is it in God to permit oppre&s;&s;ion and extortion to prevail. Is it not a puni&s;hment for our much wor&s;e oppre&s;&s;ion of the &s;laves.</P>
<P>Though the emancipation of the &s;laves ought to be managed by the legi&s;latures, yet the ma&s;ters of &s;laves need not wait for that.

being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;laves, and they are ready to &s;ay, what can we do? Let me ob&s;erve, that there ought to be petitions from the friends of liberty in every county to the legi&s;latures of the &s;everal &s;tates, hum|bly reque&s;ting them to take this matter under con|&s;ideration. If the legi&s;latures would come into proper mea&s;ures to free the &s;laves in &s;ome &s;uitable time, it would free our country from a load of guilt: I &s;ay in &s;ome &s;uitable time, for I &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould not be done at once, but gradually.</P>
<P>I know 'tis objected, that this is not a proper time, that this cannot be entered upon in this &s;tate of war and confu&s;ion. But let me ob&s;erve, that if this is one cau&s;e of God's controver&s;y with us, and of his continuing to frown upon us, the pre|&s;ent is the mo&s;t proper time to con&s;ider and rectify this matter, that it may be a means of freeing us from our calamities. We might as well &s;ay that we cannot, in this difficult time, rai&s;e men for our army, becau&s;e we are &s;o &s;traightened for help, and need our men at home; whereas this is the time in which it mu&s;t be done. To &s;ay this is not the proper time for our legi&s;lature to con&s;ider the eman|cipation of our &s;laves, is, in my view, as ab&s;urd as for a &s;ick man to &s;ay his &s;tomach is &s;o out of order that he cannot now take a di&s;agreeable medicine, but will wait till he is better, and can take it with|out &s;uch difficulty. I know there are many imagi|nary difficulties, and many objections rai&s;ed, but 'tis ea&s;y to get over them all except &s;uch as ari&s;e from &s;elf-intere&s;t, and tho&s;e will not ea&s;ily be got over<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many plans might be offered for emancipating the &s;laves: If it would be of any importance I would offer one in a po&s;t&s;cript.

If we had a clear, rational view, of the worth, nature, and importance of freedom; if we had a proper view of the criminal nature of en&s;laving others; if we had a proper view of that tribunal, where judgment will pa&s;s without any re&s;pect to per&s;ons, by the law of loving others as our &s;elves, we &s;hould ea&s;ily get over all the difficulties that are in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I would think as favourably as I can, concerning the guilty &s;tate of my country, which I mo&s;t hear|tily wi&s;h to pro&s;per and enjoy the divine &s;miles. I would excu&s;e and extenuate, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the unnatural &s;in of holding fellow creatures in per|petual bondage. I &s;uppo&s;e the &s;in is le&s;s aggra|vated, becau&s;e 'tis by many not thought to be a &s;in, and becau&s;e 'tis &s;o common. 'Tis like the polygamy of the ancient patriarchs. That was a common evil, and not duly con&s;idered. To marry &s;everal wives, and have a concubine or mi&s;tre&s;s be&s;ide, was an unnatural evil, as God has created an equal number of each &s;ex. And for a per&s;on of a reli|gious character to live in that practice now, would be &s;candalous, and thought to be impious; and very ju&s;tly. Yet this &s;in in it&s;elf is by no means &s;o great, &s;o unnatural, &s;o cruel, and &s;o provoking to God, as it is to keep in perpetual bondage tho&s;e who have a natural right to freedom, and have not forfeited it. Polygamy of old was a common &s;in and not duly con&s;idered: And &s;lavery being &s;o common now, and not duly weighed, may exte|nuate, but will not free from guilt. I have rea&s;on to hope this matter will be con&s;idered and reme|died, and that God will turn to us in mercy and

pro&s;per us. We &s;hould not be di&s;couraged, but repent and exert our&s;elves in the cau&s;e of liberty, both again&s;t Britain and among our&s;elves. I know &s;ome &s;erious people, hearty friends to our country, are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ink into di&s;couragements when they view the many vices among us, the frowns of God upon us, and how few there are that pay any regard to the tokens of his di&s;plea&s;ure. The abounding of vice, and in&s;en&s;ibility under the rod of God, is certainly the darke&s;t a&s;pect in our public affairs. But &s;till we may encourage our&s;elves in the goodne&s;s of God, and every one, as far as his influence extends, attempt a reformation, beginning with &s;elf. God is yet waiting to be gracious; he deals with us as with a people whom he de&s;igns to &s;ave and not de&s;troy. Though he corrects, yet he &s;hews us many favours. He remarkably appears for us, and prevents our ruin; yea, gives us advan|tages again&s;t our enemies. We &s;hould con&s;ider that correction is no &s;ign of rejection. Things are yet in our favour. Though the war is protracted, and we are &s;o long held under the rod, yet all things &s;hall be for the be&s;t in the end. Nothing le&s;s than what we have &s;uffered would have done for us. Nothing le&s;s would have made &s;ufficiently deep im|pre&s;&s;ion on us and on po&s;terity. Nothing le&s;s would have given us and po&s;terity a view of the worth of the privileges we contend for. How often is it re|corded by Engli&s;hmen that their ance&s;tors have waded through rivers of blood to enjoy the privi|leges of freemen. Our pre&s;ent difficulties will be recollected with advantage to the end of time. If God is contending with us, yet he deals with us as
<PB N="20" REF="016296_0020_0F9C1E890E4AB8D0">
children for whom he de&s;igns mercy: We have many tokens for good. 'Tis encouraging that our rulers regard religion, acknowlege the providence of God, and call upon us to &s;eek him, to repent and reform. And if they are deficient in &s;ome things, yet they uprightly mean to di&s;courage evil, and promote virtue; and whereunto they have not attained, de&s;ire that even this may be &s;hewn unto them. I cannot but hope this day may be in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;uch a fa&s;t as God has cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Some people are apt to think we have no rea&s;on to expect, and can &s;carce pray for an outward ble&s;&s;ing, while &s;o many vices abound among us. Indeed we have rea&s;on to be humbled and mourn, rea&s;on to repent and reform; but that we may not &s;ink into di&s;couragements con&s;ider, that God who is infinite in goodne&s;s, waits long to be gracious, and may yet try us with mercy as a means to lead us to repentance. We may well pray for his mer|ciful interpo&s;ition, <HI>that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we may &s;erve him in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s all the days of our life.</HI> Will &s;ome a&s;k, what if we &s;hould not return to God by repentance and reformation, but that we &s;hould continue in &s;in, and vice continue to abound, as it has done two or three years pa&s;t? I an&s;wer, that would be truly lamentable, and a very dark &s;ign, that would much damp our hopes. God forbid it &s;hould be &s;o. But in that ca&s;e, I &s;hould expect that God would yet try us with a mixture of mer|cies and corrections. That we &s;hould be delivered from Briti&s;h tyranny, and have plenty in our land, with internal commotions, divi&s;ions, convul&s;ions,

oppre&s;&s;ions, and other difficulties, while God gave us a &s;pace to repent and reform, which, if after all we &s;hould refu&s;e to do, we &s;hould be ripening for heavy judgments in &s;ome future time. And how long an infinitely merciful and long &s;uffering God may deter tho&s;e judgments, we know not. I cannot but hope, yea believe, that after the war is over we &s;hall &s;et our&s;elves to reform many things that are ami&s;s among us, &s;lavery not excepted. I mu&s;t believe this great event, this important &s;trug|gle for liberty, will, in the end, be a means of put|ting an end to negro &s;lavery in this land, and to many other oppre&s;&s;ions and impo&s;itions, which a &s;tate of liberty is adapted to throw off and re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Our &s;truggle for liberty is attended to through the world. All eyes are upon us; and all that are not &s;elf-intere&s;ted, or grievou&s;ly impo&s;ed on by mi&s;repre&s;entations, think our cau&s;e is ju&s;t, and wi&s;h us &s;ucce&s;s. Should we obtain our end, this land of liberty could not be &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent, could not with any face continue and &s;upport &s;lavery, and other oppre&s;&s;ions contrary to a &s;tate of freedom. On the whole, my friends, we have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to reform our lives, tru&s;t in God, and exert our&s;elves in our country's cau&s;e with full confidence of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>My dear friends, I cannot leave you without a repeated earne&s;t exhortation to repentance and re|formation. Infidelity, profanene&s;s, contempt of divine things, avarice, oppre&s;&s;ion and extortion, are provoking to God. And if God be again&s;t us, who can eventually be for us? All our exertions will be to no purpo&s;e if God does not favour us.

All above ten, and under 15 years old, male and female, to be free at twenty-five years old. All between fifteen and twenty years old, to be free in eight years from this time. All between twenty and twenty-five, to be free in &s;even years from this time. All between twenty-five and thirty, to be free in &s;ix years. All between thirty and thirty-five, to be free in five years. All between thirty-five and forty, to be free in four years. All between forty and forty five, to be free in three years.
